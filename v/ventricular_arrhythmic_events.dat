40|$|AIMS: Approaches to {{the risk}} {{stratification}} for sudden cardiac death (SCD) remain unsatisfactory. Although late gadolinium enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (LGE-CMR) for SCD risk stratification has been evaluated in several studies, small sample size has limited their clinical validity. We performed this meta-analysis to better gauge the predictive accuracy of LGE-CMR for SCD risk stratification. METHODS AND RESULTS: Electronic databases and published bibliographies were systematically searched to identify studies evaluating the association between the extent of LV scar on LGE-CMR and <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> [SCD, resuscitated cardiac arrest, the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias, or appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy]. Only studies enrolling patients with CAD or non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy were included. Summary estimates of the relative risk (RR) and likelihood ratios (LRs) were calculated using random effects models. Eleven studies comprising 1105 patients were identified. During a mean/median follow-up of 8. 5 - 41 months 207 patients had <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events.</b> <b>Ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> were more common in patients with a greater extent of LV scar: RR 4. 33 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 2. 98 - 6. 29], positive LR 1. 98 (95 % CI 1. 66 - 2. 37), and negative LR 0. 33 (95 % CI 0. 24 - 0. 46). CONCLUSION: The extent of LGE on CMR is strongly associated with the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with reduced LVEF and may be a valuable risk stratification tool for identifying patients who will benefit from ICD therapy. However, uncertainties regarding clinical application persist {{and need to be}} addressed prior to introduction into broad clinical practice...|$|E

40|$|Beta-Blockers and Microvolt T-Wave Alternans.   Introduction: Results of {{microvolt}} T-wave alternans (MTWA) studies vary and may {{be influenced}} by whether beta-blocker therapy was withheld prior to MTWA assessment. We conducted a meta-analysis of the predictive value of MTWA screening for <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> in primary prevention patients with left ventricular dysfunction and examined whether results differed depending upon whether beta-blocker use was withheld prior to MTWA testing. Methods and Results: Prospective studies that evaluated whether MTWA predicted <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> published between January 1980 and September 2008 were identified. Summary estimates for the predictive value of MTWA were derived with random-effects models. Nine studies involving 3, 939 patients were identified. Overall, an abnormal MTWA (positive and indeterminate) test was associated with an almost 2 -fold increased risk for arrhythmic events (pooled RR = 1. 95, 95 % CI: 1. 29 – 2. 96; P = 0. 002). However, significant heterogeneity across studies was observed (P = 0. 024). In the 4 studies in which beta-blocker therapy was not withheld prior to MTWA assessment, an abnormal MTWA test was associated with a 5 -fold increased risk for arrhythmic events (pooled RR = 5. 39, 95 % CI: 2. 68 – 10. 84; P < 0. 001) and was robust to sensitivity analyses. In contrast, the association was much weaker in those studies where the use of beta-blocker therapy was withheld prior to MTWA testing (pooled RR = 1. 40, 95 % CI: 1. 06 – 1. 84; P = 0. 02). Conclusions: In primary prevention patients with left ventricular dysfunction, the predictive power of MTWA varied widely, based on whether beta-blocker therapy was withheld prior to its assessment. This observation may explain the inconsistent results of MTWA studies in this population. (J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol, Vol. 21, pp. 1009 - 1014, September 2010...|$|E

Methods: A total of 118 consecutive patients who underwent ICD implantation without any prior <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>event,</b> from January 2000 to December 2012, were enrolled {{based on the}} MADIT II criteria: left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of ≤ 30 % with ischemic heart disease and at least 4 weeks after a myocardial infarction. We investigated the mortality and factors influencing appropriate ICD therapies in this population. Results: The mean age was 69 ± 10 years, and the mean LVEF was 25. 1 ± 4. 5 %. During the median follow up of 1406 days, the mortality rate was 20 %, and the incidence of appropriate ICD therapy was 37 % at 3 years. Multivariate analysis by using Cox regression model showed that left ventricular diastolic diameter ≥ 60  mm (hazard ratio [HR], 2. 31; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 07 – 5. 38; P= 0. 033) {{and the presence of}} non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) before implantation (HR, 2. 26; 95 % CI, 1. 17 - 4. 39; P= 0. 015) were independent predictors of appropriate ICD therapy. Conclusions: The mortality and incidence of appropriate ICD therapy were 20 % and 37 %, respectively, at 3 years in Japanese patients who met the MADIT II criteria during ICD implantation for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death.

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{sought to}} {{investigate}} the clinical-genetic profile of left-dominant arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (LDAC). BackgroundIn the absence of coronary disease and left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, lateral T-wave inversion and arrhythmia of LV origin are often considered benign. Similarly, chest pain with enzyme release might be attributed to viral myocarditis. We hypothesized that these abnormalities might be manifestations of the “left-dominant” subtype of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. MethodsThe 42 -patient cohort was established through clinical evaluation of individuals with unexplained (infero) lateral T-wave inversion, arrhythmia of LV origin, and/or proven LDAC/idiopathic myocardial fibrosis in the family. ResultsPatients presented from adolescence to age > 80 years with arrhythmia or chest pain but not heart failure. Desmosomal mutations were identified in 8 of 24 families (15 of 33 patients). Magnetic resonance findings included LV late-enhancement in a subepicardial/midwall distribution, corresponding to fibrofatty replacement and fibrosis on histopathology. Fifty percent had previously been misdiagnosed with viral myocarditis, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or idiopathic <b>ventricular</b> tachycardia. <b>Arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> included presentation with ventricular fibrillatory arrest in 1 patient and 2 instances of sudden cardiac death during follow-up. ConclusionsArrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy is distinguished from DCM by a propensity towards arrhythmia exceeding the degree of ventricular dysfunction. The left-dominant subtype is under-recognized owing to misattribution to other disorders and lack of specific diagnostic criteria. Clinicians are alerted {{to the possibility of}} LDAC in patients of any age with unexplained arrhythmia of LV origin, (infero) lateral T-wave inversion, apparent DCM (with arrhythmic presentation), or myocarditis (chest pain and enzyme rise with unobstructed coronary arteries) ...|$|R

Wedensky Modulation (WM) is a new semi-invasive method: A short low-amplitude electrical impulse is applied synchro-nized to the QRS between a precordial and dorsal thoracic patch, {{and changes in the}} following QRS-T are registered. Design. A total of 357 (MI) ICD patients underwent WM testing. QRS-T wavelet analysis provided WM Indexes for the QRS complex (WMI-R) and T wave (WMI-T). Outcome was the time to fi rst occurrence of appropriate device therapy for ventricular arrhythmia. Patients were followed at 6 -month intervals for 2 years. Results. No arrhythmia was induced by the testing. Two-year appropriate arrhythmia treatment occurred in 35 % (WMI-R positive) versus 25 % (WMI-R negative, p 0. 014), and. 45 % versus 26 % (p 0. 001) for WMI-T positive versus negative.

The mean numeric values of the standard time domain signal-averaged ECG variables in patients without <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> differed significantly from those in patients with <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events.</b> The mean values of the spectral temporal signal-averaged ECG variables did not differ between the two patient groups.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Arrhythmogenic right {{ventricular}} cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (ARVC/D) {{is associated}} with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). Risk stratification of ARVC/D patients, however, remains an unresolved issue. In this study we investigated whether heart rate variability (HRV) can be helpful in identifying ARVC/D patients with increased risk of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events.</b> METHODS AND RESULts: We studied 30 consecutive patients (17 males; 45. 4 ± 18 years) with ARVC/D, diagnosed according to guideline criteria; 15 patients (50 %) had received an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) for primary SCD prevention. HRV was assessed on 24 -h ECG Holter monitoring. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of major <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> (SCD, sustained <b>ventricular</b> tachycardia (VT), ICD therapy for sustained VT or ventricular fibrillation (VF)). During the follow-up period (19 ± 7 months), no deaths occurred, but 5 patients (17 %) experienced <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> (4 VTs and 1 VF, all in the ICD group). All HRV parameters were significantly lower in patients with, compared with those without, <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events.</b> Low-frequency amplitude was the most significant HRV variable associated with <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> in univariate Cox regression analysis (P= 0. 017), and was the only significant predictor of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> in multivariable regression analysis (hazard ratio 0. 88, P= 0. 047), together with unexplained syncope (hazard ratio 16. 1, P= 0. 039).

40|$|AbstractThe {{value of}} heart rate variability, {{ambulatory}} electrocardiographic (ECG) {{variables and the}} signal-averaged ECG in the prediction of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> (sudden death or life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias) was assessed before hospital discharge in 416 consecutive survivors of acute myocardial infarction. During the follow-up period (range 1 to 1, 112 days), there were 24 <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> and 47 deaths. The initial relation between several prognostic factors and <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> was explored with use of the Kaplan-Meier product limit estimates of survival function. Impaired heart rate variability < 20 ms (p < 0. 0000), late potentials (p < 0. 0000), ventricular ectopic beat frequency (p < 0. 0000), repetitive ventricular forms (p < 0. 0000), left ventricular ejection fraction < 40 % (p < 0. 02) and Killip class (p < 0. 02) were identified as significant univariate predictors of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events.</b> When these variables were analyzed by using a stepwise Cox regression model, only impaired heart rate variability, followed by late potentials and repetitive ventricular forms remained independent predictors of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events.</b> The combination of impaired heart rate variability and late potentials had a sensitivity of 58 %, a positive predictive accuracy of 33 % and a relative risk of 18. 5 for <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> and was superior to other combinations including those incorporating left ventricular function, exercise ECG, ventricular ectopic beat frequency and repetitive ventricular forms.

Methods and results Global longitudinal LV systolic strain (GLS) was assessed in 308 outpatients affected by CHF, by analyzing standard views with 2 D speckle tracking technique. During a mean follow-up of 26 ± 13 months 37 patients died (29 due to cardiovascular causes), 10 patients underwent heart transplantation, and 75 patients experienced at least 1 episode of hospitalization due to acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). Thirty-one patients without {{a history of}} major <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> experienced the occurrence of ventricular fibrillation and/or tachycardia or sudden death was observed. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that GLS {{was significantly associated with}} all-cause mortality (HR: 1. 15; 95 %CI: 1. 02 - 1. 30; P: 0. 026), cardiovascular death (HR: 1. 20; 95 %CI: 1. 04 - 1. 39; P: 0. 011), cardiovascular death or heart transplantation (HR: 1. 24; 95 %CI: 1. 09 - 1. 41; P: 0. 001), ADHF-related hospitalizations (HR: 1. 15; 95 %CI: 1. 05 - 1. 25; P: 0. 003), and arrhythmic events (HR: 1. 17; 95 %CI: 1. 03 - 1. 33; P: 0. 018).

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{investigated}} {{whether the}} reverse remodeling after cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) might reduce {{the occurrence of}} ventricular arrhythmias (VAs). BackgroundIt is currently debated whether CRT {{has an effect on}} the burden of VAs. MethodsThe study included 398 patients treated with a CRT defibrillator and with a follow-up of at least 12 months. Spontaneous VAs detected by the device were reviewed and validated. ResultsA significant reduction in VA episodes and shock therapies was evident during the follow-up with greater decrease after 1 month. After 6 months of CRT, 227 patients (57 %) showed a reduction in end-systolic volume of ≥ 10 % and were defined as “responders. ” The baseline characteristics were similar between the responders and the nonresponders. Nonetheless, the proportion of patients with recurrence of VA after 1 month of CRT was significantly lower in responders (32 % vs. 43 %, p = 0. 024). Among baseline variables no parameters emerged as predictors of tachyarrhythmia recurrence. However, receiver-operating curve analysis recognized a reduction of left ventricular end-systolic volume at 6 months of 13 % as the best cutoff to identify the reduction of VAs (with a sensitivity of 58 % and a specificity of 54 %). ConclusionsIn patients treated with CRT defibrillators, a reduction in <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> occurs during the initial 12 months after implant and is correlated with the degree of ventricular remodeling induced by the therapy.

40|$|Background: High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) {{are useful}} {{biomarkers}} for cardiovascular risk stratification. Little {{data are available}} regarding the prognostic value of hs-CRP and BNP serum levels and future <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> triggering implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy. Methods: A total of 100 patients eligible for ICD implantation were enrolled in a prospective cohort study. Serum levels of hs-CRP and BNP were obtained the day before ICD implantation and at scheduled follow-up visits. For risk analysis, the study cohort was dichotomized based on serum level of hs-CRP using a cut-off value of 3 mg/L. The endpoint was appropriate ICD therapy triggered by ventricular arrhythmias during a follow-up of 24 months. Results: Appropriate ICD therapy was delivered in 20 % of patients. Median baseline serum level of hsCRP was significantly higher in patients with appropriate ICD therapy than in those without appropriate ICD therapy (5. 33 mg/L vs 2. 19 mg/L; P = 0. 002). The same was true for median serum levels of hs-CRP and BNP during follow-up (5. 43 mg/L vs 2. 61 mg/L, P = 0. 001 and 261. 0 pg/mL vs 80. 1 pg/mL, P = 0. 01, respectively). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that baseline hs-CRP level > 3 mg/L was independently associated with appropriate ICD therapy (odds ratio 4. 0, 95 % 1. 1 - 14. 2; P = 0. 03).

Such guidelines {{were used in the}} Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management (AFFIRM) study. MethodsThis study was an analysis of the risk of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> (<b>arrhythmic</b> death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), and torsade de pointes VT) in the antiarrhythmic drug arm of the AFFIRM study. Each time an antiarrhythmic drug was begun, it was counted as an exposure to that drug and the risk of an <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>event</b> was calculated. ResultsA total of 2, 033 patients received 3, 030 exposures to antiarrhythmic drugs. Ninety-six <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> occurred by six years. Patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction < 40 % had more <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events.</b> Twelve documented cases of torsade de pointes VT were noted.

Among eight patients with inducible sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, six suffered <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> during a median follow-up period of 16 months. No patient without inducible sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia suffered an <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>event.</b> Multivariate analysis showed that of all the variables examined, inducible sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia was the only independent predictor of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> during the follow-up period. The sensitivity for predicting <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> by this response was 100 %, the specificity 97 % and the positive predictive accuracy 75 %. Individually, the other prognostic variables were less sensitive and much less accurate predictors of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events,</b> but the combination of the occurrence of acute phase complications or frequent ectopic activity with an abnormal signal-averaged ECG approached the sensitivity and accuracy of inducible sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. The prognostic utility of programmed ventricular stimulation in patients with recent myocardial infarction is limited because comparable information can be obtained less invasively. However, the test may have a role in selecting therapy in patients judged to be at risk from arrhythmias on the basis of noninvasive assessment...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the natural history of asymptomatic ventricular pre-excitation in children and to determine predictors of potentially life-threatening <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events.</b> BackgroundSudden death can be the first clinical manifestation in asymptomatic children with ventricular pre-excitation, but reduction of its incidence by prophylactic ablation requires the identification of subjects at high risk. MethodsBetween 1995 and 2005 we prospectively collected clinical and electrophysiologic data from 184 children (66 % male; median age 10 years; range 8 to 12 years) with asymptomatic ventricular pre-excitation on the electrocardiogram. After electrophysiologic testing, subjects were followed as outpatients taking no medications. The primary end point of the study was the occurrence of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events.</b> Predictors of potentially life-threatening arrhythmias were analyzed. ResultsOver a median follow-up of 57 months (min/max 32 / 90 months) after electrophysiologic testing, 133 children (mean age 10 years; range 8 to 12 years) did not experience <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events,</b> remaining totally asymptomatic, while 51 children had within 20 months (min/max 8 / 60 months) a first <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>event,</b> which was potentially life-threatening in 19 of them (mean age 10 years; range 10 to 14 years). Life-threatening tachyarrhythmias resulted in cardiac arrest (3 patients), syncope (3 patients), atypical symptoms (8 patients), or minimal symptoms (5 patients). Univariate analysis identified tachyarrhythmia inducibility (p < 0. 001), anterograde refractory period of accessory pathways (APERP) ≤ 240 ms (p < 0. 001), and multiple accessory pathways (p < 0. 001) as risk factors for potentially life-threatening <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events.</b> Independent predictors by multivariate analysis were APERP (p = 0. 001) and multiple accessory pathway (p = 0. 001). ConclusionsThese findings are potentially relevant in terms of early identification of high-risk asymptomatic children with ventricular pre-excitation. Subjects with short APERPs and multiple pathways are at higher risk of developing life-threatening <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> and are the best candidates for prophylactic ablation...|$|R

It is unknown {{whether there is an}} association between early repolarization and ventricular arrhythmias in the coronary artery disease (CAD) population. Methods and Results—Patients with CAD with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators in the healed phase of myocardial infarction were analyzed. In a case-control design, 60 patients who had <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> were matched for age and sex with 60 control subjects. ECGs were analyzed for early repolarization, defined as notching or slurring morphology of the terminal QRS complex or J-point elevation 0. 1 mV above baseline in at least 2 lateral or inferior leads. Results were adjusted for left ventricular ejection fraction. Overall, early repolarization in 2 or more leads was more common in cases than control subjects (32 % versus 8 %, P 0. 005). Early repolarization was noted more commonly in inferior leads (23 % versus 8 %, P 0. 03), and a trend was noted in leads V 4 through V 6 (12 % versus 3 %, P 0. 11). Early repolarization was uncommon in leads I and aVL in cases and control subjects (3 % versus 0 %). Notching was more common in cases than control subjects (28 % versus 7 %, P 0. 008). Slurring and J-point elevation were not associated with ventricular arrhythmias. Conclusions—Early repolarization and, in particular, notching in the inferior leads is associated with increased risk of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in patients with CAD, even after adjustment for left ventricular ejection fraction...|$|E
40|$|AIMS: The {{effect of}} statin {{treatment}} on ventricular arrhythmic complications is uncertain. We sought {{to test whether}} statins {{reduce the risk of}} ventricular tachyarrhythmia, cardiac arrest, and sudden cardiac death. METHODS AND RESULTS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL up to October 2010. Randomized controlled trials comparing statin with no statin or comparing intensive vs. standard dose statin, with more than 100 participants and at least 6 -month follow-up were considered for inclusion and relevant unpublished data obtained from the investigators. Twenty-nine trials of statin vs. control (113 568 participants) were included in the main analyses. In these trials, statin therapy did not significantly reduce the risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmia [212 vs. 209; odds ratio (OR) = 1. 02, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 84 - 1. 25, P = 0. 87] or of cardiac arrest (82 vs. 78; OR = 1. 05, 95 % CI 0. 76 - 1. 45, P = 0. 84), but was associated with a significant 10 % reduction in sudden cardiac death (1131 vs. 1252; OR = 0. 90; 95 % CI 0. 82 - 0. 97, P = 0. 01). This compared with a 22 % reduction in the risk of other 'non-sudden' (mostly atherosclerotic) cardiac deaths (1235 vs. 1553; OR = 0. 78, 95 % CI 0. 71 - 0. 87, P < 0. 001). Results were not materially altered by inclusion of eight trials (involving 41 452 participants) of intensive vs. standard dose statin regimens.

The number of episodes of multiple extrasystoles/hour was 0. 2 (0 - 22), 0. 3 (0 - 4), and 0. 5 (0 - 19); (2 p < 0. 02 mononitrate v placebo). Episodes of ventricular tachycardia showed a non-significant decrease in the captopril and mononitrate groups (mean (SEM) 3. 2 (0. 8), 2. 4 (0. 7), and 4. 7 (1. 3) for the 48 hour period). The incidence of idioventricular rhythm was also reduced in both active treatment groups (28 %, 19 %, and 46 % (2 p < 0. 05 mononitrate v placebo)).

40|$|Background and Objectives：According to the MADIT II criteria, a low left {{ventricular}} ejection fraction (LVEF) {{is one of}} the most important predicting factors for sudden cardiac death (SCD) in post myocardial infarction (PMI) patients, and it is a reasonable indication for ICD implantation. The aim of this study is to reveal the incidence and the prognostic value of the non-invasive parameters and whether the MADIT II criteria for ICD implantation can be applied to Korean PMI patients. Subjects and Methods：During the period from January 2001 to June 2005, 640 PMI survivors were included in this study. The incidence of an abnormal SAECG, pre-mature ventricular complex (PVC) counts ≥ 10 /hr, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) on ambulatory ECG and a low (≤ 30 %) LVEF were studied and used as risk stratification markers for later adverse <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events.</b> Results：The incidence of PVCs ≥ 10 /hr and NSVT on the ambulatory ECG was 14. 3 % and 7. 5 %, respectively. 29 patients (4. 9 %) had a LVEF of less than 30 %. <b>Arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> occurred in 9 of the 29 patients (31 %).

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThe aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} whether the combination of two markers that reflect depolarization and repolarization abnormalities can predict future <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> after acute myocardial infarction (MI). BACKGROUNDAlthough various noninvasive markers have been used to predict <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> after MI, the positive predictive value of the markers remains low. METHODSWe prospectively assessed T-wave alternans (TWA) and late potentials (LP) by signal-averaged electrocardiogram (ECG) and ejection fraction (EF) in 102 patients with successful determination results after acute MI. The TWA was analyzed using the power-spectral method during supine bicycle exercise testing. No antiarrhythmic drugs were used during the follow-up period. The study end point was the documentation of ventricular arrhythmias. RESULTSThe TWA was present in 50 patients (49 %), LP present in 21 patients (21 %), and an EF < 40 % in 28 patients (27 %). During a follow-up period of 13 ± 6 months, symptomatic, sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation occurred in 15 patients (15 %). The event rates were significantly higher in patients with TWA, LP, or an abnormal EF. The sensitivity and the negative predictive value of TWA in predicting <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> were very high (93 % and 98 %, respectively), whereas its positive predictive value (28 %) was lower than those for LP and EF. The highest positive predictive value (50 %) was obtained when TWA and LP were combined. CONCLUSIONSThe combined assessment of TWA and LP was associated with a high positive predictive value for an <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>event</b> after acute MI. Therefore, it could be a useful index to identify patients at high risk of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events...</b>|$|R
40|$|Catecholaminergic {{polymorphic}} {{ventricular tachycardia}} (CPVT) is an inherited arrhythmia syndrome characterized by bidirectional or polymorphic ventricular arrhythmias {{under conditions of}} increased sympathetic activity in young patients with structurally normal hearts.

Here, we systematically review all available studies describing the efficacy of beta-blocker therapy for prevention of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> in CPVT. Because of heterogeneity between the studies, a random-effects meta-analysis model was used to assess the efficacy of beta-blocker therapy in preventing any <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>event</b> [syncope, aborted cardiac arrest (ACA), and sudden cardiac death (SCD) ], near-fatal <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> (ACA and SCD), and fatal <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events.</b> Eleven studies including 403 patients, of whom 354 (88 %) had a beta-blocker prescribed, were identified. Mean follow-up ranged from 20 months to 8 years. Estimated 8 -year arrhythmic, near-fatal, and fatal event rates were 37. 2 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) : 16. 6 - 57. 7], 15. 3 % (95 % CI: 7. 4 - 23. 3), and 6. 4 % (95 % CI: 3. 2 - 9. 6), respectively.

40|$|Background and Aim: The QRS {{duration}} is {{a strong}} predictor of mortality, particularly in heart failure patients. However, studies on the usefulness of QRS duration, {{as a predictor of}} <b>ventricular</b> <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> in ICD patients, have proved to be contradictory. Since in patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), all of the malignant ventricular arrhythmias are recorded and treated with appropriate shock (i. e. appropriate shock and inappropriate shock), in the present study the relationship between the QRS duration and status of appropriate or inappropriate ICD shocks was evaluated.  Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study 65 patients with implanted cardioverter defibrillator were included to prevent their undue death. Before the implantation, QRS duration in the surface ECG was measured and recorded. Furthermore, variables such as age, gender, indication for ICD implantation, family history of sudden cardiac death, and QTc interval before ICD implantation were recorded. During follow-up visits of the patients, ICDs were interrogated and appropriate and inappropriate therapies were traced. Finally logistic regression in SPSS statistical software (V: 11. 5) was used for data analysis.  Results: Mean age of the patients was 17. 208 ± 47. 92 years. Eighteen patients (27. 7 %) were females and 58 (89. 2 %) had a family history of sudden cardiac death. Mean QRS duration and QTc interval were 36. 78 ± 117. 94 msec and 62. 42 ± 466. 97 msec, respectively. There was no statistically significant relationship between QRS duration and status of appropriate and inappropriate ICD shocks. Among the studied parameters, there was only a significant relationship between status of appropriate or inappropriate ICD shocks and the different manufacturers of ICD devices.   Conclusion: QRS duration does not have a significant relationship with status of appropriate and inappropriate ICD shocks. This may not predict arrhythmic events in ICD patients...|$|E

The benefits of the optimized drug treatment of heart failure in reducing ventricular arrhythmia have not been well documented yet. OBJECTIVE: To analyze {{the effects of the}} optimized drug treatment of heart failure on ventricular arrhythmia. METHODS: This is a clinical study with a non-randomized design of 85 consecutive (open cohort) non-selected patients, {{with a mean age of}} 63. 8 ± 12. 2 years; 42 were males and 43 were females. All patients had a diagnosis of heart failure (HF), NYHA Functional Class II to IV, EF < 0. 40 and, after treatment optimization, they were followed from January 2002 to May 2004, regarding the ventricular arrhythmia behavior, at admission and at the end of the study. RESULTS: At the start of the study, 60 % of patients presented more than 1, 000 ventricular extrasystoles in 24 hours, 100 % pairs and 100 % nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). During a follow-up period of 8 to 27 months (20. 0 + 4. 8 months) a significant decrease in the total number of ventricular extrasystoles/ 24 hrs, number of pairs and number of NSVT episodes was observed (p< 0. 05). The improvement in functional class and performance at the six-minute walk test was also observed. A decrease in hospital admissions was also observed in relation to the period prior to the study inclusion (4. 8 hospital admissions/patient/year and at the end of the study, 2. 7 hospital admissions/patient/year) (p< 0. 005).

BACKGROUNDPrevious studies have shown that heart rate variability could predict <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> and sudden death in postinfarction patients, but the prognostic value of heart rate variability for <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> or sudden death in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy has not been established. METHODSTime and frequency domain analysis of heart rate variability on 24 -h electrocardiographic (ECG) recording was assessed in 116 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (91 men, aged 51 ± 12 years, left ventricular ejection fraction 34 ± 12 %). RESULTSMean follow-up (± SD) was 53 ± 39 months. Sixteen patients reached one of the defined study end-points (sudden death, resuscitated ventricular fibrillation or sustained ventricular tachycardia) during follow-up. Using multivariate analysis, only reduced standard deviation of all normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN) (p = 0. 02) and ventricular tachycardia during 24 -h ECG recording (p = 0. 02) predicted sudden death and/or <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events.</b> For SDNN, a cutoff level of 100 ms seemed the best for the risk stratification.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the real incidence of sudden cardiac death (SCD) and sustained ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (sustained VT/VF) in patients following CABG added to SVR and to define their clinical and echocardiographic parameters predicting in-hospital and long-term <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> (SCD + sustained VT/VF). METHODS: Pre- and postoperative clinical and echocardiographic values as well as postoperative electrocardiogram Holter data of 65 patients (21 female, 63 ± 11 years) who underwent SVR + CABG were retrospectively evaluated. Results:  Mean follow-up was 1, 105 ± 940 days. At 3 years, the SCD-free rate was 98 % and the rate free from <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> was 88 %. Multivariate logistic analysis identified a preoperative left ventricular end-systolic volume index (LVESVI) > 102 mL/m(2) (odds ratio [OR] 1. 4, confidence interval [CI] 1. 073 - 1. 864, P = 0. 02; sensitivity 100 %, specificity 94 %) and a postoperative pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) > 27 mmHg (OR 2. 3, CI 1. 887 - 4. 487, P = 0. 01; sensitivity 100 %, specificity 71 %) as independent predictors of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Our and previous studies report a low incidence of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> in patients following SVR added to CABG, considering the high-risk profile of the study population.

Background. Most studies of signal-averaged electrocardiography, radionuclide ventriculography and Holter ECG monitoring in risk stratification after myocardial infarction preceded the introduction of thrombolytic therapy. Methods. A consecutive series of 301 survivors of myocardial infarction, 205 (68 %) of whom received thrombolytic agents, underwent signal-averaged eleclrocardiography (1 st 48 h, day 6 and discharge), Holter ECG monitoring (days 6 to 7) and radionuclide left ventriculography (days 7 to 14). Median follow-up time was 1. 03 years. Results. Thirteen patients (4. 3 %) had an <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>event</b> (sudden death in 11, sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia in 2). The 25 -Hz high pass filtered signal-averaged ECG at discharge was 64 % sensitive (95 % confidence intervals [CI] 36 % to 92 %) and 81 % specific (95 % CI 76 % to 86 %). High grade ventricular ectopic activity on the Holter ECG was only 38 % sensitive (95 % CI 12 % to 64 %) and 74 % specific (95 % CI 71 % to 77 %). Left ventricular ejection fraction < 0. 4 was the best test for prediction of <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> (sensitivity 75 % [95 % CI 56 % to 100 %] and specificity 81 % [95 % CI 76 % to 85 %]).

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the prevalence, characteristics and the predictive value of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) for subsequent death and <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). BACKGROUNDNonsustained VT has been linked to an increased risk for sudden death in coronary patients. It is unknown whether this parameter can be used for selection of high-risk patients to receive an implantable defibrillator for primary prevention of sudden death in patients shortly after AMI. METHODSIn 325 consecutive infarct survivors, 24 -h Holter monitoring was performed 10 ± 6 days after AMI. All patients underwent coronary angiography, determination of left ventricular function and assessment of heart rate variability (HRV). Mean follow-up was 30 ± 22 months. RESULTSThere was a low prevalence (9 %) of nonsustained VT shortly after AMI. Nonsustained VT together with depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was found in only 2. 4 % of patients. During follow-up, 25 patients reached one of the prospectively defined end points (primary composite end point of cardiac death, sustained VT or resuscitated ventricular fibrillation; secondary end point: <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events).</b> Kaplan Meier event probability analyses revealed that only HRV, LVEF and status of the infarct-related artery were univariate predictors of death or <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events.</b> The presence of nonsustained VT carried a relative risk of 2. 6 for the primary study end point but was not a significant predictor if only <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> were considered. On multivariate analysis, only HRV, LVEF and the status of the infarct artery were found to be independently related to the primary study end point. CONCLUSIONSThere is a low prevalence of nonsustained VT shortly after AMI. Only 2 % to 3 % of all infarct survivors treated according to contemporary guidelines demonstrate both depressed LVEF and nonsustained VT. The predictive value of nonsustained VT for subsequent mortality and <b>arrhythmic</b> <b>events</b> is inferior to that of impaired autonomic tone, LVEF or infarct-related artery patency. Accordingly, the use of nonsustained VT to select patients for primary implantable cardioverter/defibrillator prevention trials shortly after AMI appears to be limited...|$|R
