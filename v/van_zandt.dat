5|$|Chase invited {{musician}} Steven <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt,</b> a guitarist in Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band {{to audition}} for a part in his series after seeing him live at the 1997 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame ceremony and being impressed with his appearance and presence. <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt,</b> who had never acted before, originally auditioned {{for the role of}} Tony Soprano but felt the role should go to an experienced actor. <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt</b> eventually agreed to star on the show as mob consigliere Silvio Dante and his real-life spouse Maureen was cast as his on-screen wife, Gabriella.|$|E
5|$|Philip <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt</b> as Mr. Rawlston, News on the March producer.|$|E
5|$|G. Inducted members: Garry Tallent, Roy Bittan, Max Weinberg, Steven <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt,</b> Nils Lofgren, Patti Scialfa, Clarence Clemons, Danny Federici, Vini Lopez, David Sancious.|$|E
25|$|It was {{revealed}} through these proceedings that <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt's</b> annual {{income in the}} years before his death had climbed to over $100,000, {{thanks in large part to}} the royalties accrued from his songs being covered by Willie Nelson, Emmylou Harris, Merle Haggard, Cowboy Junkies, and other major music stars. After <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt's</b> death his road manager, Harold Egger, released video and audio recordings from the songwriter's concerts. An out-of-court settlement in 2006 granted the <b>Van</b> <b>Zandts</b> conditional control of Harold Eggers' mastered recordings while Harold retaining a 50% ownership of seven albums and some royalties for the remaining recordings.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the film}} Country Strong, the Austin Statesman {{describes}} {{the character of}} Beau Hutton as [...] "the next Townes Van Zandt". The 2012 documentary film Low & Clear, which revolves around <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt's</b> son JT fly fishing for steelhead in British Columbia with his old fishing buddy Xenie, features <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt's</b> songs [...] "Dollar Bill Blues" [...] and [...] "My Proud Mountains".|$|R
5000|$|The B-side of {{the single}} was a non-album track; a {{recording}} of Little Stevens [...] "Voice Of America," [...] from Steve <b>Van</b> <b>Zandts</b> 1984 album of the same name. That recording has never been made available on album or CD, although Browne put his version of <b>Van</b> <b>Zandts</b> [...] "I Am A Patriot" [...] on his next album, World in Motion.|$|R
5|$|In October 1980, Springsteen {{released}} his fifth album, The River. For his next album, which would become Nebraska, he initially recorded a demo cassette by himself of {{over a dozen}} songs on January 3, 1982. In April 1982, he began recording sessions at the Power Station studio in New York City with the E Street Band—whose line-up then consisted of Roy Bittan, Clarence Clemons, Danny Federici, Garry Tallent, Steve <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt,</b> and Max Weinberg—with production by Springsteen, <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt,</b> Jon Landau, and Chuck Plotkin.|$|E
5|$|In early 1996, former FBI hostage {{negotiator}} {{and criminal}} profiler Clinton R. <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt</b> was contacted by an investigator working with Bisceglie. Bisceglie asked <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt</b> {{to compare the}} manifesto to typewritten copies of handwritten letters David had received from his brother. Van Zandt's initial analysis determined that there was better than a 60 percent chance that the same person had written the letters {{as well as the}} manifesto, which had been in public circulation for half a year. Van Zandt's second analytical team determined an even higher likelihood that the letters and the manifesto were the product of the same author. He recommended that Bisceglie's client immediately contact the FBI.|$|E
5|$|Chase {{personally}} selected {{all of the}} show's {{music with}} producer Martin Bruestle and music editor Kathryn Dayak, sometimes also consulting Steven <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt.</b> The music was usually selected once the production and editing of an episode was completed, but on occasion sequences were filmed to match preselected pieces of music.|$|E

5000|$|Springsteen {{made his}} acting {{debut in the}} final episode of Season 3 of <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt's</b> show Lilyhammer, which was named [...] "Loose Ends", after a Springsteen song on his album Tracks. He played Giuseppe Tagliano, the brother of <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt's</b> character, Frank Tagliano aka [...] "Giovanni [...] "Johnny" [...] Henrikssen". Giuseppe is an {{undertaker}} and owner of a funeral parlor who occasionally works as a hitman for a mafia family which Frank is associated.|$|R
5|$|Nevertheless, O'Brien {{confirmed}} on February 18, 2009, that Weinberg and {{the band}} were indeed coming with him. Weinberg had not missed an E Street Band show since joining the outfit in 1974, and E Streeter <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt</b> said {{that no amount of}} rehearsal by another drummer could replace Weinberg's intuitive understanding of Springsteen's performance gambits.|$|E
5|$|Returning {{in their}} {{recurring}} roles are John Bregar as Dylan Michalchuk, Shenae Grimes as Darcy Edwards, Dalmar Abuzeid as Danny <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt,</b> Alex Steele as Angela Jeremiah, Linlyn Lue as Ms. Kwan, and Jennifer Podemski as Ms. Sauve. Marc Donato is introduced as Derek Haig.|$|E

50|$|High, Low & In Between was cut at Larrabee Sound Studios in Los Angeles with Kevin Eggers {{returning}} in {{the role}} of producer. The session players included guitarist Larry Carlton, guitarist David Cohen of Country Joe & the Fish fame, and bassist Harvey Newmark, while organist Don Randi arranged the music for <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt's</b> eleven new creations. Unlike <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt's</b> previous album Delta Momma Blues, which features very sparse arrangements, High Low and in Between incorporates a folk-rock edge.|$|R

5|$|The body {{of one of}} U-853s crewmembers was {{recovered}} in 1960 and was interred in the Island Cemetery Annex on <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt</b> Avenue in Newport, Rhode Island. The submarine's two propellers were on display for many years at the Inn at Castle Hill in Newport and {{are now in the}} custody of the United States Naval War College Museum at the Newport Naval Station.|$|E
5|$|Another {{analogous}} case {{within a}} single species has been termed Browerian mimicry (after Lincoln P. Brower and Jane <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt</b> Brower). This {{is a case of}} bipolar (only two species involved) automimicry; the model is the same species as its mimic. Equivalent to Batesian mimicry {{within a single}} species, it occurs when there is a palatability spectrum within a population of harmful prey. For example, monarch (Danaus plexippus) caterpillars feed on milkweed species of varying toxicity. Some feed on more toxic plants, and store these toxins within themselves. The more palatable caterpillars thus profit from the more toxic members of the same species.|$|E
5|$|Browerian mimicry, {{named after}} Lincoln P. Brower and Jane <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt</b> Brower, is a {{postulated}} form of automimicry; where the model {{belongs to the}} same species as the mimic. This is the analogue of Batesian mimicry within a single species, and occurs {{when there is a}} palatability spectrum within a population. Examples include the monarch and the queen from the Danainae subfamily, which feed on milkweed species of varying toxicity. These species store toxins from its host plant, which are maintained even in the adult (imago) form. As levels of toxin vary depending on diet during the larval stage, some individuals are more toxic than others. Less palatable organisms, therefore, mimic more dangerous individuals, with their likeness already perfected.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Van</b> <b>Zandt's</b> Roadsongs album {{version of}} The Rolling Stones' [...] "Dead Flowers" [...] was {{used during the}} final scene of the Coen Brothers' 1998 film, The Big Lebowski. The song was also {{included}} on the movie's soundtrack. Since his death, <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt's</b> recordings have been licensed by his family {{for use in a}} number of films and television programs, including Stepmom, Six Feet Under, In Bruges, Calvary, Crazy Heart, Leaves of Grass, Seven Psychopaths, Deadwood, Breaking Bad , True Detective and Hell or High Water (Dollar Bill Blues).|$|R
5000|$|The album opener [...] "At My Window" [...] recalls <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt's</b> {{composition}} {{from the}} year before, [...] "To Live Is to Fly," [...] with life-affirming lyrics like [...] "Living is laughing, dying is nothing at all". The gentle [...] "No Place to Fall" [...] and the rousing [...] "Loretta" [...] paint two very different portraits of female perfection, the latter {{telling the story of}} a barroom girl who is perpetually twenty-two and [...] "tells me lies I love to b'lieve". The title [...] "Rex's Blues" [...] alludes to <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt's</b> friend Rex Bell, with the singer commenting in his preamble to the song on Live at the Old Quarter: [...] "This song's about this good friend of mine, uh, Rex Bell, who used to own half this place. It's called 'Rex's Blues.' If you cut cards with Rex and you get a three he'll get a two, y'know what I mean?" [...] Bell later stated of the song, [...] "I didn't like it for many years. But he really pegged me". The song explores the singer's long battle with depression, it's subject matter contrasting with the understated, gently-plucked banjo and the singer's amiable vocal delivery. [...] "Pueblo Waltz" [...] also name-drops a couple <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt's</b> friends, Susanna and Guy Clark. [...] "Two Girls", which includes the lines [...] "I've got two girls, one's in Heaven, one's below", may have been inspired by <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt's</b> former girlfriend Leslie Jo Richards, who had been murdered the year before. The song paints a surreal landscape peopled with oddball characters like Jolly Jane and her dozen husbands who come and go, caught in the oblique routines of their lives with no rhyme or reason. Commenting on [...] "White Freight Liner Blues", biographer John Kruth contends it is:...an obvious metaphor for the heroin barreling like a semi down the Interstate of <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt's</b> veins, addresses the dangers that he and his pals constantly faced for a brief moment of euphoria...The song brought together two of <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt's</b> biggest inspirations - a driving rockabilly rhythm with a blues lyric reminiscent of [...] "Trouble in Mind, a standard in Lightnin' Hopkins' set...|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} scene of the 2014 season three finale of Steven <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt's</b> Lilyhammer {{television}} series, actor Trond Fausa Aurvåg's Norwegian character, Torgeir Lien, calls another, traitorous character a quisling.|$|R
5|$|<b>Van</b> <b>Zandt,</b> {{though he}} {{personally}} favored annexation by the United States, was {{not authorized to}} entertain any overtures from the US government on the subject. Texas officials were at the moment deeply engaged in exploring settlements with Mexican diplomats, facilitated by Great Britain. Texas's predominant concern was not British interference with the institution of slavery – English diplomats had not alluded to the issue – but the avoidance of any resumption of hostilities with Mexico. Still, US Secretary of State Upshur vigorously courted Texas diplomats to begin annexation talks, finally dispatching an appeal to President Sam Houston in January 1844. In it, he assured Houston that, in contrast to previous attempts, the political climate in the United States, including sections of the North, was amenable to Texas statehood, and that a two-thirds majority in Senate could be obtained to ratify a Texas treaty.|$|E
25|$|Born in Fort Worth into {{a wealthy}} family, Townes <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt</b> was a third-great-grandson of Isaac <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt</b> (a {{prominent}} {{leader of the}} Republic of Texas) and a second great-nephew of Khleber Miller <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt</b> (a Confederate Major {{and one of the}} founders of Fort Worth). <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt</b> County in east Texas was named after his family in 1848.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, Israeli singer David Broza {{performed}} with <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt</b> during a Writers in the Round concert in Houston. When <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt</b> died, {{he left a}} shoe box full of unreleased poems and lyrics with a request that Broza set them to music. The resulting album was Night Dawn: The Unpublished Poetry of Townes <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The concert {{took place}} 15 months before <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt's</b> death. Just {{as in his}} Live at the Old Quarter 22 years earlier, <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt's</b> humor, wedged between some very sad songs is a {{prominent}} feature. The stripped down versions of Earle's songs are also unusual. Earle's own live performances and albums rarely offer the listener so many chances to hear his music without the backing of a full band. Clark spends the least time talking between songs, allowing his songs to tell their own stories. Occasionally the artists interact, such as when Clark joins Earle on the [...] "Mercenary Song".|$|R
5000|$|When Coach Hauser {{visits the}} Bada Bing with Silvio Dante, the song {{played in the}} bar is [...] "Can't You Feel the Fire" [...] from Steven <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt's</b> album Freedom - No Compromise.|$|R
5000|$|Luxury Liner is {{an album}} by country music artist Emmylou Harris, {{released}} in 1976. The album was Harris' second successive #1 country album on the Billboard Music Charts, although, unlike the preceding Elite Hotel, {{there were no}} #1 hits from this album. The highest charting singles were the #6 Chuck Berry cover [...] "(You Never Can Tell) C'est la Vie" [...] and the #8 [...] "Making Believe" [...] (originally a hit for Kitty Wells). However, the album may be better known for including the first cover version of Townes <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt's</b> 1972 song [...] "Pancho and Lefty", which subsequently became <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt's</b> best-known composition.|$|R
25|$|Barbeau married actor/playwright/producer Billy <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt,</b> {{thirteen}} years her junior, on December 31, 1992.

Billy is the half-brother of musician/actor Steven <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt.</b> She gave birth to twin boys, Walker Steven and William Dalton <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt,</b> on March 17, 1997, at age 51, claiming {{she was the only}} one on the maternity ward who was also a member of AARP.|$|E

25|$|<b>Van</b> <b>Zandt</b> died on New Years Day 1997 from cardiac arrythmia {{caused by}} health {{problems}} stemming {{from years of}} substance abuse. The 2000s saw a resurgence of interest in <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt.</b> During the decade, two books, a documentary film titled Be Here to Love Me, {{and a number of}} magazine articles about the singer were written.|$|E
5000|$|In South Africa, [...] "Sun City" [...] {{would later}} inspire {{musician}} Johnny Clegg {{to create a}} local organization similar to <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt's,</b> and [...] "Sun City" [...] also became the catalyst for the South Africa Now TV series.|$|R
5000|$|AllMusic praises Live and Obscure, {{noting that}} [...] "The {{rambling}} Texas troubadour {{did not disappoint}} his fans, peers, and colleagues that night...In this intimate setting, <b>Van</b> <b>Zandt's</b> aw-shucks charm comes through not just his songs, but his in-between banter." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{between these}} shows, Question Mark was still {{occasionally}} active {{with the original}} Mysterians.
