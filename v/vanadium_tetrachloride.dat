5000|$|Organovanadium {{chemistry}} is {{the chemistry of}} organometallic compounds containing a carbon to vanadium (V) chemical bond. Organovanadium compounds are of some relevance to organic synthesis and to polymer chemistry as reagents and catalysts. [...] Oxidation states for vanadium are +2, +3, +4 and +5. Low valency vanadium is usually stabilized with carbonyl ligands. Oxo ligands for example in vanadyl ions are common when the valency increases. In most compounds outside the oxidation state of +5, vanadium is paramagnetic, hampering NMR spectroscopy. Typical vanadium precursors are vanadium(III) chloride and its adduct with THF VCl3(THF)3 and <b>vanadium</b> <b>tetrachloride.</b>|$|E

40|$|On {{the basis}} of results of {{freezing}} point lowering experiments, it was reported by Simons and Powell that an equilibrium existed between VCl_ 4, and V_ 2 Cl_ 8 in carbon tetrachloride solution. Since <b>vanadium</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> is an odd molecule, it was implied that dimerization could take place, as in nitrogen dioxide, such that the odd electrons become paired.

40|$|The {{polymerization}} of ethylene with Ziegler-type catalysts containing mono- and bis-cyclopentadienylvanadium compounds as constituents {{has been}} studied.

Under a wide variety of reaction conditions the cyclopentadienylvanadium compounds were found to be less active. Moreover, with vanadium, moderate activity was observed for systems based on monocyclopentadienyl derivatives and negligible to weak activity for mixtures based on biscyclopentadienyl derivatives.

40|$|We {{examined}} the electrical and optical properties of vanadium-doped GaAs grown by metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy using <b>vanadium</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> (VCl 4) as a novel dopant source. Samples with various vanadium incorporations were investigated. All samples were n type. The electron concentration {{dependence on the}} VCl 4 flow rate was established. At 15 K, by comparison with undoped layers grown in the same conditions, photoluminescence spectra of V-doped exhibited three new emission bands: at 1. 41, 1 and 0. 72 eV. The 1 and 0. 72 eV band emissions were attributed to V 2 + and V 3 + intracenter emission, while the 1. 41 eV band was suggested to be a donor-bound transition. The identity of the donor is tentatively attributed to a donor complex that associates vanadium to an arsenic vacancy.

40|$|The {{solubility}} of anhydrous {{aluminum chloride}} in solutions of titanium tetrachloride and <b>vanadium</b> <b>tetrachloride</b> was determined {{as part of}} a re-search project-by the Bureau of Mines to make a homogeneous alloy sponge of titanium, vanadium, and aluminum. Solubility curves were established using an autoclave at 7520, 10020, 12520, and 15020 C. The solubility of AJC 13 in TiC 14 is 0. 2 wt pct at 7520 C; it increases to 18. 3 wt pct at 15020 C. The data concur with data from earlier researchers of this bi-nary system for 7520 to 12520 C. For the VC 14 -AlC 13 binary system the solubility of AlC 13 is 0. 1 wt pct at 7520 C, increasing to 1. 6 wt pct at 15020 C. For the TiC 14 -AlClrVC 14 ternary system the solubility of AlC 13 decreases from the values found with a pure TiC 14 -AlC 13 system to the lower values found with a pure VC 14 -AlC 13 system at the respective temperatures...|$|E
40|$|A {{study has}} been made into the {{atmospheric}} pressure chemical vapour deposition of nitrides and oxynitrides of vanadium, titanium and chromium. <b>Vanadium</b> <b>tetrachloride,</b> vanadium oxychloride, chromyl chloride and titanium tetrachloride {{have been used as}} precursors with ammonia, at different flow conditions and temperatures. Vanadium nitride, vanadium oxynitride, chromium oxynitride, titanium/vanadium nitride and titanium/chromium oxynitride have been deposited as thin films on glass. The APCVD reaction of VCl_ 4 and ammonia leads to films with general composition VN_xO_y. By raising the ammonia concentration so that it is in excess (0. 42 dm" 3 min"-" 1 VCl_ 4 with 1. 0 dm" 3 min"-" 1 NH_ 3 at 500 deg. C) a film has been deposited with the composition VN_ 0 _. _ 8 O_ 0 _. _ 2. Further investigation discovered similar elemental compositions could be reached by deposition at 350 deg. C (0. 42 dm" 3 min"-" 1 VCl_ 4 with 0. 5 dm" 3 min"-" 1 NH_ 3), followed by annealing at 650 deg. C, and cooled under a flow of ammonia. Only films formed below 400 deg. C were found to contain carbon or chlorine (< 5 %). The reaction of VOCl_ 3 and ammonia also lead to films of composition VN_xO_y the oxygen to nitrogen ratios depending on the deposition conditions. The reaction Of VOCl_ 3 (0. 42 dm" 3 min"-" 1) and ammonia (0. 2 dm" 3 min"-" 1) at 500 deg. C lead to a film of composition VN_ 0 _. 47 O_ 1 _. _ 0 _ 6. The reaction of VOCl_ 3 (0. 42 dm" 3 min"-" 1) and ammonia (0. 5 dm" 3 min"-" 1) at 650 deg. C lead to a film of composition VN_ 0 _. _ 6 _ 3 O_ 0 _. _ 4 _ 1. The reaction of chromyl chloride with excess ammonia {{led to the formation of}} chromium oxide (Cr_ 2 O_ 3) films. Mixed metal films were prepared from the reactions of <b>vanadium</b> <b>tetrachloride,</b> titanium tetrachloride and ammonia to prepare V_xTi_yN_z and chromyl chloride, titanium tetrachloride and ammonia to form TiCr_xO_yN_z. Both reactions produced the intended mixed coating but it was found that the vanadium / titanium nitride contained around 10 % vanadium whatever the conditions used. Oxygen contamination affected the films to a lesser extent than the single metal films. The reaction of VCl_ 4 (0. 33 dm" 3 min"-" 1) and TiCl_ 4 (0. 1 dm" 3 min"-" 1) with NH_ 3 (0. 5 dm" 3 min"-" 1), at 550 deg. C lead to a film of composition Ti_ 0 _. _ 7 _ 5 V_ 0 _. 1 NO_ 0 _. _ 1 _ 5. Chromium / titanium oxynitride films contained minimal titanium (< 10 %), but in contrast to the chromyl chloride / ammonia reaction nitrogen incorporation was good. The reaction of CrO_ 2 Cl_ 2 (0. 25 dm" 3 min"-" 1) and TiCl_ 4 (0. 1 dm" 3 min"-" 1) with NH_ 3 (0. 5 dm" 3 min"-" 1), at 600 deg. C lead to a film of composition CrTi_ 0 _. _ 1 N_ 0 _. _ 5 O_ 0 _. _ 7 _ 5. All films have been investigated for their use as heat control mirrors, with vanadium / titanium nitride films and vanadium oxynitride films providing results of interest to the solar control industry. A film prepared by the reaction of VOCl_ 3 (0. 42 dm" 3 min"-" 1) and NH_ 3 (0. 8 dm" 3 min"-" 1) at 500 deg. C for 30 seconds resulted in a film with nearly 65 % IR reflectance, good visual transmission and an attractive lustre. A film deposited from VCl_ 4 (0. 33 dm" 3 min"-" 1), TiCI_ 4 (0. 1 dm" 3 min"-" 1) and NH_ 3 (0. 6 dm" 3 min"-" 1) at 550 deg. C for 30 seconds produced a film of equivalent heat mirror quality. Films deposited from CrO_ 2 Cl_ 2 and NH_ 3 were found not to confer heat control mirror qualities.
