ABSTRACT: This study proposes a new design concerning a parallel compliant <b>vibrating</b> <b>mechanism</b> for high precision production lines and enforces dynamic simulating analysis. The conventional mechanism for separating fine particles has based on advantages of spring to make vibrating motion to separate out various particles with radius ranges from 7 mm to 20 mm. But {{it also has a}} few defects such as additional weights of the springs, the wear between the kinematic joints. To overcome these limitations, this paper applies the conception of compliant mechanism to design novel model. First, using the principle of compliant mechanism, a parallel compliant <b>vibrating</b> <b>mechanism</b> is developed. The use of ANSYS, finite element analysis (FEA) is performed to explore the results of dynamic analysis concerning both angular velocity of mechanism and both angular acceleration and both equivalent stress and total deformation of compliant segments. The results show that a proposed mechanism can be used in high precision manipulators, actuators, and production line chain. Future work will conclude an investigation into the vibration frequency...|$|E
40|$|Electrospark Deposition (ESD) is a {{specialized}} micro-bonding process {{which is used}} to coat a base material, known as the substrate, with a stronger, tougher, and more durable top layer, the electrode. Short durations of electrical pulses ranging from milliseconds to microseconds are used to deposit the electrode onto the substrate. This process can be used to repair damaged parts, tools or equipment, or to improve and extend tool and equipment life. The objective {{of this study is to}} develop a better understanding of the TiCp/Ni Metal Matrix Compound (MMC) coating process on RSW electrodes for the purpose of automation. Key aspects of the process are identified to aid in developing a method and approach for process automation. In order to test the effects of automating this ESD process three automation solutions were considered and tested. The first was a Manual-Automated Hybrid setup which involved the use of a manual vibrating TiCp/Ni electrode applicator which was mounted on a CNC lathe. The second solution was the novel Actively Controlled Rotating and Reciprocating mechanism which replaced the vibration of the manual applicator with an actively controlled reciprocating mechanism and added rotational control of the TiCp/Ni electrode. The third solution was the novel Actively Controlled Rotating and <b>Vibrating</b> <b>mechanism</b> which used the rotational portion of the Actively Controlled Rotating and Reciprocating mechanism but replaced the reciprocating mechanism with a vibrational one. Observations of initial tests lead to an understanding of how the TiCp/Ni electrode wears during the process while using a manual applicator as opposed one of the novel mechanisms and helped to solidify a method to ensure even wearing of the TiCp/Ni electrode for automation. Further testing of the Actively Controlled Rotating and Reciprocating mechanism provided information about the electrical characteristics of the process and the effects of these results on the process. These test results were used to develop a constraint on the contact duration between the TiCp/Ni electrode and the RSW Copper electrode. Force measurements of the manual operators at Huys Industries Ltd, the Actively Controlled Rotating and Reciprocating mechanism, and the Actively Controlled Rotating and <b>Vibrating</b> <b>mechanism</b> were used to identify differences in the process results based on the mechanism used. With the use of this data an upper limit for the contact force for this process was specified in order to ensure damage free coatings. The Actively Controlled Rotating and <b>Vibrating</b> <b>mechanism</b> was used to specify a minimum travel speed for the TiCp/Ni electrode along with a minimum number of passes required to ensure gapless coatings. The Actively Controlled Rotating and <b>Vibrating</b> <b>mechanism</b> produced relatively decent coatings of TiCp/Ni on the RSW Copper electrodes and serves as a proof of concept and basis for automation of this process...|$|E

40|$|In optical {{systems in}} which laser {{illumination}} is delivered via multimode optical fibers, laser speckle can be rendered incoherent {{by a simple}} but highly effective technique. The need to eliminate speckle arises because speckle can {{make it difficult to}} observe edges and other sharp features, thereby making it difficult to perform precision alignment of optical components. The basic ideas of the technique is to vibrate the optical fiber(s) to cause shifting of electromagnetic modes within the fiber(s) and consequent shifting of the speckle pattern in the light emerging from the fiber(s). If the frequency of vibration is high enough, a human eye cannot follow the shifting speckle pattern, so that instead of speckle, a human observer sees a smoothed pattern of light corresponding to a mixture of many electromagnetic modes. If necessary, the optical fiber(s) could be vibrated manually.

40|$|This {{study is}} to {{investigation}} {{and development of the}} PV self -cleaning impacted of dust that would enable a wider deployment of solar photovoltaic systems in the Middle East and Gulf region which enjoys abundant solar radiation throughout the year, and where sandstorm dust and elevated ambient temperature persist. The dust reduces the power generated by the solar devices or hinders the visibility through windshields. The research intends to combine a number of technologies to assist and improve the operational performance of photovoltaic (PV) systems. This investigation covered some of systems which employed PV self-cleaning techniques to remove the particles of dust from the PV panel surface. Regular cleaning of the panels is often necessary to prevent serious degradation of their performance, especially in regions with dusty climates. However, manual cleaning of solar panels, especially in the context of large installation, can be a labour-intensive process and thus often prohibitively costly. Even in small buildings, cleaning a PV system can involve complicated issues of access that might require the intervention of specialist staff. Some of the technologies involve the use of electrodynamic screens for electrostatic dust removal, robotic cleaning tools, <b>vibrating</b> <b>mechanisms</b> featuring piezo-ceramic actuations, as well as TiO 2 -treated chemical or nano-films. Nevertheless, none of these technologies has to date been able to establish itself as an industry standard and achieve the necessary commercial breakthrough. The numerical and experimental results demonstrate that the diameter of the nozzle throat has {{a significant impact on the}} mass flow rate of the water vapour; some results in a high mass flow rate whereas a larger diameter leads to a lower rate. The nozzle diameter also affects the magnitude of the velocity and the mass fraction of the water vapour. It was found that a nozzle throat of a 5 mm diameter above the PV surface by 50 mm with 222 m/s is optimum for the jet pump design for water vapour production and dust removal covering sufficient PV surface area. Moreover, variations in the length of the mixing chamber have a significant effect on the mass flow rate of the water vapour. It was found that the mass flow rate of the water vapour is higher in a shorter mixing chamber than it is in a longer mixing chamber. Therefore, to be more effective, a jet pump should have a smaller nozzle diameter, a shorter mixing chamber and a smaller jet pump throat. In light of the above, self-cleaning technologies could present the perfect solution to these issues and help address many of the obstacles preventing solar panel technology from becoming more widely adopted. This would help reduce dependence on the fossil-fuel based energy resources which can be devoted to the generation of national revenues and also leads to a reduction of CO 2 emissions to the environment...|$|R

With this technique, the cloudy, crystalline lens in the eye is mechanically disrupted using a probe that vibrates at an ultrasonic frequency. However, this <b>vibrating</b> tip <b>mechanism</b> leads to frictional heat generation, which can potentially cause extensive thermal damage to fragile tissue structures surrounding the lens. In order to minimize damage due to this frictional heat, a coolant is typically used while the phaco probe is in operation.

Using a 2 -D axisymmetric geometry to model the eye structure, we determined that using the heat source by itself results in temperatures far above the threshold of 328 K for thermal wound injury. However, with the addition of the coolant for heat removal, temperatures in the iris were lowered to less than 320 K, thereby reducing any thermal burn risk to the patient.

Among the devices, a drug delivery stent is a medical device which requires precision machining. Conventional drug delivery stent has problems of residual polymer and decoating because the drug is coated {{on the surface of}} stent with the polymer. If the drug is impregnated in the micro sized holes on the surface, the problems can be overcome because {{there is no need to}} use the polymer anymore. Micro sized holes are generally fabricated by laser machining; however, the fabricated holes do not have a high aspect ratio or a good surface finish. To overcome these problems, we propose a vibration-assisted machining mechanism with PZT (Piezoelectric Transducers) for the fabrication of micro sized holes. If the <b>mechanism</b> <b>vibrates</b> the eyepiece of the laser machining head, the laser spot on the workpiece will vibrate vertically because objective lens in the eyepiece shakes by the mechanism's vibration.
