25|$|The {{question}} of {{priority for the}} <b>variable</b> <b>resistance</b> feature of the telephone was raised by the examiner before he approved Bell's patent application. He told Bell that his claim for the <b>variable</b> <b>resistance</b> feature was also described in Gray's caveat. Bell pointed to a <b>variable</b> <b>resistance</b> device in Bell's previous application in which Bell described a cup of mercury, not water. Bell had filed the mercury application at the patent office a year earlier on February 25, 1875, long before Elisha Gray described the water device. In addition, Gray abandoned his caveat, and {{because he did not}} contest Bell's priority, the examiner approved Bell's patent on March 3, 1876. Gray had reinvented the <b>variable</b> <b>resistance</b> telephone, but Bell was the first to write down the idea and the first to test it in a telephone.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the often contrived advertising claims of the manufacturers of <b>variable</b> <b>resistance</b> isotonic machinery. Specifically, the study sought to ascertain whether certain equipment was compatible with musculo-skeletal and perceptual needs and limitations of the human user: that is, to determine whether presently installed eccentric cams, which provide the <b>variable</b> <b>resistance,</b> matched the users force curves. The format {{of this research was}} in the ergonomic tradition in which empirical research is not necessarily the primary avenue. Consequently the inter-disciplinary nature of ergonomics required small-scale laboratory- simulation experiments to be conducted in a diverse range of disciplines such as physiology, psychology and biomechanics. It was found that on all five pieces of <b>variable</b> <b>resistance</b> machinery analysed, a mismatch between the force curves and the eccentric cams exist. The cams were redesigned accordingly. The metabolic cost of performing fixed-rate isoinertial lifts was moderate. The psychophysical analysis revealed that perceptual responses indicated that the work was classified as 'light' and only at 30 % stress levels do local cues begin to dominate. Based on these findings it was concluded that manufacturers advertising claims in the instances analyzed were not well-founded and that <b>variable</b> <b>resistance</b> isotonic machinery should only be used to develop muscular strength and endurance, and do not effectively serve as weight-loss devices. iii...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} was to assess CSF dynamics of different shunt constructions in patients with adult hydrocephalus syndrome and correlate these findings to clinical outcome, neuroradiology, and the specifications of the shunts provided by the manufacturer. Thirty four patients with idiopathic adult hydrocephalus (normal pressure hydrocephalus) syndrome were included in a prospective, consecutive case series. A differential pressure valve (Cordis Hakim standard system) was used in 28 patients and a <b>variable</b> <b>resistance</b> valve (Cordis Orbis-Sigma) in six. A constant pressure infusion method was used; CSF pressure and conductance were determined before surgery. Three months after shunt placement CSF pressure, the "pressure v flow" curve, and gravity induced flow were measured. There {{was no difference between}} mean preoperative and postoperative resting CSF pressures in patients with Hakim shunts. The opening pressures of the Hakim shunts were higher than the value proposed by the manufacturer. A pronounced gravity effect induced CSF flow and decrease of the CSF pressure. In functioning <b>variable</b> <b>resistance</b> valves, CSF dynamics normalised postoperatively. There was no gravity effect and the characteristics shaped "pressure v flow" curve was sometimes seen. Six patients (three differential pressure valves, three <b>variable</b> <b>resistance</b> valves) had non-functioning shunts. Four of these patients were improved after the operation but improvement was transient in three. In all patients, there was no relation between the width of the ventricles and clinical improvement or CSF pressure. In conclusion, the differential pressure valve system does not behave according to the specifications provided by the manufacturer. A decrease in CSF pressure in patients with this shunt was solely due to the effect of gravity. Eleven percent of the differential pressure valves and 50 % of the <b>variable</b> <b>resistance</b> valves were non-functioning.

Fourteen physically active men performed two full knee extensions against loads of 40 - 80 kg in both conditions.

40|$|Most of the {{existing}} screw drive in-pipe robots cannot actively adjust the maximum traction capacity, which limits the adaptability to {{the wide range of}} <b>variable</b> environment <b>resistance,</b> especially in curved pipes. In order to solve this problem, a screw drive in-pipe robot based on adaptive linkage mechanism is proposed. The differential property of the adaptive linkage mechanism allows the robot to move without motion interference in the straight and varied curved pipes by adjusting inclining angles of rollers self-adaptively. The maximum traction capacity of the robot can be changed by actively adjusting the inclining angles of rollers. In order to improve the adaptability to the <b>variable</b> <b>resistance,</b> a torque control method based on the fuzzy controller is proposed. For the <b>variable</b> environment <b>resistance,</b> the proposed control method can not only ensure enough traction force, but also limit the output torque in a feasible region. In the simulations, the robot with the proposed control method is compared to the robot with fixed inclining angles of rollers.
