In this study, the flow fields of T-junction and Y-junction were analyzed using shear stress transport (SST) model in ANSYS/CFX software. The simulation results identified the variation rule of velocity peak in T-junction with different frequencies and phase-differences, meanwhile, the eddy and <b>velocity</b> <b>shock</b> existed {{in the corner of}} the T-junction, and the limit working state was obtained. Although the eddy disappeared in Y-junction, the <b>velocity</b> <b>shock</b> and pressure loss were still too big. To address these faults, an arc-junction was designed. Based on the flow fields of arc-junction, the eddy in the junction corner disappeared and the maximum of velocity peak declined compared to T-and Y-junction. Additionally, 8 series of arc-junction with different radiuses were tested to get the variation rule of velocity peak. Through the computation of the pressure loss of three junctions, the arc-junction had a lowest loss value, and its pressure loss reached the minimum value when the curvature radius is 35. 42 mm, meanwhile, the <b>velocity</b> <b>shock</b> has decreased in a low phase...|$|E

In addition to optimal policy under discretion, three classic rules, interest rate targeting, monetary targeting, and the Taylor rule are ranked under both fiscal and <b>velocity</b> <b>shocks.</b> The non-stationarity of prices under the Taylor rule makes it inferior to the other rules under which prices are stationary.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{chemical}} and emission properties of mildly irradiated (G 0 = 1) magnetised shocks in diffuse media (nH= 10 ^ 2 to 10 ^ 4 /cm 3) at low to moderate velocities (from 3 to 40 km/s). Results: The formation of some molecules relies on endoergic reactions. In J-shocks, their abundances are enhanced by several orders of magnitude for <b>shock</b> <b>velocities</b> as low as 7 km/s. Otherwise most chemical properties of J-type shocks vary over less than {{an order of magnitude}} between velocities from about 7 to about 30 km/s, where H 2 dissociation sets in. C-type shocks display a more gradual molecular enhancement as the <b>shock</b> <b>velocity</b> increases. We quantify the energy flux budget (fluxes of kinetic, radiated and magnetic energies) with emphasis on the main cooling lines of the cold interstellar medium. Their sensitivity to <b>shock</b> <b>velocity</b> is such that it allows observations to constrain statistical distributions of <b>shock</b> <b>velocities.</b> We fit various probability distribution functions (PDFs) of <b>shock</b> <b>velocities</b> to spectroscopic observations of the galaxy-wide shock in Stephan's Quintet (SQ) and of a Galactic line of sight sampling diffuse molecular gas in Chamaeleon. In both cases, low velocities bear the greatest statistical weight and the PDF is consistent with a bimodal distribution. In the very low <b>velocity</b> <b>shocks</b> (below 5 km/s), dissipation is due to ion-neutral friction which powers H 2 low energy transitions and atomic lines. In moderate <b>velocity</b> <b>shocks</b> (20 km/s and above), the dissipation is due to viscous heating and accounts for most of the molecular emission. In our interpretation a significant fraction of the gas on the line of sight is shocked (from 4 % to 66 %).

It prescribes that policymakers should aim to keep nominal GNP [...] rather than the money supply [...] growing along a target path. The rule seems attractive for two reasons. First, it would automatically call for an offsetting adjustment in money growth in response to <b>velocity</b> <b>shocks</b> and this should stabilize real GNP. Second, it would automatically call for a reduction in real GNP growth in response to price shocks and this should stabilize inflation. The rule also has the virtue of simplicity. Explaining how it works to policymakers seems easy. Consider the typical explanation of the two automatic adjustments. (1) Nominal GNP is the product of money and veloci-ty. The rule is to keep nominal GNP on a fixed target: when velocity goes down, money must be increased by an equal amount. Hence, <b>velocity</b> <b>shocks</b> are automatically offset.
