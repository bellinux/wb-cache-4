40|$|A {{life cycle}} cost {{comparison}} study between a newly built LNG ferry and a 21 year old conventional ferry {{was carried out in}} this study. The objective was to study the LNG <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> cost effectiveness compared to an equivalent existing vessel of mature age. It has been assumed that both vessels are to be operating according to the LNG <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> current production pattern at a specific ferry service. The study has a time span of 30 years. Another assumption is that both vessels are assumed to be procured from respectively the newbuilding market and the second-hand market. This study emphasises primarily vessel generated costs. The cost elements that are investigated are among other: capital costs, fuel costs, lube oil costs, maintenance costs, downtime costs, NOx emission costs and income due to scrapping. Costs such as port fees and management costs are not included. Due to the high level of uncertainty related to many of the cost elements, a sensitivity analysis is performed. A cost breakdown structure has been derived to identify the relevant cost elements which are to be studied. Data are gathered from the shipping company that owns the vessels. This is done by use of their databases and records. Documentations and specifications are also provided by the shipping company s suppliers. Estimations which lacked sufficient input data have been partly founded on expert opinions. It has been found that the total {{life cycle cost}}s of the conventional vessel are 12 % lower than the LNG <b>vessel</b> <b>s.</b> The most significant cost elements are identified to be the capital costs, fuel costs, maintenance costs, NOx emission costs and downtime costs. If an internal rate of return is applied, the LNG <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> disadvantage when it comes to total life cycle costs will increase. This is due to the LNG <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> high initial costs. The results show that the capital costs related to the procurement of the conventional vessel in real term value are only 8 % of the LNG <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> capital cost. It has been found that the conventional vessel has 19 % lower energy consumption than the LNG vessel. Despite of this, it is estimated that the conventional vessel will have 9 % higher total fuel cost over the time period. The main {{reason for this is that}} the existing gap between the two energy prices is forecasted to increase over the time period. It is estimated that the LNG vessel has 9 % lower maintenance cost over the time period. One of the reasons for this is the expectation of reduced deterioration of the fuel supply system and other components such as engine nozzles and exhaust valves. The LNG <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> total NOx emission costs are estimated to be only 15 % of the conventional <b>vessel</b> <b>s,</b> which is one of the most significant differences between the ferries. This is due to the LNG engine s ability to operate at very low NOx emission rates. An analysis regarding a measure that may reduce the LNG <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> life cycle cost is also conducted. The vessel has installed a hybrid shaft generator system. The main engine is able to deliver power to the <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> electricity grid by use of the shaft generator. Vice versa, the shaft generator is able to function as a motor and thus use electric power for propulsion. In other words, the shaft generator gives the vessel flexibility with respect to power consumption and power production. The measure is to replace the LNG <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> shaft generator with a new unit which has sufficient capacity to supply all the main switchboard s consumers without having to run the <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> standby generator. Then the main engine will alone be able to provide sufficient electricity power to the <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> grid. This is assessed to enable savings of fuel, NOx tax and maintenance cost due to among other increased efficiency of electricity production. Data for this analysis regarding the current operation of the propulsions system is gathered from the LNG <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> power management system. Information regarding the system s components is provided by the suppliers. It has been found that the yearly savings due to the reduced fuel, maintenance and NOx expenditures are in lower edge of 1 million NOK. This measure will reduce the <b>vessel</b> <b>s</b> NOx emission significantly. The measure therefore qualifies to a significant support from the Norwegian NOx fund, which may reduce the financial cost of the replacement to about 1 million NOK. Consequently, the payback time is about one year, which is a relatively short time period. However, it is important to underline that there is uncertainty related to these calculations and the inherent limitations which are associated with the measure...|$|R

The RNA extracted from this structure sedimented in sucrose density gradients at 26 S. After a longer period of exposure to 3 H-uridine, the radio-active viral RNA was associated with a structure which sedimented in sucrose density gradients as would materials with coefficients of about 140 S. The 140 <b>S</b> <b>structure</b> contained viral RNA and viral protein. It was shown that the 140 <b>S</b> <b>structures</b> are not virus-induced polysomes. The 140 <b>S</b> <b>structure</b> contained predominantly the 40 S type of viral RNA and some 26 S type. Electrophoretic analysis of the disrupted virion revealed that at least two proteins (types I and II) were present in the purified virion.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to quantitatively measure and compare the environmental load and construction cost of different structural frame types. Construction cost also accounts for the costs of CO 2 emissions of input materials. The choice of structural frame type is a major consideration in construction, as this element represents about 33 % of total building construction costs. In this research, four constructed buildings were analyzed, with these having either reinforced concrete (RC) or steel (<b>S)</b> <b>structures.</b> An input-output framework analysis was used to measure energy consumption and CO 2 emissions of input materials for each structural frame type. In addition, the CO 2 emissions cost was measured using the trading price of CO 2 emissions on the International Commodity Exchange. This research revealed that both energy consumption and CO 2 emissions were, on average, 26 % lower with the RC structure than with the <b>S</b> <b>structure,</b> and the construction costs (including the CO 2 emissions cost) of the RC structure were about 9. 8 % lower, compared to the <b>S</b> <b>structure.</b> This research provides insights through which the construction industry will be able to respond to the carbon market, which is expected to continue to grow in the future...|$|R
