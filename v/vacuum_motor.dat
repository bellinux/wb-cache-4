50|$|When {{cleaning}} is complete, {{the vacuum}} hose {{is removed from}} the wall inlet (which snaps shut and shuts down the <b>vacuum</b> <b>motor).</b> The hose is coiled up and hung on a storage rack, and any cleaning accessories are stowed away.|$|E
50|$|Early wipers {{were often}} {{driven by a}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>motor</b> powered by {{manifold}} vacuum. This had the drawback that manifold vacuum varies depending on throttle position, and is almost non-existent under wide-open throttle, when the wipers would slow down or even stop. This problem was overcome somewhat by using a combined fuel/vacuum booster pump.|$|E
5000|$|In a <b>vacuum</b> <b>motor,</b> {{the partial}} vacuum {{is created by}} an {{external}} pump. These motors were commonly used to power railway turntables in the UK, using vacuum created by a steam locomotive's vacuum brake ejector. The operating principle {{is similar to a}} steam engine - in both cases power is extracted from a difference in pressure.|$|E
50|$|A vacuum {{delay valve}} is a valve {{with a small}} orifice, which delays a vacuum signal. These are {{commonly}} used in automobiles to alter the behavior of <b>vacuum</b> switches, <b>vacuum</b> <b>motors,</b> and other <b>vacuum</b> devices.|$|R
50|$|The {{legacy of}} carpet {{sweepers}} {{lives on in}} floor cleaning robots that have limited suction power and rely on sweeping to collect larger bits of debris from the floor. While some research models of robotic vacuums only rely on <b>vacuum</b> <b>motors,</b> models on the market such as Roomba or bObsweep invariably combine suction and sweeping.|$|R
50|$|In Britain, where steam hauled trains {{generally}} have vacuum operated brakes, {{it was quite}} common for turntables to be operated by <b>vacuum</b> <b>motors</b> worked from the locomotive's vacuum ejector or pump via a flexible hose or pipe although a few manually and electrically operated examples exist. The major manufacturers were Ransomes and Rapier, Ipswich and Cowans Sheldon, Carlisle. The GWR was the railway company that built several tables for its own use; {{there is little evidence}} any other companies did so.|$|R
5000|$|Roomba budget models (Dirt Dog and Model 401) used a {{simplified}} interface (a single button) and lacked {{some of the}} software-controlled flexibility of other versions. They were less expensive models intended for first-time purchasers. The Roomba Dirt Dog contained sweeping brushes and a larger dust bin, but lacked the <b>vacuum</b> <b>motor,</b> using the space {{that would be required}} for the vacuum for additional dust bin volume. It was designed for a home shop or garage environment. The Roomba Model 401 was similar but had a standard-size dust bin and vacuum system. The Dirt Dog was discontinued in 2010.|$|E
50|$|Modern floor {{scrubbers}} have a pre-sweep {{option that}} removes {{the need to}} sweep the floor before scrubbing. The pre-sweep brush head is {{placed in front of}} the vacuum system to collect dust and debris before it can block the vacuum system. In the past it was important to sweep the floor before scrubbing to remove any debris and dust that could clog the vacuum hose or build up in the <b>vacuum</b> <b>motor,</b> which can decrease performance. If this happens, the vac hose may need to be removed to clear the obstruction and/or the vac motor may need to be blown out with compressed air.|$|E
50|$|Small vacuum motors {{were also}} used to operate {{windscreen}} wipers in automobiles. In this case, the motors were powered by manifold vacuum. This arrangement was not very satisfactory because, if the throttle were wide open, the wipers would slow down, or even stop. Modern automobiles use electrically powered wipers. Modern automobiles still use a <b>vacuum</b> <b>motor</b> of a kind, however, the vacuum servo. Brakes are operated by a hydraulic system, but they use a ‘vacuum motor’ to amplify the force provided by the driver. Small vacuum motors {{were also used}} from the late 1960s to control servomechanisms such as door locks, heater controls or movable bonnet ventilation flaps.|$|E

40|$|Tough {{competition}} {{on the market}} of <b>vacuum</b> cleaner <b>motors</b> forces the manufacturers to purchase only top-notch quality and flawless products at the lowest prices. Therefore there is an increasing need for fast, reliable and objective quality assessment of every single unit {{at the end of}} the assembly cycle. In order to meet the requirements of quality assurance automatic and in-depth quality end-tests are applied in modern manufacturing [1 - 5]. In the underlying paper a structure of the diagnostic system for quality tests of <b>vacuum</b> cleaner <b>motors</b> is presented. The core of the system contains four modules for feature extraction that employ, respectively: analysis of commutation, vibration analysis, sound analysis and check of parity relations. The symptoms resulting therefrom are processed by an approximate reasoning module. Particular attention in this paper is devoted to vibration analysis. Vibration of <b>vacuum</b> cleaner <b>motor,</b> which directly or indirectly impacts motor's lifespan, is contributed by different sources. However, the most serious implications regard vibration of vacuum cleaner housing accompanied by unpleasant noise. The main contribution of the paper concerns a particular measurement procedure and analysis of the experimental data obtained on a series of motors with different conditions. Thi...|$|R
50|$|Professional {{machines}} {{range from}} portable machines, which use electricity {{to heat the}} water and power the water pump and <b>vacuum</b> <b>motors,</b> to larger truck mounted machines. Truck mounts are normally stationary gas/diesel engine or PTO powered machines installed in a van or truck. The portable machine is able to access difficult to reach buildings and high story floors, while the truck mount's advantages are its power to heat the water and power of vacuum and faster cleaning and drying times. DIY and rental machines {{use some of the}} technology from the professional systems, but with less power and usually without an element to heat water (filling the unit with hot water is advised) the results are limited, these units are not typically called HWE systems.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s and early 2000s, several {{companies}} developed robotic vacuum cleaners, {{a form of}} carpet sweeper usually equipped with limited suction power. Some prominent brands are Roomba, Neato, and bObsweep. These machines move autonomously while collecting surface dust and debris into a dustbin. They can usually navigate around furniture {{and come back to}} a docking station to charge their batteries, and a few are able to empty their dust containers into the dock as well. Most models are equipped with motorized brushes and a <b>vacuum</b> <b>motor</b> to collect dust and debris. While most robotic vacuum cleaners are designed for home use, some models are appropriate for operation in offices, hotels, hospitals, etc.|$|E
5000|$|A {{vacuum system}} {{can be used for}} power transmission, {{although}} the maximum power that can be transmitted to a <b>vacuum</b> <b>motor</b> is less than conventional pneumatics. There is an optimum pressure for the operation of a vacuum power transmission system, of around 0.4bara (8 psig), as Downie also shows. Although less efficient than pneumatics, it can be perfectly workable. For example a 22mm (7/8") pipe on vacuum can transmit as much power on 0.4 bara (8 psig) as a 6mm (1/4") pipe on 8bara (100 psig). The system is efficient enough that Boulton and Watt used vacuum power transmission in their factory. They called the vacuum main in the factory the ‘spirit pipe’.|$|E
50|$|Toner {{particles}} have electrostatic properties {{by design}} and can develop static-electric charges when they rub against other particles, objects, or the interiors of transport systems and vacuum cleaner hoses. Because {{of this and}} the small particle size, toner should not be vacuumed with a conventional home vacuum cleaner. Static discharge from charged toner particles theoretically may ignite dust in the vacuum cleaner bag or create a small explosion if sufficient toner is airborne. Toner particles are so fine that they are poorly filtered by household vacuum cleaner filter bags and can blow through the <b>vacuum</b> <b>motor</b> into the room. So they also can cause overheat by clogging the motor filter and short circuit by their electric conductivity (carbon, iron) when they melt inside the motor.|$|E
50|$|The Kerr Jetstream {{incorporated}} several updates {{including the}} available belt-driven fan replacing the Electrolux <b>vacuum</b> cleaner <b>motor</b> originally used. A removable refractory plug allowing {{access to the}} tunnel was added {{in the back of}} the unit. An updated control panel was adopted and the option of an electronic panel was added.|$|R
50|$|Safety {{precautions}} {{include the}} use of gloves, and a protective dust mask to prevent inhalation. If spilled toner is cleaned with a standard vacuum cleaner the toner may become electrically charged and catch fire, and is so fine that it passes through filters and can escape into the room or the <b>vacuum</b> cleaner <b>motor.</b>|$|R
50|$|However, BSH’s Hausgeräte, {{which makes}} {{household}} appliances under the Bosch and Siemens brands explained {{that many of}} its machines contain “intelligent sensor technology” to avoid loss of suction, which control the <b>vacuum</b> cleaner <b>motor</b> automatically. After weeks of court proceeedings, Dyson lost the court battle against Bosch; the courts in the Netherlands decided that Dyson accusations were baseless.|$|R
5000|$|CEC {{was unique}} in {{that almost all of}} its sensors and {{actuators}} were digital; instead of the usual analog throttle position, coolant temperature, intake temperature and manifold pressure sensors, it used a set of fixed pressure- and temperature-controlled switches (as well as a wide-open throttle switch on the carburetor) to control fuel mixture and ignition timing. The only analog sensor in the system was the oxygen sensor. In other respects, it was a typical [...] "feedback" [...] carburetor system of the early-1980s, using a stepper motor to control fuel mixture and a two-stage [...] "Sole-Vac" [...] (which used a solenoid for one stage, and a <b>vacuum</b> <b>motor</b> for the other) to control idle speed. The CEC also controlled ignition timing using information from the fuel-control section and an engine knock sensor on the intake manifold.|$|E
50|$|In January 2010, Evolution Robotics {{released}} Mint (model number: 4200), {{a cleaning}} robot which dusts and wet-mops hard surface floors. The robot systematically covers the floor line-by-line and cleans {{around the edges}} before it returns to its original position. Mint {{is one of the}} most quiet floor cleaning robot (it has no <b>vacuum</b> <b>motor),</b> but it is not a fully autonomous robot. The cleaning cloth has to be attached to the cleaning pad before cleaning and it has to be removed after it is done. It could cover 93 sq m (1000 sq ft) mode and 23 sq m (250 sq ft) in wet mopping mode. Mint used a navigation cube as a beacon for navigation, and the original model was only able to handle one of these beacons at a time. The indoor navigation system is called NorthStar®.|$|E
50|$|Heated {{air intake}} systems operate on the {{principle}} of increasing the temperature of the air. The fuel will more effectively stay in suspension in the air rather than falling out of suspension and forming droplets {{on the floor of the}} manifold. Warm air from the outside of an exhaust manifold is drawn up into the air cleaner to increase the air temperature as quickly as possible after the engine starts. The air cleaner assembly incorporates a thermostatic vacuum switch that responds to the air temperature after the air filter element and actuates a <b>vacuum</b> <b>motor</b> that moves the control flap to allow the air to be drawn from a cooler location such as the top of the engine bay or outside the engine bay. If the air becomes too cold, the thermostatic switch will automatically change back to drawing heated air from around the outside of the exhaust.|$|E
5000|$|Increased {{suction power}} — Because the <b>vacuum</b> cleaner <b>motor</b> and dirt {{collection}} system {{need not be}} portable, the weight {{and size of the}} unit are not as severely constrained as in a portable system; some units even use two motors for extra power. [...] In addition, bagless filterless systems avoid the inevitable loss of suction in filtered systems caused by collected dust clogging the filters.|$|R
50|$|In {{the years}} after the {{creation}} of the first windshield wiper, Trico was involved in the development of vacuum-powered wiper systems. Trico was involved in a patent dispute with William M. Folberth who, with his brother Fred, invented a vacuum-powered wiper motor in 1919. The patent was granted in 1922, and Trico later purchased the Folberth company to settle the dispute. <b>Vacuum</b> wiper <b>motors</b> produced by Trico carry an earliest patent number that dates back to 1928.|$|R
50|$|Steering was by cam and lever {{with the}} box {{mounted on the}} car's frame. From 1932 the brake <b>vacuum</b> servo <b>motor</b> was run from the car's gearbox. Brakes were on all four wheels and {{operated}} by rods, drums were enclosed. The front brakes used the Perrott principle. The central hand lever used the same brake shoes at the back as the foot brake. Springs were semi-elliptical and flat with gaiters and shock absorbers. The rear springs were outside the frame.|$|R
50|$|The Link family firm in Binghamton {{manufactured}} player pianos and organs, and Ed Link {{was therefore}} familiar with such components as leather bellows and reed switches. He {{was also a}} pilot, but dissatisfied {{with the amount of}} real flight training that was available, he decided to build a ground-based device to provide such training without the restrictions of weather and the availability of aircraft and flight instructors. His design had a pneumatic motion platform driven by inflatable bellows which provided pitch and roll cues. A <b>vacuum</b> <b>motor</b> similar to those used in player pianos rotated the platform, providing yaw cues. A generic replica cockpit with working instruments was mounted on the motion platform. When the cockpit was covered, pilots could practice flying by instruments in a safe environment. The motion platform gave the pilot cues as to real angular motion in pitch (nose up and down), roll (wing up or down) and yaw (nose left and right).|$|E
40|$|The Personal Vacuum Assisted Climber or PVAC {{for short}} (as shown in Fig 2) {{is a new}} means for {{climbing}} walls. Unlike ordinary climbing methods used today, the PVAC scales walls via suction. This suction is produced by three spinning impellers within each <b>vacuum</b> <b>motor,</b> which removes air from a sealed area. A climber pulls down on a vacuum pressure release mechanism to release the vacuum. Foot stirrups are used by the climber to climb to the next higher step. This allows {{the strength of the}} climber 2 ̆ 7 s legs to lift his/her body reducing arm fatigue, allowing rapid ascension of any climbable wall. The overall desirables to accomplish in this project are to make a new system that is: Lightweight Improved ergonomics Easy to manufacture and produce Quieter These items were accomplished by using design tools such as Finite Element Analysis (FEA), Design for Manufacturing and Assembly (DFMA), Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA), preexisting studies (ergonomics), and testing techniques. Tests were conducted to ensure that the new PVAC is operating to safe standards. These tests will be looked at in the following areas: Sound Reduction Battery Voltage Profile Temperature Analysis <b>Vacuum</b> <b>Motor</b> Performance Friction Coefficient Experiments Lastly, future applications and new improvements were addressed so next generation systems can be made if further development ensues...|$|E
30|$|The “Planar Walker” (Fig.  2 a) uses a {{suction force}} {{to stick to}} a wall. Many other wall {{climbing}} robots also employ this method [8 – 10]. Such robots are fitted with a suction cup to stick their body to the wall. Generally, these cups include a controllable <b>vacuum</b> <b>motor.</b> Robots using suction force can move freely on wall surfaces, and heavy devices can be mounted on the robot when the suction force is sufficiently strong. However, this mechanism has several drawbacks for our application. Robots that employ this mechanism require a continuous energy supply to maintain the robot’s adhered status. Moreover, estimation of a robot’s position is not easy; without additional sensors, this estimation includes errors, and these errors accumulate according to increments in moving distance.|$|E
40|$|In-depth and {{automatic}} quality end-tests in modern manufacturing represent an important {{means for the}} assurance of top-quality and flawless products. Tough competition on the market of <b>vacuum</b> cleaner <b>motors</b> is increasing the need for fast, reliable and objective quality assessment of every single unit {{at the end of}} the assembly cycle.

50|$|The airwatt is {{a useful}} {{measurement}} of <b>vacuum</b> cleaner <b>motor</b> efficiency, since the power carried by a fluid flow (in {{the case of a}} typical house vacuum the fluid is air) is equal to pressure times volumetric flow rate. The airwatt relates to actual airflow, while part of the electrical power (watts) consumed by a vacuum cleaner is dissipated into heat due to necessarily imperfect efficiency; two vacuum cleaners of the same airwattage have essentially the same suction, while devices of the same electrical wattage may have a difference in efficiency and thus have substantially different airwattage.|$|R
40|$|A report {{presents}} {{the concept of}} a machine aboard the space shuttle that would cut oversized thermal-tile blanks to precise sizes and shapes needed to replace tiles that were damaged or lost during ascent to orbit. The machine would include a computer-controlled jigsaw enclosed in a clear acrylic shell that would prevent escape of cutting debris. A <b>vacuum</b> <b>motor</b> would collect the debris into a reservoir and would hold a tile blank securely in place. A database stored in the computer would contain the unique shape and dimensions of every tile. Once a broken or missing tile was identified, its identification number would be entered into the computer, wherein the cutting pattern associated with that number would be retrieved from the database. A tile blank would be locked into a crib in the machine, the shell would be closed (proximity sensors would prevent activation of the machine while the shell was open), and a "cut" command would be sent from the computer. A blade would be moved around the crib like a plotter, cutting the tile to the required size and shape. Once the tile was cut, an astronaut would take a space walk for installation...|$|E

40|$|The Personal Vacuum Assisted Climber (PVAC) system {{built in}} 2012 by the Ascending Aggies at Utah State University, {{designed}} using <b>vacuum</b> <b>motors</b> to provide suction to pads {{to allow the}} user to climb various surfaces, needs to be further developed before being fully marketable. The current system {{does not have a}} user-friendly interface and is very loud (approx. 90 dB). These issues were addressed to answer the following question: how can the current PVAC system be optimized to decrease noise and produce a user friendly interface while maintaining current run time? To obtain the sound reduction desired it was decided to surround the motors with a hard plastic polystyrene case created by a vacuum forming process and then lined with sound-reducing convoluted foam. The motor exhaust was channeled through a single muffler out of the bottom of the case. This resulted in a sound reduction of over 20 decibels. The power system was improved with a new choice of 36 volt motors which could each be run off of only four batteries or an ac power supply through an inverter. The batteries used in this system increased run time by 50 % and decreased the overall weight of the system by 8 lbs. This choice of motors was found to supply in excess the needed suction to support a 300 lb person. A Pulse Width modulator was also installed to provide a control on Voltage output of the batteries to optimize the run time. An electrical board controller was designed and installed to improve the user interface with an LED display on the pads of the system showing the remaining battery voltage and motor temperature...|$|R
