Operating the piezotube in single-electrode excitation mode allows the comparatively uncomplex measurement of the induced voltages at sensor electrodes. The Finite Element (FE) approach enables an accurate modeling of the voltage signals. Furthermore, geometrical details included in the dynamic FE-model are the sample mass attached {{to the top of}} the tube as well as tube eccentricity and dislocated electrodes. Additionally, the FEmodel accounts for dynamics-coupling effects along the separate axes of the three-dimensional tube motion. Comparison with experimental data demonstrates the accuracy of the FE-model.
