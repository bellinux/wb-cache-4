40|$|Acoustic {{emission}} (AE) {{tests have}} been conducted on small-diameter Kevlar 49 /epoxy pressure <b>vessels</b> <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> long-term sustained load-to-failure tests. Single-cycle burst tests were used {{as a basis for}} determining the test pressure in the sustained-loading tests. AE data from two vessel locations were compared. The data suggest that AE from vessel wall-mounted transducers is quite different for identical <b>vessels</b> <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> the same pressure loading. AE from boss-mounted transducers yielded relatively consistent values. These values were not a function of time for vessel failure.

40|$|Acoustic {{emissions}} (AE) {{generated from}} Kevlar 49 /epoxy composite pressure <b>vessels</b> <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> sustained load-to-failure tests were studied. Data {{from two different}} transducer locations on the vessels were compared. It was found that AE from vessel wall-mounted transducers showed a wide variance from those for identical <b>vessels</b> <b>subjected</b> <b>to</b> the same pressure loading. Emissions from boss-mounted transducers did, however, yield values that were relatively consistent. It appears that the signals from the boss-mounted transducers represent an integrated average of the emissions generated by fibers fracturing during the vessel tests. The AE from boss-mounted transducers were also independent of time for vessel failure. This suggests that a similar number of fiber fractures must occur prior to initiation of vessel failure. These studies indicate a potential for developing an AE test procedure for predicting the residual service life or integrity of composite vessels...|$|R
