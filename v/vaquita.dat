5|$|Because vaquitas are {{indigenous}} to the Gulf of California, Mexico is leading conservation efforts {{with the creation}} of the International Committee for the Recovery of the <b>Vaquita</b> (CIRVA), which has tried to prevent the accidental deaths of vaquitas by outlawing the use of fishing nets within the vaquita's habitat. CIRVA has worked together with the CITES, the Endangered Species Act, and the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) to nurse the <b>vaquita</b> population back to a point at which they can sustain themselves. CIRVA concluded in 2000 that between 39 and 84 individuals are killed each year by such gillnets. In order to try to prevent extinction, the Mexican government has created a nature reserve covering {{the upper part of the}} Gulf of California and the Colorado River delta. They have also placed a temporary ban on fishing, with compensation to those affected, that may pose a threat to the <b>vaquita.</b>|$|E
5|$|Porpoises {{are highly}} {{affected}} by bycatch. Many porpoises, mainly the <b>vaquita,</b> {{are subject to}} great mortality due to gillnetting. Although it is the world's most endangered marine cetacean, the <b>vaquita</b> continues {{to be caught in}} small-mesh gillnet fisheries throughout much of its range. Incidental mortality caused by the fleet of El Golfo de Santa Clara was estimated to be at around 39 vaquitas per year, which is over 17% of the population size. Harbour porpoises also suffer drowning by gillnetting, but on a less threatening scale due to their high population; their mortality rate per year increases a mere 5% due to this.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the diets of other species of porpoises. A {{dissection}} of three Burmeister's porpoises shows that they consume shrimp and euphausiids. A dissection of a beached <b>Vaquita</b> showed remains of squid and grunts. Nothing {{is known about}} the diet of the spectacled porpoise.|$|E
50|$|Little {{is known}} about the life cycle of <b>vaquitas.</b> Age at sexual maturity, longevity, {{reproductive}} cycle and population dynamics estimates have been made, but further research is needed. Most of these estimates come from <b>vaquitas</b> that have been stranded or caught in nets. Some are based on other porpoise species similar to <b>vaquitas.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Vaquitas</b> use high-pitched {{sounds to}} {{communicate}} with one another and for echolocation to navigate through their habitats. They generally feed and swim at a leisurely pace. <b>Vaquitas</b> avoid boats and are very evasive. They rise to breathe with a slow, forward motion and then disappear quickly. This lack of activity at the surface makes them difficult to observe. <b>Vaquitas</b> are usually alone unless they are accompanied by a calf, meaning they are less social than other porpoise species. They may also be more competitive during mating season. They are the only species belonging to the porpoise family that live in warm waters. <b>Vaquitas</b> are non-selective predators.|$|R
50|$|The {{proposal}} for a captive breeding program must contend with the general greater difficulty of keeping porpoises in captivity relative to dolphins, due to porpoises' sensitivity to disturbance and stress. Success in keeping captive porpoises has only been attained in recent years. The scheme {{involves the use of}} trained dolphins of the U.S. Navy to locate the <b>vaquitas,</b> along with aircraft and a spotter vessel with an observation tower. <b>Vaquitas</b> would be captured with a light salmon gillnet. Some of these <b>vaquitas</b> might be satellite-tagged and released for research purposes, while others would be kept captive. The latter <b>vaquitas</b> would be transferred to sea pens along the shore of the gulf, with large pools on land also available for special care if needed. Once success was attained in the campaign to eliminate the threat of gillnets, captive <b>vaquitas</b> could then be released back into the wild.|$|R
5|$|Porpoises were, {{and still}} are, hunted by some {{countries}} {{by means of}} drive hunting. Some species are attributed {{with high levels of}} intelligence. At the 2012 meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, support was reiterated for a cetacean bill of rights that would list cetaceans as non-human persons. The <b>vaquita</b> nearly became extinct in the twentieth century, with a predicted population of fewer than 100 individuals, and, since the extinction of the baiji, is considered the most endangered cetacean. Besides drive hunting, they also face threats from bycatch, competition (from humans), and marine pollution. Porpoises are sometimes kept in captivity and trained to perform tricks, but breeding success has been poor.|$|E
5|$|The Colorado River and {{its tributaries}} often nourish {{extensive}} corridors of riparian growth as they traverse the arid desert regions of the watershed. Although riparian zones represent a relatively small proportion of the basin and {{have been affected by}} engineering projects and river diversion in many places, they have the greatest biodiversity of any habitat in the basin. The most prominent riparian zones along the river occur along the lower Colorado below Davis Dam, especially in the Colorado River Delta, where riparian areas support 358 species of birds despite the reduction in freshwater flow and invasive plants such as tamarisk (salt cedar). Reduction of the delta's size has also threatened animals such as jaguars and the <b>vaquita</b> porpoise, which is endemic to the gulf. Human development of the Colorado River has also helped to create new riparian zones by smoothing the river's seasonal flow, notably through the Grand Canyon.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{organisation}} {{are dedicated}} to protecting certain species that do not fall under any international treaty, such as the Committee for the Recovery of the <b>Vaquita,</b> and the Wuhan Institute of Hydrobiology (for the Yangtze finless porpoise).|$|E
2500|$|Vaquita#Recovery efforts, US Navy {{dolphins}} {{are being}} deployed {{to locate the}} remaining <b>vaquitas</b> for captive breeding ...|$|R
50|$|Like other Phocoena, <b>vaquitas</b> {{are usually}} seen singly. If {{they are seen}} together, it is usually in small groups {{of two or three}} individuals. Less often, groups around ten have been observed, with the most ever seen at once being 40 individuals.|$|R
50|$|<b>Vaquitas</b> {{have never}} been hunted directly, but their {{population}} is declining, largely because of animals becoming trapped in illegal gillnets intended for capturing the totoaba, a large critically endangered fish of the drum family endemic to the Gulf. A trade in totoaba swim bladders has arisen, driven by demand from China (where they are used in soup, being considered a delicacy and also erroneously thought to have medicinal value), which is greatly exacerbating the problem.|$|R
25|$|The <b>vaquita</b> (Phocoena sinus) {{is highly}} {{endangered}} and is endemic {{to the upper}} Gulf of California, Mexico. They are killed in both gillnets and trawl nets from commercial and artisanal fishing. There are presently less than 100 vaquitas left in the Gulf of California.|$|E
25|$|Toothed whales {{consist of}} some of the most {{widespread}} mammals, but some, as with the <b>vaquita,</b> are restricted to certain areas. Odontocetes feed largely on fish and squid, but a few, like the killer whale, feed on mammals, such as pinnipeds. Males typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate every two to three years, making them polygynous. Calves are typically born in the spring and summer, and females bear the responsibility for raising them, but more sociable species rely on the family group to care for calves. Many species, mainly dolphins, are highly sociable, with some pods reaching over a thousand individuals.|$|E
500|$|Porpoises have a bulbous head, no {{external}} ear flaps, a non-flexible neck, a torpedo shaped body, limbs modified into flippers, and a tail fin. Their skull has small eye orbits, small, blunt snouts, and eyes {{placed on the}} sides of the head. Porpoises range in size from the [...] and [...] <b>Vaquita</b> to the [...] and [...] Dall's porpoise. Overall, they tend to be dwarfed by other cetaceans. Almost all species have female-biased sexual dimorphism, with the females being larger than the males, although those physical differences are generally small; one exception is Dall's porpoise.|$|E
50|$|By November 2016, {{according}} to a report released in February 2017, the population had declined to about 30, and it was judged that capture of some of the remaining <b>vaquitas</b> and conducting a captive breeding program within a secure sanctuary was the only remaining hope for survival. This is despite the fact that porpoises generally fare poorly in captivity. However, the head of the Mexican environmental agency asserted in July 2017 that at least 100 individuals remain.|$|R
50|$|<b>Vaquitas</b> are {{estimated}} to live about 20 years in ideal conditions. They mature sexually at 1.3 m long, as early as 3 years old, but more likely at 6. Reproduction occurs during late spring or early summer. Their gestation period is between 10 and 11 months. They have seasonal reproduction, and usually have one calf in March. The inter-birth period, or elapsed time between offspring birth, is between 1 and 2 years. The young are then nursed for about 6 to 8 months until {{they are capable of}} fending for themselves.|$|R
50|$|Another new {{initiative}} was minimúsica. La Colazione introduced this concept {{in which the}} independent bands from Barcelona offered concerts for the little ones in the festival’s free kindergarten. Two series of performances were held during the afternoon, with live music by Coconot, Las Dolores, Internet 2, Brielah, Sedaiós, Decibelios Joe, Tarántula, Los Carradine, Manos de Topo, Las <b>Vaquitas</b> (David from Beef + Joe Crepúsculo -Tarántula-), Albaialeix and First Aid Kit. During the festival, Myspace Spain celebrated their beginning at the Forum with some acoustic concerts, on the 1st and 2 June in a stand located in the Record Fair. Some of the bands that played the “Myspace Salon” were: Maximo Park & Grizzly Bear, Fernando Alfaro y los Alienistas, Grupo de Expertos Sol y Nieve, The Secret Society, Bonde do Role, Standstill, Mum, Alondra Bentley or Sr. Chinarro.|$|R
500|$|Porpoises {{range in}} size from the [...] and [...] <b>vaquita,</b> the {{smallest}} cetacean to be discovered, to the [...] and [...] Dall's porpoise.

Some species are well adapted for diving to great depths. They have a layer of fat, or blubber, under the skin to keep them warm in cold water.|$|E
500|$|Cetaceans – whales, {{dolphins}} and porpoises – are placental marine mammals. All modern {{members of}} the infraorder are fully aquatic {{and live in the}} open ocean (except a few species of dolphin which inhabit rivers and estuaries). Cetaceans mate, give birth, suckle their young, and feed exclusively underwater. They range in size from the [...] and [...] <b>vaquita</b> to the [...] and [...] blue whale, which is also the largest creature that has ever existed. Fourteen families, 39 genera, and 88 species of cetaceans are recognised by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Of the 88 species, the IUCN classifies three as Critically Endangered, seven as Endangered, six as Vulnerable, five as Near Threatened, twenty two as Least Concern, and 45 as Data Deficient.|$|E

2500|$|Toothed whales {{range in}} size from the [...] and [...] <b>vaquita</b> to the [...] and [...] sperm whale. Several species of odontocetes exhibit sexual dimorphism, in that the females are larger than males. They have {{streamlined}} bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers. Some can travel at up to 20 knots. Odontocetes have conical teeth designed for catching fish or squid. They have well-developed hearing, that is well adapted for both air and water, so much so that some can survive even if they are blind. Some species are well adapted for diving to great depths. Almost all have a layer of fat, or blubber, under the skin to keep warm in the cold water, with the exception of river dolphins.|$|E
50|$|Sharks {{have been}} {{determined}} {{to be the only}} predators of vaquitas. Because of its limited number of predator species, the <b>vaquita</b> population is sensitive to small changes in predation from sharks. Although the <b>vaquita</b> accounts for {{only a small percentage of}} the diets of sharks in the region, extinction of the <b>vaquita</b> could potentially cause negative effects on shark population sizes. Extinction of the <b>vaquita</b> may also impact the <b>vaquita</b> prey populations in the northern Gulf ecosystem. The disappearance of the <b>vaquita</b> could lead to potential over-population of their prey species such as benthic fishes, squid, and crustaceans.|$|E
50|$|Conservation {{efforts for}} the <b>vaquita</b> are mainly focused on fishing {{restrictions}} {{to prevent their}} bycatch. These fishing restrictions could prove beneficial for {{the fish in the}} upper Gulf, as well as the <b>vaquita.</b> As a result of increased restrictions on gillnet use, the populations of the targeted fish and shrimp species will receive protection from overfishing. Historically, numerous commercially fished species have experienced devastating impacts due to overfishing, and the <b>vaquita</b> conservation program may lessen the severity of such devastation in the future. Another solution to prevent <b>vaquita</b> bycatch might be to redesign fishing nets, which could be used to effectively catch fish, but leave the <b>vaquita</b> untouched.|$|E
5000|$|... the <b>vaquita</b> porpoise, the world's {{smallest}} marine cetacean, {{listed as}} a species of special concern by the U.S. Marine Mammal Commission. There {{are thought to be}} less than 250 <b>vaquita</b> left in the world.|$|E
50|$|The vanity {{price of}} a {{vanishing}} kind of maw is behind the imminent extinction of the <b>vaquita,</b> the world's smallest dolphin breed. Only found in Mexico's Gulf of California, the once numerous <b>vaquita</b> now number less than 60 in total. <b>Vaquita</b> die in gillnets set to catch totoaba (the world's largest drum fish). Totoaba are being hunted to extinction for its maw, which can sell for as much $10,000 per kilogram.|$|E
50|$|Studies {{performed}} in El Golfo de Santa Clara, {{one of the}} three major ports in which vaquitas live, indicated that gillnet fishing causes about 39 <b>vaquita</b> deaths a year. This is close to 17% of the whole <b>vaquita</b> population within this port. While these results were not taken from the entire range of habitat in which vaquitas live, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that these results can be applied to the whole <b>vaquita</b> population, and in fact may even be a little low. Even with a gillnet ban throughout the <b>vaquita</b> refuge area, which contains 50% of the vaquita's habitat, the population is still in decline, which suggests a complete ban of gillnet use may be the only solution to saving the <b>vaquita</b> population. However, even in the face of all-encompassing gillnet bans, a significant number of Mexican fishermen in El Golfo de Santa Clara continue to use the nets. As many as a third of the area's fishermen are believed to still be using gillnets despite the imposition of bans on their use. Trawl nets commonly used to catch shrimp in the area may also present threats due to their impacts on the Gulf's ecosystem, either directly through bycatch or by indirectly altering the seafloor and associated species (including <b>vaquita</b> prey).|$|E
50|$|On 16 April 2015, Enrique Peña Nieto the President of Mexico {{announced}} {{a program of}} rescue and conservation of the <b>vaquita</b> and the totoaba, including closures and financial support to fishermen in the area. Some commentators believe the measures fall short of {{what is needed to}} save the <b>vaquita.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The <b>vaquita</b> ( [...] ; Phocoena sinus) is a {{rare species}} of {{porpoise}} endemic to {{the northern part of}} the Gulf of California. The word <b>vaquita</b> is Spanish for [...] "little cow". Other names include cochito (Spanish for [...] "little car"), desert porpoise, <b>vaquita</b> porpoise, Gulf of California harbor porpoise, Gulf of California porpoise, and gulf porpoise. Since the baiji (Lipotes vexillifer) is believed to have gone extinct in 2006, the <b>vaquita</b> has taken on the title of the most endangered cetacean in the world. It has been listed as critically endangered since 1996. The population was estimated at 600 in 1997, below 100 in 2014, approximately 60 in 2015 and approximately 30 in November 2016, leading to the conclusion that the species will soon be extinct unless drastic action is taken.|$|E

50|$|Removal of the <b>vaquita</b> {{will have}} a {{significant}} ecological impact on the northern Gulf of California. The Gulf of California is considered a large marine ecosystem, due to its high species diversity and large habitat size.

The <b>vaquita</b> is an evolutionarily distinct animal and has no close relatives. These animals represent more, proportionally, of the tree of life than other species, meaning they are top priority for conservation campaigns. The EDGE of Existence Programme is a conservation effort that attempts to help conserve endangered animals that represent large portions of their evolutionary trees. The U.S. government has listed the <b>vaquita</b> as endangered under the Endangered Species Act. It is also listed by the IUCN and the CITES in the category at most critical risk of extinction.|$|E
