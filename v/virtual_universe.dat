Lee (graphics and programming), and Bob Gonsalves (sound). Then-vice president of Electronic Arts Joe Ybarra was also closely involved, and produced the work. [...] The original idea for making a video game was conceived by McConnell and Ybarra in 1983. [...] McConnell hired colleague Dave Boulton, who had an idea for using fractals to generate an endless <b>virtual</b> <b>universe,</b> along with Kercso, Gonsalves, Lee, and Johnson, {{all of whom were}} first time game designers. [...] Boulton quit the project early on in development, saying it was too ambitious, with Lee replacing him.|$|E

2500|$|Questions {{regarding}} the multiplayer aspects of No Man's Sky were raised a day following the official release on the PlayStation 4. Two players attempted {{to meet up}} at the same location in the game's <b>virtual</b> <b>universe</b> after one player recognised the other by their username associated with a planetary discovery. Despite confirming they had been at the same spot on the same planet outside of the game through their respective Twitch.tv streams, they could not see each other. Furthering this was the discovery that European copies of the limited edition packaging used a sticker to cover the PEGI online play icon. Journalists noted a number of potential reasons why the players may not have encountered each other, including the users being on separate instances or server problems reported by Hello Games at launch, though some opined that this may have been a feature removed before launch. Hello Games noted that they have had [...] "far more" [...] players than they expected at launch and are bringing on more people to help support the game along with patching the critical issues at the game's launch, but they have not made a direct statement on the multiplayer situation [...]|$|E

5000|$|In {{his last}} book, Chaosmosis (1992), Guattari {{returned}} {{to the question of}} subjectivity: [...] "How to produce it, collect it, enrich it, reinvent it permanently {{in order to make it}} compatible with mutant Universes of value?" [...] This concern runs through all of his works, from Psychoanalysis and Transversality (a collection of articles from 1957 to 1972), through Years of Winter (1980-1986) and Schizoanalytic Cartographies (1989), to his collaboration with Deleuze, What is Philosophy? (1991). In Chaosmosis, Guattari proposes an analysis of subjectivity in terms of four dimensions: (1) material, energetic, and semiotic fluxes; (2) concrete and abstract machinic phylums; (3) <b>virtual</b> <b>universes</b> of value; and (4) finite existential territories. This scheme attempts to grasp the heterogeneity of components involved in the production of subjectivity, as Guattari understands it, which include both signifying semiotic components as well as [...] "a-signifying semiological dimensions" [...] (which work [...] "in parallel or independently of" [...] any signifiying function that they may have).|$|R

We are interested in technical objects {{with a lot of}} constraints during the interactions.

Finally we explain how we take into account the need to make the users aware of other users interactions within collaborative <b>virtual</b> <b>universes.</b> Nous présentons ici les mécanismes que nous implémentons au-dessus de la plate-forme Open- MASK dans le but de faciliter l'interaction dans les mondes virtuels 3 D, en particulier lorsqu'ils sont peuplés d'objets à forte composante technique, c'est-à-dire imposant de fortes contraintes lors des interactions 3 D.

40|$|How {{does the}} algorithmically {{mediated}} environment of social media restructure social action? This article combines social movement studies {{and science and}} technology studies to explore the role of social media in the organization, unfolding, and diffusion of contemporary protests. In particular, it examines how activists leverage the technical properties of social media to develop a joint narrative and a collective identity. To this end, it offers the notion of cloud protesting as a theoretical approach and framework for empirical analysis. Cloud protesting indicates {{a specific type of}} mobilization that is grounded on, modeled around, and enabled by social media platforms and mobile devices and the <b>virtual</b> <b>universes</b> they identify. The notion emphasizes both the productive mediation of social and mobile media and the importance of activists’ sense-making activities. It also acknowledges that social media set in motion a process that is sociotechnical in nature rather than merely sociological or communicative, and thus can be understood only by intersecting the material and the symbolic dimensions of contemporary digitally mediated collective action. The article shows how the specific materiality of social media intervenes in the actors’ meaning work by fostering four mechanisms—namely performance, interpellation, temporality, and reproducibility—which concur to create a "politics of visibility" that alters traditional identity dynamics. In addition, it exposes the connection between organizational patterns and the role of individuals, explaining how the politics of visibility {{is the result of a}} process that originates and ends within the individual—which ultimately creates individuals-in-the-group rather than groups...|$|R

40|$|So why did polygons {{become the}} {{ubiquitous}} virtual bricks of videogames? Because, whatever the interesting or eccentric devices {{that had been}} thrown up along the way, videogames, as with the strain of Western art from the Renaissance up until the shock of photography, were hell-bent on refining their powers of illusionistic deception. —Stephen Poole (2000, page 125). Illusion refining, indeed, {{appears to be a}} major driving force of video game evolution. The appeal of ever-more realistic depictions of <b>virtual</b> <b>universes</b> in itself justifies the purchase of expensive new machinery, be it the latest console or dedicated computer parts. Yet, one must not conceive of this evolution as a linear progression towards perfect verisimilitude. The relative quality of static and dynamic renders, associated {{with a wide range of}} imaging techniques more or less suited to the capabilities of any given video game system, demonstrate the unsteady evolution of visual representation in the short history of the medium. Moreover, older techniques are sometimes integrated in the latest 3 -D games, and 2 -D gaming still enjoys a very strong following with portable game systems. Despite its short history, a detailed account of the apparatus behind the illusion would already require many volumes in itself. In this chapter, we will examine only the fundamentals of the different imaging techniques along with key examples. However, we hope to go further than a simple historical account of illusion refining, and expose the different ideals that governed and still governs the evolution of visual design in games. In video games, visual representation started from scratch again; a few shapes, a fe...|$|R

50|$|Dawkins {{discusses}} how {{the image}} on the retina is upside-down and in two dimensions but the overlapping images from each of the eyes are composited to form a three-dimensional model in the brain.

He then describes how using his finger to wriggle his eyeball that the outside world appears to move because he is moving {{the image on}} his retina. However this does not happen when he voluntary rolls his eyes from side to side. This is due to the brain using the internal model to compensate for the relative change in position of images on the retina.
