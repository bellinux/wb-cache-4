They were later pumped down shortly before beam circulation. Meanwhile, 2. 3 km of vacuum beam pipes with NEG coatings were vented to air to allow the installation or repair of several components such as roman pot, magnets kicker, collimators, rupture disks and masks and reactivated thereafter.

Calves raised for 'white' veal are {{generally}} fed a milk-like diet from birth until they are slaughtered at about four months of age. The calves are prevented from consuming roughage such as grass or hay partly because the iron contained in such plant-based food would cause their muscles to assume a normal reddish colour instead of the pale colour that purchasers of this product demand. The diet, however, is unnatural because calves would normally start to forage and ruminate from about two weeks of age. When limited to a milky diet, some calves will spend hours per day in {{what appears to be}} 'vacuum grazing'.

In addition new cleaning procedures were implemented and equipment adjacent to the injection kickers and various vacuum components were modified.

40|$|Male African {{cichlids}} (Oreochromis mossambicus) establish territories on {{the substrate}} upon which spawning pits are dug, thus attracting females. The substrate, therefore, plays {{a very significant}} role in its lifecycle. The effects of substrate access on behaviour and physiology in captivity were assessed. Mixed-sex, all-male and all-female groups were observed for five days, with and without substrate. Social patterns, behaviour directed towards the substrate, locomotor activity and spatial behaviour were recorded, and haematocrit, plasma cortisol and glucose levels were measured. Substrate inclusion saw {{a significant increase in}} behavioural diversity, sexual behaviour of dominant males in mixed groups, pit digging and territoriality whereas a lack of substrate was characterised by increased chafing and inactivity. Vacuum-pit digging was also observed. Frequency of aggression did not differ significantly and female behaviour was not affected by the presence of substrate. For both sexes, no differences in cortisol and glucose levels were found between the two treatments, but haematocrit increased with substrate. The key role played by substrate in territorial males is consistent with the behavioural and physiological data reported. In the absence of substrate, decreased territorial behaviour is contrasted with similar levels of aggression, cortisol and glucose; all of which are suggestive of a stress-related context. Moreover, the exhibition of <b>vacuum</b> <b>activities</b> is a signal that behavioural needs are not being met and may be some form of coping mechanism. These findings, taken in conjunction with the variations in behavioural diversity and inactivity, suggest that the welfare of male cichlids may be adversely affected by the absence of substrate...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The <b>vacuum</b> <b>activity</b> {{generated}} by the curvature of the Schwarzschild black-hole geometry close to the event horizon is studied for {{the case of a}} massless, conformal scalar field. The associated approximation to the unknown, exact propagator in the Hartle-Hawking vacuum state for small values of the radial coordinate above r = 2 M results in an analytic expression which manifestly features its dependence on the background space-time geometry. This approximation to the Hartle-Hawking scalar propagator on the Schwarzschild black-hole geometry is, for that matter, distinct from all other. It is shown that the stated approximation is valid for physical distances which range from the event horizon to values which are orders of magnitude above the scale within which quantum and backreaction effects are comparatively pronounced. An expression is obtained for the renormalised in the Hartle-Hawking vacuum state which reproduces the established results on the event horizon and in that segment of the exterior geometry within which the approximation is valid.

Do not ask me to give a definition of play. There is a good excuse for naively using a word of common parlance even if one cannot give an exact definition of the concept corresponding to it: very usually there is a real natural unit corresponding to a concept for which the natural growth of common language has developed a word. So let us use the word «play » just as every man in the street would use it naively when talking of the play of kittens or even little children. Whenever we observed higher mammals at play, puppies «playing at » fighting each other, kittens «stalking a ball of wool » or kids gamboling on the grass {{there is no doubt about}} the playful motive of these activities although the motor patterns observed are actually very similar to certain instinctive movements which may be used in deadly contest.

Sclerocarya birrea and Harpephyllum caffrum (Anacardiaceae) are traditionally used to treat numerous ailments increasing their susceptibility to overexploitation. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the medicinal efficacy of renewable aerial parts of the plants using in vitro assays, thus providing a conservation measure by plant part substitution. Plant samples were sequentially extracted with petroleum ether, dichloromethane and 80 % ethanol, sonicated on ice and concentrated under <b>vacuum.</b> Antimicrobial <b>activities</b> were determined by the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) using the micro-dilution assay. The ability of extracts to inhibit COX- 1 and COX- 2 enzymes was used to evaluate anti-inflammatory activity. Ethanolic extracts of S. birrea and H. caffrum exhibited high antibacterial activity (MIC < 1. 0 mg/ml). S. birrea twig extract was the most active with a total activity of 1609. 1 ml/g against Bacillus subtilis and an MIC of 0. 098 mg/ml. Petroleum ether and dichloromethane extracts exhibited high COX- 1 (90. 7 – 99. 8 %) and COX- 2 (69 – 92. 6 %) enzyme inhibition at a concentration of 250 μg/ml. The extracts of S. birrea and H. caffrum exhibited high antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties.

40|$|The gill {{cleaning}} movements ofLimulus {{occur in}} definite periods (bouts). The sequence of movements in a bout, and the movements themselves, are highly stereotyped. In {{a bout of}} gill cleaning the paired gill plates are adducted across the midline so that opposite gill plates can interact. The interaction consists of rhythmic flicking of the inner lobe of a gill plate between the book gill lamellae of the contralateral gill. Each bout of cleaning lasts for approximately one minute and {{can be divided into}} four basic phases: pairing, crossing over, lateral cleaning, and medial cleaning (Fig. 2). There are two distinct pairing arrangements of the gill plates during cleaning. During left leading (LL) cleaning all the gill plates are paired with an adjacent gill plate, except L 1 and R 5. During right leading (RL) cleaning, which is the mirror image of LL cleaning, all the gills are paired except for R 1 and L 5 (Fig. 3). Cleaning bouts are further organized into long-term patterns which last for hours (Fig. 4). There are four major muscle groups involved in gill cleaning. Muscles 48 / 115 adduct the gill plate across the midline; muscles 113 / 114 flick the inner lobe, and muscles 20 (remotor) and 22 (promotor) control the anterior-posterior position of the gill plate during cleaning. The patterns of activity of these muscles are reliably different during RL and LL cleaning (Fig. 5). Each abdominal ganglion controls the movements of a pair of gill plates. During a bout of cleaning one member of the pair is being cleaned (subprogram A) and the other is not being cleaned (subprogram B). It is suggested that there are higher-order interganglionic neurons which control the expression of either the RL or LL patterns of cleaning. This is accomplished by dictating which gill plate of a pair uses subprogram A and which subprogram B, for all five ganglia. It is concluded that a gill cleaning bout constitutes a moderately complex fixed action pattern, meeting the criteria of stereotypy within and between animals, intricacy of appendage movements, involvement of more than one effector system, and tendency to occur in its entirety in the absence of apparent stimuli (<b>vacuum</b> <b>activity)</b> ...|$|E
40|$|How an animal’s {{behavioural}} (ethological) needs {{can be met}} is {{a pivotal}} issue {{in the assessment of}} welfare for captive animals. The value of swimming water for farmed mink is an example how scientific and societal questions relating to animal welfare can be answered. A number of studies have addressed the issue of the indispensability of swimming water for mink; however, so far with inconclusive evidence. In this paper, the results of these studies and related literature are reviewed. First, the biological definition of need is discussed. Subsequently, attention is paid to the effects of the presence, absence and the removal of swimming water on behavioural and physiological correlates of well-being including stereotypic and anticipatory behaviour and urinary cortisol. Thereafter we discuss individual differences in the use of swimming water, the price animals pay for access to a water bath, and the effect of access to swimming water on juvenile play. 	The main conclusions of the literature review are that 1) the use of a water bath for mink is most likely related to foraging behaviour (foraging areas: land and water); 2) absence of swimming water, without prior experience, does not lead to consistent changes in level of stereotypic behaviour, or anticipatory responses; 3) removal of a previously experienced water bath may induce short-term stress as indicated by behavioural parameters and elevated cortisol responses; 4) mink work hard for access to a swimming bath and running wheel in consumer demand studies. Other cage modifications such as tunnels and biting objects, may also provide environmental enrichment, if they are added to otherwise impoverished conditions; 5) There are individual differences in the use of swimming water: these are related in part to variation in prior experience of aquatic resources.; 6) As prior experience is important both with respect to individual use of swimming water and the response to deprivation, swimming water can not be described as biological need {{in the sense of a}} fixed requirement for survival. As swimming water appears to act as an incentive that induces its own motivation a more accurate term may be an “incentive induced or environmentally facilitated need”. Given the available evidence, it is not possible to conclude whether mink that have never experienced swimming water, suffer as a consequence of its absence. However, it is possible to predict that mink with access to water have improved quality of life, due to increased behavioural opportunities, in comparison to farmed mink without access to swimming water. In practical terms, it is still open to debate whether mink should be provided with swimming water, or if alternative, less valued, but easier to install and maintain forms of environmental enrichment, should be provided in mink housing. To clarify these issues a number of future studies would be valuable. These include; 1) whether specific environmental cues affect motivation to swim, such as the form of drinking water delivery systems; 2) whether prior experience of swimming water affects its incentive value; in other words “can you miss what you never experienced?”; 3) do behavioural parameters such as stereotypic behaviour; rebound effects and <b>vacuum</b> <b>activity</b> have any general utility in assessing the value of absent resources; 4) what are preferences for and the value of alternative resources which may act as substitutes for swimming water. In addition we would recommend further work investigating: relationship between access to swimming water and positive indicators of welfare such as play and/or anticipatory behaviour; the effects of preventing the performance of rewarding behaviours and deprivation of a previous experienced resource; and health and hygeine issues related to provision of a water bath. In future work, it would be desirable to present be the actual percentages of animals using a water bath during the experiment and the use of power analyses, to aid their interpretation...|$|E

5000|$|The first ion pump {{was invented}} by Varian Associates, now Agilent. The {{original}} activity of Varian, co-founded in 1948 by Russell Varian, {{the inventor of the}} Klystron, and his brother Sigurd, was in the field of microwave electron tubes. Robert Jepsen joined the company in 1951 and soon became director of the Klystron research group. His investigation about electronic vacuum pumping led in 1957 to the realization of the first sputter ion pump (SIP), later named VacIon pump, of which he was co-inventor.The pump was developed as an appendage pump for maintaining Ultra High Vacuum (UHV) in microwave power tubes after processing, but soon after honeycomb-shaped anodes and commercial VacIon pumps with speeds of thousands of liters per second were produced. Lewis Hall and John Helmer were members of the research team, involved in the choice of the most suitable cathode material and in the optimization of the ion pump design. Sherm Rutherford joined Varian in February 1959 in the Central Research Department (which, soon after, spun off the <b>Vacuum</b> Division). His <b>activity,</b> working for Robert Jepsen, was to study the behavior of the sputter ion pump (in terms of pumping speed and discharge intensity I/P) over a wide range of parameters, such as magnetic field, voltage, anode cell diameter, anode cell length and pressure. Renn Zaphiropoulos joined the Vacuum Division in 1959 and was engaged in scaling up the ion pump from the original appendage pump to a full range of large pumps up to 5000 l/s [...] His group worked on high voltage feedthroughs, magnets, control units, systems, flanges, valves, sorption pumps and Titanium Sublimation Pumps (TSP). In 1960 the “slotted” titanium cathode, named “Super VacIon Pump”, was introduced on the basis of observations about noble gas pumping mechanism and unstable Argon pumping phenomena. In the same years triode pumps were invented by W.M. Brubaker (Consolidated Electrodynamics Corporation) and Varian, now Agilent, began to sell them in the late ‘60s under the name “Noble Ion Pumps”, then changed the name to “Triode Ion Pumps” in the early ‘70s.|$|R
