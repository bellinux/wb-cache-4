2500|$|According to the Business Insider Intelligence Survey {{conducted}} {{in the last quarter}} of 2014, 39% of the respondents said that security is the biggest concern in adopting Internet of things technology. In particular, as the Internet of things spreads widely, cyber attacks are likely to become an increasingly physical (rather than simply virtual) threat. In a January 2014 article in Forbes, cyber-security columnist Joseph Steinberg listed many Internet-connected appliances that can already [...] "spy on people in their own homes" [...] including televisions, kitchen appliances, cameras, and thermostats. Computer-controlled devices in automobiles such as brakes, engine, locks, hood and trunk releases, horn, heat, and dashboard have been shown to be vulnerable to attackers who have access to the on-board network. In some cases, <b>vehicle</b> <b>computer</b> systems are Internet-connected, allowing them to be exploited remotely. By 2008 security researchers had shown the ability to remotely control pacemakers without authority. Later hackers demonstrated remote control of insulin pumps and implantable cardioverter defibrillators. David Pogue wrote that some recently published reports about hackers remotely controlling certain functions of automobiles were not as serious as one might otherwise guess because of various mitigating circumstances; such as the bug that allowed the hack having been fixed before the report was published, or that the hack required security researchers having physical access to the car prior to the hack to prepare for it.|$|E

Since the vehicle is bi-directional, one of the two on-board computers has to be suspended when driving to prevent accidental point switching.|$|E
50|$|Although four {{satellites}} {{are required}} for normal operation, fewer apply in special cases. If one variable is already known, a receiver can determine its position using only three satellites. For example, a ship or aircraft may have known elevation. Some GPS receivers may use additional clues or assumptions such as reusing the last known altitude, dead reckoning, inertial navigation, or including information from the <b>vehicle</b> <b>computer,</b> to give a (possibly degraded) position when fewer than four satellites are visible.|$|E
50|$|In recent years, {{alternator}} {{regulators are}} linked to the <b>vehicle's</b> <b>computer</b> system and various factors including air temperature obtained from the intake air temperature sensor, battery temperature sensor and engine load are evaluated in adjusting the voltage supplied by the alternator.|$|R
50|$|Active Body Control was {{designed}} to control the vehicle's stability {{through a combination of}} active springs and hydraulics at each wheel, plus sensors that monitor the vehicle’s movements. The <b>vehicle's</b> <b>computer</b> assesses the information from the sensors and adjusts the suspension accordingly.|$|R
50|$|In a dry nitrous system, extra fuel {{required}} is introduced through the fuel injectors, keeping the manifold dry of fuel. This property {{is what gives}} the dry system its name. Fuel flow can be increased either by increasing the pressure in the fuel injection system, or by modifying the <b>vehicle's</b> <b>computer</b> to increase the time the fuel injectors remain open during the engine cycle. This is typically done by spraying nitrous past the mass airflow sensor (MAF), which then sends {{a signal to the}} <b>vehicle's</b> <b>computer</b> telling it that it sees colder denser air, and that more fuel is needed. This is typically not an exact method of adding fuel. Once additional fuel has been introduced, it can burn with the extra oxygen provided by the nitrous, providing additional power.|$|R

50|$|Drive Cycle Recognition (abbr. DCR) is an {{advanced}} vehicle control strategy that uses past driving information, {{as well as}} a library of representative drive cycles to extrapolate future vehicle control parameters. For example, the <b>vehicle</b> <b>computer</b> can identify past driving history as one particular representative cycle (say, FTP-75) and use known information from FTP-75 to improve vehicle performance. This type of control strategy is most useful for hybrid vehicles where the control strategy has a much greater effect on vehicle performance than with a regular internal combustion engine driven vehicle.|$|E
5000|$|For 2000, {{the final}} edition of this Laguna, the Laguna Concorde, was introduced. It {{included}} semi-leather seats, and vocal warnings like [...] "Welcome.

The on-board computer would notify {{the driver of}} any doors not being closed, lights left on etc., weather ("Please brake carefully the road is watery") or other faults in the electrical or mechanical circuits. The onboard voice synthesizer warnings system was also available on the earlier 1998 RXE and V6 models. This is the same basic unit as used in the Renault Safrane.|$|E
50|$|The car {{also uses}} Volvo's Intelligent Driver Information System (IDIS) which {{continuously}} monitors the car's preemptive {{systems such as}} steering wheel angle, pedal depressions, and overall factors that help the <b>vehicle's</b> <b>computer</b> to decide if the driver is busy or distracted merging or turning, and will then accordingly delay certain data or alerts that are unimportant.|$|R

50|$|The team is {{subdivided}} into five major groups to handle necessary tasks. The Mechanical and Drivetrain groups work {{to design and}} implement new components, renovate old parts, and perform general vehicle maintenance. The Control and Electrical Groups are responsible for maintaining all of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>computer</b> and electrical components; this includes developing a complex control strategy and programing the electronic control unit, rewiring the vehicle to accommodate the hybrid systems, and maintaining the battery pack {{as well as other}} electrically sensitive components. The Outreach group is responsible for publishing newsletters, maintaining the website, obtaining positive relationships with local businesses and community, and involving the team in community events.Each group is led by a veteran team member who meet to coordinate projects and make decisions for the vehicle's progress.

50|$|An {{electronic}} limited-slip differential will {{typically have}} a planetary or bevel gear set {{similar to that}} of an open differential and a clutch pack similar to that in a torque sensitive or gerotor pump based differential. In the electronic unit the clamping force on the clutch is controlled externally by a computer or other controller. This allows the control of the differential’s limiting torque, Trq d , to be controlled as part of a total chassis management system. An example of this type of differential is Subaru’s DCCD used in the 2011 Subaru WRX STi. Another example is the Porsche PSD system used on the Porsche 928. A third example is the SAAB XWD (Haldex Generation 4) with eLSD, it uses a common (electronically controlled via the <b>vehicle</b> <b>computer</b> network) hydraulic power pack to control both the longitudinal and transversal torque transfer of the XWD system. The same Haldex system is used on several other GM Epsilon based vehicles such as the Cadillac SRX etc.|$|E
50|$|The opto devices, mounted {{around the}} {{circumference}} of the disk, provide signals that are phase-shifted relative {{to one another and}} thus allow the <b>vehicle</b> <b>computer</b> to determine the direction of rotation of the wheel. This is a legal requirement in Switzerland to prevent rollback when starting from standstill. Strictly, such devices are not tachometers since they do not provide a direct reading of the rotational speed of the disk. The speed has to be derived externally by counting the number of pulses in a time period. It is difficult to prove conclusively that the vehicle is stationary, other than by waiting a certain time to ensure that no further pulses occur. This is one reason why there is often a time delay between the train stopping, as perceived by a passenger, and the doors being released. Slotted-disk devices are typical sensors used in odometer systems for rail vehicles, such as are required for train protection systems — notably the European Train Control System.|$|E

50|$|The {{millimeter}} band {{radar system}} {{mounted on the}} turret is capable of operating as a Missile Approach Warning System (MAWS). The <b>vehicle's</b> <b>computer</b> in turn can triangulate incoming projectiles, immediately warn the vehicle crew and fire off Visual and Infrared Screening Smoke (VIRSS) grenades, which can effectively block optical, infrared and radar signatures. Once the hard-kill AMS is installed, the radar system will also be responsible for tracking and targeting the incoming missiles for the AMS.|$|R

If the on-board computer does not receive the correct identification code certain components, such as the fuel pump and on some the starter, will remain disabled.|$|R
40|$|Vehicles {{have been}} around in our society for over a century, until {{recently}} they have been standalone systems. With increased amounts of initiatives to inter-network vehicles to avoid accidents and reduce environmental impact the view of a vehicle as a standalone system needs to be reconsidered. Networking and cooperation between vehicles requires that all systems and the information therein are trustworthy. Faulty or malicious vehicle systems are thus not limited to only affecting a single vehicle but also the entire network. The detection of anomalous behavior in a <b>vehicle</b> <b>computer</b> system is therefore of importance. To improve the vehicle systems we strive to achieve security awareness within the <b>vehicle</b> <b>computer</b> system. As a first step we will identify threats toward the <b>vehicle</b> <b>computer</b> system and {{what has been done}} to address them. We perform a threat analysis consisting of fault trees and misuse cases to identify the threats. The fault trees provide away to connect the threats found with vehicle stakeholders' goals. The connection between stakeholder goals and threat highlights the need for threat mitigation. Several research initiatives are discussed to find out what has been done to address the identified threats and to find the state of the research for security in <b>vehicle</b> <b>computer</b> system. Lastly, an error model for the Controller Area Network (CAN) is proposed to model the consequences of threats applied to the CAN bus...|$|E
