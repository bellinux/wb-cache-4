Accordingly a young chap wearing his hat over the left eyebrow, some clerk I suppose,--there must have been clerks in the business, though the house was as still as a house in a city of the dead,--came from somewhere up-stairs, and led me forth. He was shabby and careless, with ink-stains on the sleeves of his jacket, and his cravat was large and billowy, under a chin shaped like the toe of an old boot. It was a little too early for the doctor, so I {{proposed}} a drink, and thereupon he developed a vein of joviality. As we sat over our <b>vermouths</b> he glorified the Company's business, and by-and-by I expressed casually my surprise at him not going out there. He became very cool and collected all at once. 'I am not such a fool as I look, quoth Plato to his disciples,' he said sententiously, emptied his glass with great resolution, and we rose.|$|E
50|$|Sweet <b>vermouths</b> usually contain 10-15% sugar. The {{sugar content}} in dry <b>vermouths</b> {{generally}} does not exceed 4%. Dry <b>vermouths</b> usually are lighter in body than sweet <b>vermouths.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "Italian vermouth" [...] {{is often}} used to refer to red-colored, mildly bitter, and {{slightly}} sweet <b>vermouths.</b> These types of <b>vermouths</b> have also been called [...] "rosso." [...] The label [...] "French vermouth" [...] generally refers to pale, dry <b>vermouths</b> that are bitterer than sweet <b>vermouths.</b> The extra bitterness is often obtained by using nutmeg or bitter orange peel in the drink recipe. Bianco is a name given to a type of pale, sweeter vermouth.|$|E
5000|$|A Dry Manhattan is {{made with}} dry <b>vermouth</b> instead of sweet <b>vermouth,</b> usually also {{replacing}} the maraschino cherry with a twist {{in keeping with the}} overall principle of reducing the cocktail's sweetness. A Manhattan made with dry <b>vermouth</b> but retaining the cherry rather than twist is sometimes known as a [...] "half-dry Manhattan," [...] but this name risks confusion with the [...] "Perfect Manhattan" [...] (see below), whose quantity of <b>vermouth</b> consists of equal parts sweet <b>vermouth</b> and dry <b>vermouth.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In a dry martini, [...] "dry" [...] {{refers to}} the type of <b>vermouth</b> used, sweet or dry, not the amount of <b>vermouth</b> used in the drink. A [...] "perfect" [...] martini — or any other {{cocktail}} that uses <b>vermouth,</b> such as a Perfect Manhattan — is a martini made with equal parts dry and sweet <b>vermouth.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Vermouth</b> - Unlike other amaros, {{which are}} {{typically}} made from grain-based alcohol, <b>vermouth</b> amaro is wine-based. It is sweeter with more citrus, and very closely resembles the aperitif <b>vermouth.</b> Examples are Amaro Don Bairo, Amaro Diesus del Frate.|$|R
50|$|Noilly Prat, {{based in}} {{southern}} France, is primarily {{known for its}} dry, pale <b>vermouths,</b> but also produces a sweeter version. The company was founded by Joseph Noilly in 1813. Another French producer is Dolin, known for lighter <b>vermouths.</b>|$|E
50|$|Martini & Rossi, the top-selling {{international}} {{brand of}} vermouth, started in 1863 in Turin and produces both dry and sweet <b>vermouths,</b> but is mostly {{known for its}} Rosso. Cinzano and Martini & Rossi also produce rosé <b>vermouths,</b> which are mainly distributed in Italy and France.|$|E
50|$|Several wine grapes, {{including}} Clairette blanche, Piquepoul, Bianchetta Trevigiana, Catarratto and Trebbiano, {{are generally}} {{used as the}} base ingredients for <b>vermouths.</b> From these grapes, a low-alcohol white wine is produced by vermouth manufacturers. The wine may be aged {{for a short while}} before the addition of other ingredients. For sweet <b>vermouths,</b> sugar syrup is added before the wine is fortified with extra alcohol. The added alcohol is usually a neutral grape spirit, but may also come from vegetable sources such as sugar beets. The wine is then placed in large barrels or tanks to which the dry ingredients have already been added. The mixture is stirred at intervals until the dry ingredients have been absorbed and the drink is ready for bottling. Caramel color is added to make red <b>vermouths.</b> Most <b>vermouths</b> are bottled at between 16% and 18% ABV, as compared with the 9-14% ABV of most unfortified wines.|$|E
50|$|The Carpano family {{originated}} several notable {{brands of}} <b>vermouth,</b> including Punt e Mes, a deep red <b>vermouth</b> with sweet and bitter flavors, and the Antica Formula brand, a bitter, fuller-flavored version of <b>vermouth.</b> Distillerie Fratelli Branca of Milan bought 50% of the Giuseppe B. Carpano company in 1982 and acquired the company outright in 2001. Gancia, Drapò <b>Vermouth,</b> Delmistero, and Cocchi are other Italian producers.|$|R
50|$|In {{the years}} since 2013, there has been renewed {{interest}} in <b>vermouth</b> in the US. Artisanal makers have created new brands of <b>vermouth</b> which do not seek to imitate European styles, and <b>vermouth</b> has been a fast-growing category within the wine trade.|$|R
50|$|Because <b>vermouth</b> is fortified, an opened bottle {{will not}} sour {{as quickly as}} white wine. Opened <b>vermouth,</b> however, will {{gradually}} deteriorate over time. Gourmets recommend that opened bottles of <b>vermouth</b> be consumed within one to three months and should be kept refrigerated to slow oxidation.|$|R
50|$|Currently, Sacred {{produces}} 16 products, including gins, vodkas, <b>vermouths,</b> aperitifs and bottled cocktails.|$|E
50|$|Over time, two {{distinct}} versions of vermouth became established, one pale, dry, and bitter, {{and the other}} red and sweeter. Merchant Antonio Benedetto Carpano introduced the first sweet vermouth in 1786 in Turin, Italy. The drink reportedly quickly became popular with the royal court of Turin. Around 1800 to 1813, the first pale, dry vermouth was produced in France by Joseph Noilly. However, not all pale <b>vermouths</b> produced over time have been dry, and not all red <b>vermouths</b> have been sweet.|$|E
50|$|The {{distilled}} {{essential oil}} is used widely in perfumes {{and as a}} muscatel flavoring for <b>vermouths,</b> wines, and liqueurs. It is also used in aromatherapy.|$|E
5000|$|Sacred English Amber <b>Vermouth,</b> 21.8%. A medium-sweet amber style <b>vermouth,</b> {{made with}} English white wine from Gloucestershire and 16 botanicals.|$|R
5000|$|Like the Manhattan, the Rob Roy {{can be made}} [...] "sweet", [...] "dry", or [...] "perfect". The {{standard}} Rob Roy is {{the sweet}} version, made with sweet <b>vermouth,</b> {{so there is no}} need to specify a [...] "sweet" [...] Rob Roy when ordering. A [...] "dry" [...] Rob Roy is made by replacing the sweet <b>vermouth</b> with dry <b>vermouth.</b> A [...] "perfect" [...] Rob Roy is made with equal parts sweet and dry <b>vermouth.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Old Pal is a {{cocktail}} originally made with Canadian Rye Whiskey, French <b>Vermouth</b> (dry), and Campari. It {{is similar to}} a Negroni, but with Rye whiskey instead of Gin and the use of dry <b>vermouth</b> instead of sweet <b>vermouth.</b> Today it is more commonly made with American rye whiskey.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to pale and red <b>vermouths,</b> there exist golden and rosé versions, {{but these are}} not as internationally popular. The region of Chambéry in France has received an appellation d'origine contrôlée for its <b>vermouths,</b> which include a strawberry -flavored version called Chambéryzette. Lillet, St. Raphael and Dubonnet are fortified wines similar to vermouth, but are usually considered separate products. The two predominant styles of vermouth—the red, Italian rosso and the dry, white vermouth from France—were created and commercialized more than two centuries ago.|$|E
5000|$|Specialist cooking wines, liqueurs, <b>vermouths</b> and eaux de vie {{are widely}} used by {{professional}} chefs to enhance flavour in traditional and modern dishes. These are specially created to be an ingredient in cooking, not a beverage. As well as offering value for money, they have a longer shelf life which avoids wastage. The addition of specialist cooking wines, liqueurs and <b>vermouths</b> adds flavour to finished meat and fish dishes; desserts benefit {{from the use of}} sweet or dry wines. In addition, the use of specialist cooking wine in marinades can tenderise meat and is of particular benefit to game dishes. Many chefs [...] discourage serving the same alcoholic beverage with the meal that was cooked using it.|$|E
50|$|Aromatised wine-based aperitifs are a {{range of}} {{beverages}} related to vermouth but can be flavoured with many botanicals including cinchona bark (the source of quinine), gentian root and fruit, and typically don't contain wormwood, or flavours of wormwood, that <b>vermouths</b> historically have. Two types include Quinquina and Americano.|$|E
5000|$|Alessandro Martini (1812 [...] - [...] 1905) was an Italian businessman, {{founder of}} one of the most {{important}} <b>vermouth</b> companies in the world, Martini & Rossi, which produces the Martini <b>vermouth.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Sacred English Dry <b>Vermouth,</b> 21.8%. An {{extra-dry}} <b>vermouth,</b> {{made with}} English white wine from Gloucestershire and 16 botanicals including thyme, {{intended for the}} Dry Martini cocktail, but also usable in other mixed drinks.|$|R
50|$|Martini & Rossi is an Italian {{multinational}} {{alcoholic beverage}} company primarily {{associated with the}} Martini brand of <b>vermouth</b> and also with sparkling wine (for example, Asti). It also produces the French <b>vermouth,</b> Noilly Prat.|$|R
50|$|The Noilly Prat company came to Marseillan in 1853, and {{is still}} {{producing}} its <b>vermouths</b> on the same site. Mr Noilly had created the vermouth in Lyon in 1813. His son, with an English partner (Mr Prat), came to Marseillan to commercialise their product because the local wines were very suitable and the climate was ideal.|$|E
50|$|This {{product was}} {{discontinued}} in 2008. Launched in 2003 and {{produced by the}} makers of Plymouth Gin, {{it is one of}} the strongest fruit cups at 30% ABV, which Plymouth says gives it a fuller flavour. It is the result of the base of Plymouth Gin being mixed with fruit liqueurs, <b>vermouths,</b> aromatic bitters and citrus extracts.|$|E
50|$|Sharon Tyler Herbst's book, The Ultimate A-To-Z Bar Guide, lists 112 cocktails using dry vermouth and 82 {{containing}} sweet vermouth. Cocktails {{using either}} dry or sweet vermouth or both include the Americano, Bronx, Gibson, Manhattan, Negroni, Rob Roy, and Rose. Variations of cocktail recipes using equal portions of dry and sweet <b>vermouths</b> are called perfect, as in a Perfect Manhattan.|$|E
5000|$|The use of <b>vermouth</b> as a {{medicinal}} liquor waned {{by the end}} of the 18th century, but its use as an aperitif {{increased in}} Italy and France. The advent of the cocktail, in the late 19th century, found a new use for <b>vermouth.</b> [...] Bartenders found that it was an ideal mixer for many cocktails, including the Martini (beginning in the 1860s) and the Manhattan (beginning around 1874). In addition, the popular <b>Vermouth</b> cocktail, first appearing in 1869, consisted of chilled <b>vermouth</b> and a twist of lemon peel with the occasional addition of small amounts of bitters or maraschino. The popularity of vermouth-heavy cocktails in America, often using twice as much <b>vermouth</b> as gin or whiskey, continued through the 1880s and 1890s. Although the amount of <b>vermouth</b> used in cocktail recipes had somewhat declined, it has recently been experiencing a rise as a favorite among a new breed of bartenders, as a key ingredient in many cocktails. [...] <b>Vermouth</b> gained popularity in the 1950s with help from the Martini, which was being marketed by liquor companies. Product placement and celebrity endorsements from personalities such as Ernest Hemingway and Humphrey Bogart helped to increase the Martini’s profile. However, the most successful advertiser of the Martini was the fictional character James Bond.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Vermouth</b> is a {{fortified}} wine flavoured with aromatic {{herbs and spices}} ("aromatised" [...] in the trade) using closely guarded recipes (trade secrets). Some of the herbs and spices used may include cardamom, cinnamon, marjoram and chamomile. [...] Some <b>vermouth</b> is sweetened; however, unsweetened or dry, <b>vermouth</b> tends to be bitter. The person credited with the second <b>vermouth</b> recipe, Antonio Benedetto Carpano from Turin, Italy, chose to name his concoction [...] "vermouth" [...] in 1786 because he {{was inspired by a}} German wine flavoured with wormwood, an herb most famously used in distilling absinthe. However, wine flavoured with wormwood goes back to ancient Rome. The modern German word Wermut (Wermuth in the spelling of Carpano's time) means both wormwood and <b>vermouth.</b> The herbs were originally used to mask raw flavours of cheaper wines, imparting a slightly medicinal [...] "tonic" [...] flavor.|$|R
5000|$|Sacred English Spiced <b>Vermouth,</b> 18%. A dark, 'rosso' {{style of}} <b>vermouth</b> made with English white wine from Gloucestershire. The wine is {{fortified}} and bittered with Wormwood, {{grown in the}} West Country for Sacred, and 23 other botanicals.|$|R
50|$|In Italy, {{the grape}} {{is the most}} widely planted member of the Muscat family and is most {{commonly}} known as Moscato Bianco. It is the oldest known variety grown in Piedmont and is the primary component of the Asti and Moscato d'Asti wines, {{as well as for}} the aromatized and fortified <b>vermouths.</b> It is also commonly used for fortified dessert wines as well as the semi-sparkling Frizzante.|$|E
5000|$|The Bronx is flavorful and mildly sweet [...] "fruity" [...] drink, {{without being}} uninteresting or sticky. Though {{possibly}} {{inspired by the}} Duplex, the two drinks are not really similar at all. Cocktail columnists Gary Regan and Mardee Haidin Regan describe it as a drink where [...] "gin is the base ingredient, orange juice is the mixer, and sweet and dry <b>vermouths</b> are added almost as an afterthought." ...|$|E
5000|$|Cinzano <b>vermouths</b> {{date back}} to 1757 and the Turin herbal shop of two brothers, Giovanni Giacomo and Carlo Stefano Cinzano, who created a new [...] "vermouth rosso" [...] (red vermouth) using [...] "aromatic plants from the Italian Alps in a still-secret recipe {{combining}} 35 ingredients (including marjoram, thyme, and yarrow)". [...] What {{became known as the}} [...] "vermouth of Turin" [...] proved popular with the bourgeoisie of Turin and, later, Casanova.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{establish}} {{the dynamics of the}} physical-chemical parameters of flavoured wines and <b>vermouth</b> type wines, obtained by the addition of hydroalcoholic macerates from plants to the Sauvignon Blanc wine variety, we analyzed certain physical and chemical characteristics (D 20 20, Alcool %, Total dry extract g/l, Free sugar g/l, Unreducing extract g /l, Total Acidity g/l C 4 H 6 O 6, Free SO 2 mg/l Total SO 2 mg/l) for 9 samples. Compared to the main wine parameters, the tested parameters had the following evolution: Alcoholic strength, Free sugar and Density increased in <b>vermouth</b> type wines, Total acidity decreased slightly in flavoured wines and more obvious in <b>vermouth</b> type wines. The total dry extract increased sharply in <b>vermouth</b> type wines and the unreducing extract decreased sharply in <b>vermouth</b> type wines. The amount of Free SO 2 was higher in flavoured wines, but Total SO 2 had lower values, both for flavoured wines and <b>vermouth</b> type wines, comparative to Sauvignon Blanc wine. Plants macerates added to the Sauvignon Blanc basic wine, influenced most of the physical-chemical parameters and provided new qualitative features to resulting beverages...|$|R
