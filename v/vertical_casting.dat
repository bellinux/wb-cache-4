50|$|This {{method is}} usually used to cast parts {{in which the}} {{diameter}} exceeds the length. <b>Vertical</b> <b>casting</b> can produce both cylindrical and non-cylindrical castings. These non-cylindrical castings include ball valve balls, gear blanks, and conical shaped parts. Unlike the horizontal method, no slip occurs between the metal and mold due to the constant resultant force applied during rotation.|$|E

50|$|In 1963, a {{full size}} single strand, <b>vertical</b> <b>casting</b> machine {{was added to}} the {{original}} Oxygen Process Shop.

50|$|It is {{here that}} the design of {{continuous}} casting machines may vary. This describes a 'curved apron' casting machine; vertical configurations are also used. In a curved apron casting machine, the strand exits the mold vertically (or on a near vertical curved path) and as it travels through the spray-chamber, the rollers gradually curve the strand towards the horizontal. In a <b>vertical</b> <b>casting</b> machine, the strand stays vertical as it passes through the spray-chamber. Molds in a curved apron casting machine can be straight or curved, depending on the basic design of the machine.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Driven by obvious {{advantages}} of the <b>vertical</b> <b>casting</b> process for very special steel grades {{there is a new}} trend to use <b>vertical</b> <b>casting</b> even for heavy bloom round sections. Compared with ingot casting routes, this technology reaches 12. 5 % more yield. Thus an additional share of the today’s ingot casting route can be shifted to the more cost effective continuous casting line. 1 New concept for large round blooms Siemens Metals Technologies got a contract from the Chinese company Zhongyuan Spe-cial Steel Co. Ltd. to build a new vertical continuous caster for production of heavy blooms in round cross-section. With the new two-strand caster, in future Zhongyuan will be able to produce blanks for high-quality steel grades, tool and bearing steels...|$|E

The research, performed in the University of Liège, consists in the optimisation of the mould and the whole casting process of the LBP S. A. company (Chênée – Liège) to obtain better cast products. In fact, cast products sometimes present long oscillation marks (λ ≈ 500 mm) and some ingots have many internal cracks.

40|$|This {{research}} {{developed at}} University of Liege aims {{to optimize the}} complete semi-continuous casting process at LBP Company, a producer of copper-nickel alloys (or cupro-nickels). The process consists in <b>vertical</b> <b>casting</b> of 7 m long ingots. Some problems recurrently occur during casting process: formation of oscillations (wave length of about 500 mm), unsuitable concave cross-sections or internal cracks. In {{order to reduce the}} occurrence of such defects and to better understand their formation, we have been asked to develop a finite element model. The research focuses on two main topics: identification of material properties through laboratory tests and literature survey and the development of the numerical tool. The laboratory tests provide thermal and mechanical properties of the ingot and the mould, as well as heat transfer coefficients between the ingot and its surroundings (mould, air and water). These parameters are required for the numerical simulations of the process. In {{the second part of the}} research, numerical calculations have been performed using finite element method. Two types of 2 D models have already been studied: horizontal slice and vertical slice. This first choice has been guided by the high coupling between thermal and mechanical aspects of the problem, leading to highly complex systems of equations and subsequent long CPU times. However, due to the limitations of such 2 D models, a 3 D formulation has then been considered and it is still in progress. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Through a {{cooperative}} effort with the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Heavy Vehicle Technologies (OHVT), Alcoa {{is developing a}} casting process to produce ultra large thin wall components. The casting process is a low pressure, metal mold, multiport injection <b>vertical</b> <b>casting</b> process. The specific system for demonstration of the process is located at Alcoa's Technology Center and will be capable of producing parts extending 3 M long, 1. 7 M wide and 0. 4 M high. For example, single castings of car floor pan frames or side wall aperture structures are candidates for this installation. This shall provide a major opportunity {{to reduce the cost}} of lightweight transportation vehicle structures by (a) reducing the components or part count and (b) reducing the cost of assembly. To develop and demonstrate the process, an inner panel of the Chrysler minivan liftgate will be first produced on this system. Through computer analyses, the cast inner panel design was developed to satisfy both structural performance and casting process requirements. Currently, this is an 11 part assembly of steel components. At the time of this abstract, the numerous system components are in various phases of fabrication and site preparation is fully underway, with system shakedown beginning {{in the second quarter of}} 1999. Successful demonstration of caster system operation is anticipated to occur during the third quarter and production of a high quality product during the fourth quarter. Although the process is targeted toward reducing the cost of lightweight trucks, buses and autos, consideration is being given to application in the aircraft industry...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Large sinking {{particles}} transport {{organic and}} inor-ganic matter into the deeper {{layers of the}} oceans. Between 70 and 90 % of the aggregates exported from the surface mixed layer are disaggregated within the upper 1000 m.

50|$|The flame-grilling {{machine at}} Burger King, Carl's Jr./Hardee's, and other fast food {{restaurants}} {{is called a}} 'broiler'. It works by moving meat patties along a chain conveyor belt between top and bottom burners, grilling {{both sides of the}} meat patty at the same time. This concept was invented in 1898, when the Bridge and Beach Co. of St. Louis, Missouri, started manufacturing a <b>vertical</b> <b>cast</b> iron stove. These stoves were designed to allow the meat to be flame-broiled (flame-grilled) on both sides at the same time. Custom hinged steel wire gridirons were built for use in the vertical broilers. The hinged gridirons were slid {{in and out of the}} stoves holding the meat while it cooked evenly on both sides, like modern day oven racks. These stoves took up a small amount of counter space. They were used in lunch spots to feed factory workers.|$|R

50|$|There were {{numerous}} iron gridirons manufactured and patented in the U.S. in the 1800s. Originally called spiders, these iron legged devices {{were used in}} a fireplace placed over the fire to cook food. Over time, gridirons have been developed specifically to accommodate the type of food being prepared and the cooking method being used. A combination hinged gridiron and spider was developed and patented in 1836 by Amasa and George Sizer of Meriden, Connecticut. A steel wire gridiron was developed and patented as early as 1889 in New Haven, Connecticut, by William C. Perkins, of the New Haven Wire Goods Co., who received a U.S. Patent #408,136 for a hinged gridiron that would hold the meat in place while broiling. A commercial hinged broiler or gridiron was designed {{for use in the}} Bridge & Beach, Co., 1898 <b>vertical</b> <b>cast</b> iron stove.

This small establishment, which advertises itself as the oldest hamburger restaurant in the U.S., is credited by some with having invented the classic American hamburger when Louis sandwiched a ground steak patty between two pieces of white toast for a busy office worker in 1900. Louis' Lunch flame broils the hamburgers in the original 1898 Bridge & Beach <b>vertical</b> <b>cast</b> iron gas stoves using locally developed steel wire gridirons to hold the hamburgers in place during cooking (U.S. Patent #2,148,879). In 1974, The New York Times published a story about Louis' Lunch claiming to have invented the hamburger. The U.S. Library of Congress' American Folklife Center Local Legacies Project website credits Louis' Lunch as the maker of America's first hamburger and steak sandwich. The hamburger is still served today on two pieces of toast and not a bun.|$|R
