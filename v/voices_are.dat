5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six movements, first alternating arias and recitative, then uniting {{the voices}} in recitative and aria, finally a chorale. The two soloists are supported by an intimate Baroque instrumental ensemble of oboe, strings and continuo. The oboe accompanies the soprano, a solo violin the bass, both play when the <b>voices</b> <b>are</b> united.|$|E
5|$|Most Nahuatl {{varieties}} have {{a number}} of ways to alter the valency of a verb. Classical Nahuatl had a passive voice (also sometimes defined as an impersonal voice), but this is not found in most modern varieties. However the applicative and causative <b>voices</b> <b>are</b> found in many modern dialects. Many Nahuatl varieties also allow forming verbal compounds with two or more verbal roots.|$|E
5|$|The game {{uses the}} visual effect of {{applying}} pre-rendered video footage to a polygon, specifically the game's pre-recorded {{shows on the}} television. IGN writer Anoop Gantayat praised this effect's implementation, although he did note some minor graphical issues visible in the transition from distanced to full-screen viewing. Also unusual for the Pokémon video game series, the Pokémon's <b>voices</b> <b>are</b> borrowed from the anime and sound like their names.|$|E

5|$|The {{music of}} the two stanzas of the chorale is identical. The tune {{is not a simple}} four-part setting as in most of Bach's later cantatas, but the <b>voices</b> <b>are</b> {{embedded}} in a concerto of the orchestra, led by violin I and oboe I. The instrumental theme is derived from the first line of the chorale tune.|$|E
5|$|Even though <b>voices</b> <b>are</b> often used, it {{is neither}} a concert opera nor a cantata, but a choral symphony. If there is singing, almost from the beginning, it is to prepare the listener's mind for the {{dramatic}} scenes whose feelings and passions are to be expressed by the orchestra. It is also to introduce the choral masses gradually into the musical development, when their too sudden appearance would have damaged the compositions's unity....|$|E
5|$|For the Dissidia Final Fantasy US release, Gamestop {{released}} {{the game with}} two additional covers for anyone who reserved it before it came out. On August 24, 2009, {{it was announced that}} there would be an international version of the game. Named , this revision of the game would be a direct port of the North American version of the game, retaining all the extra features added, and was released in Japan on November 1, 2009. Both English and Japanese <b>voices</b> <b>are</b> available in battle, with the player deciding which language the characters will speak.|$|E

5|$|In February 2001, Mr. Bean was revived to {{form part}} of an {{animated}} cartoon series, with Rowan Atkinson reprising {{his role as the}} title character providing references for all of Bean's animated actions. Much like the live-action series, the animated series features little dialogue; although some words are spoken, most is either little soundbites or mumbling. The spin-off introduced a list of new characters, alongside regulars in the live-action (such as Teddy, and Irma Gobb), including an unpleasant landlady of Mr. Bean, Mrs. Wicket, and her evil one-eyed cat, Scrapper. Other characters' <b>voices</b> <b>are</b> provided by Jon Glover, Rupert Degas, Gary Martin and Lorelei King.|$|E
5|$|The album's {{songs are}} characterised by metronomic pop, vocal harmonies, hand claps, {{prominent}} electric guitar riffs, bright synthesizers, a homogeneous sound and message, and rotations of lead vocals. The members' <b>voices</b> <b>are</b> presented individually on the record, and its lyricism speaks of falling in love, unrequited love, the insistence that flaws are what {{make a person}} unique, commitment, jealousy, and longing for past significant others. Take Me Home garnered mostly positive reviews from music critics. There was praise for its quality of production, while criticism hinged on its generic, rushed nature.|$|E
5|$|The section {{addressing}} God as Father and Son {{is again}} a duet, {{this time of}} soprano I and tenor. The <b>voices</b> <b>are</b> often in canon and in parallel, as in the Christe. The movement is likely another parody, possibly from the 1729 cantata Ihr Häuser des Himmels, BWV 193a. As the Christe, it is a love-duet addressing Jesus. Both duets appear {{as the center of}} the symmetry within the respective part, Kyrie and Gloria. Here an obbligato flute opens a concerto with the orchestra and introduces material that the voices pick up.|$|E

5|$|Dynamic editing {{contributed to}} the surrealistic nature of the episode. Abrupt cuts from {{close-up}} to extreme wide angles and sudden shifts from normal speed to super slow-motion are used in Buffy's dream: several sequences become slow-motion partway through them, then revert to normal speed as they continue. Xander's dream features mismatches between sound and image: characters are sometimes shown not speaking even as their <b>voices</b> <b>are</b> heard. Additionally, silence is used frequently, to both reflect the characters' disorientation and to unsettle the audience. Whedon cited films by Steven Soderbergh as his main inspirations for the odd editing, especially The Limey and The Underneath. He also listed Orson Welles' version of The Trial and Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut as inspirations for many of his shooting and editing decisions.|$|E
5|$|Sabrina (Chaplin) {{walks down}} the stairs, and Ray puts the {{painting}} back and hides. Sabrina turns down Gerald's music to watch EastEnders. Gerald returns, sitting away from Sabrina. He turns up his music and the pair fight over the television remote, before leaving through the patio door and arguing, though their <b>voices</b> <b>are</b> muffled. Ray cuts away the canvas and replaces it with kitchen roll. When Sabrina reenters, she unknowingly stands on the canvas. Kim picks it up, mistaking it for laundry, and heads into a laundry room as Sabrina walks upstairs. Eddie follows Kim and she sprays something into his eyes. Ray knocks out Kim and sees the canvas in a laundry basket, which is sent up a laundry chute. He runs upstairs, while Gerald remains outside.|$|E
5|$|The Front of the Stage is open'd, and the Band of 24 Violins, {{with the}} Harpsicals and Theorbo's which {{accompany}} the <b>Voices,</b> <b>are</b> plac'd between the Pit and the Stage. While the Overture is playing, the Curtain rises, and discovers a new Frontispiece, joyn'd {{to the great}} Pylasters, {{on each side of}} the Stage... Behind this is the Scene, which represents a thick Cloudy Sky, a very Rocky Coast, and a Tempestuous Sea in perpetual Agitation. This Tempest (suppos'd to be rais'd by Magick) has many dreadful Objects in it, as several Spirits in horrid shapes flying down amongst the Sailers, then rising and crossing in the Air. And when the Ship is sinking, the whole House is darken'd, and a shower of Fire falls upon 'em. This is accompanied with Lightning, and several Claps of Thunder, to the end of the Storm.|$|E

50|$|The enunciating voice, in {{at least}} some {{aircraft}} systems, may be either male or female and in some cases this may be selected according to pilot preference. If the <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> female it may be referred to as Bitching Betty; if the <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> male it may be referred to as Barking Bob. A female <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> heard on military aircraft such as the F-16 Fighting Falcon, the Eurofighter Typhoon and the Mikoyan MiG-29. A male <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> heard on Boeing commercial airliners and is also used in the BAE Hawk.|$|R

She was played by Tara Reid in the live-action film. Bleep's <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> done by Don Messick (also {{the voice of}} Scooby-Doo, Astro, Dr. Benton Quest, Boo Boo, and more). Ashanti Bromfield portrays her in the CW series Riverdale.|$|R
5|$|The script {{calls for}} one actor to play both male {{characters}}Jason and the pimp. Jason and Number 18 are haunted by four voices. As poetic and prophetic voices, these characters serve {{much the same}} purpose as a chorus in Greek tragedies, according to reviewer Lana Michelin of the Red Deer Advocate. Variously considered angels or ghosts, the <b>voices</b> <b>are</b> written in the script to be played by the female actors who portray Number 18, Marta, Ali, and Mama. While these voices sometimes emphasize {{the horrors of the}} sex industry, at other times, they offer comfort to Number 18. It is only revealed at the play's conclusion that the chorus is made up of dead child prostitutes.|$|E

5000|$|Parson's <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> dubbed {{by another}} actor. The {{director}} {{did not feel}} that Peter's <b>voice</b> <b>was</b> [...] "New Zealand" [...] enough, though the dubbed voice sounded nothing like a New Zealander's accent.|$|R
25|$|Auditory hallucinations, {{particularly}} {{experiences of}} hearing <b>voices,</b> <b>are</b> {{the most common}} and often prominent feature of psychosis. Hallucinated voices may talk about, or to, the person, and may involve several speakers with distinct personalities. Auditory hallucinations tend to be particularly distressing when they are derogatory, commanding or preoccupying. However, the experience of hearing voices need not always be a negative one. One research study has shown that the majority of people who hear <b>voices</b> <b>are</b> not in need of psychiatric help. The Hearing Voices Movement has subsequently been created to support voice hearers, regardless of whether they are considered to have a mental disorder or not.|$|E
