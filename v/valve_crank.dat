5000|$|BANJO'BILLABONG - The first {{attraction}} {{in the current}} new masterplan known as [...] "Kangaroo Island" [...] opened in December 2012. Banjo's Billabong is the largest Aqua play structure built in the Southern Hemisphere. It is a spectacular four storey, 760sq metre Australiana themed with over 198 different water features crowned by a huge water bucket, which tips 1200 litres of water over the structure every few minutes. A ‘hands-on’ adventure for everyone containing multiple-level platforms, 6 water slides, <b>valves,</b> <b>cranks,</b> water cannons, bridge climbs & spray features.|$|R
50|$|The end of {{the piston}} rod is {{connected}} to a built-up crank at {{the centre of the}} crankshaft. The crankshaft has the <b>valve</b> return <b>crank</b> at one end and a flywheel at the other.|$|R
5000|$|The Suzuki RG500 [...] "Gamma" [...] was {{powered by}} a two-stroke, rotary <b>valve,</b> twin <b>crank,</b> square four engine {{displacing}} 498 cubic centimeters. The power output was 93.7 brake horsepower (69.9 kW) at 9,500 RPM.|$|R
5000|$|The F4 CC, {{named after}} Claudio Castiglioni, the Managing Director of MV Agusta, was {{released}} in late 2006. The F4 CC has [...] @ 12,500 rpm (rear wheel) and has a price tag of $120,000. The engine is a 1,078 cc larger capacity edition with <b>valves,</b> <b>crank</b> and piston rods made from titanium based on the F4 1000 R engine combined with the TSS (Torque Shift System). It {{is one of the}} most exclusive motorcycles in the world (100 examples).The F4 CC uses the 1078cc engine, which is a 'long stroke' version of the 312 engine, the extra engine capacity being gained by use of a longer crankshaft stroke. This design change allowed the engine tuning to bring the maximum torque delivered to be at a low 8,200 revs, instead of 10,200, as with earlier engines.|$|R
5000|$|Compression {{testing is}} a crude form of leak-down testing which also {{includes}} effects due to compression ratio, <b>valve</b> timing, <b>cranking</b> speed, and other factors. Compression tests should normally be done with all spark plugs removed to maximize cranking speed. Cranking compression is a dynamic test of the actual low-speed pumping action, where peak cylinder pressure is measured and stored.|$|R
50|$|The Serpollet Tricycle {{was one of}} {{the first}} industrially {{manufactured}} motor vehicles; it was designed by Léon Serpollet, and first presented in 1886. The tricycle possessed an oil-fired boiler and a single-cylinder engine with poppet <b>valves</b> and <b>crank</b> cases. The steam tricycle of 1899 produced about 5 HP with its 4 cylinders. It achieved a maximum speed of about 25 km/h (16 mph).|$|R
50|$|Martin likes {{performance}} cars, {{and entered}} a vintage Maserati in the 2008 Mille Miglia. This was televised on 28 December 2008. He failed {{to complete the}} race due to a dropped <b>valve</b> and broken <b>crank.</b>|$|R
50|$|The end of {{the piston}} rod is {{connected}} to a built-up crank at {{the centre of the}} crankshaft. The crankshaft has the <b>valve</b> return <b>crank</b> at one end and a flywheel at the other. Also at the flywheel end is a small pinion meshing with a larger gear wheel mounted on a bracket cast in with the engine frame, giving a slightly more than 2:1 speed reduction. The second shaft has a small pulley attached.|$|R
50|$|By 1859, {{all of the}} key {{features}} of {{what we now know}} as the Corliss engine were in place. Patents granted to Corliss and others incorporated rotary <b>valves</b> and <b>crank</b> shafts in-line with the cylinders. See, for example, Corliss' U.S. Patent 24,618, granted July 5, 1859. Competing inventors worked hard to invent alternatives to Corliss' mechanisms; they generally avoided Corlis's use of a wrist plate and adopted alternative releasing mechanisms for the steam valves, as in Jamieson's U.S. Patent 19,640, granted March 16, 1858.|$|R
5000|$|Many key {{upgrades}} {{came to the}} KDX200 in 1989. It received liquid cooling, {{a modified}} powervalve system with larger expansion bottle and <b>valves,</b> a heavier <b>crank,</b> dual disc brakes, heavier clutch springs and more plates, a newly modeled frame with a modern style linkage, KX125-based shock with 16 compression and 16 rebound adjustments, quick release access for rear wheel, large airbox, and a [...] fuel tank.|$|R
5000|$|The Suzuki RG500 [...] "Gamma" [...] was a {{motorcycle}} built by Suzuki between 1985 and 1987 and {{inspired by the}} 1984 Suzuki RG500 [...] "Gamma" [...] Grand Prix motorcycle, capitalizing on Suzuki's seven consecutive constructors title wins in the 500 cc-class. The Gamma was powered by a two-stroke, rotary <b>valve,</b> twin <b>crank,</b> square four engine displacing 498 cubic centimeters. The power output was [...] at 9,500 RPM. The engine employed liquid-cooling {{by means of a}} front-mounted radiator with a thermostatic control. Suzuki employed an aluminum boxsection frame with castings for the headstock and rear swing arm for the Gamma. The front suspension had pre-load adjust and an anti-dive system called [...] "POSI DAMP" [...] to control the tendency of {{a motorcycle}}'s nose to dive under braking. At the rear the full-floater suspension design used dual-swingarms. The motorcycle weighed 154 kg dry.|$|R
50|$|N-VCT varies {{valve timing}} by {{rotating}} the affected camshaft(s) {{relative to the}} sprocket; valve lift and duration are not altered. This rotation is achieved when an electric solenoid, controlled by the car's ECU, allows pressurized engine oil to flow into and through the cam and into a slave mechanism, axially advancing cam timing relative to the sprocket. <b>Valve</b> to <b>crank</b> angle timing varies depending on whether engine speed is high or low and changes at fixed intervals. NVTCS is hydraulically actuated similar to Honda’s VTEC system, but adjusts a different aspect of the valve train, so it is more like the I part of I-VTEC. NVTCS equipped Nissan engines do not have as high of engine speeds as VTEC equipped engines so NVTCS is simpler, quieter, and requires no special maintenance. Some Nissan engines only have N-VCT on the intake cam such as the GA16DE, SR20DE/DET (S14-15) or RB25DE/DET (R33-R34 GTS/GTS-T, GT/GTT) while others have it on both the intake and exhaust cams. NVTCS was eventually phased out and replaced by a continuously variable system called CVTCS on newer engines such as the VQ and VK series.|$|R
2500|$|The 2.0L 16-valve straight-4 engine {{rated at}} [...] {{and a top}} speed of [...] with performance-tuned ride and handling. [...] Renault later {{released}} the Williams 2 and Williams 3 special editions, much to the chagrin of those owners who had been assured of the exclusivity of the [...] "original" [...] Williams. One common mistake people can make is thinking that the 2.0 16V (F7R) used in the Williams is simply a bored out 1.8 16V (F7P), whereas, in reality the large engine had different size <b>valves,</b> cams, stroked <b>crank</b> and engine oil cooler. Other differences between the Williams and the Clio 16S it is based on include a wider front track with wishbones similar, but {{not the same as the}} Renault 19, wider Speedline alloys, uprated (JC5) gearbox, bespoke four-to-one manifold, firmer suspension, and some cosmetic differences on the exterior and interior.|$|R
5000|$|Nux {{drives a}} highly {{customized}} 1933 Chevrolet 5 Window Coupe {{with a big}} block V8 engine. The hot rod stripped of all paint also has a basic nitrous oxide installation engaged manually by a <b>crank</b> <b>valve</b> for a boost in power. The front of the vehicle {{is equipped with a}} lancer's perch. The cross is used to hold Max while he is acting as Nux's blood bag. The steering wheel is custom and completely removable. In the back there is space for a passenger, in the movie it is occupied by the character [...] "Slit". Peculiarly, the vehicle is capable of driving in reverse at high speeds. Nux considers the vehicle just as expendable as himself; he does not hesitate to flood the cabin with gasoline to make it into a driving suicide bomb to facilitate the glorious death he desires.|$|R
50|$|All {{the driving}} wheels have an {{out-of-balance}} {{which is caused}} by their off-center crank pins and attached components. The main driving wheels have the greatest unbalance since they have the biggest crankpin {{as well as the}} revolving portion of the main rod. They also have the <b>valve</b> gear eccentric <b>crank</b> and the back end of the eccentric rod. In common with the linked driving wheels they also have their own portion of the side rod weight. The part of the main rod assigned a revolving motion was originally measured by weighing it supported at each end. A more accurate method became necessary which split the revolving and reciprocating parts based on the position of the center of percussion. This position was measured by swinging the rod as a pendulum. The unbalance in the remaining driving wheels is caused by a crankpin and side rod weight. The side rod weights assigned to each crankpin are measured by suspending the rod on as many scales as there are crankpins or by calculation.|$|R
40|$|This {{work is a}} part of a {{research}} program that aims to modify a conventional internal combustion engine {{and turn it into a}} hybrid pneumatic-combustion engine. The hybrid pneumatic-combustion engine should be able to convert mechanical energy into compressed air and convert compressed air back into mechanical energy. The potential application for the concept is any use of the internal combustion engine where the load oscillates between a negative and a positive value, such as automobiles and hybrid wind diesel systems for remote area power generation. In the first application, during vehicle decelerations, an excess of power occurs, and a negative load could be applied to the engine, whereas during vehicle accelerations, a positive load is applied. In the second application, if the generated wind power is higher than consumption demand, then the load applied to the engine could be negative, and if the generated wind power is lower than consumption demand, then the load is positive. In previous work, we exposed an optimization followed by a fuel-saving evaluation of a new hybrid pneumatic-combustion engine concept that uses a variable valve actuator system. The optimization of the valve actuation was based on ideal thermodynamic cycle modeling, assuming therefore an instant response of the variable valve actuator system. In the present work, a more realistic analysis of the system is provided by taking into consideration the dynamic response of the variable valve actuator system. Variable valve actuators have been widely studied for optimizing performance and fuel consumption of the internal combustion engine, especially in spark-ignition engines. For these engines, it is possible to reduce the pumping losses and to optimize the engine filling by controlling the intake and exhaust valve opening and closing angles, as well as their lifts. However, the variation of <b>valve</b> actuation <b>crank</b> angles required in a conventional internal combustion engine is significantly smaller than the one required in the hybrid pneumatic-combustion engine. This paper describes, through simulation, how the valve time response affects the performance of the hybrid pneumatic-combustion engine and recommends a required valve time response...|$|R
40|$|The fuel film {{thickness}} and temperature on {{the piston crown}} of a direct-injection spark-ignition (DISI) engine were measured using a fiber-based laser induced fluorescence (LIF) method. The engine investigated employed a wall-guided swirl-type system using a high-pressure swirl injector impinging onto the piston crown. The fuel used was isooctane {{with a small amount}} of a fluorescent liquid dopant. The measured fluorescence intensity was transformed to the fuel {{film thickness}} by way of the equations based on photophysics and the fiber optic properties. However, the fluorescence of the fuel mixture showed a strong dependency on the fuel temperature and this information was needed in the fuel film thickness calculation. The fuel film temperature, which may differ from the piston surface temperature, was measured by using a fiber-based fluorescence thermometry method. Engine tests were performed for motored and fired conditions under the late injection stratified mode. The results of the fuel film temperature measurement showed that the mean fuel film temperature follows the piston surface temperature and the convection heat transfer from the compressed hot air directly affected the mean fuel film temperature during the compression and expansion stroke. The fuel film thickness measurement results showed that the boiling point of the liquid dopant should be much higher than that of the main fuel to meet the co-evaporation condition. The fuel film persisted during the expansion stroke and started to evaporate actively from the exhaust <b>valve</b> opening <b>crank</b> angle for both motored and fired conditions. The fuel film thickness from the fuel injection to just before the occurrence of pool fires was the same level for motored and fired engine conditions although the piston temperature was higher for the fired condition. The spark ignition and the main flame before the pool fires do not affect the fuel film thickness. The duration and thickness of the fuel film was strongly affected by the boiling point of the fuel. The fuel film evaporates quicker for a fuel having a lower boiling point...|$|R
