50|$|Video Cassette Recording (VCR) is {{an early}} {{domestic}} analog recording format designed by Philips. It was the first successful consumer-level home <b>videocassette</b> <b>recorder</b> (<b>VCR)</b> system. Later variants included the VCR-LP and Super Video (SVR) formats.|$|E
50|$|Video {{recorders}} {{were sold}} for US $50,000 in 1956, and videotapes cost US $300 per one-hour reel. However, prices gradually dropped over the years; in 1971, Sony began selling <b>videocassette</b> <b>recorder</b> (<b>VCR)</b> decks and tapes into the consumer market.|$|E
50|$|A TiVo DVR {{serves a}} {{function}} {{similar to that}} of a <b>videocassette</b> <b>recorder</b> (<b>VCR),</b> in that both allow a television viewer to record programming for viewing at a later time. Unlike a videocassette recorder, which uses removable magnetic tape cartridges, a TiVo DVR stores television programs on an internal hard drive that can only be removed by disassembling the device.|$|E
5000|$|Established in 1986, the Avenue Video chain {{expanded}} to comprise {{a number of}} franchises in the Montreal area. The chain entered the market to fill the demand for VHS cassette rental (fresh from the format's victory with rival format Betamax) for viewing in newly acquired <b>videocassette</b> <b>recorders</b> (<b>VCRs).</b>|$|R
5000|$|Videotape is {{magnetic}} tape used for storing video and usually sound in addition. Information stored {{can be in}} the form of either an analog signal or digital signal. Videotape is used in both video tape recorders (VTRs) or, more commonly, <b>videocassette</b> <b>recorders</b> (<b>VCRs)</b> and camcorders. Videotapes are also used for storing scientific or medical data, such as the data produced by an electrocardiogram.|$|R
50|$|The Sony 9-Pin Protocol or P1 {{protocol}} is {{a two-way}} communications protocol to control advanced video recorders. Sony introduced this protocol to control reel-to-reel type C video tape recorders (VTR) {{as well as}} <b>videocassette</b> <b>recorders</b> (<b>VCR).</b> It uses an DE-9 D-Sub connector with 9 pins (hence the name), where bi-directional communication takes place over a four wire cable according to the RS-422 standard. The communication parameters are 38,400 baud, 8 data bits, odd parity and 1 stop bit (38k4/8O1).|$|R
50|$|Time base {{correction}} is {{a technique}} to reduce or eliminate errors caused by mechanical instability present in analog recordings on mechanical media. Without time base correction, a signal from a videotape recorder (VTR) or <b>videocassette</b> <b>recorder</b> (<b>VCR)</b> cannot be mixed with other, more time stable devices found in television studios and post-production facilities. Most broadcast quality VCRs have simple time base correctors built in though external time base correctors (TBCs) are often used.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>videocassette</b> <b>{{recorder}},</b> <b>VCR,</b> {{or video}} recorder is an electromechanical device that records analog audio and analog video from broadcast television or other source on a removable, magnetic tape videocassette, and can play back the recording. Use of a VCR {{to record a}} television program to play back at a more convenient time is {{commonly referred to as}} timeshifting. VCRs can also play back prerecorded tapes. In the 1980s and 1990s, prerecorded videotapes were widely available for purchase and rental, and blank tapes were sold to make recordings.|$|E
50|$|Many of the {{deficiencies}} of the open-reel systems were overcome with {{the invention of}} the <b>videocassette</b> <b>recorder</b> (<b>VCR),</b> where the videotape is enclosed in a user-friendly videocassette shell. This subsequently became the most familiar type of VTR known to consumers. In this system, the tape is preattached onto two reels enclosed within the cassette, and tape loading and unloading is automated. There is no need for the user to ever touch the tape, and the media can be protected from dust, dirt, and tape misalignments that can foul the recording mechanism. Typically, the only time the user ever touches the tape in a videocassette is when a failure results from a tape getting stuck in the mechanism.|$|E
50|$|JHV was {{established}} in May 1984 {{to take advantage of}} the explosion of <b>videocassette</b> <b>recorders</b> (<b>VCRs)</b> in Japan at that time. Following the introduction of commercial <b>VCR</b> Beta <b>recorders</b> in 1975 (and the VHS format in 1976), VCR production in Japan went from one million units in 1978 to 44 million by 1985 fueled largely by the number of movies (including pornography) available on VHS. By November 1984, the company had expanded enough to move to new headquarters in the fashionable Harajuku district of Tokyo.|$|R
50|$|For {{slightly}} less flexibility in upgrades, a preamplifier and a power amplifier in one box is called an integrated amplifier; with a tuner, it is a receiver. A monophonic power amplifier, {{which is called}} a monoblock, is often used for powering a subwoofer. Other modules in the system may include components like cartridges, tonearms, hi-fi turntables, Digital Media Players, digital audio players, DVD players that play {{a wide variety of}} discs including CDs, CD recorders, MiniDisc <b>recorders,</b> hi-fi <b>videocassette</b> <b>recorders</b> (<b>VCRs)</b> and reel-to-reel tape recorders. Signal modification equipment can include equalizers and signal processors.|$|R
50|$|From the 1950s, {{magnetic}} tape video recording {{became a major}} contributor to the television industry, via the first commercialized video tape recorders (VTRs). At that time, the devices were used only in expensive professional environments such as television studios and medical imaging (fluoroscopy). In the 1970s, videotape entered home use, creating the home video industry and changing the economics of the television and movie businesses. The television industry viewed <b>videocassette</b> <b>recorders</b> (<b>VCRs)</b> as having the power to disrupt their business, while television users viewed the VCR as the means to take control of their hobby.|$|R
50|$|Bell has {{discontinued}} older receivers which either only supported standard-definition television (SDTV) or {{included a}} series of features that newer receivers no longer offer. Receivers discontinued by Bell include the 4100, Bell's last standard-definition television (SDTV) receiver sold until March 2012. It is compact and provides coaxial cable, composite video, S-Video and TOSLINK outputs. It had no built-in PVR capabilities, requiring an external device such as a <b>videocassette</b> <b>recorder</b> (<b>VCR)</b> or DVD recorder to record shows. Prior to this, Bell discontinued the 5900 single tuner SDTV PVR receiver with a built-in hard drive to record up to 80 hours of programming. Features absent in Bell's current receivers but available in older receivers include picture-in-picture (watching two channels simultaneously on one TV) and a tuner for over-the-air programming (OTA programming) support. Having an OTA tuner can potentially allow access to unavailable or optional channels {{such as those of}} American networks.|$|E
40|$|A {{project was}} {{implemented}} which attempted {{to reduce the}} number of children from kindergarten through second grade whose counseling services are terminated prematurely, or who receive suboptimal counseling services because their active participation could not be engaged in the evaluation and counseling processes. Seven individual sessions were held with each of four children participating in the program. Using the view-through mode with <b>videocassette</b> <b>recorder</b> (<b>VCR)</b> camera and mointor, children who previously could not be engaged were encouraged to interact with the television on a variety of activities. Evaluative activities involving art, story telling, and play were carried out while interacting with the television. An additional three sessions were held with each child without the use of the VCR equipment. The results of the intervention were encouraging. Participatory behavio...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} and diffusion of the <b>videocassette</b> <b>recorder</b> (<b>VCR)</b> coincided {{with an increase}} in consumer spending on mass media as a proportion of gross national product. This article attempts to explain this apparent aberration to the principle of relative constancy by analyzing both the pattern of consumer expenditures on all mass media and the functionality of the VCR in relation to other media. An examination of audience needs and uses of the VCR suggests that the VCR offers a range of functions that implicate both mass communication and interpersonal communication. Thus, the VCR is both a functional competitor and a functional complement to existing mass media. The implications for the study of new media include a suggestion that functional analysis of media may provide an additional explanatory power for the mechanism of consumer spending on mass media. ...|$|E
5000|$|Standby power - used by {{consumer}} electronics and appliances {{while they are}} turned off - accounts for 5-10% of total household energy consumption, costing $100 annually to the average household in the United States. A study by United States Department of Energy's Berkeley Lab found that a <b>videocassette</b> <b>recorders</b> (<b>VCRs)</b> consume more electricity {{during the course of}} a year in standby mode than when they are used to record or playback videos. Similar findings were obtained concerning satellite boxes, which consume almost the same amount of energy in [...] "on" [...] and [...] "off" [...] modes.|$|R
5000|$|The term online {{originated}} in the telecommunication industry, meaning [...] "Under the direct control of another device" [...] (automation). Online editors such as the Sony BVE-9000 edit control unit used the RS-422 remote control 9-Pin Protocol to allow the computer-interface of edit controllers to control video tape recorders (VTR) via a series of commands. The protocol supports a variety of devices including one-inch reel-to-reel type C videotape as well as <b>videocassette</b> <b>recorders</b> (<b>VCR)</b> to Fast-Forward, Rewind and Play and Record based on SMPTE timecode. The controllers {{have the ability to}} interface with professional audio equipment like audio mixers with console automation.|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} five years the medium of {{videotape}} has grown tremendously. Movies can be rented on videotape from a diverse and ever increasing number of sources, including convenience stores, supermarkets, and even automatic vending machines. Home video earns nearly three times as much annual revenue as the theatrical movie industry, and the video rental market has grown an average of 25 % per year. Some estimate that by 1990 <b>videocassette</b> <b>recorders</b> (<b>VCRs)</b> will be in 78 % percent of American homes and that 50 % of all households will own two VCRs. Home viewing of major productions is now commonplace in America with the typical VCRowning family renting more than six videotapes each month...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{draws upon}} our {{experience}} of converting an existing educational videocassette into a video stream and presents {{a case study of}} the important issues that arose. The process was undertaken to apply some potential benefits of a new technology to support learners in higher education (HE). It was, however, by no means unproblematic and the issues that arose need to receive serious consideration if the potential of streaming technology is to be harnessed for more effective learning opportunities for students. &#x 0027;Streaming&#x 0027; is a way of transmitting video (or other media files) across the Internet (or by similar means). It is an alternative to downloaded delivery of these media and viewers do not have lengthy &#x 0027;download waits&#x 0027;. A more comprehensive definition is provided elsewhere (Brown, 2002). The term used here to describe the processes involved in enabling a video recording, made for delivery via <b>videocassette</b> <b>recorder</b> (<b>VCR),</b> to be transmitted across the Internet is &#x 0027;re-purposing&#x 0027;. One process within this broad remit is that of making specific changes to the content of the video recording. This is referred to as &#x 0027;re-engineering&#x 0027;. The authors all have a strong commitment to the use of video in HE and have actively participated in the re-purposing reported here. They feel that since the Joint Informatio...|$|E
40|$|This article traces {{circuits}} {{of distribution}} {{and consumption of}} <b>videocassette</b> <b>recorders</b> (<b>VCRs)</b> and <b>videocassettes</b> in Cuba, which until April 2008 were not available for retail sale, and were usually sourced through black market or informal means. Based upon ethnographic research conducted in 2003 / 4 with VCR owners and an operator of an informal videocassette rental business, the article argues that understanding the role of video in contemporary Cuba requires a consideration of both {{the political and economic}} implications of being a video consumer and the material properties of VCRs as consumer goods. In the context of post-Soviet Cuba, VCRs and videocassettes exemplify the importance of informal practices and economies, and call attention to increased tensions surrounding consumption that have developed since the economic crisis of the 1990 s...|$|R
5000|$|There was a {{transitional}} analog period using multiple source <b>videocassette</b> <b>recorder</b> (<b>VCR)s</b> with the EditDroid using LaserDisc players, but modern NLE systems edit video digitally captured onto {{a hard drive}} from an analog video or digital video source. Content is ingested and recorded natively with the appropriate codec that the video editing software uses to process captured footage. High-definition video is becoming more popular and can be readily edited using the same video editing software along with related motion graphics programs. Video clips are arranged on a timeline, music tracks, titles, digital on-screen graphics are added, special effects can be created, and the finished program is [...] "rendered" [...] into a finished video. The video may then be distributed {{in a variety of}} ways including DVD, web streaming, QuickTime Movies, iPod, CD-ROM, or video tape.|$|R
5000|$|P2 (P2 is a {{short form}} for [...] "Professional Plug-In") is a {{professional}} digital recording solid-state memory storage media format introduced by Panasonic in 2004, and especially tailored to electronic news-gathering (ENG) applications. It features tapeless (non-linear) recording of DV, DVCPRO, DVCPRO25, DVCPRO50, DVCPRO-HD, or AVC-Intra streams on a solid-state flash memory. The P2 card is essentially a RAID of Secure Digital (SD) memory cards with an LSI controller tightly packaged in a die-cast PC Card (formerly PCMCIA) enclosure, so data transfer rate increases as memory capacity increases. The system includes cameras, decks as drop-in replacements for <b>Videocassette</b> <b>recorders</b> (<b>VCR),</b> and a special 5.25-inch computer drive for random-access integration with non-linear editing systems (NLE). The cards {{can also be used}} directly where a PC card (PCMCIA) slot is available, as in most older notebook computers, as a normal hard disk drive, although a custom software driver must first be loaded.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to estimate current energy use of residential televisions (TVs) and <b>videocassette</b> <b>recorders</b> (<b>VCRs)</b> in the United States. Ownership and usage statistics {{were taken from}} media research, while average power values were derived from power measurements of nearly 500 units, shown in Figure ES- 1. Figure ES- 1. Power levels of TVs and VCRs measured for this study When grouped by product characteristics, these power measurements indicate that TV active power draw {{is closely related to}} screen size (see Table ES- 1) and manufacturer, while TV standby power draw is related only to manufacturer. VCR idle and standby power draw levels are related to manufacturer and year of manufacture: VCR power draw values have been steadily decreasing since 1985. Because of these relationships, average power values were weighted by industry-based estimates of the age, manufacturer, and size distributions of U. S. TVs and VCRs to ensure average power draw estimates that are representative of current U. S. stock. (a) (b...|$|R
2500|$|Bruce Gyngell, {{the former}} {{chairman}} of breakfast station TV-am, [...] became YTT's managing director on 15 May 1995. On 16 March 1996, the presentation department in Newcastle was closed, and continuity was centralised in Leeds. (Transmission for the station had already been handled by Yorkshire since 1993). To halting [...] "a slide in viewing figures and reflecting confidence in the region", in September that year, Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television plc rebranded its stations as Channel 3. The Broadcasting Act 1990 had made Channel 3 the 'official' name for ITV, and [...] "3" [...] was the preset used by most television sets and <b>videocassette</b> <b>recorders</b> (<b>VCRs)</b> for ITV. However, the attempt in 1989 to create a generic identity across the ITV network [...] was decommissioned within three years. Promoting the new brand, Gygnell said, [...] "Everyone refers to this region as 'the North-East' and {{we want it to be}} known that we are part of this great region and moving with it."

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to report on a {{telephone}} survey to 15 professional wildlife damage control workers in 9 of the 10 Great Plains states. North Dakota was the only state that was not contacted. In this survey we asked the following five questions: 1. Do you have any video tapes on wildlife damage control? 2. How many counties are there in your state? 3. How many County Extension Offices have <b>videocassette</b> <b>recorders</b> (<b>VCRs)</b> ? 4. What is your opinion of video tapes? 5. Do you see a future for VCRs in wildlife damage control extension education? Another {{purpose of this}} presentation is to show you a review of short excerpts of some wildlife damage control extension education video tapes. Only 3 of 9 states currently have wildlife damage control video tapes. The 9 states represented in this survey contained about 763 counties. Nearly all of the county extension offices have or soon will have the capability to show video tapes. It is estimated that in homes with television sets in the United States, nearly one third have VCRs...|$|R
50|$|The {{electromagnetic}} {{arrangement of}} a tape head is generally similar for all types, though the physical design varies considerably {{depending on the}} application - for example <b>videocassette</b> <b>recorders</b> (<b>VCR)</b> use rotating heads which implement a helical scan, whereas most audio recorders have fixed heads. A head consists of a core of magnetic material arranged into a doughnut shape or toroid, into which a very narrow gap has been let. This gap is filled with a diamagnetic material, such as gold. This forces the magnetic flux out of the gap into the magnetic tape medium more than air would (it also prevents the gap filling with rubbed off material from the tape which would have the reverse effect). The flux thus magnetises the tape at that point. A coil of wire wrapped around the core opposite the gap interfaces to the electrical side of the apparatus; thus either supplying a signal {{in the case of}} recording, or being fed to an amplifier in the case of playback. The basic head design is fully reversible - a variable magnetic field at the gap will induce an electric current in the coil, and an electric current in the coil will induce a magnetic field in the core and hence in the tape drawn across the gap.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} talked about trends in media and {{communications}} studies {{over the past decade}} has been the rise of the so-called new media. 1 The phrase "new media " is, of course, a relative one. At one time, the printing press would have been considered a new medium; the same could have been said about radio in the 1920 s and television in the 1950 s. In its most recent incarnation, however, the phrase has been widely adopted to refer to a series of scientific and technological innovations, most of which achieved critical mass in the early 1970 s, that {{led to the development of}} a considerable number of new methods for creating, transmitting, and storing information and to the large-scale transformation of many of the more traditional media. Among the technologies usually included under the "new media " rubric are personal computers, <b>videocassette</b> <b>recorders</b> (<b>VCRs),</b> videotex and tele-text, fax machines, car phones, satellites and satellite dishes, remote control devices, videodiscs, compact discs, modems, telephone an-swering machines, electronic mail, cable TV, and interactive televi-sion. Though academic researchers were initially slow to pick up on these developments, a considerable body of writing has recently begun to accumulate, examining the characteristics of the new media and the impacts they are likely to have on the way Americans work, learn, conduct their politics, and spend their leisure time (see, among others...|$|R
40|$|Eds.), Handbook of {{contemporary}} families (pp. 506 - 520). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. ―[T]he American family {{during the past}} 25 years has entered a new world of rapid change ‖ (p. 415) wrote Ernest Burgess in 1928 as he reflected on the introduction into society of technologies such as the automobile, motion pictures, radios, airplanes, and telephones. A review of any decade of the 20 th century would include the introduction of an array of technological developments, including radio, television, <b>videocassette</b> <b>recorders</b> (<b>VCRs),</b> microwave ovens, air conditioners, refrigerators, personal computers, and the Internet. Less than two decades ago, computers were primarily used in science, engineering, and business, and the Internet was {{the province of the}} military. Yet in 2001, 57 % of all households had a computer, and 51 % had direct access to the Internet (National Telecommunications and Information Administration [NTIA], 2002). Social critics and technologists have been active in discussing the implications of these changes for individuals, families, work, and society. There are those who see computers and the Internet as a positive force that will foster greater communication and better access to education, promote global understanding, and {{make the world a better}} place to live (Rheingold, 1993). Some also believe that the Internet will lead to better social relationships because people will be freed from the constraints of time and plac...|$|R
5000|$|The first {{consumer}} <b>videocassette</b> <b>recorders</b> (<b>VCR)</b> {{were launched}} in 1971 (based around Sony U-matic technology). Philips entered {{the domestic market}} the following year with the N1500. Sony's Betamax (1975) and JVC's VHS (1976) created a mass-market for VCRs and the two competing systems battled the [...] "videotape format war", which VHS ultimately won. At first VCRs were very expensive, but by the late 1980s the price had come down enough to make them affordable to a mainstream audience. Videocassettes finally {{made it possible for}} consumers to buy or rent a complete film and watch it at home whenever they wished, rather than simply catching it at a movie theater or having to wait until it was telecast. It also made it possible for a VCR owner to begin time-shifting the recording of films and other television programs straight from the transmission. This caused an enormous change in viewing practices, as one no longer had to wait for a repeat of a program that had been missed. The shift to home viewing also changed the movie industry's revenue streams, because home renting created an additional window of time in which a film could make money. In some cases, films that did only modestly in their theater releases went on to have strong performance in the rental market (e.g., cult films).|$|R
