5|$|After {{a search}} {{that had taken}} several years, Wheeler was able to secure a {{premises}} for the Institute of Archaeology: St. John's Lodge in Regent's Park, central London. Left empty since its use as a hospital during the First World War, the building was owned by the Crown and was controlled by the First Commissioner of Works, William Ormsby-Gore; he was <b>very</b> <b>sympathetic</b> to archaeology, and leased the building to the Institute at a low rent. The St. John's Lodge premises were officially opened on 29 April 1937. During his speech at the ceremony, the University of London's Vice-Chancellor Charles Reed Peers {{made it clear that}} the building was only intended as a temporary home for the Institute, which it was hoped would be able to move to Bloomsbury, the city's academic hub. In his speech, the university's Chancellor, Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone, compared the new institution to both the Institute of Historical Research and the Courtauld Institute of Art.|$|E
5|$|After the Third Partition of Poland (1795), many Poles {{believed}} that revolutionary France, whose public opinion was <b>very</b> <b>sympathetic</b> to {{the ideals of}} the Polish Constitution of 3 May 1791, would come to Poland's aid. France's enemies included Poland's partitioners, Prussia, Austria and Imperial Russia. Paris was the seat of two Polish organizations laying the claim to be the Polish government-in-exile, the Deputation (Deputacja) of Franciszek Ksawery Dmochowski and the Agency (Agencja) of Józef Wybicki. Many Polish soldiers, officers and volunteers therefore emigrated, especially to Italy and to France. Eventually, the Agency was successful in convincing the French government (the Directory) to organize a Polish military unit. As the French Constitution did not allow for the employment of foreign troops on French soil, the French decided to use the Poles to bolster their allies in Italy, the Cisalpine Republic.|$|E
25|$|At {{the home}} of the {{landlord}}, Xi'er is forced to work day and night as a slave and is exhausted. Zhang Ershen (literally Second Aunt Zhang), an elderly maid of the landlord, is <b>very</b> <b>sympathetic</b> of Xi'er. Xi'er dozes off while trying to take a short break. The mother of the landlord comes on the scene and, with her hairpin, pokes Xi'er's face to wake her up. The landlord mother then orders Xi'er to prepare her a lotus seed soup. When the soup is served, the landlord mother, displeased with the taste, pours the still-boiling soup on Xi'er's face. Outraged by the pain and anger, Xi'er picks up the whip that the landlord uses to punish her, and beats up the landlord mother. The landlord mother falls and crawls on the floor attempting to flee while Xi'er continues to whip her with her utmost strength. Xi'er gets her vengeance, but she is subsequently locked up by the landlord.|$|E

25|$|The crisis {{remained}} unresolved mostly due to {{the warm}} support given to Vichaichan by the Acting-Consul Newman and his staff. Vichaichan thus waited for British intervention and refused all reconciliation with Chulalongkorn. After the crisis reached stalemate, Si Suriyawongse advised the Consulate to seek assistance by inviting an influential person to intervene. On 5 January, Newman contacted Sir Andrew Clarke the Governor of the Straits Settlements to Bangkok presumably to mediate. Chulalongkorn himself had earlier written to Clarke {{at the beginning of}} the crisis in an effort to rally foreign support for himself. Clarke as it turned out was <b>very</b> <b>sympathetic</b> to the King's reforms and situation. The king and Clarke had personally met in 1873, when the king had his second coronation after receiving his majority. During that trip Clarke was extremely impressed with the young King's zeal for reform and his modern attitudes, particularly his abolition of the prostration and crawling required by subjects in the presence of the King. Clarke immediately requested instructions from London, pointing out that if Britain did not intervene then France would. The Colonial Secretary Lord Carnarvon quickly directed Clarke to go to Bangkok as soon as possible, for as Newman reported:"There is little likelihood of a settlement being effected, and trade and commerce are in a great measure stopped".|$|E
500|$|The {{mainstream}} press attacked Benn for using language deemed as intemperate as Powell's language in his [...] "Rivers of Blood" [...] speech (which was {{widely regarded as}} racist), and Benn noted in his diary that [...] "letters began pouring in on the Powell speech: 2:1 against me but some <b>very</b> <b>sympathetic</b> ones saying that my speech was overdue". Harold Wilson later reprimanded Benn for this speech, accusing him of losing Labour seats in the 1970 general election.|$|E

500|$|Although {{many critics}} {{identify}} some flaws, often comparing Szwarc negatively to Spielberg, {{they say that}} [...] "this sequel does have some redeeming qualities going for it that make it a good movie in its own right". Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw are missed, especially since the teenage characters are labeled [...] "largely annoying 'Afterschool Special' archetypes" [...] who are [...] "irritating and incessantly screaming" [...] and [...] "don't make for <b>very</b> <b>sympathetic</b> victims". Because of its emphasis upon the teenage cast, some critics have compared the film to the popular slasher films that would soon follow. Also comparing the film's [...] "interchangeable teens to slasher films, particularly the Friday the 13th franchise, Muir says that [...] "it feels wrong for a Jaws film to dwell in that shallow domain." [...] However, the critic also commends the teen characters' comradeship and heroism, citing the girl killed when saving Sean from the shark.|$|E
500|$|However, MacFarlane {{was criticized}} for his {{portrayal}} of transsexualism in the Family Guy episode [...] "Quagmire's Dad". Gay novelist Brent Hartinger found the episode's inclusion of transphobic remarks from Peter and Lois Griffin — {{as well as a}} scene of Brian vomiting profusely upon discovering his new girlfriend to be Glenn Quagmire's father – to be [...] "shockingly insensitive". Hartinger continued, [...] "Frankly, it's literally impossible for me to reconcile last night's episode with MacFarlane's words, unless I {{come to the conclusion that}} the man is pretty much a complete idiot". The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, a LGBT media watchdog organization, shared [...] "serious concerns being voiced from members of the community" [...] about the episode. MacFarlane said he was [...] "surprised" [...] by the negative reaction to [...] "Quagmire's Dad", saying that [...] "it seemed that [...] were not picking up on the fact that it was a <b>very</b> <b>sympathetic</b> portrayal of a transsexual character". He further added, [...] "Look, Brian happens to be a heterosexual character, as I am. If I found out that I had slept with a transsexual, I might throw up in the same way that a gay guy looks at a vagina and goes, 'Oh, my God, that's disgusting.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The cabinet {{responsible}} for enacting the law abolishing slavery suffered {{a vote of}} no confidence on 3 May 1889 {{and was forced to}} resign. Pedro II called José Antônio Saraiva to form a new cabinet. Saraiva, a highly pragmatic politician, cared neither for monarchy nor republic, so long as he held power. He frankly warned the Emperor that Isabel had little chance of reigning as empress and that the government itself should {{take an active role in}} facilitating a peaceful transition to a republic. The Emperor accepted this proposal, without bothering to inform his daughter and heiress. Pedro II's behavior in this meeting revealed how little commitment he had to the monarchy. He gave little consideration to his daughter's opinion, or that of the Brazilian people who overwhelmingly supported the imperial system. The reason, unknown to but a very few, was that Pedro II was <b>very</b> <b>sympathetic</b> towards the idea of a republican system. Through action and inaction, consciously and unconsciously, he had been sabotaging both the monarchy and the prospects of his daughter's future reign for nearly a decade. A quite astonished historian Heitor Lyra remarked: [...] "Was he not the head of the Brazilian monarchy, it would be said that he had been allied with the Republic's advertisers!" [...] Saraiva, however, changed his mind and declined the office. Pedro II instead appointed Afonso Celso de Assis Figuereido, viscount of Ouro Preto, in his place.|$|E

5000|$|The {{patient with}} {{pheochromocytoma}} is invariably volume depleted. In other words, the chronically elevated adrenergic state characteristic of an untreated pheochromocytoma leads to near-total inhibition of renin-angiotensin activity, resulting in excessive fluid {{loss in the}} urine and thus reduced blood volume. Hence, once the pheochromocytoma has been resected, thereby removing {{the major source of}} circulating catecholamines, a situation arises where there is both <b>very</b> low <b>sympathetic</b> activity and volume depletion. This can result in profound hypotension. Therefore, it is usually advised to [...] "salt load" [...] pheochromocytoma patients before their surgery. This may consist of simple interventions such as consumption of high salt food pre-operatively, direct salt replacement or through the administration of intravenous saline solution.|$|R
500|$|By the 1980s, critics {{emphasised}} {{the power}} of the poem's message and technique, and it was seen as an important English poem. After analyzing the language of the poem, W. Hutchings declared in 1984, [...] "The epitaph, then, is still making us think, still disturbing us, even as it uses the language of conventional Christianity and conventional epitaphs. Gray does not want to round his poem off neatly, because death is an experience of which we cannot be certain, but also because the logic of his syntax demands continuity rather than completion." [...] Also in 1984, Anne Williams claimed, [...] "ever since publication it has been both popular and universally admired. Few readers then or now would dispute Dr. Johnson's appraisal... In the twentieth century we have remained eager to praise, yet praise has proved difficult; although tradition and general human experience affirm that the poem is a masterpiece, and although one could hardly wish a single word changed, it seems surprisingly resistant to analysis. It is lucid, and at first appears as seamless and smooth as monumental alabaster." [...] Harold Bloom, in 1987, claimed, [...] "What moves me most about the superb Elegy is the quality that, following Milton, it shares with so many of the major elegies down to Walt Whitman's... Call this quality the pathos of a poetic death-in-life, the fear that one either has lost one's gift before life has ebbed, or that one may lose life before the poetic gift has expressed itself fully. This strong pathos of Gray's Elegy achieves a central position as the antithetical tradition that truly mourns primarily a loss of the self." [...] In 1988, Morris Golden, after describing Gray as a [...] "poet's poet" [...] and places him [...] "within the pantheon of those poets with whom familiarity is inescapable for anyone educated in the English language" [...] declared that in [...] "the 'Elegy Written in a Country Church-yard,' mankind has felt itself to be directly addressed by a <b>very</b> <b>sympathetic,</b> human voice." [...] He later pointed out: [...] "Gray's 'Elegy' was universally admired in his lifetime and has remained continuously the most popular of mid-eighteenth-century English poems; it is, as Gosse has called it, the standard English poem. The reason for this extraordinary unanimity of praise are as varied as the ways in which poetry can appeal. The 'Elegy' is a beautiful technical accomplishment, as can be seen even in such details as the variation of the vowel sounds or the poet's rare discretion in the choice of adjectives and adverbs. Its phrasing is both elegant and memorable, as is evident from the incorporation of much of it into the living language." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hill later said, [...] "I was <b>very</b> <b>sympathetic</b> and {{identified}} with the New Hollywood." [...] But his films [...] "are, or were, rather retro. That is to say, I didn't tackle subjects. I wanted to do genre films." ...|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the episodes}} {{covering}} the rape received criticism for showing the police as unsympathetic and unhelpful to a rape victim. Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Peter Imbert, said {{a scene in}} which Kathy was questioned following her rape was [...] "out of date and would do nothing to encourage reporting this despicable crime". The story, however, continued in the next episode, when Kathy reached the police station and received <b>very</b> <b>sympathetic</b> treatment from a male detective and a WPC. Tony McHale had researched the subject in depth with the police and was determined to portray the broad range of ways that the police dealt with the serious subject of rape. A senior woman police officer later congratulated the programme on its even-handed and honest portrayal of the incident.|$|E
2500|$|In 1933 Chicharro {{was active}} {{mixing with the}} Alfonsist monarchists in the Tradicionalistas y Renovación Española alliance; by the local Castellon Liaison Committee he was agreed to {{represent}} it in the forthcoming elections. This gained him hostility among new radical Carlist activists like Jaime del Burgo, who despised fraternization with caciques and debris of the Alfonsine monarchy. Moreover, for the Carlist youth the landowners like Lamamié and Chicharro became marked men as privileged section of politically dominant potentates, who are [...] "obstructing the Agrarian Reform by the feudal egoism of the odious grandees of grain". Though indeed within Carlism Chicharro formed the most reactionary faction, conservatism did not render him averse to new radical social movements. Discussing Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler he declared that Traditionalism, “though not {{one and the same}} thing, is <b>very</b> <b>sympathetic</b> towards them, as they are waging war against Judaism, freemasonry and Marxism, building an organized corporative state. What is inacceptable to us is the state's overwhelming sovereignty and dominance.

2500|$|Besides the two men, since 1908 Jamiat Kheir {{members also}} wrote about Islamic {{movements}} in Indonesia, {{about what they}} perceived as the Dutch East Indies government repression against the Muslim population of Indonesia.
