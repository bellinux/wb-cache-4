40|$|Abstract Background Recent trials {{suggest that}} angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) are {{effective}} in prevention of ischemic stroke, as measured by reduced stroke incidence. We aimed to compare stroke severity between stroke patients who were taking ACEI before their stroke onset {{and those who were}} not, {{to examine the effects of}} pretreatment with ACEI on ischemic stroke severity. Methods We retrospectively studied 126 consecutive patients presenting within 24 hours of ischemic stroke onset, as confirmed by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI). We calculated the NIHSS score at presentation, as the primary measure of clinical stroke severity, and categorized stroke severity as mild (NIHSS [less than or equal to] 7), moderate (NIHSS 8 – 13) or severe (NIHSS [greater than or equal to] 14). We analyzed demographic data, risk-factor profile, blood pressure (BP) and medications on admissions, and determined stroke mechanism according to TOAST criteria. We also measured the <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>admission</b> diffusion- and perfusion-weighted (DWI /PWI) magnetic resonance imaging lesions, as a secondary measure of ischemic tissue volume. We compared these variables among patients on ACEI and those who were not. Results Thirty- three patients (26 %) were on ACE-inhibitors. The overall median baseline NIHSS score was 5. 5 (range 2 – 21) among ACEI-treated patients vs. 9 (range 1 – 36) in non-ACEI patients (p = 0. 036). Patients on ACEI prior to their stroke had more mild and less severe strokes, and smaller DWI and PWI lesion volumes compared to non-ACEI treated patients. However, none of these differences were significant. Predictably, a higher percentage of patients on ACEI had a history of heart failure (p = 0. 03). Age, time-to-imaging or neurological evaluation, risk-factor profile, concomitant therapy with lipid lowering, other antihypertensives or antithrombotic agents, or admission BP were comparable between the two groups. Conclusion Our results suggest that ACE-inhibitors may reduce the clinical severity of stroke, as measured by NIHSS score. Further, larger-scale, prospective studies areneeded to validate our findings, and to elucidate the mechanism(s) of ACEImediated benefits in patients with ischemic stroke. </p...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} hospital {{responses to}} changes in diagnosis-specific prices by exploiting a 1988 policy reform that generated large price changes for 43 percent <b>of</b> Medicare <b>admissions.</b> I find hospitals responded primarily by "upcoding" patients to diagnosis codes with the largest price increases. This response was particularly strong among for-profit hospitals. I find little evidence hospitals increased the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>admissions</b> differentially for diagnoses subject to the largest price increases, despite the financial incentive to do so. Neither did they increase intensity or quality of care in these diagnoses, suggesting hospitals do not compete for patients at the diagnosis level. ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: to {{describe}} hospital pharmacy involvement in medication management in Ireland, both generally and at points of transfer of care, {{and to gain}} a broad perspective of the hospital pharmacy workforce. METHODS: a survey of all adult, acute, public hospitals with an accident and emergency (A&E) department (n = 36), using a semi-structured telephone interview. KEY FINDINGS: there was a 97 % (n = 35) response rate. The majority (n = 25, 71. 4 %) of hospitals reported delivery of a clinical pharmacy service. On admission, pharmacists were involved in taking or verifying medication histories in a minority (n = 15, 42. 9 %) of hospitals, while few (n = 6, 17. 1 %) deployed staff to the A&E/acute medical admissions unit. On discharge, the majority (n = 30, 85. 7 %) did not supply any take-out medication, a minority (n = 5, 14. 3 %) checked the discharge prescription, 51. 4 % (n = 18) counselled patients, 42. 9 % (n = 15) provided medication compliance charts and one hospital (2. 9 %) communicated with the patient's community pharmacy. The number of staff employed in the pharmacy department in each hospital was not proportionate {{to the number of}} inpatient beds, nor the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>admissions</b> from A&E. There were differences identified in service delivery between hospitals of different type: urban hospitals with a high <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>admissions</b> from A&E were more likely to deliver clinical pharmacy. CONCLUSIONS: the frequency and consistency of delivering pharmacy services to facilitate medication reconciliation at admission and discharge could be improved. Workforce constraints may inhibit service expansion. Development of national standards of practice may help to eliminate variation between hospitals and support service development...|$|R

40|$|Objective Physician {{participation}} in Continuing Medical Education programs {{may be influenced}} by a number of factors. To evaluate the factors associated with compliance with the Continuing Medical Education requirements at a private hospital, we investigated whether physicians&# 8217; activity, measured by <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> <b>admissions</b> and procedures, was associated with obtaining 40 Continuing Medical Education credits (40 hours of activities) in a 12 -month cycle. Methods In an exclusive and non-mandatory Continuing Medical Education program, we collected physicians&# 8217; numbers <b>of</b> hospital <b>admissions</b> and numbers <b>of</b> surgical procedures performed. We also analyzed data on physicians&# 8217; time since graduation, age, and gender. Results A total of 3, 809 credentialed, free-standing, private practice physicians were evaluated. Univariate analysis showed that the Continuing Medical Education requirements {{were more likely to be}} achieved by male physicians (odds ratio 1. 251; p= 0. 009) and who had a higher number <b>of</b> hospital <b>admissions</b> (odds ratio 1. 022; p< 0. 001). Multivariate analysis showed that age and number <b>of</b> hospital <b>admissions</b> were associated with achievement of the Continuing Medical Education requirements. Each hospital admission increased the chance of achieving the requirements by 0. 4 %. Among physicians who performed surgical procedures, multivariate analysis showed that male physicians were 1. 3 time more likely to achieve the Continuing Medical Education requirements than female physicians. Each surgical procedure performed increased the chance of achieving the requirements by 1. 4 %. Conclusion The numbers <b>of</b> <b>admissions</b> and number <b>of</b> surgical procedures performed by physicians at our hospital were associated with the likelihood of meeting the Continuing Medical Education requirements. These findings help to shed new light on our Continuing Medical Education program...|$|R
5000|$|Although it may {{initially}} {{appear that}} {{students of color}} are the most favored of all the groups in terms <b>of</b> college <b>admissions,</b> in practice, the widespread favoring of legacies has greatly reduced acceptance rates for black, Latino, and Asian-American applicants because {{the overwhelming majority of}} legacy students are white. According to a 2008 study, Duke's legacies {{are more likely to be}} white, Protestant, American citizens, and private high-school graduates than the overall student body. They are also significantly richer, with a familial income of $250,000 per year. In 2000-2001, of 567 alumni children attending Princeton, 10 were Latino and 4 were black. Similarly, a 2005 study reported that half the legacy applicants to selective colleges boasted family incomes in the top quartile of American earnings, compared to 29% of non-legacy students. In 2003, Texas A & M--which no longer practices legacy admissions—enrolled 312 white students and only 27 Latino and 6 black students who would not have been admitted if not for their family ties. When a large number of legacies are admitted to post-secondary institutions, the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>admissions</b> who are people of color or who are from working classes plummets. Since 1983, there have been formal complaints to The Education Department's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) that Asian-American applicants are being rejected in favor of students with lesser credentials.|$|R
40|$|Background: Clinical major adverse {{cardiovascular}} event (MACE) {{prediction of}} {{acute coronary syndrome}} (ACS) is important {{for a number of}} applications including physician decision support, quality of care assessment, and efficient healthcare service delivery on ACS patients. Admission records, as typical media to contain clinical information of patients at the early stage of their hospitalizations, provide significant potential to be explored for MACE prediction in a proactive manner. Methods: We propose a hybrid approach for MACE prediction by utilizing a large <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>admission</b> records. Firstly, both a rule-based medical language processing method and a machine learning method (i. e., Conditional Random Fields (CRFs)) are developed to extract essential patient features from unstructured admission records. After that, state-of-the-art supervised machine learning algorithms are applied to construct MACE prediction models from data. Results: We comparatively evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on a real clinical dataset consisting of 2930 ACS patient samples collected from a Chinese hospital. Our best model achieved 72 % AUC in MACE prediction. In comparison of the performance between our models and two well-known ACS risk score tools, i. e., GRACE and TIMI, our learned models obtain better performances with a significant margin. Conclusions: Experimental results reveal that our approach can obtain competitive performance in MACE prediction. The comparison of classifiers indicates the proposed approach has a competitive generality with datasets extracted by different feature extraction methods. Furthermore, our MACE prediction model obtained a significant improvement by comparison with both GRACE and TIMI. It indicates that using admission records can effectively provide MACE prediction service for ACS patients at the early stage of their hospitalizations...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Critical care {{represents}} {{a large percentage}} of healthcare spending in developed countries. Yet, little is known regarding international variation in critical care services. We sought to understand differences in critical care delivery by comparing data on the distribution of services in eight countries. Design: Retrospective review of existing national administrative data. We identified sources of data in each country to provide information on acute care hospitals and beds, intensive care units and beds, intensive care <b>admissions,</b> and definitions <b>of</b> intensive care beds. Data were all referenced and from as close to 2005 as possible. Setting: United States, France, United Kingdom, Canada, Belgium, Germany, The Netherlands, and Spain. Patients: Not available. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: No standard definition existed for acute care hospital or intensive care unit beds across countries. Hospital beds varied three-fold from 221 / 100, 000 population in the United States to 593 / 100, 000 in Germany. Adult intensive care unit beds also ranged seven-fold from 3. 3 / 100, 000 population in the United Kingdom to 24. 0 / 100, 000 in Germany. <b>Volume</b> <b>of</b> intensive care unit admissions per year varied ten-fold from 216 / 100, 000 population in the United Kingdom to 2353 / 100, 000 in Germany. The ratio of intensive care unit beds to hospital beds was highly correlated across all countries except the United States (r =. 90). There was minimal correlation between the number of intensive care unit beds per capita and health care spending per capita (r =. 45), but high inverse correlation between intensive care unit beds and hospital mortality for intensive care unit patients across countries (r = -. 82). Conclusions: Absolute critical care services vary dramatically between countries with wide differences in both numbers <b>of</b> beds and <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> <b>admissions.</b> The number <b>of</b> intensive care unit beds per capita is not strongly correlated with overall health expenditure, but does correlate strongly with mortality. These findings demonstrate the need for critical care data from all countries, as they are essential for interpretation of studies, and policy decisions regarding critical care service...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE To analyze if the {{adjusted}} hospital mortality {{varies according to}} source of payment <b>of</b> hospital <b>admissions,</b> legal nature, and financing settlement of hospitals. METHODS Cros-ssectional study with information source in administrative databases. Specific hospital admission reasons were selected considering the <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> hospital <b>admissions</b> and the list of quality indicators proposed by the North-American Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Were analyzed 852, 864 hospital <b>admissions</b> <b>of</b> adults, occurred in 789 hospitals between 2008 and 2010, in Sao Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul, applying multilevel logistic regression. RESULTS At hospital admission level, showed higher chances of death male patients in more advanced age groups, with comorbidity, who used intensive care unit, and had the Brazilian Unified Health System as source of payment. At the level of hospitals, in those located in {{the mean of the}} distribution, {{the adjusted}} probability of death in hospital admissions financed by plan or private was 5. 0 %, against 9. 0 % when reimbursed by the Brazilian Unified Health System. This probability increased in hospital admissions financed by the Brazilian Unified Health System in hospitals to two standard deviations above the mean, reaching 29. 0 %. CONCLUSIONS In addition to structural characteristics of the hospitals and the profile of the patients, interventions aimed at improving care should also consider the coverage of the population by health plans, the network shared between beneficiaries of plans and users of the Brazilian Unified Health System, the standard of care to the various sources of payment by hospitals and, most importantly, how these factors influence the clinical performance...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effects of}} selected characteristics of hospitals and physicians on the mortality rates of heart patients who survive their first day in the hospital. Separate multivariate regression analyses are conducted for three groups: (1) patients who undergo a direct heart revascularization or {{coronary artery bypass graft}} (CABG) operation; (2) patients who undergo a cardiac catheterization and do not undergo a CABG operation; and (3) patients with a principal diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) who do not undergo surgery. The number of patients in each group treated by specific physicians, and the number treated in specific hospitals, measure provider experience with similar patients. Other hypothesized determinants of in-hospital mortality include: (1) patient severity of illness, age, sex, and the presence of comorbidities; (2) hospital ownership, size, location, teaching status, resources expended, and the presence of a coronary care unit; and (3) board certification status of the attending physician or surgeon who operated. Empirical results show that presence of a coronary care unit decreases the chance that CABG patients will die in the hospital but is not significant for other heart patients included in this study. Patients with atherosclerosis who receive a CABG or a cardiac catheterization procedure are more likely to survive in hospitals with high <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> these procedures. However, hospital <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> AMI <b>admissions</b> was not a factor in survival; AMI patients are more likely to survive when their attending physicians treat high <b>volumes</b> <b>of</b> AMI patients. Also, AMI patients whose physicians are board certified in family practice or in internal medicine are less likely to die compared to AMI patients with physicians not board certified. Similarly, AMI patients hospitalized in teaching facilities are less likely to die compared to AMI patients in hospitals not affiliated with a medical school...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The high <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> {{emergency}} <b>admissions</b> {{to hospital}} {{is a challenge}} for health systems internationally. Patients with lung cancer and {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) are frequently admitted to hospital as emergency cases. While the frequency <b>of</b> emergency <b>admission</b> has been investigated, few studies report patient experiences, particularly in relation to the decision-making process prior to emergency admission. We sought to explore patient and carer experiences and those of their healthcare professionals in the period leading up to emergency admission to hospital. Setting: 3 UK hospitals located in different urban and rural settings. Design: Qualitative critical incident study. Participants: 24 patients with advanced lung cancer and 15 with advanced COPD admitted to hospital as emergencies, 20 of their carers and 50 of the health professionals involved in the patients' care. Results: The analysis of patient, carer and professionals' interviews revealed a detailed picture of the complex processes involved leading to emergency admission to hospital. 3 phases were apparent in this period: self-management of deteriorating symptoms, negotiated decision-making and letting go. These were dynamic processes, characterised by an often rapidly changing clinical condition, uncertainty and anxiety. Patients considered their options drawing on experience, current and earlier advice. Patients tried to avoid admission, reluctantly accepting it, albeit often with a sense of relief, as anxiety increased with worsening symptoms. Conclusions: Patients with advanced respiratory illness, and their carers, try to avoid emergency admission, and use logical and complex decision-making before reluctantly accepting it. Clinicians and policy-makers need to understand this complex process when considering how to reduce emergency hospital admissions rather than focusing on identifying and labelling admissions as 'inappropriate'...|$|R

40|$|Background: Intravenous {{thrombolytic}} therapy after {{ischaemic stroke}} significantly reduces mortality and morbidity. Actual thrombolysis rates are disappointingly low in many western countries. It {{has been suggested}} that higher patient volume is related to shorter door-to-needle-time (DNT) and increased thrombolysis rates. We address a twofold research question: a) What are trends in national thrombolysis rates and door-to-needle times in the Netherlands between 2005 - 2012 ? and b) Is there a relationship between stroke patient volume per hospital, thrombolysis rates and DNT? Methods: We used data from the Stroke Knowledge Network Netherlands dataset. Information on volume, intravenous thrombolysis rates, and admission characteristics per hospital is acquired through yearly surveys, in up to 65 hospitals between January 2005 and December 2012. We used linear regression to determine a possible relationship between hospital stroke admission volume, hospital thrombolysis rates and mean hospital DNT, adjusted for patient characteristics. Results: Information on 121. 887 stroke admissions was available, ranging from 7. 393 admissions in 2005 to 24. 067 admissions in 2012. Mean national thrombolysis rate increased from 6. 4 % in 2005 to 14. 6 % in 2012. Patient characteristics (mean age, gender, type of stroke) remained stable. Mean DNT decreased from 72. 7 min in 2005 to 41. 4 min in 2012. <b>Volume</b> <b>of</b> stroke <b>admissions</b> was not an independent predictor for mean thrombolysis rate nor for mean DNT.

40|$|Objective: Patients {{admitted}} as emergencies {{to hospitals}} {{at the weekend}} have higher death rates than patients admitted on weekdays. This may be because the restricted service availability at weekends leads to selection of patients with greater average severity of illness. We examined <b>volumes</b> and rates <b>of</b> hospital <b>admissions</b> and deaths across the week for patients presenting to emergency services through two routes: (a) hospital Accident and Emergency departments, which are open throughout the week; and (b) services in the community, for which availability is more restricted at weekends. Method: Retrospective observational study of all 140 non-specialist acute hospital Trusts in England analysing 12, 670, 788 Accident and Emergency attendances and 4, 656, 586 emergency admissions (940, 859 direct admissions from primary care and 3, 715, 727 admissions through Accident and Emergency) between April 2013 and February 2014. Emergency attendances and admissions to hospital and deaths in any hospital within 30 days <b>of</b> attendance or <b>admission</b> were compared for weekdays and weekends. Results: Similar numbers of patients attended Accident and Emergency on weekends and weekdays. There were similar numbers of deaths amongst patients attending Accident and Emergency on weekend days compared with weekdays (378. 0 vs. 388. 3). Attending Accident and Emergency at the weekend {{was not associated with}} a significantly higher probability of death (risk-adjusted OR: 1. 010). Proportionately fewer patients who attended Accident and Emergency at weekend were admitted to hospital (27. 5 % vs. 30. 0 %) and it is only amongst the subset of patients attending Accident and Emergency who were selected for admission to hospital that the probability of dying was significantly higher at the weekend (risk-adjusted OR: 1. 054). The average <b>volume</b> <b>of</b> direct <b>admissions</b> from services in the community was 61 % lower on weekend days compared to weekdays (1317 vs. 3404). There were fewer deaths following direct admission on weekend days than weekdays (35. 9 vs. 80. 8). The mortality rate was significantly higher at weekends amongst direct admissions (risk-adjusted OR: 1. 212) due to the proportionately greater reduction in admissions relative to deaths. Conclusions: There are fewer deaths following hospital admission at weekends. Higher mortality rates at weekends are found only amongst the subset of patients who are admitted. The reduced availability of primary care services and the higher Accident and Emergency admission threshold at weekends mean fewer and sicker patients are admitted at weekends than during the week. Extending services in hospitals and in the community at weekends may increase the number <b>of</b> emergency <b>admissions</b> and therefore lower mortality, but may not reduce the absolute number of deaths...|$|R

Models were adjusted for patient age, sex, race, comorbidities, socioeconomic status, hospital region, location (urban versus rural), and teaching status, procedural <b>volume,</b> year <b>of</b> <b>admission,</b> and the proportion of patients who underwent ventriculostomy. Subsequent models were also adjusted for time to aneurysm repair and time to ventriculostomy; subgroup analyses evaluated for those who underwent endovascular and surgical procedures separately. 15, 557 hospitalizations were included. In the initial model, the adjusted odds of in-hospital mortality were higher for Medicare (OR 1. 23, p< 0. 001), Medicaid (OR 1. 23, p< 0. 001), and uninsured patients (OR 1. 49, p< 0. 001) compared to those with private insurance. After also adjusting for timing of intervention, Medicaid and uninsured patients had a reduced odds of non-routine discharge (OR 0. 75, p< 0. 001 and OR 0. 42, p< 0. 001) despite longer hospital stays (by 8. 35 days, p< 0. 001 and 2. 45 days, p = 0. 005). Variations in outcomes by primary payer-including in-hospital post-procedural mortality-were more pronounced for patients of all insurance types who underwent microsurgical clipping. The observed differences by primary payer are likely multifactorial, attributable to varied socioeconomic factors and the complexities of the American healthcare delivery system...|$|R
