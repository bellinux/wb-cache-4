40|$|The {{method of}} {{mathematical}} modeling of <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> {{with the help}} of hull girder is presented. The technique of solution of equation of engine <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> coil oscillations using numerical integration is generally considered. The analysis of theoretical and experimental research of VAZ <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> coil oscillations by the example of rigid valve actuating gear is also given...|$|R
50|$|Poppet valves {{typically}} require small coil <b>springs,</b> appropriately named <b>valve</b> <b>springs,</b> to {{keep them}} closed when not actuated by the camshaft. They {{are attached to the}} valve stem ends, seating within spring retainers. Other mechanisms can be used in place of <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> to keep the valves closed: Formula 1 engines employ pneumatic <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> in which pneumatic pressure closes the valves, while motorcycle manufacturer Ducati uses desmodromic valve drive which mechanically close the valves.|$|R
50|$|The Mazda FE-DOHC uses a wide-angle, DOHC, {{belt-driven}} valvetrain configuration with flat-tappet 33 mm HLA bucket lifters. It is a interference design. There are two <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> per <b>valve</b> {{and four}} valves per cylinder. While a dual <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> configuration is used, the stock springs are fairly low-sprung. Low spring rates {{were chosen for}} increased valvetrain longevity and low friction with the dual <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> for the reduction of harmonics and increased valve stability.|$|R

50|$|Shot peening is {{a crucial}} process in spring making. Types of springs include leaf springs, {{extension}} springs, and compression springs. The most widely used application are for engine <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> (compression springs) due to high cyclic fatigue. In an OEM <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> application, the mechanical design combined with some shot peening ensures longevity. Automotive makers are shifting to more high performance higher stressed <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> designs as engines evolve. In aftermarket high performance <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> applications, the need for controlled and multi-step shot peening is a requirement to withstand extreme surface stresses that sometimes exceeds material specifications. The fatigue life of an extreme performance spring (NHRA, IHRA) can be as short as two passes on a 1/4 mile drag racing track before relaxation or failure occurs.|$|R
5000|$|Lower <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> load reduces <b>valve</b> train {{friction}} (performance).|$|R
50|$|Stiffer <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> {{can help}} prevent valve float and valve bounce, but only {{at the expense of}} {{increased}} friction losses and higher stresses in the valvetrain. Various techniques have been used to offset the effect of stiffer springs, such as dual-spring and progressive-sprung valves, roller-tipped tappets, and pneumatic <b>valve</b> <b>springs.</b>|$|R

50|$|Valve float was {{analyzed}} {{and found to}} be caused largely by resonance in <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> that generated oscillating compression waves among coils, much like a Slinky. High speed photography showed that at specific resonant speeds, <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> were no longer making contact at one or both ends, leaving the valve floatingbefore crashing into the cam on closure.|$|R

Antecedent to the actual proposal is the division and retrieval of the modern valve trains, the valve train acting forces description, division and description of the individual valve-lift curve parts, <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> and the dynamic models of the valve train.

50|$|The common <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> {{system is}} {{satisfactory}} for traditional mass-produced engines {{that do not}} rev highly and are of a design that requires low maintenance. At the period of initial desmodromic development, <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> were a major limitation on engine performance because they would break from metal fatigue. Vacuum melt processes developed in the 1950s helped remove impurities in the steel used to make <b>valve</b> <b>springs,</b> although after sustained operation above 8000 RPM often springs would still fail. The desmodromic system was devised to remedy this problem. Furthermore, as maximum RPM increases, higher spring force is required to prevent valve float, leading to increased cam drag and higher wear on the parts at all speeds, problems addressed by the desmodromic mechanism.|$|R

This gauge uses hoses {{attached to the}} various test cocks of the RPZD and checks {{to be certain that}} the check <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> as well as the relief <b>valve</b> <b>spring</b> are not fouled and are working properly. There is a variety of manufacturers of these gauges, but most utilize either a three-valve or a five-valve design to test the RPZD in different ways.|$|R
