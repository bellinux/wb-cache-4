Due to shared production processes, <b>refined</b> non-peanut <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> can contain residual peanut proteins. We estimated the predicted number of allergic reactions to residual peanut proteins using probabilistic risk assessment applied to several scenarios involving food products made with <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils.</b> Variables considered were: a) the estimated production scale of <b>refined</b> peanut <b>oil,</b> b) estimated cross-contact between <b>refined</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> during production, c) the proportion of fat in representative food products and d) the peanut protein concentration in <b>refined</b> peanut <b>oil.</b> For all products examined the predicted risk of objective allergic reactions in peanut-allergic users of the food products was extremely low. The number of predicted reactions ranged depending on the model {{from a high of}} 3 per 1000 eating occasions (Weibull) to no reactions (LogNormal). Significantly, all reactions were predicted for allergen intakes well below the amounts reported for the most sensitive individual described in the clinical literature. We conclude that the health risk from cross-contact between <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> and <b>refined</b> peanut <b>oil</b> is negligible.

50|$|Neste Renewable Diesel is {{produced}} in a patented <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil</b> <b>refining</b> process. Chemically, it entails direct catalytic hydrogenolysis of plant oils, which are triglycerides, into the corresponding alkanes.

40|$|Introduction & Objective: This {{cross-sectional}} study was undertaken {{to assess the}} association between dietary energy density and prevalence of the cardiometabolic risk factors among Te-hranian adult women. Materials & Methods: In this {{cross-sectional study}} we assessed habitual dietary intakes of 486 Tehranian adult women {{by the use of}} a validated food frequency questionnaire. Dietary en-ergy density (DED) was calculated as each individual’s reported daily energy intake (kcal/d) into total weight of foods (excluding beverages) consumed (g/d). Fasting plasma glucose (FPG), lipid profiles and blood pressure were measured. Diabetes (FPG? 126 mg/dL), dyslip-idemia (based on Adult Treatment Panel III) and hypertension (based on Joint National Committee VI) were defined. The presence of “at least one risk factor” and "at least two risk factors" of the three major risk factors for cardiovascular disease (hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes) were also evaluated. To explore the associations between DED and cardio-metabolic risk factors, we obtained prevalence ratios in different models accounting for con-founders. Results: Mean dietary energy density was 1. 77 ± 0. 35 kcal/g. Consumption of energy-dense diets was associated with higher intakes of energy, dietary fat, cholesterol, <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils,</b> <b>refined</b> grains and high-fat dairy products and lower intakes of dietary carbohydrates, fruits, vegetables, meat and fish. Adherence to an energy-dense diet was associated with elevated levels of serum triglycerides, total- and LDL-cholesterol and lower levels of serum HDL-cholesterol. Women in the top quartile of DED {{were more likely to have}} dyslipidemia (61 % vs. 31 %, P< 0. 05), at least one (68 % vs. 35 %, P< 0. 05) and at least two (29 % vs. 10 %, P< 0. 05) cardiometabolic risk factors as compared with those in the bottom quartile. Addi-tional control for BMI slightly attenuated the associations. No overall significant associations were found between consumption of energy-dense diets and risk of having diabetes or hyper-tension either before or after adjustment for confounders. Conclusion: Consumption of energy-dense diets was significantly related to the high prevalence of dyslipidemia, at least one and at least two risk factors among Tehranian adult women. Pro-spective studies are required to confirm our findings. (Sci J Hamadan Univ Med Sci 2013; 20 (1) : 38 - 48...|$|R

50|$|The {{practice}} of farming cultivating {{is known as}} algaculture. Botryococcus braunii has great potential for algaculture because of the hydrocarbons it produces, which can be chemically converted into fuels. Up to 86% of the dry weight of Botryococcus braunii can be long-chain hydrocarbons. The vast majority of these hydrocarbons are botryocuccus oils: botryococcenes, alkadienes and alkatrienes. Transesterification can NOT {{be used to make}} biodiesel from Botryococcus oils. This is because these oils are not vegetable oils in the common meaning, in which they are fatty acid triglycerides. While Botryococcus oils are oils of vegetable origin, they are inedible and chemically very different, being triterpenes, and lack the free oxygen atom needed for transesterification. Botryococcus oils can be used as feedstock for hydrocracking in an oil refinery to produce octane (gasoline, a.k.a. petrol), kerosene, and diesel. (see <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil</b> <b>refining).</b> Botryococcenes are preferred over alkadienes and alkatrienes for hydrocracking as botryococcenes will likely be transformed into a fuel with a higher octane rating.|$|E
