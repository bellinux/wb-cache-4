25|$|Coupled {{with similar}} {{high-quality}} <b>videophones</b> introduced by other electronics manufacturers, {{the availability of}} high speed Internet, and sponsored video relay services authorized by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission in 2002, VRS services for the deaf underwent rapid growth in that country.|$|E

The service started as a pilot project in 1996 for ISDN <b>videophones,</b> but started to offer SIP-based services in 2003. Currently the Swedish video relay service is the largest in Europe with an average of 135,000 calls every year.|$|E

40|$|We {{report the}} use of an Internet-based <b>videophone</b> to support a child {{undergoing}} bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Over the Christmas period, an eight-year-old boy with an underlying diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and a history of absconding and aggressive non-compliant behaviour was treated by BMT. We installed an Internet-based <b>videophone</b> in the patient 2 ̆ 7 s hospital room two days post-transplant. A second <b>videophone</b> was installed in the patient 2 ̆ 7 s home and used the existing home telephone line. In all, 14 <b>videophone</b> calls were made over a nine-day period. The <b>videophone</b> improved interfamily social and emotional support, and appeared to reduce some of the inherent anxiety and distress resulting from paediatric bone marrow transplantation...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the use of a <b>videophone</b> by people with an intellectual handicap and their relatives at a healthcare organisation in the Netherlands. A triangulation of methods is used. The first method was a questionnaire (pre-study) were 195 clients and 439 client representatives participated in a satisfaction survey from the healthcare organisation. Out of this satisfaction survey, approximately 30 % (N = 116 out of N = 374 reactions) identified concerns related to communication. Secondly, a literature study was carried out using Pubmed database. Eleven publications were selected. Finally, based on the pre-study and the literature an experiment was performed in which the <b>videophone</b> was evaluated. Two clients and two relatives used the <b>videophone</b> for approximately two months. The data supported the use of the <b>videophone</b> with intellectual handicapped and their relatives to improve communication. The addition of visual non-verbal cues and the fixed place of the <b>videophone</b> enhanced social presence, the concentration, the duration and the quality of the conversation. In general, the <b>videophone</b> was easy to use, but the sound and screen quality of the <b>videophone</b> could be improved to support communication...|$|R

25|$|This is a {{paradigm}} shift because under the original NMCI contract, the government managed the network at a distance and did not own any IT assets used in the program. Rather, they were owned by the prime contractor, and services are provided to the government on a per-seat basis. Pricing is primarily assessed on a per-machine basis that includes security services, help desk support, and periodic technology upgrades; however, fees for additional services (such as classified connectivity, mission-critical service, additional user accounts, software installation, seat moves, remote access from mobile devices, etc.) did apply. <b>Videophones</b> that provide equal access for Deaf employees are not permissible under NMCI regulations. As of October 2007, the per seat price for all of NMCI was reduced by 15 percent. Desktop PCs and laptops {{as well as other}} network components are being continually upgraded in order to enhance performance and security.|$|E

50|$|AT&T {{would later}} market its <b>VideoPhone</b> 2500 {{to the general}} public from 1992 to 1995 with prices {{starting}} at US$1,500 (approximately $ in current dollars) and later dropping to $1,000 ($ in current dollars), marketed by its Global <b>VideoPhone</b> Systems unit. The <b>VideoPhone</b> 2500 was designed to provide low-frame rate compressed color video on ordinary Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) lines, circumventing the significantly higher cost ADSL telephone service lines used by several other videoconferencing manufacturers. It was limited by analog phone line connection speeds of about 19 Kilobits per second, the video portion being 11,200 bit/s, and with a maximum frame rate of 10 frames per second, but typically much slower, as low as a third of a video frame per second. The <b>VideoPhone</b> 2500 used proprietary technology protocols, including AT&T's Global <b>VideoPhone</b> Standard (GVS). Again, AT&T met with very little commercial success, selling only about 30,000 units, mainly outside the United States.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the efficacy of <b>videophone</b> conversations for enhancing conversation partner situational awareness and mitigating cell phone distraction during intersection drives. Younger and older drivers drove through simulated intersections in four conditions: undistracted, with an in-car passenger, with a remote partner who could see the driver and {{a subset of the}} driving scene via a <b>videophone,</b> and with a remote partner on a cell phone. Relative to the cell phone condition, passenger and <b>videophone</b> conversations enhanced situational awareness and mitigated distraction. Younger and older drivers showed similar benefits, although there were age-related costs to driving performance overall. <b>Videophone</b> information offers a simple and promising potential strategy to enhance partner situational awareness during cell phone conversations, even when the conversation partner can see only a subset of the driving scene...|$|R

2500|$|Despite the {{availability}} of VRS providers in Germany since 2006, the VRS usage is very extremely low as compared to other countries (no more than 1200 clients out of 800,000 deaf people). The integration agency is notorious for rejecting the applications many times on [...] "cost benefit" [...] factor: the agency claims that some deaf clients do not make sufficient VRS calls per month to justify the cost or {{that the nature of}} employment does not warrant the need for VRS and <b>videophones.</b> The deaf and hard-of-hearing callers who use VRS for private calls do not receive any form of reimbursement for the VRS calls.|$|E

Some advanced equipment enables a person to remotely control the other person's video camera, in order to zoom in and out or to point the camera better to understand the signing.|$|E

2500|$|The name {{videophone}} {{is not as}} standardized as {{its earlier}} counterpart, the telephone, resulting {{in a variety of}} names and terms being used worldwide, and even within the same region or country. [...] <b>Videophones</b> are also known as videotelephones (or video telephones) and often by an early trademarked name [...] "Picturephone", which was the world's first commercial videophone produced in volume. The compound name [...] "videophone" [...] slowly entered into general use after 1950, although [...] "video telephone" [...] likely entered the lexicon earlier after [...] "video" [...] was coined in 1935. Videophone calls (also: videocalls and video chat), differ from videoconferencing in that they expect to serve individuals, not groups. However that distinction has become increasingly blurred with technology improvements such as increased bandwidth and sophisticated software clients that can allow for multiple parties on a call. In general everyday usage the term videoconferencing is now frequently used instead of videocall for point-to-point calls between two units. Both videophone calls and videoconferencing are also now commonly referred to as a video link.|$|E
