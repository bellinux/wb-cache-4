Definition of the physical "dose" by means of ISO/R 1996 noise rating scale (NR, sound pressure level in octave bands) and of a new analogous and matched <b>vibration</b> <b>rating</b> scale (VR, acceleration, mostly at discrete frequencies), evolved from VDI 2057 K-value, Definition of the subjective "effect", viz. the annoyance judgement by experienced and responsible observers (senior deck- and engineer officers, booking officers, acousticians) as expressed on simple category scales. Examples of evidence that hypothesis works: useful dose-effect correlations and no contradictory results in all 85 cases available in TPD files from 14 ships for which reliable data was obtained. Conclusion that shipboard vibration problems cannot be treated adequately without {{taking into account that}} people apparently undergo noise and vibrations on board as one coherent environment agent affecting their proficiency and their satisfaction. By means of the matched NR- and VR-scales it can be found out, whether annoyance due to noise or to vibrations prevails, and which should be considered for reduction primarily...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{modes of}} pulse-periodic laser action with thermocycling were defined, at which {{an area with}} a corrugated-shaped relief and a clear border was formed {{in the center of}} the heat-affected zone in the study material, brass L 62 of 0. 05 mm thickness. It was found that during pulse-periodic laser action, {{wedge-shaped}} submicrocavities were formed on the surface layer of the material. These submicrocavities converge at their edges with formation of extended nanosized channels with widths not more than 100 nm. The pulse-periodic laser action with a pulse frequency of 3 Hz on single-phase brass leads to the formation of nanosized cavities due to the accumulation of internal stresses during cyclic heating and cooling at high rates. The estimation of <b>vibration</b> <b>rates</b> of the samples in the frequency range from 0. 5 to 16000 Hz was performed. It was revealed during the study of the forced oscillations that the maximum values of <b>vibration</b> <b>rate</b> occur at frequencies corresponding to the natural vibration frequencies. The application of a damping device causes significant reduction in <b>vibration</b> <b>rate,</b> but under such conditions the pore formation is not stopped. It was determined that the conditions of fixation of the samples during pulse-periodic laser action with thermocycling practically do not influence the intensity of the formation of a nanoporous structure. This provides an opportunity to implement the processes of formation of nanoporous structures in the massive parts of devices and mechanisms, it significantly increases the potential for the practical use of this process...|$|R

The pile driving machine is lifted and positioned over the pile by means of an excavator or crane, and is fastened to the pile by a clamp and/or bolts. Vibratory hammers can either drive in or extract a pile; extraction is commonly used to recover steel [...] "H" [...] piles used in temporary foundation shoring. Hydraulic fluid is typically supplied to the driver by a diesel engine powered pump mounted in a trailer or van and connected to the driver head through a set of long hoses. When the pile driver is connected to a dragline excavator, it is powered by the excavator's own diesel engine. Vibratory pile drivers are often chosen to mitigate noise, as when the construction is very close to residence or office buildings, or when there is not enough vertical clearance above the foundation to permit use of a conventional pile hammer (for example when retrofitting additional piles to a bridge column or abutment footing). Hammers are available with several different <b>vibration</b> <b>rates,</b> ranging from about 1200 vibrations per minute to about 2400 VPM; the <b>vibration</b> <b>rate</b> chosen is influenced by soil conditions at the site and other factors such as power requirements and purchase price of the equipment.|$|R

Significant departure from local thermodynamic equilibrium is indicated, which implies lower dissociation rates for molecular components and a subsequent enhancement in the rate of grain formation by many orders of magnitude. Stabilization of intermediate species before they can dissociate may facilitate the formation of refractory grain cores in very hot, dilute outflows.

5000|$|Modern (2007) watch balance {{wheels are}} usually made of Glucydur, a low thermal {{expansion}} alloy of beryllium, copper and iron, with springs of a low thermal coefficient of elasticity alloy such as Nivarox. [...] The two alloys are matched so their residual temperature responses cancel out, resulting in even lower temperature error. The wheels are smooth, to reduce air friction, and the pivots are supported on precision jewel bearings. Older balance wheels used weight screws around the rim to adjust the poise (balance), but modern wheels are computer-poised at the factory, using a laser to burn a precise pit in the rim to make them balanced. [...] Balance wheels rotate about 1½ turns with each swing, that is, about 270° to each side of their center equilibrium position. The rate of the balance wheel is adjusted with the regulator, a lever with a narrow slit on the end through which the balance spring passes. This holds {{the part of the}} spring behind the slit stationary. Moving the lever slides the slit up and down the balance spring, changing its effective length, and thus the resonant <b>vibration</b> <b>rate</b> of the balance. Since the regulator interferes with the spring's action, chronometers and some precision watches have ‘free sprung’ balances with no regulator, such as the Gyromax. Their rate is adjusted by weight screws on the balance rim. A balance's <b>vibration</b> <b>rate</b> is traditionally measured in beats (ticks) per hour, or BPH, although beats per second and Hz are also used. The length of a beat is one swing of the balance wheel, between reversals of direction, so there are two beats in a complete cycle. Balances in precision watches are designed with faster beats, because they are less affected by motions of the wrist. [...] Alarm clocks and kitchen timers often have a rate of 4 beats per second (14,400 BPH). Watches made prior to the 1970s usually had a rate of 5 beats per second (18,000 BPH). Current watches have rates of 6 (21,600 BPH), 8 (28,800 BPH) and a few have 10 beats per second (36,000 BPH). During WWII, Elgin produced a very precise stopwatch that ran at 40 beats per second (144,000 BPH), earning it the nickname 'Jitterbug'. [...] Audemars Piguet currently produces a movement that allows for a very high balance vibration of 12 beats/s (43,200 BPH). [...] The precision of the best balance wheel watches on the wrist is around a few seconds per day. The most accurate balance wheel timepieces made were marine chronometers, which by WWII had achieved accuracies of 0.1 second per day.|$|R

Average accuracy of voice gender identification by adult listeners was 81. 7 % and 41. 1 % for prepubertal children’s voice gender produced under neutral and imitation conditions respectively. No significant difference in f 0 was found between genders under neutral condition, suggesting similar vocal mechanism for prepubertal boys and girls. Average F 1 and F 2 associated with boys were lower than that with girls. It was suggested that both difference in vocal tract length, and the sex-specific articulatory behaviors contributed to the differences in formant frequencies, thus enhancing sexual dimorphism for gender voice identification.

40|$|The {{jumping spider}} Phidippus clarus uses signals that combine visual and substrate-borne vibrations, which predict {{the outcome of}} male [...] male {{competition}} and are important to copulation success. We investigated the function of males' substrate-borne vibrations by examining phenotypic correlates of vibratory signal traits and assessing whether these affect female mating and remating decisions. Virgin females were first paired with males, and females that copulated in first trials were then paired with a second male to determine whether females remate. We measured vibratory signals produced by males during these interactions to determine 1) correlations between substrate-borne signal traits and male phenotypes, 2) whether properties of substrate-borne signals predicted mating success in first and second copulations, and 3) whether females of different mating status have different acceptance thresholds for male characters. Courtship <b>vibration</b> <b>rate</b> {{was positively correlated with}} male leg size, and signaling rate significantly predicted mating success in all copulations. Some females were polyandrous; however, copulation with mated females occurred after longer courtship durations, and courtship duration was positively correlated with male size, demonstrating that mated females are less receptive to mates and suggesting that females may be trading up in subsequent matings. Our study shows that males invest significant effort in courtship and that sexual selection via female choice may play a nontrivial role in the mating system. These results are the first to show that honest information about male size is encoded by substrate vibrations, and these signals are important for male mating success in both virgin and mated females.

Understanding these processes requires ultrafast probes; optical probes (reflectivity, spectral) are suitable for some surface studies, but the tracking of structural changes are well suited to x-ray and electron diffraction. An ultrafast photo-electron diffractometer is a tool for tracking structural changes such as thermal expansion, melting and super-heating, crystal phase changes, ionization, and more. The design and operation of an ultrafast photo-electron diffractometer is detailed, and its successful operation is demonstrated by sub-picosecond recording of strain in a free-standing polycrystalline platinum film of 9 nm thickness subjected to a fluence of 2 mJ/cm 2 from 150 fs laser pulses. The temporal profile of the relative change of strain is used to determine corresponding temperatures changes; for the (311) peak an increase of 70 K is noted within 10 ps. The increase in temperature takes place at a very nearly linear 7 K/ps. The (111) peak heats more rapidly, reaching 84 K in 6 ps, and is also nearly linear at 14 K/ps. A temporal relationship is found which connects the phonons in different directions with energy transport: {{the rate of change}} of temperature per phonon oscillation period is the same in both directions, indicating that thermalization of phonons in polycrystalline platinum is coupled to the actual <b>vibration</b> <b>rate.</b> Reflectivity data shows rapid, coherent oscillations, but slower than acoustic phonons.

Objective information concerning "lithic sound's" properties of pitch, duration, and intensity, can inform archaeologists about a stone's candidacy for human use, and whether or not lithic material at a site has been heat treated. A hammer stone machine held and struck specimens under controlled conditions. To process acoustic information, A Kay Computer Speech Laboratory and related software proved effective. Nineteen specimens of stone were tested. Based upon waveform evaluation, heat treated stone had much higher average sound intensity levels than the stone in its unheated condition. Archaeologists could use methods discussed in this study to assess if heat treated siliceous rock is present at sites. After being struck with a hammer stone, significant differences existed concerning the duration and average <b>vibration</b> <b>rates</b> of sound between types of stone, unheated versus heated stone, and high and low quality stone of the same type. Accessory information included observation of how the hammer stone rebounded differently from specimens with obvious flaws, compared to stones with no imperfections.

40|$|Flywheel {{energy storage}} (FES) systems have {{recently}} gained {{momentum in the}} energy storage industry as {{a viable alternative to}} conventional lithium-ion and lead-acid batteries because they have superior energy density, faster charge rates, lack harmful chemicals, and are easy to repair. Contemporary FES research is focused on increasing the maximum operating speed of the rotor and reducing the power consumed by the active magnetic bearings. Therefore, the objective of this research was to implement a novel nonlinear controller called ?wavelet-based time-frequency control? (WFXLMS) in a computer simulation of a FES system with five degrees-of-freedom and compare its dynamic stability and active power consumption with a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) and fuzzy-logic controller scheme. Specifically, all three controllers were applied to a FES system operating at a high rate of speed and the amplitude of <b>vibration,</b> <b>rate</b> of convergence, and current draw were compared. The results show that the ideal choice for a FES system is the WFXLMS controller. While it did draw the largest maximum current of any system, it used significantly less (half of PID and a quarter of fuzzy-logic?s) steady state current. This would drastically improve the energy storage duration; one of the main functions of a FES system. The WFXLMS controller is also the ideal system for higher operating speeds because of the system?s stability in the frequency domain. Comparing the average displacements shows that the WFXLMS controller had the largest average displacement (particularly in the z- axis), but the WFXLMS controller only used a fraction of the available clearance gap. If the FES system was used in an environment like space or a wind-farm where external excitations are limited, the WFXLMS controller is the clear choice. However, if external excitations are a real concern, the PID and fuzzy-logic controllers demonstrated a much quicker reaction time and would be the better choice...|$|R

40|$|Stimulated Brillouin {{scattering}} recently allowed experimental excitation {{of surface}} acoustic resonances in micro-devices, enabling <b>vibration</b> at <b>rates</b> {{in the range}} of 50 MHz to 12 GHz. The experimental availability of such mechanical whispering gallery modes in photonic-MEMS raises questions on their structure and spectral distribution. Here we calculate the form and frequency of such vibrational surface whispering gallery modes, revealing diverse types of surface vibrations including longitudinal, transverse, and Rayleigh-type deformations. We parametrically investigate these various modes by changing their orders in the azimuthal, radial, and polar directions to reveal different vibrational structures including mechanical resonances that are localized near the interface with the environment where they can sense changes in the surroundings.
