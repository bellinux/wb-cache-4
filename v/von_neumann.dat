5|$|The {{professional}} society of Hungarian computer scientists, John <b>von</b> <b>Neumann</b> Computer Society, {{is named after}} John <b>von</b> <b>Neumann.</b> It was closed in April 1989.|$|E
5|$|<b>Von</b> <b>Neumann</b> {{created the}} field of {{cellular}} automata {{without the aid of}} computers, constructing the first self-replicating automata with pencil and graph paper. The concept of the <b>Von</b> <b>Neumann</b> universal constructor based on the <b>von</b> <b>Neumann</b> cellular automaton was fleshed out in his posthumous work Theory of Self Reproducing Automata.|$|E
5|$|Building on {{his results}} on matrix games {{and on his}} model of an {{expanding}} economy, <b>von</b> <b>Neumann</b> invented the theory of duality in linear programming, after George Dantzig described his work in a few minutes, when an impatient <b>von</b> <b>Neumann</b> asked him {{to get to the}} point. Then, Dantzig listened dumbfounded while <b>von</b> <b>Neumann</b> provided an hour lecture on convex sets, fixed-point theory, and duality, conjecturing the equivalence between matrix games and linear programming.|$|E
5|$|<b>Von</b> <b>Neumann</b> held {{a lifelong}} passion for ancient history, being renowned for his prodigious {{historical}} knowledge. A professor of Byzantine history at Princeton {{once said that}} <b>von</b> <b>Neumann</b> had greater expertise in Byzantine history than he did.|$|E
5|$|<b>Von</b> <b>Neumann</b> was a {{founding}} figure in computing. Donald Knuth cites <b>von</b> <b>Neumann</b> as the inventor, in 1945, of the merge sort algorithm, {{in which the}} first and second halves of an array are each sorted recursively and then merged.|$|E
5|$|Although Max insisted <b>von</b> <b>Neumann</b> {{attend school}} at the grade level {{appropriate}} to his age, he agreed to hire private tutors to give him advanced instruction in those areas {{in which he had}} displayed an aptitude. At the age of 15, he began to study advanced calculus under the renowned analyst Gábor Szegő. On their first meeting, Szegő was so astounded with the boy's mathematical talent that he was brought to tears. Some of von Neumann's instant solutions to the problems in calculus posed by Szegő, sketched out on his father's stationery, are still on display at the <b>von</b> <b>Neumann</b> archive in Budapest. By the age of 19, <b>von</b> <b>Neumann</b> had published two major mathematical papers, the second of which gave the modern definition of ordinal numbers, which superseded Georg Cantor's definition. At the conclusion of his education at the gymnasium, <b>von</b> <b>Neumann</b> sat for and won the Eötvös Prize, a national prize for mathematics.|$|E
5|$|By September 1943, Neddermeyer's {{team had}} grown from five people to fifty. That month, John <b>von</b> <b>Neumann</b> came to Los Alamos at Oppenheimer's request. <b>Von</b> <b>Neumann</b> was {{impressed}} by the implosion concept and, working with Edward Teller, an old friend, made a series of suggestions. <b>Von</b> <b>Neumann</b> was able to create a sound mathematical model of implosion, enabling Neddermeyer to present a proposal for a greatly expanded research program. Edwin McMillan and Isidor Isaac Rabi recommended that George Kistiakowsky, who had a specialized knowledge in the precision use of explosives, be brought in to help the program. In February 1944, Kistiakowsky became Parsons' deputy for implosion.|$|E
5|$|Stochastic {{computing}} {{was first}} introduced in a pioneering paper by <b>von</b> <b>Neumann</b> in 1953.|$|E
5|$|Such strategies, which {{minimize}} the maximum loss for each player, are called optimal. <b>Von</b> <b>Neumann</b> showed that their minimaxes are equal (in absolute value) and contrary (in sign). <b>Von</b> <b>Neumann</b> improved and extended the minimax theorem to include games involving imperfect information and games {{with more than}} two players, publishing this result in his 1944 Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (written with Oskar Morgenstern). Morgenstern {{wrote a paper on}} game theory and thought he would show it to <b>von</b> <b>Neumann</b> because of his interest in the subject. He read it and said to Morgenstern that he should put more in it. This was repeated a couple of times, and then <b>von</b> <b>Neumann</b> became a coauthor and the paper became 100 pages long. Then it became a book. The public interest in this work was such that The New York Times ran a front-page story. In this book, <b>von</b> <b>Neumann</b> declared that economic theory needed to use functional analytic methods, especially convex sets and topological fixed-point theorem, rather than the traditional differential calculus, because the maximum-operator did not preserve differentiable functions.|$|E
5|$|The John <b>von</b> <b>Neumann</b> Center in Plainsboro Township, New Jersey, {{was named}} in his honor.|$|E
5|$|The crater <b>von</b> <b>Neumann</b> on the Moon {{is named}} after him.|$|E
5|$|The <b>von</b> <b>Neumann</b> neighborhood, {{in which}} each cell in a {{two-dimensional}} grid has the four orthogonally adjacent grid cells as neighbors, continues {{to be used for}} other cellular automata. <b>Von</b> <b>Neumann</b> proved that the most effective way of performing large-scale mining operations such as mining an entire moon or asteroid belt would be by using self-replicating spacecraft, taking advantage of their exponential growth.|$|E
5|$|<b>Von</b> <b>Neumann</b> {{founded the}} field of {{continuous}} geometry based on lattice theoretic principles. Earlier, Menger and Birkhoff had axiomatized complex projective geometry {{in terms of the}} properties of its lattice of linear subspaces. <b>Von</b> <b>Neumann,</b> following his work on rings of operators, weakened those axioms to describe a broader class of lattices, the continuous geometries.|$|E
5|$|For his wartime services, <b>von</b> <b>Neumann</b> {{was awarded}} the Navy Distinguished Civilian Service Award in July 1946, and the Medal for Merit in October 1946.|$|E
5|$|Gleason's theorem {{implies the}} nonexistence of {{certain types of}} hidden {{variable}} theories for quantum mechanics, strengthening a previous argument of John <b>von</b> <b>Neumann.</b> <b>Von</b> <b>Neumann</b> had claimed to show that hidden variable theories were impossible, but (as Grete Hermann pointed out) his demonstration made an assumption that quantum systems obeyed a form of additivity of expectation for noncommuting operators that might not hold a priori. In 1966, John Stewart Bell showed that Gleason's theorem {{could be used to}} remove this extra assumption from von Neumann's argument.|$|E
5|$|John <b>von</b> <b>Neumann</b> {{consulted}} for the Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory, {{most notably}} on the ENIAC project, {{as a member}} of its Scientific Advisory Committee.|$|E
5|$|Since {{there were}} few posts in Hungary for mathematicians, and those were not well-paid, his father wanted <b>von</b> <b>Neumann</b> to follow him into {{industry}} and thereby invest his time in a more financially useful endeavor than mathematics. <b>Von</b> <b>Neumann</b> and his father decided that the best career path {{was to become a}} chemical engineer. This was not something that <b>von</b> <b>Neumann</b> had much knowledge of, so it was arranged for him to take a two-year non-degree course in chemistry at the University of Berlin, after which he sat for the entrance exam to the prestigious ETH Zurich, which he passed in September 1923. At the same time, <b>von</b> <b>Neumann</b> also entered Pázmány Péter University in Budapest, as a Ph.D. candidate in mathematics. For his thesis, he chose to produce an axiomatization of Cantor's set theory. He passed his final examinations for his Ph.D. soon after graduating from ETH Zurich in 1926. He then went to the University of Göttingen on a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to study mathematics under David Hilbert.|$|E
5|$|The algebra of observables {{in quantum}} {{mechanics}} is naturally an algebra of operators defined on a Hilbert space, according to Werner Heisenberg's matrix mechanics formulation of quantum theory. <b>Von</b> <b>Neumann</b> began investigating operator algebras in the 1930s, as rings of operators on a Hilbert space. The kind of algebras studied by <b>von</b> <b>Neumann</b> and his contemporaries are now known as <b>von</b> <b>Neumann</b> algebras. In the 1940s, Israel Gelfand, Mark Naimark and Irving Segal gave a definition {{of a kind of}} operator algebras called C*-algebras that on the one hand made no reference to an underlying Hilbert space, and on the other extrapolated many of the useful features of the operator algebras that had previously been studied. The spectral theorem for self-adjoint operators in particular that underlies much of the existing Hilbert space theory was generalized to C*-algebras. These techniques are now basic in abstract harmonic analysis and representation theory.|$|E
5|$|The next {{computer}} that <b>von</b> <b>Neumann</b> designed was the IAS machine at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. He arranged its financing, and the components were {{designed and built}} at the RCA Research Laboratory nearby. John <b>von</b> <b>Neumann</b> recommended that the IBM 701, nicknamed the defense computer include a magnetic drum. It was a faster version of the IAS machine and {{formed the basis for}} the commercially successful IBM 704.|$|E
5|$|<b>Von</b> <b>Neumann</b> {{entered the}} Lutheran Fasori Evangelikus Gimnázium in 1911. This {{was one of}} the best schools in Budapest, part of a {{brilliant}} education system designed for the elite. Under the Hungarian system, children received all their education at the one gymnasium. Despite being run by the Lutheran Church, the majority of its pupils were Jewish. The school system produced a generation noted for intellectual achievement, that included Theodore von Kármán (b. 1881), George de Hevesy (b. 1885), Leó Szilárd (b. 1898), Dennis Gabor (b. 1900), Eugene Wigner (b. 1902), Edward Teller (b. 1908), and Paul Erdős (b. 1913). Collectively, they were sometimes known as Martians. Wigner was a year ahead of <b>von</b> <b>Neumann</b> at the Lutheran School. When asked why the Hungary of his generation had produced so many geniuses, Wigner, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963, replied that <b>von</b> <b>Neumann</b> was the only genius.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann's team {{performed}} the world's first numerical weather forecasts on the ENIAC computer; <b>von</b> <b>Neumann</b> published the paper Numerical Integration of the Barotropic Vorticity Equation in 1950.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with four}} other {{scientists}} and various military personnel, <b>von</b> <b>Neumann</b> {{was included in the}} target selection committee responsible for choosing the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as the first targets of the atomic bomb. <b>Von</b> <b>Neumann</b> oversaw computations related to the expected size of the bomb blasts, estimated death tolls, and the distance above the ground at which the bombs should be detonated for optimum shock wave propagation and thus maximum effect. The cultural capital Kyoto, which had been spared the bombing inflicted upon militarily significant cities, was von Neumann's first choice, a selection seconded by Manhattan Project leader General Leslie Groves. However, this target was dismissed by Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson.|$|E
5|$|As Hilary Putnam writes, <b>Von</b> <b>Neumann</b> {{replaced}} {{classical logic}} with a logic constructed in orthomodular lattices (isomorphic to the lattice of subspaces of the Hilbert {{space of a}} given physical system).|$|E
5|$|Eugene Wigner told {{a similar}} story, {{only with a}} swallow instead of a fly, and says it was Max Born who posed the {{question}} to <b>von</b> <b>Neumann</b> in the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|Formal {{schooling}} did {{not start}} in Hungary {{until the age of}} ten. Instead, governesses taught <b>von</b> <b>Neumann,</b> his brothers and his cousins. Max believed that knowledge of languages other than Hungarian was essential, so the children were tutored in English, French, German and Italian. By the age of 8, <b>von</b> <b>Neumann</b> was familiar with differential and integral calculus, but he was particularly interested in history, reading his way through Wilhelm Oncken's 46-volume Allgemeine Geschichte in Einzeldarstellungen. A copy was contained in a private library Max purchased. One of the rooms in the apartment was converted into a library and reading room, with bookshelves from ceiling to floor.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, John <b>von</b> <b>Neumann</b> {{developed}} an axiom system that eliminates the paradoxes {{by using an}} approach similar to Cantor's—namely, by identifying collections that are not sets and treating them differently. <b>Von</b> <b>Neumann</b> stated that a class is too big to be a set {{if it can be}} put into one-to-one correspondence with the class of all sets. He defined a set as a class that is a member of some class and stated the axiom: A class is not a set if and only if there is a one-to-one correspondence between it and the class of all sets. This axiom implies that these big classes are not sets, which eliminates the paradoxes since they cannot be members of any class. <b>Von</b> <b>Neumann</b> also used his axiom to prove the well-ordering theorem: Like Cantor, he assumed that the ordinals form a set. The resulting contradiction implies that the class of all ordinals is not a set. Then his axiom provides a one-to-one correspondence between this class and the class of all sets. This correspondence well-orders the class of all sets, which implies the well-ordering theorem. In 1930, Zermelo defined models of set theory that satisfy von Neumann's axiom.|$|E
5|$|Richardson {{envisioned a}} large {{auditorium}} {{of thousands of}} people performing the calculations and passing them to others. However, the sheer number of calculations required was too large to be completed without the use of computers, {{and the size of the}} grid and time steps led to unrealistic results in deepening systems. It was later found, through numerical analysis, that this was due to numerical instability. The first computerised weather forecast was performed by a team composed of American meteorologists Jule Charney, Philip Thompson, Larry Gates, and Norwegian meteorologist Ragnar Fjørtoft, applied mathematician John <b>von</b> <b>Neumann,</b> and ENIAC programmer Klara Dan <b>von</b> <b>Neumann.</b> Practical use of numerical weather prediction began in 1955, spurred by the development of programmable electronic computers.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before his}} death, {{when he was}} already quite ill, <b>von</b> <b>Neumann</b> headed the United States government's top secret ICBM committee, and it would {{sometimes}} meet in his home. Its purpose was {{to decide on the}} feasibility of building an ICBM large enough to carry a thermonuclear weapon. <b>Von</b> <b>Neumann</b> had long argued that while the technical obstacles were sizable, they could be overcome in time. The SM-65 Atlas passed its first fully functional test in 1959, two years after his death. The feasibility of an ICBM owed as much to improved, smaller warheads as it did to developments in rocketry, and his understanding of the former made his advice invaluable.|$|E
5|$|The John <b>von</b> <b>Neumann</b> Lecture {{is given}} {{annually}} at the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) by a researcher who {{has contributed to}} applied mathematics, and the chosen lecturer is also awarded a monetary prize.|$|E
5|$|The John <b>von</b> <b>Neumann</b> Theory Prize of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS, {{previously}} TIMS-ORSA) {{is awarded}} annually {{to an individual}} (or group) who have made fundamental and sustained contributions to theory in operations research and the management sciences.|$|E
5|$|The {{first modern}} {{computers}} were the massive code breaking machines of the Second World War (such as Z3, ENIAC and Colossus). The latter {{two of these}} machines {{were based on the}} theoretical foundation laid by Alan Turing and developed by John <b>von</b> <b>Neumann.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Von</b> <b>Neumann</b> {{founded the}} field of game theory as a {{mathematical}} discipline. <b>Von</b> <b>Neumann</b> proved his minimax theorem in 1928. This theorem establishes that in zero-sum games with perfect information (i.e. in which players know at each time all moves {{that have taken place}} so far), there exists a pair of strategies for both players that allows each to minimize his maximum losses, hence the name minimax. When examining every possible strategy, a player must consider all the possible responses of his adversary. The player then plays out the strategy that will result in the minimization of his maximum loss.|$|E
5|$|<b>Von</b> <b>Neumann</b> made {{fundamental}} {{contributions in}} exploration {{of problems in}} numerical hydrodynamics. For example, with Robert D. Richtmyer he developed an algorithm defining artificial viscosity that improved the understanding of shock waves. When computers solved hydrodynamic or aerodynamic problems, they tried to put too many computational grid points at regions of sharp discontinuity (shock waves). The mathematics of artificial viscosity smoothed the shock transition without sacrificing basic physics. Other contributions to fluid dynamics included the classic flow solution to blast waves, and the co-discovery of the ZND detonation model of explosives. During the 1930s, <b>Von</b> <b>Neumann</b> became an authority on the mathematics of shaped charges.|$|E
5|$|<b>Von</b> <b>Neumann</b> was {{reportedly}} able to memorize {{the pages of}} telephone directories, entertaining friends by asking them to randomly call out page numbers, and then reciting the names, addresses and numbers therein.|$|E
5|$|In September 1943, the Los Alamos Laboratory's director, Robert Oppenheimer, {{arranged}} for <b>von</b> <b>Neumann</b> to visit Los Alamos and investigate implosion {{with a fresh}} set of eyes. After reviewing Neddermeyer's studies, and discussing the matter with Edward Teller, <b>von</b> <b>Neumann</b> suggested the use of high explosive in shaped charges to implode a sphere, which he showed could not only result in a faster assembly of fissile material than was possible with the gun method, but which could greatly {{reduce the amount of}} material required. The prospect of more efficient nuclear weapons impressed Oppenheimer, Teller and Hans Bethe, but they decided that an expert on explosives was required. Kistiakowsky's name was immediately suggested, and he was brought into the project as a consultant in October 1943.|$|E
5|$|On May 4, 2005 the United States Postal Service {{issued the}} American Scientists {{commemorative}} postage stamp series, a set of four 37-cent self-adhesive stamps in several configurations designed by artist Victor Stabin. The scientists depicted were <b>von</b> <b>Neumann,</b> Barbara McClintock, Josiah Willard Gibbs, and Richard Feynman.|$|E
