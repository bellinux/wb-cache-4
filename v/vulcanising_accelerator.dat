The contents of components other than calcium carbonate, paraffinic oil, and CBS <b>vulcanising</b> <b>accelerator,</b> as well as additives and processing conditions, were kept constant. Fractional factorial design coupled with computational numerical optimisation was used to minimise the number of mixtures. The results demonstrate that statistical design of experiments and particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithms are promising methods to design composition variables. Mixture costs as low as 1. 92 [*]US$/kg can be achieved in compositions containing, for example, 107 [*]phr of calcium carbonate, 95 [*]phr of paraffinic oil, and 1. 13 [*]phr of CBS accelerator. The corresponding composite property-predicted values were 66. 8 [*]Shore A for hardness, tensile strength of 7. 8 [*]MPa, 570. 8 % elongation at break, and 23. 0 % rebound resilience. This demonstrates that, in this way, the desired product with specified characteristics can be comfortably manufactured at minimum cost...|$|E
