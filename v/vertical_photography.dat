A demonstration of the feasibility of an automated solution builds on test data from the Austrian City of Graz. Information is extracted from <b>vertical</b> aerial <b>photography</b> and various data products derived from that photography {{in the form of}} a true orthophoto, a dense digital surface model and digital terrain model, and a classification of land cover. Maps of cadastral property boundaries aid in defining real properties. Our goal is to develop a table for each property with descriptive numbers about the buildings, their dimensions, number of floors, number of windows, roof shapes, impervious surfaces, garages, sheds, vegetation, presence of a basement floor, and other descriptors of interest for each and every property of a city. From aerial sources, at a pixel size of 10 cm, we show that we have obtained positional accuracies in the range of a single pixel, an accuracy of areas in the 10 % range, floor counts at an accuracy of 93 % and window counts at 86 % accuracy. We also introduce 3 D point clouds of facades and their creation from <b>vertical</b> aerial <b>photography,</b> and how these point clouds can support the definition of complex facades...|$|R

The Model 51 was a modernized version of the FC-2 {{produced}} in 1930 to compete with new transports in the marketplace, the most significant single change being the fitting of a more powerful Wright J-6 engine again. A few examples were converted from FC-2s. The RCAF Model 51 aircraft had light bomb racks under the fuselage and were used for practice bombing at Camp Borden. The Model 61 also had the J-6 engine, but included a redesigned cabin to add another two passenger seats. Only three of these were built, modified from FC-2W2s, but the cabin modification was retained in the Model 71.

Other equipment included droppable sonobuoys, electronic warfare support measures, an Autolycus diesel fume detection system and a magnetic anomaly detector (MAD) system. A special camera bay housed several reconnaissance cameras capable of medium altitude and nighttime <b>vertical</b> <b>photography,</b> and low-altitude oblique photography. The crew would also perform visual searches using various lookout positions that were provided for this purpose.

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is described}} to use spectral signatures {{as indicators of}} the vegetative status in rice paddy cultures. Ground cover and leaf area index(LAI), considered as indicators of above-ground biomass, and were measured in the field using indirect techniques of digitized close-range <b>vertical</b> <b>photography</b> and Licor 2000 instrument readings, as well as direct destructive sampling. Simultaneously, field reflectance values were collected over specific spectral bandwidths using a handheld radiometer. Several vegetation indices were derived from these spectral measurements and their predictive power (individually or in combination) with respect to field-measured ground cover and LAI quantified. The additional effects of plant chlorophyll content, paddy depth, water sediment load, and bottom layer color were also investigated. None of these variables added significantly to the predictive power of the models.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{examines}} {{the potential for}} using archival colour <b>vertical</b> aerial <b>photography</b> to map the spatial location, distribution, extent and changes over time in weedmat coverage for the Ythan estuary, North East Scotland, UK. Archival colour aerial photography scanned into a computer, and processed using image processing techniques resulted {{in a series of}} mosaiced images for visual interpretation of the location and extent of weedmats for each year of photography selected. Input of the imagery into a Geographical Information System (GIS) enabled the derivation of maps showing change and quantitative estimates of the areal coverage of macro-algal weedmats for each year. It is concluded that macro-algal weedmats can easily be differentiated on colour aerial photography from background mud and sand deposits, but {{it is not possible to}} reliably separate individual macro-algal species from each other, or to distinguish weedmat densities without the availability of additional co-incident field data...|$|R

40|$|Evaluation of low {{altitude}} oblique photography {{obtained by}} hand-held cameras was useful in determining specifications of operational mission requirements for conventional smaller-scaled <b>vertical</b> <b>photography.</b> Remote sensing techniques {{were used to}} assess the rapid destruction of marsh areas at Pointe Mouillee.

A land cover inventory, mapped from aerial photography, provided essential data necessary for determining adjacent lands suitable for marshland development. To quantitatively assess the wetlands environment, a detailed inventory of vegetative communities (19 categories) was made using color infrared photography and intensive ground truth. A carefully selected and well laid-out transect was found to be a key asset to photointerpretation and to the analysis of vegetative conditions. Transect data provided the interpreter with locally representative areas of various vegetative types. This facilitated development of a photointerpretation key. Additional information on vegetative conditions in the area was also obtained by evaluating the transect data...|$|E
40|$|An {{approach}} for the co-registration of Digital Surface Models (DSMs) derived from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Terrestrial Laser Scanners (TLS) is proposed. Specifically, a wavelet-based feature descriptor for matching surface keypoints on the 2. 5 D DSMs is developed.
