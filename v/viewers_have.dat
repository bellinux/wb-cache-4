The real company, which also sells paper and office supplies, has welcomed the exposure (and increase in business) {{and has a}} ground-floor showroom where it sells both its products and T-shirts with the tower. It plans to add a Dunder Mifflin logo to the circular insets {{near the top of}} the tower. Mifflin Avenue ends adjacent to the Penn Paper & Supply building.|$|E

5|$|Ibira {{initially}} pictured Karas as {{a horror}} {{story with a}} vengeance theme. It had a simple plot similar to the manga, Dororo. The protagonist karas is on a quest, slaughtering mikuras to recover the body parts of his murdered lover. Until he recovers all the parts, he assembles them into a katana to kill the mikuras. The final version of Karas {{was more of a}} superhero action story, and originally intended for three leading heroes in the same vein as the Japanese period drama, Sanbiki ga Kiru!. The characters Otoha, Nue, and the human detective Kure were the leads but the final version primarily focused on Otoha. The presentation of Karas differs in several ways from typical anime. The show maintains a serious tone and never indulges in slapstick, exaggerated facial expressions, or super deformed characters. It avoids heavy expositions. Dialogue tends to be short and <b>viewers</b> <b>have</b> to infer what is going on based on very little presented information. The team had left out substantial amounts of information from the show, printing them in a booklet of the final DVD package.|$|E

5|$|Michael J. Fox as Milo James Thatch, a {{linguist}} and cartographer at the Smithsonian who {{was recruited}} to decipher The Shepherd's Journal while directing {{an expedition to}} Atlantis. Kirk Wise, one of the directors, said that they chose Fox for the role because they felt he gave his character his own personality and made them more believable on screen. Fox said that voice acting was much easier than his past experience with live action {{because he did not}} have to worry about what he looked like in front of a camera while delivering his lines. The directors mentioned that Fox was also offered a role for Titan A.E.; he allowed his son to choose which film he would work on, and he chose Atlantis. <b>Viewers</b> <b>have</b> noted similarities between Milo and the film's language consultant, Marc Okrand, who developed the Atlantean language used in the film. Okrand stated that Milo's supervising animator, John Pomeroy, sketched him, claiming not to know how a linguist looked or acted.|$|E
5|$|On December 29, 2006, Nielsen Media Research (NMR) {{reported}} {{the results of}} having, for the first time, monitored viewers who use a digital video recorder to record shows for later viewing. NMR reported that 30 Rock adds nearly 7.5% to its total audience every week {{as a result of}} viewers who use a DVR to record the show and then watch it within a week of its initial airing. A March 2007 report from MAGNA Global, based on NMR data about viewership ranked by among adults 25–54, shows that as of the time of the report 30 Rocks <b>viewers</b> <b>have</b> a median income of $65,000, high enough to place the show tied at 11th in affluence with several other shows. This is during a period where for the season 30 Rock is tied at number 85 in the 18–49 demographic. During its second season, 30 Rock ranked in fourth place, against all primetime programming, for television series which are watched by viewers with income above $100,000. Following Fey's popular impressions of Alaskan governor Sarah Palin on Saturday Night Live, the third-season premiere was seen by 8.5million viewers, making it the highest-viewed episode in the series. The premiere earned a 4.1 preliminary adults 18–49 rating, an increase of 21% from the second-season premiere.|$|E

25|$|MGM {{planned to}} replace Harlow in Saratoga with either Jean Arthur or Virginia Bruce; {{but due to}} public objections, the film was {{finished}} using three doubles (one for close-ups, one for long shots and one for dubbing Harlow's lines) and rewriting some scenes without her; subsequent <b>viewers</b> <b>have</b> since tried to spot signs of Harlow's illness or clearly perceive the scenes where Harlow {{was replaced by a}} double.|$|E
25|$|A {{frequent}} {{criticism of}} Resnais's films among English-language commentators {{has been that}} they are emotionally cold; {{that they are all}} about technique without grasp of character or subject, that his understanding of beauty is compromised by a lack of sensuousness, and that his seriousness of intent fails to communicate itself to audiences. Elsewhere however it is suggested that such views are partly based on a misreading of the films, especially his earlier ones, which has impeded an appreciation of the humour and irony which pervade his work; and other <b>viewers</b> <b>have</b> been able to make the connection between the film's form and its human dimension.|$|E

25|$|In April 2006, Disney {{announced}} that Lost {{would be available}} for free online in streaming format, with advertising, on ABC's website, {{as part of a}} two-month experiment of future distribution strategies. The trial, which ran from May to June 2006, caused a stir among network affiliates who were afraid of being cut out of advertising revenue. The streaming of Lost episodes direct from ABC's website was only available to viewers in the United States due to international licensing agreements. In 2009, Lost was named the most-watched show on the Internet based on viewers of episodes on ABC's website. The Nielsen Company reported that 1.425million unique <b>viewers</b> <b>have</b> watched at least one episode on ABC's website.|$|E
25|$|The {{new season}} marked a {{significant}} change in format for Hockey Night, as games are no longer split by region. Instead, CBC is joined by Rogers' over-the-air City network, the Sportsnet family of specialty channels, and FX Canada, who air other games nationally alongside CBC and share the Hockey Night in Canada branding. Decisions on network assignments for the games are made on a week-by-week basis, and ensure that <b>viewers</b> <b>have</b> on-air access to every Hockey Night game as they are being played. CBC continues to feature coverage of the NHL All-Star Game, Stanley Cup Playoffs and Stanley Cup Final, though it may be possible for coverage of the latter to be simulcast on a Rogers network if needed. The NHL Winter Classic aired in 2015 on CBC, but moved exclusively to Sportsnet the following year.|$|E
25|$|Product {{placement}} within Irish produced programming {{had previously}} been banned by broadcasting authorities in Ireland, though in the past Irish <b>viewers</b> <b>have</b> been used to product placement as seen on US television and film productions. Due to an EU ruling made in 2007, Irish broadcasters can now place products within programming mainly entertainment shows, though excludes programming which is deemed mainly 'news and current affairs' and programming aimed at children. On 15 August 2011 {{it was confirmed that}} TV3 would become the first official broadcaster to implement the new broadcasting terms. Kenco reportedly paid TV3 Group a six-figure sum to place its branding on two key early morning television shows mainly, The Morning Show and Midday from September 2011. Similar to RTÉ and TG4 broadcasters will have to air the logo 'PP' {{at the beginning and end}} of the show to inform viewers that products will appear on the show. RTÉ Television has previously used product placement on its series The Late Late Show.|$|E

25|$|The EBU {{announced}} on 18 February 2016 {{that a new}} voting system would be implemented at the contest {{for the first time}} since 1975. The new system, inspired by the voting system of Melodifestivalen, involves each country now awarding two sets of points from 1-8, 10 and 12: one from their professional jury and the other from televoting. Televoting votes from all the countries are pooled. After <b>viewers</b> <b>have</b> cast their votes, the results of each professional jury are presented, with countries receiving 1-8 and 10 points being displayed on-screen instead of 1-7, which had been the case since , and the national spokesperson announcing only the country to which they award 12 points. After the results of the professional juries are presented, the televoting points from all participating countries are combined, providing one score for each song. The results of countries finishing between 11th and 26th in the public vote are automatically added to the scoreboard, with only the results of the top ten countries being announced by the hosts. The new voting system is also used to determine the qualifiers from each semi-final, but as before the qualifiers are announced in a random order.|$|E
