5000|$|Xylocopa violacea, the <b>violet</b> <b>{{carpenter}}</b> <b>bee,</b> is {{the common}} European species of carpenter bee, {{and one of the}} largest bees in Europe. It is also native to Asia.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Violet</b> <b>carpenter</b> <b>bees</b> {{hibernate}} overwinter {{and they}} {{emerge in the}} spring, usually around April or May. Hibernation is undertaken by the adults in wood where there are abandoned nest tunnels. In the late spring or early summer, they may be seen around searching for mates and suitable nesting sites. After mating, the gravid females bore tunnels in dead wood, {{which is where the}} name [...] "carpenter bee" [...] comes from, although old nest tunnels may be used.|$|R

5000|$|The California <b>carpenter</b> <b>bee,</b> Xylocopa californica, is {{a species}} of <b>carpenter</b> <b>bee</b> in the order Hymenoptera. It is native to western North America.|$|R
40|$|<b>Carpenter</b> <b>bees</b> are large, hairy bees in {{the genus}} Xylocopa and order Hymenoptera. There are over 500 species of <b>carpenter</b> <b>bees</b> {{distributed}} worldwide. In Utah, {{we have two}} common species, X. californica and X. tabaniformis. <b>Carpenter</b> <b>bees</b> in Utah are most likely found in Washington, Kane and Garfield counties, and are rarely found in Salt Lake and Utah counties...|$|R
50|$|Xylocopa micans, {{also known}} as the {{southern}} <b>carpenter</b> <b>bee,</b> is a species of bee within Xylocopa, the genus of <b>carpenter</b> <b>bees.</b> The southern <b>carpenter</b> <b>bee</b> can be found mainly in the coastal and gulf regions of the southeastern United States, as well as Mexico and Guatemala. Like all Xylocopa bees, X. micans bees excavate nests in woody plant material. However, unlike its sympatric species Xylocopa virginica, X. micans has not been found to construct nest galleries in structural timbers of building, making it less of an economic nuisance to humans. <b>Carpenter</b> <b>bees</b> have a wide range of mating strategies between different species. The southern <b>carpenter</b> <b>bee</b> exhibits a polymorphic mating strategy, with its preferred method of mating changing as the season progresses from early spring to mid summer. Like most bees in its genus, the southern <b>carpenter</b> <b>bee</b> is considered a solitary bee because it does not live in colonies.|$|R
50|$|Xylocopa bombylans, {{the peacock}} <b>carpenter</b> <b>bee,</b> is {{a species of}} <b>carpenter</b> <b>bee</b> found in Australia. It gets its common name by its habit of {{burrowing}} into wood.|$|R
50|$|A. maculosum is a {{carder bee}} that competes with other <b>carpenter</b> <b>bees,</b> such as Xylocopa californica arizonensis for trap-nest sites. A. maculosum prevent <b>carpenter</b> <b>bee</b> nests from being established.|$|R
50|$|Non-professionals {{commonly}} confuse <b>carpenter</b> <b>bees</b> with bumblebees; {{the simplest}} {{rule of thumb}} for telling them apart is that most <b>carpenter</b> <b>bees</b> have a shiny abdomen, whereas bumblebee abdomens are completely covered with dense hair. Males of some species of <b>carpenter</b> <b>bees</b> have a white or yellow face, unlike bumblebees, while females lack the bare corbicula of bumblebees; the hind leg is entirely hairy.|$|R
50|$|The {{subfamily}} Xylocopinae (family Apidae) occurs worldwide, {{and includes}} the large <b>carpenter</b> <b>bees</b> (tribe Xylocopini), the small <b>carpenter</b> <b>bees</b> (tribe Ceratinini), the allodapine bees (tribe Allodapini), and the relictual genus Manuelia (tribe Manueliini).|$|R
5000|$|The California <b>carpenter</b> <b>bee</b> is all black, {{as other}} Xylocopa species−the large <b>carpenter</b> <b>bees</b> are, and has some bluish/greenish reflections. The male has some lighter {{markings}} on the pronotum (dorsal prothorax) and the abdominal segments.|$|R
50|$|Xylocopa aerata, the golden-green <b>carpenter</b> <b>bee,</b> {{is one of}} {{two species}} of <b>carpenter</b> <b>bee</b> found in the Sydney region of New South Wales in Australia. It gets its common name by its habit of {{burrowing}} into wood.|$|R
50|$|Female <b>carpenter</b> <b>bees</b> {{are black}} and male <b>carpenter</b> <b>bees</b> are {{characterized}} by their gold cover. Excellent pollinators, the <b>carpenter</b> <b>bees</b> are found all over the United States including valley and foothill areas. Additionally, they are not harmful and the males do not have stingers, which means they pose little harm to humans. They boast a large thoracic gland {{that is used to}} gather pheromones to attract mates, which suggests a lek is probable.|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} <b>carpenter</b> <b>bee</b> {{is unique}} among the genus Xylocopa {{in that it}} demonstrates two forms of mating strategies. In the early spring, the southern <b>carpenter</b> <b>bee</b> utilizes resource defense polygyny. Males structure territories around floral resources {{in order to take}} advantage of clumped distributions of females. Later in the season, toward July and August, southern <b>carpenter</b> <b>bees</b> are observed opting instead for lek polygyny, where males hold territories at nonflowering plants and landmarks such as small hills and prominent vegetation.|$|R
50|$|In Malaysia, {{tropical}} <b>carpenter</b> <b>bees</b> often choose useful structural woods as nesting sites, as {{they are}} able to burrow through it with their powerful mandibles. Tropical <b>carpenter</b> <b>bees</b> construct multiple galleries (3 - 5) of about 11 cm in length and 2.1 - 2.3 cm in diameter.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Carpenter</b> <b>bees</b> {{are notorious}} for {{damaging}} man-made “wooden structures, lead cables, fiberglass insulation, and Styrofoam”. Despite their large size and widespread distribution they do not cause severe damage because of their slow development, reuse of nests, and preference of species to develop in trees rather than in structural timber. The <b>carpenter</b> <b>bees</b> are essential due to their pollination ability of various species of flowers. Their large body size makes them the natural pollinators of large flowers such as Passiflora and Luffa species and of other fruits and vegetables. In a Brazilian study, a single <b>carpenter</b> <b>bee</b> pollinated as many Passiflora flowers as an entire colony of honey bees. A major reason {{for the failure of}} attempted Xylocopa utilization in pollination has probably been that no food sources were available to the bees once the crop to be pollinated was no longer in bloom. [...] However, the large <b>carpenter</b> <b>bees</b> have the potential to become an important aid in agricultural systems, especially where honey bees are not as effective. Before agricultural benefits can be gained from <b>carpenter</b> <b>bees</b> the management of semi wild populations must first be achieved.|$|R
