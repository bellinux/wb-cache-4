25|$|Earlier {{societies}} of hunter-gatherer tribes had no social stratification, and later {{societies of}} the Bronze Age had noticeable social stratification, which saw {{the creation of}} occupational specialization, the state and social classes of individuals who were of the elite ruling or religious classes, full-time warriors and wealthy merchants, contrasted with those individuals {{on the other end}} of the economic spectrum who were poor, enslaved and hungry. In between these two economic models (the hunter-gatherer tribes and Bronze Age civilisations) we find the later Neolithic and Eneolithic societies such as the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture, where the first indications of social stratification began to be found. However, it would be a mistake to overemphasise the impact of social stratification in the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture, since it was still (even in its later phases) <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>an</b> egalitarian society. And of course, social stratification was just one of the many aspects of what is regarded as a fully established civilised society, which began to appear in the Bronze Age.|$|E

500|$|Although Strange Days is {{generally}} {{classified as a}} science fiction thriller, the film uses multiple dramatic and narrative elements, including film noir conventions like the femme fatale (Faith Justin).

In 2001, cultural critic Steven Shaviro compared Strange Days to Cameron's earlier films, stating that the film [...] "has characters that the viewer is supposed to identify with, and a plot full of thrills, exciting action sequences and unexpected twists. But at the same time, Strange Days is <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>an</b> experimental film, one that questions and inverts the traditional and Hollywood structures of identification and involvement, {{in ways that are}} consonant with the ideas that have been put forward by feminist film criticism over the last thirty years." [...] The film's dystopian society and use of SQUID technology, which has been compared to the [...] "simstim" [...] technology in William Gibson's 1984 novel Neuromancer, were also considered cyberpunk concepts.|$|E
