40|$|A {{dissertation}} {{submitted to}} the Department of Computer Science and Engineering for the Degree of Master of Business of Administration in Information TechnologyABSTRACT The accounting software industry in Sri Lanka can be classified into three product market segments, one is the government sector which is backed by department of state accounts under ministry of finance, {{the second is the}} large scale private sector organizations using enterprise solutions, and the third is the large and SME private sector organizations using mass market accounting software packages. The private sector is backed by <b>value</b> <b>added</b> <b>resellers</b> of offshore accounting software products and domestic software development firms. Our research is focused in the segment of mass market accounting software packages and their usage. The major problem in the segment is although popular accounting software packages are available and being used by various organizations, many organizations are not fully satisfied with the solutions due to various reasons which fall under cither product aspects or service aspects. So there need to be an assessment done on accounting software product quality and service quality and find ways to improve customer satisfaction. The goal of the research is to identify the gaps between perceived and excepted customer satisfaction levels of accounting software products and services. This is accomplished by developing a conceptual model to measure the customer satisfaction. The resear chvariables measured under product quality assessment are: accounting software modules, features, customization capability, and technology. Under the service quality assessment, the five dimensions of popular SERVQUAL methodology (Parasuraman et al. 1988) are measured. Also the service provider image assessment is done b> measuring the service provider background coupled with overall product and servicequalities. Based on this approach recommendations arc made to promote the local accounting software industry...|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 30 -November 02, 1995 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaThe {{remote sensing}} {{industry}} is experiencing an unprecedented rush of activity to deploy commercial and scientific satellites. NASA and its international partners {{are leading the}} scientific charge with The Earth Observation System (EOS) and the International Space Station Alpha (ISSA). Additionally, {{there are at least}} ten countries promoting scientific/commercial remote sensing satellite programs. Within the United States, commercial initiatives are being under taken by a number of companies including Computer Technology Associates, Inc., EarthWatch, Inc., Space Imaging, Inc., Orbital Imaging Corporation and TRW, Inc. This activity is due to factors including: technological advances which have lead to significant reductions in the costs to build and deploy satellites; an awareness of the importance of understanding human impact on the ecosystem; and a desire to collect and sell data some believe will be worth 1. 5 billion (USD) per year within five years. The success and usefulness of these initiatives, both scientific and commercial, depends largely on the ease and cost of providing remotely sensed data to <b>value</b> <b>added</b> <b>resellers</b> and end-users. A number of these spacecraft will provide an interface directly to users. To provide these data to the largest possible user base, ground station equipment must be affordable and the data must be distributed in a timely manner (meaning seconds or minutes, not days) over commercial network and communications equipment. TSI TelSys, Inc. is developing ground station equipment that will perform both traditional telemetry processing and the bridging and routing functions required to seamlessly interface commercial local- and wide-area networks and satellite communication networks. These products are based on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) components and pipelined, multi-processing architectures.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to provide the Born Global company 3 D Perception (3 DP) with advice on how they can prepare to further {{penetrate}} the market in China, especially the control room market. Due to limited knowledge of the conditions in China we chose to use an exploratory research design, {{with an emphasis on}} in-depth interviews supplemented by relevant secondary sources. Firstly, the thesis provides information on how and why 3 DP should make internal changes in the organization and in their relationship with their <b>value</b> <b>added</b> <b>resellers</b> (VARs) in China, in order to increase control and be well prepared for further market penetration in the control room market. Secondly, the thesis discusses unique market characteristics in China 3 DP needs to be aware of to adapt their business model to the Chinese market. Particularly 3 DP should develop strong relationships both with their own employees in China, to their VARs and in a more long-term perspective, to their end-customers. This would enable 3 DP to more thoroughly understand the Chinese customers’ needs and wants. Therefore we have also investigated what product attributes 3 DP should emphasize in the Chinese control room market. Thirdly, though this is not the main focus of the thesis we have investigated whether there is a potential for growth in the Chinese control room market. We have found strong economic indicators such as the 4 trillion RMB stimulation package and the 65 billion RMB independent investments in upgrading the electrical grid, to be strong evidence of a growth potential in this market. Based on the findings in this thesis it is likely that 3 DP can succeed in the control room market in China. For this potential to be realized 3 DP should hire a manager skilled in Western management style and with strong interpersonal skills. 3 DP should introduce incentive systems for their employees and hire sufficient manpower so {{that they will be able}} to service their customers properly, thus acquiring more knowledge about unique customer needs and wants in the Chinese control room market. Finally 3 DP should work to obtain references from satisfied customers in the control room market...|$|R
