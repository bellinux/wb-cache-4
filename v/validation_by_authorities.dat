Today, this consists mostly of medical ambulance organisations and organisations for disaster relief (Katastrophenschutz). This was subject to <b>validation</b> <b>by</b> local <b>authorities,</b> who usually were allowed a certain contingent of such volunteers per year of birth. Thus, {{organizations such as the}} Technical Relief Service (Technisches Hilfswerk, THW), volunteer Fire Departments, or other emergency assistance and crisis management agencies such as the Red Cross were supported in performing their volunteer services in disaster response. In the ambulance services, their service could overlap with the service of conscientious objectors.|$|R

40|$|As {{with any}} new theory, it is {{necessary}} to validate the basic construct of vocational maturity. Once this is done, instruments to measure vocational maturity, or decision making, can be evaluated. With this as an objective, this paper discusses some of the problems associated with measuring vocational maturity, such as identifying variables, methods of data collection, and item selection procedures. The selection and definition of related vocational maturity variables is complicated by the lack of a well-defined taxonomy. r-hoice of methodology is difficulty, since three approaches have been used in previous data gathering [...] the partially structured interview, the structured interview, and fixed alternative questions. The paper also examines the basic assumptions regarding vocational maturity as well as <b>validation</b> <b>by</b> internal and external evidence. <b>Validation</b> <b>by</b> internal evidence=is discussed in terms of the four dimensions of Crites, model: (1) Consistency of Vocational Choice, (2) Wisdom of Vocational Choice, (3) Vocational Choice Competencies, and (4) Vocational Choice Attitudes. <b>Validation</b> <b>by</b> external evidence presents problems in Olaf: the existing data regarding external evidence is somewhat limited at the present time.
