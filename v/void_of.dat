5|$|As Boyce's {{interest}} in philanthropy grew, {{he turned to}} his childhood experiences in the outdoors as a resource, but could not find a way to channel his charitable ideas and dreams until a fateful stop to England while en route to what became the failed photographic expedition to Africa. Events in London on the way to and from this expedition would lead to the founding of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA), one of many civic and professional organizations formed during the Progressive Era to fill the <b>void</b> <b>of</b> citizens who had become distended from their rural roots. Many youth organizations such as the Woodcraft Indians and Sons of Daniel Boone formed in America in the early 1900s focusing on outdoor character-building activities. The writings and adventures of Theodore Roosevelt contributed to these movements, with their outdoor, nature, and pioneer themes. By the time of his 1922 expedition to Africa, Boyce was so well respected in Scouting that French Boy Scouts in Algeria saluted him and offered to escort him along a trail when they found out he was the founder of BSA and LSA in America.|$|E

5|$|The road {{followed}} by Alboin to reach Italy {{has been the}} subject of controversy, as is the length of the trek. According to Neil Christie the Lombards divided themselves into migrational groups, with a vanguard scouting the road, probably following the Poetovio – Celeia – Emona – Forum Iulii route, while the wagons and most of the people proceeded slowly behind because of the goods and chattels they brought with them, and possibly also because they were waiting for the Saxons to join them on the road. By September raiding parties were looting Venetia, but it was probably only in 569 that the Julian Alps were crossed at the Vipava Valley; the eyewitness Secundus of Non gives the date as May 20 or 21. The 569 date for the entry into Italy is not <b>void</b> <b>of</b> difficulties however, and Jörg Jarnut believes the conquest of most of Venetia had already been completed in 568. According to Carlo Guido Mor, a major difficulty remains in explaining how Alboin could have reached Milan on September 3 assuming he had passed the border only in the May of the same year.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Ophelia {{continued}} to intensify {{as it moved}} west-northwest. Curved convective bands became prominent in the northern semicircle of the cyclone, and deep convection developed near the center. This intensification trend was short-lived, however, as increased wind shear from a nearby upper-level low caused the low-level center to become partially exposed. Despite the poor presentation on satellite imagery, data from a nearby buoy revealed that the system was stronger than previously thought, with maximum sustained winds of 65mph (100km/h) on September22. As the upper-level low moved closer to Ophelia, inducing increasingly unfavorable shear on the storm, it caused the low-pressure area to become completely <b>void</b> <b>of</b> thunderstorms. While deep convection waned significantly early on September23, it made a comeback by that afternoon, and an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft found 60mph (95km/h) winds in the system, much stronger than the intensity of 45mph (75km/h) the system was assessed with before the flight. This intensity did not maintain long as the cloud pattern once again became disorganized. The low-level center became exposed once again during the pre-dawn hours of September25, and without the return of organized shower and thunderstorm activity, led to the NHC declaring Ophelia as a remnant area of low pressure, while situated 180mi (290km) east of the northern Leeward Islands.|$|E

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{morphology}} of galaxies {{living in the}} proximity <b>of</b> cosmic <b>voids,</b> using a sample <b>of</b> <b>voids</b> identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7. At all stellar masses, void galaxies exhibit morphologies of a later type than galaxies in a control sample, which represent galaxies in an average density environment. We interpret this trend as a pure environmental effect, independent of the mass bias, due to a slower galaxy build-up in the rarefied regions <b>of</b> <b>voids.</b> We confirm previous findings about a clear segregation in galaxy morphology, with galaxies of a later type being found at smaller void-centric distances {{with respect to the}} early-type galaxies. We also show, for the first time, that the radius <b>of</b> the <b>void</b> has an impact on the evolutionary history of the galaxies that live within it or in its surroundings. In fact, an enhanced fraction of late-type galaxies is found in the proximity <b>of</b> <b>voids</b> larger than the median void radius. Likewise, an excess of early-type galaxies is observed within or around <b>voids</b> <b>of</b> a smaller size. A significant difference in galaxy properties in <b>voids</b> <b>of</b> different sizes is observed up to 2 Rvoid, which we define as the region <b>of</b> influence <b>of</b> <b>voids.</b> The significance <b>of</b> this difference is greater than 3 sigma for all the volume-complete samples considered here. The fraction of star-forming galaxies shows the same behavior as the late-type galaxies, but no significant difference in stellar mass is observed in the proximity <b>of</b> <b>voids</b> <b>of</b> different sizes.
