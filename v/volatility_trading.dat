Some analysts have suggested the increasing offshoring of the supply chain, or vertical specialization (VS) trade, can explain the apparent increase in <b>volatility</b> of <b>trade</b> over the business cycle.

While the simulated model generates the observed increase in relative <b>volatility</b> of <b>trade</b> to GDP from 1967 to 2002, most of the increase is due to GDP’s shift to less volatile services production.

40|$|The Relationship Between <b>Volatility</b> and <b>Trading</b> Volume in The Indonesian Stock Exchange There {{are a lot}} {{of studies}} that examine the {{relationship}} between <b>volatility</b> and <b>trading</b> volume in the stock exchange. This study is conducted to examine the role of trading frequency and volume in explaining the volatility-volume relationship in the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX). The analysis is conducted at the firm level with samples of 38 individual stocks from January 2012 to December 2013. The results show that there is a positive relationship between <b>volatility</b> and <b>trading</b> frequency as well as between <b>volatility</b> and <b>trading</b> volume.

40|$|We use a {{model of}} {{international}} trade to show that (i) trade affects exchange rate volatility and (ii) exchange rate <b>volatility</b> impacts <b>trade</b> in goods differently according to their degree of differentiation. In particular, commodity goods are less affected by exchange rate volatility than more highly differentiated products. These insights allow us to structurally address {{one of the main}} shortcomings of the existing empirical literature on the effects of exchange rate <b>volatility</b> on <b>trade</b> – the failure to correct for reverse causality. Using disaggregate trade data for a large number of countries for the period 1970 - 1997 we find strong results supporting predictions (i) and (ii). We then use these results to uncover the e¤ect of exchange rate <b>volatility</b> on <b>trade.</b> We find that once we address the reverse-causality problem, the large effects of <b>volatility</b> on <b>trade</b> found in previous literature are greatly reduced. ...|$|R

In addition, this negative effect of volatility is mainly induced by the unanticipated volatility and has an even greater impact than that of tariffs.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{empirical evidence}} on the viability of a form of <b>volatility</b> <b>trading</b> known as "dispersion trading. " The results {{shed light on the}} efficiency with which U. S. options markets price volatility. Using end-of-day implied volatilities extracted from equity option prices for the stocks that comprise the S&P 500, the implied volatility of the S&P 500 is computed using a modification of the Markowitz variance equation. This Markowitz-implied volatility is then compared to the implied volatility of the S&P 500 extracted directly from index options on the S&P 500. These contemporaneous measures of implied volatility are then examined for exploitable discrepancies both with and without transaction costs. The study covers the period October 31, 2005 through November 1, 2007. It is shown that, from a trader's perspective, index option implied volatility tended to be more often "rich" and component volatilities tended to be more often "cheap. " Nevertheless, there were times when the opposite was true; suggesting that potential dispersion trades can run in either direction.

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the use of GARCH models, Neural Network Regression (NNR), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) {{regression}} and model combinations for forecasting and trading currency volatility, with an application to the GBP/USD and USD/JPY exchange rates. Both {{the results of the}} NNR/RNN models and the model combination results are benchmarked against the simpler GARCH alternative. The idea of developing a nonlinear nonparametric approach to forecast FX volatility, identify mispriced options and subsequently develop a trading strategy based upon this process is intuitively appealing. Using daily data from December 1993 through April 1999, we develop alternative FX volatility forecasting models. These models are then tested out-of-sample over the period April 1999 -May 2000, {{not only in terms of}} forecasting accuracy, but also in terms of trading efficiency: In order to do so, we apply a realistic <b>volatility</b> <b>trading</b> strategy using FX option straddles once mispriced options have been identified. Allowing for transaction costs, most trading strategies retained produce positive returns. RNN models appear as the best single modelling approach yet, somewhat surprisingly, model combination which has the best overall performance in terms of forecasting accuracy, fails to improve the RNN-based <b>volatility</b> <b>trading</b> results.
