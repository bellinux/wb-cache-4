Reiki is a vibrational or subtle energy therapy believed to balance the human body’s biofi eld and strengthen the body’s ability to heal itself.

40|$|International audienceIn {{this study}} we start from a {{modelization}} by finite elements of a 150 m high tower and try to introduce various control scenarii into the model. The model is realistic in terms of orders of physical size for masses, stiffnesses and other geometrical and mechanical data. We hope to compare control strategies on this model. Each of the control process is compatible with a technological achievement (e. g dampers). The control is provided by actuators that must {{be located in the}} building. We compare the energies to get in each control type and the reached efficiency. The global target is to find out a control law model technologically transposable to an actual structure and to define the best control strategy, i. e. to find out the best compromise between the energy to be provided, the reducing in vibratory levels, the actuator location and the actuator operating safety. These elements could be defined as "control criteria". Among the several possible sollicitations, we will focus on seism-type sollicitations and will define the actuators location in relation to the building architecture.

40|$|In this paper, {{we will be}} {{combining}} experimental {{modal analysis}} and finite-element modeling to re-design a base plate of a mechanical system made up of steel sheets {{in order to reduce}} its level of vibrations, which are responsible for undesirable noises. The new model to be designed must be longer than the current one, and it was agreed with our industrial partner that the solution to be proposed must not generate additional production costs, i. e., we must only modify the shapes of the base plate to rigidify it, without adding any damping materials. To {{come up with a new}} design for the base plate having the same defects, it was necessary to study the vibratory behavior of the current model in order to know the causes of the high <b>vibratory</b> <b>level.</b> We thus performed experimental modal and harmonic analyses of the entire system and of some of its parts separately, in order to progressively build and update a reliable finite-element model. After observing the mode shapes of the base plate, we came up with four possible new designs. The finite-element model of each new design has undergone both a modal and a harmonic analysis. Some assumptions were made when simulating the multi-frequency excitation force produced by the electric motor on the finite-element model. Using the results of these simulations, we could classify the various models according to a specific criterion: the best conception was useful as the basis for the design of a final model, because we noticed that certain forms or certain present on the other models contribute to a reduction of the amplitude of the vibrations. The final model comprises a synthesis of the strong points of four previously designed models. The modal and harmonic analysis carried out on the finite-element model of the last design showed that it presented a better vibratory behavior compared with the others...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007 In this thesis, {{the author}} contextualises {{condition}} monitoring of {{active magnetic bearing}} (AMB) systems and proposes the real-time condition monitoring of AMB systems. Three real-time fault detection, diagnosis, correction and identification schemes for vibration forces on the rotor of a rotational AMB system are proposed. Two AMB systems were used to conduct this research. The one was a fully suspended 250 kW water cooling AMB pump from which historical fault data was obtained {{and the other was}} an experimental double radial AMB test rack on which the three real-time schemes were implemented. The historical fault data obtained from the AMB pump were categorised into subsynchronous, rotor synchronous and supersynchronous vibration forces. It was decided to use the historical fault data to induce the same fault conditions that occurred on the AMB pump on the AMB test rack. Various fault detection techniques were implemented on the historical fault data. This was done to obtain the best technique for a specific fault condition. These techniques together with the historical fault data were used {{in the design of the}} three real-time schemes. The focus of this research is on external faults, since the research of internal faults to the magnetic bearing control system is well established. Various schemes exist where off-line diagnosis and identification of internal and external faults are performed on AMB systems, but the area of real-time identification and correction of external faults still needs to be explored. This study proposes three real-time detection, diagnosis, correction and identification schemes for external faults to the magnetic bearing control system of rotational AMB systems. These schemes use the available AMB sensors and actuators to perform condition monitoring and correction, since machine components in industrial applications operate in harsh environments and are not always easily accessible to install condition monitoring equipment. The last scheme focuses on real-time multiple frequency fault detection, diagnosis, correction and identification of external faults on rotational AMB systems, since more than one fault can occur simultaneously on the AMB system. Analysis of a multiple frequency fault by a single frequency fault scheme causes incorrect identification and correction of the fault. Four articles were submitted for publication on the three real-time schemes. The three real-time schemes perform three main tasks: 1) fault detection, 2) fault diagnosis and error correction and 3) fault identification. Displacement and current masking were performed during the fault detection stage. The vibratory amplitudes and frequencies were extracted by means of the Wigner-Ville distribution. Discrete sampling of the displacement and current signals of the physical AMB system was performed by the dSPACE 1104 controller board. Pattern recognition techniques, statistical diagnosis, cascaded fuzzy logic and pattern construction were used to calculate fault features during the fault diagnosis and error correction stages. Error correction algorithms were used to correct the fault during the error correction stage. During the fault identification stage, data fitting, fuzzy logic, IS 0 standards and pattern recognition were used to calculate the type, parameters, <b>vibratory</b> <b>level</b> and zone of the vibration force. A historical fault database was used during the identification process. Correction factors were calculated to observe the improvement each scheme has over the optimised PID controller when vibration forces are applied. Scheme 3 provided the best result for improving subsynchronous vibration forces, scheme 1 the best for rotor synchronous vibration forces and scheme 2 the best for supersynchronous vibration forces. Scheme 3 provided the best overall result with the best average improvement. All three real-time schemes were able to correct and minimize vibration forces to a stable operating condition. The three real-time schemes only stabilize the rotor with respect to the stator and do not remove the vibration force. When correction forces are applied to the AMB system, to correct the effect of the vibration forces, it may increases the stress of other critical components e. g. the power amplifiers and system base, which may cause components to be damaged or break down. These stressed components need to be identified by the user as critical or non-critical and the necessary steps must be taken to operate the AMB system under the fault condition or to shut down the system and repair the fault. The maximum current capability and bandwidth of the power amplifiers, run-time of the DSP processors and bandwidth of the sensors were the main factors limiting the applicability of the real-time schemes. Since the power amplifiers and sensors were designed and specified for normal operational bandwidth, it was not possible to fully evaluate supersynchronous vibration forces. Doctora...|$|E

Vibrational energy {{is proportional to the}} square of vibration velocity and can cause damage/harm. In addition, vibratory velocity provides a useful description of the sound radiation from the vibrating structure. Therefore, vibratory velocity is used as a physical index of sound radiation in this paper, with a reference velocity of 10 − 9 m/s for calculation of <b>vibratory</b> velocity <b>level.</b>|$|R
30|$|Figure  1 a, b {{illustrate}} that the <b>vibratory</b> velocity <b>level</b> of the double-track box girder is about 5  dB {{higher than that}} of the single-track box girder. Zhang et al. [18] indicated that the reason for this was that the double-track box girder was wider than the single-track girder, while the slab thicknesses of the two box girders were nearly the same. This led to larger bending deformation along the cross section, resulting in higher local vibrations in the double-track box girder.|$|R
30|$|Generally, the <b>vibratory</b> {{velocity}} <b>levels</b> {{of the web}} and {{the bottom}} slab of the U-shaped girder are concentrated in the frequency range 32 – 64  Hz. As train speed increases, <b>vibratory</b> velocity <b>level</b> increases gradually, {{and the frequency of}} the maximum vibratory velocity also increases (e.g., from the frequency band centered at 40  Hz to that at 50  Hz). On the other hand, because of the open nature of U-shaped girders, the supporting effect of the two web slabs to the bottom slab is limited. Thus, the vertical vibratory velocity of the bottom slab is greater than that of the box girders, as shown in Fig.  1 a, b, and the lateral vibratory velocity of the web slab is also high. Thus, even at lower operational speeds, U-shaped girders are likely to radiate more noise than box girders. For example, the simulation results of Wu and Liu [22] demonstrated that the structure-borne sound power radiated from a box-section viaduct was slightly lower (by 2.5  dB) than that from a U-section viaduct. They concluded, considering the differences in train excitation and the acoustic measurement environment, that the A-weighted SPL measured from the U-shaped structure should be about 2  dB higher than that from the box-section structure under the same excitation and acoustic conditions.|$|R

40|$|International audienceFor high-precision {{mechanical}} {{systems such as}} gas-turbine engines that operate under extreme conditions, it is particularly important to accurately predict {{the behavior of the}} mainshaft rolling bearings. This prediction includes, among others, the load distribution, stiffness, and power dissipation. Although the shaft speeds tends to increase, rings and shaft are becoming thinner due to size and weight constraints. Thus, the bearing behavior is now dependent on the housing and ring stiffness. Furthermore, the use of a squeeze film damper (SFD) is widespread in gas-turbine engines to significantly reduce the <b>vibratory</b> <b>levels.</b> In this case, a single thin ring provides the interface between the bearing rolling elements and the fluid film. Due to the flexibility of this ring, an elastic coupling occurs modifying the behavior of the bearing-SFD system. A global flexible bearing-SFD assembly model is proposed in this paper. Large deformations can occur, resulting in a contact between the ring common to the bearing and the SFD and its housing. To reproduce this interference, an effective mechanical stop model is also proposed. The behavior of an industrial bearing-SFD assembly is then investigated for different operating conditions. The presented results show that this coupling has a first-order influence on the behavior of the bearing-SFD system. It is also shown that such elastic coupling introduces a dissymmetry of the load distribution with respect to the applied load direction.

The vibrations were observed on the high speed part of the shaft line and both compressor and gearbox exhibited <b>vibratory</b> <b>levels</b> higher than 50 microns peak to peak on the second harmonic (H 2) of the rotational speed. The centrifugal compressor is driven via a variable speed electrical motor through a gearbox. The main characteristics of the shaft line are the following: 9 MW electrical motor running from 1250 to 1875 rpm to cover the whole operating speed range of the compressor; Gearbox with a speed ratio of 7. 035; Centrifugal compressor (back to back arrangement) from 72 to 167 bara (first stage) and from 165 to 307 bara (second stage); Low speed and high speed flexible couplings of membrane type technology. All individual components of the train were successfully tested prior to be integrated to constitute the complete shaft line package. The aerodynamics performances of the compressor were as expected, and the gear box and the compressor did not exhibit any abnormal vibratory behavior. During the ASME PTC 10 Type 1 string test of the complete package, super-synchronous vibrations were detected on the compressor and the pinion of the gearbox while the compressor was running at around 94 % speed.

The issue was solved within three months thanks to the following modifications: Gearbox bearing span increase and reduction of the overhang, by modifying the existing pinion design; New coupling with reduced moment.

40|$|Many {{microgravity}} space-science experiments require <b>vibratory</b> acceleration <b>levels</b> unachievable without active isolation. The Boeing Corporation's Active Rack Isolation System (ARIS) {{employs a}} novel combination of magnetic actuation and mechanical linkages, {{to address these}} isolation requirements on the International Space Station (ISS). ARIS provides isolation at the rack (international Standard Payload Rack, or ISPR) level. Effective model-based vibration isolation requires (1) an isolation device, (2) an adequate dynamic (i. e., mathematical) model of that isolator, and (3) a suitable, corresponding controller, ARIS provides the ISS response to the first requirement. In November 1999, the authors presented {{a response to the}} second ("A 'Kane's Dynamics' model for the Active Rack Isolation System", Hampton and Beech) intended to facilitate an optimal-controls approach to the third. This paper documents the validation of that high-fidelity dynamic model of ARIS. As before, this model contains the full actuator dynamics, however, the umbilical models are not included in this presentation. The validation of this dynamics model was achieved by utilizing two Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) software tools: Deneb's ENVISION, and Online Dynamics' AUTOLEV. ENVISION is a robotics software package developed for the automotive industry that employs 3 -dimensional (3 -D) Computer Aided Design (CAD) models to facilitate both forward and inverse kinematics analyses.

40|$|An {{unsteady}} Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes analysis {{loosely coupled}} with a comprehensive rotorcraft code is presented for a second-generation active-twist rotor. High fidelity Navier-Stokes results for three configurations: an isolated rotor, a rotor with fuselage, and a rotor with fuselage mounted in a wind tunnel, are compared to lifting-line theory based comprehensive rotorcraft code calculations and wind tunnel data. Results indicate that CFD/CSD predictions of flapwise bending moments are in good agreement with wind tunnel measurements for configurations with a fuselage, and that modeling the wind tunnel environment does not significantly enhance computed results. Actuated rotor results for the rotor with fuselage configuration are also validated for predictions of vibratory blade loads and fixed-system <b>vibratory</b> loads. Varying <b>levels</b> of agreement with wind tunnel measurements are observed for blade vibratory loads, depending on the load component (flap, lag, or torsion) and the harmonic being examined. Predicted trends in fixed-system vibratory loads are in good agreement with wind tunnel measurements...|$|R
40|$|LectureGreat {{interest}} {{is being paid}} by Oil & Gas industry {{to the design of}} high speed and high pressure ratio centrifugal compressors. Static and dynamic stresses are becoming higher and, under critical conditions, aerodynamic forcing may lead to impeller high cycle fatigue failures. Thorough aeromechanics knowledge is hence necessary for the advanced design of centrifugal compressors, to ensure reliability and life-time. Open impellers, which are commonly used for high speed applications, may be prone to relatively high vibration levels, due to aerodynamic excitations present in the flow field. Indeed, resonant crossings with forcing functions are in some cases unavoidable in variable speed machines since a wide speed range results in a wide frequency range of rotor-stator interactions, as well as flow-field circumferential distortions, occurring at multiples of the impeller excitations. Impeller forcing amplitudes and aeromechanical damping both contribute to <b>vibratory</b> response <b>levels</b> and must be properly predicted. This paper is focused on the aerodynamic damping prediction. A comprehensive study was undertaken to develop and validate aerodynamic damping prediction capability for open impellers for the operating conditions and mode shapes of interest. An extensive experimental campaign was conducted on a full scale multistage compressor equipped with transonic unshrouded impellers instrumented with strain gauges connected to a telemetry system. The strain gauge data are compared to the CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) predicted damping for blade and disk modes and show good agreement. The present paper describes the challenges related to aerodynamic damping prediction in a real machine environment taking into account complex flow features, for example flow distortions, off-design conditions and different pressure levels. The level of agreement between test data and CFD predictions achieved in this work represents a significant step forward towards building and validating a fully physics based predictive capability for open impeller forced response. In fact, such validated aerodynamic damping prediction capability is required for aeromechanic risk mitigation and accurate impeller high cycle fatigue analysis in early stages of the design process...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis {{was to develop a}} methodology to predict the vibratory stresses of a turbomachinery turbine blade. The aerodynamic excitation phenomenon was not studied in this research. Furthermore, the turbine blades studied in this research had the characteristics of being unshrouded, uncooled and used mainly in small to medium sized turbomachineries. This thesis consists of four main subjects. The first subject, composed of an analysis of experimental results, was done to ex tract damping values of the turbine blades as well as resonances. The damping values extracted from the experimental data were used to determine analytical vibratory stresses with FLARES. Furthermore, the resonances were identified during the data reduction and therefore, the experimental vibratory stresses were extracted. These values were later used to correlate the analytical vibratory stresses predicted using FLARES. The second subject elaborated on an analytical method with finite element analysis using contact elements to determine natural frequencies and mode shapes of the turbine blades. The new analysis with contact elements surpassed all expectations with respect to the current analysis being performed at Pratt & Whitney Canada. The natural frequencies were compared with experimental data, and were found to be in good agreement. Furthermore, the mode shapes were compared with the current analysis results, and were found to be identical. The third subject describes an experimental method to test the blades in a controlled environment to extract natural frequencies, damping and mode shapes. The experimental testing was not performed with great success. The main deficiency was the excitable frequency range created by the high-frequency speaker. Finally, the fourth subject compares the vibratory stress experimental values and the prediction of vibratory stresses through an analytical tool. Using the FLARES tool, the modal amplification factor was found for every resonance of the PWC Engine 1 HPT Blade, PWC Engine 2 HPT Blade and the PWC Engine 3 CT Blade. Therefore, it can be concluded that the FLARES analytical tool can predict accurate <b>vibratory</b> stress <b>levels</b> due to a resonance for an unshrouded, uncooled turbomachinery turbine blade fairly well. More work needs to be done on the CFD part of the solution to predict more accurate unsteady pressure levels at the higher engine rotating speeds...|$|R
40|$|Because {{of their}} {{peculiar}} {{ability to take}} off vertically and their excellent handling qualities in hover and low speed flight conditions, helicopters can play several roles beyond the capabilities of fixedwing aircraft. However, {{the high levels of}} vibrations and noise generated represent nowadays critical issues limiting the helicopters operations both in civilian and military cenarios. Among the several sources contributing to the overall levels of vibration and noise, the main rotor plays a fundamental role through complex aerodynamic and aeroelastic phenomena affecting its operation. The rotorcraft research community is currently involved in exploring several active and passive approaches suited to reduce these annoying effects, and a lot of attention is particularly given to noise aerodynamically generated by main rotor when blade-vortex interactions (BVIs) occur. In this context, the aim of the thesis is to provide efficient formulations for performing fast and accurate rotor aeroelastic and aeroacoustic analyses. The availability of numerically efficient tools is extremely useful, for example, in early stages of design, optimization, and control synthesis, due to the high number of simulations that might be required. Some applications of the numerical tools developed are also presented in the thesis, in order to investigate different active and passive approaches for reducing vibration and BVI noise due to the helicopter main rotor. In particular, a procedure of advanced blade optimization is investigated as passive approach. In this procedure, blade shape and its mechanical/structural properties are selected using a genetic optimization algorithm, in order to reduce annoying vibratory loads at different flight conditions. In examining active control approaches, benefits achievable through the active twist rotor (ATR) solution are evaluated, investigating control effectiveness of both high-frequency and low-frequency actuators. The optimal, multi-cyclic, control theory is applied to identify the control law driving the ATR actuation. In all the applications proposed, rotor simulations are obtained by combining aerodynamic, aeroelastic and aeroacoustic tools able to accurately capture wake-blade mutual positions, which plays a crucial role in vibration and noise generation. In particular, rotor aeroelastic behaviour is described by a non-linear, beam-like model, coupled with a quasi-steady sectional aerodynamic formulation, taking into account three-dimensional effects by a free-wake inflow correction. The evaluation of the wake inflow is obtained by a boundary element method (BEM) suited for the analysis of helicopter rotors in arbitrary flight conditions, including those affected by strong aerodynamic body-wake interactions. Concerning the noise emitted by the rotor, it is evaluated through solution of the well-known Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings equation, which governs the propagation of acoustic disturbances aerodynamically generated by moving bodies. Specifically, the boundary integral Formulation 1 A developed by Farassat is used. In this thesis, an accurate and efficient approach is presented for predicting blade airloads used for the aeroacoustic solution. It relies on the Küssner-Schwarz aerodynamic sectional theory, coupled with wake inflow information obtained through three-dimensional, free-wake aerodynamic solutions of trimmed rotor aeroelastic responses. In order to provide inflow corrections to sectional formulations used for both the aeroelastic solution and the blade airloads prediction, surrogate inflow models are also introduced in the thesis, as good trade-off solution between accuracy and computational efficiency. Furthermore, different algorithms for blade optimization and active control synthesis, aimed at efficiently exploiting aeroelastic and aeroacoustic models for the specific considered applications, are described. Several numerical investigations are presented to demonstrate the capability of the proposed approaches and examine their performance in the optimization and active control applications considered. In particular, single-point and multi-point optimization procedures are successfully applied to define low-vibrating rotor blades at the flight condition(s) considered, showing difficulties to guarantee significant vibratory loads reductions in off-design flight conditions, even if multi-point optimization is considered. A sensitivity analysis of the results obtained to the aerodynamic models used is carried out, confirming suitability of the surrogate models introduced in optimization problems. A final acoustic assessment of the optimal rotor obtained is performed, confirming the more acoustically annoying nature of low-vibrating rotors. Then, the high-frequency ATR control application is numerically investigated. Two different closed-loop controls are obtained, leading to significant reductions of the higher-harmonic noise in some areas of the acoustic field through limited blade twist imposed. In both cases, <b>vibratory</b> <b>levels</b> appears to be unaffected by control actuation, confirming the advantage of high-frequency controllers in terms of drawbacks onset. Finally, attention is focused on low-frequency ATR control strategy. In a preliminary analysis, 2 /rev frequency appears to be effective in reducing BVI noise, with limited drawbacks in terms of increase of vibratory loads and low-frequency acoustic disturbance with respect to other frequencies considered. Hence, a 2 /rev closed-loop noise control is numerically applied, showing an overall satisfactory reduction of the BVI noise in the acoustic field, with limited increase of low-frequency noise and vibratory hub loads...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the International Space Station (ISS) {{is to provide a}} long-term quiescent environment for the conduct of scientific research for a variety of microgravity science disciplines. This paper reports to the microgravity scientific community the results of an initial characterization of the microgravity environment on the International Space Station for increments 2 through 4. During that period almost 70, 000 hours of station operations and scientific experiments were conducted. 720 hours of crew research time were logged aboard the orbiting laboratory and over half a terabyte of acceleration data were recorded and much of that was analyzed. The results discussed in this paper cover both the quasi-steady and vibratory acceleration environment of the station during its first year of scientific operation. For the quasi-steady environment, results are presented and discussed for the following: the space station attitudes Torque Equilibrium Attitude and the X-Axis Perpendicular to the Orbital Plane; station docking attitude maneuvers; Space Shuttle joint operation with the station; cabin de-pressurizations and the station water dumps. For the vibratory environment, results are presented for the following: crew exercise, docking events, and the activation/de-activation of both station life support system hardware and experiment hardware. Finally, a grand summary of all the data collected aboard the station during the 1 -year period is presented showing where the overall quasi-steady and <b>vibratory</b> acceleration magnitude <b>levels</b> fall over that period of time using a 95 th percentile benchmark.

5000|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{in the mid}} 1960s, Alexander Coucoulas, {{reported the}} first thermosonic wire bonds {{using a combination of}} heat, ultrasonic vibrations and pressure which led to his first invention. He first set up a commercial ultrasonic wire bonder (capable of transmitting vibratory energy and pressure) in order to investigate the attachment of aluminum wires to tantalum thin films deposited on glass substrates which simulated bonding a lead wire to the fragile metallized silicon integrated circuit [...] "chip". He observed that the ultrasonic energy and pressures levels needed to sufficiently deform the wire and form the required contact areas significantly increased the incidences of cracks in the glass or silicon chip substrates. A means of heating the bond region was then added to the ultrasonic bonder. The bond region was then heated during the ultrasonic bonding cycle which virtually eliminated the glass failure mode since the wire dramatically deformed to form the required contact area while using significantly lower ultrasonic energy and pressure levels. The enhanced wire deformation during the ultrasonic bonding cycle was attributed to the transition from cold working (or strain hardening of the wire) to near hot working conditions where its softness was enhanced. As the bonding temperature was increased the onset of recrystallization (softening mechanism) occurs where the strain hardening is most extensive. Thus the dual mechanisms of thermal softening and ultrasonic softening which is caused by vibratory energy interacting at the atomic lattice level, facilitated the desired wire deformation. Christian Hagar and George Harman stated that in 1970 Alexander Coucoulas reported additional work in forming thermosonic-type bonds which he initially called hot work ultrasonic bonding. In this case, copper wires were bonded to palladium thin films deposited on aluminum oxide substrates. As a result of these earliest reported thermosonic wire bonds, G.Harman stated [...] "as such, Alexander Coucoulas is the Father of Thermosonic Bonding".At present, the majority of connections to silicon integrated circuits (the chip) are made using thermosonic bonding because it employs lower bonding temperatures, forces and dwell times than thermocompression bonding, as well as lower <b>vibratory</b> energy <b>levels</b> than ultrasonic bonding, to form the required bond area. As a result of using lower bonding parameters to form the required contact area, Thermosonic Bonding largely eliminates damaging the relatively fragile silicon integrated circuit micro-chip during the bonding cycle. The proven reliability of thermosonic bonding has made it the process of choice, since such potential failure modes could be costly whether they occur during the manufacturing stage or detected later, during an operational field-failure of a micro-chip which had been permanently connected inside a computer or a myriad of other electronic devices.|$|R
