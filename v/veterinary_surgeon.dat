5|$|A 15-year-old elephant, Ellie May, had {{acquired}} an undeserved {{reputation for being}} dangerous, which made her extremely difficult to sell. Her food costs became difficult to justify, but Grayson refused to have her put down. Although he left the zoo in January 1978, Grayson returned frequently to care for Ellie May, the last animal left at the zoo. Eventually Rotterdam Zoo agreed to take her, and plans were made to transport the elephant to the Netherlands. Ellie May refused to budge however, and overnight developed pneumonia and heart failure. Grayson and <b>veterinary</b> <b>surgeon,</b> David Taylor, felt {{that she would not}} recover, and decided to call in a marksman to euthanise her.|$|E

40|$|Salmonella dublin is an {{important}} bovine pathogen, causing dysentery, abortion, and death from septicaemia. S dublin dermatitis, a little-recognised occupational hazard for <b>veterinary</b> <b>surgeons,</b> does not cause serious disability or inconvenience. During a survey of brucellosis in south-west Wales four cases of S dublin dermatitis were seen in <b>veterinary</b> <b>surgeons.</b> One surgeon was reinfected three years later. On all five occasions the <b>veterinary</b> <b>surgeons</b> had not worn or had discarded polyethylene gloves. An apparently healthy cow {{may serve as a}} latent carrier of S dublin. Thus when disease starts in a closed, protected herd reactivation of infection within the herd is usually blamed and its introduction by extraneous agents considered to be unlikely. <b>Veterinary</b> <b>surgeons</b> should be regarded as potential vectors of S dublin...|$|R
5|$|Born in Hamilton, Victoria, Lerew {{was the son}} of William Margrave Lerew, {{a chemist}} and <b>veterinary</b> <b>surgeon</b> who had emigrated from England with his two brothers. The family was of French Huguenot extraction, the {{original}} name being LeRoux. John Lerew was educated at Scotch College, Melbourne, where {{he was a member of}} the cadets. He studied part-time for a bachelor's degree in civil engineering at the University of Melbourne, concurrently serving approximately two years in the militia with various units including the 39thBattalion, 3rdDivision Artillery Survey Unit, and Melbourne University Regiment. He also developed a love of fast cars, joining a racing team and placing third in the 1930 Australian Grand Prix.|$|E
5|$|By mid-May it {{was clear}} that he would not make the Derby and he was removed from the race on the 23 May. Orme's trainer John Porter and Williams, the <b>veterinary</b> <b>surgeon,</b> {{remained}} convinced that he had been poisoned and was not just suffering from bad teeth. A reward of £1,000 was even offered for information that would lead to the conviction of the guilty party. The poisoning was investigated by George Lewis, a solicitor, who concluded that the horse had been poisoned. He stated that the horse was fine on the morning of the 21 April, but a few hours later his tongue was so inflamed he could not hold it in his mouth; something so sudden, Lewis argued, could not have been caused by a decaying tooth. He suggested that the poison may have in fact been attempted to be administered by some ball being put down his throat, but due to the struggles of the horse, it burst in his mouth, blistering his tongue. The Derby was won by Sir Hugo, but many believed that Orme would have won easily had he made the race.|$|E

40|$|The {{scale of}} the ethical {{challenges}} faced by <b>veterinary</b> <b>surgeons</b> and their perceived stressful consequences were investigated via a short questionnaire, completed by 58 practising <b>veterinary</b> <b>surgeons.</b> Respondents were asked to report how frequently they faced ethical dilemmas, and to rate on a simple numerical scale (zero to 10) how stressful they found three common scenarios. Fifty seven per cent of respondents reported that they faced one to two dilemmas per week, while 34 per cent stated they typically faced three to five dilemmas per week. The three scenarios provided were all rated as highly stressful with 'client wishing to continue treatment despite poor animal welfare' rated as the most stressful (median 9). The female <b>veterinary</b> <b>surgeons</b> gave two of the scenarios significantly higher stress ratings than the male <b>veterinary</b> <b>surgeons.</b> Stress ratings were not influenced by number of years in practice (which ranged from one to more than 25 years). The results show that <b>veterinary</b> <b>surgeons</b> regularly face ethical dilemmas and that they find these stressful. This has implications for the wellbeing of <b>veterinary</b> <b>surgeons</b> and supports the case for increased provision of training and support, especially for those who entered the profession before undergraduate ethics teaching was widely available...|$|R
