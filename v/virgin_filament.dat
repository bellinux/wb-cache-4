For this purpose, a comparative analysis is done on processability between 100 % staple CF and 60 weight% staple CF mixed with 40 weight% PVA fibers in carding, drawing and spinning process. The hybrid yarns are produced by varying twist level. The PVA fibers of the hybrid yarn are then dissolved using hot water treatment. The mechanical properties of yarns consisting of 100 % staple CF and hybrid yarns consisting of staple CF and PVA before and after hot water treatment are investigated. Furthermore, test specimen is also prepared by impregnating 100 % staple CF yarn and the hybrid yarns (after the dissolving of PVA) with epoxy resin. The results of the tensile test of the yarns in consolidated state reveals that the hybrid yarn produced with 80 T/m after hot water treatment exhibits approximately 75 % of the tensile strength of <b>virgin</b> <b>filament</b> tow, and {{it is expected that}} the hybrid yarns can be applied for the manufacturing of thermoset based composites for load bearing structures...|$|E
