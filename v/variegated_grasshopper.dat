5000|$|A {{number of}} species, {{especially}} in the Acridoidea, are significant agricultural pests, {{but not all of}} them are locusts: a non-taxonomic term referring to species whose populations which may change morphologically when crowded and show swarming behaviour. [...] Examples of agricultural grasshopper pests that are not called locusts include the Senegalese grasshopper and certain species in the Pyrgomorphidae, notably the <b>variegated</b> <b>grasshopper</b> (Zonocerus variegatus).|$|E
5000|$|The {{land holding}} for farming in Nigeria is between 0.5 - 2.5 ha, with about 90% of {{producers}} being small-scale farms. [...] In {{order to increase}} production, several varieties of cassava have been developed which are pest resistant; production {{in the country is}} hampered with problems with green mite, the cassava mealybug, and the <b>variegated</b> <b>grasshopper.</b> Diseases affecting cassava crop are mosaic disease, bacterial blight, anthracnose, and root rot.|$|E
50|$|The LUBILOSA team {{continued}} to look for opportunities to test Metarhizium against locusts and grasshoppers. Field trials were conducted against Senegalese grasshoppers, African rice <b>grasshoppers</b> (Hieroglyphus daganensis), <b>variegated</b> <b>grasshoppers,</b> Sahelian tree locusts (Anacridium melanorhodon), brown locusts and desert locusts. These trials demonstrated that Metarhizium at a dosage of 50 g/ha could reduce grasshopper populations and those of tree locusts by 80-90% within two to three weeks. Population level control was more difficult to achieve with other locusts, but a significant effect was demonstrated on hopper bands notwithstanding the great difficulties in tracking individual bands. Some trials against Senegalese grasshoppers included the chemical insecticide fenitrothion for comparison. Because of its rather short persistence, this chemical {{turned out to be}} much less effective than commonly believed. It was highly effective in producing an immediate sharp reduction in population densities, but continued hatching and remigration into the treated plots caused these densities to start increasing again after less than a week, until they reached or exceeded the original levels after about two to three weeks. Metarhizium, on the other hand, reduced population levels at a slower rate, but maintained low levels for at least one and a half months. The half-life of its spores on the vegetation was estimated at more than 7 days under rainy season conditions in the Sahel and, of course, some conidia must survive between seasons.|$|R

50|$|During phase 2, the oil {{formulation}} {{was tested}} {{in the field and}} shown to be effective. Field trials proved to be difficult to carry out on such highly mobile insects as grasshoppers and locusts. With locusts, fixed plots, unless several square kilometres in size, cannot be used, so it is necessary to follow hopper bands. Although there were many locust infestations during this phase, of both desert locusts (Schistocerca gregaria) and brown locusts (Locustana pardalina), the chemical treatment teams were also very active and little headway was therefore made in developing the techniques necessary to measure the effect of Metarhizium on unrestrained locusts. However, it was possible to scale up treatments against the <b>variegated</b> <b>grasshopper</b> (Zonocerus variegatus) in the forest zone and against Sahelian grasshoppers, especially the Senegalese grasshopper (Oedaleus senegalensis).|$|E
40|$|The <b>variegated</b> <b>grasshopper</b> Zonocerus variegatus is a {{polyphagous}} insect, feeding on numerous food and cash crops. The present study aimed {{to investigate the}} sexual variations in the destructive capability of the adult insects and the composition of leaves damaged by them, {{as well as in}} the levels of midgut microbial flora and digestive enzymes (cellulase, amylase and Î±-glucosidase). The results showed that females consumed and caused more damage to cassava leaves than their male congeners. The leaves damaged by males contained more nutrients than those damaged by females. The gut microbial flora and enzyme assay showed that females had significantly larger colony forming units and a non-significant difference in enzyme activities. It can thus be concluded that adult females are more destructive than males...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} four host plants, Manihot esculenta, Cassia alata, Glyphaea brevis and Azadirachta indica on the survival, {{development}} and fecundity of the <b>variegated</b> <b>grasshopper</b> (Zonocerus variegatus) was investigated. One thousand eight hundred second instar nymphs {{were collected from}} abandoned farmlands, caged and fed with the leaves of different host plants mentioned above. Cassava leaves (M. esculenta) gave the best survival and fecundity rates followed though distantly by C. alata while G. brevis and A. indica gave very poor survival rates. The survival rate was generally poor at the early nymphal stages of the insects on all the host plants. With respect to fecundity, the insects reared on M. esculenta produced {{the greatest number of}} egg-pods and consequently eggs; whereas those reared on A. indica failed to produce any egg-pod...|$|E
40|$|Field {{survey of}} {{population}} of Zonocerus variegatus revealed a high fungal incidence of 76 % when Sporulation tests {{were carried out}} on grasshoppers cadaver. Eight fungi with differing incidence rates were isolated. These are Fusarium sp. (8 %); Beauveria bassiana (18 %); Metarhizium sp. (20 %); Aspergillus flavus (10 %); Penicillium sp. (13 %) Aspergillus niger (14 %); Mucor sp. (13 %) and unidentified fungus (4 %). Fungal isolates virulence bioassay response showed that B. bassiana had the highest lethal time (LT 50) of 2 days. Metarhizium sp with LT 50 of 5 days was selected in lieu of A. niger which does not prove to be pathogenic to grasshoppers. The results were discussed {{in relation to the}} ecology of fungal pathogens of the <b>variegated</b> <b>grasshopper</b> and their possible role in control of Z. variegatus in the agroecosystem of south west, Nigeria...|$|E
40|$|Institute Okigwe, Imo State to {{evaluate}} the efficacies of four plant derived insecticides for control of major insect pests of garden egg. The bio-pesticides include Neem (Azadirachta indica), African black pepper (Piper guineense), (Jatropha curcas), Castor seed oil (Ricinus communis) and cyperforce insecticide 12. 5 % E. C and control which constituted the six treatments. The experimental design was randomized complete block design with four replications. Results showed observed commonest insects to include Green leaf hopper (Empoasca spp.), Fruit borers (Leucinodes orbanalis), <b>variegated</b> <b>grasshopper</b> (Zonocerus variegatus) and Cutworms (Spodoptera littoralis). All the bio-pesticidal treatments significantly (P < 0. 05) reduced insect infestation with low damage and higher fruit yield compared with the control. The African black pepper (Piper guineense) displayed highest degree of efficacy in this regard of all the plant extracts in both seasons (2011 and 2012). This was followed by neem (A. indica), castor seed oil and Jatropha curcas in that order. The bio-pesticides compared favourably with the synthetic insecticide which served as a check and recorded lowest insect infestation and highest fruit yield of 13, 666. 7 kg/ha and 16, 083. 3 kg/ha in 2011 and 2012 cropping seasons respectively. The potential of the plant-derived insecticides in controlling the insect pests of garden egg have been identified and hence {{could be a good}} alternative for synthetic insecticide and as well could be utilized for such purpose...|$|E
