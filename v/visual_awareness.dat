25|$|In the {{psychology}} of visual perception and motor control, the term response priming denotes a special form of visuomotor priming effect. The distinctive feature of response priming is that prime and target are presented in quick succession (typically, less than 100 milliseconds apart) and are coupled to identical or alternative motor responses. When a speeded motor response is performed to classify the target stimulus, a prime immediately preceding the target can thus induce response conflicts when assigned to a different response as the target. These response conflicts have observable effects on motor behavior, leading to priming effects, e.g., in response times and error rates. A special property of response priming is its independence from <b>visual</b> <b>awareness</b> of the prime: For example, response priming effects can increase under conditions where <b>visual</b> <b>awareness</b> of the prime is decreasing.|$|E
25|$|Various studies {{indicate}} that the perceived intention to move (have moved) can be manipulated. Studies {{have focused on the}} pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) of the brain, in which readiness potential indicating the beginning of a movement genesis has been recorded by EEG. In one study, directly stimulating the pre-SMA caused volunteers to report a feeling of intention, and sufficient stimulation of that same area caused physical movement. In a similar study, it was found that people with no <b>visual</b> <b>awareness</b> of their body can have their limbs be made to move without having any awareness of this movement, by stimulating premotor brain regions. When their parietal cortices were stimulated, they reported an urge (intention) to move a specific limb (that they wanted to do so). Furthermore, stronger stimulation of the parietal cortex resulted in the illusion of having moved without having done so.|$|E
25|$|Crick {{hoped he}} might aid {{progress}} in neuroscience by promoting constructive interactions between specialists {{from the many}} different subdisciplines concerned with consciousness. He even collaborated with neurophilosophers such as Patricia Churchland. In 1983, {{as a result of}} their studies of computer models of neural networks, Crick and Mitchison proposed that the function of REM sleep is to remove certain modes of interactions in networks of cells in the mammalian cerebral cortex; they called this hypothetical process 'reverse learning' or 'unlearning'. In the final phase of his career, Crick established a collaboration with Christof Koch that lead to publication of a series of articles on consciousness during the period spanning from 1990 to 2005. Crick made the strategic decision to focus his theoretical investigation of consciousness on how the brain generates <b>visual</b> <b>awareness</b> within a few hundred milliseconds of viewing a scene. Crick and Koch proposed that consciousness seems so mysterious because it involves very short-term memory processes that are as yet poorly understood. Crick also published a book describing how neurobiology had reached a mature enough stage so that consciousness could be the subject of a unified effort to study it at the molecular, cellular and behavioural levels. Crick's book The Astonishing Hypothesis made the argument that neuroscience now had the tools required to begin a scientific study of how brains produce conscious experiences. Crick was skeptical about the value of computational models of mental function that are not based on details about brain structure and function.|$|E

40|$|How {{should we}} think about the role of <b>visual</b> spatial <b>awareness</b> in {{perception}} and perceptual knowledge? A common view, which finds a characteristic expression in Kant but has an intellectual heritage reaching back farther than that, is that an account of spatial awareness is fundamental to a theory of experience because spatiality is the defining characteristic of "outer sense", of our perceptual awareness of how things are in the parts of the world that surround us. A natural counterpart to this idea is to treat self-consciousness as residing in a kind of sense that is fundamentally "inner", such as introspection or whatever else gives one privileged access to his own mental states as well as the proprioceptive and kinesthetic awareness of bodily position. This division is compatible, of course, with the idea that inner sense provides an awareness of a distinctive kind of "body space", but it treats that as importantly different from the awareness of the worldly space around one. In contrast to such a picture, this dissertation proposes an account of <b>visual</b> spatial <b>awareness</b> according to which it is no less a source of self-consciousness than of the awareness of the objects around us, and an account of self-awareness in which visual experience is essentially implicated. I begin by arguing that we should think of <b>visual</b> spatial <b>awareness</b> not as necessary for the individuation of visual sensations but rather as an essential element in the awareness of an experientially objective world. In the subsequent chapters, I argue that in being visually aware of the egocentric positions of the worldly objects around us we are often aware also of our own spatial locations with respect to them, and that the visual experience of the world around one and one`s own situation in it is often an essential component in the knowledge that a human agent will have of his own intentional actions...|$|R
40|$|People with Autism {{spectrum}} disorder (ASD) show {{difficulty in}} social communication, {{especially in the}} rapid assessment of emotion in faces. This study examined the processing of emotional faces in typically developing adults with high {{and low levels of}} autistic traits (measured using the Autism Spectrum Quotient—AQ). Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during viewing of backward-masked neutral, fearful and happy faces presented under two conditions: subliminal (16 ms, below the level of <b>visual</b> conscious <b>awareness)</b> and supraliminal (166 ms, above the time required for <b>visual</b> conscious <b>awareness).</b> Individuals with low and high AQ differed in the processing of subliminal faces, with the low AQ group showing an enhanced N 2 amplitude for subliminal happy faces. Some group differences were found in the condition effects, with the Low AQ showing shorter frontal P 3 b and N 4 latencies for subliminal vs. supraliminal condition. Although results did not show any group differences on the face-specific N 170 component, there were shorter N 170 latencies for supraliminal vs. subliminal conditions across groups. The results observed on the N 2, showing group differences in subliminal emotion processing, suggest that decreased sensitivity to the reward value of social stimuli is a common feature both of people with ASD as well as people with high autistic traits from the normal population...|$|R

5000|$|All three lenses {{have shown}} {{improvement}} of {{the perception of the}} visual field. Overall, experience has shown that younger patients tend to adapt to the expanders better than older patients (Windsor et al., n.d). Not all patients will benefit from Optical Visual Span expanders, as some patients are so well adapted to their visual field loss that the expanders are not necessary for them to be high functioning (Windsor et al., n.d).. The Gottlieb <b>Visual</b> Field <b>Awareness</b> System and the Chadwick hemianopsia Lens have significantly higher contrast and brightness than the EP lens (Windsor et al., n.d). The Gottlieb <b>Visual</b> Field <b>Awareness</b> System may not be ideal for patients with severe cognitive impairments, since the patient must alternate viewing between the prism {{and the rest of the}} lens. Also, due to the alternation between the prism and the rest of the lens, perception can be quite jumpy (Windsor et al., n.d). The innovation of EP Horizontal Lens has taken away this problem, and allows the patient to no longer have to scan to the edge of the visual field to jump between the two perceptions (Bowers et al., 2008). However, as stated above, the EP lens does sacrifice contrast so that the images from the expander and visual field can be integrated better together (Windsor et al., n.d). EP lenses also use a higher power, giving the patient about 30° of visual expansion, more than the other types of expanders (Figure 4.) ("Chadwick optical inc.," [...] 2011).|$|R
