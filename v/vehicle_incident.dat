40|$|Work related {{road safety}} {{research}} is scarce. Due to an increasing awareness of workplace {{health and safety}} issues {{and the impact of}} fleet safety on business effectiveness, the current demand for fleet safety information has grown. To assist organisations in managing their fleets in an informed manner, this study analysed the frequency and severity of various types of motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>incidents</b> in a large Australian fleet of greater than 10, 000 vehicles. Data pertaining to motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>incidents</b> that occurred between 1999 and 2003 was sourced from archival records of property damage, workers compensation and third party claims. The data includes 321 motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>incidents</b> that occurred during this period where a property damage claim was filed in relation to the researched fleet that could be matched with either a workers compensation claim or compulsory third party (CTP) claim. Therefore all estimates in this paper refer to average injury crashes. It was observed that incident frequency and severity varied substantially between different incident characteristics. This paper provides current data which could be utilised to guide judgements of the cost effectiveness of proposed interventions both within the fleet and broader road safety community. For example, most road safety programs are aimed at younger drivers. This study found that 60 percent of the drivers involved in an incident were between the ages of 31 and 50 years, and that drivers who were between the ages of 41 and 50 years had the highest average total incident cost. This would suggest that traditional programs may need to be modified to target this more mature audience...|$|R

In particular, special attention is given to identifying fleet safety factors for integration into a wider Workplace Health and Safety Management System (WHSMS). This exploratory case study was carried out across five regional areas, within the state of Queensland, and involved two major components: i) field based interviews; and ii) an analysis of organisational fleet safety operational procedures.

The analysis of fleet safety procedures focussed on work-related <b>vehicle</b> <b>incident</b> reporting, identification of hazard and risk exposures, effectiveness of training and induction programs, and analysis of current safety management systems including policy and procedures. Results of the study found that fleet safety within the organisation was not considered a priority and as a result, the full extent of organisational crashes and vehicle-related injuries was relatively unknown by senior management. In addition, this study identified a number of operational and procedural deficiencies in relation to fleet safety.

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{adaptation}} of an immune-inspired instance selection technique to solve a real-world big data problem of determining <b>vehicle</b> <b>incident</b> hot spots. The technique, which is inspired by the Immune System self-regulation mechanism, was originally conceptualised to eliminate very similar instances in data classification tasks. We adapt the method to detect hot spots from a telematics data set containing {{hundreds of thousands of}} data points indicating incident locations involving heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) across the United Kingdom. The objective is to provide HGV drivers with information regarding areas of high likelihood of incidents in order to continuously improve road safety and vehicle economy. The problem presents several challenges and constraints. An accurate view of the hot spots produced in a timely manner is necessary. In addition, the solution is required to be adaptable and dynamic, as thousands of new incidents are included in the database daily. Furthermore, the impact on hot spots after informing drivers about their existence has to be considered. Our solution successfully addresses these constraints. It is fast, robust, and applicable to all different incidents investigated. The method is also self-adjustable, which means that if the hot spots’ configuration changes with time, the algorithm automatically evolves to present the most current topology. Our solution has been implemented by a telematics company to improve HGV safety in the United Kingdom...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{evaluates the}} performance of automotive child restraint systems (CRS) that conform to international proposals for a universal restraint concept to be adopted by both restraint and vehicle manufacturers. The concept is known as Isofix (International Standards Organisation FIXing), and is intended to ensure optimum compatibility and coupling between vehicle and CRS. In order to quantify {{the benefits of the}} proposed Isofix concept it has been necessary to establish the performance limits and benefits offered by current commercially available adult belt retained CRS. A considerable body of knowledge existed on the performance and limitations of the then current CRS. However, during 1995 a significant amendment was introduced affecting ECE R 44, the compliance standards applicable to CRS in Europe to which most rnanufacturers require their products to conform (separate national standards also exist). In 1995 amendment 03 was added to ECE R 44 and became a catalyst for considerable development activity by manufacturers of child restraints, that resulted in new or revised product ranges. These new products, in particular forward facing Group 1 (9 - 15 kg) child restraints have significantly improved dynamic performance in frontal impacts, notably in modern vehicles whose seat belt anchorage positions have been optimised for restraint of adults, but are commonly less effective in restraining framed CRS. It was important therefore to re-assess existing systems as the baseline for a realistic evaluation of the proposed Isofix concepts (chapter 10). It was evident that, of the different Isofix concepts being proposed, no overall evaluation of their relative performance had, to that date, been undertaken. A programme involving the design and manufacture of not only suitable test equipment but, in a number of cases, prototype devices, was undertaken. The resulting data have formed the basis of input to the ISO Working Group 1, the body responsible for the evolution of the Isofix concept. This programme also highlighted a number of shortfalls in the proposed concepts. The major results of this test programme have been published at international level, and were used to inform the Isofix discussions. During the programme of comparative evaluation of not only the Isofix but the current belt retained devices, it became clear to the writer that in a frontal impact the orientation of the occupant with respect to the direction of travel had significance. A literature survey produced evidence of minimal research in this area. Hence it was decided by the writer to include a programme of parametric tests to investigate the significance of occupant orientation, given that commercially available CRS often include a feature to vary the recline angle of the seat. The Isofix set-up was particularly suitable for this exercise in that it eliminated many of the variables associated with belt retained devices. The results of this work have been published at intemationallevel. A review of the available accident data indicates that side impacts are potentially more life threatening than the more common frontal impacts due to the proximity of the occupant to an intruding vehicle or object. However, current European certification standards do not require the evaluation of CRS in a side impact. This is considered to be an area where improvements, particularly aided by an Isofix type attachment concept, can be made. Therefore the final area of research undertaken by the writer was to develop and propose a test to evaluate CRS in a realistic side impact scenario. This involved the simulation of not only the acceleration imparted to the target vehicle occupant but in addition the intrusion component. This work, which again has been presented at international level, contributed towards a proposal to amend the European certification standard for CRS to include a side impact evaluation. This thesis commences with a review of the accident data currently available, and looks at how the physiological and anatomical properties of the child, vehicle design, and the inherent potential for misuse and mis-installation of the current generation of CRS, impact upon child safety. This is followed by an overview of the lsofix proposal before the results of the writer's detailed testing of both current belt retained and proposed Isofix CRS concepts (chapters 10 and 11) are reported. The subsequent chapters (12 and 13) detail the results of the writer's investigation into CRS orientation in a frontal impact {{and the development of a}} representative side impact test, based on a single sled, for inclusion in the European certification procedure. The document concludes with discussion and conclusions relating to the future of CRS design and evaluation. The major findings of this research were: • contrary to initial expectations, significant CRS recline angle in a forward facing device has been proven to be undesirable; • Isofix CRS with rigid lower anchors have been shown to be beneficial, particularly in side impacts, their efficacy in a forward impact being compromised by rotation in devices that do not incorporate an anti-rotation device; • a side impact test has been developed which more accurately represents the input to a CRS seen in a rear <b>vehicle</b> <b>incident.</b> Such a test is not only desirable but essential to drive CRS manufacturers into improving side impact protection for occupants...|$|E
