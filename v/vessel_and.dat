5|$|In Jamaica, heavy {{rainfall}} triggered widespread street flooding, forcing nearly all businesses in Kingston to close {{for the duration}} of the storm.

5|$|After {{his release}} from prison, Orsborne took part in further {{maritime}} adventures and served in the navy in the Second World War. He died in 1957. In Georgetown Girl Pat was acquired by new owners who returned her to Britain, where she was displayed as a tourist attraction in several resorts. In 1939 she was sold to the Port of London Authority {{for use as a}} wreck-marking <b>vessel</b> <b>and,</b> after being requisitioned by the Royal Navy during the war, was returned to the authority in 1945. There is no public record of her subsequent career.|$|E
5|$|Although {{opinions}} differed, some reactor experts {{feared that}} over time the hydrogen bubble might become flammable or, less likely, explosive by combining with free oxygen in the vessel. If the bubble burned or exploded, it could rupture the pressure <b>vessel</b> <b>and</b> force the damaged reactor core into the containment building. The loss of the vessel would not make a breach of containment inevitable, but it would {{increase the risk of}} a disastrous release of radioactivity.|$|E
5|$|Fermentation is {{sometimes}} {{carried out in}} two stages, primary and secondary. Once most of the alcohol has been produced during primary fermentation, the beer is transferred to a new <b>vessel</b> <b>and</b> allowed a period of secondary fermentation. Secondary fermentation is used when the beer requires long storage before packaging or greater clarity. When the beer has fermented, it is packaged either into casks for cask ale or kegs, aluminium cans, or bottles for other sorts of beer.|$|E
50|$|Goats were {{originally}} introduced {{around the end}} of the 19th century by the early survey <b>vessel</b> mariners <b>and</b> the early guano <b>vessels</b> <b>and</b> whalers (<b>and</b> the guano <b>vessels</b> <b>and</b> whalers tended to be the same vessels) as they left goats in a number of locations, and coconut trees, for they believed that if people got shipwrecked, they had a goat to eat and they had a coconut to provide them with some sort of a liquid.|$|R

5|$|Hurricane-force winds blew down trees, signs, {{and power}} lines {{in and around}} La Paz, while closer to the beach the {{hurricane}} destroyed multiple beach huts. Rough surf in the harbor of La Paz sunk one fishing <b>vessel</b> <b>and</b> grounded four others. Efforts by the Mexican Navy prevented an additional <b>vessel</b> <b>and</b> two cruise ships from being grounded. In Cabo San Lucas, effects were minimal, amounting to light winds and rain of less than 2inches (50mm). The passage of the hurricane left citizens in Todos Santos without power for around 24hours. Heavy rainfall caused severe inland flooding, destroying bridges and multiple mudslides, some of which blocked roads. Flash flooding in desert inland areas washed out roads, causing the Mexican government to restrict traffic {{through much of the}} peninsula for up to a week after the storm. Many roads remained impassable for a month after the hurricane. The closed roads and the airport in La Paz and southern Baja California left some tourists stranded. The rainfall was welcome in some desert areas, where the moderate precipitation filled reservoirs. Two rescue workers died when they were swept away by the floodwaters. Six municipalities in Baja California were declared disaster areas, and by four days after landfall, the Mexican government prepared emergency funds to meet the immediate needs of the affected citizens.|$|E
5|$|In 2003 NOAA divers {{and volunteers}} {{returned}} to the Monitor {{with the goal of}} obtaining overall video of the site to create a permanent record of the current conditions on the wreck after the turret recovery. Jeff Johnston of the Monitor National Marine Sanctuary (MNMS) also wanted a definitive image of the vessel's pilothouse. During the dives, Monitors iron pilothouse was located near the bow of the <b>vessel</b> <b>and</b> documented for the first time by videographer Rick Allen, of Nautilus Productions, in its inverted position.|$|E
5|$|Later, on 24 August, UB-16 {{was again}} patrolling off the Mass Lightship when Hundius stopped Velox, another Norwegian steamer headed for London. Crewmen from UB-16 boarded the 312-ton cargo ship, planted explosives, and sank the <b>vessel</b> <b>and</b> her general cargo. Velox {{was the last}} ship sunk by the UB-16 for nearly eight months, and the last sunk by Hundius before he was {{replaced}} by Oblt. Ernst Müller-Schwarz late in the month. Neither Müller-Schwartz, nor his January 1917 replacement, Oblt. Hans Ewald Niemer, sank any ships while in command of UB-16.|$|E

5|$|Most of the three-mile (5km) {{stretch of}} river that had {{previously}} been closed was reopened without restriction, although a patrol remained in place to enforce a safety zone. The river restrictions delayed one outgoing <b>vessel</b> <b>and</b> two incoming ones.

5|$|Once microbubbles have formed, {{they can}} grow by either a {{reduction}} in pressure or by diffusion of gas into the gas from its surroundings. In the body, bubbles may be located within tissues or carried along with the bloodstream. The speed of blood flow within a blood <b>vessel</b> <b>and</b> the rate of delivery of blood to capillaries (perfusion) are the main factors that determine whether dissolved gas is taken up by tissue bubbles or circulation bubbles for bubble growth.|$|E
5|$|Once the fleets {{were close}} enough, exchanges of {{missiles}} began, ranging from combustible projectiles to arrows and javelins. The aim {{was not to}} sink ships, but to deplete {{the ranks of the}} enemy crews before the boarding actions, which decided the outcome. Once the enemy strength was judged to have been reduced sufficiently, the fleets closed in, the ships grappled each other, and the marines and upper bank oarsmen boarded the enemy <b>vessel</b> <b>and</b> engaged in hand-to-hand combat.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Segmentation of <b>vessels</b> <b>and</b> brain aneurysms on {{non-invasive}} and flow-sensitive {{phase contrast}} magnetic resonance angiographic (PCMRA) images {{is essential in}} the detection of vascular diseases, in particular, intracranial aneurysms. In this paper, we devise a novel method based on multi-range filters and local variances to perform segmentation of <b>vessels</b> <b>and</b> intracranial aneurysms on PCMRA images. The proposed method is validated and compared using a synthetic and numerical image volume and four clinical cases. It is experimentally shown that the proposed method is capable of segmenting <b>vessels</b> <b>and</b> aneurysms with various sizes on PCMRA images. ...|$|R
5|$|Set in the 22nd century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} the first Starfleet {{starship}} Enterprise, registration NX-01. Season three of Enterprise features an ongoing story following an attack on Earth by previously unknown aliens called the Xindi.

5|$|Soon {{after the}} attack on Pearl Harbor, {{it was decided that}} the USS Arizona would remain {{at the bottom of the}} harbor as the final resting place for those lost. In 1958, President Dwight D. Eisenhower {{approved}} the construction of a memorial over the <b>vessel</b> <b>and</b> the USS Arizona memorial was dedicated in 1962. It includes a complex at Halawa Landing (opposite Ford Island) and a structure over the Arizona which receives visitors by ferry. Although the ferries are operated by US Navy personnel, the complex is staffed by the National Park Service.|$|E
5|$|The Action of 13 January 1797 {{was a minor}} naval battle fought {{between a}} French ship {{of the line and}} two British frigates off the coast of Brittany during the French Revolutionary Wars. During the action the frigates outmanoeuvred the much larger French <b>vessel</b> <b>and</b> drove it onto shore in heavy seas, {{resulting}} in the deaths of between 400 and 1,000 of the 1,300persons aboard. One of the British frigates was also lost in the engagement with six sailors drowned after running onto a sandbank while failing to escape a lee shore.|$|E
50|$|The {{preventive}} measures taken by relevant authorities include assessment of facilities {{to ensure the}} required standards set out by legislation are met e.g. Double hulls in new <b>vessels</b> <b>and</b> secondary containment in oil holding facilities.
