The rectus fascia is closed with monofilament absorbable suture. The rectus muscle stumps do not require suturing. The skin and subcutaneous tissue are closed with subcuticular suture. The complications associated with Maylard incision are delayed bleeding from cut edges of rectus muscles and from deep epigastric vessels. In some patients, the incision may not offer sufficient exposure of upper abdomen. Marylard incision is likely to cause more pain than Pfannenstiel incision during the first post-operative week. However, Maylard incision has reduced rate of incisional hernia and more cosmetic appeal.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the voyage}} to the Azores and thence to the South American coast, Kronprinz Wilhelm had to avoid contact with all {{shipping}} {{since she was}} not ready to embark upon her mission raiding Allied commerce. The guns had to be emplaced and a target for gunnery practice constructed. The crew—mostly reservists and civilians—received a crash course in their duties in a warship and in general naval discipline. A [...] "prize crew" [...] was selected and trained in the techniques of boarding captured <b>vessels</b> (prizes), <b>inspecting</b> cargo and ship's papers, and using explosive charges to sink captured ships. Finally, all members of the crew were outfitted in some semblance of a naval uniform.|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{a comprehensive review}} of the maritime safety regimes and provides recommendations on how to improve the system. The results show a complex legal framework which generates a high amount of inspections and overlapping of inspection areas where no cross-recognition is established by the various stakeholders. While the safety system seems to be successful in eliminating substandard vessels and while average insurance claims costs are substantially lower for <b>inspected</b> <b>vessels</b> than not <b>inspected</b> <b>vessels,</b> the results indicate that the economic conditions of the shipping market also have an effect on safety quality besides the frequency of inspections. No significant differences can be found between industry inspections and port state control inspections with respect to decreasing the probability of casualty. The system could be made more effective by combining data sources on inspections and use them respectively to improve risk profiling and to decrease the frequency of inspections performed on ship types such as tankers. The results further indicate a lack of proper implementation of the International Safety Management Code (ISM code) and conventions with reference to working and living conditions of crew (ILO 147). A revision of the ISM code and more emphasis on enforcement of ILO 147 could further enhance the level of safety at sea. The {{authors would like to thank}} several inspection regimes for their cooperation in providing inspection data and in allowing the observation of surveys and inspections on 26 vessels. In addition, the authors would like to acknowledge the data providers for the casualty data, Clarkson’s for the economic data as well as two P&I Clubs in making data on insurance claims available...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} probabilities of vessel safety and {{pollution}} inspections {{by type of}} vessel by the U. S. Coast Guard based upon individual vessel inspections for the years 1992 - 2001. Probit estimates of vessel safety (versus pollution) inspection equations suggest that fishing, passenger, recreation and tug boats are less (more) likely to be inspected for safety (pollution), whereas tank barges and U. S. flag vessels are more (less) likely to be inspected for safety (pollution). Also, vessel safety and pollution inspection probabilities by vessel type vary by Coast Guard district and time. The probability of a U. S. flag <b>vessel</b> being <b>inspected</b> for safety has increased over the time period of the study. The results bring into question {{the effectiveness of the}} Coast Guard in reducing the oil-spill pollution of tank barges and improving the safety of fishing boats. 1 I...|$|R
40|$|Compressed air is {{the most}} common type of energy used in {{underground}} mines. Despite its low efficiency and high cost, it is used for various purposes, especially for drilling. This type of energy is still used relatively frequently, mainly due to its safety benefits and technical matters even though it is generated with a premium in relation to electrical power. However, compressed air that looks to be safe, could cause major accidents in mines and during the installation. The air receiver is similar to any pressure vessel and requires periodic technical inspection to ensure the accuracy of the vessel and its safety devices. In this paper authors try to elaborate on different circumstances, control and calculations surrounding pressure <b>vessels</b> whilst <b>inspecting,</b> based on division 1 section VIII ASMI standard. The results obtained could be used in all underground mines where compressed air is used as a form of energy...|$|R

50|$|When {{looking into}} whether to {{purchase}} a new autoclave or an existing machine, the prospective purchaser will find that used machines {{may or may not}} be less expensive than a new one built to his precise specifications and that they can be very hard to find in the required configuration. If a used machine matching the requirements is located at a reasonable price, be certain to check for such things as door hinge wear, undocumented modifications made by the user or others (much more common than you might suspect), and the availability of the pressure vessel registration documents. To be really safe, ask for the construction prints and then compare them to the machine itself. Uninspected additions made after the insurance inspection may be trifling (for example, door handles welded on after the <b>vessel</b> was <b>inspected),</b> but they can enable an insurance company to disallow a claim for damages if something disastrous happens.|$|R
