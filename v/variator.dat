50|$|Regarding the {{previous}} paragraph, {{the chain of}} an iCVT forms an open loop on its <b>variator</b> pulley that partially covers its <b>variator</b> pulley such that an open section, which is {{not covered by the}} chain, exist. This is similar to a sprocket of a bicycle where there is a section of the sprocket that is covered by its chain, and a section of the sprocket that is not covered by its chain. During one complete rotation, the toothed section of the <b>variator</b> pulley of an iCVT passes by the open section and re-engages with the chain. Here if the transmission diameter of the <b>variator</b> pulley does not represent an integer number of teeth, improper re-engagement between the teeth of the <b>variator</b> pulley and its chain will occur. Also, the transmission diameter of the <b>variator</b> pulley cannot be changed while the toothed section of the <b>variator</b> pulley is covering the entire open section of its chain loop. Since this is similar to where a plate is glued across the open section of a chain loop, which does not allow expansion or contraction of the chain loop as required for transmission diameter change of the <b>variator</b> pulley. Therefore, the transmission diameter of the <b>variator</b> pulley has to be changed one increment during an interval where the <b>variator</b> pulley rotates from an initial position where a portion of the toothed section of the <b>variator</b> pulley is positioned at the open section of the chain loop but not covering the entire open section, to the final position where the toothed section of the <b>variator</b> pulley passes by the open section of the chain loop and is about to re-engage with the chain. Since it takes less than one full rotation to rotate the <b>variator</b> pulley from its initial position to its final position mentioned in {{the previous}} sentence, the transmission diameter of the <b>variator</b> pulley has to be changed one increment within less than one full rotation.|$|E
50|$|As {{the benefit}} of the <b>variator</b> relies on {{changing}} the relative timing between inlet and exhaust, <b>variator</b> systems are only applied to double overhead camshaft engines.

50|$|On 8V engines {{the valve}} overlap and intake open {{duration}} are quite big. These engines hardly idle with the <b>variator</b> at On position so on these models {{it had the}} meaning also to enhance lower speed operation. On the 16V engines the camshaft <b>variator</b> is used to enhance the performance/emissions but also might be the source to the common 'diesel noise' problem often seen on high mileage used models which used the earlier internals of the <b>variator.</b> The same <b>variator</b> system is also used in many Fiat/Lancia engines like one used in Lancia Kappa 5-cylinder engine, some Fiat Bravo/Fiat Marea engines, Fiat Barchetta, Fiat Coupe, Fiat Stilo etc. models.|$|E

Bromodomain of BPTF binds to epigenetic marks in form of acetylated lysine of histone H 4 (H 4 K 12 Ac, H 4 K 16 Ac and H 4 K 20 Ac), which physicochemical properties and binding mode differs considerably from those of methylated H 3 K 4 marks.

50|$|Variable {{valve timing}} gave the Twin Spark engine very good {{performance}} for its cubic capacity, {{but it is}} one of the weaker areas of the 16-valve engine. The original <b>variator</b> that controls the cam timing is prone to wear or jam, although replacement part carries a different part number and has improved reliability. Symptoms are a slight loss of performance and a diesel type rattle from the top of the engine, which appears at startup and gradually lasts for longer. It is therefore advisable to get the <b>variator</b> changed regardless of its apparent condition at the 36,000 mile (60,000 km) cambelt replacement. The <b>variator</b> problem is not often seen in the earlier 8V Twin Spark version, as these use a different type of cam timing <b>variator</b> system, this is also the case for later 16v versions used in the Alfa Romeo 156 and the 147 where the weak <b>variator</b> was addressed.|$|E
50|$|Although the <b>variator</b> rarely fails outright, it {{developed}} a poor reputation for unreliability and requiring a relatively expensive repair.

50|$|The {{transmission}} ratio of an iCVT {{has to be}} changed one increment within less than one full rotation of its <b>variator</b> pulley. This means that the transmission diameter of the <b>variator</b> pulley, made generally from rubber, has to be changed from a diameter that has a circumferential length that is equal to an integer number of teeth to another diameter that has a circumferential length that is equal to an integer number of teeth; such as changing the transmission diameter of the <b>variator</b> pulley from a diameter that has a circumferential length of 7 teeth to a diameter that has a circumferential length of 8 teeth for example. This is because if the transmission diameter of the <b>variator</b> pulley {{does not have a}} circumferential length that is equal to an integer number of teeth, such as a circumferential length of 7½ teeth for example, improper engagement between the teeth of the <b>variator</b> pulley and its chain will occur. For example, imagine having a bicycle pulley with 7½ teeth; here improper engagement between the bicycle pulley and its chain will occur when the tooth behind the ½ tooth space is about to engage with its chain, since it is positioned a distance of ½ tooth too late relative to its chain.|$|E

40|$|In lymphoma, {{mutations}} in genes of histone modifying proteins are frequently observed. Notably, somatic {{mutations in}} the activatory histone modification writing protein MLL 2 and the repressive modification writer EZH 2 {{are the most}} frequent. Gain of function mutations are typically detected in EZH 2 whilst MLL 2 mutations are usually observed as conferring a homozygous loss of function. The gain-of-function mutations in EZH 2 provide an obvious target {{for the development of}} inhibitors with therapeutic potential. To counter the loss of functional MLL 2 protein, we computationally predicted compounds that are able to modulate the reader of the corresponding modifications, BPTF, to recognize other forms of the histone H 3 lysine 4, instead of the tri-methylated form normally produced by MLL 2. By forming a synthetic triple-complex of a compound, the histone H 3 tail and BPTF we potentially circumvent the requirement for functional MLL 2 methyl-transferase through the modulation of BPTF activity. Here we show a proof-of-principle that special compounds, named <b>variators,</b> can reprogram selectivity of protein binding and thus create artificial regulatory pathways which can have a potential therapeutic role. A therapeutic role of BPTF <b>variators</b> may extend to other diseases that involve loss of MLL 2 function, such as Kabuki syndrome or the aberrant functioning of H 3 K 4 modification as observed in Huntington disease and in memory formation.

50|$|One of {{the first}} {{practical}} VVT systems used a <b>variator</b> to change the phase of the camshaft and valves.

50|$|In addition, as the {{transmission}} diameter is increased, the chain {{has to be}} pushed up the inclined surfaces of the pulley halves of the <b>variator</b> pulley, while {{the tension in the}} chain tends to pull the chain towards the opposite direction. Hence a large force, which is larger than the tension in the chain, is required to change {{the transmission}} diameter. Since the transmission ratio has to be changed within less than one full rotation of the <b>variator</b> pulley, a large force has to be applied on the pulley halves within a very short duration. If for example the <b>variator</b> pulley rotates at 3600 rpm, which is equivalent to 60 revolutions per second, then the force required to change the transmission ratio has to be applied within 1/60 seconds. This would be similar to hitting something with a hammer. Therefore, here significant shock loads are applied to the <b>variator</b> pulley during transmission ratio change that increases the transmission diameter. These shock loads may cause comfort problems for the driver of the vehicle using an iCVT. Also an iCVT has to be designed as to be able to resist these shock loads which would most likely increases the cost and weight of an iCVT.|$|E

The theoretical model for the belt-pulley coupling is just complex for this arrangement, where one half-pulley may run in advance {{and the other is}} slower than the belt, and requires the repeated numerical solution of a strongly non-linear differential system by a sort of shooting technique, until all boundary conditions are fulfilled (angular contact extent, torque, axial force). After solving the full equations, the present study develops closed-form approximations characterized by an excellent fit with the numerical plots and proposes a simple and practical formulary for the axial thrust in dependence on the torque and the tension level. Then, results of a theoretical-experimental comparison are also reported, revealing a very good agreement of the model with the real operation...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{storage devices}} are an {{essential}} part of hybrid and electric vehicles. The most commonly used ones are batteries, ultra capacitors and high speed flywheels. Among these, the flywheel is the only device that keeps the energy stored in its original form i. e. mechanical energy. In order to connect the flywheel with the vehicle drive line, a suitable means is needed which would allow the flywheel to vary its speed continuously, in other words a continuously variable transmission (CVT) is needed. To improve the efficiency and range of the <b>variators,</b> a power spilt CVT (PSCVT) is one of the suitable options. This paper discusses the kinematics of PSCVT used to connect the flywheel to the driveline. The characteristic equations of the PSCVT have been derived for various types of PSCVT including the power recirculating and the multi regime type in both directions of power flow. An example of a PSCVT for a flywheel energy storage system (FESS) is computed using the derived equations. Finally the results, including powers and efficiencies for different types are compared...|$|R

Moreover, 1 -D nanostructure research has elucidated many biomarkers [10] which have the potential to greatly improve disease diagnosis. Among these materials, zinc oxide (ZnO), which is an n-type II-VI semiconductor with wide band gap energy (Eg[*]=[*] 3.37  eV at 300  K) and large exciton binding energy of (60  meV), has been proven as a promising candidate for multifunctional materials [11 – 15], <b>variators</b> [16], bulk acoustic wave devices [17], magneto-optic devices, UV light-emitting devices [18], gas sensors [10, 19], solar cells [11, 20], and field emission display devices [15, 21].

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{theoretical}} {{description of the}} mechanical behavior of rubber belt <b>variators</b> during the speed ratio shift. Comparing with the steady operation, the mass conservation of the belt is completely reformulated considering an elementary dihedral control volume between two planes through the pulley axis and balancing the inside mass variation with the total mass flux through the control surface. On the other hand, the belt equilibrium conditions {{are similar to the}} steady case, as the inertia forces due to the shifting motion are negligible with respect to the other forces. Assuming a onedimensional belt model, it is shown that adhesive regions may appear inside the arc of contact, where the belt sticks to the pulley flanges along spiral-shaped paths. It is demonstrated that this type of contact may occur only for the closing pulleys, differently from the steady drives and from the opening pulleys, where only quasiadhesive internal subregions may be observed at most, where the sliding velocity turns out to be quite small along a more or less extended portion of the arc of contact. Numerical solutions are calculated for all types of conditions, and their characteristics are widely described...|$|R
40|$|The steady {{theory of}} V-belt {{mechanics}} {{is well established}} [1, 2, 3]. Owing to the side compression of the pulley walls, the belt penetrates into the groove a depth variable along the arc of contact and is subject to radial components of the friction forces. Nevertheless, the operative conditions of mechanical <b>variators</b> are seldom steady (see cars and motorcycles), because alternating phases of shift up and down of the speed ratio are continuously requested by the driver. Very few theoretical approaches to this topic are reported in the literature. They generally assume an ideal inextensible-incompressible belt and find out the path of each belt element by simple geometrical analyses. The "rigid belt " hypothesis is certainly acceptable for metal V-belts (e. g. Van Doorne) and rapid ratio changes, but become inappropriate for rubber V-belt or slow shifts. In the rubber belt case, the longitudinal elongation and the radial penetration influence the sliding direction of the single belt elements {{in conjunction with the}} overall inside/outside motion due to the opening/closing of the pulley. In the metal belt case, the plate bending is generally more significant than the belt deformation and may affect the mechanical behaviour of the drive during the ratio change for moderate shift rate [4]...|$|R
