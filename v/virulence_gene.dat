40|$|Shigella flexneri is {{a species}} of Gram-negative {{intracellular}} pathogens that causes bacillary dysentery in humans. Shigella relies on the precise transcriptional regulation of <b>virulence</b> <b>genes,</b> encoded by a large virulence plasmid, for invasion and infection of human colonic epithelial cells. The transcription of most identified <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> are regulated through a cascade controlled by the primary regulator of <b>virulence</b> <b>genes,</b> VirF, and the global transcriptional regulator, VirB. Currently, few studies have addressed how individual Shigella <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> are precisely regulated for optimal expression during specific stages of pathogenesis and within {{the constraints of the}} regulatory cascade. This work addresses how individual <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> are regulated through the study of transcriptional regulation in four Shigella <b>virulence</b> <b>genes,</b> icsP, ipaJ, phoN 1, and ipaH 7. 8. Analysis of the icsP gene has identified multiple promoters contributing to icsP transcription and to the regulation of IcsP protein production through the use of two different translation start sites. In addition, analyses of the ipaJ, phoN 1, and ipaH 7. 8 genes has identified that the phoN 1 gene is transcriptionally regulated by the CRP, suggesting that catabolite repression is involved with the regulation of some <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> in Shigella. Together, these data suggest that the transcriptional regulation of <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> in Shigella flexneri is more complex than previously observed...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{prevalence}} of <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> in non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) and {{its association with}} commonly used antibiotics in West Africa is unknown. METHODOLOGY: We tested 185 NTS isolates from children, animals, and food products {{for the presence of}} twelve <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> by PCR. Ten of the <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> tested belonged to the five Salmonella pathogenicity islands implicated in its pathogenesis. RESULTS: Ten of twelve <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> except sopE and pefA were present in at least 70 % of the isolates tested; sopE and pefA were observed in 33 % and 44 % of the isolates, respectively. The most prevalent gene was invA (99. 5 %), which is an invasion gene conserved within the Salmonella enterica. pipD and sopB genes, which were associated with serovar Enteritidis, were detected in 92. 4 % and 94. 1 % of isolates respectively. S. Istanbul and S. Javiana, which were isolated from chicken-serving restaurants, carried all the <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> of the five pathogenicity islands. There was significant association between sopB, sitC, orfLC, pipD and pefA <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> and resistance to commonly used antibiotics in Senegal and The Gambia, namely amoxicillin, ticarcillin, trimethoprim plus sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, trimethoprim, spectinomycin, streptomycin, sulfonamides and nitrofurantoin. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> are present in NTS strains isolated from various sources. The significant association between some <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> and antibiotic resistance may have important implications with regard to the spread and persistence of resistance and <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> in Salmonella and to the prudent use of antimicrobial agents in humans and animals in West Africa...|$|R

50|$|Resources are {{generally}} limited. Therefore, investment in one trait (e.g. virulence or immunity) limits investment in other life-history traits (e.g. reproductive rate).

There is thus a trade-off between benefits and costs of the adaptive changes that then may prevent the host population to become fully resistant or the parasite population to express very high pathogenicity.|$|E
40|$|Aims: The {{study was}} aimed at {{investigating}} the presence of typical and atypical <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> in isolates belonging to the Harveyi clade (Vibrio harveyi and Vibrio campbellii). Methods and Results: Forty-eight vibrio isolates belonging to the Harveyi clade were screened {{for the presence of}} <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> that are typical for these bacteria and those found in human pathogenic vibrios such as Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio vulnificus and aquatic pathogenic Vibrio anguillarum. The <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> were amplified by PCR with specific primers, and the presence further confirmed by dot blot hybridization. The <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> vhh, chiA, vhpA, toxR(Vh), luxR and serine protease, typical of Harveyi clade were detected in all the isolates. The haemolysin gene hlyA and the <b>virulence</b> regulator <b>gene</b> toxR(Vc) specific to V. cholerae and the V. anguillarum-specific flagellum gene (flaC) were present in some of the isolates. Challenge tests with gnotobiotic Artemia nauplii did not show any correlation between the presence of the <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> and <b>virulence</b> of the isolates. Conclusion: From our results, there appears a remote possibility that vibrios belonging to the Harveyi clade might acquire <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> from other vibrios in the aquatic environment through horizontal gene transfer. Significance and Impact of the Study: Vibrios belonging to the Harveyi clade may be an important reservoir of <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> of other (human pathogenic) Vibrio species in the aquatic environment. The acquisition of <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> by horizontal transfer might increase the ability of Harveyi clade vibrios to infect aquatic organisms by increasing their virulence to a specific host by broadening their host range. The detection of such genes may forewarn the hatchery operators about a potentially virulent pathogen and thus help to develop management measures to handle the problem of vibriosis...|$|R
40|$|Fitness costs {{associated}} with resistance or <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> are thought to {{play a key role}} in determining the dynamics of genefor-gene (GFG) host-parasite coevolution. However, the nature of interactions between fitness effects of multiple resistance or <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> (epistasis) has received less attention. To examine effects of the functional form of epistasis on the dynamics of GFG host-parasite coevolution we modified a classic multilocus GFG model framework. We show that the type of epistasis between <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> largely determines coevolutionary dynamics, and that coevolutionary fluctuations are more likely with acceleratingly costly (negative) than with linear or deceleratingly costly (positive) epistasis.

40|$|Aims: To {{investigate}} {{the distribution of}} the virulence of two Vibrio species among different strains obtained from the mariculture systems on the coast of Guangdong in China and the correlation between the virulence strains and the <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> among Vibrio alginolyticus. Methods: Besides three strains, 72 V. alginolyticus strains and seven Vibrio parahaemolyticus strains were examined by PCR or semi-nested PCR for the <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> (tlh, trh, tdh, toxR, toxRS, ctxA, VPI). Additionally, the virulence of 18 V. alginolyticus strains was tested. Significance and Impact of the Study: <b>Virulence</b> <b>genes</b> homologous to those in the V. parahaemolyticus and Vibrio cholerae are widely distributed among V. alginolyticus and V. parahaemolyticus in the coastal mariculture systems in Guangdong, China. Some of the V. alginolyticus strains are pathogenic to aquatic animals, and might have derived their <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> from V. parahaemolyticus or V. cholerae, representing a possible reservoir of these genes. However, there is no correlation between presence and absence of the <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> used to investigate V. alginolyticus and its virulent strains.

50|$|In host-{{parasite}} interactions, {{the parasite}} organisms benefits {{at the expense}} of the host organisms. Parasites in Avida are implemented just like other self-replicating digital organisms, but they live inside hosts and execute parasitic threads using CPU cycles stolen from their hosts. Because parasites impose a cost (lost CPU cycles) on hosts, there is selection for resistance, and when resistance starts to spread in a population, there is selective pressure for parasites to infect those new resistant hosts. Infection occurs when both the parasite and host perform at least one overlapping task. Thus a host is resistant to a particular parasite if they do not share any tasks. This mechanism of infection mimics the inverse-gene-for-gene model, in which infection only occurs if a host susceptibility gene (the presence of a logic task) is matched by a parasite <b>virulence</b> <b>gene</b> (a parasite performing the same task). Additional infection mechanisms, such as the matching allele and gene-for-gene models, can also be implemented.|$|E
40|$|The MglA {{protein is}} the only known {{regulator}} of <b>virulence</b> <b>gene</b> expression in Francisella tularensis, yet {{it is unclear how}} it functions. F. tularensis also contains an MglA-like protein called SspA. Here, we show that MglA and SspA cooperate with one another to control <b>virulence</b> <b>gene</b> expression in F. tularensis. Using a directed proteomic approach, we show that both MglA and SspA associate with RNA polymerase (RNAP) in F. tularensis, and that SspA is required for MglA to associate with RNAP. Furthermore, bacterial two-hybrid and biochemical assays indicate that MglA and SspA interact with one another directly. Finally, through genome-wide expression analyses, we demonstrate that MglA and SspA regulate the same set of genes. Our results suggest that a complex involving both MglA and SspA associates with RNAP to positively control <b>virulence</b> <b>gene</b> expression in F. tularensis. The F. tularensis genome is unusual in that it contains two genes encoding different a subunits of RNAP, and we show here that these two a subunits are incorporated into RNAP. Thus, as well as identifying SspA as a second critical regulator of <b>virulence</b> <b>gene</b> expression in F. tularensis, our findings provide a framework for understanding the mechanistic basis for <b>virulence</b> <b>gene</b> control in a bacterium whose transcription apparatus is unique...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{identified}} a phenomenon in which ciliated protozoa engulf Salmonella and the intra-protozoal environment hyperactivates <b>virulence</b> <b>gene</b> expression and provides a venue for conjugal transfer of antibiotic resistance plasmids.

Our previous studies have assessed <b>virulence</b> <b>gene</b> hyperexpression only with protozoa from the bovine rumen while conjugal transfer has been demonstrated in rumen protozoa from cattle and goats. The present study examined <b>virulence</b> <b>gene</b> hyperexpression for Salmonella exposed to rumen protozoa obtained from cattle, sheep, goats, or two African ruminants (giraffe and bongo). Conjugal transfer was also assessed in these protozoa using Salmonella as the recipient. <b>Virulence</b> <b>gene</b> hyperexpression was only observed following exposure to the rumen protozoa from cattle and sheep while elevated virulence was also observed in these animals. Conjugal transfer events were, however, observed in all protozoa evaluated.

As many pathogens can survive and proliferate in the environment, {{it is important to understand}} their population dynamics and pathogenic potential in the environment. To assess pathogenic potential in diverse habitats, we developed a functional gene array, the PathoChip, constructed with key <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> related to major virulence factors, such as adherence, colonization, motility, invasion, toxin, immune evasion and iron uptake. A total of 3715 best probes were selected from 13 virulence factors, covering 7417 coding sequences from 1397 microbial species (2336 strains). The specificity of the PathoChip was computationally verified, and approximately 98 % of the probes provided specificity at or below the species level, proving its excellent capability for the detection of target sequences with high discrimination power. We applied this array to community samples from soil, seawater and human saliva to assess the occurrence of <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> in natural environments. Both the abundance and diversity of <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> increased in stressed conditions compared with their corresponding controls, indicating a possible increase in abundance of pathogenic bacteria under environmental perturbations such as warming or oil spills. Statistical analyses showed that microbial communities harboring <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> were responsive to environmental perturbations, which drove changes in abundance and distribution of <b>virulence</b> <b>genes.</b> The PathoChip provides a useful tool to identify <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> in microbial populations, examine the dynamics of <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> in response to environmental perturbations and determine the pathogenic potential of microbial communities...|$|R

Here, microarray and in situ single cell expression methods {{were used to}} study Vibrio cholerae growth and <b>virulence</b> <b>gene</b> expression during infection of the rabbit ligated ileal loop model of cholera. Genes encoding the toxin-coregulated pilus (TCP) and cholera toxin (CT) were powerfully expressed early in the infectious process in bacteria adjacent to epithelial surfaces. Increased growth was found to co-localize with <b>virulence</b> <b>gene</b> expression. Significant heterogeneity in the expression of tcpA, the repeating subunit of TCP, was observed late in the infectious process. The expression of tcpA, studied in single cells in a homogeneous medium, demonstrated unimodal induction of tcpA after addition of bicarbonate, a chemical inducer of <b>virulence</b> <b>gene</b> expression. Striking bifurcation of the population occurred during entry into stationary phase: one subpopulation continued to express tcpA, whereas the expression declined in the other subpopulation. ctxA, encoding the A subunit of CT, and toxT, encoding the proximal master regulator of <b>virulence</b> <b>gene</b> expression also exhibited the bifurcation phenotype.

This study aims to better understand the mechanisms of the effect of NQR on V. cholerae virulence, metabolism, and physiology. Analysis of the V. cholerae Δnqr mutant revealed that <b>virulence</b> <b>gene</b> expression is highly growth-phase dependent and <b>virulence</b> <b>gene</b> transcription is altered only at the early-log growth phase compared to the wild type. The Δnqr mutant also showed a broad range of metabolic defects, as assessed by a Phenotype Microarray™ (Biolog), suggesting the importance of NQR in the energy metabolism of V. cholerae. Furthermore, we also concluded that the effects of NQR on V. cholerae <b>virulence</b> <b>gene</b> expression were linked to respiration rather than sodium motive force.

We utilized a Francisella novicida transposon mutant library to identify additional regulatory factors and identified five additional genes that are essential for <b>virulence</b> <b>gene</b> expression. One regulatory gene, FTN_ 0480 (fevR, Francisella effector of virulence regulation), present in all Francisella species, is required for expression of the FPI genes and other genes in the MglA/SspA regulon. The expression of fevR is positively regulated by MglA. However, constitutive expression of fevR in an mglA mutant strain did not restore expression of the MglA/SspA regulon, demonstrating that mglA and fevR act in parallel to positively regulate <b>virulence</b> <b>gene</b> expression. Virulence studies revealed that fevR is essential for bacterial replication in macrophages and in mice, where we additionally show that fevR is required for the expression of genes in the MglA/SspA regulon in vivo.

The specificity of the PCR results was validated by hybridization. Genotyping data correlated well with biotype data, and most biotypes resulted in (nearly) homogeneous genotypes for the chromosomal <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> (ystA, ystB, and ail); however, plasmid-borne genes (yadA and virF) were detected with variable efficiency, due to heterogeneity within the bacterial population for the presence of the virulence plasmid.

MethodsA total of 184 S. aureus were isolated from sterile body fluids. All isolates were subjected to population analysis profiling for the identification of hVISA phenotype and polymerase chain reaction analysis for genotyping and 31 <b>virulence</b> <b>genes.</b> ResultsThe prevalence of MRSA isolates was 41. 8 % in central-southern China. Of 77 MRSA isolates, 17 (22. 1 %) were identified as hVISA. The most common MRSA and MSSA clones were ST 239 -MRSA-SCCmecIII-t 030 -agr-I (55. 8 %) and ST 188 -MSSA-t 189 -agr-I (20. 6 %), respectively. The frequency of carriage of pvl, hemolysins, tst, and staphylococcal enterotoxin genes among MSSA isolates was significantly higher than that for MRSA isolates (p <  0. 05); 98 MSSA isolates (53. 3 %) carried ≥ 10 tested <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> simultaneously, which was significantly higher than that of MRSA isolates (33. 8 %; p =  0. 004).

Results A total of 21 plasmid rep gene families, of which 13 were novel to this study, were characterised using a previously proposed classification system. 243 sequenced plasmids were assigned to 39 plasmid groups that each possessed a unique combination of rep genes. We show some resistance genes (including ermC and cat) and <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> (including entA, entG, entJ, entP) were associated with specific plasmid groups suggesting there are genetic pressures preventing recombination of these genes into novel plasmid groups. Whole genome microarray analysis revealed that plasmid rep, resistance and <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> were associated with S. aureus lineages, suggesting restriction-modification (RM) barriers to HGT of plasmids between strains exist.

In the presence of cellobiose and arbutin, transcription of hemolysin was reduced. However, none of the sugars affected transcription of prfA.

40|$|Seven {{different}} actA subtypes forming two phylogenetic lineages {{could be}} distinguished by sequencing the actA gene of Listeria seeligeri isolates from different habitats. Isolates {{of the two}} lineages differ in hemolytic as well as phospholipase activities and in {{the arrangement of the}} <b>virulence</b> <b>gene</b> cluster. The presence of a serine protease gene resembling orf 2110 of L. monocytogenes in some isolates further supports the hypothesis that L. seeligeri is subject to ongoing adaptation to changing environments. The genus Listeria comprises the species L. monocytogenes, L. ivanovii, L. seeligeri, L. innocua, L. welshimeri, L. grayi, and L. marthii (4, 7, 17). Of these only, L. monocytogenes (15) and L. ivanovii (1, 18) are considered as pathogens. The pathogenicity is closely associated with a <b>virulence</b> <b>gene</b> cluster, although other genes like those coding for internalines are implicated in pathogenesis too (16). Like L. monocytogenes and L. ivanovii, L. seeligeri also carries a <b>virulence</b> <b>gene</b> cluster. Although genes of the virulence cluster are presumably not expressed in a correct or functional fashion (3, 20), L. seeliger...|$|E
40|$|<b>Virulence</b> <b>gene</b> {{expression}} in pathogenic bacteria is modulated by environmental parameters. A {{key factor in}} this expression is temperature. Its effect on <b>virulence</b> <b>gene</b> {{expression in}} bacteria infecting warm-blooded hosts is well documented. Transcription of virulence genes in these bacteria is induced upon a shift from low environmental to a higher host temperature (37 ºC). Interestingly, host temperatures usually correspond to the optimum for growth of these pathogenic bacteria. On the contrary, in ectothermic hosts such as fish, molluscs and amphibians, infection processes generally occur at a temperature lower than that for the optimal growth of the bacteria. Therefore, regulation of <b>virulence</b> <b>gene</b> expression in response to temperature shift has to be modulated {{in a different way}} to that which is found in bacteria infecting warm-blooded hosts. The current understanding of <b>virulence</b> <b>gene</b> expression and its regulation in response to temperature in fish-pathogenic bacteria is limited, but constant extension of our knowledge base is essential to enable a rational approach to the problem of the bacterial fish diseases affecting the aquaculture industry. This is an interesting issue and progress needs to be made in order to diminish the economic losses caused by these diseases. The intention of this review is, for the first time, to compile the scattered results existing in the field in order {{to lay the groundwork for}} future research. This article is an overview of those relevant virulence genes that are expressed at temperatures lower than that for optimal bacterial growth in different fish-pathogenic bacteria as well as the principal mechanisms that could be involved in their regulation...|$|E
40|$|Many <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> {{have been}} {{detected}} in attenuated mutants of Brucella melitensis 16 M; nevertheless, a complete report of these genes, including the main Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG) represented {{as well as the}} taxonomical distribution among all complete bacterial and archaeal genomes, has not been analyzed. In this work a total of 160 <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> that have been reported in attenuated mutants in B. melitensis were included and analyzed. Additionally, we obtained 250 B. melitensis randomly selected genes as a reference group for the taxonomical comparisons. The COGs and the taxonomical distribution profile for 789 nonredundant bacterial and archaeal genomes were obtained and compared with the whole-genome COG distribution and with the 250 randomly selected genes, respectively. The main COGs associated with <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> corresponded to the following: intracellular trafficking, secretion and vesicular transport (U); cell motility (N); nucleotide transport and metabolism (F); transcription (K); and cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis (M). In addition, we found that <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> presented a higher proportion of orthologs in the Euryarchaeota and Proteobacteria phyla, with a significant decrease in Chlamydiae, Bacteroidetes, Tenericutes, Firmicutes and Thermotogae. In conclusion, we found that genes related to specific functions are more relevant to B. melitensis virulence, with the COG U the most significant. Additionally, the taxonomical distribution of <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> highlights the importance of these gene...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Lateral gene {{transfer}} {{is the major}} mechanism for acquisition of new <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> in pathogens. Recent whole genome analyses have suggested massive {{gene transfer}} between widely divergent organisms. Presentation of the hypothesis Archeal-like <b>genes</b> acting as <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> are present in several pathogens and genomes contain a number of archaeal-like genes of unknown function. Archaea, {{by virtue of their}} very different evolutionary history and different environment, provide a pool of potential <b>virulence</b> <b>genes</b> to bacterial pathogens. Testing the hypothesis We can test this hypothesis by 1) identifying genes likely to have been transferred (directly or indirectly) to E. coli O 157 :H 7 from archaea; 2) investigating the distribution of similar genes in pathogens and non-pathogens and 3) performing rigorous phylogenetic analyses on putative transfers. Implications of the hypothesis Although this hypothesis focuses on archaea and E. coli, it will serve as a model having broad applicability to a number of pathogenic systems. Since no archaea are known vertebrate pathogens, archaeal-like transferred genes that are associated with virulence in bacteria represent a clear model for the emergence of <b>virulence</b> <b>genes.</b> </p...|$|R
25|$|The pathogenetic {{pathways}} of Streptococcus dysgalactiae {{have not}} been explored in detail. Several virulence factors have been identified, but predominantly by screening S.dysgalactiae isolates for homologues of well-characterized S.pyogenes <b>virulence</b> <b>genes.</b> In a study of 216 S.pyogenes <b>virulence</b> <b>genes,</b> S.dysgalactiae was found to harbour approximately half of them. Indeed, whole-genome comparisons reveal a 70% -genetic similarity between the two species, indicating a common genetic ancestry. However, evidence of horizontal genetic transfer has also been reported.|$|R
