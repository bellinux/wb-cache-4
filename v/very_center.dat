5|$|During the 21st century, {{there will}} be 224 solar eclipses of which 77 will be partial, 72 will be annular, 68 will be total and 7 will be hybrids between total and annular eclipses. Of these, two annular and one total eclipse will be non-central, {{in the sense that}} the <b>very</b> <b>center</b> (axis) of the moon's shadow will miss the earth (for more {{information}} see gamma). In the 21st century the greatest number of eclipses in one year is four, in 2011, 2029, 2047, 2065, 2076, and 2094. The predictions given here are by Fred Espenak of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.|$|E
5|$|The Milky Way is a barred {{spiral galaxy}} with a {{diameter}} between 100,000 and 180,000 light-years. The Milky Way is estimated to contain 100–400 billion stars. There are probably at least 100 billion planets in the Milky Way. The Solar System is located within the disk, about 26,000 light-years from the Galactic Center, on the inner edge {{of one of the}} spiral-shaped concentrations of gas and dust called the Orion Arm. The stars in the inner ≈10,000 light-years form a bulge and one or more bars that radiate from the bulge. The <b>very</b> <b>center</b> is marked by an intense radio source, named Sagittarius A*, which {{is likely to be a}} supermassive black hole.|$|E

In downtown Belgrade there are streets named after Rigas Fereos, Eleftherios Venizelos, Athenian street, Thessaloniki street, Agion Oros street, Macedonian street, Corfu street, to name a few. There are also monuments dedicated to Rigas Fereos and Eleftherios Venizelos in the <b>very</b> <b>center</b> of the Serbian capital.|$|E

Just one other fragmented sculpture– a human head– had been found elsewhere, near the sacred well of Banatou (Narbolia, OR). This site is ca. 2km away from the nuraghe S'Uraki, and the head was found together with various ceramics finds, either Punic and Nuragic.|$|E

25|$|To resolve detail, the eye's {{optical system}} has to project a focused image on the fovea, a region inside the macula having the highest density of cone {{photoreceptor}} cells (the only kind of photoreceptors existing in the fovea's <b>very</b> <b>center</b> of 300 m diameter), thus having the highest resolution and best color vision. Acuity and color vision, despite being mediated by the same cells, are different physiologic functions that do not interrelate except by position. Acuity and color vision can be affected independently.|$|E
25|$|While Ben Gurion Airport is {{conveniently}} {{located in}} the <b>very</b> <b>center</b> of the country, this fact also means that the airport is surrounded by various residential communities who often complain of noise pollution caused by the airport. Following {{the completion of the}} extension of runway 03/21, residents north of the airport sued the Israeli aviation authorities claiming that the authorities intend to use the runway to a greater degree than was originally agreed with them during the approval process for the airport runways' reconfiguration project.|$|E

Shilton is also known for his powerful post moves, {{most of the time}} successfully drawing a foul. Although not a good free throw shooter ( [...] a little below 50% for the 09-10 season), Shilton scores some crucial points at the foul line on the very competitive games in NBB, Brazilian premier league.|$|R

25|$|This {{relationship}} {{means that}} certain key features {{can be observed}} in both drum membrane modes and atomic orbitals. For example, in all of the modes analogous to sorbitals (the top row in the animated illustration below), {{it can be seen that}} the <b>very</b> <b>center</b> of the drum membrane vibrates most strongly, corresponding to the antinode in all sorbitals in an atom. This antinode means the electron is most likely to be at the physical position of the nucleus (which it passes straight through without scattering or striking it), since it is moving (on average) most rapidly at that point, giving it maximal momentum.|$|E
25|$|Because quasars are distant objects, {{any light}} which reaches the Earth is redshifted {{due to the}} metric {{expansion}} of space. Quasars inhabit the <b>very</b> <b>center</b> of active, young galaxies, and {{are among the most}} luminous, powerful, and energetic objects known in the universe, emitting up to a thousand times the energy output of the Milky Way, which contains 200–400 billion stars. This radiation is emitted across the electromagnetic spectrum, almost uniformly, from X-rays to the far-infrared with a peak in the ultraviolet-optical bands, with some quasars also being strong sources of radio emission and of gamma-rays.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after the}} foundation, a theater, a chamber of commerce, meeting clubs, public {{libraries}} and dance halls were erected as well. The {{position of the}} city, almost in the <b>very</b> <b>center</b> of the country, made it as a perfect halt and a great communication link, east-west and north-south, creating a slow but unstoppable growth. By the 19th century, Santa Clara was bigger and more populated {{than the rest of}} the towns around, including what was once Remedios. As a necessary stop between Havana and the east of the country, the city gained the title of Las Villas province capital.|$|E
40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{possibility}} of thermal flares in centers of AGNs and microquasars. We present preliminary results of an ongoing study trying to assess the feasibility of a hypothesis suggesting that certain flares observed in these sources originate in the <b>very</b> <b>centers</b> of the systems {{and not in the}} relativistic jets. Using a simple toy model we reproduce optical flares with lightcurves very similar to those observed in the sources. The model suits especially well those cases where only the latter peak of a double-peaked optical flare has a radio counterpart.
