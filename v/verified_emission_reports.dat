Although EPA allows facilities to estimate their emissions in this manner, EPA officials generally consider direct methods to be more reliable. The accuracy of these reports is important because they influence (1) the financing of states' regulatory programs through fees and (2) the development of emissions inventories, which, in turn, help regulators to develop control strategies and establish permit limits. Furthermore, steps taken to assess the accuracy of these reports, such as more thoroughly reviewing the supporting information, could improve compliance with Clean Air Act requirements. For example, a more thorough review of the information underlying a facility's <b>emission</b> <b>reports,</b> or a more systematic comparison of these reports over time, could identify increased emissions. Such indications could, in turn, trigger a review of compliance with new source review requirements, {{an area in which}} EPA found widespread noncompliance in four industries. In the four states that GAO reviewed, the states that had done the most detailed reviews found widespread inaccuracies. Although it is taking steps to improve its overall compliance monitoring strategy, EPA does not plan to evaluate states' processes for <b>verifying</b> <b>emissions</b> <b>reports</b> from large facilities. ...|$|R

Using Allan variance analysis, we show that the differential column measurement has a precision of 0. 01  % for X CO 2 and X CH 4 with an optimum integration time of 10  min, corresponding to Allan deviations of 0. 04  ppm and 0. 2  ppb, respectively. The sensor system is very stable over time and after relocation across the continent. We report tests of the differential column measurement, and its sensitivity to emission sources, by measuring the downwind-minus-upwind column difference Δ X CH 4 across dairy farms in the Chino area, California, and using the data to <b>verify</b> <b>emissions</b> <b>reported</b> in the literature. Ratios of spatial column differences Δ X CH 4 ∕Δ X CO 2 were observed across Pasadena within the Los Angeles basin, indicating values consistent with regional emission ratios from the literature. Our precise, rapid measurements allow us to determine significant short-term variations (5 – 10  min) of X CO 2 and X CH 4 and {{to show that they}} represent atmospheric phenomena. Overall, this study helps establish a range of new applications for compact solar-viewing Fourier transform spectrometers. By accurately measuring the small differences in integrated column amounts across local and regional sources, we directly observe the mass loading of the atmosphere due to the influence of emissions in the intervening locale. The inference of the source strength is much more direct than inversion modeling using only surface concentrations and less subject to errors associated with small-scale transport phenomena...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigate}} how the publication of <b>verified</b> <b>emissions</b> in the European Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) affected stock prices of covered companies. Based on a unique sample of 368 listed companies located in 25 countries, the event study demonstrates that 2 out of 6 publication events over the period 2006 - 2011 resulted in statistically significant market responses. The two significant events were the first publication of <b>verified</b> <b>emissions</b> in the first phase, a pilot period that ran from 2005 to 2007, and the first publication in the second phase, coinciding with the Kyoto Protocol commitment period and comprising the years 2008 to 2012. These findings indicate that investors value particularly the information revealed at the first verification event of each EU ETS phase and that subsequent verification events are less informative. The cross-section analysis of abnormal returns surrounding the publication of <b>verified</b> <b>emission</b> does not yield consistent results. While {{the analysis of the}} first publication in the first phase provides insignificant results, we find a significant negative correlation between the market reaction and the level of unexpected <b>verified</b> <b>emissions</b> during the first publication in the second phase. This negative relationship is found to be significantly stronger for carbon-intensive firms. These different results suggest that investors’ perception towards emission allowances has changed {{between the first and second}} phase.

40|$|Globally, {{the waste}} sector {{contributes}} to nearly {{a fifth of}} anthropogenic methane emitted to the atmosphere and is the second largest source of methane in the UK. In recent years great improvements to reduce those emissions have been achieved by installation of methane recovery systems at landfill sites and subsequently methane <b>emissions</b> <b>reported</b> in national <b>emission</b> inventories have been reduced. Nevertheless, methane emissions of landfills remain uncertain and quantification of emission fluxes is essential to <b>verify</b> <b>reported</b> <b>emission</b> inventories and to monitor changes in emissions. Here we present a new approach for methane emission quantification from a complex source like a landfill site by applying a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model to calibrated in situ measurements of methane {{as part of a}} field campaign at a landfill site near Ipswich, UK, in August 2014. The methane distribution for different meteorological scenarios is calculated with the CFD model and compared to methane mole fractions measured by an in situ Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer downwind of the prevailing wind direction. Assuming emissions only from the active site, a mean daytime flux of 0. 83 [*]mg[*]m− 2 [*]s− 1, corresponding to 53. 26 [*]kg[*]h− 1, was estimated. The addition of a secondary source area adjacent to the active site, where some methane hotspots were observed, improved the agreement between the simulated and measured methane distribution. As a result, the flux from the active site was reduced slightly to 0. 71 [*]mg[*]m− 2 [*]s− 1 (45. 56 [*]kg[*]h− 1), at the same time an additional flux of 0. 32 [*]mg[*]m− 2 [*]s− 1 (30. 41 [*]kg[*]h− 1) was found from the secondary source area. This highlights the capability of our method to distinguish between different emission areas of the landfill site, which can provide more detailed information about emission source apportionment compared to other methods deriving bulk emissions...|$|R

In a first step we employ event study methods to detect possibly abnormal returns on the respective announcement dates using a sample of quoted stock market firms from Austria, Denmark, Germany and the UK. In a second step we link the estimated abnormal returns to firm characteristics based on the EU ETS (such as <b>verified</b> <b>emissions</b> or over-allocation) {{as well as to}} financial firm level data in a cross-sectional analysis. Even though the overall cost from the new regulation on the individual firms was minor, we find evidence for the asset value hypothesis, which states that higher <b>verified</b> <b>emissions</b> induce a higher future permit allocation.

40|$|Quantifying {{greenhouse}} gas (GHG) emissions from cities {{is a key}} challenge towards effective emissions management. An inversion analysis from the INdianapolis FLUX experiment (INFLUX) project, as {{the first of its}} kind, has achieved a top-down emission estimate for a single city using CO 2 data collected by the dense tower network deployed across the city. However, city-level emission data, used as 'a priori' emissions, are also a key component in the atmospheric inversion framework. Currently, fine-grained emission inventories (EIs) able to resolve GHG city emissions at high spatial resolution, are only available for few major cities across the globe. Following the INFLUX inversion case with a global 1. 1 km ODIAC fossil fuel CO 2 emission dataset, we further improved the ODIAC emission field and examined its utility as a prior for the city scale inversion. We disaggregated the 1. 1 km ODIAC non-point source emissions using geospatial datasets such as the global road network data and satellite-data driven surface imperviousness data to a 30. 30 m resolution. We assessed the impact of the improved emission field on the inversion result, relative to priors in previous studies (Hestia and ODIAC). The posterior total emission estimate (5. 1 MtC/yr) remains statistically similar to the previous estimate with ODIAC (5. 3 MtC/yr). However, the distribution of the flux corrections was very close to those of Hestia inversion and the model-observation mismatches were significantly reduced both in forward and inverse runs, even without hourly temporal changes in <b>emissions.</b> EIs <b>reported</b> by cities often do not have estimates of spatial extents. Thus, emission disaggregation is a required step when <b>verifying</b> those <b>reported</b> <b>emissions</b> using atmospheric models. Our approach offers gridded emission estimates for global cities that could serves as a prior for inversion, even without locally reported EIs in a systematic way to support city-level Measuring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) practice implementation...|$|R

40|$|Early {{emissions}} trading programs obtained {{a very high}} rate of compliance, in part through a system of continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS). As they expand into {{a wider range of}} pollutants and sources, however, {{emissions trading}} programs will {{no longer be able to}} rely entirely, or even primarily, on CEMS. Instead, policy designers will have to rely on different forms of self-reporting, as was done in the early stages of the EU Emissions Trading System and as is common in many other forms of environmental and regulatory compliance, including taxation policy. The cost of verifying these self-reports is an important concern, one directly related to the likelihood of non-compliance. This paper asks if by improving “affirmative motivations ” (Tyler 2006; May 2005) for compliance among emitters, such policies could reduce under-reporting and thus the frequency of required audits to <b>verify</b> self-reported <b>emissions</b> information, thereby reducing program costs without unduly jeopardizing environmental integrity. Using a computerized laboratory emissions trading market, we find that many subjects reported honestly in situations where dishonest reporting was obviously more profitable, as well as a statistically significant association between perceptions of a policy’s fairness and legitimacy with more honest levels of <b>emissions</b> <b>reporting.</b> These results suggest that designing an emissions trading program to increase its perceived legitimacy and fairness among users has the potential to increase honest <b>emissions</b> <b>reporting</b> and thereby lower monitoring costs for programs where continuous emissions monitors (CEMS) are not possible or practical...|$|R

40|$|Reducing {{uncertainties}} in {{projections of}} surface emissions of major greenhouse gases (GHGs) including CO 2 relies on continuously improving our scientific {{understanding of the}} exchange processes between the atmosphere and land at regional scales. In order to enhance our understanding in emission processes and atmospheric transports, an integrated framework that addresses individual natural and anthropogenic factors in a complementary way proves to be invaluable. This study presents an example of top-down inverse modeling that utilizes high precision measurement data collected at a Canadian greenhouse gas monitoring site. The measurements include multiple tracers encompassing standard greenhouse gas species, stable isotopes of CO 2, and combustion-related species. The potential for the proposed analysis framework is demonstrated using Stochastic Time- Inverted Lagrangian Transport (STILT) model runs to yield a unique regional-scale constraint {{that can be used}} to relate the observed changes of tracer concentrations to the processes in their upwind source regions. The uncertainties in emission estimates are assessed using different transport fields and background concentrations coupled with the STILT model. Also, methods to further reduce uncertainties in the retrieved emissions by incorporating additional constraints including tracer-to- tracer correlations and satellite measurements are briefly discussed. The inversion approach both reproduces source areas in a spatially explicit way through sophisticated Lagrangian transport modeling and infers emission processes that leave imprints on atmospheric tracers. The results indicate that the changes in greenhouse gas concentration are strongly influenced by regional sources, including significant contributions from fossil fuel emissions, and that the integrated approach can be used for regulatory regimes to <b>verify</b> <b>reported</b> <b>emissions</b> of the greenhouse gas from oilsands developments...|$|R
40|$|The {{intent of}} this {{research}} is to examine the effectiveness and impact of the UK’s mandatory reporting of company greenhouse gas emissions, otherwise known as carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 e) emissions, in accordance to The Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013, especially regarding the regulations’ influence on quality of a company’s CO 2 e <b>emission</b> <b>reporting,</b> setting of CO 2 e emission reduction targets, and the comparability to other companies’ CO 2 e emission measurement. To examine these questions, an analysis and comparison of fifty companies’ CO 2 e <b>emissions</b> <b>reporting</b> preceding and succeeding their compliance to The Companies Act regulations is conducted. The research finds The Companies Act regulations likely cause smaller companies to begin CO 2 e measurement, improve companies’ accuracy of CO 2 e <b>emission</b> source <b>reporting,</b> and cause the majority of companies to create an emission intensity ratio for their <b>emission</b> <b>reporting.</b> There are also indications The Companies Act regulations encourage companies to improve the format of <b>emissions</b> <b>reporting</b> in their annual reports, which allows for greater transparency and readability to company stakeholders. Finally, the research finds indications The Companies Act regulations encourage companies to either set stronger emission reduction targets or maintain existing targets, while comparability of CO 2 e emissions between companies does not appear to significantly improve due to The Companies Act regulations. These research results may be important when the UK is considering expansion of The Companies Act’s CO 2 e <b>emission</b> <b>reporting</b> regulations to additional UK companies; research findings indicate The Companies Act regulations improve companies’ awareness and accountability of their emissions, but just as noteworthy are additional findings which raise opportunities of consideration for improvement before the expansion of the regulations...|$|R
