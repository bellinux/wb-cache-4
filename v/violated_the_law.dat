5|$|In {{what was}} seen to have {{promoted}} anti-incumbency, a scandal regarding campaign finance followed allegation that the Centre Party's Timo Kalli's, who was also {{the head of the}} party's parliamentary group, admission in early May 2009 that he <b>violated</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> on reporting electoral campaign financing by not disclosing financial contributions he received for his election campaign during the previous election in 2007. When the media then delved further into the issue, stories started to emerge of common practice with a multitude of MPs not disclosing their financial benefactors, a practice which was not punishable under Finnish law. The media investigations focused on a group of entrepreneurs called Kehittyvien Maakuntien Suomi (Finland of Developing Provinces) who financed the electoral campaigns of numerous high-profile government and opposition candidates. Further investigations revealed that many recipients of their financial support did not register or even mention the amounts they received from the group. Then Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen was {{at the core of the}} accusations after the investigations showed he had also been among the beneficiaries of the groups' financing; this was despite one of the members of the group who had planned to build the biggest shopping mall in the country received Vanhanen's support for the plans against the grain of public opinion, thus eliciting accusations that he could have been influenced by the individual. Blame was also put on the Centre Party's secretary Jarmo Korhonen. This was said to have helped the True Finns.|$|E

Dissent on his confirmation centred on his support for some of Bill Clinton's controversial pardons and commutations of sentence.

25|$|The Washington Post {{found no}} {{evidence}} that Cuccinelli sought to personally intervene in the lawsuit. In April 2013, Cuccinelli recused himself from the case, hiring private attorneys to defend the state. Cuccinelli subsequently announced that he had discovered the equivalent of $4,500 in additional gifts from Jonnie R. Williams that he had not previously disclosed, including free use of Williams' Smith Mountain Lake vacation lodge in 2010 and 2012. In response, Cuccinelli asked the Commonwealth’s attorney to review his disclosure filings. On July 18, 2013, a state prosecutor announced that he had {{found no evidence}} that Cuccinelli had <b>violated</b> <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> saying Cuccinelli {{did not appear to be}} attempting to conceal the relationship with Williams and he did not intentionally mischaracterize any gifts.|$|E

The original plaintiffs argued that the entire contract, including the arbitration clause, was invalid because it <b>violated</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b> When it was appealed to the High Court, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote {{for a majority of}} seven that the Federal Arbitration Act, as previously interpreted by the Court, settled a question that had long been debated by legal scholars and lower-court judges. The opinion distinguished void and voidable contracts, requiring that in the latter an arbitrator rule on all issues including the legality of the contract unless the arbitration clause was itself challenged. The only dissenter was Clarence Thomas, who restated his belief that the Arbitration Act does not supersede state law.|$|E

500|$|The {{arrival of}} Spanish {{cardinals}} Solis and de la Cerda on April 27 strengthened the anti-Jesuit party. They also <b>violated</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> of the conclave by establishing regular correspondence with Spanish ambassador Azpuru. The Spaniards had fewer scruples than Bernis and, supported by Cardinal Malvezzi, took the matter {{into their own}} hands. They {{paid attention to the}} only friar in the Sacred College, Cardinal Lorenzo Ganganelli, O.F.M.Conv. The attitude of Ganganelli towards the Jesuits was a great mystery – he had been educated by the Jesuits and it was said that he received the red hat at the instance of Father Lorenzo Ricci, general of the Society of Jesus, but during the pontificate of Clement XIII he did not engage himself in the defence of the Order. Cardinal Solis began by sounding him out as to his willingness to give the promise required by the Bourbon princes as an indispensable condition for election. Ganganelli answered that [...] "he recognized in the sovereign pontiff the right to extinguish, with good conscience, the Society of Jesus, provided he observed the canon law; and that it was desirable that the pope should do everything in his power to satisfy the wishes of the Crowns". It is not certain whether it was a written or only an oral promise, but this declaration fully satisfied the ambassadors.|$|E

40|$|After September 11, 2001, {{additions}} and {{modifications to}} federal law placed renewed {{focus on the}} ability of the government to prosecute American citizens for extraterritorial misconduct that <b>violates</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> of war. This Note argues that federal laws, in their totality, provide the ability to prosecute American citizens who <b>violate</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> of war while outside the territorial limits of the United States. Although the scope of prosecutable offenses under the War Crimes Act is limited, other federal laws present prosecutors with multiple options for bringing an American citizen to justice in either a federal court or military court-mardal for a violation of <b>the</b> <b>law</b> of war. <b>The</b> cases of United States v. Passam and United Stales v. Green demonstrate that Americans who <b>violate</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> of war can be, and have been, prosecuted by using means other than the War Crimes Act. This Note highlights deficiencies, however, in federal laws that create circumstances where immunity from prosecution exists for certain assaults that <b>violate</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> of war. <b>The</b> Note then concludes with recommendations for congressional action to change federal <b>law</b> and <b>the</b> Uniform Code of Military Justice to fix existing deficiencies and strengthen the ability of the U. S. government to hold American citizens accountable for extraterritorial misconduct that <b>violates</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> of war...|$|R

2500|$|The {{court found}} that section 632 (which prohibits the {{eavesdropping}} or recording of a [...] "confidential communication by means of any electronic amplifying or recording device"), does not apply in this case. The reason behind this decision is that: (1) the plain words of the statute simply do not permit a finding that Nissan's conduct <b>violated</b> <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> as no amplifying or recording device was used to retrieve and read plaintiffs' E-mail messages. (2) section 632 proscribes only “the interception of communications {{by the use of}} equipment which is not connected to any transmission line” (People v. Ratekin, 212 Cal.App.3d 1165, 1168 (Cal.

[...] On that date, Doug Sohn, owner of a gourmet hot dog shop was charged with a violation. [...] Although the fine could have been as high as $500, Sohn agreed to pay a $250 fine on March 29.
