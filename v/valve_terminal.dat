40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{prediction}} of aerodynamic noise resulting from the flow through porous media. A porous flat plate silencer of a pneumatic <b>valve</b> <b>terminal</b> serves as a model test case. In an experimental setup, the porous plate was put in the outflow of an air supply pipe and the aerodynamic noise was recorded at five positions on a cylindrical hull surface around the outflow. This thesis aims at correctly reprodudcing sound pressure levels by performing a fully resolved simulation of the flow through the porous pores and a direct computation of the sound generation. This task is approached with the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM), {{which is based on}} a simplified, statistical model of particle movement allowing the simulation of fluids in a weakly compressible regime. An essential part of this work is the development of the highly parallel, octree-based flow solver Musubi. Musubi is part of the APES-simulation suite, providing tools based on the central octree structure for solving complex fluid problems and allowing the flexible and efficient usage with extremely large data sets. Details and data structures of the flow solver are presented. On modern computing platforms, an efficient solution of large problems can be achieved only through an increased amount of parallelism and heterogeneity in the machines. Software has to adapt to this development and must be specially tailored {{to make use of the}} theoretically available computing capacity. This steady increase in complexity also affects programming, by which maintenance, extension and porting of scientific software becomes increasingly difficult. Therefore new programming paradigms are created enabling the compilers in theory to automatically perform large amounts of optimization for these complex machines. The parallel extension of Fortran is such a new model and is evaluated for suitability in the context of the LBM in this thesis. The solver Musubi is then validated by means of suitable test cases for all flow regimes. The latter include the turbulent flow through porous media, the aeroacoustic sound generation as well as a validation of the local grid refinement which is needed to model such a multi-scale problem. Finally, the insights gained are applied to solve the actual problem of the flow through the porous flat plate silencer...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{aim of this}} {{case-control study}} was to {{determine}} whether preoperative duplex imaging could predict the outcome of varicose vein surgery without saphenofemoral junction (SFJ) disconnection. The duplex protocol included a reflux elimination test (RET) and assessment of the competence of the <b>terminal</b> <b>valve</b> of the femoral vein. METHODS: One hundred patients with chronic venous disease who had a positive RET result and an incompetent <b>terminal</b> <b>valve</b> were compared with 100 patients matched for age, sex, clinical class (Clinical Etiologic Anatomic Pathophysiologic (CEAP) class C 2 -C 6) and disease duration, but who had a positive RET result and a competent <b>terminal</b> <b>valve.</b> All patients underwent ligation and proximal avulsion of the incompetent tributaries from the great saphenous vein trunk without SFJ disconnection. Clinical and duplex follow-up lasted for 3 years, and included Hobbs' clinical score. RESULTS: Of legs with a competent <b>terminal</b> <b>valve,</b> 100 per cent were rated as cured (Hobbs' class A or B) and 14. 0 per cent developed recurrent varices. Patients with an incompetent <b>terminal</b> <b>valve</b> had significantly worse results: 29. 0 per cent had Hobbs' class A or B and 82. 0 per cent developed recurrence (P < 0. 001).

40|$|Chaetoceros wighamii Brightwell is a planktonic diatom species {{originally}} described from brackish waters. Since {{its original}} description, the species {{has been reported}} {{in a wide variety of}} habitats, ranging from freshwater to marine. Varying descriptions exist in the taxonomic literature and several taxa have been considered as synonyms, including freshwater species Chaetoceros amanita. In this study we provide morphological and ultrastructural information on a cultured strain isolated from freshwater sample collected in the Lake Vrana (Vransko jezero) in Croatia, in April 2011. The cells form short and robust chains with very narrow apertures, often partially occluded by silica membranes. Other distinctive features observable in light microscopy are the shape and orientation of the setae which are very long, straight and robust, diverging in various directions from the chain axis and the single parietal chloroplast extending from valve to valve. Distinct ultrastructural characteristics are the absence of processes either in intercalary or <b>terminal</b> <b>valves</b> and the ornamentation of the valve face with densely distributed ribs spreading from an irregular eccentric hyaline area without a clearly defi ned annulus.

The vein of Giacomini {{is often}} {{identified}} with the cranial extension of the small saphenous vein {{despite the fact that}} according to the international interdisciplinary anatomical nomenclature they are distinguished from one another. The objective of the research was to improve the results of treatment of patients with lower limb primary chronic venous disease disease studying the variation in anatomy and pathology of the vein of Giacomini and the cranial extension of the small saphenous vein with subsequent development of differential surgical tactics. Materials and methods. 502 patients with primary chronic venous disease on 605 legs were examined and treated. Each patient underwent preoperative ultrasonographic triplex scanning of the lower limb venous system. Results. Varicose dilatation of the vein of Giacomini was observed in 3. 8 % of patients (95 % CI 2. 4 - 5. 6 %), and the pathology of the cranial extension of the small saphenous vein was detected in 1. 7 % of patients (95 % CI 0. 8 - 3. 0 %). When the arch of the small saphenous vein was present the following variations in the pathology of the vein of Giacomini were observed: 1) the spread of reflux from the great saphenous vein to the vein of Giacomini; 2) reflux from the <b>terminal</b> <b>valve</b> of the small saphenous vein intensified the antegrade flow of blood within the vein of Giacomini resulting in reflux in the great saphenous vein distal {{to the point where the}} vein of Giacomini drained into the great saphenous vein.

40|$|According to {{literature}} data, up to 59 % of incompetent great saphenous veins (GSV) have no reflux at the <b>terminal</b> <b>valve</b> (TV) of the saphenofemoral junction (SFJ). The {{aim was to}} compare color duplex ultrasound (CDU) investigation and direct intra-operative assessment of competence of the TV at SFJ. A prospective comparative study was performed on 28 patients, who consecutively presented for surgical intervention for their primary varicose veins of the lower limbs with GSV incompetence. CDU assessment was performed pre-operatively to define GSV and SFJ <b>terminal</b> <b>valve</b> morphology and hemodynamics. Under local anesthesia these patients underwent SFJ disconnection (crossectomy) and segmental inverted saphenous stripping of the incompetent GSV tract + phlebectomy of the varicose tributaries. SFJ disconnection was performed in four stages in an ascending fashion: I) division of GSV below the lower SFJ tributaries, II) disconnection of lower SFJ tributaries, III) disconnection of upper tributaries, IV) flush to CFV ligature of GSV stump. After the completion of stage I, the SFJ stump was opened and kept open when needed throughout the subsequent stages, in order to highlight any possible blood leak through the SFJ stump. To highlight intraoperative blood leak from SFJ stump visual observation was carried out both during respiration and when performing Valsalva maneuver and manual compression of homolateral iliac fossa. As to pre-operative CDU all limbs showed GSV reflux and they were divided in two groups according to TV competence (group A) or incompetence (group B). Group A comprised 18 patients (6 M and 12 F), mean age 50. 6 years. Group B included 10 patients (4 M and 6 F), mean age 54. 8 years. Mean calibre of GSV at proximal/mid thigh was 6. 4 mm in group A and 7. 8 in group B. Concerning the intra-operative findings: in the group A, 5 patients had blood leak in the SFJ stump after stage I, 4 patients showed blood leak after stage II. After completion of stage III, only one severely obese patient had persistent reflux, whereas 17 patients had no reflux. Conversely the 10 patients from group B had reflux within GSV stump throughout the 3 stages. CDU pre-operative assessment matches intra-operative findings with regards to GSV TV competence/incompetence, with a good overall accuracy (27 / 28 - 94 %). Different SFJ retrograde flow patterns should be elicited through CDU investigation. Obese patients need a more thorough CDU examination to avoid false negatives...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Pregnancy {{represents}} a special situation where both the mechanical and hormonal instigating factors of varicose veins are reversible with the venous valve cusps preserved. Exostent venous valve repairs are a physiological alternative which minimises stimulus to collateral growth (recurrence). The study {{purpose was to}} assess the effect of pregnancy on the durability of valve repairs. Methods: In a prospective study of 36 limbs, 20 young females (30 ± 4. 7 years) had an exostent implanted to the <b>terminal</b> <b>valve</b> of the saphenofemoral junction for varicose veins. At routine long-term follow up (9. 7 ± 3. 8 years), 38 pregnancies were completed (mean: 1. 8, range: 1 - 4). The controls were a non-pregnant group of limbs (n= 386). Results: At 9. 7 years, the internal diameter of the greater saphenous vein (GSV) changed from 7. 8 ± 2. 8 mm preoperatively to 4. 5 ± 1. 4 mm post-operatively. Recurrence was associated with reflux, preoperative deep system and ovarian vein involvement. Pregnancy induced 33. 3 % recurrences compared with non-pregnant controls (4. 7 %) similarly treated or 22. 8 % compared with non-pregnant ablative controls. At 9. 7 years, symptomatic improvement continued with significantly better CEAP status (described later) (31 CSEAP preoperative to 6 CSEAP) with no further truncal ablation (strip, laser) required. Conclusions: Venous valve repairs can withstand the special stresses of pregnancy. There is no need to ablate the GSV. This approach is contrary to the traditional dictum; the treatment of varicose veins should be delayed until the family is completed. 6 page(s...|$|R

The vein is divided/ligated about 2 cm distal from the ostium, the distal stump is cannulated and foam is injected on the distal segment from the E-point incision in a retrograde fashion, varices are avulsed by phlebectomy. Twenty procedures in 18 patients (venous clinical severity score: mean 3. 15 - GSV diameter: mean 7. 34) were performed, all the cases without inconveniences, with a duration not exceeding 10 min {{in addition to the}} phlebectomy procedure time. No complications as hemorrhage, infection, nerve lesion, lymphatic leak or thrombosis have been registered. At one month the residual saphenous stump length was in average 2. 16 cm with complete closure of GSV in all. Three patients have been controlled at 6 months showing GSV complete closure. The procedure described is a simple office US assisted method for GSV ligationdivision, leaving the 2 last cm of the saphenofemoral junction. It could be associated to most of the procedures in use with limited additional time and resources required...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{evaluated}} how patient {{characteristics and}} duplex ultrasound findings influence management decisions of physicians with specific {{expertise in the}} field of chronic venous disease. MethodsWorldwide, 346 physicians with a known interest and experience in phlebology were invited to participate in an online survey about management strategies in patients with great saphenous vein (GSV) reflux and refluxing tributaries. The survey included two basic vignettes representing a 47 year old healthy male with GSV reflux above the knee and a 27 year old healthy female with a short segment refluxing GSV (CEAP classification C 2 sEpAs 2, 5 Pr in both cases). Participants could choose one or more treatment options. Subsequently, the basic vignettes were modified according to different patient characteristics (e. g. older age, morbid obesity, anticoagulant treatment, peripheral arterial disease), clinical class (C 4, C 6), and duplex ultrasound findings (e. g. competent <b>terminal</b> <b>valve,</b> larger or smaller GSV diameter, presence of focal dilatation). The authors recorded the distribution of chosen management strategies; adjustment of strategies according to characteristics; and follow up strategies. ResultsA total of 211 physicians (68 % surgeons, 12 % dermatologists, 12 % angiologists, and 8 % phlebologists) from 36 different countries completed the survey. In the basic case vignettes 1 and 2, respectively, 55 % and 40 % of participants proposed to perform endovenous thermal ablation, either with or without concomitant phlebectomies (p < . 001). Looking at the modified case vignettes, between 20 % and 64 % of participants proposed to adapt their management strategy, opting for either a more or a less invasive treatment, depending on the modification introduced. The distribution of chosen management strategies changed significantly for all modified vignettes (p < . 05). ConclusionsThis study illustrates the worldwide variety in management preferences for treating patients with varicose veins (C 2 –C 6). In clinical practice, patient related and duplex ultrasound related factors clearly influence therapeutic options...|$|R
40|$|Aim: High {{ligation}} (HL) and stripping of GSV can {{be distinguished}} in Babcock's radical ligation (RHL), and selective (SHL) : the new technique consists to ligate the SFJ keeping some of the tributary veins. The study analyzes the neovascularization and recurrence incidence in the groin after the SHL Methods: A retrospective study performed in a center specialized in venous surgery in Italy, it included 360 patients underwent unilateral varicose vein surgery from January 2001 to December 2008 (210 females and 150 males, mean aged 51. 9 years, range 18 to 75 years, the limbs were 222 rights and 138 lefts), CEAP classification was C 2,s. Operative technique was standardised to SFJ ligation with the SHL, the GSV was stripped {{to the level of}} the knee, multiple phlebectomies were performed and the ligation of the incontinent perforating veins was performed if it was necessary. All patients had a venous reflux from <b>terminal</b> <b>valve</b> of SFJ and the femoral valves were continent. All patients were submitted to clinical examination of the lower limbs and Duplex Scanning (DS) in the pre/postoperative period every year after surgery and by two independent operator in 2013. The follow-up is from 5 years for the patients operated in 2008 to 12 years for the patients operated in 2001. Results: The neovascularizations and recurrencies in the groin were founded in 7 patients, the incidence is 1. 9 % of the total cases. The GSV stump and the left tributaries were open to venous flow, it was no venous reflux from the groin, no venous thrombosis of the GSV stump were detected. Conclusion: The SHL of the SFJ is a reliable technique, decreasing the incidence of neovascularizations and recurrent varicose veins in the operated groi...|$|R
40|$|Aims: Fluoroscopy {{does not}} allow {{identification}} specific anatomical landmarks during electrophysiological studies. Intra-cardiac echocardiography permits visualization of these structures with excellent accuracy, but the optimal method has not been fully described. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the capability of intra-cardiac echocardiography for the visualization of such structures using two different approaches. We also assessed its capability for the evaluation of radio frequency lesions 20 min after catheter ablation of the cavo-tricuspid isthmus. Methods: Intra-cardiac echocardiography was performed using a 9 MHz rotating transducer in eight consecutive patients (age range: 37 - 76 years) after radio frequency ablation of the cavo-tricuspid isthmus. The ultrasound catheter was inserted through the femoral vein into the superior vena cava and was pulled back to the inferior vena cava. The echo catheter was then reinserted through the subclavian vein and advanced into the right ventricular apex and was pulled back from the right ventricular to the superior vena cava. Qualitative evaluation and intracardiac measurements were performed off-line. Results: The fossa ovalis, the tricuspid <b>valve,</b> and the <b>terminal</b> crest were visible in all patients regardless of the method of introduction of the echo catheter. Left-sided structures were less accurately seen by intra-cardiac echocardiography. The horizontal diameter of the fossa ovalis was 8. 9 ± 1. 8 mm. The cavo-tricuspid isthmus was visible using the femoral approach in three patients. The isthmus could be visualized in all patients, and in three patients together with the ostium of the coronary sinus, using the subclavian approach radio frequency lesions were not visible 20 min after ablation. Additionally, both the left and right ventricles could be seen using the subclavian approach. Conclusions: The subclavian approach is feasible, safe and superior to visualize the isthmus. Twenty minutes after radio frequency ablation of the cavo-tricuspid isthmus radio frequency lesions are not visible using intra-cardiac echocardiography...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective: This {{study was}} done to {{determine}} the long-term incidence of refluxing epifascial–to–deep vein reconnections {{in the area of}} the former saphenofemoral junction after ligation of the true junction, along with all proximal tributaries, and resection of the greater saphenous vein. Patients and Methods: A total of 125 limbs in 77 patients, representing 66 % of 117 survivors among 602 patients who underwent operation between 1960 and 1967, were evaluated clinically and with duplex sonography for possible superficial–to–deep vein reconnections and clinical recurrence of thigh varicosities at a mean follow-up of 34 years. Results: Clinical examination suggested saphenofemoral recurrence in 59 limbs (47 %). In 11 instances these were actually varices associated with isolated superficial system reflux or reflux originating from a distally located perforating vein. Color-coded duplex ultrasonography demonstrated saphenofemoral reflux in 75 limbs (60 %), versus the 48 identified on clinical examination (P <. 001), and documented that the junction ligation had not been performed incorrectly by absence of the <b>terminal</b> <b>valve</b> or any patent proximal saphenous remnant. The reflux originated at the site of the ligated saphenofemoral junction in 53 limbs (71 %) and from a nearby circumjunctional deep vein in the other 22 (29 %). Of the real junctional recurrences, 22 appeared as a tangled cluster, and 31 involved a single-lumen varix. Only 27 recurrences were sufficiently symptomatic to warrant consideration of additional treatment; 25 of these were clinically evident, single-lumen, true junctional recurrences. Conclusions: This 34 -year clinical follow-up study shows a 60 % incidence of junctional and circumjunctional reconnections after ligation of the true saphenofemoral junction and its related tributaries. Color-coded duplex sonography is a necessary concomitant to clinical examination, detecting more recurrences and defining the pathologic anatomy to direct clinically indicated additional treatments.
