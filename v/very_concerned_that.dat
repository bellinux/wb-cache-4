500|$|The rescuers {{concealed}} {{the fate}} of the snowshoe party, informing the rescued immigrants only that they did not return because they were frostbitten. Patty and Tommy Reed were soon too weak to cross the snowdrifts, and no one was strong enough to carry them. Margret Reed faced the agonizing predicament of accompanying her two older children to Bear Valley and watching her two frailest be taken back to Truckee Lake without a parent. She made rescuer Aquilla Glover swear on his honor as a Mason that he would return for her children. Patty Reed told her, [...] "Well, mother, if you never see me again, do the best you can." [...] Upon their return to the lake, the Breens flatly refused them entry to their cabin but, after Glover left more food, the children were grudgingly admitted. The rescue party was dismayed to find that the first cache station had been broken into by animals, leaving them without food for four days. After struggling on the walk over the pass, John Denton slipped into a coma and died. Ada Keseberg died soon afterwards; her mother was inconsolable, refusing to let the child's body go. After several days' more travel through difficult country, the rescuers grew <b>very</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>that</b> the children would not survive. Some of them ate the buckskin fringe from one of the rescuer's pants, and the shoelaces of another, to the relief party's surprise.

CBR should also ensure that interventions in HIV/AIDS are presented to PWDs in an accessible and acceptable form.

5000|$|Parylene {{is green}} polymer chemistry. It is self-initiated (no {{initiator}} needed) and un-terminated (no termination group needed) with no solvent or catalyst required.

And yet, {{this is one of}} the few issues that the US. Supreme Court refuses to regulate. The justices mask their refusal to regulate this area on a professed inability to divine judicially-manageable standards. In turn, scholars offer new standards for the justices to consider. This is not only a mistake but also misguided. The history of the political question doctrine makes clear that the discovery of manageable standards has never controlled the Court 2 ̆ 7 s prior decisions to venture into the field of politics. Further, existing doctrine makes clear that the question of whether politics play an excessive role in redistricting could be easily handled by the Court. Thus the question at the heart of this Article: how to explain the judicial refusal to decide political gerrymandering questions in a world where the Court intervenes just about everywhere else? This Article concludes that the Court, and particularly Justice Kennedy, is worried about an assumed flood of litigation that would follow judicial intervention in this area.
