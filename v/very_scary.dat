25|$|Michaela Conlin as Angela Montenegro: A {{forensic}} {{artist at}} the Jeffersonian Institute and Brennan's best friend, Angela is Brennan's team specialist in forensic facial reconstruction—helping {{to identify the}} victims—and can generate holograms using her three-dimensional graphics program (The Angelator and later The Angelatron) to simulate various virtual scenarios of a crime to help determine cause of death. Angela and Dr. Brennan are best friends and rarely ever argue. She is open, friendly, and caring and constantly tries to draw Brennan out of the lab. Angela's <b>very</b> <b>scary</b> father is played by Billy Gibbons, guitarist of ZZ Top, guest-starring as a fictional version of himself. In season five, she marries co-worker Dr. Jack Hodgins, with whom {{she has a very}} on and off relationship starting from season 2, and gives birth to their son, Michael Vincent, in season six. Her birth name is Pookie Noodlin, as revealed in the tenth season.|$|E
25|$|The {{whole notion}} of {{politics}} is they always present you with this or this or this. I'll get a newspaper to read between the lines. Why {{do you have to}} adhere to prescribed formulas that they have and people argue over them and they're all in a box. And you watch Fox claw CNN, and CNN claw Fox. Sometimes I catch a piece of the news and it seems insanity to me. I quietly support candidates. I'm not out there banging a drum for candidates. But I have supported a candidate and it's a whole other world. Once you've been exposed to it, once or twice or however many times, if you know the facts and see how they're presented, it's mind-boggling. It's a <b>very</b> <b>scary</b> arena to be in, but I do vote. I go in there and pull the lever. It's kind of like pulling the lever and watching the trap door fall out from beneath you. Why should we trust any of these people? None of them ever deliver on anything. It's always disappointing.|$|E
500|$|To play Tracy, Witherspoon {{developed}} a distinct speech pattern combining strident intonations with a chipper Midwestern accent. She also worked on clenching her facial muscles {{and maintaining a}} clipped walking pace. [...] "That was just Tracy, it so escapes me how it came out!" [...] she said. [...] "I just imagined how uptight people carry themselves, and they grind their teeth at night and they clench their jaw because {{everything has to be}} just perfect."

500|$|Unusual filming {{techniques}} were also used. Visual Effects Supervisor John Wash recalls, [...] "We devised a laser effect where a device {{is going into}} his mouth and some other weird lens effects that were going over the scene to give it an alien, other-world-like quality." [...] On the subject of using not only a challengingly minuscule method of filming but also additional sound effects, supervising producer Paul Rabwin recounts, [...] "I had to set up a very, very highly magnified lens to try to get this little device coming right at us. It was very, <b>very</b> <b>scary.</b> We ended up putting some really cool sound effects in there, little servos and motors." ...|$|E
500|$|Taiwanese {{director}} Ang Lee {{was hired}} {{as a result of his}} work in the 1993 family comedy film The Wedding Banquet, which he co-wrote, produced, and directed. He was not familiar with Jane Austen. Doran felt that Lee's films, which depicted complex family relationships amidst a social comedy context, were a good fit with Austen's storylines. She recalled, [...] "The idea of a foreign director was intellectually appealing even though it was <b>very</b> <b>scary</b> to have someone who didn't have English as his first language." [...] The producer sent Lee a copy of Thompson's script, to which he replied that he was [...] "cautiously interested". Fifteen directors were interviewed, but according to Doran, Lee was one of the few who recognised Austen's humour; he told them he wanted the film to [...] "break people's hearts so badly that they'll still be recovering from it two months later." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics responded {{positively}} to [...] "Séance Time", {{with a number}} of them characterising it as genuinely scary. Vicki Power, writing for The Daily Telegraph, described the episode as [...] "clever and chilling", while Julia Raeside and Victoria Segal, writing for The Sunday Times, called it [...] "cleverly executed", and Baylis described it as [...] "a faith-restorer for those who love" [...] television drama. Mark Jones, writing for theguardian.com, called the episode [...] "suitably spooky" [...] and a [...] "fitting end to a second series that has excelled at times", and Chris Bennion, writing for The Independent, similarly described it as a [...] "brilliant series finale". A contrary opinion was offered in a review in the Liverpool Echo; the author called [...] "Séance Time" [...] a [...] "decent enough watch", but felt that it was [...] "a relatively disappointing episode" [...] which was [...] "unable to match what had gone before". Baylis and Bennion stressed that the episode was <b>very</b> <b>scary,</b> with Bennion comparing it to [...] "The Harrowing"; he was complimentary of both, particularly their respective final scenes. Owen also compared the two, but noted that [...] "Séance Time" [...] contains more humour.|$|E

500|$|Themes in {{the series}} often revolve around {{forbidden}} love, such as those involving Bluestar and Oakheart, Graystripe and Silverstream, Leafpool and Crowfeather, and Dovewing and Tigerheart. These relationships are not allowed for various reasons: some involve medicine cats (such as Leafpool), who cannot have mates, while others develop between cats in different Clans, which is forbidden by the warrior code. Holmes said that another central theme of the series centres on [...] "faith and spirituality" [...] in StarClan. [...] All books {{in the series}} feature the influence of StarClan, not just as the cats think of them, {{but in terms of}} prophecies delivered by StarClan which inevitably come true. [...] Some scenes take place within StarClan's realm, with no living cats present as point-of-view characters. [...] Thus the existence of an afterlife and the influence of spirits who have passed on and yet retain their earthly identities is integral to all of the plot arcs in the series. Another idea explored in the novels is the reactions of different faiths when meeting each other. For example, the Tribe of Rushing Water, which believes in different spiritual ancestors than the Clans, is introduced in Moonrise. In an author chat, Holmes explained that the books never say that either of the Clans or the Tribe of Rushing Water is right about faith because both are [...] "equally valid." [...] This leads to fear and suspicion between them because they are afraid of things they do not understand. Holmes said that [...] "ignorance is a <b>very</b> <b>scary</b> thing!" [...] Non-belief is also significant in the storylines: Mothwing and Cloudtail do not believe in StarClan.|$|E
500|$|Lasseter {{was embarrassed}} {{with what was}} on the screen, later recalling, [...] "It was a story filled with the most unhappy, mean {{characters}} that I've ever seen." [...] He asked Disney for the chance to retreat back to Pixar and rework the script in two weeks, and Katzenberg was supportive. Lasseter, Stanton, Docter and Ranft delivered the news of the production shutdown to the production crew, many of whom had left other jobs to work on the project. In the meantime, the crew would shift to television commercials while the head writers worked out a new script. Although Lasseter kept morale high by remaining outwardly buoyant, the production shutdown was [...] "a <b>very</b> <b>scary</b> time," [...] recalled story department manager BZ Petroff. Schneider had initially wanted to shut down production altogether and fire all recently hired animators. Katzenberg put the film under the wing of Walt Disney Feature Animation. The Pixar team was pleased that the move would give them an open door to counseling from Disney's animation veterans. Schneider, however, continued to take a dim view of the project and would later go over Katzenberg's head to urge Eisner to cancel it. Stanton retreated into a small, dark, windowless office, emerging periodically with new script pages. He and the other story artists would then draw the shots on storyboards. Whedon came back to Pixar for part of the shutdown to help with revising, and the script was revised in two weeks as promised. When Katzenberg and Schneider halted production on Toy Story, Steve Jobs kept the work going with his own personal funding. Jobs did not insert himself much into the creative process, respecting the artists at Pixar and instead managing the relationship with Disney.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} overwhelmingly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode {{a score of}} 9.5 out of 10, a series high alongside [...] "Chuck Versus the Colonel", Season 3's [...] "Chuck Versus the Beard" [...] and [...] "Chuck Versus the Subway", Season 4's [...] "Chuck Versus the Cliffhanger", and Season 5's [...] "Chuck Versus the Kept Man" [...] and [...] "Chuck Versus the Goodbye". Goldman described the episode as an [...] "especially strong installment, which delivered {{on a lot of}} fronts." [...] Goldman praised the scene depicting Sarah and Mauser's confrontation, writing, [...] "The entire ambience of the scene was terrific – a rainy night at a Christmas tree lot, with Chuck secretly watching as Sarah shot the unarmed, surrendering Mauser in cold blood - to the tune of 'Silent Night', no less. Of course she did this because she loves Chuck and wants to protect him, but all Chuck knows is that he just saw Sarah in a <b>very</b> <b>scary</b> light, and it's a great new dynamic to their relationship." [...] HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall wrote, [...] "Chuck vs. Santa Claus" [...] was moving along amusingly enough when it still seemed like Ned Rhyerson was just a hapless criminal with the bad luck to crash into a store built above a top-secret government intelligence facility, but the surprising left turn it took when Chuck flashed on Lt. Mauser took things to another level." [...] Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A-, writing [...] "Santa Claus certainly delivered (character) goodies to everyone tonight. Morgan gets to be a hero, even if no one notices, taking down Ned with a fake snow machine. Jeff calls his mother–in prison–then finds the time to break up a mistletoe makeout session. Lester sneaks a smooch from Anna, and isn't even remotely fazed when it causes her to run for the hills. And Big Mike's embrace of cousin Big Al is a keeper." ...|$|E

5000|$|The game {{received}} generally mediocre reviews. Mike Weigand of Electronic Gaming Monthly {{commented on}} the game that [...] "the graphics are quite good, but the overall theme of the game isn't <b>very</b> thrilling". <b>Scary</b> Larry of GamePro agreed that the game was dull, remarking [...] "There's not much else to do here but shoot and steer", and disagreed on the graphics, citing muddy colors {{and a lack of}} detail. Next Generation saw a somewhat more positive review for the game. It said the game was technically impressive for its fluid animation and near-absence of load times, and though it criticized the lack of variety in the levels, it concluded, [...] "However, on balance, it's smooth, fast and exciting, and what more could you ask for?" ...|$|R
50|$|Christopher Livingston from PC Gamer {{gave it a}} mixed review, {{praising the}} {{survival}} portions of the game, tense and often exciting atmosphere, satisfying stealth, exciting action sequences, {{as well as the}} nicely detailed environment, but criticizing the recycled, and <b>very</b> often, not <b>scary</b> bosses, poor character models, late texture pop-ins, sluggish control, frustrating camera angles, limited video options and poor decision on the aspect ratio. He stated that all these technical issues has dragged The Evil Within from enjoyably challenging to needlessly frustrating.|$|R
500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of the segment Bender stated, [...] "The big climactic cave sequence was hugely complex, and although it's <b>very</b> <b>scary</b> that this really terrifying thing is happening to our characters, {{at the end of the}} day I think the emotion from what we are experiencing is hopefully going to be the shock that people will stay with," [...] referring to Hodor's implied death. In an interview with Kristian Nairn (Hodor), he described filming the scene, [...] "It was a really heavy day — you’ve got these 100-mile-per-hour winds being blown into your face with false snow. I was really holding the door — there were like eight people pushing from the other side and I was really holding them back. It’s definitely Method acting. It was a very intense day but one of the nice things was they let Isaac wrap me. He got to come over and say [...] "Mr. Nairn, that’s a wrap." [...] It was very emotional. It’s always been a little group of us together and it felt like our little group was breaking up." [...] Ellie Kendrick (Meera Reed) spoke about the filming of her part of the sequence, saying [...] "A lot of what's happening in that scene, in Meera's head, comes down to adrenaline. There's just no way she can stop and consider logically what's happening. If you have an army of the undead chasing after you, you're only going to be thinking one thing: [...] "Run!" [...] It was interesting, having the challenge of creating that adrenaline and fear and sadness of Hodor, but not being able to process it at all. Having to recreate that feeling of immediacy, in a stuffy studio at 4 p.m. on a Thursday when you've been filming the same scene for a couple of days, it was difficult. But it was an exciting challenge, to constantly inject the energy those characters must be feeling in that moment." ...|$|E
2500|$|To Rowling, a diary is a <b>very</b> <b>scary</b> object, {{having said}} in an interview: [...] "The temptation {{particularly}} for a young girl, is to pour out her heart to a diary." [...] Rowling's little sister Diane was prone to this, and her great fear was that someone would read her diary. This gave Rowling the idea to have a diary that is, in itself, against the confider. When asked {{what would have happened}} if Ginny had died and Riddle had managed to escape, Rowling revealed that [...] "it would have strengthened the present-day Voldemort considerably." ...|$|E
2500|$|SHAC 7, six {{animal rights}} activists, who {{were found guilty}} of using their website to incite threats, harassment, {{vandalism}} and attacks against the company Huntingdon Life Sciences and their business partners. Originally seven individuals were charged, leading sympathizers to describe the defendants as the SHAC 7, but the case {{against one of the}} defendants was dropped. Pamelyn Ferdin, the current president of SHAC USA, told the jury that [...] "for the government to say you can't say this and you can't say that is going down a <b>very</b> <b>scary</b> path of going toward fascism." [...] However, the US Attorney's Office described the convicts as [...] "thugs who went far beyond protected speech and lawful protest to engage in and incite intimidation, harassment and violence."

2500|$|Its {{emphasis}} on horror was praised. Jim Sterling of Destructoid wrote that ZombiU zombies were intimidating {{by comparison with}} other zombie games. Sterling called it an [...] "oppressive" [...] experience, since players were diverted by the GamePad while the game continued in real time. This was echoed by Rich Stanton of Eurogamer, who thought that the system made the game experience scarier. According to Stanton, {{it was one of}} the few zombie titles which lived up to the phrase [...] "survival horror". Hollander Cooper of GamesRadar agreed, saying that ZombiU [...] " [...] in on the 'survival' part of the 'survival horror' genre better than any release in recent memory".

Richard Mitchell of Joystiq praised its atmosphere, which he compared favourably with [...] Chris Schilling of VideoGamer.com agreed, calling its atmosphere [...] "authentic" [...] and [...] "rich".

2500|$|Film critics James Berardinelli and Roger Ebert each awarded it 3.5 stars out of {{a maximum}} of 4 stars.

For extended periods here, nothing at all is happening, and believe me, you won't be bored." [...] Entertainment Weekly critic Owen Gleiberman gave Paranormal Activity an A− rating and called it [...] "frightening...freaky and terrifying" [...] and said that [...] "Paranormal Activity scrapes away 30 years of encrusted nightmare clichés." [...] Bloody Disgusting ranked the film 16th in their list of the [...] "Top 20 Horror Films of the Decade", with the article saying, [...] "Peli deserves props for milking the maximum amount of tension out of the spare, modern setting—an ordinary, cookie-cutter tract home in San Diego.
