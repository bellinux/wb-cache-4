In {{assessing}} whether policies fall foul of this rule, a court cannot reject {{the way in which}} an administrative body formulated a policy in favour of its own <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> the discretion should have been exercised.

Goldman to the eponymous Goldman equation in 1943. The sodium–potassium pump was identified in 1957 and its properties gradually elucidated, culminating in the determination of its atomic-resolution structure by X-ray crystallography. The crystal structures of related ionic pumps have also been solved, giving a broader <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> these molecular machines work.|$|E
25|$|In {{considering}} unreasonableness in the Wednesbury sense, {{the court}} is not entitled to substitute its <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> the discretion should be exercised for what was actually done, nor is unreasonableness established if the court merely comes {{to the view that}} such a policy or guideline may not work effectively as another, since {{the court is}} not exercising an appellate function in respect of administrative decisions. The applicant has the burden of proving that the policy or guideline is illegal or ultra vires.|$|E
25|$|Before the 20th century, {{linguists}} analysed {{language on}} a diachronic plane, which was historical in focus. This {{meant that they}} would compare linguistic features and try to analyse language {{from the point of}} <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> it had changed between then and later. However, with Saussurean linguistics in the 20th century, the focus shifted to a more synchronic approach, where the study was more geared towards analysis and comparison between different language variations, which existed at the same given point of time.|$|E

25|$|However, Rana's {{formal and}} {{conceptual}} departure from this traditional style and medium is distinctly his own. The stark contrast of the Muslim {{women in their}} traditional dress with the exposed nudity of the Western porn stars forces a powerful shift in focus between the poles of these two stereotypes and alludes to the great cultural divide between East and West. Fascinated by how meaning is often misunderstood in our media-oriented society, Rana's photographic practice cleverly creates images that offer an alternative <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> popular ideas and prejudices are created.|$|E
25|$|The novel {{opens with}} Alhambra telling us of her {{conception}} in ‘the town’s only cinema’. We then come to “The Beginning”, {{which consists of}} a third-person narration focused first on Astrid, then Magnus, then Michael, then finally Eve. Through each character we obtain a different <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> Amber came into their lives, and who they believed her to be, when she arrived unannounced and uninvited at their Norfolk holiday home, claiming her car had broken down. Through “The Beginning”, we learn of Astrid’s obsession with video-taping her life, seemingly as proof it existed; of Magnus’ involvement in a school prank {{which resulted in the}} suicide of one of his classmates; of Michael’s affairs with his students (he is a university lecturer); and of Eve’s writer’s block.|$|E
25|$|In the {{academic}} world, plagiarism by students is usually considered {{a very serious}} offense that can result in punishments such as a failing grade on the particular assignment, the entire course, or even being expelled from the institution. Generally, the punishment increases as a person enters higher institutions of learning. The seriousness with which academic institutions address student plagiarism may be tempered by a recognition that students may not fully understand what plagiarism is. A 2015 study showed that students who were new to university study {{did not have a}} good understanding of even the basic requirements of how to attribute sources in written academic work, yet students were very confident that they understood what referencing and plagiarism are. The same students also had a lenient <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> plagiarism should be penalised.|$|E

25|$|The {{influence}} of Sun Ra {{can be seen}} throughout many aspects of black music. He grounded his practice of Afrofuturism in a musical tradition of performing blackness that remains relevant today. Sun Ra lived out his beliefs of Afrofuturism in his daily life by embodying the movement not only in his music, but also in his clothes and actions. This embodiment of the narrative allowed him to demonstrate black nationalism as a counternarrative to the present culture. It was in Chicago, as well, in the mid-fifties, that Ra began experimenting with extraterrestriality in his stage show, sometimes playing regular cocktail lounges dressed in space suits and ancient Egyptian regalia. By placing his band and performances in space and extraterrestrial environments Sun Ra built a world that was his own <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> the African diaspora connected.|$|E
25|$|In the 20th century, {{however, the}} Dutch colonial policy towards the East Indies changed and {{moved from the}} liberalist to neoliberalist point of <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> to deal with {{imperial}} possessions. The trend showed the desire to guard {{the rights of the}} natives and implement a better protection of colonies against outside threat. With this idea, the Netherlands began a program of greater integration in the Dutch East Indies. It was based primarily on the humanitarian idea of offering help and guidance to achieve peace and order. This was due to the assumption that subjects of the empire were not mature enough to build their own state or politics, and the mother country felt the obligation to educate them in the sphere and set an example. The new policy was called Assimilation and aimed to create a unity between Eastern and Western Dutchmen. The new harmony would be joined politically and nationally disregarding racial differences which could not weaken it. This however would mean the granting of political autonomy to the dependent Indonesia, something {{that a large number of}} Dutchmen did not agree with primarily because of economic reasons. This cultural and national synthesis was never realized in as much as strong nationalistic feelings in the Dutch East Indies, and European affairs soon ripped the plan apart.|$|E

[...] Coldwell excitedly reported this to some of the CCF's Alberta leaders; one of them telephoned Brownlee to question whether Coldwell's report was true. [...] Brownlee adhered to a conservative <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> politics should be conducted, and was perhaps put off by the audacious telephone call; despite an apology from Coldwell, Brownlee did not indicate any further interest in running for the CCF.|$|E

500|$|A {{wind rose}} is a graphic tool used by meteorologists {{to give a}} succinct <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> wind speed and {{direction}} are typically distributed at a particular location. [...] Presented in a polar coordinate grid, the wind rose shows the frequency of winds blowing from particular directions. [...] The length of each spoke around the circle {{is related to the}} frequency that the wind blows from a particular direction per unit time. [...] Each concentric circle represents a different frequency, emanating from zero at the center to increasing frequencies at the outer circles. A wind rose plot may contain additional information, in that each spoke is broken down into color-coded bands that show wind direction ranges. [...] Wind roses typically use 8 or 16 cardinal directions, such as north (N), NNE, NE, etc., although they may be subdivided into as many as 32 directions.|$|E
500|$|The dating {{framework}} {{provided by}} radiocarbon {{led to a}} change in the prevailing <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> innovations spread through prehistoric Europe. Researchers had previously thought that many ideas spread by diffusion through the continent, or by invasions of peoples bringing new cultural ideas with them. As radiocarbon dates began to prove these ideas wrong in many instances, it became apparent that these innovations must sometimes have arisen locally. This {{has been described as a}} [...] "second radiocarbon revolution", and with regard to British prehistory, archaeologist Richard Atkinson has characterized the impact of radiocarbon dating as [...] "radical... therapy" [...] for the [...] "progressive disease of invasionism". More broadly, the success of radiocarbon dating stimulated interest in analytical and statistical approaches to archaeological data. [...] Taylor has also described the impact of AMS, and the ability to obtain accurate measurements from very small samples, as ushering in a third radiocarbon revolution.|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{the early}} years of the Cultural Revolution, the CRG acted as a body that {{directed}} the course the movement should take.

[...] For example, after the Wuhan Incident, Jiang Qing suggested in a speech that the Red Guards should 'defend with weapons', leading to a surge in the seizure of PLA armaments by rebel groups. [...] In addition, Wang Li and other CRG radicals (taking their cue from Jiang Qing) called for the removal of 'revisionist' elements in the PLA. [...] The radical CRG, however, often found it had to contend with the more conservative <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>how</b> the Cultural Revolution should progress promoted by Zhou Enlai and his supporters, who were as interested in stability and the maintenance of some form of government as they were in revolution.|$|E
