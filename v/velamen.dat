He gathered all Teutonic heroes of every tribe, {{as well as his}} own; and through Roumelia, and through the Alps, a long and dangerous journey, went Dietrich and his Goths, with their wives and children, and all they had, packed on waggons; living on their flocks and herds, grinding their corn in hand- mills, and hunting as they went, for seven hundred miles of march; fighting as they went with Bulgars and Sarmatians, who had swarmed into the waste marches of Hungary and Carniola, once populous, cultivated, and full of noble cities; fighting a desperate battle with the Gepidae, up to their knees in a morass; till over the passes of the Julian Alps, where icicles hung upon their beards, and their clothes cracked with frost, they poured into the Venetian plains. It was a daring deed; and needed a spirit like Dietrich's to carry it through.|$|E
60|$|When the Roman Emperors grew very vain and luxurious, {{they used}} to have this sand made {{ornamental}} with metallic filings, vermilion, and even powdered precious stones; but it was thought better taste to use the scrapings of a soft white stone, which, when thickly strewn, made the whole arena look as if covered with untrodden snow. Around the border of this space flowed a stream of fresh water. Then came a straight wall, rising to a considerable height, and surmounted by a broad platform, on which stood a throne for the Emperor, curule chairs of ivory and gold for the chief magistrates and senators, and seats for the vestal virgins. Next above were galleries for the equestrian order, the great mass of those who considered themselves as of gentle station, though not of the highest rank; farther up, and therefore farther back, were the galleries belonging to the freemen of Rome; and these were again surmounted by another plain wall with a platform on the top, where were places for the ladies, who were not (except the vestal virgins) allowed to look on nearer, because of the unclothed state of some of the performers in the arena. Between the ladies' boxes, benches were squeezed in where the lowest people could seat themselves; and some of these likewise found room in the two uppermost tiers of porticoes, where sailors, mechanics, and persons {{in the service of the}} Coliseum had their post. Altogether, when full, this huge building held no less than 87,000 spectators. It had no roof; but when there was rain, or if the sun was too hot, the sailors in the porticoes unfurled awnings that ran along upon ropes, and formed a covering of silk and gold tissue over the whole. Purple was the favorite color for this <b>velamen,</b> or veil; because, when the sun shone through it, it cast such beautiful rosy tints on the snowy arena and the white purple-edged togas of the Roman citizens.|$|E

Physiological data collected shows a significantly higher root hydraulic conductance for species with more <b>velamen</b> layers (Dendrobium and Oncidium). Across all species, the embedded roots had a significantly higher root hydraulic conductance than aerial roots. Root anatomy of embedded roots showed the formation of root hairs as a result of substrate contact, allowing for more efficient water uptake.

Abstract: General Pleurothallidinae morphology {{has been}} well described, but the current lack of anatomical works reflects the wide gap in interpretation of the synapomorphies, even more evident {{when it comes to}} representatives of Brazilian rich flora, with high degree of endemism. Thus, continuing the work of descriptive, this study examined the root anatomy of 56 species in 11 genera of the subtribe Pleurothallidinae (Orchidaceae), under light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, in order to identify diagnostic characters {{that could be used to}} distinguishing the genera and species, aiding future work of taxonomy and systematics of the group. The genera are distinguished primarily by the velamen/exodermis complex and central cilinder characteristics. Acianthera presents bistratified <b>velamen</b> with "U"-shaped thickening in epivelamen, "O" and inverted "U"-shaped thickening exodermis, and sclerified or parenchymatous pitch.

Echinosepala presents pluristratified <b>velamen</b> with up to four layers with anastomosed thickening, "O"-shaped thickening exodermis, and parenchymatous pitch. Masdevallia presents pluristratified <b>velamen</b> with up to six layers with perforated walls, thin walled exodermis, and sclerified pitch.

40|$|Considering {{that the}} root {{structure}} of the Brazilian genera belonging to the Catasetinae subtribe is poorly known, we describe the roots of twelve representatives from this subtribe. For anatomical analysis, the roots were fixed in FAA 50, preserved in ethanol 70 % and sectioned at its medium region using razor blades. The sections were stained with 0. 05 % astra blue and safranin and mounted in glycerin. For the identification of starch we used Lugol ́s solution; for lignin, floroglucin chloridric; for lipids, Sudan III, and for flavanoids, potassium hydroxide.

40|$|The {{survival}} of plants in epiphytic environments depends on vegetative adaptations capable to defraud different stresses. Based on the structural {{diversity of the}} Orchidaceae, the current study has the objective of relating the anatomical structure of Dichaea cogniauxiana and Epidendrum secundum with the distinct environments where they live. It was expected that, despite structural similarities as strategies for resource acquisition, some peculiar variations related to the distinct light microenvironments (inside or in {{the edge of the}} nebular forest, near to “campo rupestre” area) might be found. Leaves and roots of both species were collected in a nebular forest located at a “campo rupestre” area at Serra da Piedade, Brazil), in January and February 2005. D. cogniauxiana is adhered to trunks, in sites with high atmospheric humidity and shaded, while E. secundum is located {{at the edge of the}} nebular forest, in more luminous sites. The leaves of E. secundum had thicker cuticle and higher number of stomata per area than those of D. cogniauxiana, characteristics coherent with their distinct pattern of exhibition to sun light. The suprastomatic chambers formed by the thicker cuticle may function as a barrier of resistance to water evaporation. The succulence of the leaves of E. secundum propitiates organic acids storage at night, and the storage of starch may be involved in PEP-carboxylase metabolism, both propitiating CAM mechanism. Roots with larger number of cell layers of the <b>velamen,</b> and specialized thick walled cortical cells (both in E. secundum) help water absorption and indicate better adaptation to an environment with intense solar radiation and a probable higher water deficit. The remarkable cell wall thickening of E. secundum exodermis can confer more efficient protection against the excess of transpiration at the border of the nebular forest. On the other hand, besides D. cogniauxiana be epiphyte, it is in a low position - in a shaded environment and with high relative humidity. Its thin thickened <b>velamen</b> permits the entrance of the low available light, and photosynthesis, producing oxygen and helping to avoid hypoxia condition. As features registered for D. cogniauxiana and E. secundum roots, we can depict the <b>velamen,</b> distinct exodermis and endodermis, and specialized thick walled cortical cells as characteristic of epiphytic plants...|$|E

The anatomical investigation revealed that leaves of E. radicans have a thick cuticle (3 – 4 µm) and paracytic type of stomata. Foliar epidermal cells are conical on the adaxial surface and rectangular in the abaxial surface, distinct hypodermis absent, and uniseriate fiber bundles are arranged in {{both sides of the}} leaves. The foliar mesophyll is homogenous and starch grains and raphides present. The leaf sheath covering the stem have cuticle restricted to the outer surface and air spaces are present. The stem has a cuticulerized uniseriate epidermis and a uniseriate hypodermis. The cortex and a parenchymatous ground tissue of the stem are separated by a layer of sclerenchymatous band.

The species studied were collected at the Portal da Amaz&# 244;nia region, Mato Grosso state, Brazil. The roots were fixed in FAA 50, cut freehand, and stained with astra blue/fuchsin. Illustrations were obtained with a digital camera mounted on a photomicroscope. The roots of examined species shared most of the anatomical characteristics observed in other species of the Catasetum genus, and many of them have adaptations to the epiphytic habit, such as presence of secondary thickening in the <b>velamen</b> cell walls, exodermis, cortex, and medulla. Some specific features were recognized as having taxonomic application, such as composition of the thickening of <b>velamen</b> cell walls, ornamentation of absorbent root-hair walls, presence of tilosomes, composition and thickening of the cortical cell walls, presence of mycorrhizae, endodermal cell wall thickening, the number of protoxylem poles, and composition and thickening of the central area of the vascular cylinder.

Estruturas anatômicas como: número de camadas e tipo de espessamento das paredes das células do velame, tipo de espessamento de parede da exoderme e endoderme, presença de idioblastos contendo cristais e número de pólos de protoxilema agrupam as espécies nos diferentes gêneros e subfamílias. A presença de canais de mucilagem no córtex de A. castelnavii relatados pela primeira vez na literatura para Bromeliaceae é caráter diagnóstico. As raízes de Dyckia e Tillandsia apresentam maior número de caracteres comuns, representando maior similaridade entre Pitcairnioideae e Tillandsioideae. Raízes com velame, exoderme com células de paredes espessadas constituindo uma camada mecânica, canais de mucilagem, lacunas de ar no córtex interno e idioblastos com cristais são estruturas adaptativas ao hábito epifítico. This study {{aimed to}} characterize the roots of Bromeliaceae, Aechmea bromeliifolia, A. castelnavii, A. mertensii (Bromelioideae), Dyckia duckei, D. paraensis, D. racemosa (Pitcairnoideae), Tillandsia adpressiflora, T. didistachae and T. paraensis (Tillandsioideae), that occur in Amazonian regions (Mato Grosso-MT), {{in order to find}} features of taxonomic value and ecological importance. The studied species are epiphytes and their roots are characterized by a multi-layered <b>velamen,</b> differentiated cortex, uniseriate endodermis and pericycle, polyarch vascular cylinder and medulla with thickened cell walls. Anatomical structures, such as the number of layers and kind of cell wall thickening of the <b>velamen,</b> the kind of thickening of the exodermis and endodermis walls, the presence of idioblasts containing crystals and the number of protoxylem poles help seperate these species within different genera and subfamilies. The presence of mucilage canals in the cortex of A. castelnavii is a diagnostic feature. The roots of Dyckia and Tillandsia share more common features, so there is greater similarity between Pitcairnioideae and Tillandsioideae. Roots with <b>velamen,</b> an exodermis with thickened cell walls constituting a mechanical layer, mucilage canals, air gaps in the inner cortex and idioblasts with crystals are structures adapted to the epiphytic habit...|$|E
40|$|Interactions {{between an}} isolate of dark septate endophytes (DSE) and roots of Dendrobium nobile Lindl. {{seedlings}} {{are reported in}} this paper. The isolate was obtained from orchid mycorrhizas on Dendrobium sp. in subtropical forest. The fungus formed typical orchidmycorrhiza in aseptic co-culture withD. nobile seedlings onmodifiedMurashige-Skoog (MMS) medium. Anatomic observations of the infected roots showed that the DSE hyphae invaded the <b>velamen</b> layer, passed through passage cells in exodermis, entered the cortex cells, and then formed fungal pelotons of orchid mycorrhiza. D. nobile seedlings ’ plant height, stem diameter, new roots number and biomass were greatly enhanced by inoculating the fungus to seedlings. The fungus was identified as Leptodontidium by sequencing the polymerase chain reaction-amplified rDNA ITS 1 - 5. 8 S-ITS 2 (internal transcribed spacer (ITS)) regions and comparison with similar taxa...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSeeds and {{seedlings}} of neotropical Laeliinae species (Cattleya loddigesii, Cattleya tigrina, Hadrolaelia purpurata, Laelia anceps, Schomburgkia gloriosa, and Sophronitis cernua) were studied. The {{seed germination}} {{process and the}} seedling grown in vitro are described. Seeds of the studied species are unitegmic and have conspicuous thickening in the anticlinal and inner periclinal cell walls. The embryo consists of a relatively long and multicellular suspensor. At first stage of seedling development, the embryo differentiates into a protocorm with rhizoids and meristematic tissue. The budding occurs on the protocorms. The endogenous taproot is produced after the first leaves have emerged. The root is triarch or tetrarch and it possesses <b>velamen.</b> Structural characters related to seed coat, suspensor, ontogeny of leaves, and vascular system of the root are significant indicators for the separation of Laeliinae species...|$|E
