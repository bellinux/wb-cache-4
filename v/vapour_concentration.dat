40|$|Stratospheric {{water vapour}} is a {{powerful}} greenhouse gas. The longest available record from balloon observations over Boulder, Colorado, USA shows increases in stratospheric water <b>vapour</b> <b>concentrations</b> that cannot be fully explained by observed changes in the main drivers, tropical tropopause temperatures and methane. Satellite observations could help resolve the issue, but constructing a reliable long-term data record from individual short satellite records is challenging. Here we present an approach to merge satellite data sets {{with the help of}} a chemistry-climate model nudged to observed meteorology. We use the models' water vapour as a transfer function between data sets that overcomes issues arising from instrument drift and short overlap periods. In the lower stratosphere, our water vapour record extends back to 1988 and water <b>vapour</b> <b>concentrations</b> largely follow tropical tropopause temperatures. Lower and mid-stratospheric long-term trends are negative, and the trends from Boulder are shown not to be globally representative. In the upper stratosphere, our record extends back to 1986 and shows positive long-term trends. The altitudinal differences in the trends are explained by methane oxidation together with a strengthened lower-stratospheric and a weakened upper-stratospheric circulation inferred by this analysis. Our results call into question previous estimates of surface radiative forcing based on presumed global long-term increases in water <b>vapour</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the lower stratosphere...|$|R
50|$|Marram grass has a rolled leaf {{that creates}} a {{localized}} environment of water <b>vapour</b> <b>concentration</b> within the leaf, and helps to prevent water loss. The stomata sit in small pits within the curls of the structure, which make them less likely to open and to lose water. The folded leaves have hairs on the inside to slow or stop air movement, much like many other xerophytes (though these are typically found {{on the outside of}} the plant, but in marram grass they are also within the leaf as this has now become a structure with more volume). This slowing of air movement once again reduces the amount of water vapour being lost. A waxy cuticle on the leaf surface also prevents evaporation.|$|E

Although {{a significant number of}} analyses are available for modelling of droplet vaporization in a fluidized bed, very little work has been performed experimentally to measure the <b>vapour</b> <b>concentration</b> followed by numerical validation. In the present work, acetone droplet evaporation in a bubbling fluidized bed is studied experimentally as well as numerically. A liquid jet of acetone is injected into a hot bubbling fluidized bed kept well above saturation temperature of acetone. Non-intrusive Schlieren imaging, based on the difference in refractive index, is used to trace the acetone <b>vapour</b> <b>concentration</b> profile. The bubbling fluidized bed is modelled in an Eulerian framework using a simplistic porous media approach while the droplets are modelled in a Lagrangian framework.

40|$|Masters Research - Master of Philosophy (MPhil) Brown rot {{caused by}} Monilinia fructicola {{is a major}} postharvest fungal disease in stone fruit. The need to control this disease has led to {{considerable}} reliance on synthetic fungicides. The use of these products has raised concerns related to pathogen-resistance and chemical residues on food products, creating demand for alternative control methods. Essential oils, which have long been generally recognised as safe for human use, {{are known for their}} antifungal properties. This project focuses on the postharvest application of lemon myrtle essential oil vapour to control brown rot on stone fruit. Sets of 20 fruit in 3 replicates were exposed to three different concentrations of lemon myrtle essential oil vapour in air; 25, 000 ppm; 30, 000 ppm and 40, 000 ppm, by placing each set within closed plastic containers with small fans to circulate the vapour during fumigations at 20 oC and 25 oC. Nectarines which were exposed to lemon myrtle oil vapour from 4 to 16 hours developed phytotoxic symptoms, while the minimum effective treatment times were 2 hour fumigations. Exposing ‘Diamond Bright’ nectarine and ‘Tam Hoa’ plum to lemon myrtle oil <b>vapour</b> <b>concentrations</b> of 25, 000 ppm, 30, 000 ppm and 40, 000 ppm at 20 oC and 25 oC for 2 hours significantly inhibited the growth of postharvest brown rot on artificially infected fruit. Phytotoxicity generally appeared as a result of concomitant high temperatures during treatment and high <b>vapour</b> <b>concentrations.</b> However, ‘Red Gold’ nectarines were most sensitive to lemon myrtle oil, with higher temperature treatments found to cause phytotoxicity in this variety even at lower <b>vapour</b> <b>concentrations.</b> Thus lower levels of lemon myrtle essential oil vapour are shown to be more active and toxic when treatment temperatures are increased from 20 oC to 25 oC. The experiment successfully established maximum tolerable oil <b>vapour</b> <b>concentrations,</b> treatment times and temperatures, which if exceeded could cause phytotoxicity. Thus the research usefully expands upon previous in vitro studies of essential oils as fungicides by investigating the balance between pathogen treatment and the need to protect fruit from phytotoxic damage, to maximise saleable stone fruit produce. This research further explains the different sensitivities of the diverse varieties tested...|$|R

40|$|Mesospheric water <b>vapour</b> <b>concentration</b> {{effects on}} the ion {{composition}} and electron density in the lower ionosphere under quiet geophysical conditions were examined. Water vapour is an important compound in the mesosphere and the lower thermosphere that affects ion composition due to hydrogen radical production and consequently modifies the electron number density. Recent lower-ionosphere investigations have primarily concentrated on the geomagnetic disturbance periods. Meanwhile, studies on the electron density under quiet conditions are quite rare. The goal {{of this study is}} to contribute to a better understanding of the ionospheric parameter responses to water vapour variability in the quiet lower ionosphere. By applying a numerical D region ion chemistry model, we evaluated efficiencies for the channels forming hydrated cluster ions from the NO + and O 2 + primary ions (i. e. NO +. H 2 O and O 2 +. H 2 O, respectively), and the channel forming H + (H 2 O) n proton hydrates from water clusters at different altitudes using profiles with low and high water vapour concentrations. Profiles for positive ions, effective recombination coefficients and electrons were modelled for three particular cases using electron density measurements obtained during rocket campaigns. It was found that the water <b>vapour</b> <b>concentration</b> variations in the mesosphere affect the position of both the Cl 2 + proton hydrate layer upper border, comprising the NO + (H 2 O) n and O 2 + (H 2 O) n hydrated cluster ions, and the Cl 1 + hydrate cluster layer lower border, comprising the H + (H 2 O) n pure proton hydrates, as well as the numerical cluster densities. The water variations caused large changes in the effective recombination coefficient and electron density between altitudes of 75 and 87 km. However, the effective recombination coefficient, α eff, and electron number density did not respond even to large water <b>vapour</b> <b>concentration</b> variations occurring at other altitudes in the mesosphere. We determined the water <b>vapour</b> <b>concentration</b> upper limit at altitudes between 75 and 87 km, beyond which the water <b>vapour</b> <b>concentration</b> ceases to influence the numerical densities of Cl 2 + and Cl 1 +, the effective recombination coefficient and the electron number density in the summer ionosphere. This water <b>vapour</b> <b>concentration</b> limit corresponds to values found in the H 2 O- 1 profile that was observed in the summer mesosphere by the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS). The electron density modelled using the H 2 O- 1 profile agreed well with the electron density measured in the summer ionosphere when the measured profiles did not have sharp gradients. For sharp gradients in electron and positive ion number densities, a water profile that can reproduce the characteristic behaviour of the ionospheric parameters should have an inhomogeneous height distribution of water vapour...|$|E

Despite the care taken in machine design to lessen the release of solvent vapours and heat into the working environ-ment, it is prudent to assess these if staff complain of ill-effects. The present study arose from a request by a package printing firm in 1970 to investigate complaints of excessive fatigue during hot weather, and occasional eye and respiratory irritation attributed by some of the staff to solvent vapours. Thermal conditions were considered sufficiently intolerable during one hot spell in the summer of 1970 for work to stop when the ambient temperature rose above 30 °C.

In particular, the dynamic relationship between these two variables is remarkably linear and can be resolved in terms of two parallel, first-order, subsystems; a model which complements the results of Cowan (1977) for cotton.

The surface in our PE control simulation is on average 297 K warm and ice-free, despite a moderate atmospheric CO 2 concentration of 560 ppm. Compared to a pre-industrial reference simulation (PR), low latitudes are 5 to 8 K warmer, while high latitudes {{are up to}} 40 K warmer. This high-latitude amplification {{is in line with}} proxy data, yet a comparison to sea surface temperature proxy data suggests that the Arctic surface temperatures are still too low in our PE simulation. To identify the mechanisms that cause the PE-PR surface temperature differences, we fit two simple energy balance models to the ECHAM 5 /MPI-OM results. We find that about 2 / 3 of the PE-PR global mean surface temperature difference are caused by a smaller clear sky emissivity due to higher atmospheric CO 2 and water <b>vapour</b> <b>concentrations</b> in PE compared to PR; 1 / 3 is due to a smaller planetary albedo. The reduction of the pole-to-equator temperature gradient in PE compared to PR is due to (1) the large high-latitude effect of the higher CO 2 and water <b>vapour</b> <b>concentrations</b> in PE compared to PR, (2) the lower Antarctic orography, (3) the smaller surface albedo at high latitudes, and (4) longwave cloud radiative effects.
