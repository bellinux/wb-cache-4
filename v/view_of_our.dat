500|$|There are two {{different}} music videos for [...] "American Life", {{the first of which}} was not released by Madonna. It was shot {{in the first week of}} February 2003 at Los Angeles Center Studios in Los Angeles, California by Swedish director Jonas Åkerlund, who worked with Madonna in the videos for [...] "Ray of Light" [...] (1998) and [...] "Music" [...] (2000). Madonna had the idea for the music video in November 2002, then she and Åkerlund developed the idea to make an anti-war and anti-fashion mini-movie. With [...] "American Life", she took her music videos to a different level by focusing on war, politics and, according to media interpretation, the then-upcoming invasion of Iraq. [...] "It is an antiwar statement..." [...] she subsequently clarified, [...] "but it's not necessarily against this war. At any given moment there's at least 30 wars going on in this world and I'm against all of them." [...] Shortly after it was filmed, Warner Bros. Records released a statement regarding the music video: [...] " [...] expresses a panoramic <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> culture and looming war through the view of a female superhero portrayed by Madonna. Starting as a runway show of couture army fatigues, the fashion show escalates into a mad frenzy depicting the catastrophic repercussions and horrors of war." [...] An exclusive sneak peek of the video was available on VH1's program Backstage at the Grammys.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we extend de Nicola and Hennessy’s testing theory {{to deal with}} probabilities. We say that two {{processes}} are testing equivalent if the probabilities with which they pass any test are equal. We present three alternative semantic <b>views</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> testing equivalence. First, we introduce adequate extensions of acceptance sets (inducing an operational characterization) and acceptance trees (inducing a denotational semantics). We also present a sound and complete axiomatization <b>of</b> <b>our</b> testing equivalence. So, this paper represents a complete study of the adaptation of the classical testing theory for probabilistic processes...|$|R
