5|$|Crystal Tools is {{a unified}} game engine by Japanese {{developer}} and publisher Square Enix that combines standard libraries for graphics rendering, physics processing, motion control, cinematics, visual effects, sound, artificial intelligence and networking. Its target systems are the PlayStation 3, the Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows and the Wii. On the development side, the engine {{takes the form}} of various authoring tools focused on large-scale game projects. It encompasses a character viewer for 3D models, an effects and a cutscene editor, a previsualization tool, and a sound maker. Usage of the third-party programs Autodesk Maya, Autodesk Softimage and Adobe Photoshop is supported via plug-ins. The individual authoring tools are connected over a communications server called GRAPE2 which reads all the different data formats, processes them and gives an instant preview of the final game. The engine is highly customizable and can be expanded with new functions and tools should the need for them arise. Although Crystal Tools allows for easier cross-platform development, the differences in the target systems' <b>video</b> <b>memory</b> and microarchitecture still necessitate fine-tuning adjustments in the games, for example concerning texture sizes.|$|E
25|$|A framebuffer is {{a digital}} device for {{computers}} which stores {{data in the}} so-called <b>video</b> <b>memory</b> (comprising an array of Video RAM or similar chips). This data goes either to three digital-to-analog converters (DACs) (for analog monitors), one per primary color, or directly to digital monitors. Driven by software, the CPU (or other specialized chips) write the appropriate bytes into the <b>video</b> <b>memory</b> to define the image. Modern systems encode pixel color values by devoting eight bits {{to each of the}} R, G, and B components. RGB information can be either carried directly by the pixel bits themselves or provided by a separate color look-up table (CLUT) if indexed color graphic modes are used.|$|E
25|$|The AllCard, an add-on memory {{management}} unit for XT-class computers, allowed normal memory to be mapped into the A0000-EFFFF (hex) address range, giving up to 952 KB for DOS programs. Programs such as Lotus 1-2-3, which accessed <b>video</b> <b>memory</b> directly, needed to be patched to handle this memory layout. Therefore, the 640 KB barrier was removed {{at the cost of}} hardware compatibility.|$|E

25|$|One {{technique}} used on early IBM XT computers was to install additional RAM into the <b>video</b> <b>memory</b> address range {{and push the}} limit up {{to the start of}} the Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA). Sometimes software or a custom address decoder was required for this to work. This moved the barrier to 704 KB (with MDA/HGC) or 736 KB (with CGA).|$|E
25|$|A {{problem for}} some game {{software}} developers {{was that the}} method by which MSX-1 computers addressed their video RAM could be quite slow compared to systems that gave {{direct access to the}} <b>video</b> <b>memory.</b> This, {{and the fact that the}} completely different features the MSX-1's video chip (using the MSX Video access method) had to compensate for the slower video access were not efficiently used while porting (mostly Spectrum) software, made the MSX-1 appear slower when running ported games.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} IBM CGA {{graphics card}} {{was equipped with}} 16kilobytes of <b>video</b> <b>memory</b> and could be connected either to a dedicated direct-drive CRT monitor using a 4-bit digital (TTL) RGBI interface, such as the IBM 5153 color display, or to an NTSC-compatible television or composite video monitor via an RCA connector. The RCA connector provided only baseband video, so to connect the CGA card to a standard television set required a separate RF modulator unless the TV had an RCA jack though with the former combined with an amplifier sometimes was more practical since one could then hook up an antenna to the amplifier and get wireless video.|$|E
40|$|Digital {{radiographic}} {{images are}} created {{by a variety of}} diagnostic imaging modalities. A multi-modality workstation, known as the Arizona Viewing Console (AVC), was designed and built by the University of Arizona Radiology Department to support research in radiographic image processing and image display. Two specially designed VMEbus components, the base image <b>memory</b> and the <b>video</b> display <b>memory,</b> were integrated into the AVC and are the subject of this thesis. The base image memory is a multi-ported, 8 megabyte memory array based on random access memory used for raw image storage. It supports a 10 megapixel per second image processor and can interface to a 320 megabit per second network. The <b>video</b> display <b>memory</b> utilizes <b>video</b> <b>memories</b> and is capable of displaying two independent high resolution images, each 1024 pixels by 1536 lines, on separate video monitors. In part, these two memory designs have allowed the AVC to excel as a radiographic image workstation...|$|R

25|$|The read/write memory between address 0100 {{hexadecimal}} and {{the lowest}} address of the BDOS was the Transient Program Area (TPA) available for CP/M application programs. Although all Z80 and 8080 processors could address 64 kilobytes of memory, the amount available for application programs could vary, depending {{on the design of}} the particular computer. Some computers used large parts of the address space for such things as BIOS ROMs, or video display memory. As a result, some systems had more TPA memory available than others. Bank switching was a common technique that allowed systems to have a large TPA while switching out ROM or <b>video</b> <b>memory</b> space as needed. CP/M 3.0 allowed parts of the BDOS to be in bank-switched memory as well.|$|E
25|$|When {{the primary}} {{electron}} beam {{interacts with the}} sample, the electrons lose energy by repeated random scattering and absorption within a teardrop-shaped volume of the specimen known as the interaction volume, which extends from less than 100nm to approximately 5µm into the surface. The size of the interaction volume depends on the electron's landing energy, the atomic number of the specimen and the specimen's density. The energy exchange between the electron beam and the sample results in the reflection of high-energy electrons by elastic scattering, emission of secondary electrons by inelastic scattering and the emission of electromagnetic radiation, each {{of which can be}} detected by specialized detectors. The beam current absorbed by the specimen can also be detected and used to create images of the distribution of specimen current. Electronic amplifiers of various types are used to amplify the signals, which are displayed as variations in brightness on a computer monitor (or, for vintage models, on a cathode ray tube). Each pixel of computer <b>video</b> <b>memory</b> is synchronized with the position of the beam on the specimen in the microscope, and the resulting image is therefore a distribution map of the intensity of the signal being emitted from the scanned area of the specimen. In older microscopes images may be captured by photography from a high-resolution cathode ray tube, but in modern machines they are digitised and saved as digital images.|$|E
500|$|The PlayStation had a 512 × 240 {{video mode}} which used up <b>video</b> <b>memory</b> that would {{normally}} be used for textures, but was effective in rendering shaded but untextured polygons at a sharper detail. Rubin pointed out that since the polygons on the characters were just a few pixels in size, shaded characters would look better than textured ones. Thus, polygons were emphasized over textures; this was advantageous in that it allowed the programmers more polygons {{to work with and}} allowed them to work around the PlayStation's lack of texture correction or polygon clipping. To give the game more of a resemblance to an animated cartoon, vertex animation was implemented rather than the standard skeletal animation with [...] "one-joint" [...] weighting; this allowed the programmers to use the more sophisticated three-to-four-joint weighting available in PowerAnimator. Because the PlayStation was unable to match this at runtime, the location of every vertex was stored in every frame at 30 frames a second. Gavin, Baggett, and Cerny attempted to invent assembly language vertex compressors for this manner of animation; Cerny's version was the most successful and the most complicated.|$|E

2500|$|In November, IGN held {{a second}} online chat with Zeschuk, Falkner, {{programmer}} Marc Audy, lead tester Karl Schreiner, and tester Derrick Collins. Zeschuk stated Sony had recently {{looked at the}} game and been very impressed; [...] "They felt the gameplay improvements we've made (overall better balancing and reworking parts of every level), combined with the difficulty levels and slick controls really make MDK2: Armageddon for PS2 the definitive version of the game." [...] Speaking of his earlier problems with <b>video</b> <b>memory,</b> Faulkner said [...] "the <b>video</b> <b>memory</b> situation has improved dramatically since last time. The problem {{was that there was}} too little <b>video</b> <b>memory</b> to fit all our textures, and the machine can't use a texture unless it's specifically in <b>video</b> <b>memory.</b> What we've found since then is that the PS2 has enough bus bandwidth to transfer each texture from main memory to <b>video</b> <b>memory</b> as it's needed. That's on the order of hundreds of MB per second. We hadn't anticipated that the PS2 had that kind of brute horsepower on its bus. We had to reorient our thinking after that. So now we have almost more texture memory than we know what to do with." ...|$|E
2500|$|ClearType in WPF {{supports}} sub-pixel positioning, natural advance widths, Y-direction anti-aliasing {{and hardware}} acceleration. WPF supports aggressive caching of pre-rendered ClearType text in <b>video</b> <b>memory.</b> The {{extent to which}} this is supported {{is dependent on the}} video card. DirectX 10 cards will be able to cache the font glyphs in <b>video</b> <b>memory,</b> then perform the composition (assembling of character glyphs in the correct order, with the correct spacing), alpha blending (application of anti-aliasing), and RGB blending (ClearType's sub-pixel color calculations), entirely in hardware. This means that only the original glyphs need to be stored in <b>video</b> <b>memory</b> once per font (Microsoft estimates that this would require 2MB of <b>video</b> <b>memory</b> per font), and other operations such as the display of anti-aliased text on top of other graphics including video can also be done with no computation {{effort on the part of}} the CPU. DirectX 9 cards will only be able to cache the alpha-blended glyphs in memory, thus requiring the CPU to handle glyph composition and alpha-blending before passing this to the video card. [...] Caching these partially rendered glyphs requires significantly more memory (Microsoft estimates 5MB per process). Cards that don't support DirectX 9 have no hardware-accelerated text rendering capabilities.|$|E

Other dolphinariums do not allow this because it could be harmful to the animal. In recent years a program that allows customers to have the experience of being coaches has become popular. Some programs offer guests additional interaction by allowing them to act as trainers for the day. Most programs offer pictures and <b>video</b> <b>memories</b> of the experience.|$|R

2500|$|Desktop Window Manager {{is the new}} {{windowing}} system which handles the drawing of all content to the screen. Instead of windows drawing directly to the video card's memory buffers, contents are instead rendered to back-buffers (technically Direct3D surfaces), which are then arranged in the appropriate Z-order, then displayed to the user. This drawing method uses significantly more <b>video</b> <b>memory</b> than the traditional window-drawing method used in previous versions of Windows, which only required enough memory to contain the composite of all currently visible windows at any given time. With the entire contents of windows being stored in <b>video</b> <b>memory,</b> a user can move windows around the screen smoothly, without having [...] "tearing" [...] artifacts be visible while the operating system asks applications to redraw the newly visible parts of their windows. Other features new to Windows Vista such as live thumbnail window previews and Flip 3D are implemented through the DWM.|$|E
2500|$|Faulkner and Randall {{explained}} {{the game was}} still utilizing the Omen Engine, with Faulkner saying of programming for the PlayStation 2 [...] "The PS2 is certainly good at pushing polys, no doubt about that. And the two vector processors can handle the physics and geometry we have with room to spare. The trick is the <b>video</b> <b>memory,</b> mainly. All of the cool visual features, like a high-res framebuffer, FSAA and high-res textures all {{take a lot of}} <b>video</b> <b>memory.</b> It's a real juggling act trying to get it to do all that at once." [...] Faulkner explained [...] "the PS2 math capabilities are like Intel's SSE, but on steroids. The math processors can be used to optimize any kind of math operations, which, in a 3D game, means a lot. So they will basically be used to speed up a lot of the 3D transformations and lighting." ...|$|E
50|$|Supersampling is {{computationally}} expensive {{because it}} requires much greater <b>video</b> card <b>memory</b> and memory bandwidth, since the amount of buffer used is several times larger.

[...] Only CGA could be used in this situation, because Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA) <b>video</b> <b>memory</b> was immediately adjacent to the conventional memory area below the 640 KB line; the same memory area could not be used both for the frame buffer of the video card and for transient programs.|$|E
