25|$|For {{many years}} after Apollo, the binary {{accretion}} model was settled on as the best hypothesis for explaining the Moon's origins, {{even though it was}} known to be flawed. Then, at a conference in Kona, Hawaii in 1984, a compromise model was composed that accounted for all of the observed discrepancies. Originally formulated by two independent research groups in 1976, the giant impact model supposed that a massive planetary object, the size of Mars, had collided with Earth early in its history. The impact would have melted Earth's crust, and the other planet's heavy core would have sunk inward and merged with Earth's. The superheated vapour produced by the impact would have risen into orbit around the planet, coalescing into the Moon. This explained the lack of water (the <b>vapour</b> <b>cloud</b> was too hot for water to condense), the similarity in composition (since the Moon had formed from part of the Earth), the lower density (since the Moon had formed from the Earth's crust and mantle, rather than its core), and the Moon's unusual orbit (since an oblique strike would have imparted a massive amount of angular momentum to the Earth–Moon system).|$|E

40|$|Satellite {{observations}} of water vapour and radiative fluxes {{are used in}} combination with reanalyses data to evaluate the Met Office weather and climate prediction models. Using reanalysis vertical motion data, it is established {{that much of the}} climate model error in radiative fluxes relates to errors in dynamical fields. Radiative feedback processes are to a large extent independent of these positional errors in the large-scale circulation. It is therefore of great value to analyse the relationships between water <b>vapour,</b> <b>clouds</b> and radiation in terms of dynamic regime or by averaging over large-scale circulation systems. Using the latter approach, it is found that the monthly and interannual relationships between water vapour and clear-sky radiation are consistent between models and satellite data. However, the variation in cloud radiative effect appears much larger in the observations than the model. To further understanding of radiative feedback processes involving water <b>vapour</b> and <b>cloud,</b> in is necessary to examine sub-monthly time-scales. Comparisons between the Met Office weather forecast model and Geostationary Earth Radiation Budget (GERB) data are currently in progress and illustrate the potential of this strategy...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a new, spectacular, unpredictable {{effect of the}} explosive evaporation of metallic Rb or K fractal clusters, only {{in the presence of}} excited atoms stimulated by resonant CW laser radiation in a heat-pipe glass cell.

The effect consists of the generation of optically thick, sharply localized alkaline metals <b>vapour</b> <b>clouds</b> propagating in the cell against the laser beam. These clouds are charged and exhibit a strong luminescence of Rb or K spectral lines. We believe that the explosive evaporation of metallic fractal clusters observed is explained by the laser excitation of alkali atoms. The excited atom collides into the surface of the clusters and transfers its internal energy to the surface locally. This energy greatly raises the temperature of this local part of the clusters surface, melts it and decreases the fractal surface area. Because, in general, any fractal cluster systems have a high surface energy, some of processes which leads to decreasing their surface area can liberate the surface energy. This energy increases the total temperature of the clusters and eventually leads to the thermal explosion of the cluster...|$|R
