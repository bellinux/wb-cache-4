50|$|The Balkan Mountains form a water {{divide between}} the rivers flowing to the Danube {{in the north and}} those flowing to the Aegean Sea in the south. However, they are crossed by Bulgaria's widest river, the Iskar, which forms the {{spectacular}} Iskar Gorge. Rivers that take their source from the Balkan Mountains and flow northwards to the Danube include the Timok, Archar, Lom, Tsibritsa, Ogosta, Skat, Vit, Osam, Yantra, and Rusenski Lom. The mountains are also the source of the Kamchiya, which flows directly into the Black Sea. Although not so abundant in mineral waters as other parts of Bulgaria, there are several spas such as <b>Varshets,</b> Shipkovo and Voneshta Voda.|$|E
50|$|Gorna Bela Rechka can {{be reached}} from Montana by taking roads No. 1, 1621 and 162 to the southeast, passing Krapchene and then Trifonovo on the left, and later Sumer and Stoynovo.

Before {{reaching}} <b>Varshets,</b> turn to the left, initially reaching Dolna Bela Rechka and then, surrounded by woods, fields and mountains, Gorna Bela Rechka. After the village, road No. 162 leads through forests into the Oblast Sofia. The capital Sofia, slightly less than 80 km - 55 km {{as the crow flies}} - south of Gorna Bela Rechka, {{can be reached}} by bus and train via Lakatnik in just under two hours.|$|E
5000|$|A fossil species, C. omnisanctorum, was {{described}} from the Early Pliocene (5.3-3.6 Ma) of the Gargano Peninsula and surroundings, Italy. A supposed [...] "falcon" [...] fossil from nearby contemporary and Middle Pliocene (3.6-2.6 Ma) sites may either {{be of the}} same species or another pigeon; the name Columba pisana would apply for it or (if conspecific) for both. C. melitensis is a fossil pigeon from the Late Pleistocene of Malta. Only known from a coracoid described by Richard Lydekker in 1891, whether it is indeed distinct from the living species and not just a paleosubspecies needs to be studied, given its late age. Indeterminate remains of a Columba were also found in Late Pliocene/Early Pleistocene (ELMMZ MN 17) deposits at <b>Varshets</b> (Bulgaria) and Šandalja (Croatia).|$|E
5000|$|Analysis of {{mitochondrial}} cytochrome b sequence data {{indicates that}} the crossbills and redpolls share a common ancestor and only diverged during the Tortonian (c. 8 mya, Late Miocene). [...] The {{research suggests that the}} genera Loxia and Carduelis might be merged into a single genus, for which the name Loxia would then have priority. But this would imply changing the name {{of a large number of}} species, and given that the adaptations of the crossbills represent a unique evolutionary path (see Evolutionary grade), it seems more appropriate to split up the genus Carduelis as it had already been done during most of the 20th century. Unfortunately, the fossil record is restricted to a Late Pliocene (c. 2 mya) species, Loxia patevi, found at <b>Varshets,</b> Bulgaria.|$|E

50|$|The {{only known}} {{specimen}} of Regulus bulgaricus {{is a complete}} left ulna, 13.3 mm in length. It was collected on 20 September 1991 in a ponor near <b>Varshets,</b> Bulgaria. It was first described by its collector, the Bulgarian paleornithologist Zlatozar Boev. Its species name, bulgaricus, was given after {{the country in which}} the fossil was found. Boev diagnosed it as an extinct species of the genus Regulus. The ulna is smaller than that of most passerines, and the shape of the articular surfaces identify it as a kinglet. It is distinguished from R. regulus by a thicker base, a longer olecranon, a larger cotyla dorsalis, and smaller quill knobs (papillae remigales caudales). Compared to R. ignicapilla, R. bulgaricus has a narrower proximal part of the diaphysis, a shorter olecranon, and smaller tuberculum retinaculi. Although Boev was unable to compare the fossil ulna with R. goodfellowi, it can be excluded from this taxonomical comparison due to it sharing a superspecies with R. regulus.|$|E
5000|$|... == Economy == Gorna Bela Rechka {{is located}} in a region that is {{considered}} “the poorest region in the EU”. The gross domestic product in northwestern Bulgaria is only 28 % of the average in Europe. The whole region is impacted financially primarily by a “depopulation of rural areas”. The Montana Region alone has lost more than 50,000 inhabitants since the last millennium. This has led to solitude and an aging population. In 2013 only 61 residents were counted in Gorna Bela Rechka, all over the age of 70. In particular, many women have left their homes. They found employment caring for the elderly in other European countries, in order to support surviving relatives left at home in Bulgaria. In his 70-minute documentary The Town of Badante Women, film maker Stephan Komandarev has dealt with the impact of these economic and social tragedies, using the example of the women from nearby <b>Varshets</b> in 2009. Because there are no young people left in Gorna Bela Rechka, the situation in the village has changed. Here, people mainly live off their goats and sheep. From goat milk they produce traditional foods, including a special goat cheese. The products from Bela Rechka meet the criteria of Slow Food.|$|E
