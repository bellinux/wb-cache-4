40|$|Chlamydia trachomatis (chlamydia) is {{the most}} {{commonly}} notified sexually transmissible bacterial infection in Australia, where distance to health services can be a barrier. This study investigated the acceptability of a self-collection kit for chlamydia testing (sent by mail) and assessed the risk profiles of participants with respect to locality. Methods: In total, 2587 self-collection kits were distributed opportunistically or sent directly to participants upon request, as was a self-administered questionnaire. Results: The return rate was 13. 2 % (n = 341) for samples and questionnaires. The return rate did not differ with location (P = 0. 522) but with mode of distribution (opportunistic: 9. 7 %; by request: 27. 4 %; P < 0. 001). Although 37 % of participants had previously been tested for chlamydia, 77. 5 % {{said that they would}} not have sought testing otherwise. The median age of participants was 22. 6 years, 33. 8 % were male and 9. 1 % were of Aboriginal descent. Overall, 9. 0 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) = 6. 1 - 12. 5) of participants were chlamydia-positive. Prevalence of chlamydia and Aboriginal participation increased with remoteness (P < 0. 001), and self-reported condom use was significantly reduced for <b>remote</b> and <b>very</b> <b>remote</b> <b>locations</b> (P = 0. 008). Within <b>remote</b> and <b>very</b> <b>remote</b> <b>locations,</b> 30. 8 % (95 % CI = 9. 1 - 61. 4) of Aboriginal participants and 38. 9 % of nonIndigenous participants were chlamydia-positive (P = 0. 718; 95 % CI = 17. 3 - 64. 3). Discussion: Testing for chlamydia using a mailed self-collection kit opened access to a predominantly test-naive population. The proposed model was able to reach remote populations.

50|$|Delaware is an unincorporated {{community}} in Keweenaw County in the U.S. state of Michigan. It {{was established in}} 1846 as a copper mining town.

When the town was first settled it had a population of one hundred and rose to a population close to 1200 during full operation. When the town first started out the mining companies brought everything including housing, mining buildings, schools, grocery store, and a church. Today all that is left is a mining tour and foundations of old mining buildings.

5000|$|In March 1974, Rany met Hun Sen (through Le Duc Tho) who, having {{joined the}} Khmer Rouge in 1970, {{commanded}} {{most of the}} soldiers that were treated at her hospital. As the Khmer Rouge leadership forbade fraternization among the people and strictly controlled every facet of life, including courtship and marriage, they carried on a romance through intermediaries and occasionally on the pretense of official Party business. Hun Sen officially requested the Angkar to allow a marriage in late 1974 but despite {{his reputation as a}} good leader, was told to wait until Phnom Penh was captured and the whole country was under Khmer Rouge rule. In 1975, one day before the fall of Phnom Penh, Hun Sen was hit by shrapnel and lost his left eye. Considering him now to be disabled, Bun Rany's superiors decided he was not suitable for marriage and instead attempted to arrange for her to marry a series of prominent men in Krouch Chhmar District, all of whom she rejected. Likewise, Hun Sen's superiors attempted to find a [...] "more suitable" [...] partner for him, suggesting, among others, a high-ranking Party woman twelve years his senior. Their refusal to follow the orders of their superiors led to lowered esteem and suspicion of loyalties. In early 1976, the Angkar organized a group marriage ceremony with twelve wounded and handicapped soldiers and notified Hun Sen and Bun Rany that they could marry as part of this event. The group wedding took place with little ceremony in a <b>very</b> <b>remote</b> <b>location</b> with no family members in attendance. They were told to live in Memot District where Hun Sen was stationed on the border with Vietnam while Rany was assigned to work long hours in neighbouring Ponhea Kraek and Tboung Khmum districts.

50|$|In {{order to}} combat {{negative}} publicity {{related to the}} environmental impacts of fossil fuels, including fracking, the industry is embracing solar powered pumping systems. Many oil and gas wells require the accurate injection (metering) of various chemicals under pressure to sustain their operation and to improve extraction rates. Historically, these chemical injection pumps (CIP) have been driven by gas reciprocating motors utilizing the pressure of the well's gas and exhausting the raw gas into the atmosphere. Solar powered electrical pumps (solar CIP) can reduce these greenhouse gas emissions. Solar arrays (photovoltaic cells) not only provide a sustainable power source for the CIPs but can also provide an electric source to run remote SCADA type diagnostics with remote control and satellite/cell communications from <b>very</b> <b>remote</b> <b>locations</b> to a desktop or notebook monitoring computer.|$|R
50|$|Though in {{the past}} many cruisers had no means of {{generating}} electricity on board and depended on kerosene and dry-cell batteries, today electrical demands are much higher and nearly all cruisers have electrical devices such as lights, communications equipment and refrigeration. Although most boats can generate power from their inboard engines, an increasing number carry auxiliary generators. Carrying sufficient fuel to power engine and generator over a long voyage can be a problem, so many cruising boats are equipped with other ancillary generating devices such as solar panels, wind turbines and towed turbines.

40|$|Abstract. The use of HAPS/UAV {{to enhance}} {{telecommunication}} capabilities {{has been proposed}} as an effective solution to support hot spot communications in limited areas. To ensure communication capabilities even in case of emergency (earthquake, power blackout, chemical/nuclear disaster, terrorist attack), when terrestrial fixed and mobile infrastructures are damaged or become unavailable, the access to satellites represents a reliable solution with worldwide coverage, {{even though it may}} suffer from shadowing impairment, especially in an urban environment. In this paper we approach an innovative and more challenging architecture foreseeing HAPS/UAV connected to the satellite in order to enlarge coverage and to allow interconnection with <b>very</b> <b>remote</b> <b>locations.</b> In this scenario, we have analysed TCP-based applications proposing some innovative techniques, both at protocol and at architectural level, to improve performance. In particular, we propose the use of a PEP technique, namely splitting, to speed up window growth in spite of high latency, combined with TCP Westwood as a very efficient algorithm particularly suitable and well performing over satellite links...|$|R
50|$|Later, Joy met Kenneth Rowe, an artilleryman {{with the}} Royal Canadian Air Force which whom she married at age 21 {{and went to}} live in Canada. She says the {{marriage}} was a mistake, more {{to run away from}} England than anything, living in Canada from 1947 to 1956. In Canada, her husband obtained a permit to log in the forests of British Columbia, which led the couple to live in <b>very</b> <b>remote</b> <b>locations.</b> She said she loved the vast forest but it was a lonely existence, far from civilization. She began to read anything she could get to pass the time. Later, in 1951, her only son, Trevor, was born in Prince George, as she worked as a secretary and took painting classes. However, she became increasingly dissatisfied with the marriage, feeling “petrified” and not only decided to leave her husband, but also Canada. Like her own mother, she left Trevor’s father when Trevor was five and decided to move to Mexico to make a clean break.|$|R
