5|$|The Catholic Church recognizes {{his third}} {{marriage}} as a <b>valid</b> <b>marriage,</b> based on an annulment granted for his second marriage and the passing of his wife from his first.|$|E
5|$|The {{church does}} not {{recognise}} divorce as ending a <b>valid</b> <b>marriage</b> and allows state-recognised divorce {{only as a}} means of protecting the property and well being of the spouses and any children. However, consideration of particular cases by the competent ecclesiastical tribunal can lead to declaration of the invalidity of a marriage, a declaration usually referred to as an annulment. Remarriage following a divorce is not permitted unless the prior marriage was declared invalid.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the {{marriage}} of Mary's parents was in jeopardy. Disappointed {{at the lack of}} a male heir, and eager to remarry, Henry attempted to have his marriage to Catherine annulled, but Pope Clement VII refused his request. Henry claimed, citing biblical passages (Leviticus 20:21), that his marriage to Catherine was unclean because she was the widow of his brother Arthur (Mary's uncle). Catherine claimed that her marriage to Arthur was never consummated and so was not a <b>valid</b> <b>marriage.</b> Her first marriage had been annulled by a previous pope, Julius II, on that basis. Clement may have been reluctant to act because he was influenced by Charles V, Catherine's nephew and Mary's former betrothed, whose troops had surrounded and occupied Rome in the War of the League of Cognac.|$|E
50|$|The Supreme Court's {{ruling in}} Obergefell renders moot any {{remaining}} legal challenges, as it specifically orders states to both issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, {{and to recognize}} as <b>valid</b> <b>marriages</b> performed in other states.|$|R
50|$|Section 51-1.2. Marriages between {{persons of}} the same gender not <b>valid.</b> <b>Marriages,</b> whether created by common law, contracted, or {{performed}} outside of North Carolina, between individuals of the same gender are not valid in North Carolina.|$|R
50|$|In {{the spring}} of 1997, it was {{announced}} that the remaining dynasts of the Royal House of Saxony had met and consented to the designation of Alexander as dynastic heir in the event that none of them leave sons by dynastically <b>valid</b> <b>marriages.</b>|$|R
25|$|On 24 May 2017, the Constitutional Court {{ruled that}} {{same-sex}} couples {{have the right}} to marry, and gave the Government two years to amend the law to that effect. If the law is not amended after two years, same-sex couples will be able to register a <b>valid</b> <b>marriage</b> application in Taiwan.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, {{a lesbian}} couple, Marié Fourie and Cecelia Bonthuys, {{with the support}} of the Lesbian and Gay Equality Project, {{launched}} an application in the Pretoria High Court to have their union recognised and recorded by the Department of Home Affairs as a <b>valid</b> <b>marriage.</b> Judge Pierre Roux dismissed the application on 18 October 2002, on the technical basis that they had not properly attacked the constitutionality of the definition of marriage or the Marriage Act, 1961.|$|E
25|$|Where a {{state has}} {{produced}} a formal body of law to control recognition, this will establish a general framework under which international recognition can be managed. Where there is no formal rule within the lex loci celebrationis, a forum court could hear expert evidence on whether the marriage would be accepted as effective (see the public policy of favor matrimonii which creates a rebuttable presumption {{in favor of the}} validity of any marriage) but it will be difficult for the parties to justify their failure to comply with the local laws that unambiguously would have created a <b>valid</b> <b>marriage.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{the spring}} of 1997 it was {{announced}} that the surviving male dynasts of the royal House (presumably Princes Albert, Dedo, and Gero) had met and consented to the designation of Alexander as dynastic heir in the event that none of them leave sons by dynastically <b>valid</b> <b>marriages.</b>|$|R
50|$|All marriages {{contracted}} {{without this}} state, {{which would be}} valid {{by the laws of}} the country in which the same were contracted, shall be valid in all courts and places in this state. It is the strong public policy of this state only to recognize as <b>valid</b> <b>marriages</b> from other states that are {{between a man and a}} woman.|$|R
50|$|The Catholic Church has {{consistently}} taken the position that, while dissolution of a <b>valid</b> natural <b>marriage,</b> even if consummated, may be granted {{for the sake}} of someone's Christian faith ("in favorem fidei"), though not for other reasons, and that a <b>valid</b> sacramental <b>marriage,</b> if not consummated, may be dissolved, a <b>valid</b> sacramental consummated <b>marriage</b> is indissoluble. There is no divorce from such a marriage. However, what is referred to as a marriage annulment occurs when two competent ecclesiastical tribunals hand down concordant judgements that a particular marriage was not in fact a valid one.|$|R
25|$|Nobility's marriages became restricted: generally, only a noblewoman was {{eligible}} for <b>valid</b> <b>marriage</b> of a nobleman {{in order to}} transmit the noble status to children. Because before 17th-century mass ennoblements, the number of nobles was actually only in hundreds, daughters of lower nobility became more often brides for wealthy Swedish noble families and even for magnate families. This was one of reasons why many Swedish family of high nobility got also one or more Finnish foremothers (a phenomenon very rare in medieval centuries when already geography {{was a sort of}} obstacle). Finnish nobles very often moved {{to other parts of the}} realm, to have an office in military or in government.|$|E
25|$|Different {{minimum age}} {{requirements}} also {{can lead to}} problems in mutual recognition of marriages. A marriage of young children is in some countries deemed to be against the ordre public, minimum ages for recognition are sometimes set (which may vary from the minimum ages for marriage itself). For example, in the United Kingdom, the Immigration Rules 1986 were introduced to bar persons {{under the age of}} 16 from entering the UK in reliance upon their status as a spouse. Nevertheless, for other purposes, such marriages will be recognized as valid so long as the parties had the relevant capacity under their personal laws and the ceremony was effective under the lex loci celebrationis to create a <b>valid</b> <b>marriage.</b>|$|E
25|$|The rules let to the advise from {{lawyers to}} {{postpone}} transitioning {{in order to}} gain permanent residence based on marriage when the couples would be a same-sex couple after transitioning even when they have a valid heterosexual marriage. In 2012, this approach was challenged by a same-sex couple who got married in Texas in 2010 where they are considered a heterosexual couple under the ruling in Littleton v. Prange. Their petition was originally rejected by immigration, but in January 2013, in a non precedential decision, the Board of Immigration Appeals remanded the case back to USCIS with instructions to apply the rules set forth in In re Lovo-Lara, and determine whether the couple had a <b>valid</b> <b>marriage</b> under the laws of the State of Texas. The case was held up by USCIS until the US supreme court struck down Section 3 of DOMA in June 2013.|$|E
50|$|The Marriage Act is not {{the only}} law under which a {{marriage}} may be contracted. The Recognition of Customary Marriages Act, 1998 recognises marriages under African customary law as <b>valid</b> <b>marriages,</b> though they are not legally identical to marriages under the Marriage Act. The Civil Union Act, 2006 allows for inter alia same-sex marriages which are legally equivalent to marriages under the Marriage Act.|$|R
50|$|Even though {{policies}} {{related to}} community life reflect the views, opinions, and the prejudices of that community, local laws {{have a strong}} claim to specify the formal requirements for marriages celebrated within their jurisdiction (this is, after all, {{the reason that the}} lex loci celebrationis is usually accepted as the law to determine all formal requirements for the marriage). For example, the public interest requires that marriage ceremonies are performed openly and with due publicity, with all <b>valid</b> <b>marriages</b> properly recorded.|$|R
50|$|The Oneida Nation of New York's Marriage Code (amended 2004) {{provides}} at §103 {{that a man}} and a {{woman may}} marry if they meet specified requirements. §104 states that those who cannot marry are minors, those with a living spouse, and those within prohibited consanguinity. §107 does not require a specific ceremony but the parties must declare in the presence of the officiant that they take each other as husband and wife. The Oneida Nation recognizes as valid per §111 all <b>valid</b> <b>marriages</b> celebrated outside their territorial jurisdiction.|$|R
500|$|The Assemblies of God {{will not}} grant {{credentials}} to divorced and remarried persons if either partner has a former spouse living unless for specific exceptions. Exceptions include if the divorce occurred prior to an applicant's conversion or for [...] "scriptural causes" [...] {{such as a}} former spouse's marital unfaithfulness or the abandonment of a Christian by a non-Christian partner (see Pauline privilege). The Executive Presbytery has authority to issue ecclesiastical annulments in cases involving conditions that prevent [...] "the creation of a <b>valid</b> <b>marriage</b> union", such as fraud. Clergy are also barred from membership in secret societies.|$|E
500|$|Canon law {{makes no}} {{provision}} for divorce between baptised individuals, as a valid, consummated sacramental marriage {{is considered to be}} a lifelong bond. However, a declaration of nullity may be granted when proof is produced that essential conditions for contracting a <b>valid</b> <b>marriage</b> were absent from the beginning—in other words, that the marriage was not valid due to some impediment. A declaration of nullity, commonly called an annulment, is a judgement on the part of an ecclesiastical tribunal determining that a marriage was invalidly attempted. In addition, marriages among unbaptised individuals may be dissolved with papal permission under certain situations, such as a desire to marry a Catholic, under Pauline or Petrine privilege. An attempt at remarriage following divorce without a declaration of nullity places [...] "the remarried spouse [...] in a situation of public and permanent adultery". An innocent spouse who lives in continence following divorce, or couples who live in continence following a civil divorce for a grave cause, do not sin.|$|E
500|$|Catherine {{comes into}} focus {{following}} the accession of Stephen Thomas to the Bosnian throne in 1443. Thomas, of illegitimate birth but designated as heir by Tvrtko II, {{belonged to the}} Bosnian Church and was married according to its customs. His wife, Vojača, {{was the mother of}} his son, Stephen Tomašević. Two years after his accession, King Thomas abandoned the Bosnian [...] "heresy" [...] and converted to Roman Catholicism. The Catholic Church did not recognize his union with Vojača as a <b>valid</b> <b>marriage,</b> and Pope Eugene IV gave him permission to repudiate her in early 1445. The civil war between the King and Catherine's father, which had been raging since the former's enthronement, ended soon afterwards. Peace was to be sealed with the marriage of King Thomas and Catherine, a great honour to her father. The project may have been envisioned as early as the beginning of 1445, when Thomas requested the annulment of his union with Vojača.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, {{until the}} mid-19th century, common-law marriages were {{recognized}} as valid, but thereafter some states began to invalidate common-law marriages. Common-law marriages, if recognized, are valid, notwithstanding {{the absence of}} a marriage license. North Carolina and Tennessee (which originally was western North Carolina) never recognized marriage at the common law as valid without a license unless entered into in other states. They have always recognized otherwise <b>valid</b> <b>marriages</b> (except bigamous, polygamous, interracial, or same-sex) entered into in conformity with the law of other states, territories and nations.|$|R
50|$|The {{legislative}} {{analysis and}} the ballot arguments readily demonstrate that Proposition 22 was crafted with a prophylactic purpose in mind. It {{was designed to}} prevent same-sex couples who could marry validly in other countries or who in the future could marry validly in other states from coming to California and claiming, in reliance on Family Code section 308, that their marriages must be recognized as <b>valid</b> <b>marriages.</b> With the passage of Proposition 22, then, only opposite-sex marriages validly contracted outside this state will be recognized as valid in California.|$|R
25|$|In many states, {{culturally}} separate {{communities have}} retained their own traditions. A developing modern state had {{to determine whether}} it should recognize such traditions as it was establishing a centralized system of law. In South Africa, for example, the Recognition of Customary Marriages Act 1999 retrospectively recognizes as <b>valid</b> all customary <b>marriages</b> so long as they are registered. Further, s2(3) of the Act provides that, if a person has entered into more than one customary law <b>marriage,</b> all <b>valid</b> <b>marriages</b> entered into before the commencement of the Act, are recognized. The Act similarly recognizes all customary marriages entered into after the commencement of the Act where the High Court approves a written contract regulating the future matrimonial property systems for marriages (both present and prospective spouses must be joined in the application).|$|R
500|$|Colt {{historian}} William Edwards {{wrote that}} Caroline Henshaw married Samuel Colt in Scotland when Colt {{met her in}} Europe and that the son she bore was Samuel Colt's and not John Colt's. In a 1953 biography about Samuel Colt based largely on family letters, Edwards wrote that John's marriage to Caroline {{was a way to}} legitimize her son, Sammy.

In this column, I will discuss cases from several states that have invalidated marriages that were solemnized only by ministers ordained through the mail or online, with a special focus on New York, where the validity of such marriages is especially doubtful...|$|R
50|$|The Tribal Code of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, Title 9 - Domestic Relations at §9.0701 defines {{marriage}} as a contract {{between a man and}} woman which has been licensed, solemnized, and registered.

2500|$|Where worshippers wish {{to marry}} {{according}} to the tenets of their religion, the state must decide whether that ceremony will be effective to create a <b>valid</b> <b>marriage.</b> For example, the government may decide whether a clergy has sufficient authority to declare marriage or whether a civil ceremony will be required.

2500|$|In Western cultures, {{other than}} the age of consent, the issue of consent is also {{considered}} of fundamental importance and, {{if it is not}} freely given, it can prevent a <b>valid</b> <b>marriage</b> from ever coming into existence: see nullity. In Canada, [...] "common law marriages" [...] do not require consent to be recognized and often a stipulated [...] "passage of time in eligible cohabitation" [...] is the only requisite to becoming a formally recognized [...] "marriage".
