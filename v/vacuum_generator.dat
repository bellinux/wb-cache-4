The simulation and the experiment show that the kind of vacuum servo system has the characteristics of faster response, higher control accuracy and stronger robustness. The control strategy presented can improve the static and dynamic behavior of the system effectively. PREFACE The vacuum technology has been widely used in various kinds of industrial fields, e. g. food industry, automotive manufacturing industry, metallurgy industry, et al. The applications are just limited in open-loop control [1][2]. But the reports to vacuum servo control technology are few. It is because the vacuum servo system has the inherent defects of larger time const, greater nonlinear and change with time. Considering the vacuum servo control technology will be widely used in the field of aviation and space flight, and it is very important especially in the closed to semi-practicality simulation system of the low altitude aircraft. According to the characteristics of the vacuum servo system, the single neural adaptive PID control strategy is proposed based on the reasonable constructing of system in this paper.

40|$|Commercial dry powderdispersers {{needed in}} {{conjunction}} with particle size measurement equipment are usually quite expensive (of the order of thousands of dollars). We have found that a simple <b>vacuum</b> <b>generator</b> {{can be used as}} a cost-effective disperser (US$ 50). Comparison with other commercial dispersers, small scale powder disperser (SSPD) model 3433 (TSI, Shoreview, USA) and Scirocco dry powder disperser (Malvern, Worcs, UK), showed that our disperser worked as efficiently as these expensive dispersers. Crystalline mannitol (less than 1 % moisture content) and amorphous BSA (8. 5 – 9. 2 % moisture content) smooth spherical particles were used to test the dispersion capability of the unit. Smooth spherical particles were chosen because they are more cohesive than corrugated particles due to increased contact points. Therefore, sufficient dispersions of other less cohesive particles should be able to be achieved using the optimum conditions reported here. The effects of air pressure, sample weight, and nozzle size of the disperser were investigated. Comparison of the particle size distributions between wet and dry measurements were used to determine the dispersion efficiency. Quantitative comparisons were made using the values of D(v, 0. 5) and span. The best dispersion was found using a 1. 00 mm nozzle and the maximum percentage differences in D(v, 0. 5) and span are 23 % and 19 %, respectively, with more than 200 mg mannitol powder dispersed with pressures of 50, 70, 90 psi. Using BSA powders, the maximum percentage differences of D(v, 0. 5) and span are 37 % and 25 %, respectively.

40|$|For safety reasons, to {{preserve}} a proper appearance and to ensure a long life cycle, facades have to be maintained regularly. Until now, this {{has been done by}} human workers. However, due to overhangs and structurally weak facades, work on outer facades can be a difficult and dangerous job. Thus there is a high potential for the deployment of autonomous or remote controlled facade climbing robots. But for a facility management provider such a robot only becomes interesting if it is usable across a large number of buildings. In this context free climbing robots are the most appropriate system for an all-purpose deployment. The majority of existing free climbing robots use suction cups for attachment, which are actively provided with vacuum by an extra <b>vacuum</b> <b>generator.</b> In this context passively operated suction cups have the advantage that the attaching force is generated simply by mechanically pressing the suction cup onto the surface. In the scope of this work it is shown that the weight and the complexity of the robot system can be reduced and thus the flexibility of deployment and the reliability of free climbing robots could be increased by using passively operated suction cups. The chosen system for a free climbing robot with passively operated suction cups utilises the caterpillar principle for propulsion. In order to produce suitable pressure at the front suction cups a specific attach system for suction cup suspension has been developed in this work. To calculate the characteristic forces for this climbing system that affect the suction cups the necessary mathematical process has been developed and design rules for the minimization of these forces has been derived. The sheer load has been identified as being the critical load to the suction cups. Thus the focus of this work was the development of a mathematical model for the determination of the elastic and failure behaviour of passively operated suction cups. These forces cause slippage and thus the elastic and failure behavior of the suction cups. The mathematical model for simulating the determination of the coherence between sheer forces and slippage drift {{as a function of the}} normal force has been worked out on the basis of the finite element method, and has been verified by tests. Therefore a two dimensional friction model has been developed and a new parameter to consider material expansion in the normal direction has been introduced. In an exemplary test series it has been verified that the model reproduces real conditions to an adequate accuracy. For practical use this basic system can be used for the dimensioning of passively operated suctions cups and thus for the dimensioning of climbing robots for glass facades. On the basis of this knowledge a prototype for a free climbing and autonomous robot for glass facades has been built and tested. The tests have been carried out on the functionality of the new climbing mechanism on the basis of a caterpillar with passively operated suction cups, and of the behaviour of the suction cups with different loads and different patterns of suction cup arrangements. The functionality of the climbing mechanism has been proven. Important knowledge for the optimisation of the climbing mechanism has been obtained from the interpretation of the behaviour of the suction cups during the testing in comparison with the results of the mathematical model...|$|E
