50|$|Doors {{are weak}} links in walls; {{they may be}} hollow or solid core, metal, or {{specially}} built for high sound attenuation. They can open to exterior uncontrolled areas or to internal controlled areas. Every door has a gap around its periphery that may have gaskets. Because carpeting is often used, {{there may be a}} significant gap at the bottom. Most surveillance of internal doors is accomplished by direct listening while other methods may be used for external doors. Because of the multiple paths of sound through and around a door, <b>vibration</b> <b>sound</b> maskers are used on doors. The figure on the right shows one such installation.|$|E
40|$|High power {{machinery}} such as steam turbines, large {{pumps and}} motors often use journal bearings as rotor supports. This {{type of bearing}} is simple, low cost and with high load carrying capacity. However, abnormal operating conditions in the journal bearings will degrade machine performance, increase operating cost and may cause unexpected sudden failure which is dangerous in both engineering and safety terms. Bearing condition monitoring can detect faults {{at an early stage}} and prevent the occurrence of such failures which can be catastrophic. Monitoring techniques that have been used for monitoring of journal bearing are lubricant analysis, vibration analysis, noise and acoustic emission analysis. Lubricant analysis has been used effectively for condition monitoring for a long time but cannot be implemented in real time. Many researchers have studied the use of the <b>vibration</b> and <b>sound</b> signals and acoustic emissions generated by the hydrodynamic journal bearing for detecting and diagnosing faults. The studies give relatively little information regarding surface <b>vibration</b> and airborne <b>sound</b> characteristics for self-aligning spherical journal bearings, nor has comprehensive condition monitoring been implemented for a particular self-aligning spherical bearing journal. Surface <b>vibration,</b> airborne <b>sound</b> analysis and acoustic emission monitoring can be used simultaneously to detect any signal emitted from the bearing at very wide frequency range. <b>Sound</b> <b>vibration</b> occurs in solid structure, liquid and gases transmitted to air surrounding create airborne sound. This study has conducted a thorough review of theoretical and experimental studies. The research began with designing and building a test rig consisting of a drive system, radial loading system, torsion loading system, the bearing testing system itself and control, data acquisition and measurement instrumentation systems include encoder, pressure transducers, thermocouples, load cells, vibration transducer, acoustic and acoustic emission sensors. Preliminary experiments were conducted to ensure all equipment and instrumentation worked well and also to test measurement repeatability. Preliminary experiment results showed that all the equipment either driving, loading, data acquisition and measurement system works well. Experimental analysis of the surface <b>vibration,</b> airborne <b>sound</b> and acoustic emission analysis responses in time domain and frequency domain analysis include RMS value, Kurtosis and mean value showed good repeatability. The AE measurement response showed the best repeatability, followed by surface vibration and airborne response. Theoretical study shows that the self-aligning spherical journal bearing system under radial load generated surface <b>vibration,</b> airborne <b>sound</b> and acoustic emission responses that originated from external force excitation such as fluctuating loads due to system misalignment or unbalance and internal excitation such as asperity in boundary or mixed operation. These excitations generate structure-borne vibration and acoustic emission. The structure-borne vibration dynamic responses then radiated airborne sound. Airborne sound also originated from oil pressure fluctuation and flow turbulence. The surface <b>vibration</b> and airborne <b>sound</b> frequency responses occur at frequencies 100 kHz. The amplitude and frequency of surface <b>vibration,</b> airborne <b>sound</b> and acoustic emission is influence by radial load, shaft speed and surface quality of journal and bearing components themselves. The quality of asperity contact between journal and bearing may be due to manufacturing defect, lubricant and surface deterioration over time during operation. The experiments and analysis of the surface <b>vibration,</b> airborne <b>sound</b> and acoustic emission characteristics of the self-aligning spherical journal bearing indicate that there is a positive correlation between the spectrum mean value of surface <b>vibration,</b> airborne <b>sound</b> and acoustic emission with radial load and speed. Meanwhile, when use higher lubricant viscosity creates lower surface <b>vibration,</b> airborne <b>sound</b> and acoustic emission mean amplitude. Investigation of lubricant deterioration due to water contaminant indicated that when use higher concentration contaminant in the lubricant generates higher spectrum mean value of surface <b>vibration,</b> airborne <b>sound</b> and acoustic emission responses. The surface deterioration experiment showed that there is a clear significant different in the frequency domain of surface <b>vibration,</b> airborne <b>sound</b> and acoustic emission between a scratched surface and a normal surface journal bearing. The surface <b>vibration,</b> airborne <b>sound</b> and acoustic emission frequency characteristic for scratches and lubricant deterioration creates different peak amplitudes and different frequency. The larger the scratch generate the greater the amplitude and higher frequency. From of the three measurement systems used, acoustic emission is the most sensitive and a better detect of the bearing fault than followed by <b>vibration</b> and air-born <b>sound</b> measurement system. Therefore the acoustic emission measurement technique can be integrated with surface <b>vibration,</b> airborne <b>sound</b> for rotating machinery/engine condition monitoring. Using surface <b>vibration,</b> airborne <b>sound</b> and acoustic emission monitoring the symptoms of early damage at low, medium or high frequency can be detected and more severe and catastrophic failure can be prevented, and finally very high maintenance costs can be eliminated...|$|R

50|$|Antennae are {{connected}} to the first one or two segments of the arthropod head. They vary widely in form, but are always made of one or more jointed segments. While they are typically sensory organs, the exact nature of what they sense and how they sense it is not the same in all groups. Functions may variously include sensing touch, air motion, heat, <b>vibration</b> (<b>sound),</b> and especially smell or taste. Antennae are sometimes modified for other purposes, such as mating, brooding, swimming, and even anchoring the arthropod to a substrate. Larval arthropods have antennae that differ from those of the adult. Many crustaceans, for example, have free-swimming larval forms that use their antennae for swimming.|$|E
5000|$|Drosophila melanogaster {{males are}} known for their {{elaborate}} courtship rituals, where they follow a female, tap on her with his forelegs and “sing” a courtship song through rapid wing clapping sounding much like a <b>vibration</b> <b>sound</b> in an attempt to entice her. [...] He then proceeds to contact her genitalia with his mouth and curve his abdomen to induce copulation. During the early stages of courtship where the male taps the female with his forelegs, males are able to sense the gender and species type of a potential female through the use of non-volatile (i.e. cuticular) pheromones and gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) located on the males forelegs. This process is known as gustation where non-volatile pheromones are detected by the GRNs and processed later inducing courtship.|$|E
50|$|Listening {{through air}} ducts {{is a time}} honored method of {{eavesdropping}} since almost all modern rooms have supply ducts that connect to a multiplicity of rooms. Ducts can be effective speaking tubes; the speech attenuation is particularly weak in unlined metal ducts. In some cases, exhaust ducts will connect to uncontrolled spaces. Surveillance {{can be accomplished by}} direct listening or with probe microphones or vibration devices within the duct where they are not visible for inspection. <b>Vibration</b> <b>sound</b> maskers, appropriately located at room perimeters, are attached directly to metallic duct walls and use the duct wall as the masking speaker. The figure on the right shows the masking of conversations in the duct afforded by a vibration masker at the room wall. External speaker maskers must be used at appropriate positions to radiate sound into fiberglass ducts to provide the same protection.|$|E

5000|$|Frank Popper elaborates: As far as {{the sensory}} {{experience}} of the spectator goes, the most outstanding American kinetic artist is unquestionably the Chinese-born Wen-Ying Tsai. His pieces, which are perfect on the technological level, serve {{the primary purpose of}} giving a complete visual experience to the spectator, whose sound solicitations provoke a choreographic, chromatic and rhythmic response in the ‘cybernetic sculptures’. ...György Kepes has commented enthusiastically on the ‘magic rhythms emanating from this swaying, dancing steel trembling with life’, and he has also noted the sense of ‘an instant fellowship, a spontaneous celebration’ which is re-created in their presence. As he concludes: ‘Rhythm is friendship and in Tsai’s work there is friendship of light, sound and our own heart-beats.’If this appraisal testifies to the success with which Tsai affects the sensory and emotional responses of the spectator, we must not neglect {{the fact that he is}} also addressing himself to reason and the scientific element in his audience. In effect, the observer can enter an almost mathematical relationship with these works, and sharpen his perceptual powers through the exact assessment of the various aesthetic parameters of <b>vibration,</b> <b>sound,</b> colour, wave movement, etc.|$|E

In the oil steel pipeline systems industry alone, the financial implications of pipeline failures have been estimated at £ 2. 5 billion year. Further, current methods of detection rely on periodic inspection which misses more occurrences of failure than it identifies. What is needed is a semi-continuous monitoring system that not only recognises imminent pipeline failure characteristics but also automatically transmits a warning to a central control centre. This paper reports the findings of a laboratory based test programme to evaluate the potential for <b>vibration</b> <b>sound</b> emission detection to form the basis of such an early warning system. Attenuation and waveform analysis were used to identify theoretical changes in the flow characteristics of a liquid medium as it passed along a damaged section of pipe. The effectiveness of piezoelectric sensors to detect the changed flow characteristics were evaluated for a range of artificially induced defects. The flow characteristics were analysed (using spectrum analysis of the signal across a number of frequency bands) and compared to the theoretical predictions. The results show that a piezoelectric <b>vibration</b> <b>sound</b> emission sensor can detect changes in the flow characteristics of water and diesel oil to a level of accuracy that could form the basis of an integrated wireless sensor device. Further qualitative diagnosis theory can form the basis of an algorithm which could be used to associate the changed flow characteristics with underlying pipeline defects without third party intervention...|$|E
