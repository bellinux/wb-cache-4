40|$|BarcodingR: is an {{integrated}} R package for species identification using DNA barcodes under GNU General Public License. BarcodingR includes implementations of BP-based (Zhang et al. 2008, Zhang et al. 2009 a), fuzzy-set based (Zhang et al. 2012 b), and Bayesian species identification (Jin et al. 2013), and new/updated functions <b>variously</b> <b>useful</b> in barcode study such as barcode evaluation, kmer optimization, DNA barcode gap analysis, species membership analysis, delimitation comparison analysis, consensus identification. The "BarcodingR" package {{is written in}} R language, and is released on Github ([URL] github. com/zhangab 2008 /BarcodingR) and on CRAN ([URL] cran. r-project. org/ web/ packages /BarcodingR /index. html).

40|$|In {{the last}} few decades the art world has been flooded with a number of terms invented to define the {{developing}} artforms employing the so-called ’new “ technologies; for example, electronic arts, digital arts, media arts, new media and most recently, cyberarts. While all these terms have been <b>variously</b> <b>useful</b> in defining historically specific developments in contemporary artistic practice, term cyberarts has emerged as the most useful and inclusive. For example, the term Electronic Arts is historically-specific to some art practices from the sixties till the early eighties which were based on and operated via electronic systems. The term ’digital arts “ is also historically-specific to the digitisation technologies brought about by developments in computer graphics. These technologies have themselves been superceded by the so-called ’cybertechnologies “ of which digitization is merely one aspect. Moreover, the term digital arts in also limited by the type of authoring techniques used and images / sounds thus generated. However, it is noteworthy that the term ’digital arts “ enjoys and may continue to have currency in the contemporary art world. The term, ’cyberarts “ proposed here seeks to ultimately replace ’digital arts “ by providing a more comprehensive term to embrace artworks and practices that already go beyond ’digital media“ The most recent term that has been invoked to refer to these technologically driven development...|$|E
40|$|The project {{which led}} to this report was funded by JISC in 2010 – 2011 {{as part of its}} ‘Managing Research Data’ programme, to examine the way in which Big Science data is managed, and produce any {{recommendations}} which may be appropriate. Big science data is different: it comes in large volumes, and it is shared and exploited in ways which may differ from other disciplines. This project has explored these differences using as a case-study Gravitational Wave data generated by the LSC, and has produced recommendations intended to be <b>useful</b> <b>variously</b> to JISC, the funding council (STFC) and the LSC community. In Sect. 1 we deﬁne what we mean by ‘big science’, describe the overall data culture there, laying stress on how it necessarily or contingently differs from other disciplines. In Sect. 2 we discuss the beneﬁts of a formal data-preservation strategy, and the cases for open data and for well-preserved data that follow from that. This leads to our recommendations that, in essence, funders should adopt rather light-touch prescriptions regarding data preservation planning: normal data management practice, in the areas under study, corresponds to notably good practice in most other areas, so that the only change we suggest is to make this planning more formal, which makes it more easily auditable, and more amenable to constructive criticism. In Sect. 3 we brieﬂy discuss the LIGO data management plan, and pull together whatever information is available on the estimation of digital preservation costs. The report is informed, throughout, by the OAIS reference model for an open archive. Some of the report’s ﬁndings and conclusions were summarised in [1]. See the document history on page 37...|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} {{magnetic levitation}} apparatus ("Maglev Facility") {{has been built}} for use in experiments {{in which there are}} requirements to impose variable gravity (including zero gravity) in order to assess the effects of gravity or the absence thereof on physical and physiological processes. The apparatus is expected to be especially useful for experiments on the effects of gravity on convection, boiling, and heat transfer in fluids and for experiments on mice to gain understanding of bone loss induced in human astronauts by prolonged exposure to reduced gravity in space flight. The maglev principle employed by the apparatus is well established. Diamagnetic cryogenic fluids such as liquid helium have been magnetically levitated for studying their phase transitions and critical behaviors. Biological entities consist mostly of diamagnetic molecules (e. g., water molecules) and thus can be levitated by use of sufficiently strong magnetic fields having sufficiently strong vertical gradients. The heart of the present maglev apparatus is a vertically oriented superconducting solenoid electromagnet (see figure) that generates a static magnetic field of about 16 T with a vertical gradient sufficient for levitation of water in normal Earth gravity. The electromagnet is enclosed in a Dewar flask having a volume of 100 L that contains liquid helium to maintain superconductivity. The Dewar flask features a 66 -mm-diameter warm bore, lying within the bore of the magnet, wherein experiments can be performed at room temperature. The warm bore is accessible from its top and bottom ends. The superconducting electromagnet is run in the persistent mode, in which the supercurrent and the magnetic field can be maintained for weeks with little decay, making this apparatus extremely cost and energy efficient to operate. In addition to water, this apparatus can levitate several common fluids: liquid hydrogen, liquid oxygen, methane, ammonia, sodium, and lithium, all of which are <b>useful,</b> <b>variously,</b> as rocket fuels or as working fluids for heat transfer devices. A drop of water 45 mm in diameter and a small laboratory mouse have been levitated in this apparatus...|$|R
