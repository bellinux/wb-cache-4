Since the height accuracy is strongly affected by the combined dynamics of the two platforms, this paper {{will focus on the}} analysis and control of high-frequency attitude oscillations.

40|$|A major {{unresolved}} {{question in}} the field of atmospheric research using VHF radar techniques is the relative merit of the two most widely used systems. These systems are the Doppler method and the <b>spaced</b> <b>antenna</b> method. It has been suggested that one radar of each type be operated side by side for a direct comparison of the two techniques. This duplication of effort is not cost effective. The major components of both systems are identical, and one radar could be operated in both modes by proper design of a suitable antenna system and by proper data analysis.

40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that large <b>space</b> <b>antennae</b> and other large space {{structures}} will {{play an important role}} in the coming decades as commercial applications of space become feasible. A investigation is conducted of the structural dynamics and the control properties for a 64 -meter diameter center fed antenna. Attention is given to antenna configuration and structural dynamic porperties, the attitude and structural control system, disturbance assessment, hardware sizing, the construction of weighting matrices, and numerical results. It is found that structural uncertainties and model error can cause serious performance deterioration and can even destabilize the controllers. Flight test and in-orbit system identification of critical structural modes will insure performance and reduce risk for large <b>space</b> <b>antenna</b> missions...|$|R
40|$|Also cited as: Handbook for MAP, 1984; 14 : pp. 131 - 133 It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the velocities produced by the <b>spaced</b> <b>antenna</b> partial-reflection drift experiment may constitute a measure of the vertical oscillations due to short-period gravity waves rather than the mean horizontal flow. The contention is that the interference between say two scatterers, one of which is traveling upuard, and the other down, will create a pattern which sweeps across the ground in the direction (or anti-parallel) of the wave propagation. Since the expected result, viz. spurious drift directions, is seldom, if ever, seen in <b>spaced</b> <b>antenna</b> drift velocities, this speculation is tested in the following model. C. E.

40|$|The {{requirements}} for extremely precise and powerful large <b>space</b> <b>antenna</b> reflectors have motivated {{the development of}} a procedure for shape control of the reflector surface. A mathematical optimization procedure has been developed which improves antenna performance while minimizing necessary shape correction effort. In contrast to previous work which proposed controlling the rms distortion error of the surface thereby indirectly improving antenna performance, the current work includes electromagnetic (EM) performance calculations as an integral of the control procedure. The application of the procedure to a radiometer design with a tetrahedral truss backup structure demonstrates the potential for significant improvement.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{field strength}} coverage predictions for high frequency indoor communications at 17 GHz using directional antennas at the basestation and 2 branch <b>spaced</b> <b>antenna</b> diversity at the terminal. Detailed propagation information is generated {{for a typical}} two-dimensional indoor environment using a ray-tracing propagation tool developed at the University of Bath. As a performance benchmark, initial field strength predictions are generated for omni-directional basestation and terminal antennas. Downlink performance is enhanced {{by the use of}} 2 branch <b>spaced</b> <b>antenna</b> diversity at the terminal. Factors such as <b>antenna</b> <b>spacing</b> and the choice of diversity combining algorithm are considered. At the basestation, a novel 3 branch phased array beam pattern diversity system is compared with an ideal six branch sectorised antenna. For each configuration, detailed propagation studies are performed to determine the relative (compared to omni-directional antennas) coverage improvement over the entire environment. Results indicate that the use of spaced diversity at the terminal can improve the expected coverage by as much as 10. 7 dB. Beam pattern and sector switching arrangements at the basestation result in a 7. 2 - 10. 4 dB improvement. The most impressive gains were observed using directional antennas at the basestation and <b>spaced</b> <b>antenna</b> diversity at the terminal. Gains of 17. 2 dB and 19. 4 dB were observed for 3 (beam pattern) and 6 (sectorised) branch systems respectively at the basestation...|$|R

40|$|Polymer {{composite}} materials (CM) {{are widely used}} in creation of large space constructions, especially reflectors of <b>space</b> <b>antennas.</b> Composite materials should provide high level of specific stiffness and strength for space structures. Thermal conductivity in reinforcement plane is {{a significant factor in}} case of irregular heating <b>space</b> <b>antennas.</b> Nowadays, data on CM reinforcement plane thermal conductivity are limited and existing methods of its defining are imperfect. Basically, traditional methods allow us to define thermal conductivity in perpendicular direction towards the reinforcement plane on the samples of round or rectangular plate. In addition, the thickness of standard samples is larger than <b>space</b> <b>antenna</b> thickness. Consequently, new methods are required. Method of contact heating, which was developed by BMSTU specialists with long hollow carbon beam, could be a perspective way. This article is devoted to the experimental method of contact heating on the thin carbon plates. Thermal tests were supposed to provide a non-stationary temperature field with a gradient being co-directional with the plane reinforcement in the material sample. Experiments were conducted in vacuum chamber to prevent unstructured convection. Experimental thermo-grams processing were calculated by 1 -d thermal model for a thin plate. Influence of uncertainty of experimental parameters, such as (radiation emission coefficients of sample surface, glue, temperature sensors and uncertainty of sensors placement) on the result of defined thermal conductivity has been estimated. New data on the thermal conductivity in reinforcement plane were obtained within 295 - 375 K temperature range, which can be used to design and develop reflectors of precision <b>space</b> <b>antennas.</b> In the future it is expedient to conduct tests of thin-wall plates from carbon fiber-reinforced plastic in wide temperature range, especially in the low-range temperatures. </p...|$|R
