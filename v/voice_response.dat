30|$|Another {{finding is}} the bias of all {{listeners}} towards <b>voiced</b> <b>responses,</b> {{as can be}} seen in Figure  4 even for the fully devoiced/voiceless condition and durational values prototypical of a voiceless stop. For example, over all listeners, the response probability never reaches a probability lower than 0.2 for EP, and for Italian, the probability does not drop below the 0.5 threshold, thus resulting in <b>voiced</b> <b>responses</b> from the Italian listeners only. In other words, none of the two languages showed a stable voiceless (/k/) response floor effect. This bias could be due to the missing burst in the presented stimuli and thus to the problem of extracting a stable VOT cue.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the effects of complaints on customer complaint behaviors (CCB) concurrently with evaluating the restaurant complaints of guests who are staying in thermal hotels that operating in Afyonkarahisar province. Required data gathered from 396 thermal hotel guests by using questionnaire method. In data analyzing, descriptive statistic techniques and discriminant analyses was used. As a result of the data analysis, it’s determined that guests mostly complain about restaurant service atmosphere, and much more <b>voice</b> <b>responses</b> taken comparing to other customer complaint behaviors, also customer complaints have some important effects on CCB and CCB’s sub dimensions named as <b>voice</b> <b>responses,</b> private responses, third-party responses. At last, it’s found that participants’ views about complaints and complaint behaviors are statistically similar in terms of sex, occupation and education level, on the other hand their views are statistically different (meaningful) in terms of marital status and age groups...|$|R

2500|$|Computerized {{cognitive}} behavioral therapy (CCBT) {{has been}} described by NICE as a [...] "generic term for delivering CBT via an interactive computer interface delivered by a personal computer, internet, or interactive <b>voice</b> <b>response</b> system", instead of face-to-face with a human therapist. It is also known as internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy or ICBT. CCBT has potential to improve access to evidence-based therapies, and to overcome the prohibitive costs and lack of availability sometimes associated with retaining a human therapist. In this context, {{it is important not to}} confuse CBT with 'computer-based training', which nowadays is more commonly referred to as e-Learning.|$|E

30|$|For EP, two {{effects can}} be {{observed}} for the factor voicing maintenance. First, {{there is a clear}} bias for listeners to prefer /ɡ/ responses, with a lack of complete /k/ responses (i.e. a 0 % to 20 % <b>voiced</b> <b>response</b> probability), but a lack of 100 % /ɡ/ responses can also be observed. Second, increasing voicing maintenance leads to an increase of <b>voiced</b> <b>responses</b> for all vowel duration and stop duration conditions. Furthermore, increasing stop duration leads to a decrease in the probability of <b>voiced</b> <b>responses</b> but mainly for low voicing maintenance values (i.e. for highly devoiced or voiceless items). Increasing vowel duration (panels from left to right) results in an increase in the /ɡ/ response probability, except for high voicing maintenance values. Increasing the voicing maintenance thus increases the /ɡ/ response probability for all vowel durations and stop durations, but with different magnitudes. Stop duration and vowel duration have a strong influence on voicing decisions, but this effect is limited to low voicing maintenance values. For higher voicing maintenance percentages, a ceiling effect for all stop durations and vowel durations is observed. It seems that the voicing maintenance cue is very strong here and overrides the other two acoustic cues.|$|R

30|$|The {{perception}} experiment provides {{evidence for}} the significant role of the acoustic cues voicing maintenance, preceding vowel duration and stop duration for voiced versus voiceless identification for EP but not for Italian. Italian listeners {{are more or less}} insensitive to these acoustic cues. They show a stable <b>voiced</b> <b>response</b> for all of the presented stimuli in the fully crossed design. Thus, it seems that EP listeners are strongly influenced by the three acoustic cues, but not the Italian participants.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This {{research}} investigated 2 action {{strategies for}} residents {{to deal with}} dissatisfying community services: {{moving out of the}} community (exit), or communicating dissatisfaction to local authorities (voice). Data were used from a population movement survey conducted among 1, 529 households in 3 major cities in the United Kingdom in 1997. Employing concepts from interdependence theory (Kelley & Thibaut, 1978), we predicted that dissatisfaction with community services would lead to more exit and <b>voice</b> <b>responses.</b> Furthermore, exit was predicted to be dominant among residents who, for diverse reasons, were less dependent; and voice was predicted for residents who were more dependent on the community. These predictions were supported, and the relevance of these findings for understanding community stability and improvement is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Self-reported {{measures}} {{are widely used}} to measure consumers’ emotional responses to advertising stimuli or consumption-related experiences, and are a consistently popular method for practitioners and researchers. There is, however, a problem known as “cognitive bias” which often arises from self-reported measures. Consequently, several researchers highlight the demand for the measurement of emotion to go beyond self-reported measures, and call for collaboration with other research fields to advance consumer behavior research {{in the study of}} emotion. This research collaborates with researchers in the field of human-computer interaction and suggests an alternative method: the <b>Voice</b> Emotion <b>Response</b> in Mandarin Chinese, {{which is one of the}} most widely spoken languages in the world. The findings show that the <b>Voice</b> Emotion <b>Response,</b> as compared to self-report, is more strongly related to recall.

30|$|For Italian, {{this could}} explain the absence of voicing {{differences}} {{for all of the}} acoustic cues. Listeners actively use the burst, thus obtaining the pre-voicing cue (voicing with reference to the stop release). Since the burst was deliberately missing, it could be the case that Italian listeners were not able to extract this cue, thus leading to their consistent <b>voiced</b> <b>response</b> (overall 80 % /ɡ/ perception) throughout all of the three continua. VOT could be important to extract a voiceless response, thus pointing to the short lag versus long lag VOT used as a distinctive cue. However, examining the interplay and cue weighting of other acoustic cues was not the focus of this study; but based on other languages, burst and VOT have an important effect on stop voicing distinction [2, 6, 36]. Therefore, clearly, the results would have been different if the burst had been included among the perceptual constructs.|$|R
