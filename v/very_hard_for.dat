5|$|While at Celtic, Hooper {{struck up}} an {{excellent}} partnership with fellow striker Anthony Stokes. They scored over 40 goals {{between them in}} their first season together and {{were considered to be}} Celtic's best strike partnership, although on many occasions, especially for big matches, Georgios Samaras was often used alongside Hooper. Hooper expressed his disappointment at this because he felt that he worked very well with Stokes. In their partnership Hooper usually had a more advanced role, playing off the shoulder of the last defender, or in the box, and making runs in behind. His strength, pace, finishing ability and awareness made him suitably adapted to this role. Stokes usually played a deeper role, coming short to get the ball and creating space through his dribbling skill and passing. Although Hooper is more suited to an advanced role, and Stokes to a deeper one, they were capable of switching and both have the skills required to play in either role. This made it <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> defenders to mark them.|$|E

His {{grandfather}} Bijoy Barmura Gohain and his father Brajanath Gohain was living in Silmari as exiled princes, after their attempts to become king of Ahom kingdom failed. The family faced economic hardships during their exile, and life in Silmari was <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> them. Purandar Singha also spent his early life amidst economic hardships.|$|E

His re-entrance in the diplomatic profession proved <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> him, though, and he remained in the acting profession. That same year, in 1883, he performed the most memorable role of his career (save for Armand) as Philippe Berlay opposite Jane Hading in the stage adaptation of Georges Ohnet's novel, Maître de Forges (Ironmaster). The play was a great success and ran through the entire year in the Théâtre du Gymnase, in Marseille.|$|E
25|$|In August, Canaris {{met with}} Franco's brother-in-law, Ramón Serrano Súñer, {{who was about}} to become Spain's Foreign Minister. Canaris urged Serrano Súñer to do what he could to {{convince}} Franco {{to stay out of the}} war. Soon after, Franco dispatched Serrano Súñer to Berlin to get an idea of Hitler's attitude, since Canaris had assured him that Germany would not forcibly intervene in Spain. When Serrano Súñer met Hitler on 16 September, Hitler did not press <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> Spanish involvement in the war, perhaps because he planned to meet Franco himself very soon.|$|E
25|$|This {{rejected}} the Aguilar–Spinelli test {{and put in}} place a totality-of-the-circumstances standard. This was put into place because the court recognized that there was more evidence that the Gateses were involved in drug trafficking than just the letter standing alone. The court agreed that if the letter had just stood alone it would not be probable cause to get a warrant. The court also recognized that under the Aguilar–Spinelli two-pronged test, it would be <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> the “reliability” prong to ever be satisfied from an anonymous tip so it therefore should be abandoned.|$|E

25|$|Foley {{is another}} method of adding sound effects. Foley {{is more of}} a {{technique}} for creating sound effects than a type of sound effect, but it is often used for creating the incidental real world sounds that are very specific to what is going on onscreen, such as footsteps. With this technique the action onscreen is essentially recreated to try to match it as closely as possible. If done correctly it is <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> audiences to tell what sounds were added and what sounds were originally recorded (location sound).|$|E
25|$|Such {{a massive}} and {{difficult}} iron and charcoal making operation need a massive and hardened workforce. The furnace alone needed {{as many as}} sixty people {{working around the clock}} in twelve-hour shifts. The iron works support staff included a company clerk, a host of teamsters, woodcutters, the colliers, farmers and household servants. There was a wide gap between the classes. Workers were housed in small homes and worked <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> low wages. The owners and supervisors of the furnace lived in mansions with sizable servant staffs. Historians have likened life at the furnace to life in a feudal barony.|$|E
25|$|With silver cloth {{covering}} the entire painting, {{except for the}} face and hands, it was <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> art historians to determine in what period the painting was created. In 1927, the silver cover was removed {{for the first time}} in decades. The painting was analyzed and restored. Based on the new data gathered during the restoration, Mieczysław Skrudlik came to a conclusion that the painting was completed around 1630–50 and linked it with another painting in the Corpus Christi Church in Kraków, created by artist Luke in 1624. Mary Kałamajska Saeed in her 1990 thesis argued that Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn was a work of a local artist and was inspired by contemporary Flemish mannerist painter Marten de Vos through an engraving of Thomas de Leu. In 1993, on the occasion of pope's visit, the painting was restored and one of its planks was dated based on its tree-rings. The scientists concluded that the oak grew in 1434–1620.|$|E

25|$|When {{the polls}} {{around the country}} closed at 19:00 RTL and Nova TV {{published}} {{the results of the}} exit polls conducted by Ipsos PULS. They predicted a landslide win for Josipović, giving him an advantage of almost 30 percentage points, significantly larger than all of the second-round polls. This shifted much of the political commentary and rendered much of the expected drama moot. The Josipović headquarters started celebrating immediately after the polls closed claiming that the difference is too large for Bandić to overcome and the exit polls don't feature such a large statistical margin of error. The Bandić campaign said they'll wait for official results, but admitted it would be <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> Bandić to overtake Josipović's 30 point lead even when the votes from abroad were tallied. The exit polls predicted the outcome well as the ratio between the two candidates was 9 to 1 for Bandić abroad, where there were no exit polls, which narrowed Josipović's victory to a final difference of 21 percentage points.|$|E

It's a waste of time on my part because it drains me from doing what I really want to do, which is just to play music." [...] Van Morrison describes his perceived musical role: [...] "I just feel I'm doing the job. My job is to play music and deliver the show ... It's more emotional for the audience ... what they sort of think you are."

500|$|Brodie plays as a striker and was {{described}} by the Times & Star as a [...] "prolific" [...] goalscorer. After making his debut for York in February 2007, Dave Flett of The Press said Brodie [...] "looks a potent package of pace and power with a competitive streak that should strike fear into countless Conference defenders". Foyle's guidance while manager at York was credited as benefiting Brodie. He stated [...] "I've worked hard trying to improve my game and I'm starting to score different types of goals" [...] in December 2009. He {{was described}} by the Huddersfield Daily Examiner as [...] "one of non-league football's hottest properties" [...] in January 2010. After signing for Crawley in August 2010, manager Evans said [...] "The lad is a terrific player, he works <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> the team and gets a goal".|$|E
500|$|In his {{biography}} of Ranjitsinhji, Simon Wilde suggests that MacLaren {{had to work}} <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> his employer in this period, and found little time for cricket. In addition, his batting form was poor throughout, {{and he seemed to}} be in bad physical condition when he occasionally found time to play. Before Ranjitsinhji returned to India, MacLaren resigned as his secretary—although he went with him to India for a holiday. According to Wilde, the resignation was to allow MacLaren to play more regularly, but [...] "he never really recovered his form". In summarising Ranjitsinhji's life at this time, Wilde suggests that his unreliability with money was quite calculated, and writes: [...] "Many of his off-the-field exploits with A. C. MacLaren... will probably never be known, but it seems clear that sometimes they were not averse to conducting themselves in the fashion of E. W. Hornung's fictional character Raffles, the cricketing burglar." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout her {{duration}} on the series, Jenny went on {{a journey}} {{from the very first}} episode, which portrayed her as a selfish egotist; many observers have perceived her as a narcissist, and even as a borderline sociopath. This latter assessment was based early on around her recurrent lying, and the fact she seems to excuse her own cheating in the first few seasons as a corollary of empowerment and as research for her book: which features an experimentalist female character who is evidently herself. Kirshner has described Jenny as mostly being duplicitous and confused. Jenny often acted [...] "utterly impulsive". Kirshner said it is <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> people in the series and the viewers to like Jenny because she is [...] "a very despicable character who lies, cheats, behaves and treats other people horribly for no reason, and is extremely selfish, self-indulgent and so terribly truthful... and she does not hesitate to hide any it." ...|$|E

500|$|Kirchherr {{described}} {{how difficult it}} was to be accepted as a female photographer in the 1960s: [...] "Every magazine and newspaper wanted me to photograph the Beatles again. Or they wanted my old stuff, even if it was out of focus, whether they were nice or not. They wouldn't look at my other work. It was <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> a girl photographer in the 60s to be accepted. In the end I gave up. I've hardly taken a photo since 1967." [...] Kirchherr was quoted as saying that When We Was Fab (Genesis Publications 2007), would be her last book of photographs: [...] "I have decided it is time to create one book in which I am totally involved so that it contains the pictures I like most, printed the way I would print them, even down to the text and design.... This book is me and that is why it will be the last one. The very last one." ...|$|E
500|$|Carla Garrity, a fourteen-year-old {{girl from}} Burbank, California, objected to Cole's {{invitation}} to the inauguration {{on the ground that}} Cole had done nothing to deserve it. In a letter to her congressman, Ed Reinecke, Garrity stated she had worked <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> Nixon and other Republican candidates, [...] "Therefore, I am very much against that 13-year old girl in Ohio who held up the sign 'Bring us Together' being invited to the inaugural. She didn't even read or write it!" [...] Reinecke forwarded the letter to Nixon aide John Ehrlichman with the comment, [...] "I suspect that Carla's reaction may be shared by other young people who worked in the Nixon campaign". Nixon assistant Charles E. Stuart replied to Reinecke, stating, [...] "Vicki Lynne has been invited to the inauguration not because she carried the sign, or even because she made the sign, but rather because the sign which she did carry proved to be an inspiration to Mr. Nixon" [...] and expressed his confidence the invitation would be well received by other young Nixon partisans.|$|E
500|$|Linn {{brochures}} dwell {{little on}} performance specifications, mentioning somewhat vaguely that the frequency response [...] "varies {{by only a}} few db from 20Hz to 20KHz with the isobaric loading extending usable bass response to below 10Hz". Linn also claimed [...] "very low distortion" [...] and [...] "high sound pressure levels", without quantification. Recommended amplifier power rating is {{in the range of}} 50500watts. Hi-Fi for Pleasure noted that the speakers' impedance, although quoted at 3 ohms nominal, dipped considerably at some parts of the audio spectrum. This made the DMS Isobarik <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> amplifiers to drive, potentially causing many amplifiers' output protection to trip. Equally, the two heavy woofers in each Isobarik made them twice as power-hungry. Such demands happened to make Naim amplification the perfect match because of its high current delivery capabilities and its toleration of near short circuits. The Isobarik was famously used as the acid test for the budget-priced NAD 3020 amplifier at its UK launch. In the 1970s, the DMS Isobarik, available in a number of veneers, sold for £1,000.|$|E
