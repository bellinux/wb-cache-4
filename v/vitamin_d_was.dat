40|$|Introduction: Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} (SLE), ANCA-assiociated vasculitides (AAV) and systemic sclerosis (SSc) are autoimmune systemic small and medium vessels vasculitides. In these diseases {{a shift from}} immune tolerance to autoimmunity has occurred. <b>Vitamin</b> <b>d,</b> an immunomodulatory secosteroid hormone, {{may play a role}} in this shift to autoimmune response. This review aims to study the relation of <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> level to SLE, AAV and SSc disease activity. Methods: Articles were located on pubmed using searches for <b>vitamin</b> <b>d,</b> SLE, AAV, SSc and associated terminology. Only for <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> and disease activity in SLE sufficient articles were found for a systematic review. For adequate structuring of this part of the review the PRISMA guidelines for reporting of systematic reviews <b>were</b> used. Results: <b>Vitamin</b> <b>d</b> has multiple immunomodulatory effects capable of positively influencing SLE, AAV and SSc. Monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, T-cells and B-cells are affected in such a way that infections and auto-immunity may be prevented. Based on current literature, multiple changes in the immune system of the illnesses occur that can <b>be</b> explained by <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> deficiency. Studies on <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> in SLE and SSc indicate that deficiency may be more prevalent than in healthy controls. Increased <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> may possibly <b>be</b> correlated to increased disease activity in both diseases, but evidence is mixed.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{major risk}} factors {{which we have}} been hearing since decades for causing {{hypertension}} are high salt diet, obesity, hyperlipidaemia, age, race, consuming tobacco, sedentary lifestyle, stress, drinking too much alcohol etc. However, there are many studies which shows that sugar, fats and low <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> levels <b>are</b> equally responsible for causing hypertension. The article will put forward some interesting points to show that sugars, fats and <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> levels equally {{play an important role}} in causing hypertension. KEYWORDS: Risk Factors, Vitamin D, Salt, Sugar, Fats. INTRODUCTION Hypertension (HTN) or increase in blood pressure has been considered as one of the leading factor in causing worldwide disability-adjusted life years [1]. There are many etiological factors involved behind HTN and it occurs due to a combination of both genetic and environment factors [2]. According to one study conducted by Kearney et al., more than 1 billion adults worldwide (approximately 25 %) has hypertension. Other estimates suggest this number will climb to 29 % by 2025 [3]. The major risk factors which we have been hearing since decades for causing hypertension are high salt diet, obesity, hyperlipidaemia, age, race, consuming tobacco, sedentary lifestyle, stress, drinking too much alcohol etc. [4]. However, there are far too more factors which should also be held responsible for causing hypertension. This article will put forward the new risk factors which are equally responsible for causing hypertension. ASSOCIATION OF SUGAR & HYPERTENSION In one of his recent article, Dr. James DiNicolantonio and his colleagues suggested that the main culprit behind hypertension is sugar and not salt. They have showed that sugar has a potential of causing fluid and sodium overload [5]. According to a meta-analysis of Randomised Control Trials (RCT), it was observed that that a diet with high sugar quantity as compared with a low-sugar diet, could cause an increase in blood pressure [6] Moreover, sugar can lead to leptin resistance, which may also contribute to its BP raising effects [7]. Dietary sugar may also increase aldosterone by activation of the sympathetic nervous system, which stimulates angiotensin-II and aldosterone production from adrenal glands [8]. This growing body of data suggests that an overconsumption of refined sugars can lead to salt-sensitive HTN. ASSOCIATION OF FATS & HYPERTENSION Dietary fat is known to cause weight gain and subsequently, overconsumption through its high caloric density and low satiety properties which can lead to obesity and other metabolic disorders [9]. Obesity is a known risk factor for causing HTN. In a recent study, conducted by Dixon W. Wilde et al, it was observed that there was an increase in plasma fatty acids levels which may lead to hypertension via a process involving the elevation of Ca 2 + current density and by a change of channel kinetics in the vascular smooth muscle membrane [10]. In an another study conducted by Dr. Clint Gray et al, concluded that when rats were given a diet of high fat (HF) and high salt (HS) while being bearing foetuses, their offspring’s when born, had blood pressure pretty much higher than those whose mothers were fed with HS diets [11]. Hence, even fats should be considered as one of the new emerging risk factors for causing hypertension. ASSOCIATION OF LOW VITAMIN D LEVELS & HYPERTENSION Vitamin D plays an important role in the maintenance of blood pressure and other cardiovascular functions [12]. Koota et al., showed systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and arterial average pressure had increased among people suffering from lack of vitamin D and suggested that Vitamin D deficiency is accompanied by Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System activity (RAAS) [13]. One similar study showed that people with higher levels of vitamin D had lower blood pressures and a lower risk of developing hypertension [14]. A review in 2013 looked at many studies involving people with hypertension. They found that for each 10 ng/ml increase in someone’s vitamin D levels, they had a 12 % lower risk of developing hypertension. The people with the highest vitamin D levels had a 30 % lower risk of developing hypertension compared to the people with the lowest levels [15]. Hence, low levels of <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> could also <b>be</b> an emerging risk factor for HTN. CONCLUSION The article puts forward some interesting points to show that sugars, fats and <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> levels equally {{play an important role in}} causing hypertension. Physicians should be careful and should inform their hypertensive patients about the ill-effects of having meals with high sugars, fats and low <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> levels.

40|$|Although {{bariatric surgery}} {{is the most}} {{effective}} weight loss therapy, its skeletal consequences are unclear. This study examined the effects of bariatric surgery and dietary intervention on weight, gut hormones, adiponectin, appetite control and bone loss over 24 months post-intervention. At baseline there were 18 diet, 12 gastric banding (GB) and 20 gastric sleeve (GS) subjects with mean (±SD) age 53 (12) years and BMI 39 (6). A quarter of patients had low bone mineral density (BMD) with t-scores within the osteopenic range. At 12 months, mean (±SD) (kg) weight loss was greatest in the GS group [diet - 5. 4 (7), GB - 12 (6) and GS - 33 (13), p< 0. 0001]. Bone loss (%) was also greater in the GS group; [total hip, - 0. 86 (1. 6) in diet, - 1. 6 (1. 5) in GB and - 6. 1 (3) in GS, p< 0. 0001]. For all subjects, maximal weight loss occurred in the first 6 months but for GS, total hip bone loss continued reaching 9 (3) % for 12 patients with 24 months data, p< 0. 001. These patients also experienced an ongoing decline in lean body mass of 13 (4) %. The 12 month mean postprandial PYY % (+ 90 min) response differed between groups: diet 58 (102), GB 70 (74), GS 150 (106), p< 0. 0008. Adiponectin change (%) varied between groups: diet 4 (22), GB 21 (19), GS 75 (62), p= 0. 0022 with no significant glp- 1 change. Consistent with the bone loss, bone turnover markers only increased in GS with osteocalcin by 110 (89) % and urinary n-telopeptide by 89 (83) %, p< 0. 001. Calcium intake, <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> and PTH <b>were</b> normal throughout the study. When considering the whole group at 12 months, TH BMD loss correlated significantly with weight loss, postprandial PYY and adiponectin. In multivariate analysis weight loss and PYY response explained 56 % of TH BMD loss (p< 0. 0001). In summary, GS was the most efficient weight loss modality; however, it was complicated by a negative effect on body composition. The ongoing bone loss in GS was not explained by weight loss alone and was associated with postprandial PYY and adiponectin changes.

At baseline, 12 % (n= 7) were deficient in vitamin D (< 30 nmol/L) and approximately 38 % (n= 22) had inadequate vitamin D levels (< 50 nmol/L). The baseline 25 -OH vitamin D level was 59 nmol/L + 25 (mean SD), and increased significantly to 72 nmol/L + 21 nmol/L at 5 -months. Conclusion: These data are the first to provide evidence that clinical interventions are feasible in elders who self-neglect. The increase in vitamin D levels confirmed that the study personnel were able to successfully intervene community-dwelling elders with self-neglect. This study sets the precedent for future intervention and prevention studie...|$|E

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{analytical}} findings of the mineral metabolism, bone metabolism and linear growth along with the bone strength of the infants dependent on the mother's calcium and vitamin D provision during pregnancy. The researchers have prospectively examined 160 mother–newborn infant pairs and 87 children for 6 – 8 months. They confirmed that infant's calcium and vitamin D provision depends on calcium and <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> contained in mother's body. Prophylaxis and correction of the calcium and vitamin D deficit in the mother's body will ensure necessary rates of the linear growth, mineral metabolism, and bone remodeling both during antenatal period and within the first 6 – 8 months, following the birth, increase the bone strength and reduce the frequency of rachitic and rachiticblike changes in the infant skeleton. Key words: newborn infants, infants, calcium provision, bone metabolism, linear growth, bone strength. </p...|$|R
