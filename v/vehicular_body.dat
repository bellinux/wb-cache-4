60|$|From the Business Quarter they {{presently}} {{passed by}} the running ways into a remote quarter of the city, where {{the bulk of the}} manufactures was done. On their way the platforms crossed the Thames twice, and passed in a broad viaduct across one of the great roads that entered the city from the North. In both cases his impression was swift and in both very vivid. The river was a broad wrinkled glitter of black sea water, overarched by buildings, and vanishing either way into a blackness starred with receding lights. A string of black barges passed seaward, manned by blue-clad men. The road was a long and very broad and high tunnel, along which big-wheeled machines drove noiselessly and swiftly. Here, too, the distinctive blue of the Labour Company was in abundance. The smoothness of the double tracks, the largeness and the lightness of the big pneumatic wheels in proportion to the <b>vehicular</b> <b>body,</b> struck Graham most vividly. One lank and very high carriage with longitudinal metallic rods hung with the dripping carcasses of many hundred sheep arrested his attention unduly. Abruptly the edge of the archway cut and blotted out the picture.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} bachelor’s {{thesis is}} a {{description}} of methods being used for measurements of aerodynamic characteristics of automobiles. The exact determination of the aerodynamic characteristics requires sophisticated testing equipment and advanced engineering procedures. The research comprises several approaches. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is based on turbulent models application such as RANS, LES and DNS. Pressure distribution on a <b>vehicular</b> <b>body</b> surface and an air flow along the vehicle are monitored in wind tunnels. Flow visualization is carried out by optical (PIV, LDA) and non-optical methods. Experimental road testing methods are focused on multiple parameters including a vehicle directional stability, its cross-wind sensitivity, engine cooling system and many others...|$|E
40|$|Use of multimaterial {{fabrication}} such as aluminium {{to steel}} to reduce overall <b>vehicular</b> <b>body</b> weight has gained significant {{attention in the}} automotive industries. Since fusion welding of aluminium to steel is difficult, friction stir welding of the same is considered as an effective recourse. Quantitative studies on friction stir welding of aluminium to steel are thus important but scarce in the literature. We present here a numerical and experimental study on friction stir lap welding of AA 6061 to high strength interstitial free coated steel sheets under different combinations of tool rotational speed and welding speed. The computed values of thermal cycle, torque and traverse force {{are found to be}} in good agreement with the corresponding experimentally measured values. The computed thermal cycles along the AA 6061 to steel interfaces are related qualitatively with the experimentally measured trend and distribution in Fe-Al intermetallics along the weld joint interface...|$|E

50|$|Trashor — This {{series has}} smaller <b>vehicular</b> <b>bodies.</b> Trashors {{do not have}} Models. All are four-wheeled, and have only a single {{combination}} manipulator/head. The control circuit of a Trashor is not visible, though damage to one in the comic has shown they are located within their heads. Trashors are seen in both the Protector and Destructor ranks in small numbers similar to the Rammors. It is unknown if any Guardian Trashors ever existed, but above average supposition for their original existence {{can be found in}} the fact that the Armored Battlestation has a side launch bay specifically for Trashors.|$|R
40|$|Conformal antennas have {{widespread}} {{applications in}} communication systems for <b>vehicular</b> <b>bodies,</b> aircrafts, and spacecrafts etc. They are non-protruding and can arbitrarily take any shape {{on the surface}} where they are etched. This thesis is a summary of two main projects. The first project employs a conformal array of four S-band and four GPS-band antennas for sub-payload of a sounding rocket. The sub-payload is a small cylinder and therefore the eight conformal antennas are based on curved patch geometry. The second project employs a conformal antenna for a CubeSat. The antenna {{is based on a}} cavitybacked slot and therefore can be conveniently integrated around the surface-mount solar cells of the CubeSat. Such an integration has enormous merits for CubeSat because there is no competition between the antennas and solar cells for the limited surface real estate. The antenna design operates UHF band with circular polarization, making it the first UHF nondeployed antenna for CubeSats. For both projects, problems such as isolation, impedance bandwidth, axial ratio bandwidth, and EMI shielding have been analyzed and resolved. This thesis work yields a prototype-ready design for the first project, and a final prototype and measurements for the second project...|$|R
40|$|The {{article of}} record as {{published}} {{may be found}} at [URL] A prospective, longitudinal analysis of musculoskeletal combat injuries sustained by a large combat-deployed maneuver unit has not previously been performed. Methods: A {{detailed description of the}} musculoskeletal combat casualty care statistics, distribution of wounds, and mechanisms of injury incurred by a US Army Brigade Combat Team during “The Surge” phase of Operation Iraqi Freedom was performed using a centralized casualty database and an electronic medical record system. Results: Among the 4, 122 soldiers deployed, there were 242 musculoskeletal combat wounds in 176 combat casualties. The musculoskeletal combat casualty rate for the Brigade Combat Team was 34. 2 per 1, 000 soldier combat-years. Spine, pelvis, and long bone fractures comprised 55. 9 % (33 of 59) of the total fractures sustained in combat. Explosions accounted for 80. 7 % (142 of 176) of all musculoskeletal combat casualties. Musculoskeletal combat casualty wound incidence rates per 1, 000 combat-years were as follows: major amputation, 2. 1; minor amputation, 0. 6; open fracture, 5. 0; closed fracture, 6. 4; and soft-tissue/neurovascular injury, 32. 8. Among musculoskeletal combat casualties, the likelihood of a gunshot wound causing an open fracture was significantly greater (45. 8 % [11 of 24]) when compared with explosions (10. 6 % [15 of 142]) (p 0. 0006). Long bone amputations were more often caused by explosive mechanisms than gunshot wounds. Conclusions: A large burden of complex orthopedic injuries has resulted from the combat experience in Operation Iraqi Freedom. This is because of increased enemy reliance on explosive devices, the use of individual and <b>vehicular</b> <b>body</b> armor, and improved survivability of combat-injured soldiers...|$|E
40|$|Circularly {{polarized}} antennas {{are used}} in mobile-satellite or MSAT communication systems. This reduces the polarization mismatch due to the rotational orientation between the transmitter and the receiver and it also minimizes the interference from multipath reflections. Circularly polarized microstrip antennas are commonly used in these systems because of compactness, the light-weight and the low-profile. It eases the installation on a <b>vehicular</b> <b>body</b> or on the surface ofa satellite. This paper presents a circularly polarized microstrip circular patch antenna designed for vehicular use for MSAT communications at a frequency of around I. 6 GHz. It has right-hand circular polarization (RHCP) and near hemispherical coverage needed by the user. The antenna was first simulated using MatLab software for TM 110 resonance mode and fabricated on a substrate of epoxy glass fiber. The antenna was tested on a curved ground plane, which {{was similar to the}} surface of a vehicle. This low profile microstrip antenna is suitable for vehicle rooftop mounting. A combination of the resonance cavity model and the transmission-line model was used to analyze the antenna, which consists of a single circular patch as the driven clement. In order to obtain circular polarization, perturbation segments to the perimeter of the patch were inserted with a single probe feed on the 45 ° axis with respect to the perturbation segments, known as mode-de- tuning. As such no external phasing network is required to obtain the 90 ° time phase difference required for circular polarization. It was fed with a 50 Ω coaxial feed line which was soldered to the inset probe. By adjusting the area of the perturbation segments circular polarization and a good axial ratio was obtained. Half power beam widths of the antenna are 115 ° in the H plane and 105 ° in the E plane. The antenna has a gain of 5. 7 dBi and a bandwidth of 286 MHz which is approximately 17 % of the centre frequency. The design criteria and performance of the circularly polarized microstrip antenna, which is suitable for MSAT communications, are presented...|$|E
40|$|Having {{demonstrated}} {{the possibility of}} constructing nanoscale metallic <b>vehicular</b> <b>bodies</b> as described in last year's proposal, our goals have been to make uniform preparations of the metallized lipid assemblies and to determine the feasibility of powering these nanostructures with biological motors that are activated and driven by visible light. We desired that the propulsion system be constructed entirely by self-assembly and powered by a photocatalytic process partially already built into the nanovehicle. The nanovehicle we desire to build is composed of both natural biological components (ATPase, kinesin-microtubules) and biomimetic components (platinized liposomes, photosynthetic membrane) as functional units. The vehicle's body was originally envisioned to be composed of a surfactant liposomal bilayer coated with platinum nanoparticles, but instead of the expected nanoparticles {{we were able to}} grow dendritic 2 -nm thick platinum sheets on the liposomes. Now, we have shown {{that it is possible to}} completely enclose the liposomes with sheeting to form porous platinum spheres, which show good structural stability as evidenced by their ability to survive the stresses of electron-microscopy sample preparation. Our goals were to control the synthesis of the platinized liposomes well enough to make uniform preparations of the coated individual liposomes and to develop the propulsion system for these nanovehicles a hydrogen-evolving artificial photosynthetic system in the liposomal bilayer that generates the pH gradient across the membrane that is necessary to drive the synthesis of ATP by ATP-synthase incorporated in the membrane. ATP produced would fuel the molecular motor (kinesin) attached to the vehicle, needing only light, storable ADP, phosphate, and an electron donor to be produced by ATP-synthase in the membrane. These research goals appear to be attainable, but growing the uniform preparations of the liposomes coated with dendritic platinum sheeting, a necessary accomplishment that would simplify the task of incorporating and verifying the photosynthetic function of the nanovehicle membrane, has proved to be difficult. The detailed understanding of the relative locations of surfactant and Pt in the liposomal bodies has also forced a change in the nanovehicle design strategies. Nevertheless, we have found no insurmountable obstacles to making these nanovehicles given a larger and longer term research effort. These nanovehicles could potentially respond to chemical gradients, light intensity, and field gradients, in the same manner that magnetic bacteria navigate. The cargo might include decision-making and guidance components, drugs and other biological and chemical agents, explosives, catalytic reactors, and structural materials...|$|R
