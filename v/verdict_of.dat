5|$|Following the {{elections}} of September 1857, the entire Partida Națională chose to support Cuza for the Moldavian throne.

5|$|Ian Tomlinson (7 February 1962– 1 April 2009) was a {{newspaper}} vendor who collapsed {{and died in}} the City of London after being struck by a police officer during the 2009 G-20 summit protests.

5|$|Regardless of the <b>verdict</b> <b>of</b> juries, no {{player that}} throws a ball game; no player that {{undertakes}} or promises {{to throw a}} ball game; no player that sits in a conference {{with a bunch of}} crooked players and gamblers where the ways and means of throwing ball games are planned and discussed and does not promptly tell his club about it, will ever play professional baseball. Of course, I don't know that any of these men will apply for reinstatement, but if they do, the above are at least a few of the rules that will be enforced. Just keep in mind that, regardless of the <b>verdict</b> <b>of</b> juries, baseball is competent to protect itself against crooks, {{both inside and outside the}} game.|$|E

5|$|After the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) began a {{criminal}} inquiry, further autopsies indicated that Tomlinson {{had died from}} internal bleeding caused by blunt force trauma to the abdomen, in association with cirrhosis of the liver. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided not to charge Harwood, because the disagreement {{between the first and}} later pathologists meant they could not show a causal link between the death and alleged assault. That position changed in 2011; after the <b>verdict</b> <b>of</b> unlawful killing, the CPS charged Harwood with manslaughter. He was acquitted in 2012 and dismissed from the service a few months later.|$|E
5|$|By 1876, Macdonald and the Conservatives {{had adopted}} {{protection}} as party policy. This view was widely promoted in speeches {{at a number}} of political picnics, held across Ontario during the summer of 1876. Macdonald's proposals struck a chord with the public, and the Conservatives began to win a string of by-elections. By the end of 1876, the Tories had picked up 14seats as a result of by-elections, reducing Mackenzie's Liberal majority from 70 to 42. Despite the success, Macdonald considered retirement, wishing only to reverse the voters' <b>verdict</b> <b>of</b> 1874—he considered Charles Tupper his heir apparent.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{frequent}} derailments, {{low speed}} meant Wotton Tramway {{had a good}} safety record. The locomotives occasionally ran over stray sheep, and on 12September1888 sparks {{from one of the}} Aveling and Porter engines blew back into one of the train's cattle trucks, igniting the straw bedding and badly burning two cows. The line had one serious accident, in which Ellen Maria Nickalls, a servant at Wotton House, was struck by a locomotive near Church Siding and killed. The coroner returned a <b>verdict</b> <b>of</b> accidental death, absolving driver James Challis.|$|E

5|$|In 1946, {{the year}} of Shaw's ninetieth birthday, he {{accepted}} the freedom of Dublin {{and became the first}} honorary freeman of the borough of St Pancras, London. In the same year the government asked Shaw informally whether he would accept the Order of Merit. He declined, believing that an author's merit could only be determined by the posthumous <b>verdict</b> <b>of</b> history. 1946 saw the publication, as The Crime of Imprisonment, of the preface Shaw had written 20 years previously to a study of prison conditions. It was widely praised; a reviewer in The American Journal of Public Health considered it essential reading for any student of the American criminal justice system.|$|E
5|$|Meyerbeer's operas {{consistently}} enjoyed enormous popularity {{during his}} lifetime, and the <b>verdict</b> <b>of</b> (the then pro-Meyerbeer) Wagner in 1841, when the Paris Opéra was vainly awaiting Le prophète and L'Africaine, was not atypical:The Paris Opéra lies dying. It looks for its salvation to the German Messiah, Meyerbeer; if he keeps it waiting much longer, its death agonies will begin...It is for that reason...that one only sees Robert le Diable and Les Huguenots turning up {{again when the}} mediocrities are forced to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|On 18 March 1889, Bury was arraigned for {{the murder}} of his wife; he entered a plea of not guilty. The trial was seen before Lord Young in the High Court of Justiciary on 28 March. Bury's defence team {{comprised}} solicitor David Tweedie and advocate William Hay; the prosecution was led by advocate depute Dugald or Dill McKechnie. The hearing lasted 13 hours. The prosecution witnesses included Ellen's sister Margaret Corney, William's former employer James Martin, the Burys' London landlady Elizabeth Haynes, William's drinking partner David Walker, Lieutenant Lamb and Drs Templeman and Littlejohn. After a break for supper, Hay presented the defence case, which was heavily dependent on Dr Lennox's testimony that Ellen had strangled herself. At 10:05p.m., Lord Young finished his summation, and the jury of 15 men retired to consider their verdict. After 25 minutes, the jury returned with a <b>verdict</b> <b>of</b> guilty with a recommendation for mercy. Lord Young asked the jury why they recommended mercy, and one of them replied that the medical evidence was contradictory, referring to Lennox's testimony. Dundee had a history of opposition to the death penalty, and the jury may have been trying to avoid passing a death sentence. Young told the jury to retire and reconsider their verdict until they were decided by the evidence one way or another. At 10:40p.m., they returned with a unanimous <b>verdict</b> <b>of</b> guilty. Lord Young passed the mandatory sentence for murder: death by hanging.|$|E
