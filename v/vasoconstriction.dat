5|$|Low oxygen levels lead to hypoxic {{pulmonary}} <b>vasoconstriction,</b> the {{tightening of}} small {{blood vessels in}} the lung to create an optimal distribution of blood through the lung. Persistently low oxygen levels causing chronic <b>vasoconstriction</b> leads to increased pressure on the pulmonary artery (pulmonary hypertension), which in turn puts strain on the right ventricle, the part of the heart that pumps blood to the lungs. The right ventricle undergoes remodeling, becomes distended and is less able to remove blood from the veins.

We have applied P 2 receptor drugs to rat pial arterioles and measured changes in arteriole diameter (o. d. 40 – 84 μm at rest), and recorded currents from arteriolar smooth muscle cells using patch-clamp techniques. Transient <b>vasoconstrictions</b> and rapidly inactivating currents were evoked by α,β-methylene ATP (0. 1 – 30 μm) and were sensitive to the P 2 receptor antagonists suramin and iso-PPADS. UTP and UDP (0. 1 – 1000 μm) evoked sustained suramin-sensitive <b>vasoconstrictions.</b> ATP (0. 1 – 1000 μm) and 2 -methylthioATP (2 MeSATP, 300 μm) evoked transient <b>vasoconstrictions</b> followed by sustained vasodilatations. ADP application resulted in only vasodilatation (EC 50 ∼ 4 μm). Vasodilator responses to ATP, 2 MeSATP or ADP were unaffected by suramin (100 μm). RT-PCR analysis indicated that P 2 X 1 – 7 and P 2 Y 1, 2, 6 RNA can be amplified from the pial sheet. Our results provide direct evidence {{for the presence of}} functional P 2 X receptors with a phenotype resembling the P 2 X 1 receptor subtype on cerebral resistance arterioles. The pharmacological properties of the pyrimidine-evoked responses suggest that a combination of P 2 Y 2 - and P 2 Y 6 -like receptors are responsible for the sustained <b>vasoconstrictions.</b> It is therefore likely that the nucleotides and their associated receptors are involved in a complicated regulatory system to control cerebral blood pressure...|$|R

40|$|The {{actions of}} ω-conotoxin (ω-CTX) and {{diltiazem}} on adrenergic and purinergic components of double peaked vasoconstrictor responses to periarterial nerve stimulation {{have been investigated}} in the isolated, perfused canine splenic arterial preparation. Double peaked <b>vasoconstrictions</b> (biphases of vasoconstrictors) were consistently observed in the conditions of 30 [*]s trains of pulses at 1 – 10 [*]Hz frequencies. ω-CTX (1 – 30 [*]nM) produced similar inhibitory effects on the first phase and second phase responses in a dose-related manner. Thirty nM ω-CTX almost completely inhibited the biphasic <b>vasoconstrictions</b> at any used frequencies but {{did not affect the}} vasoconstrictor responses to exogenous applied ATP (0. 01 – 1 [*]μmol) and noradrenaline (0. 03 – 3 [*]nmol). Intraluminal application of a large dose of diltiazem (3 – 10 [*]μM) also produced a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on biphasic <b>vasoconstrictions</b> at any used frequencies. Three μM diltiazem exerted rather a larger inhibitory effect on the second phase than the first phase response at low frequencies (1 – 3 [*]Hz), but a similar inhibition on first and second phasic responses at high frequencies (6 – 10 [*]Hz). An extremely high dose of diltiazem (10 [*]μM) almost completely inhibited the biphasic vasoconstrictor responses to nerve stimulation, and slightly inhibited the contractile responses to exogenous applied ATP (0. 01 – 1 [*]μmol) and noradrenaline (0. 03 – 3 [*]nmol). The present results indicate that ω-CTX selectively acts prejunctionally to inhibit the release of transmitters from sympathetic nerve terminals, and ω-CTX-sensitive calcium channels may produce a parallel controlling of purinergic and adrenergic components of sympathetic cotransmission.

5|$|Its effects, {{depending}} on dosage, include {{an increase in}} sodium excretion by the kidneys, an increase in urine output, an increase in heart rate, {{and an increase in}} blood pressure. At low doses it acts through the sympathetic nervous system to increase heart muscle contraction force and heart rate, thereby increasing cardiac output and blood pressure. Higher doses also cause <b>vasoconstriction</b> that further increases blood pressure. Older literature also describes very low doses thought to improve kidney function without other consequences, but recent reviews have concluded that doses at such low levels are not effective and may sometimes be harmful. While some effects result from stimulation of dopamine receptors, the prominent cardiovascular effects result from dopamine acting at α1, β1, and β2 adrenergic receptors.|$|E
5|$|Marine mammals {{are able}} to dive {{for long periods of}} time. Both {{pinnipeds}} and cetaceans have large and complex blood vessel systems which serve to store oxygen to support deep diving. Other important reservoirs include muscles, blood, and the spleen which all have the capacity to hold a high concentration of oxygen. They are also capable of bradycardia (reduced heart rate), and <b>vasoconstriction</b> (shunting most of the oxygen to vital organs such as the brain and heart) to allow extended diving times and cope with oxygen deprivation. If oxygen is depleted, marine mammals can access substantial reservoirs of glycogen that support anaerobic glycolysis of the cells involved during conditions of systemic hypoxia associated with prolonged submersion.|$|E
5|$|The diving reflex is a {{response}} to immersion that overrides the basic homeostatic reflexes. It optimises respiration by preferentially distributing oxygen stores to the heart and brain, which allows extended periods underwater. It is exhibited strongly in aquatic mammals (seals, otters, dolphins and muskrats), and also exists in other mammals, including humans. Diving birds, such as penguins, have a similar diving reflex. The diving reflex is triggered by chilling the face and holding the breath. The cardiovascular system constricts peripheral blood vessels, slows the pulse rate, redirects blood to the vital organs to conserve oxygen, releases red blood cells stored in the spleen, and, in humans, causes heart rhythm irregularities. Aquatic mammals have evolved physiological adaptations to conserve oxygen during submersion, but apnea, slowed pulse rate, and <b>vasoconstriction</b> are shared with terrestrial mammals.|$|E
40|$|GABAergic interneurons {{are local}} integrators of {{cortical}} activity {{that have been}} reported {{to be involved in the}} control of cerebral blood flow through their ability to produce vasoactive molecules and their rich innervation of neighboring blood vessels. They form a highly diverse population among which the serotonin 5 -hydroxytryptamine 3 A receptor (5 -HT 3 A) -expressing interneurons share a common developmental origin, in addition to the responsiveness to serotonergic ascending pathway. We have recently shown that these neurons regroup two distinct subpopulations within the somatosensory cortex: Neuropeptide Y (NPY) -expressing interneurons, displaying morphological properties similar to those of neurogliaform cells, and Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) -expressing bipolar/bitufted interneurons. The aim of the present study was to determine the role of these neuronal populations in the control of vascular tone by monitoring blood vessels diameter changes, using infrared videomicroscopy in mouse neocortical slices. Bath applications of 1 -(3 -Chlorophenyl) biguanide hydrochloride (mCPBG), a 5 -HT 3 R agonist, induced both constrictions (30 %) and dilations (70 %) of penetrating arterioles within supragranular layers. All <b>vasoconstrictions</b> were abolished in the presence of the NPY receptor antagonist (BIBP 3226), suggesting that they were elicited by NPY release. Vasodilations persisted in the presence of the VIP receptor antagonist VPAC 1 (PG- 97 - 269), whereas they were blocked in the presence of the neuronal Nitric Oxide (NO) Synthase (nNOS) inhibitor, L-NNA. Altogether, these results strongly suggest that activation of neocortical 5 -HT 3 A-expressing interneurons by serotoninergic input could induces NO mediated vasodilatations and NPY mediated <b>vasoconstrictions...</b>|$|R

5|$|Birds {{have a very}} {{efficient}} system for diffusing oxygen into the blood; birds have a ten times greater surface area to gas exchange volume than mammals. As a result, birds have more blood in their capillaries per unit of volume of lung than a mammal. The arteries are composed of thick elastic muscles to withstand {{the pressure of the}} ventricular constriction, and become more rigid as they move away from the heart. Blood moves through the arteries, which undergo <b>vasoconstriction,</b> and into arterioles which act as a transportation system to distribute primarily oxygen as well as nutrients to all tissues of the body. As the arterioles move away from the heart and into individual organs and tissues they are further divided to increase surface area and slow blood flow.

5|$|The dental {{effects of}} {{long-term}} methamphetamine use are often attributed to {{its effects on}} saliva. The reduction in saliva {{increases the likelihood of}} dental caries, enamel erosion, and periodontal disease. Although it is clear that use of the drug decreases saliva, the mechanism by which it does so is unclear. One theory is that the drug causes <b>vasoconstriction</b> (narrowing of the blood vessels) in salivary glands, decreasing salivary flow. This constriction is thought to be due to the activation of alpha-adrenergic receptors by both methamphetamine itself and norepinephrine, the levels of which are dramatically increased by methamphetamine use. These factors can be compounded by dehydration, which occurs in many methamphetamine users after drug-induced increases in metabolism. The characteristics of the saliva produced during use of the drug, which includes high protein content, may also contribute to the sensation of dry mouth.|$|E

40|$|In pig {{coronary}} arteries atherosclerosis developed progressively after an experimental mechanical {{injury to the}} endothelium, despite its regeneration. The atherosclerotic process can be considerably accelerated by a high cholesterol diet. In arteries with regenerated endothelium, there is a reduction of endothelium-dependent relaxations mediated by (a) pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein(s).

40|$|A STIMULUS {{applied to}} a {{sleeping}} subject may evoke a number of bodily responses. Some of these responses are easily recognizable and can be directly observed, e. g. a movement of the limbs, a change in amplitude or rate of respiration, opening of the eyes and awakening. Other responses are less apparent, being detected only by delicate measurements of some physiological variables. The electrical activity of the brain may show large variations in response to mild sensory stimuli during sleep (K. complexes). The vasoconstrictor response to sensory stimuli is a particularly sensitive one, present in both the waking and sleeping state. Variations in both these fields {{may or may not}} be accompanied by visible movements of the subject or by awakening. We have been interested in the relationships between the electrical activity of the brain (EEG) and the pulse volume waves (finger plethysmo-graphy), and have previously found that some of the variations in amplitude of the pulse volume waves (<b>vasoconstrictions)</b> are often preceded by changes in the EEG with a fairly constant time-interval (Ackner and Pampiglione, 1955). Previous studies had shown that there was a similarity between some "spontaneous " changes in the EEG during sleep and the EEG responses (K. complexes) which may be evoked by a sensory stimulus. (Loomis et al, 1938; Brazier, 1949; Pampiglione, 1953). Our studies revealed some relationship between spontaneous and evoked EEG and plethysmographic changes, and it seems likely that both the K. complexes and the <b>vasoconstrictions</b> represent common bodily responses to various, alerting stimuli (Ackner and Pampiglione, 1957). Repetition of the same stimulus during sleep in man, results in less constant or recognizable K. complexes (Pampiglione, 1952, 1953) and similar features have been demonstrated for the "arousal " reaction in the EEG of cats (Sharpless and Jasper, 1956).
