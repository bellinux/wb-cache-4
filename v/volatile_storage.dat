40|$|Abstract: Sender-based message logging allows each {{message to}} be logged in the <b>volatile</b> <b>storage</b> of its corre-sponding sender. This {{behavior}} avoids logging messages on the stable storage synchronously {{and results in}} lower failure-free overhead than receiver-based message logging. However, in the first approach, each process should keep in its limited <b>volatile</b> <b>storage</b> the log information of its sent messages for recovering their receivers. In this paper, we propose a 2 -step algorithm to efficiently remove logged messages from the <b>volatile</b> <b>storage</b> while en-suring the consistent recovery of the system in case of process failures. As the first step, the algorithm eliminates useless log information in the <b>volatile</b> <b>storage</b> with no extra message and forced checkpoint. But, even if the step has been performed, the more empty buffer space for logging messages in future may be required. In this case, the second step forces the useful log information to become useless by maintaining a vector to record {{the size of the}} information for every other process. This behavior incurs fewer additional messages and forced checkpoints than existing algorithms. Experimental results verify that our algorithm significantly performs better than the traditional one with respect to the garbage collection overhead...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the effects of temperature, moisture, and the relative size of storage headspace on emissions from wood pellets in an enclosed space. Twelve 10 -l plastic containers were used to study the effects of headspace ratio (25, 50, and 75 % of container volume) and temperatures (10 – 50 C). Another eight containers were set in uncontrolled storage relative hu-midity (RH) and temperature. Concentrations of CO 2, CO, and CH 4 were measured by gas chromatography (GC). The results showed that emissions of CO 2, CO, and CH 4 from stored wood pellets are more sensitive to storage temperature than to RH and the relative volume of headspace. Higher peak emission factors are associated with higher temperatures. Increased headspace volume ratio increases peak off-gas emissions because of the availability of oxygen associated with pellet decomposition. Increased RH in the enclosed container increases the rate of off-gas emissions of CO 2, CO, and CH 4 and oxygen depletion...|$|R

To this end, we develop analytical and simulation-based tools to evaluate the impact of system characteristics (e. g., bandwidth limitations on the durable and the volatile nodes) and design choices (e. g., the replica placement scheme) on data availability and the associated system costs (e. g., maintenance traffic). Moreover, to demonstrate the high-throughput properties of the proposed architecture, we prototype a GridFTP server based on ThriftStore.

This architecture exploits two opportunities: First, scavenging idle storage from LAN-connected desktops not only offers a low-cost storage space, but also high I/O throughput by aggregating the I/O channels of the participating nodes. Second, the two components of data reliability – durability and availability – can be decoupled to control overall system cost. To capitalize on these opportunities, we integrate two types of components: <b>volatile,</b> scavenged <b>storage</b> and dedicated, yet low-bandwidth durable storage.

The Santorini volcano (South Aegean Arc) is an ideal target to unravel these potential relationships as its history is marked by alternating episodes of edifice construction and caldera collapses and the chronostratigraphy is well constrained. We focused our study on the products of the four major, dominantly silicic, explosive eruptions of Santorini: the Lower Pumice 1 and 2 (200 to 180 ka; 1 st explosive cycle) and, the Cape Riva and the Minoan (~ 21 to 3 ka, 2 nd explosive cycle). In order to precisely define the P, T, fO 2, X (X for <b>volatiles)</b> <b>storage</b> conditions of the silicic magmas prior to these eruptions, we carried out a detailed micro-petrological and geochemical study on natural samples combined with an experimental work. The selected silicic components of the four eruptions are dacite to rhyodacite (SiO 2 = 67 - 70 wt. %) with similar mineral paragenesis (plagioclase, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene, ilmenite, magnetite, apatite ± pyrrhotite) and crystallinity < 20 %. High resolution BSE images of plagioclase and pyroxene phenocrysts and EMPA profiles reveal a complex crystallization history. Plagioclases display fine-scale oscillatory normal zoning, resorbtion zones where melt inclusions (MI) of rhyolitic compositions were trapped, and An-rich sieved cores. Clinopyroxenes also show zoning patterns and include rhyolitic MI. Both interstitial glass and MI are Cl-rich (~ 3000 ppm) while F and S are less abundant (F ≤ 700 ppm, S ≤ 100 ppm). Determination of H 2 O contents by SIMS is in progress at the CRPG-Nancy (previous measurements from the literature gave ~ 5 wt. % H 2 O in the Minoan rhyodacite and ~ 4 wt. % in the Lower Pumice 2). Ilmenite-magnetite geothermometry indicates temperatures ranging from ~ 850 to 900 °C and deltaNNO ~ - 1. For experimental work, the natural rocks were melted twice at 1400 °C and 1 atm; the resulting dry glasses were used as starting materials. Each composition was loaded in Au capsules as powdered glass together with known amounts of water and CO 2 (added as silver oxalate) keeping the XH 2 Oloaded [=moles of H 2 O/(H 2 O+CO 2) ] in the range 1 - 0. 6. We run crystallization experiments by using an Internally Heated Pressure Vessel (ISTO-CNRS) pressurised by an Ar-H 2 mixture.
