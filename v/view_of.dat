40|$|The {{importance}} of non-acoustical factors including {{the type of}} visual environment on human noise perception becomes increasingly recognized. In order to reveal the relationships between long-term noise annoyance and different types <b>of</b> neighborhood <b>views,</b> 2033 questionnaire responses were collected for studying the effect of perceptions of different combinations <b>of</b> <b>views</b> <b>of</b> sea, urban river, greenery, and/ or noise barrier on the annoyance responses from residents living in high-rise apartments in Hong Kong. The collected responses were employed to formulate a multivariate model to predict the probability of invoking a high annoyance response from residents. Results showed that <b>views</b> <b>of</b> sea, urban river, or greenery could lower the probability, while <b>views</b> <b>of</b> noise barrier could increase the probability. <b>Views</b> <b>of</b> greenery had a stronger noise moderation capability than <b>views</b> <b>of</b> sea or urban river. The presence of an interaction effect between <b>views</b> <b>of</b> water and <b>views</b> <b>of</b> noise barrier exerted a negative influence on the noise annoyance moderation capability. The probability due to exposure to an environment containing <b>views</b> <b>of</b> noise barriers and urban rivers would be even higher than that due to exposure to an environment containing <b>views</b> <b>of</b> noise barriers alone.
