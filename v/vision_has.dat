5|$|Most insects, except {{some species}} of cave crickets, {{are able to}} {{perceive}} light and dark. Many species have acute vision capable of detecting minute movements. The eyes may include simple eyes or ocelli as well as compound eyes of varying sizes. Many species are able to detect light in the infrared, ultraviolet and the visible light wavelengths. Color <b>vision</b> <b>has</b> been demonstrated in many species and phylogenetic analysis suggests that UV-green-blue trichromacy existed from at least the Devonian period between 416 and 359 million years ago.|$|E

30|$|These visions {{provide a}} unique {{opportunity}} to examine European citizen sentiments and values concerning the future because the citizen involvement methodology applied to create the visions and the format of the <b>visions</b> <b>have</b> been uniform in the conducted European involvement projects. The task of producing comprehensive analyses of the <b>visions</b> <b>has</b> however proven to be arduous. This is partly due to the rich character of the visions in the sense that each vision may relate to a number of topics, making the visions hard to categorise. Furthermore, an established methodology for analysing the <b>visions</b> <b>has</b> not emerged yet, which has prevented the analysis of visions across projects. Instead, the <b>visions</b> <b>have</b> been analysed inductively and qualitatively within each project, thus connecting the visions to project procedures rather than to comparative methodologies [9]. The lack of an established methodology for cross-project analysis has also prevented the reflection or the positioning of new sets of citizen visions against the previously produced ones.|$|R
25|$|The limited series The Last Avengers Story {{is set in}} an {{alternate}} future, where the <b>Vision</b> <b>has</b> two sons by the Scarlet Witch, who died in an accidental skirmish between the android and her brother Quicksilver.

25|$|According to Welch and Warren (1980), the Modality Appropriateness Hypothesis {{states that}} the {{influence}} of perception in each modality in multisensory integration depends on that modality's appropriateness for the given task. Thus, <b>vision</b> <b>has</b> a greater influence on integrated localization than hearing, and hearing and touch have a greater bearing on timing estimates than vision.|$|E

25|$|The myth of pirate night <b>vision</b> <b>has</b> {{no basis}} in fact. While it does take time for the human eye to adjust to optimum vision when {{switching}} between dark and brightly lit areas, {{there is no evidence}} to suggest that such a tactic was ever employed by pirates or anyone else. No naval combat manual or historical account of the era makes any reference to such tactics ever being used.|$|E
25|$|Isotretinoin {{is known}} to cause meibomian gland {{dysfunction}} which causes persistent keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eye). It has also been found to cause salivary gland dysfunction in some people, causing xerostomia (dry mouth). Problems with the meibomian and salivary glands are likely due to the non-selective apoptosis of {{the cells of the}} exocrine glands. Decreased night <b>vision</b> <b>has</b> been reported to persist in some patients after discontinuation of isotretinoin therapy.|$|E
25|$|M-theory {{is based}} on a {{quantitative}} theory of the ventral stream of visual cortex. Understanding how visual cortex works in object recognition is still a challenging task for neuroscience. Humans and primates are able to memorize and recognize objects after seeing just couple of examples unlike any state-of-the art machine vision systems that usually require a lot of data in order to recognize objects. Prior to the use of visual neuroscience in computer <b>vision</b> <b>has</b> been limited to early vision for deriving stereo algorithms (e.g.,) and to justify the use of DoG (derivative-of-Gaussian) filters and more recently of Gabor filters. No real attention has been given to biologically plausible features of higher complexity. While mainstream computer <b>vision</b> <b>has</b> always been inspired and challenged by human vision, it seems to have never advanced past the very first stages of processing in the simple cells in V1 and V2. Although some of the systems inspired - to various degrees - by neuroscience, have been tested on at least some natural images, neurobiological models of object recognition in cortex have not yet been extended to deal with real-world image databases.|$|E

25|$|Touch is the {{earliest}} sense {{to develop in}} the fetus. The development of an infant's haptic senses and how {{it relates to the}} development of the other senses such as <b>vision</b> <b>has</b> been the target of much research. Human babies have been observed to have enormous difficulty surviving if they do not possess a sense of touch, even if they retain sight and hearing. Infants who can perceive through touch, even without sight and hearing, tend to fare much better.|$|E
25|$|Some {{strands of}} {{computer}} vision research {{are closely related}} to the study of biological vision – indeed, just as many strands of AI research are closely tied with research into human consciousness, and the use of stored knowledge to interpret, integrate and utilize visual information. The field of biological vision studies and models the physiological processes behind visual perception in humans and other animals. Computer vision, on the other hand, studies and describes the processes implemented in software and hardware behind artificial vision systems. Interdisciplinary exchange between biological and computer <b>vision</b> <b>has</b> proven fruitful for both fields.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, new {{reports of}} miraculous images of Jesus had {{appeared}} and continue to receive significant attention, e.g. Secondo Pia's 1898 photograph of the Shroud of Turin, {{one of the most controversial}} artifacts in history, which during its May 2010 exposition it was visited by over 2 million people. Another 20th century depiction of Jesus, namely the Divine Mercy image based on Faustina Kowalska's reported <b>vision</b> <b>has</b> over 100 million followers. The first cinematic portrayal of Jesus was in the 1897 film La Passion du Christ produced in Paris, which lasted 5 minutes. Thereafter cinematic portrayals have continued to show Jesus with a beard in the standard western depiction that resembles traditional images.|$|E

25|$|Zia began reorienting Bangladesh's foreign policy, {{addressing}} {{the concerns of}} the mostly staunch rightists coupled with some renegade leftist who believed that Bangladesh was reliant on Indian economic and military aid. Zia moved away from India and the Soviet bloc, his predecessors' had worked with, developing closer relations with the United States and Western Europe, Africa and the Middle East. Zia also moved to harmonise ties with Saudi Arabia and the People's Republic of China, Pakistan's ally who had opposed Bangladesh's creation and had not recognised it until 1975. Zia moved to normalise relations with Pakistan. While distancing Bangladesh from India, Zia sought to improve ties with other Islamic nations. Zia's move towards Islamic state policies improved the nation's standing in the Middle East. Zia also proposed an organisation of the nations of South Asia to bolster economic and political co-operation at a regional level. This proposal materialised in 1985 under the Presidency of Hussain Muhammad Ershad with the first meeting of the South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation in Dhaka. Zia's <b>vision</b> <b>has</b> earned him a posthumous award from the organisation.|$|E
25|$|They are nocturnal piscivorous drift-hunters. The body {{is covered}} in cosmoid scales that act as armor. Coelacanths have eight fins – 2 dorsal fins, 2 {{pectoral}} fins, 2 pelvic fins, 1 anal fin and 1 caudal fin. The tail is very nearly equally proportioned and is split by a terminal tuft of fin rays that make up its caudal lobe. The eyes of the coelacanth are very large, while the mouth is very small. The eye is acclimatized to seeing in poor light by rods that absorb mostly short wavelengths. Coelacanth <b>vision</b> <b>has</b> evolved to a mainly blue-shifted color capacity. Pseudomaxillary folds surround the mouth and replace the maxilla, a structure absent in coelacanths. Two nostrils, along with four other external openings, appear between the premaxilla and lateral rostral bones. The nasal sacs resemble those of many other fish and do not contain an internal nostril. The coelacanth's rostral organ, contained within the ethmoid region of the braincase, has three unguarded openings into the environment and {{is used as a}} part of the coelacanth's laterosensory system. The coelacanth's auditory reception is mediated by its inner ear, which is very similar to that of tetrapods because it is classified as being a basilar papilla.|$|E
