Twenty-four children with ASD as well as 25 age-matched typically developing (TD) children observed <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> of either yawning or control mouth movements. Yawning <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> elicited more yawns in TD children than in children with ASD, but the frequency of yawns did not differ between groups when they observed control <b>video</b> <b>clips.</b> Moreover, TD children yawned more during or after the yawn <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> than the control <b>video</b> <b>clips,</b> but the type of <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> did not affect the amount of yawning in children with ASD. Current results suggest that contagious yawning is impaired in ASD, which may relate to their impairment in empathy. It supports the claim that contagious yawning is based on the capacity for empathy...|$|R
40|$|We live in {{the time}} when we are exposed to modern {{information}} technology on a daily basis. It is really important for teachers to adapt their lessons and teaching methods by facilitating the information and communication technology (ICT) development. The use of new technologies is namely not new to the students as they learn it at a very young age. This graduation thesis discusses the use of <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> in chemistry classroom as the curriculum for chemistry in primary school does itself encourage the use of ICT (which also includes the use of <b>video</b> <b>clips).</b> The aim of the thesis was also to verify to what extent chemistry teachers in Slovenian primary schools use <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> as part of their lessons. We also wanted to find out how <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> are incorporated in the lesson plans and what the connection between students’ knowledge and the use of <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> is. We were interested in finding out whether the use of <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> in chemistry classroom affects the level of knowledge and the comprehension of chemical principles. Primary school teachers often use <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> taken from the Internet, for example, YouTube, and these are usually in English and not in the Slovenian language. That is why the thesis also relates to the modern teaching approach Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) and how the language of schooling and how English as a foreign language affects students in <b>video</b> <b>clips.</b> Our study showed that chemistry teachers often include <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> in their lessons, which has positive effects on students’ knowledge. We not only concluded that the use of <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> in foreign language (English) has no negative influences on students’ understanding of chemical principles but also improves their foreign language skills. ...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, MCA is {{performed}} to extract affective cues from different music <b>video</b> <b>clips.</b> The inference of evoked emotions in music videos {{can be regarded}} as a better formulated problem than emotion detection in movies, in the following sense: in movies, the perceived emotions are mostly depending on the scenario, the high-level semantics and the speech, which is usually the predominant component. Music usually has a more limited role in movies, used in certain scenes throughout the movie to evoke or enhance particular emotions. On the contrary, in music <b>videos</b> <b>clips,</b> emotions are much more dependent on the characteristics of the audio and video than on the plot or the semantics of the speech. Furthermore, this paper deals with emotions contained in the music <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> and not the emotions induced in the participants while watching music <b>video</b> <b>clips.</b> In our previous paper [11]], we investigated the latter approach, i.e., the possibility of inferring emotional states induced in individual users while watching music <b>video</b> <b>clips.</b> However, in the current paper, we are interested in the emotional characterization of music <b>video</b> <b>clips.</b>|$|R
3000|$|The music <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> used in {{this study}} were taken from the Database for Emotion Analysis using Physiological Signals (DEAP; [URL] [5]]. For {{selection}} of emotional music <b>video</b> <b>clips,</b> a web-based subjective test was conducted, where subjects were asked to watch 120 music <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> and rate their perceived emotion. More precisely, the subjects used a discrete nine-point scale to rate the following: valence, with the range going from unhappy or sad to happy or joyful; arousal, with the range going from calm or bored to stimulated or excited; dominance, with the range going from submissive or ‘without control’ to dominant or ‘in control, empowered’; and whether they liked the video or not. Using these subjective data, 40 music <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> were selected so that only the music <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> which induce strong emotions are used. More precisely, ten music <b>video</b> <b>clips</b> from each quadrant or arousal-valence space, which all had the strongest possible volunteer ratings with a small variation, were selected.

5|$|A {{sequel to}} Kameo was in {{production}} but was ultimately canceled. George Andreas {{began work on}} the sequel after finishing the first game. Kameo 2 {{was designed to be}} a darker take on the original. Rare redesigned Kameo to have smaller eyes and matured the other creatures. For instance, the trolls were given steampunk designs. The sequel put a heavier emphasis on the open world, as the team was influenced by Assassin's Creed (2007). Rare began to use Havok physics software for smoother inverse kinematics animations, and planned to incorporate assets from an unreleased game, Black Widow, which featured a giant, mechanical spider. For creature upgrades, the team planned to let Kameo fly as an eagle so the player could experience the grandeur of a bird's-eye view. Kameo composer Steve Burke said that he worked on the sequel for a year. He wrote several new audio tracks in a Celtic style and recorded voiceovers, which together were used in a concept demo pitched to Microsoft. The project was canceled after about three months of production as Rare re-focused on Microsoft's Kinect effort. At the time, Microsoft redirected its internal studios to support the project. The original's lackluster sales also contributed to the cancelation. The public had heard reports of its cancelation during the 2009 restructure and had seen an artwork leak in 2011, but the cancelation was not confirmed until Microsoft Studios vice president Phil Spencer did so in 2013. 1UP.com questioned whether Kameo needed a sequel at all. Rare released a retrospective documentary of the unreleased game as part of its August 2015 Rare Replay collection. A Kameo 2 concept artist narrated the documentary, which focuses on art that would have been included in the game apart from a brief <b>video</b> <b>clip.</b> Rare later released a follow-up making-of Kameo video in March 2016. The sequel's video did not elaborate on why Microsoft canceled the project.|$|E
