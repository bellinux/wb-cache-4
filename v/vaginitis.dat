5|$|In {{women with}} {{cervicitis}} (inflammation of the cervix) or <b>vaginitis</b> (inflammation of the vagina) and in {{young men with}} UTI symptoms, a Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrheae infection may be the cause. These infections are typically classified as a urethritis rather than a urinary tract infection. <b>Vaginitis</b> may also {{be due to a}} yeast infection. Interstitial cystitis (chronic pain in the bladder) may be considered for people who experience multiple episodes of UTI symptoms but urine cultures remain negative and not improved with antibiotics. Prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) may also be considered in the differential diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|While {{defended by}} those {{cultures}} {{in which it}} constitutes a tradition, FGC is opposed by many medical and cultural organizations {{on the grounds that}} it is unnecessary and harmful. Short term health effects may include hemorrhage, infection, sepsis, and even result in death, while long term effects include dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, <b>vaginitis</b> and cystitis. In addition FGC leads to complications with pregnancy, labor and delivery. Reversal (defibulation) by skilled personnel may be required to open the scarred tissue. Amongst those opposing the practice are local grassroots groups, and national and international organisations including WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA and Amnesty International. Legislative efforts to ban FGC have rarely been successful and the preferred approach is education and empowerment and the provision of information about the adverse health effects as well the human rights aspects.|$|E
25|$|Another type of <b>vaginitis,</b> called desquamative {{inflammatory}} <b>vaginitis</b> (DIV) also exists. The cause {{behind this}} type is still poorly understood. DIV {{corresponds to the}} severe forms of aerobic <b>vaginitis.</b> About 5 to 10% of women are affected by aerobic <b>vaginitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|DES (in tablets up to 5mg) was {{approved}} by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on September 19, 1941 for four indications: gonorrheal <b>vaginitis,</b> atrophic <b>vaginitis,</b> menopausal symptoms, and postpartum lactation suppression to prevent breast engorgement. The gonorrheal <b>vaginitis</b> indication was dropped when the antibiotic penicillin became available. From its very inception, the drug was highly controversial.|$|E
25|$|Hormonal <b>vaginitis</b> {{includes}} atrophic <b>vaginitis</b> {{usually found}} in postmenopausal or postpartum women. Sometimes it {{can occur in}} young girls before puberty. In these situations the estrogen support of the vagina is poor.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} infections, {{diseases}} and disorders {{that can affect}} the vagina, including candidal vulvovaginitis, <b>vaginitis,</b> vaginismus, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or cancer. <b>Vaginitis</b> is an inflammation of the vagina, and is attributed to several vaginal diseases, while vaginismus is an involuntary tightening of the vagina muscles caused by a conditioned reflex, or disease, during vaginal penetration. HIV/AIDS, human papillomavirus (HPV), genital herpes and trichomoniasis {{are some of the}} STIs that may affect the vagina, and health sources recommend safe sex (or barrier method) practices to prevent the transmission of these and other STIs.|$|E
25|$|Irritant <b>vaginitis</b> can {{be caused}} by allergies to condoms, spermicides, soaps, perfumes, douches, lubricants, and semen. It can also be caused by hot tubs, abrasion, tissue, tampons, or topical medications.|$|E
25|$|Other {{less common}} infections {{are caused by}} gonorrhea, chlamydia, Mycoplasma, herpes, Campylobacter, {{improper}} hygiene, and some parasites, notably Trichomonas vaginalis. Women who have diabetes develop infectious <b>vaginitis</b> more often than women who do not.|$|E
25|$|Foreign body <b>vaginitis</b> (most common {{foreign bodies}} are {{retained}} tampons or condoms) may cause extremely malodorous vaginal discharges. Treatment consists of removal, for which ring forceps may be useful. Further treatment {{is generally not}} necessary.|$|E
25|$|Child {{sexual abuse}} may cause infections and sexually {{transmitted}} diseases. Due {{to a lack}} of sufficient vaginal fluid, chances of infections can heighten depending on the age and size of the child. <b>Vaginitis</b> has also been reported.|$|E
25|$|The {{involvement}} of MC1R in a rat model of Candida albicans <b>vaginitis</b> was investigated. These authors suggest that MC1R {{is important in}} anti-fungal and anti-inflammatory processes, in part because siRNA knockdown of MC1R almost completely prevented the responses.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vaginitis,</b> {{also known}} as vaginal {{infection}} and vulvovaginitis, is an inflammation of the vagina and possible vulva. It can result in discharge, itching and pain, and {{is often associated with}} an irritation or infection of the vulva. Infected women may also be asymptomatic.|$|E
25|$|Prasterone, {{under the}} brand name Intrarosa, is {{approved}} in the United States in a vaginal insert formulation {{for the treatment of}} atrophic <b>vaginitis</b> (vaginal atrophy). The mechanism of action of prasterone for this indication is unknown, though it may involve local metabolism of prasterone into androgens and estrogens.|$|E
25|$|Prevention of candidiasis, {{the most}} common type of <b>vaginitis,</b> {{includes}} using loose cotton underwear. The vaginal area should be washed with water. Perfumed soaps, shower gels, and vaginal deodorants should be avoided. Douching is not recommended. The practice upsets the normal balance of yeast in the vagina and does more harm than good.|$|E
25|$|Some women consume good {{bacteria}} in food with live culture, such as yogurt, sauerkraut and kimchi, or in probiotic supplements either {{to try to}} prevent candidiasis, or to reduce the likelihood of developing bacterial <b>vaginitis</b> following antibiotic treatment. There is no firm evidence to suggest that eating live yogurt or taking probiotic supplements will prevent candidiasis.|$|E
25|$|Further, {{either a}} change in pH balance or {{introduction}} of foreign bacteria in the vagina can lead to infectious <b>vaginitis.</b> Physical factors that have been claimed {{to contribute to the}} development of infections include the following: constantly wet vulva due to tight clothing, chemicals coming in contact with the vagina via scented tampons, antibiotics, birth control pills, or a diet favoring refined sugar and yeast.|$|E
25|$|It {{is usually}} due to infection. The three main kinds of <b>vaginitis</b> are {{bacterial}} vaginosis (BV), vaginal candidiasis, and trichomoniasis. A woman {{may have a}} combination of vaginal infections at one time. Testing for vaginal infections is {{not a part of}} routine pelvic exams. If there is discomfort in the vulvovaginal area, women can request their health care providers evaluate for the presence of an infection.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Vaginitis</b> is the {{disruption}} of the healthy vaginal microbiota. The vaginal microbiota consists of those organisms which generally do not cause symptoms, infections, and results in good pregnancy outcomes, and is dominated mainly by Lactobacillus species. The disruption of the normal microbiota can cause a vaginal yeast infection. [...] Vaginal yeast infection can affect {{women of all ages}} and is very common.

2500|$|In {{women who}} have had a hysterectomy, an {{estrogen}} is usually given without any progesterone, a therapy referred to as [...] "unopposed estrogen therapy". HRT may be delivered to the body via patches, tablets, creams, troches, IUDs, vaginal rings, gels or, more rarely, by injection. For example, vaginally administered estrogens include those given by intravaginal tablets, creams and rings, and can have more effect on atrophic <b>vaginitis</b> with fewer systemic effects than estrogens delivered by other means.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{side-effects}} include loss {{of balance}} or coordination; double vision; crossed eyes; pupil constriction; blurred vision; dizziness {{and lack of}} coordination; drowsiness, insomnia; anxiety; vivid dreams or nightmares; dry mouth, mouth ulcers; [...] memory problems; mood changes; itchiness; runny nose; cough; nausea, indigestion, abdominal pain, weight loss; missed or painful menstrual periods; and <b>vaginitis.</b> The side-effect profile varies for different patient populations. Overall adverse effects in treatment are similar between men, women, geriatric, pediatric and racial groups.|$|E
2500|$|Most people {{infected}} with trichomonas vaginalis {{do not have}} any symptoms and can be undetected for years. Symptoms experienced include pain, burning or itching in the penis, urethra (urethritis), or vagina (<b>vaginitis).</b> Discomfort for both sexes may increase during intercourse and urination. For women there may also be a yellow-green, itchy, frothy, foul-smelling ("fishy" [...] smell) vaginal discharge. In rare cases, lower abdominal pain can occur. Symptoms usually appear within 5 to 28 days of exposure.|$|E
2500|$|The {{person who}} was raped may already have a sexually {{transmitted}} bacterial, viral and other infections and if diagnosed, it is treated. Prophylactic antibiotic treatment for <b>vaginitis,</b> gonorrhea, trichomoniasis and chlamydia may be done.

50|$|<b>Vaginitis</b> is {{inflammation}} of the vagina and largely caused by an infection. It {{is the most common}} gynaecological condition presented. It is difficult to determine any one organism most responsible for <b>vaginitis</b> because it varies from range of age, sexual activity, and method of microbial identification. <b>Vaginitis</b> is not necessarily caused by a sexually transmitted infection as there are many infectious agents that make use of the close proximity to mucous membranes and secretions. <b>Vaginitis</b> is usually diagnosed based on the presence of vaginal discharge, which can have a certain color, odor, or quality.|$|E
