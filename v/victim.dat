5|$|An assault is {{not caused}} if a {{defendant}} threatens {{to shoot the}} <b>victim,</b> but the <b>victim</b> is aware that the gun is not loaded or fake. However, {{it would be the}} actus reus of an assault if the <b>victim</b> wrongly believes the gun is, or may be, loaded. Since assault is a summary offence, no prosecutions take place for attempted assault. However, it is possible to commit attempts of aggravated forms of assault.|$|E

50|$|NGOs {{expressed}} concern that the national referral mechanism was disproportionately focused on prosecuting trafficking offenders rather than assisting <b>victims.</b> The government significantly increased the number of identified <b>victims</b> during the reporting period: law enforcement officials identified 60 <b>victims</b> in 2009 and referred 22 of them to NGOs for assistance, compared with 34 <b>victims</b> identified and 20 referred for assistance in 2008.

5|$|Although immobilizing a <b>victim</b> {{in front}} of a gun before firing the cannon {{is by far the most}} {{reported}} method, a case from Istanbul in 1596 alleges that the <b>victim</b> was actually put into the gun and executed in that manner.

5|$|An {{attacker}} having gained authentication material may impersonate the material's owner {{after the}} <b>victim</b> has patched Heartbleed, {{as long as}} the material is accepted (for example, until the password is changed or the private key revoked).

40|$|Abstract: Repeat <b>victims</b> in the West report crimes {{more often}} than other <b>victims</b> {{in order to see}} the {{offender}} arrested and/or to stop what is happening. Repeat <b>victims</b> know or assume that the same offender(s) are victimising them again and again. Repeat <b>victims</b> contact the police with more demanding aims than other <b>victims.</b> The reporting patterns of repeat <b>victims</b> in the West resemble those of all <b>victims</b> in poorer countries. Like the <b>victims</b> in these countries, Western repeat <b>victims</b> are less inclined to report at all. This finding suggests that they are less certain that the police can satisfy their needs. Repeat <b>victims</b> in the West do not refrain from reporting because they consider their victimisation not serious enough. They are more likely than one-time <b>victims</b> to refrain because they feel the police could not or would not do anything to help them. In this respect, too, they resemble <b>victims</b> from poorer countries. Repeat <b>victims</b> are less often satisfied with the police response in all regions. The differences are most pronounced among <b>victims</b> from industrialised countries. The reduced level of satisfaction of repeat <b>victims</b> with overall police performance is rooted in negative personal experiences with the police.

A questionnaire was then used to assess perceptions of support for IPV <b>victims,</b> which was completed by 121 participants. Results indicated that females were supported more than males and that drawing attention to male <b>victims</b> did not decrease participants’ support for female <b>victims.</b> An exploratory analysis also revealed that women, overall, have high support for all <b>victims,</b> while men’s level of support changed {{depending on the type}} of information to which they were exposed...|$|R

50|$|The {{government}} sustained impressive {{efforts to}} provide care for trafficking <b>victims</b> during the reporting period. In 2007, Spain increased funding to anti-trafficking NGOs providing care to <b>victims.</b> Spain {{does not have a}} formal mechanism for referring <b>victims</b> to service providers; however, Spanish police continued informally to refer rescued <b>victims</b> to NGOs providing temporary shelter and rehabilitation services. <b>Victims</b> receive medical assistance, including emergency care, through the national health care system. The police identified 1,035 sex trafficking <b>victims</b> and 445 labor trafficking <b>victims</b> in 2007. The government encourages foreign <b>victims</b> to assist in trafficking investigations and prosecutions by providing work and residence permits to <b>victims</b> choosing to assist, giving them the option of either permanent residence status or funding to return to their own countries after the prosecution. There is no indication that <b>victims</b> are inappropriately incarcerated, fined, or penalized for unlawful acts committed {{as a direct result of}} being trafficked. Spain does not employ formal procedures for identifying <b>victims</b> among vulnerable groups, such as women in prostitution.|$|R

The law provides that foreign <b>victims</b> were eligible to benefit from a 90-day reflection period {{to remain in the}} country and decide whether they would like to cooperate in a criminal proceeding; however in practice, no foreign <b>victims</b> used this reflection period. The law permits foreign <b>victims</b> to request a temporary residence permit and remain in the country until completion of the trafficking investigation and prosecution; in 2009, no foreign <b>victims</b> applied for and received temporary residence permits.|$|R

50|$|The government-run {{trafficking}} hotline referred nine <b>victims</b> to NGOs {{for assistance}} last year, a decrease from 50 <b>victims</b> referred by the hotline in 2008. Law enforcement and consular officials identified approximately 30 <b>victims</b> domestically and abroad in 2009, compared with 26 in 2008. Both {{law enforcement and}} NGOs were often unaware or uncertain about what services <b>victims</b> of trafficking were eligible to receive; this lack of awareness may have limited the number of <b>victims</b> assisted during the reporting period. <b>Victims</b> were not penalized for unlawful acts committed {{as a direct result}} of being trafficked and there were no reported cases of authorities’ mistreatment of trafficking <b>victims.</b> The government encouraged <b>victims</b> to assist with trafficking investigations and prosecutions; in 2009, twenty-seven <b>victims</b> assisted in the investigation and prosecution of trafficking cases. The government offered foreign <b>victims</b> a 30-day reflection period to decide whether to assist law enforcement; however, no foreign <b>victims</b> applied for or received the 30-day temporary residency permits in 2009. NGOs expressed concern that Hungarian <b>victims</b> were not provided with a reflection period to receive assistance and decide whether or not to assist law enforcement; instead, Hungarian <b>victims</b> were required to decide upon identification whether or not they wanted to assist law enforcement. Foreign <b>victims</b> may apply for a six-month temporary residency permit if they choose to cooperate with law enforcement.|$|R

50|$|The {{government}} made modest improvements to protect <b>victims</b> of trafficking during the year. Police and prosecutors relied chiefly on civil society partners, particularly a recently established NGO, the Trafficking-in-Persons Foundation, to shelter and assist <b>victims.</b> The government assisted these NGOs with finding safe houses to shelter <b>victims,</b> and {{worked closely with}} consular representatives from other countries on repatriation efforts. The government also extended services provided to domestic violence <b>victims</b> to trafficking <b>victims,</b> and widely distributed among key personnel an operations manual on how to identify and treat trafficking <b>victims.</b> Surinamese authorities encourage <b>victims</b> {{to assist in the}} investigation and prosecution of their traffickers. There were reports that some foreign <b>victims</b> were incarcerated and deported for immigration violations. Suriname does not provide legal alternatives to the removal of foreign <b>victims</b> to countries where they face hardship or retribution.
