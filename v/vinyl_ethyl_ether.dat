To this end, the reactivity of 1 -pentene, 1 -pentyne, <b>vinyl</b> <b>ethyl</b> <b>ether,</b> and vinyl ethyl sulfide toward H–Si(111) and the surface coverage of the resulting monolayers were studied and compared. All modified surfaces were characterized by static water contact angle measurements, ellipsometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and infrared absorption reflection spectroscopy (IRRAS). Quantum chemical calculations were performed to calculate the activation barriers and driving forces for monolayer formation at the M 11 -L/ 6 - 311 G(d,p) level of theory.

40|$|CO 2 {{injection}} is {{an effective}} method for performing enhanced oil recovery (EOR). There are several factors that make CO 2 useful for EOR, including promoting swelling, reducing oil viscosity, decreasing oil density, and vaporizing and extracting portions of crude oil. Moreover, {{the ease with which}} CO 2 becomes soluble in oil makes it an ideal gas for EOR operations. However, there are several problems associated with CO 2 flooding, especially when reservoir heterogeneity exists. The efficiency of CO 2 is hindered by mobility problems, which result from the unfavorable mobility ratio. In such cases, the injected CO 2 leads to an early breakthrough, which means fingering through the target zone occurs while leaving most of the residual and/or trapped oil untouched. Furthermore, an increase in the CO 2 to oil ratio makes the EOR project uneconomical. However, if there are techniques available to control the injected CO 2 volume, the problems just mentioned can be resolved. Nowadays, several methods are applied to control the CO 2 flooding in heterogeneous porous media. In the present study, the CO 2 coreflood system was integrated with a computed tomography (CT) scanner and obtained real-time coreflood images of the CO 2 saturation distribution in the core sample. Throughout this study, two polymers, Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and Poly (<b>vinyl</b> <b>ethyl</b> <b>ether)</b> (PVEE), were tested to assess their ability to increase the CO 2 viscosity and therefore improve sweep efficiency. A drop-in pressure test was first conducted to evaluate the viscosifier's ability to increase CO 2 viscosity; therefore, reduce its mobility. The results showed that the PDMS polymer has the greatest influence on increasing the CO 2 viscosity and reducing its mobility. Also, the PVEE polymer has lower mobility than that of neat CO 2. Based on the coreflood experiments, injection of viscosified CO 2 using the PDMS polymer resulted in the highest oil recovery among the other injection tests have been conducted. Also, the laboratory tests show that injecting the viscosified CO 2 using the PVEE polymer led to higher oil recovery than from the neat CO 2 injection. This research serves as a preliminary study in understanding advanced CO 2 mobility control using the thickening agents technique and will provide an insight into the future studies on the topic...|$|E
