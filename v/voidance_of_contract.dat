Education is a necessary conditional character of human existence and one of preconditions of a way how this existence will be brought to life by human. Education for democracy is opportunity for its participants, often genuine opportunity, to meet concrete issues of historical situation. It leads to understanding and free will to open humanity for core democratic principles as responsibility, liberty and freedom, tolerance and respect, personal commitment. These principles are issuing from values and systems of values that represent our relations to the world. Axiological dimension is together with cognitive skills necessary postulate of education for democracy.

50|$|In England, {{where the}} abuse of provisors had been most acutely felt, the matter was dealt with during the vacancy of the Holy See between the {{deposition}} of Antipope John XXIII at Constance (May 1415) and the election of Pope Martin V (November 1417). During the interval the only possible way of appointing a bishop was by the ancient method of canonical election and confirmation. Shortly after the deposition of John XXIII, Henry V of England assented to an ordinance that during the <b>voidance</b> <b>of</b> the Holy See bishops elect should be confirmed by their metropolitans; but the ordinance was not recorded on the Statute Roll. Three bishops only, namely: John Chandler (or Cjaaundeler), Bishop of Salisbury; Edmund Lacey, Bishop of Hereford; and John Wakering, Bishop of Norwich, were confirmed by Henry Chichele, Archbishop of Canterbury during the papal vacancy. When Martin V was elected pope in 1417 he resumed the practice of providing bishops, and from this time until the English Reformation the canonical election and confirmation of a bishop in England was a rare exception.|$|R
40|$|In spaceflight conditions, {{plants are}} {{subjected}} {{to a variety of}} environmental stresses which may promote microbial growth and potential pathogenicity. Among the changes that may occur in the plant is a decrease in freely available carbohydrates, resulting in the microbe having to look for alternative carbon sources. A seed-borne fungal endophyte, an Acremonium species, was identified as the symptom-causing agent in Super Dwarf seedlings grown in a spaceflight mission in 1995. Plants bearing the endophyte grew without symptoms in the greenhouse in open conditions. The isolated Acremonium grew well on different carbohydrates available in wheat leaf apoplastic fluids as well as isolated wheat leaf cell walls and a common component of plant walls, pectin. Invertase, an enzyme that degrades sucrose, a major carbon molecule transported in plants, was detected in Acremonium grown in sucrose medium. The requirement of sucrose for invertase induction by sucrose and growth of Acremonium on isolated wheat leaf cell walls suggest that the fungus may turn to degradation of the plant cell wall when the plant becomes stressed. A <b>voidance</b> <b>of</b> plant stress during spaceflight may help the plants defend themselves against pathogens...|$|R

The actual content of the ballet, although unusual, somewhat reflects everyday life (including particular local Belgrade neighborhoods and spots like Dorćol and Mažestik) and certain composer’s formal interventions created a hybrid form—e.g., the narrator who intervenes in the plot and among the ballet dancers, as well as jazz elements and a jazz band on the stage. The event when the Poet declares “Alone on the stage,” potentially leads toward the <b>voidance</b> <b>of</b> distinction between performers and audience as an exit from the work itself, its self-relativization, and as an anticipation of a significant element of contemporary theatre in general. A remarkable ballet scene {{takes place at the}} very end, when during a true ironic shift the Poet kills the Felo-de-se in a tavern (kafana), over glum sonorities of the authentic kafana music, lacking tragedy, in other words routinely, but also lacking the gravity that could possibly hinder the work’s imposed vaudeville character.

It begins with an introductory discussion of scope and methodology, and then addresses four main topics that correspond to the major doctrinal divisions of the law <b>of</b> <b>contracts.</b> These divisions include freedom <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> (the extent <b>of</b> private power to create binding obligations), formation <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> (the procedural mechanics of exchange, and the rules that govern pre-contractual behavior), contract interpretation (the consequences that follow when agreements are ambiguous or incomplete), and enforcement of contractual obligations (the choice between private and public enforcement, and the legal remedies that follow from breach <b>of</b> <b>contract).</b> In each <b>of</b> these sections, we provide an economic analysis of relevant legal rules and institutions, and of the connections between legal arrangements and corresponding topics in microeconomic theory, such as welfare economics and the theory <b>of</b> <b>contracts.</b> freedom <b>of</b> <b>contract,</b> Coase Theorem, contract formation, incomplete <b>contracts,</b> breach <b>of</b> <b>contract,</b> remedies for breach...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} in this dissertation investigates the impact of pacta sunt servanda in the South African law <b>of</b> <b>contract.</b> The notion that agreements seriously entered into must be honoured is an age-old principle which has found recognition in South African law. The common law foundational principles <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> law are explained {{and the impact of}} the Constitution on these principles is analysed. The Constitution is the highest law in the land and all law, including the common law, must conform to it. The cornerstones of the South African law <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> are good faith, freedom <b>of</b> <b>contract,</b> sanctity <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> and privity <b>of</b> <b>contract.</b> The competing common law foundational values are discussed with particular emphasis on the principles <b>of</b> sanctity <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> and freedom <b>of</b> <b>contract.</b> The notion <b>of</b> freedom <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> is a constitutionally recognised principle which is associated with party autonomy and denotes minimal state interference. Pacta sunt servanda states that obligations created in terms of an agreement must be honoured; therefore parties who enter into contractual agreements with the relevant intention are obliged to respect the agreement. There are many dimensions to a contract which affect its meaning as a legal instrument, apart from the legal dimension there is also a structural dimension <b>of</b> <b>contracts.</b> With regards to the structural dimension, the interpretation and the drafting <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> is relevant because this is the process by which the agreement between the parties is codified and interpreted. In order for the principle of pacta sunt servanda to operate successfully in contractual agreements, the written contract must clearly indicate the intention of the parties. In this research both interpretation and drafting <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> will be examined to identify their impact on the principle of pacta sunt servanda. Pacta sunt servanda influences the interpretation and drafting <b>of</b> <b>contracts</b> and must therefore always be considered when executing contractual agreements. The case law in this research highlights the fact that courts are in favour of contractual validity and have accepted pacta sunt servanda as a cemented principle in the South African law <b>of</b> <b>contract.</b> Mini Dissertation (LLM) [...] University of Pretoria, 2016.

40|$|Within our commercialised market society, {{contractual}} relationships are objectified and valued in monetary terms. This {{raises the question}} of the transferability <b>of</b> <b>contracts.</b> Transfer <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> implies a substitution of one the existing contractual parties. It intends the transfer of the entire contractual position of the transferor to a third party, as a result of which the latter would fully replace the transferor, who is completely discharged from the contractual relationship. An important advantage is that the transfer <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> upholds the identity of the contractual relationship and thus maintains that relationship with all its securities and defences. The term <b>of</b> the <b>contract</b> and any prescription which has commenced, will continue to run and the contract will in principle be governed by the law as applied {{at the time of its}} conclusion. In Belgian and French law a general theory <b>of</b> transfer <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> is lacking. Not only the possibility of a full substitution of a contractual party, but also the requirements for the conclusion of the transfer <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> and its consequences are highly debated. Moreover, the distinction between a transfer <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> and a transfer of contractual rights/debts is unclear. The research therefore envisages to develop a general legal regime for the transfer <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> ut singuli. The first part of the research is a conceptual analysis of the possibility of a transfer <b>of</b> <b>contract.</b> It focuses on the concept of contractual relationship/contractual position as distinct from the concept of contractual right or contractual debt/ obligation. Subsequently, the transfer <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> is considered as a (subjective) modification of the contractual relationship.

40|$|The 19 th century saw the {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> law {{based on the}} idea <b>of</b> freedom <b>of</b> <b>contract.</b> The influence <b>of</b> free market economy and laissez-faire contributed to the idea that individuals should be left free to make private arrangements. The 20 th century saw great social and economic change, which heralded a swing away from the classic theory <b>of</b> freedom <b>of</b> <b>contract.</b> During this period it began to be realized that the notion of freedom of choice rested on many uncertain and fragile assumptions.
