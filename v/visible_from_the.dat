5|$|The nearby 19th century house, Stonelands also formed {{part of the}} estate, so Repton {{ensured that}} it would be <b>visible</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> parkland. Stonelands no longer forms part of the estate, but is still <b>visible</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> park and wood. Towards the end of the 19th century, the house's park land was open to the public on certain days of the week by Peter Arthur Marsham Hoare, however this {{practice}} had ended by 1902. The grounds were still regularly opened for events such as fetes, the Dawlish flower show, as well as opening the gardens to the public.|$|E
5|$|A typical keep {{would have}} {{between three and}} seven stories {{discernible}} from the outside. Its inner structure including the number of floors could differ from the outward appearance. Castle towers at Himeji, Inuyama, Matsue and Matsumoto Castle have one floor more than is <b>visible</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> outside.|$|E
5|$|Also <b>visible</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{circle is}} a scatter of over thirty stones on the Westwater Allotment; these {{are up to}} 0.5m (1.6 feet) long, with two {{reported}} as being standing in 1988. Elsewhere on Withypool Common {{is a collection of}} six stones arranged in a roughly circular fashion, which may have represented another stone circle or perhaps the kerbstones from a since-destroyed round cairn.|$|E

5|$|Although not {{typically}} seen by viewers, the set {{also includes a}} used letter board that shows contestants which letters are remaining in play, a scoreboard that is <b>visible</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> contestants' perspective, and a countdown clock. The used letter board is also used during the bonus round, and {{in at least one}} case, helped the contestant to see unused letters to solve a difficult puzzle.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the stacks}} are <b>visible</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{floor of the}} central hall, {{the layout of the}} library is clear to the visitor at a glance, {{which was one of the}} goals the Academy's {{building}} committee had set for Kahn.|$|E
5|$|Given {{that the}} {{matching}} vocabulary and astronomical content {{is drawn from}} throughout Polynesia, far afield from Easter Island, this supports the argument that rongorongo was not a recent, localized development; rather it {{was a product of}} thriving Polynesian trade and cultural interaction throughout the Pacific. There is additional evidence in favor of this theory, such as the identification of Polaris among the glyphs, which is only <b>visible</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> northern hemisphere.|$|E
50|$|The {{impressive}} façade was <b>visible</b> <b>from</b> even <b>the</b> harbor. Today {{just one}} foundation wall remains.|$|R

50|$|At {{the top of}} the {{building}} a large, solar-powered lamp <b>visible</b> <b>from</b> across <b>the</b> city was planned.|$|R
5|$|Newsom also {{supported}} allowing restaurants to serve alcohol at their outdoor tables, banning tobacco advertisements <b>visible</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> streets, stiffer penalties for landlords, and {{a resolution to}} commend Colin Powell for raising money for youth programs that was defeated. Newsom's support for business interests at times strained his relationship with labor leaders.|$|E
5|$|Sebaceous glands {{are first}} <b>visible</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 13th to the 16th week of fetal development, as bulgings off hair follicles. Sebaceous glands develop {{from the same}} tissue that {{gives rise to the}} {{epidermis}} of the skin. Overexpression of the signalling factors Wnt, Myc and SHH all increase the likelihood of sebaceous gland presence.|$|E
5|$|The {{church of}} Santa Maria in Aracoeli is {{adjacent}} to the square, located near where the ancient arx, or citadel, atop the hill it once stood. At its base are {{the remains of a}} Roman insula, with more than four storeys <b>visible</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> street.|$|E

5|$|The station's pictogram, {{a pair of}} mountains, depict Mount Baker and Mount Rainier (both <b>visible</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> station). It {{was created}} by Christian French {{as part of the}} Stellar Connections series and its points {{represent}} nearby destinations, including Franklin High School, the former site of Sick's Stadium, Colman Park, Cheasty Boulevard, and Mount Baker Park.|$|E
5|$|The travelogues of {{the later}} 19th century in turn further contributed to the {{elaboration}} and propagation of the Great Wall myth. Examples of this myth's growth are the false but widespread belief that the Great Wall of China is <b>visible</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Moon or Mars.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} four tracks {{underneath}} this station, {{which are not}} <b>visible</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> platforms. An emergency exit located {{in the middle of}} the Jamaica-bound platform leads to this lower level. The two outer tracks lead to Jamaica Yard while the two center tracks are used for reversing trains from Forest Hills–71st Avenue and end at bumper blocks just east of 75th Avenue under the mainline tracks.|$|E

5|$|As dawn came, {{the army}} {{approached}} a stream called Stony Brook. The road the army took followed Stony Brook for a mile farther until it intersected the Post Road from Trenton to Princeton. However, {{off to the}} right of this road, there was an unused road which crossed the farmland of Thomas Clark. The road was not <b>visible</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Post Road, and ran through cleared land to a stretch from which the town could be entered at any point because the British had left it undefended.|$|E
5|$|As {{the brain}} develops, {{by the fourth}} week of embryological {{development}} three swellings have formed within the embryo around the canal, near where the head will develop. These swellings represent different components of the central nervous system: the prosencephalon, mesencephalon and rhombencephalon. Subarachnoid spaces are first evident around the 32nd day of development near the rhombencephalon; circulation is <b>visible</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 41st day. At this time, the first choroid plexus can be seen, found in the fourth ventricle, although the time at which they first secrete CSF is not yet known.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its high}} speeds, large forces {{were applied to}} the {{aircraft}} during banks and turns, and caused twisting and distortion of the aircraft's structure. In addition there were concerns over maintaining precise control at supersonic speeds. Both of these issues were resolved by active ratio changes between the inboard and outboard elevons, varying at differing speeds including supersonic. Only the innermost elevons, which {{are attached to the}} stiffest area of the wings, were active at high speed. Additionally, the narrow fuselage meant that the aircraft flexed. This was <b>visible</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rear passengers' viewpoints.|$|E
50|$|There {{is a large}} {{sculpture}} of a chair by Magdalena Jetelová outside the museum, which is a prominent landmark <b>visible</b> <b>from</b> across <b>the</b> Vltava.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} grey with a pale, flesh-coloured belly. A median greenish line runs between the chin and the tail. Its eyes are {{distinct}} {{with a white}} patch around them. The nostril are placed dorsally on <b>the</b> snout and <b>visible</b> <b>from</b> above. <b>The</b> tentacles are placed below <b>the</b> nostrils, not <b>visible</b> <b>from</b> above. <b>The</b> tip of the tail is whitish, and the snout tip and lower jaw are cream-coloured. It was described from Kottayam in Kerala, and has been reported from Karnataka.|$|R

5|$|For {{the next}} several miles, NY33 runs {{parallel}} to the Thruway and very close to it, with both roads <b>visible</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> other. Much of this section of Lancaster has remained rural in character; however, that began {{to change in the}} mid-1990s when Tops Friendly Markets, the regional supermarket chain headquartered in nearby Williamsville, chose a site near the Gunnville Road intersection for a major distribution center. It necessitated the widening of the highway and construction of a traffic light and turn lanes at its entrance.|$|E
5|$|Frampton {{resigned}} from the project through pressure of work, and Drury and Pomeroy carried out the project, each contributing four monumental statues, which were installed in late 1907. On the upstream piers are Pomeroy's Agriculture, Architecture, Engineering and Pottery, whilst on the downstream piers are Drury's Science, Fine Arts, Local Government and Education. Each statue weighs approximately two tons. Despite their size, the statues are little-noticed by users of the bridge as they are not <b>visible</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bridge itself, but only from the river banks or from passing shipping.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in November 2004 {{engineers}} identified {{cracks in}} the terrace supporting the Memorial Gardens, and they were {{closed to the public}} as a potential hazard. Eventually in 2009 work began on renovating the gardens. Lutyens's memorial was dismantled and cleaned, and reassembled at a higher level to be <b>visible</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> street; it was also rotated 180° to face City Hall, rather than the market. The terrace was strengthened, and the gardens were landscaped around a new sculpture by Paul de Monchaux on the original site of the memorial.|$|E
