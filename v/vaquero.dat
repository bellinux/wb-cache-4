5|$|Varian {{was one of}} a {{very few}} experts in the 21st century who was still {{teaching}} about <b>vaquero</b> equipment, methods, and history. She had a strong interest {{in the history of the}} spade bit horse in California. The spade is an elaborate, complex bit that can only be properly used on a highly trained horse handled by a skilled rider. In the <b>vaquero</b> tradition, its use represents the highest level of trust and communication between horse and rider. The process of training the spade bit horse takes five to seven years to complete. Its emphasis has always been on producing a finely tuned working horse and partner, emphasizing quality rather than on how quickly the goal is reached. The conformation of the horse is also a factor; to become a spade bit horse, the animal must be bred to have a higher neck set and well-carried head. Varian compared the ride and handling of a horse trained in this manner to that of a Jaguar automobile.|$|E
5|$|Varian was {{inducted}} into the Cowgirl Hall of Fame in 2003. She was honored for both her contributions as a horse breeder and as a trainer, but the honor represented, in many ways, her roots in the <b>vaquero</b> tradition. Other inductees that year included western artist Glenna Goodacre; musician, artist, cowboy poet and pickup rider Ann Secrest Hanson; and classic cowgirl trick rider and barrel racer Velda Tindall Smith (1908–1990).|$|E

5000|$|In 1854, Livermore and Noriega {{came to an}} agreement, where Livermore {{purchased}} Noriega's half of Rancho Las Positas {{and sold}} his half of Rancho Cañada de los <b>Vaqueros</b> to Noriega. This {{was the beginning of}} several lawsuits, and the ownership of the property was not resolved until 1897. Noriega hired an attorney, and gave him a half interest in Rancho Cañada de los <b>Vaqueros</b> in lieu of fee, and sold the other half to Maximo Fernandez. Both halves of Rancho Cañada de los <b>Vaqueros</b> were again sold in separate transactions in 1857. Unknown to Noriega, Livermore had already conveyed his interest in Rancho Cañada de los <b>Vaqueros</b> to his wife and children in 1852; so that the deed from Livermore to Noriega in fact conveyed nothing, in as much as Livermore had then no title to convey. When Livermore died in 1858, his widow and children claimed Rancho Cañada de los <b>Vaqueros</b> based on the deed predating the Noriega transfer. At the same time, the four children of Antonio Higuera claimed a one third interest in Rancho Cañada de los <b>Vaqueros.</b>|$|R

25|$|The <b>vaquero,</b> the Spanish or Mexican cowboy {{who worked}} with young, untrained horses, arrived in the 18th century and flourished in California and {{bordering}} territories during the Spanish Colonial period. Settlers from the United States did not enter California until after the Mexican-American War, and most early settlers were miners rather than livestock ranchers, leaving livestock-raising largely to the Spanish and Mexican people who chose to remain in California. The California <b>vaquero</b> or buckaroo, unlike the Texas cowboy, was considered a highly skilled worker, who usually stayed on the same ranch {{where he was born}} or had grown up and raised his own family there. In addition, the geography and climate of much of California was dramatically different from that of Texas, allowing more intensive grazing with less open range, plus cattle in California were marketed primarily at a regional level, without the need (nor, until much later, even the logistical possibility) to be driven hundreds of miles to railroad lines. Thus, a horse- and livestock-handling culture remained in California and the Pacific Northwest that retained a stronger direct Spanish influence than that of Texas. The modern distinction between <b>vaquero</b> and buckaroo within American English may also reflect the parallel differences between the California and Texas traditions of western horsemanship.|$|E

25|$|Since colonial times, much of {{the economy}} of the state has {{traditionally}} been linked to livestock, especially cattle, with vaqueros, or cowboys, being {{an important part of the}} state's identity. Today, most are employed in industry and tourism, but the dress and folklore of the <b>vaquero</b> is still important. Jeans and cowboy hats are still extremely popular, especially with men. The cowboy lifestyle is associated with the pickup truck. This influence extends into popular music.|$|E
25|$|The {{origins of}} the cowboy {{tradition}} come from Spain, beginning with the hacienda system of medieval Spain. This style of cattle ranching spread {{throughout much of the}} Iberian peninsula and later, was imported to the Americas. Both regions possessed a dry climate with sparse grass, and thus large herds of cattle required vast amounts of land in order to obtain sufficient forage. The need to cover distances greater than a person on foot could manage gave rise {{to the development of the}} horseback-mounted <b>vaquero.</b>|$|E
50|$|The type {{locality}} of the <b>Vaqueros</b> is from <b>Vaqueros</b> Canyon in the Santa Lucia Mountains, {{about eight}} {{miles southwest of}} Greenfield. The formation was first described by Homer Hamlin in 1904, {{as part of a}} report on the water resources of the Salinas Valley.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Vaqueros</b> {{have a close}} {{connection}} with their fans, involving them in the evolution and growth of the club. When the team was first created and needed a name and logo, the club allowed the fan community to create, submit and vote on what both of these aspects would look like. Many names were submitted, but the final decision was between Fort Worth United, Fort Worth <b>Vaqueros</b> FC and Panther City FC, with Fort Worth <b>Vaqueros</b> FC ultimately being selected. <b>Vaqueros</b> season ticket holders do not receive paper tickets to the games, but instead receive a free team jersey that they wear to each game as their ticket into the game.

25|$|The Florida cowhunter or cracker cowboy {{tradition}} gradually assimilated {{to western}} cowboy tradition during the 20th century (although the <b>vaquero</b> tradition {{has had little}} influence in Florida). Texas tick fever and the screw-worm were introduced to Florida in the early 20th century by cattle entering from other states. These pests forced Florida cattlemen to separate individual animals from their herds at frequent intervals for treatment, which {{eventually led to the}} widespread use of lassos. Florida cowboys continue to use dogs and bullwhips for controlling cattle.|$|E
25|$|After the {{departure}} of Robert Gordon from the Library in 1934, John A. Lomax was named Honorary Consultant and Curator of the Archive of American Folk Song, a title he held {{until his death in}} 1948. His work, for which he was paid a salary of one dollar, included fund raising for the Library, and he was expected to support himself entirely through writing books and giving lectures. Lomax secured grants from the Carnegie Corporation and the Rockefeller Foundation, among others, for continued field recordings. He and Alan recorded Spanish ballads and <b>vaquero</b> songs on the Rio Grande border and spent weeks among French-speaking Cajuns in southern Louisiana.|$|E
25|$|Despite a {{rough terrain}} and a harsh climate, Sonora, {{like the rest}} of the {{northern}} Mexico, is rich in mineral resources. This has led to a history of self-reliance, and many see themselves as the heirs to a pioneering tradition. A large part of this is linked to the <b>vaquero</b> or cowboy tradition, as much of the state’s economy has traditionally been linked to livestock. Sonorans and other norteños (northerners) have a reputation for being hard working and frugal, and being more individualistic and straightforward than other Mexicans. Although most people in the state are employed in industry and tourism, the trappings of the cowboy, jeans, cowboy hats and pickup trucks, are still very popular.|$|E

25|$|Though popularly {{considered}} American, {{the traditional}} cowboy {{began with the}} Spanish tradition, which evolved further in what today is Mexico and the Southwestern United States into the <b>vaquero</b> of northern Mexico and the charro of the Jalisco and Michoacán regions. While most hacendados (ranch owners) were ethnically Spanish criollos, many early vaqueros were Native Americans trained {{to work for the}} Spanish missions in caring for the mission herds. Vaqueros went north with livestock. In 1598, Don Juan de Oñate sent an expedition across the Rio Grande into New Mexico, bringing along 7000 head of cattle. From this beginning, vaqueros of mestizo heritage drove cattle from New Mexico and later Texas to Mexico City. Mexican traditions spread both South and North, influencing equestrian traditions from Argentina to Canada.|$|E
25|$|In the 18th century, the {{residents}} of Spanish Texas began to herd cattle on horseback to sell in Louisiana, both legally and illegally. Their horses were of jennet type which became the Spanish Mustang. By the early 19th century, the Spanish Crown, and later, independent Mexico, offered empresario grants in what would later be Texas to non-citizens, such as settlers from the United States. In 1821, Stephen F. Austin led a group which became the first English-speaking Mexican citizens. Following Texas independence in 1836, even more Americans immigrated into the empresario ranching areas of Texas. Here the settlers were strongly influenced by the Mexican <b>vaquero</b> culture, borrowing vocabulary and attire from their counterparts, but also retaining some of the livestock-handling traditions {{and culture of the}} Eastern United States and Great Britain. The Texas cowboy was typically a bachelor who hired on with different outfits from season to season.|$|E
25|$|A cowboy is {{an animal}} herder who tends cattle on ranches in North America, {{traditionally}} on horseback, and often performs {{a multitude of}} other ranch-related tasks. The historic American cowboy of the late 19th century arose from the <b>vaquero</b> traditions of northern Mexico and became a figure of special significance and legend. A subtype, called a wrangler, specifically tends the horses used to work cattle. In addition to ranch work, some cowboys work for or participate in rodeos. Cowgirls, first defined as such in the late 19th century, had a less-well documented historical role, but {{in the modern world}} have established the ability to work at virtually identical tasks and obtained considerable respect for their achievements. There are also cattle handlers in many other parts of the world, particularly South America and Australia, who perform work similar to the cowboy in their respective nations.|$|E

500|$|After {{learning}} traditional <b>vaquero</b> {{methods of}} training from Spencer and others, Varian modified her training methods in her twenties, after meeting Tom Dorrance. He {{introduced her to}} his “soft approach” of working with horses, and his methods were an additional influence on Varian's training philosophy. Varian utilized vaquero-influenced methods in training her horses, but believed that modern well-bred horses need a gentler approach, stating, “All good horses, like smart children, need good instruction, but they don’t need harsh instruction." ...|$|E
500|$|Traditionally, the <b>vaquero</b> method [...] {{starts a}} young horse using a hackamore, which is {{headgear}} {{that uses a}} heavy rawhide noseband, called a bosal instead of a bit to control the horse. As the horse gains skill with a rider, it moves to lighter bosals, and next into a transitional period in its training; carrying a bridle with a type of curb bit called a [...] "half breed" [...] which is a modified spade bit worn {{in conjunction with a}} light bosal. The rider carries two sets of reins, one set on the bosal and one on the curb, giving this gear its name, the [...] "two-rein." [...] After several years in a two-rein, the horse graduates into the spade bit.|$|E

She started her horse ranch, Varian Arabians, in 1954 with the assistance of her parents. Raising and training horses was her full-time occupation beginning in 1963. She used vaquero-influenced methods of training horses, although she adapted her technique over the years to fit the character of the Arabian horse, which she viewed as a horse breed requiring a smart yet gentle approach.|$|E
