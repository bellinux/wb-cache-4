40|$|JULIAN H. PETTENGILL* This article compares {{data from}} a variety of sources on the {{hospital}} utilization experience of persons aged 65 and over during the period 1963 - 71. These data show that, in the first 3 years fo 7 lowing the inception of Medicare, use of hospital services by the agedmeasured by days of care per 1 ~ 000 personsincreased at an average annual rate of 6 - 13 percent. Since 1969, however, hospital utilization by this age group has been declining l- 3 percent annually, mostly as a result of a decline in average length of stay. Comparison with similar data for persons under age 65 reveals that a significant redistribution of hospital care between this age group and those aged 65 and over has occurred since 1965. It is likely that aged persons increased their use of hospital services to some extent at the expense of persons under age 65. ~ MEDICARE’s two coordinated programs of health insurance for the aged-a basic hospital insurance program (HI) and a <b>voluntary</b> supplementary <b>medical</b> <b>insurance</b> program (SMI) -went into effect on July 1, 1966. The primary goal of the Social Security Administration’s Medicare program is to provide insurance protection to help persons aged 65 and over pay a major portion of their large expenses for hospital and medical care. The success of the Medicare program as a whole has been amply documented in a previous artic 1 e. l Financial protection was the main focus of the program; however, it was apparent that the aged would probably increase their hospital utilization under the hospital insurance part of t. he program.

It identifies that as of today the Ukrainian healthcare system is at the stage of reformation, mandatory medical insurance is not yet introduced and main consumers of the programmes of <b>voluntary</b> <b>medical</b> <b>insurance</b> are corporate clients. The article considers main constraints of development of medical insurance in Ukraine, including: low level of income of the population; absence of high quality providers of medical services in regions; and insufficient degree of trust of the population to the insurance sphere. The article shows that introduction of micro-insurance would positively influence the development of insurance medicine in the country, would facilitate provision of medical services even for poor citizens and would allow reduction of state budget expenditures on healthcare.

Having considered the system of medical insurance as a complex system, the article identifies its main characteristics, namely: integrity, hierarchy, structure, purposefulness, controllability, dynamics and openness. In {{the result of the}} study the article allocates the structure of the system of medical insurance, which contains four subsystems: formation, distribution, use of financial resources and control. The article justifies a necessity of development of the system with the aim of realisation of such principles of its functioning as prospectiveness, priority, realisation and step-by-step. Prospects of further studies in this direction are identification of the degree of attraction of private and state financial resources for healthcare, organisation of mandatory medical insurance, further development of <b>voluntary</b> <b>medical</b> <b>insurance</b> and health insurance funds with consideration of specific features of functioning of the national economy of Ukraine.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Urban {{population}} in China is mainly covered by two <b>medical</b> <b>insurance</b> schemes: the Urban Employee Basic <b>Medical</b> <b>Insurance</b> (UEBMI) for urban employees in formal {{sector and the}} Urban Resident Basic <b>Medical</b> <b>Insurance</b> (URBMI) for the left urban residents, mainly the unemployed, the elderly and children. This paper studies the effects of UEBMI and URBMI on health services utilisation in Shaanxi Province, Western China. METHODS: Cross-sectional data from the 4 th National Health Services Survey - Shaanxi Province was studied. The propensity score matching and the coarsened exact matching methods {{have been used to}} estimate the average <b>medical</b> <b>insurance</b> effect on the insured. RESULTS: Compared to the uninsured, robust results suggest that UEBMI had significantly increased the outpatient health services utilisation {{in the last two weeks}} (p 0. 10). It was also found that compared with the uninsured, basic <b>medical</b> <b>insurance</b> enrollees were more likely to purchase inpatient treatments in lower levels of hospitals, consistent with the incentive of the benefit package design.
