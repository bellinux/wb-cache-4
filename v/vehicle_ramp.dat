2500|$|Montford Point began {{a series}} of Post-Delivery Tests and Trials (PDT) events {{beginning}} in April 2014 that took place over several months, which included an Initial Operational Test and Evaluation (IOT) end-to-end event to determine operational effectiveness and the week-long Pacific Horizon 2015 humanitarian assistance and disaster relief exercise. [...] The tests demonstrated her ability to interface with cargo ships, including the LMSR using the Vehicle Transfer Ramp (VTR) and the JHSV with its <b>vehicle</b> <b>ramp,</b> and the Improved Navy Lighterage System to offload equipment onto it to be moved to shore by LCACs, reducing the need for use of a foreign port. Initial Operating Capability (IOC) is expected in April 2015.|$|E

5000|$|Following the {{withdrawal}} of the Caledonian MacBrayne Gourock-Dunoon vehicle service on 29 June 2011, Ali Cat forms part of the new contract for the passenger-only service on this route, operated by Argyll Ferries Ltd and using the new pier at Dunoon. As well as being repainted in Argyll Ferries livery, a fold-down ramp has been added at the stern, enabling foot passenger use of the linkspan <b>vehicle</b> <b>ramps</b> at both ferry terminals.|$|R
50|$|By 1977, {{plans were}} in the works to expand the complex. A new arena was to be built on the {{opposite}} side of Route 20 from the stadium and racetrack, connected by <b>vehicle</b> <b>ramps</b> and a pedestrian bridge. Brendan Byrne Arena, named for the sitting governor, opened July 2, 1981, with the first of six sold-out shows by musician Bruce Springsteen. The arena was renamed for its corporate sponsor, Continental Airlines (now United Airlines), in early 1996, and again in 2007 for Izod.|$|R
5000|$|Mechanical-arrestor escape ramp: a {{proprietary}} system of stainless-steel nets transversely spanning a paved ramp to engage and retard a runaway <b>vehicle.</b> <b>Ramps</b> {{of this type}} are typically shorter than gravity ramps, and can work even on a downhill grade. These systems tend to be costly, but may save expensive real estate in crowded areas, and prevent even more costly crashes. One such ramp at Avon, Connecticut in the United States has an electrically heated pavement surface to prevent snow and ice accumulation.|$|R
50|$|The porte-cochère was {{a feature}} of many late 18th- and 19th-century mansions and public buildings. Well-known {{examples}} are at Buckingham Palace in London and at the White House in Washington, D.C., where a raised <b>vehicle</b> <b>ramp</b> gives an architectural portico the functionality of a porte-cochère.|$|E
50|$|MV Bute has a semi-open {{car deck}} with a {{clearance}} height of 5.1m. Like the MV Coruisk before her, she has {{bow and stern}} access. In addition she has a starboard <b>vehicle</b> <b>ramp</b> aft which was used at Rothesay before the pier was converted to allow end-loading.|$|E
50|$|The {{property}} accommodates {{a number}} of structures including a house, dairy/laundry, wagon shed, farm shed/garage, <b>vehicle</b> <b>ramp,</b> water tanks and trellis within a grassed yard with trees and scattered plantings. A commemorative cairn with plaque stands in the front yard. The {{west side of the}} property and road reserve have mounded areas and evidence of wheel tracks.|$|E
40|$|Transportation for {{a person}} in a manual {{wheelchair}}, power wheelchair or scooter involves several issues. Individuals may purchase a vehicle that has already been modified, or they may choose to modify a new or used <b>vehicle.</b> <b>Ramps</b> or lifts can be used to get wheeled mobility aids into the passenger area of the vehicle, into a carrier, on a platform, or in the trunk. There are a variety of ramps and lifts to choose from depending on the vehicle, the mobility aid, and the individual's needs. Additionally, the vehicle may need to be modified to provide sufficient headroom...|$|R
50|$|The current station, {{which opened}} in 2000 as a {{replacement}} for the original Lorton Auto-Train station, features a large, modern waiting area designed in a modern Art Deco style, with high glass walls, a small gift shop, a snack bar, and a children's playground. There is one long low level platform (which is 1480 ft long) designed for Auto Train boarding and 6 <b>vehicle</b> <b>ramps</b> for boarding <b>vehicles</b> onto the 20+ autoracks that are on the Auto Train. This station is one mile south from the Virginia Railway Express Lorton station. No other Amtrak trains stop at either station.|$|R
5000|$|On August 8th, 1963 {{two boys}} entered the {{wheelhouse}} when the Taku {{was preparing to}} leave Petersburg, and engaged the engines. The resulting damage to the dock left the <b>vehicle</b> loading <b>ramp</b> out of commission for three months.|$|R

It has loading ramps attached to the vessel, not to land like the others. It docks at concrete boat-launch-like ramps, then lowers the <b>vehicle</b> <b>ramp</b> down to the ground.|$|E
50|$|The {{class is}} based on a frigate-like design, but built with an {{internal}} multipurpose deck (flex deck) and a stern <b>vehicle</b> <b>ramp.</b> The ships can serve as command platforms for a staff of 75 persons (naval or joint staff) with a containerized command and control centre, transport and base of operations for a company-sized landing force of some 200 men with vehicles. Alternatively, the flex deck can be used for mine-laying operations with a capacity of some 300 mines, or be fitted out for mine-clearing operations and launch and recover mine detecting and clearing equipment via a retractable gantry crane, adjacent to the stern <b>vehicle</b> <b>ramp,</b> which also is used for launching and recovering the fast landing craft. Furthermore, the flex deck can support a containerized hospital or simply transport a number of ISO standard containers or some 55 vehicles, including up to seven MBTs. The ships can carry two LCPs (Storebro SB90E), two rigid hull inflatable boats and two EH101 helicopters.|$|E
50|$|Lochnevis {{appearance}} {{is dominated by}} a large stern <b>vehicle</b> <b>ramp.</b> This allows her to berth a considerable distance from a slipway, protecting her exposed Azimuth thrusters in shallow waters. She can carry 190 passengers and 14 cars, although due to vehicle restrictions on the Small Isles, she usually carries few vehicles. The car deck is also used for goods for the islands. The starboard gangway entrance is used at Canna.|$|E

50|$|On September 5, 2002, {{a partial}} {{interchange}} {{opened at the}} DE 1 toll road in Dover, utilizing existing emergency <b>vehicle</b> <b>ramps.</b> This interchange {{was included in the}} initial plans for the highway but was dropped due to low traffic volumes. As part of building the interchange, DelDOT purchased development rights to adjacent land parcels in order to prevent additional development {{in the area of the}} interchange. In 2012, the Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance pushed for the city of Dover to rename the Division Street portion of DE 8 to Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard after civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. However, local merchants opposed the renaming. The Dover city council instead voted to rename Court Street, Duke of York Street, and William Penn Street near Delaware Legislative Hall to Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard.|$|R

50|$|The {{principal}} entrance {{was characterized}} by a <b>vehicle</b> <b>ramp</b> and two separate flights of steps {{at the sides of}} the tunnel, which allowed to get to the upper square. Here there was the Amministrazione (the Administration building), which included the administrative and medical management of the wards, and men’s and women’s visitors’ rooms. Moreover, the square was delimited by the Accettazione Donne (female admission, east) and Accettazione Uomini (male admission, west) pavilions.|$|E
50|$|The south {{elevation}} {{is occupied}} {{almost entirely by}} two continuous bands of windows following an identical pattern to the north elevation but without the projecting centre bay. At ground floor level two doors interrupt the pattern at the eastern end and toward the centre two window bays have been removed and in filled with fibre cement boarding and an aluminium window. At the western end a <b>vehicle</b> <b>ramp</b> leads down to a roller shutter door to the basement.|$|E
5000|$|USAV Spearhead (TSV-X1) is {{the first}} ship of the US Armys theater support vessel (TSV) program. The Army leased Spearhead from Australian fast ferry builder Incat in October 2002. Modifications {{included}} helicopter pads suitable for large military helicopters and a two-part, hydraulic <b>vehicle</b> <b>ramp</b> that allows rapid loading and discharge of vehicles from the stern or alongside. With its 1,250-ton capacity and shallow draft, Spearhead {{is the first}} of what is expected to become a fleet of as many as 17 TSVs.|$|E
40|$|This video {{shows the}} Virtual Physics Circus, {{a kind of}} {{playground}} for experimenting with simple physical models. The system {{makes it easy to}} create worlds with common physical objects such as swings, <b>vehicles,</b> <b>ramps,</b> and walls, and interactively play with those worlds. The system {{can be used as a}} creative art medium as well as to gain understanding and intuition about physical systems. The system can be controlled by a number of UI devices such as mouse, keyboard, joystick, and tags which are tracked in 6 degrees of freedom. There are two distinctly different aspects of use of our system. One is defining and exploring the models; the other is learning to interact in the virtual circus with those models. From an art perspective, these could be viewed as composition and performance. For example, it is one thing to design a bicycle or motor cart, and another thing to learn to control those models well enough to do tricks. Our system enables users to do both...|$|R

50|$|During the 2010 Chile earthquake, the {{passenger}} terminal building suffered internal damages {{and the collapse}} of a pedestrian bridge between the <b>vehicle</b> <b>ramp</b> and the departures area. Nevertheless, both runways and control tower were unharmed, allowing the realization of a massive humanitarian air-bridge held by the Chilean Air Force to Concepción, Chile (Carriel Sur International Airport), close to the most damaged area by this earthquake and subsequent tsunami. The airport authority had closed off all commercial flight operations after around 1200 UTC on February 27, resuming full operations on March 3, 2010.|$|E
50|$|The {{basement}} is a utilitarian space extending {{under the}} west wing of the Institute. It is accessed from a staircase below the main staircase in the entrance hall and from a <b>vehicle</b> <b>ramp</b> at the south west corner {{at the rear of}} the building. There is also an open well at the northwest corner of the building which gives access to ground and first floor from the basement. A goods hoist and beam are suspended below the first floor ceiling. A steep, steel industrial staircase and balustrade connects the three levels.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, the roofed area {{covering}} {{the western end}} of the station platforms was closed in and converted into a small supermarket, the lines being shortened by around 40 metres to make room for this alteration. The main station building was taken out of railway use and turned over to retail in May 1988. The area between former Platforms 3 and 4 (the Skipton through lines) was infilled during electrification work and is now a carpark. The <b>vehicle</b> <b>ramp</b> leading up from Station Road passes through the area once occupied by the coal drops at the eastern end of Platform 4.|$|E
25|$|The road <b>vehicle</b> loading <b>ramp</b> in Dereham yard is {{frequently}} used by mainline train operators to load damaged rolling stock onto road vehicles. Such rolling stock usually comes at night (via {{the connection with}} the mainline at Wymondham) at slow speed (sometimes on wheelskates) from Crown Point depot in Norwich (where no road-rail loading facilities are available) for onward road movement to specialist repair facilities around the country.|$|R

5000|$|... is {{a highly}} {{specialised}} ship serving the Small Isles of Eigg, Canna, Rùm and Muck from Mallaig. She is 49.2 m, and has capacity for 190 passengers. Her vehicle deck can accommodate up to 14 cars, but is empty on most sailings {{due to the lack}} of roads and vehicle restrictions on the Small Isles. It is instead used mostly for goods and vital equipment for the islands. Lochnevis has a surprisingly large <b>vehicle</b> <b>ramp,</b> which dominates her appearance. This allows her to berth a considerable distance from slipways, protecting her exposed Azipod propulsion systems in shallow waters.|$|E

50|$|Efly, was a {{low-cost}} carrier established by Luigi Crisipino and fellow business partners, to provide luxurious, low cost flights with service to several destinations throughout Europe, beginning with London Gatwick Airport. The airline leased four aircraft, only one aircraft {{was delivered to}} the airline in Malta. The airline failed to obtain its license to operate as a commercial airline, but it could fly its sole aircraft. In September 2009, weeks after Luigi Crisipino's resignation, the airline began operations operating an inaugural flight of 56 passengers. On November 5, 2009, the airline ceased operations due to tough competition on its Malta-Catania route, and struggles with entry permits and <b>vehicle</b> <b>ramp</b> access at Malta International Airport.|$|E
25|$|All buses in the TransLink fleet are accessible, {{with most}} being low-floor <b>vehicles</b> that have <b>ramps,</b> {{although}} some are high-floor vehicles that have specially designed lifts.

50|$|On July 23, 2003 PAT {{approved}} {{contracts for}} 10.9 million (US$ million today) to build high-occupancy <b>vehicle</b> (HOV) <b>ramps</b> and modernized the tunnel, {{as well as}} provide a 172-space park-and-ride lot along Woodruff Street. The little-used HOV lane was opened on December 27, 2004, running from West Carson St. on the South Side and through the tunnel to Woodruff St. in Mt. Washington. The Fort Pitt Tunnel to the west and the Liberty Tunnels to the east carry nearly all of the vehicular traffic heading downtown.|$|R
50|$|In March 2000, {{groundbreaking}} {{took place}} for the final segment of the DE 1 freeway between Smyrna and Odessa. The interchange at the Dover Air Force Base main gate was completed in July of that year. The construction of the final segment resulted in a portion of US 13 south of Odessa being shifted further east as DE 1 would be built {{on top of the}} road. A service road would serve properties on the southbound side of US 13. In October 2001, northbound US 13 was realigned to the new alignment south of Odessa in order to build DE 1 in that area. In May 2002, US 13 was shifted to a new southbound alignment south of Odessa, with the former portion of the route in that area becoming a service road known as Harris Road. On September 5, 2002, a partial interchange opened at DE 8 in Dover, utilizing existing emergency <b>vehicle</b> <b>ramps.</b> This interchange was included in the initial plans for the highway but was dropped due to low traffic volumes. As part of building the interchange, DelDOT purchased development rights to adjacent land parcels in order to prevent additional development {{in the area of the}} interchange.|$|R
