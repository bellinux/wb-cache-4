40|$|International audienceSeventeen {{elements}} were analysed in the organs and tissues of the <b>variegated</b> <b>scallop</b> Chlamys varia, from the Atlantic coast of France. Concentration levels were determined in scallops {{of different sizes}} sampled in contaminated (La Rochelle Bay) and clean (Ré Island) sites. Greater concentrations of Ag, Al, Ce, Cr, La, Mo, Nd, Ti, and V {{were found in the}} digestive gland while As, Cd, Co, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn were the highest in the kidneys. In the digestive gland, most of the metals were found in the insoluble fraction while As, Co, Cd, Mo, Ni, and V appeared to be mostly bound to soluble compounds. Among tissues, the adductor muscle always displayed the lowest trace element concentrations. According to size, Ag and Cd showed significantly higher concentrations in larger individuals, while Co and Zn were higher in the smallest ones. According to the sampling area, most of the metals, Ag, Al, Ce, Co, Cu, La, Mn, Nd, Pb and Zn, showed significantly higher concentrations in La Rochelle Bay compared to the Ré Island, reflecting differing inputs from industrial, domestic and harbour activities. However, Cr, Mo, Ni, Ti and V concentrations did not display significant differences between sites and As and Cd were significantly higher at the Ré Island. This study highlighted the ability of the <b>variegated</b> <b>scallop</b> C. varia to concentrate numerous trace elements to high levels, even those reported as poorly bioavailable for marine biota, such as rare earth elements...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{the effects}} of chronic {{chemical}} contamination on natural populations of marine organisms is complex due to the combined effects {{of different types of}} pollutants and environmental parameters that can modulate the physiological responses to stress. Here, we present {{the effects of}} a chronic contamination in a marine bivalve by combining multiple approaches that provide information on individual and population health. We sampled <b>variegated</b> <b>scallops</b> (Mimachlamys varia) at sites characterized by different contaminants and contamination levels to study the short and long-term (intergenerational) responses of this species to physiological stress. We used biomarkers (SOD, MDA, GST, laccase, citrate synthase and phosphatases) as indicators of oxidative stress, immune system alteration, mitochondrial respiration and general metabolism, and measured population genetic diversity at each site. In parallel, concentration of 14 trace metals and 45 organic contaminants (PAHs, PCBs, pesticides) in tissues were measured. Scallops were collected outside and during their reproductive season to investigate temporal variability in contaminant and biomarker levels. Our analyses revealed that the levels of two biomarkers (Laccase-type phenoloxidase and malondialdehyde) were significantly correlated with Cd concentration. Additionally, we observed significant seasonal differences for four of the five biomarkers, which is likely due to the scallop reproductive status at time of sampling. As a source of concern, a location that was identified as a reference site on the basis of inorganic contaminant levels presented the same level of some persistent organic pollutants (DDT and its metabolites) than more impacted sites. Finally, potential long-term effects of heavy metal contamination were observed for <b>variegated</b> <b>scallops</b> as genetic diversity was depressed in the most polluted sites...|$|R
40|$|U radu je iznesen kratki prikaz zemljopisnog položaja rijeke Krke, osobitosti njezina ušća, to izlova i istraživanja prirodnih populacija školjkaša. Poseban je naglasak stavljen na prikaz mogućnosti kontroliranog uzgoja školjkaša u bočatim vodama ušća. U ušću rijeke Krke utvrđeno je 56 svojti iz 27 porodica. Najrasprostranjenije su ove svojte: dagnja (Mytilus galloprovincialis), kamenica (Ostrea edulis), a česte su: jestiva srčanka (Cerastoderma glaucum), prnjavica (Venus verrucosa), kućica (Tapes decussatus), kunjka (Arca noae), mala kapica (Chlamys varia) i jakovska kapica (Pecten jacobaeus). Izlov prirodnih populacija školjkaša za prehranu tradicionalna je djelatnost i procjenjuje se na 100 tona u godini. Istraživanja mogućnosti kontroliranog uzgoja dagnje, kamenice, male kapice i jakovske kapice rezultirala su razvojem tehnologija konroliranog uzgoja dagnje i kamenice 1983., a jakovske kapice i male kapice godine 1989. Danas je proizvodnja organizirana na 25 lokaliteta, ukupne površine 87. 142 m 2, s mogućnošću proizvodnje oko 1. 500 tona dagnji i deset tisuća kamenica, a mogla bi se povećati iznad 10. 000 tona. Krka River {{spring is}} {{at the foot of}} Dinara mountain, {{starting}} from a 22 m high Topoljski waterfall. Its length is 72. 5 km, and total slope 242 m. The length of freshwater waterway is 49 km and brackish waterway, i. e. flooded river mouth, 23. 5 km long. Impact of seawater and depth of surface fresh water greatly vary depending on the river waterlevel, local precipitation, tides and wind directions. Owing to the extensive primary production in the river mouth shellfish are abundantly present with 56 species. The most abundant are Mediterranean mussel (Mytilus galloprouincialis) and flat oyster (Ostrea edulis), and partly common cockle (Cerastoderma glaucum), Venus shell (Venus verucosa), calico clam (Tapes decussates), Noah 2 ̆ 7 s arc (Arca noae), <b>variegated</b> <b>scallop</b> (Chlamis uaria) and Pilgrim 2 ̆ 7 s scallop (Pecten jacobaeus). Owing to very productive processes in the ecosystem of river mouth, fishing in the area is traditionally practice. The knowledge about natural populations of Mediterranean mussel fished out in quantities larger than 100 t/y have initiated the research on since 1979 shellfish in this area. Investigations on possibilities of commercial farming of Mediterranean mussel, flat oyster, <b>variegated</b> <b>scallop</b> and Pilgrim 2 ̆ 7 s scallop (Pecten jacobaeus) resulted in defining the technological procedure for commercial farming of Mediterranean mussel and flat oyster (1983), and <b>variegated</b> <b>scallop</b> and Pilgrim 2 ̆ 7 s scallop (1989). Nowadays at 25 localities of 87. 000 m 2 area and with 19 concessions a total production around 1500 t/y of Mediterranean mussel and about 10. 000 pieces of flat oyster is provided, and there is also significant possibility to increase production up to 10. 000 tons...|$|E
40|$|Scallop {{aquaculture}} development {{started in}} Europe in the 1970 s with its main efforts in countries along the Atlantic coasts. The main species of interest {{have been the}} great scallop Pecten maximus, the queen scallop Aequipecten opercularis and the black or <b>variegated</b> <b>scallop</b> Mimachlamys varia. Research and development programmes carried out involve spat production from natural spat-fall and hatcheries, suspended and bottom culture techniques and sea-ranching to support fisheries. These development efforts have been conducted under {{a wide range of}} economic and industrial conditions, but currently the aquaculture of scallops is a marginal industry in Europe. Based on this wide experience and concerns on the constraints to the development, the prospects of scallop aquaculture in Europe are discussed. © 2016 Elsevier B. V...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAlthough the <b>variegated</b> <b>scallop</b> Mimachlamys varia {{seems to}} be a {{suitable}} sentinel species for contaminant monitoring, no study has identified biomarkers in this species. In order to fill this gap, this study conducted an in situ biomarker approach. M. varia were collected in contaminated and uncontaminated areas and responsiveness of oxidative stress and immunological biomarkers was evaluated in the digestive gland. In parallel, 14 trace element concentrations were evaluated in the same organ. Superoxide dismutase activity and malondialdehyde content responded efficiently to in situ contamination when a certain degree of contamination was reached. Laccase-type phenoloxidase showed a high sensitivity but saturation of the response was highlighted for the highest contaminations. Additionally, correlations were found between biomarkers and trace element concentrations. Taken together, results showed that biomarker approach conducted in the digestive gland of M. varia represents a sensitive analytical tool to highlight ecotoxicological issues in coastal marine ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|Pectinides are {{a highly}} {{regarded}} sea product among the consumers. Huge efforts are being made {{for the development of}} farming technology. All around the world the local species of the Pectinidae family are being consumed along with some newly introduced species as for example Japanese scallop (Patinopecten yessoensis Jay, 1858). Althougt there are 16 species of shellfish from eastern Adriatic that are offered in Croatian markets, only two species are being farmed. Chlamys varia (<b>variegated</b> <b>scallop)</b> is often found in many locations, most often where the s alredy egsist shellfish farming. Many authors believe that farming must be conducted in the hatcheries since the spat settlement on the collectors has proven unsuccessful and dependent of many environmental factors. The research of hatchery cultivation of this species has been described. In most areas where the reproductive cycle has been studied there appear to be two main periods of spawning each year, but the timing can differ between areas, and between years...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAmong bivalves, {{scallops}} {{have been}} shown to be good bioindicator species for radionuclide monitoring. The present paper looked at the Cs bioaccumulation capacities of the <b>variegated</b> <b>scallop</b> Mimachlamys varia exposed separately via seawater and food under laboratory conditions. Results were compared with data previously obtained for the king scallop Pecten maximus, the only Pectinid species for which Cs accumulation has been studied in laboratory. Results indicated that M. varia has higher uptake capacity (CF: 1. 86 ± 0. 08) but lower absorption efﬁciency (A 0 l: 33 ± 5 %) than P. maximus when exposed to waterborne Cs (CF of P. maximus: 0. 94 ± 0. 05 and A 0 l: 45 ± 3 %). When scallops were fed radiolabeled phytoplankton, the assimilation efﬁciency of Cs was similar for the two species (AE: 24 ± 3 % for M. varia and 28 ± 4 % for P. maximus). Interspeciﬁc differences in terms of accumulation and retention, can be explained by physiological factors (including size of individuals) and/or difference in storage mecha- nisms. Indeed, organotropism differed between the two scallop species, suggesting the occurrence of speciﬁc redistribution mechanisms towards the tissues involved in Cs storage, excretion and detoxiﬁcation. Finally, the present study examined the relative contribution of the different exposure pathways (seawater and food) to global 134 Cs bioaccumulation for M. varia. Results showed that food constitutes the main accumulation pathway, contributing for 77 % of the global 134 Cs bioaccumulation...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{bioaccumulation}} and depuration kinetics {{of selected}} metals (Ag, Co, Hg, Mn and Zn) were determined in the European <b>variegated</b> <b>scallop</b> Chlamys varia following exposures via seawater and food, using highly sensitive radiotracer techniques (110 mAg, 57 Co, 203 Hg, 54 Mn and 65 Zn). Body distribution of Ag, Co, Mn and Zn was similar for both waterborne and dietary metals. Ag was mainly {{present in the}} digestive gland (> 80 %); Co and Mn were generally localized in similar proportions in the digestive gland and kidneys, whereas Zn was mainly found in the kidneys (> 40 %). In contrast, Hg was mainly present in gills during seawater exposure whereas it was mainly distributed in the digestive gland after food exposure. The results from all the experiments have been integrated into a bioaccumulation model in order to delineate the relative contribution of each metal uptake route in C. varia. Computation indicated that food is the main uptake route of Ag, Co, Mn, and Zn in scallop, whereas waterborne and dietary pathways were shown to contribute similarly in the global bioaccumulation of Hg in C. varia. Except for Hg, dietary transfer was investigated using two different phytoplankton species (Isochrysis galbana and Skeletonema costatum). For Mn and Zn, the dietary contribution was not influenced by the phytoplankton species used. In contrast, food quality {{played a major role}} for Ag and Co intake, (e. g., dietary pathway contributed for 97 % of global Ag bioaccumulation when S. costatum was used as food vs. 58 % for Ag ingested with I. galbana) ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe uptake {{and loss}} {{kinetics}} of Cd were determined in {{two species of}} scallops from the European coasts, the <b>variegated</b> <b>scallop</b> Chlamys varia and the king scallop Pecten maximus, following exposures via seawater, phytoplankton and sediment using highly sensitive radiotracer techniques (109 Cd). Results indicate that, for seawater and dietary pathways, C. varia displays higher bioaccumulation capacities in terms of uptake rate from water and fraction absorbed from ingested food (assimilation efficiency) than Pecten maximus. Regarding sediment exposure, P. maximus displayed low steady-state Cd transfer factor (TFSS 4 months), suggesting efficient mechanisms of detoxification and storage in both species. The digestive gland {{was found to be}} the main storage organ of Cd in the two scallops regardless of the exposure pathway. However, Cd was stored differently within this organ according to the species considered: 40 % of the total Cd was found in the soluble cellular fraction in C. varia whereas this soluble fraction reached 80 % for P. maximus. This suggests that the two species displayed different Cd detoxification/storage mechanisms. Finally, the present study has determined the relative contribution of the different exposure pathways to global Cd bioaccumulation for the two scallop species. Results clearly show that for both species, food constitutes the major accumulation pathway, contributing for > 99 % and 84 % of the global Cd bioaccumulation in C. varia and P. maximus, respectively. This work confirms the previous assumption, derived from a bibliographic overview, that dietary pathway plays a prevalent role in metal bioaccumulation in Pectinidae...|$|E
