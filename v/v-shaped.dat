5|$|It has paired {{blowholes}} on {{a prominent}} splashguard and a broad, flat, <b>V-shaped</b> rostrum. A single median ridge stops {{well short of}} the rostrum tip. A light <b>V-shaped</b> marking, the chevron, begins behind the blowholes and extends back and then forward again.|$|E
5|$|The typical Parthian riding outfit is {{exemplified}} by the famous bronze statue of a Parthian nobleman found at Shami, Elymais. Standing 1.9m (6ft), the figure wears a <b>V-shaped</b> jacket, a <b>V-shaped</b> tunic fastened in place with a belt, loose-fitting and many-folded trousers held by garters, and a diadem or band over his coiffed, bobbed hair. His outfit is commonly seen in relief images of Parthian coins by the mid-1st century BC.|$|E
5|$|As Professor Bernard Quatermass (Brian Donlevy) {{struggles to}} gain {{government}} {{support for his}} moon colonisation project, his interest becomes focused on reports of hundreds of meteorites landing in Winnerden Flats. Travelling there with Marsh, his colleague (Bryan Forbes), Quatermass finds a huge complex under construction, based on his lunar colony plans. Marsh finds an undamaged meteorite is shaped like a small stone rocket. It then cracks open, releasing a gas, leaving him with an odd <b>V-shaped</b> mark on his face. Black-clad guards from the complex arrive, armed with machine guns and sporting similar <b>V-shaped</b> marks, and take Marsh away, knocking down Quatermass and ordering him to leave.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} type of tower {{used was}} a massive self-supporting delta pylon, or waist pylon, which consumed 21 tonnes of steel per kilometre of line. This type of pylon {{was used for the}} first 735kV power line from the Manic-Outardes power stations to the load centre of Montreal. There are two significant variations of the delta pylon; one has longer side crossbars such that all three bundles of conductors are suspended on <b>V-shaped</b> insulators. The other has shorter side crossbars, such that the two outside bundles are hung on a vertical insulator string and only the middle bundle is hung with a <b>V-shaped</b> insulator.|$|E
5|$|Black-shouldered kites spiral {{into the}} wind like a kestrel. They soar with <b>v-shaped</b> up-curved wings, the {{primaries}} slightly spread and the tail widely fanned. In level flight progress is rather indirect. Their flight pattern {{has been described as}} 'winnowing' with soft steady beats interspersed with long glides on angled wings. They can most often be seen hovering with wings curved and tail pointing down.|$|E
5|$|From 1871 to 1880, the Corradino Lines {{were built}} on the Corradino Heights. The <b>V-shaped</b> trace and ditch were meant to protect the {{dockyard}} and harbour from landward attacks. They were abandoned in the early 1900s due to advancements in technology, although they saw some use once again in World War II.|$|E
5|$|The {{boundary}} of the south polar region {{is marked by a}} pattern of parallel, Y- and <b>V-shaped</b> ridges and valleys. The shape, orientation, and location of these features suggest they are caused by changes in the overall shape of Enceladus. As of 2006 there were two theories for what could cause such a shift in shape: the orbit of Enceladus may have migrated inward, leading to an increase in Enceladus's rotation rate. Such a shift would lead to a more oblate shape; or a rising mass of warm, low-density material in Enceladus's interior may have led to a shift in the position of the current south polar terrain from Enceladus's southern mid-latitudes to its south pole. Consequently, the moon's ellipsoid shape would have adjusted to match the new orientation. One problem of the polar flattening hypothesis is that both polar regions should have similar tectonic deformation histories. However, the north polar region is densely cratered, and has a much older surface age than the south pole. Thickness variations in Enceladus's lithosphere is one explanation for this discrepancy. Variations in lithospheric thickness are supported by the correlation between the Y-shaped discontinuities and the <b>V-shaped</b> cusps along the south polar terrain margin and the relative surface age of the adjacent non-south polar terrain regions. The Y-shaped discontinuities, and the north-south trending tension fractures into which they lead, are correlated with younger terrain with presumably thinner lithospheres. The <b>V-shaped</b> cusps are adjacent to older, more heavily cratered terrains.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales {{have two}} {{flippers}} on the front, near the head. Like all mammals, baleen whales breathe air and must surface periodically to do so. Their nostrils, or blowholes, are {{situated at the}} top of the cranium. Baleen whales have two blowholes, as opposed to toothed whales which have one. These paired blowholes are longitudinal slits that converge anteriorly and widen posteriorly, which causes a <b>V-shaped</b> blow. They are surrounded by a fleshy ridge that keeps water away while the whale breathes. The septum that separates the blowholes has two plugs attached to it, making the blowholes water-tight while the whale dives.|$|E
5|$|Demand from {{middlemen}} {{and specialized}} animal trade mafias {{has increased the}} profitability of slow loris hunting and driven many hunters to catch any they spot by climbing or shaking trees. In the Mondulkiri Province in Cambodia, slow lorises are shaken out of trees and then bludgeoned {{to death with a}} stick. In Indonesia, slow lorises are worth more alive, so hunters climb the tree to reach them and place a <b>V-shaped</b> stick around their neck to immobilize them. If the slow loris is found in with an infant, the parent is often killed.|$|E
5|$|Designed with a <b>V-shaped</b> top in {{the form}} of an {{overturned}} chaika, the šajkača is narrow and typically black or grey in colour. It is usually made of soft, homemade cloth and is worn without any symbols during peacetime. During times of war, cockades featuring the Serbian double-headed eagle and the motto Only Unity Saves the Serbs are often seen on the cap. The šajkača worn by Serbian soldiers during World War I had a non-reflecting peak and was topped with a royal monogram.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} Odontogriphus ("toothed riddle") was known from only one specimen, an almost featureless oval smear on a slab, with hints of tiny conical teeth. However, 189 new finds {{in the years}} {{immediately}} preceding 2006 made a detailed description possible. It had a pair of slightly <b>V-shaped</b> tooth-rows just ahead of the mouth, very like Wiwaxia′s. This pitched Odontogriphus {{into the middle of the}} debate about whether Wiwaxia was closer to the mollusc or the annelid lineage, resulting in a frank exchange of views.|$|E
5|$|Lavanify had high-crowned, curved teeth. One of the {{two teeth}} is 11.2mm high and shows a deep furrow and, is {{centered}} laterally in the crown, a <b>V-shaped</b> area that consists of dentine. The other, damaged, tooth is 9.8mm high and {{has at least one}} deep cavity (infundibulum). Characters shared by the teeth of Lavanify and Bharattherium include the presence of an infundibulum and a furrow; they both also have large, continuous bands of matrix (unbundled hydroxyapatite crystals) between the prisms (bundles of hydroxyapatite crystals) of the enamel, and perikymata—wave-like ridges and grooves in the enamel surface.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, Hydro-Québec {{researchers}} engineered a {{new type}} of pylon, the V-guyed tower, which reduced materials consumption to 11.8 tonnes of steel per kilometre of power line. This type of tower also includes a variation with longer side crossbars, where all conductors are hung with a <b>V-shaped</b> insulator and one with shorter side crossbar, where only the middle bundle hangs from the insulator and the side bundles are strung on vertical insulator strings.|$|E
5|$|Shot at by guards as he exits, Quatermass {{rushes to}} Inspector Lomax, {{explaining}} that {{he believes that the}} complex is indeed making food but not for human consumption. Its purpose is to provide a suitable living environment for small alien creatures being housed inside the huge domes. Lomax attempts to alert his superiors, but when he meets the Commissioner of Police, he notices that he, too, is sporting the <b>V-shaped</b> mark; the aliens have taken control of the government.|$|E
5|$|The {{excavation}} {{revealed that}} {{the location of the}} stones was not their original prehistoric position. The original location of the circle was identified as existing a few feet to the west, under the adjacent hedge. The original circle had either eight or possibly nine sockets for stones and was oval shaped. The perimeter of the ring was defined by <b>V-shaped</b> ditches on its eastern and western perimeters. The maximum axis of the circle would have been approximately 20 feet (6.5 metres), making it considerably smaller than the size proposed by the Piggotts.|$|E
5|$|The larger scutes {{display a}} pattern of black or yellow lines. The wood turtle's {{plastron}} (ventral shell) is yellowish in color and has dark patches. The posterior margin of the plastron terminates in a <b>V-shaped</b> notch. Although sometimes speckled with yellowish spots, the upper surface of the head is often a dark gray to solid black. The ventral surfaces of the neck, chin, and legs are orange to red with faint yellow stripes along the lower jaw of some individuals. Seasonal variation in color vibrancy {{have been known to}} occur.|$|E
5|$|The mandible, {{which is}} {{severely}} damaged and lacks the condyloid, coronoid, and angular processes {{at the back}} of the bone, contains the second and third molar and part of the lower incisor, but the first molar is missing. The capsular process of the lower incisor, a slight raising of the mandibular bone at the back end of the incisor, is small. The preserved alveoli, the impressions left by the roots, show that the first molar was supported by large roots at the front and back and a smaller root in between these. The second molar is about square and shows the four main cusps commonly present in rodents: the protoconid, metaconid, hypoconid, and entoconid. A strongly developed mesolophid (a crest) is also present, as in most oryzomyines. The main valley between the cusps, the hypoflexid, is broad and <b>V-shaped.</b> The third molar is as long as the second, but it is narrower and the entoconid is poorly developed. Again, the hypoflexid is broad and <b>V-shaped.</b> The length of the toothrow at the alveoli is 8.7mm. The length of the second molar is 2.5mm and the width is 2.2mm. The third molar has a length of 2.5mm and width of 1.8mm.|$|E
5|$|The next year, Luo {{and colleagues}} {{published}} {{a more thorough}} analysis confirming their previous conclusion and adding the Cretaceous Australian Bishops to Australosphenida. They mentioned {{the condition of the}} hypoconulid, which is inclined forward, rather than backward as in boreosphenidans, as an additional australosphenidan character and noted that Ausktribosphenos and monotremes were united, to the exclusion of Ambondro, by the presence of a <b>V-shaped</b> notch in the distal metacristid. In the same year, Asfaltomylos was described from the Jurassic of Argentina as another australosphenidan. In contrast to Ambondro, this animal lacked a distal metacristid and did not have as well-developed a lingual cingulum.|$|E
5|$|The twigs of the {{red maple}} are reddish in color and {{somewhat}} shiny with small lenticels. Dwarf shoots are present on many branches. The buds are usually blunt and greenish to reddish in color, generally with several loose scales. The lateral buds are slightly stalked, and in addition there may be collateral buds present as well. The buds form in fall and winter and are often visible from a distance due to their reddish tint. The leaf scars on the twig are <b>V-shaped</b> and contain 3 bundle scars.|$|E
5|$|They {{were usually}} joined by other local children, {{two of whom}} became elite sportsmen: Allan Ruthven (an Australian rules footballer) and Harold Shillinglaw (both an Australian rules footballer and {{first-class}} cricketer)the group also played Australian rules football, kicking around rolled up cardboard and newspaper. Much of the batting skill displayed by the Harvey brothers {{has been attributed to}} these games played on the unpredictable bounce of the bumpy laneway. The surface also had a <b>V-shaped</b> slope inwards towards the centre of the lane, causing balls to deviate sideways after bouncing.|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} caldera-forming eruption occurred about 160,000 years ago. It {{formed the}} relatively small caldera that contains the West Thumb of Yellowstone Lake. Since the last supereruption, a series of smaller eruptive cycles between 640,000 and 70,000years ago, has nearly filled in the Yellowstone Caldera with 80 different eruptions of rhyolitic lavas {{such as those that}} can be seen at Obsidian Cliffs and basaltic lavas which can be viewed at Sheepeater Cliff. Lava strata are most easily seen at the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, where the Yellowstone River continues to carve into the ancient lava flows. The canyon is a classic <b>V-shaped</b> valley, indicative of river-type erosion rather than erosion caused by glaciation.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1960s and 1970s, the {{prevailing}} interpretation of hadrosaurids like Edmontosaurus {{was that they}} were aquatic and fed on aquatic plants. An example of this is William Morris's 1970 interpretation of an edmontosaur skull with nonbony beak remnants. He proposed that the animal had a diet much like that of some modern ducks, filtering plants and aquatic invertebrates like mollusks and crustaceans from the water and discharging water via <b>V-shaped</b> furrows along the inner face of the upper beak. This interpretation of the beak has been rejected, as the furrows and ridges are more like those of herbivorous turtle beaks than the flexible structures seen in filter-feeding birds.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the same}} {{processes}} that create hoodoos will also eventually destroy them. In {{the case of}} Bryce Canyon, the hoodoos' rate of erosion is 24feet (0.61.3m) every 100 years. As the canyon continues to erode to the west it will eventually capture (in perhaps 3 million years) the watershed of the East Fork of the Sevier River. Once this river flows through Bryce Amphitheater it will dominate the erosional pattern; replacing hoodoos with a <b>V-shaped</b> canyon and steep cliff walls typical of the weathering and erosional patterns created by rivers. A foreshadowing {{of this can be}} observed in Water Canyon while hiking the Mossy Cave Trail. A diversion canal has been taking a portion of the East Fork of the Sevier River through this section of the park for over 100 years.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, {{there is}} a {{well-defined}} lowered area {{in the middle of}} the rostrum (front part), which nearly touches the back margin of the large, <b>V-shaped</b> nasal aperture (opening for the nose). Next to the aperture are two elevated areas, above the incisors. The zygomatic arches (cheekbones) are slender. The supraorbital ridges (located above the eyes) are well-developed. P.abramus, P.endoi, and P.paterculus have a flatter rostrum and less prominent supraorbital ridges. The braincase is of average size and bears a poorly developed sagittal crest on its roof. The supraoccipital, the backmost part of the skull, is convex. The sides of the concave palate are about parallel.|$|E
5|$|Odobenidae {{consists}} {{of only one}} living member: the modern walrus. This animal is easily distinguished from other extant pinnipeds by its larger size (exceeded only by the elephant seals), nearly hairless skin and long upper canines, known as tusks. Like otariids, walruses are capable of turning their hind-flippers forward and can walk on land. When moving in water, the walrus relies on its hind-flippers for locomotion, while its fore-flippers are used for steering. In addition, the walrus lacks external ear flaps. Walruses have pterygoid bones that are broad and thick, frontal bones that are <b>V-shaped</b> at the anterior end and calcaneuses with pronounced tuberosity in the middle.|$|E
5|$|Parasaurolophus walkeri {{is known}} from one {{specimen}} which might contain a pathology. The skeleton shows a <b>v-shaped</b> gap or notch in the vertebrae {{at the base}} of the neck. Originally thought to be pathologic, Parks published a second interpretation of this, as a ligament attachment to support the head. The crest would attach to the gap via muscles or ligaments, and be used to support the head while bearing a frill, like predicted to exist in some hadrosaurids. One other possibility, is that during preparation, the specimen was damaged, creating the possible pathology. The notch, however, is still considered more likely to be a pathology, even though some illustrations of Parasaurolophus restore the skin flap.|$|E
5|$|Pillars and columns, such as Washington Column and Lost Arrow, {{are created}} by cross joints. Erosion acting on master joints is {{responsible}} for creating valleys and later canyons. The single most erosive force {{over the last few}} million years has been large alpine glaciers, which have turned the previously <b>V-shaped</b> river-cut valleys into U-shaped glacial-cut canyons (such as Yosemite Valley and Hetch Hetchy Valley). Exfoliation (caused by the tendency of crystals in plutonic rocks to expand at the surface) acting on granitic rock with widely spaced joints is responsible for creating domes such as Half Dome and North Dome and inset arches like Royal Arches.|$|E
5|$|Reptile was {{originally}} {{depicted as a}} tall, muscular, light-skinned humanoid. Due to his origin as a palette swap of Scorpion and Sub-Zero, his attire was identical to theirs only colored in green. His clothing consists of pants and boots covering his lower body, along with a black sleeveless shirt and open hood. Green light armor covered his forearms and lower legs, while an open <b>V-shaped</b> green vest protected his torso, extending to a matching small fauld and loincloth. He wears a green facial mask {{as part of his}} ninja disguise to conceal his true reptilian nature, however he does remove the mask in-game for his Acid Spit attack or his tongue grab fatality. Reptile stands 6feet (183cm) tall, and speaks in a hissing tone.|$|E
5|$|The Algonquians {{recognized}} maple sap as {{a source}} of energy and nutrition. At the beginning of the spring thaw, they used stone tools to make <b>V-shaped</b> incisions in tree trunks; they then inserted reeds or concave pieces of bark to run the sap into buckets, which were often made from birch bark. The maple sap was concentrated either by dropping hot cooking stones into the buckets or by leaving them exposed to the cold temperatures overnight and disposing of the layer of ice that formed on top. While there was widespread agriculture in Mesoamerica and the Southeast and Southwest regions of the United States, the production of maple syrup is one of only a few agricultural processes in the Northeast that is not a European colonial import.|$|E
5|$|The head {{should be}} of {{moderate}} width at the ears, narrowing to the eyes, and slightly flat between the ears. There should be a defined but not overpronounced stop {{at the end of}} the muzzle where it meets the head, and a black nose. The jaw should be powerful and well boned with a scissor bite and straight teeth. The eyes are almond shaped and dark coloured and should be full of life and intelligence. Small <b>V-shaped</b> ears of moderate thickness are carried forward on the head. When the dog is alert, the tip of the V should not extend past the outer corner of the eyes. The tail is set high and in the past was docked to approximately five inches in order to provide a sufficient hand-hold for gripping the terrier.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} fossils of megalodon are its teeth. Diagnostic {{characteristics}} include a triangular shape, robust structure, large size, fine serrations, {{a lack of}} lateral denticles, and a visible <b>V-shaped</b> neck (where the root meets the crown). The tooth met the jaw at a steep angle, similar to the great white shark. The tooth was anchored by connective tissue fibers, and the roughness of the base may have added to mechanical strength. The lingual side of the tooth, the part facing the tongue, was convex; and the labial side, {{the other side of}} the tooth, was slightly convex or flat. The anterior teeth were almost perpendicular to the jaw and symmetrical, whereas the posterior teeth were slanted and asymmetrical.|$|E
5|$|The sparsely-spotted stingaree, white-spotted stingaree, or Dixon's stingaree (Urolophus paucimaculatus) is {{a species}} of {{stingray}} in the family Urolophidae, common off the southern Australian coast. Preferring sandy flats and seagrass beds, this benthic ray can be found from close to shore {{to a depth of}} at least , and tends to occur deeper in the northern portion of its range. Reaching a length of , this species has a broad, diamond-shaped pectoral fin disc that is typically plain gray in color above with a <b>V-shaped</b> marking between the eyes. Individuals from southerly waters also generally exhibit a smattering of small, dark-edged white spots. This ray is further characterized by a distinctively bell-shaped curtain of skin between the nostrils. Its tail has a skin fold running along either side and a leaf-shaped caudal fin, but no dorsal fin.|$|E
5|$|The toothcomb of most lemuriforms {{includes}} six finely spaced teeth, four incisors and two canine {{teeth that}} are procumbent (tilt forward) {{in the front}} of the mouth. The procumbent lower canine teeth are the same shape as the incisors located between them, but they are more robust and curve upward and inward, more so than the incisors. In the permanent dentition, the canines erupt after the incisors. The crowns of the incisors are also angled in the direction of the forward tilt, and the crowns of both the incisors and canines are elongated and compressed side-to-side. The apical ridge, following along the front edges of the toothcomb teeth, is <b>V-shaped</b> in most lemuriforms, tapering off from the midline. As a result of this dental reconfiguration, the upper and lower incisors do not contact one another, and often the upper incisors are reduced or lost completely.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two sets}} of {{lighting}} in the top spires and decoration. The first are the <b>V-shaped</b> lighting inserts in the steel of the building itself. Added later were groups of floodlights that are on mast arms directed back at the building. This allows {{the top of the}} building to be lit in many colors for special occasions. The tube lighting atop the building was added in 1981, although it {{had been part of the}} original design. Until 1998 the lights were turned off at 2a.m., but New York Observer columnist Ron Rosenbaum convinced Tishman Speyer to keep the lights on until 6a.m. Since 2015, the Chrysler Building and other city skyscrapers have been part of the Audubon Society's Lights Out program, wherein the building turns off its lights during bird migration seasons.|$|E
5|$|UA8653, the holotype, is hypsodont and curved. It is 11.2mm high, {{of which}} the crown makes up about 85%, and the {{dimensions}} of its crown are 3.4 x 3.2mm. The occlusal (chewing) surface is worn flat and contains a <b>V-shaped</b> island of dentine surrounded by enamel. One side of the crown lacks enamel. Between the two arms of the V, at the lingual (inner) side of the tooth, is a furrow filled with cementum, which extends {{all the way through}} the tooth; the presence of such a long furrow distinguishes it from Gondwanatherium. The enamel is made up of small, round prisms (bundles of hydroxyapatite crystals) that are separated by large, continuous bands of interprismatic matrix (IPM; the material between the enamel prisms).|$|E
5|$|A {{diffraction}} grating constructed of layers of chitin and air {{gives rise to}} the iridescent colours of various butterfly wing scales {{as well as to the}} tail feathers of birds such as the peacock. Hooke and Newton were correct in their claim that the peacock's colours are created by interference, but the structures responsible, being close to the wavelength of light in scale (see micrographs), were smaller than the striated structures they could see with their light microscopes. Another way to produce a {{diffraction grating}} is with tree-shaped arrays of chitin, as in the wing scales of some of the brilliantly coloured tropical Morpho butterflies (see drawing). Yet another variant exists in Parotia lawesii, Lawes's parotia, a bird of paradise. The barbules of the feathers of its brightly coloured breast patch are <b>V-shaped,</b> creating thin-film microstructures that strongly reflect two different colours, bright blue-green and orange-yellow. When the bird moves the colour switches sharply between these two colours, rather than drifting iridescently. During courtship, the male bird systematically makes small movements to attract females, so the structures must have evolved through sexual selection.|$|E
