5|$|Until {{the late}} 1930s {{electricity}} was supplied by municipal undertakings. These were small power companies that built power stations {{dedicated to a}} single industry or group of factories, and sold any excess electricity to the public. These companies used widely differing standards of <b>voltage</b> <b>and</b> <b>frequency.</b> In 1925 Parliament decided that the power grid should be a single system with uniform standards and under public ownership. Several of the private power companies reacted to the proposal by forming the London Power Company. They planned to heed parliament's recommendations and build {{a small number of}} very large stations.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} list {{contains a}} chronology {{of when the}} various sections of mainline railway lines were electrified. The list excludes industrial and short branch lines, as well as systems installed at ports and yards. The list contains the date when the electrification was taken into regular use on each section. It also notes if a section was opened as an electric railway, and if the line was prepared as an electric line, but where this was not taken into use immediately. The list contains the line and section to be electrified, and its length. The length indicates {{the length of the}} mainline section at the time of electrification. Due to changes of routes and shortening of lines, the current length of sections may be shorter. The sixth column shows the electrification system, including <b>voltage</b> <b>and</b> <b>frequency</b> in case of AC and no frequency in case of DC.|$|E

25|$|There are {{two basic}} {{standards}} for <b>voltage</b> <b>and</b> <b>frequency</b> in the world. One is the European standard of 220–240 volts at 50Hz, {{and the other is}} the North American standard of 120 volts at a frequency of 60 Hz. The differences arose for historical reasons as discussed in the article Mains electricity.|$|E
25|$|Service {{quality in}} the Dominican Republic has {{suffered}} a steady deterioration since the 1980s. Frequent and prolonged blackouts result mainly from financial causes (i.e. high system losses and low bill collection) that are further aggravated by technical factors (i.e. unadequate investments in transmission and distribution). Poor service quality is also characterized by large <b>voltage</b> <b>and</b> <b>frequency</b> fluctuations.|$|E
25|$|The {{frequency}} of the electrical system varies by country and sometimes within a country; most electric power is generated at either 50 or 60hertz. Some countries have a mixture of 50Hz and 60Hz supplies, notably electricity power transmission in Japan. A low frequency eases the design of electric motors, particularly for hoisting, crushing and rolling applications, and commutator-type traction motors for applications such as railways. However, low frequency also causes noticeable flicker in arc lamps and incandescent light bulbs. The use of lower frequencies also provided the advantage of lower impedance losses, which are proportional to frequency. The original Niagara Falls generators were built to produce 25Hz power, as a compromise between low frequency for traction and heavy induction motors, while still allowing incandescent lighting to operate (although with noticeable flicker). Most of the 25Hz residential and commercial customers for Niagara Falls power were converted to 60Hz by the late 1950s, although some 25Hz industrial customers still existed as of {{the start of the}} 21st century. 16.7Hz power (formerly 16 2/3Hz) is still used in some European rail systems, such as in Austria, Germany, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. Off-shore, military, textile industry, marine, aircraft, and spacecraft applications sometimes use 400Hz, for benefits of reduced weight of apparatus or higher motor speeds. Computer mainframe systems were often powered by 400Hz or 415Hz for benefits of ripple reduction while using smaller internal AC to DC conversion units. In any case, the input to the M-G set is the local customary <b>voltage</b> <b>and</b> <b>frequency,</b> variously 200V (Japan), 208V, 240V (North America), 380V, 400V or 415V (Europe), and variously 50Hz or 60Hz.|$|E

50|$|Mains {{electricity}} {{by country}} includes {{a list of}} countries and territories, with the plugs, <b>voltages</b> <b>and</b> <b>frequencies</b> they use for providing electrical power to small appliances and some major appliances. Every country has differing rules regarding distribution of electricity for portable appliances <b>and</b> lighting. <b>Voltage,</b> <b>frequency,</b> <b>and</b> plug type vary widely, but large regions may use common standards.

50|$|The two {{principle}} {{properties of}} the electric power supply, <b>voltage</b> <b>and</b> <b>frequency,</b> differ between regions. A voltage of (nominally) 230 V and a frequency of 50 Hz is used in Europe, most of Africa, most of Asia, much of South America and Australia. In North America, the most common combination is 120 V and a frequency of 60 Hz. Other voltages exist, and some countries may have, for example, 230 V but 60 Hz. This is a concern to travelers, since portable appliances designed for one <b>voltage</b> <b>and</b> <b>frequency</b> combination may not operate with, or may even be destroyed by another. The use of different and incompatible plugs and sockets in different regions and countries provides some protection from accidental use of appliances with incompatible <b>voltage</b> <b>and</b> <b>frequency</b> requirements.|$|E

Thus, scaling <b>voltage</b> <b>and</b> <b>frequency,</b> which is commonly done in CPUs, is considered difficult, impractical, or too risky for data corruption to apply in memories.|$|E
