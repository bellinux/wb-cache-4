The two most widely used topologies are <b>voltage</b> <b>feedback</b> (VFB) and current feedback (CFB). An overview of these topologies has been presented in previous tutorials (MT- 050, MT- 051, MT- 052), but the following discussion treats the frequency-related aspects of the two topologies in considerably more detail. HIGH SPEED <b>VOLTAGE</b> <b>FEEDBACK</b> (VFB) OP AMP TOPOLOGIES A <b>voltage</b> <b>feedback</b> (VFB) op amp is distinguished from a current feedback (CFB) op amp by circuit topology. The VFB op amp is certainly the most popular in low frequency applications, but the CFB op amp has some advantages at high frequencies.

In the presence of an inert output filter or large input ripple, however, a pulse width modulator operates in saturation mode for a prolonged period of time (with a duty cycle of 0 or 1), which leads to losses in the estimated performance and to slowing down the transient processes.
