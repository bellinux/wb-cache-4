5000|$|Neutral gear (equivalent): Most jurisdictions require {{automotive}} transmissions to have {{a neutral}} gear that decouples the engine and transmission. The HSD [...] "neutral gear" [...] is achieved by turning the electric motors off. Under this condition, the planetary gear is stationary (if the <b>vehicle</b> <b>wheels</b> are not turning); if the <b>vehicle</b> <b>wheels</b> are turning, the ring gear will rotate, causing the sun gear to rotate as well (the engine inertia will keep the carrier gear stationary unless the speed is high), while MG1 is free to rotate while the batteries do not charge. The owners manual warns that Neutral gear will eventually drain the battery, resulting in [...] "unnecessary" [...] engine power to recharge batteries; a discharged battery will render the vehicle inoperable.|$|E

40|$|Economic {{development}} {{is an attempt}} to support one of national priorities, namely accelerate economic recovery and strengthen the sustainable economic development system based on the people 2 ̆ 7 s system. These priorities determination base on issue and facing challenges and the policy in economic development in short term and medium term as well (Propenas 2012 - 2014). This study attempts to analyze the fiscal dependency level of Teluk Bintuni regency with the central government viewed from local fiscal decentralization degrees. Second, to analyze the influence of vehicle taxes on local revenue, which is regional potency to develop local fiscal independency. This research uses secondary data (time series) from year 2010 to 2014. This data analyzed in linear regression. Based on the calculation the transfer variable (x 1) shows calculated t of 3, 659; the number of <b>vehicles</b> <b>wheels</b> 4 or more (x 2) shows calculated t of 3, 595; the number of <b>vehicles</b> <b>wheels</b> 2 (x 3) shows calculated t of 4, 140; and regional investment (x 4) shows calculated t of 4, 595; with the significance level smaller than 0, 05 so it can be concluded that the variables partially free and significant impact on the local revenue Teluk Bintuni regency. The f value of 23, 468 (23, 468 > 9, 12) with the significance of 0, 000 (0, 000 < 0, 05) that can be concluded that four independent variables which are the transfer, the number of <b>vehicles</b> <b>wheels</b> 4 or more, the number of <b>vehicles</b> <b>wheels</b> 2, and investment, together affecting the local revenue of Teluk Bintuni regency.

50|$|Rail <b>vehicle</b> <b>wheels</b> {{are usually}} {{mounted on a}} solid axle, so they turn at the same speed. When a vehicle turns the outer wheel has to travel further than the inner wheel. On a road vehicle, this is usually {{achieved}} by allowing the wheels to move independently, and fixing the front wheels in an arrangement known as Ackermann steering geometry.|$|E
5000|$|In larger {{communities}} blacksmiths often {{worked in}} conjunction with wheelwrights to manufacture and repair <b>vehicle</b> <b>wheels.</b> Although combination blacksmith-wheelwright shops persisted into the 20th century, their focus gradually changed from the manufacture of one-of-a-kind items to the repair of factory-produced goods. Eventually the availability of mass-produced parts {{as well as the}} advent of the automobile age rendered both blacksmiths and wheelwrights obsolete.|$|E
50|$|Wheels {{used for}} Road-rail {{vehicles}} are normally smaller than those found on {{other types of}} rollingstock (such as locomotives or carriages). This is because the wheel has to be stored clear of the ground when the vehicle is in road-going mode - Such wheels can be as small as 245 mm in diameter. In Australia, wheels for Road-rail vehicles should {{comply with the requirements}} of AS7514.4 which is the standard for infrastructure maintenance <b>vehicle</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{main idea}} of this system {{is to use a}} linear {{reluctance}} motor for drive, guidance and suspension. This motor uses the same forces that drive rotative motors, but without a mechanical transmission to apply the torque to the <b>vehicle</b> <b>wheels.</b> Instead, these forces are applied between the vehicle and the rail, reducing mechanical friction and wear. Also, the TELMAGV can climb steeper gradients than a conventional system because it does not depend on friction between wheel and rail for propulsion.|$|E
50|$|Worlds in Vangers were {{designed}} by means of Surmap A.R.T., K-D Lab's proprietary terrain editor, and the accompanying voxel-polygonal technology. Minor worlds are modeled to occupy thorus surfaces, while three major inhabited worlds form the side surfaces of long cylinders (or rather thori with a single strong barrier set poloidally). Objects {{of the world are}} destructible, e.g. <b>vehicle</b> <b>wheels</b> and other impacts leave traces on the ground. Scripted conditional processes are set to affect the terrain. There is a player-controlled option to either keep all changes to the terrain on the hard disk or discard the changes each time the game starts.|$|E
5000|$|In the 18th century, tracked systems called plateways were {{constructed}} {{in areas of}} Scotland where minerals were extracted; the need was to convey the heavy product to a river or a harbour, in many cases over a relatively short distance, so that water-borne transport could take it to market. By 1830 the technology had progressed and railway lines using edge rails (in which the <b>vehicle</b> <b>wheels,</b> rather than the plate [...] "rails" [...] had flanges for guidance) became commonplace. The Monkland and Kirkintilloch Railway of 1826 may {{be regarded as the}} pioneer in showing the way forward.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new method to generate power from a rotating <b>vehicle</b> <b>wheel</b> using a Thunder trade piezoelectric generator. The approach uses centripetal force to generate {{an impact on}} the piezoelectric transducer. The device was designed to be mounted on a vehicle rim. A generator with a volume of 2 cm/sup 3 / produced 4 mW of electrical power at 800 rpm using a test wheel with 0. 12 m diameter. Analytical results showed that the same amount of power can be produced by mounting the generator on a <b>vehicle</b> <b>wheel</b> with a diameter of 13 inches and a linear speed of 28. 4 miles/h...|$|R
50|$|Vehicles can {{be fitted}} with dual brakes, vacuum and air, {{provided}} {{that there is}} room to fit the duplicated equipment. In a dual fitted vehicle, there would be both a vacuum cylinder and one or more air brake cylinders, all operating on {{the same set of}} rigging to apply the brakes at the <b>vehicle</b> <b>wheels.</b> Some of BR's Mk1 coaches were built with dual brakes (all had vacuum as standard) and {{much of the rest of}} the fleet was dual fitted by the 1980s, so they could be worked by air or vacuum fitted locomotives as the changeover from vacuum to air took place between 1970 and the early 1990s.|$|E
5000|$|Temporal {{anti-aliasing}} (TAA) {{seeks to}} reduce or remove the effects of temporal aliasing. Temporal aliasing {{is caused by the}} sampling rate (i.e. number of frames per second) of a scene being too low compared to the transformation speed of objects inside of the scene; this causes objects to appear to jump or appear at a location instead of giving the impression of smoothly moving towards them. To avoid aliasing artifacts altogether, the sampling rate of a scene must be at least twice as high as the fastest moving object. The shutter behavior of the sampling system (typically a camera) strongly influences aliasing, as the overall shape of the exposure over time determines the band-limiting of the system before sampling, an important factor in aliasing. A temporal anti-aliasing filter can be applied to a camera to achieve better band-limiting. [...] A common example of temporal aliasing in film is the appearance of <b>vehicle</b> <b>wheels</b> travelling backwards, the so-called wagon-wheel effect. Temporal anti-aliasing can also help to reduce jaggies, making images appear softer.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vehicle</b> <b>wheels</b> may lock-up due to {{excessive}} wheel torque over tire-road friction forces available, caused by too much hydraulic line pressure. The ABS monitors wheel speeds and releases pressure on individual wheel brake lines, rapidly pulsing individual brakes to prevent lock-up. During heavy braking, preventing wheel lock-up helps the driver maintain steering control. Four channel ABS systems have an individual brake line {{for each of}} the four wheels, enabling different braking pressure on different road surfaces. Three channel systems are equipped with a sensor for each wheel, but control the rear brakes as a single unit. For example, less braking pressure is needed to lock a wheel on ice than a wheel which is on bare asphalt. If the left wheels are on asphalt and the right wheels are on ice, during an emergency stop, ABS detects the right wheels about to lock and reduces braking force on the right front wheel. Four channel systems also reduce brake force on the right rear wheel, while a three channel system would also reduce force on both back wheels. Both systems help avoid lock-up and loss of vehicle control.|$|E

5000|$|Vehicle do not behave {{the same}} way on chassis {{dynamometer}} as on the road. For example, aerodynamic shape of the vehicle does not matter. Sum of all forces on the vehicle on a real road are simulated through tires on chassis dynamometer.Increasing air drag with the speed on the road manifests as increasing braking force of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>wheels.</b> The aim {{is to make the}} vehicle on the dynamometer accelerate and decelerate {{the same way}} as on a real road.First you need to know the parameters of the [...] "behavior" [...] of the vehicle on a real road.In order to get [...] "road parameters", vehicle must be driving on ideal flat road with no wind from any direction, gear set to neutral and time needed to slow down without braking is measured in certain intervals i.e. 100-90 km/h, 90-80 km/h, 80-70 km/h 70-60 km/h etc. Slowing down from higher speed takes shorter time mainly due to air resistance.Those parameters are later set in dynamometer workstation, together with vehicle inertia. Vehicle is restrained and so called vehicle adaptation has to be performed.During vehicle adaptation dynamometer automatically slowing down from set speed, changing its own [...] "dyno parameters" [...] and trying to get same deceleration in given intervals as on real road. Those parameters are then valid for this vehicle type. Changing of set simulated inertia it is possible to simulate vehicle ability to accelerate if fully loaded, with setting gradient it is possible to simulate force if vehicle going downhill etc. Chassis dynamometers for climatic chamber does exists, where it is possible to change temperature in give range i.e. -40 to +50 °C or altitude chamber where it is possible to check fuel consumption with different temperatures or pressure and to simulate driving on mountain roads.|$|E
40|$|A {{mechanically}} decoupled {{steering system}} enables autonomous or semi-autonomous vehicle steering by independently actuating the <b>vehicle</b> <b>wheels</b> and the steering wheel. In semi-autonomous operation the steering {{system should be}} controlled such that the <b>vehicle</b> <b>wheels</b> angle tracks a reference signal provided by the trajectory planner rapidly and safely, while guaranteeing that a certain alignment is maintained between {{the steering wheel and}} the <b>vehicle</b> <b>wheels</b> to avoid loss of drivers panic. We develop a controller for a mechanically decoupled steering system that can achieve this by coordinating the steering column and the steering rack actuators, while enforcing constraints on the motion of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>wheels,</b> on the interaction between the steering wheel with the driver, and on the relative motion between steering wheel and <b>vehicle</b> <b>wheels.</b> Our de-sign is based on a particular command governor, for which convergence is proven.
