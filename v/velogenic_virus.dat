40|$|Background: Wild aquatic {{birds are}} {{considered}} as reservoir hosts for Newcastle disease viruses (NDVs) and may act as vectors for transferring these viruses to poultry, causing outbreaks of disease. Recent studies {{suggested that the}} <b>velogenic</b> <b>viruses</b> arise from avirulent strains originating from wild birds. Objectives: The primary objective {{of this study was}} to determine whether the aquatic birds of Khozestan province were infected with NDV. Materials and Methods: In winter, 24 Muscovey ducks from Shoshtar, 20 geese from Dezfoul and 51 geese from Khorramshahr (Aquatic birds of Khozestan province) were bled, and birds' sera were collected and used in HI assay and antibody titer to NDV were determined. Beta procedure of hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay was performed in U-bottomed 96 -well microtiter plates with 0. 5 % chicken erythrocytes. Results: All serum samples tested for antibodies against hemagglutinin by HI assay had positive results, and all of these birds had high levels of antibody titer to the NDV. Conclusion: The results in the present study clearly showed that the aquatic birds of Khozestan province population in Iran carries NDVs, and may act as one of the important reservoirs for this virus. So it was concluded that detection and elimination of these birds can be a valuable tool for the control of Newcastle Disease outbreaks...|$|R

40|$|Degenerate {{oligonucleotide}} primers were synthesized to amplify nucleotide sequences from {{portions of the}} fusion protein and matrix protein genes of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) genomic RNA {{that could be used}} diagnostically. These primers were used in a single-tube reverse transcription PCR of NDV genomic RNA coupled to direct nucleotide sequencing of the amplified product to characterize more than 30 NDV isolates. In agreement with previous reports, differences in the fusion protein cleavage sequence that correlated genotypically with virulence among various NDV pathotypes were detected. By using sequences generated from the matrix protein gene coding for the nuclear localization signal, lentogenic viruses were again grouped phylogenetically separate from other pathotypes. These techniques were applied to compare neurotropic <b>velogenic</b> <b>viruses</b> isolated from an outbreak of Newcastle disease in cormorants and turkeys. Cormorant NDV isolates and an NDV isolate from an infected turkey flock in North Dakota had the fusion protein cleavage sequence 109 SRGRRQKRFVG 119. The R-for-G substitution at position 110 may be unique for the cormorant-type isolates. Although the amino acid sequences from the fusion protein cleavage site were identical, nucleotide sequence data correlate the outbreak in turkeys to a cormorant virus isolate from Minnesota and not to a cormorant virus isolate from Michigan. On the basis of sequence information, the cormorant isolates are virulent viruses related to isolates of psittacine origin, possibly genotypically distinct from other velogenic NDV isolates. These techniques can be used reliably for Newcastle disease epidemiology and for prediction of pathotypes of NDV isolates without traditional live-bird inoculations...|$|R

The other two groups were kept at a continuous temperature of 41. 8 ± 0. 6 °C {{with one of them}} supplemented with AA (H A) and other receiving no AA (H O). The group RO served as the control. Ascorbic acid was supplemented at the rate of 1000 mg/kg feed. Twelve birds in each of four groups were challenged oculonsally with a pigeon isolate of <b>velogenic</b> ND <b>virus</b> and the rest left as in contact. Morbidity rate was 100 % in all challenged and in contact birds except in the incontact of the group supplemented with AA which recorded 50 %. One hundred percent mortality was recorded in heat stressed groups irrespective of AA supplementation while 0 % and 50 % mortality was recorded in those kept at room temperature with or without AA supplementation respectively. None of the unchallenged in contact birds died in any of the groups. Lesions of ND in the experimentally infected quails were characterized by pathological lesions. The results of haemagglutination inhibition test performed on blood samples of all birds on days 0, 7, 14 and 21 post inoculations indicated no effect of heat treatment or AA supplementation on the humoral immune response of the Japanese quail. It was concluded that prolonged high ambient temperature has detrimental effects on the survival of Japanese quail with AA supplementation having some ameliorating effects. High ambient temperature may not adversely affect the humoral immune response of Japanese quail to Newcastle disease and AA may not be an important factor in the resistance of quails exposed to prolonged high ambient temperature to ND virus infection...|$|R

Immunohistochemically, ND virus antigens were seen in the lesions mentioned above. The ND virus could not induce the encephalitis and pancreatitis that were observed in the natural case of ND in vaccinated chickens. There was no clinical disease in vaccinated chickens after {{the challenge of the}} ND virus. In diluted ND vaccine experiments, chickens vaccinated with a high dilution of vaccine and then challenged with the ND virus showed clinical sign and mortality with pancreatic focal necrosis. Vaccine diluted with fresh tap water had no effect on protection against the challenge of the ND virus.

40|$|ABSTRACT Despite the {{intensive}} vaccination programs used for controlling Newcastle disease (ND) in the Iranian poultry industry, outbreaks of ND {{have been reported}} in poultry farms. This study was conducted {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} vaccines for the protection against ND infection and virus-shedding period of <b>velogenic</b> Newcastle disease <b>virus</b> (vNDV) field strain after different immunization schemes. Eight groups of commercial broiler chickens were used. Six groups were vaccinated with different vaccination programs using commercial live and inactivated ND vaccines. All groups, except for group 8, were challenged with a virulent field isolate (104 EID 50 /bird) at 28 days of age. Clinical signs, mortality rate and gross lesions were investigated. Antibody titers were assayed by hemagglutination inhibition test and fecal virus shedding was determined for 14 days post challenge (dpc) with 3 -day intervals by the RT-PCR method. All unvaccinated-challenged control birds died. Vaccination with these ND vaccines protected chickens from clinical disease. The mortality rate in the vaccinated groups was significantly lower than in the positive control group. However, vaccinated chickens shed the challenge virus in fecal samples. Although the different vaccination regimens displayed close degrees of protection against the disease, the best protection was observed in broilers primed with the live B 1 vaccine via eye drop simultaneously with inactivated vaccine at 8 days of age and boosted with B 1 or LaSota via drinking water on day 18. In conclusion, the currently used vaccines with different vaccination schemes can protect chickens against the disease in areas where ND is endemic, while the spread of the field virus to other flocks cannot be prevented...|$|R
