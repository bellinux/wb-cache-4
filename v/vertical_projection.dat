6000|$|This plant, the scarlet-runner of English gardeners and the Phaseolus coccineus of Lamarck, {{originally}} {{came from}} Mexico, as I am informed by Mr. Bentham. The flowers are so constructed that hive and humble-bees, which visit them incessantly, almost always alight {{on the left}} wing-petal, as they can best suck the nectar from this side. Their weight and movements depress the petal, and this causes the stigma to protrude from the spirally-wound keel, and a brush of hairs round the stigma pushes out the pollen before it. The pollen adheres to the head or proboscis of the bee which is at work, and is thus placed either on the stigma of the same flower, or is carried to another flower. (5/4. The flowers have been described by Delpino, and in an admirable manner by Mr. Farrer in the 'Annals and Magazine of Natural History' volume 2 4th series October 1868 page 256. My son Francis has explained 'Nature' January 8, 1874 page 189, the use of one peculiarity in their structure, namely, a little <b>vertical</b> <b>projection</b> on the single free stamen near its base, which seems placed as if to guard the entrance into the two nectar-holes in the staminal sheath. He shows that this projection prevents the bees reaching the nectar, unless {{they go to the}} left side of the flower, and it is absolutely necessary for cross-fertilisation that they should alight on the left wing-petal.) Several years ago I covered some plants under a large net, and these produced on one occasion about one-third, and on another occasion about one-eighth, of the number of pods which the same number of uncovered plants growing close alongside produced. (5/5. 'Gardeners' Chronicle' 1857 page 725 and more especially ibid 1858 page 828. Also 'Annals and Magazine of Natural History' 3rd series volume 2 1858 page 462.) This lessened fertility was not caused by any injury from the net, as I moved the wing-petals of several protected flowers, in the same manner as bees do, and these produced remarkably fine pods. When the net was taken off, the flowers were immediately visited by bees, and it was interesting to observe how quickly the plants became covered with young pods. As the flowers are much frequented by Thrips, the self-fertilisation of most of the flowers under the net may have been due to the action of these minute insects. Dr. Ogle likewise covered up a large portion of a plant, and [...] "out of a vast number of blossoms thus protected not a single one produced a pod, while the unprotected blossoms were for the most part fruitful." [...] Mr. Belt gives a more curious case; this plant grows well and flowers in Nicaragua; but as none of the native bees visit the flowers, not a single pod is ever produced. (5/6. Dr. Ogle 'Popular Science Review' 1870 page 168. Mr. Belt 'The Naturalist in Nicaragua' 1874 page 70. The latter author gives a case 'Nature' 1875 page 26, of a late crop of Phaseolus multiflorus near London which [...] "was rendered barren" [...] by the humble-bees cutting, as they frequently do, holes at the bases of the flowers instead of entering them in the proper manner.) ...|$|E

The nest building ability of the male is also sexually selected; females will lay more eggs and at an earlier date with males who are better at nest construction, with the opposite being true with males that are not. After building the nest, barn swallows may nest colonially where sufficient high-quality nest sites are available, and within a colony, each pair defends a territory around the nest which, for the European subspecies, is 4 to 8 m2 in size. Colony size tends to be larger in North America.|$|E
50|$|Strike slip dulexes are passive structures; {{they form}} as a {{response}} to displacement of the bounding fault rather than by the stresses from plate motion. Each horse has a length that varies from half to twice the spacing between the bounding fault planes. Depending on the properties of the rocks and the fault, the duplexes will have different length ratios and will develop on either major or subtle offsets, although it is possible to observe duplex structures that develop on nearly straight fault segments.Because the motion of the duplexes may be heterogeneous, the individual horses can experience a rotation with a horizontal axis, which results in the formation of scissor faults. Scissor faults exhibit normal motion {{at one end of the}} horse and a thrust motion ant the other end. Because strike slip duplexes structures have more horizontal motion than vertical motion, they are best observed on a map rather than a <b>vertical</b> <b>projection,</b> and are a good indication that the main fault has a strike slip motion.|$|E
