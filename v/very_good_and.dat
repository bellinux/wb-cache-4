5|$|For {{many years}} only one fossil Nectocaris was known, poorly {{preserved}} {{and without a}} counterpart. This fossil was a puzzle, as its head looked rather like that of an arthropod but its body, with {{what seemed to be}} fins along its back and belly, looked rather like of a chordate's. In 2010 Smith and Caron described another 91 specimens, some <b>very</b> <b>good,</b> <b>and</b> reconstructed it as a cephalopod, and the earliest one as of 2010. Unlike later cephalopods it had only two arms, and its eyes seem mounted on stalks. But it had a soft funnel, similar to the ones used for propulsion by modern cephalopods.|$|E

25|$|Judaism, {{at least}} in the Second Temple Period at Qumran, {{traditionally}} held {{that there would be a}} resurrection of just and unjust, but of the <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> very bad, and of Jews only. The extent of the resurrection in 2 Baruch and 4 Ezra is debated by scholars.|$|E
25|$|Originally, {{spectral}} designations {{were based}} on inferences of an asteroid's composition. However, the correspondence between spectral class and composition is not always <b>very</b> <b>good,</b> <b>and</b> a variety of classifications are in use. This has led to significant confusion. Although asteroids of different spectral classifications {{are likely to be}} composed of different materials, there are no assurances that asteroids within the same taxonomic class are composed of similar materials.|$|E

25|$|Superior {{and much}} more {{expensive}} {{is the use of}} interference contrast. Differences in optical density will show up as differences in relief. A nucleus within a cell will actually show up as a globule in the most often used differential interference contrast system according to Georges Nomarski. However, it has to be kept in mind that this is an optical effect, and the relief does not necessarily resemble the true shape. Contrast is <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> the condenser aperture can be used fully open, thereby reducing the depth of field and maximizing resolution.|$|E
25|$|One {{thing the}} two groups did agree on was {{that they wanted to}} {{discourage}} any more miners from coming up the following year. Though obliged to report their earnings, they all intended to report that the diggings were not <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> that more should be known of the country before any discoveries were reported. With the exception of Patrick Kelly and Vital LaForce, who stayed at Fort St. James, the other miners all returned to Quesnel with the news that the venture had only been marginally successful. However, suspicions were raised when the men announced they were returning to Vital Creek for the winter and even more eyebrows were raised when it was discovered that LaForce and Kelly had spent an astounding $2500 at the Fort St. James trading post.|$|E
25|$|Surviving French {{officers}} had increased tactical experience against German mobile units; increased {{confidence in their}} weapons after seeing their artillery, which the Wehrmacht post-battle analysis recognised as technically <b>very</b> <b>good,</b> <b>and</b> their tanks perform better in combat than the German armour. The French tanks were now known to have heavier armour and armament. Between 23 and 28 May, they reconstituted the French Seventh and Tenth armies. Weygand decided on hedgehog tactics, which were to implement defence in depth operations and use delaying tactics, to inflict maximum attrition on German units. He employed units in towns and small villages, as well as major towns and cities and fortified them 360° along their perimeter. Behind this, the new infantry, armoured and half-mechanised divisions formed up, ready to counter-attack and relieve the surrounded units, which were ordered to hold out at all costs.|$|E

25|$|Bird skin parka (tamacenaq in Yup'ik) {{made from}} skins of birds of the Alcidae, Anatidae, Gaviidae, and Laridae families. Bird skins make <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> warm parkas. Thick bird skin parkas were ideal winter wear but {{were also used}} during cold weather in summer. Yupik (Yup'ik, Siberian Yupik, Sugpiaq ~ Alutiiq) and Inuit (Inupiaq) Eskimo seamstresses had {{regional}} variations in bird skin preparation techniques and bird skin parka styles and bird skin clothing-production techniques. Bird skin parkas are rarely made today and the skill is quickly disappearing among skin sewers in their region. During the 19th century, many Yup'iks along the coast between the Yukon and Kuskokwim rivers wore bird skins. Every year, one could afford to make a bird skin parka because birds returned in such abundance. A plump Yup'ik baby trussed up in eider skin smiled from a warm, dry, cushioned world.|$|E
25|$|Small colon impactions {{represent}} {{a small number}} of colics in the horse, and are usually caused by obstruction from fecaliths, enteroliths, and meconium. Horses usually present with standard colic signs (pawing, flank watching, rolling) in 82% of horses, and occasionally with diarrhea (31%), anorexia (30%), straining (12%), and depression (11%), and rectal examination will reveal firm loops of small colon or actually palpable obstruction in the rectum. Impactions are most common in miniature horses, possibly because they do not masticate their feed as well, and during the fall and winter. Medical management includes the aggressive use of fluids, laxatives and lubricants, and enemas, as well as analgesics and anti-inflammatories. However, these impactions often require surgical intervention, and the surgeon will empty the colon either by enterotomy or by lubricants and massage. Surgical intervention usually results in longer recovery time at the hospital. Prognosis is <b>very</b> <b>good,</b> <b>and</b> horses treated with surgical treatment had a survival with return to athletic function rate of 91%, while 89% of the medically managed horses returned to previous use.|$|E
25|$|Those who are {{suffering}} most keenly, and who have lost most, either of their children by death or their possessions by fire and sword, such as those reconcentrated women in the camps, have the most conspicuous patience, and never express a wish that their men should {{be the ones to}} give way. It must be fought out now, they think, to the bitter end. It is a very costly business upon which England has embarked, and even at such a cost hardly the barest necessities can be provided, and no comforts. It is so strange to think that every tent contains a family, and every family is in trouble–loss behind, poverty in front, sickness, privation and death in the present. But they are <b>very</b> <b>good,</b> <b>and</b> say they have agreed to be cheerful and {{make the best of it}} all. The Mafeking camp folk were very surprised to hear that English women cared a rap about them or their suffering. It has done them a lot of good to hear that real sympathy is felt for them at home, and so I am glad I fought my way here, if only for that reason.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in Cuernavaca, Morelos at the JS Studios. [...] "I {{went to one of}} his houses for a day and in less than seven hours my part of the album was ready, he put everything on the table, it's <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> romantic." [...] Fernández kept his mariachi style on the album and the producer only added more tamboras; the singer was confident that this album {{was going to be a}} success, since his audience was demanding his union with Sebastian.|$|E
500|$|In August 1967, McCartney met the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi at the London Hilton {{and later}} went to Bangor in North Wales {{to attend a}} weekend {{initiation}} conference, where {{he and the other}} Beatles learned the basics of Transcendental Meditation. He said, [...] "The whole meditation experience was <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> I still use the mantra... I find it soothing." [...] In 2009, McCartney and Starr headlined a benefit concert at Radio City Music Hall, raising threemillion dollars for the David Lynch Foundation to fund instruction in Transcendental Meditation for at-risk youth.|$|E
500|$|However, {{the band}} {{have since been}} dismissive and {{critical}} of the work. Recalling the album in later years, Waters said: [...] "Ummagumma – what a disaster!", while in 1995, Gilmour described the album as [...] "horrible". In a 1984 interview, Mason said: [...] "I {{thought it was a}} <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>and</b> interesting little exercise, the whole business of everyone doing a bit. But I still feel really that that's quite {{a good example of the}} sum being greater than the parts..." [...] Later, he described it as [...] "a failed experiment", adding that [...] "the most significant thing is that we didn't do it again".|$|E
