It is used in addition to surgery mainly in otorhinolaryngology (ENT). More than 80% of the Hartmann alligator forceps are produced in Pakistan in small workshops handmade in many variations of the mouth. Their quality depends on the origin {{and quality of the}} stainless steel. Indian steel is used often for hobbyist use. FDA and CE certified instruments also <b>veterinary</b> <b>instruments</b> are normal made of Japanese or German steel.The shaft length varies up to one meter, is predominantly 8 to 12 cm. Only the top mouth opens alligator-like. (in US therefore has the medical term [...] "Alligator Mouth" [...] or [...] "Hartmann Alligator Forceps" [...] enforced. A common name also is [...] "Crocodile forceps"). The standard length of the muzzle from the front hinge implementation is 1.5 cm or 1 cm. Thus, the clamp is used where normal tweezers or fine instruments are struggling to grasp small objects. So you can even grasp objects in small tubes and position them precisely.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the diagnostic accuracy of a <b>veterinary</b> laser hematology <b>instrument</b> for routine CBC by comparison with a standard analyzer. EDTA blood samples of 162 dogs, 41 cats, and 54 horses were analysed. Results showed an excellent correlation for RBC, HGB, Hct, and total WBC in all species examined, and good to fair correlation for MCV, RDW, neutrophils, and eosinophils only in dogs and horses. For lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils, and all platelet parameters there wasnâ€™t correlation in 3 species. We conclude that performances of this hematology analyzer for veterinary practice are good for the majority of RBC parameters and total WBC in dogs, cats, and horses. Microscopic assessment of blood smears is instead necessary for estimation of the others parameters...|$|R
