40|$|A {{spool valve}} as a flow {{direction}} control valve has usually been used in a hydraulic system. In recent years, some hydraulic actuator systems need high accuracy control of the spool valve {{in order to control}} the delivery precisely. For the reason, it is very important practically to know dynamic motion of the spool. To analyze the dynamic characteristics of the spool valve, it is necessary to consider the dynamic motion of the spool. Springs, solenoids and working fluid, which is pressurized by the pump in the circuit, support the spool. The motion of the spool is governed complicatedly by pressure force, flow force, electromagnetic force and mechanical spring force acting on itself. As a result, it is difficult to analyze the dynamic motion of the spool, and therefore, any commercial code to calculate the dynamic characteristics of the spool valve dose not exist at present.

40|$|Understanding the fluid-structure {{interaction}} and fluid dynamics downstream of an obstruction {{is crucial in}} the design and fabrication of devices that find application in both medicine and industry. It is known that the fluid flow patterns downstream of an obstruction may be very complex and are three dimensional, including the formation of vortices, recirculating flow, flow separation and the onset of turbulence. The development of any such pattern of flow might be detrimental to the optimal performance of the flow system. In this work we have used the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique to investigate flow dynamics downstream of an artificial heart valve. MRI is a naturally three-dimensional, non-invasive technique that finds application in clinical, biomedical research and materials research. It has the capability to visualize the internal structure of materials and also to quantify mass transport properties. In this in vitro study, we have measured the turbulent diffusivity and velocity downstream of the valve in two configurations (fully opened and partially opened). Our particular implementation of the MRI measurement (known as SPRITE imaging) is unusually robust to fast turbulent flows and has been demonstrated effective at Reynolds numbers on the order 105, much higher than possible with most conventional, clinical MRI techniques. The results showed a low turbulent diffusivity downstream of the fully opened valve configuration, while the turbulent diffusivity is higher downstream of the partially opened <b>valve</b> <b>coupled</b> with a high-velocity fluid jet and recirculating flow.

This hydraulics based variable valve timing system is capable of controlling an engine valves lift height and infinitely varying the engine valves lift profile. Along with full valve controllability during normal operation, the variable valve timing system is capable of providing the same operation as a classic cam shaft under engine power loss conditions. This is possible due to the rotating hydraulic spool <b>valves</b> <b>coupled</b> to the engines crank shaft, which are used to actuate the engine poppet valves. The main focus of this thesis is to investigate, alter and implement a new iteration of the hydraulic variable valve timing system on a standalone test bench to validate the systems operating principles.

This serves as an intermediate step to full engine implementation of the variable valve timing system.

Internal roughness of the pipe is referred {{to the level of}} corrosion occurring, where normally it is difficult to be monitored online. Acoustic Emission (AE) technique can be used as an alternative solution to the corrosion monitoring in pipes, especially for complex pipelines and difficult to achieve by other monitoring devices. The objective of this project is to study the AE signals emitted from internal surface pipe and to classify the internal surface pipe roughness using Bangi Number, AB. This study used the hydraulic bench to provide fluid flow at four different pressures in pipes with different internal surface roughness (rough and smooth). The main source of acoustic emission was from activity in the control <b>valve,</b> <b>coupled</b> with high pressure water flow friction in the inner surface of the pipe.

40|$|The {{combustion}} {{characteristics in}} an engine cylinder can greatly change over {{a range of}} speeds and loads. However, conventional engines x the timing and amount of intake and exhaust, {{which can lead to}} higher emissions, wasted fuel, and lower power output. This thesis studies the application of a hydraulics based variable valve actuation system to change the valves' lift and timing on a single cylinder spark ignition engine. In addition to controlling the valve actuation, a hydraulics based design has the advantage of protecting against engine failure in cases of electrical power loss, reverting the system to behave as a conventional camshaft valve train. The research extends the previous iterations of the hydraulics design to prevent leakage, retain pressure, and reliably open and close the engine valves. A hydraulic cylinder is used to replace the conventional cam where pressurized fluid opens, and spring force closes, the engine valve. The pressurized fluid is supplied to, or removed from, the cylinder using rotary spool <b>valves</b> <b>coupled</b> to the engine crankshaft. Additionally, the system is modelled in Simulink to determine the effect of system pressure, flow area, and spring rate on the resulting valve pro file. After modelling the system's performance for achieving variable lift and timing, the system was designed, manufactured, and tested on a single cylinder engine {{with the aid of a}} dynamometer. Experimental results for valve lift showed good agreement with the simulation models. Majority of the tests were performed using manual control, followed by experiments with active control of the system pressure to reach a desired valve lift. The lift controller is able to achieve the desired valve actuation in under 2 seconds with active pressure feedback. Lastly, the ability of the hydraulic variable valve system as a viable alternative is shown by achieving combustion at 1500 RPM engine idle speed...|$|R
