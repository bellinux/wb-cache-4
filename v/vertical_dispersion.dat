40|$|Abstract The {{mechanisms}} {{driving the}} salt flux in the Modaomen estuary were investigated using measurements from along-channel shipboard surveys over a spring-neap tide cycle. During the investigation, river discharge was controlled to increase sharply and then decrease gently. The measurement {{data were analyzed}} with composition method. The results show that exchange flow varied significantly over the spring–neap cycle, being weakest during middle tides and strongest during neap tides. It could be concluded that sub-tidal <b>vertical</b> shear <b>dispersion,</b> resulting from the estuarine exchange flow, is the dominant mechanism driving the salt flux since the salt flux resulting from <b>vertical</b> shear <b>dispersion</b> varies in amplitude by over an order of magnitude, which is close to two times {{as large as the}} variation of advective salt flux. Intorduction It is every difficult to measure the tidally averaged salt fluxes because the amplitude of the fluctuating component of the instantaneous salt flux, due primarily to tidal advection of the mean along-channel salinity gradient, can exceed the tidally averaged salt flux by an order of magnitude or more. Small errors or biases in measuring the instantaneous salt flux, therefore, can lead to large errors in the estimate of the tidally averaged and cross-sectionally integrated salt flux[1 - 3]...|$|R

50|$|A ribbon tweeter uses a {{very thin}} {{diaphragm}} (often of aluminum, or perhaps metalized plastic film) that supports a planar coil frequently made by deposition of aluminium vapor, suspended in a powerful magnetic field (typically provided by neodymium magnets) to reproduce high frequencies. The development of ribbon tweeters has more or less followed the development of ribbon microphones. The ribbon is of very lightweight material and so capable of very high acceleration and extended high frequency response. Ribbons have traditionally been incapable of high output (large magnet gaps leading to poor magnetic coupling is the main reason). But higher power versions of ribbon tweeters are becoming common in large-scale sound reinforcement line array systems, which can serve audiences of thousands. They are attractive in these applications since nearly all ribbon tweeters inherently exhibit useful directional properties, with very wide horizontal dispersion (coverage) and very tight <b>vertical</b> <b>dispersion.</b> These drivers can easily be stacked vertically, building a high frequency line array that produces high sound pressure levels much {{farther away from the}} speaker locations than do conventional tweeters.|$|E

Our spectroscopic target sample of 235 of the bluest UV knots surrounding NGC 628 yielded 15 H_alpha detections (6 %), roughly the number expected given the different mean ages of the two populations. The measured <b>vertical</b> velocity <b>dispersion</b> of the H_alpha knots between 1 - 1. 8 R 25 (13. 5 - 23. 2 kpc) is < 11 km/s. We assume that the H_alpha knots trace an 'intermediate' vertical mass density distribution (between the isothermal sech(z) ^ 2 and exponential distributions) with a constant scaleheight across the outer disk (h_z = 700 pc) and estimate a total surface mass density of 7. 5 solar masses/pc^ 2.

40|$|INTRODUCTION In {{an ideal}} {{electron}} storage ring, the {{horizontal and vertical}} motions are independent, resulting in an extremely small beam height. In practice, ring imperfections result in a coupling of horizontal and vertical transverse oscillations (betatron coupling) as well as vertical motion associated with energy oscillations (<b>vertical</b> <b>dispersion).</b> The coupling and <b>vertical</b> <b>dispersion</b> then determine the beam height. The vertical emittance (e y /b y) characterizes the excitation of vertical betatron motion. As a result of coupling, both transverse oscillation modes include vertical motion, and both modes are excited by photon emission in bending magnets. With non-zero <b>vertical</b> <b>dispersion</b> in bending magnets, photon emission excites vertical motion {{even in the absence}} of coupling. These effects give rise to vertical emittance [2].

40|$|We {{study the}} {{relation}} between stellar ages and <b>vertical</b> velocity <b>dispersion</b> (the age-velocity relation, or AVR) {{in a sample of}} seven simulated disc galaxies. In our simulations, the shape of the AVR for stars younger than 9 Gyr depends strongly on the merger history at low redshift, with even 1 : 10 - 1 : 15 mergers being able to create jumps in the AVR (although these jumps might not be detectable if the errors on stellar ages are on the order of 30 %). For galaxies with a quiescent history at low redshift, we find that the <b>vertical</b> velocity <b>dispersion</b> rises smoothly for ages up to 8 - 9 Gyr, following a power law with a slope of ~ 0. 5, similar to what is observed in the solar neighbourhood by the Geneva-Copenhagen Survey. For these galaxies, we show that the slope of the AVR is not imprinted at birth, but is the result of subsequent heating. By contrast, in all our simulations, the oldest stars form a significantly different population, with a high velocity dispersion. These stars are usually born kinematically hot in a turbulent phase of intense mergers at high redshift, and also include some stars accreted from satellites. This maximum in velocity dispersion is strongly decreased when age errors are included, suggesting that observations can easily miss such a jump with the current accuracy of age measurements.
