5|$|Kentrosaurus can be {{distinguished}} from {{other members of the}} Stegosauria by a number of osteological characters. Mallison (2011) provided a revised diagnosis, an updated list of distinguishing traits or autapomorphies. Most notably, the neural spines, the blade-like upper extensions of the vertebrae, in the tail do not run sub-parallel, as in most dinosaurs. In the front third of the tail, they point backwards, the usual direction. In the middle tail, however, they are almost vertical, and further back they are hook-shaped and point obliquely forward. Also typical is that the dorsal (back) vertebrae have a neural arch more than twice as high as the centrum, the <b>vertebral</b> <b>body,</b> and almost completely occupied by the extremely spacious neural canal. The preacetabular process, front blade, of the ilium widens laterally, to the front outer side, and does not taper.|$|E

40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of squaring of the <b>vertebral</b> <b>bodies</b> is analysed in a 25 {{year old}} patient with ankylosing spondylitis. The squaring derives from a straightening of the anterior contour. The disease was diagnosed {{five years before}} the patient's death. The remodelling of bone that explains squaring of the <b>vertebral</b> <b>bodies</b> is described for the first time. Histologically, an acute and chronic spondylitis with destruction and simultaneous rebuilding of the cortex and the spongiosa of the <b>vertebral</b> <b>bodies</b> has been found.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: No prior {{report has}} {{comprehensively}} discussed the intravertebral vac-uum cleft sign and the fluid sign on MR images of vertebral osteonecrosis. The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate MR images of osteonecrotic <b>vertebral</b> <b>bodies</b> and adjacent intervertebral disks and <b>vertebral</b> <b>bodies.</b> METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed MR images of patients with vertebral osteonecrosis. Af-fected <b>vertebral</b> <b>bodies</b> with osteonecrosis were defined as an avascular area (nonenhanced area on enhanced T 1 -weighted images) with collections of intravertebral fluid (hyperintense signal on T 2 -weighted images), air (signal void on all images), or both. The degree of vertebral collapse was classified as mild (50 %) or severe (50 %) preserved vertebral height. Changes in adjacent interver-tebral disks or <b>vertebral</b> <b>bodies</b> 2 above and 2 below the affected vertebrae were compared. RESULTS: We enrolled 112 patients (30 men, 82 women; 121 <b>vertebral</b> <b>bodies)</b> in our study. Intraver-tebral air alone was observed in 48 involved levels (39. 7 %), intravertebral fluid alone was found in 47 (38. 8 %), and both coexisted in 26 (21. 5 %). Degree of vertebral collapse in affected <b>vertebral</b> <b>bodies</b> significantly differed with presence of air or fluid (P. 05). Vertebral compression fractures adjacent to the affected <b>vertebral</b> <b>bodies</b> were more common in those with intravertebral air alone than in thos...|$|R
25|$|About {{three percent}} of cancer {{patients}} experience spinal cord compression, usually from expansion of the <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> or pedicle (fig. 1) due to metastasis, sometimes involving collapse of the <b>vertebral</b> <b>body.</b> Occasionally compression is caused by nonvertebral metastasis adjacent to the spinal cord. Compression of the long tracts of the cord itself produces funicular pain and compression of a spinal nerve root (fig. 5) produces radicular pain. Seventy percent of cases involve the thoracic, 20 percent the lumbar, and 10 percent the cervical spine; and about 20 percent of cases involve multiple sites of compression. The nature of the pain depends on {{the location of the}} compression.|$|E
25|$|The {{notochord}} disappears in the sclerotome (<b>vertebral</b> <b>body)</b> segments, but {{persists in}} the region of the intervertebral discs as the nucleus pulposus. The nucleus pulposus and the fibers of the anulus fibrosus make up the intervertebral disc.|$|E
25|$|Many scales {{have been}} {{developed}} to determine the degree of deformity in the chest wall. Most of these are variants on the distance between the sternum and the spine. One such index is the Backer ratio which grades severity of deformity based on the ratio between the diameter of the <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> nearest to xiphosternal junction and the distance between the xiphosternal junction and the nearest <b>vertebral</b> <b>body.</b> More recently the Haller index has been used based on CT scan measurements. An index over 3.25 is often defined as severe. The Haller index is the ratio between the horizontal distance of the inside of the ribcage and the shortest distance between the vertebrae and sternum.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{establish}} the frequency and features of uncomplicated compression fractures of <b>vertebral</b> <b>bodies</b> in children and to determine its place in the rank structure of children’s injuries.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Concern {{exists that}} <b>vertebral</b> <b>bodies</b> {{augmented}} with ce-ment placed laterally {{may be at}} risk of collapse on the nonaugmented side. The purpose of the current study was to determine if placing the cement laterally rather than centrally resulted in risk of collapse on the nonaugmented side. METHODS: <b>Vertebral</b> <b>bodies</b> (L 2 –L 5) were harvested from eight osteoporotic female cadaver spines. Simulated vertebral-body compression fractures were created and stabilized by injecting 3. 5 or 7. 0 mL of cement centrally or laterally. <b>Vertebral</b> <b>bodies</b> were recrushed to measure their augmented strength and stiffness. Anterior, posterior, left, and right lateral heights were measured initially, after augmentation, and after recompression. RESULTS: Lateral and central 3. 5 -mL injections of cement restored strength, whereas 7. 0 -mL injections significantly increased strength compared with initial values. The stiffness of <b>vertebral</b> <b>bodies</b> receiving central 3. 5 -mL injections was significantly less than it was initially, although the stiffness of bodies receiving 3. 5 -mL laterally was not significantly different from initial values.

25|$|The {{cervical}} vertebrae had well-developed cervical ribs, {{fused to}} the <b>vertebral</b> <b>body.</b> The ribs were elongated, with a forward-pointing process on the capitulum, the main rib head. The neural spines {{of the rear}} cervicals and front dorsals are transversely expanded at their upper ends due to rugosities serving as an attachment for tendons. This expanded sector projects to the front also, creating a notch on the lower front edge. Additionally the neural spine base is transversely constricted. Ridges extend to the rear {{from the sides of}} the neural spine base, over the upper sides of the rear joint processes, the postzygapophyses. These postzygapophyses themselves project far beyond the rear facet of the <b>vertebral</b> <b>body,</b> a derived trait. The prezygapophyses to the contrary, are much shorter; they have a notch at the front upper edge.|$|E
25|$|The general {{structure}} of human vertebrae is fairly typical of {{that found in}} mammals, reptiles, and birds. The shape of the <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> does, however, vary somewhat between different groups. In mammals, such as humans, it typically has flat upper and lower surfaces, while in reptiles the anterior surface commonly has a concave socket into which the expanded convex face of the next <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> fits. Even these patterns are only generalisations, however, {{and there may be}} variation in form of the vertebrae {{along the length of the}} spine even within a single species. Some unusual variations include the saddle-shaped sockets between the cervical vertebrae of birds and the presence of a narrow hollow canal running down the centre of the vertebral bodies of geckos and tuataras, containing a remnant of the notochord.|$|E
25|$|In most ray-finned fishes, {{including}} all teleosts, these two structures are fused with, and embedded within, a solid piece of bone superficially resembling the <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> of mammals. In living amphibians, {{there is simply}} a cylindrical piece of bone below the vertebral arch, with {{no trace of the}} separate elements present in the early tetrapods.|$|E

25|$|A typical {{vertebra}} {{consists of}} two parts: the <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> and the vertebral arch. The vertebral arch is posterior, meaning it faces {{the back of a}} person. Together, these enclose the vertebral foramen, which contains the spinal cord. Because the spinal cord ends in the lumbar spine, and the sacrum and coccyx are fused, they do not contain a central foramen. The vertebral arch is formed by a pair of pedicles and a pair of laminae, and supports seven processes, four articular, two transverse, and one spinous, the latter also being known as the neural spine. Two transverse processes and one spinous process are posterior to (behind) the <b>vertebral</b> <b>body.</b> The spinous process comes out the back, one transverse process comes out the left, and one on the right. The spinous processes of the cervical and lumbar regions can be felt through the skin.|$|E
25|$|Individual {{vertebrae}} of {{the human}} vertebral column can be felt and used as surface anatomy, with reference points are taken {{from the middle of}} the <b>vertebral</b> <b>body.</b> This provides anatomical landmarks that can be used to guide procedures such as a lumbar puncture and also as vertical reference points to describe the locations of other parts of human anatomy, such as the positions of organs.|$|E
25|$|The {{vertebrae}} of lobe-finned fishes {{consist of}} three discrete bony elements. The vertebral arch surrounds the spinal cord, and is of broadly similar form to {{that found in}} most other vertebrates. Just beneath the arch lies a small plate-like pleurocentrum, which protects the upper surface of the notochord, and below that, a larger arch-shaped intercentrum to protect the lower border. Both of these structures are embedded within a single cylindrical mass of cartilage. A similar arrangement {{was found in the}} primitive Labyrinthodonts, but in the evolutionary line that led to reptiles (and hence, also to mammals and birds), the intercentrum became partially or wholly replaced by an enlarged pleurocentrum, which in turn became the bony <b>vertebral</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Some of {{the terms}} {{commonly}} {{used to describe the}} condition include herniated disc, prolapsed disc, ruptured disc and slipped disc. Other phenomena that are closely related include disc protrusion, pinched nerves, sciatica, disc disease, disc degeneration, degenerative disc disease, and black disc. The popular term slipped disc is a misnomer, as the intervertebral discs are tightly sandwiched between two vertebrae to which they are attached, and cannot actually [...] "slip", or even get out of place. The disc is actually grown together with the adjacent vertebrae and can be squeezed, stretched and twisted, all in small degrees. It can also be torn, ripped, herniated, and degenerated, but it cannot [...] "slip". Some authors consider that the term [...] "slipped disc" [...] is harmful, as it leads to an incorrect idea of what has occurred and thus of the likely outcome. However, during growth, one <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> can slip relative to an adjacent <b>vertebral</b> <b>body,</b> a deformity called spondylolisthesis.|$|E
2500|$|Cervical disc herniations {{occur in}} the neck, most often between the fifth & sixth (C5/6) and the sixth and seventh (C6/7) {{cervical}} vertebral bodies. Symptoms [...] can affect {{the back of the}} skull, the neck, shoulder girdle, scapula, arm, and hand. The nerves of the cervical plexus and brachial plexus can be affected. Usually, a posterolateral disc hernia will affect the nerve root exiting {{at the level of the}} disk. Nerves roots are numbered according to the <b>vertebral</b> <b>body</b> below them (except the C8 nerve root). Thus, a C5/6 disc hernia will normally affect the C6 nerve root.|$|E

2500|$|As derived species {{no longer}} have {{transversal}} processes on their vertebrae—again a condition unique in the Amniota—the parapophyseal and diapophysael rib joints {{have been reduced to}} flat facets, at least one of which is located on the <b>vertebral</b> <b>body.</b> The number of facets can be one or two; their profile can be circular or oval. Their shape often differs according to the position of the vertebra within the column.

The ribs typically are very thin and possess a longitudinal groove on both the inner and the outer sides. The lower side of the chest is formed by gastralia.
