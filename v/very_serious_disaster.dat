At each halting place where French troops were stationed, the British prisoners were received with warm hospitality by them, when they learned from their comrades that the British had fought {{side by side with}} the French against the guerillas, and had saved them from what might have been a <b>very</b> <b>serious</b> <b>disaster.</b> The French shook hands with them warmly, patted them on the shoulders, with many exclamations of [...] "Braves garcons!" [...] and they were led away to cafes, and treated as the heroes of the day, while the officers were entertained by those of the garrison.|$|E
60|$|Reinforcements {{were still}} {{dribbling}} into the British force, Hoad's Australian Regiment, {{which had been}} changed from infantry to cavalry, and J battery R.H.A. from India, being the last arrivals. But very much stronger reinforcements had arrived for the Boers--so strong {{that they were able}} to take the offensive. De la Rey had left the Modder with three thousand men, and their presence infused new life into the defenders of Colesberg. At the moment, too, that the Modder Boers were coming to Colesberg, the British had begun to send cavalry reinforcements to the Modder in preparation for the march to Kimberley, so that Clements's Force (as it had now become) was depleted at the very instant when that of the enemy was largely increased. The result was that it was all they could do not merely to hold their own, but to avoid a <b>very</b> <b>serious</b> <b>disaster.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} <b>very</b> <b>serious</b> natural <b>disasters</b> have put an {{enormous}} pressure on relief {{organizations in the}} last few years. The present study exposes underlying social cognitive factors for donation to relief campaigns. A causal model was constructed, based on social cognitive theory, research on attitudes, and the impact of media exposure. The aim was to expand and improve an already existing model by Cheung and Chan [Cheung, C. K., & Chan, C. M. (2000). Social-cognitive factors of donating money to charity, with special attention to an international relief organisation. Evaluation and Program Planning, 23, 241 - 253]. The expanded model showed a better fit. Furthermore, the expanded model explained two-thirds of the variance of the intention to donate to a disaster relief campaign. The greatest predictor of the intention to donate proved to be "Past donation to disaster relief campaigns. " The factor "News exposure" was indicated to be a valuable additional factor, as it had a significant direct effect on "Awareness of a disaster relief campaign" and was the only factor that had a total effect on all other factors, including "Intention to donate to a disaster relief campaign.
