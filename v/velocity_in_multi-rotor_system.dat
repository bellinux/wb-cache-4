40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been {{significant}} effort put into the design and use small, autonomous, multi-agent, aerial teams {{for a variety of}} military and commercial applications. <b>In</b> particular, small <b>multi-rotor</b> <b>systems</b> {{have been shown to be}} especially useful for carrying sensors as they have the ability to rapidly transit between locations as well as hover in place. This dissertation seeks to use multi-agent teams of autonomous rotorcraft to sample spatiotemporal fields in windy conditions. For many sampling objectives, there is the problem of how to accomplish the sampling objective in the presence of strong wind fields caused by external means or by other rotorcraft flying in close proximity. This dissertation develops several flight control strategies for both wind compensation, using nonlinear control techniques, and wind avoidance, using artificial potential-based control. To showcase the utility of teams of unmanned rotorcraft for spatiotemporal sampling, optimal algorithms are developed for two sampling objectives: (1) sampling continuous spatiotemporal fields modeled as Gaussian processes, and (2) optimal motion planning for coordinated target detection, which is an example of a discrete spatiotemporal field. All algorithms are tested in simulation and several are tested in a motion capture based experimental testbed...|$|R

This study established a relationship between distance, altitude and sound pressure level, finding that the sound decays approximately in line with 6 dB(A) reduction for a doubling of distance. The effect of {{the orientation of the}} <b>multi-rotor</b> unmanned aircraft <b>system</b> was also investigated. It was determined that the sound profile does not vary significantly around the periphery of the <b>multi-rotor</b> unmanned aircraft <b>system</b> <b>in</b> the propeller-plane.

Finally, an acoustic array was used to measure key frequencies for the main sound sources: motors and propellers.

Despite relatively low levels of sound being measured (especially when compared with conventional aircraft and rotorcraft), the increasing numbers of unmanned aircraft systems in urban environments, close to humans and dwellings, suggests that increasing complaints are likely.

40|$|Abstract — We propose and {{experimentally}} validate a {{new class}} of models for the total thrust generation <b>in</b> <b>multi-rotor</b> UAVs which is suitable for low- and middle-end platforms. Differently from typical models assuming to instantaneously control the rotor spinning <b>velocity,</b> <b>in</b> the proposed class we consider that the total thrust has its own dynamics and its final value explicitly depends both on the pseudo-setpoint commands given to the motor driver and the measurement of the battery terminal voltage. We compare the different model instances within the class using a principled experimental setup in which the total thrust is precisely measured using a motion capture system as ground truth, instead of relying on a setup based or noise-prone force sensors. We then show that the use of a dynamical model that includes also the battery terminal voltage significantly improves the prediction ability of the model in terms of accuracy. Finally we show how the proposed model can be identified using on-board only acceleration measurements, achieving a surprisingly good accuracy when compared with the ground truth case. We expect that the use of the proposed model will be important both in case of precise flight control {{and in the case of}} aerial physical interactive tasks. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The dynamic {{behaviors}} of a flexible <b>multi-rotor</b> <b>system</b> with a fault of parallel misalignment are investigated {{on the basis}} of assumptions, such as the long journal bearings, small rotor misalignment and mass disk unbalance. Firstly, based on the Lagrange equations with undetermined multiplier, the dynamic model of a rotor system under the action of the nonlinear oil film forces is developed after taking into account the holonomic constraint, which describes the misalignment relation between two rotors, and the theoretical analysis reveals that the system with eleven DOF is of strong nonlinear properties. Then the nonlinear dynamic characteristics on numerical technique, such as steady state response, rotor orbit, Poincaré section and the largest Lyapunov exponent, are paid more attention in this study. The results show that at low speed the components of the steady-state responses in lateral direction is of the synchronous frequency with rotating speed as well as its integer multiples frequencies. As the speed increases the dynamic characteristics become complicated, and the nT-period, quasi-period and chaotic oscillations occur...|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} has been {{the development of an}} effective design tool for torsional analysis. In the hopes of achieving this goal the computer program, Torsion 1, has been created. This torsional transfer matrix program provides the user with the ability to easily model <b>multi-rotor</b> <b>systems</b> using a simple user-interface. The program is capable of modeling such components or system characteristics as continuously distributed mass, viscous and structural damping, vibration absorbers, and gear meshes with gear tooth flexibility.

The forced-response analysis module is capable of determining a system’s response to a static or harmonic torsional load. The free-vibration analysis module allows is capable of determining the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for damped and undamped systems. This thesis includes an explanation of the multi-rotor transfer matrix technique employed in Torsion 1. The derivation of transfer matrices for visco-elastic vibration absorbers, pendulum absorbers, flexible gear meshes, and planetary gear trains are included in this work.

40|$|A <b>multi-rotor</b> <b>system</b> (MRS), <b>in</b> which {{multiple}} {{wind turbines}} {{are placed on}} one tower, is a promising concept for super-large wind turbines at over 10 MW due to the cost and weight advantages. The coherence effects on an MRS were investigated in this study. Although {{a wide range of}} coherences were measured so far, a decay constant of C = 12 is recommended in the IEC 61400 - 1 standard. Dynamic simulations were performed for a 14 -MW MRS, which consists of seven 2 -MW turbines and includes wind models with three different coherences. Although the results show that a larger coherence increases the output power and the collective loads due to tower base fore-aft bending, it reduces the differential loads due to tower-base torque and tower-top nodding. The most significant case is the fatigue damage due to tower base fore-aft bending, which was more than doubled between the decay constants of C = 6 and C = 12. The present results indicate that the coherence should be defined carefully in the design of large-scale MRSs because its effect on them is not straightforward...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper proposes {{application}} of {{wireless power transfer}} for charging of electric-powered Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAV) s. <b>Multi-rotor</b> <b>systems,</b> such as quadrotors, are light-weight and easy to operate. They are available in different sizes and with {{the wide range of}} capabilities. The main limitation of electric-powered UAVs is their range and endurance, due the limited battery capacity. Increasing battery system size is not a viable solution as its weight becomes a limiting factor. Supercapacitors are not an option, because of their low energy density. An alternative is to recharge UAV on the job, using wireless energy transfer (WET). WET was originally investigated by Nikola Tesla {{in the beginning of the}} 20 th century. His patents are now common ground for any power transmission technology research, both wired and wireless. Investigations in resonance-based wireless energy transfer promise efficient wireless power transmission over several meters.

For example, this technology can be applied to extend the range of UAVs used for the inspection of power transmission lines and towers.

50|$|Two or more rotors may {{be mounted}} {{to the same}} driveshaft, with their {{combined}} co-rotation together turning the same generator: fresh wind is brought to each rotor by sufficient spacing between rotors combined with an offset angle (alpha) from the wind direction. Wake vorticity is recovered as {{the top of a}} wake hits the bottom of the next rotor. Power has been multiplied several times using co-axial, multiple rotors in testing conducted by inventor and researcher Douglas Selsam, for the California Energy Commission in 2004. The first commercially available co-axial multi-rotor turbine is the patented dual-rotor American Twin Superturbine from Selsam Innovations in California, with 2 propellers separated by 12 feet. It is the most powerful 7 ft turbine available, due to this extra rotor. In 2015, Iowa State University aerospace engineers Hui Hu and Anupam Sharma were optimizing designs of <b>multi-rotor</b> <b>systems,</b> including a horizontal-axis co-axial dual-rotor model. In addition to a conventional three-blade rotor, it has a smaller secondary three-blade rotor, covering the near-axis region usually inefficiently harvested.

Preliminary results indicated 10-20% gains, less efficient than is claimed by existing counter-rotating designs but those are complex.|$|R

In order to satisfy this feature, the principal structure is made of an universal plate, combined with a circular ring, to create a rail guide able to host the arms, in a variable number from 3 to 8, and the legs. The arms are adjustable and contain all the avionic and motor drivers to connect the main structure with each electric motor. The unique arm design, defined as all-in-one, allows classical single rotor configurations, double rotor configurations and amphibious configurations including inflatable elements positioned {{at the bottom of}} the arms. The proposed <b>multi-rotor</b> <b>system</b> is inexpensive because of the few universal pieces needed to compose the platform which allows the creation of a kit.

Another innovation feature is the introduction of the 3 D printing technology to produce all the structural elements. In this manner, all the pieces are designed to be produced via the Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) technology using desktop 3 D printers.

Group A consisted of 42  patients with Graves' disease without ophthalmopathy; group B of 69  patients with Graves' disease with ophthalmopathy as detected by orbital computed tomographic scanning.  RESULTS—Peak systolic and end diastolic <b>velocities</b> <b>in</b> the ophthalmic artery, peak systolic <b>velocity</b> <b>in</b> the central retinal artery, and maximal and minimal <b>velocities</b> <b>in</b> the central retinal vein in patients in group B were statistically significantly higher than those in group A and the normal controls, whereas maximal and minimal <b>velocities</b> <b>in</b> the superior ophthalmic vein in patients in group B were statistically significantly lower than those in group A and the control subjects.
