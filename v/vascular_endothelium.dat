25|$|Once a micro-bubble forms it may {{continue}} to grow if the tissues are still supersaturated. As the bubble grows it may distort the surrounding tissue and cause damage to cells and pressure on nerves resulting in pain, or may block a blood vessel, cutting off blood flow and causing hypoxia in the tissues normally perfused by the vessel.

25|$|In the <b>vascular</b> <b>endothelium,</b> NO is {{synthesized}} by eNOS from L-arginine {{and molecular}} oxygen, which binds to the heme group of eNOS, is reduced and finally incorporated into L- arginine to form NO and L-citrulline.

In this conformation, instead of synthesizing NO, eNOS produces superoxide anion, a highly reactive free radical with deleterious consequences to the cardiovascular system.|$|E

50|$|In {{a healthy}} <b>vascular</b> system the <b>endothelium</b> lines all blood-contacting surfaces, {{including}} arterioles, arteries, veins, capillaries, and heart chambers. This healthy condition is {{promoted by the}} ample production of nitric oxide by the endothelium, which requires a biochemical reaction regulated by a complex balance of polyphenols, various nitric oxide synthase enzymes and L-arginine. In addition there is direct electrical and chemical communication via gap junctions between the endothelial cells and the vascular smooth muscle.|$|R
25|$|The {{intestine}} becomes distended due to {{the trapped}} fluid and gas production from bacteria. It is this distension, and subsequent activation of stretch receptors within the intestinal wall, {{that leads to the}} associated pain. With progressive distension of the intestinal wall, there is occlusion of blood vessels, firstly the less rigid veins, then arteries. This impairment of blood supply leads to hyperemia and congestion, and ultimately to ischaemic necrosis and cellular death. The poor blood supply also has effects on the <b>vascular</b> <b>endothelium,</b> leading to an increased permeability which first leaks plasma and eventually blood into the intestinal lumen. In the opposite fashion, gram-negative bacteria and endotoxins can enter the bloodstream, leading to further systemic effects.|$|E
25|$|VAR2CSA {{is unique}} {{in that it is}} mostly {{produced}} by the placenta during pregnancy (the condition called pregnancy-associated malaria, PAM, or placental malaria). The majority of PAM is therefore due to VAR2SCA. Unlike other PfEMP1, VAR2CSA binds to chondroitin sulphate A present on the <b>vascular</b> <b>endothelium</b> of placenta. Although its individual domains can bind to CSA, its entire structure is used for complete binding. The major complication in PAM is low-birth-weight babies. However, women who survived the first infection generally develop an effective immune response. In P. falciparum-prevalent regions in Africa, pregnant women are found to contain high levels of antibody (immunoglobulin G, or IgG) against VAR2CSA, which protect them the placenta-attacking malarial parasite. They are noted for giving birth to heavier babies.|$|E
25|$|Proteins {{constitute}} 90-95% of venom's {{dry weight}} {{and they are}} responsible for almost all of its biological effects. Among hundreds, even thousands of proteins found in venom, there are toxins, neurotoxins in particular, as well as nontoxic proteins (which also have pharmacological properties), and many enzymes, especially hydrolytic ones. Enzymes (molecular weight 13-150 KDa) make-up 80-90% of viperid and 25-70% of elapid venoms: digestive hydrolases, L-amino acid oxidase, phospholipases, thrombin-like pro-coagulant, and kallikrein-like serine proteases and metalloproteinases (hemorrhagins), which damage <b>vascular</b> <b>endothelium.</b> Polypeptide toxins (molecular weight 5-10 KDa) include cytotoxins, cardiotoxins, and postsynaptic neurotoxins (such as α-bungarotoxin and α-Cobratoxin), which bind to acetylcholine receptors at neuromuscular junctions. Compounds with low molecular weight (up to 1.5 KDa) include metals, peptides, lipids, nucleosides, carbohydrates, amines, and oligopeptides, which inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and potentiate bradykinin (BPP). Inter- and intra-species variation in venom chemical composition is geographical and ontogenic. Phosphodiesterases interfere with the prey's cardiac system, mainly to lower the blood pressure. Phospholipase A2 causes hemolysis by lysing the phospholipid cell membranes of red blood cells. Amino acid oxidases and proteases are used for digestion. Amino acid oxidase also triggers some other enzymes and is responsible for the yellow colour of the venom of some species. Hyaluronidase increases tissue permeability to accelerate absorption of other enzymes into tissues. Some snake venoms carry fasciculins, like the mambas (Dendroaspis), which inhibit cholinesterase to make the prey lose muscle control.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{the last}} decade, much data has been {{generated}} concerning the molecular mechanisms of lymphangiogenesis and its significance in pathological conditions. This was mainly {{due to the}} discovery of lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) -specific markers, such as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor- 3 (VEGFR- 3), LYVE- 1, Prox- 1 and podoplanin. Podoplanin, originally detected on the surface of podocytes, belongs to the family of type- 1 transmembrane sialomucin-like glycoproteins. Although specific for lymphatic <b>vascular</b> (LV) <b>endothelium,</b> podoplanin is expressed {{in a wide variety of}} normal and tumor cells.

40|$|In mammals, the lymphatic {{vascular}} system develops by budding of lymphatic progenitor endothelial cells from embryonic veins {{to form a}} distinct network of draining vessels with important functions in the immune response and in cancer metastasis. However, the lineage-specific molecular characteristics of blood <b>vascular</b> versus lymphatic <b>endothelium</b> have remained poorly defined. We isolated lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) and blood vascular endothelial cells (BVECs) by immunomagnetic isolation directly from human skin. Cultured LECs but not BVECs expressed the lymphatic markers Prox 1 and LYVE- 1 and formed LYVE- 1 -positive vascular tubes after implantation in vivo. Transcriptional profiling studies revealed increased expression of several extracellular matrix and adhesion molecules in BVECs, including versican, collagens, laminin, and N-cadherin, and of the growth factor receptors endoglin and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor- 1 /Flt- 1. Differential immunostains of human skin confirmed the blood vessel-specific expression of these genes. During embryonic development, endoglin expression was gradually down-regulated on lymphatic <b>endothelium</b> whereas <b>vascular</b> endothelial growth factor receptor- 1 was absent from lymphatics. We also identified several genes with specific expression in LECs. These results demonstrate that some lineage-specific genes are only expressed during distinct developmental stages and they identify new molecular markers for blood <b>vascular</b> and lymphatic <b>endothelium</b> with important implications for future studies of vascular development and function...|$|R
500|$|The {{precursors}} {{of these}} factors require gamma carboxylation of their glutamic acid residues to allow the coagulation factors to bind to phospholipid surfaces inside blood vessels, on the <b>vascular</b> <b>endothelium.</b> The enzyme that carries out the carboxylation of glutamic acid is gamma-glutamyl carboxylase. The carboxylation reaction will proceed only if the carboxylase enzyme is able to convert a reduced form of vitamin K (vitamin K hydroquinone) to vitamin K epoxide at the same time. The vitamin K epoxide is in turn recycled back to vitamin K and vitamin K hydroquinone by another enzyme, the vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR). Warfarin inhibits epoxide reductase (specifically the VKORC1 subunit), thereby diminishing available vitamin K and vitamin K hydroquinone in the tissues, which inhibits the carboxylation activity of the glutamyl carboxylase. When this occurs, the coagulation factors are no longer carboxylated at certain glutamic acid residues, and are incapable of binding to the endothelial surface of blood vessels, and are thus biologically inactive. As the body's stores of previously produced active factors degrade (over several days) and are replaced by inactive factors, the anticoagulation effect becomes apparent. The coagulation factors are produced, but have decreased functionality due to undercarboxylation; they are collectively referred to as PIVKAs (proteins induced [...] vitamin K absence/antagonism), and individual coagulation factors as PIVKA-number (e.g.PIVKA-II). The end result of warfarin use, therefore, is to diminish blood clotting in the patient.|$|E
