500|$|The book {{notes the}} artist's {{reluctance}} {{to be interviewed}} or engage with the public, and quotes him as saying: [...] "It's <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to relate to people asking questions that are not only boring but don't {{have anything to do}} with my life ... It's a waste of time on my part because it drains me from doing what I really want to do, which is just to play music." [...] Van Morrison describes his perceived musical role: [...] "I just feel I'm doing the job. My job is to play music and deliver the show ... It's more emotional for the audience ... what they sort of think you are." [...] He states that one of his motivations is [...] "ideally to induce states of meditation and ecstasy, as well as to make people think".|$|E
500|$|... "Possibly Maybe" [...] is {{a fusion}} of trip hop and chill-out music, which the San Francisco Chronicle review called [...] "a fragmented, poetic {{rumination}} on love's ups and downs". It has also been considered ambient dub. Björk {{has said that it}} was the first unhappy song she wrote, stating in 1997: [...] "That was <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> [...] I was ashamed writing a song that was not giving hope". The slide guitar heard in the background of the song was originally intended to be its focal point, as Björk initially strived for an [...] "ambient country" [...] sound inspired by Chris Isaak's [...] "Wicked Game". The lyrics of [...] "Possibly Maybe" [...] document the various stages of the singer's ill-fated relationship with Stéphane Sednaoui. [...] "I Miss You" [...] was described in 1997 as an [...] "amalgam of styles, with electronic drums melding into African bongos mixed with jazzy horn playing". A house music number, its [...] "horn-infused Afro-Cuban strains [...] reflect the romantic whimsy of [...] lyrics". Björk wrote [...] "Cover Me", one of the quieter moments on the album, to her co-producer Nellee Hooper after he {{agreed to participate in the}} making of Post. She has said: [...] "I guess I was trying to make fun of myself, how dangerous I manage sometimes to make album making. And trying to lure him into it. But it is also a admiration thing from me to him". The album ends with the experimental [...] "Headphones", an ambient track. Featuring [...] "just-for-headphones studio tricks", it has been described as [...] "a chiming, somnolent dip into Björk's heavy-lidded pre-dream state". Its lyrics were written as a thank you to Graham Massey, who would make compilation cassettes for Björk. The singer also stated: [...] "But, of course, it is also a love letter to sound. The sound of sound. Resonances, frequencies, silences and such... a music-worship thing".|$|E
2500|$|Zimmer also {{composed}} {{the music for}} Christopher Nolan's 2014 film Interstellar, which earned him another Academy Award nomination for Best Original Score. He partnered with Junkie XL to compose the music for the 2016 film [...] In an interview with BBC News in March 2016, Zimmer {{said that he was}} retiring from composing the music for superhero films, saying of Batman v Superman [...] "This one was <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to do, to try to find new language".|$|E
6000|$|... "Monsieur le Vicomte," [...] she said, [...] "I do {{not know}} you very well, and it is <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> indeed <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to tell who are my friends here. Can I trust you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{remember}} being very angry," [...] said Miss Baker, [...] "because papa prophesied that I {{should be an}} old maid. It was <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> on <b>me,</b> <b>for</b> his prophecy no doubt brought about the fact." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'A less {{self-conscious}} {{person could}} do what I can hardly do without danger. I see my name in a book or paper, and then comes at once a struggle against some craving after praise. I think I know the fault, but I don't say I struggle against it as I ought to do. It is <b>very</b> <b>hard,</b> therefore, <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to write naturally about work in which I am myself engaged. But I feel that a truthful account of what we see and hear ought to be given, and yet I never speak about the Mission without feeling that I have somehow conveyed a false impression.' ...|$|R
2500|$|In her {{reaction}} Mrs. Weber states: [...] "It's a pity that, for various reasons, his initiative was presented and {{perceived as a}} matter of personal image or even worse"" [...] and [...] "It's <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to understand how in Romania, after more than ten years we have adopted a pervasive nondiscriminatory legislation, there are still politicians who react so violently against people who have a different sexual orientation.". Moreover, Mrs. Weber instructed her colleague that homosexual people are not sick: ...|$|E
2500|$|Biographer Randall Woods {{argues that}} Social Gospel themes Johnson learned from {{childhood}} {{allowed him to}} transform social problems into moral problems. This helps explain his longtime commitment to social justice, as exemplified by the Great Society and his commitment to racial equality. The Social Gospel explicitly inspired his foreign-policy approach {{to a sort of}} Christian internationalism and nation building. For example, in a 1966 speech he quoted at length from the Social Creed of the Methodist Church issued in 1940, adding [...] "It would be <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to write a more perfect description of the American ideal." ...|$|E
2500|$|Buttigieg {{began the}} 1989–90 season in an {{unfamiliar}} right back role and gradually {{fell out of the}} first team picture. The departure of Perryman as manager and his replacement Phil Holder's tactical change to a long ball game saw Buttigieg further frozen out and after being transfer-listed in November 1990, he was released in May 1991. Buttigieg made 47 appearances during his time at Griffin Park and the 22 caps he won for Malta during that period make him Brentford's most capped international. In 2001, Buttigieg remarked that he [...] "felt an outsider at the club for a while. Joyce Neate at the club was lovely to me and some of the players too, but it was <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> I remember".|$|E
500|$|Peggy {{was written}} out of EastEnders in 2003, sent {{to live in}} Rio de Janeiro with her son Grant for two years, while Windsor took a sabbatical from the show after being {{diagnosed}} with the Epstein-Barr virus. Windsor had previously never taken {{more than two weeks}} leave annually during her eight years on the show, as Peggy was considered such a central character to the series. Windsor's absence was originally only supposed to be a year long. She stated at the time: [...] "This has been a <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> decision <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to make because I'm so happy here on EastEnders but it's been a long time without a proper break. I just feel some time off would be good <b>for</b> <b>me</b> and <b>for</b> the character too." [...] Louise Berridge, then EastEnders executive producer, commented: [...] "Barbara has been an absolute trouper for more than eight years on this show. We hope she has a great time and look forward to bringing her back with a big story in 2004." ...|$|R
2500|$|It was a <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> thing <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to {{do because}} I liked him but I really felt {{what he did was}} awful and that unless I felt myself if I didn’t say something, I’d be a hypocrite. I also felt that if {{somebody}} who was supportive of him didn’t say something, it would not be good. And so it got a lot of attention. I got a call from Erskine Bowles who was Chief of Staff about three or four days later saying {{that he was going to}} express an opinion which wasn’t universally held at the White House– he thought I helped the president by bursting the boil, that was the metaphor he used. The following Sunday morning, I'm at home and the phone rings, it’s the White House. And it’s now about a week and a couple of days since I made the speech. The president says, it was the president, [...] "I just want you to know that there’s nothing you said in that speech that I don’t agree with. And I want you to know that I’m working on it." [...] And we talked for about forty-five minutes. It was amazing.|$|R

60|$|He treated us handsomely indeed, {{and paid}} the money cheerfully enough; so that it cost him #200 in all, or rather more. At our last meeting, when all was agreed, {{the case of the}} {{journeyman}} came up, and the mercer begged <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> him; told <b>me</b> he was a man that had kept a shop of his own, and been in good business, had a wife, and several children, and was very poor; that he had nothing to make satisfaction with, but he should come to beg my pardon on his knees, if I desired it, as openly as I pleased. I had no spleen at the saucy rogue, nor were his submissions anything to me, since {{there was nothing to be}} got by him, so I thought it was as good to throw that in generously as not; so I told him I did not desire the ruin of any man, and therefore at his request I would forgive the wretch; it was below me to seek any revenge.|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{those steps}} will be I cannot say, but I feel {{sure that they}} will in some way prevent my coming back for a long time. They can't keep me themselves, but may hand me over as a {{prisoner}} to the French authorities. Before we sailed the man {{told me he had}} learnt that a warrant was out against <b>me</b> <b>for</b> the murder of Faulkner, and that Faulkner had declared it was I who shot him. If I could possibly have escaped I would have come back to stand my trial, though I can see plainly enough that it might go <b>very</b> <b>hard</b> with <b>me,</b> <b>for</b> there would be only my word, which would go for nothing against Faulkner's accusation, and the fact of our quarrel. However, I would have come rather than disappear with this awful charge against me. The man has given me permission, not only to write and tell you this story, but even to give you his name, which is Joseph Markham. He had only been a short time out of prison, where he had been sent for poaching, and he killed Faulkner simply for revenge. He told me that he did not mind my getting his name as, in the first place, he had no idea of returning to Weymouth, and intended making France his home; and, in the second place, because, although you might believe my story, no one else would, and even if he showed himself in Weymouth, this letter, written by a man accused of the murder, would not be accepted for a moment against him. However, {{there is no doubt that}} the fellow has behaved extremely well to me, and I should be sorry to get him into trouble over this business with Faulkner, which is no affair of mine.|$|R
