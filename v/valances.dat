25|$|The A4 {{class was}} built with {{streamlined}} <b>valances,</b> or side skirting, {{but this was}} removed during the war to ease maintenance. Mallard lost its <b>valances</b> during a works visit 13 June 1942, regaining them in preservation in 1963.|$|E
25|$|The side <b>valances</b> of the {{locomotives}} in streamlined form were {{prone to}} {{damage in the}} event of collision with trackside objects. During 1950, the <b>valances</b> were shortened to end at the buffer beam rather than extending {{to the base of the}} cowcatcher.|$|E
25|$|The {{biggest change}} to the room was in the window treatments. Jacqueline Kennedy {{specifically}} asked for new curtains for the East Room consisting of opaque silk undercurtains and yellow drapes. Boudin oversaw the design of new draperies, with silk provided by Maison Jansen. A draft design of the drapes and <b>valances</b> was not ready until mid-1963. Boudin, apparently wishing {{to draw attention to}} the center window between the fireplaces, designed a valance for the center window while putting all other drapes behind window boxes. For the drapes, Boudin suggested a braid border and tie-backs made of ball fringe covered in satin. Kennedy disapproved of Boudin's proposal for the valance and window boxes, as it did not make use of the historic 1902 gilt window cornices. She did, however, approve of the fabric and tie-backs. Made of a custom-manufactured gold and cream silk lampas, the fabric contained a non-repetitive design of birds, butterflies, cupids, flowers, medallions, roosters, and wheat and featured heavy fringe at the bottom. The drapes were hung in straight panels from the carved and gilded 1902 wooden cornices. The design of the <b>valances</b> was not finalized until April 1964. First Lady Lady Bird Johnson asked Jacqueline Kennedy to assist her in finalizing the design. Originally, they were to be of brocatelle, a jacquard weave fabric similar to brocade but thicker and heavier and with designs in high relief. But this design was countermanded by Boudin. Instead, gold lampas, trimmed with braid and hemmed with gilt, spun-metal twisted fringe at the bottom, was installed in flat panels from behind each cornice. The curtains and <b>valances</b> took nearly three years to design and manufacture, and were not hung in the room until the Johnson administration in 1965. The drapes and <b>valances</b> cost $26,149. The cost was covered by sales of Jacqueline Kennedy's guidebook to the White House, which by 1965 was in its fourth edition.|$|E

25|$|The crown-shaped {{canopy hood}} which {{originally}} held {{the canopy of}} the Lincoln bed was recreated, and the lace and silk and wool velvet bed drapes were accurately recreated, including hand-made fringe and tassels based upon 19th-century photographs. New gilded window <b>valances</b> in the Rococo Revival style, perhaps intended to echo the bed canopy crown were created in place of those shown in engravings, drawings and a painting made during Lincoln's presidency.|$|E
25|$|The building's {{heavy and}} ornate {{exterior}} {{is a direct}} contrast to its spacious, open interior. The main entrance opens onto a hall {{which leads to the}} auditorium at the rear. The approximately 200 original cast-iron seats are arranged on four descending, curving levels, with leatherette upholstery. On either side is a balcony with circular box, supported by wooden columns with brackets and ball drops, and two tall, round-arched stained glass windows. The proscenium has vestiges of the original <b>valances.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{building}} has a skillion roof clad with later metal sheeting, supported by early steel girders (both uprights and trusses) and {{is lined with}} sheets of ripple iron. The original gambrel roof has been removed and the present roof follows {{the slope of the}} former upper seating tier, which has been removed. Along the ringside front of the roof are six mock dormers and a central pediment with the lettering: RNA EXHIBITION GROUNDS. Beneath this, at fascia level, is the lettering: ERNEST BAYNES STAND. Timber batten <b>valances</b> along the front and side of the roof are not original.|$|E
25|$|Openings in {{the station}} {{building}} are fitted with timber framed doors and double hung windows. The ticket windows between the booking lobby and the office are of double hung casements with decorative steel grilles. A crafted timber World War I Roll of Honour commemorating Kuranda School Past Pupils is located between the ticket windows. Entrances into the booking lobby, waiting shed and passage are ornamented with timber <b>valances</b> which form arches. Internal finishes {{in the station}} building are generally painted concrete walls, concrete floors and timber boarded ceilings. The building is enhanced by potted palms, ferns and hanging baskets of tropical rainforest plants.|$|E
25|$|This is the {{earliest}} {{of the surviving}} ringside stands, located on the northwest side of the Main Arena. It is a substantial brick structure with a gambrel roof. In {{the centre of the}} roof is a large fleche with cupola and four-faced clock which can be seen from much of the showgrounds. The roof of the stand, which has been re-clad with a recent corrugated metal sheeting, is supported on early light steel trusses and round cast metal columns with cast-iron brackets and <b>valances</b> along the front and sides. Between the arc of the central bay is a large sign with the lettering: JOHN MACDONALD STAND. The sides and front of the stand have a decorative cast-iron balustrading.|$|E
50|$|Olympia <b>Valance</b> {{was born}} in Melbourne, Victoria on 7 January 1993 to Rajko Vukadinović, a model and musician, and Tania Gogos-Wilson. <b>Valance's</b> father is Serbian and her mother is Greek Australian. She is the step-daughter of Australian Rock Legend Ross Wilson, who married her mother. <b>Valance</b> is the third eldest of eight half-siblings; she grew up living with younger {{half-brother}} Dimitri and a younger half-sister Athina Wilson, who is an accomplished singer.

Her half-sister Holly <b>Valance</b> previously appeared in the show as Felicity Scully from 1999 until 2002. <b>Valance</b> was initially contracted for three years.

25|$|In 1981, the Reagan {{administration}} {{undertook a}} private fund-raising campaign to extensively renovate the White House. Hoping to raise $200,000, the project raised $822,641, and Nancy Reagan oversaw a $730,000 project which largely renovated the private living quarters and restored hundreds of antique furniture items throughout the Executive Mansion. The floors, paneling, and plasterwork {{in the room}} all were assessed and underwent conservation to ensure their longevity. Mrs. Reagan made only minor improvements to the East Room, however. These included repainting the room (it retained its warm cream color), and adding gold silk swag <b>valances</b> over the draperies. Over-draperies, ordered in the Carter administration, were also replaced in the East Room during the Reagan administration, {{at a cost of}} $130,000.|$|E
500|$|Although the {{majority}} of surviving English embroidery from the medieval period was intended for church use, this demand decreased radically with the Protestant Reformation. [...] In contrast, {{the bulk of the}} surviving embroidery of the Tudor, Elizabethan, and Jacobean eras is for domestic use, whether for clothing or household decoration. The stable society that existed between the accession of Elizabeth in 1558 and the English Civil War encouraged the building and furnishing of new houses, in which rich textiles played a part. Some embroidery was imported in this period, including the canvas work bed <b>valances</b> once thought to be English but now attributed to France, but {{the majority}} of work was made in England—and increasingly, by skilled amateurs, mostly women, working domestically, to designs by professional men and women, and later to published pattern books.|$|E
500|$|Records also {{indicate}} that Scottish palaces were adorned by rich tapestries, like those that depicted scenes from the Iliad and Odyssey set up for James IV at Holyrood. Some of this was undertaken by exclusive professional embroiders, but needlework was part of female education {{at all levels of}} society. Some of these tapestries were produced by noble ladies, such as [...] the bed <b>valances</b> made by Katherine Ruthven for her marriage in 1551 to Campbell of Glenorchy. These are the oldest surviving examples of Scottish produced embroidery. They display the couple's initials, arms and the story of Adam and Eve. A carpet designed to cover a table may be connected to the marriage of Katherine Oliphant, which has her initials, arms, biblical verses and (perhaps as a pun on her name) an elephant. Much of the needle work of the sixteenth century has been attributed, probably erroneously, to Mary, Queen of Scots. It is thought that she did contribute to the Oxburgh Hangings while imprisoned in England.|$|E

2500|$|Minor {{refurbishment}} {{was made}} to the East Room in September 2003 during the administration of George W. Bush. The Committee for the Preservation of the White House had become dissatisifed with the golden silk swag <b>valances</b> installed during the Reagan presidency. The Kennedy-era Empire-style gold draperies were replaced with nearly identical ones, but the swags were made [...] deeper to make them appear more substantial. The room was repainted in the same warm cream color it had for the last century. The refurbishment cost $200,000, and was paid for by private donations to the White House Endowment Fund.|$|E
2500|$|The {{textiles}} {{found in}} the Library Cave include silk banners, altar hangings, wrappings for manuscripts, and monks' apparel (kāṣāya). The monks normally used fabrics consisting of a patchwork of different scraps of cloth {{as a sign of}} humility; these therefore provide valuable insights into the various type of silk cloth and embroidery available at the time. [...] Silk banners were used to adorn the cliff-face at the caves during festivals, and these are painted and may be embroidered. [...] <b>Valances</b> used to decorate altars and temples had a horizontal strip at the top, from which hung streamers made from strips of different cloths ending in a V that look like a modern male necktie.|$|E
2500|$|Power-assisted front {{disc brakes}} were now {{standard}} across the Falcon range. The GT {{variant of the}} XB also included four-wheel disc brakes (the earlier GT/GT-HO models used large finned drums at the rear). The first 211 XB GTs built were fitted with a US-built version of the Cleveland [...] V8 known as the 'big port' engine, and later XB GTs were fitted with an Australian-built version of the engine with 'small port' heads. A notable difference in performance is seen between these engines, and also in resale value, as the early US-powered GTs are rarer, so more collectable. The twin driving lights remained, as did the bonnet locks. The bonnet scoops of the GT were now integrated into the [...] "power bulge" [...] on the bonnet, the bumpers were now body-coloured, and the power bulge, wheel arches, sills, and <b>valances</b> were painted in a contrasting colour to the body colour (usually black, but dependent upon the actual body colour choice).|$|E

60|$|And {{you must}} not imagine this dustless, spotless, sweet {{apartment}} as anything but beautiful. Its appearance is a little unfamiliar of course, but all the muddle of dust-collecting hangings and witless ornament that cover the earthly bedroom, the <b>valances,</b> the curtains to check the draught from the ill-fitting wood windows, the worthless irrelevant pictures, usually a little askew, the dusty carpets, and all the paraphernalia about the dirty, black-leaded fireplace are gone. But the faintly tinted walls are framed with just one clear coloured line, as finely placed as the member of a Greek capital; the door handles and {{the lines of the}} panels of the door, the two chairs, the framework of the bed, the writing table, have all that final simplicity, that exquisite finish of contour that is begotten of sustained artistic effort. The graciously shaped windows each frame a picture--since they are draughtless the window seats are no mere mockeries as are the window seats of earth--and on the sill, the sole thing to need attention in the room, is one little bowl of blue Alpine flowers.|$|E
60|$|I {{must confess}} some impalpable quality of that ancient room {{disturbed}} me. I tried {{to fight the}} feeling down. I resolved to make a systematic examination of the place, and so, by leaving nothing to the imagination, dispel the fanciful suggestions of the obscurity before they obtained a hold upon me. After satisfying myself of the fastening of the door, I began to walk round the room, peering round each article of furniture, tucking up the <b>valances</b> {{of the bed and}} opening its curtains wide. In one place there was a distinct echo to my footsteps, the noises I made seemed so little that they enhanced rather than broke the silence of the place. I pulled up the blinds and examined the fastenings of the several windows. Attracted by the fall of a particle of dust, I leaned forward and looked up the blackness of the wide chimney. Then, trying to preserve my scientific attitude of mind, I walked round and began tapping the oak paneling for any secret opening, but I desisted before reaching the alcove. I saw my face in a mirror--white.|$|E
