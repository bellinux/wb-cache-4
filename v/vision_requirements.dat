40|$|Background: Normal {{vision is}} a {{universal}} requirement for safe riding of motorcycles. This study aims to determine the prevalence of visual impairment among commercial motorcyclists in Benin City, Nigeria. Method: This is a prospective cross sectional study carried out in Oredo Local Government Area (LGA) of Benin City. Each motorcycle park was taken as a cluster, and all motorcyclists in that park had structured questionnaires administered to them. One hundred and forty three commercial male motorcyclists in eleven motorcycle parks in Oredo LGA were subsequently examined with Snellen′s chart or illiterate E chart as applicable. The main outcome measures eligibility for driver′s licence on account of vision test {{as required by the}} Federal Road Safety Corps of Nigeria. Results: Ninety eight point six percent (98. 6 %) of those examined had acceptable driving <b>vision</b> <b>requirement</b> according to Federal Road Safety Corps.

40|$|A {{considerable}} {{proportion of}} subjects with visual field defects passed the driving test, {{before or after}} training. The level of compensatory viewing efficiency {{was significantly related to}} the likelihood to pass the on-road driving. Taking compensatory viewing efficiency (AFOV) into account improved the predictive power of a model based on the current <b>vision</b> <b>requirements</b> for driving. Yet,sensitivity and specificity remained low, limiting the use of these tests to distinguish between safe and unsafe drivers. A large percentage of drivers with visual field defects would be incorrectly restricted from driving {{on the basis of these}} tests. We therefore argue that for drivers with visual acuities as low as 0. 1 or visual fields as small as 30 degrees a negative outcome on the vision tests should be followed by an on-road driving test. ...|$|E

If the pilot applicant is unable to pass any of the office based tests, a real world operational test is available. This test consists of a ground based chart reading and control tower signal light test for Third Class medical certification (This is called the Operational Color Vision Test or OCVT), {{and in addition to}} that, a specialized [...] "Medical Flight Test" [...] (MFT) is required for Second and First Class medical certification. The applicant performs an actual flight test with an FAA Aviation Safety Inspector (ASI) for the purpose of further demonstrating [...] "the ability to perceive those colors necessary for the safe performance of airman duties", which is the color <b>vision</b> <b>requirement</b> as written in the FARs. Note that [...] "Normal Color Vision" [...] is not required, as a certain amount of color vision deficiency is considered safe and permitted. If the tests are passed, a [...] "Letter of Evidence" [...] (LOE) from the FAA is issued, which serves as evidence that the pilot meets the standards for Color Vision and the AME is permitted to issue the class of Medical Certificate indicated on the LOE (All classes if both the OCVT and MFT are passed) with no related restriction if all other medical requirements are met. This allows the pilot to receive a medical certificate with no restrictions related to color <b>vision</b> without the <b>requirement</b> of passing an office based color vision test at every subsequent renewal.|$|R

30|$|Looking at medical {{requirements}} worldwide for driver licensing reveals that {{in countries with}} compulsory requirements, the limits for visual acuity and visual field are quite similar, whereas the variation is greater for monocular <b>vision,</b> diplopia, and <b>requirements</b> for driver’s license renewal [10]. In most European countries, <b>vision</b> testing <b>requirements</b> are introduced sometime between 45 and 70  years of age and recur at an interval of 1 – 5  years. Hearing and cognitive tests are less common or non-existing. For instance, Denmark recommends the so-called Clock drawing test, {{which can be used}} to screen for dementia and cognitive impairment, to determine fitness to drive for drivers aged 70 and older [10], and to our knowledge there is no country performing or recommending hearing tests. Sweden is one of six EU countries with no requirement for medical testing at driver’s license renewal, the others being Austria, France, Great Britain, Hungary, and Germany [11]. In neighbouring countries Norway and Denmark, a medical testing certificate is required from 75  years of age, and in Finland an optical record is compulsory from 45  years of age.|$|R

Although a number of agent applications has been successfully realised and used, it must be stated that the distribution of commercial off-the-shelf applications is very scarce. For this discontenting situation, at least two reasons can be identified. On the one hand, the development of agent based applications is difficult suffering from insufficient standards and tools {{and on the other}} hand deployment issues are little researched and supported. In this paper, several deployment related topics are discussed and a vision for the deployment of distributed multi-agent systems is conceived. From the <b>vision,</b> <b>requirements</b> for launching and configuring agent applications are derived. According to these requirements, a platform independent reference model of the proposed deployment infrastructure is presented.

40|$|Visual {{inspection}} is {{an important}} component of aircraft maintenance. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has cited the failure to identify visually detectable corrosion, cracks, or inclusions as the probable cause of several aviation accidents 1, 2, 3. Non-Destructive Inspection (NDI) and Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) procedures require careful visual inspection of aircraft and aircraft components. NDI/NDT personnel must use their vision, with or without various aids, to make judgments grossly, as well as when inspecting aircraft using highly sophisticated imaging and scanning devices (borescopes, ultrasonic scans, eddy current imaging, X-ray, etc.). Presently, there is no existing national policy to ensure that persons performing aircraft maintenance and inspection tasks meet a specific vision requirement. The FAA’s Production and Airworthiness Division (AIR- 200) recognized a general lack of national policy concerning qualification and certification of NDI/NDT programs and prepared a memorandum 4, dated September 26, 2001, to address the issue.

Window display has propagandized media effect. Consumers can get fashion information from shop windows; stores can attract consumers and stimulate their purchase desire. The main purpose of window display is to attraction consumer’s attention, deliver the product’s information and induce consumer’s memory connection. Therefore, vision composition of window display can create psychological feeling and emotion and it will be the first store image information received by consumers; it mainly influences consumer’s decision of whether to stay or make a purchase and so it turns out to be the key factor which determines the success of window display. This research is based on the multitudinous conditions of the <b>vision</b> <b>requirement</b> and the numerous complicated formations of the window display in order to satisfy the visual perception. Through the measurement of the eye-tracker equipment (Face Lab), we seek to understand while the consumers are viewing the window display, how can the various design affect the visual focus and the route production of the consumers. Therefore, it is known through the result of this research’s experiment that 1) when the subject is viewing the windows display, the first visual focus is placed on the central position of the windows, and the visual tracking is been emphasized on the displayed products; 2) The different display position of the products will cast an effect on the concentration distributio...|$|R
