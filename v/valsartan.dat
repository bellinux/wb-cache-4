25|$|<b>Valsartan,</b> {{candesartan}} and irbesartan {{were all}} developed in 1990.|$|E
25|$|Losartan, <b>valsartan,</b> candesartan, irbesartan, {{telmisartan}} and olmesartan all {{contain a}} biphenyl-methyl group.|$|E
25|$|In <b>valsartan,</b> the {{imidazole}} ring of losartan {{has been}} replaced with an acylated amino acid.|$|E
25|$|All of the ARBs, {{except for}} <b>valsartan</b> and olmesartan, are metabolized {{in some way}} by the {{cytochrome}} P450 (CYP) enzyme 2C9, that {{is found in the}} human liver. CYP2C9 is for example responsible for the metabolizing of losartan to EXP 3174 and the slow metabolizing of <b>valsartan</b> and candesartan to their inactive metabolites. Telmisartan is, on the other hand, in part metabolized by glucuronidation and olmesartan is excreted as the unchanged drug.|$|E
25|$|<b>Valsartan,</b> first marketet by Novartis, is a nonheterocyclic ARB, {{where the}} {{imidazole}} of losartan {{has been replaced}} by an acylated amino acid.|$|E
25|$|Irbesartan was {{developed}} by Sanofi Research and is longer acting than <b>valsartan</b> and losartan and it has an imidazolinone ring where a carbonyl group functions as a hydrogen bond acceptor instead of the hydroxymethyl group in losartan. Irbesartan is a non-competitive inhibitor.|$|E
25|$|Candesartan and {{olmesartan}} {{have the}} highest affinity for the AT1 receptors, followed by irbesartan and eprosartan. <b>Valsartan,</b> telmisartan and EXP 3174 have similar affinities that are about ten-fold {{less than that of}} candesartan. Losartan has the least affinity. ARBs' affinity for the AT2 receptor is generally much lower (or around 10,000 times less) than for the AT1 subtype. Therefore they allow unhindered stimulation of the AT2 receptor.|$|E
2500|$|The {{effects of}} drug-related dysgeusia {{can often be}} {{reversed}} by stopping the patient's regimen of the taste altering medication. In one case, a forty-eight-year-old woman who was suffering from hypertension was being treated with <b>valsartan.</b> Due to this drug's inability to treat her condition, she began taking a regimen of eprosartan, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Within three weeks, she began experiencing a metallic taste and a burning sensation in her mouth that ceased when she stopped taking the medication. When she began taking eprosartan on a second occasion, her dysgeusia returned. In a second case, a fifty-nine-year-old man was prescribed amlodipine in order to treat his hypertension. After eight years of taking the drug, he developed a loss of taste sensation and numbness in his tongue. When {{he ran out of}} his medication, he decided not to obtain a refill and stopped taking amlodipine. Following this self-removal, he reported experiencing a return of his taste sensation. Once he refilled his prescription and began taking amlodipine a second time, his taste disturbance reoccurred. These two cases suggest that there is an association between these drugs and taste disorders. This link is supported by the [...] "de-challenge" [...] and [...] "re-challenge" [...] that took place in both instances. It appears that drug-induced dysgeusia can be alleviated by reducing the drug's dose or by substituting a second drug from the same class.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, <b>valsartan</b> (trade name Diovan) {{achieved}} {{annual sales}} of $2.052 billion in the United States and $6.053 billion worldwide. The patents for <b>valsartan</b> and valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide expired in September 2012.|$|E
50|$|Sacubitril/valsartan is co-crystallized sacubitril and <b>valsartan,</b> in a {{one-to-one}} molar ratio. One sacubitril/valsartan complex {{consists of}} six sacubitril anions, six <b>valsartan</b> anions, 18 sodium cations, and 15 molecules of water, {{resulting in the}} molecular formula C288H330N36Na18O48·15H2O and a molecular mass of 5748.03 g/mol.|$|E
50|$|<b>Valsartan</b> may {{increase}} the concentration of lithium.|$|E
50|$|<b>Valsartan</b> {{blocks the}} actions of {{angiotensin}} II, which include constricting blood vessels and activating aldosterone, to reduce blood pressure. The drug binds to angiotensin type I receptors (AT1), working as an antagonist. This mechanism of action is different than the ACE inhibitor drugs, which block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Since <b>valsartan</b> acts at the receptor, it can provide more complete angiotensin II antagonism since angiotensin II is generated by other enzymes as well as ACE. Also, <b>valsartan</b> {{does not affect the}} metabolism of bradykinin like ACE inhibitors do.|$|E
50|$|<b>Valsartan,</b> {{candesartan}} and irbesartan {{were all}} developed in 1990.|$|E
50|$|Amlodipine/valsartan or amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, where <b>valsartan</b> is an {{angiotensin}} II receptor antagonist.|$|E
50|$|Losartan, <b>valsartan,</b> candesartan, irbesartan, {{telmisartan}} and olmesartan all {{contain a}} biphenyl-methyl group.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Valsartan</b> {{falls in}} FDA {{pregnancy}} category D {{and includes a}} black box warning for fetal toxicity. [...] Discontinuation of these agents is recommended immediately after detection of pregnancy and an alternative medication should be started. [...] The US labeling makes no recommendation regarding continuation or discontinuation of <b>valsartan</b> for breast-feeding mothers. The Canadian labeling does not recommend use by nursing women.|$|E
50|$|Sacubitril/valsartan is {{contraindicated}} {{in pregnancy}} {{because it contains}} <b>valsartan,</b> a known risk for birth defects.|$|E
50|$|A 2003 {{study using}} {{candesartan}} and <b>valsartan</b> demonstrated {{an ability to}} regress dilated aortic root size.|$|E
50|$|Some {{studies have}} shown delayed {{progression}} to diabetes in predisposed patients through prophylactic use of metformin, rosiglitazone, or <b>valsartan.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{one study}} of people without diabetes, <b>valsartan</b> reduced the risk of {{developing}} diabetes mellitus over amlodipine, mainly for those with hypertensive.|$|E
50|$|<b>Valsartan,</b> first marketet by Novartis, is a nonheterocyclic ARB, {{where the}} {{imidazole}} of losartan {{has been replaced}} by an acylated amino acid.|$|E
50|$|In {{one study}} after 10 weeks of {{treatment}} with an ARB called losartan (Cozaar), 88% of hypertensive males with sexual dysfunction reported improvement {{in at least}} one area of sexuality, and overall sexual satisfaction improved from 7.3% to 58.5%. In a study comparing beta-blocker carvedilol with <b>valsartan,</b> the angiotensin II receptor blocker not only had no deleterious effect on sexual function, but actually improved it. Other ARBs include candesartan (Atacand), telmisartan (Micardis), and <b>Valsartan</b> (Diovan), fimasartan (Kanarb).|$|E
50|$|Amlodipine/valsartan is {{available}} in different dose preparations: 5 mg/80 mg, 5 mg/160 mg, 10 mg/160 mg, 5 mg/320 mg and 10/320 mg of amlodipine and <b>valsartan,</b> respectively.|$|E
50|$|<b>Valsartan</b> is used {{to treat}} high blood pressure, {{congestive}} heart failure, and to reduce death for people with left ventricular dysfunction after having had a heart attack.|$|E
50|$|In {{people with}} type II {{diabetes}} {{and high blood}} pressure or albumin in the urine, <b>valsartan</b> is used to slow the worsening and the development end-stage renal disease.|$|E
50|$|Novartis {{manufactures}} {{the drugs}} clozapine (Clozaril), diclofenac (Voltaren), carbamazepine (Tegretol), <b>valsartan</b> (Diovan) and imatinib mesylate (Gleevec/Glivec). Additional agents include ciclosporin (Neoral/Sandimmun), letrozole (Femara), methylphenidate (Ritalin), terbinafine (Lamisil), and others.|$|E
50|$|In a small {{study with}} 44 {{patients}} with chronic kidney disease without a history of diabetes, olmesartan was more effective in reducing daily urinary protein (proteinuria) than losartan, <b>valsartan,</b> and candesartan.|$|E
5000|$|Angiotensin {{receptor}} blockers — e.g. Hyzaar (with losartan), Co-Diovan or Diovan HCT (with <b>valsartan),</b> Teveten Plus (with eprosartan), Avalide or CoAprovel (with irbesartan), Atacand HCT or Atacand Plus (with candesartan), etc.|$|E
50|$|Losartan, irbesartan, olmesartan, candesartan, <b>valsartan,</b> fimasartan and azilsartan {{include the}} {{tetrazole}} group (a ring with four nitrogen and one carbon). Losartan, irbesartan, olmesartan, candesartan, and telmisartan include {{one or two}} imidazole groups.|$|E
50|$|All of the ARBs, {{except for}} <b>valsartan</b> and olmesartan, are metabolized {{in some way}} by the {{cytochrome}} P450 (CYP) enzyme 2C9, that {{is found in the}} human liver. CYP2C9 is for example responsible for the metabolizing of losartan to EXP 3174 and the slow metabolizing of <b>valsartan</b> and candesartan to their inactive metabolites. Telmisartan is, on the other hand, in part metabolized by glucuronidation and olmesartan is excreted as the unchanged drug.Telmisartan is the only ARB that can cross the blood-brain barrier and can therefore inhibit centrally mediated effects of Ang II, contributing to even better blood pressure control.|$|E
50|$|In the VALUE trial, the {{angiotensin}} II receptor blocker <b>valsartan</b> {{produced a}} statistically significant 19% (p=0.02) relative increase in the prespecified secondary end point of myocardial infarction (fatal and non-fatal) compared with amlodipine.|$|E
50|$|In a {{study of}} 108 {{patients}} with early morning blood pressure more than 135/85 mmHg, Candesartan showed significantly early morning Blood Pressure decreased over amlodipine, and also to ARBs, <b>valsartan,</b> losartan, telmisartan, but not olmesartan.|$|E
50|$|According to a {{study with}} 18 patients, {{telmisartan}} can replace <b>valsartan</b> and candesartan for hypertensive patients which have also diabetes type II because telmisartan has additional advantages of insulin sensitivity and antiatherosclerosis through probably its effects on PPAR-y.|$|E
50|$|The {{packaging}} for <b>valsartan</b> {{includes a}} warning stating the drug {{should not be}} used with the renin inhibitor aliskiren in people with diabetes mellitus. It also states the drug {{should not be used}} in people with kidney disease.|$|E
50|$|Amlodipine and <b>valsartan</b> is a {{combination}} drugs for hypertension. The combination is not approved for use by anyone younger than 18 years old. For who have diabetes or kidney disease the combination drugs cannot be given with medication that contains aliskiren.|$|E
50|$|Irbesartan was {{developed}} by Sanofi Research and is longer acting than <b>valsartan</b> and losartan and it has an imidazolinone ring where a carbonyl group functions as a hydrogen bond acceptor instead of the hydroxymethyl group in losartan. Irbesartan is a non-competitive inhibitor.|$|E
