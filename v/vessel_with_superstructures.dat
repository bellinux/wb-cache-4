5000|$|Motor Vessel Mississippi was a {{diesel-powered}} <b>vessel</b> <b>with</b> an all-steel <b>superstructure.</b> Powered by two 8-cylinder engines, for a {{total of}} 3720 horsepower, for extra maneuverability it used controllable pitch propellers which allowed it to generate a reverse thrust of over 70% in the forward direction. The four levels on the superstructure were the main deckhouse, second deckhouse, Texas deckhouse, and the pilothouse. It served as a towboat and inspection vessel until decommissioned in 1993. [...] On September 26, 2007 it was moved to its permanent location on land at the Lower Mississippi River Museum in Vicksburg, Mississippi.|$|R
