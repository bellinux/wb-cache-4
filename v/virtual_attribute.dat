40|$|Abstract–With the {{decrease}} in the cost and {{in the size of}} computing devices, wireless sensor networks (WSNET) have the potential of being composed by an extremely large number of nodes offering multiple services. Such networks have the capability of executing multiple tasks concurrently by allocating simply a fraction of their resources. Alternatively, many smaller wireless networks may collaborate to execute a larger, unforeseen application. In both cases a routing scheme other than the prevailing one may improve the efficiency of the task or the application being executed, reducing the energy consumption in the network. We posit that to fully tap into the potential of such networks a new routing infrastructure is needed, one that allows switching between different routing schemes dynamically as required by the applications being deployed, the conditions of the network as a whole and the existing locality information. We show in this paper how dynamic routing scheme selection can be achieved when sensor networks are overlaid with a <b>virtual</b> <b>attribute</b> based cluster hierarchy.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{two problems}} in classification [...] a field within artificial intelligence. One {{is the general}} problem of classifier learning, for which a meta-classification technique called 'virtual attribute subsetting' is developed and tested. The other is object detection, with emphasis on marine creature detection, using the 'Haar Classifier Cascade' method (Viola & Jones, 2001 b). Haar Classifier Cascades are built from a feature set of simple rectangular patterns of relative light and dark. Adaptive boosting selects those features that best {{tell the difference between}} objects and non-objects. In this thesis, a new cascade confidence measure is proposed, equivalent to the boosting 'margin'; it uses information about how well the cascade features match the image region being classified. Tests on the common application of face detection show that this confidence measure improves detection accuracy. <b>Virtual</b> <b>attribute</b> subsetting is also used to modify the cascade; it further improves accuracy at the expense of classification time. In addition, Haar Classifier Cascades are trained to detect two types of marine animal (fish and seahorses). This requires object detection across a wide range of orientations, so approaches using both image and cascade rotation are compared. Results show that image rotation is more accurate than cascade rotation, and that cascades trained to detect objects over a range of angles should have their training images randomly perturbed over a similar (but not always equal) range. Confidence-based detections are also made and show themselves to be more accurate than binary detection. The confidence-based results sum the confidences from similar detections and show that confidence measurements from multiple Haar Classifier Cascades may be combined effectively. Seahorse detection poses an additional problem: seahorses are too flexible to be found by single cascades in any orientation. To solve this, separate seahorse head and body detectors are trained and their detections matched to create whole seahorse detections. Both designed and learnt matching cost formulae are created and two matching algorithms are implemented to link together head and body detections given a cost measurement. The best of the resulting whole seahorse detectors is more accurate than either of the component part detectors. The confidence measurement and <b>virtual</b> <b>attribute</b> subsetting algorithms make no use of domain knowledge, so should improve the accuracy of most other Haar Classifier Cascades. They also have the unusual property of being applicable to already learnt classifiers...|$|E

The real-time functionality is achieved by creating a Bayesian tree via data-mining on agent-based simulations. The computationally expensive parts are handled in an offline phase, while the online phase is computationally cheap. In the offline phase the simulations are run and meaningful clusters of states are identified by use of <b>virtual</b> <b>attributes.</b> Then the transition probabilities between states of different clusters are organized in a Bayesian tree. Finally, in the online phase similarity measures are used again in order to classify query states into the clusters and to infer the probability of future states.

40|$|Object {{oriented}} type analysis traditionally {{works on}} constant values, classes are compile-time constants rather than variables. This {{is safe and}} simple, but not always too expressive. When using type parameters, as with genericity through parameterized classes, the analysis has to work on constrained type variables in order to type check parameterized classes. Like type parameters, <b>virtual</b> type <b>attributes</b> also give rise to constrained type variables during analysis. In both cases, constrained type variables specify relations between types, such that certain statements about types can be proved at compile-time even though complete knowledge about the involved types is not available.

40|$|For centuries {{the title}} of master printer has implied a deep {{technical}} understanding of processes and tools. Printers tend to form a very intimate relationship with their equipment, often resulting in declarations that the press has become an extension of their own hand. There are nuances of running a press with fine attention to detail that only come from hours spent laboring in the process. Beyond that, there is the knowledge of ink and paper and their compatibilities. It is the accumulation of knowledge of each individual aspect of the printing process that makes a printer elevate himself from the role of tradesman {{to that of a}} master printer. In order to be respected as a master printer in the digital realm one must not only hold the technical skills relevant from past mechanical processes, but also obtain the knowledge of the <b>virtual</b> <b>attributes</b> that come with the computing and electronic aspects of digital printing. Color palettes have not only increased beyond the standard CMYK, but the color mixing of these inks has become substantially more refined and requires a different understanding of application. The substitution of a digital printer for a press brings different considerations for process, such as the characteristics of the image file, the printer and ink system, and the substrate used for output. Yet it is still the ability to make the equipment an extension of the self, by obtaining the knowledge of the processes, consumables, and developing technologies in order to produce prints of a high quality, that makes the digital master printer akin to his traditional contemporaries. This paper introduces the physical and virtual aspects of digital printmaking that must be considered in order to obtain the level of quality expected from a master printer working with the digital technologies of the twenty-first century...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} this study was to gain an {{understanding}} of how one 2 ̆ 7 s motivation influences the relationship between work satisfaction and utilization of certain <b>attributes</b> associated with <b>virtual</b> team effectiveness. An explanatory sequential mixed methods design was used to measure and analyze correlations between individual work satisfaction and utilization of <b>virtual</b> team effectiveness <b>attributes</b> dependent upon participant motivation patterns and characteristics. In the first, quantitative phase of the study, the Motivation Sources Inventory (© Future Leadership) was utilized in collecting data globally from employed virtual team members via an online survey to measure participant work motivation for the five sources, as defined by Leonard, Beauvais, and Scholl (1999) : Intrinsic Process, Self-concept Internal, Self-concept External, Instrumental, and Goal Internalization. A modified version of The Virtual Teams Survey instrument developed by Lurey (1998) was employed concurrently to measure perceptions about the levels of utilization of various <b>virtual</b> team effectiveness <b>attributes</b> and the level of work satisfaction. ^ In the second qualitative phase, follow-up interviews were conducted to confirm and help explain the quantitative results. Insight into how an individual 2 ̆ 7 s motivation influences the relationship between work satisfaction and utilization of <b>virtual</b> team effectiveness <b>attributes</b> suggests that individuals possessing moderate or higher levels of goal internalization relative to other types of work motivation may find virtual team work satisfying. However, findings suggest that work satisfaction, regardless of motivation pattern, may be improved by strengthening team leadership, aligning rewards with goals, and enhancing the communications technology utilized by virtual teams. More importantly, this knowledge may aid virtual team leaders in integrating, leading, and empowering diverse teams so that they function cohesively and effectively in achieving their missions. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{notions of}} class, {{subclass}} and virtual procedure are fairly well understood and recognized {{as some of}} the key concepts in objectoriented programming. The possibility of modifying a virtual procedure in a subclass is a powerful technique for specializing the general properties of the superclass. In most object-oriented languages, the attributes of an object may be references to objects and (virtual) procedures. In Simula and BETA it is also possible to have class attributes. The power of class attributes has not yet been widely recognized. In BETA a class may also have <b>virtual</b> class <b>attributes.</b> This makes it possible to defer part of the specification of a class attribute to a subclass. In this sense virtual classes are analogous to virtual procedures. Virtual classes are mainly interesting within strongly typed languages where they 1 provide a mechanism for defining general parameterized classes such as set, vector and list. In this sense they provide an alternative to generics. Although the notion of virtual class originates from BETA, it is presented as a general language mechanism...|$|R
