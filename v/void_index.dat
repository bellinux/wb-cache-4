40|$|International audienceOedometer tests {{starting}} {{from a very}} small effective vertical stress of 0. 5 kPa were performed on three reconstituted clays with different liquid limits. The soils were prepared at various initial water contents, ranging from 0. 7 to 2. 0 times their corresponding liquid limits. It is observed that the e-logσv´ compression curves show an inverse “S” shape due to suction pressure resisting deformation, {{similar to that of}} soft natural clays caused by consolidation yield stress. The suction pressure σs´ of the reconstituted clays can be correlated with the ratio of initial void ratio to void ratio at liquid limit e 0 /eL. The suction pressure curve (SPC) defined by a unique relationship between suction pressure σs´ and the normalised void ratio at suction pressure es/eL is also proposed to distinguish between the pre-suction and the post-suction states. In addition, Burland's concept of intrinsic compression line (ICL) is adopted for correlating the compression curves of various reconstituted clays at high initial water contents. It has been found that the <b>void</b> <b>index</b> is a powerful parameter for normalising the compression curves in the post-suction state.

40|$|The {{railway track}} network plays an {{essential}} role of the transportation infrastructure worldwide. During operations, the ballast becomes contaminated or fouled due to the infiltration of fines from the surface, mud pumping up from the subgrade, and ballast degradation under repeated train loading. In Queensland and New South Wales, Australia, ballast degradation and infiltration of fine particles such as coal and soft subgrade fills the voids in the ballast layer, which restricts drainage, and results in uneven track settlement and high maintenance costs to clean the ballast. Geosynthetics have been increasingly used in railroads to provide reinforcement and confinement pressure to the layer of ballast. However, the interaction mechanism and behaviour of the geosynthetics and ballast at their interface are not well understood, particularly when the ballast is severely fouled. This {{is due to the}} steady accumulation of fine particles that clog the apertures of the geosynthetics, which dramatically reduces its beneficial effects and also causes track instability associated with substantial deformation. This research aims to study how the interface between ballast and geogrid copes with fouling by coal fines. The shear stress-displacement behaviour of fresh and fouled ballast, and ballast reinforced with geogrids was investigated through a series of large-scale direct shear tests where the levels of fouling ranged from 0 % to 95 % <b>Void</b> Contamination <b>Index</b> (VCI), and at relatively low normal stresses varying from 15 kPa to 75 kPa. The results indicated that inclusion of geogrids increases the shear strength and apparent angle of shearing resistance, while only slightly reducing the vertical displacement of the composite geogrid-ballast system. However, when the ballast was fouled by coal fines, the benefits of geogrid reinforcement decreased in proportion to the increasing level of fouling. A conceptual normalised shear strength model was proposed to predict this decrease in the peak shear stress and peak angle of shearing resistance caused by coal fines at a given normal stress. A novel Track Process Simulation Apparatus (TPSA) was used to simulate realistic rail track conditions subjected to cyclic loading and the <b>Void</b> Contamination <b>Index</b> (VCI) was used to evaluate the level of ballast fouling. The inclusion of geogrid at the interface between the layer of ballast and sub-ballast provides additional internal confinement and particle interlocking via the geogrid apertures, which reduces deformation. A threshold value of VCI= 40 % has been proposed to assist practitioners in conducting track maintenance. If the level of fouling exceeds this threshold the geogrid reinforcement significantly decreases its effectiveness, and the fouled ballast exhibits pronounced dilation. Based on the experimental results, an equation incorporating VCI was proposed to predict the deformation of fresh and fouled ballast. This equation improves track design and assists in making appropriate and timely decisions on track maintenance. The Discrete Element Method (DEM) was used to study the shear behaviour of fresh and fouled ballast in direct shear testing. The volumetric changes and stress-strain behaviour of fresh and fouled ballast were simulated and compared with the experimental results [...] Fouled ballast with various <b>Void</b> Contaminant <b>Index</b> (VCI), ranging from 20 %VCI to 70 %VCI, were modelled by injecting a specified number of miniature spherical particles into the voids of fresh ballast. The DEM simulation highlights the fact that the peak shear stress of the ballast assembly decreases and the dilation of fouled ballast increases with an increasing of VCI. Furthermore, the distribution of contact force chains and particle displacement vectors clearly explains the formation of a shear band and the evolution of volumetric change during shearing.

40|$|International audienceThe {{intercept}} of the log(1 +e) - logσv' {{straight line}} is introduced {{to describe the}} effect of the starting point on the compressibility of natural and reconstituted clays. It is found that when the effective stress exceeds the remoulded yield stress, the compression behaviour of reconstituted clays is controlled solely by the water content at the remoulded yield stress and the liquid limit. Comparison of the compression behaviour of natural and reconstituted clays indicates that their difference in compressibility is caused by soil structure and the difference in water content at the compression starting point. The compression behaviour of natural clays can be classified into three regimes: 1) the pre-yield regime characterised by small compressibility with soil structure restraining the deformation up to the consolidation yield stress; 2) the transitional regime characterised by a gradual loss of soil structure when the effective stress is between the consolidation yield stress and the transitional stress; and 3) the post-transitional regime characterised by the same change law in compression behaviour as reconstituted clays when the effective stress is higher than the transitional stress. For the investigated clays, the transitional stress is 1. 0 - 3. 5 times the consolidation yield stress. The compression index varies solely with the void ratio at an effective stress of 1. 0 kPa for both natural clays in post-transitional regime and reconstituted clays when the effective stress exceeds the remoulded yield stress, and when compressed in such cases the compression curves of both natural clays and reconstituted clays can be normalised well to a unique line using the <b>void</b> <b>index...</b>|$|E

Although improvements {{have been made in}} identifying the processes that occur within the critical zone of soil immediately surrounding the pile, in literature are not available theories which allow to quantify the changes in state of soil during the load (stress, <b>void</b> <b>index).</b> This assessment is particularly true for piles embedded in sandy soils, on which the paper will focus on. Granular soils at shallow depth from surface are subjected to low confining stresses, hence potentially dilating when sheared at failure. This is what systematically happens in the upper portion of axially loaded piles, as demonstrated by several experimental data collected by a number of researcher: it is well known from literature that measured unit shaft resistances are usually greater than theoretical values (e. g. O’Neill e Hassan, 1994; Chen e Kulhawy, 2002; Rollins et al., 2005). In the thesis a conceptual framework for estimating pile shaft capacity has been presented, in which the dilatant behaviour of sand in the shear band, partially forbidden from the surrounding soil, is explicitly considered: shear band develops in a small portion of soil close to pile shaft and its thickness is controlled by grain size, since it is of the order of 5 to 20 times d 50. Theoretical model led numerical analyses (which have been performed with FLAC 2 D, a two-dimensional explicit finite difference code), which focused on shaft friction evolution at pile-soil interface for “wished in place” axially loaded single piles, embedded in sandy soils. In detail, parametric analyses have been performed by changing relative density, stress history (OCR), friction angle and grain size distribution. Numerical results highlighted those critical aspects which cannot be ignored if shaft friction evolution must be predict. Dilatancy of sand in shear bands at the pile-soil interface {{plays a major role in}} increasing normal stress (thus unit shaft friction) during loading, but its effect is strictly modulated by its initial thickness, or rather by grain size distribution. In others words, irrespective of its dilatants potentiality, fine sands does not allow for large values of qs as a consequence of plastic volumetric strains confined in a very thin shear band. Obviously all above strongly influences the pile load-settlement curve for a given soil condition, but with different grading. From these results, a new designing approach is suggested in which shaft resistance prediction moves from a physical and mechanical behaviour description of soils surrounding pile shaft. The applicability of the proposed approach is showed for some real case study of vertical load tests on instrumented piles...|$|E
40|$|The lack {{of optical}} {{constants}} information for hybrid perovskite of CH 3 NH 3 PbBr 3 in thin films form can delay {{the progress of}} efficient LED or laser demonstration. Here, {{we report on the}} optical constants (complex refractive index and dielectric function) of CH 3 NH 3 PbBr 3 perovskite thin films using spectroscopic ellipsometry. Due to the existence of <b>voids,</b> the refractive <b>index</b> of the thin films is around 8 % less than the single crystals counterpart. The energy bandgap is around 2. 309 eV as obtained from photoluminescence and spectrophotometry spectra, and calculated from the SE analysis. The precise measurement of optical constants will be useful in designing optical devices using CH 3 NH 3 PbBr 3 thin films...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental study of coal-fouled ballast reinforced with geogrid, at various degrees of fouling and subjected to cyclic loading. A novel Track Process Simulation Testing Apparatus was used to realistically simulate fouled rail track conditions. The laboratory results demonstrated that coal fines acted as a lubricant, causing ballast aggregates to displace and rotate and, as a result, increase the deformation of ballast. However, coal fines also reduced ballast breakage somewhat because they fill the voids between the ballast particles and coat surface of ballast aggregates which reduce the inter-particle attrition. The placement of a geogrid at the interface between the ballast and sub-ballast layers provides extra internal confinement and interlocks the grains of ballast in its apertures, which also reduces ballast deformation. Based on laboratory results, a threshold value of VCI= 40 % is proposed to assist practitioners in conducting track maintenance as fouling beyond this threshold significantly reduces the reinforcement effect of geogrid so that fouled ballast experiences premature dilation leading to track instability. A novel equation incorporating the <b>Void</b> Contaminant <b>Index</b> and number of load cycles is also introduced to predict the deformation of fouled ballast, improve the design of rail tracks and help make the correct decisions with regards to track maintenance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In dusty plasmas, {{when the}} {{gravitational}} {{force on the}} particles is compensated, usually an extended dust cloud with a central dust-free void emerges. Fast particles are injected into the void and followed along their trajectories in three dimensions. They act as probes to measure the forces forming the void. An image illustrating this three-dimensional resolved force field inside the <b>void</b> is presented. <b>Index</b> Terms—Dusty plasma, force measurement, microgravity, stereo vision. DUSTY plasmas, i. e., gas discharges containingmicrometer-sized particles, have attracted much attention in the last decades. The dust structures evolving in such plasmas are easily observed by video microscopy. With the evolution of tools for the 3 -D diagnostic of dust structures in complex plasmas, research has been extended to larger, 3 -D systems. For the formation of such extended dust structures...|$|R
40|$|Australian {{railways}} {{offer an}} efficient and economic mode for transporting freight and passengers across all States. Conventionally, rail tracks are positioned on ballast for reasons including economy (availability and abundance), rapid drainage, and high load bearing capacity. However, the ballast becomes fouled {{due to the}} intrusion of fines either from the subgrade or surface which impairs track drainage. In order to maintain serviceability, {{it is necessary to}} maintain adequate drainage capacity in the track. To identify the risk associated with fouling, {{it is important to understand}} the effects of the amount of fouling on drainage conditions. In this present study a critical assessment of different types of mass based fouling indices was carried out. A new parameter, the <b>Void</b> Contaminant <b>Index,</b> which considers variations in the specific gravity of ballast and fouling materials, is proposed to evaluate the amount of fouling. A series of large scale constant head hydraulic conductivity tests were conducted to establish the relationship between the extent of fouling and the associated hydraulic conductivity. Subsequently, a seepage analysis was carried out using finite element software to simulate a more realistic two-dimensional flow under actual track geometry to capture the drainage capacity of ballast. The drainage condition of the track was classified into different categories using the average rainfall in Australia. Finally, a maintenance schedule for practising engineers was provided based on the proposed drainage criteria...|$|R
