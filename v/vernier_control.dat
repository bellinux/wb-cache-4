40|$|Two {{mutually}} perpendicular bias fields provide <b>vernier</b> <b>control</b> {{over the}} plasma {{location in the}} vacuum chamber. A radially outward horizontal field is generated by a separate set of two bias coils mounted horizontally {{above and below the}} vacuum chamber and connected in series opposing. The vertical bias field is generated by superimposing a bias current on the main vertical field or shaping field coils. A forward or aiding bias field is generated by simply programming an incremental forward current into the main shaping field supply. For a reverse bias field, however, a reverse current supply is required which must establish negative bias current in the shaping field coil prior to the plasma formation. After plasma formation, as the plasma current increases and induces a forward voltage in the field coil, the bias current goes to zero. When the coil current goes positive, the reverse bias supply is taken out of the circuit to prevent it from acting as a short circuit across the SF coil. (auth...|$|E

Although the rigid body response was acceptable with the orbiter Primary Reaction Control System, the flexible body response showed large structural deflections and loads.

40|$|A system {{capable of}} {{satisfying}} the accuracy and stability requirements dictated by Shuttle-borne payloads utilizing large optics {{has been under}} joint NASA/Sperry development. This device, denoted the Annular Suspension and Pointing System, employs a unique combination of conventional gimbals and magnetic bearing actuators, thereby providing for the complete isolation of the payload from its external environment, {{as well as for}} extremely accurate and stable pointing (equal to about 0. 01 arcsec). This effort has been pursued through the fabrication and laboratory evaluation of engineering model hardware. Results from these tests have been instrumental in generating high fidelity computer simulations of this load isolation and precision pointing system, and in permitting confident predictions of the system's on-orbit performance. The applicability of this system to the Solar Optical Telescope mission has been examined using the computer simulation.

50|$|Missile 8E on January 24, 1961 lost {{roll control}} due to {{aerodynamic}} heating shorting the <b>vernier</b> pitch <b>control</b> servo, {{a problem that}} had not occurred since the early Atlas A tests. Missile 9E on February 4 experienced problems with the propellant utilization system and prematurely depleted its fuel supply, however the warhead landed {{only a few miles}} short of the target, so the flight was considered a success. Missile 13E (March 14) experienced a similar problem, but with a much earlier sustainer cutoff and the warhead missed its target by almost 2000 miles. Missile 16E (March 25) depleted its supply of helium control gas early, making it impossible to jettison the booster section. The missile was dragged down by the weight of the spent booster engines and fell short of its intended range, also the propellant utilization system malfunctioned again and caused the engines to run fuel rich. The failure was traced to two mistakenly transposed wires which caused spurious venting of the control helium out the vernier engines.|$|R
40|$|The Astro- 2 mission {{scheduled}} for Jan. 1995 flight is co-manifested with the Spartan experiment. The Astro instrument array consists of several telescopes {{operating in the}} UV spectrum. To obtain the desired 300 observations with the telescope array in a shorter time than the Astro- 1 mission, {{it will be necessary}} to use the primary reaction control system (PRCS) rather than just the <b>Vernier</b> reaction <b>control</b> system. The high mass flow rate of the PRCS engines cause considerable concern about contamination due to PRCS plume return flux. Performance of these instruments depends heavily on the environment they encounter. The ability of the optical system to detect a remote signal depends not only on the intensity of the incoming signal, but also on the ensuing transmission loss through the optical train of the instrument. Performance of these instruments is thus dependent on the properties of the optical surface and the medium through which it propagates. The on-orbit contamination environment will have a strong influence on the performance of these instruments. The finding of a two-month study of the molecular contamination environment of the Astro- 2 instruments due to PRCS thruster plumes during the planned Astro- 2 mission are summarized...|$|R
40|$|A {{program for}} {{analyzing}} the flowfield parameters {{in the neighborhood}} of the Space Shuttle Orbiter has been developed. The program uses the direct simulation Monte Carlo method, which is a completely probabilistic Monte Carlo technique capable of analyzing 3 -dimensional steady or unsteady flow with prescribed internal and external boundary conditions. The freestream flux densities incident on the external flowfield boundaries are calculated from the drifting Maxwellian gas properties of the freestream. The flux entering the flowfield from the internal boundary is calculated from the outgassing flux density distribution over the Shuttle external surface and the prescribed discrete source fluxes. This technique produces a numerical flowfield solution which is the probabilistic equivalent of a complete solution of the time-dependent, 3 -dimensional Boltzmann equation. Flowfield results are presented for the following configurations: (1) Shuttle angles of attack of 0 and 90 deg, (2) freestream density 10 to the 9 th - 10 to the 11 th per cu cm, (3) Shuttle outgassing flux density, and (4) operation of the aft downfiring <b>vernier</b> Reaction <b>Control</b> System (RCS) engine.

40|$|In the {{modeling}} of spacecraft dynamics {{it is important}} to accurately characterize the environment in which the vehicle operates, including the environments induced by the vehicle itself. On the Space Shuttle these induced environmental factors include reaction control system plume. Knowledge of these environments is necessary for performance of control systems and loads analyses, estimation of disturbances due to thruster firings, and accurate state vector propagation. During the STS- 71 mission, while the Orbiter was performing attitude control for the mated Orbiter/Mir stack, it was noted that the autopilot was limit cycling at a rate higher than expected from pre-flight simulations. Investigations during the mission resulted in the conjecture that an unmodelled plume impingement force was acting upon the orbiter elevons. The in-flight investigations were not successful in determining the actual magnitude of the impingement, resulting in several sequential post-flight investigations. Efforts performed to better quantify the <b>vernier</b> reaction <b>control</b> system induced plume impingement environment of the Space Shuttle orbiter are described in this paper, and background detailing circumstances which required the more detailed knowledge of the RCS self impingement forces, as well as a description of the resulting investigations and their results is presented. The investigations described in this paper applied microgravity acceleration data from two shuttle borne microgravity experiments, SAMS and OARE, to the solution of this particular problem. This solution, now used by shuttle analysts and mission planners, results in more accurate propellant consumption and attitude limit cycle estimates in preflight analyses, which are critical for pending International Space Station missions...|$|R
40|$|The {{microgravity}} {{environment of}} the Space Shuttle Columbia was measured during the STS- 73 mission using accelerometers from five different instruments: the Orbital Acceleration Research Experiment, the Space Acceleration Measurement System, the Three-dimensional Microgravity Accelerometer, the Microgravity Measuring Device, and Suppression of Transient Accelerations by Levitation Evaluation System. The Microgravity Analysis Workstation quasi-steady environment calculation and comparison of this calculation with Orbital Acceleration Research Experiment data {{was used to assess}} how appropriate a planned attitude was expected to be for one Crystal Growth Facility experiment sample. The microgravity environment related to several different Orbiter, crew, and experiment operations is presented and interpreted in this report. Data are examined to show the effects of <b>vernier</b> reaction <b>control</b> system jet firings for Orbiter attitude control. This is compared to examples of data when no thrusters were firing, when the primary reaction control system jets were used for attitude control, and when single vernier jets were fired for test purposes. In general, vernier jets, when used for attitude control, cause accelerations in the 3 x 10 (exp - 4) g to 7 x 10 (exp - 4) g range. Primary jets used in this manner cause accelerations in the 0. 01 to 0. 025 g range. Other significant disturbance sources characterized are water dump operations, with Y(sub b) axis acceleration deviations of about 1 x 10 (exp - 6) g; payload bay door opening motion, with Y(sub o) and Z(sub o) axis accelerations of frequency 0. 4 Hz; and probable Glovebox fan operations with notable frequency components at 20, 38, 43, 48, and 53 Hz.

40|$|The Space Shuttle {{acceleration}} {{environment is}} characterized. The acceleration environment {{is composed of}} a residual or quasi-steady component and higher frequency components induced by vehicle structural modes and the operation of onboard machinery. Quasi-steady accelerations are generally due to atmospheric drag, gravity gradient effects, and rotational forces. These accelerations tend to vary with the orbital frequency (approx. 10 (exp - 4) Hz) and have magnitudes {{less than or equal}} to 10 (exp - 6) g(sub 0) (where 1 g(sub 0) is terrestrial gravity). Higher frequency g-jitter is characterized by oscillatory disturbances in the 1 - 100 Hz range and transient components. Oscillatory accelerations are related to the response of large flexible structures like antennae, the Spacelab module, and the Orbiter itself, and to the operation of rotating machinery. The Orbiter structural modes in the 1 - 10 Hz range, are excited by oscillatory and transient disturbances and tend to dominate the energy spectrum of the acceleration environment. A comparison of the acceleration measurements from different Space Shuttle missions reveals the characteristic signature of the structural modes of the Orbiter overlaid with mission specific hardware induced disturbances and their harmonics. Transient accelerations are usually attributed to crew activity and Orbiter thruster operations. During crew sleep periods, the acceleration levels are typically on the order of 10 (exp - 6) g(sub 0) (1 micro-g). Crew work and exercise tend to raise the accelerations to the 10 (exp - 3) g(sub 0) (1 milli-g) level. <b>Vernier</b> reaction <b>control</b> system firings tend to cause accelerations of 10 (exp - 4) g(sub 0), while primary reaction control system and Orbiter maneuvering system firings cause accelerations as large as 10 (exp - 2) g(sub 0).

The Orbital Acceleration Research Experiment provided investigators with real-time quasi-steady acceleration measurements. The Space Acceleration Measurement System recorded higher frequency data on-board for post-mission analysis. The Microgravity Measurement Assembly provided investigators with real-time quasi-steady and higher frequency acceleration measurements. The Microgravity Analysis Workstation provided calculation of the quasi-steady environment. This calculation {{was presented to the}} science teams in real-time during the mission. The microgravity environment related to several different Orbiter, crew and experiment operations is presented and interpreted in this report. A radiator deploy, the Flight Control System checkout, and a <b>vernier</b> reaction <b>control</b> system reboost demonstration had minimal effects on the acceleration environment, with excitation of frequencies in the 0. 01 to 10 Hz range. Flash Evaporator System venting had no noticeable effect on the environment while supply and waste water dumps caused excursions of 2 x lO(exp - 6) to 4 x 10 (exp - 6) g in the Y(sub b) and Z(sub b) directions.
