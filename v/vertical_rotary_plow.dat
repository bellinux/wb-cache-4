40|$|Abstract: Long term {{exposure}} of tractor driver to vibrations induced by agricultural machinery operations {{may lead to}} health problems. Therefore it is valuable to obtain the range of frequencies transmitted to tractor driver while performing farm operations, hence in the present study, in order to record tractor driver whole body vibrations, fabrication and evaluation of an inexpensive tractor vibration measuring system was considered. According {{to the results of}} this study, testing the system in static and dynamic conditions approved the system performance. Furthermore, the value of S ed indexes of plowing with moldboard and <b>rotary</b> <b>plows</b> were 0. 35 MPa and 0. 4 MPa respectively. Based on the criterion of USAARL, since these values were lower than 0. 65 MPa, the severity category of operation with the examined plows were graded in the class of 3; which means that the health hazard associated with these operations were marginal. Moreover, dominant frequencies transmitted to driver seat were in the range of 0 - 3 Hz...|$|R
50|$|In {{areas of}} {{particularly}} deep snowfall, such as California's Donner Pass, railroads sometimes created a train {{consisting of a}} rotary snowplow at each end, with the blade ends pointing away from each other, {{and two or three}} locomotives coupled between them. With a plow on each end, the train was able to return to its starting location even if the snow covered the tracks it had just passed over. Such a train would also be able to clear multiple track mainlines efficiently as it could make a pass in one direction on one track, then reverse direction and clear the next track. This practice became standard for the Southern Pacific Railroad on Donner Pass following the January 1952 stranding of the City of San Francisco train; during attempts to clear the avalanches that had trapped the train, two <b>rotary</b> <b>plows</b> were themselves trapped by avalanches, and the crew of a third was killed when their plow was hit by an avalanche.|$|R

Snow drifts from 100 mph (160 km/h) winds blocked the train burying it in 12 feet of snow and stranding it from January 13 to 19. The event made international headlines. In the effort to reach the train, the railroad's snow-clearing equipment and snow-blowing <b>rotary</b> <b>plows</b> became frozen to the tracks near Emigrant Gap. Hundreds of workers and volunteers, including escaped German POW Georg Gärtner, using snowplows, tractors and manpower {{came to the rescue}} by clearing nearby Route 40 to reach the train. The 196 passengers and 20 crewmembers were evacuated within 72 hours, on foot to vehicles that carried them the few highway miles to Nyack Lodge.

50|$|For {{production}} agriculture, {{past and}} present, two-wheel tractors accept {{a wide range}} of implements, such as the following: For soil-working: rototillers, moldboard <b>plows,</b> disc-plows, <b>rotary</b> <b>plows,</b> root/tuber harvesting plows, small subsoiler plows, powered and non-powered harrows, seeders, transplanters, and planters. Even zero till/no-till planters and seeders have become available. In plant protection and weed control, two-wheel tractor implements consist of various inter-cultivators and sprayers. For harvesting, available implements are: Forage: Sickle bar mowers, disk mowers, hayrakes, hay tedders, haybalers and bale wrappers silage production. For grain harvest: reaper/grain harvesters, reaper-binders, and even combine harvesters are available typically only for Asian two-wheel tractors. For transport, trailers with capacities from 0.5 to 5 plus ton cargoes are available. General mowing implements consist of lawn mowers, brush mowers, and flail mowers. For snow removal, implements consist of snowblowers, power sweepers, and snow/dozer blades. Other implements include: chipper/shredders, log splitters, electrical generator, pressure washer, crimper-roller, fertilizer/salt/lime spreader, and stump grinder. This list of implements (which may not be complete) means that two-wheel tractors can execute practically all of the chores done by larger 4-wheel tractors, with the exception of items like front-loaders, which obviously have the physical stability requirements of a 4-wheel (two-axle) tractor.|$|R

40|$|Spatial data of soil {{properties}} {{which are}} accurate and inexpensive {{is necessary to}} improve yields and to plan precision farming strategies. Currently the problem lies in the data that are not always updated, because the conventional soil testing is costly and relatively time consuming. This {{is due to the}} location of the soil testing laboratory which is far away from the location of the farm. So that the map information soil nutrient content is usually renewed in certain interval of time. In addition, available data are still global and not location specific. Electrical conductivity (EC) can be used as an indicator for measuring the condition of the soil in precision farming applications because of its fast and efficient. This study aims to develop an acquisition method of spatial macro nutrient content as reference for recommendation of fertilizer dossage. The study was conducted on 0. 1 ha of land which was divided into 40 grid with a size of 5 x 5 m and planted with peanuts.

40|$|The wear {{resistance}} of <b>rotary</b> <b>plows</b> {{operating in a}} clay loam soil was studied. The degree of damage caused to the soil {{and the amount of}} mass lost by the tools were determined in order to establish correlations between the physical properties of the soil and the wear mechanisms acting on the tribosystem. Field tests were carried out in 12 plots and a randomized experimental design with 4 levels, 3 replicas per level and 2 passes per plot was applied. The levels relate to the tillage implements employed: rotary tiller, rotary power harrow, small motorized rotary tiller and control (unaltered soil). The highest mass losses were measured in rotary tiller and rotary power harrow's tools, while the small motorized rotary tiller's tools showed generally lower levels of damage. It was determined that the effective contact time between tool and soil, the rotating speed and the sudden impact forces are the most significant factors affecting the {{wear resistance}} in field operations. Thirty days after tillage operation the soil samples were taken from each plot at a mean depth of 100 mm in order to determine bulk density, gravimetric moisture content and percentage of aggregates smaller than 5 mm. No significant differences among the values of these properties were found in the experiments. The wear mechanisms acting on the tools' surface are complex and include 2 -body and 3 -body abrasion as well as the presence of sudden impact forces...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to determine the}} coefficients of sorption and desorption of picloram in Ultisol (PVA) and Oxisol (LVA), displaying different physical and chemical characteristics. Samples of soil were collected at the 0 20 cm depth in degraded pasture areas in Viçosa-MG. Firstly, the equilibrium time between the herbicide in solution and the herbicide which was sorbed in the soil was determined by the Batch Equilibrium method. The time required was 24 hours. Sorption and desorption studies were carried out under controlled laboratory conditions; the sorption evaluation consisted in adding 10. 0 mL of herbicide solutions at different concentrations to tubes containing 2. 00 g of soil, with <b>vertical</b> <b>rotary</b> agitation being maintained during the pre-determined equilibrium time. After centrifugation, supernatant extract cleaning and filtration, herbicide concentration was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV detection at 254 nm. Desorption was evaluated using the samples in the tubes after the sorption tests. The Freundlich model was used for interpretation of the sorption process. Ultisol showed higher adsorption coefficient (Kf a) compared with Oxisol, which may be attributed to the lower pH of the soil and its higher organic matter content. Desorption process occurred in both soils; the LVA allowed greater release of the previously sorbed molecules...|$|R
