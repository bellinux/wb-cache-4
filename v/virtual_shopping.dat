50|$|Designers {{of online}} shops are {{concerned}} with the effects of information load. Information load {{is a product of the}} spatial and temporal arrangements of stimuli in the web store. Compared with conventional retail shopping, the information environment of <b>virtual</b> <b>shopping</b> is enhanced by providing additional product information such as comparative products and services, as well as various alternatives and attributes of each alternative, etc. Two major dimensions of information load are complexity and novelty. Complexity refers to the number of different elements or features of a site, often the result of increased information diversity. Novelty involves the unexpected, suppressed, new, or unfamiliar aspects of the site. The novelty dimension may keep consumers exploring a shopping site, whereas the complexity dimension may induce impulse purchases.|$|E
50|$|In {{computer}} science, {{a session}} identifier, session ID or session token {{is a piece}} of data that is used in network communications (often over HTTP) to identify a session, a series of related message exchanges. Session identifiers become necessary in cases where the communications infrastructure uses a stateless protocol such as HTTP. For example, a buyer who visits a seller's site wants to collect a number of articles in a <b>virtual</b> <b>shopping</b> cart and then finalize the shopping by going to the site's checkout page. This typically involves an ongoing communication where several webpages are requested by the client and sent back to them by the server. In such a situation, it is vital {{to keep track of the}} current state of the shopper's cart, and a session ID is one way to achieve that goal.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{availability}} of freshwater aquarium fish species for sale was surveyed from July 2005 to June 2006 in Brazilian electronic commerce and the Orkut website. São Paulo {{was the leading}} state regarding <b>virtual</b> <b>shops,</b> auctions on Arremate/Mercado Livre, and hobbyists on Orkut, with 52, 44 and 46 %, respectively. The Southeast and South regions led the offer of pest species such as C. carpio, C. auratus and P. reticulata. Among the 207 species for sale, 14 species considered potential pests were identified, contrasting with only one page that warned {{about the dangers of}} aquarium dumping. The easy access to fish (especially the potential pest species) through e-commerce and Orkut, together with the low total price (unitary value + shipping and handling ranging from US $ 17. 67 to 30. 39), and fast interstate delivery (two-four days on average) confirm the widespread e-commerce accessibility and its high dispersal potential via postal services and home hobbyists trade. It is imperative to enforce the use of warnings or alert messages in e-commerce about the dangers of biological invasions. Key words: <b>virtual</b> <b>shops,</b> hobbyists, biological invasions.

40|$|BUILDING A <b>VIRTUAL</b> <b>SHOP</b> MODEL FOR STEEL FABRICATION Steel {{fabrication}} is {{a complex}} process, which encompasses product uniqueness, a high product mix, {{and a number of}} activities involving a variety of equipment and labor disciplines. The steel fabrication industry needs advanced tools and techniques in order to estimate, plan, and control fabrication shops. This paper proposes a system for building <b>virtual</b> fabrication <b>shop</b> models capable of estimating, scheduling, and analyze production. The system defines conceptual models for product, process, and the fabrication facility itself. It offers tools, such as product modeling, process modeling and planning, and a special purpose facility modeling tool, which allow users to implement these conceptual models. Modeling enhancements have enabled a more accurate modeling of machine and labor productivity, as well as better management of shop production rules. The modeling capability of the developed system is demonstrated through a case study. ...|$|R
