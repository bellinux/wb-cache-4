5|$|Fauna is sparse on {{the island}} due to a {{combination}} of a lack of vegetation and the consequences of phosphates mining. Many indigenous birds have disappeared or become rare owing to destruction of their habitat. There are about 60recorded <b>vascular</b> <b>plant</b> species native to the island, none of which are endemic. Coconut farming, mining, and introduced species have caused serious disturbance to the native vegetation.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1965, the first <b>vascular</b> <b>plant</b> was found growing on the {{northern}} shore of Surtsey, mosses became visible in 1967, and lichens were first found on the Surtsey lava in 1970. Plant colonisation on Surtsey has been closely studied, the vascular plants in particular {{as they have been}} of far greater significance than mosses, lichens and fungi in the development of vegetation.|$|E
5|$|The {{vegetation}} in the atoll is sparse, {{because of}} the lack of fresh water. Only two species of <b>vascular</b> <b>plant</b> are currently known to grow there one of the smallest such floras on any island. Acadia, Pandora and Edwards Islets are forested with Heliotropium foertherianum, but Westward Islet is not. Pemphis acidula has also been recorded on Ducie; specimens were found during an expedition in 1991.|$|E
25|$|According to the cladogram, {{the genus}} Rhynia {{illustrates}} two {{steps in the}} evolution of modern <b>vascular</b> <b>plants.</b> <b>Plants</b> have <b>vascular</b> tissue, albeit significantly simpler than modern <b>vascular</b> <b>plants.</b> Their gametophytes are distinctly smaller than their sporophytes (but have vascular tissue, unlike almost all modern <b>vascular</b> <b>plants).</b>|$|R
40|$|China has 31, 362 {{species of}} <b>vascular</b> <b>plants,</b> {{more than any}} country on the planet except Brazil and Colombia, and this number {{represents}} 8 %- 12 % of the world diversity of <b>vascular</b> <b>plants.</b> With the two largest completed floristic projects in the world, a full documentation of the <b>vascular</b> <b>plants</b> of China has been published twice over the past 54 years: the Chinese-language Flora Reipublicae Popularis Sinicae (FRPS), 1959 - 2004, and the English-language Flora of China (FOC), 1994 - 2013. With the advent of molecular phylogenetics {{the past half century}} has witnessed dramatical changes of classifications of <b>vascular</b> <b>plants.</b> In this paper, we compare the circumscriptions of all families of <b>vascular</b> <b>plants</b> occurring within China in FRPS, FOC, and the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) III system when applicable, and summarize familial assignments of all controversial genera in the different classifications. Such comparison to some extent reflects the history of classification of <b>vascular</b> <b>plants</b> and differences between classical morphology-based classifications and modern DNA (mainly chloroplast) sequence data-based classifications of <b>vascular</b> <b>plants...</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Vascular</b> <b>plants</b> are {{characterized}} {{as a group of}} plants, which are already fully adapted to live on the land. Their evolution is a result of a set of adaptations that have required the necessary changes at anatomical and morphological level. Some evidences about the rise of <b>vascular</b> <b>plants</b> appear in the fossil record from the Middle Ordovician in the form of spores and later also from the Early Silurian in the form of megafossils. The aim of the thesis is to briefly describe and discuss the most important published findings of fossils, especially megafossils, of the early <b>vascular</b> <b>plants</b> from the Silurian. Interest is especially focused on published material from the Czech Republic. The thesis also includes more detailed description of the genus Cooksonia, representing the first <b>vascular</b> <b>plants,</b> which are discovered in the megafossil record. Key words: <b>vascular</b> <b>plants,</b> spores, megafossils, Siluria...|$|R
5|$|As birds began nesting on the island, soil {{conditions}} improved, and more <b>vascular</b> <b>plant</b> species {{were able to}} survive. In 1998, the first bush {{was found on the}} island—a tea-leaved willow (Salix phylicifolia), which can grow to heights of up to 4metres (13ft). By 2008, 69species of plant had been found on Surtsey, of which about 30 had become established. This compares to the approximately 490 species found on mainland Iceland. More species continue to arrive, at a typical rate of roughly 2–5new species per year.|$|E
5|$|Plant recolonization and {{succession}} {{has occurred}} in Glacier Bay {{as a result of}} the retreat of the glacier bay in the last about 300 years. The succession, which occurred in the new wilderness of Glacier Bay was stated to be a raw landscape. A simile given is that “It was like seeing an owl with no feathers”. A vegetative wilderness has been created, which has resulted in the coastal forest. 333 <b>Vascular</b> <b>plant</b> species of individual taxa have been recorded in the Glacier Bay. Dense thickets of Sitka alder and devil's club abound along the shoreline.|$|E
5|$|Southlake Moor {{is another}} SSSI, which forms {{part of an}} {{extensive}} grazing marsh and ditch system. When conditions in the River Parrett are suitable, the moor can be deliberately flooded in winter by opening a sluice in the river's floodbank. Some 96species of aquatic and bankside <b>vascular</b> <b>plant</b> species have been recorded on Southlake Moor, including the greater water-parsnip (Sium latifolium). When the moor is flooded it can be occupied by large numbers of wildfowl; up to 22,000 wigeon (Anas penelope), 250Bewick's swan (Cygnus bewickii) and good numbers of pochard (Aythya ferina), teal (Anas crecca) and tufted duck (Aythya fuligula). Signs of European otters (Lutra lutra) are regularly seen on the muddy banks of the River Parrett. The ditches {{on the east side}} of the site are populated by palmate newts (Triturus helveticus).|$|E
2500|$|... 1184 {{species of}} wild <b>vascular</b> <b>plants</b> are {{recorded}} in the isthmus. See also the List of the <b>vascular</b> <b>plants</b> of the Karelian Isthmus. Red squirrel, moose, red fox, mountain hare and boar (reintroduced) are typical inhabitants of the forests.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Vascular</b> <b>plants</b> have <b>vascular</b> tissues which {{distribute}} resources {{through the}} plant. This feature allows <b>vascular</b> <b>plants</b> to evolve {{to a larger}} size than non-vascular plants, which lack these specialized conducting tissues and are therefore restricted to relatively small sizes.|$|R
40|$|A {{permanent}} {{plot was}} established in 1997 to monitor vegetation development in a recently abandoned coal mine in Ny-_lesund, Svalbard. A 1 mx 1 m quadrat was set up and further divided into one hundred small 10 cmx 10 cm cells. All the <b>vascular</b> <b>plants</b> occurring in the plot were recorded {{for each of the}} 100 cells. In 1999, the plot was revisited and examined for occurrences of <b>vascular</b> <b>plants.</b> Further, in 2002, the plot was re-surveyed and all the <b>vascular</b> <b>plants</b> were measured for their coverage. Data were compared and coverage change {{over the past three years}} was detected. <b>Vascular</b> <b>plants</b> significantly increased, indicating that the vegetation succession is currently in progress...|$|R
5|$|Species {{boundaries}} in plants may be weaker than in animals, and cross species hybrids are often possible. A familiar example is peppermint, Mentha × piperita, a sterile hybrid between Mentha aquatica and spearmint, Mentha spicata. The many cultivated varieties of wheat {{are the result}} of multiple inter- and intra-specific crosses between wild species and their hybrids. Angiosperms with monoecious flowers often have self-incompatibility mechanisms that operate between the pollen and stigma so that the pollen either fails to reach the stigma or fails to germinate and produce male gametes. This is one of several methods used by plants to promote outcrossing. In many land plants the male and female gametes are produced by separate individuals. These species are said to be dioecious when referring to <b>vascular</b> <b>plant</b> sporophytes and dioicous when referring to bryophyte gametophytes.|$|E
5|$|At Horseshoe Bend, Shirehampton {{the wooded}} cliff and a narrow salt marsh are {{supported}} by rocks of Devonian sandstone and Carboniferous limestone, overlain by with Triassic Dolomitic conglomerate. The site's principal interest {{and the reason for}} its designation as an SSSI is the presence of a population of the True Service-tree (Sorbus domestica) growing on the cliffs. This tree is nationally rare in Britain, and this site hosts the largest known population in England. Other notable species of Sorbus here are the whitebeams Sorbus eminens and Sorbus anglica, both of which are also nationally rare in Britain. The nationally scarce Large-leaved Lime (Tilia platyphyllos) also occurs, and herbs include Field garlic (Allium oleraceum) and Pale St. John's-wort (Hypericum montanum). The saltmarsh vegetation, which lies {{at the base of the}} cliff, is predominantly made up of Sea Aster (Aster tripolium) and English Scurvygrass (Cochlearia anglica). There are however two nationally scarce <b>vascular</b> <b>plant</b> species here as well– Slender Hare's-ear (Bupleurum tenuissimum) and Long-stalked Orache (Atriplex longipes).|$|E
5|$|The path leaves Ilfracombe through The Torrs {{and follows}} the cliff top past several small bays {{including}} Lee Bay before passing Bull Point and the Bull Point Lighthouse, into Rackham Bay. It then rounds Morte Point, passing the nearby village of Mortehoe before turning south {{to enter the}} long sandy Morte Bay which includes Woolacombe and Putsborough. Baggy Point divides Morte Bay from Croyde Bay, and the surfing mecca of Croyde and then the much larger Barnstaple or Bideford Bay, which forms part of the North Devon Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The wide expanse of Saunton Sands, which {{takes its name from}} Saunton, merges into the Braunton Burrows Site of Special Scientific Interest), the largest sand dune system (psammosere) in England and a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. It is particularly important ecologically because it includes the complete successional range of dune plant communities, with over 400 <b>vascular</b> <b>plant</b> species. The short turf communities are very rich in lichens and herbs, and the dune slacks are also rich. The many rare plants and animals include 14 with UK Biodiversity Action Plans.|$|E
5000|$|The Kubitzki {{system is}} a system of plant {{taxonomy}} devised by Klaus Kubitzki, and {{is the product of}} an ongoing survey of <b>vascular</b> <b>plants,</b> entitled The Families and Genera of <b>Vascular</b> <b>Plants,</b> and extending to 13 volumes in 2015. The survey, {{in the form of an}} encyclopedia, is important as a comprehensive, multivolume treatment of the <b>vascular</b> <b>plants,</b> with keys to and descriptions of all families and genera, mostly by specialists in those groups. The Kubitzki system served as the basis for classification in Mabberley's Plant-Book, a dictionary of the <b>vascular</b> <b>plants.</b> Mabberley states, in his Introduction on page xi of the 2008 edition, that the Kubitzki system [...] "has remained the standard to which other literature is compared".|$|R

25|$|It {{has been}} said that it is quicker to list the plants that do not form endomycorrhizae than those that do. This {{symbiosis}} is a highly evolved mutualistic relationship found between fungi and plants, the most prevalent plant symbiosis known, and AMF is found in 80% of <b>vascular</b> <b>plant</b> families in existence today.|$|E
50|$|If this {{phylogeny}} proves correct, {{then the}} complex sporophyte of living <b>vascular</b> <b>plants</b> might have evolved {{independently of the}} simpler unbranched sporophyte present in bryophytes. Other studies suggest a monophyletic group comprising liverworts and mosses, with hornworts being sister to <b>vascular</b> <b>plants.</b>|$|R

25|$|In a <b>vascular</b> <b>plant,</b> the stele is {{the central}} part of the root or stem {{containing}} the tissues derived from the procambium. These include vascular tissue, in some cases ground tissue (pith) and a pericycle, which, if present, defines the outermost boundary of the stele. Outside the stele lies the endodermis, which is the innermost cell layer of the cortex.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} the stele was {{developed}} in the late 19th century by French botanists P. E. L. van Tieghem and H.
