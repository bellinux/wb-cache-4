Moreover, the amplitude of upwellings decreases during the descent of the F layer, {{for the same reason that}} it increases during the PSSR.

40|$|The {{region of}} the {{ionosphere}} situated above the E layer peak and below the F layer is difficult to investigate using conventional ground based techniques, consequently our knowledge of this region is limited. An attempt {{has been made in}} this study to construct representative electron density distributions from a consideration of the fine structure observed on ionospheric sounding records and of the variation of the absorption and <b>virtual</b> <b>height</b> of a fixed frequency during the growth of the ionosphere below 200 km following the sunrise. Special reference was made to the results obtained for frequencies reflected near the E layer peak and the validity of this analysis in this region of high deviative absorption and group retardation is discussed. Attention is drawn to the large variation in published values of the collisional frequency above 120 km and an attempt has been made to construct a suitable height variation of this parameter for use in the calculation of absorption. Routine ionospheric soundings were made hourly over an extended period and augmented with continuous soundings on a number of selected days between February and June 1969. Also on 42 days during this period, measurements of absorption and <b>virtual</b> <b>height</b> were carried out on a fixed frequency for several hours following the sunrise. The variations of absorption with time and <b>virtual</b> <b>height</b> with time and frequency were computed from the electron density profiles obtained from 3 independent sources (a) Theoretical post sunrise profiles constructed by Bourne, Setty and Smith. (b) Monotonic profiles computed from Leicester Ionograms (c) Profiles observed by a Thomson Scatter technique at R. R. E. Malvern. The results of these calculations are compared directly with the experimental observations and computations of the variation of absorption with frequency are also discussed. From a synoptic study of the cusp features observed on ionospheric soundings it is found that complex cusp structure around f E is a regular phenomenon at Leicester occurring throughout the day but showing some decrease in occurrence frequency towards noon. The development of this structure can be represented by an expression of the form fcusp = A cosn x where different cusp features take differing values of the constant A. The comparisons made in this study indicate that the polynomial reduction technique produces monotonic electron density profiles which satisfactorily represent conditions when only the <b>virtual</b> <b>height</b> is considered but are not capable of producing calculated absorption values to the same degree of accuracy. The <b>virtual</b> <b>height</b> and absorption values computed from the Thomson Scatter profiles are in good agreement with experimental observations of these parameters at Leicester. These profiles are therefore considered to accurately represent the structure of the electron density distribution. The existence of the small undulations, as evident in these profiles, is shown to account for the multi-cusp phenomenon and various observations concerning the variability and extent of such structures are described. In addition, these comparisons have indicated some inadequacy in the growth theory employed in the derivation of the Bourne, Setty and Smith profiles. As a result of comparing the variation with frequency of both the <b>virtual</b> <b>height</b> and absorption it has been shown experimentally and supported theoretically that indicating that absorption especially in the deviative region may be a more sensitive parameter to profile fine structure. It is anticipated therefore that sweep frequency absorption sounding may indicate more clearly short term perturbations in the electron density profile. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) ...|$|E

We show that "fresh'' (ESF) day-to-day variability is closely related with the postsunset height rise due to the electric field PRE, and there is some indication that the altitude of 300 km may be a threshold height for the generation of fresh ESF. Observations of F layer <b>virtual</b> <b>heights</b> during evening hours (1800 LT, 1900 LT, and 2000 LT) present a strong day-to-day variability, even during geomagnetically quiet periods. In fact, this well-organized variability is induced by TPWIDs-type oscillations that push the F layer up or down according to the TPWID phase. The preliminary analysis presented here show that, when the planetary TPWID oscillations or geomagnetic activity raises the F layer around sunset hours, the occurrence of fresh ESF is increased, but when the TPWID-type oscillations or geomagnetic activity pushes the F layer downward, the fresh ESF occurrence is reduced. Also, the TPWID phase modulated the onset time of the fresh ESF during high fresh ESF season. The modulation acts in such way that, when the TPWID phase maximizes, the fresh ESF onset time occurs earlier than when the TPWID phase minimizes and the fresh ESF onset time occurs later...|$|R
40|$|From Introduction, p. 2] The {{first chapter}} of this thesis deals with an {{analysis}} of F 2 critical frequency data first for SANAE and then for eleven other Antarctic and sub-Antarctic stations covering the period 1957 to 1969. This shows {{certain aspects of the}} F 2 behaviour. Some of the results of this chapter have been reported in a paper by Gledhill and Williams. The two most important mechanisms thought to be responsible for the Antarctic f₀F 2 behaviour are incoming corpuscular radiation and horizontal neutral winds. These two mechanisms together with two others (the temperature theory of Torr and Torr and the semi-annual variation of neutral atmospheric density) are discussed in detail in part 2 (Chapters 2 to 4) with a view to discovering which aspects of the f₀F 2 behaviour over Antarctica can be explained by each theory. An attempt is made in Part 3 (Chapters 5 and 6) to explain the observed behaviour by solving the continuity equation of the ionosphere for high-latitude stations. Finally, besides the critical frequency, another parameter of importance in explaining the behaviour in the F 2 region is the height at which the F 2 maximum occurs.

Seasonal variation shows that only foF 2 exhibits annual, winter and semiannual anomaly. foF 2 seasonal variation has permitted us to identify and characterize solar events effects on F 2 layer in this area. In fact (1) during quiet geomagnetic condition foF 2 presents winter and semiannual anomalies asymmetric peaks in March/April and October. (2) The absence of winter anomaly {{and the presence of}} equinoctial peaks are the most visible effects of fluctuating activity in foF 2 seasonal time profiles.
