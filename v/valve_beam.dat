In the present test setup, molecular oxygen under several atmospheres of pressure is introduced into an evacuated supersonic expansion nozzle through a pulsed molecular <b>beam</b> <b>valve.</b> A 10 J CO 2 TEA laser is focused to intensities greater than 10 to the 9 th W/sq cm in the nozzle throat, generating a laser-induced breakdown with a resulting 20, 000 -K plasma.

40|$|A pulsed high-flux {{source of}} nearly {{monoenergetic}} atomic oxygen {{was developed to}} perform accelerated erosion testing of spacecraft materials in a simulated low-earth orbit (LEO) environment. Molecular oxygen is introduced into an evacuated conical expansion nozzle at several atmospheres pressure through a pulsed molecular <b>beam</b> <b>valve.</b> A laser-induced breakdown is generated in the nozzle throat by a pulsed CO 2 TEA laser.

40|$|Diamond growth using {{halogenated}} precursors was {{studied in}} several diamond growth reactors. In a conventionao plasma reactor, diamond growth {{using the following}} gas mixtures was studied: CF{sub 4 }/H{sub 2 }, CH{sub 4 }/H{sub 2 }, CH{sub 3 }F/H{sub 2 }, and CH{sub 3 }CL/H{sub 2 }. Both the diamond growth measurements demonstrated ineffective transport of halogen radicals to the diamond surface during the growth process. In order to transport radical halogen species to the diamond surface during growth, a flow-tube reactor was constructed which minimized gas phase reactions. Also, the flow-tube reactor enabled pulsed gs transport to the diamond surface by fast-acting <b>valves.</b> Molecular <b>beam</b> mass spectroscopy was used to find condition which resulted in atomic hydrogen and/or atomic fluorine transport to the growing diamond surface. Although such conditions were found, they required very low pressures (0. 5 Torr and below); these low pressures produce radical fluxes which are too low to sustain a reasonable diamond growth rate. The sequential reactor at Stanford was modified to add a halogen-growth step to the conventinoal atomic hydrogen/atomic carbon diamond growth cycle. Since the atomic fluorine, hydrogen and carbon environments are independent in the sequential reactor, the effect of fluorine on diamond growth could be studied independently of gas phase reactions. Although the diamond growth rate was increased {{by the use of}} fluorine, the film quality was seen to deteriorate as well as the substrate surface. Moreover, materials incompatibilities with fluorine significantly limited the use of fluorine in this reactor. A diamond growth model incorporating both gas phase and surface reactions was developed for the halocarbon system concurrent with the film growth efforts. In this report, we review the results of the growth experiments, the modeling, and additional experiments done to understand fluorine with diamond surfaces...|$|R

Molecular oxygen at several atmospheres pressure is introduced into an evacuated supersonic expansion nozzle through a pulsed molecular <b>beam</b> <b>valve.</b> An 18 J pulsed CO 2 TEA laser is focused to intensities greater than 10 (9) W/sq cm in the nozzle throat {{to generate a}} laser-induced breakdown.

40|$|Abstract-A device {{capable of}} {{continuously}} sampling and mass analyzing aerosols in the l- 10 nm diameter size range (masses up to 1 MDa) at part per billion (ppb, 10 ” cmm 3) concentrations is described. Small aliquots of an aerosol flowing at atmospheric pressure are sampled into a time-offlight mass spectrometer (TOFMS) via a pulsed molecular <b>beam</b> <b>valve</b> at 10 - 50 Hz. The aerosol molecular beam is singly and nondestructively ionized with light from an ultraviolet excimer laser and accelerated across a 20 kV electrostatic field. Ionized particle packets are separated in mass during a free flight and re-accelerated across an additional 30 kV into {{a stainless steel}} conversion dynode plate. Signals from ejected electrons and negative ion fragments resulting from the particle-dynode collisions are amplified in a dual microchannel plate detector, digitized, and stored in a fast transient recorder. Sampling of He flow streams bearing benzene, fullerenes, as well as Na. Mg, and CsI particles (nanocrystals) is demonstrated.

30|$|This {{apparently}} surprising {{result can}} be explained by the opening mechanisms of both valves, and the operation principles of the Stark decelerator. The NPV is activated using only small voltages, and a moderate power of about 1 W is dissipated in the valve. This results in only a modest change of the beam’s mean speed during the opening of the <b>valve,</b> i.e., the <b>beam</b> that is formed when the valve just opens is about the same as the mean speed that is found at later times. This behavior is very different for the JV. Here, large currents are needed to open the valve, resulting in significant power dissipation (about 20 W) and a hot valve body. Moreover, as the valve opens, gas flows through the hot current conductors, locally cooling the conductors. As a result, the mean speed of the beam shows a strong gradient during the valve opening time [42]. When the valve just opens, the beam is very fast. The later the molecules leave the valve, the lower their mean speed will be. The slowest mean speeds are found when the valve is almost fully closed. Here, beam speeds that are expected for room temperature expansions are found [42].|$|R
40|$|The ERL Vacuum {{systems are}} {{depicted}} in a figure. ERL has eight vacuum volumes with various sets of requirements. A summary of vacuum related requirements {{is provided in}} a table. Five of the eight volumes comprise the electron beamline. They are the 5 -cell Superconducting RF Cavity, Superconducting e-gun, injection, loop and beam dump. Two vacuum regions are the individual cryostats insulating the 5 -cell Superconducting RF Cavity and the Superconducting e-gun structures. The last ERL vacuum volume not shown in the schematic is the laser transport line. The beamline vacuum regions are separated by electropneumatic gate <b>valves.</b> The <b>beam</b> dump is common with loop beamline but is considered a separate volume due to geometry and requirements. Vacuum in the 5 -cell SRF cavity is maintained in the {approx} 10 {sup - 9 } torr range at room temperature by two 20 l/s ion pumps and in the e-gun SRF cavity by one 60 l/s ion pump. Vacuum in the SRF cavities operated at 2 {sup o}K is reduced to low 10 {sup - 11 } torr via cryopumping of the cavity walls. The cathode of the e-gun must be protected from poisoning, which can occur if vacuum adjacent to the e-gun in the injection line exceeds 10 - 11 torr range in the injection warm beamline near the e-gun exit. The vacuum requirements for beam operation in the loop and beam dump are 10 - 9 torr range. The beamlines are evacuated from atmospheric pressure to high vacuum level with a particulate free, oil free turbomolecular pumping cart. 25 l/s shielded ion pumps distributed throughout the beamlines maintain the vacuum requirement. Due to the more demanding vacuum requirement of the injection beamline proximate to the e-gun, a vacuum bakeout of the injection beamline is required. In addition, two 200 l/s diode ion pumps and supplemental pumping provided by titanium sublimation pumps are installed in the injection line just beyond the exit of the e-gun. Due to expected gas load a similar pumping arrangement is planned for the beam dump. The cryostat vacuum thermally insulating the SRF cavities need only reduce the convective heat load such that heat loss is primarily radiation through several layers of multi-layer insulation and conductive end-losses which are contained by 5 {sup o}K thermal transitions. Prior to cool down rough vacuum {approx} 10 {sup - 5 } torr range is established and maintained by a dedicated turbomolecular pump station. Cryopumping by the cold mass and heat shields reduces the insulating vacuum to 10 {sup - 7 } torr range after cool down...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{demonstrates}} {{the feasibility of}} producing the ï¬rst cold source of halogen atoms, using Br atoms as the focus. Br atoms are produced by photodissociation of Br 2, and detected by (2 + 1) REMPI and time-of-ï¬ight measurements. Ground- and excited-state Br fragments are formed with a recoil velocity directed along the molecular beam axis. The excess energy from the dissociation laser provides the backscattered Br fragments with suï¬cient recoil velocity to match and cancel out the average velocity of the molecular beam. The Br fragments which undergo suï¬cient velocity cancellation remain in the laser detection volume for up to 5 ms. A magnetic trap, composed of two permanent bar magnets with their North poles facing each other, is placed around the detection volume and with an axis perpendicular to the molecular beam and laser axes. The centres of the trap and of the laser interaction volume are overlapped. The magnetic ï¬eld is linear near {{the centre of the}} trap and forms a 3 -dimensional well with a depth of 0. 22 T, equivalent to a trap depth of U 0 /k B = 255 mK, with the upper and lower standard error [215, 325] mK, for ground-state Br. With this conï¬guration, Br atoms have been detected up to delays of 99 ms, to the next laser pulse, suggesting the possibility of accumulating density over successive molecular beam cycles. The decay of Br atoms from the trap is measured, and a Monte Carlo Markov Chain method is implemented to extract the intensity of the Br signal, which decreases to be on the order of the background noise at delays close to 99 ms. Monte-Carlo simulations demonstrate that the trap loss mechanisms are primarily due to collisions with the molecular beam and background gas, inhibiting the ability to accumulate trap density. These simulations also show that Majorana transitions to higher quantum states are minimal and can be ignored. Experimental measurements conï¬rm that near the peak of the molecular beam, when the strongest signal of Br is observed at long delays, around 60 % of initially trapped Br atoms are lost due to molecular beam collisions, and (34 ± 3) % due to collisions with the background gas. To minimise molecular beam collisions, a chopper construct is designed to reduce the beam pulse width and is placed between the molecular <b>beam</b> <b>valve</b> and detection volume. The chopper runs from 3, 000 rpm to 80, 000 rpm, during which the duration of the molecular beam at the detection volume is shortened from 130 μs (measured at the full width at half maximum) to between 80 μs and 13 μs, respectively. However, the chopper signiï¬cantly reduces the initial Br 2 density in the trapping region, and the inï¬uence of the chopper construct in reducing molecular beam collisions requires further experimental work. Further work is also necessary to improve the operational components, such as reducing the base pressure in the detection chamber to lower background gas collisions, or using a heavier carrier gas to increase density of initially trapped Br atoms. These improvements can lead us closer toward building density of cold Br atoms in the trap over successive molecular beam cycles, with which a source of cold, dense halogen atoms can be realised. </p...|$|R
