5|$|Four orthopoxviruses cause {{infection}} in humans: variola, vaccinia, cowpox, and monkeypox. Variola <b>virus</b> <b>infects</b> only humans in nature, although primates {{and other animals}} have been infected in a laboratory setting. Vaccinia, cowpox, and monkeypox viruses can infect both humans and other animals in nature.|$|E
5|$|When a <b>virus</b> <b>infects</b> a cell, {{the virus}} forces {{it to make}} {{thousands}} more viruses. It does this by making the cell copy the virus's DNA or RNA, making viral proteins, which all assemble to form new virus particles.|$|E
5|$|The term {{viral tropism}} {{refers to the}} cell types a <b>virus</b> <b>infects.</b> HIV can infect a variety of immune cells such as CD4+ T cells, macrophages, and microglial cells. HIV-1 entry to macrophages and CD4+ T cells is {{mediated}} through interaction of the virion envelope glycoproteins (gp120) with the CD4 molecule on the target cells and also with chemokine coreceptors.|$|E
40|$|Differences in the {{relative}} abundance of dinucleotides, if any may provide important clues on host-driven evolution of viruses. We studied dinucleotide frequencies of large DNA <b>viruses</b> <b>infecting</b> vertebrates (n = 105; <b>viruses</b> <b>infecting</b> mammals = 99; <b>viruses</b> <b>infecting</b> aves = 6; <b>viruses</b> <b>infecting</b> reptiles = 1) and invertebrates (n = 88; <b>viruses</b> <b>infecting</b> insects = 84; <b>viruses</b> <b>infecting</b> crustaceans = 4). We have identified systematic depletion of CpT(ApG) dinucleotides and over-representation of CpG dinucleotides as the unique genomic signature of large DNA <b>viruses</b> <b>infecting</b> invertebrates. Detailed investigation of this unique genomic signature suggests the existence of invertebrate host-induced pressures specifically targeting CpT(ApG) and CpG dinucleotides. The depletion of CpT dinucleotides among large DNA <b>viruses</b> <b>infecting</b> invertebrates is at least in part, explained by non-canonical DNA methylation by the infected host. Our findings highlight the role of invertebrate host-related factors in shaping virus evolution and they also provide the necessary framework {{for future studies on}} evolution, epigenetics and molecular biology of <b>viruses</b> <b>infecting</b> this group of hosts...|$|R
50|$|Animal viruses are <b>viruses</b> that <b>infect</b> animals. <b>Viruses</b> <b>infect</b> all {{cellular}} {{life and}} although <b>viruses</b> <b>infect</b> every animal, plant and protist species, each {{has their own}} specific range of <b>viruses</b> that often <b>infect</b> only that species.|$|R
50|$|It {{seems likely}} that the tailed <b>viruses</b> <b>infecting</b> the archaea are also related to the tailed <b>viruses</b> <b>infecting</b> bacteria.|$|R
5|$|RNA {{interference}} is {{an important}} innate defence against viruses. Many viruses have a replication strategy that involves double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). When such a <b>virus</b> <b>infects</b> a cell, it releases its RNA molecule or molecules, which immediately bind to a protein complex called a dicer that cuts the RNA into smaller pieces. A biochemical pathway â€“ the RISC complex, is activated, which ensures cell survival by degrading the viral mRNA. Rotaviruses have evolved to avoid this defence mechanism by not uncoating fully inside the cell, and releasing newly produced mRNA through pores in the particle's inner capsid. Their genomic dsRNA remains protected inside {{the core of the}} virion.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the virtual}} {{intelligence}} {{is kept in}} lockdown in another research station, Archers tells Shepard that he/she needs to manually override security from two other facilities {{to gain access to}} it and shut it down. Once the station where the virtual intelligence is contained has been unlocked, Shepards proceeds to the main server room. Shepard eventually accesses a terminal to cut all access to the outside world, but in the process the <b>virus</b> <b>infects</b> Shepard's cybernetic implants. Shepard awakens in a virtual reality, and heads to the central core room, where he finds that Archer had experimented on David in an attempt to control the geth. Shepard manages to defeat the virtual intelligence as it attempts to establish an upload link to the Normandy. Afterwards, David is shown in the core tied up to tubes in his arms and mouth, begging for help. Archer comes and argues for Shepard to keep the experiment going. Shepard is then given the option to either take David to a specialized academy or leave him at the station with his brother.|$|E
5|$|Virotherapy {{involves}} the use of genetically modified viruses to treat diseases. Viruses have been modified by scientists to reproduce in cancer cells and destroy them but not infect healthy cells. Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC), for example, is a modified herpes simplex virus that has had a gene, which is required for viruses to replicate in healthy cells, deleted and replaced with a human gene (GM-CSF) that stimulates immunity. When this <b>virus</b> <b>infects</b> cancer cells, it destroys them and in doing so the presence the GM-CSF gene attracts dendritic cells from the surrounding tissues of the body. The dendritic cells process the dead cancer cells and present components of them to other cells of the immune system. Having completed successful clinical trials, this virus is expected to gain approval for the treatment of a skin cancer called melanoma in late 2015. Viruses that have been reprogrammed to kill cancer cells are called oncolytic viruses.|$|E

25|$|Recent {{findings}} suggest that, as the <b>virus</b> <b>infects</b> human cells, host homeostatic processes like autophagy and ER stress response, {{not to mention}} apoptosis, are triggered depending on the infected cell type. The activation of autophagy and ER stress during infection enhances virus reproduction.|$|E
500|$|HSV {{infection}} causes several distinct medical disorders. [...] Common {{infection of}} the skin or mucosa may affect the face and mouth (orofacial herpes), genitalia (genital herpes), or hands (herpetic whitlow). [...] More serious disorders occur when the <b>virus</b> <b>infects</b> and damages the eye (herpes keratitis), or invades the central nervous system, damaging the brain (herpes encephalitis). [...] People with immature or suppressed immune systems, such as newborns, transplant recipients, or people with AIDS, [...] are prone to severe complications from HSV infections. HSV infection has also been associated with cognitive deficits of bipolar disorder, and Alzheimer's disease, although this is often dependent on the genetics of the infected person.|$|E
40|$|B virus (Macacine {{herpesvirus}} 1), a simplex virus endemic in macaques, causes encephalitis, encephalomyelitis, {{and death}} in 80 % of untreated zoonotically infected humans with delayed or no treatment. Here we report {{a significant difference in}} PI 3 K/Akt-dependent apoptosis between B <b>virus</b> <b>infected</b> human and macaque dermal fibroblasts. Our data show that B virus infection in either human or macaque fibroblasts results in activation of Akt via PI 3 K and this activation does not require viral de novo protein synthesis. Inhibition of PI 3 K with LY 294002 results in a significant reduction of viral titers in B <b>virus</b> <b>infected</b> macaque and human fibroblasts with only a modest difference in the reduction of virus titers between the two cell types. We, therefore, tested the hypothesis that B virus results in the phosphorylation of Akt (S 473), which prevents apoptosis, enhancing virus replication in B <b>virus</b> <b>infected</b> macaque dermal fibroblasts. We observed markers of intrinsic apoptosis when PI 3 K activation of Akt was inhibited in B <b>virus</b> <b>infected</b> macaque cells, while, these apoptotic markers were absent in B <b>virus</b> <b>infected</b> human fibroblasts under the same conditions. From these data we suggest that PI 3 K activates Akt in B <b>virus</b> <b>infected</b> macaque and human fibroblasts, but this enhances virus replication in macaque fibroblast cells by blocking apoptosis...|$|R

2500|$|Viral vectors {{proved to}} be more {{successful}} in transfecting cells as their life cycles require them to transfer their own genes to the host cells with high efficiency. A <b>virus</b> <b>infects</b> the human by inserting its gene directly into his cells. This can be deadly, but the brilliant idea is {{to take advantage of this}} natural ability. The idea is to remove all the dangerous genes in the virus and inject the healthy human genes.

40|$|Host-virus {{interaction}} via host cellular components {{has been}} an important field of research in recent times. RNA interference mediated by short interfering RNAs and microRNAs (miRNA), is a widespread anti-viral defence strategy. Importantly, viruses also encode their own miRNAs. In recent times miRNAs were identified as key players in host-virus interaction. Furthermore, viruses were shown to exploit the host miRNA networks to suite their own need. The complex cross-talk between host and viral miRNAs and their cellular and viral targets forms the environment for viral pathogenesis. Apart from protein-coding mRNAs, non-coding RNAs may also be targeted by host or viral miRNAs in <b>virus</b> <b>infected</b> cells, and <b>viruses</b> can exploit the host miRNA mediated gene regulatory network via the competing endogenous RNA effect. A recent report showed that viral U-rich non-coding RNAs called HSUR, expressed in primate virus herpesvirus saimiri (HVS) infected T cells, were able to bind to three host miRNAs, causing significant alteration in cellular level for one of the miRNAs. We have predicted protein coding and non protein-coding targets for viral and human miRNAs in <b>virus</b> <b>infected</b> cells. We identified viral miRNA targets within host non-coding RNA loci from AGO interacting regions in three different <b>virus</b> <b>infected</b> cells. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis of the genes comprising the ceRNA networks in the <b>virus</b> <b>infected</b> cells revealed enrichment of key cellular signalling pathways related to cell fate decisions and gene transcription, like Notch and Wnt signalling pathways, as well as pathways related to viral entry, replication and virulence. We identified a vast number of non-coding transcripts playing as potential ceRNAs to the immune response associated genes; e. g. APOBEC family genes, in some <b>virus</b> <b>infected</b> cells. All these information are compiled in HumanViCe, a comprehensive database that provides the potential ceRNA networks in <b>virus</b> <b>infected</b> human cells...|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} {{the interaction between}} an invertebrate iridescent virus (IIV) isolated from Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith) and the solitary ichneumonid endoparasitoid Eiphosoma vitticolle Cresson. In choice tests, parasitoids examined and stung significantly more <b>virus</b> <b>infected</b> than healthy larvae, apparently {{due to a lack}} of defense reaction in <b>virus</b> <b>infected</b> hosts. Parasitoid-mediated <b>virus</b> transmission was observed in 100 % of the female parasitoids that stung a <b>virus</b> <b>infected</b> host in the laboratory. Each female parasitoid transmitted the virus to an average (SE) of 3 : 7 0 : 3 larvae immediately after stinging an infected larva. Caged field experiments supported this result; virus transmission to healthy larvae only occurred in cages containing infected hosts (as inoc-ulum) and parasitoids (as vectors). The virus was highly detrimental to parasitoid development because of premature host death and lethal infection of the developing endoparasitoid. Female parasitoids that emerged from <b>virus</b> <b>infected</b> hosts did not transmit the virus to healthy hosts. We suggest that the polyphagous habits of many noctuid parasitoids combined with the catholic host range of most IIVs may represent a mechanism for the transmission of IIVs between different host species in the field...|$|R
