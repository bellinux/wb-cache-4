40|$|This paper {{presents}} an intertemporal portfolio selection model for pension funds that maximize the intertemporal expected {{utility of the}} surplus of assets net of liabilities. Following Merton (1973) {{it is assumed that}} both the asset and the liability return follow Itô processes as functions of a state variable. The optimum occurs for investors holding four funds: the market portfolio, the hedge portfolio for the state variable, the hedge portfolio for the liabilities, and the riskless asset. It is shown that pension funds should purchase hedging for liabilities. In contrast to Merton’s result in the assets only case, this hedge depends exclusively on the funding ratio of a specific pension fund and not on preferences. With HARA utility the investments in the state <b>variable</b> <b>hedge</b> portfolios are also preference independent. With log utility the market portfolio investment depends only on the current funding ratio. Key Words...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{this work}} we study anti-unification for unranked hedges, permit-ting context and <b>hedge</b> <b>variables.</b> <b>Hedges</b> are {{sequences}} of unranked terms. The anti-unification problem of two hedges s ̃ and q ̃ {{is concerned with}} finding their generalization, a hedge g ̃ such that both s ̃ and q ̃ are substitution instances of g̃. Second-order power is gained by using context variables to generalize vertical differences at the input <b>hedges.</b> <b>Hedge</b> <b>variables</b> are used to generalize horizontal differences. An anti-unification algorithm is presented, which computes a gener-alization of input hedges and records all the differences. The computed general-izations are least general among a certain class of generalizations. ...|$|R

30|$|In contrast, {{other studies}} (e.g., Belghitar et al. 2013; Graham and Rogers 2002; Knopf et al. 2002) propose a {{continuous}} <b>hedging</b> <b>variable</b> {{to measure the}} extent of hedging (e.g., the gross notional derivative value or the fair value of derivative contracts). However, studies using a <b>hedging</b> dummy <b>variable</b> routinely report the descriptive statistics for hedgers and non-hedgers or a mean difference test between both groups, consequently providing us with sufficient information to extract correlations. In contrast, studies examining a continuous <b>hedging</b> <b>variable</b> do usually not present this information. Moreover, the number of studies using a dummy instead of a continuous <b>hedging</b> <b>variable</b> is much higher, and therefore a meta-analysis based on these studies yields more reliable results.|$|R
40|$|The {{volatility}} term structure (VTS) reflects {{market expectations}} of asset volatility over different horizons. These expectations change over time, giving dynamic structure to the VTS. This paper evaluates volatility models {{on the basis}} of their performance in hedging option price changes due to shifts in the VTS. An innovative feature of the hedging approach is its increased sensitivity to several important forms of model misspecification relative to previous testing methods. Volatility hedge parameters are derived for several volatility models incorporating different predicted VTS dynamics and information <b>variables.</b> <b>Hedging</b> tests using S&P 500 index options indicate that the GARCH components with leverage VTS estimate is most accurate. Evidence is obtained for meanreversion in volatility and correlation between VTS shifts and S&P 500 returns. While a convexity hedge dominates the volatility hedges for the observed sample, this result appears to be due to sample selection bias. _________ [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{modelling}} of {{hedge funds}} poses a difficult problem since the available reported data sets are often small and incomplete. We propose a switching regression model for hedge funds, {{in which the}} coefficients are able to switch between different regimes. The coefficients are governed by a Markov chain in discrete time.

30|$|Due to {{the multidimensional}} {{behavior}} of the firm characteristics used as proxy <b>variables</b> for the <b>hedging</b> hypotheses, primary studies on corporate hedging usually test their hypotheses through multivariate analyses. These interrelations must be considered on a meta-level as well. Thus, in addition to p correlations between the <b>hedging</b> <b>variable</b> and each proxy variable, correlations among the proxy variables must also be incorporated in the aggregation. In the case that all proxy variables are investigated in each primary study, we extract p^* = p(p - 1)/ 2 correlations from each study of interest. As the variance of the raw correlations strongly depends on the correlation coefficient itself, all computations are performed in the variance-stabilizing Fisher’s z-scale and are later transferred back into the correlation metric for interpretation.|$|R

50|$|Basis {{for more}} refined models: The Black-Scholes model is robust {{in that it}} can be {{adjusted}} to deal with some of its failures.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the exchange rate exposure of UK nonfinancial companies from January 1981 to December 2001. Design/methodology/approach – The study employs different exchange rate measures and adopts an equally weighted exchange rate. The analyses are conducted at the firm level. All analyses are conducted by regressing the firm’s exchange rate exposure coefficients on its size, foreign activity <b>variables</b> and financial <b>hedging</b> proxies over the whole sample period. Findings – The findings show that a higher percentage of UK non-financial companies are exposed to exchange rate changes than those reported in previous studies. Generally, the results provide a stronger support for the suggested equally weighted rate as an economic variable, which affects firms’ stock returns. The results also show a high proportion of positive exposure coefficients among firms with significant exchange rate exposure, indicating a higher proportion of firms benefiting from an appreciation of the pound. Finally, the results also indicate evidence that firms’ foreign operations and <b>hedging</b> <b>variables</b> affect their sensitivity to exchange rate exposure. Practical implications – This study provides important implications for public policymakers who wish to understand links between policies that affect exchange rates and relative wealth effects. Originality/value – The empirical results of this study should help investors to examine how common stock returns react to exchange rate fluctuations when making financial decisions, and prove useful for financial managers when measuring exposure to foreign exchange rate changes...|$|R

40|$|Financial theory {{predicts that}} a change in an {{exchange}} rate should affect {{the value of a}} firm or an industry. To a large extent, past research has not supported this theory. which is surprising especially after considering the substantial exchange ratc fluctuations over the last three' decades. This study extends previous research on the foreign exchange rate exposure using a sample of 364 UK nonfinancial companies over the period from January 1981 to December 2001. The impact of the changes (realised and unexpected) in exchange rates on firms' or industries' stock returns is examined. In addition, the movements in bilateral, equally weighted and trade-weighted exchange rate indices arc considered. The findings indicate that a higher percentage ofUK firms and industries arc exposed to contemporaneous exchange rate changes than those reported in previous studies. UK firms' and industries' stock returns are more affected by changes in the ECU. EQW. US$ and JPY exchange rate, and less significantly to the basket of 20 countries' currencies relative to the British pound exchange rate. There is alsO evidence of significant lagged exchange rate exposure. This lagged exchange rate exposure is consistent with findings in previous studies that some market inefficiencies may exist in incorporating exchange rate changes into the returns of firms and industries. This also means that there is possible mispricing of the: exchange rate to firm value relationship by the market. This study also segregates firms and industries based on various variables that might affect their exchange rate exposure. These variables arc divided into two main groups: foreign involvement <b>variables</b> and <b>hedging</b> <b>variables.</b> The results indicate that the extent of firms' foreign activity has an impact on their exchange rate exposure. These findings imply that restructuring foreign operations can reduce firms' exchange rate exposure. The results also reveal that hedging policies are important detenninants of the exchange rate exposure. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|The validating {{roles of}} hedging and {{leverage}} as value-adding corporate strategies arise from their beneficial manipulation of deadweight market impositions such as taxes and financial distress costs. These roles {{may even be}} symbiotic in their value-adding effects, but they are antithetic in their effects on company risk. To investigate both the value and risk impacts of a joint hedging and leverage decision, this study utilises a multi-period model for a company subject to respectively hedgeable and unhedgeable production output price and quantity risk variables, endogenously derived deadweight costs, and the tandem availability of risky leverage and flexible <b>hedging</b> control <b>variables.</b> While <b>hedging</b> and leverage are clearly found to interact for net benefit to company value, there is no straightforward generalisation for the relative financial riskiness of an optimal joint hedging and leverage decision in comparison to an unhedged optimal leverage decision, an unlevered optimal hedge decision, or an unhedged and unlevered decision; the observed relative riskiness depends on the price level for production output, the company’s remaining production life, and the available hedging instruments.

40|$|Abstract. The {{rigorous}} {{specification of}} components {{is necessary to}} support their selection, adaptation, and integration in component-based software engineering techniques. The specification needs to include the functional and nonfunctional attributes. The non-functional part of the specification is particularly challenging, as these attributes are often described subjectively, such as Fast Performance or Low Memory. Here, we propose the use of infinite value logic, fuzzy logic, to formally specify components. A significant advantage of fuzzy logic is that it supports linguistic <b>variables,</b> or <b>hedges</b> (e. g., terms such as slow, fast, very fast, etc.), which are convenient for describing non-functional attributes. In this paper, a new systematic approach for the specification of components using fuzzy logic is presented. First, an empirical study is conducted to gather data on five components that provide data compression capabilities; each uses a different algorithm (Arithmetic Encoding, Huffman, Wavelet, Fractal, and Burrows-Wheeler Transform). Data on the response time performance, memory use, compression ratio, and {{root mean square error}} are collected by executing the components on a collection of 75 images with different file formats and sizes. The data are fuzzified and represented as membership functions. The fuzzy component specifications are ranked using a set of test queries. Fuzzy multicriteria decision making algorithms are going to be investigated for the selection of components in the next phase of the work. ...|$|R

The results indicate that hedging decision and volume are positively related to the company’s size, leverage and interest rate exposure.
