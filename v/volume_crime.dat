50|$|Criminal {{investigation}} commonly differentiates between major crime, e.g. {{murder and}} armed robbery, and <b>volume</b> <b>crime,</b> e.g. burglary and shop-lifting.

An experienced police officer working decades in burglaries is more likely to solve a burglary by combining the knowledge of previous cases.

As an expert system, REBES was designed to combine human expertise Punch (PUNCH) Paul Montana used [...] "REBES" [...] studied all his past burglaries in order to solve new burglary cases. Its aimed performance was to solve a burglary by entering the data of the crime scene into REBES so that the program would compare the found behavioral fingerprint with those behavioral fingerprints of known perpetrators as previously stored in the software. It then would provide the identity of the potential offender together with a probability factor. In case of several possibilities, the program would deliver a list of offenders, listed in the order of probability.|$|E

40|$|The {{preponderance}} of evidence is {{that the effect of}} policing upon <b>volume</b> <b>crime</b> rates is marginal, compared with the influence of socio-economic conditions. However, several focused policing styles have been brought into use since the early 1990 s with the explicit aim of reducing crime levels, usually by the concentration of efforts upon repeat offenders or repeat victimisation. Moreover, further studies suggest that policing and wider crime reduction efforts may be effective when designed to tackle local problems. This study aims to go some way towards the reconciliation of these viewpoints. It examines the notion that local effectiveness is dissipated, as the geographical unit of measurement of crime levels is widened.

40|$|<b>Volume</b> <b>crime</b> {{offences}} such {{as domestic}} burglary are commonly assessed for forensic opportunities {{by the first}} attending officer (FAO) who is present at the scene.

The current study explored whether there was a benefit of evidence recovery for attended as opposed to non-attended assessments. 500 TFMV offences provided by Northamptonshire Police (UK) were analysed from 14 th January 2010 to the 28 th February 2011; 250 attended forensic assessments and 250 non-attended assessments.

40|$|The Internet is a {{decentralized}} {{structure that}} offers speedy communication, has a global reach and provides anonymity, a characteristic invaluable for committing illegal activities. In {{parallel with the}} spread of the Internet, cybercrime has rapidly evolved from a relatively low <b>volume</b> <b>crime</b> to a common high <b>volume</b> <b>crime.</b> A typical example of such a crime is the spreading of spam emails, where the content of the email tries to entice the recipient to click a URL linking to a malicious Web site or downloading a malicious attachment. Analysts attempting to provide intelligence on spam activities quickly find that the volume of spam circulating daily is overwhelming; therefore, any intelligence gathered is representative of only a small sample, not of the global picture. While past studies have looked at automating some of these analyses using topic-based models, i. e. separating email clusters into groups with similar topics, our preliminary research investigates the usefulness of applying authorship-based models for this purpose. In the first phase, we clustered a set of spam emails using an authorship-based clustering algorithm. In the second phase, we analysed those clusters using a set of linguistic, structural and syntactic features. These analyses reveal that emails within each cluster were likely written by the same author, but that it is unlikely we have managed to group together all spam produced by each group. This problem of high purity with low recall, has been faced in past authorship research. While it is also a limitation of our research, the clusters themselves are still useful for the purposes of automating analysis, because they reduce the work needing to be performed. Our second phase revealed useful information on the group that can be utilized in future research for further analysis of such groups, for example, identifying further linkages behind spam campaigns. 10 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Amylase {{testing has}} been used as a {{presumptive}} test for crime scene saliva for over three decades, mainly to locate saliva stains on surfaces. We have developed a saliva screening application for crime scene trace swabs, utilising an amylase sensitive paper (Phadebas((R)) Forensic Press test). Positive results were obtained for all tested dried saliva stains (0. 5 - 32 muL) with high or intermediate amylase activity (840 and 290 kU/L). Results were typically obtained within 5 min, and all samples that produced DNA profiles were positive. However, salivary amylase activities, as well as DNA concentrations, vary significantly between individuals. We show that there is no correlation between amylase activity and amount of DNA in fresh saliva. Even so, a positive amylase result indicates presence of saliva, and thereby presence of DNA. Amylase testing may be useful for screening in investigations where the number of DNA analyses is limited due to cost, e. g., in <b>volume</b> <b>crime...</b>|$|E

In North America, Europe, and Australasia, many common crimes have fallen by half or more since the early 1990 s, albeit with variation in the specifics. Seventeen explanations are examined here including demographics, policing, imprisonment, drug markets, and lead poisoning. Pioneering research relevant only to the United States now appears, with the benefit of hindsight, somewhat parochial. Sixteen of the 17 hypotheses fail one or more of four evidence-based standardized tests on which they are assessed. The one that passes is the security hypothesis, underpinned by crime opportunity theories. Here there is strong evidence that vehicle theft fell because of more and better security, and mounting evidence that improved security was critical in reducing burglary and other acquisitive crime.

40|$|Literature Review: Expertise, {{decision}} making and situation awareness literature have allowed {{a better understanding of}} practitioner performance in Engineering, Healthcare and Sport. Discourse is thin in the domain of Crime Scene Examination, although Hierarchical Tasks Analysis, Distributed Cognition, Team Working and Perception have all received attention in recent years. The use of camera technology to uncover performance has also found footing in diverse professions, notably Firefighting and Social Work. Crime Scene Investigator practice is proposed as being a fertile area of study, to make apparent aspects of the work that are tacit, as well as to ascertain if performance metrics in the sector connect with the tacit knowledge expressed in the role. Methodology: This study explored the differences in searching strategies between expert and novice Crime Scene Examiners (n= 12) in a simulated environment, before discussing a longitudinal ethnographic examination of how <b>Volume</b> <b>Crime</b> Scene Investigators (n= 4) make sense of their practice. Eye-tracker and head-mounted camera technology was used to capture performance from an own point of view perceptive. Nvivo 9 was utilised to collate and code video data, field notes and interview transcriptions. Results & Discussion: Results from verbal protocol analysis and eye-tracker recordings indicate that expert examiners target fewer objects within the crime scene space however spend longer on the objects being viewed. Field study results report that <b>Volume</b> <b>Crime</b> Scene Investigators engage in sharing tacit knowledge, this impacted on their strategies or perception of obtaining forensic evidence. In addition the analysis of coded data from video and verbal protocol reports found that specific physical aspects of examination practice such as fingerprint powdering were aligned to {{decision making}} or analysis processes.

Furthermore examiners engaged in and highlighted aspects of their role they felt were important but were not captured in any metrics. Conclusion: It is proposed this new understanding will be of use to those in developing crime scene investigation practitioners as well as presenting related literature on how expertise in the domain can be recognised, elicited and developed in others. This work also sheds light on the value of sector standards for this field along with what is needed to make them more user- friendly for the developing practitioner...|$|E
