25|$|Bulletins {{received}} new {{titles and}} a new set design in May 2006, to allow for Breakfast {{to move into the}} main studio {{for the first time since}} 1997. The new set featured Barco <b>videowall</b> screens with a background of the London skyline used for main bulletins and originally an image of cirrus clouds against a blue sky for Breakfast. This was later replaced following viewer criticism. The studio bore similarities with the ITN-produced ITV News in 2004, though ITN uses a CSO Virtual studio rather than the actual screens at BBC News. Also, May saw the launch of World News Today the first domestic bulletin focused principally on international news.|$|E

50|$|The {{technology}} was unveiled in January 2010, and in June 2010, the first embodiment of this technology, the TD1 Tile, was launched. The TD1 tile is a 25-inch diagonal, bezel-free, tile-based building block. A variable number of TD1 Tiles {{can be arranged}} in arbitrary configurations to form <b>videowalls</b> in various sizes and shapes. Prysm began shipping TD1 tiles in February 2011.|$|R
40|$|A new {{processing}} {{scheme for}} large high-resolution displays such as <b>Videowalls</b> is proposed in this paper. The scheme consists in a deinterlacing, an interpolation and an optional enhancement algorithm; its hardware implementation requires a low computational cost. The deinterlacing algorithm is motion-adaptive. A simple hierarchical three-level motion detector provides indications of static, slow and fast motion to activate a temporal FIR filter, a three-tap vertico-temporal median operator and a spatial FIR filter respectively. This simple algorithm limits the hardware requirements to three field memories plus a very reduced number of algebraic operations per interpolated pixel. Usually linear {{techniques such as}} pixel repetition or the bilinear method are employed for image interpolation, which however either introduce artifacts (e. g. blocking effects) or tend to smooth edges. A higher quality rendition of the image is obtained by {{the concept of the}} Warped Distance among the pixels o [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Wall-sized {{interactive}} displays {{gain more}} and more attention as a valuable tool for multiuser applications, but typically require the adoption of projectors tiles. Projectors tend to display deformed images, due to lens distortion and/or imperfection, {{and because they are}} almost never perfectly aligned to the projection surface. Multi-projector <b>videowalls</b> are typically bounded to the video architecture and to the specific application to be displayed. This makes it harder to develop interactive applications, in which a fine grained control of the coordinate transformations (to and from user space and model space) is required. This paper presents a solution to such issues: implementing the blending functionalities at an application level allows seamless development of multi-display interactive applications with multi-touch capabilities. The description of the multi-touch interaction, guaranteed by an array of cameras on the baseline of the wall, {{is beyond the scope of}} this work which focuses on calibration...|$|R

5000|$|While {{the term}} [...] "digital sign" [...] has taken hold {{throughout}} most of the world, some companies and organizations prefer to use the terms [...] "narrowcasting", [...] "screen media", [...] "place-based media", [...] "digital merchandising", [...] "digital media networks", [...] "digital out-of-home" [...] or [...] "captive audience networks". The term Digital Signage was first coined in early 1992 when a network of videowalls in UK Shopping Centres run by Neil Longuet-Higgins of ProQuip and Centre Network Television was referred to as a digital sign by a security guard who did not understand the term <b>Videowall.</b> Neil Longuet-Higgins from SIS Digital was then the first to use this term to promote the nationwide network of 'Digital Signage'. The Out-of-Home Advertising Association of America (OAAA) defines digital billboards those that “offer static messages that rotate every few seconds with typically six to eight advertisers sharing the same location". Digital signage is evolving so rapidly that even the OAAA definition appears to be outmoded given that interactive digital signage and context-aware digital signage is anything but static.|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} Total Airport Management aims at harmonizing and {{optimizing}} the processes at an airport. For this purpose and {{to guarantee the}} acceptance of the airport operation plan from all stakeholders, it has been proposed to develop a control room in which stakeholders negotiate a quality of service contract and airport processes. This control room will, amongst others, be equipped with a large <b>videowall,</b> which should enable stakeholders yielding sound situation awareness. The paper at hand introduces an information representation for this <b>videowall,</b> which should support knowledge-based behaviour, and, thus, applies the Ecological Interface Design Guidelines. Therefor, it discusses how the Total Airport Management system’s functional purpose, abstract functions, generalized functions, physical processes, and physical form can be presented appropriately on the <b>videowall.</b> Herewith, this paper generalizes the Ecological Interface Design approach to airport management and provides a theory-based proposition of the videowall’s design...|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes an FPGA {{architecture}} for a <b>videowall</b> image processor. To {{create a}} <b>videowall,</b> {{a set of}} high-resolution displays is arranged in order to present a single large image or smaller multiple images. An image processor is needed to perform the appropriate format conversion corresponding to the required output configuration, and to properly enhance the image contrast. Input signals either in the interlaced or in the progressive format must be managed. The image processor we propose is integrated into two different blocks: the first one implements the deinterlacing task for a YCbCr input video signal, then it converts the progressive YCbCr to the RGB data format and performs the optional contrast enhancement; the other one performs the format conversion of the RGB data format. Motion-adaptive vertico-temporal deinterlacing {{is used for the}} luminance signal Y; the colour difference signals Cb and Cr instead are processed by means of line average deinterlacing. Image contrast e [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Most {{approaches}} to the visual perception of humans do not include high-level activity recognitition. This paper presents a system that fuses and interprets the outputs of several computer vision components as well as speech recognition to obtain a high-level understanding of the perceived scene. Our laboratory for investigating new ways of human-machine interaction and teamwork support, is equipped with an assemblage of cameras, some close-talking microphones, and a <b>videowall</b> as main interaction device. Here, we develop {{state of the art}} real-time computer vision systems to track and identify users, and estimate their visual focus of attention and gesture activity. We also monitor the users' speech activity in real time. This paper explains our approach to high-level activity recognition based on these perceptual components and a temporal logic engine...|$|E
40|$|Due to ever {{increasing}} challenges and complexity, {{there is a}} high demand for new human-machine interaction approaches in crisis response scenarios. In the framework of the five-year Fraunhofer internal project “Computer Vision for Human-Computer Interaction – Interaction in and with attentive rooms ” we aim at building a smart crisis control room, in which vision-based perception of users will be used to facilitate innovative user interfaces and to support teamwork. Our smart control room is equipped with several cameras and has a <b>videowall</b> as the main output and interaction device. Using real-time computer vision, we can track and identify the users in the room and estimate their head orientations and pointing gestures. In order to build a useful smart control room for crisis response, we are currently focusing on situation modeling for such rooms, and we are investigating the target crisis response scenarios. This paper gives an overview of the project, presents our ongoing work and discusses future work...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this demonstration, we {{will show}} the {{different}} modules related to the automatic surveillance prototype developed {{in the context of}} the EU VANAHEIM project. Several components will be demonstrated on real data from the Torino metro. First, different unsupervised activity modeling algorithms that capture recurrent activities from long recordings will be illustrated. A contrario, they provide unusuallness measures that can be used to select the most interesting streams to be displayed in control rooms. Second, different scene analysis algorithms will be demonstrated, ranging from left-luggage detection to the automatic identification of groups and their tracking. Third, a set of situationnal reporting methods (flow and count monitoring in escalators and at platforms as well as human presence at lift) that provide a global view of the activity in the metro station and are displayed on maps or along with analyzed video streams. Finally, an offline activity discovery tool based on long term recordings. All algorithms are integrated into a Video Management Solution using an innovative <b>VideoWall</b> module that will be demonstrated as well. ...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays in the {{audiovisual}} industry {{there are some}} solutions for deployments of video walls. There are those who only use video technology for deployment, {{there are others who}} have made a leap to IP technology. In many of these systems the first condition is to use a specific device such as a screen or a converter. The cost of these deployments is very expensive, especially for the specific of devices. There are products on the market with the same features that we propose in this thesis, although none of them allow a reusable environment, a low cost and a heterogeneous hardware level. Specifically, this thesis is focused in analyse, propose and develop an environment that use the IP protocol for the content's diffusion of content that we will reproduce in the screens. The main condition is not to use any specific hardware, achieving a deployment of an environment with a miscellany of equipment. The liveMediaStreamer framework will be used for transmission of the data streams. It will add a module of splitting in order to process the cuts and also the generation of new flows from a single one. We will find out solutions in order to achieve synchronicity between screens. A website platform will be made, capable of managing the whole environment. Having the liveMediaStreamer framework as a starting point, it has been simple to coupling the new module of splitting. A robust control web application for the <b>videowall</b> has been performed, which can allow the addition of some improvements in order to automate much more the platform. In order to achieve a stable and synchronous environment between different screens, many synchronization systems have been tested. A stable environment has been achieved thanks to forcing the playing time of all devices to the timestamp generated by the server for each frame and using the same receiver and the same software to reproduce the content...|$|E
