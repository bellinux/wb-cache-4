25|$|The {{most common}} {{symptoms}} {{of carbon monoxide}} poisoning may resemble other types of poisonings and infections, including symptoms such as headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fatigue, {{and a feeling of}} weakness.

25|$|A 1985 {{study by}} McLeod and Sitaram in humans {{reported}} that bufotenine administered intranasally at {{a dose of}} 1–16mg had no effect, other than intense local irritation. When given intravenously at low doses (2–4mg), bufotenine oxalate caused anxiety but no other effects; however, a dose of 8mg resulted in profound emotional and perceptual changes, involving extreme anxiety, a sense of imminent death, and <b>visual</b> <b>disturbance</b> associated with color reversal and distortion, and intense flushing of the cheeks and forehead.|$|E
500|$|Diagnosis {{of central}} nervous system oxygen {{toxicity}} in divers prior to seizure is difficult as the symptoms of <b>visual</b> <b>disturbance,</b> ear problems, dizziness, confusion and nausea can be due to many factors common to the underwater environment such as narcosis, congestion and coldness. However, these symptoms may be helpful in diagnosing the first stages of oxygen toxicity in patients undergoing hyperbaric oxygen therapy. In either case, {{unless there is a}} prior history of epilepsy or tests indicate hypoglycaemia, a seizure occurring in the setting of breathing oxygen at partial pressures greater than [...] suggests a diagnosis of oxygen toxicity.|$|E

500|$|Chronic {{poisoning}} usually presents {{with symptoms}} affecting multiple systems, but {{is associated with}} three main types of symptoms: gastrointestinal, neuromuscular, and neurological. Central nervous system and neuromuscular symptoms usually result from intense exposure, while gastrointestinal symptoms usually result from exposure over longer periods. Signs of chronic exposure include loss of short-term memory or concentration, depression, nausea, abdominal pain, loss of coordination, and numbness and tingling in the extremities. Fatigue, problems with sleep, headaches, stupor, slurred speech, and anemia are also found in chronic lead poisoning. A [...] "lead hue" [...] of the skin with pallor and/or lividity is another feature. A blue line along the gum with bluish black edging to the teeth, known as a Burton line, is another indication of chronic lead poisoning. Children with chronic poisoning may refuse to play or may have hyperkinetic or aggressive behavior disorders. <b>Visual</b> <b>disturbance</b> may present with gradually progressing blurred vision {{as a result of}} central scotoma, caused by toxic optic neuritis.|$|E
2500|$|Symptoms of HPNS include tremors, myoclonic jerking, somnolence, EEG changes, <b>visual</b> <b>disturbance,</b> nausea, dizziness, and {{decreased}} mental performance. HPNS has two components, one {{resulting from the}} speed of compression and the other from the absolute pressure. The compression effects may occur when descending below [...] at rates greater than a few metres per minute, but reduce {{within a few hours}} once the pressure has stabilised. The effects from depth become significant at depths exceeding [...] and remain regardless of the time spent at that depth. The susceptibility of divers to HPNS varies considerably depending on the individual, but has little variation between different dives by the same diver.|$|E
2500|$|Past {{research}} has linked macropsia to migraine. One {{of these studies}} was conducted on Japanese adolescents who reported visual episodic illusions with macropsia and showed that illusions are {{three times more likely}} to occur in association with migraine. The illusions were most prevalent among girls between the ages of 16 and 18. It is unlikely that macropsia in Japanese adolescents could be due to epileptic seizure since only [...]3% of Japanese adolescents have epilepsy. No evidence of drugs was found, which eliminates the possibility of the macropsia in the adolescents being drug-induced. It is also unlikely for macropsia in adolescent children to be associated with a serious disease. It is usually the macropsia or other <b>visual</b> <b>disturbance</b> which precedes the painful migrainous headaches. The episodes of macropsia can occur as part of the aura in a migraine. These episodes are often brief, lasting only a few minutes. Adolescents who are deemed to have multiple distortions per episode, such as slow motion vision and macropsia, are even more likely to be sufferers of migraine. The macropsia episodes associated with migraine are typically equivalent to the duration of the aura, which can range from moments to 15 minutes. Non-migrainous headaches are not known to be associated with episodic illusions. Even in the absence of a migraine, a fever or a hypnagocic state can provoke visual illusions, which one might claim to be macropsia. A person with macropsia may fail to see the connection between the migraine and the macropsia, since the conditions may not elicit symptoms at the same time. The pathophysiology of the condition is not fully understood, but the timing of some episodic occurrences with the headaches suggests that there is a connection between macropsia and the vasoconstrictive phase of a migraine. The differences in visual phenomena, such as macropsia with slow motion versus macropsia without slow motion, may result from different areas of the brain being affected by migraine.|$|E
