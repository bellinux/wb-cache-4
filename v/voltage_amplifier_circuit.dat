40|$|Abstract- Sense {{amplifiers}} {{are one of}} {{the very}} important peripheral components of CMOS memories. In a Hybrid Sense amplifier both current and voltage sensing techniques are used which makes it a better selection than a conventional current or <b>voltage</b> sense <b>amplifiers.</b> The hybrid sense amplifier works in three phases-Offset cancellation (200 ps), Access phase (500 ps) and Evaluation phase. The offset cancellation is done simultaneously with word line decoding, so as to speed up the process. The sensing range of the hybrid sense amplifier is improved from 1. 18 mV to 92 mV. Also hybrid sense amplifier consumes very low energy of about 6. 84 fj.

40|$|Piezoelectric shunt damping is {{investigated}} as {{one possible}} solution {{for improving the}} vibroacoustic behavior of noise-prone lightweight structures. The negative capacitance shunt circuit appears to be best choice due to its broadband damping effect. Usually it is built from analog electronic components, such as operational amplifiers, resistors and capacitors. Laboratory tests are possible with this setup, but it is limited to low vibrational excitation levels, because the known circuits are not capable of accessing a sufficient voltage amplitude at the piezoelectric transducers, which is required for high vibration amplitudes. Therefore an improved approach is presented in this paper, which addresses the specific voltage requirements of a common piezoelectric transducer. It comprises a tailored power source and an appropriate concept for the negative capacitance shunt hardware. There only standard operational amplifiers together with an external high <b>voltage</b> power <b>amplifier</b> <b>circuit</b> are used to cover the whole operating range of a piezoelectric transducer. A demonstrator board is developed and experimentally investigated at a test structure. Finally, the results are compared to a conventional setup.

40|$|MOS {{transistors}} with sub 100 nm channel lengths need a {{gate oxide}} thickness {{in the range}} of 1 - 2 nm to combat the short channel effects. However at these gate dielectric thicknesses, the gate current is no longer negligible. In this paper, we report the device analog behavior with extremely scaled oxides for integrating mixed signal circuits using the scaled digital CMOS technologies. We show the performance of common source amplifiers and current mirror circuits with these technologies. Our results also show that though thin oxides result in good <b>voltage</b> gains of <b>amplifier</b> <b>circuits,</b> the increased gate leakage degrades the performance of current mirror circuits. We also analyze the performance of different classes of current mirror circuits in the presence of gate leakage and provide broad guidelines for analog circuit design in the presence of gate leakage. © IEE...|$|R
50|$|Operational <b>amplifier</b> <b>circuits</b> {{typically}} employ {{negative feedback}} {{to get a}} predictable transfer function.

Investigation of control system was required to get high quality of system. Purposes of this research was: to investigate relation between output voltage of sensor and signal processing circuits with temperature, to determine number that presented at digital display as function of temperature, and to determine accuracy and precision of temperature control system. The research can be classified into laboratory experimental research. Data collecting technique that used in this research was direct measurement. Variables that measured temperature, output voltage of sensor, and output <b>voltage</b> of <b>amplifier</b> <b>circuits,</b> while gradient of straight line and static characteristics were measured indirectly. The data that founded of measurement result was analyzed by using graph and error analysis. Graph {{analysis was used to}} determine measurement error, accuracy, and precision of control system.

40|$|This report {{deals with}} offset {{correction}} techniques for <b>voltage</b> sense <b>amplifiers</b> and {{is divided into}} two different parts: 1) mismatch and 2) offset correction techniques. First a literature study is done on the subject mismatch with specially focus on the future. Mismatch of a transistor is determined by the mismatch factors σVT and σβ which are depend strongly on the inverse square root of the effective gate area. For these mismatch factors a future expectation will be given. The outcome is that the mismatch factors σVT and σβ will increase significantly if the transistor downscaling process continues. Also a deeper insight will be given about the amount of contribution of these mismatch parameters to the offset current of a transistor. Because the matching accuracy of the currents in the <b>voltage</b> sense <b>amplifier</b> determines mainly the sensitivity of this special <b>amplifier.</b> <b>Voltage</b> sense <b>amplifiers</b> are used extensively in memories. For this reason a short paragraph about the memory architecture is written for more background information. Basically what the sense amplifier does is detecting the information which is located in the memory cells. This information is read out and results in a small voltage difference between two bitlines. The sense amplifier evaluates this small voltage difference and converts it into a logic level output signal. A basic <b>voltage</b> sense <b>amplifier</b> is the starting point in the further research to offset correction techniques. Different offset correction techniques are investigated and applied to this <b>voltage</b> sense <b>amplifier.</b> First all the techniques are tuned to get the best performance in sensitivity. Then in the second step the different offset correction techniques are optimized in speed. Finally a comparison is made based on all the results. In this way the best offset correction techniques for the <b>voltage</b> sense <b>amplifier</b> are found. The following offset correction techniques are investigated: threshold cancellation, β offset reduction, metastable offset correction and calibration. Threshold cancellation is an already known technique which is used often by <b>voltage</b> sense <b>amplifiers.</b> β offset reduction is also not new, but the technique is not really elaborated in practice realizations in the past. The metastable offset correction technique is a new designed technique which has some similarities with the threshold cancellation technique. Calibration is a general offline technique which adjusts the <b>voltage</b> sense <b>amplifier</b> to a very sensitive system. Threshold cancellation cancels the threshold voltages of the two most important transistors in the <b>voltage</b> sense <b>amplifier.</b> Short <b>circuit</b> connections are applied to these transistors to find the real threshold voltages. These threshold voltages are measured and stored in capacitors. The capacitors are put in serial with the gates of the two transistors to cancel the threshold voltages. The technique operates quite well but is not really suitable for the <b>voltage</b> sense <b>amplifier</b> if a high speed is required. β offset reduction uses a technique which turns on lightly the correct transistor during the decision of the <b>voltage</b> sense <b>amplifier.</b> Other transistors which could have β mismatch are turned on later when the decision is already made by the <b>voltage</b> sense <b>amplifier.</b> In this way the offset current due to only β offset can be reduced significantly. β offset reduction is a very simple technique which has a reasonable sensitivity. Furthermore the technique operates at high speed and does not have large power consumption. The metastable offset correction technique uses the metastable property of the two inverters in the sense amplifier. The two inverters in the sense amplifier are set into metastable states before the sense amplifier makes a decision. In this way the inverters are compensated for the offset. One of the inverters goes out the metastable state when a memory cell is read out and a decision is enforced by the sense amplifier. The technique is very suitable for the <b>voltage</b> sense <b>amplifier</b> and gives good results in sensitivity and speed...|$|R
50|$|In {{an ideal}} current or {{transconductance}} amplifier the output impedance approaches infinity. Practically all commercial audio <b>amplifiers</b> are <b>voltage</b> <b>amplifiers.</b> Their output impedances have been intentionally developed to approach zero. Due {{to the nature}} of vacuum tubes and audio transformers, the output impedance of an average tube amplifier is usually considerably higher than the modern audio amplifiers produced completely without vacuum tubes or audio transformers. Most tube amplifiers with their higher output impedance are less ideal <b>voltage</b> <b>amplifiers</b> than the solid state <b>voltage</b> <b>amplifiers</b> with their smaller output impedance.|$|R
50|$|Another goal of {{frequency}} compensation is {{to control the}} step response of an <b>amplifier</b> <b>circuit</b> as shown in Figure 1. For example, if a step in voltage is input to a <b>voltage</b> <b>amplifier,</b> ideally a step in output voltage would occur. However, the output is not ideal because of the frequency response of the amplifier, and ringing occurs. Several figures of merit to describe the adequacy of step response are in common use. One is the rise time of the output, which ideally would be short. A second {{is the time for}} the output to lock into its final value, which again should be short. The success in reaching this lock-in at final value is described by overshoot (how far the response exceeds final value) and settling time (how long the output swings back and forth about its final value). These various measures of the step response usually conflict with one another, requiring optimization methods.|$|R
5000|$|Typically the {{open-loop}} {{phase lag}} (relative to input) varies with frequency, progressively increasing to exceed 180°, at which frequency the output signal becomes inverted, or antiphase {{in relation to}} the input. The PM will be positive but decreasing at frequencies less than the frequency at which inversion sets in (at which PM = 0), and PM is negative (PM < 0) at higher frequencies. In the presence of negative feedback, a zero or negative PM at a frequency where the loop gain exceeds unity (1) guarantees instability. Thus positive PM is a [...] "safety margin" [...] that ensures proper (non-oscillatory) operation of the circuit. This applies to <b>amplifier</b> <b>circuits</b> as well as more generally, to active filters, under various load conditions (e.g. reactive loads). In its simplest form, involving ideal negative feedback <b>voltage</b> <b>amplifiers</b> with non-reactive feedback, the phase margin is measured at the frequency where the open-loop voltage gain of the amplifier equals the desired closed-loop DC voltage gain.|$|R
