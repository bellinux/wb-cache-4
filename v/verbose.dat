5|$|C# {{provides}} properties as syntactic sugar for {{a common}} pattern in which a pair of methods, accessor (getter) and mutator (setter) encapsulate operations on a single attribute of a class. No redundant method signatures for the getter/setter implementations need be written, and the property may be accessed using attribute syntax rather than more <b>verbose</b> method calls.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers made {{positive}} {{remarks about}} the game's orchestral score and voice acting. Kasavin (GameSpot) wrote that added choral tracks during intense in-game moments gave the game epic overtones, though Clayman (IGN) thought the score made the game environments feel delusively majestic. Bramwell (Eurogamer) found little joy in the <b>verbose</b> dialogue, which he often skipped even during important scenes, but Kasavin (GameSpot) considered the voice acting amusing, with good quality. He also praised the level of nuance in the sound effects, such as those made as characters walked.|$|E
5|$|The 30-word {{design was}} the most popular {{recruitment}} poster at the time having been printed ten times the volume of Leete's image. Leete's image has been praised for being more arresting while his accompanying text is also far less <b>verbose.</b> The official wording, taken from a Kitchener speech, may seem more fitting for a character in a Henry James novel. The 30-word recruiting poster was developed as Britons' collective hopes of the war being over by Christmas were dashed in January 1915 and volunteer enlistments fell.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{economic}} realities of the conversion to sound, were the artistic considerations. Early sound films were often noted for being too <b>verbose.</b> In 1930, Carl Laemmle criticized the wall-to-wall banter of sound pictures, and director Ernst Lubitsch wondered what the camera was intended for if characters were going to narrate all the onscreen action. The film industry also withstood competition from the home radio, and often characters in films {{went to great lengths}} to belittle the medium. The film industry was not above using the new medium to broadcast commercials for its projects however, and occasionally turned radio stars into short feature performers to take advantage of their built-in following.|$|E
5|$|Reviewing {{the book}}, Charles E. Osgood {{classified}} {{the book as}} a graduate-level text based more on objective facts than on theoretical constructs. He thought the book was <b>verbose</b> on some topics and too brief on others {{not directly related to}} the author's expertise area. He was also critical of Miller's use of simple, Skinnerian single-stage stimulus-response learning to explain human language acquisition and use. This approach, per Osgood, made it impossible to analyze the concept of meaning, and the idea of language consisting of representational signs. He did find the book objective in its emphasis on facts over theory, and depicting clearly application of information theory to psychology.|$|E
5|$|Another {{influential}} early mainframe {{game was}} Baseball, a sports game {{that was created}} on a PDP-10 minicomputer at Pomona College in 1971 by English major Don Daglow. Baseball was the first baseball video game that allowed players to manage the game as it unfolded, rather than just picking players {{at the beginning of}} a game. The program is documented at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York. Baseball was continually updated through 1974, and distributed to other PDP-10 installations. The text-based game had each player control the pitcher or the batter; they would enter their intention to, for example, pitch to or walk the batter, or switch hitters. The batting player could direct on-base players to steal, and the batter to hit. The results of the play would be printed out onto paper as a <b>verbose</b> description, like a radio description of the game. Daglow went on to develop more sophisticated baseball games in 1983 with Intellivision World Series Baseball, and 1987 with Earl Weaver Baseball, as well as numerous other games.|$|E
5|$|To {{make the}} boot loader {{appealing}} to other operating system developers, Apple added features to allow {{flexibility in the}} booting process such as network boot using TFTP and load Mach-O and ELF formatted kernels. BootX can also boot from HFS, HFS+, UFS and ext2 formatted volumes. The boot loader can be manipulated at startup by holding down various key combinations to alter the booting process. Such functions include <b>Verbose</b> Mode, achieved by holding down the Command and V key at startup, which replaces the default Apple logo with text-based information on the boot process and Single User Mode, achieved by holding down the Command and S, which, depending on the operating system, may boot into a more basic command-line or text-based version of the operating system, to facilitate maintenance and recovery action. The ROM can also be set to require a password to access these technical functions using the OpenFirmware interface.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, if Kemp had won his {{campaign}} for the United States Presidency, {{it would have made}} him the first person to move from the United States House of Representatives to the White House since James Garfield. When he formed his exploratory committee, he signed Ed Rollins, Reagan's 1984 re-election political director, as an advisor. From the outset, Kemp had failed to position himself as the primary alternative to Vice President Bush. Except for a select few cognoscenti, the general public did not recognize Kemp's leadership ability, although he was a successful man of ideas. In fact, most of the Republican electorate found themselves unfamiliar with Kemp early in {{his campaign}}. Political pundits recognized him, however, as a visionary idea man. In addition, he was quickly perceived as a <b>verbose</b> speaker who sometimes lost contact with his audience. Although Kemp tried to appeal to conservatives, his libertarian philosophies of tolerance and individual rights and his commitment to supporting minorities, women, blue-collar workers and organized labor clashed with conservative voters' social and religious values. To Democrats, Kemp's free-market philosophies were a form of laissez-faire anarchy. However, as much as Kemp wanted to minimize government's role, he acknowledged that moves toward a more laissez-faire system should be well-thought out.|$|E
5|$|The bill {{itself was}} {{formally}} {{introduced to the}} House of Commons on 4 March 1907. The subject was debated in the House of Lords on 21 March, where the proposed changed to the Militia were strongly opposed. The bill had its second reading in the Commons on 9, 10, and 23 April, and was passed into Committee, where it was discussed at some length over nine days. The opposition to the bill, whilst <b>verbose,</b> was not very effective. Hugh Arnold-Forster, the previous War Secretary, argued that the Territorial Force would prove ineffective in opposition to conscripted Continental armies, whilst the Labour Party objected generally to any increase in military strength. Most of the opposition came from partisans of the existing system; {{as well as the}} implacable opposition from the Militia element, supporters of the Yeomanry objected to the reduction in their daily rates (from 5s. 6d. to 2s. 8d.), whilst Sir Howard Vincent led the opposition from the Volunteers against the stricter control of the new regulations. However, the strong Liberal majority saw off all opposition, and the bill moved for a third reading on 19 June, where it passed with 286 votes to 63. The opposition was mainly led by the Irish MPs, who voted against the government for reasons unrelated to the bill, and some of the Labour Party; most of the Unionists, save a few like Vincent or Charles Dilke, abstained rather than oppose.|$|E
25|$|Interregional and International Trade {{itself was}} <b>verbose,</b> {{rather than being}} pared down to the mathematical, and appealed because of its new insights.|$|E
25|$|Other {{complaints}} {{may include}} {{a lack of}} reflection or garbage collection, slow compilation times, perceived feature creep, and <b>verbose</b> error messages, particularly from template metaprogramming.|$|E
25|$|This is a runestone {{raised in}} the church of Turinge. It is in sandstone, in the style Pr4 and it was made {{in memory of the}} {{chieftain}} of a warband. It is the most <b>verbose</b> of all the Varangian stones, and it was probably made in the mid-11th century.|$|E
25|$|On the radio, Farber became easily {{identifiable}} by his unique combination of drawn-out Southern drawl, intense delivery, <b>verbose</b> prose, and quick wit. Sponsors loved {{his ability to}} deliver a live commercial spot, often ad-libbed, and make whatever the particular product was sound tantalizing; he always sounded like he truly believed in the product.|$|E
25|$|In its conclusion, {{the story}} is signed by a Parsi priest named Bahman Kaikobad (or 'Bahman Kaikobad Hamjiar Sanjana'). The date of authorship is {{recorded}} as 969 YZ (1599 CE, see Zoroastrian calendar) - several centuries after the described events {{are thought to have}} occurred. The account is in verse, in the highly <b>verbose</b> style common to Persian poetry.|$|E
25|$|Justine (original French title: Les infortunes de la vertu) was {{an early}} work by the Marquis de Sade, written in two weeks in 1787 while imprisoned in the Bastille. It is a novella (187 pages) with {{relatively}} little of the obscenity that characterized his later writing, as {{it was written in}} the classical style (which was fashionable at the time), with much <b>verbose</b> and metaphorical description.|$|E
25|$|On February 27, 1943, Gabreski {{became part}} of the 56th Fighter Group, flying the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt, {{assigned}} to the 61st Fighter Squadron, and quickly became a flight leader. He was immediately resented by many of his fellow pilots, {{and the fact that he}} was opinionated and <b>verbose</b> did little to ease the situation. In May, shortly after the group moved to RAF Halesworth and entered combat, Gabreski was promoted to major.|$|E
25|$|The {{need for}} secrecy and inconspicuousness deeply colors the traditions and mannerisms of mafiosi. Mafiosi are {{discouraged}} from consuming alcohol or other drugs, as in an inebriated state {{they are more}} likely to blurt out sensitive information. They also frequently adopt self-effacing attitudes to strangers so as to avoid unwanted attention. Most Sicilians tend to be very <b>verbose</b> and expressive, whereas mafiosi tend to be more terse and subdued. Mafiosi are also forbidden from writing down anything about their activities, lest such evidence be discovered by police.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, the HKEAA {{decided on}} an {{across-the-board}} revamp upon {{the format of}} questions in the exam. The changes included the replacement of questions on prescribed texts with open-ended questions in the questions on culture paper. It was HKEAA's attempt to prevent candidates from memorising the suggested reading materials. That, however, was dismissed {{by a number of}} candidates as a move towards the subject turning out into a saliva subject (吹水科, Jyutping: Ceoi1 Seoi2 Fo1) in which candidates concentrate on writing large amounts of <b>verbose</b> text and neglect the actual quality of the contents.|$|E
25|$|In small circles Kohl was {{fascinating}} {{and a perfect}} host; the larger the crowd, the vaguer, weaker and paler he appeared. His gaze into TV cameras made him look helpless. When attacked, e.g. in election campaigns, he became a good fighter. But in general he was no great orator, his speeches were lengthy and <b>verbose.</b> Additionally, the catholic with his Palatinate dialect, a folksy man who had culture but was simply no intellectual - to North German journalists (like from the important newspapers made in Hamburg) he just felt foreign, more than any previous CDU chairman.|$|E
25|$|Algorithms can be {{expressed}} in many kinds of notation, including natural languages, pseudocode, flowcharts, drakon-charts, programming languages or control tables (processed by interpreters). Natural language expressions of algorithms tend to be <b>verbose</b> and ambiguous, and are rarely used for complex or technical algorithms. Pseudocode, flowcharts, drakon-charts and control tables are structured ways to express algorithms that avoid many of the ambiguities common in natural language statements. Programming languages are primarily intended for expressing algorithms {{in a form that}} can be executed by a computer, but are often used as a way to define or document algorithms.|$|E
25|$|SBML can encode models {{consisting}} of entities (called species in SBML) acted upon by processes (called reactions). An important principle is that models are decomposed into explicitly-labeled constituent elements, {{the set of}} which resembles a <b>verbose</b> rendition of chemical reaction equations (if the model uses reactions) together with optional explicit equations (again, if the model uses these); the SBML representation deliberately does not cast the model directly into a set of differential equations or other specific interpretation of the model. This explicit, modeling-framework-agnostic decomposition {{makes it easier for}} a software tool to interpret the model and translate the SBML form into whatever internal form the tool actually uses.|$|E
25|$|On 13 January 1943 Bedaux was in Algeria {{allegedly}} {{supervising the}} construction of a German pipeline when he and his son were arrested by the Americans. He was kept in custody without charge for a year. Bedaux was eventually flown to the US, and, awaiting charges of trading with the enemy and treason, committed suicide using an overdose of barbiturates while in FBI custody in Miami, Florida. His death featured prominently in the contemporary media, particularly an influential New Yorker biographical trilogy by Janet Flanner. Here, Flanner attacked the Bedaux System and Bedaux Unit as, despite Bedaux's <b>verbose</b> claims to originality, she argued that they did not differ 'much from the old Frederick Winslow Taylor shop-management system of the nineties'.|$|E
25|$|Most {{of these}} {{perceptions}} arise from Wagner's published opinions {{on a number}} of topics. Wagner was a voluminous writer and published essays and pamphlets {{on a wide range of}} subjects throughout his life. Wagner's writing style is <b>verbose,</b> unclear and turgid, which has greatly added to the confusion about his opinions. Several of his writings have achieved some notoriety, in particular his essay Das Judenthum in der Musik, (Jewishness in Music), a critical view on the influence of Jews in German culture and society at that time. The essays he wrote in his final years were also controversial, with many readers perceiving them to employ an endorsement of racist beliefs. Some commentators also believe that some of Wagner's operas contain adverse caricatures of Jews.|$|E
25|$|I {{have not}} seen Chas. Greville's book, but have read {{a good deal of}} it. It is a social outrage. And {{committed}} by one who was always talking of what he called ‘perfect gentlemen.’ I don't think he can figure now in that category. I knew him intimately. He was the vainest being—I don't limit myself to man—that ever existed; and I don't forget Cicero and Lytton Bulwer; but Greville wd. swallow garbage, and required it. Offended selflove is a key to most of his observations. He lent me a volume of his MS. once to read; more modern than these; I found, when he was not scandalous, he was prolix and prosy—a clumsy, wordy writer. The loan was made à propos of the character of Peel, which I drew in George Bentinck's Life, and which, I will presume to say, is the only thing written about Peel wh. has any truth or stuff in it. Greville was not displeased with it, and as a reward, and a treat, told me that he wd. confide to me his character of Peel, and he gave me the sacred volume, wh. I bore with me, with trembling awe, from Bruton St. to Grosr Gate. If ever it appears, you, who have taste for style and expression, will, I am sure, agree with me that, as a portrait painter, Greville is not a literary Vandyke or Reynolds; a more <b>verbose,</b> indefinite, unwieldy affair, without a happy expression, never issued from the pen of a fagged subordinate of the daily press.|$|E
25|$|Samuel ben Ḥofni wrote, besides, an Arabic {{translation}} of the Pentateuch with a commentary, a commentary {{on some of the}} Prophets, and perhaps a commentary on Ecclesiastes (see Harkavy, l.c. iii. 24, note 59; Poznanski, l.c. ii. 55, note 5). M. I. Israelsohn (Samuelis b. Hofni Trium Sectionum Posteriorum Libri Genesis Versio Arabica cum Commentario, St. Petersburg, 1886) has published a portion of Samuel's Pentateuch translation (Gen. xli.-l.) with commentary. The deficiencies in these edited fragments might be supplied by the citations in Abraham Maimonides' commentary on Genesis and Exodus (Neubauer, Cat. Bodl. Hebr. MSS. No. 276). The German {{translation of}} a specimen of these fragments is given in Winter and Wünsche (l.c. ii. 254). The fragments show that Samuel's {{translation of the}} Pentateuch was dependent upon, though it was more literal than, that of Saadia, which had been written almost one hundred years earlier. In contrast to Saadia, Samuel gives Hebrew proper names in their original form. Grammatical notes occupy a remarkably small space in his <b>verbose</b> commentary, and his grammatical point of view was that taken by scholars before the time of Ḥayyuj. On the other hand, he gives careful consideration to the chronology of Bible accounts, and in explaining a word he gives all its various meanings besides references to its occurrence elsewhere. His source is the midrashic and Talmudic literature, though he specifically mentions only the Seder Olam and the Targum Onḳelos (see Bacher in R. E. J. xv. 277, xvi. 106 et seq.).|$|E
25|$|Viki {{surprisingly}} {{manages to}} pass her theater audition, though it's obvious {{the reason for}} the sudden success is jury member Baron being taken with her attractive looks. Though she's ecstatic, Filip is not thrilled with the development and is especially unhappy about the celebrated theater actor and multiple divorcee Baron now wooing his girlfriend, with Viki even welcoming the aging lothario's smooth advances. Frustrated, Filip even contacts Ema hoping to receive some help getting through to Viki whose head is high in the clouds. For the moment at least, Giga and Ema manage to impart some rationality to their daughter, and she seems ready to take the sensible option and make nice with Filip. In parallel, in order to sweeten his case with Viki, Baron arranges for her, a complete novice, to get the demanding role of Juliet in the theater's latest production of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, while Baron plays Romeo. He tells her the big news by showing up unannounced at the apartment just as she's getting ready to go out to meet Filip for a date. The news sends her on cloud nine and she immediately puts Filip and the marriage on the back-burner while Filip's frustration grows. Soon, Baron manages to bed Viki who thus becomes his latest conquest. Though he's not aware of the gory details yet, Filip has seen enough to send him over the edge and, overcome with jealousy, he constantly interrupts their rehearsals. It all culminates in an act of madness as he breaks into Baron's apartment with a gun, threatening to kill him, but the <b>verbose</b> actor talks him out of it using a combination of pointed eloquence and dramatic flair.|$|E
25|$|They {{find that}} a large party has {{assembled}} at his home and that the champagne is already flowing. Present are Lebedyev, his daughter Vera, Ippolit, Burdovsky, Kolya, General Ivolgin, Ganya, Ptitsyn, Ferdyschenko, Keller, and, to Myshkin's surprise, Yevgeny Pavlovich, who has come to ask for his friendship and advice. The guests greet the Prince warmly and compete for his attention. Stimulated by Lebedyev's eloquence, everyone engages for some time in intelligent and inebriated disputation on lofty subjects, but the good-humoured atmosphere begins to dissipate when Ippolit suddenly produces a large red-sealed envelope and announces that it contains an essay he has written which he now intends to read to them. The essay {{is a series of}} <b>verbose</b> psychological observations on the subject of his own approaching death, written in a defiant, self-conscious style, and culminating in the announcement that, rather than go on living for a few more weeks, he will be shooting himself at sunrise. The reading drags on for over an hour and by its end, the sun has risen. Most of his audience, however, is bored and resentful, apparently not at all concerned that he is about to shoot himself. Only Vera, Kolya, Burdovsky and Keller seek to restrain him. He distracts them by pretending to abandon the plan, then suddenly pulls out a small pistol, puts it to his temple and pulls the trigger. There is a click but no shot: Ippolit faints but is not killed. It turns out, to the great amusement of some, that he had taken out the cap earlier and forgotten to put it back in. Ippolit is devastated and tries desperately to convince everyone that it was an accident. Eventually, he falls asleep and the party disperses.|$|E
500|$|COBOL has an English-like syntax, {{which was}} {{designed}} to be self-documenting and highly readable. However, it is <b>verbose</b> and uses over 300 reserved words. In contrast with modern, succinct syntax like , COBOL has a more English-like syntax (in this case, [...] ).|$|E
500|$|Jean Sammet, a {{short-range}} committee member, {{noted that}} [...] "little {{attempt was made}} to cater to the professional programmer, in fact people whose main interest is programming tend to be very unhappy with COBOL" [...] which she attributed to COBOL's <b>verbose</b> syntax.|$|E
500|$|Autumn 1922 saw {{the first}} daily {{installment}} of Stumble Inn, the first non-Krazy Kat strip Herriman had drawn since 1919. [...] A <b>verbose</b> strip whose Sundays were often overrun with prose, its lead characters were Uriah and Ida Stumble, who rented rooms to an assortment of strange characters. [...] The daily strip was short-lived, but the Sundays edition lasted three years.|$|E
500|$|In addition, Rice's writing {{style has}} been heavily analyzed. Ferraro, in a {{statement}} typical of many reviewers, describes her prose as [...] "florid, both lurid and lyrical, and full of sensuous detail". However, others have criticized Rice's writing style as both <b>verbose</b> and overly philosophical. Author William Patrick Day comments that her writing is often [...] "long, convoluted, and imprecise".|$|E
500|$|Tim Rogers (born June 7, 1979) is an American {{video game}} {{journalist}} and developer. In games journalism, {{he is known}} for his association with mid-2000s New Games Journalism, his <b>verbose</b> writing style, and his video game reviews website ActionButton.net. The Guardian cited his 2005 [...] "Dreaming in an empty room: a defense of Metal Gear Solid 2" [...] as a core example of New Games Journalism, a style of video game journalism that emphasizes the author's subjective and personal experiences in relation to the game world. Rogers has also written for Next Generation, GamesTM, Play, Game Developer, and Kotaku.|$|E
500|$|On its <b>verbose</b> language, one {{editor at}} Manchester Literary Club {{felt that the}} [...] "enthusiastic philologist" [...] would [...] "make heaven" [...] of Betelguese, a Trip Through Hell. However, a review in the March 28, 1909 edition of the Salt Lake Tribune was mixed on De Esque's off-beat use of the English language, stating, [...] "it is plentifully {{sprinkled}} with weird words without any particular meaning." [...] The Salt Lake Tribune columnist {{went on to say}} that [...] "Betelguese was a [...] "wild sort of rhapsody, which is less fierce than one might suppose from the subtitle." ...|$|E
500|$|Alexander Jannaeus died, {{according}} to Josephus, of quartan fever and alcoholism, {{which has been}} compared to the references to [...] "disease" [...] and [...] "drunkenness" [...] of the Wicked Priest. Jannaeus also may lay claim to the [...] "delivered into the hands of his enemies" [...] passage because, {{according to}} Jewish Antiquities (13:13.5), he succumbed to an ambush by [...] "Obedas, the King of the Arabs" [...] before escaping to Jerusalem. The same passage has also been suggested as a pun on Jannaeus’s <b>verbose</b> moniker (as attested to by contemporary coins, pictured) Yehonathan ("Yahweh gave"), often shorted as Yannaia pun which allegedly also occurs in 1QpHab 10.3-5.|$|E
500|$|Later, Record Collector {{described}} the album as a [...] "taut, twitchy and ominous masterclass in DIY post-punk", and singled out Smith's lyrics for praise. The Quietus, in 2009, {{wrote of the}} album as [...] "arguably... The Fall's mightiest hour", while Stylus Magazine wrote that [...] "Hex demonstrates the culmination of 'early' Fall: a monolithic beast of ragged grooves piloted through the embittering miasma of English society by the <b>verbose</b> acidity/Joycean all-inclusiveness of Mark E. Smith." [...] Pitchfork listed Hex Enduction Hour as the 33rd best album of the 1980s. Comedian Stewart Lee has called it his favourite album and [...] "probably the best album of all time." ...|$|E
500|$|While Augie March {{generally}} {{fall into}} an indie/pop rock genre, {{their ability to}} mix other genres into their style at times makes classifying their musical style difficult. A common thread {{that runs through the}} band's sound is Richards' literate and often <b>verbose</b> lyrics, which have set the band apart from {{much of the rest of}} the Australian music scene. Even early on in their career, Richards' unique style attracted attention and he has drawn critical acclaim for his poetic style, with one reviewer describing him as [...] "unique", [...] "refreshing", and [...] "intellectual". Allmusic's Jack Rabid said Richards [...] "exhibits a honey voice" [...] on Sunset Studies, but Grok pointed out that the album was rendered too complex or intricate for many.|$|E
