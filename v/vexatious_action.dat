50|$|Alexander Chaffers was {{a notorious}} lawyer {{who was a}} party in the scandal of Sir Travers and Lady Twiss in 1872 and was {{subsequently}} considered such a vexatious litigant that the <b>Vexatious</b> <b>Actions</b> Act was passed in 1896 to stop him.|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} {{vexatious}} litigation entered {{into law in}} 1896 with the <b>Vexatious</b> <b>Actions</b> Act, enacted in England and soon extended to Scotland and Ireland. This was a response primarily to the actions of Alexander Chaffers, a solicitor who filed numerous actions against leading members of Victorian society. When costs were awarded against him he failed to pay.|$|R

5000|$|Alexander Chaffers, a {{solicitor}} whose actions led to {{the first}} British law against vexatious litigation, the <b>Vexatious</b> <b>Actions</b> Act, 1896. Chaffers became notorious after accusing the wife of Travers Twiss of being a prostitute, and subsequently issued 48 proceedings against leading members of Victorian society in the 1890s. Costs awarded against Chaffers were never paid. After the act was passed, {{he became the first}} person to be declared a habitually vexatious litigant and barred from future litigation without judicial permission.|$|R
5000|$|Under the <b>Vexatious</b> <b>Actions</b> (Scotland) Act 1898 [...] the Lord Advocate {{can apply}} for an order under section 1 of that Act to prevent any person accused of {{vexatious}} litigation from raising any and all legal proceedings [...] "unless he obtains the leave of a judge sitting in the Outer House on the Bills in the Court of Session, having satisfied the judge that such legal proceeding is not vexatious." [...] A {{list of people who}} have had such an order brought against them is published on the Scottish Courts website. As of December 2016 there are ten names on this list.|$|R
2500|$|The Singapore Court of Appeal {{endorsed}} the reasoning in Boyce v. Paddington Borough Council (1902) which explained the applicable test for standing regarding public rights. Since public rights {{are shared by}} everyone in common because they arise from public duties owed by public authorities to the general class of persons as a whole, an applicant must prove [...] "special damage" [...] peculiar to himself or herself to distinguish his or her claim from those of other potential litigants in the same class. The Court justified the need for special damage in cases involving public rights to prevent frivolous or <b>vexatious</b> <b>actions.</b> Otherwise, courts will be swamped by an array of actions raised by [...] "mere busybodies and social gadflies, {{to the detriment of}} good public administration" [...] where the burden of bearing costs may not be a sufficient deterrence.|$|R
5000|$|Peter Wilmshurst is a British {{medical doctor}} and {{successful}} whistleblower {{who has been}} the subject of multiple cases of harassment through <b>vexatious</b> libel <b>actions</b> brought by companies whose products he criticised as ineffective. He has also reported at least twenty doctors to the General Medical Council in the course of two decades of investigating research misconduct.|$|R
5000|$|In 1871, Twiss became {{involved}} in an unpleasant scandal, which brought his career to an end. In 1862 he had married the 22-year-old Marie van Lynnseele, who he presented {{as the daughter of}} a Polish aristocrat. A solicitor named Alexander Chaffers claimed that Marie was in reality a French former prostitute who went by the name [...] "Marie Gelas", and had been Twiss's mistress before their marriage. Chaffers, who also claimed to have been one of her lovers, was allegedly blackmailing her, sending her bills for imaginary [...] "services rendered", which she initially paid. When she refused to pay any more, Chaffers made a statutory declaration about her, which he sent to various bishops and to the Lord Chamberlain. Charges of libel were brought against Chaffers, but were dropped when Marie Twiss broke down under ruthless cross-examination by Chaffers and then fled the country. Twiss was humiliated. He resigned from all his appointments and lived in retirement in London until his death. He never again saw his wife. Chaffers' subsequent vexatious litigation led to the passing of the <b>Vexatious</b> <b>Actions</b> Act in 1896. He died in a workhouse.|$|R
50|$|Legal {{bullying}} is the bringing of a <b>vexatious</b> legal <b>action</b> {{to control}} and punish a person. Legal bullying can often {{take the form of}} frivolous, repetitive, or burdensome lawsuits brought to intimidate the defendant into submitting to the litigant's request, not because of the legal merit of the litigant's position, but principally due to the defendant's inability to maintain the legal battle. This can also take the form of SLAPPs. It was partially concern about the potential for this kind of abuse that helped to fuel the protests against SOPA and PIPA in the United States in 2011 and 2012.|$|R

To first assert that its unfair competition and false designation of origin claims are justiciable {{and at the same time}} assert that Mayo's identical claims are not is at best questionable; in light of RTC's documented history of <b>vexatious</b> behavior, RTC's <b>actions</b> are indefensible. ..." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the impacts that {{legislation}} protecting endangered species will have on agricultural practices in Saskatchewan. This project will focus on endangered species in pastureland. A second objective will be to provide alternative methods of achieving species protection other than those outlined in Bill C- 65 of the Second Session of the Thirty fifth Parliament, the Canadian Endangered Species Act (the Bill), one of which alternatives will be the Saskatchewan Wildlife Act (the Sask. Act). Hyperbole and hysteria on both sides characterize the current debate about the effects of the Bill on farmers and ranchers in Saskatchewan. That the Bill could have affected farmer's and rancher's costs and thus management decisions is certain; as by received economic theory anything that affects an economic agent's costs or profits will affect that agent's decision making. This study assesses the extent of these costs by resorting to the price necessary to bribe farmers/ranchers to increase habitat. The Bill's purpose is the protection of bio diversity through the conservation of endangered species which is to be achieved by a species by species procedure which mirrors the one adopted by the United States under the Endangered Species Act 1973 (the Act). This study's results suggest that the Bill and the Act share an institutional framework that is sufficiently similar to suggest that only a difference in the perception of the social costs of noncompliance would alter the results witnessed in the United States. That is, if Canada had enacted the Bill it appears that given the similarities between Canada's and the United States' systems of governing and law enforcement from a decision maker's perspective that the apparent disregard for the Act in the United States might be expected to exist in Canada, unless Canadian's have a social cost structure that is different from the social cost structure of residents of the United States. The analysis of the survey results suggests that such a difference in social costs does not appear to exist. The study explores a system of more generally protecting habitat and concludes that in order to do so effectively will require the expenditure in Saskatchewan of between twenty and forty million dollars per year on the part of the government. Effective habitat protection is also going to require the passing of legislation granting a Minister of the Crown discretionary authority to determine what should be protected where. Accompanying this discretion legislative action is also going to be necessary to change public interest standing and intervenor rules. Frivolous and <b>vexatious</b> <b>actions</b> against the Minister should be controllable through legislated solicitor client cost awards, an award were the unsuccessful litigant pays the successful litigants entire legal bill...|$|R
40|$|This {{principle}} is {{entrenched in the}} Bill of Rights. Section 34 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Act 108 of 1996 provides that everyone {{has the right to}} have any dispute that can be resolved by the application of law decided in a fair public hearing before a court or, where appropriate, another independent and impartial tribunal or forum. The term `person' here includes juristic persons like companies and close corporations (s 8 (2) and (4) of the Constitution; see also Michele Havenga `Corporations and the Right to Equality' (1999) 62 THRHR 495 at 495 ± 497). There are a number of well-known common-law and statutory exceptions to the principle. Common-law exceptions include peregrine plaintiffs, persons intent on pursuing <b>vexatious</b> and reckless <b>actions,</b> and those who resort to proceedings that are an abuse of the process of the court (see, generally, Ecker v Dean 1938 AD 102 at 110) School of Interdisciplinary Research and Graduate Studies (SIRGS...|$|R
40|$|Abuse of process, {{and related}} expressions, such as abuse of {{procedural}} rights, have in relatively recent times {{become part of}} the legal language of continental countries, such as Italy. But, since the introduction of the use of the concept, it has increasingly been an object and aim of several doctrinal contributions, which are here scrutinized. The essay concentrates upon the evolution of legal proceedings amounting to abuse of process, according to the definition which bases itself on the unfair and inadequate use of the process for purposes profoundly differing from those typical of the individual right to the access of justice. Initially, it was the state, when prosecuting a defendant for a criminal offence, to be regarded to be acting in an abusive way whenever the process was destitute of the attributes of a fair trial. Those times have been egregiously explored by Winfield in a well renowned book. But as time went by, the notion of abuse of process developed so as to comprehend all instances of an improper, vexatious, meritless beginning of actions, aimed at harassing the other party rather then pursuing a lawful end. The judicial and legislative response to this state of things, especially since the late days of the 19 th century, has been progressing towards more and more severe measures which resulted in the limitation, prohibition, striking out of <b>vexatious,</b> abusive <b>actions</b> through the conferring upon the courts of efficient discretionary powers. The description and illustration of this trend, and its most updated results, especially obtained in the English Court of Appeal, constitute the main core of this research...|$|R
