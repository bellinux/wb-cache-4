Writer Joseph Staten resolved to create a simple story to enhance an emotional backdrop more grounded in complexity.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Bayern {{became a}} member of the Oberliga Süd, the {{southern}} conference of the German first division, which was split five ways at that time. Bayern struggled, hiring and firing 13 coaches between 1945 and 1963. Landauer returned from exile in 1947 and was once again appointed club president, the tenure lasted until 1951. He remains as the club's president with the longest accumulated tenure. Landauer has been deemed as inventor of Bayern as a professional club and his memory is being upheld by the Bayern ultras Schickeria. In 1955, the club was relegated but returned to the Oberliga in the following season and won the DFB-Pokal for the first time, beating Fortuna Düsseldorf 1–0 in the final. The club struggled financially though, <b>verging</b> <b>on</b> bankruptcy at the end of the 1950s. Manufacturer Roland Endler provided the necessary funds and was rewarded with four years at the helm of the club. In 1963, the Oberligas in Germany were consolidated into one national league, the Bundesliga. Five teams from the Oberliga South were admitted. Bayern finished third in that year's southern division, but another Munich team, 1860 Munich, had won the championship. As the DFB preferred not to include two teams from one city, Bayern was not chosen for the Bundesliga. They gained promotion two years later, fielding a team with young talents like Franz Beckenbauer, Gerd Müller and Sepp Maier— who would later be collectively referred to as the axis.|$|E

In fact, although he was frequently quoted and displayed by the regime, Pătrășcanu's life was usually described in brief and vague sentences. In popular discourse, Pătrășcanu was also largely identified with positive causes, and remained among the most popular Communist figures after the Romanian Revolution of 1989 toppled the regime.|$|E

Though the actual purpose of the parrot is to prevent its mistress from leaving, it does so without moralising.

Most of the stories are ribald and uninhibited, with some <b>verging</b> <b>on</b> the pornographic.

25|$|Warwickshire Bears {{won their}} first Twenty20 match {{of the season}} in style, the deep batting line-up finally paying off. Almost every batsman contributed in their massive 205 for 7, Jamie Troughton top-scoring with 42, and no Glamorgan Dragons bowler escaped their wrath. When the Dragons batted, only Matthew Elliott and Sourav Ganguly gave them any hope of winning, and Ganguly's 36 off 35 balls was <b>verging</b> <b>on</b> the point of being useless when the {{required}} rate was 10 an over. A disciplined Warwickshire fielding effort - the Bears only conceded one extra - and Alex Loudon taking five for 33, resulted in Glamorgan falling to 151 all out in 18.2 overs.|$|E

It was believed the BBC were planning to cut short the evening news and move more light entertainment programming in from the 18:20 slot, but this was dismissed. The Miss Great Britain contest was dropped, being described as <b>verging</b> <b>on</b> the too offensive after the January 1985 contest, with Worlds Strongest Man and International Superstar also being axed.|$|E

25|$|François Achille Bazaine (13 February 181123 September 1888) was {{an officer}} of the French army.

He became renowned for his determination to lead from the front, for his impassive bearing under fire and for personal bravery <b>verging</b> <b>on</b> the foolhardy, which resulted in him being wounded on numerous occasions and having his horse shot from under him twice. From 1863 he was a Marshal of France, and it was in this role that he surrendered the last organized French army to Prussia during the Franco-Prussian war, during the siege of Metz.|$|E
