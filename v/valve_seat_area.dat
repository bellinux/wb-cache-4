40|$|Abstract: The {{pressure}} drop {{that occurs when}} a two-phase flow passes through a pipeline compo-nent is usually found by calculating the single-phase value and multiplying it by a two-phase mul-tiplier. Little or no consideration is given to what occurs within that component. For example, if the <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> <b>area</b> is suciently small, the fluid velocity will approach, or even reach, the critical velocity. In these circumstances, compressibility eects should be accounted for—they rarely are. This study was initiated to develop a technique that would allow {{pressure drop}}s to be predicted for pipe fittings, whether the flow is compressible or not, and to allow the critical mass flux to be estimated, thus allowing the method {{to be applied to}} the design of venting systems. The model developed can be used for all pipe fittings of the contraction–expansion type, like orifice plates and valves, up to and including the choking point, provided the single-phase loss coecient is known...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} into in-cylinder swirl and tumble flow characteristics with reduced maximum valve lifts (MVL) is presented. The experimental work {{was conducted in}} the modified four-valve optical spark-ignition (SI) test engine with three different MVL. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) was employed for measuring in-cylinder air motion and measurement results were analyzed for examining flow field, swirl and tumble ratio variation and fluctuating kinetic energy distribution. Results of ensemble-averaged flow fields show that reduced MVL could produce strong swirl flow velocity, then resulted in very regular swirl motion in the late stage of the intake process. The strong swirl flow can maintain very well until the late compression stage. The reduction of MVL can also increase both high-frequency and low-frequency swirl flow fluctuating kinetic energy remarkably. Regarding tumble flow, results demonstrate that lower MVLs result in more horizontal intake flow velocity vectors which can be easily detected under the <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> <b>area.</b> Although the result of lower MVLs show a higher tumble ratio when the piston {{is close to the}} bottom dead centre (BDC), higher MVLs substantially produce higher tumble ratios which can be confirmed when most cylinder area lies in the measuring range...|$|E
40|$|In {{internal}} combustion engines {{it is important}} to manage the wear in the valve and valve seat contact in order to minimise emissions and maximise economy. Traditionally wear in this contact has been controlled by the use of a valve seat insert and the careful selection of materials for both the valve and the insert. More recently, due to the increasing demands for both performance and cost, alternative methods of controlling the wear, and the resulting valve recession, have been sought. Using the heating effect of a laser to induce localised phase transformations, to increase hardness and wear resistance, in materials has been used since the 1970 s, however it is only in recent years that it has been able to compete with more established surface treatment techniques, particularly in terms of cost, as new laser hardware has been developed. In this work, a laser has been used to treat the <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> <b>area</b> of a cast iron cylinder head. In order to optimise the laser parameters for use on the head, preliminary tests were carried out to investigate the fundamental wear characteristics of untreated cast iron and also cast iron with a range of laser treatments. Previous work has identified the predominant wear mechanism in the valve and valve seat contact as impact on valve closure. Two bespoke test machines, one for testing basic specimens and one for testing components, were used to identify the laser parameters most likely to yield acceptable results when applied to a cylinder head to be used in a fired dynamometer test.

40|$|The {{following}} {{information is}} {{a summary of}} a Part 21 Report from Engine Systems, Inc. (ESI) concerning a condition reportable under 10 CFR 21. ESI reports that they received notification about foreign material found within a refurbished cylinder head supplied to the Cooper Nuclear Station by ESI. Specifically, Cooper discovered two hand tools (picks) within the intake port on the cylinder head. The tools were discovered by Cooper after installation of the head onto the diesel engine and while attempting to adjust the intake valve backlash. ESI supplied the refurbished cylinder head for a Cooper-Bessemer KSV engine to Cooper Nuclear Station (Part Number 13 -KSV- 1 1 - 6, Serial Number 6 K 2201) in August 2010. The refurbishment activity was performed at the Cameron Compression (OEM) facility in Casper, Wyoming. The most likely scenario is that the cylinder head was oriented with the inlet port facing up during installation of the valve spring keeper seals. After installation of the seals, the tools were placed {{on top of the}} cylinder head. It is presumed the tools fell into the inlet port and settled in the intake <b>valve</b> <b>seating</b> <b>area.</b> The tools are small in size (approximately 5 inches long with a 5 / 8 inch handle) and were not visible from the exterior of the head. ESI considers this occurrence to be an isolated incident and that Cooper Nuclear Station is the only affected customer. Previous shipments of similar cylinder heads are not suspect...|$|R
40|$|Cavitation {{developing}} upstream {{and inside}} the micro-channel orifices of transparent multi-hole fuel injector nozzles has been characterised using a high speed visualisation system. Images have been obtained with short exposure time and sufficiently high spatial and temporal resolution, freezing the formation of cavitation bubbles and their further development during every single injection cycle. Post processing of statistically large number of images collected from many successive injection events and numerous identical nozzles has allowed {{for the first time}} estimation of the ensemble average cavitation image and its standard deviation. The instantaneous images reveal the formation of a variety of complex and interacting two-phase flow regimes. Vapour bubbles have been found to exist inside the nozzle prior to start of injection. These bubbles originate from the previous injection cycle as they have not been evacuated from the nozzle and hence, they remain trapped, altering the flow of the subsequent injection event. During the opening and closing stages of the needle valve that controls the fuel flow through the nozzle, cavitation is found to form in the <b>valve’s</b> <b>seat</b> <b>area.</b> Subsequently, vortex or ‘string’ cavitation has been recorded to take place in a rather chaotic manner; its life time and most probable location of appearance have been estimated. The ensemble average images reveal the probability of cavitation appearance at a specific location within the nozzle and the micro-channel flow orifice. The standard deviation from the mean reveals locations with significant cycle-to-cycle variations of the flow. These are linked to significant deviations from the mean of the fuel spray dispersion angle forming downstream of the nozzle exit...|$|R
40|$|Calculation and {{experimental}} {{determination of the}} fluid flow through the hydraulic valves can be very complex and demanding process. For the experimental determination of the fluid flow, {{as well as other}} physical and kinematic-dynamic properties of fluids, such as density, temperature, speed, pressure drop, a range of different methods and also expensive measuring devices are required. In addition to this, realization of the experiment requires a longer period of time. Therefore, numerical simulations are increasingly used by engineers nowadays, not only to reduce costs but also the time required for new product development. Using numerical simulations, this paper presents the calculation of flow and pressure drop in the flow of hydraulic oil through a <b>valve</b> with <b>seat</b> <b>area</b> type A 10 FS 1. 0364. Obtained results were compared with analytical {{and experimental}} values (from a catalogue). Observed 3 D model of the valve was created in SolidWorks software, and the numerical simulations of the mentioned characteristics were done using SolidWorks Flow Simulation. After the calculation performed in the software, the results of pressure drop depending on the flow were presented in a diagram and compared with experimental and analytically calculated values. The main goal {{of this paper is to}} present the possibility of applying numerical simulations to solve the problem of calculation and determination of the fluid flow through the various hydraulic valves, which allows faster determination of the flow, reduces costs and time for new product development...|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} ways in which a <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> may be {{improperly}} positioned or machined. These include incomplete seating during the press fitting-step, distortion of the nominally circular <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> surfaces such they deviate unacceptably from perfect roundness or waviness, tilt of the machined surfaces relative to the valve guide hole axis, deviation of the <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> surfaces from concentricity with the valve guide holes, and deviation of the machined conical section of the <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> from the cone angle that is required to match the valve surface. Automated quality control of inserted and machined <b>valve</b> <b>seats</b> has traditionally been very difficult to achieve until the advent of digital holography which has enabled high-definition metrology for measuring all of these listed deviations.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} {{problem with the}} CVH is the {{tendency}} to drop a <b>valve</b> <b>seat,</b> which most often happens in vin number P engines, due to the steel PM <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> inserts in the aluminum head. (the 2000-2004 Ford Focus with the 2.0L CVH/SPI SOHC engine and also seen in 1991-2002 Ford Escorts). These engines usually drop a <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> with no warning, even if the engine has been well maintained. In most cases, a seat drops on the number 4 cylinder, with the next most common being the number 2 cylinder (this peculiarity {{may have something to}} do with the engines secondary harmonics) [...] With the factory <b>valve</b> <b>seats,</b> the typical life of the 2.0L SPI in a Focus is about 100 to 120k miles, but it can happen as early as 70k miles. When the <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> drops out of the cylinder head, it falls into the cylinder and damages the piston and cylinder head. In some cases, the <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> is drawn from its cylinder through the intake manifold into another cylinder until it is obliterated. A <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> dropping into the cylinder can scar the cylinder wall and bend the piston connecting rods.|$|R
40|$|<b>Valve</b> <b>seat</b> inserts {{are one of}} {{the vital}} part of the valve train in {{internal}} combustion engines, as they are the interface between the valve and the cylinder head. <b>Valve</b> and <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> embeds together serve to seal off the combustion chamber regulating the inlet and exhaust gases. The <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> insert avoids immediate contact of the valve with the cylinder head and absorbs part of the combustion heat which is transfered to the valve by passing it on to the cylinder head. Therefore, misalignment of the <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> during manufacturing could result in engine failure. This project proposes a <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> insert misalignment measurement using the concept of eddy current inspection method. Eddy current inspection method permit flaw detection in a large variety of conductive materials, either ferromagnetic or non-ferromagnetic. Simulation to study the change in induced current density and magnetic density around the <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> and cylinder head due to the magnetic field generated by an exciting coil was conduct using COMSOL Multiphysics 4. 4.

40|$|Since 1997 {{numerous}} fires {{have been}} reported to the Food and Drug Administration involving cylinder valves installed on medical use oxygen cylinders sold and operated within the United States. All of the cylinder valves in question had polychlorotrifluoroethylene (PCTFE) <b>valve</b> <b>seats.</b> Subsequent failure analysis showed that the main seat was the primary source of ignition. A review of the incidents involving cylinder valve fires indicated three possible ignition mechanisms: contaminant promotion, flow friction, and resonance. However, gas purity analysis showed that uncombusted, residual oxygen was within specification. Infrared and energy dispersive spectroscopy further showed that no contaminants or organic compounds were present in the remaining, uncombusted <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> material or on seat plug surfaces. Therefore, contaminant-promoted ignition {{did not appear to be}} responsible for the failures. Observations of extruded material along the outer edge of the coined or loaded <b>seat</b> <b>area</b> produced by cylinder overuse or poppet overload led to concerns that accelerated gas flow across a deformed seat surface could generate enough localized heating to ignite the polymeric seat. Low molecular weight or highly amorphous quick-quenched PCTFE grades might be expected to be especially prone to this type of deformation. Such a failure mechanism has been described as flow friction; however, the corresponding mechanistic parameters are poorly understood. Subsequent revelation of low-temperature dimensional instability by thermomechanical analysis (TMA) in a variety of PCTFE sheet and rod stock samples led to new concerns that PCTFE <b>valve</b> <b>seats</b> could undergo excessive expansion or contraction during service. During expansion, additional extrusion and accompanying flow friction could occur. During contraction, a gap between the seal and adjacent metal surfaces could form. Gas flowing past the gap could, in turn, lead to resonance heating and subsequent ignition as described in ASTM Guide for Evaluation Nonmetallic Materials for Oxygen Service (G 63). Attempts to uncover the origins of the observed dimensional instability were hindered by uncertainties about resin grade, process history, and post-process heat history introduced by machining, annealing, and sample preparation. An approach was therefore taken to monitor property changes before and after processing and machining using a single, well-characterized lot of Neoflon CTFE. 1 M 400 H resin. A task group consisting of the current PCTFE resin supplier, two molders, and four <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> manufacturers was formed, and phased testing on raw resin, intermediate rod stock, and finished <b>valve</b> <b>seats</b> initiated. The effect of processing and machining on the properties of PCTFE rod stock and oxygen gas cylinder <b>valve</b> <b>seats</b> was then determined. Testing focused on two types of extruded rod stock and one type of compression-molded rod stock. To accommodate <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> manufacturer preferences for certain rod stock diameters, two representative diameters were used (4. 8 mm (0. 1875 in.) and 19. 1 mm (0. 75 in.)). To encompass a variety of possible sealing configurations, seven different <b>valve</b> <b>seat</b> types with unique geometries or machining histories were tested. The properties investigated were dimensional stability as determined by TMA, specific gravity, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), compressive strength, zero strength time, and intrinsic viscosity.
