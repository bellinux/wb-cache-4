In the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), mechanical vibration diagnosis of rotating machinery has been carried out, and got good results. However, in some cases, abnormal condition of machine at an initial stage couldn’t specify, or a machine’s life didn’t predict, because of diagnosing only by tendency of <b>vibration</b> <b>severity.</b> Mechanical vibration diagnoses are typical diagnosing method on the operating condition of the rotating machines, which are well {{known as one of}} the Condition Based Maintenance (CBM). It has already been established theoretically, however the actual activities of the vibration diagnosis are required special experiences, especially for the prediction of abnormal condition of rotating machine such as imbalance, and misalignment, and also prediction of bearing failures, etc [...] These diagnostics have been used for about 30 years in various fields of industries.

40|$|When bending {{sharp and}} Jagged edges of {{materials}} and riveting different components of the cars structures, pneumatic hammers generate noise and <b>vibration.</b> The <b>severity</b> of the noise as a potential operator hazard {{should be considered in}} light of the following data. The noise produced by the six studied hammers is impact noise with more than 20 impulses per second. The average peak pressure level is 131. 9 dB with the standard deviation of 2. 1 dB. The equivalent level during a shift work, 8 hours per day, is 114 dB. Hand-arm vibration has also been measured in each applicable direction (x,y,z). The Z direction is the principal direction that vibration enters the hand. The average effective acceleration is 23. 5 m/s 2 and the standard deviation is 15. 2 m/s 2. The total exposure time during a shift is about 6 - 30 minutes which intermittently included 30 - 60 seconds. The measured levels correlate with operator exposures exceeding the allowable exposure time and the permissible values.

40|$|Abstract: Fore-and-aft {{vibration}} of {{a backrest}} can influence discomfort {{and the risk}} of injury associated with wholebody vibration. Relevant standards (BS 6841 : 1987 and ISO 2631 - 1 : 1997) recommend the Wc frequency weighting for evaluating fore-and-aft vibration of backrests, but do not specify the precise location for measuring vibration. This study determined equivalent comfort contours for fore-and-aft vibration of the backs of seated persons from 2 to 80 Hz using the method of magnitude estimation, examining the effect of input location, contact area, and body posture. The equivalent comfort contours indicate decreased sensitivity to vibration acceleration at frequencies greater than 8 Hz. Equivalent comfort contours with a full backrest were similar to those with contact at only the highest location on the back. The derived frequency weightings are broadly consistent with frequency weighting Wc but suggest somewhat greater sensitivity at frequencies greater than 30 Hz and vary in shape with changes in vibration magnitude. It is concluded that with low and moderate magnitudes of <b>vibration</b> the <b>severity</b> of fore-and-aft <b>vibration</b> of a backrest can be assessed from the frequency-weighted fore-and-aft acceleration measured at the highest point of contact between the backrest and the body if the frequency weighting Wc is employed in the evaluation...|$|R

40|$|Gear {{tooth surface}} wear {{is a common}} failure mode. It occurs over {{relatively}} long periods of service nonetheless, it degrades operating efficiency and leads to other major failures such as excessive tooth removal and catastrophic breakage. To develop accurate wear detection and diagnosis approaches at the early phase of the wear, this paper examines the gear dynamic responses from both experimental and numerical studies with increasing extents of wear on tooth contact surfaces. An experimental test facility comprising of a back-to-back two-stage helical gearbox arrangement was used in a run-to-failure test, in which variable sinusoidal and step increment loads along with variable speeds were applied and gear wear was allowed to progress naturally. A comprehensive dynamic model was also developed to study the influence of surface wear on gear dynamic response, with the inclusion of time-varying stiffness and tooth friction based on elasto-hydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) principles. The model consists of an 18 degree of freedom (DOF) vibration system, which includes {{the effects of the}} supporting bearings, driving motor and loading system. It also couples the transverse and torsional motions resulting from time-varying friction forces, time varying mesh stiffness and the excitation of different wear <b>severities.</b> <b>Vibration</b> signatures due to tooth wear severity and frictional excitations were acquired for the parameter determination and the validation of the model with the experimental results. The experimental test and numerical model results show clearly correlated behaviour, over different gear sizes and geometries. The spectral peaks at the meshing frequency components along with their sidebands were used to examine the response patterns due to wear. The paper concludes that the mesh vibration amplitudes of the second and third harmonics as well as the sideband components increase considerably with the extent of wear and hence these can be used as effective features for fault detection and diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{study the}} {{relation}} between the prevalence of vascular disorders (white finger) and vibration exposure in a group of 222 forestry workers, of whom 164 (73. 9 %) had work experience limited to antivibration (AV) chain saws only and 58 (26. 1 %) had operated both non-AV and AV chain saws. METHODS [...] The chain saw operators and 195 control workers never exposed to hand transmitted vibration were interviewed with health and workplace assessment questionnaires. The diagnosis of vibration induced white finger (VWF) was {{made on the basis of}} subjective symptoms of finger blanching and the results of a cold test with plethysmographic measurement of systolic blood pressure of the finger. Vibration was measured on a representative sample of AV and non-AV chain saws. Daily vibration exposure was assessed as eight hour energy equivalent frequency weighted acceleration (A(8)). A lifetime vibration dose was estimated for each of the forestry workers. RESULTS [...] The overall prevalence of VWF among the forestry workers was 23. 4 %. The diagnosis of VWF was made in 13. 4 % of the forestry workers who handled only AV chain saws and in 51. 7 % of those who had also operated non-AV chain saws in the past. Raynaud's phenomenon was found in 2. 6 % of the controls. In the forestry workers, the risk for VWF showed positive increments with each increment of vibration dose, suggesting a monotonic dose-response relation. The responsiveness to cold in the digital arteries of the forestry workers was also found to increase with increasing <b>vibration</b> dose and <b>severity</b> of VWF. The estimated relation between VWF and vibration exposure showed that the expected prevalence of VWF increased almost linearly to either A(8) (with exposure duration unchanged) or the number of years of exposure (with equivalent acceleration unchanged). CONCLUSIONS [...] In this study of VWF among forestry workers, the estimated dose-response relation showed that if the magnitude of vibration acceleration is doubled, the total duration of exposure should be halved to produce an equivalent effect. On the basis of the assessment of vibration exposure, the estimated risk for VWF in the study population was found to be lower than that predicted by the international standard ISO 5349. These findings suggest a revision of the risk estimates for VWF currently provided by ISO 5349...|$|R
40|$|Prolonged {{exposure}} to vehicular vibration and shocks has {{been related to}} discomfort, reduced work efficiency and various health and safety risks for the drivers, specifically for the off-road vehicle drivers. Enhancement of shock and vibration environment of such vehicles involves characterization of vibration environment, biodynamic response of the driver, design and analysis of secondary suspension, and seating dynamics. Relationships between biodynamic measures are derived through analysis of measured data and selected biodynamic models. The magnitude of variations in subject characteristics and test conditions can be significantly reduced by representing 'to-the-body' biodynamic characteristics in terms of apparent mass (APMS) and by identifying a range of test conditions applicable to off-road vehicle driving. It is further shown that normalized APMS correlates well with the 'through the body' biodynamic function, {{expressed in terms of}} seat-to-head transmissibility (STHT). A synthesis of reported data is performed to propose a range of idealized biodynamic response characteristics. A three degree-of-freedom biodynamic model of the occupant is developed using measured response characteristics. Occupant-seat interactions are investigated through measurement and analysis of contact force and area. The results are utilized to propose a nonlinear and asymmetric seat cushion model. A nonlinear suspension seat model is further developed to incorporate asymmetric force-velocity and nonlinear force-deflection characteristics of the damper and elastic end-stops, respectively. A combined human-suspension seat model is finally derived upon integrating the proposed occupant, cushion and suspension models. The results show that the model is an effective tool for assessment of seating dynamic comfort and whole-body vibration exposure. The results of a comprehensive parametric study clearly revealed that attenuation of continuous and shock-type excitations pose conflicting design requirements. It is thus proposed to develop suspension design for optimal attenuation of continuous <b>vibration,</b> while the <b>severity</b> of end-stop impacts caused by shock-type excitations be minimized through design of optimal buffers. The suspension performance under continuous and shock excitations is assessed in terms of Seat Effective Amplitude Transmissibility (SEAT) and Vibration Dose Value (VDV) ratio, respectively. Two different optimization problems are formulated to minimize the SEAT and VDV ratios. The results suggest that soft and lightly damped suspension with low degree of damping asymmetry coupled with low friction and large mass can enhance vibration isolation performance. Thick and soft elastic buffers with linear stiffness characteristics result in low VDV ratio response. The proposed design with optimal suspension and buffer parameters yields considerable reduction in both SEAT and VDV ratio response under selected classes of excitation...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} the changes over a workshift in fingertip tactile perception thresholds in users of impact wrenches exposed to intermittent hand transmitted vibration. A further {{aim was to}} assess the relation between acute changes in tactile sensation, sensorineural disorders, and vibration dose. METHODS: The study populations consisted of 30 workers exposed to vibration (16 men and 14 women) and 25 control manual workers (10 men and 15 women). Sensorineural disorders in the fingers and hands were graded according to the staging system of the Stockholm workshop scale. Tactile function was tested by measuring aesthesiometric thresholds (two point discrimination and depth sense perception) and vibrotactile perception thresholds at 16, 31. 5, and 125 Hz before and after a workshift. Temporary threshold shift was then calculated as the difference between threshold measures before and after the shift. The measurement and assessment of exposure to vibration were made according to the international standard ISO 5349. The vibration dose accumulated over a workshift (m 2 s- 4 h) was estimated for each user of impact wrenches. Daily exposure to vibration was also expressed in terms of eight hour energy equivalent frequency weighted acceleration ((ahw) eq(8) in ms- 2 rms). RESULTS: After adjustment for age and alcohol consumption, vibrotactile perception thresholds before exposure were greater in the workers exposed to vibration than in the controls. No differences in aesthesiometric thresholds before the shift were found between the study groups. Sensorineural disorders were mild in the workers exposed to vibration and minor neurological abnormalities were detected at the physical examination. Owing to the intermittent use of impact wrenches, the estimated mean (ahw) eq(8) for the subjects exposed to vibration was low (1. 3 ms- 2 rms). A significant temporary threshold shift in vibration perception at all test frequencies was found in the workers exposed to vibration but not in the controls. A significant increase in depth sense perception thresholds was found in the men exposed to vibration. The temporary threshold shift in vibration perception at 125 Hz, {{and to a lesser extent}} at 16 and 31. 5 Hz, was associated with the severity of sensorineural disorders. In the workers exposed to vibration the temporary threshold shift in vibration sense at all test frequencies was positively related to the estimated dose of vibration received over a workshift. No significant relation was found between aesthesiometric threshold changes and vibration dose. CONCLUSIONS: Intermittent exposure to hand transmitted vibration over a workshift can cause a deterioration of tactile perception in the fingers of users of impact wrenches. Acute tactile dysfunction was related to both the estimated dose of <b>vibration</b> and the <b>severity</b> of sensorineural symptoms. The temporary threshold shift in vibration perception suggested that fast adapting skin mechanoreceptors such as Pacinian and Meissner corpuscles were mainly involved in the acute sensory impairment to the fingertips of the workers exposed to vibration. Changes in tactile perception can occur in workers with daily exposure to vibration that is considered to be associated with a minimal risk of adverse health effects induced by vibration...|$|R

The effects of three factors influencing the vibration annoyance are analysed: (1) <b>vibration</b> <b>severity,</b> (2) number of trains passing and (3) the simultaneous noise level. Additionally the results of the field investigation are discussed from the aspect of possible vibration guideline values. The statistical analyses of the various data (such as vibration load, noise level and sociopsychological data) showed: the overall relationship between vibration intensity and annoyance is rather weak. Furthermore the effect of vibration intensity is smaller for people suffering from simultaneous higher noise levels than for those suffering from lower noise levels (vibration x noise interaction). It is proposed that vibration guideline values should not be based on the vibration levels of the maximum individual occurences, but rather on reference values based on the energetic mean value of all vibrations occuring during the period under consideration.

40|$|The {{vibration}} in 100 different vehicles {{has been}} measured, evaluated and assessed according to British Standard BS 6841 (1987) and International Standard ISO 2631 (1997). Vibration {{was measured in}} 14 categories of vehicle including cars, lift trucks, tractors, lorries, vans and buses. In each vehicle, the vibration was measured in five axes: vertical vibration beneath the seat, fore-and-aft, lateral and vertical vibration on the seat pan and fore-and-aft vibration at the backrest. The alternative methods of evaluating the vibration (use of different frequency weightings, different averaging methods, the inclusion of different axes, vibration dose values and equivalent r. m. s. acceleration) as defined in the standards have been compared. BS 6841 (1987) suggests that an equivalent acceleration magnitude is calculated using vibration measured at four locations around the seat (x -, y -, z -seat and x -backrest); ISO 2631 (1997) suggests that vibration is measured in the three translational axes only on the seat pan but only the axis with the most severe vibration is used to assess <b>vibration</b> <b>severity.</b> Assessments made using the procedure defined in ISO 2631 tend to underestimate any risks from exposure to whole-body vibration compared to an evaluation made using the guidelines specified in BS 6841; the measurements indicated that the 17 m/s 1. 75 "health guidance caution zone" in ISO 2631 was {{less likely to be}} exceeded than the 15 m/s 1. 75 "action level" in BS 6841.

40|$|Methods of measuring, {{evaluating}} {{and assessing}} whole-body vibration and repeated shock {{are offered in}} ISO 2631 (1974, 1985), BS 6841 (1987), and ISO 2631 (1997). This paper presents a comparison of guidance on {{the health effects of}} vibration and repeated shock given in these standards. International Standard 2631 (1974, 1985) offered a set of exposure limits. British Standard 6841 (1987) defines a measurement and evaluation procedure (based on frequency weightings and the vibration dose value, VDV), gives an action level {{that can be used to}} assess <b>vibration</b> <b>severity,</b> and mentions some appropriate actions (consideration of the fitness of exposed persons, design of safety precautions, regular health checks). International Standard 2631 (1997) is unclear in several important areas: which body postures and axes are to be assessed; whether evaluations of multi-axis vibration should be based on the "worst axis" or a combination of the frequency-weighted acceleration in all axes; why a new frequency weighting, W k, is proposed for vertical vibration when it is almost within the error tolerance of an existing weighting, W b; why a 1 · 4 multiplying factor is used to evaluate vibration with respect to health but not with respect to comfort; how to choose between different time-dependencies (overall r. m. s., VDV, running r. m. s., and no time-dependency); allowing use of either the maximum value of a running r. m. s. (i. e., MTVV) or the VDV; allowing different averaging periods when calculating the MTVV; using the crest factor to choose between r. m. s. and either the VDV or MTVV methods; defining two inconsistent criteria for deciding whether to use either the VDV or MTVV methods; giving no guidance on how MTVV values should be assessed; including two very different "health guidance caution zones" (for interpreting r. m. s. and VDV measures); providing ambiguous wording for the health guidance caution zones. Very different conclusions can be reached according to what is measured, how the vibration is evaluated and how it is assessed according to ISO 2631 (1997). However, even though it employs a slightly different frequency weighting for vertical vibration, and a 1 · 4 multiplying factor for horizontal vibration, ISO 2631 (1997) can be interpreted so as to provide evaluations similar to those made according to BS 6841 (1987). It is concluded that the recently revised International Standard for measuring, evaluating and assessing human exposures to vibration and shock will cause unnecessary confusion. © 1998 Academic Press. </p...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{operation}} of PS 09 SR module in 2007, {{it has been observed}} that there is vibration {{in various parts of the}} structures, on various segments of piping, and on appurtenance items. At DOT Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) request, ORNL Subject Matter Experts support PHMSA in its review and analysis of the observed vibration phenomenon. The review and analysis consider possible effects of pipeline design features, vibration characteristics, machinery configuration, and operating practices on the structural capacity and leak tight integrity of the pipeline. Emphasis is placed on protection of welded joints and machinery against failure from cyclic loading. A series of vibration measurements were carried out by the author during the site visit to PS 09, the power of the operating pump during the data collection is at about 2970 KW, which is less than that of APSC's vibration data collected at 3900 KW. Thus, a first order proportional factor of 4900 / 2970 was used to project the measured velocity data to that of APSC's measurement of the velocity data. It is also noted here that the average or the peak-hold value of the measured velocity data was used in the author's reported data, and only the maximum peak-hold data was used in APSC's reported data. Therefore, in some cases APSC's data is higher than the author's projective estimates that using the average data. In general the projected velocity data are consistent with APSC's measurements; the examples of comparison at various locations are illustrated in the Table 1. This exercise validates and confirms the report vibration data stated in APSC's summary report.
