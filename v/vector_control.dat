Mating with wild females reduces the wild population in the subsequent generation; repeated releases eventually eliminate the target population.|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of a suite of traits under a range of environmental conditions is necessary to fully examine costs of resistance. I compared phenological, morphological and reproductive traits of several independent lines of a transgenic methyl jasmonate-overproducing Arabidopsis thaliana plant (JMT plants) to that of <b>vector</b> <b>controls</b> in high and low soil nutrient environments. JMT plants constitutively express a suite of responses normally inducible by wounding or jasmonate. JMT plants showed a marked delay in flowering time, and were larger with more leaves at bolting than <b>vector</b> <b>controls.</b> These traits also responded more positively to increased nutrients in JMT plants than in <b>vector</b> <b>controls.</b> At {{the end of the}} season, total seed mass and seed number was lower in JMT plants than in <b>vector</b> <b>controls</b> overall, and these traits responded much less positively to nutrient addition in JMT plants than in <b>vector</b> <b>controls.</b> This study revealed delayed phenology as a novel cost of resistance in Arabidopsis and that overproduction of methyl jasmonate and associate responses can substantially constrain fitness responses to nutrients. These results establish a mechanism whereby costs of resistance can be more apparent under high resource conditions, rather than under low resource conditions, as is widely assumed...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of thrust vectoring on civil transport aircraft {{has only been}} studied by a few individuals. Quantified investigations need {{to be carried out}} to search for the potential benefits of the {{application of}} thrust <b>vectoring</b> <b>control</b> on a civil transport aircraft. Blended Wing Body configuration is a novel aircraft concept. Due to the absence of conventional tails longitudinal controllability become part of the key challenges of this configuration. It is therefore the objective of this thesis project to carry out quantified flight mechanics analyses on the effectiveness of controlling a Blended Wing Body aircraft with vectoring thrust. As a starting point flight mechanics simulations under steady level flight conditions in longitudinal plane are conducted in this project. Through this project a thrust vectoring model, which contains the calculation of nozzle deflection angles based on nozzle deflection controls and the calculation of engine thrust loss due to nozzle deflections, is developed and embedded in a flight mechanics toolbox used for the flight mechanics simulations. The flight mechanics simulations of thrust <b>vectoring</b> <b>control</b> are then carried out with a series of nozzle deflections, flight conditions, aircraft mass and CG locations. From the simulation results it is investigated that for the Blended Wing Body configuration tested in this project, thrust <b>vectoring</b> <b>control</b> under steady level flight conditions is much less effective than the conventional aerodynamic control surfaces. The maximum effectiveness ratio between thrust <b>vectoring</b> <b>control</b> and conventional aerodynamic control surfaces obtained in this project is about 11. 2 %. With extensive flight mechanics simulations, the way that aircraft flight conditions, mass and CG locations affect the effectiveness of thrust <b>vectoring</b> <b>control</b> is analysed through this project.

5|$|Malaria {{has been}} {{successfully}} eliminated or greatly reduced in certain areas. Malaria was once common in the United States and southern Europe, but <b>vector</b> <b>control</b> programs, {{in conjunction with the}} monitoring and treatment of infected humans, eliminated it from those regions. Several factors contributed, such as the draining of wetland breeding grounds for agriculture and other changes in water management practices, and advances in sanitation, including greater use of glass windows and screens in dwellings. Malaria was eliminated from most parts of the USA in the early 20th century by such methods, {{and the use of the}} pesticide DDT and other means eliminated it from the remaining pockets in the South in the 1950s as part of the National Malaria Eradication Program.

Since the 1980s, though, the number of yellow fever cases has been increasing again, and A. aegypti {{has returned to the}} urban centers of South America.

25|$|The main way {{to prevent}} malaria is through <b>vector</b> <b>control.</b> There are mostly three main forms that the vector can be controlled: (1)insecticide-treated {{mosquito}} nets, (2)indoor residual spraying and (3)antimalarial drugs. Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLNs) are the preferred method of control {{because it is the}} most cost effective. The WHO is currently strategizing how to ensure that the net is properly maintained to protect people at risk. The second option is indoor residual spraying and has been proven effective if at least 80% of the homes are sprayed. However, such method is only effective for 3-6months. A drawback to these two methods, unfortunately, is that mosquito resistance against these insecticides has risen. National malaria control efforts are undergoing rapid changes to ensure the people are given the most effective method of <b>vector</b> <b>control.</b> Lastly, antimalarial drugs {{can also be used to}} prevent infection from developing into a clinical disease.

25|$|WHO's anti-malaria {{campaign}} of the 1950s and 1960s {{relied heavily on}} DDT {{and the results were}} promising, though temporary in developing countries. Experts tie malarial resurgence to multiple factors, including poor leadership, management and funding of malaria control programs; poverty; civil unrest; and increased irrigation. The evolution of resistance to first-generation drugs (e.g. chloroquine) and to insecticides exacerbated the situation. Resistance was largely fueled by unrestricted agricultural use. Resistance and the harm both to humans and the environment led many governments to curtail DDT use in <b>vector</b> <b>control</b> and agriculture. In 2006 WHO reversed a longstanding policy against DDT by recommending that it be used as an indoor pesticide in regions where malaria is a major problem.|$|E

25|$|When it was {{introduced}} in World War II, DDT was effective in reducing malaria morbidity and mortality. WHO's anti-malaria campaign, which consisted mostly of spraying DDT and rapid treatment and diagnosis to break the transmission cycle, was initially successful as well. For example, in Sri Lanka, the program reduced cases from about one million per year before spraying to just 18 in 1963 and 29 in 1964. Thereafter the program was halted to save money and malaria rebounded to 600,000 cases in 1968 and {{the first quarter of}} 1969. The country resumed DDT <b>vector</b> <b>control</b> but the mosquitoes had evolved resistance in the interim, presumably because of continued agricultural use. The program switched to malathion, but despite initial successes, malaria continued its resurgence into the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Before DDT, {{eliminating}} mosquito {{breeding grounds}} by drainage or poisoning with Paris green or pyrethrum was sometimes successful. In {{parts of the}} world with rising living standards, the elimination of malaria was often a collateral benefit of the introduction of window screens and improved sanitation. A variety of usually simultaneous interventions represents best practice. These include antimalarial drugs to prevent or treat infection; improvements in public health infrastructure to diagnose, sequester and treat infected individuals; bednets and other methods intended to keep mosquitoes from biting humans; and <b>vector</b> <b>control</b> strategies such as larvaciding with insecticides, ecological controls such as draining mosquito breeding grounds or introducing fish to eat larvae and indoor residual spraying (IRS) with insecticides, possibly including DDT. IRS involves the treatment of interior walls and ceilings with insecticides. It is particularly effective against mosquitoes, since many species rest on an indoor wall before or after feeding. DDT is one of 12 WHO–approved IRS insecticides.|$|E
25|$|By October 1945, DDT was {{available}} for public sale in the United States. Although it was promoted by government and industry for use as an agricultural and household pesticide, there were also concerns about its use from the beginning. Opposition to DDT was focused by the 1962 publication of Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring. It cataloged environmental impacts that coincided with widespread use of DDT in agriculture in the United States, and it questioned the logic of broadcasting potentially dangerous chemicals into the environment with little prior investigation of their environment and health effects. The book claimed that DDT and other pesticides had been shown to cause cancer and that their agricultural use {{was a threat to}} wildlife, particularly birds. Its publication was a seminal event for the environmental movement and resulted in a large public outcry that eventually led, in 1972, to a ban on DDT's agricultural use in the United States. A worldwide ban on agricultural use was formalized under the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, but its limited and still-controversial use in disease <b>vector</b> <b>control</b> continues, because of its effectiveness in reducing malarial infections, balanced by environmental and other health concerns.|$|E
