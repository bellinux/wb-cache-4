50|$|The International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development (ICTSD) is an {{independent}} think-and-do-tank, engaged {{in the provision of}} information, research and analysis, and policy and multistakeholder dialogue, as a not-for-profit organisation based in Geneva, Switzerland. Established in 1996, ICTSD’s mission is to ensure that trade and investment policy and frameworks advance sustainable development in the global economy. Since 1997, ICTSD is the publisher of BRIDGES and a suite of regional periodicals in English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Russian and Chinese, including BioRes, BRIDGES AFRICA, Puentes, Passerelles, Pontes, мосты Mosti and 桥 Ciao. Since 1996, and since 2003 in a major Trade and Development Symposium format, ICTSD organises coalitions of knowledge organisations working on trade policy and global issues to offer the most comprehensive platform and opportunity for dialogue alongside WTO biannual ministerial conferences. Since Bali in 2013, it also convenes a biannual WTO Business Forum, cosponsored by major business associations including the International Chamber of Commerce, ICC. In 2011, ICTSD launched the E15 Initiative, now jointly implemented with the World Economic Forum, convening 400 of the world's top experts to look into the issues confronting the global economy and the international trade and investment systems. Among its initiatives for policy reform on several fronts, ICTSD formed the SETI Alliance as a public-private consortium to complement its campaign for robust, efficient markets that support massive scale-up of the diffusion and use of clean energy technologies, to address climate change, energy access and poverty, and energy security. It has also formed a consortium with the Inter-American Development Bank and the Asian Development Bank to establish the RTA Exchange, a major double platform on knowledge (interactive databases, research and information on a <b>virtual</b> <b>facility)</b> and systematic policy dialogues to review the rapidly changing world of trade and investment agreements and promote coherence in the global trade and investment architecture.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The <b>virtual</b> <b>facility</b> center {{program has}} been newly started under the Opto-mechatronics Education Resource Center (abbreviated as OERC) to {{concentrate}} limited resources with highly efficient use of countrywide equipment, instruments and facilities, and thus to facilitate the progress through partnership. The OERC, funded by the Ministry of Education of Taiwan government in 2001, which has been constituted by over seventy professors joined across from universities, has conducted the program since April 2003. As equipment, instruments, and facilities are crucial for lecturing, training, and hands-on practice as well as research, {{the purpose of the}} <b>virtual</b> <b>facility</b> center program is to gather and share as many equipment pieces as possible for common use within the OERC’s members. All the members through the partnership of the OERC are encouraged to share laboratory resources, thus enabling any member to gain access to instruments. The OERC achieved significant results in which the total value of accumulated instrumentations exceeds NTD 60 million (1 NTD ~ 1 / 33 USD) for 94 equipment pieces within 4 months. All equipment and instruments were categorized into five levels according to the value in purchases. Meanwhile, among those categories is the level 1 that includes 16 pieces in value beyond NTD 2 million each. Such a significant amount accounts for the sum of accumulated twenty-year annual instrumentation budgets of the OERC. In addition, there are 12 newly common laboratories that ar...|$|E

Knowledge summaries that act as intellectual roadmaps enhance access to basic specimen databases. A vital community of collections users energizes the network.

40|$|We define some {{interesting}} incentive issues {{that arise in}} the management of virtual infrastructures. We demonstrate that participants ’ decisions about the quantities of infrastructure that they will choose to contribute to a virtual organization can be greatly affected by the resource sharing policy that they know will be deployed when the system operates. Unless this policy is well-designed, agents will attempt to free-ride by contributing less resource than is desirable. Our novel contribution is the formulation of models for designing optimal management policies, an analysis that demonstrates the inadequacy of simple sharing policies, and proposals for some better ones. We find an optimal policy in a limit as the number of participants becomes large. We learn that simple policies may be far from optimal and that efficient policy design is not trivial; policy parameters play important role in optimizing the efficiency of <b>virtual</b> <b>facility</b> formation...|$|E

40|$|A {{critical}} {{aspect of}} international safeguards activities {{performed by the}} International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is the verification that facility design and construction (including upgrades and modifications) do not create opportunities for nuclear proliferation. These Design Information Verification activities require that IAEA inspectors compare current and past information about the facility to verify the operator’s declaration of proper use. The actual practice of DIV presents challenges to the inspectors due to {{the large amount of}} data generated, concerns about sensitive or proprietary data, the overall complexity of the facility, and the effort required to extract just the safeguards relevant information. Planned and anticipated facilities will (especially in the case of reprocessing plants) be ever larger and increasingly complex, thus exacerbating the challenges. This paper reports the results of a workshop held at the Idaho National Laboratory in March 2009, which considered technologies and methods to address these challenges. The use of 3 D Laser Range Finding, Outdoor Visualization System, Gamma-LIDAR, and <b>virtual</b> <b>facility</b> modeling, as well as methods to handle the facility data issues (quantity, sensitivity, and accessibility and portability for the inspector) were presented.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} productivity and reduce labor costs, most manufacturing companies have adopted automated systems (for instance, automated guided vehicles (AGVs), and robots) for performing material handling and transportation tasks in the production process. Two experiments were conducted to test the effect of varying the parameters of dynamic virtual and real objects on perception of hazard and risk. Experiment 1 investigates the effect of environmental factors such as speed of the dynamic virtual object, angle of approach, and distance between the subject and the virtual dynamic object under specific light intensity on perception of hazard in the workplace. A series of experiments considering a psychophysical approach and Stevens' Law were conducted. Experiment 2 studies and examines the impact of size, speed and types of robots, angle of approach, lighting condition and virtual accident exposure on human perception of hazard and risk of robot motion, perceived safe waiting time of robots during system halts and improper pauses of robot operations, and perceived maximum reach of robot arms in virtual and real workplaces. By applying virtual reality technology, the real workplace can be simulated in the virtual world for improvement of facility design. Analysis includes techniques such as sequential experiments to compare results in virtual and real environments. The comparison of the analyzed data in virtual and real environments helps to further determine the transferability of performance and perception from virtual reality to reality. Using the preliminary results from the integrated data in the sequential experiments, potential guidelines for using <b>virtual</b> <b>facility</b> layout in industry are discussed...|$|E

Therefore, this research proposes a scenario driven scheme to facilitate the modeling process for a virtual mechanism with emphasis on interaction capability. The method first analyzes design intentions with a finite state automaton, and then formalizes the design data into an objected-oriented system using UML. Finally, the system will generate editing instructions for the virtual environment.
