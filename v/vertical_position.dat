5|$|The {{facility}} was designed, as was its predecessor at Watten, to receive, process and launch V-2 rockets {{at a high}} rate. Trains carrying V-2s would enter {{the heart of the}} complex through the Ida rail tunnel, where they would be unloaded. A large number of V-2s could be stored in the side tunnels; LOX would also be produced on-site ready for use. When the time came, the rockets would be moved into the octagonal preparation chamber where they would be lifted to a <b>vertical</b> <b>position</b> for fuelling and arming. From there they would be transported on motorised launch carriages, still in a <b>vertical</b> <b>position,</b> through the Gustav and Gretchen passageways. The launch pads were located {{at the end of the}} track on the floor of the quarry, from where the missiles would be fired.|$|E
5|$|For {{some time}} {{researchers}} have been aware that pods of sperm whales may sleep for short periods, assuming a <b>vertical</b> <b>position</b> with their heads just below or at the surface. A 2008 study published in Current Biology recorded evidence that whales may sleep with {{both sides of the}} brain. It appears that some whales may fall into a deep sleep for about 7 percent of the time, most often between 6 p.m. and midnight.|$|E

Once the restraints are locked, the train seats are rotated forward 90 degrees into a horizontal position and the train is then dispatched from the station. When the train returns to the station, the seats rotate back down and the riders disembark for the next guests.|$|E
5|$|The docking-pit is a drydock-like port {{isolated}} from the lower canal basin by means of watertight gates and kept dry by means of water pumps. When the wheel stops with its arms in the <b>vertical</b> <b>position</b> {{it is possible for}} boats to enter and exit the lower caisson when the gates are open without flooding the docking-pit. The space below the caisson is empty.|$|E

5|$|Chris Hadfield, a Canadian Space Agency {{astronaut}} and STS-74 mission specialist, {{used the}} shuttle's robot arm to hoist the docking module {{out of the}} aft portion of the payload bay, rotated it to a <b>vertical</b> <b>position,</b> and moved it to within five inches of the Orbiter Docking System. At that point, the shuttle fired its downward steering jets and moved the shuttle toward the docking module. Once the two spacecraft were locked together, the docking ring on the Orbiter Docking System retracted, {{and a series of}} hooks and latches were engaged to ensure an airtight seal between the two spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|However, {{others argue}} that the Sun is {{currently}} close to the galactic plane, and yet the last great extinction event was 15 million years ago. Therefore, the Sun's <b>vertical</b> <b>position</b> cannot alone explain such periodic extinctions, and that extinctions instead occur when the Sun passes through the galaxy's spiral arms. Spiral arms are home not only to larger numbers of molecular clouds, whose gravity may distort the Oort cloud, but also to higher concentrations of bright blue giants, which live for relatively short periods and then explode violently as supernovae.|$|E
5|$|Mimesis is practised by {{animals such as}} {{the leafy}} sea dragon, Phycodurus eques, and the leaf scorpionfish, Taenianotus triacanthus, which {{resemble}} parts of plants, and gently rock their bodies as if swayed by a current. In the fish species Novaculichthys taeniourus, the rockmover or dragon wrasse, there is a striking difference in appearance between the adults and the juveniles. A juvenile Rockmover resembles a loose piece of sea weed. It swims in a <b>vertical</b> <b>position</b> with its head pointing downwards, and behaves {{in a way that}} perfectly resembles the movement of a piece of seaweed: moving {{back and forth in the}} surge, as if it was inanimate.|$|E

5|$|The pilot lay flat on {{the lower}} wing, as planned, to reduce {{aerodynamic}} drag. As a glide ended, the pilot was supposed to lower himself to a <b>vertical</b> <b>position</b> through {{an opening in the}} wing and land on his feet with his arms wrapped over the framework. Within a few glides, however, they discovered the pilot could remain prone on the wing, headfirst, without undue danger when landing. They made all their flights in that position for the next five years.|$|E
5|$|The wreck is {{generally}} intact although draped with snagged fishing nets. The aft turret, however, has fallen out off the ship. The <b>vertical</b> <b>position</b> of the wreck has inspired {{a new theory}} of her loss by nautical archaeologist Vello Mäss. He believes that Rusalka was taking on water forward, perhaps from a leak or through ventilation hatches and was bow-heavy when her captain {{decided to make a}} turn, possibly to return to Reval, and the ship capsized during the turn with her engines still running. Her forward speed and flooded forward hull meant that she descended vertically and drove her hull into the muddy sea bottom.|$|E
5|$|When a stem is developing, {{the fungus}} is {{negatively}} geotropic, {{so that if}} the axis of the stem is tilted by 90 degrees, it will return to a <b>vertical</b> <b>position</b> within 24 hours. The extending hyphae that form the cap are themselves diageotropic—they will grow {{at right angles to}} the direction of gravity. Finally, the spines are positively geotropic, and will re-orient themselves to point downward if the mushroom orientation changes. Because the second (cap formation) and third (spine formation) geotropic responses overlap, there is a brief period where two different geotropic responses are operating simultaneously. These geotropic transitions help ensure that the final alignment results in optimum spore dispersal.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Supine {{position}} {{may contribute}} to the loss of aerated lung volume in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We hypothesized that verticalization increases lung volume and improves gas exchange by reducing the pressure surrounding lung bases. DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective observational physiological study in a medical ICU. SUBJECTS AND INTERVENTION: In 16 patients with ARDS we measured arterial blood gases, pressure-volume curves of the respiratory system recorded from positive-end expiratory pressure (PEEP), and changes in lung volume in supine and <b>vertical</b> <b>positions</b> (trunk elevated at 45 degrees and legs down at 45 degrees). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: <b>Vertical</b> <b>positioning</b> increased PaO(2) significantly from 94 +/- 33 to 142 +/- 49 mmHg, with an increase higher than 40...|$|R
5|$|Armstrong and Ward {{transcribed}} intonation in {{a system}} where lines and dots correspond to stressed and unstressed syllables, respectively, and <b>vertical</b> <b>position</b> corresponds to pitch. Their method of transcribing intonation was anticipated by the one used in H. S. Perera and Daniel Jones's (1919) reader for Sinhalese, and the preface to Handbook of English Intonation notes an inspiration in Hermann Klinghardt's notation for intonation. Klinghardt said his book {{would have been impossible}} without Daniel Jones; his exercises also share similarities to Jones's intonation curves. Armstrong and Ward used a system of discrete dots and marks to mark the intonation contour because they found it easier for learners of English to follow than a continuous line.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the opinion}} of Mearns and White who {{investigated}} the wreck that this was unlikely as the damage was far too limited in scale, nor could it account for the outwardly splayed plates also observed in that area. Bill Jurens points {{out that there was}} no magazine of any kind at the location of the break and that the location of the break just forward of the forward transverse armoured bulkhead suggests that the ship's structure failed there as a result of stresses inflicted when the bow was lifted into the <b>vertical</b> <b>position</b> by the sinking stern section. Furthermore, the current position of the plates {{at the edge of the}} break only reflects their last position, not the direction that they first moved.|$|E
5|$|The flight muscles {{need to be}} kept at a {{suitable}} temperature for the dragonfly {{to be able to}} fly. Being cold-blooded, they can raise their temperature by basking in the sun. Early in the morning, they may choose to perch in a <b>vertical</b> <b>position</b> with the wings outstretched, while {{in the middle of the}} day, a horizontal stance may be chosen. Another method of warming up used by some larger dragonflies is wing-whirring, a rapid vibration of the wings that causes heat to be generated in the flight muscles. The green darner (Anax junius) is known for its long-distance migrations, and often resorts to wing-whirring before dawn to enable it to make an early start.|$|E

5|$|The {{larval stage}} of dragonflies lasts {{up to five}} years in large species, and between two months and three years in smaller species. When the naiad is ready to {{metamorphose}} into an adult, it stops feeding and makes its way to the surface, generally at night. It remains stationary with its head out of the water, while its respiration system adapts to breathing air, then climbs up a reed or other emergent plant, and moults (ecdysis). Anchoring itself firmly in a <b>vertical</b> <b>position</b> with its claws, its skin begins to split at a weak spot behind the head. The adult dragonfly crawls out of its larval skin, the exuvia, arching backwards when all but the tip of its abdomen is free, to allow its exoskeleton to harden. Curling back upwards, it completes its emergence, swallowing air, which plumps out its body, and pumping haemolymph into its wings, which causes them to expand to their full extent.|$|E
5|$|The {{shoulder}} of Acrocanthosaurus was {{limited in its}} range of motion {{compared to that of}} humans. The arm could not swing in a complete circle, but could retract (swing backwards) 109° from the vertical, so that the humerus could actually be angled slightly upwards. Protraction (swinging forward) was limited to only 24° past the vertical. The arm was unable to reach a <b>vertical</b> <b>position</b> when adducting (swinging downwards), but could abduct (swing upwards) to 9° above horizontal. Movement at the elbow was also limited compared to humans, with a total range of motion of only 57°. The arm could not completely extend (straighten), nor could it flex (bend) very far, with the humerus unable even to form a right angle with the forearm. The radius and ulna (forearm bones) locked together so that there was no possibility of pronation or supination (twisting) as in human forearms.|$|E
5|$|A {{spontaneous}} {{cerebrospinal fluid}} leak {{is one of}} several types of cerebrospinal fluid leaks and occurs due to the presence of one or more holes in the dura. A spontaneous CSF leak, as opposed to traumatically caused CSF leaks, arises idiopathically. A loss of CSF greater than its rate of production leads to a decreased volume inside the skull known as intracranial hypotension. Any CSF leak is most often characterized by orthostatic headaches — headaches that worsen in a <b>vertical</b> <b>position</b> and improve when lying down. Other symptoms can include neck pain or stiffness, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fatigue, and a metallic taste in the mouth (indicative of a cranial leak). A CT scan can identify the site of a cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Once identified, the leak can often be repaired by an epidural blood patch, an injection of the patient's own blood {{at the site of the}} leak, a fibrin glue injection or surgery. When the cause cannot be identified the set of symptoms is referred to as spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak syndrome (SCSFLS).|$|E

40|$|Two typical {{scrubber}} internals are {{studied in}} this thesis, inlet vane and wire mesh pads. A total of 8 wire mesh pads were studied at {{low and high}} pressure conditions. The inlet vane was studied at high pressure. The measurements performed at elevated pressures were performed at 20, 50 and 85 bars for a N 2 /Exxsol system {{as well as a}} synthetic natural gas mix. The mesh pads studied varied in height, specific surface area, wire packing density, wire diameter as well as porosity. Liquid holdup measurements were made at five <b>vertical</b> <b>positions</b> and in addition pressure drop and separation efficiency were measured. The results show variations in holdup profile depending on liquid load, pad geometry, running time, measuring position and interfacial properties. Droplet size measurements were also made for all wire mesh pads below and at flooding of the wire mesh pads. A new equation was developed that qualitatively describes aspects of wire mesh pad design and was used for developing correlations. A novel method for measuring flooding point was developed and flooding points for several inlet pipe liquid volume fractions were made. A correlation predicting flooding points in wire mesh pads at both low and high pressure was developed. Dry pressure drop for all wire mesh pads was also determined. A correlation predicting dry pressure drop for spiral wound pads was developed. A novel method for measuring scrubber efficiency above a inlet vane at varying <b>vertical</b> <b>positions</b> was developed. The separation efficiency was measured at five different <b>vertical</b> <b>positions</b> in a scrubber column with an inner diameter of 252 mm. In addition a column of 150 mm was investigated at one position. Liquid fraction measurements were made at two <b>vertical</b> <b>positions</b> to asses flow distribution. Droplet size measurements were also performed 127. 5 mm above the inlet vane. PhD i kjemisk prosessteknologiPhD in Chemical Engineerin...|$|R
