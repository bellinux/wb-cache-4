40|$|The {{impact of}} jumps, regime switches, and linearly {{changing}} correlation term structures on the risk management of basket options has been {{examined in this}} paper. First, {{the results show that}} there is an asymmetric correlation effect on the <b>value-at-risk</b> <b>of</b> basket options. Second, the time at which a correlation shock occurs during the life of an option is particularly important for hedged basket options. Finally, the square-rootof- time rule can lead to severe underestimation <b>of</b> <b>value-at-risk</b> for basket options with time-varying correlations – for some cases, even by a factor exceeding the minimum regulatory stress factor. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{practical}} and flexible method to introduce skewness in multivariate symmetric distributions. Applying this procedure to the multivariate Student density {{leads to a}} “multivariate skew-Student ” density, in which each marginal has a specific asymmetry coefficient.

40|$|Value at risk (VaR) is {{a measure}} for senior {{management}} that summarises the financial risk a company faces into one single number. In this paper, we consider the use of fuzzy histograms for quantifying the <b>value-at-risk</b> <b>of</b> a portfolio. It is shown {{that the use of}} fuzzy histograms provides a good method <b>of</b> <b>value-at-risk</b> estimation for a portfolio of stocks. The conditional parameters of the model are obtained through minimisation of a test statistic for a VaR back testing method. Evolutionary optimisation is used for this purpose. It is found that statistical back testing always accepts fuzzy histogram models, while the popular GARCH models may be rejected...|$|R

40|$|Generally, in the {{financial}} literature, the notion of quadratic VaR is implicitly confused with the Delta-Gamma VaR, because more authors dealt with portfolios that contained derivatives instruments.

40|$|International audienceMany risk {{measures}} {{can be found}} in the literature such as the Value-at-Risk and the Conditional Tail Expectation. In statistical terms, the <b>Value-at-Risk</b> is aquantile <b>of</b> the distribution of the variable of interest. In hydrology, the <b>Value-at-Risk</b> <b>of</b> the rainfall distribution is the return level. The Conditional Tail Expectation is the mean of the rainfalls larger than the Value-at-Risk. Here, we focus on the properties of these risk measures in case of extreme rainfall modeled by heavy-tailed distributions. In order to take into account the geographical factors, we also assume that these risk measures depend on a covariate. We present the theoretical properties of our estimators and we illustrate their behaviour on a real data set of daily rainfalls in the Cévennes-Vivarais region...|$|R
40|$|Normal {{distribution}} of the residuals is the traditional assumption in the classical multivariate time series models. Nevertheless it is not very often consistent with the real data.

We compare our proposed method to a conventional copula-GARCH model where the parameter of a Clayton copula is estimated via Canonical Maximum-Likelihood. The superiority of our proposed model is exemplified by analyzing a data sample of nine different financial portfolios. A comparison of the out-of-sample forecasting accuracy of both models confirms that our model yields economically significantly better Value-at-Risk forecasts than the competing parametric calibration strategy...|$|R

We derive bounds on the gap in the objective value between the true optimal and an approximate solution so obtained. We show that under certain regularity conditions the approximate optimal value converges to the true optimal at the canonical rate O(n− 1 / 2), where n represents the sample size. The constants in the expression are explicitly defined. ...|$|R
