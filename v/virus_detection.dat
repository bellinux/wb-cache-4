Such early detection may give physicians a significant lead time in treatment. The amount of virus ("viral load") in a patient can also be quantified by PCR-based DNA quantitation techniques (see below).|$|E

40|$|Influenza {{activity}} in Europe {{during the winter}} 2005 - 2006 started late January - early February 2006 and first occurred in the Netherlands, France, Greece and England. Subsequently, countries were affected in a random pattern across Europe and the period of influenza activity lasted {{till the end of}} April. In contrast to the winter seasons in the period 2001 - 2005, no west-east pattern was detected. In 12 out of 23 countries, the consultation rates for influenza-like illness or acute respiratory infection in the winter 2005 - 2006 were similar or higher than in the winter 2004 - 2005, despite a dominance of influenza B viruses that normally cause milder disease than influenza A viruses. In the remaining 11 countries the consultation rates were lower to much lower than in the winter 2004 - 2005. The highest consultation rates were usually observed among children aged 0 - 14. The circulating influenza virus types and subtypes were distributed heterogeneously across Europe. Although the figures for total <b>virus</b> <b>detections</b> in Europe indicated a predominance of influenza B virus (58 % of all <b>virus</b> <b>detections),</b> in many countries influenza B virus was predominant only early in the winter, whilst later there was a marked increase in influenza A <b>virus</b> <b>detections.</b> Among the countries where influenza A viruses were co-dominant with B viruses (9 / 29) or were predominant (4 / 29), the dominant influenza A subtype was H 3 in seven countries and H 1 in four countries. The vast majority of characterised influenza B viruses (90 %) were similar to the B/Victoria/ 2 / 87 lineage of influenza B viruses that re-emerged in Europe in the winter 2004 - 2005 but {{were not included in the}} vaccine for the influenza season 2005 - 2006. This might help to explain the dominance of influenza B viruses in many countries in Europe during the winter 2005 - 2006. The influenza A(H 3) and A(H 1) viruses were similar to the reference strains included in the 2005 - 2006 vaccine, A/California/ 7 / 2004 (H 3 N 2) and A/New Caledonia/ 20 / 99 (H 1 N 1), respectively. In conclusion, the 2005 - 2006 influenza epidemic in Europe was characterised by moderate clinical activity, a heterogeneous spread pattern across Europe, and a variable virus dominance by country, although an overall dominance of influenza B viruses that did not match the virus strain included in the vaccine was observed.

40|$|Commercial {{anti-virus}} scanners {{are generally}} signature based, that is, they scan for known patterns {{to determine whether}} a file is infected by a virus or not. To evade signature-based <b>detection,</b> <b>virus</b> writers have adopted code obfuscation techniques to create highly metamorphic computer viruses. Since metamorphic viruses change their appearance from generation to generation, signature-based scanners cannot detect all instances of such viruses. To combat metamorphic <b>viruses,</b> <b>detection</b> tools based on statistical analysis have been studied. A tool based on hidden Markov models (HMMs) was previously developed and the results are encouraging—it has been shown that metamorphic viruses created by a well-designed metamorphic engine can be detected using an HMM. In this project, we explore whether there are any exploitable weaknesses in this HMM-based detection approach. We create a highly metamorphic virus generating tool designed specifically to evade HMM-based detection. We then test our engine, showing that we can generate viral copies that cannot be detected using previously-developed HMM-based detection techniques.
