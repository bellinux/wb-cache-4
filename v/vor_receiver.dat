50|$|<b>VOR</b> <b>receiver</b> - navigational {{instrument}} on an aircraft {{that uses the}} VHF signal from VOR navigational beacons between 108 and 117.95 MHz to determine the direction to the beacon very accurately, for air navigation.|$|E
5000|$|The board {{considered}} it [...] "quite likely" [...] {{that after the}} turn the captain re-tuned first <b>VOR</b> <b>receiver</b> to the ILS frequency, as the instrument was found in this state after the crash. For {{the final stages of}} flight, the aircraft was not following any VOR signal; instead the autopilot was tracking the 221° heading the navigator had set earlier during the turn.The post-accident settings of the second <b>VOR</b> <b>receiver</b> showed that it was displaying the aeroplane's position relative to Maputo and was correctly set to the Maputo VOR frequency, but was apparently not being used to guide the autopilot nor was it being monitored by the crew.|$|E
50|$|At the time, aircrew {{fixed the}} {{position}} of their aircraft as being above Mont Blanc by taking a cross-bearing from one VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) as they flew along a track from another VOR. However, the accident aircraft departed Beirut with one of its <b>VOR</b> <b>receivers</b> unserviceable.|$|R

Antenna signals are sequentially sampled with single receiver and receiver output pulses are held for comparison of signals from outermost antennas with those of center antenna. System can be installed as redundant navigation system in case of failure of <b>VOR</b> <b>receivers...</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{board of}} enquiry blamed the captain {{for failing to}} react to the Ground Proximity Warning System. Others have claimed that the crew had set the <b>VOR</b> <b>receivers</b> to the wrong frequency, causing them to receive signals from a {{different}} airport, or even that a false beacon had been set-up to lure the plane off course. While there was widespread suspicion that the South African government was involved in the crash, no conclusive evidence has emerged.|$|R
50|$|GNSS {{systems have}} a lower {{transmitter}} cost per customer and provide distance and altitude data. Future satellite navigation systems, such as the European Union Galileo, and GPS augmentation systems are developing techniques to eventually equal or exceed VOR accuracy. However, low <b>VOR</b> <b>receiver</b> cost, broad installed base and commonality of receiver equipment with ILS are likely to extend VOR dominance in aircraft until space receiver cost falls to a comparable level. As of 2008 in the United States, GPS-based approaches outnumbered VOR-based approaches but VOR-equipped IFR aircraft outnumber GPS-equipped IFR aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|A {{worldwide}} land-based {{network of}} [...] "air highways", {{known in the}} US as Victor airways (below 18000 ft) and [...] "jetways" [...] (at and above 18,000 feet), was set up linking VORs. An aircraft can follow a specific path from station to station by tuning into the successive stations on the <b>VOR</b> <b>receiver,</b> and then either following the desired course on a Radio Magnetic Indicator, or setting it on a Course Deviation Indicator (CDI) or a Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI, a more sophisticated version of the VOR indicator) and keeping a course pointer centred on the display.|$|E
50|$|To see the {{differences}} in the coding systems, consider a VFR aircraft with a VHF communication radio, <b>VOR</b> <b>receiver</b> with glideslope for ILS approaches, ADF, a GPS and a pressure altitude reporting transponder. It would be coded as SG/C on an ICAO form and as /G on the FAA domestic form. Add a DME to the panel and the ICAO code becomes SDG/C while the FAA code remains /G. Then, if the ADF stops receiving the ICAO code becomes DGLOV/C while the FAA code remains /G. More letters with the ICAO format mean more information about the aircraft's radio navigation capability is available to the ATS controller than with the older FAA coding system.|$|E
50|$|Most {{aircraft}} {{equipped for}} instrument flight (IFR) {{have at least}} two <b>VOR</b> <b>receivers.</b> As well as providing a backup to the primary receiver, the second receiver allows the pilot to easily follow a radial to or from one VOR station while watching the second receiver to see when a certain radial from another VOR station is crossed, allowing the aircraft's exact position at that moment to be determined, and giving the pilot the option of changing to the new radial if they wish.|$|R
50|$|Discounting the {{possibility}} of a false VOR beacon, an analysis of which was included in an appendix, the board considered it probable that the flight crew had inadvertently set the first of two <b>VOR</b> <b>receivers</b> on board to the Matsapa VOR frequency. This error was made more likely by the poor design of the instruments, the absence of back lighting of the selected frequencies, the fact the two frequencies were unusually close, 112.7 MHz for Maputo and 112.3 MHz for Matsapa, and the similarity between the figures '7' and '3' on the Soviet instrumentation.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis work {{presents}} the validation of a modelling method for the characterisation of the VOR {{error in the}} presence of large scatterers. More specifically, wind turbines are considered because their increasing number makes their modelling a topical problem. Here, the electromagnetic perturbation due to the wind turbines is addressed by a method hybridising parabolic wave equation and physical optics. The <b>VOR</b> <b>receiver</b> is considered such that the overall method gives an estimation of the VOR error. This method is validated by comparisons with in-flight measurements performed in the same location before and after the erection of a wind farm...|$|E
40|$|Experiments on an {{automatic}} multisensor navigation concept are being {{conducted in a}} Cessna 402 B. The test system consists of VOR, DME, and air data sensors controlled by a Hewlett Packard 9820 A electronic calculator which processes the data and, {{by means of a}} four-state Kalman filter, outputs position and ground and wind velocities to a map display. Novel features which make such a system potentially low-cost include frequency-scanning operation of a single <b>VOR</b> <b>receiver</b> and a single DME transceiver and use of a shed-vortex true airspeed sensor. Results obtained during flight in a local area where six to eight DME NAVAIDS were receivable yielded better than 1 / 4 -mile accuracy...|$|E
2500|$|At 10:21 A.M. Eastern Time, the United {{aircraft}} advised its company {{radio operator}} {{that one of}} its <b>VOR</b> <b>receivers</b> had stopped working (although air-traffic controllers were not notified of the problem), making it harder to navigate in instrument conditions.

50|$|Abstract {{waypoints}} {{typically have}} only specified longitude and latitude or UTM coordinates plus the reference datum, {{and often a}} name if they are marked on charts, and are located using a radio navigation system such as a <b>VOR</b> or GPS <b>receiver.</b> A waypoint can be a destination, a fix along a planned course {{used to make a}} journey, or simply a point of reference useful for navigation.|$|R
5000|$|A Radio Magnetic Indicator (RMI) {{features}} a course arrow superimposed on a rotating card {{that shows the}} aircraft's current heading {{at the top of}} the dial. The [...] "tail" [...] of the course arrow points at the current radial from the station and the [...] "head" [...] of the arrow points at the reciprocal (180° different) course to the station. An RMI may present information from more than one <b>VOR</b> or ADF <b>receiver</b> simultaneously.|$|R
40|$|International audienceFor air {{transport}} navigation, VOR systems are crucial: they give to aircraft their direction {{with respect to}} North. However, this information can be deteriorated by nearby obstacles, which yield multipaths. Signals coming from unwanted directions are processed by the on-board <b>VOR</b> <b>receiver,</b> which modify the displayed bearing. In this context, we propose and validate a method hybridizing the parabolic equation method (PE) with physical optics (PO) to compute the VOR multipath error. The modelling follows four steps. First, the field is calculated on the wind turbines using PE. One PE simulation is performed for each wind turbine. Second, the currents on the scatterers are calculated from the PE incident field. Third, the field radiated by the currents is computed on the receiver by PO. Finally, a VOR error is applied by considering the multipaths and the direct field. With this method, simulations account for a possible hilly terrain and a generic model of wind turbines that includes dielectric blades. Besides, the output is the VOR error, which is easily interpretable for the {{air transport}} community. As an example, {{the case of a}} specific wind farm will be presented. This example will contain validations with flight inspection measurements...|$|E
