40|$|The XML-based {{interoperable}} characteristics make enhancing {{security for}} XML Web Services {{a lot different}} from that of the traditional network-based applications. SSL VPN gateways are usually used to provide security for traditional network-based applications, but not for Web Services. This thesis presents an integrated security solution for securing both traditional network-based applications and Web Services. The integrated security solution includes a VPN framework and a Web Services framework. Considering that we have already had an SSL <b>VPN</b> <b>gateway</b> developed by our lab, we take it as the motherboard of the solution and the VPN server of the gateway as the security functional part of the VPN framework. As the highlight of this thesis project, a Web Services security component, also the security functional part of the Web Services framework, has been developed, implemented and integrated with the SSL <b>VPN</b> <b>gateway</b> to get the integrated security solution. The problem of applying ECC over binary fields for XML security, SOAP message security and Web Services security to make the Web Services security component share the same set of ECC keys with the VPN server on the gateway has been studied. Tools for reading ECC keys and certificates from the BUL's key files have been developed. Methods to adopt the ECC key files to ensure security of Web Services have also been developed. To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous work on adopting ECC keys over binary fields for Web Services security. The integrated security solution we present in this thesis is the prototype of a network device that has functions of three gateways: a <b>VPN</b> <b>gateway,</b> a Web Services security gateway and a Web Services gateway...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are the {{preferred}} mechanism for securing sensitive traffic crossing public networks. Traditionally, configuration of <b>VPN</b> <b>gateways</b> {{has been done}} manually. However, static configuration of gateways is particularly problematic {{within the context of}} the Global Information Grid (GIG), the next-generation network of networks developed by the US government. For one, GIG VPNs are expected to consist of tens to hundreds of trusted networks, which is an order of magnitude greater than current deployments. Moreover, trusted networks that essentially comprise of units in the field (e. g. army companies or ships) need to be seamlessly connected to the GIG even while they are mobile. Our goal in this paper is to address the lack of scalability and support for mobility that exists in current VPNs. We do so by providing a dynamic routing protocol which <b>VPN</b> <b>gateways</b> use to securely advertise prefixes of their internal network to peering gateways. Our initial results show that our protocol can sustain VPNs comprising of roughly one thousand gateways with only moderate overhead. I...|$|R

40|$|Many {{enterprise}} sites utilise 802. 11 b/g {{technology to}} create an untrusted access network sitting outside their protected institutional IP network, with internal access allowed only through an IP-layer virtual private network (<b>VPN)</b> <b>gateway.</b> Often such networks do not implement link layer security, because of the known weaknesses of the IEEE's wired equivalent privacy (WEP). This results in a wireless network on which arbitrary people can establish themselves as hosts with arbitrary IP addresses. Although the enterprise IP network is protected by the <b>VPN</b> <b>gateway,</b> users of the wireless network can become victims of unscrupulous (or accidental) interception of their IP communication. Common Windows laptop (mis-) configurations often try and establish communications through a default gateway on the 192. 168 / 16 network. Anyone could configure another host as this default gateway on the enterprise 802. 11 b/g network and thus hijack a visitor's network connection without the visitor even realising. In this paper we test and confirm the plausibility of this attack in a University wireless LAN and present results from real world data, confirming the existence of users failing to reconfigure their visiting host and attempting to connect via possible malicious gateways. We then suggest possible mitigation techniques...|$|E
40|$|Virtual private {{networking}} (VPN) {{has become}} an increasingly important component of a collaboration environment because it ensures private, authenticated communication among participants, using existing collaboration tools, where users are distributed across multiple institutions and can be mobile. The majority of current VPN solutions {{are based on a}} centralized VPN model, where all IP traffic is tunneled through a <b>VPN</b> <b>gateway.</b> Nonetheless, there are several use case scenarios that require a model where end-to-end VPN links are tunneled upon existing Internet infrastructure in a peer-to-peer (P 2 P) fashion, removing the bottleneck of a centralized <b>VPN</b> <b>gateway.</b> We propose a novel virtual network — TinCan — based on peerto-peer private network tunnels. It reuses existing standards and implementations of services for discovery notification (XMPP), reflection (STUN) and relaying (TURN), facilitating configuration. In this approach, trust relationships maintained by centralized (or federated) services are automatically mapped to TinCan links. In one use scenario, TinCan allows unstructured P 2 P overlays connecting trusted end-user devices — while only requiring VPN software on user devices and leveraging online social network (OSN) infrastructure already widely deployed. This paper describes the architecture and design of TinCan and presents an experimental evaluation of a prototype supporting Windows, Linux, and Android mobile devices. Results quantify the overhead introduced by the network virtualization layer, and the resource requirements imposed on services needed to bootstrap TinCan links...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—CyberCIEGE is a {{sophisticated}} network security simulation packaged as {{a video game}} and used by educators {{around the world to}} enhance information assurance education and training at universities, community colleges, within the DoD, and in other government agencies. The CyberCIEGE game engine was recently expanded to include Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) features including certification authorities, selection of installed roots and cross certification. CyberCIEGE Virtual Private Network (<b>VPN)</b> <b>gateways,</b> <b>VPN</b> clients and email clients were then extended to incorporate the new PKI features. CyberCIEGE PKI abstractions are described in terms of player configuration choices and the consequences of these choices on network management and vulnerabilities. The CyberCIEGE game engine modifications include modeling of chains of trust and risks of cross certification schemes. The benefits of these enhancements include coherent integration of identity management technologies, ranging from the human interface through to the supporting distributed infrastructure, into scenarios. Benefits also include support for recent new scenarios focused on the PKI infrastructure, identity management, or both; and the ability to tie both identity management and PKI to concepts of identification, authentication, provenance, and access control.

40|$|Abstract—To {{securely}} exchange data over public networks, {{such as the}} Internet, organizations often utilize Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). However, {{relying on}} these potentially large overlay networks makes them vital targets for Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. Thus, recent approaches for VPN autoconfiguration address DoS resistance by employing distributed management algorithms. Nevertheless, there is no satisfying solution for time synchronization within VPNs that is designed for resistance against DoS as well as internal attacks. For example, Network Time Protocol (NTP) relies on hierarchical structures, and cannot comply with DoS resistance. Thus, {{in this article we}} present a novel, fully distributed and fault tolerant time synchronization approach, which is designed to be transparently integrated in <b>VPN</b> <b>gateways.</b> Combining diffusion-based roundtrip-synchronization with an internal attacker detection, the proposed mechanism is making a contribution to resilient VPN design. Simulation results reveal a robustness against rather powerful internal attackers. I...|$|R
