25|$|Recent {{research}} in the Netherlands by Dr. Dirk van Kampen has indicated that the authentic rhythm of Gregorian chant in the 10th century includes both proportional elements and elements that are in agreement with semiology.

If a language other than German is spoken in the home that was correlated with poor mathematical performance in other studies. However correlation does not imply causation and the ELEMENT-study revealed that if other factors were taken into account for the language spoken at home, this had no effect on mathematical performance.|$|E
25|$|During seed based {{restoration}} projects, it {{is generally}} recommended to source from local populations, to minimize the effects of maladaptation. One of the many challenges of restoration is that every species is different and requires different sourcing guidelines. Rather than putting strict distance recommendations, other guidelines recommend sourcing seeds to match similar environmental conditions. For example, sourcing for Castilleja levisecta found that farther source populations that matched similar environmental <b>variables</b> <b>were</b> better suited for the restoration project than closer source populations. Restoration guidelines vary drastically between states and agency. For example, Minnesota is broken up into 9 seed sourcing zones, where its neighbor Iowa, is broken into three latitudinal zones. US Forest Service recently developed provisional seed zones based {{on a combination of}} minimum winter temperature zones, aridity, and the Level III ecoregions.|$|E

25|$|While the photocopier-generated {{technique}} is sensitive, reliable, and inexpensive, new methods involving digital overlays {{have proven to}} be more accurate. Two recent technological developments include the 2D polyline method and the painting method. Both methods use Adobe Photoshop. Use of the 2D polyline method entails drawing straight lines between two fixed points in the arch and between incisal edges to indicate the tooth width. Use of the painting method entails coating the incisal edges of a dental model with red glossy paint and then photographing the model. Adobe Photoshop is then used to make measurements on the image. A total of 13 <b>variables</b> <b>were</b> used in analysis. Identification for both methods were based on canine-to-canine distance (1 variable), incisor width (4 variables), and rotational angles of the incisors (8 variables). The 2D polyline method relies heavily on accurate measurements, while the painting method depends on precise overlaying of the images. Although both methods were reliable, the 2D polyline method gave efficient and more objective results.|$|E
500|$|Homosexual {{women were}} more likely to {{describe}} their relationships with their mothers as negative, and their mothers as having been hostile or rejecting. These measures were combined into a single measure, [...] "Hostile-Rejecting Mother", which appeared to have only minimal influence on the development of sexual preference. Homosexual women were less likely to describe their mothers as having been pleasant people. This and two other connected <b>variables</b> <b>were</b> combined into a composite measure called [...] "Unpleasant Mother", which had a weak and indirect connection with adult homosexuality. Homosexual women identified less strongly with their mothers, though this appeared to have very little influence on adult sexual preference, having only indirect effects, dependent upon its encouragement of childhood gender nonconformity. Homosexual women gave less favorable descriptions of their relationships with their fathers, and {{were more likely to have}} negative feelings toward them, and to describe them as having been hostile or detached. These <b>variables</b> <b>were</b> combined into a measure called [...] "Detached-Hostile Father", which appeared to encourage childhood gender nonconformity and adolescent homosexual involvement.

Another study, in 1983, examined eleven women by palpating the entire vagina in a clockwise fashion, and reported a specific response to stimulation of the anterior vaginal wall {{in four of the}} women, concluding that the area is the G-spot. In a 1990 study, an anonymous questionnaire was distributed to 2,350 professional women in the United States and Canada with a subsequent 55% return rate. Of these respondents, 40% reported having a fluid release (ejaculation) at the moment of orgasm, and 82% of the women who reported the sensitive area (Gräfenberg spot) also reported ejaculation with their orgasms. Several <b>variables</b> <b>were</b> associated with this perceived existence of female ejaculation.|$|E

500|$|In {{probability}} theory and related fields, a stochastic or random process [...] is a mathematical object usually {{defined as a}} collection [...] of random variables. Historically, the random <b>variables</b> <b>were</b> associated with or indexed {{by a set of}} numbers, usually viewed as points in time, giving the interpretation of a stochastic process representing numerical values of some system randomly changing over time, such as the growth of a bacterial population, an electrical current fluctuating due to thermal noise, or the movement of a gas molecule. Stochastic processes are widely used as mathematical models of systems and phenomena that appear to vary in a random manner. They have applications in many disciplines including sciences such as [...] biology, chemistry, ecology, [...] neuroscience, and physics as well as technology and engineering fields such as image processing, signal processing, information theory, computer science, cryptography and telecommunications. Furthermore, seemingly random changes in financial markets have motivated the extensive use of stochastic processes in finance.|$|E
