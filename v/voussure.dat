2500|$|The porch's {{entrance}} arch {{is of the}} [...] "basket handle" [...] type ("anse de panier") and {{the external}} <b>voussure</b> immediately around {{the rim of the}} arch is decorated with vine leaves and grapes and small carvings of people eating grapes or at play and some dogs and a bird. These carvings start on the left side emerging from the mouth of a lion and end on the right side entering the mouth of a dragon. Around the interior <b>voussure</b> the same themes are repeated but a pig replaces the dragon. Above this arch a large tympanum contains what is left of a nativity scene with the Virgin Mary and Joseph, who have lost their heads, {{on either side of the}} baby Jesus, and the protruding heads of the ass and the cow. Around the central arch of the entrance, a further two bands of voussures and piédroits are elaborately decorated with scenes from both Old and New Testament. [...] The piédroit is the stone at the bottom part of an arch up to the point when the arch begins to curve. The stones in the curved part of the arch are called voussures. The nine biblical scenes involves are thought to have been inspired by the Maître de Folgoët's porch at La Martyre. They start on the lower left side with the temptation of Eve, and we then move over to the right side and see an angel armed with a sword chasing Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden. We continue to move from left to right and see Eve carrying the baby Abel in her arms whilst the baby Cain sleeps in a cot at her feet and then Adam at work in the fields. We next move to a scene showing Cain and Abel making their sacrifices. On the left Cain is not having great success and the smoke from his fire billows back into his eyes. His brother is having more success. We move next to a scene showing Cain murdering his brother. Next we see Noah's ark and Noah harvesting grapes and then fast a sleep having drunk too much wine. In the final scene from this sequence we see Cham trying to cover his father's nudity. After these biblical scenes there are depictions of the four Evangelists and their attributes. Mark and John are on the left and Luke and Matthew on the right. Finally the carvings are of a [...] "heavenly" [...] host of angels singing, praying and playing instruments; a celebration of the birth of Christ! Inside the porch the statues of the apostles are not by the Prigent atelier but the canopy is. There are also works by the Prigent atelier in niches in the buttress supporting the porch. A statue of Saint Anne teaching the Virgin Mary to read can be found in the right side niche of the right side buttress, a statue of Saint Suzanne can be found in the niche in the centre of the right side buttress and in a niche in the left side buttress is a statue of the Virgin Mary. By the west wall in the south transept there are the remains of a statue of Saint Sebastian attributed to the Prigent atelier and on the lawn a kneeling Mary Magdalene is by Bastien Prigent.|$|E

50|$|This is {{the most}} {{remarkable}} part of the church. The porch comprises two decorated Romanesque <b>voussures</b> ornées below an archivolt, resting on colonnettes and framed by lateral dosserets which mount to {{the height of the}} imposts. These colonnettes continue below the l'archivolt to a corniche supported by corbels forming the base of a triangular fronton decorated with lozenges.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the outside}} of the porch there are two {{decorated}} friezes and two triangular pediments completed by two narrow gargoyles. There is a niche on the façade containing a statue of saint Miliau sat on his throne and at the very top is a [...] "clocheton" [...] topped with a lanteron. The <b>voussures</b> and piédroits of the porch's arch have carvings from the base upwards that recount stories from the Old and New Testament and these should be read by starting on the left side and moving across to the right.|$|R
5000|$|An archivolt (or <b>voussure)</b> is an {{ornamental}} molding or band following the curve {{on the underside}} of an arch. [...] It is composed of bands of {{ornamental molding}}s (or other architectural elements) surrounding an arched opening, corresponding to the architrave {{in the case of a}} rectangular opening. The word is sometimes used to refer to the under-side or inner curve of the arch itself (more properly, the intrados).|$|E
5000|$|This {{dates to}} 1553 and is {{decorated}} with an angel who holds a banner inscribed [...] "LE 15 JOVR DE MARS L'AN 1553 FVT FONDE CESTE CHAPELLE AU NO(M)DE DIEV ET DE MADAME SAI(N)CTE APPOLINE DE PAR HERVE K(ER)JAHES ET GVILL(AVME)E BRAS FABRIQVES DE LAD.CHAPEL" [...] According to local records Hervé Kerahès and Guillaume Bras were local builders. The porch comprises an entrance arch decorated with vine leaves and bunches of grapes as well as carvings of small animals, people eating grapes and playing a trumpet. In the external <b>voussure</b> of the entrance arch, the carvings start on the bottom left with a lion and after the floral decoration, ends on the right with a dragon. In the centre there is a human head, wearing a hat and nibbling at grape seeds. In the interior <b>voussure,</b> the sculptors repeat the same pattern but a pig replaces the dragon. A large tympanum is located over the arch, with a nativity scene depicting the Virgin Mary and Joseph {{on either side of}} the baby Jesus who lies on a bed of straw whilst above him the heads of a cow and a donkey protrude from the wall. This group is situated to the right hand side of the tympanum suggesting that there had been another sculpture on the left side perhaps depicting another part of the nativity scene. The double band of piédroits and voussures (the piédroit is the stone at the bottom part of an arch up until the point when the arch starts to curve. The stones in the curved part of the arch are called voussures and it was common practice at the time to carve both stones) in the Pencran porch arch portray scenes from the Book of Genesis. In the first nine stones and alternating between left and right we see a depiction of the temptation of Adam and Eve with a tree around which is a coiled snake who offers Eve the forbidden fruit. Move to the right hand side and we see an angel brandishing a sword and throwing the couple out of Paradise which is symbolised by a tree laden with leaves. In other scenes we see Cain and Abel lighting sacrificial fires. Cain fails to get his fire burning and the smoke blows back into his eyes which he shields with his right hand. Abel is more successful with his fire. We also see Cain murdering his brother. In other piédroits, there is a depiction of Noah's ark carrying Noah and his family and animals and of Noah picking grapes. He lifts his tunic to create a fold so that he can carry as many grapes as possible. A smaller carving shows Noah intoxicated having overdone the sampling of his wine! The outside of the porch is decorated in the Flamboyant Gothic style, the buttresses topped with pinnacles. After the biblical scenes from the Book of Genesis, there are depictions in the final two piédroits of the four evangelists with their usual attributes, with Mark and John on the left and Luke and Matthew on the right. We then have the voussures and in the double band are twenty one carvings depicting angels playing a variety of instruments; a veritable [...] "Heavenly Host". Above the tympanum there is a small statue of the Virgin Mary with child. The remaining statuary can be found in the buttress niches. In the niche to the far left of the left buttress, there is a small version of the Virgin Mary before the cross. Her hands are clasped in prayer and she wears a veil. The right side buttress has Saint Suzanne in the central niche with another Virgin Mary and child in the first niche. Saint Suzanne reads a book and holds a folded scroll. In the final niche we have a depiction of Saint Ann teaching the Virgin Mary to read. Inside the church porch are statues of Christ and each of the apostles stood on a richly decorated domed dais.|$|E
5000|$|The oldest part of {{the house}} is the {{exterior}} as the interior was repeatedly rebuilt in Ottomans times. The doorway is a pointed arch with moulded <b>voussures</b> under an elaborate hood mould, which terminates in a well-preserved crocketed finial supporting the shield of the Royal Arms of Cyprus (namely of the Lusignan kings), although this shield is defaced or damaged. On either side of this shield are two pairs of smaller shields, each pair bracketed together. The right-most of these is in better condition and bears the common Italian design [...] "Ondato" [...] (i.e. waves). Within the apex of the arch is a smaller shield, probably of the house of Dampierre.|$|R
5000|$|The Chapel of Notre-Dame-des-Anges is {{isolated}} on {{the plateau}} and dates {{in part from}} the end of the 13th century. It is possible that its foundation is older as it is located on a place that has been settled since Gallo-Roman times. It was initially called Sainte-Marie-du-Largue. The apse is in cul-de-four with a flat chevet and the Choir is framed by two chapels. The vault of the nave was probably rebuilt in the 19th century during numerous works which were done under the Concordat of 1801. The door is topped by concentric arches (<b>Voussures)</b> supported by columns. Two statues of angels with Speech scrolls flank the door. The bell tower is topped by a statue of the Virgin Mary. The chapel contains several items that are registered as historical objects: ...|$|R
5000|$|Built in 1665 in the Renaissance {{style and}} {{in a mixture of}} the yellow Logonna stone and Kersanton. The {{entrance}} arcade mountings and voissoir are decorated with figures from the Old Testament and the Passion of Jesus Christ, including prophets and church teachers. There is a Kersanton statue of Saint Sebastian in a niche on the right side buttress.The porch at Ploudiry is much lauded and resembles those at Pencran and at Guimiliau although, being built in 1685, is much older. At the base of the arcade and in the [...] "piédroits" [...] ( [...] the individual bricks of the pillars supporting the arch) are six scenes inspired by the book of Genesis and the story of Adam and Eve. In the first piédroit {{at the base of the}} left hand pillar, Adam and Eve appear in a scene depicting their temptation in Paradise. We see the tree and the snake. The snake has a human head whilst the body is reptilian and wraps itself around part of the piédroit. Eve is reaching towards the forbidden fruit. If we then move to the first piédroit at the base of the right hand pillar, we see the result of Eve's failure to resist the temptation. Now Adam and Eve are expelled from Eden. They attempt to cover their pubic areas with a flower and their other arms rest on their chests. Above Eve an angel shakes her fist in anger. Now we move back to the left and the second piédroit. Eve is now shown as a mother holding a baby and Adam works in the field whilst Cain and Abel make their offerings/sacrifice. Back then to the right side and we see Cain shielding his eye whilst his brother kneels in prayer. If we then return to the third piédroit on the left, we see Abel in his death throws whilst his brother, full of regrets, turns towards a small depiction of God who is most unhappy. The final third piédroit on the right depicts Noah harvesting his grapes and then, having drunk well, we see Noah clearly intoxicated, whilst Cham tries to cover his father's nudity by drawing together his cloak and another, either Sem or Japhet, struggles to hold Cham back. We then have a sort of sculptural full stop between the final piédroits and <b>voussures.</b> Then in the <b>voussures</b> leading to the keystone we have depictions of twelve people led by four prophets, Daniel, Jeremiah, Isiah and Ezekiel. Then come the four eastern doctors, Jean Chrysostome, Grégoire de Naziance, Athanase and Saint Basil and the four western doctors, Saint Augustine, Saint Jerome, Saint Gregory and Saint Ambrose. In the <b>voussures</b> after the keystone are twelve monks and nuns carrying the instruments of the passion. They hold one instrument in each hand so we see the whip and column of the flagellation, the cross and the nails, Malchus' ear on Saint Peter's knife and his lantern, the crown of thorns and the roseau from the [...] "Ecce Homo" [...] scene, the bowl used by Pilate to wash his hands, the tools and the ladder used to bring the body down from the cross, Veronica's veil, the lance of the transfixion and the hammer, the sponge and Judas' thirty pieces of silver. The final two figures hold the long bars used to push the crown of thorns down onto Jesus' head. In the porch interior are twelve empty niches.|$|R
5000|$|The arched porch, added between 1498 and 1509, is {{decorated}} with <b>voussures</b> depicting angels and saints. There are three voussoirs on the porch's entrance and two on the inner door leading into the chapel. Above the porch entrance is a sculpture depicting the Holy Father who is giving a blessing {{with his right hand}} and holding a terrestrial globe in his left hand. Two small angels are placed on either side of him. Then {{on each side of the}} entrance are sculptures of two further angels. They appear to be floating in the air. There are in fact twenty-six angels and sixteen saints depicted in the voussoirs. John the Baptist is one of the saints depicted. He carries a lamb in his arms and is dressed in an animal skin. [...] Inside the porch are twelve statues depicting the apostles, each placed in elaborately decorated gothic niches. Each apostle wears a banderole on which is written the part of the credo associated with them. These statues lead to the entrance door to the church and over this door is a sculpture depicting Saint Herbot, inscribed with the date [...] "1581". He carries an open book thus introducing the theme of evangelism, a theme repeated throughout the chapel.|$|R
2500|$|There was a {{reference}} to a church in Guivapas in as early as 1394 and the building was restored in 1563 and 1565. Hit by incendiary bombs in 1944 in the Allied push to take Brest from the occupying Germans, the church was subsequently rebuilt but there was enough left of the 1563 north porch to retain it and it has some sculptures and carvings attributed to the Prigent atelier including statues of the apostles and Jesus Christ in the porch interior, although eight of them were all decapitated during the turmoil of the 1789 French revolution, part of a nativity scene in the tympanum above the entrance arch and seven angels in the archivolt. The church was given the status of a parish church in 1618. The bell- tower was struck by lightning and destroyed in 1791 The north porch of the église Saint-Pierre et Saint-Paul has a three centred arch or [...] "basket handle arch" [...] (also called [...] "anse de panier") and was made using the local Kersantite. The arch is decorated with carvings of leaves and grapes which emerge from the mouths of a dog {{on one side and a}} dragon on the other. In the tympanum above the door is what is left of a nativity scene; the heads of an ass and a cow poke out from the stable. The buttresses contain contemporary sculptures of Joseph and the Virgin Mary. In the <b>voussures</b> of the archivolt all that remain are seven angels either at prayer, swinging a censer, playing a musical instrument or holding phylacteries. These are by Henry Prigent as are the statue of Christ and the apostles in the porch interior.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are three}} portals on the cathedral's north side; [...] "La façade septentrionale" [...] and these {{can best be}} admired from the centre of Quimper's place Laēnnec with its statue of René Laennec, the French {{physician}} who invented the stethoscope in 1816, while working at the hôpital Necker, and pioneered its use in diagnosing various chest conditions. On the far right is the [...] "Porche des Baptêmes", {{which leads to the}} north nave. The portal comprises a double door separated by a trumeau. Above the doors and in a triangular pediment, are the arms of Canon Pierre du Quenquis whilst {{at the top of the}} pediment are the arms of Jean V with the motto [...] "A ma vie" [...] and the crest of his wife Jeanne de France in a diamond shaped lozenge carried by a dove. Just below this are the arms of Monseigneur Bertrand de Rosmadec with the motto [...] "En Bon Espoir". To the left and right of the pediment are the arms of the Barons of Nėvet and Guengat. The [...] "Porche de la Chandeleur" [...] is located at the northern end of the transept and was built between 1475 and 1479 by the mason Pierre Le Goaraguer and his son Guillaume. The single door is surmounted by a triangular pediment and the arch's external <b>voussures</b> are decorated with carvings of acanthus leaves whilst above the door is an ornate finial above which is a [...] "hermine passant" [...] (a [...] "stoat passing" [...] in heraldic terms). The third portal, situated between the [...] "Porche des Baptêmes" [...] and the [...] "Porche de la Chandeleur", is small and in earlier times gave access to the ossuary and cemetery, It is no longer used.|$|R
2500|$|The present Saint Thuriau {{church in}} Landivisiau was built between 1864 and 1865 {{replacing}} the earlier 16th-century building {{but the old}} church's porch and bell-tower were retained, fortunately so as they are both magnificent. The porch was dismantled and then re-erected in 1728 by Jean Perrot and Sébastien Roussel. The entrance to the porch comprises a semi-circular arch, with side buttresses and above the arch a pointed gable culminates in an elaborate lanteron. Inside the porch are statues of the apostles, and a two-door entrance to the church has further decorated arches, with further statues on the wall {{as well as a}} tympanum. Unusually for porches in churches in the Élorn valley, the porch is accessed using ten steps. As at Pencran, Bastien Prigent created a series of piédroits and <b>voussures</b> depicting biblical and other scenes as decoration of the arch over the porch's entrance (the blocks of stone at the part of the arch near to ground level are the piédroits and the remaining wedge-shaped stones used in constructing an arch form the voussoirs. [...] Above the biblical scenes in the arch's piédroits are depictions of the four Evangelists and their attributes, with Saints Luke and John positioned on the left and Mark and Matthew positioned on the right and finally a [...] "heavenly choir" [...] of thirty one winged angels are shown floating in the clouds and praying, singing, playing various instruments or holding censers. Above the entrance arch is a gable in the Gothic style and on this the sculptors placed a statue depicting a female saint reading a book and another female saint higher up has her hands crossed against her chest. [...] The gable is also decorated with two lions supporting the blason of François de Tournemine. [...] Above the gable there is an ornate lanteron with three niches. The central niche contains a statue of Saint Thuriau to whom the church is dedicated. [...] The two buttresses supporting the arch have niches containing statues of the four Evangelists each seated at a desk with their attributes at their side. The buttresses also hold a statue of the Virgin of the Annunciation and another depicting Saint Anne with the Virgin Mary. All these statues are by Bastien Prigent. [...] The inside of the porch is vaulted and is decorated with the blason of the Danycan family and Henry Prigent added statues of [...] "Christ the Saviour" [...] and the twelve apostles in niches each with an elaborate canopy. The heads of these apostles were damaged during the turmoil of the French revolution and bear signs of restoration and some of the attributes were destroyed which makes identification difficult. The arches around the two doors giving access to the church are in turn richly decorated with garlands of thistles ("chardon") and grapes and a series of statuettes in niches, these depicting Saint Yves, Saint Peter holding a book and a key, Saint Salomon the Breton king wearing armour, holding a sword and the royal crown, Saint Miliau carrying his head in his hands, Saint Thivisiau, a bishop, Saint Côme holding a vase containing medications, Saint Damien (Côme and Damien were brothers and both doctors martyred under Diocletian), and another bishop giving a blessing. On the left side angels hold a cartouche reading [...] "ANNO.DOMINI.1554" [...] and on the right the cartouche reads [...] "LAN.MIL.VCC.L1111.FVST.FONDE.CESTE.PORTAL.ET.ESTOIENT.LORS.FABRIQVES.Y.MART(I)N.J.ABGRALL". Above the doors a tympanun depicts angels holding phylacteries on either side of a statue of Jesus Christ. The phylactery held by the three angels on the left side reads [...] "MEMENTO.MEI/O.MATER.DEI/PAX VOBIS" [...] and that held by three angels on the right reads [...] "DOMVS MEA/SALVATOR MVNDI/ LETVS MARIA". There is an elaborate stoup on the wall between the two entrance doors.|$|R
