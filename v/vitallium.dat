30|$|During {{the early}} 1900 s, {{multiple}} unsuccessful {{attempts were made}} to incorporate the use of metal equipment into the body. These failures were primarily attributed to the researchers’ inabilities to find a suitable metal that could withstand corrosion from bodily fluid without causing an unfavorable reaction in soft tissue [1]. In 1932, Austenal Laboratories created a cobalt–chromium alloy called <b>Vitallium</b> specifically for use in dental implants, and, unlike previous dental alloys, <b>Vitallium</b> could withstand the corrosive effects of saliva. With the successful incorporation of <b>Vitallium</b> into dental implants, Venable et al. [1, 2] began to pursue studies investigating the effects of <b>Vitallium</b> on the body and discovered that this metal was inert to bodily fluids and soft tissue. Following these studies, the cobalt–chromium alloy began {{to be used in the}} orthopedic field as the preferred metal for creating plates and screws for internal fixation methods [3, 4].|$|E

40|$|Today <b>Vitallium</b> is {{used for}} {{surgical}} implants. It is a casting alloy which, with advances in casting technology, is also used commercially for making instruments of fairly complex shape. Because of its expense, however, it is not widely used in Japan. Instead, a series of 18 - 8 Mo alloys are used in Japan even though of insufficient strength. Used {{over a long period}} of time in the body, especially for the purpose of preserving structual functions as part of the human skeleton, it often corrodes, resulting in either abnormalities in tissue cells or, because of its insufficient strength, danger of bending and breaking with aging. In spite of a marked advance in fracture treatment, we have hardly any suitable materials for making instruments appropriate to the internal fixation of fractures in Japan. We, therefore, conducted various experiments to develop an alloy with sufficient corrosive resistance and strength that could be formed into a complex shape to take the place of <b>Vitallium</b> alloy, finally succeeding in developing an alloy we call &# 34;COP&# 34;. The characteristic properties of COP may be summarized as follows: 1. The main components are 20 % Cr, 20 % Ni, 20 % Co and 4 % Mo aside from 0. 2 % P. 2. As it contains &# 34;P&# 34;, it shows a marked age-hardening. In its molten state its machinability is excellent, and later it can readily be hardened by heat-treatment. 3.

40|$|Diagnosis of {{pneumoconiosis}} {{was made}} in 2 dental technicians presenting with interstitial lung disease. The occupational origin of inhaled dust was confirmed by mineralogic analyses, which disclosed mainly large amounts of chromium-cobalt-molybdenum particles originating from <b>Vitallium</b> prostheses, but also showed abrasives (silica and silicon carbide) and asbestos in 1 patient. The presence of <b>Vitallium</b> and its chemical stability in bronchoalveolar lavage and lung several years after cessation of exposure confirm the resistance of this alloy to corrosion by body fluids. This contrasts with the high solubility of cobalt described in cobalt or hard metal disease. We suggest that dental technician's pneumoconiosis is a complex pneumoconiosis distinct from silicosis, asbestosis, or hard metal disease and that Cr-Co-Mo alloys {{play a role in}} its pathogenesis.

We included 30 studies with a total of 1, 017 patients out of whom 77 prostheses were removed and 45 prostheses were revised. The pooled rate of radial head prosthesis removal or revision was 10. 0 % (95 % confidence interval, 7. 3 %- 13. 6 %) with a mean follow-up of 38 months. Subgroup analysis showed that the incidence of removal/revision was lowest with the cemented fixation, longer-stem, <b>Vitallium</b> material, and bipolar prosthesis. More than half of the prostheses were removed/revised for excision of the heterotopic ossification (47 %) and for the treatment of stiffness and limitation of motion (42 %). Other reasons recorded were pain (19 %), loosening (16 %), overstuffing (13 %), instability (12 %), infection (8 %), and prosthesis disassembly (4 %). The current data show that the highest incidence of removal/revision occurred within 2 years after implantation. There was no major difference in the incidence of removal/revision among different designs and materials. Implant removal was often performed as part of a procedure to manage elbow stiffness and heterotopic ossification at the surgeon's preference, not necessarily because the implant was malfunctioning.
