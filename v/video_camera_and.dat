5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert started {{developing}} {{what came to}} be known as the Society of Mind theory which views biological brain as massively parallel computer. In 1986, Minsky published The Society of Mind, which claims that “mind is formed from many little agents, each mindless by itself”. The theory attempts to explain how what we call intelligence could be a product of the interaction of non-intelligent parts. Minsky says that the biggest source of ideas about the theory came from his work in trying to create a machine that uses a robotic arm, a <b>video</b> <b>camera,</b> <b>and</b> a computer to build with children's blocks.|$|E

5|$|Though {{breeding}} can {{be improved}} by supplementary feeding, the survival of young kakapo is hampered {{by the presence of}} Polynesian rats. Of 21 chicks that hatched between 1981 and 1994, nine were either killed by rats or died and were subsequently eaten by rats. Nest protection has been intensified since 1995 by using traps and poison stations as soon as a nest had been detected. A small <b>video</b> <b>camera</b> <b>and</b> infra-red light source watch the nest continuously, and will scare approaching rats with flashing lights and loud popping sounds. To increase the success rate of nesting, a nest watcher places a small thermostatically controlled electric blanket over the eggs or chicks, whenever the female leaves the nest for food. The survival rate of chicks has increased from 29% in unprotected nests to 75% in protected ones.|$|E
5|$|Ferris offers {{himself in}} {{exchange}} to Aisha's kidnappers, and {{is brought to}} the middle of the desert, with Hoffman watching everything via a surveillance drone. Ferris is surrounded by a group of SUVs, which circle him to create an obscuring dust cloud before picking him up. The dust cloud blocks Hoffman's view, so that he cannot determine which of the SUVs, now headed in different directions, is carrying Ferris. Ferris is taken across the border to Syria where he is to be interrogated by Al-Saleem. When Ferris asks Al-Saleem about Aisha, he is told that someone has lied to him and that he has been double-crossed. Ferris tells Al-Saleem that there is an infiltrator (Karami) in his organization who works for Ferris, and that, by association, Al-Saleem works for Ferris. Al-Saleem does not believe Ferris, beats him, turns on a <b>video</b> <b>camera</b> <b>and</b> orders his execution. Salaam and his agents arrive at the last moment, saving Ferris' life. Al-Saleem is shown arrested in his own SUV by Marwan Se-Kia, Hani Salaam's security officer.|$|E

25|$|Laparoscopic {{surgery is}} {{performed}} using several small incisions, or ports: one to insert a surgical telescope connected to a <b>video</b> <b>camera,</b> <b>and</b> others to permit access of specialized operating instruments. The surgeon views the operation on a video screen. Laparoscopy is also called limited access surgery, reflecting the limitation on handling and feeling tissues and also the limited resolution and two-dimensionality of the video image. With experience, a skilled laparoscopic surgeon can perform most procedures as expeditiously as with an open incision—with the option of using an incision should the need arise.|$|E

When it seemed Ray had the upper hand, however, Kevin Nash distracted him, allowing Shelley to hit him with a low blow.

These course antennas were located at the start line, the finish line, and eight points in between. This system was used as video feed for the championships.

500|$|When {{writing the}} script, Arndt chose the Volkswagen T2 Microbus {{to use for}} the road trip based on his {{experience}} with the vehicle and its practicality for filming: [...] "I remember thinking, it's a road trip, what vehicle {{are you going to}} put them in? And [...] VW bus just seems logical, just because you have these high ceilings and these clean sight lines where you can put the camera. In the front windshield looking back and seeing everybody." [...] Five VW Microbuses were used for the family car as some were modified for different filming techniques. Three of the vans had engines, and the two without were mounted on trailers. During pre-production, the cinematographer used a basic <b>video</b> <b>camera</b> <b>and</b> set it up at angles inside the van to determine the best locations to shoot from during filming. Many of the problems associated with the van that were included in the plot (a broken clutch, a stuck horn, and a detached door), were based on similar problems that writer Arndt experienced during a childhood trip that involved the same type of vehicle.|$|E

Against her wishes, Leslie reluctantly does so. When Raul starts speaking Spanish to the camera, Leslie asks April to translate, and learns Raul is discussing his [...] "Committee to Humiliate and Shame America". A furious Leslie tears up the $35,000 check and shouts [...] "Viva America", prompting Raul to declare Pawnee is no longer their sister city and storm out. Leslie insists she will raise the money to build the park without them and Tom, inspired by her example, secretly puts all the tip money he made from the Venezuelans into the park donation jar. The episode ends with Leslie and Tom later receiving an online video from April, who tells them she and Donna are vacationing with Jhonny (JC Gonzalez) in his Venezuelan palace, which is watched over by armed guards.|$|E
500|$|Blink-182 entered Big Fish Studios in Rancho Santa Fe, California in December 1996 {{to record}} Dude Ranch. Big Fish was a {{converted}} guesthouse which had just survived a wildfire months before. However, the gloomy atmosphere did not faze Blink-182 at all, {{and what was}} a tragedy to local individuals became fodder for jokes for the group; bassist Mark Hoppus had just bought a new <b>video</b> <b>camera</b> <b>and</b> he filmed stunts with guitarist Tom DeLonge on the burnt landscape in spare time such as having Mark run around naked as Tom explained to the camera {{what happened in the}} fire and that it's [...] "Mating Season". Thanks to improved economics, the band had more time in the studio to record the album they wanted to make. The trio were listening to music such as Jawbreaker, Bad Religion and Lagwagon, setting the backdrop for the recordings under guidance of Mark Trombino, who provided additional piano and keyboards on Dude Ranch. The trio picked Trombino based on his work he had done on Jimmy Eat World's Static Prevails (1996). The group spent much time trying to get Trombino to laugh at their antics, to no avail. Hoppus' sister, Anne Hoppus, described Trombino as very quiet and [...] "very much his own person." [...] In addition to the record, Trombino produced [...] "I Won't Be Home for Christmas", a holiday song recorded during the Dude Ranch sessions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In most of {{the current}} {{teleconferencing}} systems, a conference room is taken by one fixed <b>video</b> <b>camera.</b> For that reason, face images of speakers become small. To take both full view images of a conference room and face images of speakers, it is required to develop a multi camera system with human operations. In this paper, we develop a new <b>video</b> <b>camera</b> for a teleconferencing in above mentioned situations. The proposed <b>video</b> <b>camera</b> is constructed with three NTSC <b>video</b> <b>cameras,</b> <b>and</b> it outputs the images composed with panoramic images generated by images from these <b>video</b> <b>cameras</b> <b>and</b> the facial images of speakers. In this paper, an Active Contour Model is adopted for panoramic images, directions of speakers are estimated by voice and hardware realization {{of the system is}} mentioned...|$|R
