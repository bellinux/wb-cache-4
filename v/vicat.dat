His wife {{thought it}} best for him to move to the countryside, and she rented 'Brinkwells', a house near Fittleworth in Sussex, from the painter Rex <b>Vicat</b> Cole. There Elgar {{recovered}} his strength and, in 1918 and 1919, he produced four large-scale works. The first three of these were chamber pieces: the Violin Sonata in Eminor, the Piano Quintet in A minor, and the String Quartet in E minor. On hearing the work in progress, Alice Elgar wrote in her diary, [...] "E. writing wonderful new music". All three works were well received. The Times wrote, [...] "Elgar's sonata contains much that we have heard before in other forms, but as we do not at all want him to change and be somebody else, that is as it should be." [...] The quartet and quintet were premiered at the Wigmore Hall on 21 May 1919. The Manchester Guardian wrote, [...] "This quartet, with its tremendous climaxes, curious refinements of dance-rhythms, and its perfect symmetry, and the quintet, more lyrical and passionate, are as perfect examples of chamber music as the great oratorios were of their type." ...|$|E

2500|$|Setting {{time and}} [...] "early strength" [...] are {{important}} characteristics of cements. Hydraulic limes, [...] "natural" [...] cements, and [...] "artificial" [...] cements all rely upon their belite content for strength development. Belite develops strength slowly. Because they were burned at temperatures below , they contained no alite, {{which is responsible}} for early strength in modern cements. The first cement to consistently contain alite was made by William Aspdin in the early 1840s: This was what we call today [...] "modern" [...] Portland cement. Because of the air of mystery with which William Aspdin surrounded his product, others (e.g., <b>Vicat</b> and Johnson) have claimed precedence in this invention, but recent analysis of both his concrete and raw cement have shown that William Aspdin's product made at Northfleet, Kent was a true alite-based cement. However, Aspdin's methods were [...] "rule-of-thumb": <b>Vicat</b> is responsible for establishing the chemical basis of these cements, and Johnson established the importance of sintering the mix in the kiln.|$|E
2500|$|The {{development}} of modern Portland cement (sometimes called ordinary or normal Portland cement) began in 1756, when John Smeaton experimented with combinations of different limestones and additives, including trass and pozzolanas, {{relating to the}} planned construction of a lighthouse, now known as Smeaton's Tower. In the late 18th century, Roman cement was developed and patented in 1796 by James Parker; Roman cement quickly became popular, but was largely replaced by Portland cement in the 1850s. [...] In 1811, James Frost produced a cement he called British cement. [...] James Frost {{is reported to have}} erected a manufactory for making of an artificial cement in 1826. [...] In 1843, Aspdin's son William improved their cement, which was initially called 'Patent Portland cement', although he had no patent. In 1818, French engineer Louis <b>Vicat</b> invented an artificial hydraulic lime considered the 'principal forerunner' of Portland cement and, '...Edgar Dobbs of Southwark patented a cement of this kind in 1811'. [...] Portland cement was used by Joseph Aspdin in his cement patent in 1824 because of the cement's resemblance to Portland stone. The name 'Portland cement' is also recorded in a directory published in 1823 being associated with a William Lockwood, a Dave Stewart, and possibly others. [...] However, Aspdin's cement was nothing like modern Portland cement, but was a first step in the {{development of}} modern Portland cement, called a 'proto-Portland cement'.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} {{strength}} grades for natural hydraulic lime, {{laid down in}} the European Norm EN459; NHL2, NHL3.5 and NHL5. The numbers stand for the minimum compressive strength at 28 days in newtons per square millimeter (N/mm2). For example, the NHL 3.5 strength ranges from 3.5 N/mm2 (510 psi) to 10 N/mm2 (1,450 psi). These {{are similar to the}} old classification of feebly hydraulic, moderately hydraulic and eminently hydraulic, and although different, some people continue to refer to them interchangeably. The terminology for hydraulic lime mortars was improved by the skilled French civil engineer Louis <b>Vicat</b> in the 1830s from the older system of water limes and feebly, moderately and eminently. <b>Vicat</b> published his work following research of the use of lime mortars whilst building bridges and roads in his work. The French company <b>Vicat</b> still currently produce natural cements and lime mortars. Names of lime mortars were so varied and conflicting across the European continent that the reclassification has greatly improved the understanding and use of lime mortars.|$|E
