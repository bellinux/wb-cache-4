The child's attachment pattern is classified using either Ainsworth or the PAC (Preschool Attachment Classification System). The therapy is then 'individualized' according to each dyads attachment/caregiver pattern. The programme, {{which takes place}} weekly over 20 weeks, consists of group sessions, <b>video</b> <b>feedback</b> vignettes and psycho-educational and therapeutic discussions. Caregivers learn, understand and then practice observational and inferential skills regarding their children's attachment behaviors and their own caregiving responses.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} and mid-1990s Fripp contributed guitar/soundscapes to Lifeforms (1994) by the Future Sound of London and Cydonia (released 2001) by the Orb, as well as FFWD, a {{collaborative}} effort with the latter's members. In addition, Fripp worked with Brian Eno co-writing and supplying guitar to two tracks for a CD-ROM project released in 1994 entitled Headcandy created by Chris Juul and Doug Jipson. Eno thought the visual aspects of the disc (<b>video</b> <b>feedback</b> effects) were very disappointing upon completion, and regretted participation. During this period, Fripp also contributed to albums by No-Man and the Beloved (1994's Flowermouth and 1996's X, respectively). He also contributed soundscapes and guitar to two albums by the UK band Iona: 1993's Beyond These Shores and 1996's Journey into the Morn.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to train staff on {{implementing}} naturalistic teaching strategies to present learning opportunities within the context of play using video modeling. Two different types of video modeling were compared; the videos either demonstrated what therapists should do or what they should not do. Six participants were randomly assigned to watch each type of video. Participants who did not meet the mastery criterion after viewing the first video were presented with the other video modeling. If they still did not meet the criterion, feedback was presented. Results indicated that both types of <b>video</b> modeling and <b>feedback</b> were required for four participants. One participant met the criterion after watching the correct video modeling while another participant met the criterion after watching both types of <b>video</b> modeling without <b>feedback.</b> Implications of <b>video</b> modeling and <b>feedback</b> are discussed...|$|R

2500|$|<b>Video</b> <b>feedback</b> is {{the video}} {{equivalent}} of acoustic feedback.

2500|$|Other {{areas of}} {{emerging}} treatment options {{include the use}} of prisms, visual scanning training, mental imagery training, <b>video</b> <b>feedback</b> training, trunk rotation, galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS). [...] Of these emerging treatment options, the most studied intervention is prism adaptation and there is evidence of relatively long-term functional gains from comparatively short-term usage. [...] However, all of these treatment interventions (particularly the stimulation techniques) are relatively new and randomised, controlled trial evidence is still limited. [...] Further research is mandatory in this field of research in order to provide more support in evidence-based practice.|$|E
2500|$|Hofstadter's thesis about consciousness, first {{expressed}} in Gödel, Escher, Bach (GEB) but {{also present in}} several of his later books, {{is that it is}} an emergent consequence of seething lower-level activity in the brain. In GEB he draws an analogy between the social organization of a colony of ants and the mind seen as a coherent [...] "colony" [...] of neurons. In particular, Hofstadter claims that our sense of having (or being) an [...] "I" [...] comes from the abstract pattern he terms a [...] "strange loop", which is an abstract cousin of such concrete phenomena as audio and <b>video</b> <b>feedback,</b> and which Hofstadter has defined as [...] "a level-crossing feedback loop". The prototypical example of this abstract notion is the self-referential structure at the core of Gödel's incompleteness theorems. Hofstadter's 2007 book I Am a Strange Loop carries his vision of consciousness considerably further, including the idea that each human [...] "I" [...] is distributed over numerous brains, rather than being limited to precisely one brain.|$|E
40|$|The main {{contribution}} {{of this work}} in progress is an open source architecture for seamless integration of open access educational resources located in heterogeneous learning management systems (LMS) distributed across the network. One of the main advantages of the proposal is the simplicity in creating, managing and making available new content that builds on the existing material in different repositories. Some previous works addressed similar issues but either in simpler environments, i. e., when the distributed systems were homogeneous, or they require extensive knowledge to take advantages of the integration, {{from the point of}} view of both the content creator and the manager of each learning system. Our solution exploits the possibilities offered by the Content Management Interoperability Services (CMIS) interface typically present in many content repository platforms allowing users to browse and interact with contents stored in several heterogeneous places. Some preliminary results show that it is possible to efficiently combine engineering learning material taken from our technical university with other online resources made available from different educational institutions. Moreover, two extensions, currently in development, aim at providing seamless videoconferencing integrations between the teacher and the learners as well as at supporting remote laboratory sessions by means of controlling programmable objects in remote laboratories with real-time <b>video</b> <b>feedbacks</b> for the student...|$|R

A software version of the VLM was integrated into Atari's Jaguar console, in response to growing VJ interest. In the mid-90s, Audio reactive pure synthesis (as opposed to clip-based) software such as Cthugha and Bomb were influential. [...] By the late 90s there were several PC based VJing software available, including generative visuals programs such as MooNSTER, Aestesis, and Advanced Visualization Studio, as well as video clip players such as FLxER, and VJamm.|$|E

40|$|Background. Feedback {{is used in}} {{rehabilitation}} to improve self-awareness in people with traumatic brain injury (TBI), {{but there have been}} no comparisons of the different methods of providing feedback. Objective. To compare the effect of different methods of feedback on impaired self-awareness after TBI. Method. This was a randomized, assessor-blinded trial with concealed allocation. A total of 54 participants with TBI and impaired self-awareness (85 % male) were recruited from inpatient and community rehabilitation settings. Participants performed a meal preparation task on 4 occasions and were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 <b>feedback</b> intervention groups: <b>video</b> plus verbal <b>feedback,</b> verbal feedback, or experiential feedback. The primary outcome was improvement in online awareness measured by the number of errors made during task completion. Secondary outcomes included level of intellectual awareness, self-perception of rehabilitation, and emotional status. Results. Receiving <b>video</b> plus verbal <b>feedback</b> reduced the number of errors more than verbal feedback alone (mean difference = 19. 7 errors; 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 9. 2 - 30. 1) and experiential feedback alone (mean difference = 12. 4 errors; 95 % CI = 1. 8 - 23. 0). Conclusion. The results suggest that the <b>video</b> plus verbal <b>feedback</b> approach used in this study was effective in improving self-awareness in people with TBI. The results also provide evidence that improvement in self-awareness was not accompanied by deterioration in emotional status. No Full Tex...|$|R
