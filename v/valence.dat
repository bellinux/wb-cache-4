5|$|<b>Valence</b> 3 is {{dominant}} in all subsequent elements up to lawrencium (with {{the possible exception}} of nobelium). Curium can be tetravalent in solids (fluoride, dioxide). Berkelium, along with a <b>valence</b> of +3, also shows the <b>valence</b> of +4, more stable than that of curium; the <b>valence</b> 4 is observed in solid fluoride and dioxide. The stability of Bk4+ in aqueous solution is close to that of Ce4+. Only <b>valence</b> 3 was observed for californium, einsteinium and fermium. The divalent state is proven for mendelevium and nobelium, and in nobelium it is more stable than the trivalent state. Lawrencium shows <b>valence</b> 3 both in solutions and solids.|$|E
5|$|Accordingly, William de <b>Valence</b> {{began to}} build a much larger castle around the {{original}} keep from the 1280s onwards, demolishing Marshal's earlier work. As part of the extremely expensive construction work, <b>Valence</b> used oak trees drawn from several royal forests. <b>Valence</b> was building {{at the same time}} that his nephew Edward I was constructing his major castles in the north of Wales, and the concentric castle that he built at Goodrich is both very similar in design and a rarity in England itself. Valence's son, Aymer de <b>Valence</b> built an additional line of outer defences before his death in 1324, including the external barbican, inspired by that at the Tower of London, and for which the earlier <b>Valence</b> barbican at Pembroke may have been an experimental forerunner. The effect was an early success in converting a fortress into a major dwelling, without damaging its defensive arrangements, and influenced the later castle conversion at Berkeley.|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{integrate}} the current proliferation of motivation theories in a Unified Model of Task-specific Motivation (UMTM). According to this model readiness for action results from an interaction between four relatively independent types of <b>valences</b> that can be classified as affective or cognitive, and positive or negative. Affective <b>valences</b> are expectations about feelings while doing an activity; cognitive <b>valences</b> are expectations {{about the value of}} the consequences of an activity. In current theories these types of <b>valences</b> are designated as intrinsic, respectively extrinsic motives. <b>Valences,</b> furthermore, can be positive, but also negative. Positive <b>valences</b> give rise to approach motivation, negative <b>valences</b> to avoidance motivation. Important factors that influence <b>valences</b> are autonomy, feasibility expectation, and relatedness, each of which can be distinguished in a personal and a contextual facet, and subjective norm. In conclusion, some theoretical and practical implications are suggested and some issues for future research are proposed...|$|R
40|$|The major {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the relationship between personal factors of teachers in primary education and their affective <b>valences</b> to participate in professional development activities of educational ICT use. For this purpose, a questionnaire was distributed to teachers in primary education in the Netherlands (N = 211). A chi-square test was used to investigate whether there is a relation between gender and positive or negative <b>valences.</b> A t test for two independent samples was used to investigate if there was a difference in affective <b>valences</b> between young and old teachers. In addition, a simple linear regression is used to examine if ICT-attitude could be a predictor for the affective <b>valences.</b> The results show that there is no relation between male and female teachers and positive or negative affective <b>valences.</b> Furthermore, no significant difference has been found in affective <b>valences</b> between young and old teachers. The results of the simple linear regression show that ICT-attitude predicted a significant proportion of the variance of the affective <b>valences.</b> The second {{purpose of this}} study is to find out which affective <b>valences</b> teachers have regarding to participate in professional development activities of educational ICT use. This is investigated with semi-structured interviews. Teachers mentioned both positive and negative affective <b>valences...</b>|$|R

5|$|Electron {{affinity}} generally increases {{across a}} period.

50|$|Norbert Schwarz's work on {{categorization}} {{and mental}} construal {{led to the}} development of his inclusion/exclusion model that accounts for the emergence of contrast and Assimilation effects in social judgments. Contrast effects occur when exposure to <b>valenced</b> information influences judgments in a way that is incongruent with the <b>valenced</b> information. Assimilation effects occur when exposure to <b>valenced</b> information influences judgments in a way that is congruent with the <b>valenced</b> information. The key insight of the inclusion/exclusion model is that the evaluation of a target of judgment requires bringing to mind both the target itself, and a standard against which it is to be evaluated. Whether <b>valenced</b> information produces contrast or assimilation depends on whether it is included within the target (assimilation) or in the standard against which it is compared (contrast).|$|R
40|$|Frontal EEG {{asymmetry}} is {{a phenomenon}} {{that appears to be}} associated with approach/withdrawal motivation or behaviors in response to an emotionally evocative stimulus, even in infants (Davidson, 1982; Fox et al., 1987; Fox et al., 1988; Spielberg et al., 2008). This thesis tested whether infants showed relatively greater left frontal asymmetry watching a supposedly positively <b>valenced</b> animation, and relatively greater right frontal asymmetry watching a supposedly negatively <b>valenced</b> animation. Also, the association between frontal EEG asymmetry of the infants and sensitivity of their mothers was tested. The infants did not show significantly stronger left frontal or right frontal asymmetry in response to a positively <b>valenced</b> or a negatively <b>valenced</b> situation. Only the left hemisphere showed a marginal (though non-significant) decrease of activity between the positively and negatively <b>valenced</b> animations. No association between frontal EEG asymmetry of the infants and sensitivity of their mothers was found. Even though no significant associations were found, the results suggest that, in more extensive or thorough research, effects of watching different emotionally <b>valenced</b> situations on frontal EEG asymmetry in infants may still be observed. Further research is needed...|$|R
5|$|The {{noble gases}} have full <b>valence</b> {{electron}} shells. <b>Valence</b> electrons are the outermost electrons of an atom and are normally the only electrons that participate in chemical bonding. Atoms with full <b>valence</b> electron shells are extremely stable and therefore do not tend to form chemical bonds and have little tendency to gain or lose electrons. However, heavier noble gases such as radon are held less firmly together by electromagnetic force than lighter noble gases such as helium, {{making it easier}} to remove outer electrons from heavy noble gases.|$|E

5|$|Being {{the first}} period 8 element, ununennium is {{predicted}} to be an alkali metal, below lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium, and francium.

5|$|Cerium has a {{variable}} electronic structure. The {{energy of the}} 4f electron is nearly {{the same as that}} of the outer 5d and 6s electrons that are delocalized in the metallic state, and only a small amount of energy is required to change the relative occupancy of these electronic levels.

5|$|Diamonds {{containing}} boron as a substitutional impurity are termed type IIb. Only {{one percent}} of natural diamonds are of this type, and most are blue to grey. Boron is an acceptor in diamond: boron atoms have one less available electron than the carbon atoms; therefore, each boron atom substituting for a carbon atom creates an electron hole in the band gap that can accept an electron from the <b>valence</b> band. This allows red light absorption, and due to the small energy (0.37 eV) needed for the electron to leave the <b>valence</b> band, holes can be thermally released from the boron atoms to the <b>valence</b> band even at room temperatures. These holes can move in an electric field and render the diamond electrically conductive (i.e., a p-type semiconductor). Very few boron atoms are required for this to happen—a typical ratio is one boron atom per 1,000,000 carbon atoms.|$|E

5|$|Like most lanthanides, {{praseodymium}} {{usually only}} uses three electrons as <b>valence</b> electrons, as afterwards the remaining 4f electrons are too strongly bound: {{this is because}} the 4f orbitals penetrate the most through the inert xenon core of electrons to the nucleus, followed by 5d and 6s, and this increases with higher ionic charge. Praseodymium nevertheless can continue losing a fourth and even occasionally a fifth <b>valence</b> electron because it comes very early in the lanthanide series, where the nuclear charge is still low enough and the 4f subshell energy high enough to allow the removal of further <b>valence</b> electrons. Thus, similarly to the other early trivalent lanthanides, praseodymium has a double hexagonal close-packed crystal structure at room temperature. At about 560°C, it transitions to a face-centered cubic structure, and a body-centered cubic structure appears shortly before the melting point of 935°C.|$|E
