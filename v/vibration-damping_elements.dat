40|$|A {{model of}} railway vehicle {{movement}} is presented. This model {{takes into account}} arbitrary shape of wheel and rails. Therefore models of contact of surfaces of arbitrary geometry are built in. The contact forces are found with possibility of choice from methods of rolling contact mechanics. The shape irregularities cause vibrations, therefore a model of track and its rails, sleepers and ballast is incorporated and also the vehicle model includes <b>vibration-damping</b> <b>elements.</b> Overall it makes a complete model of the vehicle movement with focus on the wear prediction and vibrations due to the corrugation...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} Proportional Derivative {{controller}} plus gravity compensation to damp out the oscillations of a frictionless physical pendulum with moving mass. A mass slides along the pendulum main axis and operates {{as an active}} <b>vibration-damping</b> <b>element.</b> The Lyapunov method together with the LaSalle's theorem allows concluding closed-loop asymptotic stability. The proposed approach only uses measurements of the moving mass position and velocity {{and it does not}} require synchronization of the pendulum and moving mass movements. Numerical simulations assess the performance of the closed-loop system...|$|R
