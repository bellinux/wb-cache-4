25|$|Infectious <b>vulvovaginitis</b> can {{be caused}} by group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (7-20% of cases), Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella, Yersinia, or common STI organisms (Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis, herpes simplex virus, and human papillomavirus). Symptoms and {{treatment}} of infectious <b>vulvovaginitis</b> vary depending on the organism causing it. Shigella infections of the reproductive tract usually coexist with infectious of the gastrointestinal tract and cause mucous, purulent discharge. They are treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Streptococcus infections cause similar symptoms to nonspecific <b>vulvovaginitis</b> and are treated with amoxicillin. STI-associated <b>vulvovaginitis</b> may be caused by sexual abuse or vertical transmission, and are treated and diagnosed like adult infections.|$|E
25|$|The {{classical}} {{presentation of}} the syndrome starts with urinary symptoms such as burning pain on urination (dysuria) or an increased frequency of urination. Other urogenital problems may arise such as prostatitis in men and cervicitis, salpingitis and/or <b>vulvovaginitis</b> in women.|$|E
25|$|Vaginitis, {{also known}} as vaginal {{infection}} and <b>vulvovaginitis,</b> is an inflammation of the vagina and possible vulva. It can result in discharge, itching and pain, and {{is often associated with}} an irritation or infection of the vulva. Infected women may also be asymptomatic.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} infections, {{diseases}} and disorders {{that can affect}} the vagina, including candidal <b>vulvovaginitis,</b> vaginitis, vaginismus, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or cancer. Vaginitis is an inflammation of the vagina, and is attributed to several vaginal diseases, while vaginismus is an involuntary tightening of the vagina muscles caused by a conditioned reflex, or disease, during vaginal penetration. HIV/AIDS, human papillomavirus (HPV), genital herpes and trichomoniasis {{are some of the}} STIs that may affect the vagina, and health sources recommend safe sex (or barrier method) practices to prevent the transmission of these and other STIs.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Vulvovaginitis</b> in {{children}} may be [...] "nonspecific", or caused by irritation with no known infectious cause, or infectious, caused by a pathogenic organism. Nonspecific <b>vulvovaginitis</b> may be triggered by fecal contamination, sexual abuse, chronic diseases, foreign bodies, nonestrogenized epithelium, chemical irritants, eczema, seborrhea, or immunodeficiency. It is treated with topical steroids; antibiotics may be given in cases where itching {{has resulted in a}} secondary infection.|$|E

50|$|In pregnancy, {{changes in}} the levels of female sex hormones, such as estrogen, make a woman {{more likely to develop}} candidal <b>vulvovaginitis.</b> During pregnancy, the Candida fungus is more {{prevalent}} (common), and recurrent infection is also more likely. There is no clear evidence that treatment of asymptomatic candidal <b>vulvovaginitis</b> in pregnancy reduces the risk of preterm birth. Candidal <b>vulvovaginitis</b> in pregnancy should be treated with intravaginal clotrimazole or nystatin for at least 7 days.|$|E

50|$|Intravaginal agents: butoconazole, clotrimazole, miconazole, nystatin, tioconazole, terconazole. Candidal <b>vulvovaginitis</b> in {{pregnancy}} {{should be treated}} with intravaginal clotrimazole or nystatin for at least 7 days. All {{are more or less}} equally effective.|$|E
50|$|For {{infrequent}} recurrences, {{the simplest}} and most cost-effective management is self-diagnosis and early initiation of topical therapy. However, women whose condition has previously been diagnosed with candidal <b>vulvovaginitis</b> are not necessarily {{more likely to be}} able to diagnose themselves; therefore, any woman whose symptoms persist after using an over the counter preparation, or who has a recurrence of symptoms within 2 months, should be evaluated with office-based testing. Unnecessary or inappropriate use of topical preparations is common and can lead to a delay in the treatment of other causes of <b>vulvovaginitis,</b> which can result in worse outcomes.|$|E

50|$|Short-course topical {{formulations}} (i.e., {{single dose}} and regimens of 1-3 days) effectively treat uncomplicated candidal <b>vulvovaginitis.</b> The topically applied azole drugs {{are more effective}} than nystatin. Treatment with azoles results in relief of symptoms and negative cultures in 80-90% of patients who complete therapy.|$|E
50|$|In pregnancy, {{higher levels}} of {{estrogen}} make a woman {{more likely to develop}} a yeast infection. During pregnancy, the Candida fungus is more common, and recurrent infection is also more likely.

50|$|The genital disease causes {{infectious}} pustular <b>vulvovaginitis</b> in {{cows and}} infectious balanoposthitis in bulls. Symptoms include fever, depression, loss of appetite, painful urination, a swollen vulva with pustules, ulcers, vesicles and erosions in cows, and pain on sexual contact in bulls. In both cases lesions usually resolve within two weeks.|$|E
50|$|Invasive {{candidiasis}} is {{an infection}} (candidiasis) {{that can be}} caused by various species of Candida yeast. Unlike Candida infections of the mouth and throat (oral candidiasis) or vagina (Candidal <b>vulvovaginitis),</b> invasive candidiasis is a serious, progressive, and potentially fatal infection that can affect the blood (fungemia), heart, brain, eyes, bones, {{and other parts of the}} body.|$|E
50|$|Bovine {{herpesvirus}} 4 is {{a member}} of the Herpesviridae family. It is part of the subfamily Gammaherpesvirinae and genus Rhadinovirus.Infection is normally sub-clinical but can cause reproductive disease in cattle such as endometritis, <b>vulvovaginitis</b> and mastitis. Transmission is both vertical and horizontal. It can also be indirectly spread by fomites. Distribution is worldwide and the virus infects a range of ruminants, including bison, buffalo, sheep and goats.|$|E
50|$|Vaginal yeast infection, {{also known}} as candidal <b>vulvovaginitis</b> and vaginal thrush, is {{excessive}} growth of yeast in the vagina that results in irritation. The most common symptom is vaginal itching, which may be severe. Other symptoms include burning with urination, white and thick vaginal discharge that typically does not smell bad, pain with sex, and redness around the vagina. Symptoms often worsen just before a woman's period.|$|E
50|$|SGLT2 inhibitors {{are called}} gliflozins. They {{lead to a}} {{reduction}} in blood glucose levels. Therefore, SGLT2 inhibitors have potential use in the treatment of type II diabetes. Gliflozins enhance glycemic control as well as reduce body weight and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The gliflozins canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin may lead to euglycemic ketoacidosis. Other side effects of gliflozins include increased risk of (generally mild) urinary tract infections, candidal <b>vulvovaginitis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Other {{treatments}} {{after more}} than four episodes per year, may include ten days of either oral or topical treatment followed by fluconazole orally once per week for 6 months. About 10-15% of recurrent candidal <b>vulvovaginitis</b> cases are due to non-Candida albicans species. Non-albicans species tend to {{have higher levels of}} resistance to fluconazole. Therefore, recurrence or persistence of symptoms while on treatment indicates speciation and antifungal resistance tests to tailor antifungal treatment.|$|E
50|$|A vaginal yeast {{infection}} results from overgrowth of candida albicans, or yeast, in the vagina. This is a relatively common infection, with over 75% of women having experienced at least one {{yeast infection}} {{at some point in}} their life. Risk factors for yeast infections include recent antibiotic use, diabetes, immunosuppression, increased estrogen levels, and use of certain contraceptive devices including intrauterine devices, diaphragms, or sponges. It is not a sexually transmitted infection. Candida vaginal infections are common; an estimated 75% of women will have at least one yeast infection in their lifetime. Vaginal discharge is not always present in yeast infections, but when occurring it is typically odorless, thick, white, and clumpy. Vaginal itching is the most common symptom of candida <b>vulvovaginitis.</b> Women may also experience burning, soreness, irritation, pain during urination, or pain during sex. The diagnosis of Candida <b>vulvovaginitis</b> is made by looking at a sample taken from the vagina under the microscope that shows hyphae (yeast), or from a culture. It is important to note that the symptoms described above may be present in other vaginal infections, so microscopic diagnosis or culture is needed to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment is with intra-vaginal or oral anti-fungal medications.|$|E
50|$|Vaginal {{bleeding}} {{not associated}} with menarche may be cause for concern in a child. In {{the first few days}} of life, some amount of vaginal bleeding is normal, prompted by the drop in transplacental hormones. Causes of vaginal bleeding in children include trauma, condyloma acuminata, lichen sclerosus, <b>vulvovaginitis,</b> tumors, urethral prolapse, precocious puberty, exogenous hormone exposure, and retained foreign body. Most causes can be diagnosed with a visual examination of the vulva and a careful medical history, but some may require vaginoscopy or a speculum exam.|$|E
50|$|Varicellovirus (var′i-sel′ō-vi′rŭs) is a genus {{of viruses}} {{belonging}} to subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae, {{a member of}} family Herpesviridae. Humans and mammals serve as natural hosts. There are currently 17 species in this genus including the type species Varicella zoster virus (VZV) also known as Human herpes virus 3 (HHV-3). Diseases associated with this genus include: HHV-3—chickenpox (varicella) and shingles; BoHV-1—infectious bovine rhinotracheitis/infectious pustular <b>vulvovaginitis</b> (IPV); SuHV-1 (also known as pseudorabies virus)—Aujesky's disease characterized by central nervous system signs (hindleg paralysis, meningoencephalitis), high mortality rates in young animals, and respiratory illness in older pigs.|$|E

50|$|Alphaherpesvirinae is a {{subfamily}} of Herpesviridae, primarily {{distinguished by}} reproducing {{more quickly than}} other subfamilies of Herpesviridae. In animal virology the most important herpesviruses belong to the Alphaherpesvirinae. Pseudorabies virus is the causative agent of Aujeszky's disease in pigs and bovine herpesvirus 1 is the causative agent of bovine infectious rhinotracheitis and pustular <b>vulvovaginitis.</b> Mammals serve as natural hosts. There are currently 37 species in this subfamily, divided among 5 genera. Diseases associated with this subfamily include: HHV-1 and HHV-2: skin vesicles or mucosal ulcers, rarely encephalitis and meningitis HHV-3: chickenpox (varicella) and shingles gaHV-2: Marek's disease.|$|E
