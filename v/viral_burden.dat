50|$|Viral load, {{also known}} as <b>viral</b> <b>burden,</b> viral titre or viral titer, is a {{numerical}} expression of the quantity of virus in a given volume. It is often expressed as viral particles, or infectious particles per mL {{depending on the type}} of assay. A higher <b>viral</b> <b>burden,</b> titre, or viral load often correlates with the severity of an active viral infection. The quantity of virus / mL can be calculated by estimating the live amount of virus in an involved body fluid. For example, it can be given in RNA copies per millilitre of blood plasma. Tracking viral load is used to monitor therapy during chronic viral infections, and in immunocompromised patients such as those recovering from bone marrow or solid organ transplantation. Currently, routine testing is available for HIV-1, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus.|$|E

Rates of TTV positivity and mean nasal TTV loads were not dissimilar to those observed {{in the general population}} and in a group of 30 age- and residence-matched healthy control {{children with}}out a history of asthmatic disease. However, in the children with asthma, 3 important indices of lung function - forced expiratory flow (FEF) in which 25 % and 75 % of forced vital capacity (FVC) is expired (FEF 25 % - 75 %), forced expiratory volume in 1 s/FVC, and FEF 25 % - 75 %/FVC - showed an inverse correlation with nasal TTV load. Furthermore, signs of reduced airflow were more frequent in the children with asthma who had high nasal TTV loads (>= 6 log(10) DNA copies/mL of nasal fluid) than they were in those who had low nasal TTV loads (< 6 log(10) DNA copies/mL of nasal fluid), despite similar therapy regimens. In contrast, the control children showed no associations between nasal TTV load and the spirometric indices.

40|$|The feline {{immunodeficiency}} virus (FIV) {{provides an excellent}} model system for AIDS vaccination studies. In the present experiments we investigated the immunogenicity and the protective activity of two inactivated vaccines prepared from a primary virus isolate. One vaccine was composed of whole virus inactivated with paraformaldehyde and then purified (WIV) and the other of viral proteins extracted with Tween-ether (TEV). Both vaccines elicited robust antiviral responses, but neither conferred appreciable levels of resistance against systemic challenge with the homologous virus. In addition, we tested whether the WIV vaccine, that had appeared more immunogenic, could protect against nontraumatic intravaginal exposure to FIV-infected cells. Although the proportions of control and vaccinated animals that became infected following mucosal challenge were similar, the vaccinees had significantly lower <b>viral</b> <b>burdens</b> than the controls: thus suggesting that immunisation with the WIV vaccine had limited FIV replication following intravaginal challenge.

This study examines HSV- 1 pathogenesis in IRF- 3 −/−, IRF- 7 −/− and double-deleted IRF 3 / 7 −/− (DKO) mice. Bioluminescence imaging of infection revealed that DKO mice developed visceral infection following corneal inoculation, along with increased <b>viral</b> <b>burdens</b> in all tissues relative to single knockout mice. While all DKO mice synchronously reached endpoint criteria 5 days post infection, the IRF- 7 −/− mice survived longer, indicating that although IRF- 7 is dominant, IRF- 3 also plays a role in controlling disease. Higher levels of systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines were found in IRF 7 −/− and DKO mice relative to wild-type and IRF- 3 −/− mice, and IL- 6 and G-CSF, indicative of sepsis, were increased in the DKO mice relative to wild-type or single-knockout mice.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in the quantitative assessment of <b>viral</b> <b>burden,</b> by permitting the extension of criteria applied to assess the efficacy of vaccines from all-or-none protection to diminution of the <b>viral</b> <b>burden,</b> may allow the identification of original immunogens of value in combined vaccines. Peptides corresponding to three domains of the envelope glycoproteins of feline immunodeficiency virus that are recognized during natural infection were used to immunize cats. After challenge with a primary isolate of feline immunodeficiency virus, the development of acute infection was monitored by quantitative assessment of the <b>viral</b> <b>burden</b> in plasma and tissues by competitive reverse transcription-PCR, by measurement of the humoral response developed to viral components, and by lymphocyte subset analysis.

To determine the distribution and relative amounts of HIV- 1, proviral DNA in multiple tissues from a chimpanzee euthanized because of an abdominal tumor and kidney failure was quantified by nested PCR limiting-dilution assays. At death, 21 months after infection with HIV- 1 JC 499, this animal had a CD 4 + T-cell count of 268 and 1. 7 × 105 copies of virion RNA/ml of plasma. The highest proviral burdens were in peripheral lymph nodes and blood, followed by lung, colon, and spleen; values ranged from 130 to 3350 proviral copies/μg DNA (equivalent to DNA in 150, 000 cells). The lowest levels of virus were in the spinal cord, brain, and cecum (0. 3 to 2. 5 copies/μg DNA), with all other tissues harboring intermediate levels (6. 8 to 114 copies/μg DNA). <b>Viral</b> <b>burdens</b> in all tissues were comparable to or greater than those reported for HIV- 1 -infected humans in all stages of disease. Immunohistochemistry for HIV- 1 p 24 Gag antigen revealed (i) trapping of HIV- 1 on follicular dendritic cells in lymph node germinal centers and (ii) virus in the brain, where it was localized primarily to capillary endothelial cells in the cerebral cortex. Analysis of the genetic diversity of the Env V 3 loop in tissues indicated that there was no apparent compartmentalization of HIV- 1 variants. Of interest, in 83 of 94 (88. 3 %) clones sequenced, the unique GYGR motif {{at the tip of the}} V 3 loop of HIV- 1 JC 499 had reverted to the more common GPGR. The results support the conclusion that HIV- 1 has the potential to maintain high <b>viral</b> <b>burdens</b> in chimpanzees and to disseminate to most organs, including the central nervous system. The use of the chimpanzee model with HIV- 1 JC 499 (or related strains) in vaccine efficacy studies should prove valuable, especially when assessing protection against disease.

40|$|HIV- 1 {{replication}} and <b>viral</b> <b>burden</b> in {{peripheral blood}} mononuclear cells (PBMC) {{have been reported}} to be high in primary infection but generally very low during the prolonged period of clinical latency. It is uncertain precisely when this transition occurs during the HIV- 1 infection and what the relationship is between the changes in HIV- 1 replication versus the clearance of infected cells in the overall control of viral replication. In the present study, the kinetics of <b>viral</b> <b>burden</b> (i. e., frequency of HIV- 1 -infected cells) and replication during primary and early-chronic infection were analyzed in PBMC of four acutely infected individuals. High frequencies of HIV- 1 -infected cells and high levels of virus replication were observed in PBMC after primary HIV- 1 infection. Down-regulation of virus replication in PBMC was observed in all four patients coincident with the emergence of HIV- 1 -specific immune responses. Other parameters of virus replication, such as circulating plasma p 24 antigen and plasma viremia showed similar kinetics. In contrast, a significant decline in <b>viral</b> <b>burden</b> in PBMC was observed in only one of four patients. These results indicate that the down-regulation in the levels of virus replication associated with the clinical transition from acute to chronic infection does not necessarily reflect a reduction in <b>viral</b> <b>burden,</b> thus suggesting the involvement of additional factors.

Herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2, varicella-zoster virus, and Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus were not detected in any of these samples. Human herpesvirus types 6 and 7 were detected in half of the patients, but were present at low levels, similar to those found in reference populations.

Multiple longitudinal blood samples were obtained from four HIV- 1 -infected individuals with clinically divergent profiles. Levels of HIV- 1 were measured in sequential samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, using both end-point dilution cultures and quantitative polymerase chain reaction methods. Serial HIV- 1 isolates from each case were also evaluated to determine their biological properties in vitro. For the three patients with clinical progression, a dramatic increase in the level of HIV- 1 was observed concurrent with or prior to a marked drop in CD 4 + T lymphocytes. This increase in <b>viral</b> <b>burden</b> was temporally associated with the emergence of a more cytopathic viral phenotype.

In this study we developed a murine S. mansoni/lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) coinfection model that reproduces the enhanced viral replication and liver pathology observed in human coinfections, and used this model to explore the mechanisms involved. Viral coinfection during the Th 2 -dominated granulomatous phase of the schistosome infection resulted in induction of a strong LCMV-specific T cell response, with infiltration of high numbers of LCMV-specific IFN-gamma-producing CD 8 + cells into the liver. This was associated with suppression of production of the Th 2 cytokines dominant during S. mansoni infection and a rapid increase in morbidity, linked to hepatotoxicity. Interestingly, the liver of coinfected mice was extremely susceptible to viral replication. This correlated with a reduced intrahepatic type I IFN response following virus infection. Schistosome egg Ags were found to suppress the type I IFN response induced in murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells by polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid. These results suggest that suppression of the antiviral type I IFN response by schistosome egg Ags in vivo predisposes the liver to enhanced viral replication with ensuing immunopathological consequences, findings that may be paralleled in human schistosome/hepatotropic virus coinfections...|$|R
40|$|Primary {{infection}} {{with the human}} immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is generally followed by a burst of viraemia with or without clinical symptoms. This in turn {{is followed by a}} prolonged period of clinical latency. During this period there is little, if any, detectable viraemia, the numbers of infected cells in the blood are very low, and it is extremely difficult to demonstrate virus expression in these cells. We have analysed <b>viral</b> <b>burden</b> and levels of virus replication simultaneously in the blood and lymphoid organs of the same individuals at various stages of HIV disease. Here we report that in early-stage disease there is a dichotomy between the levels of <b>viral</b> <b>burden</b> and virus replication in peripheral blood versus lymphoid organs. HIV disease is active in the lymphoid tissue throughout the period of clinical latency, even at times when minimal viral activity is demonstrated in blood...|$|E
40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of dengue {{in infants}} is poorly understood. We postulated that dengue severity in infants would be {{positively associated with}} markers of <b>viral</b> <b>burden</b> and that maternally derived, neutralizing anti-dengue antibody would have decayed before {{the age at which}} infants with dengue presented to the hospital. In 75 Vietnamese infants with primary dengue, we found significant heterogeneity in viremia and NS 1 antigenemia at hospital presentation, and these factors were independent of disease grade or continuous measures of disease severity. Neutralizing antibody titers, predicted in each infant {{at the time of their}} illness, suggested that the majority of infants (65 %) experienced dengue hemorrhagic fever when the maternally derived neutralizing antibody titer had declined to < 1 : 20. Collectively, these data have important implications for dengue vaccine research because they suggest that <b>viral</b> <b>burden</b> may not solely explain severe dengue in infants and that neutralizing antibody is a reasonable but not absolute marker of protective immunity in infants.

40|$|The thymus {{is a major}} {{target organ}} in human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) -infected children and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) -infected young cats (G. A. Dean and N. C. Pedersen, J. Virol. 72 : 9436 – 9440, 1998; J. L. Heeney, Immunol. Today 16 : 515 – 520, 1995; S. M. Schnittman et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87 : 7727 – 7731, 1990; T. A. Seemayer et al., Hum. Pathol. 15 : 469 – 474, 1984; H. -J. Shuurn et al., Am. J. Pathol. 134 : 1329 – 1338, 1989; J. C. Woo et al., J. Virol. 71 : 8632 – 8641, 1997; J. C. Woo et al., AIDS Res. Hum. Retrovir. 15 : 1377 – 1388, 1999). It {{is likely that the}} accelerated disease process in children and cats is due to infection of the thymus during the time when generation of naive T lymphocytes is needed for development of the mature immune system. Zidovudine (ZDV) monotherapy, which is used to prevent and treat perinatal HIV- 1 infection (R. Sperling, Infect. Dis. Obstet. Gynecol. 6 : 197 – 203, 1998), previously had been shown to reduce <b>viral</b> <b>burden</b> in FIV-infected young cats (K. A. Hayes et al., J. Acquir. Immune Defic. Syndr. 6 : 127 – 134, 1993). The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of drug-induced reduction of <b>viral</b> <b>burden</b> in the thymus on virus-mediated thymic involution and peripheral blood CD 4 decline using FIV-infected cats as a model for pediatric HIV- 1 infection. Eight-week-old cats were randomly assigned to uninfected, saline-treated; uninfected, ZDV-treated; FIV-infected, saline-treated; and FIV-infected, ZDV-treated groups. Parameters measured included blood lymphocyte numbers, viral load in blood and thymic tissue, and thymic histopathology. While the <b>viral</b> <b>burden</b> was significantly reduced by ZDV monotherapy in peripheral blood lymphocytes, plasma, and thymus, thymic lesions were similar for the treated and untreated FIV-infected cats. Further, markedly lowering the <b>viral</b> <b>burden</b> did not increase blood CD 4 lymphocyte numbers or prevent their decline. The data suggest that an inflammatory process continued in spite of reduced virus replication. These observations imply that reducing virus load and limiting thymic inflammation are separate factors that must be addressed when considering therapeutic strategies aimed at preserving thymic function...|$|E
40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} {{of severe}} dengue {{is not well}} understood. Maternally derived subneutralizing levels of dengue virus–reactive IgG are postulated to be a critical risk factor for severe dengue during infancy. In this study, we found that, in healthy Vietnamese infants, {{there was a strong}} temporal association between the Fc-dependent, dengue virus infection – enhancing activity of neat plasma and the age-related epidemiology of severe dengue. We then postulated that disease severity in infants with primary infections would be associated with a robust immune response, possibly as a consequence of higher <b>viral</b> <b>burdens</b> in vivo. Accordingly, in infants hospitalized with acute dengue, the activation phenotype of peripheral-blood NK cells and CD 8 and CD 4 T cells correlated with overall disease severity, but HLA-A* 1101 –restricted NS 3133 – 142 -specific CD 8 T cells were not measurable until early con-valescence. Plasma levels of cytokines/chemokines were generally higher in infants with dengue shock syndrome. Collectively, these data support a model of dengue pathogenesis in infants whereby antibody-dependent enhance-ment of infection explains the age-related case epidemiology and could account for antigen-driven immune acti-vation and its association with disease severity. These results also highlight potential risks in the use of live atten-uated dengue vaccines in infants in countries where dengue is endemic. Dengue is a well-documented public-health burden in many developing countries [1, 2]. Any of the 4 serotype...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} preinfecting cats with a {{partially}} attenuated feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) on subsequent infection with a fully virulent FIV {{belonging to a}} different subtype were investigated. Eight specific-pathogen-free cats were preinfected with graded doses of a long-term in vitro-cultured cell-free preparation of FIV Petaluma (FIV-P, subtype A). FIV-P established a low-grade or a silent infection in the inoculated animals. Seven months later, the eight preinfected cats and two uninfected cats were challenged with in vivo-grown FIV-M 2 (subtype B) and periodically monitored for immunological and virological status. FIV-P-preinfected cats were not protected from acute infection by FIV-M 2, and the sustained replication of this virus {{was accompanied by a}} reduction of FIV-P viral loads in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma. However, from 2 years postchallenge (p. c.) until 3 years p. c., when the experiment was terminated, preinfected cats exhibited reduced total <b>viral</b> <b>burdens,</b> and some also exhibited a diminished decline of circulating CD 4 + T lymphocytes relative to control cats infected with FIV-M 2 alone. Interestingly, most of the virus detected in challenged cats at late times p. c. was of FIV-P origin, indicating that the preinfecting, attenuated virus had become largely predominant. By the end of follow-up, two challenged cats had no FIV-M 2 detectable in the tissues examined. The possible mechanisms underlying the interplay between the two viral populations are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Natural killer (NK) {{cells are}} {{equipped}} to innately produce the cytokine gamma interferon (IFN-γ) {{in part because}} they basally express high levels of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (STAT 4). Type 1 interferons (IFNs) have the potential to activate STAT 4 and promote IFN-γ expression, but concurrent induction of elevated STAT 1 negatively regulates access to the pathway. As a consequence, it has been difficult to detect type 1 IFN stimulation of NK cell IFN-γ during viral infections in the presence of STAT 1 and to understand the evolutionary advantage for maintaining the pathway. The studies reported here evaluated NK cell responses following infections with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) in the compartment handling the earliest events after infection, the peritoneal cavity. The production of type 1 IFNs, both IFN-α and IFN-β, was shown to be early and of short duration, peaking at 30  h after challenge. NK cell IFN-γ expression was detected with overlapping kinetics and required activating signals delivered through type 1 IFN receptors and STAT 4. It took place under conditions of high STAT 4 levels but preceded elevated STAT 1 expression in NK cells. The IFN-γ response reduced <b>viral</b> <b>burdens.</b> Interestingly, increases in STAT 1 were delayed in NK cells compared to other peritoneal exudate cell (PEC) populations. Taken together, the studies demonstrate a novel mechanism for stimulating IFN-γ production and elucidate a biological role for type 1 IFN access to STAT 4 in NK cells...|$|R
