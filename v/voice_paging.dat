5000|$|PageNet's {{fortunes}} {{began to}} decline in the late 1990s, when the company spent nearly $1 billion to purchase additional spectrum and build out a new network designed to offer advanced services, such as <b>voice</b> <b>paging</b> and two-way paging.|$|E
50|$|In Italy the 26.225-26.935 MHz band (AM/FM, odd {{frequency}} steps) and 40.0125-40.0875 MHz (in 25 kHz steps) may be {{used for}} local pagers. These frequencies are often used for on-site hospital paging systems, including <b>voice</b> <b>paging.</b> Use of POCSAG on the 26 MHz and 27 MHz band has been logged by several listeners in Europe, specifically frequencies 26.350 MHz, 26.500 MHz, 26.705 MHz, 26.725 MHz, 26.755 MHz, 27.005 MHz, 27.007 MHz, 27.255 MHz (see note below regarding legal use of 27.255 MHz for paging in the United States). It appears that US-specification paging systems operating on 27.255 MHz have been sold in Italy and other European countries.|$|E

500|$|On 13 July 1985, Page, Plant, and Jones reunited for the Live Aid {{concert at}} JFK Stadium, Philadelphia, playing a short set {{featuring}} drummers Tony Thompson and Phil Collins, and bassist Paul Martinez.

[...] The performance was marred by a lack of rehearsal with the two drummers, Page's struggles with an out-of-tune guitar, poorly functioning monitors, and Plant's hoarse <b>voice.</b> <b>Page</b> described the performance as [...] "pretty shambolic", while Plant characterised it as an [...] "atrocity".|$|R
