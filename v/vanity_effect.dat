While large “macro” breweries have historically dominated the US beer industry, the industry has seen a significant rise in smaller “craft” breweries. Two possible sources of consumer preferences leading {{to the growth of}} craft breweries’ beer have been forwarded. The first, quality, suggests that craft beers are simply better. The second, what I term “vanity”, suggests that the non-macro image and branding increase consumer utility. The goal {{of this paper is to}} disentangle empirically these two sources of growth. Data on beer sales, prices, and beer brand characteristics from six U. S. cities is combined with brewery ownership data and a quality measure of beer derived from a popular beer rating site. One cannot measure consumer preference for craft beer directly. A negative coefficient on craft branding shows up in past analyses because, by definition, craft beer has a substantially smaller market share than macro beer. To capture craft beer’s <b>vanity</b> <b>effect,</b> I exploit the fact that within the dataset some macro breweries produce craft beers. This allows me to compare beers with similar market shares. Splitting up craft beer into true craft and macro craft, I find consumers prefer the former to the latter, showing a <b>vanity</b> <b>effect</b> of true craft beer. Overall, both quality and vanity have been driving craft beer growth, but vanity has a larger impact than quality. Chapter 2 empirically {{estimates the}} effect of on premise beer sales on the number and production of microbreweries. Many states in the US use a three-tier system for beer distribution. Under a three-tier system, breweries must use distributors to get their products to consumers. Recently, macro breweries have begun trying to vertically integrate with some of their distributors. This paper looks at the competitive effects of vertical integration on craft breweries. To model the three-tier system, a Bertrand competition model with product differentiation and heterogenous firms is used. This paper finds when a macro brewery vertical integrates, fewer craft breweries enter the market. Also, the vertically integrating macro brewery forecloses on craft breweries when there are only two distributors in a market. Lastly, vertical integration decreases consumer welfare when there is low product differentiation. Chapter 3 builds a theoretical model to look at the competitive effects of vertical integration on craft breweries. In the beer industry, states control their beer regulations. On premise beer sales allow craft breweries to operate an onsite tap room at their brewery. Allowing on premise beer sales gives microbreweries the opportunity to increase their profits and build their brand in a highly concentrated market. Since 1989, 33 states have passed laws to allow on premise beer sales. This paper looks at how on premise beer sales affects the number and production of microbreweries, a type of craft brewery. A difference-in-differences approach is used to measure the effect on premise beer sales has on microbreweries. Allowing on premise beer sales increases the number and production of microbreweries. Passing an on premise beer sales law leads to an immediate increase in the number of microbreweries and an eventual increase in microbrewery production. States who have not passed on premise beer sales will see an average increase of 4 microbreweries and an average increase in production of microbrewed beer by 35 % if a state passes an on premise beer sales law...|$|E

There had been a retrenchment of incense, a diversion or a total withholding of homage and attention coquetry had failed of <b>effect,</b> <b>vanity</b> had undergone mortification.

The collection of 31 sonnets includes some of his best known poems, such as [...] "Vanitas vanitatum, et omnia vanitas", later titled [...] "Es ist alles eitel" [...] (All is <b>vanity),</b> about the <b>effects</b> of war and the transitoriness of human life; [...] "Menschliches Elende" [...] (Human misery); and [...] "Trawrklage des verwüsteten Deutschlandes" [...] (Lament of devastated Germany).|$|R

Janet hesitated, {{her hand on}} the knob, her body fallen against the panels. Then, as she pushed open the door, the smell of cigarette smoke grew stronger, and she found herself in a large bedroom, the details of which were instantly photographed on her mind--the dingy claret-red walls, the crayon over the mantel of a buxom lady in a decollete costume of the '90's, the outspread fan concealing the fireplace, the soiled lace curtains. The bed was unmade, and on the table beside two empty beer bottles and glasses and the remains of a box of candy--suggestive of a Sunday purchase at a drug store--she recognized Lise's <b>vanity</b> case. The <b>effect</b> of all this, integrated at a glance, was a paralyzing horror. Janet could not speak. She remained gazing at Lise, who paid no attention to her entrance, but stood with her back turned before an old-fashioned bureau with a marble top and raised sides. She was dressed, and engaged in adjusting her hat. It was not until Janet pronounced her name that she turned swiftly.|$|R
60|$|The {{fact was}} that Edgar Caswall was, if not mad, {{close to the}} border-line. Madness in its first stage--monomania--is a lack of proportion. So long as this is general, {{it is not always}} noticeable, for the uninspired onlooker is without the {{necessary}} means of comparison. But in monomania the errant faculty protrudes itself in a way that may not be denied. It puts aside, obscures, or takes the place of something else--just as the head of a pin placed before the centre of the iris will block out the whole scope of vision. The most usual form of monomania has commonly the same beginning as that from which Edgar Caswall suffered--an over-large idea of self-importance. Alienists, who study the matter exactly, probably know more of human <b>vanity</b> and its <b>effects</b> than do ordinary men. Caswall's mental disturbance was not hard to identify. Every asylum is full of such cases--men and women, who, naturally selfish and egotistical, so appraise to themselves their own importance that every other circumstance in life becomes subservient to it. The disease supplies in itself the material for self-magnification. When the decadence attacks a nature naturally proud and selfish and vain, and lacking both the aptitude and habit of self-restraint, the development of the disease is more swift, and ranges to farther limits. It is such persons who become inbued with the idea that they have the attributes of the Almighty--even that they themselves are the Almighty.|$|R
