We {{investigated}} {{the spread of}} membrane voltage changes from the soma into the dendrites of cerebellar Purkinje cells by using voltage-imaging techniques in combination with intracellular recordings and by performing computer simulations using a detailed compartmental model of a cerebellar Purkinje cell. Fluorescence signals from single Purkinje cells in cerebellar cultures tained with the styryl dye di- 4 -ANEPPS were detected with a 10 x 10 photodiode array and a charge coupled evice (CCD). Fluorescence intensity decreased and increased with membrane depolarization a d hyperpolarization, respectively. The relation between fractional fluorescence hange (AF/F) and membrane potential could be described by a linear function with a slope of up to- 3 %/ 100 inV. Hyperpolarizing and depolarizing <b>voltage</b> <b>jumps</b> applied to Purkinje cells voltage-clamped with an intrasomatic recording electrode induced endritic dye signals, demonstrating that these voltage transients invaded the dendrites. Dye signals induced by depolarizing somatic <b>voltage</b> <b>jumps</b> were weaker in the dendrites, when compared with those induced by hyperpolarizing <b>voltage</b> <b>jumps.</b> Dendritic responses tohyperpolarizing voltage steps applied at the soma were attenuated when membrane conductance was increased by muscimol, an agonist for GABAA receptors.

The temperature {{dependence of the}} VJ normalized to its value at 4. 2 K, VJ(T) /VJ(4. 2 K), exhibited a downward deviation from a BCS temperature dependence of gap voltage. In this study, {{we assume that the}} critical current Ic, much smaller than that expected from the Ambegaokar-Baratoff (AB) theory is the intrinsic feature for IJJs. To interpret the VJ(T) characteristics, the linear approximation for the subgap quasiparticle current is also examined and a linear subgap resistance model is proposed as follows: RJ,sg(T) =RJ,sg(0) /[1 +exp(ko(T-Tc/ 2) ], where ko is constant. Under these assumptions, the <b>voltage</b> <b>jump</b> is given by VJ(T) =RJ,sg(T) x Ic(T).

Whole-cell patch-clamp techniques were combined with microfluorometric measurements of [Na+]i using the Na+-sensitive probe, sodium-binding benzofuran isophthalate (SBFI). Hyperpolarization of spontaneously active dopamine neurons (recorded in current-clamp mode) caused the cessation of action potential firing accompanied by an elevation in [Na+]i. In dopamine neurons voltage-clamped at a holding potential of - 60 mV elevations of [Na+]i were induced by long-lasting (45 - 60 s) <b>voltage</b> <b>jumps</b> to more negative membrane potentials (- 90 to - 120 mV) but not by corresponding <b>voltage</b> <b>jumps</b> to - 30 mV.

40|$|Neurones {{from the}} {{dorsal root ganglia}} of 1 -day-old rat pups were grown in dissociated culture and voltage clamped using patch {{electrodes}} for whole-cell recording. The pipettes were filled with either 140 mM-KCl or CsCl. Depolarizing <b>voltage</b> <b>jumps</b> activated net inward calcium currents in all neurones, which in a subpopulation of 46 % were followed by slowly decaying inward tail currents accompanied by large increases in membrane conductance. During <b>voltage</b> <b>jumps</b> to membrane potentials more positive than 0 mV the inward calcium current was contaminated by a slow outward relaxation only in those neurones with slow inward tail currents. The availability curve for the slow inward tail current was U shaped, with a peak at approximately + 5 mV in medium containing 2. 5 mM-Ca 2 +; further depolarization reduced the amplitude of the tail current. During perfusion with calcium-free solution, or {{in the presence of}} the calcium-channel blockers cadmium or cobalt, or on substitution of barium for calcium, both the slow inward tail currents and outward relaxations were reversibly blocked. The reversal potential of the slow inward tail current, measured using a twin-pulse protocol, was approximately - 10 mV. Replacement of sodium by tetraethylammonium (TEA) did not reduce the slow inward tail current, nor change its reversal potential. Reduction of the extracellular chloride activity produced a large increase in the amplitude of the slow inward tail current suggesting an increase in permeability to anions. This conductance, which behaves as though activated by prior or concurrent calcium entry triggered by membrane potential depolarization, is referred to as ICl(Ca). The activation and deactivation kinetics of ICl(Ca) are complex: envelope experiments measuring peak tail current amplitude revealed activation to be described by a single exponential function, of time constant approximately 100 ms at - 10 to + 8 mV. The integral of the tail currents increased with the duration of depolarizing pre-pulses suggesting accumulation of intracellular calcium. The decay of tail currents activated by short depolarizing <b>voltage</b> <b>jumps</b> was described by a single exponential function of time constant approximately 200 ms at - 60 mV; more complex decay kinetics were recorded following activation by <b>voltage</b> <b>jumps</b> of duration greater than 60 ms.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the coupled {{dynamics of the}} local hydrodynamics and global electric response of an electrodialysis system, which consists of an electrolyte solution adjacent to a charge selective membrane under electric forcing. Under a DC electric current, counterions transport through the charged membrane while the passage of co-ions is restricted, thereby developing ion concentration polarization (ICP) or gradients. At sufficiently large currents, simultaneous measurements of voltage drop and flow field reveal several distinct dynamic regimes. Initially, the electrodialysis system displays a steady Ohmic voltage difference (Δ V_ohm), followed by a constant <b>voltage</b> <b>jump</b> (Δ V_c). Immediately after this voltage increase, micro-vortices set in and grow both in size and speed with time. After this growth, the resultant voltage levels off around a fixed value. The average vortex size and speed stabilize as well, while the individual vortices become unsteady and dynamic. These quantitative results reveal that micro-vortices set in with an excess voltage drop (above Δ V_ohm + Δ V_c) and sustain an approximately constant electrical conductivity, destroying the initial ICP with significantly low viscous dissipation.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which (1 S, 3 R) -ACPD, a metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist, induces burst firing in lateral septal neurons of the rat was investigated in coronal brainstem slices. Membrane currents were characterized in voltage clamp using whole-cell recordings. In the presence of (1 S, 3 R) -ACPD, following depolarizing <b>voltage</b> <b>jumps,</b> repolarization towards the holding potential generated an inward aftercurrent. It could have a plateau-like phase and decayed exponentially. This (1 S, 3 R) -ACPD-dependent inward aftercurrent was accompanied {{by an increase in}} cell conductance and was reduced following partial replacement of extracellular sodium by N-methyl-D-glucamine. It was unaffected by TEA or barium, and persisted in Cs-loaded neurons or following partial replacement of extracellular chloride by isethionate. This suggests that it was mainly carried by sodium. Loading neurons with the calcium chelator, BAPTA, or blocking transmembrane calcium currents, suppressed the (1 S, 3 R) -ACPD-dependent aftercurrent. By contrast, partial replacement of extracellular sodium by lithium did not affect it. Thus, this current was dependent upon calcium influx but was not due to a sodium/calcium exchanger. It was probably mediated by G protein activation. Indeed, in neurons loaded with GTP-gamma-S, following depolarizing <b>voltage</b> <b>jumps,</b> repolarization towards the holding potential revealed an inward aftercurrent having properties {{similar to those of the}} (1 S, 3 R) -ACPD-dependent current.
