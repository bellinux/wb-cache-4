40|$|A high {{fraction}} of carbon bound in solid carbonaceous material is observed {{to exist in}} bodies formed in the cold outskirts of the solar nebula, while bodies in the terrestrial planets region contain nearly none. We study {{the fate of the}} carbonaceous material during the spiral-in of matter as the sun accretes matter from the solar nebula. From observational data on the composition of the dust component in comets and interplanetary dust particles, and from data on pyrolysis experiments, we construct a model for the composition of the pristine carbonaceous material in the outer parts of the solar nebula. We study the pyrolysis of the refractory and <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>component</b> and the concomitant release of high-molecular-weight hydrocarbons under quiescent conditions of disk evolution where matter migrates inwards. We also study the decomposition and oxidation of the carbonaceous material during violent flash heating events, which are thought to be responsible for the formation of chondrules. It is found that the complex hydrocarbon components are removed from the solid disk matter at temperatures between 250 and 400 K, while the amorphous carbon component survives up to 1200 K. Without efficient carbon destruction during flash-heating associated with chondrule formation the carbon abundance of terrestrial planets, except for Mercury, would be not as low as it is found in cosmochemical studies. Chondrule formation seems to be a process that is crucial for the carbon-poor composition of the material of terrestrial planets.

Our aim was to determine the exposure of employees to biological and chemical agents during various work tasks at different biomass-fuelled power plants in Finland. The study included technical surveys on biomass operations and occupational measurements at three CHP plants. Workers’ main health risks were bacteria and fungi, which were easily spread to the air during heavy biomass processes. The exposure levels of actinobacteria, bacterial endotoxins and fungi were high, especially during the unloading of peat and wood chips. In addition, workers were exposed to mechanical irritation caused by organic dust, and chemical irritation caused by <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> compounds and <b>components</b> of diesel exhausts. Multiple exposures to these agents may simultaneously have synergistic health effects on workers’ lower and upper respiratory tracts. During operations, workers were also exposed to endotoxins, actinobacteria and fungi, especially during the cleaning and handling of wood chips in silos and while working near screens or crushers. The measured concentrations exceeded the limit values proposed for these agents. The highest concentration of <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> compounds was found near conveyors. On the basis of these measurements, we suggested best practices for the power plants.

40|$|The {{results of}} the 1997 {{environmental}} surveillance and monitoring program for the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL) are presented and discussed. The purpose of this report is to provide the U. S.

During Calendar Year 1997, PPPL's Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR) completed fifteen years of fusion experiments begun in 1982. Over the course of three and half years of deuterium-tritium (D-T) plasma experiments, PPPL set a world record of 10. 7 million watts of controlled fusion power, more than 700 tritium shots pulsed into the reactor vessel generating more than 5. 6 x 10 20 neutron and 1. 6 gigajoules of fusion energy and researchers studied plasma science experimental data, which included "enhanced reverse shear techniques. " As TFTR was completing its historic operations, PPPL participated with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Columbia University, and the University of Washington (Seattle) in a collaboration effort to design the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX). This next device, NSTX, is located in the former TFTR Hot Cell on D site, and it is designed to be a smaller and more economical torus fusion reactor. Construction of this device began in late 1997, and first plasma in scheduled for early 1999. For 1997, the U. S. Department of Energy in its Laboratory Appraisal report rated the overall performance of Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory as "excellent.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{removal of}} <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> {{compounds}} from biological treatment processes occurs through several mechanisms.

40|$|AbstractIn Italian buildings, {{especially}} dwellings, {{walls are}} very often plastered with gypsum plaster for levelling purposes. The gypsum plaster is generally covered with waterborne wall paint for decoration which represents a barrier {{for the water}} absorption or desorption. To know the hygric performance of a room in such real conditions, the water transfer properties of the painted gypsum must be known. Wall paints can be roughly divided into waterborne and solvent borne paints. Waterborne wall paints are increasingly being used for their low odour and fast environmental friendly drying. The newer waterborne paints are based on aqueous dispersions of synthetic vinyl-type binders, such as polyvinylacetate or polyvinylpropionate (co-) polymers, and acrylic polymers. Moreover, paints containing <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>components</b> have recently been prohibited by the European Commission for professional indoor use. The pressure to reduce <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>components</b> and the industrial trend towards friendlier products with low toxicity of the product formulation led to the current expansion of waterborne types of coating. In building physics literature, knowledge is lacking about the moisture transfer properties of waterborne wall paints. Also the behavior of painted substrates has not been examined sufficiently. The role of the paint constituents in the moisture transfer properties is unclear. This lack of knowledge is partly caused {{by the lack of}} simple measuring techniques. Also the moisture behavior of the gypsum {{plays an important role in}} controlling the relative humidity, as the experimental activity in the paper for measuring its hygroscopic properties (Moisture Buffer Value) highlights. Painting gypsum is not done to prevent deterioration of the substrate as usually done for wood; gypsum is mainly painted for decorative reasons: this can also be a means to control the moisture transfer properties of the gypsum. Anyway, aim of the present study is not the numerical modelling or measuring of waterborne paints, but their influence once applied to the gypsum substrate, of which the hygroscopic properties where calculated when coated and uncoated. The numerical simulation using an whole building HAM-transfer model is then used to simulate the hygroscopic performance of a room in different conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} {{characteristics of a}} portable GC instrument requiring no compressed gas supplies and using relatively lightweight transportable components {{for the analysis of}} <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>components</b> in large-volume air samples are described. To avoid the need for compressed gas tanks, ambient air is used as the carrier gas, and a vacuum pump is used to pull the carrier gas and injected samples through the wall-coated capillary column and a photoionization detector (PID). At-column heating is used eliminating the need for a conventional oven. The fused silica column is wrapped with heater wire and sensor wire so that heating is provided directly at the column. A PID is used since it requires no external gas supplies and has high sensitivity for many compounds of interest in environmental air monitoring. In order to achieve detection limits in the ppb range, an online multibed preconcentrator containing beds of graphitized carbons and carbon molecular sieves is used. After sample collection, the flow direction through the preconcentrator is reversed, and the sample is thermally desorbed directly into the column. Decomposition of sensitive compounds during desorption is greater with air as the carrier gas than with hydrogen...|$|E
