5|$|Shortly {{after the}} family arrive at their new house in Cypress Creek, they meet Homer's new boss, Hank Scorpio, who is <b>very</b> <b>amiable</b> and {{seems like the}} perfect boss. After giving Homer {{a tour of the}} company, Scorpio tells him that his job is to motivate the {{employees}} in the nuclear division. Meanwhile, Bart starts school, but he finds that his new class is far above the standards of Springfield Elementary. When his teacher discovers that Bart cannot read cursive writing, he places him in a remedial class, much to Bart's shock. Lisa goes for a nature walk and discovers that she is allergic to all of the plants around Cypress Creek. Marge tries to go about her daily chores, but the house does everything automatically. This ends up depressing her to the point where Marge starts drinking wine to cope. However, Homer does an excellent job motivating his team in the nuclear division, which makes his family very proud of him.|$|E
25|$|Mrs Oliver, {{who is a}} <b>very</b> <b>amiable</b> {{caricature}} of Dame Agatha herself, remarks about her gaffes in her books. In chapter 12, she mentions one of her novels (actually a thinly veiled reference to Christie's own Death in the Clouds) {{in which she had}} made a blowpipe one foot long, instead of six.|$|E
25|$|The war {{also left}} a residue of anti-American {{sentiment}} in Spain, whose citizens {{felt a sense}} of betrayal by the very country they helped to obtain the Independence against the British. Many historians and journalists pointed out also the needless nature of this war, because up to that time, relations between Spain and the United States had always enjoyed <b>very</b> <b>amiable</b> conditions, with both countries resolving their differences with mutual agreements that benefited both sides, such as with the sale of Florida by terms of the Treaty of Amity.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Omer, with a <b>very</b> complacent and <b>amiable</b> face, {{took several}} puffs in silence; and then said, {{resuming}} his first point: ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>Very</b> {{bland and}} <b>amiable,</b> Doctor Johnson advanced, and, resting his cane on the stocks, glanced to right and left, as we lay before him. [...] "Well, my lads"--he began--"how {{do you find}} yourselves to-day?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The only extant {{account of}} Caroline Sheridan's {{character}} {{is contained in}} a letter written from Inveraray Castle by Matthew Lewis to his mother: [...] "Mrs. T. Sheridan is very pretty, <b>very</b> sensible, <b>amiable,</b> and gentle; indeed so gentle that Tom insists upon it, that her extreme quietness and tranquillity is a defect in her character. Above all, he accuses her of such an extreme apprehension of giving trouble (he says) it amounts to absolute affectation".|$|R
500|$|In {{comparing}} {{the film to}} its predecessor, Dr. No, Richard Roud, writing in The Guardian, said that From Russia with Love [...] "didn't seem quite so lively, quite so fresh, or quite so rhythmically fast-moving." [...] He {{went on to say}} that [...] "...the film is highly immoral in every imaginable way; it is neither uplifting, instructive nor life-enhancing. Neither is it great film-making. But it sure is fun." [...] Writing in The Observer, Penelope Gilliatt noted that [...] "The way the credits are done has the same self-mocking flamboyance as everything else in the picture." [...] Gilliatt {{went on to say that}} the film manages [...] "to keep up its own cracking pace, nearly all the way. The set-pieces are a stunning box of tricks". The critic for The Times wrote of Bond that he is [...] "the secret ideal of the congenital square, conventional in every particular... except in morality, where he has the courage—and the physical equipment—to do without thinking what most of us feel we might be doing..." [...] The critic thought that overall, [...] "the nonsense is all <b>very</b> <b>amiable</b> and tongue-in-cheek and will no doubt make a fortune for its devisers".|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{have read}} the poems with pleasure; but while I think they show {{a good deal of}} {{sensibility}} & poetic feeling, to certain homely states of emotion, I do not think they are sufficiently remarkable as literature to warrant any special attention. [...] That the author is a man of <b>very</b> <b>amiable</b> character, & that his love of his native island is very tender & beautiful is sufficiently obvious, but I doubt if these are enough to warrant us in claiming for him any attention beyond that which is due to a really admirable man who has preserved a simplicity of natural feeling that is rather too rare." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mayne {{states that}} George Gordon Byron was born 22 January 1788 {{in a house}} on 24 Holles Street in London. On the other hand, Robert Charles Dallas in his Recollections states that Byron was born in Dover. In 1790, John Byron and Gordon moved to Aberdeen, {{but this was not}} to last, as John wrote to his sister, [...] "She is <b>very</b> <b>amiable</b> at a distance; but I defy you and all the Apostles to live with her two months, for if anybody could live with her, it was me". Byron's parents then decided to live in {{separate}} houses upon the same street to see if the distance would allow them to bear each other, which left Byron to be raised by his mother and a nursemaid, Agnes Gray. His parents would meet regularly until they realised that their separation did not solve their problems; John Byron would come to talk to his son, but after being allowed to take Byron to his house to spend one night, he realised that he could not tolerate either Byron or his mother any longer. [...] Shortly thereafter, John left Scotland to live with his sister Fanny (Frances) Leigh at Valenciennes, France, the place where he would die in 1791. After John Byron's death, Gordon claimed that she [...] "ever sincerely loved" [...] Byron, and she despaired at her loss.|$|E

6000|$|... "But {{my cousins}} {{are much more}} deserving," [...] said she, thoughtfully. [...] "Louise is <b>very</b> sweet and <b>amiable,</b> and loves you more than I do, while Beth is the most {{sensible}} and practical girl I have ever known." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of {{course we}} owe {{him a great}} deal of gratitude. It was very kind and proper to come to you when you were ill, and his death must have been a terrible shock. He was a fine young man; <b>amiable,</b> <b>very</b> {{attractive}} in manner.' ...|$|R

60|$|To {{begin with}} our old friends. Franz {{was a tall}} lad, of sixteen now, a regular German, big, blond, and bookish, also <b>very</b> domestic, <b>amiable,</b> and musical. His uncle was fitting him for college, and his aunt for a happy home of his own hereafter, because she {{carefully}} fostered in him gentle manners, love of children, respect for women, old and young, and helpful ways about the house. He was her right-hand man on all occasions, steady, kind, and patient; and he loved his merry aunt like a mother, for such {{she had tried to}} be to him.|$|R
6000|$|Have {{you never}} {{received}} any letters from me {{by way of}} Bologne? I have [...] sent two. For God's sake send me some, as I {{have a great deal}} to pay. [...] With regard to Mrs. Byron, I am glad she writes to you. She is <b>very</b> [...] <b>amiable</b> at a distance; but I defy you and all the Apostles to live [...] with her two months, for, if any body could live with her, it was me. [...] 'Mais jeu de Mains, jeu de Vilains'. For my son, I am happy to hear he [...] is well; but for his walking, 'tis impossible, as he is club-footed." ...|$|R

Lord Delawarr is considerably younger than me, but the [...] most good-tempered, amiable, clever fellow in the universe. To all [...] which he adds the quality (a good one {{in the eyes of}} women) of being [...] remarkably handsome. Delawarr and myself are, in a manner, connected; [...] for one of my forefathers, in Charles I's time, married into their [...] family." ...|$|R
5000|$|For all his religiosity, Alexander was not {{remembered as}} a man of peace. John of Fordun says of him: Now the king was a {{lettered}} and godly man; <b>very</b> humble and <b>amiable</b> towards the clerics and regulars, but terrible beyond measure to the rest of his subjects; a man of large heart, exerting himself in all things beyond his strength.|$|R
60|$|The day {{following}} my attempt {{to drop in}} at the cabin, I happened to be making fast a rope on the quarter-deck, when the captain suddenly made his appearance, promenading up and down, and smoking a cigar. He looked <b>very</b> good-humored and <b>amiable,</b> and it being just after his dinner, I thought that this, to be sure, was just the chance I wanted.|$|R
60|$|ANN. Oh, it's {{the same}} with women. The poetic temperament's a very nice temperament, <b>very</b> <b>amiable,</b> very {{harmless}} and poetic, I daresay; but it's an old maid's temperament.|$|E
60|$|Lord Mahon, a <b>very</b> <b>amiable</b> {{as well as}} {{a clever}} young man, comes to dinner with Mr. Croker; Lady Louisa Stuart in the afternoon, or, more properly, at night.|$|E

60|$|Of the Maniac I {{can give}} no information. He seems, {{by his own}} account, to have been {{disappointed}} in love. He was evidently a <b>very</b> cultivated and <b>amiable</b> person when in his right senses. His story, told at length, might be like many other stories of the same kind: the unconnected exclamations of his agony will perhaps be found a sufficient comment for the text of every heart.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Pendennis said, {{with perfect}} sincerity, {{that she was}} {{exceedingly}} glad to hear the news: and hoped Mr. Smirke, who was a <b>very</b> kind and <b>amiable</b> man, would have a deserving wife: and when her visitor went away, Helen and her brother talked of the matter with great satisfaction, the kind lady rebuking herself for her haughty behaviour to Mr. Smirke, whom she had avoided of late, instead of being grateful to him for his constant attention to Arthur.|$|R
6000|$|Sir Thomas {{was twice}} {{married and had}} eight children. He died at sixty-five years of age on 29th of June 1787. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Sir William, {{who was born in}} 1746, and was member for the county in three Parliaments. He was a man of great integrity, humanity, and charity, <b>very</b> affable and <b>amiable,</b> and unassuming in his manners, [...] "and he died as he had lived, fearing God." [...] He married Frances, {{daughter}} and co-heiress of John Thorpe of Embley, and had seven children.|$|R
60|$|I took my {{leave of}} Mrs. Haldin, whose {{beautiful}} lips never stirred. She smiled {{with her eyes}} only. Nathalie Haldin went with me {{as far as the}} door, <b>very</b> <b>amiable.</b>|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Ledwich came to tea, {{sparkling}} {{with black}} bugles, and was <b>very</b> patronising and <b>amiable.</b> Her visits were generally subjects of great dread, for she talked unceasingly, {{laid down the}} law, and overwhelmed Margaret with remedies; but to-night Dr. Spencer took her in hand. It was not that he {{went out of his}} ordinary self, he was always the same simple-mannered, polished gentleman; but it was this that told--she was evidently somewhat in awe of him--the refinement kept her in check. She behaved very quietly all the evening, admired the plans, consented to everything, and was scarcely Mrs. Ledwich! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{wanted you}} {{to see how the}} comfort of all depends on each doing her share faithfully. While Hannah and I did your work, you got on pretty well, though I don't think you were <b>very</b> happy or <b>amiable.</b> So I thought, as a little lesson, I would show you what happens when {{everyone}} thinks only of herself. Don't you feel that it is pleasanter to help one another, to have daily duties which make leisure sweet when it comes, and to bear and forbear, that home may be comfortable and lovely to us all?" ...|$|R
60|$|And {{thus the}} old aunt {{and the little}} child ran on; each {{thinking}} the other very strange; and both thinking the picture still stranger; and the face in the picture still looked at them frankly, and cheerfully, {{as if there was}} nothing kept concealed; and yet again, a little ambiguously and mockingly, as if slyly winking to some other picture, to mark what a very foolish old sister, and what a very silly little son, were growing so monstrously grave and speculative about a huge white-figured neckcloth, a buff vest, and a <b>very</b> gentleman-like and <b>amiable</b> countenance.|$|R
