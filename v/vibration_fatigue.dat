The tests use random broad-band excitation (between 20 Hz & 2000 Hz), on selected SAC and SnPb surface mount interconnect styles. In the test, step-stress excitation was applied in the out-of-plane direction by increasing the RMS excitation levels sequentially from 10 Grms to 28 Grms, to fail most of the components on the board. The tests were conducted on five identical test vehicles for repeatability. Fatigue damage was quantified using a time-domain approach, {{reported in the literature}} [2]. The test results show SAC solder has lower fatigue durability than SnPb solder under the vibration excitation applied in this study. This result is consistent with mechanical cycling studies and repetitive mechanical shock studies, conducted earlier [3].
