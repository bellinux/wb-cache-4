5|$|After Hogg's father died, {{he had to}} {{opportunity}} to move into his family home north of London. Although he initially considered doing so, he chose to stay in London due to the expense that maintaining a large home would involve.

The family led a quiet and stable life together, though at times their finances were strained.|$|E
5|$|Ecgbert {{was the son}} of Eata, who was {{descended from}} the founder of the kingdom of Bernicia. His brother Eadberht was king of Northumbria from 737 to 758. Ecgbert went to Rome with another brother, and was ordained deacon while still there. Ecgbert has been claimed to have been a student of Bede, who much later <b>visited</b> <b>with</b> Ecgbert in 733 at York, but this {{statement}} may simply mean that Ecgbert was a student of Bede's writings, and not that he was formally taught by him.|$|E

5|$|In Washington, Savimbi forged close {{relationships}} with influential conservatives, including Michael Johns (The Heritage Foundation's foreign policy analyst {{and a key}} Savimbi advocate), Grover Norquist (President of Americans for Tax Reform and a Savimbi economic advisor), and others, who played critical roles in elevating escalated U.S. covert aid to Savimbi's UNITA and <b>visited</b> <b>with</b> Savimbi in his Jamba, Angola headquarters to provide the Angolan rebel leader with military, political and other guidance in his war against the MPLA government. With enhanced U.S. support, the war quickly escalated, {{both in terms of}} the intensity of the conflict and also in its perception as a key conflict in the overall Cold War.|$|E

5|$|Occasional trappers and prospectors <b>visited,</b> <b>with</b> one prospector, John Moss, {{making his}} {{observations}} known in 1873. The following year, Moss led eminent photographer William Henry Jackson through Mancos Canyon, {{at the base}} of Mesa Verde.

Reports by both Jackson and Holmes were included in the 1876 report of the Hayden Survey, one of the four federally financed efforts to explore the American West. These and other publications led to proposals to systematically study Southwestern archaeological sites.|$|E
5|$|On May 24, 1942, Rockwell {{was seeking}} {{approval}} for a poster design at The Pentagon because the Artists Guild had designated that he advocate for the U.S. Army Ordnance Department.

5|$|After briefly reading law in Columbus, Ohio, Hayes moved east {{to attend}} Harvard Law School in 1843. Graduating with an LL.B, he was {{admitted}} to the Ohio bar in 1845 and opened his own law office in Lower Sandusky (now Fremont). Business was slow at first, but he gradually attracted a few clients and also represented his uncle Sardis in real estate litigation. In 1847, Hayes became ill with what his doctor thought to be tuberculosis. Thinking a change in climate would help, he considered enlisting in the Mexican–American War, but on his doctor's advice he instead visited family in New England. Returning from there, Hayes and his uncle Sardis made a long journey to Texas, where Hayes <b>visited</b> <b>with</b> Guy M. Bryan, a Kenyon classmate and distant relative. Business remained meager on his return to Lower Sandusky, and Hayes decided to move to Cincinnati.|$|E
5|$|Around late 1224 {{or early}} 1225, Alice married Bohemond, eldest son of Bohemond IV, Prince of Antioch and Count of Tripoli. Pope Honorius ordered Eustorgius, Archbishop of Nicosia, to inquire into the {{legality}} of the marriage. Alice, who continued to regard herself as regent, wanted to appoint her new husband as bailli, but this appointment was opposed by all Cypriot barons. Alice then offered the office to Aimery Barlais, who was amenable, but the High Court ruled that Alice could not replace Philip of Ibelin who had been made bailli for the duration of her son's minority. Barlais left the island to join Alice, while his supporter, Gavin of Chenichy <b>visited</b> <b>with</b> the Holy Roman Emperor, Frederick II, who had decided to launch a crusade for the Holy Land.|$|E
5|$|The actual Burnt Norton is a manor {{located near}} the village of Aston Subedge in Gloucestershire that Eliot <b>visited</b> <b>with</b> Emily Hale during 1934. The {{original}} Norton House was a mansion burned down in 1741 by its owner, Sir William Keyt, who died in the fire. Even though Eliot was married, {{he spent a lot of}} time with Hale and might possibly have become involved with her had he not been married. Even after their time at Burnt Norton, Eliot stayed in close correspondence with her and sent her many of his poems. The actual manor does not serve as an important location within the poem. Instead, it is the garden surrounding the manor that became the focus.|$|E

5|$|The retreat was {{completed}} in 1845 and became a place for entertaining foreign celebrities, chiefs, and commoners. On Hawaiian Sovereignty Restoration Day (Lā Hoʻihoʻi Ea) in 1847, King Kamehameha III and Queen Kalama hosted a grand luau at the palace. The celebration commemorated the fourth anniversary of the restoration of Hawaiian independence and sovereignty by British Rear-Admiral Richard Darton Thomas, following a five-month British occupation of the kingdom during the Paulet Affair of 1843. The luau was attended by an estimated ten thousand guests. The palace {{may also have been}} the site of an earlier luau, or great ahaʻaina (feast), which was part of the initial ten-day restoration festivities in 1842. Children from the Royal School, including all of the future Hawaiian monarchs, often <b>visited</b> <b>with</b> their teachers (the Cookes).|$|E
