A cliche print containing bank and branch details {{is applied to}} the plastic package seal.Vacuum banknotes packing is the most reliable and effective way of currency units storing. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>packing</b> enables to prevent negative impact of the environment on the banknotes and coins; vacuumized currency units are effectively protected against ingress of moisture, dust and dirt. One of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>packing</b> benefits is exclusion of undetectable unauthorized package opening possibility, which effectively prevents stealing of banknotes during their transportation or storage. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>packing</b> of the banknotes provides space saving in the box used by CIT guards for cash transportation.

50|$|Most {{of the fat}} must be {{trimmed off}} prior to drying the meat, as fat does not dry, thus {{creating}} the potential for spoilage as the fat becomes rancid (modern <b>vacuum</b> <b>packing</b> and chemical preservatives have served to help prevent these risks). The meat must be dried quickly, to limit bacterial growth during the critical period where the meat is not yet dry. To do this, the meat is thinly sliced, or pressed thinly, {{in the case of}} ground meat. The strips of meat are dried at low temperatures, to avoid cooking it, or overdrying it {{to the point where it}} is brittle.|$|E

40|$|One hundred three {{isolates}} of Carnobacterium spp. from {{raw meat}} {{were analyzed by}} random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and PCR and were identified by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing. Forty-five strains of Carnobacterium maltaromaticum were characterized for their growth capabilities at different temperatures, NaCl concentrations, and pH values and for in vitro lipolytic and proteolytic activities. Moreover, their spoilage potential in meat was investigated by analyzing the release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in meat stored in air or <b>vacuum</b> <b>packs.</b> Almost all the strains were able to grow at 4, 10, and 20 Â°C, at pH values of 6 to 9, and {{in the presence of}} 2. 5 % NaCl. The release of VOCs by each strain in beef stored at 4 Â°C in air and <b>vacuum</b> <b>packs</b> was evaluated by headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) -gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. All the meat samples inoculated and stored in air showed higher numbers of VOCs than the vacuum-packed meat samples. Acetoin, 1 -octen- 3 -ol, and butanoic acid were the compounds most frequently found under both storage conditions. The contaminated meat samples were evaluated by a sensory panel; the results indicated that for all sensory odors, no effect of strain was significant (P > 0. 05). The storage conditions significantly affected (P < 0. 05) the perception of dairy, spoiled-meat, and mozzarella cheese odors, which were more intense in meat stored in air than in <b>vacuum</b> <b>packs</b> but were never very intense. In conclusion, different strains of C. maltaromaticum can grow efficiently in meat stored at low temperatures both in air and in <b>vacuum</b> <b>packs,</b> producing volatile molecules with low sensory impacts, with a negligible contribution to meat spoilage overall...|$|R

50|$|Extending {{the shelf}} life of roasted coffee relies on {{maintaining}} an optimum environment {{to protect it}} from exposure to heat, oxygen, and light. Roasted coffee has an optimal typical shelf life of two weeks, and ground coffee about 15 minutes. Without some sort of preservation method, coffee becomes stale. The first large-scale preservation technique was <b>vacuum</b> <b>packing</b> in cans. However, because coffee emits CO2 after roasting, coffee to be vacuum-packed must be allowed to de-gas for several days before it is sealed. To allow more immediate packaging, pressurized canisters or foil-lined bags with pressure-relief valves can be used. Refrigeration and freezing retards the staling process. Roasted whole beans can be considered fresh for up to one month if kept cool. Once coffee is ground it is best used immediately.|$|E
50|$|In making Cheddar (or {{many other}} hard cheeses) the curd is {{cut into small}} cubes and the {{temperature}} is raised to approximately.39 C to 'scald' the curd particles. Syneresis occurs and cheese whey is expressed from the particles. The Cheddar curds and whey are often transferred from the cheese vat to a cooling table which contains screens that allow the whey to drain, but which trap the curd. The curd is cut using long, blunt knives and 'blocked' (stacked, cut and turned) by the cheesemaker to promote the release of cheese whey in {{a process known as}} 'cheddaring'. During this process the acidity of the curd increases and when the cheesemaker is satisfied it has reached the required level, around 0.65%, the curd is milled into ribbon shaped pieces and salt is mixed into it to arrest acid development. The salted green cheese curd is put into cheese moulds lined with cheesecloths and pressed overnight to allow the curd particles to bind together. The pressed blocks of cheese are then removed from the cheese moulds and are either bound with muslin-like cloth, or waxed or vacuum packed in plastic bags to be stored for maturation. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>packing</b> removes oxygen and prevents mould (fungal) growth during maturation, which depending on the wanted final product may be a desirable characteristic or not.|$|E
