50|$|One of {{the other}} forms of {{mechanical}} velocity anemometer is the <b>vane</b> <b>anemometer.</b> It may {{be described as a}} windmill or a propeller anemometer. Unlike the Robinson anemometer, whose axis of rotation is vertical, the <b>vane</b> <b>anemometer</b> must have its axis parallel to the direction of the wind and therefore horizontal. Furthermore, since the wind varies in direction and the axis has to follow its changes, a wind vane or some other contrivance to fulfill the same purpose must be employed.|$|E
50|$|A <b>vane</b> <b>anemometer</b> thus {{combines}} a propeller and a tail {{on the same}} axis to obtain accurate and precise wind speed and direction measurements from the same instrument. The speed of the fan is measured by a rev counter and converted to a windspeed by an electronic chip. Hence, volumetric flowrate may be calculated if the cross-sectional area is known.|$|E
50|$|An {{odometer}} {{driven by}} a <b>vane</b> <b>anemometer</b> on the nose determined when the target area had been reached, accurately enough for area bombing. Before launch, the counter was set to a value that would reach zero upon arrival at the target in the prevailing wind conditions. As the missile flew, the airflow turned the propeller, and every 30 rotations of the propeller counted down one number on the counter. This counter triggered the arming of the warhead after about 60 km. When the count reached zero, two detonating bolts were fired. Two spoilers on the elevator were released, the linkage between the elevator and servo was jammed and a guillotine device cut off the control hoses to the rudder servo, setting the rudder in neutral. These actions put the V-1 into a steep dive. While this was originally {{intended to be a}} power dive, in practice the dive caused the fuel flow to cease, which stopped the engine. The sudden silence after the buzzing alerted listeners of the impending impact. The fuel problem was quickly fixed, and when the last V-1s fell, the majority hit with power.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the formulation and verification {{of a novel}} observer of wind parameters. The general idea behind the proposed approach is to consider the wind turbine rotor as an anemometer. In fact, the rotor responds to varying wind conditions; by properly interpreting this response, one can indirectly measure some desired wind characteristics, as for example yaw and shear, as described here. Measurements of wind conditions obtained this way are not affected by the usual disturbances of existing sensors, for example when installed in the nacelle or in the rotor wake. Furthermore, the approach provides rotor-equivalent quantities, and not the typical point information provided by wind <b>vanes,</b> <b>anemometers</b> or other similar sensors, whose information might be too local for large rotors. The proposed method is here formulated for the observation of wind direction and vertical shear.

40|$|Many {{physiological}} disorders {{of fruit}} {{are associated with}} low fruit calcium status. This is true for kiwifruit in which fruit storage quality {{is closely related to}} fruit calcium concentration. It is well known that calcium transport to a fruit is exclusively via the xylem - calcium is not phloem mobile. Therefore, a fruit’s calcium status will depend on the cumulative inflow of xylem sap through the stalk; this will depend on fruit transpiration, and on the microenvironment in which the fruit develops. A plausible hypothesis says that if the windspeed around a developing fruit is increased, fruit transpiration will be increased, and likewise the accumulation of fruit calcium. To test this hypothesis, trials were conducted, on 10 -year-old kiwifruit vines (Actinidia deliciosa 'Hayward') growing in Palmerston North, New Zealand. At fruit set, 12 small electric fans were mounted in the canopy to modify the wind environment of the immediately adjacent fruit. The fans were in operation continuously (24 h /day for several months) from fruit set through to harvest and the wind speed experienced by individual tagged fruit was measured periodically using a small <b>vane</b> <b>anemometer.</b> At harvest the calcium contents of ventilated and control fruits were analysed.

40|$|Abstract—Aerial cargo delivery, {{also known}} as airdrop, systems are heavily {{affected}} by atmospheric wind conditions. Guided air-drop systems typically employ onboard wind velocity estimation methods to predict the wind in real time as the systems descend, but these methods provide no foresight of the winds near the ground. Unexpected ground winds can result in large errors in landing lo-cation, and they can even lead to damage or complete loss of the cargo if the system impacts the ground while traveling downwind. This paper reports on a ground-based mechatronic system consist-ing of a cup and <b>vane</b> <b>anemometer</b> coupled to a guided airdrop system through a wireless transceiver. The guidance logic running on the airdrop system’s onboard autopilot is modified to integrate the anemometer measurements at ground level near the intended landing zone with onboard wind estimates to provide an improved, real-time estimate of the wind profile. The concept was first devel-oped {{in the framework of}} a rigorous simulation model and then val-idated in the flight test. Both simulation and subsequent flight tests with the prototype system demonstrate reductions in the landing position error by more than 30 % as well as a complete elimination of potentially dangerous downwind landings.

40|$|Researchers at the NASA Glenn Research Center have {{developed}} a new air-mass-flow sensor {{to solve the problems}} of existing mass flow sensor designs. NASA's design consists of thin-film resistors in a Wheatstone bridge arrangement. The resistors are fabricated on a thin, constant-thickness airfoil to minimize disturbance to the airflow being measured. The following photograph shows one of NASA s prototype sensors. In comparison to other air-mass-flow sensor designs, NASA s thin-film sensor is much more robust than hot wires, causes less airflow disturbance than pitot tubes, is more accurate than <b>vane</b> <b>anemometers,</b> and is much simpler to operate than thermocouple rakes. NASA s thin-film air-mass-flow sensor works by converting the temperature difference seen at each leg of the thin-film Wheatstone bridge into a mass-flow rate. The following figure shows a schematic of this sensor with air flowing around it. The sensor operates as follows: current is applied to the bridge, which increases its temperature. If there is no flow, all the arms are heated equally, the bridge remains in balance, and there is no signal. If there is flow, the air passing over the upstream legs of the bridge reduces the temperature of the upstream legs and that leads to reduced electrical resistance for those legs. After the air has picked up heat from the upstream legs, it continues and passes over the downstream legs of the bridge. The heated air raises the temperature of these legs, increasing their electrical resistance. The resistance difference between the upstream and downstream legs unbalances the bridge, causing a voltage difference that can be amplified and calibrated to the airflow rate. Separate sensors mounted on the airfoil measure the temperature of the airflow, which is used to complete the calculation for the mass of air passing by the sensor. A current application for air-mass-flow sensors is as part of the intake system for an internal combustion engine. A mass-flow sensor is used to provide accurate information about the amount of air entering the engine so that the amount of fuel can be adjusted to give the most efficient combustion. The ideal mass-flow sensor would be a rugged design that minimizes the disturbance to the flow stream and provides an accurate reading of both smooth and turbulent flows; NASA's design satisfies these requirements better than any existing design. Most of the mass-flow sensors used today are the hot wire variety. Hot wires can be fragile and cannot accurately measure a turbulent or reversing flow, which is often encountered in an intake manifold. Other types of mass-flow sensors include pitot tubes, <b>vane</b> <b>anemometers,</b> and thermocouple rakes-all of which suffer from some type of performance problem. Because it solves these performance problems while maintaining a simple design that lends itself to low-cost manufacturing techniques, NASA s thin-film resistance temperature detector air-mass-flow sensor should lead to more widespread use of mass-flow sensors...|$|R

40|$|The present {{investigations}} have been initiated with {{the object of}} studying the air circulation and relation between • the air movement and the drying of the timber in timber seasoning kilns. The work has been divided into five separate experiments, {{each of which is}} summarised separately as follows :- Experiment 1 - The Measurement of the Flow of Air Through 'Timber Stacks. - A method of measuring the air velocity through timber stacks by means of <b>vane</b> <b>anemometer</b> p has been established. Correction factors, which, for ar 49 ne size and type of anemometer depend on the thickness of the timber and of the separating strips, on the velocity, and on the position in which the anemometer is held, have been determined for a number of cases. These have been plotted against record- ed anemometer readings on a number of graphs. Experiment 2 - The Effect of the Rate of Air Circulation on the rate of Drying. - A number of kiln runs has been made with narrow stacks of matched material using the same temperature and humidity in each run but different rates of air circulation. The object has been to determine the effect of the rate of air circulation on the rate of drying timber apart from the question of change of drying rate from one side of a wide stack to the other due to fall in temperature and increase in humidity of the air. The results indicate that with the same air conditions the rate of drying is independent of the rate of air flow provided that this rate is greater than some minimum value which is probably in most cases less -than 140 feet per minute. Experiment 3 - The Relation Between the Quantity of Air Circulate* and the La in Dr in From the Enterin to the Leaving Air Side of a Kiln Charge of Timber. - A number of tests has been carried out in an experimental kiln to determine the change in air conditions and the lag in the drying rate from the entering to the leaving air side of a stack of timber 5 feet wide. Different sized separating strips and different quantities of circulating air have been used. The theoretical relation between the quantity of air circulated, the amount of moisture evapdrated, and the change in air conditions has also been established; the results so calculated have been compared with those determined experimentally. Experiment 4 - The Relation Between Air Flow and Fall in Pressure Across a Timber Stack. - The flow of air through a rectangular duct consisting of boards and separating strips and similar to the openings through a timber stack has been investigated. Curves showing the relation between static pressure change and rate of flow have been prepared for different sized strips and for board surfaces of different degrees of roughness. Equations for the pressure loss during flow through the duct and for the entrance pressure loss have been determined. Experiment 5 - The Effect of Various Features of Kiln Design on the distribution of the Air over the Side of a Stack of Timber in a Commercial Kiln. - A series of tests has been carried out in commercial kilns of the cross shaft internal fan type to determine the effect of various distances between the kiln walls and the sides of the stack on the distribution of the circulating air {{over the side of the}} stack The results of the tests are shown diagrammatically. The conclusion:: is reached that the 16 inch wide space commonly adopted for the particular design of kiln tested is reasonably satisfactory although more comprehensive tests on an experimental kiln of commercial proportions appear desirable...|$|E
50|$|A {{long-term}} wireless structural {{monitoring system}} was installed {{starting in the}} summer of 2010 with the system in continuous operation since. The wireless monitoring system installed is based on the use of a wireless sensor node developed at the University of Michigan termed Narada. Narada is a wireless data acquisition system specially designed for monitoring civil infrastructure systems where low power consumption (i.e., rechargeable battery operated), high data resolution (i.e., 16-bits or higher), and long communication ranges (i.e., 500 m or longer) are all required system capabilities. On the New Carquinez Suspension Bridge, a total of 33 Narada nodes each capable of collecting up to 4 independent channels of data were installed over a 2-year period with various sensing transducers interfaced: 23 tri-axial accelerometers (to measure deck and tower accelerations), 3 string potential meters (to measure longitudinal movement between the deck and the towers), 33 battery voltage detectors (to monitor the battery level on each Narada), 9 thermistors (to measure the ambient and girder temperatures), 2 wind <b>vanes,</b> 2 <b>anemometers</b> and 6 string gages(to measure deck bending strains). A total of 124 sensing channels have been deployed on the bridge. The Narada nodes are all powered by rechargeable batteries that are continuously charged by solar panels installed on the top deck of the bridge.|$|R
40|$|This article {{documents}} {{a systematic}} bias in surface wind directions between the TAO buoy measurements at 0 °, 170 °W and the ECMWF analysis and forecasts. This bias {{was of the}} order 10 ° and persisted from November 2008 to January 2010, which was consistent with a post-recovery calibration drift in the <b>anemometer</b> <b>vane.</b> Unfortunately, the calibration drift was too time-variant {{to be used to}} correct the data so the quality flag for this deployment was adjusted to reflect low data quality. The primary {{purpose of this paper is}} to inform users in the modelling and remote-sensing community about this systematic, persistent wind directional bias, which will allow users to make an educated decision on using the data and be aware of its potential impact to their downstream product quality. The uncovering of this bias and its source demonstrates the importance of continuous scientific oversight and effective user-data provider communication in stewarding scientific data. It also suggests the need for improvement in the ability of buoy data quality control procedures of the TAO and ECMWF systems to detect future wind directional systematic biases such as the one described here...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 73 - 74). The Wildland Urban-Interface Fire Dynamics Simulator (WFDS) is {{a computer}} code that is currently being developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). WFDS has the capability of simulating wildland fire behavior with prescribed elements such vegetative and structural fuel, topography, and weather conditions. In this initial stage of the research, support {{for the development of}} WFDS focuses on the evaluation of a wind flow simulation on a very complex, outdoor terrain. This effort is preceded by the fabrication, installation and testing of wind-sensing equipment. Foremost, wind data gathered from different sites using various instruments are compared and evaluated. The data gathered in the Trails community of Rancho Bernardo is then presented and compared to select WFDS simulations. Systems consisting of a wind <b>vane</b> and <b>anemometer</b> are currently installed in the Trails community of Rancho Bernardo. They were installed by Professor Fletcher J. Miller and me using a lift that is attached to a telescoping crane. These instruments will gather the wind data needed to show the behavioral patterns of winds influenced by the topography and obstructions such as trees and houses. They are currently installed on top of light posts. These light posts were picked based on the path of the fire influenced by the Santa Ana winds that ravaged the community in 2007. The data from these instruments were graphically represented using a Matlab code that was developed specifically for the data sets. The Matlab graphing utility plots wind speed and wind direction along with matching polar plots. Other main features also include the ability to set a time range and compare two sites in one plot. There are other wind instruments currently being tested and being analyzed to ensure correct data is being recorded. These instruments will also expand to a wider range the wind data-gathering capabilities vertically. A Sound Detecting and Ranging (SoDAR) unit gathers wind speed and direction from the sound waves, initially emitted by the SoDAR to the atmosphere, that are reflected by the air flow above the unit. Wind data has been compared to the SoDAR unit with data from instruments installed on a meteorological tower operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) located in northern California. Two more SoDARs are currently in Texas where initially they were deployed 400 meters apart of each other at an airfield. Also in the same airfield, the wind instrument of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) SuperBat was tested and compared to the SoDARs. Lastly, a self-contained wind instrument (Wind Dart) on a UAV that was developed by the University of Colorado was tested. The instrument was used while attached to the UAV Spectra. A static test was also done in San Diego State University's low speed wind tunnel. The wind data comparison from the SoDAR and meteorological tower in Lodi, California showed close tracking to each other both in wind speed and direction. The comparison of the wind data gathered by the two SoDARs in Texas also showed close tracking to each other. As for the Wind Dart, the data gathered from the instrument and UAV Spectra are not conclusive enough to validate the abilities of the Wind Dart. The experimental procedure in testing the Wind Dart on a moving platform must be further developed. Before the aerial test of the Wind Dart, it was first tested at San Diego State University's low speed tunnel. The detected wind speed by the Wind Dart closely matches the prescribed wind speed of the wind tunnel. The data between the UAV SuperBat and SoDARs showed close tracking. Data collected by the Rancho Bernardo wind instruments shows cyclical wind patterns in the neighborhood. Initial evaluation of select WFDS simulations show data that mimics data gathered from the field...|$|R
