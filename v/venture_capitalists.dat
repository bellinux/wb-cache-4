40|$|We {{model the}} natural {{evolution}} of private information {{over the life}} of a <b>venture</b> <b>capitalist</b> financed project. In the early stages, the entrepreneur is better informed regarding the project, and when the project matures, the <b>venture</b> <b>capitalist</b> has an informational advantage over the entrepreneur. Within this framework, we examine how the <b>venture</b> <b>capitalist</b> 2 ̆ 7 s relative bargaining power affects cash flow rights and investment. When the bargaining advantage lies with the entrepreneur, the project may not be screened, and the <b>venture</b> <b>capitalist</b> may acquiesce to excessive initial investment but subsequently terminate the project. Increased <b>venture</b> <b>capitalist</b> bargaining power encourages project screening, attenuates the incentive to overinvest, and reduces the incidence of project termination subsequent to the initial investment.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} <b>venture</b> <b>capitalist's</b> {{decision}} on {{the timing of the}} IPO, the offer price and the fraction of shares he sells {{in the course of the}} IPO. A <b>venture</b> <b>capitalist</b> may decide to take a company public or to liquidate it after one or two financing periods. A longer <b>venture</b> <b>capitalist's</b> participation in a firm (later IPO) may increase its value while also increasing costs for the <b>venture</b> <b>capitalist.</b> Due to his active involvement, the <b>venture</b> <b>capitalist</b> knows the type of firm and the kind of project he finances before potential new investors do. This information asymmetry is resolved at the end of the second period. Under certain assumptions about the parameters and the structure of the model, we obtain a single equilibrium in which highquality firms separate from low-quality firms. The latter are liquidated after the first period, while the former go public either after having been financed by the <b>venture</b> <b>capitalist</b> for two periods or after one financing period using a lock-up. Whether a strategy of one or two financing periods is chosen depends on the consulting intensity of the project and / or on the experience of the <b>venture</b> <b>capitalist.</b> In the separating equilibrium, the offer price corresponds to th...|$|R

We compare a competitive setting with a benchmark case where the <b>venture</b> <b>capitalist</b> finances only one entrepreneur.
