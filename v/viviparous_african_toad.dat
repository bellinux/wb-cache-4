40|$|Summary: The {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the nature of the cholinoceptors at the sciatic nerve-gastrocnemius muscle junction of the common <b>African</b> <b>toad</b> (Bufo regularis). Using myographic technique, the twitch properties of the sciatic-gastrocnemius muscle preparation of the common <b>African</b> <b>toad</b> was studied. Both the twitch height and peak tetanic height were measured as a percentage of control. Hexamethonium at a concentratration of 0. 1 mM significantly (P< 0. 05) reduced the mean twitch height from 2. 62 cm to 1. 0 cm and mean peak tetanic height from 5. 38 cm to 4. 32 cm. Hexamethonium, however does not produce tetanic fade at the same concentration. We hypothesized that the cholinoceptors of the neuromuscular junction of the common <b>African</b> <b>toad</b> (Bufo regularis) resemble the developing synapse of <b>African</b> clawed <b>toad</b> (Xenopus laevis) and may contain muscarinic M 1 autoreceptors at the pre juntional membrane...|$|R

A number of biologically active peptides have been isolated from the mammalian central nervous system and gut. Many of these substances, or closely related homologous peptides, are also present in anuran skin (Pearse, 1977) and it was thus of interest to examine the tissue distribution of somatostatin in an anuran. Male South <b>African</b> clawed <b>toads</b> (Xenopus laevis) were lightly anaesthetized with diethyl ether and the brain, gastric antrum, small bowel, colon, pancreas, gastrocnemius muscle and strips of dorsal and ventral skin were excised.

Changes in acetylcholinesterase (AChE), corticosterone and total protein levels were assessed in the serum, brain, liver, lungs and gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and the results supported by bioaccumulation data. The biomarkers were chosen as indicators of key physiological functions: AChE for neurotoxicity, corticosterone and total protein levels as indicators of oxidative stress. Toads were exposed to 0. 01, 0. 02, 0. 03 and 0. 04 g/L for 28 days. Brain AChE activity reduced by 96 % in the highest concentration (0. 04 g/L) compared to the control brain. Similarly, AChE activities in serum, liver, lungs and GIT tissues (88 %, 88 %, 87, 87 % umg- 1 protein respectively) were also inhibited in the toads. Corticosterone and total protein levels in the tissues decreased compared to the control.

40|$|The human acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 2 gene, ACAT 2, {{codes for}} a thiolase, an enzyme {{involved}} in lipid metabolism. The human T-complex protein 1 gene, TCP 1, encodes a molecular chaperone of the chaperonin family. The two genes overlap by their 3 '-untranslated regions, their coding sequences being located on opposite DNA strands in a tail-to-tail orientation. To {{find out how}} the overlap might have arisen in evolution, the homologous genes of the zebrafish, the <b>African</b> <b>toad,</b> caiman, platypus, opossum, and wallaby were identified. In each species, standard or long polymerase chain reactions were used to determine whether the ACAT 2 and TCP 1 homologs are closely linked and, if so, whether they overlap. The results reveal that the overlap apparently arose during the transition from therapsid reptiles to mammals and has been retained for > 200 million years. Part of the overlapping untranslated region shows remarkable sequence conservation. The overlap presumably arose during the chromosomal rearrangement that brought the two unrelated and previously separated genes together.

40|$|Summary: The study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the influence of nitric oxide (NO) on the action of histamine and carbachol on acid secretion in the common <b>African</b> <b>toad</b> – Bufo regularis. Gastric acidity was determined by titration method. The acid secretion was determined when nitric oxide was absent following administration of NO synthase inhibitor; N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) and when nitric oxide was in excess by administration of exogenous NO donor, sodium nitroprusside (SNP). Histamine or carbachol increased acid secretion in the toad. Acid output increased from 0. 32 ± 0. 04 mEq/ 15 min to 0. 56 ± 0. 08 and 0. 61 ± 0. 05 mEq/ 15 min for histamine and carbachol respectively (P < 0. 05). Pretreatment of the toad with L-NAME produced further increases in histamine (0. 62 ± 0. 06 mEq/ 15 min) or carbachol (0. 74 ± 0. 06 mEq/ 15 min) induced acid secretion respectively. SNP however, completely abolished the acid secretion stimulated by either histamine or carbachol. It was therefore concluded that nitric oxide has a negative influence on the histamine or carbachol – stimulated acid secretion in the toad – Bufo regularis...|$|R
40|$|Although the {{morphological}} {{and physiological}} changes involved in pregnancy in live-bearing reptiles are well studied, the genetic mechanisms that underlie {{these changes are}} not known. We used the <b>viviparous</b> <b>African</b> Ocellated Skink, Chalcides ocellatus, as a model to identify a near complete gene expression profile associated with pregnancy using RNA-Seq analyses of uterine transcriptomes. Pregnancy in C. ocellatus is associated with upregulation of uterine genes involved with metabolism, cell proliferation and death, and cellular transport. Moreover, there are clear parallels between the genetic processes associated with pregnancy in mammals and Chalcides in expression of genes related to tissue remodeling, angiogenesis, immune system regulation, and nutrient provisioning to the embryo. In particular, the pregnant uterine transcriptome is dominated by expression of proteolytic enzymes that we speculate are involved both with remodeling the chorioallantoic placenta and histotrophy in the omphaloplacenta. Elements of the maternal innate immune system are downregulated in the pregnant uterus, indicating a potential mechanism to avoid rejection of the embryo. We found a downregulation of major histocompatability complex loci and estrogen and progesterone receptors in the pregnant uterus. This pattern is similar to mammals but cannot {{be explained by the}} mammalian model. The latter finding provides evidence that pregnancy is controlled by different endocrinological mechanisms in mammals and reptiles.

Among several other forms described from these collections was the Eastern Leopard Toad, Amietophrynus pardalis, which Ranger distinguished from the Raucous toad on behaviour and calls (according to his nephew, Mr Gary Ranger, [...] "Gleniffer" [...] was subdivided in the late 1930s and the portions renamed, including [...] "Hillside" [...] and [...] "Rockdale", where there is a monument to the older Mr Ranger). Hewitt considered the Raucous Toad, along with most other large toads of Southern Africa, as subspecies of the widespread <b>African</b> <b>Toad</b> Bufo regularis (a species which is now considered absent from Southern Africa, predominantly occurring in subsaharan Africa north of the equator). In 1964, Poynton raised Bufo rangeri of Hewitt, 1935 to full species status, distinguishing it from co-occurring related forms.
