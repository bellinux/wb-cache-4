5000|$|The <b>Vinegar</b> <b>Tree</b> was {{an early}} play by the American playwright Paul Osborn. It is a light comedy of manners and opened in 1930 at the Playhouse in New York {{starring}} Mary Boland and Warren William. In the review from the New York Times, Brooks Atkinson called Mary Boland's performance [...] "a great treat for an audience that laughed until it burst its stays at The Playhouse last evening." [...] The <b>Vinegar</b> <b>Tree</b> was revived successfully at the York Theater in 1988 with Frances Cuka. Clive Barnes remarked in his review, [...] "The misunderstandings are all very well understood, but what gives Osborn's play its finesse and glitter is the neatness of its writing and the sheer style of its construction {{as well as the}} observation and comic insight Osborn brings to his characters"The <b>Vinegar</b> <b>Tree</b> was made into a movie called Should Ladies Behave? in 1933 with Alice Brady, Lionel Barrymore, Conway Tearle, Katherine Alexander, Mary Carlisle, William Janney, Halliwell Hobbes. The screenwriters were Bella and Samuel Spewack and the director was Harry Beaumont.|$|E

40|$|High soil pH {{levels may}} limit the {{availability}} of phosphorous (P) to crops. In organic farming, the use of synthetic P fertilizers is not allowed. Application of rock phosphate (RP) to crops {{is one of the}} alternatives for organic production. However, RP application shows little effect on high pH soils, because the P is not transformed into plant-available forms under alkaline soil conditions. Aiming at the development of locally adapted solutions, we followed a Participatory Technology Development approach, making use of the local knowledge to identify current practices and associated problems by conducting focus group discussions with organic farmers. Farmers stated that they are facing challenges with a P limitation in their cotton-based production systems. In 2011 - 12, on-station trials with maize, green gram and wheat investigated the potential of several locally available materials to solubilize RP (phosphorus solubilizing bacteria (PSB), tamarind fruits, local <b>vinegar</b> from mahua <b>trees</b> (Madhuca longifolia), butter milk (BM), incubating RP into compost). The results of these trials showed that the two most promising options for solubilizing RP were BM and Mahua Vinegar (MV). Further on-station trials in 2012 - 13 investigated the effects of BM and MV more closely, focusing on incubation periods and ratios of RP:acidifying liquids. Another study looked at technologies for improved farm yard manure (FYM) management. Results suggested that acidulating RP with BM for a period of one week in a ratio BM:RP = 10 : 1 leads to a good solubilization of RP. Furthermore, the so-called “shaded shallow-pit system”, which was favored by local farmers, best conserved the quality of FYM as a fertilizer. Subsequently, the information of the two studies was combined, and the production of RP-enriched FYM (RP-FYM) by five local lead farmers was initiated in 2012. The RP-FYM produced was distributed to associated farmers (4 per lead farmer) to set up several on-farm trials with cotton and soybean in 2013 - 14. Results showed an increase of soybean grain and seed cotton yields in the RP-FYM treatment of 40...|$|R

Mrs. Ives' {{boarding}} house, where the experiments take place, was a Victorian mansion known as The <b>Vinegar</b> <b>Tree</b> house on backlot #2. The stock footage establishing the Welsh village was from How Green Was My Valley (1941).|$|E

50|$|Paul Osborn (September 4, 1901 - May 12, 1988) was an American {{playwright and}} screenwriter. Osborn's notable {{original}} plays are The <b>Vinegar</b> <b>Tree,</b> Oliver Oliver, and Morning's at Seven and among his several successful adaptations, On Borrowed Time has proved particularly popular. Counted among his best-known screenplays {{would be the}} adaptation of John Steinbeck's East of Eden and Wild River for his friend Elia Kazan, South Pacific and Sayonara directed by Joshua Logan, as well as Madame Curie, The Yearling, and Portrait of Jennie.|$|E
5000|$|In 1930 Osborn found {{singular}} {{success on}} Broadway with a comedy titled The <b>Vinegar</b> <b>Tree</b> that starred Mary Boland. He contributed the comedy Oliver Oliver to the 1934 Broadway season, and in 1984 that play won critical acclaim at the Long Wharf Theater and the Philadelphia Drama Guild with Boyd Gaines {{in the title}} role. On the opening night in New Haven, the audience gave Oliver Oliver a standing ovation; and Osborn, who suffered macular degeneration, quipped, [...] "I thought they were standing to get their coats." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1925 {{he started}} a {{partnership}} with William A. Brady, Jr. They produced plays such as Lucky Sam McCarver (1925), the revivals of Little Eyolf and The Two Orphans in 1926, The Road to Rome (1927), and The Little Show (1929). Their working relationship ended amicably in 1929 as Wiman {{was the only one}} interested in musical theater. Between 1930 and 1951 he produced more than 50 shows. The more significant productions include: The <b>Vinegar</b> <b>Tree</b> (1930), Gay Divorce (1932), She Loves Me Not (1933), On Your Toes (1936), Babes in Arms (1937), On Borrowed Time (1938), I Married an Angel (1938), Morning's at Seven (1939), By Jupiter (1942), and The Country Girl (1950).|$|E
50|$|After Alexander died, {{the lease}} {{was taken over}} by Gilbert Miller, the American impresario, who later {{purchased}} the theatre and owned it up to its eventual sale for re-development and demolition. The first play of the new era was The Eyes of Youth, which ran for 383 performances. In 1923, The Green Goddess, by William Archer, started its run of 417 performances. Sir Gerald du Maurier was actor-manager of the St James's for several years in the 1920s and '30s. He had appeared there as Lord Arthur Dilling in The Last of Mrs. Cheyney by Frederick Lonsdale (1925), which ran for 514 performances, being succeeded in that role by Henry Daniell. Interference (1927), by Ronald Pertwee and Harold Dearden was another big success and ran for 412 performances. Daniell appeared again at the St James's in 1928 as Satollyon in The Return Journey and in 1932 as Max Lawrence in The <b>Vinegar</b> <b>Tree.</b> In 1929, Alfred Lunt made his London debut with his wife Lynn Fontanne in the Theatre Guild production of Caprice. A number of very successful plays ran at the theatre in the 1930s and '40s, including Agatha Christie's Ten Little Niggers, which was interrupted when a bomb damaged the roof of the theatre in 1944.|$|E
