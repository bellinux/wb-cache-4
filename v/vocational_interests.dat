2500|$|The {{terminology}} of the MBTI {{has been}} criticized as being very [...] "vague and general", so as to allow any kind of behavior to fit any personality type, which may result in the Forer effect, where people give a high rating to a positive description that supposedly applies specifically to them. [...] Others argue that while the MBTI type descriptions are brief, they are also distinctive and precise. Some theorists, such as David Keirsey, have expanded on the MBTI descriptions, providing even greater detail. For instance, Keirsey's descriptions of his four temperaments, which he correlated with the sixteen MBTI personality types, show how the temperaments differ in terms of language use, intellectual orientation, educational and <b>vocational</b> <b>interests,</b> social orientation, self-image, personal values, social roles, and characteristic hand gestures.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to compare the results from two <b>vocational</b> <b>interest</b> blanks, the Job Activity Preference Questionnaire (JAPQ) and the Strong <b>Vocational</b> <b>Interest</b> Blank (SVIB) in the {{prediction}} of grade point averages (GPA) for university students. An investigation was also made {{to determine if the}} variable <b>vocational</b> <b>interest</b> would contribute to a multiple r composed of American College Test (ACT) scores and GPA. One hundred students were administered both instruments and predictions made of their GPA 2 ̆ 7 s after the completion of two quarters of classroom study and after the completion of the most recent quarter of classroom study. It was found that the predictions from the JAPO were as good as or better than predictions based on SVIB achievement scores. For the 36 males in the sample a corrected multiple correlation coefficient of. 48 resulted between Undergraduate Cumulative grade Point Average (UCGPA) and the JAPQ Job Dimension Score whereas the SVIB Achievement Scale secured a correlation of. 21. The JAPQ correlation is significant at the. 005 level, but the SVIB correlation is insignificant. When the 64 females in the sample were tested the JAPQ secured a corrected multiple correlation coefficient of. 40, while the SVIB secured a cross-validation coefficient of. 31 between interest and UCGPA. The JAPO correlation is significant at the. 005 level and the SVIB correlation is significant at the. OS level. It was found that for the 22 males in the sample, for which ACT scores were available, when the variable <b>vocational</b> <b>interest,</b> as measured by the JAPQ or the SVIB, is added to the ACT it increases the correlation with GPA from. 13 to. 63 with the JAPQ and from. 13 to. 23 with the SVIB. However, for the 46 females in the sample, who had available ACT scores, the gain in adding the variable <b>vocational</b> <b>interest</b> to the combined prediction of ACT and GPA is negligible.

40|$|Multiple {{theories}} regarding vocational choice {{have suggested}} that personality may be meaningfully related to <b>vocational</b> <b>interest</b> and <b>vocational</b> self-efficacy (Barrick, Mount, 2 ̆ 6 Gupta, 2003; Larson and Borgen, 2006; Larson, Rottinghaus, 2 ̆ 6 Borgen, 2002; Nauta, 2007), {{as well as the}} underlying mechanism (Hansen et al., 2011). One limitation in the literature of understanding the linkages between personality traits and interest and self-efficacy may be that personality traits have only been conceptualized from two dominant models, namely the Big Five (Costa 2 ̆ 6 McCrae, 1992) and the Big Three (Tellegen, 2000). As discussed by Larson (2011), the use of additional models of personality may lead to greater understanding of key factors of <b>vocational</b> <b>interest</b> and self-efficacy.
