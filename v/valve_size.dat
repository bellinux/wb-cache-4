Methods: After AVR, two patient groups with a range of <b>valve</b> <b>sizes</b> were studied. Group 1 patients (n = 19) each received a monoleaflet valve; group 2 patients (n = 18) each received a bileaflet valve. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed at rest and after graded bicycle ergometry to assess prosthetic valve parameters, including mean and peak transvalvular gradient and effective orifice area (EOA). Results: Transprosthetic gradients (mean and peak) measured at rest, maximum exercise and 3 - min recovery were related to indexed geometric orifice area (IGOA) by an exponential decay function, with no significant advantage for either valve design. However, in <b>valve</b> <b>sizes</b> ≤ 25 mm the bileaflet valves demonstrated lower gradients, both at rest and under exercise conditions (mean gradient during exercise, bileaflet versus monoleaflet 19. 9 ± 7. 2 mmHg versus 25. 6 ± 6. 3 mmHg, p = 0. 01). Similarly, EOAs were larger in the bileaflet group when equivalent GOAs ≤ 2. 5 cm 2 were compared (EOA: bileaflet versus monoleaflet 1. 51 ± 0. 33 cm 2 versus 1. 14 ± 0. 26 cm 2, p = 0. 018). The total work performed correlated with prosthesis diameter (r 2 = 0. 81, p = 0. 037) and was not influenced by valve design.

40|$|Porcine bioprostheses are physiologically {{stenotic}} valves. Degenerative calcification {{leading to}} pathologic stenosis is an increasingly recognized serious late complication of mitral valve replacement with a porcine bioprosthesis. Hemodynamic differentiation of pathologic from physiologic stenosis {{is important for}} identification of porcine bioprosthetic valve dysfunction. In 42 patients with a normal Hancock porcine bioprosthesis (standard model, sizes 27 to 33 mm), mean diastolic flow (65 to 461 ml/s), mean gradient (2. 0 to 13. 4 mm Hg) and effective orifice area (1. 1 to 4. 4 cm 2) were determined at rest, during epicardial pacing (90, 110 and 130 /min) and with isoproterenol infusion. A statistically significant increase in mean gradient occurred with increases in flow and decreases in <b>valve</b> <b>size</b> (p < 0. 05). Effective orifice area increased significantly as flow rate increased and as <b>valve</b> <b>size</b> increased (p < 0. 05). These measurements were compared with those in 16 patients with pathologically confirmed porcine bioprosthetic valve stenosis: 8 patients with reoperation (1. 1 % per patient-year) 3 to 8. 5 years after mitral valve replacement and 8 previously reported abnormal cases. Stenotic failure rate was inversely related to <b>valve</b> <b>size</b> (2. 1, 1. 4, 0. 5 and 0 % per patient-year for sizes 27 to 33 mm). Stenotic and normal bioprostheses were not accurately differentiated {{on the basis of}} a single value for gradient or effective orifice area. A mathematical model that related flow to the square root of the mean gradient allowed complete separation of stenotic from normal prosthetic valve function, after <b>valve</b> <b>size</b> was accounted for and normal confidence limits were established (r = 0. 74 to 0. 94, sizes 27 to 33, p < 0. 0001).

This technique {{takes into account the}} spacial orientation of the stentless bioprosthesis in the aortic root with respect to the patient’s coronary ostia rather than the native commissures. Methods: Fifty-two consecutive patients with predominant aortic valve stenosis underwent aortic valve replacement with a Freestyle bioprosthesis by means of the described modified subcoronary technique over a 15 -month period. Fifty of them were followed up by means of echocardiography at discharge, 6 months, and 1 year. There were 19 men and 31 women, {{with a mean age of}} 76 ± 7 years (range, 58 - 87 years). <b>Valve</b> <b>size</b> ranged from 21 to 27 mm. Results: Patients with bicuspid aortic valves had a significantly larger angle between both coronary ostia than patients with tricuspid aortic valves (P =. 0001). The peak and mean systolic gradients decreased significantly during the first postoperative year for each <b>valve</b> <b>size</b> (P ≤. 001), and the effective valve areas increased significantly during this time interval for each <b>valve</b> <b>size</b> (P ≤. 01). Only 13 patients had aortic insufficiency at discharge, which was trivial in 9 and mild in 4 patients. The prevalence of trivial aortic insufficiency decreased during the first postoperative year, and that of mild aortic insufficiency remained unchanged. The sinotubular junction diameter was significantly greater than that of the aortic anulus for each <b>valve</b> <b>size</b> before operation (P <. 001). The sinotubular junction diameter decreased significantly after aortic valve replacement and remained unchanged during the first postoperative year for each <b>valve</b> <b>size</b> (P <. 001). Conclusions: Aortic valve replacement with the Freestyle bioprosthesis using the modified subcoronary technique, which takes into account the spacial orientation of the patient’s coronary ostia, has hemodynamic results similar to those of other series with different subcoronary implantation techniques. This technique is reproducible, safe at the coronary ostial level, and effective in accommodating variability in angles between human coronary ostia, ranging from 130 ° to 170 °.

A total of 205 consecutive patients (mean age 73 +/- 6 years; 120 men, 85 women) received a Freestyle stentless porcine aortic valve and were studied prospectively by echocardiography from 1 week to 5 years. Internal diameters of outflow tract, annulus, sinus, sinotubular junction, and ascending aortic root were measured at early ejection and indexed to stentless <b>valve</b> <b>size.</b> The degree of stentless valve regurgitation was semiquantified by color Doppler echocardiography. A total of 701 echocardiographic studies were obtained and analyzed; 73 % showed a fully competent stentless valve (nAR) and 13 % and 14 %, respectively, showed a trivial (tAR) or mild (mAR) regurgitation. Sinotubular junction of tAR or mAR was significantly greater than that of nAR (111 +/- 1. 9, 117 +/- 2. 2 vs. 104 +/- 1. 0, percentage of <b>valve</b> <b>size,</b> P<. 001). A preoperative diagnosis of aortic regurgitation (110 +/- 2. 6 vs. 104 +/- 1. 0, percentage of <b>valve</b> <b>size,</b> P<. 001) and 4 to 5 -year follow-up time (116 +/- 2. 2 vs. 107 +/- 2. 9, percentage of <b>valve</b> <b>size,</b> P =. 023) were associated with a greater sinotubular junction, although the incidence and mean grade of stentless valve regurgitation did not change significantly during the follow-up period. Up to medium-term follow-up evaluation, the incidence of moderate stentless aortic regurgitation is less than 5 %. The nature of valve disease and age-related increase in sinotubular junction may have reduced the cusp coaptation area of the stentless valve and may predict the presence of a trivial or mild regurgitation.

Therefore hemodynamic comparisons between prosthetic valves are inaccurate if based solely on industry-labeled <b>valve</b> <b>sizes.</b> Methods: We have previously demonstrated that the internal diameter of a 21 -mm Carpentier-Edwards pericardial stented valve {{is similar to that of}} a 25 -mm Toronto stentless porcine valve. Therefore we chose to compare postoperative hemodynamics in patients who received 19 -, 21 -, or 23 -mm Carpentier-Edwards pericardial stented valves (inner diameter 18 - 22 mm, n = 69) with those in patients who received 23 - or 25 -mm stentless porcine valves (internal diameter 19 - 21 mm, n = 41). Results: Patients in the Carpentier-Edwards group were more likely to be elderly and more likely to require concomitant revascularization. Operative mortality was lower in the stentless porcine valve group (0 % vs 9 %, P =. 06). Hospital stay and ventilation requirements were shorter in the stentless porcine valve group. Postoperative hemodynamics were similar in the two groups. Conclusions: These data provide evidence that stentless and stented valves have similar hemodynamic profiles in the small aortic root when matched on true measured internal diameters.
