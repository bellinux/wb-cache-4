40|$|An {{intake valve}} {{arrangement}} for positively controlling {{the opening and}} closing of the <b>poppet</b> <b>valve</b> in a hot gas cylinder in a hydrazine powered engine is described. The <b>poppet</b> <b>valve</b> is operated by the piston and gas pressure only. The <b>poppet</b> <b>valve</b> uses a pneumatic spring which holds the <b>poppet</b> <b>valve</b> against the piston while the valve is opened and closed. To accomplish this, a <b>poppet</b> <b>valve</b> is slidably mounted in a pneumatic spring chamber which reaches a pressure approaching the gas supply pressure and, during {{the opening of the}} valve, the spring chamber retains enough pressure to hold the <b>poppet</b> <b>valve</b> onto the piston.

40|$|Abstract only availableIn recent years, the <b>poppet</b> <b>valve</b> {{has begun}} to serve more {{versatile}} purposes. Before now, the <b>poppet</b> <b>valve</b> was mainly used for emergency release valves while the spool valve was more widely used. The <b>poppet</b> <b>valve</b> has several advantages over the spool <b>valve.</b> The <b>poppet</b> <b>valve</b> forms a tighter seal with the housing to prevent leakage of the hydrolic fluid flowing through the system. The <b>poppet</b> <b>valve</b> is smaller and weighs less than the spool valve and {{will be able to}} give a faster response time. The problem with the <b>poppet</b> <b>valve</b> is that it is under high pressure that needs to be equalized to keep the poppets in balance.

50|$|Other freeflows may {{be caused}} by the second stage valve jamming due to grit or {{corrosion}} products fouling the movement of the <b>valve</b> <b>poppet,</b> or the purge valve sticking in the depressed position. These can sometimes be stopped by pressing the purge button a few times to free up the works. If all else fails, the diver can breathe from a freeflowing demand valve by allowing excess air to escape from the sides of the mouth and the exhaust valve, which may allow a safe ascent, or at least the use of as much remaining gas as possible. When a full-face mask is used, excess gas will be vented through the exhaust valve and around the mask skirt, usually allowing the diver to continue to breathe without difficulty during the freeflow. This does not help after the cylinder has emptied.|$|E

40|$|This master thesis {{project was}} {{performed}} in collaboration with Scania CV AB, Engine Materials group. The purpose with the project was to investigate different ceramic TBC (Thermal Barrier Coating) thermal insulation properties inside the combustion chamber. Experimental testing was performed with a Single-Cylinder engine with TBC deposited on selected components. A dummy-valve was developed and manufactured specifically for this test in order to enable a water cooling system and to ease the testing procedure. The dummy-valve consists of a headlock, socket, <b>valve</b> <b>poppet</b> and valve shaft. Additionally, a copper ring is mounted between the cylinder head and the <b>valve</b> <b>poppet</b> to seal the system from combustion gases. Thermocouples attached to the modified <b>valve</b> <b>poppet</b> and valve shaft measured the temperature during engine test to calculate the heat flux. The TBCs consisted of three different materials: 7 - 8 % yttrium-stabilized zirconia (8 YSZ), gadolinium zirconia and lanthanum zirconia. The 8 YSZ TBC was tested as standard, but also with microstructural modifications. Modifications such as pre-induced segmented cracks, nanostructured zones and sealed porosity were used. The {{results indicated that the}} heat flux of 8 YSZ-standard, 8 YSZ-nano and 8 YSZ-segmented cracks was in level with the steel reference. In the case of 8 YSZ-sealed porosity the heat flux was measured higher than the steel reference. Since 8 YSZ-standard and 8 YSZ-sealed porosity are deposited with the same powder it is believed that the high heat flux is caused by radiative heat transfer. The remaining samples have had some microstructural changes during engine testing. 8 YSZ-nano had undergone sintering and its nanostructured zones became fewer and almost gone after engine testing leading to less heat barrier in the top coat of the TBC. However, for 8 YSZ-segmented cracks and gadolinium zirconia lower heat flux was measured due to the appearance of horizontal cracks. These cracks are believed to act as internal barriers as they are orientated perpendicular to the heat flow. During long-time (5 hour) engine tests the 8 YSZ-standard exhibited the same phenomena: a decrease in heat flux due to propagation of horizontal cracks. One-dimensional heat flux was not achieved and the main reason for that was caused by heating and cooling of the shafts outer surface. However, the dummy-valve system {{has proven to be a}} quick, easy and stable to perform tests with a Single-Cylinder engine. Both water-cooling and long-time engine tests were conducted with minor issues. The dummy-valve has been further developed for future tests. Changes to the valve shaft are the most remarkable: smaller diameter to reduce heat transfer and smaller pockets to ensure better thermocouple positioning. Another issue was gas leakage from the combustion chamber through the copper ring and <b>valve</b> <b>poppet</b> joint. The copper ring will be designed with a 1 mm thick track to improve sealing, hence better attachment to the <b>valve</b> <b>poppet...</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{mathematical}} model is derived {{that describes the}} dynamics of a single stage relief valve embedded within a simple hydraulic circuit. The aim is to capture the mechanisms of instability of such valves, taking into account both fluid compressibility and the chattering behaviour that can occur when the <b>valve</b> <b>poppet</b> impacts with its seat. The initial Hopf bifurcation causing oscillation {{is found to be}} either super- or sub-critical in different parameter regions. For flow speeds beyond the bifurcation, the valve starts to chatter, a motion that survives {{for a wide range of}} parameters, and can be either periodic or chaotic. This behaviour is explained using recent theory of nonsmooth dynamical systems, in particular an analysis of the grazing bifurcations that occur at the onset of impacting behaviour...|$|E

40|$|Fires {{in three}} P 3 {{aircraft}} oxygen systems have occurred: {{one in the}} Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in 1984 and two in the U. S. Navy in 1998 and 2003. All three fires started in the aluminum manifold and check valve (MCV) assembly and produced similar damages to the aircraft in which they occurred. This paper discusses a failure analysis conducted by the NASA Johnson Space Center White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) Oxygen Hazards and Testing Team on the 2003 U. S. Navy VP 62 fire. It was surmised that the fire started due to heat generated by an oxygen leak past a silicone check valve seal or possibly because of particle impact near the seat {{of one of the}} MCV assembly check valves. An additional analysis of fires in several check <b>valve</b> <b>poppet</b> seals from other aircraft is discussed. These burned poppet seals came from P 3 oxygen systems that had been serviced at the Naval Air Station (NAS) in Jacksonville following standard fill procedures. It was concluded that these seal fires occurred due to the heat from compression heating, particle impact, or the heat generated by an oxygen leak past the silicone check valve seal. The fact that catastrophic fires did not occur in the case of each check valve seal fire was attributed to the protective nature of the aluminum oxide layer on the check valve poppets. To prevent future fires of this nature, the U. S. and Canadian fleets of P 3 aircraft have been retrofitted with MCV assemblies with an upgraded design and more burn-resistant materials...|$|E

40|$|Mission Research Corporation (MRC) in {{cooperation}} with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) has developed a new small remote-controlled fluid valve. The motivation for developing this valve came from the requirements of a future International Space Station experiment called Microgravity Scaling Theory Experiment (MISTE). This experiment requires an in situ, low-temperature operated, fluid valve that can be open/closed over 50 times during a 4. 5 month flight. The successful operation of MISTE and other space-based and ground-based laboratory experiments now in development will require reliable cryogenic fluid valves that are remotely operated, helium leak tight, non-magnetic, very low power, and which have a small dead volume. The new valve is normally closed and requires fluid actuation at a pressure of approximately 600 kPa to open. The heart of the valve design is found in the configuration of the valve seat and sealing poppet. The design of these two surfaces was derived from work performed previously during a five year development program for a larger MRC remote-controlled, cryogenic fluid flow control valve. More than 50 of the larger valves have been produced and delivered for space flight applications. The new small valve has only three moving parts, which move less than 0. 012 cm when the valve fully opens or closes. The bearing surfaces in the valve operating mechanism are all flexure (except for the <b>valve</b> <b>poppet)</b> and thus the valve is expected to have a lifetime of thousands of open/close cycles. The materials and processes used to fabricate the new valve have been flight certified. Results from the first extensively tested prototype show repeatable behavior with a leak rate of typically 3 108 scc=s after the first open/close cycle at 4. 2 K, rising to about 106 scc=s after 100 cycles. Further tests and minor modifications are expected to improve the performance. 2002 Elsevie...|$|E

We then improved the prediction accuracy of the <b>poppet</b> <b>valve</b> behavior by applying the bubble mixing ratio obtained using the method in the numerical simulation model.
