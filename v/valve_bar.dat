50|$|It has {{traditionally}} {{had a reputation}} as a red-light district, particularly in its western half. With the decriminalisation of prostitution in the early 21st century, Vivian Street's 'reputation' is undergoing a revival, with the recent opening of Il Bordello Gentlemen's Club, and the reopening of the Liks Bar. Between these two establishments is a live music venue for underground musicians and other emerging artists of New Zealand, <b>Valve</b> <b>Bar.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Tempe’s {{commercial}} area is located along the Princes Highway. The main shopping strip includes the Tempe Hotel, a newsagency, {{a light and}} sound store, a doctor's surgery, a dentist's surgery, a Thai Restaurant and a picture framing business [...] "Frame Up". The Riverview Hotel, formerly <b>Valve</b> <b>Bar</b> and Venue, formerly the The Harp Irish Pub, and originally the Riverview Hotel (built in 1922), {{is located on the}} Princes Highway close to Harry's Cafe de Wheels, formerly known as Deno's Diner, formerly known as Cobb & Co., a fast food outlet designed on the 1950s drive-in model.|$|E
