5|$|A further fire {{broke out}} during the early morning of 14 December. Firefighters were of the view that {{extinguishing}} it would leave the risk of petroleum <b>vapour</b> re-igniting or exploding, {{so it would be}} better to allow the fire, which was well contained, to burn itself out. Hertfordshire Fire Service's deputy chief Mark Yates stated that escaping petroleum <b>vapour</b> was the most likely cause of the original explosion and fire.|$|E

40|$|This Letter {{describes}} a fabrication of a microsensor incorporating a novel customised nitro-sensitive polymer {{derived from the}} propylenedioxythiophene family. Electrochemical polymerisation was used to selectively grow different types of localised polymer films on interdigitated electrode arrays, thereby fabricating miniature sensors that exhibited a highly selective and reversible response to chemical <b>vapours</b> containing 'nitro' (NO 2) groups. Such nitro-bearing <b>vapours</b> are also present in trace quantities in {{the atmosphere in the}} presence of explosives. <b>Vapours</b> of nitropropane and nitrobenzene, serving as model analytes for explosives, were used for sensor testing. The sensors were demonstrated to have up to three orders of magnitude higher signal response to <b>vapours</b> from nitro compounds compared to other <b>vapours</b> commonly found in the atmosphere. The authors believe this is the highest selectivity to nitro compounds reported from a polymer-based chemicapacitor sensor...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{effect of}} thyme oil (96 μL L− 1) <b>vapours</b> on the {{expression}} of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and lipoxygenase(LOX) genes, and control of anthracnose was investigated in naturally infected ‘Hass’ and ‘Ryan’avocado fruit stored for 21 d at 7 – 7. 5 °C, and thereafter kept for 5 d at 20 °C, simulating the supply chainconditions. Exposure to thyme oil <b>vapours</b> prior to cold storage resulted in up-regulation of the PAL gene expressionin both ‘Hass’ and ‘Ryan’ avocado when compared with untreated fruit and those treated with prochloraz®. The higher expression of PAL gene was observed in ‘Ryan’. Thyme oil <b>vapours</b> exposure resulted in thehigher epicatechin content. At the same time, exposure to thyme oil <b>vapours</b> led to down-regulation of LOX geneexpression in both cultivars. Thus, simultaneous up-regulation of PAL gene and down-regulation of LOX gene inavocados exposed to thyme oil <b>vapours</b> prior to cold storage was associated with higher epicatechin content inthe fruit. Therefore, {{it can be concluded}} that postharvest application of thyme oil <b>vapours</b> increases anthracnosedisease resistance in ‘Hass’ and ‘Ryan’ avocado fruit...|$|R
40|$|Most {{gases and}} <b>vapours</b> with a bipolar {{molecular}} structure absorb infrared energy. If such a gas is interposed between an object emitting infrared radiation and a thermocamera the gas will absorb {{some of the}} infrared radiation and thus cast a shadow on the thermocamera picture. In this assay {{it is possible to}} visualise the gas. This method had been used to study pollution with anaesthetic gases and <b>vapours</b> in operating theatres. The <b>vapours</b> of other chemicals used in hospitals and other places of work also have been studied.

5|$|Data {{from the}} Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere {{satellite}} suggests that noctilucent clouds require water <b>vapour,</b> dust, and very cold temperatures to form. The sources {{of both the}} dust and the water <b>vapour</b> in the upper atmosphere are not known with certainty. The dust is believed to come from micrometeors, although particulates from volcanoes and dust from the troposphere are also possibilities. The moisture could be lifted through gaps in the tropopause, as well as forming from the reaction of methane with hydroxyl radicals in the stratosphere.|$|E
5|$|Sulfuric acid is {{produced}} in the upper atmosphere by the Sun's photochemical action on carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and water <b>vapour.</b> Ultraviolet photons of wavelengths less than 169 nm can photodissociate carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide and atomic oxygen. Atomic oxygen is highly reactive; when it reacts with sulfur dioxide, a trace component of the Venusian atmosphere, the result is sulfur trioxide, which can combine with water <b>vapour,</b> another trace component of Venus's atmosphere, to yield sulfuric acid.|$|E
5|$|Another type of {{atmospheric}} water collector {{makes use of}} desiccants which adsorb atmospheric water at ambient temperature, this {{makes it possible to}} extract moisture even when the relative humidity is as low as 14 percent. Systems of this sort have proved to be very useful as emergency supplies of safe drinking water. For regeneration, the desiccant needs to be heated. In some designs regeneration energy is supplied by the sun; air is ventilated at night over a bed of desiccants that adsorb the water <b>vapour.</b> During the day, the premises are closed, the greenhouse effect increases the temperature, and, as in solar desalination pools, the water <b>vapour</b> is partially desorbed, condenses on a cold part and is collected.|$|E
40|$|Cabinet-makers {{are exposed}} to {{formaldehyde}} <b>vapours</b> through their work with pressed woods which are bound with a formaldehyde compound glue, and also {{through the use of}} wood-finishing agents which contain formaldehyde. Fourteen cabinet-making establishments were monitored for their workers' exposure to formaldehyde <b>vapours</b> while also monitoring locations within their work environment. This study concentrated on levels of formaldehyde <b>vapours</b> at different locations which ranged from 0. 010 ppm to 0. 574 ppm over the four-hour monitoring period. These levels were below the occupational standard of 1 ppm. Personal monitoring generally gave results lower than the mean levels in the workplace. The major source of formaldehyde <b>vapours</b> was from pressed wood...|$|R
40|$|The study {{deals with}} the effects of Lavandula hybrida, Rosmarunus officinalis and Eucalyptus globulus {{essential}} oil <b>vapours</b> on the biology of Acanthoscelides obtectus and the toxicity of essential oil <b>vapours</b> in relation with their composition and seasonal variation. Moreover, the potentail of A. obtectus to develop resistance to essential oils was tested. Finally, the mechanisms of resistance, the effect of resistance on the biological potentialand the inheritance of resistance was studied. The essential oil <b>vapours</b> were toxic to larvae, pupae and eggs with LC_ 50 values rging between 0. 6 to 76 μl/l air, depending on the insects' stage and the essential oil. Moreover, following exposure to essential oil <b>vapours</b> and the ambient temperature during fumigation was found to have significant influence on the effectiveness of essential oil <b>vapours.</b> the assential oils content and toxicity varied, according to the season and the plant part. A strain of A. obtectus was selected for eight generations for resistance to lavender essential oils <b>vapours.</b> Selection resulted in 8. 6 and 4. 7 times more tolerant females ans males respectively. The cytochrome P 450 microsomal monooxygenases and the glutathione S-transferases were found {{to be involved in the}} observed resistance. Laboratory experiments were conducted to compare the fitness of strains of A. obtectus resistant and susceptible to lavender essential oil <b>vapours.</b> The comparison of the data showed differencies between the susceptible and resistance population in the fecundity, the developmental time and the survival. Analysis of probit lines from F_ 1 reciprocal crosses indicated that resistance to lavender essential oil <b>vapours</b> was inherited autosomaly as an incompletely recessive factor. The degree of dominance of resistance was - 0. 24. The χ^ 2 analysis if response ratio statistics from F 1 x susceptible backroses compared to a monogenic model suggested that one locus is responsible for the resistance to lavenfer essential oil <b>vapours.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|Climate models {{predict that}} {{increased}} {{greenhouse gas emissions}} cause a cooling of the mesosphere, which would lead to more frequent and widespread occurrences of noctilucent clouds. A complementing theory is that larger methane emissions from intensive farming activities produce more water <b>vapour</b> in the upper atmosphere.

5|$|In 1811, iodine was {{discovered}} by French chemist Bernard Courtois, who was born to a manufacturer of saltpeter (an essential component of gunpowder). At {{the time of the}} Napoleonic Wars, saltpeter was in great demand in France. Saltpeter produced from French nitre beds required sodium carbonate, which could be isolated from seaweed collected on the coasts of Normandy and Brittany. To isolate the sodium carbonate, seaweed was burned and the ash washed with water. The remaining waste was destroyed by adding sulfuric acid. Courtois once added excessive sulfuric acid and a cloud of purple <b>vapour</b> rose. He noted that the <b>vapour</b> crystallised on cold surfaces, making dark crystals. Courtois suspected that this material was a new element but lacked funding to pursue it further.|$|E

40|$|Solid-state sensors {{made from}} doped metal oxide ZnO and SnO 2 were {{prepared}} for detection of hydrogen peroxide <b>vapours.</b> Gas sensitive nanostructured films were manufactured by the high-frequency magnetron sputtering method. Thicknesses of deposited semiconductor nanostructured films were measured and its morphology was investigated. The average size of nanoparticles was equal to 18. 7 nm for deposited films. The response of the prepared sensors was measured at different temperatures of the sensor work body and different concentrations of hydrogen peroxide <b>vapours.</b> It was found that both La-doped ZnO and Co-doped SnO 2 sensors exhibit a sufficient sensitivity to 10 ppm of hydrogen peroxide <b>vapours</b> at the operating temperature 220 °C and 200 °C, respectively. It was established that the dependencies of the sensor sensitivity on hydrogen peroxide <b>vapours</b> concentration at the work body temperature 150 °C have a linear characteristic for both prepared structures {{and can be used}} for determination of hydrogen peroxide <b>vapours</b> concentration...|$|R

40|$|Fumigant {{toxicity}} {{of the essential}} oils from Lavandula hybrida, Rosmarinus officinalis and Eucalyptus globulus against the eggs of Acanthoscelides obtectus was assessed. The essential oil <b>vapours</b> were toxic to eggs with LC 50 values ranging between 1. 3 and 35. 1 mul/l air, depending on egg age and the essential oil. In all cases, the young eggs (less {{than or equal to}} 3 -day old) were more tolerant to essential oil <b>vapours</b> than the older ones (greater than or equal to 4 -day old). Apart from the inhibition of hatching, the exposure of eggs to essential oil <b>vapours</b> increased the subsequent mortality of hatched larvae.

The rats were exposed to ungraded concentrations of gasoline <b>vapours</b> (6 h daily) for 20 weeks. Vitamin A (retinol) at prophylactic dosage (400 IU kg - 1 day - 1) was orally administered to the rats {{in the last two}} weeks of exposure. The levels of haemoglobin (Hb), haematocrit or Packed Cell Volume (PCV), Red Blood Cells (RBC), weight gain and growth rate in the male and female rats exposed to the <b>vapours</b> were significantly lower (p< 0. 05) compared respectively to the levels obtained for male and female control rats. On the other hand, the levels of White Blood Cells (WBC) in the male and female test rats were significantly higher (p< 0. 05) compared respectively with the level obtained for male and female control rats. These observations indicated that exposure to gasoline <b>vapours</b> produced haematotoxicity, weight loss and growth depression in rats. However, administration of vitamin A was observed to produce a significant regain (p< 0. 05) in weight-loss, growth-depression and haematotoxicity observed to be associated with exposure to gasoline <b>vapours,</b> although the females were noted to respond more favourably than the males.
