40|$|In {{developing}} countries (like in Nigeria), growth in urbanization {{and in the}} number of vehicles has led to increased traffic congestion in urban centers and an increase in Road Traffic Craches(RTCs) which were never designed for the volumes and types of traffic that they are now carrying. This applies to Akure-Ondo highway. A five year accident record (2007 - 2011) obtained from Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC) indicates that 434 persons were involved in about 58 accidents that occurred within this five-year period, 234 persons were injured and 46 persons were killed. Five locations called “Black Spots” were identified, namely, Positive FM, Akpomu, Owena, Bolorunduro and Oboto. These are the accident prone locations. Field data such as, Speed of <b>Vehicles,</b> <b>Carriage</b> Width, Shoulder Width, Presence of Road Signs, Pavement and Shoulder Conditions and so on were obtained from site survey. These data were further used to assess the accident proneness of these locations...|$|R

40|$|The current {{threats to}} U. S. {{security}} both {{military and civilian}} have led to an increased interest {{in the development of}} technologies to safeguard national facilities such as military bases, federal buildings, nuclear power plants, and national laboratories. As a result, the Imaging, Robotics, and Intelligent Systems (IRIS) Laboratory at The University of Tennessee (UT) has established a research consortium, known as SAFER (Security Automation and Future Electromotive Robotics), to develop, test, and deploy sensing and imaging systems for unmanned ground vehicles (UGV). The targeted missions for these UGV systems include—but are not limited to—under vehicle threat assessment, stand-off check-point inspections, scout surveillance, intruder detection, obstaclebreach situations, and render-safe scenarios. This paper presents a general overview of the SAFER project. Beyond this general overview, we further focus on a specific problem where we collect 3 D range scans of under <b>vehicle</b> <b>carriages.</b> These scans require appropriate segmentation and representation algorithms to facilitate the vehicle inspection process. We discuss the theory for these algorithms and present results from applying them to actual vehicle scans...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the context}} of {{transport}} economics and planning, crush load refers to the maximum level of passenger load for a particular <b>vehicle</b> or rail <b>carriage.</b> Crush loads are calculated {{for the number of}} passengers per unit area, standing up.|$|R

Like many early companies, production was small, only about 400 units a year, including hearses, all designed by Volney Lacey.|$|R
5000|$|Some of the {{earliest}} known amphibious <b>vehicles</b> were amphibious <b>carriages,</b> the invention of which is credited to the Neapolitan polymath Prince Raimondo di Sangro of Sansevero [...] in July 1770 or earlier, or Samuel Bentham whose design of 1781 was built in June 1787.|$|R
5000|$|... "Three-phase" [...] {{carriages}} are popular, {{especially at}} entry levels, as drivers need only one <b>vehicle.</b> These <b>carriages</b> have extending axles {{to make the}} rear wheels the required width for the dressage and cones phases (currently 138 cm minimum for all pony and for single and tandem horse classes). All carriages for the marathon phase are 125 cm minimum track width, measured {{on the ground and}} on the rear wheels. For Indoor driving trials, carriages should be a minimum of 125 cm for all phases.|$|R
40|$|Upon the {{proclamation}} {{of a state}} of war in 1914, general mobilisation was carried out in the Dubrovnik District which, besides the military forces and conscripted soldiers, included logistic support and supplies without which the troops could not act efficiently in long-term war operations. This article is based on the archival sources housed in the State Archives of Zadar, in the archival fond Tajni spisi c. k. Dalmatinskog Namjesništva (1814 - 1918). The bulk of the material pertains to the mobilisation of the Home Guard (Landsturm), volunteers, horses, cattle and <b>vehicles</b> (<b>carriages,</b> wagons, motor <b>vehicles)</b> in the District of Dubrovnik during 1914. Having analysed the documents from the mentioned fond, the authors have reconstructed the mobilisation procedure in the municipalities of the District of Dubrovnik which, like {{in the rest of the}} Austrian provinces, was carried out according to the Military Law of the Dual Monarchy, in that the civil authorities of the district and the municipality showed utmost strictness in performing the tasks dictated by the military authorities. The analysis of archival sources casts light on various social and economic features of the District of Dubrovnik on the eve of World War I, providing a specific inventory of cattle, horses, motor vehicles, and other means of transport...|$|R
5000|$|The Employment Act 2002 {{extended}} {{rights to}} paternity, maternity, and adoption leave and pay, while the Police Reform Act 2002 established community support officers and reorganised national intelligence gathering.

The International Development Act 2002 required spending {{to be used to}} reduce poverty and improve the welfare of the poor. The Travel Concessions (Eligibility) Act 2002 equalised the age at which men and women become entitled to travel concessions. Under the Homelessness Act 2002, councils had to adopt homelessness strategies and do more for those homeless through no fault of their own, and the Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002 made it easier to convert long-term residential leasehold into freehold through [...] "commonhold" [...] tenures. The British Overseas Territories Act 2002 extended full British citizenship to 200,000 inhabitants of 14 British Overseas Territories, while the Office of Communications Act 2002 set up a new regulatory body known as the Office of Communications (Ofcom). The Enterprise Act 2002 included measures to safeguard consumers, while also reforming bankruptcy and establishing a stronger Office of Fair Trading.|$|R

One of the <b>carriage</b> <b>vehicles</b> was replaced in 1921, and further trailer acquired from the Dublin and Lucan tramway in 1928. At its peak it carriage 100000 passengers, and ran 21,000 miles in a year.|$|R
50|$|In 1900 the gun <b>carriage</b> <b>vehicle</b> was {{modified}} into a sturdier four-wheeler which eventually became the Davidson Automobile Battery armored car, a lightly armored military vehicle. Davidson, {{inventor of the}} first military vehicle in the United States, received little credit from the Army for his efforts {{of being the first}} to build armored cars in the United States.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} known {{implementation of}} road space rationing {{took place in}} Rome, as carriages and carts pulled by horses created serious congestion problems in several Roman cities.

50|$|A {{carriage}} is a {{wheeled vehicle}} for people, usually horse-drawn; litters (palanquins) and sedan chairs are excluded, {{since they are}} wheelless <b>vehicles.</b> The <b>carriage</b> is especially designed for private passenger use, though some are also used to transport goods. A public passenger vehicle would not usually be called a carriage - terms for such include stagecoach, charabanc and omnibus. It may be light, smart and fast or heavy, large and comfortable or luxurious. Carriages normally have suspension using leaf springs, elliptical springs (in the 19th century) or leather strapping. Working vehicles such as the (four-wheeled) wagon and (two-wheeled) cart share important parts {{of the history of}} the carriage, as does too the fast (two-wheeled) chariot.|$|R
50|$|The skipped railmotor engine {{number was}} {{allocated}} to a Kitson-built railmotor with a 56-seat passenger capacity which {{was placed in}} service in 1907. In service, the imported railmotor no. M2 {{was found to be}} less satisfactory than the home-built railmotor engine no. M1, which was considered to be superior in aspects like design, passenger comfort, economy in running and convenience in working. Since the imported railmotor was a single <b>vehicle,</b> the <b>carriage</b> was unusable while the engine had to be withdrawn for service or repairs. The Pretoria-built modified carriage was still readily detachable from the locomotive and both engine and carriage were still complete units which could be used independently of each other.|$|R
