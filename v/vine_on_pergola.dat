40|$|We {{present a}} {{sampling}} algorithm for a regular <b>vine</b> <b>on</b> $n$ variables which starts at an arbitrary variable. A sampling order whose nested conditional probabilities {{can be written}} as products of (conditional) copulas in the vine and univariate margins {{is said to be}} implied by the regular vine. We show that there are $ 2 ^{n- 1 }$ implied sampling orders for any regular <b>vine</b> <b>on</b> $n$ variables. We show that two regular <b>vines</b> <b>on</b> $n$ and $m$ distinct variables can be merged in $ 2 ^{n+m- 2 }$ ways. This greatly simplifies the proof of the number of regular <b>vines</b> <b>on</b> $n$ variables. A notion of sampling proximity based on numbers of shared implied sampling orders is introduced, and we use this notion to define a heuristic for searching vine space that avoids proximate vines...|$|R
