Fielded in 1982, the Microfix system was the first tactical system using <b>video</b> <b>disk</b> (Laserdisk) map technology providing zoom and scroll over map imagery coupled with a point database of intelligence data such as order of battle, airfields, roadways, and bridges. President Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative resulted in the largest research contract in Georgia Tech's history in 1985. The $21.3 million contract (equivalent to $ million in [...] ) was divided between GTRI and the School of Electrical Engineering. [...] GTRI landed its own largest-ever contract in 1986$14.7 million (equivalent to $ million in [...] ) to create a Soviet surface-to-air missile system simulator. In 1989, as part of a project with the U.S. Army, and using technology it had been developing since the late 1960s, GTRI completed the largest outdoor compact antenna range at Fort Huachuca, Arizona.|$|E
500|$|The oldest form {{of student}} media at Texas State was a {{yearbook}} originally called the Pedagogue and later renamed the Pedagog. [...] It {{was first published}} in 1904 and served to record each year's events through photographs and articles. [...] It was temporarily discontinued in 1975 due to a combination of the cost to publish the annual and a lack of student interest. [...] It was published again in 1978 as part of the school's seventy-fifth anniversary. [...] In 1984 it resumed regular publication. [...] However, it was last published in 2000 after university committees recommended replacing the printed yearbook with a <b>video</b> <b>disk</b> containing the same contents. [...] The annual has since been discontinued entirely. [...] Now called the University Star, it publishes coverage of the college's news, trends, opinions and sports. [...] The newspaper is published on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays while classes are in session in the fall and spring semesters. The paper is published five times during the summer. The Star has a web site which contains videos, blogs and podcasts in addition to the articles that are published in the print version of the paper. The Star and its staff have received awards including merits from Hearst Journalism, the Texas Intercollegiate Press Association and the Society of Professional Journalists.|$|E

40|$|In this letter, {{we propose}} a {{two-stage}} object-based error-concealment technique for MPEG- 2 video transmitted in a burst-packet-loss environment. A burst packet loss typically destroys {{a large area}} of MPEG- 2 coded video. In the first stage, the missing area is intra-picture estimated and concealed {{in terms of a}} region-based approach. In the second stage, irregular-moving objects with respect to the background are identified and compensated from the predictive picture. As compared with conventional concealment approaches, the proposed method achieves better PSNR performance and reduces the visual artifacts. Key words: error concealment, error-resilient coding, robust video transmission, MPEG- 2 The MPEG- 2 coded video has proliferated owing to the wide adoption of digital <b>video</b> <b>disks</b> (DVD) and digita...|$|R

50|$|Olyphant is a borough in Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania, {{approximately}} five miles (8 km) northeast of Scranton on the Lackawanna River {{in the heart}} of the anthracite region of the State.

There was once a thriving garment industry with numerous dress factories in the downtown area. There was also a slaughter house.

40|$|Abstract — The next {{generation}} of high-energy physics experiments is expected to gather prodigious amounts of data. New methods must be developed to handle this data and make analysis at universities possible. We examine some techniques that use recent developments in commodity hardware. We test redundant arrays of integrated drive electronics (IDE) disk drives for use in offline high-energy physics data analysis. IDE redundant array of inexpensive disks (RAID) prices now equal the cost per terabyte of million-dollar tape robots! The arrays can be scaled to sizes affordable to institutions without robots and used when fast random access at low cost is important. We also explore three methods of moving data between sites; internet transfers, hot pluggable IDE disks in FireWire cases, and writable digital <b>video</b> <b>disks</b> (DVD-R) ...|$|R
