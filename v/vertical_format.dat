5|$|The Battle of Alexander at Issus {{is painted}} on a limewood panel {{measuring}} , and portrays {{the moment of}} Alexander the Great's victory. The <b>vertical</b> <b>format</b> was dictated by the space available in the room for which the painting was commissioned – each in William's set of eight was made {{to be the same}} size. At an unknown date, the panel was cut down on all sides, particularly at the top, so the sky was originally larger and the moon further from the corner of the scene. The scene is approached from an impossible viewpoint – at first only feet from the fray, the perspective gradually ascends to encompass the seas and continents in the background and eventually the curvature of the Earth itself.|$|E

50|$|Since it is {{horizontal}} {{rather than}} vertical {{it was probably}} commissioned for a private collection {{rather than as an}} altarpiece. Peter C. Sutton suggested that, as Rubens' treatments of this subject in <b>vertical</b> <b>formats</b> were for known ecclesiastical commissions as altarpieces, the horizontal format, which is shared with Rubens' Adoration painted for the Statenkamer of Antwerp's town hall, c. 1608-09, might suggest that the Lyon painting was also a secular commission. Rubens made a considerable fortune via the painting's reproduction in engravings and tapestries.|$|R
25|$|The {{earliest}} codices of the Quran {{found in}} the Umayyad period were most likely made in single volumes, which can be determined from the large fragments that have survived. Also during this time, {{the format of the}} codex went from being vertical to horizontal in the 8th century. It is believed this change to horizontal formats and thick/heavy-looking scripts may have been done to show the superiority of the Quran and to distinguish the Islamic tradition from the Jewish and Christian ones, who used <b>vertical</b> <b>formats</b> for their scriptures.|$|R

50|$|Canadian {{regulation}} tightly {{controls the}} manner in which the nutrition fact table (NFT) data are laid out. There is a wide variety of possible formats for use on a given food package. A selection hierarchy is used to select among the many formats (28 main formats, and 2-7 sub formats for each). This results in standard (<b>vertical)</b> <b>formats</b> being considered for use before horizontal and linear formats. The selection hierarchy also allows the NFT to occupy no more than 15% of the physical package's available display area (ADS), but never to be smaller than a format that would be <=15% of ADS. In practice, determining the ADS of a package, and selecting the appropriate NFT format, can be a detailed calculation.|$|R

GSP is the Apriori based Horizontal formatting method, SPADE is the Apriori based <b>vertical</b> <b>formatting</b> method and Prefix-SPAN is Projection-based pattern growth method. This paper elaborate step wise explanation of each algorithm demonstrating number of iterations required in each algorithm. Later a comparison is made between Total time required to execute algorithm, count of frequent sequences found and Max memory (in mb) required by algorithms GSP, SPADE and Prefix-SPAN. The above stated attributes i. e. total time; frequent sequences and Max Memory are obtained using SPMF (A sequential Pattern Mining Framework) ...|$|R

Unlike other Fauve works of the same period by Henri Matisse, André Derain, Maurice de Vlaminck or Kees van Dongen, Metzinger's composition is strongly Cézannian. The <b>vertical</b> <b>format</b> and background structure creates a flattening of spatial perspective, reminiscent of Cézanne's 'multiple viewpoints', his search for order, discipline and permanence.

Guido Reni's early (1611) Massacre of the Innocents, in an unusual <b>vertical</b> <b>format,</b> is at Bologna. The Flemish painter Peter Paul Rubens painted the theme more than once. One version, now in Munich, was engraved and reproduced as a painting as far away as colonial Peru. Another, his grand Massacre of the Innocents is now at the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto.

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that integrating classification and association rule mining can produce {{more efficient and}} accurate classifiers than traditional techniques. This thesis introduces a new MapReduce based association rule miner for extracting strong rules from large datasets. This miner is used later {{to develop a new}} large scale classifier. Also new MapReduce simulator was developed to evaluate the scalability of proposed algorithms on MapReduce clusters. The developed associative rule miner inherits the MapReduce scalability to huge datasets and to thousands of processing nodes. For finding frequent itemsets, it uses hybrid approach between miners that uses counting methods on horizontal datasets, and miners that use set intersections on datasets of <b>vertical</b> <b>formats.</b> The new miner generates same rules that usually generated using apriori-like algorithms because it uses the same confidence and support thresholds definitions. In the last few years, a number of associative classification algorithms have been proposed...|$|R
500|$|A free copy {{from some}} two generations later {{is in the}} Prado in Madrid. This is in a <b>vertical</b> <b>format</b> and {{measures}} 47 x 36cm. [...] A large tree is added at the left, and the foreground rocks extended higher. [...] The landscape is somewhat different, and reflects the world landscape style of Joachim Patinir, to whom the painting has been attributed in the past. [...] This was largely because the jagged peaks in the distance {{have been added to}} and altered to Patinir's trademark depiction of the distinctive landscape of Dinant, his hometown. This panel was attributed by Max Jakob Friedländer to a [...] "Master of Hoogstraten", an anonymous follower of Quentin Massys, and dated around 1510. [...] The awkwardness of the figures has been rectified, the placement of his feet and knees [...] "made more rational" [...] according to Rishel, but St Francis stares at the apparition. Another copy, placed tentatively in Brussels c.1500, is probably a copy of the Turin version.|$|E
500|$|Albrecht Altdorfer is {{regarded}} as one of the founders of Western landscape art. He was a painter, etcher, architect, and engraver, and the leader of the Danube school of German art. As evidenced by such paintings as Saint George and the Dragon (1510) and [...] (1531), much of Altdorfer's work is characterised by an attachment to sprawling landscapes that dwarf the figures within them; The Battle of Alexander at Issus epitomises this facet of his style. With reference to St George and the Dragon in particular, art historian Mark W. Roskill comments that [...] "The accessory material of landscape [...] is played with and ornamentally elaborated so that it reverberates with the sense of a sequestered and inhospitable environment". Inspired by his travels around the Austrian Alps and the Danube River, Altdorfer painted a number of landscapes that contain no figures at all, including [...] (c. 1516) and [...] (c. 1522–25). These were the first [...] "pure" [...] landscapes since antiquity. Most of Altdorfer's landscapes were made with a <b>vertical</b> <b>format,</b> in contrast with the modern conception of the genre. The horizontal landscape was an innovation of Altdorfer's Flemish contemporary Joachim Patinir and his followers.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} miniatures appeared unframed horizontally {{across the}} page {{in the middle of}} text, following Byzantine and Arabic precedents, but in the 14th century the <b>vertical</b> <b>format</b> was introduced, perhaps influenced by Chinese scroll-paintings.

2500|$|Parry also {{suggests}} the [...] "unusual, but not impossible" [...] idea that Cole's Goblet was a landscape artist's {{answer to the}} still life genre. Visiting {{the home of his}} patron Luman Reed, an avid art collector, Cole would have seen a still-life painting [...] "with Goblet and Lemon" [...] by the 17th-century Dutch artist Willem van Aelst. [...] The highlight of that painting is a translucent glass goblet. The similarities are basic, with both paintings having a <b>vertical</b> <b>format</b> and an off-center drinking vessel.|$|E

2500|$|The British Museum has 51 thin gold plaques with incised designs, {{which are}} {{regarded}} as votive plaques left by devotees at a temple as an offering to the deity. They are mostly rectangular with the designs in a <b>vertical</b> <b>format,</b> and range from 2 to 20cm tall. Most show a single human figure facing left, many carrying a bunch of twigs called a barsom used in offerings; these probably represent the offeror. [...] The dress of the figures shows the types known as [...] "Median" [...] and [...] "Persian" [...] to modern historians, {{and the quality of}} the execution is mostly relatively low, but varies greatly, with some appearing to have been incised by amateurs. [...] Three show animals, a horse, a donkey and a camel; possibly it was their health that was the subject of the offering.

500|$|In the 1420s and 1430s, {{when oil}} and panel {{painting}} {{were still in}} their infancy, <b>vertical</b> <b>formats</b> were often used for depictions of the Last Judgement, because the narrow framing particularly suited a hierarchical presentation of heaven, earth and hell. By contrast, depictions of the Crucifixion were usually presented in a horizontal format. To fit such expansive and highly detailed representations onto two equally small and narrow wings, van Eyck was forced to make a number of innovations, redesigning many elements of the Crucifixion panel to match the vertical and condensed presentation of the Judgement narrative. The result is a panel with the crosses rising high into the sky, an unusually packed crowd scene in the mid-ground, and the moving spectacle of the mourners in the foreground, all rendered in a continuous slope from bottom to top {{in the style of}} medieval tapestries.

2500|$|Of the two Lamentations, one in Milan is in {{an unusual}} <b>vertical</b> <b>format,</b> because, like his 1474 Saint Sebastian, it was painted for {{the side of a}} pillar in the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore, Florence; it is now in Milan. [...] The other, horizontal, one was painted for a chapel on the corner of Botticelli's street; it is now in Munich. [...] In both the crowded, {{intertwined}} figures around the dead Christ take up nearly all the picture space, with only bare rock behind. [...] The Virgin has swooned, and the other figures form a scrum to support her and Christ. [...] The Munich painting has three less involved saints with attributes (somewhat oddly including Saint Peter, usually regarded as in Jerusalem on the day, but not present at this scene), and gives the figures (except Christ) flat halos shown in perspective, which from now on Botticelli often uses.

2500|$|He {{dominated}} landscape printmaking {{with his}} unique brand of intimate, almost small-scale works compared against the older traditions of landscape painting descended from Chinese landscape painters such as Sesshu. The travel prints generally depict travelers along famous routes experiencing the special attractions of various stops along the way. They {{travel in the}} rain, in snow, and during all of the seasons. In 1856, working with the publisher Uoya Eikichi, he created a series of luxury edition prints, made with the finest printing techniques including true gradation of color, the addition of mica to lend a unique iridescent effect, embossing, fabric printing, blind printing, {{and the use of}} glue printing (wherein ink is mixed with glue for a glittery effect). Hiroshige pioneered the use of the <b>vertical</b> <b>format</b> in landscape printing in his series Famous Views of the Sixty-odd Provinces. One Hundred Famous Views of Edo (issued serially between 1856 and 1859) was immensely popular.

2500|$|Bathsheba at Her Bath is a reinterpretation of two antique reliefs {{familiar}} to Rembrandt through engravings. A print by Tobias Stimmer {{may have been}} influential, as it includes the pillar, a curtain drawn across the background and Bathsheba's downcast gaze. It was begun around 1647 and altered and repainted until its completion in 1654. Originally the canvas may have been larger and of a <b>vertical</b> <b>format.</b> It might have been trimmed some ten centimeters at the left and at least 20 centimeters in height; It is speculated that Rembrandt cut the canvas himself in order to intensify {{the impact of the}} figure. [...] show that at some point late in the painting process, he lowered Bathsheba's head from its initial more upward angle, thereby increasing the sense of the figure's withdrawal into reverie. Initially she appeared to be looking {{out of the corner of}} her eye, as if watching David; in the present version her gaze is softened, in the general direction of her maid but focused on no particular object, imparting a feeling of solemnity and contemplation. There was no letter in her hand in the original conception, and it is also possible that her lap, thighs, and right arm were once draped.|$|E
