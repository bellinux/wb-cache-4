50|$|Dysprosody {{works on}} a {{linguistic}} level in that it specifies the intent of one’s speech. For example, prosody is responsible for verbal variations in interrogative versus declarative statements and serious versus sarcastic remarks. Linguistic dysprosody refers to the diminished ability to verbally convey aspects of sentence structure, such as placing stress on certain words for emphasis or using patterns of intonation to reveal the structure or intention of an utterance. For example, individuals with linguistic dysprosody may have difficulty distinguishing the production of interrogative and declarative sentences, switching or leaving out the expected rising and falling shift, respectively. Thus, linguistic dysprosody alters an individual’s vocal identity and <b>impairs</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>communication.</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} to explore the {{likelihood}} of a kinaesthetic user interface and algorithmically generated drawing tool to serve as an effective tool in art therapy. The author has assumed increasing the range of physical movement to full body can allow patients to reveal information about their mental and psychological state, which is to help achieve therapeutic goals. Based on this premise and the improvement upon current digital devices, a motion-sensing drawing tool has been created based on research findings to validate the impact of drawing and whole body movement on art therapy. With corroboration from research findings and artefacts, validated data were collected from art therapy practitioners and further analysed. The results indicate this tool can aid therapists’ achieving therapeutic goals by facilitating clients to express creatively. The clients who can benefit from this tool include people prone to <b>impaired</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>communication</b> and people with physical disabilities or emotional problems...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Velopharyngeal {{dysfunction}} {{may cause}} <b>impaired</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>communication</b> skills in individuals with cleft lip and palate; thus, patients with this disorder need to undergo both instrumental and auditory-perceptual assessments. Objective: To investigate the main {{methods used to}} evaluate velopharyngeal function in individuals with cleft lip and palate and {{to determine whether there}} is an association between videonasoendoscopy results and auditory-perceptual assessments. Method: We conducted a systematic review of the literature on instrumental and auditory-perceptual assessments. We searched the PubMed, Medline, Lilacs, Cochrane, and SciELO databases from October to November 2012. Summary of findings: We found 1, 300 studies about the topic of interest published between 1990 and 2012. Of these, 56 studies focused on velopharyngeal physiology; 29 studies presented data on velopharyngeal physiology using at least 1 instrumental assessment and/or 1 auditory-perceptual assessment, and 12 studies associated the results of both types of assessments. Only 3 studies described in detail the analysis of both methods of evaluating velopharyngeal function; however, associations between these findings were not analyzed. Conclusion: We found few studies clearly addressing the criteria chosen to investigate velopharyngeal dysfunction and associations between videonasoendoscopy results and auditory-perceptual assessments...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} support the {{residual}} <b>communication</b> capabilities of <b>verbal</b> <b>impaired</b> peoples softwares allowing Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) have been developed. AAC communication software aids provide verbal disables with an electronic table of AAC languages (i. e. Bliss, PCS, PIC, etc.) symbols in order to compose messages, exchange them via email, or vocally synthetize them, and so on. A current open issue, in thins kind of software, regards human-computer interaction in <b>verbal</b> <b>impaired</b> people suffering motor disorders. They can adopt only ad-hoc input device, such as buttons or switches, which require an intelligent automatic scansion of the AAC symbols table in order to compose messages. In such perspective we have developed CABA 2 L an innovative composition assistant exploiting an user linguistic behavior model adopting a semantic/probabilistic approach for predictive Bliss symbols scansion. CABA 2 L {{is based on an}} original discrete implementation of auto-regressive hidden Markov model called DAR-HMM and it is able to predict a list of symbols as the most probable ones according to both the previous selected symbol and the semantic categories associated to the symbols. We have implemented the composition assistant as a component of BLISS 2003 an AAC communication software centered on Bliss language and experimentally validated it with both synthetic and real data. ...|$|R

In this paper, we systematically review the variety of different measures in used in these fields, both global and local, before presenting a more finely tuned weighted clause ratio measure which classifies errors at different levels, i. e. those that seriously impede <b>communication,</b> those that <b>impair</b> <b>communication</b> to some degree, and those that do not <b>impair</b> <b>communication</b> at all. The problem of reliably identifying these levels is discussed, followed by an analysis of samples from written and spoken L 2 performance data.
