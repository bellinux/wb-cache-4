This note records the occurrence of a single phase vanadium smectite which is found with pitchblende insmall pockets and lenses in a uranium mine {{in the northern part}} of Converse County, Wyoming at a depth of 150 feet in the Eocene Wasatch Formation. The X-ray powder diffraction pattern of the oriented < 2 #m fraction of the clay shows a very strong 15. 0 + 0. 1 A reflection and a series of higher orders. When the clay is saturated with Na, the smectite displays abasal spacing of 12. 6 _+ 0 -IA, which expands to 16. 7 _+ 0 - 1 ~ upon glycol saturation. A b-lattice parameter of 9. 02 _+ 0. 2 A was obtained from the 060 reflection of the randomly oriented powder, indicating the presence of a dioctahedral smectite. Scanning electron images of the sample show that it possesses the typical flaky micro-fabric of smectites (Fig. la). The characteristic X-ray spectra (Fig. lb) obtained from these smectite flakes indicate Si and V as major elements, AI, Ca, and Mg as minor elements and K and U as trace elements.
