5|$|NGC 7410 is {{a spiral}} galaxy {{discovered}} by British astronomer John Herschel during observations at the Cape of Good Hope in October 1834. The galaxy has a <b>visual</b> <b>magnitude</b> of 11.7 and is approximately 122 million light years distant from Earth.|$|E
5|$|By {{matching}} {{up these}} curves on the HR diagram the absolute magnitude of main-sequence {{stars in the}} cluster can also be determined. This in turn provides a distance estimate to the cluster, based on the <b>visual</b> <b>magnitude</b> of the stars. The difference between the relative and absolute magnitude, the distance modulus, yields this estimate of the distance.|$|E
5|$|Phoenix {{contains}} HE0107-5240, possibly one of {{the oldest}} stars yet discovered. It has around 1/200,000 the metallicity that the Sun has and hence must have formed very early {{in the history of the}} universe. With a <b>visual</b> <b>magnitude</b> of 15.17, it is around 10,000 times dimmer than the faintest stars visible to the naked eye and is 36000 light years distant.|$|E
25|$|Epsilon Monocerotis is a fixed binary, with <b>visual</b> <b>magnitudes</b> of 4.5 and 6.5.|$|R
50|$|LP 944-20 is a dim {{brown dwarf}} of {{spectral}} class M9 located about 21 light-years from the Solar System {{in the constellation}} of Fornax. With a <b>visual</b> apparent <b>magnitude</b> of 18, it {{has one of the}} dimmest <b>visual</b> <b>magnitudes</b> listed on the RECONS page.|$|R
50|$|ADS 48 is a {{multiple}} star {{system in the}} constellation of Andromeda consisting of 7 stars. The components, in order from A to G, have apparent <b>visual</b> <b>magnitudes</b> of 8.83, 9.00, 13.30, 12.53, 11.68, 9.97, and 13.00.|$|R
5|$|The moons of Haumea are too faint {{to detect}} with telescopes smaller than about 2 metres in aperture, though Haumea itself has a <b>visual</b> <b>magnitude</b> of 17.5, {{making it the}} third-brightest object in the Kuiper belt after Pluto and Makemake, and easily {{observable}} with a large amateur telescope.|$|E
5|$|This type Ia {{category}} of supernovae produces consistent peak luminosity {{because of the}} uniform mass of white dwarfs that explode via the accretion mechanism. The stability of this value allows these explosions {{to be used as}} standard candles to measure the distance to their host galaxies because the <b>visual</b> <b>magnitude</b> of the supernovae depends primarily on the distance.|$|E
5|$|As all {{the stars}} of a {{globular}} cluster are at approximately the same distance from us, their absolute magnitudes differ from their <b>visual</b> <b>magnitude</b> by about the same amount. The main-sequence stars in the globular cluster will fall along a line that {{is believed to be}} comparable to similar stars in the solar neighborhood. The accuracy of this assumption is confirmed by comparable results obtained by comparing the magnitudes of nearby short-period variables, such as RR Lyrae stars and cepheid variables, with those in the cluster.|$|E
50|$|Supergiants {{are among}} the most massive and most {{luminous}} stars. Supergiant stars occupy the top region of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram with absolute <b>visual</b> <b>magnitudes</b> between about −3 and −8 with temperatures spanning from about 3,500 K to over 20,000 K.|$|R
40|$|The {{results are}} {{presented}} concerning statistical processing {{of a series of}} <b>visual</b> and photographic <b>magnitudes</b> for WZ Cas. The light distribution functions were determined, which appeared to be asymmetrical. Theoretical approximating distributions were calculated. The star is predominantly bright in yellow rays and faint in blue ones. The correlative analysis of <b>visual</b> <b>magnitudes</b> shows that the period of WZ Cas is not less than 400 days...|$|R
50|$|DI Cha is a {{variable}} {{star of the}} T Tauri type, young stellar objects just approaching the main sequence. It varies erratically between <b>visual</b> <b>magnitudes</b> 10.65 and 10.74. Although it is visually faint, it was noticed because of the prominent emission lines in its spectrum.|$|R
5|$|Beta Pictoris {{is a star}} in the {{southern}} constellation of Pictor, the Easel, and is located {{to the west of the}} bright star Canopus. It traditionally marked the sounding line of the ship Argo Navis, before the constellation was split. The star has an apparent <b>visual</b> <b>magnitude</b> of 3.861, so is visible to the naked eye under good conditions, though light pollution may result in stars dimmer than magnitude 3 being too dim to see. It is the second brightest in its constellation, exceeded only by Alpha Pictoris, which has an apparent magnitude of 3.30.|$|E
5|$|NGC 821 is an E6 {{elliptical}} galaxy. It {{is unusual}} {{because it has}} hints of an early spiral structure, which is normally only found in lenticular and spiral galaxies. NGC 821 is 2.6 by 2.0 arcminutes and has a <b>visual</b> <b>magnitude</b> of 11.3. Its diameter is 61,000 light-years and it is 80 million light-years away. Another unusual galaxy in Aries is Segue 2. Segue 2 is a dwarf galaxy that is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, recently discovered to be a potential relic of the epoch of reionization.|$|E
5|$|The {{twentieth century}} saw {{increasingly}} rapid {{advances in the}} scientific study of stars. The photograph became a valuable astronomical tool. Karl Schwarzschild discovered that the color of a star and, hence, its temperature, could be determined by comparing the <b>visual</b> <b>magnitude</b> against the photographic magnitude. The development of the photoelectric photometer allowed precise measurements of magnitude at multiple wavelength intervals. In 1921 Albert A. Michelson made the first measurements of a stellar diameter using an interferometer on the Hooker telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory.|$|E
5000|$|In addition, {{there are}} five faint listed in {{multiple}} star catalogues. They have <b>visual</b> <b>magnitudes</b> around 11th to 13th magnitude and separations of 35" [...] to 72". They all show motion relative to α Delphini A {{and are likely to}} be only optical companions.|$|R
40|$|Optical and UV {{spectrophotometric}} data of {{the central}} stars of eight Population II planetary nebulae are analyzed. From these data, we derive <b>visual</b> <b>magnitudes,</b> spectral classification, color temperatures and luminosities. All {{the stars in the}} sample show absorption type spectrum and most of them have normal H and He photospheric abundances, the only possible exceptions are M 2 - 29 and GJJC- 1 which seem to be H-deficient. The <b>visual</b> <b>magnitudes,</b> derived from UV stellar continuum, are in good agreement with published fluxes at lambda 5480. In the case of NGC 2242 we measured a value V = 17. 1 mag (from the lambda 5480 flux, wide band photometry and the UV extrapolation) instead of the 15. 02 mag reported previousl...|$|R
2500|$|Beta Monocerotis is {{a triple}} star system, the three stars forming a {{triangle}} {{which seems to}} be fixed. The <b>visual</b> <b>magnitudes</b> of the stars are 4.7, 5.2 and 6.1. William Herschel discovered it in 1781 and commented that it is [...] "one of the most beautiful sights in the heavens".|$|R
5|$|Tucana {{is not a}} {{prominent}} constellation as all of its stars are third magnitude or fainter; the brightest is Alpha Tucanae with an apparent <b>visual</b> <b>magnitude</b> of 2.87. Beta Tucanae is a star system with six member stars, while Kappa is a quadruple system. Five star systems {{have been found to}} have exoplanets to date. The constellation contains 47 Tucanae, one of the brightest globular clusters in the sky, and most of the Small Magellanic Cloud.|$|E
5|$|Located in {{the west}} of the {{constellation}} and depicting the peacock's tail are Eta and Xi Pavonis. At apparent magnitude 3.6, Eta is a luminous orange giant of spectral type K2II some 350 light years distant from Earth. Xi Pavonis is a multiple star system visible in small telescopes as a brighter orange star and fainter white companion. Located around 470 light years from Earth, the system has a magnitude of 4.38. AR Pavonis is a faint but well-studied eclipsing binary composed of a red giant and smaller hotter star some 18000 light years from Earth. It has some features of a cataclysmic variable, the smaller component most likely having an accretion disc. The <b>visual</b> <b>magnitude</b> ranges from 7.4 to 13.6 over 605 days.|$|E
5|$|Marking {{the heart}} of the serpent is the constellation's {{brightest}} star, Alpha Serpentis. Traditionally called Unukalhai, is a red giant of spectral type K2III located approximately 23 parsecs distant with a <b>visual</b> <b>magnitude</b> of 2.630 ± 0.009, meaning it can easily be seen with the naked eye even in areas with substantial light pollution. A faint companion is in orbit around the red giant star, although it is not visible to the naked eye. Situated near Alpha is Lambda Serpentis, a magnitude 4.42 ± 0.05 star rather similar to the Sun positioned only 12 parsecs away. Another solar analog in Serpens is the primary of Psi Serpentis, a binary star located slightly further away at approximately 14 parsecs.|$|E
50|$|Gamma Coronae Borealis (γ CrB) {{is a star}} in the {{constellation}} Corona Borealis. A spectroscopic binary system, its components orbit each other every 92.94 years and are roughly as far apart from each other as the Sun and Neptune.

5|$|Lying {{near the}} constellation's {{northern}} border with Telescopium is Alpha Pavonis, {{the brightest star}} in Pavo. Its proper name — Peacock — is an English translation of the constellation's name. It was assigned by the British Her Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office in the late 1930s; the Royal Air Force insisted that all bright stars must have names, the star hitherto having lacked a proper name. Alpha has an apparent (or <b>visual)</b> <b>magnitude</b> of 1.91 and spectral type B2IV. It is a spectroscopic binary system, one estimate placing the distance between the pair of stars as 0.21 astronomical units (AU), or half the distance between Mercury and the Sun. The two stars rotate around each other in a mere 11 days and 18 hours. The star system is located around 180 light years away from Earth.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{stars have}} been found to have planets to date, and four {{planetary}} systems have been discovered with the SuperWASP project. HD 142 is a yellow giant that has an apparent magnitude of 5.7, and has a planet (HD 142 b)1.36 times the mass of Jupiter which orbits every 328 days. HD 2039 is a yellow subgiant with an apparent magnitude of 9.0 around 330 light years away which has a planet (HD 2039 b) triple the mass of Jupiter. WASP-18 is a star of magnitude 9.29 which was discovered to have a hot Jupiter-like planet (WASP-18b) taking less than a day to orbit the star. The planet is suspected to be causing WASP-18 to appear older than it really is. WASP-4 and WASP-5 are solar-type yellow stars around 1000 light years distant and of 13th magnitude, each with a single planet larger than Jupiter. WASP-29 is an orange dwarf of spectral type K4V and <b>visual</b> <b>magnitude</b> 11.3, which has a planetary companion of similar size and mass to Saturn. The planet completes an orbit every 3.9 days.|$|E
5|$|The {{brightest}} star in this constellation is Alpha Lyncis, with an apparent (<b>visual)</b> <b>magnitude</b> of 3.14. It is an orange giant of spectral type K7III located 203 ± 2 light-years distant from Earth. Around twice as massive as the Sun, it has exhausted the hydrogen {{at its core}} and has evolved away from the main sequence. The star has swollen to about 55 times the Sun's radius and is emitting roughly 673 times the luminosity of the Sun. The stellar atmosphere has cooled, giving it a surface temperature of 3,880K., see Table 1. The only star with a proper name is Alsciaukat (from the Arabic for thorn), also known as 31 Lyncis, located 380 ± 10 light-years from Earth. This star is also an evolved giant with around twice the Sun's mass that has swollen and cooled since exhausting its core hydrogen. It is anywhere from 59 to 75 times {{as wide as the}} Sun, and 740 times as luminous. Alsciaukat is also a variable star, ranging in brightness by 0.05 magnitude over 25 to 30 days from its baseline magnitude of 4.25.|$|E
50|$|L2 Puppis has a <b>visual</b> 12th <b>magnitude</b> {{companion}} about {{a minute}} of arc away.|$|R
50|$|IK Tauri varies {{approximately}} every 470 days between extreme <b>visual</b> <b>magnitudes</b> of 10.8 and 16.5. It {{was classified}} as a Mira variable soon after discovery {{on the basis of}} its spectrum showing strong hydrogen emission, and its very large visual amplitude. During each cycle the spectrum of the star also varies, consistently reaching M10 near minimum and only M6-M8 at maximum.|$|R
40|$|The {{absolute}} <b>visual</b> <b>magnitudes</b> of main-sequence Cepheid companions {{are here}} determined from their effective temperatures. The latter are obtained {{by comparing the}} measured relative energy distributions with model atmosphere energy distributions. Assuming an average Galactic extinction law, {{it is found that}} the distance moduli for the Cepheids should be smaller by Delta (mv-Mv) = - 0. 5 as compared to the Sandage-Tammann relation...|$|R
5|$|With a <b>visual</b> <b>magnitude</b> of 17.3, Haumea is the third-brightest {{object in}} the Kuiper belt after Pluto and , and easily {{observable}} with a large amateur telescope. However, because the planets and most small Solar System bodies share a common orbital alignment from their formation in the primordial disk of the Solar System, most early surveys for distant objects focused on the projection on the sky of this common plane, called the ecliptic. As the region of sky close to the ecliptic became well explored, later sky surveys began looking for objects that had been dynamically excited into orbits with higher inclinations, {{as well as more}} distant objects, with slower mean motions across the sky. These surveys eventually covered the location of Haumea, with its high orbital inclination and current position far from the ecliptic.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the more}} {{prominent}} double stars include Gamma Coronae Australis—a pair of yellowish white stars 58 light years away from Earth, which orbit each other every 122 years. Widening since 1990, the two stars {{can be seen as}} separate with a 100mm aperture telescope; they are separated by 1.3 arcseconds at an angle of 61 degrees. They have a combined <b>visual</b> <b>magnitude</b> of 4.2; each component is an F8V dwarf star with a magnitude of 5.01. Epsilon Coronae Australis is an eclipsing binary belonging to a class of stars known as W Ursae Majoris variables. These star systems are known as contact binaries as the component stars are so close together they touch. Varying by a quarter of a magnitude around an average apparent magnitude of 4.83 every seven hours, the star system lies 98 light years away. Its spectral type is F4VFe-0.8+. At {{the southern end of the}} crown asterism are the stars Eta¹ and Eta² Coronae Australis, which form an optical double. Of magnitude 5.1 and 5.5, they are separable with the naked eye and are both white. Kappa Coronae Australis is an easily resolved optical double—the components are of apparent magnitudes 6.3 and 5.7 and are 1700 and 490 light years away respectively. They appear at an angle of 359 degrees, separated by 21.6 arcseconds. Kappa² is actually the brighter of the pair and is more bluish white, with a spectral type of B9V, while Kappa¹ is of spectral type A0III. Lying 202 light years away, Lambda Coronae Australis is a double splittable in small telescopes. The primary is a white star of spectral type A2Vn and magnitude of 5.1, while the companion star has a magnitude of 9.7. The two components are separated by 29.2 arcseconds at an angle of 214 degrees.|$|E
5|$|Zeta Persei is the third-brightest {{star in the}} {{constellation}} at magnitude 2.86. Around 750 light-years from Earth, it is a blue-white supergiant 26–27 times the radius of the Sun and 47,000 times its luminosity. It is the brightest star (as seen from Earth) of a moving group of bright blue-white giant and supergiant stars, the Perseus OB2 Association or Zeta Persei Association. Zeta is a triple star system, with a companion blue-white main sequence star of spectral type B8 and apparent magnitude 9.16 around 3900 AU distant from the primary, and a white main sequence star of magnitude 9.90 and spectral type A2, some 50,000 AU away, {{that may or may}} not be gravitationally bound to the other two. X Persei is a double system in this association; one component is a hot, bright star and the other is a neutron star. With an apparent magnitude of 6.72, it is too dim to be seen with the naked eye even in perfectly dark conditions. The system is an X-ray source and the primary star appears to be undergoing substantial mass loss. Once thought to be a member of the Perseus OB2 Association, Omicron Persei is a multiple star system with a combined <b>visual</b> <b>magnitude</b> of 3.85. It is composed of two blue-white starsa giant of spectral class B1.5 and main sequence star of B3which orbit each other every 4.5 days and are distorted into ovoids due to their small separation. The system has a third star about which little is known. At an estimated distance of 1475 light-years from Earth, the system is now thought to lie too far from the center of the Zeta Persei group to belong to it.|$|E
5000|$|Since the 19th century, Rigel B {{has been}} {{reported}} to be resolved into a close binary of two equal components, with the measured separation varying from less than 0.1" [...] to nearly 0.2". Speckle interferometry showed in 2009 two almost identical components separated by 0.124".

40|$|The {{observational}} techniques {{employed to}} search for gravitational lensing effects in highly luminous quasars (HLQs) are given, along with results of the observations. The program, begun in 1986, considers the visible and dark matter distributions at different scales in the universe to determine which extragalactic objects are gravitationally lensed. The Hubble parameter and galaxy masses are determined from the observations, and observations of microlensing effects provide data on HLQ size and structures. The redshifts {{are found to be}} between 1 and 3. 6, with apparent <b>visual</b> <b>magnitudes</b> 16 - 18. 5 and absolute <b>visual</b> <b>magnitudes</b> between - 29 and - 30. 6. About one quarter of the images exhibit either multiple components, elongated structures, jetlike features, or faint nearby galaxies. The double quasar UM 673 and its 'overlying' lens galaxy is given as a prime example of an HLQ that is gravitationally lensed. It is theorized many more HLQs are gravitationally lensed, and specific future observations are recommended...|$|R
