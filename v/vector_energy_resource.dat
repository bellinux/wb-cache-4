40|$|Proposes a {{completely}} new approach {{to the analysis of}} energy systems Assesses energy technologies, markets and strategies on their capacity to produce, exchange and use <b>energy</b> <b>vectors</b> Written by experts in energy systems What lies beyond the era of fossil fuels? While most answers focus on different primary <b>energy</b> <b>resources,</b> <b>Energy</b> Systems in the Era of <b>Energy</b> <b>Vectors</b> provides {{a completely}} new approach. Instead of providing a traditional consumption analysis of classical primary <b>energy</b> <b>resources</b> such as oil, coal, nuclear power and gas, Energy Systems in the Era of <b>Energy</b> <b>Vectors</b> describes and assesses energy technologies, markets and future strategies, focusing on their capacity to produce, exchange, and use <b>energy</b> <b>vectors.</b> Special attention is given to the renewable <b>energy</b> <b>resources</b> available in different areas of the world and made exploitable by the integration of <b>energy</b> <b>vectors</b> in the global energy system. Clear definitions of <b>energy</b> <b>vectors</b> and <b>energy</b> systems are used as the basis for a complete explanation and assessment of up-to-date, available technologies for <b>energy</b> <b>resources,</b> transport and storage systems, conversion and use. The <b>energy</b> <b>vectors</b> scheme allows the potential realisation of a worldwide sustainable energy system to fulfil global development expectations by minimising both the impact on the environment, and the international political frictions for access to limited and concentrated <b>resources.</b> <b>Energy</b> Systems in the Era of <b>Energy</b> <b>Vectors</b> is an informative read for researchers and advanced students in industrial, energy and environmental engineering. It also contains valuable information for managers and technicians working in the energy sector...|$|R

40|$|The {{realisation}} {{of energy}} systems {{that do not}} consume resources and do not produce waste is the new challenge of energy research. This kind of energy systems are {{to be based on}} what we call Closed cycles of <b>energy</b> <b>resources.</b> The realisation of Closed cycles of resources can be achieved in the energy sector by exploiting renewable resources and structurally integrating <b>energy</b> <b>vectors</b> in the <b>energy</b> system. So the inclusion of <b>energy</b> <b>vectors</b> (to be produced from several primary <b>resources)</b> in the <b>energy</b> system chain becomes a key concept of the entire human development model. In this new scenario, the opportunity of using hydrogen shows all its interest. Hydrogen, electricity and other <b>energy</b> <b>vectors,</b> in a large scale application, allow to fully satisfy all the final uses of energy that the human society needs for its social and economical development. <b>Energy</b> <b>vectors</b> like electricity, heat exchanging fluids, and "producible" fuels-as hydrogen-are the key for entering a new energy era.

Through analyzing the dynamics behavior of this model, {{the relationship between}} the capital investment in <b>energy</b> <b>resource</b> system and the <b>energy</b> <b>resource</b> supply in China has been investigated. The model reveals that there are certain boundaries which restrict the capital investment in energy system, namely, too high investment will lead <b>energy</b> <b>resource</b> supply to increase dramatically, too low investment will cause <b>energy</b> <b>resource</b> supply shrink. In order to keep the energy system of China away from chaos, corresponding countermeasures for <b>energy</b> <b>resource</b> development are also put forward in this paper...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{development}} of efficient thermal prime movers for distributed generation {{is changing the}} focus of the production of electricity from large centralized power plants to local generation units scattered over the territory. The scientific community is addressing the analysis and planning of distributed <b>energy</b> <b>resources</b> with widespread approaches, taking into account technical, environmental, economic and social issues. The coupling of cogeneration systems to absorption/electric chillers or heat pumps, as well as the interactions with renewable sources, allow for setting up multi-generation systems for combined local production of different <b>energy</b> <b>vectors</b> such as electricity, heat (at different enthalpy levels), cooling power, hydrogen, various chemical substances, and so forth. Adoption of composite multi-generation systems may lead to significant benefits in terms of higher energy efficiency, reduced CO 2 emissions, and enhanced economy. In this light, a key direction for improving the characteristics of the local energy production concerns the integration of the concepts of distributed <b>energy</b> <b>resources</b> and combined production of different <b>energy</b> <b>vectors</b> into a comprehensive distributed multi-generation (DMG) framework that entails various approaches to energy planning currently available in the literature. This paper outlines the main aspects of the DMG framework, illustrating its characteristics and summarizing the relevant DMG structures.

40|$|Renewable <b>energy</b> <b>resources</b> {{are widely}} being {{utilised}} in remote area power supply (RAPS) systems. The capacity value of renewable <b>energy</b> <b>resources</b> in a RAPS system indicates {{the ability of}} renewable <b>energy</b> <b>resources</b> to serve the load demand in the RAPS systems. In this paper, the impact of capacity value of renewable <b>resources</b> on <b>energy</b> management of a RAPS system, while maintaining system reliability, is investigated. It is revealed that capacity value of renewable <b>energy</b> <b>resources</b> has direct influence on RAPS system energy management. By utilising storage in conjunction with renewable <b>energy</b> <b>resources,</b> the RAPS system can cater load demand while achieving a higher reliability. A case study based on a remote village has shown that {{with the presence of}} a renewable <b>energy</b> <b>resource</b> with high capacity value can meet the load demand with a relatively small storage system for energy balance while maintaining the level of reliability target. Therefore, it is imperative to consider capacity value of renewable <b>energy</b> <b>resources</b> to design a highly reliable RAPS system...|$|R
