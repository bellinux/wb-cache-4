5|$|Following the {{establishment}} of the Film and <b>Videotape</b> <b>Library,</b> an audit of the Engineering Department found 60 of the 128 Third Doctor episodes starring Jon Pertwee, which in addition to the Film Library's copies of the film-originated Spearhead from Space, brought that Doctor's episode count up to 64 out of 128.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} junking process was halted and the BBC {{established}} its Film and <b>Videotape</b> <b>Library</b> {{for the purpose}} of storage and preservation, archive selector Sue Malden began to audit what material remained in the BBC's stores. When investigations revealed large gaps in the collection, Malden turned her inquiries to the National Film and Television Archive – which promptly returned three full Second Doctor serials– The Dominators, The Krotons, and The War Games, adding seven more episodes and completing two of those serials. These all were standard 16mm film telerecordings with the exception of The Dominators Episode 3, which was a 35mm print.|$|E
5|$|The BBC Film Library {{was turned}} into a {{combined}} Film & <b>Videotape</b> <b>Library</b> for the preservation of both media. The Film Library at the time held only 47 episodes of 1960s Doctor Who; they had once held 53, but six episodes had either been junked or gone missing. Junkings at BBC Enterprises, however, continued until the intervention of Ian Levine, a record producer and fan of the programme. Following the transfer of episodes still held by Enterprises, there were 152 episodes of Doctor Who no longer held by the BBC, although subsequent efforts have reduced that number to 97.|$|E
5|$|Levine {{alerted the}} new Film and <b>Videotape</b> <b>Library's</b> archive selector, Sue Malden, who paid her own visit to Villiers House and found every {{remaining}} Jon Pertwee episode (albeit as a 16mm black-and-white telerecording), {{except for two}} from his final season: Death to the Daleks and Invasion of the Dinosaurs, Episodes 1.|$|R
50|$|The archive {{collection}} include 1.74 million {{photographs and}} negatives, 20,000 illustrations, 44,000 maps, 124,000 films and 4,000 <b>videotapes.</b> The <b>library</b> holds collections on history, library science and law with 43,000 volumes, 900 newspapers and 6,300 rare works.|$|R
50|$|Holdings in the South Georgia State College William S. Smith Library exceed 100,000 items, {{including}} reference books, bound periodicals, government documents, pamphlets, {{maps and}} <b>videotapes.</b> The <b>library</b> subscribes to 327 journals and ten newspapers. Back issues {{are available in}} a variety of formats: CD-ROM, paper, microfiche and microfilm. GALILEO (Georgia Library Learning Online, a statewide initiative) links SGSC's library with others in Georgia to offer more than 100 generalized and specialized research databases. The reference area also offers CD-ROM based indexes to general periodicals and newspapers. Computer workstations offer access to the Internet through the campus network. Word-processing software is also available.|$|R
500|$|When the BBC's {{complete}} holdings (both the BBC Film & <b>Videotape</b> <b>Library</b> and BBC Enterprises) {{were first}} audited in 1978, the following 50 episodes were absent from their collective archives, but have subsequently {{been returned to}} the Corporation through various methods. The nine stories [...] have all episodes existing as a result. Except where indicated, all episodes were returned as 16mm telerecording negatives or prints.|$|E
2500|$|All of CNN's TV {{networks}} {{remained on}} the air, but there was damage to the glass roof of the CNN Center atrium, flooding part of the food court. [...] Additionally, blown-out windows in the ground floor CNN.com newsroom and the fourth floor <b>videotape</b> <b>library</b> caused minor damage. [...] Live {{news coverage of the}} aftermath was carried on CNN International, in turn simulcast domestically on CNN until 1 am EDT. CNN resumed broadcasting from their main newsroom at 6 am EDT, showing several parts of the newsroom with computer stations covered with tarps, the damaged atrium of CNN Center, and staff using trash cans and buckets to collect dripping rainwater {{to the right of the}} anchor desk due to the damaged roof. When more storms moved in later in the day, the network was forced to move all Atlanta on-camera operations to the windowless CNN-I studio, while taped programming was shown for most of the day.|$|E
50|$|In 1985, a 15-hour {{compilation}} of Nagrin's work, The Nagrin <b>Videotape</b> <b>Library</b> of Dances, was assembled. It {{is held in}} the Dance Collection at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts.|$|E
40|$|The Post-punk music {{movement}} of the late 1970 s and early 80 s, was, in various ways, hugely inspired by writers of Gothic (Machen, Poe) and Post-Gothic (Lovecraft to Ballard and Burroughs). The Industrial Culture Handbook (1983) provides copious lists of band members’ book and <b>videotape</b> <b>libraries,</b> which evidence a plethora of gothic preoccupations. These interests manifested also in various video productions and even dabblings with so-called ‘television magick’. Post-punk gothic explored the intensive and affective potentials of contemporary electronic media and my paper will argue that its manifestations constituted forays into what Deleuze and Guattari conceptualize as subversive ‘minoritarian’ culture. Further, I contend that this movement fed into what has been dubbed the ‘turn to the extreme’ in 21 st century popular culture. Televisuality, in its broadest sense, has fostered a viral spread of images of extremity and limit experience, connecting us up constantly with boundary- collapsing gothic impulses. However, in a recuperative twist, these impulses have been exploited and commodified. Moreover, as Fred Botting points out, gothic extremities, ‘though celebrated for their subcultural and subversive status, for their fantastic disclosure of another, “realer” if darker reality, are inextricably entangled in webs of simulation’. This paper suggests that {{an evaluation of the}} post-punk/industrial movement’s experimentation in the gothic mode is still capable of intimating ‘lines of flight’ in the contemporary mediascape, towards new, untimely forms of resistance and community and the de-railment of the work of the simulation industries...|$|R
50|$|At the time, {{additional}} concerns {{centered on}} the transmission of such material via <b>videotape</b> at public <b>libraries.</b> For example, author Jerome Miller writes that this case's decision was not popular amongst librarian professionals. He found {{that the results of}} the case forced librarians to make difficult choices. They could either terminate in-house showings or buy a license from groups such as the Motion Picture Licensing Corp. This offered new procedures for showing films within instructional settings.|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} ANIM 3 D, a 3 D animation library {{targeted at}} visualizing combinatorial structures. In particular, {{we are interested}} in algorithm animation. Constructing a new view for an algorithm typically takes dozens of design iterations, and can be very time-consuming. Our library eases the programmer's burden by providing high-level constructs for performing animations, and by offering an interpretive environment that eliminates the need for recompilations. This report also illustrates ANIM 3 D's expressiveness by developing a 3 D animation of Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm in just 70 lines of code. An accompanying <b>videotape</b> shows the <b>library</b> in use. 1 Background Algorithm animation is concerned with visualizing the internal operations of a running program {{in such a way that}} the user gains some understanding of the workings of the algorithm. Due to lack of adequate hardware, early algorithm animation systems were restricted to black-and-white animations at low frame rates [...] ...|$|R

Furthermore, this association offers the NADL Pillar Scholarship aimed to provide qualified dental technicians the opportunity to take the necessary examinations to complete the Certified Dental Technician examination process.|$|E
50|$|Episodes 1, 3, and 4 were {{reported}} {{missing from the}} BBC Film and <b>Videotape</b> <b>Library</b> following an audit in 1978 (see Doctor Who missing episodes). Edited telerecordings of all four episodes were returned to the BBC from Nigeria in 1985, and complete copies of episodes 1 and 3 were returned in 1992. A short sequence from episode 4, depicting an act of violence, remains missing from the otherwise complete prints of all four episodes, as it was removed by censors. The 2008 Region 2 DVD release includes as an extra, called The Missing 12 Seconds, the audio for this missing sequence with original script excerpts and explanatory text - {{it appears that the}} two Vikings were seen on screen to be run through by the sword-wielding Saxons via the use of dummies.|$|E
50|$|Until 1978, {{when the}} BBC Film and <b>Videotape</b> <b>Library</b> was {{created as a}} {{permanent}} archive for all its programmes, the BBC had no central archive. The videotapes and film recordings stored in the BBC's various libraries were often either wiped to allow recording of newer programmes without increasing costs, or destroyed to free storage space. The BBC Film Library kept only some programmes that were made on film, whilst the Engineering Department handled videotape but had no mandate to retain material. Some shows were kept by BBC Enterprises, but they too had limited storage space and only kept material that was considered commercially exploitable. In the mid-1970s, BBC Enterprises disposed of much older material for which the rights to sell the programmes had expired, and the Engineering Department routinely wiped videotapes that were no longer formally required.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the outset}} of WCW's existence, {{as well as that}} of its predecessors, the company was {{strongly}} identified with the Southern style of professional wrestling (i.e., [...] "rasslin'"), which emphasized athletic and competitive in-ring performances over the showmanship and cartoon-like characterizations of the WWF. This identity persisted into the 1990s, even as the company signed stars who their audience had only ever known as WWF-only stars (e.g., Hulk Hogan, Randy Savage). WCW dominated pro wrestling's television ratings from mid-1996 to 1998 in the U.S. (i.e., for 84 straight weeks) mainly due to its incredibly popular New World Order storyline; but thereafter, began to lose heavy ground to the WWF, which had successfully rebounded from the WCW threat with its edgy, antihero-driven [...] "Attitude" [...] era that saw the rise of WWF superstars such as Stone Cold Steve Austin. Stale story lines; unimpressive pay-per-view main event performances; a policy of vastly overpaying all headliners - and even many middle-tier performers - exorbitant, guaranteed salaries; questionable booking decisions; plus eventual and sudden spending restrictions (imposed by corporate parent Time Warner), combined to eventually lead WCW to start operating at a quickly-ballooning loss, instead of a profit. As a result, AOL Time Warner sold the copyrights to WCW's name to the WWF for $2.5 million, in 2001. Shortly after the purchase, Vince McMahon purchased the entire WCW <b>videotape</b> <b>library</b> for an additional $1.7 million, bringing the final tally of World Championship Wrestling's sale to $4.2 million.|$|E
40|$|In 1995, the {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} was 10 years old. Since its invention by Kary Mullis, {{it has become the}} bedrock of DNA research, gene discovery, diagnostics development, forensic investigation and environmental science. To mark the anniversary, a conference sponsored by the Perkin-Elmer Corporation was held at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in September 1994. Outstanding scientists from a variety of fields reviewed the impact of the technique on their specialties, discussing the present and future applications of PCR technology. Their talks have been captured in this unique <b>videotape</b> <b>library,</b> which will appeal to scientists who apply PCR to problems in human, animal and plant genetics, cell biology, diagnostics, forensic science and molecular evolution.
