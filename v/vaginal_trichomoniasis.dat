40|$|Objective: There are no universally {{successful}} {{guidelines for}} the treatment of metronidazole-resistant <b>vaginal</b> <b>trichomoniasis.</b> This is distressing for patients and frustrating for physicians. We therefore decided to evaluate whether zinc sulfate douche is effective in treating <b>vaginal</b> <b>trichomoniasis,</b> because the compound is a natural antimicrobial chemical defense in humans. Case reports: In our retrospective case review, eight cases of metronidazole-resistant trichomoniasis were treated with 1 % zinc sulfate douche with or without tinidazole between 2005 and 2012. Except for one patient who was pregnant, seven patients were successfully treated and were negative for microscopic findings with no clinical symptoms at follow up. Conclusion: Although the exact role of zinc sulfate in metronidazole-resistant trichomoniasis is not clear, our patients experienced a therapeutic effect with zinc sulfate douche treatment. We therefore recommend zinc sulfate douche as an option {{for the treatment of}} metronidazole-resistant <b>vaginal</b> <b>trichomoniasis...</b>|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY Squamous {{papillae}} in {{the vestibule}} are common. They were once considered to be nor-mal variants of female anatomy, but reports of the viral aetiology of such lesions are emerging. When they are symptomatic, squamous papillae can lead to problems in sexual relationships between healthy partners. Here we report a case that responded well to treatment. Benign lesions in the lower genital tract, which were once considered as normal, are now known {{to relate to the}} wide range of disease caused by human papil-loma virus (HPV). Despite strong circumstantial evidence suggesting an association between HPV and lower genital tract neoplasia, final proof that HPV is the causative agent of cervical cancer still remains to be established. It is important {{to be aware of the}} various clinical manifestations and take adequate steps to screen the patients. Case report A nulliparous woman aged 29 presented with a two year history of roughness around the vulval skin. She had noticed occasional itching in the vulva and superficial dyspareunia, and an occasional non-offensive brownish discharge mainly after menstru-ation. She had regular sexual intercourse with her fiance, who was her only sexual contact during the previous five years. She was in good health until this episode, which caused her great anxiety as she was due to be married four weeks later. Examination showed a pearly white papillomatous area in the introitus, on the inside of labia minora (fig 1). The extent of the lesions was well defined on hand lens examination. There was minimal clear mucoid discharge. The rest of the external genitalia, vagina, and cervix showed no abnormality. A wet film, Gram stained smears, culture, and serology gave negative results for gonorrhoea, chlamydial infection, anaero-bic <b>vaginal</b> infections, <b>trichomoniasis,</b> candidiasis, and syphilis.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} the seroprevalence of {{herpes simplex virus}} type 2 (HSV- 2) in two urban communities in Delhi and to correlate the presence of HSV- 2 seroprevalence with sociodemographic profile, risk factors and presence of other reproductive tract infections (RTIs). Methods: Men and women aged between 15 - 49 years from an urban slum and an urban middle class colony {{were invited to participate}} in the study. They provided interview information; blood for HSV- 2, HIV and syphilis serology; first void urine specimens for diagnosis of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis infection; and genital specimens for diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, <b>vaginal</b> candidiasis and <b>trichomoniasis.</b> Results: The prevalence of HSV- 2 seropositivity was found to be 7 and 8. 6 &#x 0025; in men and women, respectively. HSV- 2 seropositivity was found to be significantly associated with urban middle class community and older age. No statistically significant correlation was found between HSV- 2 seropositivity and other laboratory-confirmed RTIs.

40|$|INTRODUCTION. Most {{efforts at}} sexually {{transmitted}} disease (STD) protection center on condom use, but {{little is known about}} how condoms compare with other barrier methods, particularly those controlled by women. METHODS. To evaluate the effect of different barrier contraceptives on the prevalence of STDs and other vaginal infections, we retrospectively studied 5681 visits by women to an urban STD clinic. RESULTS. As compared with women using no contraceptive or with tubal ligations, women using the contraceptive sponge or diaphragm had at least 65 % lower rates of infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Trichomonas vaginalis, while condom users had 34 % and 30 % lower rates, respectively. For Chlamydia trachomatis, the reduction was 13 % among sponge users, 72 % among diaphragm users, and 3 % among condom users, although these differences were not significant. When compared with women using condoms, women using female-dependent methods (sponge or diaphragm) had significantly lower rates of both gonorrhea and <b>trichomoniasis.</b> <b>Vaginal</b> candidiasis was more common among women using diaphragms but not other barrier methods, while rates of bacterial vaginosis were similar among all groups. CONCLUSIONS. Women using the contraceptive sponge or diaphragm experience protection from STDs {{to a greater extent than}} those relying on condoms.

40|$|Background: Reproductive tract infections (RTIs) is {{a global}} health problem {{including}} both sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and non-sexually transmitted infections (non-STIs) of the reproductive tract. The risk of RTIs in pregnant women includes post abortal and puerperal sepsis to fetal and perinatal deaths. Hence a community study was done in Hubli, in terms of active search of the cases among pregnant women with feasible laboratory tests for RTI and thereby providing treatment, counseling and follow-up. Objectives: 1. To know the prevalence of RTIs using feasible laboratory tests among reproductive age group, pregnant women. 2. To find the socio-demographic factors influencing RTIs in pregnant women. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was done using a simple random sampling technique to select households. A pre-tested structured proforma was used {{to collect data on}} socio-demographic and reproductive characteristics. Specimens were collected for laboratory analyses of Gonorrhea, <b>Trichomoniasis,</b> <b>Vaginal</b> Candidiasis (VC), Bacterial vaginosis (BV) and Syphilis in Urban Health Training Centre (UHTC), attached to Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS), Hubli. Results: In all 51. 3 % of the women were diagnosed as having an RTI, including 8. 9 % with sexually transmitted infections. Endogenous infections were most prevalent (VC 35. 9 %, BV 6. 4 %), followed by Syphilis 5. 1 %, Trichomoniasis 3. 8 % and Gonorrhea 0 %. Conclusion: In this study, the prevalence of RTI among pregnant women is high and steps should be taken for appropriate management of these cases, to reduce further risk of transmission of HIV/AIDS. This study suggests for integrating RTI/STI services into primary health care in order to know the true prevalence of RTI/STI in the community. The study also highlights the need for the introduction and/or strengthening of facilities for simple diagnostic tests for RTIs/STIs, especially at the peripheral healthcare level...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Women {{requesting}} abortion are {{at increased}} risk of developing RTI complications. However, RTI control in many resource-poor countries including Vietnam have been faced with logistical and methodological problems due to lack of standardized definitions of RTIs, lack of well-validated diagnostic criteria, lack of accurate laboratory tests, and lack of diagnostic equipment and skills. This article investigates the prevalence of RTIs among Vietnamese abortion-seeking women, to evaluate the available diagnostic techniques, and to assess antibiotic resistance among aetiological agents of RTI. Method The study was conducted in Phu-San hospital (PSH) from December 2003 through April 2004 among 748 abortion clients. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data on socio-economic and reproductive characteristics. Specimens were collected for laboratory analyses of chlamydia, gonorrhoea, <b>trichomoniasis,</b> <b>vaginal</b> candidiasis (VC), bacterial vaginosis (BV) and syphilis. To assess the validity of the obtained results, the study was repeated among 100 women and the duplicate samples were analysed at PSH and Copenhagen University Hospital (CUH). Results In all 54 % of the women were diagnosed as having an RTI, including 3. 3 % with sexually transmitted infections. Endogenous infections were most prevalent (VC 34 % and BV 12 %) followed by chlamydia (1. 3 %) and trichomoniasis (0. 7 %). The sensitivity of culture for VC and BV was 30 % and 88 %, respectively, when tests in PSH were measured against tests in CUH. Antibiotic resistance was common among bacterial isolates. Conclusion RTIs are common among women seeking abortion. The presence of RTIs is associated with an increased risk of developing iatrogenic infections, routine administration of prophylactic antibiotic to all women undergoing abortion should be considered. However, the choice of routine prophylactic antibiotics should be based on relevant surveillance data of antibiotic resistance. Moreover, since the accuracy of diagnosis is doubtful and {{to address the problem of}} under-diagnosed and treated RTIs new investment in diagnostic facilities with simple performed microscopy or improved rapid tests should also be taken into consideration. </p...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} the possible involvement of human trichomonads (Pentatrichomonas hominis and Trichomonas tenax) other than Trichomonas vaginalis in the aetiology of <b>vaginal</b> <b>trichomoniasis.</b> METHODS: Vaginal swabs taken from women attending antenatal clinics were tested for Trichomonas vaginalis by traditional assays (wet-mount microscopy and InPouch culture) and nucleic acid amplification (polymerase chain reaction). These swabs were also {{tested for the}} presence of P hominis and T tenax by nucleic acid amplification. Oral and rectal swabs from these women were tested for T tenax and P hominis respectively. Data on sociodemographic characteristics, sexual and anogenital hygiene practices likely to seed P hominis and T tenax into the vagina were collected by a questionnaire. RESULTS: 93 % (161) of the 173 samples in which T vaginalis was detected by wet preparation or culture was evaluable by PCR. Of this, T vaginalis was detected in 94 % (152) by T vaginalis-specific PCR. Neither P hominis nor T tenax was detected in any of the vaginal swab samples. These included nine samples for which T vaginalis had been detected by wet preparation or culture, but were negative by T vaginalis nucleic acid amplification. P hominis and T tenax were not detected in any of the rectal and oral swabs, respectively. CONCLUSION: In this group of women, there was no evidence for the involvement of trichomonads other than T vaginalis in the aetiology of <b>vaginal</b> <b>trichomoniasis...</b>|$|E

The causes of treatment failure in trichomoniasis are discussed and the desirability of relating dosage to the patient's body-weight is suggested. This factor may be especially important in deciding the dosage given on epidemiological grounds to the male consorts.

40|$|Treatment of {{patients}} with metronidazole-refractory <b>vaginal</b> <b>trichomoniasis</b> constitutes a major therapeutic challenge, and treatment options are extremely limited. Although the majority {{of patients}} infected with trich-omonads, who demonstrate reduced in vitro susceptibility to metronidazole, respond to high-dose but poorly tolerated regimens of metronidazole, clinical failure {{is by no means}} uncommon. We report a cure rate of 22 (92 %) of 24 patients with refractory trichomoniasis treated with high doses of oral and vaginal tinidazole.

Tinidazole, despite the high doses used, was extremely well tolerated, with few side effects. Topical paromomycin was effective in 7 (58 %) of 12 patients treated, but frequent local vulvovaginal adverse reactions precluded extensive use. Widespread reports of metronidazole resistance and limited treatment options emphasize the need for additional trichomonacidal agents.

40|$|Background: In {{the last}} two decades the {{incidence}} of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are dramatically increased and remain a major public health problem in developing countries. Trichomoniasis is the most common non-viral sexually transmitted infection caused by Trichomonas vaginalis which is a flagellated protozoon associated with vaginitis, cervicitis and urethritis. Researchers believed that pregnancy is one of the influencing factors of the genital trichomoniasis in women. Objectives: The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the prevalence of trichomoniasis in pregnant women in Zanjan, Iran. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 1000 pregnant women were examined for diagnosis of trichomoniasis based on direct microscopic examination and culture method. They referred to the treatment and health centers of Zanjan, Northwest Iran, Demographic and personal information of the subjects were collected and evaluated with questionnaires.

40|$|Background: Bacterial vaginosis {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{infection}} disorders affecting women. Several types of antibiotics have been used to treat this condition, although metronidazole was found to be the most effective one, none was completely successful in either cure or prevention. The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of oral clindamycin and oral metronidazole in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. Material and methods : Sixty women aged 16 years or older in whom bacterial vaginosis was diagnosed by standard criteria such as Amsel's and gram's stain criteria were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind study to receive either oral clindamycin (300 mg twice daily for 7 days) or oral metronidazole (500 mg twice daily for 7 days). Women with coexisting vulvovaginal candidiasis or <b>vaginal</b> <b>trichomoniasis</b> were excluded. Tests were repeated at 7 th and 14 th day following the therapy. Vaginal symptoms, complications, and drug side effects were all recorded. Result : We have not found any statistically significant difference in cure rates for oral clindamycin (93. 3) and oral metronidazole (86. 6). Adverse reactions were mild in both groups. Four patients who have received clindamycin developed non-bloody diarrhea and 4 patients who were given metronidazole developed symptomatic candida vaginosis. Conclusion : Clindamycin may be a safe and effective alternative to metronidazole to treat women with bacterial vaginosis...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} the prevalence of cervicovaginal infections in normal third-trimester pregnant women and evaluate the accuracy of clinical diagnosis. Method: A total of 328 pregnant women were followed at the Prenatal Outpatient Clinic of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the School of Medical Sciences, Universidade Estadual de Campinas (UNICAMP), Brazil, from October 1991 to February 1993. The clinical diagnosis was based on the characteristics of the vaginal discharge, and the etiological diagnosis was based on bacterioscopy of the vaginal secretion and direct immunofluorescence for Chlamydia trachomatis. The data were analyzed statistically, determining the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value of the clinical diagnosis related to the laboratory diagnosis of the different infections. Results: The prevalence of infection was 39. 6 % (Candida albicans, 19. 2 %; bacterial vaginosis, 9. 5 %; intermediate vaginal flora, 6. 7 %; Chlamydia trachomatis, 2. 1 %; and <b>vaginal</b> <b>trichomoniasis,</b> 2. 1 %). The accuracy of clinical diagnosis was low, with sensitivity between 50 % and 65 % and specificity around 60 %, with the exception of trichomoniasis, which showed a sensitivity of 100 % and chlamydia, with a sensitivity of 0 % and a specificity of 100 %. Conclusion: The accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of infections was low, specifically with respect to the positive predictive value. The results demonstrate the need for specific testing of cervicovaginal infections at prenatal visits. Reliance on simple vaginal examination results in a low yield for detection of vaginal infections. Infect. Dis. Obstet. Gynecol. 6 : 129 - 133, 1998...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{present study}} aimed to {{determine}} the prevalence and associated risk factors of <b>vaginal</b> <b>trichomoniasis</b> in women referred to gynecologic clinic in Benha University Hospital, Egypt. Methods: Two hundred female patients enrolled in the study. Vaginal samples were obtained from them and examined for T. vaginalis by wet mount, Giemsa stain, Acridine orange (AO) stain and culture on modified Diamond’s medium. For analysis of accuracy of the methods used, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve concept with culture as a gold standard was applied. Results: Out of 200 patients, T. vaginalis was found in 22 (11 %) patients {{by any of the}} diagnostic methods used. The accuracy of AO staining comes next to Dia­mond’s culture (AUC 0. 909, sensitivity 81. 8 %, specificity 100 %, CI 0. 81 - 1. 0) fol­lowed by Giemsa staining (AUC 0. 835, sensitivity 68. 2 %, specificity 98. 9 %, CI 0. 72 - 0. 95). The wet mount was the least accurate method (AUC 0. 795, sensitivity 59. 1 %, specificity 100 %, CI 0. 67 - 0. 92). There was no significant association be­tween potentially supposed risk factors and trichomoniasis except patients complain­ing of either dysuria and dyspareunia or back pain and abdominal pain. Conclusion: Trichomoniasis is a common disease in our community. Sociodemo­graphic factors do not seem to affect the prevalence among different Egyptian population. For accurate diagnosis, laboratory investigation is essential. A positive wet smear is diagnostic, but negative samples should be examined by methods that are more sensitive. </p...|$|E
