5|$|Diamonds {{containing}} boron as a substitutional impurity are termed type IIb. Only {{one percent}} of natural diamonds are of this type, and most are blue to grey. Boron is an acceptor in diamond: boron atoms have one less available electron than the carbon atoms; therefore, each boron atom substituting for a carbon atom creates an electron hole in the band gap that can accept an electron from the <b>valence</b> <b>band.</b> This allows red light absorption, and due to the small energy (0.37 eV) needed for the electron to leave the <b>valence</b> <b>band,</b> holes can be thermally released from the boron atoms to the <b>valence</b> <b>band</b> even at room temperatures. These holes can move in an electric field and render the diamond electrically conductive (i.e., a p-type semiconductor). Very few boron atoms are required for this to happen—a typical ratio is one boron atom per 1,000,000 carbon atoms.|$|E
5|$|The thermal {{conductivity}} of heliumII {{is greater than}} that of any other known substance, a million times that of heliumI and several hundred times that of copper. This is because heat conduction occurs by an exceptional quantum mechanism. Most materials that conduct heat well have a <b>valence</b> <b>band</b> of free electrons which serve to transfer the heat. HeliumII has no such <b>valence</b> <b>band</b> but nevertheless conducts heat well. The flow of heat is governed by equations that are similar to the wave equation used to characterize sound propagation in air. When heat is introduced, it moves at 20 meters per second at 1.8K through heliumII as waves in a phenomenon known as second sound.|$|E
5|$|The vacancy behaves as a deep {{electron}} donor/acceptor, whose electronic properties {{depend on}} the charge state. The energy level for the +/0 states is at 0.6 eV and for the 0/- states is at 2.5 eV above the <b>valence</b> <b>band.</b>|$|E

At the Г-point {{in the band}} structure, [...] and [...] orbitals form <b>valence</b> <b>bands.</b> But spin-orbit coupling splits sixfold degeneracy into high energy 4-fold and lower energy 2-fold bands. Again 4-fold degeneracy is lifted into heavy- and light hole bands by phenomenological Hamiltonian by J. M. Luttinger.|$|R

5|$|Other {{specialized}} applications {{also exist}} or are being developed, including use as semiconductors: some blue diamonds are natural semiconductors, {{in contrast to}} most diamonds, which are excellent electrical insulators. The conductivity and blue color originate from boron impurity. Boron substitutes for carbon atoms in the diamond lattice, donating a hole into the <b>valence</b> <b>band.</b>|$|E
5|$|All {{elements}} {{in this group}} are metals. The similarity of the metallic radii of cadmium and mercury is an effect of the lanthanide contraction. So, the trend in this group is unlike the trend in group 2, the alkaline earths, where metallic radius increases smoothly {{from top to bottom}} of the group. All three metals have relatively low melting and boiling points, indicating that the metallic bond is relatively weak, with relatively little overlap between the <b>valence</b> <b>band</b> and the conduction band. Thus, zinc is close to the boundary between metallic and metalloid elements, which is usually placed between gallium and germanium, though gallium participates in semi-conductors such as gallium arsenide.|$|E

25|$|In {{a regular}} {{semiconductor}} crystal, the band gap is fixed owing to continuous energy states. In a quantum dot crystal, the band gap is size dependent {{and can be}} altered to produce a range of energies between the <b>valence</b> <b>band</b> and conduction band. It {{is also known as}} quantum confinement effect.|$|E
25|$|The {{nature of}} the SEM's probe, {{energetic}} electrons, makes it uniquely suited to examining the optical and electronic properties of semiconductor materials. The high-energy electrons from the SEM beam will inject charge carriers into the semiconductor. Thus, beam electrons lose energy by promoting electrons from the <b>valence</b> <b>band</b> into the conduction band, leaving behind holes.|$|E
25|$|At {{standard}} temperature and pressure, silicon is a shiny semiconductor with a bluish-grey metallic lustre; as typical for semiconductors, its resistivity drops with temperature. This arises because silicon {{has a small}} energy gap between its highest occupied energy levels (the <b>valence</b> <b>band)</b> and the lowest unoccupied ones (the conduction band). The Fermi level is about halfway between these and is the energy at which a state is {{as likely to be}} occupied by an electron as not. Hence pure silicon is an insulator at room temperature. However, doping silicon with a pnictogen such as phosphorus, arsenic, or antimony introduces one extra electron per dopant and these may then be excited into the conduction band either thermally or photolytically, creating an n-type semiconductor. Similarly, doping silicon with a group 13 element such as boron, aluminium, and gallium results in the introduction of acceptor levels that trap electrons that may be excited from the filled <b>valence</b> <b>band,</b> creating a p-type semiconductor. Joining n-type silicon to p-type silicon creates a p-n junction with a common Fermi level; electrons flow from n to p, while holes flow from p to n, creating a voltage drop. This p-n junction thus acts as a diode that can rectify alternating curent that allows current to pass more easily one way than the other. A transistor is an n-p-n junction, with a thin layer of weakly p-type silicon between two n-type regions. Biasing the emitter through a small forward voltage and the collector through a large reverse voltage allows the transistor to act as a triode amplifier.|$|E
40|$|Spectroscopic {{ellipsometry}} is used {{to measure}} the dielectric function of heavily doped p-type GaAs for wave numbers from 100 to 2000 cm- 1. Due to partial filling of the heavy- and light-hole <b>valence</b> <b>bands,</b> heavy holes as well as light holes form a multiple-component plasma coupled with longitudinal optical phonons. Line-shape analysis of the infrared response allows differentiating between light- and heavy-hole contributions to the carrier plasma, and the results observed suggest nonparabolicity effects of the heavy- and light-hole <b>valence</b> <b>bands</b> in GaAs...|$|R

25|$|When {{placed in}} the sun, photons of the {{sunlight}} can excite electrons on the p-type side of the semiconductor, {{a process known as}} photoexcitation. In silicon, sunlight can provide enough energy to push an electron out of the lower-energy <b>valence</b> <b>band</b> into the higher-energy conduction band. As the name implies, electrons in the conduction band are free to move about the silicon. When a load is placed across the cell as a whole, these electrons will flow out of the p-type side into the n-type side, lose energy while moving through the external circuit, and then flow back into the p-type material where they can once again re-combine with the valence-band hole they left behind. In this way, sunlight creates an electric current.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{localized}} ("intra-atomic") {{absorption of}} light which causes color for chromium and vanadium impurities, blue color in sapphires comes from intervalence charge transfer, {{which is the}} transfer of an electron from one transition-metal ion to another via the conduction or <b>valence</b> <b>band.</b> The iron can take the form Fe2+ or Fe3+, while titanium generally takes the form Ti4+. If Fe2+ and Ti4+ ions are substituted for Al3+, localized areas of charge imbalance are created. An electron transfer from Fe2+ and Ti4+ can cause {{a change in the}} valence state of both. Because of the valence change there is a specific change in energy for the electron, and electromagnetic energy is absorbed. The wavelength of the energy absorbed corresponds to yellow light. When this light is subtracted from incident white light, the complementary color blue results. Sometimes when atomic spacing is different in different directions there is resulting blue-green dichroism.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the nearly}} free {{electron}} approximation {{is able to}} describe many properties of electron band structures, one consequence of this theory is that it predicts {{the same number of}} electrons in each unit cell. If the number of electrons is odd, we would then expect that there is an unpaired electron in each unit cell, and thus that the <b>valence</b> <b>band</b> is not fully occupied, making the material a conductor. However, materials such as CoO that have an odd number of electrons per unit cell are insulators, in direct conflict with this result. This kind of material is known as a Mott insulator, and requires inclusion of detailed electron-electron interactions (treated only as an averaged effect on the crystal potential in band theory) to explain the discrepancy. The Hubbard model is an approximate theory that can include these interactions. It can be treated non-perturbatively within the so-called dynamical mean field theory, which attempts {{to bridge the gap between}} the nearly free electron approximation and the atomic limit. Formally, however, the states are not non-interacting in this case and the concept of a band structure is not adequate to describe these cases.|$|E
40|$|Through {{analyses}} of the density-matrix equations of motion for electrons in metals, we show that the energy band gap is enhanced when many electrons are excited from core to <b>valence</b> <b>bands,</b> indicating a tendency opposite to the band-gap reduction observed in the valence-electron excitation of semiconductors; it {{is a consequence of}} inhomogeneous excitation from highly localized core to delocalized <b>valence</b> <b>bands.</b> Such a band-gap enhancement suggests a blue shift of the photoabsorption edge, leading to a possibility of demonstrating saturable absorber switching by means of intense EUV or X-ray free-electron-laser pulses...|$|R

40|$|We have {{conducted}} temperature dependent Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) {{study of the}} electronic structure of n-, p- type PbTe, PbSe and PbS, which are pre- mier thermoelectric materials. Our ARPES measurements on them provide direct evidence for the light hole upper <b>valence</b> <b>bands</b> (UVBs) and the so-called heavy hole lower <b>valence</b> <b>bands</b> (LVBs), and an unusual temperature dependent relative movement between their band maxima leading to a monotonic decrease in the energy separation between LVBs and UVBs with increase in temperature. This enables convergence of these <b>valence</b> <b>bands</b> and consequently, an effective increase in the valley degeneracy in PbQ at higher temperatures, which has long been speculated to be the driving factor behind their extraordinary thermoelectric performance.

2500|$|In a {{semiconductor}} or band insulator, the Fermi {{level is}} surrounded by a band gap, referred to as the band gap (to distinguish it from the other band gaps in the band structure). The closest band above the band gap is called the conduction band, and the closest band beneath the band gap is called the <b>valence</b> <b>band.</b> The name [...] "valence band" [...] was coined by analogy to chemistry, since in many semiconductors the <b>valence</b> <b>band</b> is built out of the valence orbitals.|$|E

However, in order for an electron to jump from a <b>valence</b> <b>band</b> to a conduction band, it requires a specific minimum amount of energy for the transition. The required energy differs with different materials. Electrons can gain enough energy to jump to the conduction band by absorbing either a phonon (heat) or a photon (light).|$|E

2500|$|In {{solid-state}} physics, a band gap, {{also called}} an energy gap or bandgap, is an energy range in a solid where no electron states can exist. In graphs {{of the electronic}} band structure of solids, the band gap generally refers to the energy difference (in electron volts) between {{the top of the}} <b>valence</b> <b>band</b> and the bottom of the conduction band in insulators and semiconductors. [...] It is the energy required to promote a valence electron bound to an atom to become a conduction electron, which is free to move within the crystal lattice and serve as a charge carrier to conduct electric current. [...] It is closely related to the HOMO/LUMO gap in chemistry. If the <b>valence</b> <b>band</b> is completely full and the conduction band is completely empty, then electrons cannot move in the solid; however, if some electrons transfer from the valence to the conduction band, then current can flow (see carrier generation and recombination). Therefore, the band gap is a major factor determining the electrical conductivity of a solid. Substances with large band gaps are generally insulators, those with smaller band gaps are semiconductors, while conductors either have very small band gaps or none, because the valence and conduction bands overlap.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{the role}} of the π-electron system in {{determining}} the electronic properties of graphene, doping in carbon nanotubes differs from that of bulk crystalline semiconductors from the same group of the periodic table (e.g. silicon).

[...] However, some non-substitutional (intercalated or adsorbed) dopants introduced into a carbon nanotube, such as alkali metals as well as electron-rich metallocenes, result in n-type conduction because they donate electrons to the π-electron system of the nanotube. [...] By contrast, π-electron acceptors such as FeCl3 or electron-deficient metallocenes function as p-type dopants since they draw π-electrons away from the top of the <b>valence</b> <b>band.</b>|$|E
