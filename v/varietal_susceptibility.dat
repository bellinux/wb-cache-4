40|$|Fusarium {{species are}} found world-wide in maize and cause not only {{considerable}} crop losses, but produce also toxic secondary metabolites (mycotoxins) like deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone (ZEA). The {{purpose of this}} study was to carry out exploratory research about the presence of mycotoxins in maize. In a first experiment the <b>varietal</b> differences in <b>susceptibility</b> to Fusarium and contamination of mycotoxins were evaluated. Silage maize varieties seemed more susceptible to Fusarium than corn varieties. Even plants with no visible symptoms contained mycotoxins. High concentrations of DON and ZEA were found in kernels as well in the vegetative parts of the plant. Mycotoxins were especially located at the stem base. A clear relationship was detected between chlorophyll content and visible symptoms of Fusarium species. An ensilage experiment indicated that the ensilage process has no reducing effects on the mycotoxin content. Further research is necessary to confirm these first results...|$|R

40|$|The coconut mite, Aceria guerreronis Keifer, {{has emerged}} as a common menace to most of the coconut {{plantations}} in India. After its first upsurge in Kerala {{at the end of the}} 1990 ´s, the mite has spread to many states in southern and northern India, causing considerable damage. Coconut provides one third of the agricultural income in the regions in which it is grown and more than 10 million people are dependent on this cash crop directly or indirectly through coconut-based industries like coir, copra, oil, honey, furniture, handicrafts, beverages, bakery products and so on. The economic instability of the coconut farming community and the people employed in coconut-based industries rank the highest order.

30|$|Onion thrips {{represent}} {{a serious threat}} to cabbage production in cabbage growing regions of the world (Garamvölgyi et al. 2004; Shelton et al. 2008). Damage can appear as a bronze discoloration and/or a rough texture on leaves within the head (North and Shelton 1986 b) causing injury up to 20 layers deep (Trdan et al. 2005; Respondek and Zvalo 2008) and reducing marketable production. For Prince Edward Island (PEI), thrips can cause significant loss to the cabbage crop in organic fields. Control is often recommended at the early head formation stage (7.5  cm leaf ball) (PEI Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Aquaculture 2005), with pesticides available for conventional producers (Shelton et al. 1998; Trdan et al. 2007) but no viable products available for organic production. The decision to spray is currently based on a presence/absence determination of thrips. Avoiding thrips populations through selection of planting date and less susceptible varieties are two potential options available to organic growers. <b>Varietal</b> preference and <b>susceptibility</b> or resistance to thrips has been documented in Europe and the United States. Some of the traits investigated to explain this preference include leaf wax thickness, reflectance or color of the leaves around the head. In Hungary, 52 white cabbage varieties were evaluated for resistance to thrips damage. None of the varieties was completely resistant although a handful of varieties showed decreased susceptibility (Garamvölgyi et al. 2004). Other studies have found Thrips tabaci to exhibit a variety preference using locally available commercial varieties (Trdan et al. 2005; Shelton et al. 1998). Shelton et al. (2008) found planting date and variety to significantly influence the extent of thrips damage in the top 10 layers of cabbage head leaves. Cabbage planted later in the season (July 25 vs. July 3) experienced less damage for specific varieties. It is speculated that these later planted cabbage heads experienced lower thrips pressure due to reduced immigration into the field (North and Shelton 1986 b; Shelton and North 1986), or increased mortality due to high rainfall during {{the latter part of the}} season. Of the varieties commonly planted in PEI, it is unknown whether thrips show a preference, or if selecting early developing varieties and planting early in the season will serve to avoid the thrips populations.|$|R
40|$|Polystictus dieback" {{of apple}} trees {{is a serious}} problem in Australian {{orchards}} and the literature suggests that the disease is only extensive and causes severe injury to trees in orcharding areas of this country. The disease is associated with a wood rotting Basidiomycete, Trametes versicolor, {{and as a result of}} attack by this fungus limbs or whole trees may be destroyed. By growing apple trees in sand culture a quantitative relationship was established between a phosphorus deficiency and an increased susceptibility of limbs to destruction by the fungus (Wade, unpubl.). The results reported here are directed towards an attempt to explain the parasitic nature of T. versicolor on apple trees in Australia. A field survey failed on confirm any relationship between phosphorus status and the incidence of dieback in trees. The effects of reserve nutrients accumulated by trees on the development of the fungus were then examined using in vitro methods. The fungus was grown on blocks of apple wood in culture jars containing different nutrient sources incorporated in a medium. When a carbon source was absent from the media, decay of wood was high. With a high carbon or nitrogen deficient media wood decay was comparatively low. Solution culture experiments indicated that production of extracellular polyphenol oxidase is an important factor in this effect. With increasing glucose content of media, decay of wood was increasingly suppressed. Polyphenol oxidase production was suppressed with increasing media sugar levels. By extracting wood blocks before subjecting them to attack by the fungus the presence in the wood of an inhibitor to the growth of the fungus, was demonstrated. It was postulated that such an inhibitor may be associated with soluble sugar levels in trees. Inoculation trials demonstrated a <b>varietal</b> variation in <b>susceptibility</b> of trees to the disease, an increased amount of dieback resulting from winter inoculations and an inability of the fungus to grow in one year old wood. The trials also indicated a relation between high soluble sugar levels and a lower rate of establishment of the fungus. This result although not entirely conclusive, confirmed the results of the in vitroexperiments. It is concluded that environmental and managerial conditions to which trees are subjected in Australia, result in an increased susceptibility of limbs to attack and ultimate destruction by T. versicolor. The increased susceptibility of branches may be explained in terms of a lowered soluble sugar content and an associated lower level of the suggested inhibitory factor to the growth of the fungus...|$|R

40|$|Ramularia {{leaf spot}} (RLS) is widely present in Denmark {{nowadays}} {{and has the}} potential to reach severity levels high enough to cause economic damage. The results of multi-location surveys and field trials of several years suggest that varietal resistance can be an efficient means for controlling RLS. The spring barley cultivars most affected by RLS possess mlo-resistance against powdery mildew while the least affected ones do not. Other mildew resistances as well as <b>varietal</b> <b>susceptibility</b> to other foliar diseases were not clearly related to the RLS reaction pattern of neither spring- nor winter barley cultivars.

However, more work is needed to develop reliable methods for efficient RLS resistance testing and to determine the nature and genetic basis of RLS resistance and its relation to varietal resistances against other diseases...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} of the work were to investigate the suitability of selected varieties of vegetables and potatoes for organic production using organic or untreated seed on certified organic sites. Organic growing of vegetables and potatoes imposes restrictions on the treatments which growers can apply to crops to maximise yield and maintain quality. Hence choice of variety is more critical in organic situations than for conventional crops where problems can be solved {{at a later date}} by application of pesticides or fertilisers. Varieties are needed that can respond to the sometimes sub optimum conditions that are imposed by the restrictions of organic systems and identification of these are not always evident from trials under conventional conditions. In addition, variety choice may be restricted for organic growers as they are required to use organically produced seed of a variety where it is available. Derogation allows the use of untreated conventional seed where suitable varieties are not available organically. This project tested: 	 available organic seed as much of it has not been evaluated in any UK trials 	untreated seed of varieties in production for organic seed 	attempted to identify varieties of conventional seed that would be useful in organic systems so that organic seed can be produced. In this 3 year period trials were carried out on leeks, cabbage, celery, broccoli, lettuce, cauliflowers, carrots and potatoes. Varieties were assessed for yield, quality, pest and disease resistance and shelf life and storage where appropriate. Seed health was also checked to ascertain levels of seed borne disease. Results from these trials; Leeks Leeks were reasonably easy to grow organically. In our trials the main problems were weed control and leek rust infection although there is also the risk of thrip and White Tip infection. In some of the trials there was also an obvious nutrient shortage. A wide range of varieties is available differing in maturity, shank length disease resistance and winter-hardiness. In general the requirements of organic leek growers closely match those of conventional growers. Very few hybrids are available as organic seed. Cabbage 2001 to 2003 trials included a wide range of types. As for other brassica crops aphid infestation and speed of development were the most important factors in discriminating between varieties. In general smooth varieties were less affected than blistered varieties, early maturing varieties less affected than lates and red varieties less than green or white types. Celery Organic celery needs to be grown on water retaining soils and given adequate irrigation. just like the ICM crop. The biggest problem for the crop is Septoria, which can devastate plants very quickly. Starting with clean seed is essential but air-borne infection can come in from infected crops or debris. Giving plants better airflow from wider spacings or bed systems seems to delay infection. Slugs can also cause problems and data on both these problems was recorded and included in the published results. Broccoli Growing organic broccoli trials presented similar pest problems to other brassica crops in that cabbage root fly has to be avoided at establishment and aphid and caterpillar attacks later on. Fleece was used on all early trials but in later years it was not used to allow for easier weed control. Broccoli was fairly competitive with weeds and some recent trials were only hand weeded once. Fertility seems to be a problem and we did not achieve heavy crown weights. Lettuce A wide range of types of lettuce are important for organic growers and this series of trials included butterhead, crisphead, Batavian, Cos, Little Gem and leaf types. Vigour, flavour, disease, pest and tipburn resistance are all important characters for a successful organic variety. Fortunately there are more genetic pest and disease differences available in lettuce than for most other vegetable crops. In addition a large number of varieties are available as organic seed. Cauliflower Three maturity periods were sampled i. e. summer, late autumn and Spring Heading. Aphid and caterpillar damage were major problems and there was some evidence of <b>varietal</b> differences in <b>susceptibility.</b> When conventional trials with similar varieties were grown from the same planting dates the organic varieties were slower to mature. This may have been because nitrogen was more limited. Very few varieties of cauliflower are offered as organic seed and growers would struggle to find a good continuity program. Carrots The 2001 to 2003 trials concentrated on main crop varieties. A successful organic carrot variety needs most of the following: good early vigour to emerge quickly and compete with weeds, rapid bulking to compensate if late sowing is used to ovoid first generation carrot fly, large top for weed suppression and any pest or disease resistance available. Several mainly hybrid varieties performed very well in these trials. Potatoes Good seed quality is a fundamental in the production of a quality crop. Chitted seed will encourage rapid emergence and aid in better weed control and earlier bulking leading to bolder tuber samples. Variety selection should be made for rapid establishment, good ground cover, early bulking yield potential and a good resistance to pests and diseases, especially late blight. Sharpo Axona and Sharpo Mira had outstanding blight resistance. Shelf Life Shelf life depended on the health of produce tested. If healthy clean material was tested results were similar to those of conventional vegetables. If there was disease or pest damage {{at the beginning of a}} shelf life test then produce tended to deteriorate more quickly. Seed Health Seed borne disease levels were checked by the OSTS. In general brassicas were reasonably clean but some carrot and celery seed lots had high levels of Alternaria or Septoria infection. All trials were reported as NIAB One year results and also made available on the COSI web site: www. COSI. org In addition, data for over 400 varieties was summarised and published in the NIAB Organic Vegetable Handbook. ...|$|R

40|$|This disease {{appears to}} be {{relatively}} new to science although {{it is probable that}} it has existed, without recognition, for a considerable length of time. At first, attention was drawn to only the leaf spotting phase of the disease, when Pammel (19) in 1909 first referred to it. In 1910, Pammel and his co-workers (20) described the causal fungus, naming it Helminthosporium sativum. Bolley (5), however, was the first to point out that fungi such as this were present in soil, and tended to accumulate in wheat-sick soils following a period of intensive cropping. This observation was confirmed by Beckwith (4). Stakman (23) found that li. sativum attacked not only the leaves but also the stems and roots of barley and rye, causing a seedling blight and a root rot. She found the fungus would attack the leaves of certain grasses as well. The studies of Christensen (6) showed that li. sativum had a much wider host range than that formerly recognized and there were marked differences in <b>varietal</b> <b>susceptibility</b> to attack.

40|$|Postbloom fruit drop (PFD), caused {{primarily}} by Colletotrichum acutatum, {{is a serious}} disease annually in the humid tropical citrus areas of the Americas and occurs more sporadically in the humid subtropics. The fungus infects flowers of all citrus species producing orange-brown lesions on petals that result in abscission of the fruitlets leaving the persistent calyx and floral disk attached to the twigs. C. acutatum also causes Key lime anthracnose and is morphologically identical to PFD, but the strains can be differentiated by molecular means and pathogenicity tests. C. acutatum produces abundant conidia on infected petals that are dispersed {{primarily by}} rain splash. After the bloom season, the fungus persists as appressoria on persistent calyces and other vegetative plant parts. Those appressoria are stimulated to germinate by flower extracts and produce secondary conidia to initiate a new disease cycle. Some cultural measures are useful in reducing disease severity, but control is based principally on application of fungicides.

The QoI fungicides, folpet and tebuconazole + trifloxystrobin are the most effective among currently available materials.

Two fissure resistant varieties: Cypress (long-grain) and Reiziq (medium-grain) and susceptible varieties: YC 53 - 00 - 7 (long-grain) and Baru (medium-grain) were compared. The average head rice yield (HRY) of Cypress declined from 62. 7 % at 25 °C to 53. 5 % at 33 °C, while Reiziq declined from 56. 2 % (25 °C) to 47. 4 % (33 °C).

When grains were drier at harvest (15 % cf. 26 %) there was a greater reduction in HRY. When the four varieties were exposed to high temperature, the highest average reduction of HRY was recorded at 21 days after heading. It is important to choose an optimal sowing date to avoid coincidence of the final grainfilling stage with high temperatures, in order to minimize milling quality losses...|$|E
40|$|Opportunities {{exist to}} improve {{decision}} support systems {{through the use}} of dispersal information gained from epidemiological research. However, dispersal and demographic information is often fragmentary in plant pathology, and this uncertainty creates a risk of inappropriate action whenever such information is used as a basis for decision making. In this article, a scenario-based simulation approach is used to evaluate crop and economic risks and benefits in the use of dispersal information for decision making using the potato late blight pathosystem (Phytophthora infestans-Solanum tuberosum) as a case study. A recently validated spatiotemporal potato late blight model was coupled to submodels for crop growth, tuber dry matter production, and fungicide efficacy. The yield response of a range of management scenarios to a single influx of primary inoculum (the initial spore load) was calculated. Damage curves (relative yield loss versus initial spore load) from a range of combinations of <b>varietal</b> <b>susceptibility</b> and fungicide treatments were used to classify the various management scenarios as either sensitive to initial spore load or tolerant to initial spore load, thus identifying where a high degree of accuracy would be required in dispersal information for appropriate decision making, and where a greater degree of uncertainty could be tolerated. General epidemics, resulting from spatially homogeneous initial spore loads, responded more strongly {{to the size of the}} initial spore load than focal epidemics, resulting from an initial spot infection. Susceptible cultivars responded with sizeable yield losses even at low levels of initial spore load, regardless of the fungicide management regime used. These results indicated that, for susceptible cultivars (late cultivars in particular), the degree of accuracy that would be required in dispersal information for appropriate decision making is unlikely to be practically attainable. The results also indicated that, contrary to "folk wisdom," spore loads of a few hundred spores per square meter do not lead to appreciable crop loss in resistant cultivars and are therefore acceptable. We conclude that scope exists for including dispersal information in decision making for potato late blight with resistant potato cultivars but not for susceptible cultivars. The modeling framework used in this study can be extended to investigate the scope for inclusion of dispersal information in decision support for other aerially transmitted pathogens...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Over {{the period}} of 2014 - 2015, on the {{experimental}} field of the Institute of Agriculture in Karnobat, Bulgaria, was set a field trial with twenty cultivars of barley – 15 two-row: Obzor, Emon, Perun, Orfey, Lardeya, Asparuh, Kuber, Zagorets, Imeon, Sayra, Devinya, Sitara, Krami, Vicky, Potok; 3 four-row: Veslets, Aheloy 2, Tamaris; and 2 six-row cultivars – IZ Bori and Bozhin. All the cultivars were grown in three types of farming: conventional, organic and biodynamic. In conventional farming were applied pesticides and nitrogen fertilization. In the organic production were not used pesticides, mineral and organic fertilizers; and in biodynamic farming was applied biodynamic compost prepared from manure and biodynamic preparations (also organic). In conventional farming, the seeds were disinfected before sowing with Kinto plus (Triticonazole 20 g/l + Prochloraz 60 g/l), {{at a rate of}} 150 ml/ 100 kg seeds. In organic and biodynamic farming were used nondisinfected seeds. In the phenophase of full maturity of barley was conducted monitoring survey for plants infected with loose smut in all 2 the trial variants, the number of infected plants per m were counted and the infection rates were calculated. Infected plants of Tamaris grown in the three types of farming underwent microscopic analysis and measurement of 100 teliospores from each variant. The aim of this experiment was to investigate <b>varietal</b> <b>susceptibility</b> of barley to Ustilago nuda, grown in three types of farming, and to establish if the growing method affects the size of the teliospores of the pathogen. With two-row barley were found plants of Lardeya, Kuber, Devinya, Krami and Vicky infected with Ustilago nuda. Krami manifested the lowest resistance in the three types of farming. With four-row barley, Tamaris was found to be highly susceptible and Veslets was poorly resistant. Both cultivars expressed weaker susceptibility in conventional and biodynamic farming and stronger in organic. With six-row cultivars was found no infection. The cultivars of Obzor, Emon, Perun, Orfey, Asparuh, Zagorets, Imeon, Sayra, Sitara, Potok, Aheloy 2, IZ Bori and Bozhin were resistant to Ustilago nuda and are suitable to be grown in the three types of farming.

40|$|An {{internal}} fruit rot {{disease of}} sweet peppers, first reported in Canada in 2000, later {{emerged as a}} significant disease of greenhouse-grown bell pepper worldwide. It is caused primarily {{by members of the}} Fusarium lactis species complex (FLASC) {{and to a lesser extent}} by Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium proliferatum. After infection via the flowers, the fungus stays latent in the fruit until maturity. During ripening, the fungus starts to proliferate on the inside of the fruit. Later, sunken lesions appear on the outside. Nearly all growers are confronted with this problem to some extent, with an average annual yield loss estimated at 5 % and seasonal peaks up to 20 %. Despite the importance of the disease, particularly during years with high disease incidence, efficient control is lacking. A multidisciplinary approach is clearly needed. Here we report on the potential use of Biological Control Agents (BCA) and plant resistance elicitors as well as susceptibility trials of pepper varieties. Seven BCAs were active in vitro. These were tested under conventional greenhouse conditions. First, one-dayold flowers were separately inoculated with BCAs. One day later they were inoculated with FLASC. The infection incidence in two-week-old fruits and mature fruits was determined using surface disinfection and plating techniques. Two BCA isolates (one commercially available and one KUL isolate) reduced the number of infected fruits by 50 %. Another strategy to reduce the initial infection of the flowers was tested, i. e. inducing plant resistance using elicitors. Three commercial elicitors were tested twice under greenhouse conditions and applied at recommended dose. The infection incidence was determined at 4 time points during fruit development. Surprisingly, no decline in the infection rate was observed. To evaluate the difference in susceptibility between pepper varieties, fruits of 12 varieties were pin-wounded and inoculated with a mycelium plug of FLASC. The lesion size on the yellow varieties was significantly larger than those on the red varieties. In addition, controlled in situ flower inoculations with FLASC were conducted on different varieties. Fruit infection was determined two weeks after inoculation and at harvest. Red and yellow cultivars were equally susceptible to infection but the final percentage of symptomatic fruit was significantly different between some varieties. Although no variety showed complete resistance, some had significantly less disease. The results were consistent with those of the previous year, suggesting these assays may give a good indication of <b>varietal</b> <b>susceptibility.</b> These studies showed that both BCAs and pepper variety can contribute to the multidisciplinary control of Fusarium internal fruit rot. When used with other measures (e. g. climatic control) yield loss may be reduced to a commercially acceptable level.

Mean vase life (12 days) of sunflower varieties in the yellow group was longer than the orange group (10 days), which in turn were longer and significantly different (p< 0. 05) from the bicolor group (9 days), and {{significantly different from the}} red group (8 days). There was no relationship between head diameter, petal length and abscission tendency in sunflowers. It was also observed that petal drop in all the sunflower varieties was ethylene insensitive. Three types of phytohormones (cytokinins, ABA and auxins) were present in abscission zone tissues of 5 sunflower genotypes, Procut Yellow Lite (PYL: yellow group), Procut Lemon (PL: yellow group), Strawberry Blonde (SB: red group). Procut Bicolor (PBC: bicolor group), and Moulin Rouge (MR: red group). Two groups of cytokinins were detected: the zeatin + zeatin riboside (Z + ZR) group and the iso- pentenyl adenosine (iPA) group. The levels of 'Z+ZR' in PYL and PBC were significantly higher (p< 0. 05) than in PL, SB, and MR, while levels of 'iPA' in PYL, PL and PBC were significantly higher than in SB and MR. It was also observed that PYL and PBC were significantly high in cytokinins but low in ABA. There were significantly low (p< 0. 05) levels of auxin in sunflower abscission zone tissues within 1 hour of flower opening in all genotypes. The genotypes with the shorter vase life (PBC, SB and MR) had the highest levels of ABA in their petals while those with the longer vase life (PYL and PL) had the smallest amounts of ABA in their petals. Petal detachment forces were significantly higher (p< 0. 05) when dipped in cytokinins (BAP- 10 and Fascination- BA+GA 4 + 7) than in the controls. At higher concentrations of up to 300 ppm, detachment forces decreased in Fascination treated plants more than in BAP- 10 treated plants. When sunflower heads were dipped for 10 minutes in different concentrations of BAP- 10 and BA+GA 4 + 7 and kept for 14 days, abscission was delayed and vase life was extended by 4 and 6 days, respectively. Anatomical analysis revealed a differentiated region (the abscission zone) at the junction of the petal and achene consisting of cells with a different morphology from those above and below it. Cell division at the abscission zone of the short- lived variety occurred earlier a n d fa s t e r than that in the long-lived variety. These differences indicate that whereas the anatomical and cellular nature of the abscission zone is similar in the two lines (PYL and PBC), the tempo of development differs. Specifically, the abscission layer reaches full differentiation, or maturity, sooner in line PBC, hence its earlier petal drop, than in line PYL. 2018 - 01 - 2...|$|E
40|$|The studies {{reported}} in the present thesis have been concerned with the biochemistry of the <b>varietal</b> <b>susceptibility</b> of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars to the substituted phenylurea herbicide, metoxuron (N'-(3 -chloro- 4 -methoxyphenyl) -N,N-dimethylurea). The introduction includes an historical account of the substituted phenylureas and reviews {{of the relationships between}} structure and phytotoxicity and mechanism of action. In addition selective properties of phenylureas are discussed together with their metabolic fate not only in plants but also in microorganisms and mammalian systems. Present concepts of the photosynthetic process are also outlined with special emphasis on those aspects directly pertinent to the mode of action of the substituted phenylureas. Studies of Hill activity of isolated chloroplasts incubated with metoxuron showed a similar inhibition of DCPIP and potassium ferricyanide photoreductions in both resistant (Capelle Desprez, Cama) and susceptible (Maris Nimrod, Maris Huntsman) plants. Examination of the Hill activity of chloroplasts isolated from herbicide-treated plants showed a greater inhibition of DCPIP and ferricyanide photoreductions in susceptible compared with resistant varieties. Whereas a severe inhibition of Hill activity in susceptible varieties was followed by scorching and eventual death of the plant, tolerant cultivars recovered from an initial slight visible injury in parallel with a return of Hill activity to normal levels. A reduction in the proportion of ethanol soluble material of leaves was also observed 24 h following treatment of wheat plants with metoxuron, the susceptible varieties showing the greater decrease. The distinction between resistant and susceptible varieties was more apparent when plants that had contacted the herbicide for longer periods were investigated. These results were also reflected in a greater inhibition of CC fixation by metoxuron-treated leaves of susceptible plants compared to similarly treated resistant strains. Studies of absorption and translocation of (methoxy-C) -metoxuron in resistant and susceptible wheat varieties, indicated that a differential rate of herbicide uptake may represent a factor which contributes to the observed difference in varietal response. A subcellular organelle localisation study of absorbed (methoxy-C) -metoxuron indicated that on the basis of protein content the greatest amounts of radioactivity were associated with the chloroplast fraction. In addition, chloroplasts from susceptible varieties contained a quantity of metoxuron several fold greater than those of resistant plants. Metabolism studies made using (methoxy-C) -metoxuron indicated that a major degradative pathway in wheat involves a two-step N-dealkylation followed by hydrolysis of the ureido group to give the corresponding aniline derivative. The various metabolites were separated by thin-layer chromatography and their identity was revealed by a comparison of their Rf values with those of known synthesised standards. Time course studies indicated that metoxuron metabolites represented a greater proportion of the radioactivity of the total methanol extract from resistant plants than from susceptible types. The metabolic route outlined was shown to result in an effective detoxication of metoxuron in in vitro assays of Hill reaction activity where the N-monodes methylated derivative was found to be some 80 % as inhibitory as metoxuron and the N-bisdesmethyl and aniline derivatives were ineffective as photosynthetic inhibitors. Experiments made using leaf discs contained in Warburg flasks in 14 14 the presence of a CO 2 trap demonstrated a loss of CO from (methoxy-C) -metoxuron indicating that cleavage of the methoxy substituent of the aromatic ring represents a significant additional step in the metabolism of the herbicide. Cleavage of the methoxy group occurred at an appreciably greater rate in leaf discs of resistant compared to susceptible plants. Preliminary experiments would indicate that metabolism of metoxuron by wheat leaves is achieved by the microsomal fraction of the cells which contains an N-demethylase activity requiring molecular oxygen and reduced pyridine nucleotide as co-factors. This activity was most apparent in the microsomal fraction prepared from leaves of resistant varieties. The various experimental results are discussed in terms of their significance in accounting for the differences in response to metoxuron of the wheat varieties studied. <p...|$|E
