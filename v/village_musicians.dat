50|$|Henry Ernst, an East German sound {{engineer}} who frequently travelled in Romania, returned to northern Romania in October 1996 {{to search for}} traditional <b>village</b> <b>musicians.</b> In Moldavia a farmer suggested he head to the small Gypsy village of Zece Prajini where a brass band existed to play weddings and baptisms. Ernst {{made his way to}} Zece Prajini - the village wasso obscure locals would boast “it is not on any map” - and, upon arrival, asked about the brass band. He was introduced to Ioan Ivancea, a local farmer and clarinet player who was considered to be the leader of the village's musicians. Ivancea invited Ernst to stay with him and assembled the brass band he led to play. Ernst was impressed by the band's speed, finesse, repertoire and unique tunings. Ernst also realised that the village band were one of the few Gypsy brass bands still in existence in Romania and, through being isolated from contemporary popular music, played in a manner quite different to that of the Balkan brass bands found in southern Serbia, Macedonia and Bulgaria. Ernst determined to return to Germany and set up a tour for Fanfare Ciocârlia - as the band had now named themselves - and told the musicians that they should apply for passports. Back in Germany, {{with the help of his}} friend Helmut Neumann, Ernst managed to book Fanfare Ciocârlia into a series of festival and club dates.

Then he received a phone call from WDR, a German public-broadcasting institution and festival promoter at the time, who wanted to book Fanfare Ciocârlia and was willing to pay a fee that would cover all transport, visas and other expenses and leave enough money for Ernst and Neumann to form Asphalt Tango management and booking agency.|$|E
