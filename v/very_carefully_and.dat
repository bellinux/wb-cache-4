25|$|A {{story is}} told of the young duke of Burgundy, Fénelon's pupil, who was then only eleven years old, sending 50 louis to La Fontaine as a present of his own motion. But, though La Fontaine {{recovered}} for the time, he was broken by age and infirmity, and his new hosts had to nurse rather than to entertain him, which they did <b>very</b> <b>carefully</b> <b>and</b> kindly. He did a little more work, completing his Fables among other things; {{but he did not}} survive Madame de la Sablière much more than two years, dying on 13 April 1695 in Paris, at the age of seventy-three. When the Père Lachaise Cemetery opened in Paris, La Fontaine's remains were moved there. His wife survived him nearly fifteen years.|$|E
25|$|In Fascist Italy in the 1930s, aviation-themed {{films were}} used as {{propaganda}} tools to complement the massed flights led by Italo Balbo in promoting the regime domestically and abroad. One such film was the most successful Italian film of the pre-World War II era; Luciano Serra pilota (Luciano Serra, Pilot) was inextricably linked to the Fascist government via Mussolini's son Vittorio, who was {{the driving force behind}} the film's production. The film, set between 1921 and the Italo-Abyssinian War, was used to compare the allegedly moribund state of aviation in pre-Fascist Italy with the purported power of the Regia Aeronautica and Italian aviation in general in the 1930s. However, by the time that Luciano Serra pilota was shown at the 1938 Venice Film Festival, the link between aviation and Fascism had already been firmly established in the minds of the Italian people through widespread depictions of aircraft in a variety of media. For example, there was an entire branch of the Futurist Art movement devoted to aviation, known as Aeropittura ("Aeropainting"). While many of the Aeropittura works were devoted to flight rather than aircraft per se, some did celebrate Italian aviation exploits, such as Alfredo Ambrosi's Il volo su Vienna (The Flight over Vienna) which depicted in Futurist style the World War I exploit of Gabriele d'Annunzio; although the city of Vienna is shown in abstract in accordance with the aims of Aeropittura – namely to show the dynamism and excitement of flight – the Ansaldo SVA aircraft are <b>very</b> <b>carefully</b> <b>and</b> accurately rendered.|$|E

500|$|A second {{concept for}} the future of naval {{aviation}} emerged in the early 1970s as the first of a new class of [...] "through deck cruisers" [...] was planned. These were <b>very</b> <b>carefully</b> <b>and</b> politically designated as cruisers to deliberately avoid the term [...] "aircraft carrier", in order to increase the chances of funding from a hostile political climate against expensive capital ships, they were considerably smaller than the previously sought CVA-01. These ships were ordered as the Invincible class in 1973, and are now popularly recognised as aircraft carriers. Almost immediately upon their construction, a ski-jump was added {{to the end of the}} 170-metre deck, enabling the carriers to effectively operate a small number of V/STOL jets. The Royal Air Force's Hawker Siddeley Harrier GR1s had entered service in April 1969. A navalised variant of the Harrier was developed by Hawker Siddeley to serve on the upcoming ships, this became the Sea Harrier. In 1975, the Royal Navy ordered 24 Sea Harrier FRS.1 (standing for 'Fighter, Reconnaissance, Strike') aircraft, the first of which entered service in 1978. [...] During this time Hawker Siddeley became part of British Aerospace through nationalisation in 1977. By the time the prototype Sea Harrier was flown at Dunsfold on 20 August 1978 the order had been increased to 34. The Sea Harrier was declared operational in 1981 on board the first Invincible class ship HMS Invincible, and further aircraft joined the ageing HMS Hermes aircraft carrier later that year.|$|E

[...] This is a serious man who takes the responsibilities that have been given to him as a great privilege and a great honor which he holds <b>very</b> <b>carefully</b> <b>and</b> gently in his hands.' [...] Said another senator, this one from Kentucky, 'Judge Gonzales is proof that in America, there are no artificial barriers to success.

[...] And luckily for his country, he is not quite finished climbing yet.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Satoshi Kanazawa {{said that}} part of the success of eHarmony can be {{explained}} by the high cost of entry in terms of the amount of time required to answer the initial questionnaire—over 18 hours, although other sources put the time to complete the relationship questionnaire at approximately one hour. Using Laurence Iannaccone's original idea that success of fundamentalist churches is explained by the high demands imposed on their members, Kanazawa hypothesizes that a similar self-selection mechanism is at work with eHarmony: [...] "they select their members <b>very</b> <b>carefully,</b> <b>and</b> only admit those who are very committed (or desperate; if anyone who chooses to join eHarmony is truly desperate to get married, then it can potentially and partially explain why it produces such a high proportion of all marriages in the US)." [...] Another factor suggested by Dan Ariely is the limited choice of partners offered, which may make the decision easier for some.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout his age-36 {{season of}} 2003, Walker battled knee, shoulder, hamstring, groin and hip ailments. [...] The knee injury {{occurred}} in a collision with Preston Wilson on August 2. [...] In {{spite of all the}} injuries, Walker never missed more than three consecutive games and made 143 appearances. [...] He hit 16 home runs and 79 RBI while batting [...]284, just the second time since 1993 his average had slipped below [...]300. [...] He drew a career-high 98 bases on balls, resulting in a [...]422 on-base percentage, the seventh time in his career he reached [...]400. [...] He was fifth in the NL in OBP, sixth in IBB (16), eighth in BB, and ninth in HBP (11). [...] Commented manager Don Baylor, “Even with the injuries and the lack of numbers from what they {{used to be in the}} past, Larry is still pitched to <b>very</b> <b>carefully</b> <b>and</b> fearfully throughout the league.
