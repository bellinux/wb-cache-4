40|$|Crown {{roots are}} main {{components}} of the fibrous root system and important for crops to anchor and absorb water and nutrition. To understand the molecular mechanisms of crown root formation, we isolated a rice mutant defective in crown root emergence designated as Oscand 1 (named after the Arabidopsis homologous gene AtCAND 1). The defect of <b>visible</b> <b>crown</b> root in the Oscand 1 mutant {{is the result of}} cessation of the G 2 /M cell cycle transition in the crown root meristem. Map-based cloning revealed that OsCAND 1 is a homolog of Arabidopsis CAND 1.

The transgenic plants harboring DR 5 ::GUS showed that auxin signaling in crown root tip is abnormal in the mutant. Exogenous auxin application can partially rescue the defect of crown root development in Oscand 1. Taken together, these data show that OsCAND 1 is involved in auxin signaling to maintain the G 2 /M cell cycle transition in crown root meristem and, consequently, the emergence of crown root.

We selected 90 spruce trees representing 30 triples of different crown status: healthy, stressed and declining to assess the relationship between crown and fine root status. Sequential coring and in-growth bags were applied to each triplet to investigate fine root biomass and growth in the soil depths of 0 - 10 and 10 - 20 cm. Fine root quantity (biomass and necromass), turnover (production over standing stock), morphological features (specific root length, root tip density) and chemical properties (Ca:Al molar ratio) were compared among the abovementioned health status categories. Living fine root biomass decreased with increasing stress, while the ratio of living to dead biomass increased. Annual fine root production decreased and specific root length increased in stressed trees when compared to healthy or declining trees, a situation which {{may be related to the}} position of trees in the canopy (healthy and declining – dominant, stressed – co-dominant).

The consequences may include gingivitis, periodontitis, and hypersensitivity. Whereas the management can include surgical treatment options, sometimes a more conservative, yet still esthetic approach may be required. The use of gingiva-colored composites provides one such alternative {{and can be}} applied to varying presentations of the problem. While surgical treatment can be successful in re-creating favorable esthetic anatomy as well as achieving accurate tissue contour in cases when minor amounts of tissue are reconstructed, long-term results vary because of the vascularity and complexity of the interdental space. Factors such as cost, healing time, discomfort, and variable long-term results make surgery an unpopular choice. If tooth-colored restorative materials are utilized to restore cervical tooth exposure as a result of severe recession, the disproportionate appearance of the <b>visible</b> <b>crown</b> may give a dissatisfying result. Gingiva-colored composite provides dental practitioners with a versatile material {{that can be used to}} directly restore cervical defects caused by gingival recession, thus correcting the appearance of the gingival anatomy.

The major problem of measuring exact stand height to predict stand volume from aerial photos was overcome by the development of two new volume equations which use percent crown closure, <b>visible</b> <b>crown</b> diameter and height classes as the independent variables. By the use of height classes, the photo interpreter is required to separate stand heights as to tall, medium or short. Equations are presented for both board- and cubic-foot volumes. Two computer programs were developed which reduce office calculations to a minimum. The programs compute photo volumes per plot, total gross and net volume estimations per area, standard errors and select the field plots to be sampled. The sampling design was tested on four test areas, using both quarter- and one-acre photo plots, and quarter-acre fixed-area and variable-area field plots at four photo scales. Based on these results a sample of about 20 field measured quarter-acre field plots combined with a 100 percent photo cruise on 1 : 7, 000 aerial photos would be expected to produce gross volume estimations for a forty-acre tract of + 10 percent. at a 68 percent confidence level...|$|E

We tested the silvicultural recommendation that lianas should be cut from Brazil nut trees (Bertholletia excelsa) to improve host tree fecundity and thus, commercial nut yields. Our 10 -year experiment was conducted where local harvesters collect Brazil nuts {{as part of their}} forest-based livelihoods. We cut 454 lianas from 78 of 138 host trees &# 8805; 50 cm DBH. Treated trees were better producers 3. 5 years after liana cutting, and by years 9 and 10 produced three times more fruits than untreated trees. Number of lianas rooted within 5 m of the host tree explained production levels, suggesting both above- and belowground liana competition.

We surveyed the severity of <b>visible</b> O₃ injuries, <b>crown</b> defoliation, and tree mortality of Pinus uncinata, the dominant species in subalpine forests in this mountain range, along two altitudinal and O₃ gradients in the central Catalan Pyrenees and analysed their relationships with the local environmental conditions. The severity of visible O₃ injuries increased with increasing mean annual [O₃] when summer water availability was high (summer precipitation/potential evapotranspiration above 0. 96), whereas higher [O₃] did not produce more visible injuries during drier conditions. Mean crown defoliation and tree mortality ranged between 20. 4 – 66. 4 and 0. 6 – 29. 6 %, respectively, depending on the site. Both were positively correlated with the accumulated O₃ exposure during the last 5 years and with variables associated with soil–water availability, which favours greater O₃ uptake by increasing stomatal conductance.

40|$|BACKGROUND A {{traumatic}} {{injury to}} the primary dentition can cause damage to the germ of the permanent successor. As a clinical consequence a dilaceration with root deformation, malpositioning and disturbances of eruption can occur. Surgical repositioning of such a dislocated crown of a developing tooth can be a treatment option. CASE REPORT A four year old patient was referred to our clinic because of a mobile upper primary central incisor and a radiographically <b>visible</b> displaced dental <b>crown.</b> Her history revealed a traumatic dental injury one year ago. Radiologic examination confirmed an inflammatory root resorption on tooth 61 and a dislocation of the developing tooth 21. In order to avoid further displacement due to the inflammation, 61 was extracted at the first appointment. A radiographic image 7 months later showed no improvement in the malposition of tooth 21. Therefore tooth 21 was surgically repositioned into its correct position. Follow-up over 3 years confirmed a continued root development and a full eruption of 21 in its correct position. CONCLUSION Early diagnosis and early treatment of a dislocated permanent tooth germ is essential to allow a favorable outcome. Surgical repositioning can be successful in avoiding later malpositioning of the permanent teeth...|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, {{the crown}} was {{discovered}} by a woman from Cedros, who, when she heard that they were searching for it, was suspicious that they were pirates and attempted to hide the crown. She wisely raised her skirt, and placed her leg through the ring-like crown, and passed unbeknownst to the pirates. Realizing {{the value of the}} object, and not wanting her contemporaries to know what she had hidden, she continued to wear the crown around her leg until it began to swell and hurt. In the end she informed the towns-people, who attempted to extricate the woman from the crown, washing her leg in water and ash soap to loosen it, but without success. In the end, the residents had no alternative but to cut the crown and later re-solder it cautiously. In the end the crown remained in the parish of Cedros and over time it was used in the feasts to the Divine Holy Spirit. With the passing of time and fearful of damaging such a symbolic and rich object, a copy of the crown was created, and the original was hidden away and guarded. As the legend ends, the crown continues to be guarded every year at the home of the mordomo of the Holy Spirit feasts, and that the cuts are still <b>visible</b> around the <b>crown.</b> It is unknown whether any part of the above story is more than legend.|$|R
40|$|Estimation of tree heights {{for large}} territories is either {{expensive}} if {{done in the}} field or imprecise when accomplished through automated stereophotogrammetry. While scanning laser altimetry provides a solution, estimating the height on an individual tree using such an approach requires that a laser spot fall near the point of maximum height, an event that cannot normally be verified unless ancillary data is available. Two distinct aerial surveys of an 8 km 2 area of the boreal forest in Québec, Canada, yielded respectively 50 cm resolution multispectral imagery and a laser altimetry coverage (the average distance between to hits being approximately 1. 5 m). Subtracting the interpolated terrain altitudes from the interpolated canopy altitudes yielded a 50 cm resolution canopy height model (CHM). The multispectral imagery was overlaid onto the CHM after rectification to help locate trees and provide information on species. The height of individual trees read from the CHM {{at the center of}} the tree <b>crowns</b> <b>visible</b> on the overlaid multispectral imagery were compared with field observations consisting of the mean of two height measurements for each GPS-positioned tree. A linear regression model between actual and laser-predicted heights yielded a R 2 of 0. 90 for 36 trees (hardwood and softwood). The mean difference between actual tree height and laser-predicted tree height is 1. 4 m, while the mean difference between the two ground measurements for the same trees is 1. 5 m, suggesting that the accuracy of height prediction based on laser altimetry is comparable to that of ground measures. The correlation between crown radius and laser-predicted height error is- 0. 76, confirming that smaller trees have a lower chance of being properly hit by the laser beam. Current research is directed toward the bettering of the predictions and the automation of the process...|$|R
40|$|While much {{of modern}} {{developmental}} biology has focussed upon molecularly defined cell populations, relatively little is understood about how clonal groups within these broad cell populations organise complex tissues. In this thesis, I explore the clonal {{architecture of the}} jaws and teeth, and of the dermal bones of the calvaria, revealing cryptic modules as novel developmental features in both. I combine Confetti multicolour genetic lineage labelling with novel analytical techniques in order to map clonal populations in 3 D and provide quantitative parameters for clonal expansions. Tooth identity within the mandible {{is thought to be}} encoded by the an initial proximodistal position within the branchial arch, which implies that cells do not undergo migration. I observe distal Hand 2 -Cre labelled cells in the proximal territory, which necessitates migration. These distal cells give rise to the mandible, alveolar bone and a small proportion of odontoblasts, while unlabelled proximal cells were found in the distal territory of the incisors in different proportions. The clonal composition of teeth and jaw bones is dissected by novel analysis of mixed cell populations. I find odontogenic and alveolar bone populations to share a common lineage, comprising a cryptic developmental unit distinct from the mandible, a feature that I can also verify in another transgenic for the upper jaw. I also find that the initial tooth composition radically changes in ontogenetic time. Starting from similar compositions of distal and proximal cells I find that in incisors the distal population expands while the proximal wanes, while in molars the opposite occurs. This is the first evidence for a temporally changing cell population structure underlying the well defined heterodonty between incisors and molars and allows a reinterpretation of early tooth specification events. The dermal bones of the calvaria are thought to grow in thickness by static osteoblasts depositing matrix appositionally and growth is supposed to occur exclusively at sutures. Whole calvaria single-cell clonal lineage analysis of cranial neural crest cells with Wnt 1 -Cre and Confetti labelling reveals an extensively dynamic program of invasive growth distributed throughout all parts of the dermal bone. Cryptic clonal modules grow laterally, with invasion through and into the bone primarily organised around the centres of these `patches'. The process of bone maturation is revealed to consist of a series of invasions between the three layers of the bone, with the innermost compacta layer driving initial thickness growth by invasion into the middle spongy layer, and the outermost (dermis-adjacent) compacta layer driving later growth. Conversely {{there is no evidence to}} suggest that the sutures are principal generative regions, as they do not share a common clonal lineage with adjacent bone. I also investigate muscle attachment regions and find that the same clones traverse tissue boundaries from bone into muscle connective tissues, thus a clonal model predicated on joint 'attachment point precursor cells' can now explain patterns of skeletomuscular connectivity previously found at the population level by my supervisor. A novel generative model of bone growth from cryptic clonal patch modules is proposed, allowing us for the first time to understand thickness growth and the evolutionary transition from a micromeric to a macromeric dermal bone condition, events first <b>visible</b> in <b>crown</b> gnathostomes (placoderms) ...|$|R
