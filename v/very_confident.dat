Nine teams participated, with the {{exception}} of Honda and Super Aguri, who opted to test at the Jerez circuit.

5|$|Dumouriez {{thought his}} soldiers' morale was too shaky for a retreat so he {{advanced}} on Coburg's army, seeking battle. In his haste, the French commander failed {{to call up}} Harville's corps or the Army of Holland as reinforcements. Earlier, François Joseph Drouot de Lamarche had been driven out of Tienen (Tirlemont), but on 16 March the French recaptured it after a vigorous combat. The French attacked Tienen with 10,000 troops while Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen defended the town with 6,000 soldiers, six guns and two mortars. French casualties numbered 500 while their opponents sustained losses of 800 killed, wounded and missing. Coburg pulled his army back behind the Little Gete River. Believing that he outnumbered his enemies, Dumouriez was <b>very</b> <b>confident</b> of success. A century before, the French had won the Battle of Landen on the same ground.|$|E

25|$|Jones {{set about}} his innings in a workman-like fashion {{and kept the}} {{scoreboard}} ticking over. He and Boon put on 96 for the fourth wicket, before the different pace at running between the wickets of the burly Tasmanian and greyhound-like Jones led to Boon's run out for 38. This brought Steve Waugh to the wicket for the Australians, who so far had not been dismissed all series. Jones had edged past fifty and was looking <b>very</b> <b>confident</b> as the day wore on. The pair added a further 31, and despite day one ending with an almost biblical-scale lightning storm and flash flood, Australia ended day one on 234 for 4, with Dean Jones 71 not out, and Steve Waugh 17 not out.|$|E
25|$|In the {{academic}} world, plagiarism by students is usually considered {{a very serious}} offense that can result in punishments such as a failing grade on the particular assignment, the entire course, or even being expelled from the institution. Generally, the punishment increases as a person enters higher institutions of learning. The seriousness with which academic institutions address student plagiarism may be tempered by a recognition that students may not fully understand what plagiarism is. A 2015 study showed that students who were new to university study {{did not have a}} good understanding of even the basic requirements of how to attribute sources in written academic work, yet students were <b>very</b> <b>confident</b> that they understood what referencing and plagiarism are. The same students also had a lenient view of how plagiarism should be penalised.|$|E

25|$|C++ also {{provides}} the dynamic_cast operator, which allows code to safely attempt conversion of an object, via a base reference/pointer, {{to a more}} derived type: downcasting. The attempt is necessary as often one does not know which derived type is referenced. (Upcasting, conversion to a more general type, can always be checked/performed at compile-time via static_cast, as ancestral classes are specified in the derived class's interface, visible to all callers.) dynamic_cast relies on run-time type information (RTTI), metadata in the program that enables differentiating types and their relationships. If a dynamic_cast to a pointer fails, {{the result is the}} nullptr constant, whereas if the destination is a reference (which cannot be null), the cast throws an exception. Objects known to be of a certain derived type can be cast to that with static_cast, bypassing RTTI and the safe runtime type-checking of dynamic_cast, so this should be used only if the programmer is <b>very</b> <b>confident</b> the cast is, and will always be, valid.|$|E
