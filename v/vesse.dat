The northern part of Estonia – more exactly Harjumaa and Virumaa districts (in German: Harrien und Wierland) – was a nominal possession of Denmark until 1346.

In the winter of 1344, one day before Shrove Tuesday, the knights penetrated the stronghold after tearing down one of the battlements. According to Wigand of Marburg, 2,000 people were killed in the fortress. Germans lost 500 killed. The Oeselian king <b>Vesse</b> was captured, tortured, and then executed.

Introduction: The aim of surgical treatment of aneurysm is complete aneurysm obliteration and maintenance of a physiologic flow in the proximal and distal vessels. To avoid any risks of failing these aims intraoperative-angiography was introduced in neurosurgery first, followed by microdoppler-ultrasonography and lately with Indocyanine-Green-Videoangiography (ICG-VA).

Starting from a unique user-provided root point, an initial tree is built with a technique relying on minimal paths. Within the constructed tree, the central curve of each segment and an associated variable radius function evolve in order to satisfy a region homogeneity criterion.

40|$|Summary: A 47 -year-old woman, who {{had lost}} vision in her left eye because of a giant left supraclinoid {{internal}} carotid artery aneurysm, was referred for endovascular treatment.

Preventive measures {{should be taken to}} avert worsening of mass effect when giant aneurysms become thrombotic.

FIRE has a major radius of 2 m, a field on axis of 10 T, a plasma current of 6. 4 MA. It is capable of 18 second pulses when operated with DT and 26 s when operated with DD. The general arrangement consists of sixteen wedged TF coils that surround a free standing central solenoid, a double wall vacuum vessel and internal plasma facing components that are segmented for maintenance through horizontal ports. Large rings located outside the TF coils are used to obtain a load balance between wedging of the intercoil case structure and wedging at the upper/lower inboard corners of the TF coil winding. The magnets are liquid nitrogen cooled and the entire device is surrounded by a thermal enclosure. The double wall vacuum <b>vesse...</b>|$|E

40|$|Medical imaging is an {{important}} part of the clinical workflow. With the increasing amount and complexity of image data comes the need for automatic (or semi-automatic) analysis methods which aid the physician in the exploration of the data. One specific imaging technique is angiography, in which the blood vessels are imaged using an injected contrast agent which increases the contrast between blood and surrounding tissue. In these images, the blood vessels can be viewed as tubular structures with varying diameters. Deviations from this structure are signs of disease, such as stenoses introducing reduced blood flow, or aneurysms with a risk of rupture. This thesis focuses on segmentation and visualization of blood vessels, constituting the vascular tree, in angiography images. Segmentation is the problem of partitioning an image into separate regions. There is no general segmentation method which achieves good results for all possible applications.
