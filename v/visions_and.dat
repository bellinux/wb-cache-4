40|$|Are {{the words}} 'vision' and 'mission' mere 'fashion words' in modern society? Will these words {{disappear}} {{in years to}} come? The business community considers <b>vision</b> <b>and</b> mission as important 'tools' to pull their organizations forward. It is in these communities that we hear of success stories because of the correct usage of <b>vision</b> <b>and</b> mission statements. There is not always consensus {{on the meaning of}} the words 'vision' and 'mission', but there is consensus that the use of <b>vision</b> <b>and</b> mission contributes to the progress and success of the organization. Business men are focussed on performance <b>and</b> achievement. <b>Vision</b> <b>and</b> mission statements do play an integral role in those achievements. The Bible uses synonymous terms for <b>vision</b> <b>and</b> mission. The words <b>vision</b> <b>and</b> mission (as we understand them today in this context) do not appear in the Bible (in Afrikaans), but words with the same meaning are used. Leaders in religious communities are not always aware of the value of using these tools in the local assembly. Thus, there is a rising awareness of the advantages for the local assembly of using <b>vision</b> <b>and</b> mission statements. Various local assemblies have used them with great success. To ensure that 'vision' and 'mission' do not simply remain fashion words, it is of the utmost importance that religious communities understand, formulate and use them properly. Focussed leaders will accompany local assemblies more effectively. That will result in more success stories in the local assembly. Dr. G. J. Basso...|$|R
