50|$|Several {{synthetic}} compounds bind to, {{but do not}} activate, TP {{and thereby}} inhibit its activation by activating ligands. These receptor antagonists include I-SAP, SQ-29548, S-145, domitroban, and <b>vapiprost,</b> {{all of which have}} affinities for binding TP similar to that of I-BOP. Other notable TP receptor antagonists are Seratrodast (AA-2414), Terutroban (S18886), PTA2, 13-APA, GR-32191, Sulotroban (BM-13177), SQ-29,548, SQ-28,668, ONO-3708, Bay U3405, EP-045, BMS-180,291, and S-145. Many of these TP receptor antagonists have been evaluated as potential therapeutic agents for asthma, thrombosis and hypertension. These evaluations indicate that TP receptor antagonists can be more effective than drugs which selectively block the production of TXA2 thromboxane synthase inhibitors. This seemingly paradoxical result may reflect the ability of PGH2, whose production is not blocked by the inhibitors, to substitute for TXA2 in activating TP. Novel TP receptor antagonists that also have activity in reducing TXA2 production by inhibiting cyclooxygenases have been discovered and are in development for testing in animal models.|$|E
40|$|Microthrombi {{produced}} have {{a potential}} to form larger thrombi, leading to vascular occlusions. Recently, a new device to easily detect microaggregates using laser-light scattering (LS) has been developed. We adopted this device to comparatively evaluate the inhibitory effects of aspirin (1, 3 or 10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1), <b>vapiprost</b> (0. 3, 1 or 3 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) or GR 144053 (0. 1, 0. 3 or 1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) on ex vivo aggregation of hamster platelets {{in relation to}} their in vivo antithrombotic effects. A transluminal thrombus was produced in the hamster femoral artery by the photochemical reaction. Each compound was injected i. v. as a bolus 10 [*]min prior to the reaction, showing a dose-dependent antithrombotic effect, i. e. they prolonged the time before the artery occluded. At that time cyclic flow reductions occurred more marked when aspirin or <b>vapiprost</b> was given. At the end of experiments, blood was collected to evaluate the platelet aggregation using both the new LS device and the conventional optical density (OD) method. Many more small aggregates were still formed when the highest dose of aspirin or <b>vapiprost</b> was used as compared with that of GR 144053, although suppression of the platelet aggregation using the OD method, prolongation of the occlusion time and the bleeding time were quite similar. In conclusion, a GPIIb/IIIa antagonist markedly suppressed the microthrombi and reduced the cyclic flow reduction. This further indicates the importance of small aggregates as triggers of thrombosis and shows that prevention of their formation may result in improved vascular patency after thrombotic insult...|$|E
40|$|Cumulative {{concentration-response}} curves (CRC) to prostaglandin E 1 (PGE 1), PGE 2, PGD 2 and PGF 2 α (0. 01 – 30 [*]μM) {{and to the}} thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2) {{receptor agonist}} U- 46619 (0. 01 – 30 [*]μM) were constructed in human isolated detrusor muscle strips both in basal conditions and during electrical field stimulation. All the agonists tested contracted the detrusor muscle. The rank order of agonist potency was: PGF 2 α>U- 46619 >PGE 2 whereas weak contractile responses were obtained with PGD 2 and PGE 1. Any of the agonists tested was able to induce a clear plateau of response even at 30 [*]μM. The selective TXA 2 antagonist, GR[*] 32191 B (<b>vapiprost),</b> antagonized U- 46619 -induced contractions with an apparent pKB value of 8. 27 ± 0. 12 (n= 4 for each antagonist concentration). GR[*] 32191 B (0. 3 [*]μM) did not antagonize the contractile responses to PGF 2 α {{and it was a}} non-surmountable antagonist of PGE 2 (apparent pKB of 7. 09 ± 0. 04; n= 5). The EP receptor antagonist AH[*] 6809 at 10 [*]μM shifted to the right the CRC to U- 46619 (apparent pKB value of 5. 88 ± 0. 04; n= 4). Electrical field stimulation (20 [*]Hz, 70 [*]V, pulse width 0. 1 [*]ms, trains of 5 [*]s every 60 [*]s) elicited contractions fully sensitive to TTX (0. 3 [*]μM) and atropine (1 [*]μM). U- 46619 (0. 01 – 3 [*]μM) potentiated the twitch contraction in a dose-dependent manner and this effect was competitively antagonized by GR[*] 32191 B with an estimated pKB of 8. 54 ± 0. 14 (n= 4 for each antagonist concentration). PGF 2 α in the range 0. 01 – 10 [*]μM (n= 7), but not PGE 2 and PGE 1 (n= 3 for each), also potentiated the twitch contraction of detrusor muscle strips (23. 5 ± 0. 3 % of KCl 100 [*]mM-induced contraction) but this potentiation was unaffected by 0. 3 [*]μM GR[*] 32191 B (n= 5). Cumulative additions of U- 46619 (0. 01 – 30 [*]μM) were without effect on contractions induced by direct smooth muscle excitation (20 [*]Hz, 40 [*]V, 6 [*]ms pulse width, trains of 2 [*]s every 60 [*]s, in the presence of TTX 1 [*]μM; n= 3). Moreover, pretreatment of the tissue with 0. 3 [*]μM U- 46619 did not potentiate the smooth muscle response to 7 [*]μM bethanecol (n= 2). We concluded that TXA 2 can induce direct contraction of human isolated urinary bladder through the classical TXA 2 receptor. Prostanoid receptors, fully activated by PGE 2 and PGF 2 α are also present. All these receptors are probably located post-junctionally. The rank order of agonist potency and the fact that GR 32191 B, but not AH 6809, antagonized responses to PGE 2 seem to indicate the presence of a new EP receptor subtype. Moreover, we suggest the presence of prejuctional TXA 2 and FP receptors, potentiating acetylcholine release from cholinergic nerve terminals...|$|E
