The operational principle of the pulse power system is that the energy from the input source is {{stored in the capacitor}} bank or superconducting inductive device through a dc-dc converter.

40|$|AbstractThe single sucrose {{gap voltage}} clamp {{technique}} {{has been used}} to study the relation between membrane electrical activity and tension generation in right ventricular papillary muscles from New Zealand White rabbits at various stages of development. In response to voltage clamp-controlled depolarization, muscles from newborn rabbits develop monotonically increasing tension that reaches a steady state level, whereas more mature myocardium responds to similar depolarization by developing an early peak of tension before relaxing to a steady state level. The ratio of early peak or phasic tension to steady state or tonic tension increases significantly with maturation. Calcium (Ca 2 +) loading of immature myocytes enhances phasic tension in a subsequent test depolarization. Although the voltage dependence of tonic tension increases monotonically in all age groups, phasic tension, seen only in the more mature myocardium, displays a “bell-shaped” dependence on <b>voltage.</b> <b>Addition</b> of ryanodine, known to interfere with Ca 2 +release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, markedly reduces the phasic component of tension in mature myocardium, and the voltage clamp-induced tension in the adult closely resembles that of the normal newborn. These results suggest that tension development in immature myocardium is supported largely by the influx of Ca 2 +across the sarcolemma. As the myocardium matures, the sarcoplasmic reticulum plays an increasingly important role in tension generation. A developmental schema is presented to account for the observed malurational changes in excitation-contraction coupling. The clinical implications of these changes are discussed as they relate to the practice of pediatric cardiology...|$|E
40|$|A {{range of}} new {{materials}} for organic {{light emitting diodes}} (OLEDs) synthesised in the Department of Chemistry at Durham University have been characterised and electroluminescent devices containing these materials have been optimised. High triplet oxadiazole based electron transport materials were tested in devices blended with the host material poly(9 -vinylcarbazole) (PVK). The materials exhibit comparable performance to standard OXD- 7 in electrophosphorescent devices, while emission from exciplex devices indicate the new materials have higher LUMO energies than OXD- 7. Single layer devices containing new sky-blue iridium(III) emitters were optimised. The improved solubility of these emitters over FIrpic, the standard sky-blue emitter, resulted in improved device efficiency and brightness due to reduced aggregation, concentration quenching and self absorption in film, and higher radiative yield. Derivatives of these new emitters, with emission shifted towards a deeper blue, were characterised. Increased trapping by the PVK host led to a reduction in the device efficiency for these materials. Two series of iridium(III) emitters with emission tuned from green to red by systematically substituted electron withdrawing or donating groups were characterised. Photophysical properties of these emitters, including the solvatochromic shift of photoluminescence spectra, correlate with theoretical values of the molecular dipole moment, thus linking changes in chemical structure with device performance. Finally, white electroluminescence was demonstrated from single copolymers exhibiting broadened blue-green intramolecular charge transfer emission due to the interaction of fluorene (F) and dibenzothiophene-S,S-dioxide (S) units.
