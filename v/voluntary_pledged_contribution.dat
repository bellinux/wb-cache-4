25|$|Barron says he {{does not}} salute the flag or believe in the Pledge of Allegiance, stating that the pledge's {{assertion}} that there is equality and justice for all is a lie that is not true for African-Americans. In 2004, he strongly objected to a move by the City Council that would begin each meeting with a <b>voluntary</b> <b>Pledge.</b>|$|R

25|$|Scenarios {{assessed}} by Gupta et al. (2007) suggest that Annex I emissions {{would need to}} be 25% to 40% below 1990 levels by 2020, and 80% to 95% below 1990 levels by 2050. The only Annex I Parties to have made <b>voluntary</b> <b>pledges</b> in line with this are Japan (25% below 1990 levels by 2020) and Norway (30-40% below 1990 levels by 2020).|$|R

50|$|A {{wide variety}} of issues have been {{addressed}} during the country reviews and potentially all human rights issues could be addressed during this session. While the counting of {{the actual number of}} recommendations is {{complicated by the fact that}} they are clustered together in the Working Group report, the NGO UPR Info has calculated the first cycle of the UPR to have provided a total of 21,356 recommendations and 599 <b>voluntary</b> <b>pledges.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Republic of South Sudan <b>voluntary</b> <b>pledged</b> in October 2013 for {{candidature}} to the Human Rights Council. It {{stated that}} its interest in joining the Human Rights Council stemmed from “its desire both {{to contribute to}} the promotion of human rights, based on the principles that inspired its liberation struggle, and to take advantage of its membership to enhance its knowledge of international human rights and build its capacity to promote and protect those rights”.|$|R

The Declaration concludes with a <b>voluntary</b> <b>pledge</b> by the Founders as individuals [...] "to each other" [...] of their personal lives, fortunes, and sacred honor.|$|R
25|$|The numbers {{below are}} the <b>pledged</b> <b>contributions.</b> Arguably, only funds that are {{actually}} transferred should be counted. For example, after the Bam earthquake in December 2003, the Iranian government received only US$17.5 million from the US$1 billion of international donations that had been promised.|$|R
2500|$|Carbon dioxide, methane, {{nitrous oxide}} (...) and {{three groups of}} {{fluorinated}} gases (sulfur hexafluoride (...) , hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and perfluorocarbons (PFCs)) are the major anthropogenic greenhouse gases, and are regulated under the Kyoto Protocol international treaty, which came into force in 2005. Emissions limitations specified in the Kyoto Protocol expired in 2012. The Cancún agreement, agreed in 2010, includes <b>voluntary</b> <b>pledges</b> made by 76 countries to control emissions.

50|$|One of the {{hallmarks}} of the congregation is its outreach to a diverse Jewish community, especially its welcoming of the LGBTQ community, interfaith households, and those from many ethnic and cultural backgrounds. Members come from all over Hudson County and beyond. The congregation also adopted an innovative membership program in 2012 called Terumah, which allows households to make an annual <b>voluntary</b> <b>pledge</b> in place of traditional annual does. In 2012 the congregation also made its High Holy Day services equally open to members and non-members without any required donation.|$|R
50|$|The International Energy Agency (IEA) publication, World Energy Outlook 2010, {{contains}} {{a scenario that}} is based on the <b>voluntary</b> <b>pledges</b> made in the Copenhagen Accord.In the IEA scenario, it is assumed that these pledges are acted on cautiously, reflecting their non-binding nature. In the scenario, GHG emission trends follow a path that is consistent with a stabilization of GHGs at 650 parts per million (ppm) CO2-equivalent in the atmosphere. In the long-term, a 650 ppm concentration could lead to global warming of 3.5 °C above the pre-industrial global average temperature level.|$|R
30|$|The main {{difference}} {{would come from}} the comparison with the cost associated to existing pledges. The market would imply a cost reduction of 65 percent {{with respect to the}} <b>voluntary</b> <b>pledges.</b> The reason is that the pledges are very far from the optimal solution implied by the market. In other words, the pledges would be very different from Member States’ true preferences, if the true preferences are correctly reflected in the Eurobarometer survey. The simulation is run under the assumption that countries’ true cost corresponds to these preferences rather than to the revealed ones from Table  1.|$|R

To having a likely chance of meeting the 2 °C objective, assessed studies generally indicated the need for global emissions to peak before 2020, with substantial declines in emissions thereafter.|$|R
2500|$|As {{part of the}} 2010 Cancún agreements, 76 {{developed}} and developing countries have made <b>voluntary</b> <b>pledges</b> to control their emissions of greenhouse gases. [...] These voluntary steps are seen {{by some as a}} new model where countries pledge to voluntarily take action against global warming outside of international treaties or obligations to other parties. [...] This voluntary mechanism, while promising, does not address many of the challenges seen by the developing world in their efforts to mitigate global warming, adapt to global warming, and increasingly to deal with losses and damages that they directly attribute to global warming that they blame on the developed world's historical emissions.|$|R

5000|$|The General Assembly can {{suspend the}} rights and {{privileges}} of any Council member that it decides has persistently committed gross and systematic {{violations of human rights}} during its term of membership. The suspension process requires a two-thirds majority vote by the General Assembly. The resolution establishing the UNHRC states that [...] "when electing members of the Council, Member States shall take into account the contribution of candidates to the promotion and protection of human rights and their <b>voluntary</b> <b>pledges</b> and commitments made thereto", and that [...] "members elected to the Council shall uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights".|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} defray costs, 150 {{members of the}} {{building}} fund committee called at homes of more than 800 families in the parish on February 22, 1953 to solicit <b>pledge</b> <b>contributions.</b> The pool for the drive was set at $50,000. At that time, the parish had a building fund of $200,000 and {{it was estimated that}} the final cost would be $300,000. The new church had a capacity of 550 persons.|$|R
30|$|In 2015, {{world leaders}} {{concluded}} {{an agreement to}} keep the average global temperature increase well below the 2  °C preindustrial levels, with the aim to limit the increase to 1.5  °C. According to the Paris Agreement, all parties have committed to making individual <b>voluntary</b> <b>pledges</b> {{to contribute to the}} global goal. The Paris Agreement came into force on November 4, 2016. The EU {{is one of the biggest}} greenhouse gas (GHG) emitters; however, the situation differs in the 28 member states [1]. The initial commitment of the EU is to reduce GHG emissions at least 40 % (from 1990 levels) by 2030. The EU energy climate policy is considered to be a good example to follow [2, 3].|$|R
25|$|Rejecting an {{outright}} ban, the Health Secretary Andrew Lansley launched on 15 March 2012 a <b>voluntary</b> <b>pledge</b> to remove artificial trans fats {{by the end}} of the year. Asda, Pizza Hut, Burger King, Tesco, Unilever and United Biscuits are some of 73 businesses who have agreed to do so. Lansley and his special Adviser Bill Morgan previously worked for firms with interests in the food industry and some journalists have alleged that this results in a conflict of interest. Many health professionals are not happy with the voluntary nature of the deal. Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, felt that justifying intake on the basis of average figures was unsuitable since some members of the community could considerably exceed this.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} analysts have {{focussed}} {{on the need}} to establish a global price on carbon in order to reduce emissions cost-effectively. The Kyoto treaty does not set a global price for carbon. As stated earlier, the US {{is not part of the}} Kyoto treaty, and is a major contributor to global annual emissions of carbon dioxide (see also greenhouse gas#Regional and national attribution of emissions). Additionally, the treaty does not place caps on emissions in developing countries. The lack of caps for developing countries was based on equity (fairness) considerations (see Kyoto Protocol#Negotiations for more information). Developing countries, however, have undertaken a range of policies to reduce their emissions domestically. The later Cancún agreement, agreed under the UNFCCC, is based on <b>voluntary</b> <b>pledges</b> rather than binding commitments.|$|R
40|$|In 1992 {{the nations}} of the world created the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to {{negotiate}} binding agreements to address the risks of climate change. Nearly every nation on Earth committed to limiting global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to prevent “dangerous anthropogenic interference in the climate system,” [superscript 1] which is generally accepted to mean limiting the increase in mean global surface temperature to 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels. [superscript 2] High hopes were dashed at the 2009 Copenhagen climateconference when face-to-face negotiations among heads of state collapsed. Instead, nations were encouraged to make <b>voluntary</b> <b>pledges</b> to reduce their emissions. Those pledges currently fall significantly short of what is needed (UNEP, 2010) while GHG emissions have risen to record levels despite the great recession that began in 2008...|$|R
50|$|On September 28, 2006, Governor Schwarzenegger {{signed the}} Gwen Araujo Justice for Victims Act, {{a bill that}} affirms {{legislative}} intent stating that use of panic defense by criminal defendants {{to appeal to the}} bias of jurors is against public policy. Also that same day, he signed the Code of Fair Campaign Practices, a bill that includes a <b>voluntary</b> <b>pledge</b> to not use or permit any appeal to negative prejudices based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Also that same day, he signed The Civil Rights Housing Act of 2006, a bill that standardize various housing-related nondiscrimination provisions in California law to make them consistent with the Fair Employment and Housing Act. Also that same day, he vetoed the Safe Place to Learn Act, a bill that would prohibited discrimination and harassment in public schools.|$|R

40|$|In recent years, an {{approach}} based on <b>voluntary</b> <b>pledges</b> by individual regions has attracted interest of policy-makers and consequently also climate policy research. In this paper, we analyze scenarios {{in which the}} EU and China act as early-movers in international climate policy. Such a situation risks leakage between regions with ambitious emission reduction targets and those with less ambitious targets via fossil-fuel markets, displacement of heavy industry and land-use consequences. We examine some of these factors using the IMAGE model. While IMAGE does not include all mechanisms, we find the leakage rate to be relatively small, about 5 % of the emission reductions in the EU and China. The far majority occurs via the energy market channel and the remainder through land-use change. Reduced oil prices due to less depletion forms the key reason for this leakage impact...|$|R
