The method was tested on 12 intermediary products of special vinegars, fruit vinegars and condiments produced from different rawmaterials and procedures. DNAs extraction was performed on pellets by chemical, enzymatic, resinmediated methods and their modifications. Suitable yield and DNA purity were obtained bymodification of a method based {{on the use of}} PVP/CTAB to remove polyphenolic components andesopolysaccharides. By sequencing of bands from DGGE gel, Ga. europaeus, A. malorum/cerevisiae andA. orleanensis were detected as main species in samples having more than 4 % of acetic acid content. From samples having no acetic acid content, sequences retrieved from excised bands revealed highsimilarity with prokaryotes with no function on vinegar fermentation: Burkholderia spp, Cupriavidusspp., Lactococcus lactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides.

40|$|Wine is a {{beverage}} {{that made}} from grape berries. However, without beneficial bacteria, {{we would not}} produce good wine. But very often wines contain acetic acid bacteria, which are undesirable in winemaking process. Acetic acid bacteria as known as a <b>vinegar</b> <b>bacteria</b> are Gram-negative, aerobic, rod-shaped and ubiquitous bacteria. This study was focused on species of acetic acid bacteria, specifically Acetobacter aceti that make spoilage in wine. The aim of our study was the identification of Acetobacter aceti in spoiled red wine samples, with plate dilution method on agar plates and using sensitive Real-time PCR (qPCR) method. We cultivated Acetobacter aceti on GYC agar at 30 °C, 48 h. The one of main objective in the present work was the test fast, sensitive and reliable technique such as quantitative Real-time PCR and detecting the presence of Acetobacter aceti in wine samples with positive Acetobacteraceti control on amplification plot and melting curve. The next objective before  qPCR analysis was DNA extraction from wine samples incubated for one week at 28 °C aerobically. We used five different red wine samples for this experiment: Alibernet 2013, Blaufränkisch  2013, Cabernet Sauvignon 2013, Dunaj 2012 and Saint-Laurent 2012. Next we extracted DNA from wine samples and from pure Acetobacter aceti CCM 3620 T strain purchased from Czech collection of microorganisms in Brno. Susceptibility ofAcetobacter aceti was varied in different isolates from 102 to 107 CFU. mL- 1. The number of Acetobacter cells on GYC medium ranged from 4. 05 to 4. 83 log CFU. mL- 1 in differentwine samples. The higher number of Acetobacter cells (4. 83 log CFU. mL- 1) was found in Cabernet Sauvignon 2013 wine...|$|E

However, the application of selected acetic acid bacteria strains in TBV production has been recently proposed, and a procedure has been developed for the scale-up of the fermentation process at the <b>vinegar</b> factory scale. <b>Bacteria</b> involved in alcoholic dehydrogenation produce {{a wide range of}} compounds other than acetic acid, such as sugar acids and many volatile compounds. So, the chemical composition of TBV, relating to the AAB oxidation products, is highly variable and depends on several factors such as the type of grape must, cooking modality, oxidation temperature, and others. The acetification process and the growth of relevant bacteria are mainly affected by the alcohol, sugar, and acetic acid content.|$|R
40|$|Vinegar is an {{important}} by-product on many Iowa farms, utilizing a considerable part of the apple crop which would otherwise be wasted by spoiling, often on account of difficulty in marketing. The apple crop of Iowa amounts to between three and four million dollars per year and a more efficient home production of vinegar from culls and windfalls {{would result in a}} large saving. Many inquiries are received by the Iowa Agricultural Experiment Station regarding difficulties or failure in vinegar making. In many cases the vinegar never reaches the legal standard of strength for marketable vinegar, which is 4 percent of acetic acid. This is gene rally due to contamination of the fermenting <b>vinegar</b> with <b>bacteria</b> or other micro-organisms which cause what are called 2 ̆ 2 foreign” or unfavorable fermentations, thus changing the sugars to something else than the acetic acid which is desired. These contaminating bacteria also sometimes impart an unfavorable or disagreeable flavor to the vinegar, as well as preventing the development of the proper amount of acidity, which is necessary for proper preservation as well as to meet the legal standard if the vinegar is to be offered for sale. In a few cases the low acidity produced is due to the use of apples too low in sugar content, or to dilution of the cider with water. The cause and prevention of these difficulties is to be discussed in this bulletin...|$|R
40|$|Vinegar {{production}} as well other fermented foods and beverages {{is based on}} the use of starter cultures which permit a higher degree of control and standardisation of the final product compared to spontaneous fermentation. The first task to optimise fermented foods process is the knowledge of microorganism physiological and metabolic traits. Acetic acid bacteria species occurring in vinegar production are well known, but species monitoring and strains selection are not common procedures. Then there are not extensive studies on significant traits of strains involved in vinegar oxidation process. Concerning to traditional balsamic vinegars few researches are available about occurring species and their physiological traits. In this study strains isolated from traditional balsamic vinegar samples were investigated by enzymatic digestion of ITS 1 regions using RsaI and HaeIII restriction endonucleases and by sequencing of 16 S rDNA and ITS 1 rDNA. Since elevated sugar concentration resistance and growing is an important trait for traditional balsamic <b>vinegar</b> acetic acid <b>bacteria,</b> the isolated strains were tested for glucose tolerance. On the basis of technological results glucose concentration is an acetic acid bacteria limiting-factor and Acetobacter malorum species is more resistant to high glucose concentration than other species occurred in balsamic vinegar.

40|$|Namen diplomskega dela je bil opisati lastnosti ocetnokislinskih bakterij ter mikrobno združbo v jabolčnem in balzamičnem kisu. Kis je razredčena raztopina ocetne kisline, ki nastane po biološkem postopku z zaporednima fermentacijama. Najprej poteče alkoholna fermentacija, pri kateri kvasovke pretvorijo fermentativne sladkorje v etanol, zatem pa še ocetnokislinska fermentacija, kjer ocetnokislinske bakterije iz etanola proizvedejo ocetno kislino. Poglaviten pomen v proizvodnem procesu in posledično pri senzoričnih lastnostih kisa ima sestava mikrobne združbe. V jabolčnem in balzamičnem kisu prevladujejo ocetnokislinske bakterije. Mikrobno združbo jabolčnega kisa v največji meri sestavljajo bakterije vrst Acetobacter pasteurianus, Komagataeibacter oboedinens in K. saccharivorans, medtem ko so v balzamičnem kisu najpogosteje prisotne bakterije vrst Gluconobacter europaeus, A. pasteurianus in A. malorum. Poleg ocetnokislinskih bakterij so v kisu prisotne tudi kvasovke in mlečnokislinske bakterije. V jabolčnem kisu so najpogosteje prisotne kvasovke vrst Saccharomyces ludwigii, S. cerevisiae, Candida ethanolica in Pichia membranifaciens ter mlečnokislinske bakterije rodov Lactobacillus in Oenococcus. V balzamičnem kisu se pojavljajo kvasovke vrst C. lactis-condensi, C. stellata, Zygosaccharomyces bailii, Z. pseudorouxii, Z. mellis, Z. bisporus, Z. rouxii in S. cerevisiae. The aim of {{the thesis}} was to present the {{properties}} of acetic acid bacteria and microbial community in apple and balsamic vinegar. Vinegar is a solution of acetic acid that is processed through completion of sequential fermentations. Firstly, in alcoholic fermentation yeasts convert fermentative sugars to ethanol, followed by acetic acid fermentation, where the acetic acid is produced from ethanol by acetic acid bacteria. The diversity of acetic acid bacteria has significant affect in the production process and consequently also on sensory properties of the <b>vinegar.</b> Acetic acid <b>bacteria</b> predominate in both vinegars. The microbial community of apple cider is mostly made up of species Acetobacter pasteurianus, Komagataeibacter oboedinens, and K. saccharivorans, while species Gluconobacter europaeus, A. pasteurianus and A. malorum are most frequently present in balsamic vinegar. Besides acetic acid <b>bacteria</b> in <b>vinegar,</b> there are also found yeast and lactic acid bacteria. The most frequently present yeasts species in apple vinegar are Saccharomyces ludwigii, S. cerevisiae, Candida ethanolica and Pichia Membranifaciens, while the most frequently lactic acid bacteria genus present are Oenococcus and Lactobacillus. In balsamic vinegar appear yeast species C. lactis-condensi, C. stellata, Zygosaccharomyces bailii, Z. pseudorouxii, Z. mellis, Z. bisporus, Z. rouxii and S. cerevisiae...|$|R
