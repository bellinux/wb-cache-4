50|$|Roll rate is {{analogous}} to a vehicle's ride rate, but for actions that include lateral accelerations, causing a <b>vehicle's</b> <b>sprung</b> mass to roll about its roll axis. It is expressed as torque per degree of roll of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>sprung</b> mass. It is influenced by factors including {{but not limited to}} <b>vehicle</b> <b>sprung</b> mass, track width, CG height, spring and damper rates, roll center heights of front and rear, anti-roll bar stiffness and tire pressure/construction. The roll rate of a vehicle can, and usually does, differ front to rear, which allows for the tuning ability of a vehicle for transient and steady state handling. The roll rate of a vehicle does not change the total amount of weight transfer on the vehicle, but shifts the speed at which and percentage of weight transferred on a particular axle to another axle through the vehicle chassis. Generally, the higher the roll rate on an axle of a vehicle, the faster and higher percentage the weight transfer on that axle.|$|R

50|$|Sprung weight {{transfer}} is the {{weight transfer}}red by only {{the weight of}} the vehicle resting on the springs, not the total vehicle weight. Calculating this requires knowing the <b>vehicle's</b> <b>sprung</b> weight (total weight less the unsprung weight), the front and rear roll center heights and the sprung center of gravity height (used to calculate the roll moment arm length). Calculating the front and rear sprung weight transfer will also require knowing the roll couple percentage.|$|R
50|$|In {{a vehicle}} suspension, roll moment {{is the moment}} of inertia of the <b>vehicle's</b> <b>sprung</b> mass (the portion of its weight {{supported}} by the suspension). The roll moment {{is the product of}} the sprung mass and the square of the distance between the vehicle's roll center and its center of mass. If the vehicle is subjected to centrifugal forces, such as in a turn, the roll moment will cause the body to rotate (lean) towards the outside of the turn.|$|R

40|$|This study aims to {{evaluate}} the use of mathematical optimisation algorithms for the optimisation of a <b>vehicle’s</b> <b>spring</b> and damper characteristics, with respect to ride comfort and handling. Traditionally the design of a <b>vehicle’s</b> suspension <b>spring</b> and damper characteristics are determined by a few simple planar model calculations, followed by extensive trial-and-error simulation or track testing. With the current advanced multi-body dynamics computer software packages available to the design engineer, the integration of traditional mathematical optimisation techniques with these packages, can lead to much faster product development. This, in turn results in a reduction of development costs. A sports utility vehicle is modelled by means of a general-purpose computer programme for the dynamic analysis of a multi-body mechanical system. This model is validated against measurements from road tests. The mathematical model is coupled to two gradient-based mathematical optimisation algorithms. The performance of the recently proposed Dynamic-Q optimisation algorithm, is compared with that of the industry-standard gradient based Sequential Quadratic Programming method. The use of different finite difference approximations for the gradient vector evaluation is also investigated. The results {{of this study indicate that}} gradient-based mathematical optimisation methods may indeed be successfully integrated with a multi-body dynamics analysis computer program for the optimisation of a vehicle’s suspension system.

40|$|Steering and braking {{control is}} applied to avoid {{rollover}} of road vehicles. The control concept presented is composed of three feedback loops: Continuous operation steering control, emergency steering control and emergency braking control. In continuous operation the roll rate and the roll acceleration are fed back by velocity scheduled gains to {{the front wheel steering}} angle. Thereby, the vehicle's roll damping is robustly improved {{for a wide range of}} speed and height of the center of gravity. The latter may change for example with a truck from ride to ride. A rollover coe #cient is defined that basically depends on the lateral acceleration at the center of gravity of the <b>vehicle's</b> <b>sprung</b> mass. For critical values of this variable the emergency steering and braking system is activated. The rollover coe #cient is also used for nonlinear feedback to the front wheel steering angle.

40|$|Heavy {{off-road}} vehicle suspension systems face unique challenges. The ride comfort versus handling compromise in these vehicles has been frequently investigated using mathematical optimisation. Further challenges exist {{due to the}} large variations in <b>vehicle</b> <b>sprung</b> mass. A passive suspension system can only provide optimal isolation at a single payload. The designer of such a suspension system must therefore make a compromise between designing for a fully-laden or unladen payload state. This work deals with suspension optimisation for vehicle structural life. The paper mainly addresses two questions: (1) What are the suspension characteristics required to ensure optimal isolation of the vehicle structure from road loads? and (2) If such optimal suspension characteristics can be found, how sensitive are they to changes in vehicle payload? The study aims {{to answer these questions}} by examining a Land Rover Defender 110 as test vehicle. An experimentally validated non-linear seven degree-of-freedom mathematical model of the test vehicle is constructed for the use in sensitivity studies. Mathematical optimisation is performed using the model in order to find the suspension characteristics for optimal structural life for the vehicle under consideration. Sensitivity studies are conducted to determine the robustness of the optimal characteristics and their sensitivity to vehicle payload variation. Recommendations are made for suspension characteristic selection for optimal structural life. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|A {{periodic}} {{monitoring of}} the pavement condition facilitates a cost-effective distribution of the resources available for maintenance of the road infrastructure network. The task can be accurately carried out using profilometers, but such an approach is generally expensive. This paper presents a method to collect information on the road profile via accelerometers mounted in a fleet of non-specialist vehicles, such as police cars, that are in use for other purposes. It proposes an optimisation algorithm, based on Cross Entropy theory, to predict road irregularities. The Cross Entropy algorithm estimates {{the height of the}} road irregularities from vehicle accelerations at each point in time. To test the algorithm, the crossing of a half-car roll model is simulated over a range of road profiles to obtain accelerations of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>sprung</b> and unsprung masses. Then, the simulated vehicle accelerations are used as input in an iterative procedure that searches for the best solution to the inverse problem of finding road irregularities. In each iteration, a sample of road profiles is generated and an objective function defined as the sum of squares of differences between the ‘measured’ and predicted accelerations is minimized until convergence is reached. The reconstructed profile is classified according to ISO and IRI recommendations and compared to its original class. Results demonstrate that the approach is feasible and that a good estimate of the short-wavelength features of the road profile can be detected, despite the variability between the vehicles used to collect the data...|$|R

ER damper and MR damper have gained wide spread attention in academia as well in auto industries due to their attractive features and promising performance potential to overcome the limitations of existing dampers in market. This work presents a comprehensive study of four different suspension dampers, where each are modeled, validated and assigned a set of parameters to facilitate a comparison of performance. The dampers considered include linear passive damper, two-stage asymmetric non-linear damper, ER damper and MR damper. The vibration and shock isolation performance of the dampers are compared using a four degree-of-freedom pitch plane ride model. A wide range of performance measure is considered in this investigation, namely [...] sprung and unsprung mass responses, relative motions, drift, pavement load etc. The study reveals superior vibration and shock isolation performance of ER damper and MR damper for <b>vehicle</b> <b>sprung</b> mass compared to linear passive damper and asymmetric non-linear damper. Since the dampers are designed as symmetric in compression and rebound, they are immune from ride height drifting problem. At higher frequencies (above 10 Hz), the dampers transmit higher load to pavement compared to other two. The study suggests that asymmetricity {{should be included in the}} design of these dampers to achieve improved performance over the entire frequency range.
