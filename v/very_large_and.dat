5|$|Although lithium {{is widely}} {{distributed}} on Earth, {{it does not}} naturally occur in elemental form due to its high reactivity. The total lithium content of seawater is <b>very</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> is estimated as 230 billion tonnes, where the element exists at a relatively constant concentration of 0.14 to 0.25 parts per million (ppm), or 25 micromolar; higher concentrations approaching 7 ppm are found near hydrothermal vents.|$|E

5|$|The 27th Infantry Division Savska was an {{infantry}} {{formation of}} the Royal Yugoslav Army that formed part of the Yugoslav 4th Army during the German-led Axis invasion of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in April 1941. It was raised from the Savska military district, and was a <b>very</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> unwieldy formation which was almost entirely reliant on animal transport for mobility. Largely manned by Croat troops, many of whom saw the Germans as potential liberators from Serbian oppression during the interwar period, the division also lacked modern arms and sufficient ammunition.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Gilda in 1973 was {{the first}} {{documented}} tropical cyclone on record to transition into a subtropical cyclone. It formed on October16 in the western Caribbean Sea from a tropical wave, and strengthened to reach peak winds of 70mph (110km/h) before striking Cuba. It later moved slowly through the Bahamas before weakening to tropical depression status. On October24, {{with the assistance of}} a cold front off the coast of the eastern United States, Gilda transformed into a subtropical storm, becoming <b>very</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> strong. The storm later accelerated northeastward and became extratropical, ultimately dissipating near Greenland.|$|E

5|$|A {{high risk}} day {{indicates}} a considerable likelihood of significant to extreme severe weather, generally a major tornado outbreak or (much less often) an extreme derecho event. On these days, the potential exists for extremely severe and life-threatening weather, including widespread strong or violent tornadoes – {{some of which}} may be on the ground for a half-hour or longer – and/or very destructive straight-line winds (hail cannot verify or produce a high risk on its own, although such a day usually involves a threat for widespread <b>very</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> damaging hail as well). Many of the most prolific severe weather days were high risk days. Such days are rare; a high risk is typically issued (at the most) only a few times each year (see List of Storm Prediction Center high risk days). High risk areas are usually surrounded by a larger moderate risk area, where uncertainty is greater or the threat is somewhat lower.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} Archbishop of Canterbury in 668, Theodore of Tarsus {{resolved the}} situation by deposing Ceadda and restoring Wilfrid as the Bishop of Northumbria. For the next nine years Wilfrid discharged his episcopal duties, founded monasteries, built churches, and improved the liturgy. However his diocese was <b>very</b> <b>large,</b> <b>and</b> Theodore wished to reform the English Church, a process which included breaking {{up some of the}} larger dioceses into smaller ones. When Wilfrid quarrelled with Ecgfrith, the Northumbrian king, Theodore took the opportunity to implement his reforms despite Wilfrid's objections. After Ecgfrith expelled him from York, Wilfrid travelled to Rome to appeal to the papacy. Pope Agatho ruled in Wilfrid's favour, but Ecgfrith refused to honour the papal decree and instead imprisoned Wilfrid on his return to Northumbria before exiling him.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} extratropical, Charley re-intensified under baroclinic instability. The resulting {{storm was}} a <b>very</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> fairly strong gale that gradually {{moved across the}} northern Atlantic Ocean. As an extratropical cyclone, Charley attained an atmospheric pressure of 980 mbar, which was lower than its pressure as a tropical cyclone. On August 24, it spawned a separate extratropical cyclone, which initially moved northeastward before turning and dissipating near Spain. The remnants of Charley accelerated as it approached the British Isles, and after passing south of Ireland it moved across Great Britain on August 27. While in the North Sea, the cyclone weakened as it executed a counter-clockwise loop, and on August 30 the remnants of Charley dissipated near Denmark as a new circulation developed to its southwest.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Alex {{was a rare}} June {{hurricane}} and {{the first}} tropical cyclone to develop in the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season. Originating from an area of disturbed weather on June25, 2010, it slowly developed in the western Caribbean Sea and struck Belize as a strong tropical storm. After entering the Gulf of Mexico, Alex became <b>very</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> encountered conditions favorable for gradual development. Early on June30, the cyclone attained hurricane status as it approached northeastern Mexico, the first June hurricane in the Atlantic basin since Hurricane Allison in 1995, and the storm rapidly intensified just {{off the coast of}} Tamaulipas. Alex came ashore near Soto la Marina as a Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.|$|E
5|$|On the mandible, the {{diastema}} is <b>very</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> the incisor is procumbent (projecting forward), which distinguishes Apeomyoides {{from most}} eomyids apart from Megapeomys. There is a masseteric scar (associated with the jaw muscles) from below the m1 {{forward to a}} point in front of p4, below the mental foramen, {{an opening in the}} jawbone. In Apeomys and Megapeomys this scar only reaches {{to the level of the}} front root of p4. The mental foramen is very small and opens in the diastema, near the ventral shelf of the scar; in Apeomys and Megapeomys it is located near the dorsal shelf. Further foramina are present on the lingual (inner) surface of the bone, below the cheekteeth.|$|E
5|$|Rowley also {{seized the}} East Indiamen Streatham and Europe and {{restored}} their previous captains and crews, {{who had been}} released {{as part of the}} truce. A number of smaller merchant ships were captured and all were refitted for the journey to Britain, to be convoyed there by the newly captured Caroline. This 40-gun frigate, only three years old and <b>very</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> powerfully built, was given to Corbett in recognition of his services in the operation and renamed HMS Bourbonaise, reflecting the British name for Île Bonaparte, Île Bourbon. Willoughby was promoted to post captain and immediately took command of Corbett's former ship Nereide. Late on 28September, Rowley led his force to sea from Saint-Paul having burnt or seized all government shipping, stores and buildings in the town and surrounding areas.|$|E

5|$|Since it {{is easier}} for a snake's tongue to fulfill its {{olfactory}} function under water, its action is short compared to that of terrestrial snake species. Only the forked tips protrude from the mouth through a divided notch {{in the middle of the}} rostral scale. The nostrils have valves consisting of a specialized spongy tissue to exclude water, and the windpipe can be drawn up to where the short nasal passage opens into the roof of the mouth. This is an important adaptation for an animal that must surface to breathe, but may have its head partially submerged when doing so. The lung has become <b>very</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> extends almost the entire length of the body, although the rear portion is thought to have developed to aid buoyancy rather than to exchange gases. The extended lung possibly also serves to store air for dives.|$|E
5|$|The US {{plan had}} been delayed by the wartime {{need to build}} smaller vessels. Nevertheless, {{estimates}} by the Admiralty were that by the early 1920s the Royal Navy would be behind in ships. By the beginning of 1920, the Americans had completed one battleship {{since the end of}} World War I and had five more building. Seven more were intended to be laid down in 1920–21, six of these were the <b>very</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> powerful , armed with twelve 16-inch guns. The Japanese had finished one battleship {{since the end of the}} war and had three more under construction. To correct this state of affairs, the Admiralty initially planned to build three battleships and one battlecruiser in Fiscal Year (FY) 1921–22 and again in FY 1922–23, but this was changed to four s to be built first, presumably to be followed by the same number of battleships the following year.|$|E
