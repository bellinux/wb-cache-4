40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{whether the}} effect of <b>voice</b> on procedural fairness {{is due to the}} opportunity to <b>voice</b> or to actual <b>voice</b> behavior.

In a laboratory experiment, 100 undergraduates completed measures of personality, self-evaluation, perceived <b>voice</b> instrumentality and opportunity to <b>voice.</b> Opportunity for <b>voice,</b> goal setting, and <b>voice</b> instrumentality were manipulated. The results show that opportunity to <b>voice,</b> but not <b>voice</b> behavior, predicted fairness perceptions. Further, goal setting, perceived instrumentality, conscientiousness, and <b>voice</b> self-efficacy significantly predicted <b>voice</b> behavior. Significant interactions between locus of control and <b>voice</b> instrumentality and goal setting and perceived instrumentality on <b>voice</b> behavior were detected. The implications of these findings and directions for future research are discussed...|$|R

50|$|The end of {{the pipe}} {{opposite}} the mouth may be either open or closed (also known as Gedackt or stopped). A closed pipe sounds an octave lower than an open pipe of the same length. Also, an open pipe produces a tone in which both the even-numbered and the odd-numbered partials are present, while a stopped pipe produces a tone with odd-numbered partials. The tone of a stopped pipe tends to be gentler and sweeter than that of an open pipe, though this is largely {{at the discretion of}} the <b>voicer.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Vox humana {{stops in}} very old organs had a fairly {{wide variety of}} designs and tonal qualities. It was {{during the nineteenth century}} that the design became fairly standardized.

The actual sound of the pipe is dependent upon the <b>voicer,</b> with an open [...] "O" [...] or a long [...] "E" [...] sound probably being the most common result.|$|E

50|$|The end of {{the pipe}} {{opposite}} the reed or mouth may be either open or closed (also known as stopped). A closed flue pipe with a uniform cross-section sounds an octave lower than a similar open pipe of the same length. Also, such an open pipe produces a tone in which both the even-numbered and the odd-numbered partials are present, while a stopped pipe, such as a gedackt, produces a tone with odd-numbered partials. The tone of a stopped pipe tends to be gentler and sweeter than that of an open pipe, though this is largely {{at the discretion of}} the <b>voicer.</b>|$|E
50|$|From {{the postwar}} era to the 1970s, while the various neoclassical tonal {{movements}} threw the domestic organ building world into upheaval, the Odells labored in relative obscurity. In 1979 firm Director William H. Odell (son of Caleb H.) died, the result of major coronary failure. As manager and sole remaining <b>voicer</b> of the firm, William's death seriously diminished the abilities of the firm. In order to meet commitments to existing clients, the workload was distributed to third party contractors, some of whom tragically used the opportunity to further their own businesses, as well as help themselves to company resources, occasionally without compensation to the firm.|$|E
