50|$|The Guinea baboons have {{a host of}} vocal, visual, and tactile communications. Their several <b>vocal</b> <b>calls</b> each convey {{different}} messages, and {{consist of}} predator warnings, signaling friendly intentions, submissive calls, and frustration vocalizations. Many of these calls {{can be used in}} combination with either each other or with some other form of visual or tactile communication. Visual communications serve many of the same purposes as the <b>vocal</b> <b>calls,</b> and are often accompanied by some sort of <b>vocal</b> <b>call.</b> Tactile communication is usually tied to visual communication and can range from mouth-to-mouth touching to biting or slapping.|$|R

In this paper, LPC based synthesis approach has been successfully used for the <b>vocal</b> <b>calls</b> of Alexandrine parakeet (Psittacula Eupatria) by estimating different speech parameters. The quality of synthesized speech output has been evaluated using visual analysis of spectrograms, subjective and objective assessment methods keeping in view different MOS and PESQ scores. In order to measure the quality of synthesized output, MOS and PESQ scores should be compared to identify the required quality level.

40|$|Abstract — Speech {{analysis}} {{is one of}} the interesting analytical approaches in the areas of digital signal processing and it has been explored for various research applications including modeling of speech signals, phonetics research, understanding the speech production mechanism, speech coding and speech recognition processes, etc. Birds are completely dependent on their vocal signals in order to fulfill their survival requirements like nesting, food, protection from any threat or danger and other mutual communicating activities, etc. Birds communicate with their vocal signals because they have a greater range of sounds than humans. Moreover, bird’s calls contain a lot of useful information, but it cannot be easily recognized by human ear as time and frequency resolution of our auditory system is limited. The basic mechanism of sound production in birds is almost similar to that of humans in many contexts. LPC model has been used as an efficient speech model for the analysis of human voice. So, it may be used for the analysis of bird’s <b>vocal</b> <b>calls.</b> This paper examines an investigating method for exploring the application of phonetics research on parrot’s <b>vocal</b> <b>calls.</b> LPC based analysis approach has been applied on the <b>vocal</b> <b>calls</b> of Alexandrine Parakeet (Psittacula Eupatria) and African Grey (Psittacus Erithacus) species of parrots and investigations have been successfully carried out for comparing the number of phonemes in the calls of both the species using line spectral frequencies (LSF) vectors and Euclidean distances. Line spectral frequencies can be used to encode speech spectral information more efficiently than other transmission parameters. A classical method, known as vector quantization has also used for performing efficient speech analysis...|$|R
