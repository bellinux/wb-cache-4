40|$|Abstract. <b>Variable</b> <b>nozzle</b> <b>turbine</b> (VNT) {{has become}} a popular {{technology}} for diesel application. While {{one of the major}} challenges for VNT is resonant vibration due to the fluctuating pressure in unsteady flow. Both the leakage flow forms inside the nozzle clearances and the shock produces under small nozzle openings increase the flow unsteadiness inside downstream rotor tunnel. In this paper, the unsteady simulation of the turbine was conducted to investigate the effects of nozzle clearances and openings on the transient load fluctuation of the blades. Then a finite element model of turbine wheel was built and blade forced response was simulated with harmonic analysis. The results showed that the decrease of nozzle opening would intensify rotor vibration and increase the blade dynamic stress. The simulation of blade resonance showed that the 1 st order resonance located at the blade trailing edge while the 2 nd order resonance happened at the leading edge, which was consistent with the blade actual crack...|$|E

40|$|Reduction of NOx {{emissions}} and fuel consumption {{are the main}} topics in engine development, forcing the adoption of complex techniques and components, whose interactions have to be clearly understood for proper and reliable operations {{and management of the}} whole system. The investigation presented in this paper aimed at the development of integrated control strategies of turbocharging, high pressure (HP) and low pressure (LP) exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) systems for better NOx {{emissions and}} fuel consumption, while analyzing their reciprocal influence and the resulting variations of engine quantities. The study was based on an extended experimental program in three part load engine operating conditions.

40|$|At present, the {{application}} of turbocharging in compression ignition (CI) engines represents almost all of {{the application}}s, especially for transportation where fuel efficiency and low emissions are the main targets. Following this approach, the possibility to couple an electric drive to the turbocharger (electric turbo compound, ETC) to recover the residual energy of the exhaust gases {{is becoming more and more}} attractive, as demonstrated by several studies around the world. The present paper shows the first numerical results of a research program under way which is focused on the comparison of the benefits resulting from {{the application of}} two ETC configurations to a four cylinders CI engine (1561 cm 3). In the first configuration, called single-ETC, a variable geometry turbocharger (VGT) is coupled to an electric generator (mechanic connection); in the second, called dual ETC, the two turbomachines (the <b>variable</b> <b>nozzle</b> <b>turbine</b> and the compressor) are separated and each one is coupled to its own electric machine. Starting from the experimental maps of the turbine and compressor, the complete engine model was created using the AVL BOOST one-dimension code. Compared with the no-ETC engine, the adoption of the single-ETC shows interesting benefits in term of energy recovery at the highest engine speeds and loads, with consequent decrease of fuel consumption. Dual ETC allows the operation of turbine and compressor at different speeds with further reduction of the total brake specific fuel consumption...|$|E
40|$|Different {{systems for}} {{achieving}} short-route cooled EGR on turbocharged and aftercooled heavy-duty diesel engines {{have been tested}} on a 12 litre 315 kW engine with 4 valves per cylinder and an electronically controlled unit pump fuel injection system. In all of these systems the exhaust gas was tapped off before the turbine, cooled and mixed with the intake air after the compressor and aftercooler. The systems differed (mainly) in the method used {{to set up a}} positive pressure difference across the EGR circuit. This was done either by the use of an exhaust back pressure valve in the exhaust, or by using a turbocharger with <b>variable</b> <b>nozzle</b> <b>turbine</b> (VNT) geometry, or by combining such a VNT turbocharger with a venturi-mixer that was positioned in the intake manifold such as to provide extra suction power to the EGR gas. The emissions behaviour and efficiency with these different EGR systems were tested in a number of engine working points, including key points of the AVL 8 -mode US FTP cycle simulation. The results indicate that for achieving 1998 emission levels, a VNT only would be the most efficient solution. For achieving 2004 emission levels, combining the VNT with a venturi-mixer could give a further fuel consumption benefit. Particulate matter emisisons will however be unacceptable, making the use of additional particulate reducing technology necessary. A measure of venturi-mixer effienciency is proposed and a new, compact and efficient venturi-mixer design is presented. Results from flow tests are given and compared with results from CFD calculations...|$|E

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The diesel engine currently accounts for 32 per cent of the new passenger car sales in Europe. In the US, diesel-power is responsible for 94 per cent of all freight movement. Comparing European Stage III standard petrol and diesel passenger car emissions, diesel NOx emissions are still considered a concern. This thesis investigates the mechanisms by which oxides of nitrogen are formed during diesel combustion. It reviews the current methods of controlling NOx emissions, such as retarding fuel injection timing, exhaust gas re-circulation (EGR), water injection and exhaust after-treatment. Modelling using a phenomenological model, is used to demonstrate the extended Zeldovich mechanism and formation trends, the effects of EGR and {{the significance of the}} Zeldovich mechanism rate constants. Modified Zeldovich rate constants are proposed to improve the correlation to measured data. Clearly, EGR is currently the most effective method of reducing NOx emissions from passenger car diesel engines. The way EGR works in suppressing NOx formation is reviewed in detail. Experimentation on a 1. 8 litre inline 4 -cylinder 4 -valve per cylinder DI diesel with a <b>variable</b> <b>nozzle</b> <b>turbine</b> (VNT) turbocharger was used to demonstrate the concept of "additional" EGR on this small automotive engine. "Additional" EGR is the concept whereby a proportion of the EGR is added to the total charge, so that the volumetric efficiency increases as EGR is introduced. By using "additional" EGR, the benefits of lower NOx emissions combined with reduced particulates emissions and improved fuel consumption were clearly demonstrated at two test conditions. The reasons for achieving lower NOx emissions when using a VNT turbocharger and EGR have been explained. Finally, several methods of calculating EGR proportion were used and compared against true mass flow. The use of a CO 2 balance was found to be the most accurate method. This study is funded by the Ford Motor Company...|$|E
40|$|Two of {{the most}} {{pressing}} challenges of the automotive sector are reduction of fuel consumption and corresponding emission of greenhouse gases, especially when {{taking into account the}} growing degree of luxury in modern passenger cars, which increases the auxiliary load on the engine. Preferably, this increase in auxiliary load is compensated by the recovery of waste energy. To accomplish this, a technology called WEDACS (Waste Energy Driven Air Conditioning System) is being developed to recover throttling losses. WEDACS uses a turbine to induce provide the engine with the same air mass flow rate as a throttle valve while producing mechanical energy and cold air. An alternator coupled to this turbine converts mechanical energy into electrical energy and the cold air is used to cool A/C fluid. This way the load of both the engine mounted alternator and A/C compressor is reduced or eliminated, resulting in higher efficiency. A previous paper [1] provides a proof of principle, using a turbine from a turbocharger, but also discusses a challenge {{in the form of a}} limited operating range). The present paper focuses on addressing this challenge. To expand the control range of the engine, a turbocharger with <b>variable</b> <b>nozzle</b> <b>turbine</b> is used. Due to limitations in the variable nozzle mechanism, the range is limited to higher engine powers. It is shown that between 50 W and 1. 3 kW of energy can be recovered from a 2 liter engine, depending on the operating point. A second turbocharger's variable nozzle mechanism is adapted to enable control of a 2 liter engine from idle to about 50 % engine power. With decreasing engine power, the energy recovery efficiency eventually drops to zero. The root cause for this is identified and an attempt is made to improve efficiency. Finally the drive cycle model from the previous paper is expanded and a new drive cycle simulation shows a fuel consumption improvement over the NEDC of about 5 to 8 % for a mid-sized passenger car with a 2 liter engine...|$|E
40|$|The growing global {{call for}} reduced {{emissions}} and fuel consumption {{together with the}} market call for engines with higher power density and application-oriented torque curves can be met using turbochargers with variable geometry turbines (VGT). The second generation of VGT turbochargers is currently being developed and is starting {{to appear on the}} market. The most common solution is using of pivoted vanes forming a <b>variable</b> <b>nozzle</b> <b>turbine</b> (VNT). The adaptation of VGT turbochargers imposes new and different demands {{when it comes to the}} adaptation to the engine system as compared with conventional turbochargers. A conventional turbocharger has a fixed operating point at every combination of speed and load. The operating line is then given by the system into which the turbocharger is incorporated. In the case of a VNT, the operating line can be determined within certain limits by different guide vane openings. Using a VNT unit, it is possible to control the air to fuel ratio and turbocharger pressure conditions for a fixed operation point within certain limits. When integrated with the engine fuel control system, the new technology offers new opportunities to improve starting capabilities, steady state torque, transient response and change the soot/NOx relation over the load range. There is also a real potential to reduce the specific fuel consumption. In this work a VNT system was tested under both steady state and transient conditions. The transient test includes load acceptance and acceleration in an engine test cell. The latter follows the propeller law and includes acceleration from idling and from low cruising load. A test in a marine craft was performed as well. The aim of this test was to evaluate and improve the electronic control system for the turbocharger during transient operation. The influence of vane clearance and the position of the vanes on turbine performance under different conditions are evaluated. The main aim and purpose of the work is to provide a comprehensive study of the interaction between the engine and the improved charging system in order to visualise and summarise the benefits of the VNT system.
