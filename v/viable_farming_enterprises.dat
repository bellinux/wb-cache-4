Spatial data maybe required to effectively answer these questions and does provide unparalleled insights into what lies beneath the ground.

A survey of 220 individual farms and farm cooperatives engaged in the cultivation of peanuts was conducted during 2000 and 2002. Poor farm structure, low level of technology, and nonconformity to farm decision making impede the financial and economic development of Bulgarian peanut production and farm growth, thus limiting <b>farm</b> <b>enterprises</b> emergence into competitive economic units financially operative in a freemarket economy. The underlying cost structure, couple with small farms, averaging 0. 8 ha in size, prevent farmers from capturing economies of scale, limit farm profitability and hence farm modernization.

40|$|There is {{consensus}} that the redistribution of agricultural land to disadvantaged communities in South Africa is slow {{in spite of its}} urgency. The latest South African Government’s approach, Land Redistribution for Agricultural Development (LRAD), has had a slow start but its delivery seems to be improving. One of the criticisms of the LRAD programme is that disadvantage farmers with no own contribution receives only R 20 000 (US $ 1 =R 6. 92 in November 2003) which is not sufficient to purchase a <b>viable</b> <b>farming</b> <b>enterprise.</b> This limitation of the program can, however, be partly overcome by coupling LRAD with the subsidy program of the Land and Agricultural Bank of South Africa. In this contribution the current financing programs of purchasing land are evaluated in terms of how they cater for cash flow of the recipients. It is also suggested that the Government LRAD programme (based on grants), should be complemented by a further programme which is based on a declining interest rate subsidy for disadvantage farmers. Under this program disadvantaged farmers will be able to purchase land with no collateral. The declining subsidy approach, outlined in an earlier paper (Nieuwoudt et al., 1993; Nieuwoudt and Vink, 1995), will be revisited as this concept has been successfully adapted by sugar millers in KwaZulu-Nata...|$|R

Tulokset vuodelta 1996 perustuvat 40 sellaisen maatilan kirjanpitoon, joilla on maatalouden ohella myös yhtä tai useampaa muuta yritystoimintaa. Nämä tilat ovat maatiloina yleensä pienehköjä. Pääasialliset muut toimialat olivat koneurakointi, elintarvikkeiden jatkojalostus, puun jatkojalostus ja maatilamatkailu. Nettotuloksella mitattuna parhaiten näytti kannattavan puun jatkojalostus. Monialaisten maatilayritysten talousseuranta on toistaiseksi ollut kovin vähäistä.

This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with pluriactive <b>farm</b> <b>enterprises,</b> i. e. <b>farms</b> practising other entrepreneurial activities besides traditional agricultural production, and the benefits obtained from such pluriactivities. The objective {{is to find out}} whether pluriactivity has improved the profitability of the <b>farm</b> <b>enterprise.</b> The study is based on data from the profitability bookkeeping of <b>farm</b> <b>enterprises,</b> and the reference data concerning agriculture consists of results from the FADN farms. The profitability bookkeeping of pluriactive <b>farm</b> <b>enterprises</b> was started in 1996, and in the first year 40 farms participated in the bookkeeping. The article concerning the economy of pluriactive <b>farm</b> <b>enterprises</b> deals with machine contracting, wood processing, farm holidays and processing of agricultural products as separate branches of industry, and the profitability of these has been compared with that of traditional <b>farm</b> <b>enterprises.</b> According to the results of 1996, the profitability of pluriactive <b>farm</b> <b>enterprises</b> was weaker than that of traditional farms.

To support this, a variety of high-tech tools are available. Despite this availability, farmers face difficulties in adopting and integrating them effectively. This paper presents a method to identify bottlenecks that hinder arable <b>farm</b> <b>enterprise</b> integration, in which a reference model serves {{as a base for}} models describing arable <b>farm</b> <b>enterprise</b> architectures. This reference model, described in a standard modeling language, shows the interrelations between the business, application and technology layers of <b>farm</b> <b>enterprises.</b> It was validated by two experts with expertise in the creation of reference models of arable farms. This reference model was used to create enterprise architectural descriptions of three arable farms in the Netherlands, showing a series of bottlenecks. The bottlenecks that we found are: nonexistence of services and interfaces to support farm processes, (partly) overlapping applications, inability of applications to share a data repository, skills required of farmers to exchange data and unavailability of business services to configure tools of different vendors. These bottlenecks, applicable for potato production in the Netherlands, were validated with national and international experts who have expertise in arable farming. Based on this validation, we conclude that these bottlenecks are valid for other cultivations and in other countries. This papers shows that our approach, i. e. describing the arable <b>farm</b> <b>enterprise</b> architecture, is also a valuable method to gain insight in different aspects of arable <b>farm</b> <b>enterprise</b> integration and {{can be used to make}} the first steps towards prioritizing and removing bottlenecks...|$|R
