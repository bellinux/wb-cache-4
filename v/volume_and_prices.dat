40|$|On average, {{stock prices}} rise around {{scheduled}} earnings announcement dates. We {{show that this}} earnings announcement premium is large, robust, and strongly related {{to the fact that}} volume surges around announcement dates. Stocks with high past announcement period volume earn the highest announcement premium, suggesting some common underlying cause for both volume and the premium. We show that high premium stocks experience the highest levels of imputed small investor buying, suggesting that the premium is driven by buying by small investors when the announcement catches their attention. The relation between trading <b>volume</b> <b>and</b> <b>prices</b> in asset markets is not well understood. In the purest neoclassical model with homogenous agents, prices adjust with no trading at all.

The asset markets are partially segmented: investors can search in only one market, but can decide which one. We show that there exist a continuum of symmetric equilibria where investors are indifferent between the two markets, and a unique clientele equilibrium where short-horizon investors strictly prefer one market. This “liquid ” market has higher <b>volume</b> <b>and</b> <b>prices,</b> and lower search times for buyers and sellers. The clientele equilibrium generally dominates the symmetric ones, i. e., the concentration of liquidity is socially desirable. In some cases, however, the clientele equilibrium is dominated, and in these cases the entry of buyers in the liquid market is below the socially optimal level...|$|E

We find that accumulative trading volume gradually emerges a kurtosis near the price mean value over a trading price range when it takes a longer trading time, regardless of actual price fluctuation path, time series, or total transaction volume in the time interval. To explain the volume-price behavior, we, in terms of physics, propose a transaction energy hypothesis, derive a time-independent transaction volume-price probability wave equation, and get two sets of analytical volume distribution eigenfunctions over a trading price range. By empiric test, we show the existence of coherence in stock market and demonstrate the model validation at this early stage. The volume-price behaves like a probability wave. ...|$|R

40|$|Recent studies {{contend that}} trading volume has {{predictive}} power for ex ante stock prices, particularly small stocks {{that do not}} react quickly to macroeconomic information. This study postulates that {{a significant amount of}} macro-information that flows on to stock markets is derived from derivative markets. We examine the impact of short-term futures trading <b>volume</b> <b>and</b> <b>prices</b> on cash stock prices using a case study of 15 -min data from the Australian stock index futures market which reports actual trading volume. After applying vector error correction modelling (VECM), variance decomposition and impulse functions, we conclude that futures prices provide a short-term information lead to stock prices that dominates trading volume effects. We also observe asymmetric changes in the impact of trading volume between bull and bear price momentum phases and after large trading volume shocks. These results suggest that, in future, studies on trading volume should control for the cross-correlation impact from derivative prices and the differential impact of trading phases. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop a simple {{theoretical}} model {{to analyze the}} impact of institutional herding on asset prices. In our model, career-concerned money managers interact with pro…t-motivated proprietary traders and security dealers endowed with market power. The interaction between these three classes of traders generates rich implications. First, we show that the reputational concerns of fund managers imply an endogenous tendency to imitate past trades, which, in turn, impacts the prices of the assets they trade. Second, our model predicts a negative correlation between institutional herding and long-term returns. We show that, in markets dominated by fund managers, assets persistently bought (sold) by fund managers trade at prices that are too high (low) and thus experience negative (positive) long-term returns, after uncertainty is resolved. Third, our model can generate {{a positive correlation between}} institutional herding and shortterm returns. Our theory thus provides a simple and uni…ed framework within which to interpret the empirical literature on the price impact of institutional herding. In addition, our paper generates several new testable predictions linking institutional herding behavior, contractual incentives, trading <b>volume,</b> <b>and</b> <b>prices...</b>|$|E

While the previous related literature studies the reactions of sales <b>volume</b> <b>and</b> <b>prices</b> to an interest rate shock only, we investigate the responses to income and credit shocks as well. Based on an estimated vector-error correction model, the response of prices to demand shocks is found to be substantially slower than that of sales. The effect of a demand shock on sales peaks within a quarter from the shock. The results show that the differences in the reaction patterns to demand shocks can create the kind of strong positive co-movement between price movements and sales and the kind of negative correlation between price level and sales that has been found in a number of housing markets. It is also found that the direct predictive ability of the fundamentals with respect to housing price growth and sales is overwhelmed by the predictive power of the lagged observations on price changes and sales themselves.
