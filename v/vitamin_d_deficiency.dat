In the United States, {{it is estimated that}} 75% of the MS patient populations use at least one complementary and alternative medicine for treatment and symptomatic control. The evidence for effectiveness for such treatments in most cases is weak or absent. Examples of treatments used by patients include dietary supplementation and regimens such as vitamin D, calcium, vitamin B12, and antioxidants. The rationale behind the use of Vitamin D supplementation is that studies show an association between <b>vitamin</b> <b>D</b> <b>deficiency</b> and increasing progression of MS, as well as the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D.|$|E

30|$|Elevated {{circulating}} {{levels of}} apoB-containing lipoproteins LDL, VLDL, chylomicrons, and chylomicron remnants are recognized independent {{risk factors for}} the development of atherosclerosis (Young and Parthasarathy, 1994).

Ces 1 d has been demonstrated to participate in the provision of substrates for VLDL assembly and inactivation of Ces 1 d decreases VLDL secretion and blood lipid levels in vivo (Wei et al., 2010).

40|$|Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disease that {{is accompanied by}} the emergence of autoreactive T cells and a reduction in regulatory T cells.

This exacerbation in disease is associated with: 1) reduced TNF-? and IL- 4 production by T cells, especially during the disease induction phase; and 2) expansion of marginal zone B cells. Strikingly, inoculation of pristane in wild-type mice resulted in reduced numbers and/or functions of NK T cells and CD 1 d-expressing dendritic cells.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{connection}} between vitamin D-insufficiency, sarcopenia and frailty-syndrome has been examined. Vitamin D-insufficiency is common in germany regardless of age but has an even higher prevalence in the elderly. Sarcopenia describes the age-associated and functional relevant loss of muscle mass -following some definitions also muscle strength- whereas the frailty-syndrome is a multidimensional syndrome leading to negative outcomes such as heightened mortality. The hypothesis was that vitamin D-insufficiency favors the incidence of sarcopenia as well as frailty and that sarcopenia is {{a key factor in}} the development of the frailty-syndrome. Vice versa it could be imagined that frailty with limited mobility could lead to vitamin d-insuffiency due to reduced time spent outside and limited sun exposure. 360 community-dwelling participants of BASE-II aged 61 to 84 took part in the examinations. Serum level of <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> was determined via direct chemoluminescence immunoassay and muscle mass for diagnosing sarcopenia was measured using a DEXA-scan. Frailty was assessed with the frailty-index after Fried et al. and the five frailty criteria weight loss, exhaustion, physical activity, gait speed and weakness were determined via anamnesis, questionnaires, geriatric assessment and grip strength measurement. The expected high prevalence of vitamin d-insufficiency was confirmed in the BASE-II-sample (69, 7 %). The prevalence of sarcopenia (19, 5 % women, 15, 5 % men) lies in the middle compared to other studies whereas the prevalence of frailty (1, 1 %) was considerably lower compared to other studies presumably due to a lower mean age. The further analyses showed no correlation between vitamin d-level, sarcopenia and frailty. The variance of values of the skeletal mucle mass-index used for measuring sarcopenia could only very little be explained by age and physical activity as possible factors of influence. Furthermore the influence of skeletal muscle mass and age on frailty showed to be less than ten percent. These findings diminish the hope that a single factor like <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> will serve as a predictor for sarcopenia and frailty-syndrome which may offer options for prevention and treatment. Beyond that sarcopenia may not be the key factor in the pathogenesis of frailty as commonly considered. It can be assumed that sarcopenia and notably frailty are highly multifactorial conditioned and therefore the identification and emphasis of separate pathophysiological relevant factors may be a difficult task...|$|R
30|$|Long-term stable osseointegrated {{implants}} are {{the primary}} goal in dental implantology. Although dental implants have proven clinical reliable in the long term, the failure of implants {{at a very early}} stage of osseointegration has been described [1, 2]. The pursuit to identify the mechanisms leading to early implant failure is ongoing to date and include the following: tobacco usage, diabetes, wear particle release and foreign body reaction, local bone necrosis due to heat generation during bone preparation or implant placement [2 – 9]. Systematic reviews demonstrated that an antibiotic regimen before dental implant placement subtly reduces the early implant infection and consequently implant failure [10, 11]. In orthopedics, the risk to develop a periprosthetic joint infection has been associated with a low vitamin D level [12]. A relationship between bone metabolism, vitamin D, and early implant failure in human has not been proven to date. Vitamin D induces bone formation around implants in rodents [13 – 17]. Besides the classical function, findings of the last decades indicate vitamin D as an important immune regulator targeting both, the innate and adaptive immune response, since all cells of the immune system express <b>vitamin</b> <b>d</b> receptor (VDR) [18 – 20].|$|R

30|$|Nonalcoholic {{fatty liver}} disease (NAFLD) {{is the leading}} cause of chronic liver injury. NAFLD is {{commonly}} associated with insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Clinical phenotypes of NAFLD extend from simple steatosis, which is characterized by excess deposition of TG in the liver, to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is distinguished from simple steatosis by the presence of hepatocyte injury (ballooning and cell death), inflammation and/or fibrosis. NASH can further progress to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (Cohen et al., 2011; Tiniakos et al., 2010). Inactivation of Ces 1 d protected mice from high-fat diet induced steatosis. Ablation of Ces 1 d expression in two independent NASH mouse models, phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase knockout mice fed high-fat diet, and Ldlr −/− mice fed high-fat, high-cholesterol Western-type diet, reduced liver inflammation, oxidative stress and fibrosis (Lian et al., 2012 a, 2016).

Among the many cell types {{of the immune system}} implicated in metabolic control and disease, iNKTs seem ideally poised for such a role, yet little has been done to elucidate such a possible function. We hypothesized that lipid presentation by CD 1 d could report on metabolic status and engage iNKTs to regulate cellular lipid content through their various effector mechanisms. To test this hypothesis, we examined CD 1 d deficient mice in a variety of metabolically stressed paradigms including high fat feeding, choline-deficient feeding, fasting, and acute inflammation. CD 1 <b>d</b> <b>deficiency</b> led to a mild exacerbation of steatosis during high fat or choline-deficient feeding, accompanied by impaired hepatic glucose tolerance. Surprisingly, however, this phenotype was not observed in Ja 182 / 2 mice, which are deficient in iNKTs but express CD 1 d. Thus, CD 1 d appears to modulate some metabolic functions through an iNKT-independent mechanism...|$|R
