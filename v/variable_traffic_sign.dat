Automatic detection of <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> {{is important for}} navigation, autonomous driving, transportation asset management, etc. With the advance of laser and imaging sensors, Mobile Mapping System (MMS) becomes widely used in transportation agencies to map the transportation infrastructure. Although many algorithms of <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> detection are developed in the literature, they are still a tradeoff between the detection speed and accuracy, especially for the large-scale mobile mapping of both the rural and urban roads. This paper is motivated to efficiently survey <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> while mapping the road network and the roadside landscape. Inspired by the manual delineation of <b>traffic</b> <b>sign,</b> a drawing strategy is proposed to quickly approximate the boundary of <b>traffic</b> <b>sign.</b> Both the shape and color prior of the <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> are simultaneously involved during the drawing process. The most common speed-limit sign circle and the statistic color model of <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> are studied in this paper. Anchor points of <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> edge are located with the local maxima of color and gradient difference. Starting with the anchor points, contour of <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> is drawn smartly along the most significant direction of color and intensity consistency. The drawing process is also constrained by the curvature feature of the <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> circle. The drawing of linear growth is discarded immediately if it fails to form an arc over some steps. The Kalman filter principle is adopted to predict the temporal context of <b>traffic</b> <b>sign.</b> Based on the estimated point,we can predict and double check the <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> in consecutive frames. The event probability of having a <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> over the consecutive observations is compared with the null hypothesis of no perceptible <b>traffic</b> <b>sign.</b> The temporally salient <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> is then detected statistically and automatically as the rare event of having a <b>traffic</b> <b>sign.</b> The proposed algorithm is tested with a diverse set of images that are taken inWuhan, China with theMMS ofWuhan University.

40|$|<b>Traffic</b> <b>Sign</b> Recognition systems aim to {{determine}} the meaning of <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> in highways for real-world applications such as <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> inventory or driver assistance systems. <b>Traffic</b> <b>sign</b> datasets are inherently imbalanced, i. e. some <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> appear more frequently than others. One serious consequence of this imbalance is the low recognition rates of minority classes (classes with fewer training cases). In this paper, we propose a new method for improving <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> recognition of minority classes, by applying balancing algorithms. As a result, our proposed method improves minority class recognition rates up to 28 % compared to traditional methods...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} paper highlights {{the problems that}} are encountered in a typical <b>Traffic</b> <b>Sign</b> Recognition System like incorrect interpretation of a particular <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> which is observed by a driver while driving a vehicle causing misunderstanding thereby resulting in road accidents. The visibility is affected by many environmental factors such as smoke, rain, fog, humid weather, dust etc. {{and it is very}} difficult to understand the <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> in this situations, causing misinterpretations of the particular <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> and resulting in road accidents. In order to avoid this condition, a novel method of recognizing <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> is developed which take into consideration the color and shape of the <b>traffic</b> <b>sign.</b> A algorithm called as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is used for classification of different groups of <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> which are predefined by a particular set of features after the process of Image Segmentation. The images are segmented by using the color and shape features of an image and the features are extracted by using the Haar Transform and then the classification of images is done by using Linear Discriminant Analysis Algorithm. Finally the GUI of <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> images is prepared by using the software tool called as MATLAB. Our main objective is to recognize partially occluded <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> in a cloudy environment by using LDA and to make an efficient <b>Traffic</b> <b>Sign</b> Detection system which will be capable of recognizing and classifying any kind of known <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> from the other <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> by considering the color and shape of the <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> on the basis of supervised classification of the training data so that any error which results in a faulty detection or incorrect detection of <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> can be eliminated...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The robust {{identification}} of the <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> represents the first {{and one of the}} most important steps in the development of a <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> recognition (TSR) system. <b>Traffic</b> <b>signs</b> detection usually involves a color segmentation process that uses the information related to the chromatic properties of the road <b>signs.</b> Since the <b>traffic</b> video data is captured in diverse road and weather conditions, the problem relating to <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> detection is quite challenging. Among several issues that need to be addressed during this processing stage, the problem generated by mutually occluding <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> (mutual occlusion occurs when one <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> partially occludes the surface of other road signs) that are attached to the same pole require special attention. In these situations the color segmentation process fails to correctly identify the regions that are associated with the <b>traffic</b> <b>signs.</b> These <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> detection failures compromise the performance of other stages of the TSR system and in this paper we propose two approaches that address the segmentation of mutually occluding <b>traffic</b> <b>signs.</b> The first approach uses the information associated with the inner parts of the <b>traffic</b> <b>signs,</b> while the second approach applies the watershed transform to identify the signs that have their borders in contact or are mutually occluding...|$|R

However, among damaged <b>signs,</b> dirty <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> are unique since their damage is not permanent and they just can be cleaned instead of replaced. This study aimed to identify the most important factors contributing to <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> dirt. To do so, a large number of <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> in Utah were measured by deploying a vehicle instrumented with mobile LiDAR imaging and digital photolog technologies. Each individual daytime digital image was inspected for dirt. Location and climate observations obtained from official sources were compiled using ArcGIS throughout the process. To identify contributing factors to <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> dirt, the chi-square test was employed. To analyze the data and rank all of the factors based on their importance to the sign dirt, Random forests statistical model was utilized. After analyzing the data, it can be concluded that ground elevation, sign mount height, and air pollution had the highest effect on making <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> dirty. The findings of this investigation assist transportation agencies in determining <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> with a higher likelihood of sign dirt. In this way, agencies would schedule to clean such <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> more frequently...|$|R

A camera fitted in the car captures the video and sends the data to an in-vehicle computing device. We propose a four stage algorithm that detects the <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> using YCbCr colour space and shape based filtering. The detected <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> are tracked and recognized using interest point descriptors. The algorithm is robust and can detect signs even when the <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> board is rotated. The <b>traffic</b> <b>sign</b> template database can be updated easily. The method is aimed at achieving high accuracy in recognizing <b>traffic</b> <b>signs</b> at real-time, with a low computational cost.
