40|$|A {{series of}} 13 {{explosive}} eruptions occurred at Augustine Volcano, Alaska, from January 11 - 28, 2006. Each lasted 2. 5 to 19 minutes and produced ash columns 3. 8 to 13. 5 km above mean sea level. We investigated various parameters to determine systematic trends, including durations, seismic amplitudes, frequency contents, signal characteristics, peak acoustic pressures, ash column heights, lightning occurrence, and lengths of pre-event and post-event quiescence. Individual tephra volumes are not known. There {{is no clear}} correlation between acoustic peak pressure and ash column height or between peak seismic amplitude and duration. However, several trends are evident. Two events, January 11 at 0444 AKST (1344 UTC) and January 27 at 2337 AKST (0837 UTC) are short (180 and 140 seconds) and have very impulsive onsets and high acoustic peak pressures of 93 and 105 Pa, as well as high peak seismic amplitudes. We interpret these to be mainly gas releases. Two of the largest events followed quiescent intervals of 3 days or longer: January 17 at 0758 AKST (1658 UTC), and January 27 at 2024 AKST (January 28 at 0524 UTC). These two events had reduced displacements (DR) of 11. 4 and 7. 5 cm 2, respectively. Although these DR values are typical for eruptions with ash columns to 9 to 14 km, most other DR values of 1. 6 to 3. 6 cm 2 are low for the 7. 0 to 10. 5 km ash column heights observed. The combination of short durations, small DR and high ash columns suggests that these events are highly explosive, in agreement with <b>Vulcanian</b> <b>eruption</b> <b>type.</b> Several events had long durations on individual seismic stations but not on others; we interpret these to represent pyroclastic or other flows passing near the affected stations so that tractions or momentum exchange from the cloud or flow adds energy to the ground only near those stations. The eruption on January 27 at 2024 AKST had more than 300 lightning flashes, whereas the following eruptions on January 28 at 0204 AKST and 0742 AKST had only 28 and 6 lightning flashes. The 2024 AKST eruption had a longer duration (1, 180 versus 3 ̆c 460 seconds), a higher ash column height (10. 5 versus 7. 0 - 7. 2 km) and higher acoustic peak pressure (83 versus 66 and 24 Pa). The {{data suggest that the}} lightning-rich 2024 AKST eruption produced more tephra than the following eruptions, hence there were more charge carriers injected to the atmosphere. Seismic signals preceded the infrasound signals by 0 to 5 seconds with no obvious pattern in terms of the above groupings. The explosive eruption phase overlapped with the subsequent continuous phase by about 2 days. Parametric data may be useful to estimate eruption conditions in near real time...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Four {{mechanisms}} caused tephra fallout at Soufriere HiHs Volcano, Montserrat, {{during the}} 1995 - 1999 period: explosive activity (mainly of <b>Vulcanian</b> <b>type),</b> dome collapses, ash-venting and phreatic explosions. The first two mechanisms contributed {{most of the}} tephra-fallout deposits (minimum total dense-rock equivalent volume of 23 x 106 m)), which vary from massive to layered and represent the amalgamation of the deposits from a large numbers of events. The volume of co-pyroclastic flow fallout tephra is in the range 4 - 16 % of the associated pyroclastic flow deposits.

30|$|Strombolian eruptions are {{frequently}} {{associated with the}} release of low-viscosity magma with a composition of basalt to basaltic andesite (e.g., Houghton and Gonnermann 2008; Taddeucci et al. 2015). A burst of overpressurized gas slugs has been considered as a possible mechanism for triggering major Strombolian eruptions (e.g., Blackburn et al. 1976; Chouet et al. 2003; James et al. 2009; Parfitt 2004; Ripepe 1996; Vergniolle and Gaudemer 2015). Recently, a variety of eruption styles have been reported. For instance, at Stromboli Volcano, Italy, eruption styles are classified into three <b>types.</b> <b>Type</b> 0 <b>eruptions</b> are gas-dominated, <b>Type</b> 1 <b>eruptions</b> are dominated by coarse ballistic clasts, and <b>Type</b> 2 <b>eruptions</b> consist of an ash-rich plume (Leduc et al. 2015; Patrick et al. 2007). Some part of the ash emitted by a <b>Type</b> 2 <b>eruption</b> falls back to the vent, which covers the vent as debris. This recycling process has also been recognized through the morphological observation of ash grains (D’Oriano et al. 2014). Reheating causes groundmass crystallization, sintering/welding, and a color change (D’Oriano et al. 2013). Such debris prevents the gas and magma flows in the conduit and may contribute to the generation of a viscous plug at a shallow conduit, which in turn affects the eruption styles (Capponi et al. 2016; Gaudin et al. 2017). Although its origin is controversial, the existence of a viscous plug has been suggested by the textural, geochemical, and rheological analysis of ejected pyroclasts and bombs (e.g., Gurioli et al. 2014; Lautze and Houghton 2007; Leduc et al. 2015).|$|R
5|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} <b>types</b> of <b>eruptions.</b> The most well-observed are magmatic eruptions, which involve the decompression of gas within magma that propels it forward. Phreatomagmatic <b>eruptions</b> are another <b>type</b> of volcanic <b>eruption,</b> {{driven by the}} compression of gas within magma, the direct opposite of the process powering magmatic activity. The third eruptive type is the phreatic eruption, which {{is driven by the}} superheating of steam via contact with magma; these eruptive types often exhibit no magmatic release, instead causing the granulation of existing rock.|$|R
40|$|On 7 September 2008 a major ash {{explosion}} occurred {{from the}} SW summit crater of Stromboli volcano. This explosive event lasted ~ 2 min {{and consisted of}} three discrete eruptive pulses, forming an eruptive ash cloud ~ 500 – 600 m high and ~ 300 m wide, 11 rising with speed of 20 – 27 m s- 1. The event was recorded by our camera and seismic networks, {{as well as by}} two electric stations installed at a 500 m mean distance from the SW crater. The electric signals recorded by the two stations during this event were 106 times greater than signals recorded during the persistent Strombolian activity, and the seismic trace had a bigger amplitude and a longer duration. Camera image analysis allowed us to infer that a partial obstruction took place at the SW crater three days before the explosive event, suggesting that a constriction within the upper conduit could have likely led to magma overpressure. Data analysis, combined with previous experimental investigations, revealed that the higher energy output of the ash explosion, when compared to the persistent Strombolian activity, resulted in a greater magma fragmentation and erupted mass. Integration of the different parameters allowed us to classify the event as a <b>Vulcanian</b> <b>type,</b> and electric signal analysis enabled retrieval of the total volume of erupted ash and of the amounts of the juvenile, phreatomagmatic, and lithic components...|$|R
