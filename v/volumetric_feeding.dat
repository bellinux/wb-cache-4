The {{control of}} {{gravimetric}} feeding is generally done by control systems which utilize feedback control. The main problem with these control systems {{is that they}} generally revert to <b>volumetric</b> <b>feeding</b> during the refilling cycle. Furthermore the control system software is proprietary information and therefore not {{in the public sector}} and also very expensive. The main {{purpose of the study was}} therefore to review the basics of gravimetric feeding and to apply the knowledge in the design of a control system with applicable software for gravimetric feeding which is not affected by material bulk density variations, targeting food extrusion applications. It is also aimed at producing a test bench to test the control system and the developed software. The developed control system is a programmable logic controller (PLC) based control system. This allows for the control system to be easily integrated into any PLC controlled twin screw extruder. The control system was extensively tested to verify the developed gravimetric control algorithms. The results from the experimental tests illustrated that a fully functional gravimetric feeding system had been developed. Most importantly also that the volumetric characteristics of a material can be used, to assist a PI–controlled gravimetric feeding system in both the feeding cycle and the refilling cycle.

The experimental results obtained with the filtering hydrocyclones under the same operational conditions as those used with the conventional device allow the conclusion that performance of the Bradley and Rietema types is significantly influenced by the filtering medium.

50|$|In {{the food}} sector, moving or {{transporting}} fluids is achieved {{with the aid}} of pump technology. Colloquially, this is known as filling or portioning. Various different types of pumps are used, {{depending on the type of}} filling products to be moved. Vacuum fillers with vane cell feed systems and vacuum feeding are commonly used for viscous products. The products are transported {{with the aid of}} a hopper with a feeding device, a vane cell feed system under a vacuum and appropriate volume expulsion in the pump housing. This is basically a <b>volumetric</b> <b>feed</b> principle, which means that a certain weight is defined via a volume. In addition to the vane cell feed systems, also known as rotary vane pumps, there are also screw feed systems with feed augers, toothed wheel feed systems and evacuated lifting cylinders. With all these systems, transportation is achieved via volume expulsion under a vacuum.Vacuum fillers are traditionally used in the meat processing industry as well as in other food sectors. They can also be found in some non-food sectors. Generally speaking, vacuum fillers can be used for filling pasty and compressible products.|$|R

We consider kinetic models in which the specific growth rate {{is a function of}} the substrate concentration only. Two classes of models are distinguished: non-monotonic kinetics (with the Haldane model as a prototype) and monotonic kinetics (with the Monod model as a prototype). The information content of several simulation experiments, each with a different <b>volumetric</b> <b>feed</b> rate profile is evaluated by using the modified E-criterion for optimal experimental design (i. e., ratio of the largest to the smallest eigenvalue of the Fisher information matrix). The main contribution of this paper is to provide theoretical evidence and to present illustrative examples for the following conjecture: A feed rate strategy which is optimal in the sense of process performance, is an excellent starting point for feed rate optimization with respect to estimation of those parameters with large influence upon process performance. For a two degrees of freedom optimization of the feed rate profile, we obtain for the first time a modified E-criterion value equal to 1, which is the optimal value for this criterion. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of particle segregation in forming a conical pile or centrally filling a cylindrical vessel is investigated by applying a Shinohara et al. 2 ̆ 7 s Screening Layer model (1972, 1984 and 1990), where the segregation patterns were {{measured by a}} tube-sampling experiment and a DEM simulation. The distribution of mixing ratio of a segregating component of different sizes can be drawn along the pile surface and well correlated {{with each other for}} the first time. As a result, the zone, where the segregating component of smaller particle is contained around a central feed point, was found to expand by an increment of the initial mixing ratio, the <b>volumetric</b> <b>feed</b> rate and the flow length of the pile surface. These characteristics are governed by flowability parameters such as velocity ratio, penetration rate and packing rate of the segregating component, which are affected by operating conditions besides particle properties and are to be delved into further. In spite of complicated avalanche phenomena of particles exhibited around the flowing head along the conical pile surface, the present model description consisting of the material balance within the flowing layer was found to be satisfactory in practice with the verifications from the experiments and the microscopic DEM simulation. 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Fast {{particle}} flotation {{is accomplished}} by maximising three fundamental aspects: the kinetics of particle-bubble attachment, the bubble interfacial flux for particle extraction, {{and the rate of}} bubble-liquid segregation. In practice, it has been impossible to extend all three aspects simultaneously using conventional flotation devices. Hence, significantly higher processing rates using a single flotation cell has not been possible. Here, the Reflux Flotation Cell has been used in this work to address all three aspects in unison in a single stage of separation. This novel system permits throughput rates well beyond conventional flotation standards. Stable operation using extreme gas and feed fluxes is accomplished using a system of parallel inclined channels located below the vertical portion of the cell. In this paper a highly diluted coal feed comprised of well-liberated coal particles at 0. 35. wt% solids, was prepared from hydrocyclone overflow. The <b>volumetric</b> <b>feed</b> flux was increased to nearly 10 times the typical conventional level, achieving an extremely low cell residence time, in the order of 25. s. Very good combustible recoveries were obtained, with the + 38. µm portion increasing from 92. 3 % to 98. 5 % with increasing gas flux.

40|$|Masters Research - Master of Philosophy (MPhil) In {{this study}} a falling film {{apparatus}} {{was used to}} aerate a continuous water stream containing solids. Specifically, {{the aim of the}} research was to investigate the performance of the apparatus, in terms of the oxygen mass transfer rate, overall volumetric mass transfer coefficient, interfacial area and alpha factor, as a function of water volumetric flow rate, initial dissolved oxygen concentration, solids concentration, and apparatus geometry. The falling film apparatus was comprised of a vertical array of horizontal wooden cylinders (0. 035 m diameter and 0. 150 m length); where the number of cylinders and vertical spacing between each cylinder in the array was between 5 - 11 and 0 - 6 mm, respectively. The cylinder array was housed inside an enclosed chamber, of volume approximately 33 L, which was filled with a pure oxygen atmosphere during the experiments. The tap water <b>feed</b> with <b>volumetric</b> flow rate in the range 0. 7 - 4. 5 L/min and corresponding to film Reynolds numbers between 142 - 1135 was introduced via an inlet {{at the top of the}} chamber. The feed was then directed uniformly along the entire width of the uppermost cylinder through a distribution nozzle; and then cascaded over the cylinders below before being discharged through an exit at the bottom of the enclosed chamber. A pressure manometer and dissolved oxygen (DO) meters were used to monitor the chamber pressure and DO of the inlet and outlet streams, respectively. Experiments were performed for feed water solids (MLSS) concentrations of between 0 - 12820 mg/L. The solids used in the study were activated sludge residue that had been stabilised: (1) biologically, with at least 1 year of residence time in a sludge lagoon that was either submerged or had been drained for dewatering purposes; and (2) thermally, in a drying oven maintained at 90 ºC for at least 12 hours. The expectation was that there would be no biological uptake during the mass transfer experiments. Whilst this was the case, chemisorption of the dissolved oxygen onto the heat treated activated (carbon) sludge was found to take place and was accounted for quantitatively when determining the oxygen mass transfer coefficient from the mass transfer experiments. The mass transfer experiments involved filling the aeration chamber with pure oxygen and recording the inlet and outlet DO concentrations of the downflowing water stream both without and with MLSS solids present. The mass of oxygen transferred over the experiment duration was then inputted in Fick’s Law to determine the mass transfer coefficient and alpha value based on measured/computed average falling film thickness and velocity. For experiment with no biosolids and zero vertical spacing between adjacent cylinders, it was found that the oxygen mass transfer rate increased with increasing <b>volumetric</b> <b>feed</b> flow rate and increasing number of cylinders in the vertical array—which corresponded to an increase in the gas-liquid contact time. The mass transfer rate could be adequately fitted to a power law relationship for the <b>volumetric</b> <b>feed</b> rate. Similarly, the computed mass transfer coefficient, using the wetted surface area of the cylinders as the mass transfer area, could be reasonably modelled by a power law where the fitted <b>volumetric</b> <b>feed</b> rate exponent of 0. 82 was independent of the number cylinders in the array. The exponent value of 0. 82 was consistent with published literature values where wavy motion were present on the surface of the falling film—as was observed in this study. Average film thickness and water mean velocity were measured experimentally for a water-only feed and 8 -cylinder array with zero spacing. The measurements were able to be adequately described by existing analysis for vertical falling films as well as the correlation by Rogers and Goindy (1989). A limited number of experiments were performed for a vertical spacing of 3 mm. It was found that there was an increase in the oxygen mass transfer rate when compared with that of zero spacing. However, once the resultant increase in mass transfer area and contact time, due to the increased distance the feed travels whilst the velocity remained relatively unchanged, it was found that there was no statistical difference to that of the mass transfer coefficient for zero spacing. For vertical spacing beyond 5 mm, the integrity of the liquid film was not able to be maintained and not considered further as part of this study. Mass transfer experiments were performed for MLSS in the range 740 - 12820 mg/L for an 8 -cylinder array with 3 mm vertical separation. It was found that the mass transfer coefficient could be fitted to the <b>volumetric</b> <b>feed</b> rate to a power law with the same exponent of 0. 82 as that obtained for the water only experiments. The experimental mass transfer coefficient versus MLSS concentration was compared with the predictions from correlations of Al-Malah (2013) and Seader and Henley (2006) for vertical falling films. In order to apply the correlations the presence of solids on the apparent viscosity was taken into account using the expression of Mooney (1950) for non-aggregating, spherical particles. Good agreement between measurement and predictions from Seader and Henley (2006) was obtained for experimental film Reynolds number average of 865. For experimentally determined mass transfer coefficient values normalised to a film Reynolds number of 25, and corresponding to a smooth film surface, it was found that the model of Al-Malah (2013) provided better agreement, which is not surprising given the analysis was based on a smooth, laminar film. At Re F of 25, the Seader and Henley (2006) correlation over-predicted the k L value by approximately 500 percent. Finally, the computed alpha followed an exponential decay with increasing MLSS concentration, with an exponential decay coefficient of - 0. 3, which compared very favourably with results with all other aeration devices (see Figure 4. 11) considered in this study. The finding supports the original hypothesis that the negative impact of the presence of solids on the mass transfer performance, i. e. reduction in alpha value, commonly experienced in bubble-type aeration devices due to coalescence can be avoided by not having the gas as the dispersed phase. The falling film device has demonstrated that mass transfer is much less sensitive to the presence of solids, and for this reason offers an alternative aeration methodology...|$|R
40|$|Cenospheres are hollow, low-density {{particles}} {{found in}} power station fly ash. They have many commercially-useful properties which {{make them a}} valuable by-product. However, recovering cenospheres from fly ash is difficult due to their low concentration and fine size. Experiments were performed to test the novel approach of using an Inverted Reflux Classifier. In this configuration, the particles are fluidised by adding wash water from above which helps to wash any entrained dense material from the overhead product. Inclined channels are mounted at the base to minimise the loss of buoyant cenospheres in the waste underflow stream. Experiments were performed at both laboratory scale (80 mm × 100 mm cross-section) and pilot scale (300 mm × 300 mm cross section) using mixtures of cenospheres and silica, all nominally less than 100 μm in size. In batch tests, the bed expansion behaviour of the positively-buoyant cenospheres in the Inverted Reflux Classifier {{was found to be}} analogous to the behaviour of negatively-buoyant particles in the standard configuration. Continuous steady-state experiments were performed using feeds with suspension solids concentration varying from 0. 3 to 9. 5 wt. % solids and a buoyant cenosphere grade of 0. 5 to 65 wt. %, with a range of fluidisation wash water rates, and degree of volume reduction (ratio of <b>volumetric</b> <b>feed</b> to product rate). Both units delivered high recoveries and product grades. An increase in volume reduction (decreasing overflow rate for a given feed rate), caused a drop in recovery and an improvement in grade. The throughput advantage compared to a conventional teetered (fluidised) bed separator was over 30 in some cases. Both laboratory and pilot-scale units displayed similar behaviour and the results were also consistent with existing correlations for negatively-buoyant particles in the standard Reflux Classifier. Hence this technology has clear potential for recovering and concentrating cenospheres from fly ash...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC) is on {{the edge}} of being commercially used. In Germany, the MTU Friedrichshafen has {{developed}} an MCFC system called HotModule with 250 kW electric power operated at about 650 °C. The HotModule offers high overall electric efficiency of about 50 % and can be fed by a wide variety of fuels like natural gas, bio gas or coal gas. Aside from the electric power it produces highly valuable heat at about 400 °C, which can be used either for steam generation in an industrial application or for a turbine in order {{to increase the amount of}} electric power produced. The principle of the MCFC is shown in figure 1. Although the HotModule ran reliably for more than two years in a power station in Germany, control strategies for changes in load demands as well as for start-up phase, emergency cases and in shut-down are still missing. Therefore the companies MTU Friedrichshafen and IPF Magdeburg, the University Bayreuth and the MPI in Magdeburg are currently conducting a research project under the leadership of the Chair for process systems engineering at the University Magdeburg. The main experimental device of this project is a HotModule, which has recently been installed at the University hospital in Magdeburg by MTU Friedrichshafen. The IPF company will use this facility primarily for demonstration and research purposes. First part of this project is the mathematical modelling and experimental validation of the HotModule. Experimental model validation mathematical models for the HotModule are currently being developed at the University and the MPI in Magdeburg.

40|$|The direct {{oxidation}} of H{sub 2 }S to elemental sulfur in {{the presence}} of SO{sub 2 } is ideally suited for coal gas from commercial gasifiers with a quench system to remove essentially all the trace contaminants except H{sub 2 }S. This direct oxidation process has the potential to produce a super clean coal gas more economically than both conventional amine-based processes and the hot-gas desulfurization using regenerable metal oxide sorbents followed by Direct Sulfur Recovery Process. The objective of this research is to support the near- and long-term process development efforts to commercialize this direct oxidation technology. The objectives of this research are to measure kinetics of direct oxidation of H{sub 2 }S to elemental sulfur {{in the presence}} of a simulated coal gas mixture containing SO{sub 2 }, H{sub 2 }, and moisture, using 160 -{micro}m C- 500 - 04 alumina catalyst particles and a micro bubble reactor, and to develop kinetic rate equations and model the direct oxidation process to assist in the design of large-scale plants. This heterogeneous catalytic reaction has gaseous reactants such as H{sub 2 }S and SO{sub 2 }. However, this heterogeneous catalytic reaction has heterogeneous products such as liquid elemental sulfur and steam. To achieve the above-mentioned objectives, experiments on conversion of hydrogen sulfide into liquid elemental sulfur were carried out for the space time range of 0. 059 - 0. 87 seconds at 125 - 155 C to evaluate effects of reaction temperature, H{sub 2 }S concentration, reaction pressure, and catalyst loading on conversion of hydrogen sulfide into liquid elemental sulfur.

There is an {{increase in}} the consumption of fish, from typically piscivorous fish to opportunistic species that take advantage of abundant resources. This study aims to evaluate the effects of diet changes induced by damming on the feeding activity and condition factor of typically piscivorous (Hoplias aff. malabaricus and Oligosarcus longirostris) and opportunistic (Astyanax lacustris (ex Astyanax altiparanae) and Pimelodus britskii). Sampling was conducted before and after the impoundment in the Iguaçu River in the region of Salto Caxias, Paraná State, Brazil. Stomach contents were analysed by the <b>volumetric</b> method. <b>Feeding</b> activity and body condition were inferred by the mean stomach repletion index and the mean condition factor. Typically piscivorous species presented a general tendency of decreased feeding activity and increased condition factor, while opportunistic species, presented a decrease in condition and feeding activity in the most affected sites. The increase in the condition factor of piscivorous fish suggests that these species benefit by the increased abundance of small size prey fish. Some opportunist species that do not have adjustments for the piscivorous diet, regardless of the intensity of consumption and resource availability, can suffer negative reflex when adopting a piscivorous diet...|$|R

The model was used to investigate alternative operating scenarios, determine the optimum <b>volumetric</b> waste <b>feed</b> ratio of AP- 101 to AY- 102, and, for each campaign, estimate the simulant and input recycle volumes corresponding to the target glass production rates of 6 MT/day HLW glass and 80 MT/day LAW glass and scaled to the target of 140 L of Campaign I washed sludge. It was designed to quickly achieve steady state and simulation results indicate this was accomplished by Campaign IV. The alternative operating scenarios modeled differed only in {{the point at which the}} AP- 101 and AY- 102 waste feed streams were introduced to the process. The results showed no difference in the production rate between the scenarios. Therefore, for these specific waste feeds the process should be operated to maximize the energy efficiency and minimize scaling in the evaporator by feeding the AY- 102 waste feed to the ultra-filtration feed prep tank, bypassing the waste feed evaporator...|$|R
40|$|The direct {{oxidation}} of H{sub 2 }S to elemental sulfur in {{the presence}} of SO{sub 2 } is ideally suited for coal gas from commercial gasifiers with a quench system to remove essentially all the trace contaminants except H{sub 2 }S. This direct oxidation process has the potential to produce a super clean coal gas more economically than both conventional amine-based processes and HGD/DSRP. The objective of this research is to support the near- and long-term DOE efforts to commercialize this direct oxidation technology. The objectives of this research are to measure kinetics of direct oxidation of H{sub 2 }S to elemental sulfur {{in the presence}} of a simulated coal gas mixture containing SO{sub 2 }, H{sub 2 }, and moisture, using 60 -{micro}m C- 500 - 04 alumina catalyst particles and a PFA differential fixed-bed micro reactor, and to develop kinetic rate equations and model the direct oxidation process to assist in the design of large-scale plants. To achieve the above-mentioned objectives, experiments on conversion of hydrogen sulfide into elemental sulfur were carried out for the space time range of 0. 01 - 0. 047 seconds at 125 - 155 C to evaluate effects of reaction temperatures, moisture concentrations, reaction pressures on conversion of hydrogen sulfide into elemental sulfur. Simulated coal gas mixtures consist of 61 - 89 v% hydrogen, 2, 300 - 9, 200 -ppmv hydrogen sulfide, 1, 600 - 4, 900 ppmv sulfur dioxide, and 2. 6 - 13. 7 vol % moisture, and nitrogen as remainder. <b>Volumetric</b> <b>feed</b> rates of a simulated coal gas mixture to the reactor are 100 - 110 cm{sup 3 }/min at room temperature and atmospheric pressure (SCCM). The temperature of the reactor is controlled in an oven at 125 - 155 C. The pressure of the reactor is maintained at 28 - 127 psia. The following results were obtained based on experimental data generated from the differential reactor system, and their interpretations, (1) Concentration of moisture and concentrations of both H{sub 2 }S and SO{sub 2 } appear to affect slightly reaction rates of H{sub 2 }S with SO{sub 2 } over the moisture range of 2. 5 - 13. 6 v% moisture at 140 C and 120 - 123 psia. (2) Concentrations of both H{sub 2 }S and SO{sub 2 } appear to affect slightly reaction rates of H{sub 2 }S with SO{sub 2 } over the temperature range of 135 - 145 C at 5 -v% moisture and 112 - 123 psia. However, reaction rates of H{sub 2 }S with SO{sub 2 } appear to decrease slightly with increased reaction temperatures over the temperature range of 135 - 145 C at 5 -v% moisture and 112 - 123 psia. (3) Concentrations of both H{sub 2 }S and SO{sub 2 } appear to affect slightly reaction rates of H{sub 2 }S with SO{sub 2 } over the pressure range of 28 - 123 psia at 5 -v% moisture and 140 C.

40|$|We {{propose a}} novel 3 D neural network {{architecture}} for 3 D hand pose estimation {{from a single}} depth image. Different from previous works that mostly run on 2 D depth image domain and require intermediate or post process {{to bring in the}} supervision from 3 D space, we convert the depth map to a 3 D <b>volumetric</b> representation, and <b>feed</b> it into a 3 D convolutional neural network(CNN) to directly produce the pose in 3 D requiring no further process. Our system does not require the ground truth reference point for initialization, and our network architecture naturally integrates both local feature and global context in 3 D space. To increase the coverage of the hand pose space of the training data, we render synthetic depth image by transferring hand pose from existing real image datasets. We evaluation our algorithm on two public benchmarks and achieve the state-of-the-art performance. The synthetic hand pose dataset will be available...|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of biomethane from biogas offers {{the possibility to}} obtain chemical resources fuels from combustion engines, gas turbine and fuel cells. However, each biomethane application requires specific treatment. This work {{is focused on the}} removal of CO 2 from biogas as a fundamental step in biogas treatment. A laboratory scale PSA unit is introduced in this paper. The extruded activated carbon was used to construct the fixed bed adsorption layer. The maximum sorption capacity of CO 2 was determined from the adsorption isotherm of pure CO 2 carried out in a high pressure thermogravimeter. Breakthrough curves of CO 2 and CH 4 were determined for different <b>volumetric</b> flows of <b>feed.</b> The results were applied for the optimisation of PSA time in order to maximalize the suppression of CO 2 from upgrading CH 4.

40|$|The {{recovery}} of toxic metal compounds {{is a deep}} concern in all industries. Hexavalent chromium is particularly worrying because of its toxic influence on human health. In this paper, biodegradation of hexavalent chromium (Cr+ 6) present in wastewater has been studied using two different bacterial strains; Pseudomonas sp. and Bacillus sp. A chemostat (with and without recycle of cells) with 10 L liquid culture volume was used to study the substrate and the biomass cell concentrations with time. Also, the degree of substrate conversion was studied by the varying the dilution rate as an independent parameter. The dilution rate (ratio of feed flow rate to the culture volume) was varied by varying the <b>feed</b> <b>volumetric</b> rate from 110 - 170 mL/h for inlet hexavalent chromium concentrations of 70 mg/dm 3. The results show that a chemostat with recycle gives a better performance in terms of substrate conversion than a chemostat without a recycle. Moreover, the degree of substrate conversion decreases as the dilution rate is increased. Also, Bacillus sp. was found to give higher conversions compared to pseudomonas sp...|$|R
40|$|Removal of {{hydrogen}} sulfide (H{sub 2 }S) from coal gasifier gas and sulfur recovery are key {{steps in the}} development of Department of Energy's (DOE's) advanced power plants that produce electric power and clean transportation fuels with coal and natural gas. These plants will require highly clean coal gas with H{sub 2 }S below 1 ppmv and negligible amounts of trace contaminants such as hydrogen chloride, ammonia, alkali, heavy metals, and particulate. The conventional method of sulfur removal and recovery employing amine, Claus, and tail-gas treatment is very expensive. A second generation approach developed under DOE's sponsorship employs hot-gas desulfurization (HGD) using regenerable metal oxide sorbents followed by Direct Sulfur Recovery Process (DSRP). However, this process sequence does not remove trace contaminants and is targeted primarily towards the development of advanced integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plants that produce electricity (not both electricity and transportation fuels). There is an immediate as well as long-term need for the development of cleanup processes that produce highly clean coal gas for next generation power plants. To this end, a novel process is now under development at several research organizations in which the H{sub 2 } in coal gas is directly oxidized to elemental sulfur over a selective catalyst. Such a process is ideally suited for coal gas from commercial gasifiers with a quench system to remove essentially all the trace contaminants except H{sub 2 }S In the Single-Step Sulfur Recovery Process (SSRP), the direct oxidation of H{sub 2 }S to elemental sulfur in the presence of SO{sub 2 } is ideally suited for coal gas from commercial gasifiers with a quench system to remove essentially all the trace contaminants except H{sub 2 }S. This direct oxidation process has the potential to produce a super clean coal gas more economically than both conventional amine-based processes and HGD/DSRP. The H{sub 2 } and CO components of syngas appear to behave as inert with respect to sulfur formed at the SSRP conditions. One problem in the SSRP process that needs to be eliminated or minimized is COS formation that may occur due to reaction of CO with sulfur formed from the Claus reaction. The objectives of this research are to formulate monolithic catalysts for removal of H{sub 2 }S from coal gases and minimum formation of COS with monolithic catalyst supports, {gamma}-alumina wash or carbon coats, and catalytic metals, to develop a catalytic regeneration method for a deactivated monolithic catalyst, to measure kinetics of both direct oxidation of H{sub 2 }S to elemental sulfur with SO{sub 2 } as an oxidizer and formation of COS {{in the presence of a}} simulated coal gas mixture containing H{sub 2 }, CO, CO{sub 2 }, and moisture, using a monolithic catalyst reactor, and to develop kinetic rate equations and model the direct oxidation process to assist in the design of large-scale plants. This heterogeneous catalytic reaction has gaseous reactants such as H{sub 2 }S and SO{sub 2 }. However, this heterogeneous catalytic reaction has heterogeneous products such as liquid elemental sulfur and steam. To achieve the above-mentioned objectives using a monolithic catalyst reactor, experiments on conversion {{of hydrogen}} sulfide into elemental sulfur and formation of COS were carried out for the space time range of 40 - 560 seconds at 120 - 150 C to evaluate effects of reaction temperatures, total pressure, space time, and catalyst regeneration on conversion of hydrogen sulfide into elemental sulfur and formation of COS. Simulated coal gas mixtures consist of 3, 600 - 4, 000 -ppmv hydrogen sulfide, 1, 800 - 2, 000 ppmv sulfur dioxide, 23 - 27 v% hydrogen, 36 - 41 v% CO, 10 - 12 v% CO{sub 2 }, 0 - 10 vol % moisture, and nitrogen as remainder. <b>Volumetric</b> <b>feed</b> rates of a simulated coal gas mixture to the reactor are 30 - 180 SCCM. The temperature of the reactor is controlled in an oven at 120 - 150 C. The pressure of the reactor is maintained at 40 - 210 psia. The molar ratio of H{sub 2 }S to SO{sub 2 } in the monolithic catalyst reactor is maintained approximately at 2 for all the reaction experiment runs...|$|R
40|$|Nectarivorous birds {{encounter}} varying nectar concentrations while foraging {{on different}} food plants and must adjust their consumption to maintain constant energy intake. We determined how rapidly captive whitebellied sunbirds (Cinnyris talatala) adjust their <b>volumetric</b> intake and <b>feeding</b> patterns after changes in diet concentration. On four consecutive days, birds were fed sucrose diets alternating between a standard diet of 16 % w/w and test diets of 2. 5, 8. 5, 16 or 30 % w/w, respectively, for 1. 5 h periods. Feeding events were recorded with an infrared photo-detection system and food intake and body mass were monitored continuously by electronic balances interfaced to a computer. Generally, birds demonstrated a measurable increase in feeding frequency and food intake within 10 min after {{a decrease in}} sucrose concentration. However, individuals responded differently to the most dilute diet (2. 5 %) : while most increased their food intake, others stopped feeding for a short while, appearing to dislike this diet. Furthermore, the number and duration of feeding events increased in the first 5 min after the switch from 2. 5 % back to 16 %, as the birds attempted to compensate for previous reduced sugar intake. Daily sugar intake was lower when birds alternated between 2. 5 and 16 % diets than on other test days, but birds were able to maintain body mass, presumably through behavioural adjustments...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to provide data on growth, {{feed conversion ratio}} (FCR) and faecal discharge of yellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi) fed three commercial diets used previously to culture this species in New Zealand. Fish were raised in tanks from 0. 4 to 1. 2 kg over the spring (water temperature 14 – 17 °C) and summer (17 – 22 °C) periods. There were considerable differences in <b>volumetric</b> and mass-specific <b>feed</b> intake, and energy intake amongst diets. Daily crude protein intake was similar amongst diets, although it increased from the cold (4. 05 – 4. 50 g protein kg– 1 day– 1) to warm period (6. 48 – 7. 67 g protein kg– 1 day– 1). The biological and economical FCR varied with diet (BFCR 1. 22 – 2. 17, EFCR 1. 30 – 2. 62), as did the cost of feed per unit biomass produced (nz$ 2. 38 – 3. 78 kg– 1). Growth rates were broadly similar amongst diets, and the warmer summer temperature period greatly improved both growth (increase from 0. 51 – 0. 64 % to 1. 18 – 1. 23 % mass gain day– 1) and BFCR (decrease from 1. 37 – 2. 17 to 1. 22 – 1. 46). The Salmofood ESF diet resulted in {{only half of the}} faecal settleable solids and settleable total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) output compared with Skretting NME, which was in turn only half or less of that of Reliance SF...|$|R
40|$|Cenospheres are hollow spherical {{particles}} {{formed as}} part of the fly ash waste of coal-fired power stations. In a previous paper Kiani et al. (2015) investigated the recovery and the concentration of these particles using an Inverted Reflux Classifier (IRC) at a laboratory scale, of cross-section 0. 100 m x 0. 086 m, achieving a throughput advantage over a conventional fluidized bed by a factor of 54. The present paper investigated the potential to achieve scale-up, utilizing a pilot scale device with cross-section 0. 3 m x 0. 3 m. The product grade and recovery were examined {{as a function of the}} solids yield by varying the product volumetric rate relative to the <b>feed</b> <b>volumetric</b> rate. The performance data were compared directly with those obtained at the smaller laboratory scale. Agreement was excellent. The performance was also examined as a function of the feed slurry flux, with good agreement again evident at the laboratory and pilot scales. Overall, the separation performance was excellent, with a cenosphere recovery of about 80 % achievable at a high upgrade of 19 while a recovery of 75 % was achieved at an upgrade of 38. Here the feed solids flux was 4. 2 t/(m²h). It is noted that much higher upgrade was achieved at a recovery of about 80 % in the former study by operating at a lower solids feed flux. This paper provides the necessary basis for proceeding with a full scale implementation of this technology...|$|R
