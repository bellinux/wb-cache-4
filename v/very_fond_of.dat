Braun's dogs and Blondi's puppies were shot on 30 April by Hitler's dog handler, Fritz Tornow.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his success}} with the Brewers, the team was {{struggling}} and not likely to make a playoff run. When talks on a contract extension broke down, the team traded Greinke to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on July 27 in exchange for top infield prospect Jean Segura and pitchers Ariel Peña and Johnny Hellweg. Brewers General Manager Doug Melvin remarked {{that it was one}} of the tougher decisions he had to make because he was <b>very</b> <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> Greinke.|$|E

6000|$|Merton's idea of {{the young}} lady rose many degrees. 'You said the young lady was [...] "strange from a child, <b>very</b> strange. <b>Fond</b> <b>of</b> the men." [...] Happily for our sex, and for the world, {{it is not so}} very strange or unusual to take pity on us.' ...|$|R

5|$|Other mammals can be destructive. Possums {{tend not}} to eat {{the leaves of the}} tree, but are <b>very</b> <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> eating the sugar-rich {{flowering}} stalks as they emerge. They also like using the tree as a sleeping place. Rabbits can be more destructive, especially during periods of drought, when they have been seen to eat through the base until a tree falls, and then eating the fallen tree completely. Horses can also fell a tree by eating through the trunk.|$|E
5|$|As for hobbies, Vargas Llosa is <b>very</b> <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> {{association}} football, and is {{a renowned}} supporter of Universitario de Deportes.

In February 2011, Vargas Llosa was awarded with an honorary life membership of this football club, in a ceremony which took place in the Monumental Stadium of Lima.|$|E
5|$|Daniel Solander {{was living}} in Linnaeus' house during his time as a student in Uppsala.

6000|$|... "Don't you despise me, Rilla-my-Rilla?" [...] asked Walter wistfully. Somehow, it {{hurt him}} to think Rilla might despise him--hurt {{him as much as}} if it had been Di.

[...] "Next day we flew hundreds of troops back to England, some of whom hadn't had leave for five years. I was navigator, so I kept passing round notes telling them where we were. It was very emotional when we came over the white cliffs of Dover {{and you could see}} all the bonfires down below. I have <b>very</b> <b>fond</b> memories <b>of</b> that." ...|$|R
5|$|The case of Claudius' {{poisoning}} is more complex. Claudius {{was known}} to have been <b>very</b> <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> eating Caesar's mushroom. Following his death, many sources have attributed it to his being fed a meal of death caps instead of Caesar's mushrooms. Ancient authors, such as Tacitus and Suetonius, are unanimous about poison having been added to the mushroom dish, rather than the dish having been prepared from poisonous mushrooms. Wasson speculated the poison used to kill Claudius was derived from death caps, with a fatal dose of an unknown poison (possibly a variety of nightshade) being administered later during his illness.|$|E
5|$|The yellow-tailed black {{cockatoo}} is <b>very</b> <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> {{the larvae}} of tree-boring beetles, {{such as the}} longhorn beetle Tryphocaria acanthocera, and cossid moth Xyleutes boisduvali. Birds seek them out all year but especially in June and July, when the moth caterpillars are largest, and they are accompanied by their just fledged young. They search out holes and make some exploratory bites looking for larvae. If successful, they peel and tear down a strip of bark to make a perch for themselves before continuing to gouge and excavate the larvae, which have deeply tunneled into the heartwood.|$|E

He was followed by the devotees, who carried the clay image of Kali to be immersed in the Ganges after the night of worship. Ramprasad waded into the holy river, until the water was neck deep, all the while singing for Kali. As Kali's image was immersed, Ramprasad died— this was believed to be around 1775.|$|E

Those who are <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> fun and danger should come with our great chief Chingatok--huk! Let us divide." ...|$|R
5|$|Escher, who {{had been}} <b>very</b> <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> and {{inspired}} by the landscapes in Italy, was decidedly unhappy in Switzerland. In 1937, the family moved again, to Uccle (Ukkel), a suburb of Brussels, Belgium. World War II forced them to move in January 1941, this time to Baarn, Netherlands, where Escher lived until 1970. Most of Escher's best-known works date from this period. The sometimes cloudy, cold and wet weather of the Netherlands allowed him to focus intently on his work. After 1953, Escher lectured widely. A planned series of lectures in North America in 1962 was cancelled after an illness, and he stopped creating artworks for a time, but the illustrations and text for the lectures were later published {{as part of the}} book Escher on Escher. He was awarded the Knighthood of the Order of Orange-Nassau in 1955.|$|E
5|$|Wambui {{subsequently}} bore another son, Kongo, but Muigai died shortly after. In {{keeping with}} Kikuyu tradition, Wambui was then {{married to her}} late husband's younger brother, Ngengi. Kenyatta was then given the name of Kamau wa Ngengi ("Kamau, son of Ngengi"). Wambui bore her new husband a son, whom they also named Muigai. Ngengi was harsh and resentful toward these three boys, with Wambui deciding to take her youngest son with her {{to stay with her}} parental family further north. It was there that she died, and Kenyatta—who was <b>very</b> <b>fond</b> <b>of</b> the younger Muigai—travelled through the forest to collect his infant half-brother. Kenyatta then moved in with his grandfather, Kongo wa Magana, and assisted the latter in his role as a medicine man.|$|E

50|$|With schoolmate Gagi Mihajlović, Mladenović {{formed a}} band called Limunovo drvo (Lemon Tree) that dabbled in melodic hard rock.

"I have <b>very</b> <b>fond</b> {{memories}} <b>of</b> the Toronto Star," [...] Shuster told Star reporter Henry Mietkiewicz for a {{story that}} ran on April 26, 1992, three months before Shuster died in Los Angeles. [...] "I still remember drawing {{one of the earliest}} panels that showed the newspaper building. We needed a name, and I spontaneously remembered the Toronto Star. So that's the way I lettered it. I decided to do it that way {{on the spur of the}} moment, because the Star was such a great influence on my life." ...|$|R
