40|$|BACKGROUND: Recently {{we showed}} the {{predictive}} value of sum absolute QRST integral (SAI QRST) and repolarization lability for risk stratification of {{sudden cardiac death}} (SCD) in heart failure patients. The goal {{of this study was}} to compare SAI QRST and metrics of depolarization and repolarization variability in healthy men and women. METHODS: Orthogonal ECGs were recorded at rest for 10 minutes in 160 healthy men and women (mean age 39. 6 ± 14. 6, 80 men). Mean spatial TT' angle, and normalized variances of T loop area, of spatial T <b>vector</b> <b>amplitude,</b> of QT interval and Tpeak-Tend area were measured for assessment of repolarization lability. Normalized variances of spatial QRS vector and QRS loop area characterized variability of depolarization. In addition, variability indices (VI) were calculated to adjust for normalized heart rate variance. SAI QRST was measured as the averaged arithmetic sum of areas under the QRST curve. RESULTS: Men were characterized by shorter QTc (430. 3 ± 21. 7 vs. 444. 7 ± 22. 2 ms; P< 0. 0001) and larger SAI QRST (282. 1 ± 66. 7 vs. 204. 9 ± 58. 5 mV*ms; P< 0. 0001). Repolarization lability negatively correlated with spatial T <b>vector</b> <b>amplitude.</b> Adjusted by normalized heart rate variance, QT variability index was significantly higher in women than in men (- 1. 54 ± 0. 38 vs. - 1. 70 ± 0. 33; P =  0. 017).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new open-loop architecture for three-phase grid synchronization based on moving average and predictive filters, where accurate measurements of phase, frequency, and amplitude {{are carried out}} in real time. Previous works establish that the fundamental positive sequence vector {{of a set of}} utility voltage/current vectors can be decoupled using Park's transformation and low-pass filters. However, the filtering process introduces delays that impair the system performance. More specifically, when the input signal frequency is shifted above the nominal, a nonzero average steady-state phase error appears in the measurements. To overcome such limitations, a suitable combination of predictive and moving average finite impulse response (FIR) filters is used by the authors to achieve a robust synchronization system for all input frequencies. Moving average filters are linear phase FIR filters that have a constant time delay at low frequencies, a characteristic that is exploited to good effect to design a predictive filter that compensates such time delays, enabling zero steady-state phase errors for shifted input frequencies. In summary, the main attributes of the new system are its good frequency adaptation, good filtering/transient response tradeoff, and the fact that its dynamics is independent of the input <b>vector</b> <b>amplitude.</b> Comprehensive experimental results validate the theoretical approach and the high performance of the proposed synchronization algorith...|$|E

We {{make use of the}} large data base on open clusters completed by our group to derive the observed velocity <b>vector</b> (<b>amplitude</b> and direction) of the clusters in the Galactic plane. In the epicycle approximation, this velocity is equal to the circular velocity given by the rotation curve, plus a residual or perturbation velocity, of which the direction rotates as a function of time with the frequency kappa. Due to the non-random direction of the perturbation velocity at the birth time of the clusters, a plot of the present-day direction angle of this velocity {{as a function of the}} age of the clusters reveals systematic trends from which the epicycle frequency can be obtained. Our analysis considers that the Galactic potential is mainly axis-symmetric, or in other words, that the effect of the spiral arms on the Galactic orbits is small; in this sense, our results do not depend on any specific model of the spiral structure.
