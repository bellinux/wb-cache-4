It is also the continuous distribution with the maximum entropy for a specified mean and variance.

2500|$|The 1917–20 {{series was}} {{perforated}} 11 and included all the denominations {{found in the}} two preceding series, but added three new Franklin-heads of 13-cents, 2 and 5-dollars. The two higher denominations appeared late in this issue as the Bureau of Engraving and Printing was busy replacing worn printing plates and dealing with various experiments and innovations that delayed production of the 2 & 5 dollar plates. Perhaps to identify these stamps as luxury items, they were printed in two tones, with the vignette head in black and the frame in color. They were further distinguished from lower values by their use of landscape format rather than the normal portrait orientation. Because the 2 & 5 dollar Franklin-head stamps were the two largest denominations they are often referred to by collectors as the 'Big Bens'. The 2-dollar Franklin {{was intended to be}} printed in carmine-red and black, but somehow the color of the printing ink from the particular lot that was used turned out to have a distinct orange tone. [...] in printing ink is somewhat common in stamp production, but the variance in this case ventured into a different color completely—orange. By the time this acute color <b>variance</b> <b>was</b> {{brought to the attention of}} officials a good number of sheets had already been distributed among the various post offices and were most likely already in circulation. In 1920 a second printing of the 2-dollar Franklin was issued, this time with the colors that were originally intended, carmine-red and black. These were printed and remained in use for some 3 to 4 years and therefore quantities of the red and black variety out number the orange and black approximately 15 to 1. Quantities issued are, for 2-dollar orange and black, 47,700 (470 sheets of 100), and 2-dollar carmine-red and black, 743,600 (7,436 sheets of 100).|$|E
