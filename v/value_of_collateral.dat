2500|$|The {{effect of}} a {{bankruptcy}} discharge is to eliminate only the debtor's personal liability, not the in rem liability for a secured debt {{to the extent of}} the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>collateral.</b> The term [...] "in rem" [...] essentially means [...] "with respect to the thing itself" [...] (i.e., the collateral). For example, if a debt in the amount of $100,000 is secured by property having a value of only $80,000, the $20,000 deficiency is treated, in bankruptcy, as an unsecured claim (even though it's part of a [...] "secured" [...] debt). The $80,000 portion of the debt is treated as a secured claim. Assuming a discharge is granted and none of the $20,000 deficiency is paid (e.g., due to insufficiency of funds), the $20,000 deficiency—the debtor's personal liability—is discharged (assuming the debt is not non-dischargeable under another Bankruptcy Code provision). The $80,000 portion of the debt is the in rem liability, and it is not discharged by the court's discharge order. This liability can presumably be satisfied by the creditor taking the asset itself. An essential concept is that when commentators say that a debt is [...] "dischargeable," [...] they are referring only to the debtor's personal liability on the debt. To the extent that a liability is covered by the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>collateral,</b> the debt is not discharged.|$|E

He finds that the lender will not advance to the borrower a loan that exceeds the market <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the <b>collateral,</b> and that the supply of loans increases with a rise in the market <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the <b>collateral.</b> Increases in the volatility <b>of</b> the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the <b>collateral,</b> interest rate, and dividend rate <b>of</b> the <b>collateral</b> independently depress the loan supply.

50|$|The Amsterdam banking {{crisis of}} 1763 in the Netherlands {{followed}} {{the end of}} the Seven Years' War. At this time prices of grain and other commodities were falling sharply, and the supply of credit dried up due to the decreased <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> goods. Many of the banks based in Amsterdam were over-leveraged and were interlinked by complex financial instruments, making them vulnerable to a sudden tightening of credit availability. The crisis was marked by the failure of one large bank - that of De Neufville - and many smaller financial enterprises. The extent of the crisis was mitigated by the provision of extra liquidity by the Bank of Amsterdam, the Dutch central bank. Similarities have been identified between these events and the financial crisis of 2007-2008.|$|E
50|$|The {{initial margin}} {{requirement}} {{is the amount}} of collateral required to open a position. Thereafter, the collateral required until the position is closed is the maintenance requirement. The maintenance requirement is the minimum amount of collateral required to keep the position open and is generally lower than the initial requirement. This allows the price to move against the margin without forcing a margin call immediately after the initial transaction. When the total <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> after haircuts dips below the maintenance margin requirement, the position holder must pledge additional collateral to bring their total balance after haircuts back up to or above the initial margin requirement. On instruments determined to be especially risky, however, the regulators, the exchange, or the broker may set the maintenance requirement higher than normal or equal to the initial requirement to reduce their exposure to the risk accepted by the trader. For speculative futures and derivatives clearing accounts, futures commission merchants may charge a premium or margin multiplier to exchange requirements. This is typically an additional 10%-25%.|$|E

50|$|In 2013 Beverly Loan Company {{claimed that}} more than 90% of clients that provide {{collateral}} for loans return to redeem their collateral. Other clients sell their merchandise outright instead of taking a loan, which Beverly Loan Company then puts up for sale.

Merchandise sold by Beverly Loan Company can be purchased in excess of one million dollars off of the retail price. While some clients take loans from the company due to their poor credit, others take loans from the company in order to receive the funds more quickly than they could from their bank. Items used as collateral are held for four months before they are offered for sale.

50|$|Such {{a problem}} of {{excessive}} borrowing rooted on the pecuniary externality and market incompleteness can be much more severe when some financial amplification mechanism is present: For example, some negative shocks on the aggregate demand {{could lead to the}} real depreciation and the fall of domestic asset prices, which brings about the incipient adverse balance sheet effects that decrease the firm net worth and <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>collateral.</b> Consequently, the shrink of collateral value further constrains the private agents’ accesses to external borrowing through the binding borrowing constraint, which in turn results in the economy-wise spending cut and initial aggregate demand contraction is thus amplified. As shown in the graph depicting such a loop of effects, it is even striking that adverse shock on any step of this feedback loop could trigger this amplification of initial negative effects. Hence the overly large inflow of capital would potentially create a systemic risk and activate the amplification mechanism, which ultimately would generate large business cycle volatility, sudden collapse of the financial system and the economic recessions only given such a small incipient adverse shock on the feedback loop.|$|E
40|$|If a {{borrower}} defaults on a loan, a bank’s recovery {{may depend}} {{on the value of}} the loan collateral. The <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>collateral,</b> like the value of other assets, fluctuates with economic conditions. If the economy experiences a downturn, a bank can experience a double misfortune: many obligors default, and the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> is damaged. Conventional credit models overlook the effect of economic conditions on collateral. They allow default to vary from year to year, but they hold fixed the average <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> and the average level of recovery. The distinctive feature of the credit model presented here is that an economic downturn causes damage to the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>collateral.</b> When systematic collateral damage enters the credit model, the capital allocated to a highly collateralised loan can double or triple. 1 Taking collateral damage into account complicates a credit capital model. However, the results of the model can be well approximated by a function of expected loss alone. Expected loss can therefore be used as the basis of a credit capital estimate. This estimate is simpler, and can be more accurate than using the results of a conventional credit model that ignores the role of collateral damage. Credit capital model The credit capital model uses the conditional approach suggested by Finger (1999) and Gordy (2000). The variables in the model depend on a systematic risk factor, a random variable representing the good years and bad years of the economy. The co-variation between two variables stems from their mutual dependence on the systematic factor. Two variables that relate strongly to the systematic factor relate strongly to each other and therefore have a strong correlation. Exposure of $ 1 is assumed to each obligor j. At the end of a one-year analysis horizon, the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> is a random number characterised by three positive parameters: its amount, mj; its volatility, sj; and its sensitivity to X, the systematic risk factor, also known as its “loading”, qj: Collateral = µ 1 + σ...|$|E

5000|$|The broker may at {{any time}} revise the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the <b>collateral</b> {{securities}} (margin), based, for example, on market factors. If this results in the market <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the <b>collateral</b> securities for a margin account falling below the revised margin, the broker or exchange immediately issues a [...] "margin call", requiring the investor to bring the margin account back into line. To do so, the investor must either pay funds (the call) into the margin account, provide additional collateral or dispose some of the securities. If the investor fails to bring the account back into line, the broker can sell the investor's collateral securities to bring the account back into line.|$|R

30|$|For {{rates at}} higher {{maturities}} the two speeds of adjustment coefficients are {{not significantly different}} from each other.

40|$|House {{prices and}} {{exchange}} rates can potentially amplify the expansionary effect of capital inflows by inflating the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>collateral.</b> We first {{set up a}} model of collateralized borrowing in domestic and foreign currency with international financial intermediation in which a change in leverage of global intermediaries leads to an international credit supply increase. In this environment, we illustrate how house price increases and exchange rates appreciations contribute to fueling the boom by inflating the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>collateral.</b> We then document empirically, in a Panel VAR model for 50 advanced and emerging countries estimated with quarterly data from 1985 to 2012, that {{an increase in the}} leverage of US Broker-Dealers also leads to an increase in cross-border credit flows, a house price and consumption boom, a real exchange rate appreciation and a current account deterioration consistent with the transmission in the model. Finally, we study the sensitivity of the consumption and asset price response to such a shock and show that country differences are associated with the level of the maximum loan-to-value ratio and the share of foreign currency denominated credit...|$|E
40|$|Credit risk models should re ect the {{observation}} that the relevant <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> is generally not the average value of the asset over all possible states of nature. In most cases, the relevant <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> for the lender is its secondary market value in bad states of nature, where marginal utilities are high. Although the negative correlation between recovery rates and default probabilities is well documented, the majority of pricing models {{does not allow for}} correlation between the two. In this paper, we propose a relatively parsimonious reduced-form continuous time model that estimates expected recovery rates and default probabilities from the term structure of CDS spreads. The parameters of the model and latent factors driving recovery risk and default risk are estimated using a Bayesian MCMC algorithm. We find that the Bayesian deviance information criterion (DIC) favors the model with stochastic recovery over constant recovery. We also observe that for companies with a good rating, implied constant recovery rates do not di er much from stochastic recovery. However, if a company is very risky, then forward stochastic recovery rates are signicantly lower at longer maturities...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{possibility}} of the simultaneous presence of three key features in price-taking credit markets: infinity horizon, collateralized credit operations and effective additional enforcement mechanisms, i. e. those implying payments besides the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the <b>collateral</b> guarantees. We show that these additional mechanisms, instead of strengthening, actually weaken the restrictions that collateral places on borrowing. In fact, when collateral requirements are not large enough in relation to the effectiveness of the additional mechanisms, lenders anticipate total payments exceeding the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the <b>collateral</b> requirements. Thus, by non-arbitrage, they lend more than the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> these guarantees. In turn, in the absence of other market frictions such as borrowing constraints, agents may indefinitely postpone their debts, implying the collapse of the agent's maximization problem and of such credit markets. ...|$|R

As a consequence, the small open economy is vunerable to the bubble emergence. Crucially for the policy-making, the credit constraint plays a double-bladed role in the bubble emergence. That is, with the natural credit limit which is evaluated at the fundamental <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the <b>collateral,</b> a bubble cannot exist; while, if the …nancial intermediary sets the credit limit at the expected <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the <b>collateral,</b> the credit constraint instead helps support the bubble.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a theory of}} “infectious leverage ” in financial markets in which the lender’s payoff depends heavily on the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the <b>collateral</b> backing the loan. There are two main results. First, leverage is an “infectious ” phenomenon in that high leverage among borrowers also leads to high leverage among lenders. There is thus a multiplicative effect of leverage on {{the fragility of the}} financial system. Second, there is an externality in bank leverage in that a bank’s exposure to credit risk depends on the leverage decisions of other banks and banks choose privately-optimal leverage ratios that are higher than what is socially optimal. The model has an overlapping generations setting in which banks make one-period mortgage loans in the first period that are secured by collateral, and the analysis solves for the equilibrium in the housing market, so the current house price and the distribution of future house prices are both endogenous. The prices of houses and hence the second-period <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> depend on the supply of loans in the second period, which then determines the ability of second-generation borrowers to raise financing to purchase houses in the second period. Thus, if banks are hit with second-period liquidity shocks that diminish aggregate credit availability in the second period, collateral values fall...|$|R
