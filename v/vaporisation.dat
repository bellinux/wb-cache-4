5|$|All four stable halogens {{experience}} intermolecular van der Waals {{forces of}} attraction, and their strength increases together with number of electrons among all homonuclear diatomic halogen molecules. Thus, the melting and boiling points of bromine are intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine. As {{a result of}} the increasing molecular weight of the halogens down the group, the density and heats of fusion and <b>vaporisation</b> of bromine are again intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine, although all their heats of <b>vaporisation</b> are fairly low (leading to high volatility) thanks to their diatomic molecular structure. The halogens darken in colour as the group is descended: fluorine is a very pale yellow gas, chlorine is greenish-yellow, and bromine is a reddish-brown volatile liquid that melts at −7.2°C and boils at 58.8°C. (Iodine is a shiny black solid.) This trend occurs because the wavelengths of visible light absorbed by the halogens increase down the group. Specifically, the colour of a halogen, such as bromine, results from the electron transition between the highest occupied antibonding πg molecular orbital and the lowest vacant antibonding σu molecular orbital. The colour fades at low temperatures, so that solid bromine at −195°C is pale yellow.|$|E

5|$|The {{alkali metals}} are {{more similar to}} each other than the {{elements}} in any other group are to each other. For instance, when moving down the table, all known alkali metals show increasing atomic radius, decreasing electronegativity, increasing reactivity, and decreasing melting and boiling points as well as heats of fusion and <b>vaporisation.</b> In general, their densities increase when moving down the table, with the exception that potassium is less dense than sodium.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} are {{more similar to}} each other than the {{elements}} in any other group are to each other. Indeed, the similarity {{is so great that}} it is quite difficult to separate potassium, rubidium, and caesium, due to their similar ionic radii; lithium and sodium are more distinct. For instance, when moving down the table, all known alkali metals show increasing atomic radius, decreasing electronegativity, increasing reactivity, and decreasing melting and boiling points as well as heats of fusion and <b>vaporisation.</b> In general, their densities increase when moving down the table, with the exception that potassium is less dense than sodium. One of the very few properties of the alkali metals that does not display a very smooth trend is their reduction potentials: lithium's value is anomalous, being more negative than the others. This is because the Li+ ion has a very high hydration energy in the gas phase: though the lithium ion disrupts the structure of water significantly, causing a higher change in entropy, this high hydration energy is enough to make the reduction potentials indicate it as being the most electropositive alkali metal, despite the difficulty of ionising it in the gas phase.|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} and chemical properties of the alkali metals can be readily explained by their having an ns1 valence electron configuration, which results in weak metallic bonding. Hence, all the alkali metals are soft and have low densities, melting and boiling points, as well as heats of sublimation, <b>vaporisation,</b> and dissociation. They all crystallise in the body-centered cubic crystal structure, and have distinctive flame colours because their outer s electron is very easily excited. The ns1 configuration also results in the alkali metals having very large atomic and ionic radii, as well as very high thermal and electrical conductivity. Their chemistry is dominated by the loss of their lone valence electron in the outermost s-orbital to form the +1 oxidation state, due to the ease of ionising this electron and the very high second ionisation energy. Most of the chemistry has been observed only for the first five members of the group. The chemistry of francium is not well established due to its extreme radioactivity; thus, the presentation of its properties here is limited. What little is known about francium shows that it is very close in behaviour to caesium, as expected. The physical properties of francium are even sketchier because the bulk element has never been observed; hence any data that may be found in the literature are certainly speculative extrapolations.|$|E

25|$|Silicon crystallises {{in a giant}} {{covalent}} structure at standard conditions, {{specifically in}} a diamond cubic lattice. It thus has a high melting point of 1414°C. It is not known to have any allotropes at standard pressure, but several other crystal structures are known at higher pressures. The general trend is one of increasing coordination number with pressure, culminating in a hexagonal close-packed allotrope at about 40gigapascals known as Si–VII (the standard modification being Si–I). Silicon boils at 3265°C: this, while high, is still lower than the temperature at which its lighter congener carbon sublimes (3642°C) and silicon similarly has a lower heat of <b>vaporisation</b> than carbon, consistent {{with the fact that}} the Si–Si bond is weaker than the C–C bond.|$|E
500|$|Industrially, ammonia (NH3) is {{the most}} {{important}} compound of nitrogen and is prepared in larger amounts than any other compound, because it contributes significantly to the nutritional needs of terrestrial organisms by serving as a precursor to food and fertilisers. It is a colourless alkaline gas with a characteristic pungent smell. The presence of hydrogen bonding has very significant effects on ammonia, conferring on it its high melting (−78°C) and boiling (−33°C) points. As a liquid, it is a very good solvent with a high heat of <b>vaporisation</b> (enabling it to be used in vacuum flasks), that also has a low viscosity and electrical conductivity and high dielectric constant, and is less dense than water. However, the hydrogen bonding in NH3 is weaker than that in H2O due to the lower electronegativity of nitrogen compared to oxygen and the presence of only one lone pair in NH3 rather than two in H2O. It is a weak base in aqueous solution (pK'b 4.74); its conjugate acid is ammonium, [...] It can also act as an extremely weak acid, losing a proton to produce the amide anion, [...] It thus undergoes self-dissociation, similar to water, to produce ammonium and amide. Ammonia burns in air or oxygen, though not readily, to produce nitrogen gas; it burns in fluorine with a greenish-yellow flame to give nitrogen trifluoride. Reactions with the other nonmetals are very complex and tend to lead to a mixture of products. Ammonia reacts on heating with metals to give nitrides.|$|E

60|$|The {{observations}} for temperature {{were taken}} with every precaution to avoid radiation, and the thermometers were constantly {{compared with a}} standard, and the errors allowed for. The maximum thermometer with a steel index, I found to be extremely liable to derangement and very difficult to re-adjust. Negretti's maximum thermometer was not known to me during my journey. The spirit minimum thermometers again, are easily set to rights when out of order, but in every one (of six or seven) which I took to India, by several makers, the zero point receded, the error in some increasing annually, even to-6 degrees in two years. This seems due to a <b>vaporisation</b> of the spirit within the tube. I have seen a thermometer of this description in India, of which the spirit seemed to have retired wholly into the bulb, and which I was assured had never been injured. In wet-bulb observations, distilled water or rain, or snow water was used, but I never found the result to differ from that obtained by any running fresh water, except such as was polluted to the taste and eye.|$|E

50|$|Acoustic {{cavitation}} can {{be predicted}} theoretically through {{the calculation of}} acoustic pressure and where this pressure is low enough, the liquid can reach its <b>vaporisation</b> pressure. This results in localised <b>vaporisation</b> of the liquid, forming small bubbles; these collapse quickly and with tremendous energy and turbulence, generating heat {{on the order of}} 5000K and pressures of the order of several atmospheres. At lower intensity levels, this rapid pressure change is enough to create small movements of the surrounding water, making it extremely difficult for marine life to firmly attach to a surface. Research has also shown that low-intensity ultrasound has an effect on behaviour of some species without inducing cavitation, such as inhibiting the settlement of barnacle cyprids.|$|E

5000|$|Evaporative coolers, {{sometimes}} called [...] "swamp coolers", {{do not have}} a compressor or condenser. Liquid water is evaporated on the cooling fins, releasing the vapor into the cooled area. Evaporating water absorbs a significant amount of heat, the latent heat of <b>vaporisation,</b> cooling the air. Humans and animals use the same mechanism to cool themselves by sweating.|$|E
50|$|Absorption of {{the laser}} {{radiation}} is substantially influenced by {{the temperature of the}} workpiece surface. Before the laser welding process can start, the initial reflectance must be overcome, especially on aluminum surfaces. This can be achieved by preheating the material. In the hybrid process, the arc heats the metal, helping the laser beam to couple in. After the <b>vaporisation</b> temperature has been reached, the vapor cavity is formed, and nearly all radiation energy can be put into the workpiece. The energy required for this is thus determined by the temperature-dependent absorption and by the amount of energy lost by conduction into the rest of the workpiece. In Laser Hybrid welding, using MIG, <b>vaporisation</b> takes place not only {{from the surface of the}} workpiece but also from the filler wire, so that more metal vapor is available to facilitate the absorption {{of the laser}} radiation.|$|E
50|$|Trouton {{was born}} in Dublin on 24 November 1863, the {{youngest}} son of the wealthy and prominent Thomas Trouton. He attended Royal School Dungannon {{and went on to}} Trinity College, Dublin in 1884, where he studied engineering and physical science. While still an undergraduate student, Trouton observed a relationship between boiling points and energies of vaporisations, which he presented in two short papers. He found the change of entropy per mole for <b>vaporisation</b> at a boiling point is constant, or expressed mathematically ΔSm,vap = 10.5 R (where R is the ideal gas constant). This became known as Trouton's Rule and, despite having some exceptions, is used to estimate the enthalpy of <b>vaporisation</b> of liquids whose boiling points are known. Trouton himself belittled his discovery as it was merely the result of an afternoon's manipulation of data from a book of tables. Before graduating he also took a leading role in surveying for a railway.|$|E
50|$|All Li-ion cells expand at {{high levels}} of state of charge (SOC) or over-charge, due to slight <b>vaporisation</b> of the electrolyte. This may result in delamination, and thus bad contact of the {{internal}} layers of the cell, which in turn brings diminished reliability and overall cycle life of the cell. This is very noticeable for LiPos, which can visibly inflate {{due to lack of}} a hard case to contain their expansion.|$|E
50|$|Condensing boilers are {{water heaters}} fueled by gas or oil. They achieve high {{efficiency}} (typically greater than 90% on the higher heating value) by condensing water vapour in the exhaust gases and so recovering its latent heat of <b>vaporisation,</b> which {{would otherwise have}} been wasted. This condensed vapour leaves the system in liquid form, via a drain. In many countries, the use of condensing boilers is compulsory or encouraged with financial incentives.|$|E

50|$|Many of the {{anomalous}} {{properties of}} water {{compared to the}} rest of the hydrogen chalcogenides may be attributed to significant hydrogen bonding between hydrogen and oxygen atoms. Some of these properties are the high melting and boiling points (it is a liquid at room temperature), as well as the high dielectric constant and observable ionic dissociation. Hydrogen bonding in water also results in large values of heat and entropy of <b>vaporisation,</b> surface tension, and viscosity.|$|E
50|$|In most {{familiar}} engines, this water is circulated {{from the hot}} parts of the engine to a radiator, where it gives up its heat to the air. In these early and low powered engines with hopper cooling, there is little circulation. Water is instead slowly boiled off, the heat of <b>vaporisation</b> needed to boil the water coming from the engine heat. The loss of heat with this departing water vapour is enough to cool the engine.|$|E
