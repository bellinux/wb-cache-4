5000|$|Port wine vines {{need to grow}} in schist rich {{soil and}} require a {{specific}} micro-climate. It is produced through a unique <b>vinification</b> <b>method.</b> The red varietals are the most common. The wine is produced in the beautiful landscape of the Douro Valley in Alto Douro region, a region that is classified as World Heritage by UNESCO. The wine is exported {{from the city of}} Porto, thus acquiring the name Porto (or [...] "Port" [...] in English-speaking countries). There are several varieties of Port wine: {{some of the most popular}} are the Tawny, White, Ruby, and Late Bottled Vintage (L.B.V.).|$|E

Dissertations, Academic [...] University of Missouri [...] Columbia [...] Food science. Grape pomace by-products, from wine-making, have some beneficial antioxidant compounds left in them after vinification and could be a cheap source of these compounds for value added products. One of the most common antioxidant groups found in grapes are the phenols. These antioxidants have the potential to reduce cardiovascular disease, prevent some cancers, have chemoprotective roles, reduce signs of skin aging, aid in glucose transport, and prevent other diseases such as iron storage disease (ISD). In this research, five Missouri red wine pomace samples were evaluated; Chambourcin, Grenache, Michigan, Norton and Vincent varieties. They were analyzed for total phenolic content using the Folin-Ciocalteu assay, total condensed tannin content using the Vanillin-HCl assay, procyanidin degree of polymerization using normal-phase HPLC, iron-binding potential using the iron-binding phenolic capacity assay, and antioxidant activity using the ABTS and ORAC assays. The results showed that the <b>vinification</b> <b>method</b> applied to the grape variety greatly affected the pomace properties and composition. Red wine pomace, produced from lightly pressed grapes, has higher phenolic and antioxidant activities. This type of pomace has the greatest potential for applications that will benefit animal and human health...|$|E
5|$|In 1942, the Comité Interprofessionnel du Vin de Champagne (CIVC) {{was formed}} {{with the purpose}} of {{protecting}} Champagne's reputation and marketing forces as well as setting up and monitoring regulations for vineyard production and <b>vinification</b> <b>methods.</b> Champagne is the only region that is permitted to exclude AOC or Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée from their labels.|$|R
50|$|The {{classification}} of wine {{can be done}} according to various methods including place of origin or appellation, <b>vinification</b> <b>methods</b> and style, sweetness and vintage, or variety used. Practices vary in different countries and regions of origin, and many practices have varied over time. Some classifications enjoy official protection by {{being part of the}} wine law in their country of origin, while others have been created by, for example, grower's organizations without such protection.|$|R
40|$|Two <b>vinification</b> <b>methods</b> {{involving}} {{different degrees}} of antioxidant protection of Falanghina must during prefermentative steps, and referred as HAMP (high antioxidant must protection) and LAMP (low antioxidant must protection), were compared in terms of fermentation performances of four different yeast strains, composition of the volatile fraction of wines {{at the end of}} alcoholic fermentation, and shelf life of wines during storage. The use of HAMP technology resulted in wines with lower volatile acidity and higher concentrations of medium-chain fatty acid ethyl esters, acetates, and volatile fatty acids. For two of the four strains a lower concentration of isoamyl alcohol was also observed. HAMP wines also revealed increased shelf life because of the higher concentration of odor active esters at the end of storage and better preservation of varietal aroma...|$|R
50|$|Drinking ákratos (undiluted) {{wine was}} {{considered}} a severe faux pas in ancient Greece, enough to characterize the drinker as a drunkard and someone who lacked restraint and principle. Ancient writers prescribed that a mixing ratio of 1:3 (wine to water) was optimal for long conversation, a ratio of 1:2 when fun was to be had, and 1:1 was really only suited for orgiastic revelry, to be indulged in very rarely, if at all. Since such mixtures would produce an unpalatable and watery drink if applied to most wines made in the modern style, this practice of the ancients has led to speculation that ancient wines might have been vinified to a high alcoholic degree and sugar content, e.g. by using dehydrated grapes, and could withstand dilution with water better. Such wines would have also withstood time and the vagaries of transportation much better. Nevertheless, the ancient writers offer scant details of ancient <b>vinification</b> <b>methods,</b> and therefore this theory, though plausible, remains unsupported by evidence.|$|R
40|$|Consumer {{demand for}} {{intensely}} coloured wines necessitates the systematic testing of pigment extraction in Sangiovese, a cul-tivar poor in easily extractable anthocyanins. Pre-fermentation (absent, cold soak pre-fermentation at 5 ◦C, cryomaceration by liquid N 2 addition), temperature (20 or 30 ◦C), and saignée were compared during vinification (800 kg). Concentrations of anthocyanins, non-anthocyanic flavonoids and SO 2 -resistant pigments were recorded daily. A semiparametric Bayesian model permitted the kinetic description and {{the comparison of}} sigmoidal- and exponential-like curves. In total anthocyanins, saignée at 30 ◦C yielded a significant gain, later lost at drawing off; cryomaceration had little effect and cold soak no effect at drawing off. Non-anthocyanic flavonoids increased steadily with saignée and at 30 ◦ C. SO 2 -resistant pigments were higher, particularly for the higher temperature/saignée combination. Using daily recordings, the model indicates turning points for concentration rise or fall, thus allowing a precise and detailed comparison of the <b>vinification</b> <b>methods.</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Wines may be {{classified}} by <b>vinification</b> <b>methods.</b> These include classifications such as red or white wine, sparkling, semi-sparkling or still, fortified and dessert wines. The color of wine is not {{determined by the}} juice of the grape, which is almost always clear, but rather by {{the presence or absence}} of the grape skin during fermentation. Grapes with colored juice, for example alicante bouchet, are known as teinturier. Red wine is made from red (or black) grapes, but its red color is bestowed by a process called maceration, whereby the skin is left in contact with the juice during fermentation. White wine can be made from any colour of grape as the skin is separated from the juice during fermentation. A white wine made from a very dark grape may appear pink or 'blush'. A form of Rosé is called Blanc de Noirs where the juice of red grapes are allowed contact with the skins for a very short time (usually only a couple of hours).|$|R
40|$|The volume, {{composition}} and organic load of wastewaters from five wineries producing white, rosé and red wines by thermovinification, {{as well as}} traditionally vinified red wines (75 000 hL to 240 000 hL wine), were studied {{in terms of the}} <b>vinification</b> <b>methods</b> used. Liquid-phase <b>vinifications</b> (white, rosé, thermovinification) produce wastewaters rich in sugars: 70 % of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) when the must is treated, and flows depend on the daily supply of grapes, representing 40 to 46 % of the annual volume of wastewaters during the first month of activity (September). In contrast,solid-phase vinifications do not produce large quantities of waste at harvest, and wastewaters produced mainly during devatting are characterised by a predominance of ethanol (≤ 75 % COD) and by staggered flows towards the second month (October), which are less intense (26. 7 to 33. 6 %) and more spread out. The specific pollution coefficients of liquid-phase vinifications (5. 18 to 6. 04 kg COD/t grapes) are greater than those of solid-phase vinifications (3. 82 kg COD/t grapes). The higher the winery’s liquid-phase vinification rate, the more the maximal monthly volume of waste will be intense and early. These results should contribute to the improved design and management of winery wastewater treatments...|$|R
40|$|Lactic acid {{bacteria}} {{populations of}} red wine samples from industrial fermentations, including two different <b>vinification</b> <b>methods</b> were studied. For this investigation, polymerase chain reaction–denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analysis was employed to supplement previous results that were obtained by culture-dependent methods. PCR-DGGE was aimed to study two targeted genes, 16 S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and rpoB, {{and the results were}} useful to evaluate the microbial populations in wine samples. Moreover, an improvement of a detection limit determined so far for DGGE analysis was obtained with the method described in this study, what made possible to identify lactic acid bacteria populations below 101 colony-forming unit/mL. The species Oenococcus oeni was the most frequently detected bacterium, but identifications close to species Oenococcus kitaharae and Lactococcus lactis that are not often found in wine were firstly identified in samples of this research. PCR-DGGE allowed to detect 9 out of 11 lactic acid bacteria species identified in this study (nine by PCR- 16 S rDNA/DGGE and four by PCR-rpoB/DGGE), while five species were detected using the modified de Man, Rogosa and Sharpe agar. Therefore, the two methods were demonstrated to be complementary. This finding suggests that analysis of the lactic acid bacteria population structure in wine should be carried out using both culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques with more than one primer pair. This work was supported by funding and predoctoral grant (BOR 6 March 2009) from the Government of La Rioja, the INIA project RTA 2007 - 00104 - 00 - 00 and the FEDER of the European Community and was made possible by the collaborating wineries.

40|$|Sensitive and {{selective}} methods {{were applied to}} the analysis of two batches of bottled wines. The relationship between the antioxidant activity, based on the reduction in Fremy's radical, vasodilation activity (batch 1 only), and phenolic content was investigated. Wines were selected to provide a range of origins, grape varieties and <b>vinification</b> <b>methods.</b> Batch 1 wines were sourced mainly from the Old World, while those in batch II were predominantly from the New World. The total phenolic content was determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu colorimetric assay and by the cumulative measurements obtained by HPLC. Total anthocyanins were determined using a spectral assay. While the wines exhibited a wide range in values in all parameters, with both batches the total phenol content, determined by both the Folin-Ciocalteu assay and HPLC, was very closely correlated with the ESR-derived antioxidant activity. Likewise a strong correlation was noted between the phenolic content and the vasodilation activity of Batch I wines. The antioxidant activity of Batch I wines was significantly correlated with the gallic acid, total stilbene and total flavin- 3 -ol content. Similarly with Batch II wines, gallic acid and total flavan- 3 -ols, along with polymeric pigments were significantly correlated with the ESR-derived antioxidant activity. Batch I and II had significantly different phenolic profiles though in both cases the flavin- 3 -ols and anthocyanins were quantitatively the major skin-derived phenolics present. However, in thirteen of the sixteen Batch I wines the major phenolics present were the flavin- 3 -ols compared with only five of the twenty-two Batch II wines. This discrepancy may be attributed to the viticultural practices of the Southern Hemisphere where many of these wines originated...|$|R
40|$|The first {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify appropriate sensory descriptors to assess the astringent sub-qualities of red wine. The influence of pH and ethanol on the sensation of astringency in red wine was evaluated, using a de-alcoholized red wine. A portion of the wine was adjusted to the pH values of 3. 2, 3. 4, 3. 6 and 3. 8, and another portion was adjusted to ethanol concentrations of 0 %, 6 %, 12 %, and 15 %. In addition, the pH 3. 4 and 3. 6 treatments were adjusted to an ethanol concentration of 12 % and 15 % all wines were then assessed sensorially and seventeen terms were identified, through panel discussion, to describe the mouth-feel and taste qualities: velvet, aggressive, silk/satin, dry, fleshy, unripe, pucker viscosity, abrasive, heat, chewy, acidity, grippy/adhesive, bitter, balance, overall astringency, and mouth-coat. Descriptive analysis profiling techniques were used to train the panel and measure the intensity of these attributes. It was found that decreasing pH values (averaged across all ethanol concentrations) showed an increase in the overall astringency of the wine. The combined treatments of ethanol and pH, real wine parameters (pH 3. 4 and 3. 6; 12 % and 15 % ethanol) did not have an effect on the perception of the astringent sub-qualities of the wine. A time intensity study was also included using the pH and ethanol adjusted wines, which showed that as the ethanol level of the wines increased so did the time to maximum intensity. The second objective was to identify appropriate sensory descriptors to evaluate the influence of grape maturity and maceration technique (grape skin contact) on the astringency sub-qualities of red vinifera wines from Niagara. The grapes were harvested across two dates, representing an early harvest and a late harvest. A portion of the Cabernet Sauvignon grapes wine was divided into three maceration treatments of oneweek maceration, standard two-week maceration, three-week maceration, and MCM. Another portion of both the early and late harvest Cabernet Sauvignon grapes were chaptalized to yield a final ethanol concentration of 14. 5 %. The wines were assessed sensorially and thirteen terms were identified, through panel discussion, to describe the mouth-feel and taste qualities: carbon dioxide, pucker, acidity, silk/chamois, dusty/chalky/powdery, sandpaper, numbing, grippy/adhesive, dry, mouthcoat, bitter, balance and, overall astringency. Descriptive analysis techniques were used to train the panel and measure the intensity of these attributes. The data revealed few significant differences in the mouth-feel of the wines with respect to maturity; which included differences in overall astringency and balance. There were varietal differences between Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, and Pinot Noir and differences for Cabernet Sauvignon wines due to the length and manner of maceration and as a result of chaptalization. Statistical analysis revealed a more complex mouth-feel for the Pinot Noir wines; and an increase in the intensity of the astringent sub-qualities as a result of the addition of sugar to the wines. These findings have implications for how processing decisions, such as optimum grape maturity and <b>vinification</b> <b>methods</b> may affect red wine quality...|$|R
