25|$|A {{rail spike}} is roughly chisel-shaped {{and with a}} flat edged point; the spike is driven with the edge {{perpendicular}} to the grain, which gives greater resistance to loosening. The main function {{is to keep the}} rail in gauge. When attaching tie plates the attachment is made as strong as possible, whereas when attaching a rail to tie or tie plate the spike is not normally required to provide a strong <b>vertical</b> <b>force,</b> allowing the rail some freedom of movement.|$|E
25|$|When the surfer is at wave speed, the surfer must quickly pop up, stay low, {{and stay}} {{toward the front}} of the wave to become stable and prevent falling as the wave steepens. The {{acceleration}} is less toward the front than toward the back. The physics behind the surfing of the wave involves the horizontal acceleration force (Fsinθ) and the <b>vertical</b> <b>force</b> (Fcosθ=mg). Therefore, the surfer should lean forward to gain more speed, and lean on back foot to brake. Also, to increase the length of the ride of the wave, the surfer should travel parallel to the wave crest.|$|E
25|$|Although {{porpoising}} is {{a useful}} product of rapid swimming, a lot of variation seen in the behaviour cannot be explained by this cause alone; it has likely evolved to provide other functions. For example, the rotation during porpoising by the spinner dolphin leads to lots of splashing and is more common at slower speeds so cannot be attributed to an energy saving mechanism. It is therefore {{more likely to be}} a form of play or communication within or between pods. Another reason might be to remove barnacles or small sharks such as remoras that, when attached, increase drag during swimming. When spinner dolphins impact the water the combination of centrifugal and <b>vertical</b> <b>force</b> upon these ectoparasites can be up to 700 times their own weight and so efficiently remove them. Other theories suggest that cetaceans may porpoise in order to observe distant objects such as food by looking for visual cues, such as birds dive-bombing a bait ball. Research into the additional functions of porpoising has so far been focussed on the more acrobatic species, but it is likely that other cetaceans also use it for these, and perhaps unknown, reasons too.|$|E

25|$|Apart {{from any}} {{acceleration}} that might {{occur in the}} direction of the path, the lower panel of the image above indicates the forces on the ball. There are two forces; one is the force of gravity vertically downward through the center of mass of the ball mg, where m is the mass of the ball and g is the gravitational acceleration; the second is the upward normal force exerted by the road at a right angle to the road surface man. The centripetal force demanded by the curved motion is also shown above. This centripetal force is not a third force applied to the ball, but rather must be provided by the net force on the ball resulting from vector addition of the normal force and the force of gravity. The resultant or net force on the ball found by vector addition of the normal force exerted by the road and <b>vertical</b> <b>force</b> due to gravity must equal the centripetal force dictated by the need to travel a circular path. The curved motion is maintained so long as this net force provides the centripetal force requisite to the motion.|$|E
500|$|Similar {{conclusions}} {{were drawn}} by another study using {{finite element analysis}} on an Allosaurus skull. According to their biomechanical analysis, the skull was very strong but had a relatively small bite force. By using jaw muscles only, it could produce a bite force of 805 to 2,148N, less than the values for alligators (13,000N), lions (4,167N), and leopards (2,268N), but the skull could withstand nearly 55,500N of <b>vertical</b> <b>force</b> against the tooth row. The authors suggested that Allosaurus used its skull like a hatchet against prey, attacking open-mouthed, slashing flesh with its teeth, and tearing it away without splintering bones, unlike Tyrannosaurus, which {{is thought to have}} been capable of damaging bones. They also suggested that the architecture of the skull could have permitted the use of different strategies against different prey; the skull was light enough to allow attacks on smaller and more agile ornithopods, but strong enough for high-impact ambush attacks against larger prey like stegosaurids and sauropods. Their interpretations were challenged by other researchers, who found no modern analogues to a hatchet attack and considered it more likely that the skull was strong to compensate for its open construction when absorbing the stresses from struggling prey. The original authors noted that Allosaurus itself has no modern equivalent, that the tooth row is well-suited to such an attack, and that articulations in the skull cited by their detractors as problematic actually helped protect the palate and lessen stress. Another possibility for handling large prey is that theropods like Allosaurus were [...] "flesh grazers" [...] which could take bites of flesh out of living sauropods that were sufficient to sustain the predator so it would not have needed to expend the effort to kill the prey outright. This strategy would also potentially have allowed the prey to recover and be fed upon in a similar way later. An additional suggestion notes that ornithopods were the most common available dinosaurian prey, and that allosaurs may have subdued them by using an attack similar to that of modern big cats: grasping the prey with their forelimbs, and then making multiple bites on the throat to crush the trachea. This is compatible with other evidence that the forelimbs were strong and capable of restraining prey. Studies done by Stephen Lautenschager et al. from the University of Bristol also indicate Allosaurus could open its jaws quite wide and sustain considerable muscle force. When compared with Tyrannosaurus and the therizinosaurid Erlikosaurus in the same study, it was found that Allosaurus had a wider gape than either; the animal was capable of opening its jaws to a 79 degree angle. The findings also indicate that large carnivorous dinosaurs, like modern carnivores, had wider jaw gapes than herbivores.|$|E

40|$|Although {{horizontal}} {{ground forces}} are only ~ 15 % of <b>vertical</b> <b>forces,</b> {{they account for}} 47 % and 33 % of the metabolic cost in walking and running. To explain these disproportionately high metabolic costs we hypothesized that low horizontal ground forces generate relatively high torques on body segments during locomotion and this is mediated by long moment arms. We compared external force moment arms and discreet torques applied to the body segments by horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>forces</b> during walking and running. Sixteen subjects (21. 9 ± 1. 9 years) walked at 1. 5 m/s and 10 subjects (23. 2 ± 2. 0 years) ran at 3. 83 m/s. Segmental torques in the sagittal plane were partitioned into components due to horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>forces</b> and quantified by their angular impulses. The mean (±S. E.) ratios of horizontal to <b>vertical</b> ground <b>forces</b> (GF ratio) and angular impulses (AI ratio) in walking were 0. 131 (± 0. 003, 95 % C. I. 0. 124 to 0. 137) and 0. 530 (± 0. 018, C. I. 0. 497 to 0. 569). Results were similar in running. In both gaits the AI ratios were significantly greater than the GF ratios because the respective C. I. s did not overlap. The horizontal forces produced 53 % and 41 % as much angular impulse on the body segments as did the <b>vertical</b> <b>forces</b> in walking and running despite being only 13 % as large. In the two movements the moment arms for the horizontal forces averaged across foot, leg, thigh, and trunk body segments were 3. 8 fold larger than those for the <b>vertical</b> <b>forces.</b> The data supported the hypothesis and suggest that the relatively low horizontal vs <b>vertical</b> <b>forces</b> accounted for a disproportionately higher percentage of the angular impulses placed on the body segments and this effect was due to relatively long moment arms for horizontal forces. These results partially explain the relatively large metabolic cost of generating relatively low horizontal forces. Originally published Journal of Biomechanics, Vol. 41, No. 8, 200...|$|R

40|$|Because muscle torques counteracting gravity vary {{systematically}} {{during a}} movement of the arm, {{it has been suggested}} that torque differences that occur during a movement provide important information for judging the distance moved away from the body. To test this suggestion, we examined whether external <b>vertical</b> <b>forces</b> applied to the hand (and the torque differences due to these forces) influence proprioception. In a first experiment, the added <b>vertical</b> <b>forces</b> were constant, resulting in a change in torque that was proportional to the gravitational torque, as when holding an object in your hand. This did not affect proprioception. In a second experiment, gradient force fields were used to dramatically change the torque differences. Again, no effect on proprioception was found.

2500|$|On {{pulling the}} trigger of a wheellock firearm, the sear effects a slight {{rotation}} as described above.
