40|$|This paper {{describes}} an alternative architecture for voicemail data retrieval on the move. It {{is comprised of}} three distinct components: a speech recognizer, a text summarizer and a WAP push service initiator, enabling mobile users to receive a text summary of their voicemail in realtime without an explicit request. Our approach overcomes the cost and usability limitations of the conventional voicemail retrieval paradigm which requires a connection establishment in order to listen to spoken messages. We report performance results on all different components of the system which has been trained on a database containing 1843 North American English messages {{as well as on}} the duration of the corresponding data path. The proposed architecture can be further customized to meet the requirements of a complete <b>voicemail</b> value-added <b>service...</b>|$|R
50|$|Voicemail is a {{low-cost}} technology that stores voice messages electronically. Recent {{advances in technology}} allow for the conversion of Voicemail messages to email making message retrieval far more convenient for business owners. In customer <b>service</b> applications, <b>voicemail</b> has limitations. Used for customer <b>service,</b> <b>voicemail</b> has become synonymous with frustration. The complaints are legion and have inspired spoofs on the voicemail experience. Studies also show that up to 75% of callers simply hang up when their call is answered by a machine.|$|R

50|$|Although e-mail {{capabilities}} {{have been}} extended to alphanumeric pagers and cellular text messaging, the operator messaging services are used by individuals who are not located near a computer or where sending a text message may be dangerous or impractical. Live operator messaging marries the technologies of voice messaging and text messaging {{as an alternative to}} <b>voicemail</b> <b>service</b> by using call forwarding features to redirect callers of your cell phone automatically to the operator messaging service after three or four unanswered rings. Operator messaging service providers remain profitable because the average call length is under 30 seconds and employees are often paid less than full-service answering service employees due to the limited training required.|$|E
50|$|Several {{different}} websites for fictional {{organizations or}} individuals mentioned {{on the show}} or in part of the Lost Experience were introduced. The websites, particularly the Hanso Foundation website, contain background information into the mythology of Lost. The character Rachel Blake (Jamie Silberhartz), also known as Persephone, is introduced to guide players through the game. Most clues on the Hanso Foundation website are revealed by clicking on faintly marked anomalies in the web page design or by entering specific codes into webpages. Some require passwords found elsewhere, {{such as in the}} <b>voicemail</b> <b>service.</b> The clue revelations are designed as minigames, though with little challenge as they are completely linear. A notable exception are the coded messages on persephone.thehansofoundation.org, involving simple encryption schemes such as ROT13 and base64.|$|E

5000|$|For {{nearly one}} hundred years, {{there were few}} {{innovations}} or advances in telephone <b>services.</b> <b>Voicemail</b> {{was the result of}} innovations in telephone products and services made possible by developments in computer technology during the 1970s. These innovations began with the Motorola Pageboy, a simple [...] "pager" [...] or [...] "beeper" [...] introduced in 1974 that was generally offered in conjunction with answering services that handled busy / no-answer overloads and after hours calls for businesses and professionals. Operators wrote down a caller's message, sent a page alert or [...] "beep" [...] and when the party called back, an operator dictated the message.|$|R
