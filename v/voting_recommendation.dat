40|$|Social {{voting is}} an {{emerging}} new feature in online social networks. It poses unique {{challenges and opportunities}} for recommendation. In this paper, we develop a set of matrix-factorization (MF) and nearest-neighbor (NN) -based recommender systems (RSs) that explore user social network and group affiliation information for social <b>voting</b> <b>recommendation.</b> Through experiments with real social voting traces, we demonstrate that social network and group affiliation information can significantly improve the accuracy of popularity-based <b>voting</b> <b>recommendation,</b> and social network information dominates group affiliation information in NN-based approaches. We also observe that social and group information is much more valuable to cold users than to heavy users. In our experiments, simple metapath-based NN models outperform computation-intensive MF models in hot-voting recommendation, while users' interests for nonhot votings can be better mined by MF models. We further propose a hybrid RS, bagging different single approaches to achieve the best top-k hit rate. Department of Computin...|$|E

40|$|Online {{voting is}} an {{emerging}} feature in social networks, in which users can express {{their attitudes toward}} various issues and show their unique interest. Online voting imposes new challenges on recommendation, because the propagation of votings heavily depends {{on the structure of}} social networks as well as the content of votings. In this paper, we investigate how to utilize these two factors in a comprehensive manner when doing <b>voting</b> <b>recommendation.</b> First, {{due to the fact that}} existing text mining methods such as topic model and semantic model cannot well process the content of votings that is typically short and ambiguous, we propose a novel Topic-Enhanced Word Embedding (TEWE) method to learn word and document representation by jointly considering their topics and semantics. Then we propose our Joint Topic-Semantic-aware social Matrix Factorization (JTS-MF) model for <b>voting</b> <b>recommendation.</b> JTS-MF model calculates similarity among users and votings by combining their TEWE representation and structural information of social networks, and preserves this topic-semantic-social similarity during matrix factorization. To evaluate the performance of TEWE representation and JTS-MF model, we conduct extensive experiments on real online voting dataset. The results prove the efficacy of our approach against several state-of-the-art baselines. Comment: The 26 th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2017...|$|E

30|$|Experiments were {{designed}} to investigate the performance of social <b>voting</b> <b>recommendation</b> by using HMMs for similarity matching between parties and users in VAAs. The HMMs were trained {{with the aid of}} the HMM Toolbox of Matlab, which was built by Kevin Murphy in 1998 and it uses the Baum-Welch algorithm for estimating parameters of HMMs with discrete outputs [45]. We created an HMM λ_i = (A_i, B_i, π_i), for every party in each one of the datasets. Thus, we concluded with seven HMMs for the Cypriot and German datasets and nine HMMs for the Greek dataset.|$|E
30|$|Additional {{experiments}} were also conducted {{to compare the}} performance of the HMM classifier with the traditional party-user matching method of VAAs and other classifiers that were applied for similarity matching between parties and users in SVAAs. Tables  5 - 7 show the total weighted averages for Precision, Recall and F-measure as well as the Mean Average Precision (MAP) by applying various algorithms to each one of the datasets. The traditional VAA method of <b>voting</b> <b>recommendation</b> is referred as ‘Party Coding’, while the KNN refers to k-nearest neighbour classification [44, 46]. The aggregate results of HMMs obtained in the German and Cypriot datasets outperform the ones obtained in the Greek dataset. Also, HMM classifier achieved better overall performance than the other applied methods.|$|E

This article examines the effects of design choices on these tools {{by focusing on the}} response scale that is used to measure the policy positions of parties and voters. We analyze the impact of scale length on the advice generated by these tools using user data from a VAA developed for the 2014 Dutch local elections. We transform the original 101 -point scale into several alternative scale formats and determine if this leads to a different <b>voting</b> <b>recommendation.</b> We also examine the suitability of alternative scales for creating spatial models, which are often employed by VAAs. We show that the response scale has a potentially profound impact on the resulting advice (with voters receiving different VAA outcomes depending on the scale length), except for voters with an extremist response style. The findings have practical implications for the design of these tools: outcomes should be presented as a preference list, rather than focusing on the “best match. ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to analyse how human temporality was {{expressed}} in the political party campaigns of the Conservative People’s Party (K), the Liberal Party (V), the Social-Liberal Party (RV) and the Social Democrates (S) on the Danish referendum on The European Single Act (1986). Besides the expression of human temporality, we investigate how the parties justify a <b>voting</b> <b>recommendation</b> by constructing a particular human temporality and we discuss whether the justification has {{had an impact on}} the electorate’s decisions. In order to make a qualitative jump from the historical sources to the political reality, we apply a critical discourse analysis as our methodological foundation. Theoretically, we use the concepts related to the research area of political memory, such as human temporality and imagined communities, and linguistic tools from communication and speech acts. We conclude that human temporality was widely used by K, V, and S, while RV tried to convince the electorate exclusively by referring to treaty amendments. The electorate did not have particular knowledge on the European Single Act, and thereby we find that the parties’ communication, including the use of human temporality, has played an essential role in order to convince the electorate...|$|E
40|$|In most democracies voting Advice Applications (VAAs) advising {{citizens}} which {{candidate or}} party they should vote for {{become more and}} more popular. It is therefore crucial {{to know more about the}} functioning and the effects of such tools. After some general remarks about the spread of these tools and their possible effects gathered so far in various studies, this paper presents the latest results from a research conducted in the course of the 2011 Swiss national elections. They confirm that VAAs can lead to better informed voters and are likely to have a positive impact on electoral turnout. Additionally it can be shown that the Swiss VAA smartvote made voters change their voting intention and that they voted for a different party. This was particularly advantageous for the Green Liberal Party. At the moment, only a minority of voters rely on the <b>voting</b> <b>recommendation</b> by smartvote. This might change dramatically with the introduction of e-voting.

40|$|We {{develop a}} simple model to {{understand}} {{the ways in which}} active voters tend to behave, compared to passive voters. We present the model in terms of a director vote, but it generalizes to compensation and governance votes. The model is one of sequential learning, in the spirit of Bikhchandani, Hirshleifer, and Welch (1992). In addition, it is also related to Kacperczyk and Seru (2007), who solve the Bayesian model with public and private signals for managers making portfolio decisions. The basics of the model are as follows. A director can be of type “High ” or “Low ” (H and L for brevity). ISS observes a noisy signal about the true type and makes a <b>voting</b> <b>recommendation.</b> The mutual fund buys the ISS recommendation, receives its own noisy private signal and decides to vote “For ” or “Against”. 1 The proportion of H directors equals α (α> 0), meaning the average probability a director is H equals α. We assume that ISS receives the correct signal with probability β and gets a wrong signal with probability (1 -β). Analogously, the mutual fund receives the correct signal with probability θ and gets a wrong signal with probability (1 -θ). For example, if the director true type is H, ISS has chance β to observe H and the mutual fund has chance θ to observe H. Thus, more precise signals are represented by higher values of β and θ.

40|$|Recent {{regulatory}} changes increasing shareholder voting authority {{have focused}} attention {{on the role of}} proxy advisors. In particular, greater shareholder empowerment raises the question of how much proxy advisors influence voting outcomes. This Article analyzes the significance of <b>voting</b> <b>recommendations</b> issued by four proxy advisory firms in connection with uncontested director elections. We find, consistent with press reports, that Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) is the most powerful proxy advisor and that, of the others, only Glass, Lewis 2 ̆ 6 Co. seems to have a meaningful impact on shareholder voting. This Article also attempts to measure the impact of <b>voting</b> <b>recommendations</b> on <b>voting</b> outcomes. Unlike prior literature, it distinguishes correlation from causality by examining both the recommendation itself and the underlying factors that may influence a shareholder’s vote.

40|$|To {{what extent}} do Voting Advice Applications (VAA) have an {{influence}} on voting behaviour {{and to what extent}} should providers be hold accountable for such tools? This paper puts forward some empirical evidence from the Swiss VAA smartvote. The enormous popularity of smartvote in the last national elections in 2007 and the feedback of users and candidates let us {{come to the conclusion that}} smartvote is more than a toy and likely to have an influence on the voting decisions. Since Swiss citizens not only vote for parties but also for candidates, and the <b>voting</b> <b>recommendation</b> of smartvote is based on the political positions of the candidates, smartvote turns out to be particularly helpful. Political scientists must not keep their hands off such tools. Scientific research is needed to understand their functioning and possibilities to manipulate elections. On the bases of a legal study we come to the conclusion, that a science driven way of setting up such tools is essential for their legitimacy. However, we do not believe that there is a single best way of setting up such a tool and rather support a market like solution with different competing tools, provided they meet minimal standards like transparency and equal access for all parties and candidates. Once the process of selecting candidates and parties are directly linked to the act of voting, all these questions will become even more salient...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two distinct chapters. In the first chapter, I study the outsourc-ing of corporate governance to proxy advisory firms, which are third-party advisors that help institutional investors decide which way to vote on corporate governance issues. Advising equity assets in trillions of dollars, these advisors play a powerful role in shaping corporate governance. First, I model how conflicts of interest arise when a proxy advisor provides advisory services to investors as well as consulting services to corporations on the same governance issues. The advisor can issue biased <b>voting</b> <b>recommendations</b> when expected reputation costs are low, compared to consulting fees. I then study how increased competi-tion can alleviate these conflicts. Using a unique dataset on <b>voting</b> <b>recommendations,</b> I show that the entry of a new advisory firm reduces favorable recommendations for management proposals by the incumbent advisor. This is consistent with our theory as the incumbent is subject to conflicts of interest by serving both investors and corporations. These results inform the policy debate on whether and how to regulate the proxy advisory industry.

Rating the Ratings: How Good Are Commercial Governance Ratings? Proxy advisory and corporate governance rating firms play an increasingly important role in U. S. public markets. Proxy advisory firms provide <b>voting</b> <b>recommendations</b> to shareholders on proxy proposals and sometimes take an active role persuading management to change governance arrangements. Corporate governance rating firms provide indices {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} a firm’s governance and claim to be able to predict future performance, risk, and undesirable outcomes such as accounting restatements and shareholder litigation. We examine these claims for the commercial corporate governance ratings produced for 2005 by Audit Integrity, RiskMetrics (previously Institutional Shareholder Services), GovernanceMetrics International, and The Corporate Library. Our results indicate that the level of predictive validity for these ratings are well below the threshold necessary to support the bold claims made for them by these commercial firms.
