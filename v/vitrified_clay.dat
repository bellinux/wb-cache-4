After a production lapse of 13 years, in 1986 the company marked the 50th anniversary of Fiesta by its reintroduction. Prior to mass production and promotion, Laughlin used the original semi-vitreous clay body on shapes taken mostly from the last incarnation of vintage Fiesta (1969-1973). The company then changed the body to a fully <b>vitrified</b> <b>clay,</b> to enable marketing to the restaurant and service industry, as this clay was more durable. Many original shapes required a redesign because of shrinkage associated with the new clay. Although old and new runs appear similar, direct comparison demonstrates the newer pieces (made with the fully <b>vitrified</b> <b>clay</b> body) are noticeably smaller.

50|$|Some of {{the modern}} house-burning {{experiments}} include those done by Arthur Bankoff and Frederick Winter in 1977, Gary Shaffer in 1993, and Stevanovic in 1997. In their experiment, Bankoff and Winter constructed {{a model of a}} partially dilapidated Neolithic house, and then set it on fire {{in a way that would}} replicate how an accidental fire would have perhaps started from an untended cooking-hearth fire. They then allowed the fire to burn unchecked for over thirty hours. Although the fire rapidly spread to the thatched roof, destroying it in the process, in the end less than one percent of the clay in the walls was fired (turned into ceramic material), which is counter to the large amount of fired-clay wall rubble that is found in the Cucuteni-Trypillian settlement ruins. Additionally, the experimental burning left the walls almost entirely intact. It would have been relatively easy for the roof to have been repaired quickly, the ash cleared away, and the house reoccupied. These results are typical for all {{of the modern}} experiments that have been done to try to recreate these ancient house burnings. Stevanovic, an expert archeological ceramicist, describes how in order to produce the large amount of fired clay rubble found in the ruins, that enormous quantities of extra fuel would have had to be placed next to the walls to create enough heat to <b>vitrify</b> the <b>clay.</b>|$|R

5|$|A {{research}} survey at Kodumanal has unearthed {{the remains}} of an ancient blast furnace, its circular base distinguishable by its white colour, probably the result of high temperature. Around the base, many iron slags, some with embedded burnt <b>clay,</b> <b>vitrified</b> brick-bats, many terracotta pipes with vitrified mouths and a granite slab, {{which may have been}} the anvil, have been recovered. Absence of potsherds and other antiquities has suggested that the smelting place was located outside the boundary of habitation. More furnaces were discovered at the same site with burnt clay pieces with rectangular holes. The pieces were part of the furnace wall, the holes designed to allow a natural draught of air to pass through evenly into the furnace. Many vitrified crucibles were also recovered from this site; one of them notable because it was found in an in situ position. Evidence of steel making is also found in the crucibles excavated at this site. In addition to iron and steel, the metallurgy seems to have possibly extended to copper, bronze, lead, silver and gold objects. At Arikamedu, there were indications of small-scale workshops containing {{the remains of}} working in metal, glass, semiprecious stones, ivory and shell. Kodumanal has yielded evidence for the practice of weaving, {{in the form of a}} number of intact terracotta spindle whorls pierced at the centre by means of an iron rod, indicating the knowledge of cotton spinning and weaving. To further strengthen this theory, a well preserved piece of woven cotton cloth was also recovered from this site. Dyeing vats were spotted at Arikamedu.|$|R
50|$|The Industrial Revolution {{increased}} {{population density}} in manufacturing districts, and produced pipes useful for drain-waste-vent systems from buildings to sewers. Gravity sewers have been assembled from cast iron pipe, <b>vitrified</b> <b>clay</b> pipe, precast concrete pipe, asbestos-cement pipe, and plastic pipe. While some older brickwork sewers remain in use, new sewers of diameters exceeding 1 m typically use reinforced concrete. Corrugated metal pipe {{may be used}} for storm drains or wastewaters with similarly low risk of corrosive conditions. Non-cylindrical cross-sections may have advantages for large-diameter sewers.|$|E
5000|$|Older sewer {{lines of}} small diameter, {{typically}} 6 in, {{are made by}} the union {{of a number of}} short 3 ft sections. The pipe segments may be made of cast iron, with 12 ft to 20 ft sections, but are more often made of <b>vitrified</b> <b>clay</b> pipe (VCP), a ceramic material, in 3 ft, 4 ft & 6 ft sections. Each iron or clay segment will have an enlargement (a [...] "bell") on one end to receive the end of the adjacent segment. Roots from trees and vegetation may work into the joins between segments and can be forceful enough to break open a larger opening in terra cotta or corroded cast iron. Eventually a root ball will form that will impede the flow and this may cleaned out by a cutter mechanism and subsequently inhibited by use of a chemical foam - a rooticide.|$|E
50|$|Around 9% of damages {{described}} in sewer networks can be {{ascribed to the}} successive action of two kinds of microorganisms. Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) can grow in relatively thick layers of sedimentary sludge and sand (typically 1 mm thick) accumulating {{at the bottom of}} the pipes and characterized by anoxic conditions. They can grow using oxidized sulfur compounds present in the effluent as electron acceptor and excrete hydrogen sulfide (H2S). This gas is then emitted in the aerial part of the pipe and can impact the structure in two ways: either directly by reacting with the material and leading to a decrease in pH, or indirectly through itsuse as a nutrient by sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB), growing in oxic conditions, which produce biogenic sulfuric acid. The structure is then submitted to a biogenic sulfuric acid attack. Materials like calcium aluminate cements, PVC or <b>vitrified</b> <b>clay</b> pipe may be substituted for ordinary concrete or steel sewers that are not resistant in these environments.|$|E

50|$|Various {{measures}} {{were made at}} the request of the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) for environmentally friendly design measures. In its early years, the Sydney Super Dome used renewable energy for a fraction of its power supply, provided by EnergyAustralia's green power scheme. The venue saw use of green power through a deal with EnergyAustralia that lasted the duration of the 2000 Summer Olympics and the five years following. The Super Dome's power architecture includes 1,176 photovoltaic solar panels, installed on the arena's roof, which provide 10% of the venue's daily energy consumption, estimated at ~8612MWh annually. Energy efficient lighting and heating/cooling systems were also installed in the venue. The roof's drainage system consists over 2000m of high-density polyethylene pipes, in addition to nearly 3000m of cast iron and copper pipes used in the venue's plumbing system, and 1000m of <b>vitrified</b> <b>clay</b> pipes that make up the Super Dome's surrounding stormwater drainage system. The Super Dome was also one of many venues built at Sydney Olympic Park that made use of recycled timber, used to construct the exterior balconies of the venue. The timber was sourced from Kempsey, and Oberon, along with local sources in Sydney. Additionally, polypropylene seats with nylon arms and mountings make up the Super Dome's stands.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} options to address {{biogenic}} sulfide corrosion problems: impairing H2S formation, venting out the H2S or using materials resistant to biogenic corrosion. For example, sewage flows more rapidly through steeper gradient sewers reducing time available for hydrogen sulfide generation. Likewise, removing sludge and sediments {{from the bottom}} of the pipes reduces the amount of anoxic areas responsible for sulfate reducing bacteria growth. Providing good ventilation of sewers can reduce atmospheric concentrations of hydrogen sulfide gas and may dry exposed sewer crowns, but this may create odor issues with neighbors around the venting shafts. Three other efficient methods can be used involving continuous operation of mechanical equipment: chemical reactant like calcium nitrate can be continuously added in the sewerage water to impair the H2S formation, an active ventilation through odor treatment units to remove H2S, or an injection of compressed air in pressurized mains to avoid the anaerobic condition to develop. In sewerage areas where biogenic sulfide corrosion is expected, acid resistant materials like calcium aluminate cements, PVC or <b>vitrified</b> <b>clay</b> pipe may be substituted to ordinary concrete or steel sewers. Existing structures that have extensive exposure to biogenic corrosion such as sewer manholes and pump station wet wells can be rehabilitated. Rehabilitation can be done with materials such as a structural epoxy coating, this epoxy is designed to be both acid resistant and strength the compromised concrete structure (See Raven Lining Systems).|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis essentially reports {{an investigation of the}} behaviour of buried (0. 12 to 0. 25 m diameter) single-walled PVC-U and <b>vitrified</b> <b>clay</b> pipes during installation in a uniform sand surround and when subjected to applied surface loading. An additional simple study of tail void displacements due to tunnelling in sand is also presented. Controlled laboratory tests were conducted in a glass-faced, steel-sided box. The buried pipes were installed perpendicular to the glass face and were subjected to static and cyclic loading, simulating increasing overburden stress and the passing of traffic over a shallow buried pipe respectively. The simulated shallow tunnel tests were also conducted perpendicular to the glass and involved withdrawal of the outer of two concentrically placed tubes. Photographs were taken of the sand particles and the buried structure in the plane of the cross section together with strain gauge readings on the pipe or tunnel wall throughout installation and loading/shield withdrawal. The resulting sand displacements are presented in the form of horizontal and vertical contour plots. Pipe deflections and volumetric and shear strain contours of the sand were also determined for the buried pipe tests. The shape of the deformed pipe and the imposed stress at the pipe springline were inferred from the pipe wall strains. During the PVC-U pipe tests, the deformation of the pipe caused the applied stress to be transferred to the sidefill via arching in the surrounding soil. This was associated with a reduction of applied stress reaching the pipe. Increasing the initial soil stiffness reduced the magnitude of the pipe and soil displacements and the stress carried by the pipe. Use of a <b>vitrified</b> <b>clay</b> pipe however, caused the soil surround to settle relative to the pipe. Soil shear strain contour plots are used to highlight the mechanisms of the transfer of applied stress onto, or away from, the buried pipes, and are related to the shape of the deformed pipe in the PVC-U pipe tests. The test data also allowed standard buried pipe design methods and installation procedures to be critically appraised. The soil movements recorded during the tunnel tests were shown to be similar to those recorded during the buried PVC-U pipe tests, indicating a similar soil loading transfer mechanism...|$|E

The properties investigated were green and fired clay colour, plasticity, green strength, dry and fired shrinkage, porosity, chemical and mineral composition. The properties of the clay revealed that they have geographical IP potential; particularly, the predominantly off-white fired colour of the ball clay at temperature range of 900 - 11000 C can secure an identity for Kelantan ceramics in the local, national or international market.

40|$|For {{water and}} sewer pipes, PVC is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} best row materials. Due to its physical, chemical and industrial significant properties, PVC is commercially invited to be in the first position. Many other traditional raw materials; e. g. iron, concrete, polyethylene and <b>vitrified</b> <b>clay</b> (VC), are coming in second position. This work is conducted to study the tensile properties of two different types of PVC raw materials (named as gray and white) for water pipe manufacturing by implementing different test conditions. The samples were prepared by cutting off the pipe to an individual cross sectional size rings. Afterward, they were softened smoothly by heating the ring samples to obtain flat standard tensile test specimen. The influence of strain rate (crosshead speed), temperature and UV radiation on the tensile properties of PVC pipe’s row material were investigated. The selected experimental test temperatures are (28 ℃, 50 ℃ and 70 ℃), the selected crosshead speeds are (5, 50 and 100 mm/min) and the UV treatment exposure times are (168, 408, 744 and 1080) hours. The result shows that the gray PVC pipes have tensile strength greater than white PVC pipes. The yield stress and modulus of elasticity are directly proportion to strain rate and inversely proportion to the treatment temperature of both PVC samples. However, the fracture strain was increased with temperature and decreased with strain rate. UV treatment didn’t show a significant effect on the yield stress and modulus of elasticity. This is an indication of PVC long time stability...|$|E
