5|$|Also {{included}} in the plan is an outline for raising awareness about human trafficking across Canada. The plan specifically mentions TruckSTOP, a campaign of Persons Against the Crime of Trafficking in Humans Ottawa, as being integral to the plan. According to the plan, the CBSA is responsible for informing foreigners about human trafficking because of their increased vulnerability. The plan includes a provision {{for the government to}} partner with NGOs that oppose human trafficking. Although Smith said that human trafficking would be more effectively combatted if Canada's prostitution laws were reformed to align with those of Sweden, criminalizing the purchasing rather than the selling of sex, the NAP-CHT does not make such legislative recommendations. The plan enables immigration officers to issue temporary residence permits to foreigners <b>victimized</b> <b>by</b> human trafficking in Canada, thereby providing these victims with opportunities to receive aid.|$|E
5|$|On September 22, 2011, Dugard {{filed suit}} in US District Court for the Northern District of California accusing the United States of failing to monitor Phillip {{when he was a}} federal parolee. Dugard alleged in her lawsuit against the federal {{government}} that parole officials should have returned Garrido to prison for any number of parole violations that preceded her abduction, including testing positive for drugs and alcohol. Her lawsuit was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on March 15, 2016. The court ruled in a 2–1 decision that Dugard had not been <b>victimized</b> <b>by</b> Garrido {{at the time he was}} placed under federal parole supervision, and there was no way to anticipate she would become his victim. As a result, federal authorities in California had no duty to protect her or other members of the general public from him. In a dissenting opinion, Chief District Court Judge William Smith said the majority had improperly analyzed Dugard's case, and said there was good reason to hold the government liable.|$|E

5000|$|The {{difference}} in efficiency follows, because people who perceive {{that they may}} be <b>victimized</b> unfairly <b>by</b> law enforcement are less likely to cooperate. Tyler and Huo's analyses suggests that biased, unprofessional behavior of police, prosecutors and judges not only produces concerns of injustice, it cripples law enforcement efforts by making it more difficult for police and prosecutors to obtain the evidence needed to convict guilty parties.|$|R

[...] "The victim in this case gets to relive her experiences once again in a new trial, hoping that this judge won't require gender sensitivity training," [...] said Sampert. She said surveys repeatedly show one of the primary reasons women do not report being raped is because of a fear of being <b>victimized</b> again <b>by</b> the justice system.|$|R
25|$|Italians, {{the last}} of several {{immigrant}} groups to make Mansion their first home in Albany, became identified with it after a huge influx in the late 19th century.

5000|$|Gangs are {{involved}} {{in all areas of}} street-crime activities like extortion, drug trafficking, both in and outside the prison system and theft. Gangs also <b>victimize</b> individuals <b>by</b> robbery and kidnapping. Cocaine is the primary drug of distribution by gangs in America, which have used the cities Chicago, Cape Town, and Rio de Janeiro to transport drugs internationally. Brazilian urbanization has driven the drug trade to the favelas of Rio. Often, gangs hire [...] "lookouts" [...] to warn members of upcoming law enforcement. The dense environments of favelas in Rio and public housing projects in Chicago have helped gang members hide from police easily.|$|R

The definition of cyberbullying itself has {{been a matter of}} considerable debate, as have the privacy provisions of the bill (particularly in regards to encryption technologies).

25|$|Current {{criminal}} legislation {{does not}} provide for special penalties for acts that target another by reason of his sexual orientation, age or health status. Only the constituent elements of the criminal offense of Incitement to hatred towards a group of persons or to the curtailment of their rights and freedoms, and general aggravating circumstances include attacking a so-called different group of people. Such {{a group of people}} can then, of course, be also one defined by sexual orientation, age or health status. A certain disparity has thus been created between, on the one hand, those groups of people who are <b>victimized</b> <b>by</b> reason of their skin color, faith, nationality, ethnicity or political persuasion and enjoy increased protection, and, on the other hand, those groups that are <b>victimized</b> <b>by</b> reason of their sexual orientation, age or health status and are not granted increased protection. This gap in protection against attacks motivated by the victim's sexual orientation, age or health status cannot be successfully bridged by interpretation. Interpretation by analogy is inadmissible in criminal law, sanctionable motivations being exhaustively enumerated.|$|E
25|$|Brawley {{initially}} received considerable {{support from}} the African-American community.

The grand jury's conclusions decreased support for Brawley and her advisers. Brawley's family has maintained that the allegations were true.|$|E
25|$|The {{rivalry between}} the two actresses is cited as an {{alternative}} to the Martina Lawrence-Elizabeth Bergner origin of Mary Orr's short story, The Wisdom of Eve (1946), the basis of the 1950 film All About Eve.

40|$|International {{surveys of}} victims show crime rates in England and Wales, {{including}} hate crimes, {{are among the}} highest in Europe. Nevertheless, sexual minority status is a less considered risk factor in general victimization research. This study used sexual minority status and sex to predict victimization across British Crime Surveys from 2007 – 2010. Logistic regression analyses showed sexual minority status groups were more likely than heterosexuals to be victimized from any and some specic crimes. However, bisexuals rather than lesbians or gay men were more consistently <b>victimized,</b> notably <b>by</b> sexual attacks and within the household. Implications for understanding victimization among these groups are discussed...|$|R

Both players were injured and the severity of the accident caused Arkansas to withdraw from the upcoming NCAA tournament. In need of a replacement, the NCAA committee turned to Utah, despite the fact that the Utes had four losses and had just lost their first round game in the NIT tournament. Utah had one player, Lyman Condie, a medical student, who quit the team to midway through the season to pursue medical school.
