5|$|Autism is a neurodevelopmental {{disorder}} {{characterized by}} impaired social interaction, impaired <b>verbal</b> <b>and</b> non-verbal communication, and restricted and repetitive behavior. Parents usually notice {{signs in the}} first two years of their child's life. These signs often develop gradually, though some children with autism reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace and then regress. The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood, typically before age three.|$|E

5|$|Classic {{learning}} {{theories and}} the modern dual-coding theory support the introduction of interesting, tangential details to learning content. There is evidence that interesting and engaging information promotes image-based thoughts and is better remembered because it allows storage of material in both <b>verbal</b> <b>and</b> nonverbal systems. This suggests that interesting material, even if tangential to the topic, does not detract from learning and can promote recall of vague or uninteresting material.|$|E

5|$|Mongolian has vowel {{harmony and}} a complex syllabic {{structure}} for a Mongolic language that allows clusters {{of up to}} three consonants syllable-finally. It is a typical agglutinative language that relies on suffix chains in the <b>verbal</b> <b>and</b> nominal domains. While there is a basic word order, subject–object–predicate, ordering among noun phrases is relatively free, so grammatical roles are indicated by a system of about eight grammatical cases. There are five voices. Verbs are marked for voice, aspect, tense, and epistemic modality/evidentiality. In sentence linking, a special role is played by converbs.|$|E
5|$|Syntax {{refers to}} {{patterns}} for combining {{words and phrases}} to make clauses and sentences. <b>Verbal</b> <b>and</b> nominal inflectional morphology are central to Ottawa syntax, as they mark grammatical information on verbs and nouns {{to a greater extent}} than in English (which has few inflections, and relies mainly on word order). Preferred word orders in a simple transitive sentence are verb-initial, such as verb–object–subject (VOS) and VSO. While verb-final orders are avoided, all logically possible orders are attested. Ottawa word order displays considerably more freedom than is found in languages such as English, and word order frequently reflects discourse-based distinctions such as topic and focus.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{programme}} evaluations {{have found that}} many resettled refugees have been the victims of verbal or physical attacks in the UK. The Home Office's 2009 evaluation notes that between one-quarter and half of each of four groups of Liberian and Congolese refugees resettled under the programme had suffered verbal or physical harassment. An evaluation undertaken by academics at Sheffield Hallam University for the Home Office in 2011 found that one-fifth of the refugees surveyed for the evaluation (who {{had been in the}} UK for a year) had been the victims of verbal or physical attacks in their first six months in the UK, and just over a fifth had been attacked in the second six months of their resettlement. Many of the victims of this abuse had not reported it to the authorities, and the authors of the evaluation suggest that this is a reason why there was a gap between the perceptions of refugee and service providers, who generally suggested that community relations were good. <b>Verbal</b> <b>and</b> physical attacks against refugees were also noted in the 2013 Motherwell evaluation.|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{predictive}} {{relations were}} examined between math <b>and</b> <b>verbal</b> achievement <b>and</b> several different measures of motivation. The sample con-sisted of 348 sixth grade and 325 ninth grade Norwegian students. Motivation variables of self concept, self-perceived aptitude, and self-perceived {{ability to learn}} within each domain were highly correlated and used as indicators to define math <b>and</b> <b>verbal</b> latent variables labeled general math <b>and</b> <b>verbal</b> self-perceptions. Subscales measuring self-perceived math <b>and</b> <b>verbal</b> skills were used to define another set of math <b>and</b> <b>verbal</b> latent variables labeled specific math <b>and</b> <b>verbal</b> self-perceptions. Both general and specific math <b>and</b> <b>verbal</b> self-perceptions were strongly related to corresponding achieve-ment. Predictions from Marsh's internal/external frame of reference model were confirmed for math <b>and</b> <b>verbal</b> general self-perceptions but not for specific self-perceptions.

5|$|During the {{production}} of A Bug's Life, a public feud erupted between DreamWorks' Jeffrey Katzenberg, and Pixar's Steve Jobs and John Lasseter. Katzenberg, former chairman of Disney's film division, had left the company in a bitter feud with CEO Michael Eisner. In response, he formed DreamWorks SKG with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen and planned to rival Disney in animation. After DreamWorks' acquisition of Pacific Data Images (PDI)—long Pixar's contemporary in computer animation—Lasseter and others at Pixar were dismayed {{to learn from the}} trade papers that PDI's first project at DreamWorks would be another ant film, to be called Antz. By this time, Pixar's project was well-known within the animation community. Both Antz and A Bug's Life center on a young male, a drone with oddball tendencies that struggles to win a princess's hand by saving their society. Whereas A Bug's Life relied chiefly on visual gags, Antz was more <b>verbal</b> <b>and</b> revolved more around satire. The script of Antz was also heavy with adult references, whereas Pixar's film was more accessible to children.|$|E
5|$|In another study, {{students}} who read less-organized material performed better that students given organized material on tasks that required {{an application of}} the knowledge to problem-solving. This suggests that the inclusion of seductive details might be beneficial for transfer performance but detrimental when trainees are recalling information. Interference from seductive details creates confusion of what the core material is and, therefore, the recall {{will not be as}} good and more errors will occur. This distortion can lead to a richer understanding of the material and facilitate transfer performance because trainees are required to form a macro structure of the instructional material. Research using the dual-coding paradigm also suggests that interesting and engaging information promotes image-based thoughts and leads to deeper processing of information because it allows storage of material in both <b>verbal</b> <b>and</b> nonverbal systems. When information is made easier to comprehend, material is processed less deeply, thus leading to poorer acquisition of information.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, average total SAT scores were around 900 (typically, 425 on the <b>verbal</b> <b>and</b> 475 on the math). The average {{scores on the}} 1994 {{modification}} of the SAT I were similar: 428 on the <b>verbal</b> <b>and</b> 482 on the math. SAT scores for admitted applicants to highly selective colleges in the United States were typically much higher. For example, the score ranges of the middle 50% of admitted applicants to Princeton University in 1985 were 600 to 720 (<b>verbal)</b> <b>and</b> 660 to 750 (math). Similarly, median scores on the modified 1994 SAT for freshmen entering Yale University {{in the fall of}} 1995 were 670 (<b>verbal)</b> <b>and</b> 720 (math). For the majority of SAT takers, however, <b>verbal</b> <b>and</b> math scores were below 500: In 1992, half of the college-bound seniors taking the SAT were scoring between 340 and 500 on the verbal section and between 380 and 560 on the math section, with corresponding median scores of 420 and 470, respectively.|$|E

40|$|Background: Impairments in speech, {{communication}} and Theory of Mind {{are common in}} schizophrenia, and compromise social functioning. Some of these impairments may already be present pre-morbidly. This study aimed to investigate verbal functions in relation to written story production and social functioning in people experiencing a first episode of psychosis (FEP). Method: Two groups of participants: FEP (N = 31) and healthy controls (HC, N = 31), completed measures of clinical status, social functioning, a series of neuropsychological tests targeting <b>verbal</b> functioning, <b>and</b> the “Frog Where Are You?” story production task. Results: Story results showed reduced efficiency (words per minute) and self-monitoring (corrections per minute) for FEP compared with HC groups (p < 0. 01). The FEP group performed significantly poorer than the HC group on most indices of <b>verbal</b> learning <b>and</b> <b>verbal</b> fluency. Story production was positively associated with <b>verbal</b> learning <b>and</b> <b>verbal</b> fluency for the FEP group only (p < 0. 05). Premorbid function decline was associated with impaired <b>verbal</b> learning <b>and</b> memory for the FEP group. Conclusion: Individuals with FEP show a childhood history of reduced social and academic performance {{that is associated with}} skills essential for daily social interactions, as evidenced by the findings for story production, <b>verbal</b> learning <b>and</b> <b>verbal</b> fluency...|$|R
