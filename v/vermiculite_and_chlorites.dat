40|$|Statistical {{analyses}} of chemical {{data from the}} literature of corrensite minerals suggest a large compositional variability, more evident in octahedral than in tetrahedral coordination. Mg occupies 40 - 80 % of the octahedral sites, with A 1 and Fe 2 + making up the remainder. Approximately 15 - 30 % of the tetrahedral sites are filled by A 1. Despite this compositional variability, distinct fields for the several types of mixed-layer trioctahedral chlorite/trioctahedral swelling layer are not apparent. Statistical {{analyses of}} the composition of corrensite compared with saponite, <b>vermiculite,</b> <b>and</b> <b>chlorite</b> suggest that corrensite is an intermediate between trioctahedral <b>chlorite</b> <b>and</b> trioctahedral smectite. If Fe/(Fe + Mg) > 50 %, chlorite alone is favored, but with increasing Mg, chlorite appears to transform into corrensite and then, by iron oxidation, into trioctahedral smectite. Despite the chemical variability between corrensite, <b>chlorite,</b> <b>and</b> saponite, corrensite appears chemically to be a well-defined species. On the other hand, corrensite cannot be characterized chemically {{on the basis of}} its swelling component.

40|$|Six {{samples of}} 'Vermiculite' {{have been studied}} to {{investigate}} the mechanism of its well known but poorly understood property to exfoliate. The samples were analysed quantitatively by XRD to determine their precise mineralogical composition. Electron microprobe methods, including elemental mapping of native potassium and of caesium (introduced by cation exchange) were used to examine variation in the chemical composition of the particles. Most of the samples examined show heterogeneous mineralogical compositions which occur as distinct zones within the volume of individual particles, presenting a mosaic texture. Exfoliation is related to this mosaic distribution of the different mineral phases within the particles. Lateral phase boundaries between <b>vermiculite</b> <b>and</b> mica layers, or <b>vermiculite</b> <b>and</b> <b>chlorite</b> layers are postulated to prevent or impede the escape of gas from a particle, resulting in exfoliation when the pressure exceeds the interlayer bonding forces that hold the layers together. This mechanism provides a common explanation for the exfoliation of 'Vermiculite' by thermal methods or by treatment with H 2 O 2. Paradoxically, one sample which consists of pure vermiculite, in the mineralogical sense of the term, demonstrates that pure <b>vermiculite</b> does not <b>and</b> should not exhibit the property of exfoliation. Our explanation of the mechanism of exfoliation explains the commonly observed particle size dependence of exfoliation and the tendency for obviously poly-phase 'Vermiculite' samples to show the largest coefficients of expansion...|$|R

40|$|The buffer {{capacity}} of a soil is {{a significant factor in}} determining the longevity of soil reaction (pH) adjustments by aluminum sulfate, Al 2 (SO 4) 3, or calcium carbonate, CaCO₂. After 12 weeks the modified pH values of the highly buffered Emory silt loam had changed substantially toward the original pH value of 7. 6. Modified pH values for the Groseclose silt loam soil remained essentially unchanged under the same conditions. These differences in soil response to modified soil pH are related to the differences in the percentage of <b>vermiculite</b> <b>chlorite</b> <b>and</b> <b>chlorite</b> in the clay fractions of the two soils. The longevity of soil pH modification is related to total sycamore seedling dry weight and nutrient uptake. Though these components were significantly affected for plants grown in a Groseclose soil, the lack of significant response differences, except at the extremely low pH adjustment (5. 21), in the Emory soil suggests a rapid change in modified soil pH toward the original soil pH value. The condition of the seedlings coupled with total dry weight accumulation and foliar nutrient content elimiates acid toxicity as a factor affecting growth and nutrient uptake.

40|$|The soils of {{the lower}} Mississippi Delta are derived from the Mississippi or Red River {{depositions}} {{or some combination of}} these two. Profiles of the Iberia, Baldwin, Buxin, Sharkey, and Mhoon were selected for the study. The comparative results indicate that the Sharkey was highest in cation ex-change capacity and exchangeable calcium and magnesium. Base saturation was highest in the Iberia and lowest in the Baldwin. The variation in cation exchange capacity was possibly due, in general, to the differences in texture, except for the Iberia. The clay fraction of the Iberia contained slightly larger quantities of high cation exchange capacity minerals than the other soil series of the study. Silica was highest in the Baldwin while the oxides of aluminum, iron, magnesium, and potassium were highest in the Buxin. liberia was highest in calcium oxide. Silica-sesquioxide and silica-ferric oxide ratios were highest in the Sharkey and lowest in the Buxin. The silica-alumina ratio was highest in the Baldwin and lowest in the Buxin. The comparison of the Buxin with soils of the Mississippi River deposition indicates that the Red River depositions were generally lower in silica-sesquioxide ratios and total calcium oxide and higher in total magnesia nd potash. The X-ray patterns indicate that montmorillonite and illite were the dominant clay minerals present. The greatest quantities of montmorillonite were generally found in the Iberia profiles, although this was not always true. Also, in general, the content of montmorillonite increased and illite decreased with profile depth. Secondary minerals were halloysite, kaolinite, <b>vermiculite,</b> <b>and</b> <b>chlorite.</b> The cation exchange capacity of the clay fraction also indicated the higher content of montmorillonite or associated minerals in the Iberia than in the Buxin, Baldwin, Sharkey or Mhoon soils...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{traditional}} ceramic workshops {{occur within}} {{a range of}} 10 to 80 km around the city of Marrakech. Our study aims to identify the main parameters controlling the plasticity of pastes used by the artisans. To reach this goal, we characterize by X-ray diffraction, granulometry and plasticity index (PI) the local raw clayey material. The investigation of 26 whole pastes shows the dominance of quartz (20 to 50 %) and clay minerals (25 to 60 %) with K-feldspar (2 to 17 %), plagioclase (2 to 25 %), calcite (0 to 18 %), dolomite (0 to 15 %), goethite (0 to 7 %) and trace of hematite and anhydrite (< 3 %). Amphibole occurs in trace (< 5 %) but only in some samples. The clay minerals are diversified, including illite (10 to 40 %), kaolinite (2 to 15 %), mixed-layer (ML) (0 to 10 %), smectite, <b>vermiculite</b> <b>and</b> <b>chlorite</b> (0 to 5 %), and pyrophyllite-talc association (0 to 8 %). Sepiolite (12 %) is only present in one paste. The grain size is made by variable proportions of sand (5 to 65 %), silt (12 to 53 %) and clayey fraction (18 to 66 %). The Plasticity index (PI) indicates the presence of two principals groups of pastes. (1) 	The first group is characterized by PI values ranging between 15 to 18. Their moderate plasticity behavior is related either to the low rate of clayey fraction and/or {{to the absence of}} plastic clays like smectites and mixed layer with smectitic sheets. (2) 	The PI of second group ranges between 20 to 32. The high plasticity values are influenced by the presence of specific clayey minerals like talc-pyrophyllite or sepiolite, or by the high content of smectite plus smectitic mixed-layers within the clayey (< 2 micron) fraction. Only one sample without any of these plastic minerals but with a high content of clayey fraction is characterized by a high PI value (24). We concluded that the workability of ceramic paste in Marrakech region is controlled by a combination of factors, dominated by the grain size distribution and the content in plastic clay minerals within the fine fraction.

40|$|Two {{benchmark}} Vertisols from Maharashtra, viz. Linga series (Typic Haplusterts in Nagpur district) and Pahur series (Sodic Haplusterts in Yavatmal district) of Maharashtra {{were chosen}} for the study. The fine clay fractions are dominated by smectite with small amounts of vermiculite. Reduced CECs of the fine clays were determined after the Greene-Kelly test. CEC and calculated surface charges are distributed in both the tetrahedral and octahedral layers of which the former (65 %) {{is higher than the}} latter (35 %). However, the proportion of octahedral CEC and charge increases (44 %) with the deduction of the contribution of <b>vermiculite</b> <b>and</b> <b>chlorite</b> CEC from the tetrahedral (corrected) CEC. The The CEC and charge distribution exhibited fairly good relationship with some soil properties such as, fine clay, COLE, moisture retention at 1500 kPa, hydraulic conductivity and pH. The study also indicated that determination of reduced CECs from Greene-Kelley test is an effective means of measuring the octahedral and tetrahedral CECs and also for calculating the charge of soil clays. The Pahur soils could be more prone to hydroxy-interlayering owing to its higher tetrahedral charge than Linga soils. The surface area method overestimates the calculation of charge from CEC than formula weight method. In India, the black soils occupy about 116 m ha (Bhattacharyya et al., 2009) of which about 30 m ha is in Maharashtra and about 8. 04 m ha is in Vidarbha region. These soils are developed in alluvium derived from weathering of Deccan basalt (Pal et al., 2006). The black soils of the Deccan Trap are rich in plagioclase feldspars and yield dioctahedral smectite as its first weathering product (Pal and Deshpande, 1987; Pal et al., 1989; Bhattacharyya et al., 1993). Earlier review on the Vertisols of India indicate that black soils of India are dominated by beidellite-nontronite type of minerals (Ghosh and Kapoor, 1982). However, fine clay smectite when subjected to the Greene-Kelly test (Greene-Kelly, 1953) by heating clays with Li and subjecting to glycerolsolvation, expands to about 18 Å and contracts to ˜ 9. 5 Å indicating this to be a mixture of beidellite/nontronite and montmorillonite in which the amount of the former is more than the latter (Pal and Deshpande 1987; Ray et al., 2003...|$|R

40|$|Weathering, mineral formation, and {{transformation}} processes along slopes are complex. In cool mountainous regions, undisturbed soil development {{with a strong}} vertical leaching element may abruptly change {{as a result of}} erosion, accumulation, lateral water fluxes and aeolian input. We investigated soils in the eastern Karkonosze Mountains that have developed on silicatic slope deposits. To date, illite, <b>vermiculite</b> <b>and</b> <b>chlorite</b> are the minerals that have been detected in the clay fraction. Although the climate and parent material should be favourable for the formation of smectites, expandable phases were not verified so far. We investigated if expandable phases could be detected and how they related to elemental fluxes along a short slope sequence (1142 – 1268 m a. s. l. on the border between the Czech Republic and Poland). Mass balance calculations indicated intensive mineral weathering together with a significant leaching of Mg, Al, Ca and Mn on the shoulder and foot slope positions. In the middle zone, which has a concave or undulating surface shape, however, the mass balances of several elements (Na, K, Al, P) revealed a less pronounced leaching (corresponding to a lower degree of podsolization) and in some cases even accumulation. At all sites, mass balance calculations and detected soil minerals (e. g. the increase in illite towards the surface together with an increase in Al and K) indicate some aeolian input. Kaolinite was detected in all soil horizons. Its concentration slightly increased towards the soil surface. Together with the pronounced leaching of Ca, part of kaolinite originates from plagioclase weathering. Besides being a weathering product of primary minerals, part of the kaolinite is inherited from the parent material and probably is also due to aeolian input. In all soils, illite was being transformed into <b>vermiculite</b> <b>and</b> smectites (through regularly-interstratified illite-smectite phases). In addition, the content of chloritic components which increases with depth indicated their concurrent weathering {{and transformation}} into smectites. Amphibole also may have acted as a source of smectites. Not all smectite is being actively formed in the soil. Most likely due to slope processes (cover beds) that affected even the subsoil, some smectite has been transferred along the slope. Part of the smectite also seems to derive from the parent material. Active formation of expandable clay minerals is related to convex and planar landscape forms. This relationship suggests intense element leaching, inheritance from the parent material and cover bed mixing processes have contributed to the presence of smectite. Along the slope, zones with predominant vertical transport (shoulder, foot slopes) may repeatedly be interchanged with zones dominated by lateral transport (undulating slope, concave forms) ...|$|R

As amostras foram investigadas pelo método da adsorção do íon césio (Cs+), que mede a carga estrutural permanente (sigmao) e baseia-se na preferência do Cs+ sobre o Li+ na superfície da siloxana de grupos de superfície ionizáveis de menor seletividade ao íon Cs+. A carga variável representou mais que 50 % da carga total dos solos estudados. Dois dos quatro Latossolos com propriedades ácricas exibiram quantidade significativa de carga permanente, provavelmente em razão da presença de vermiculita com hidróxi entrecamadas e clorita. A quantidade de carga permanente apresentada pelo Nitossolo foi até cinco vezes maior se comparada à dos Latossolos, o que pode ser atribuído à diferença na constituição mineralógica.

This has an important bearing on the town planning in the city of Taiz as the existing buildings are collapsing due to the foundation problems. Studies on 110 exposures, carefully selected after field traverses revealed that the Tertiary rocks in the study region are mainly represented by typical bimodal mafic-felsic associations in the form of flows, plutons and dykes. Tertiary volcanic flows are characterized by alternating sequences of basic and felsic rocks and varicoloured volcaniclastic deposits which were all extruded and fed from fracturing and fissuring in the old rocks through which magma emerged in successive pulses, flooding the surrounding region. The basic flows (Tb 1, Tb 2 and Tb 3) consist of jointed/massive basaltic rocks and volcaniclastic deposits while the felsic flows (Tr 1 and Tr 2) are comprised of jointed/massive rhyolite/dacite rocks and also varicoloured felsic volcaniclastic deposits. All these rocks show wide variations in their geological and petrographical characteristics such as colour, texture, heterogeneity, macro/microfractures, weathering/alteration, thickness, horizontal attitude, and intercalation with volcaniclastic deposits, repetition with depth in both vertical and horizontal directions. Volcaniclastic deposits are also characterized with great diversity in their types, colours, textural features, thicknesses, grain sizes, matrices, and degree of roundness of rock fragments and alternating and/or interlocking as well as intercalation laterally and vertically with basalt/rhyolite lava rocks. Volcaniclastic rocks were classified {{for the first time in}} the study area based on their particle sizes into different types. They range from strong, compact, welded rocks to weak, altered soils. The younger Sabir granitic pluton is represented by alkaline or peralkaline granites that are white to greyish white coloured massive, medium to coarse-grained, grading up to granite porphyry. Petrographic examinations of 52 thin sections representing the samples of basaltic lava flows, rhyolitic/dacite lava flows and younger intrusives under polarizing microscope have been carried to study their mineralogy.

The EMPA data reveal lower Al 2 O 3 and MgO con-tents for the first generation, whereas the “vermiculite ” pseudomorph after garnet shows a lower CaO + K 2 O + Na 2 O content. On the other hand, EMPA FeO and TiO 2 data are not discriminants because submicrometric inclusions of Fe and Fe–Ti oxides affect {{the composition of the}} first generation of “vermiculite”.

Precipitation of neoformed carbonate mineral occurs in the lower estuary reaches of the Spanish estuary but is not evident in the Icelandic estuary. Evaporation and the corresponding supersaturation of mixed waters are responsible for carbonate mineral formation, highlighting the significance of climate on mineral type within estuarine systems. Dissolved iron is lost within the estuarine turbidity maximum zone, in the presence of relatively small proportions of seawater in {{the upper reaches of the}} two estuaries. In NW Spain, 37 % is removed from the water by the upper reaches and 98 % is removed by the middle reaches. In SW Iceland, 91 % is removed from the water in the upper reaches while all is removed by the middle reaches. The estuarine turbidity maximum zone is responsible for the re-suspension of solid iron phases, resulting in elevated particulate iron in the upper estuary reaches. In NW Spain, particulate iron increases from the riverine input by 54 % in the upper reaches while in SW Iceland, particulate iron increases from the river and stream inputs by 242 % in the upper reaches of the estuary. Within the surface sediments of both estuaries, there is minor variation in clay mineral distribution of the fine fraction of the surface sediments from the upper reaches to the lower estuary. Provenance is a dominant control on the clay mineral type present in modern environments. Climatic regime and estuarine circulation processes are also factors with regards to clay distribution within the estuarine environment. This study has led to an enhanced understanding of early diagenesis, such as the location of iron loss and deposition in estuaries, the role of provenance, climate and freshwater input in clay mineral type formation and how evaporation may introduce early diagenetic cements into modern estuaries and will lead to future research development and predictive models relative to iron-rich chlorite grain coat distribution...|$|R

Four soil profiles developed in residuum, alluvium and/or colluvium parent materials were described. X-ray diffraction patterns indicated a similarity in the mineralogical composition of the soil clays. The minerals observed were kaolinite, illite, smectite and/or intergradient <b>vermiculite,</b> <b>chlorite</b> <b>and</b> quartz.

One of the residual soils contained high Fe 2 O 3 contents which showed intensive weathering, typical of the warm humid tropics where oxic horizon is found. Above all, the current climate did not seem to favour the development of such diagnostic horizon. The residual soils could be classified as fine, kaolinitic, thermic Aridic Argiustolls where as the alluvial soils could be classified as fine silty, mixed, thermic Pachic Haplustolls and fine silty, mixed, thermic Cumulic Haplustolls...|$|R

Soils of increasing age (6500 - 9850 y BP) were selected to represent a chronosequence of soil development. Expandable phyllosilicates (vermiculite, smectites) are formed in the eluvial E horizon of podzols {{in a short time}} (6500 y). TEM observations show that dissolution and physical-breakdown pro-cesses affect the clay particles. As the age of the soils increases, fragmentation a d exfoliation of large precursor minerals lead to thinner clay particles of two to three layers thick. The chemical compositions of individual particles obtained by AEM indicate that expandable phyllosilicates from the E horizon of podzols are heterogeneous, involving a mixture of <b>vermiculite,</b> Mg-bearing smectites, <b>and</b> aluminous beidellite. Results suggest hat heterogeneity is related to the nature of their precursors. <b>Vermiculite</b> <b>and</b> Mg-bearing smectites are derived from biotite <b>and</b> <b>chlorite</b> weathering whereas phengitic micas alter to aluminous beidellite. Because the transformation f biotite <b>and</b> <b>chlorite</b> is more rapid than phengitic micas, biotite <b>and</b> <b>chlorite</b> contributes predominantly to smectites in the younger soils, as long as ferromagnesian phyllosilicates are present in the E horizons. If not, a larger proportion of smectites is derived fro...|$|R

It was felt necessary {{to find out the}} species of smectites for better management of these soils. Hence, two benchmark Vertisols namely Seloo from Wardha and Saikhindi from Ahmadnagar districts of Maharashtra were chosen for the study. High resolution mineralogical analysis employed through X ray diffraction (XRD) techniques of the silt, total clay and fine clay fractions of both the pedons were carried out along with Greene-Kelly test with only fine clays. Silt (50 - 2 μm), total clay (< 2 μm) and fine clay (< 0. 2 μm) fractions are dominated by smectite in both the soils; the smectites content increased gradually with decreasing size fraction. The fine clay fractions are mostly composed of smectite with small amounts of <b>vermiculite</b> <b>and</b> traces of <b>chlorite,</b> kaolin <b>and</b> feldspar. Greene-Kelly test indicated that both Seloo and Saikhindi soil fine clays are dominated by beidellite/nontronite over montmorillonite. The Seloo fine clay smectite is composed of 18 – 26 per cent and 74 – 82 per cent montmorillonite and beidellite/nontronite, respectively, and for Saikhindi it is composed of 32 – 41 per cent and 59 – 68 per cent for montmorillonite and beidellite/nontronite, respectively. However, these fine clay smectites are of low charge dioctahedral nature and therefore may not have any K selectivity. This property appears to have implications in K management of shrink-swell soils of Deccan basalt area...|$|R

Thus, the soils of the area are in need of appropriate management plans. The typical properties of the soils studied are: the absence of salinity and carbonate contents, the low amounts of organic matter, the deficiency in P and K which most probably is due to the leaching under acid conditions, the dominantly loamy textures and the pH varying from weakly to strong acid. The priority in the management of these soils should therefore be the application of an appropriate fertilization programme along with soil liming. In addition, some soils may need deep ripping and tillage...|$|R

40|$|The {{island of}} Puerto Rico is {{composed}} primarily of an east-west mountain range of andes{tie to basaltic volcanics with lesser amounts of calcareous sediments {{along the north}} and south shores. The weathering of the volcanics in humid areas produces a soil composed of halloysite, gibbsite, and quartz, whereas weathering in more arid areas produces asoil rich in montmorillonite. The northward flowing Rio Manati drains a volcanic area largely covered by later{tic soils containing halloysite, gibbs{re, and quartz; the mineralogy of the stream load, however, shows montmorillonite in addi-tion to hallovsite and quartz.
