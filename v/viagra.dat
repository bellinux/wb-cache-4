5|$|Oral {{medications}} and mechanical devices {{are the first}} choice in treatment because they are less invasive, are often effective, and are well tolerated. Oral medications include sildenafil (<b>Viagra),</b> tadalafil (Cialis), and vardenafil (Levitra).|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} a {{medicinal}} enzyme inhibitor is sildenafil (<b>Viagra),</b> a common treatment for male erectile dysfunction. This compound is a potent inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5, the enzyme that degrades the signalling molecule cyclic guanosine monophosphate. This signalling molecule triggers smooth muscle relaxation and allows blood flow into the corpus cavernosum, which causes an erection. Since the drug decreases {{the activity of the}} enzyme that halts the signal, it makes this signal last {{for a longer period of}} time.|$|E
5|$|Brachytherapy for {{prostate}} cancer may cause erectile dysfunction in approximately 15-30% of patients. However, the risk of erectile dysfunction is related to age (older men are at a greater risk than younger men) and also the level of erectile function prior to receiving brachytherapy. In patients who do experience erectile dysfunction, {{the majority of cases}} can successfully be treated with drugs such as <b>Viagra.</b> Importantly, the risk of erectile dysfunction after brachytherapy is less than after radical prostatectomy.|$|E
5|$|Tadalafil was {{initially}} formulated by Glaxo Wellcome (now GlaxoSmithKline) {{under a new}} drug development partnership between Glaxo and Icos that began in August1991. The drug was originally researched {{as a treatment for}} cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and angina, but focus quickly shifted to ED with the success of another PDE5 inhibitor, sildenafil (<b>Viagra),</b> which had been developed by Pfizer. Icos began research on tadalafil in 1993, and clinical trials started two years later. Glaxo let the partnership with Icos lapse in 1996, including the company's 50% share of profits from resulting drugs, because the drugs in development were not in Glaxo's core markets. In 1998, Icos formed a 50/50 joint venture with Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly (Lilly Icos LLC) to develop and commercialize tadalafil as Cialis. The release of Cialis in the United States was delayed in April2002 when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended that Icos perform more studies, improve labelling, and address manufacturing issues. Cialis was approved in Europe in November2002 and in the United States a year later. The drug was approved for once-daily use for ED in Europe in June2007 and in the United States in January2008.|$|E
25|$|<b>Viagra</b> {{is one of}} the world's most counterfeited medicines. According to a Pfizer study, around 80% {{of sites}} {{claiming}} to sell <b>Viagra</b> were selling counterfeits.|$|E
25|$|<b>Viagra</b> (sildenafil) for erectile dysfunction.|$|E
25|$|Sildenafil (<b>Viagra).</b> Concomitant {{administration}} of isosorbide mononitrate and sildenafil (<b>Viagra)</b> or other phosphodiesterase inhibitors (Tadalafil and Udenafil) can potentiate the vasodilatory effect of isosorbide mononitrate {{with the potential}} result of serious side-effects such as syncope or myocardial infarction. Life-threatening hypotension may also occur. Therefore, sildenafil should not be given to patients already receiving isosorbide mononitrate therapy.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{the author}} Edward O. Laumann {{turned out to}} have {{financial}} ties to Pfizer, creator of <b>Viagra.</b>|$|E
25|$|On May 6, 2013, Pfizer told The Associated Press {{it would}} begin selling <b>Viagra</b> {{directly}} to patients via its website.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s and 1990s, Pfizer Corporation {{growth was}} {{sustained}} by the discovery and marketing of Zoloft, Lipitor, Norvasc, Zithromax, Aricept, Diflucan, and <b>Viagra.</b>|$|E
25|$|Teva Canada {{launched}} Novo-Sildenafil, {{a generic}} version of <b>Viagra,</b> {{on the day}} the Supreme Court of Canada released its decision. To remain competitive, Pfizer then reduced the price of <b>Viagra</b> in Canada. However, on November 9, 2012, Pfizer filed a motion for a re-hearing of the appeal in the Supreme Court of Canada, {{on the grounds that the}} court accidentally exceeded its jurisdiction by voiding the patent. Finally, on April 22, 2013, the Supreme Court of Canada invalidated Pfizer's patent altogether.|$|E
25|$|On May 6, 2013, Pfizer, which {{manufactures}} <b>Viagra,</b> {{told the}} Associated Press they will begin selling the drug directly to patients on its website.|$|E
25|$|Sildenafil, sold as {{the brand}} name <b>Viagra</b> among others, is a {{medication}} used to treat erectile dysfunction and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Its effectiveness for treating sexual dysfunction in women has not been demonstrated.|$|E
25|$|Egypt {{approved}} <b>Viagra</b> {{for sale}} in 2002, but soon afterwards allowed local companies to produce generic versions of the drug, citing the interests of poor people who {{would not be able}} to afford Pfizer's price.|$|E
25|$|Alkyl nitrites {{interact}} with other vasodilators, such as sildenafil (<b>Viagra),</b> vardenafil (Levitra), and tadalafil (Cialis), to cause a serious decrease in blood pressure, which can cause fainting, stroke, and low blood pressure leading to potential heart attack.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, while {{testing a}} new angina {{treatment}} in Merthyr Tydfil, researchers {{discovered that the}} new drug had erection-stimulating side effects {{for some of the}} healthy volunteers in the trial study. This discovery formed the basis for <b>Viagra.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sildenafil's {{popularity}} with young adults has {{increased over the}} years. Sildenafil's trade name, <b>Viagra,</b> is widely recognized in popular culture, and the drug's association with treating erectile dysfunction has led to its recreational use. The reasons behind such use include {{the belief that the}} drug increases libido, improves sexual performance, or permanently increases penis size. Studies on the effects of <b>viagra</b> when used recreationally are limited, but suggest it has little effect when used by those not suffering from erectile dysfunction. In one study, a 25-mg dose was shown to cause no significant change in erectile quality, but did reduce the postejaculatory refractory time. This study also noted a significant placebo effect in the control group.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, Pfizer {{received}} two patents for sildenafil: one for its indication to treat cardiovascular disease (marketed as Revatio) {{and another for}} its indication to treat erectile dysfunction (marketed as <b>Viagra).</b> The substance is the same under both trade names.|$|E
25|$|Pfizer's patents on <b>Viagra</b> expired {{outside the}} US in 2012; in the US {{they were set}} to expire, but Pfizer settled {{litigation}} with each of Mylan and Teva which agreed that both companies could introduce generics in the US in December 2017.|$|E
25|$|In February 2007, it was {{announced}} that Boots, the UK pharmacy chain, would try over-the-counter sales of <b>Viagra</b> in stores in Manchester, England. Men between the ages of 30 and 65 would be eligible to buy four tablets after a consultation with a pharmacist.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, <b>Viagra</b> sales {{accounted}} for 92% {{of the global}} market for prescribed erectile dysfunction pills. By 2007, Viagra's global share had plunged to about 50% due to several factors, including the entry of Cialis and Levitra, along with several counterfeits and clones, and reports of vision loss in people taking PDE5 inhibitors.|$|E
25|$|Several oral {{medications}} like <b>Viagra,</b> Cialis and Levitra {{have become}} {{available to help}} people with erectile dysfunction and have become first line therapy. These medications provide an easy, safe, and effective treatment solution for approximately 60% of men. In the rest, the medications may not work because of wrong diagnosis or chronic history.|$|E
25|$|The company {{develops}} {{and produces}} medicines and vaccines {{for a wide}} range of medical disciplines, including immunology, oncology, cardiology, diabetology/endocrinology, and neurology. Its products include the blockbuster drug Lipitor (atorvastatin), used to lower LDL blood cholesterol; Lyrica (pregabalin) for neuropathic pain/fibromyalgia; Diflucan (fluconazole), an oral antifungal medication; Zithromax (azithromycin), an antibiotic; <b>Viagra</b> (sildenafil) for erectile dysfunction; and Celebrex/Celebra (celecoxib), an anti-inflammatory drug.|$|E
25|$|Brooks asked Glazier {{to go to}} Hollywood to work {{on further}} films, but with his {{marriage}} breaking up he demurred, preferring to remain in New York {{to be close to}} his daughter. He continued a savvy business career - for example he invested in the doctor who discovered <b>Viagra</b> - and maintained generous friendships with many, in which he disliked being the center of attention.|$|E
25|$|In 1994, Pfizer filed {{a patent}} {{covering}} {{the use of}} sildenafil to treat erectile dysfunction. This would be marketed as <b>Viagra.</b> This patent was published in 2002 and will expire in 2019. Teva sued to have the latter patent invalidated, but Pfizer prevailed in an August 2011 federal district court case. In an agreement with Pfizer, Teva will begin to provide the generic drug in 2017.|$|E
25|$|Vardenafil's {{indications}} and contraindications are {{the same}} as with other PDE5 inhibitors; it is closely related in function to sildenafil citrate (<b>Viagra)</b> and tadalafil (Cialis). The difference between the vardenafil molecule and sildenafil citrate is a nitrogen atom's position and the change of sildenafil's piperazine ring methyl group to an ethyl group. Tadalafil is structurally different from both sildenafil and vardenafil. Vardenafil's relatively short effective time is comparable to but somewhat longer than sildenafil's.|$|E
25|$|Heather Hartely of Portland State University, Oregon is {{critical}} of the shift from female sexual dysfunction being framed as an arousal problem to a desire problem. In her article, “The ‘Pinking’ of <b>Viagra</b> Culture,” she states that the change from female sexual arousal disorder to hypoactive sexual desire disorder is indicative of ‘disease mongering’ tactics by the drug industry through an effort to match up a drug to some subcomponent of the DSM classification.|$|E
25|$|Due to its {{embarrassing}} {{nature and}} the shame felt by sufferers, the subject was taboo for a long time, and {{is the subject of}} many urban legends. Folk remedies have long been advocated, with some being advertised widely since the 1930s. The introduction of perhaps the first pharmacologically effective remedy for impotence, sildenafil (trade name <b>Viagra),</b> in the 1990s caused a wave of public attention, propelled in part by the news-worthiness of stories about it and heavy advertising.|$|E
25|$|Cork City is a hub of {{industry}} in the province. Several pharmaceutical companies have significant operations in the area, including Pfizer Inc., Johnson & Johnson and Swiss company Novartis. Perhaps the most famous product of the Cork pharmaceutical industry is <b>Viagra.</b> Cork is also the European headquarters of Apple Inc. where over 3,000 staff are involved in manufacturing, R and customer support. Logitech and EMC Corporation are also important IT employers in the area. Three hospitals are also among the top ten employers in the city (see table below).|$|E
25|$|The {{symptoms}} of esophageal spasm, erectile dysfunction, and abdominal pain {{are attributed to}} the fact that hemoglobin released during hemolysis binds with circulating nitric oxide, a substance that is needed to relax smooth muscle. This theory is supported by the fact that these symptoms improve on administration of nitrates or sildenafil (<b>Viagra),</b> which improves the effect of nitric oxide on muscle cells. There is a suspicion that chronic hemolysis causing chronically depleted nitric oxide may lead to the development of pulmonary hypertension (increased pressure in the blood vessels supplying the lung), which in turn puts strain on the heart and causes heart failure.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} of nitric oxide is elevated in populations living at high altitudes, which helps these people avoid hypoxia by aiding in pulmonary vasculature vasodilation. Effects include vasodilatation, neurotransmission (see gasotransmitters), modulation {{of the hair}} cycle, {{production of}} reactive nitrogen intermediates and penile erections (through its ability to vasodilate). Nitroglycerin and amyl nitrite serve as vasodilators because they are converted to nitric oxide in the body. The vasodilating antihypertensive drug minoxidil contains an ·NO moiety and may act as an NO agonist. Likewise, Sildenafil citrate, popularly known by the trade name <b>Viagra,</b> stimulates erections primarily by enhancing signaling through the nitric oxide pathway in the penis.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, Pfizer filed {{a patent}} {{covering}} the substance sildenafil {{and its use}} to treat cardiovascular diseases. This would be marketed as Revatio. The patent was published in 1993 and expired in 2012. The patent on Revatio (indicated for pulmonary arterial hypertension rather than erectile dysfunction) expired in late 2012. Generic versions of this low-dose form of sildenafil have been available in the U.S. {{from a number of}} manufacturers, including Greenstone, Mylan, and Watson, since early 2013. Health care providers may prescribe generic sildenafil for erectile dysfunction. However, the generic is not available in the same dosages as branded <b>Viagra,</b> so using dosages typically required for treating ED requires patients to take multiple pills.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, Noten also {{designed}} a white Dior 001 gun {{and a black}} Chanel 001 gun with hand-tooled 18-karat gold details, {{as part of a}} larger series entitled 7 Necessities for a Woman (to feel like a woman through the eyes of a man). The two 3D-printed nylon guns double as make-up bags with lip gloss and wand in the muzzle, the loading chamber serves as a pill compartment (complete with pills, including <b>Viagra),</b> 100grams of certified silver bullion in the Dior gun clip, 50grams of 24-karat gold in the Chanel, a toothpick and, in some models, a hairpin and a small vial of perfume. The guns also conceal a 4-gigabyte USB memory stick. Priced at US$11,500.00 (Dior gun) and over US$17,000.00 (Chanel gun) respectively.|$|E
25|$|On November 25, 2010, Hathaway's erotic romantic drama comedy film Love & Other Drugs was released. It co-stars Jake Gyllenhaal and is {{directed}} and co-written by Edward Zwick {{and based on}} the non-fiction book Hard Sell: The Evolution of a <b>Viagra</b> Salesman by Jamie Reidy. It grossed $102 million worldwide, and Hathaway received a Satellite Award for Best Actress for her role. Other projects included the romantic comedy The Fiancé, an adaptation of the Julie Buxbaum novel The Opposite of Love, the Garry Marshall-directed ensemble comedy Valentine's Day, and an adaptation of Gerald Clarke's biography Get Happy: The Life of Judy Garland, in which she played the title role on the stage and screen. On November 29, 2010, it was announced that Hathaway and James Franco would host the 83rd Academy Awards. Together with actor Denzel Washington, Hathaway hosted the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo, Norway on December 11, 2010.|$|E
500|$|Her fifth husband, Keemat Lal (Annu Kapoor), is {{a police}} {{inspector}} who has shielded his [...] "Madame" [...] from prosecution for two murders {{in exchange for}} marriage. With a voracious appetite for sex, his dependence on <b>Viagra</b> proves his undoing; one fateful night, Susanna mixes an overdose of the drug into Lal's drink.|$|E
500|$|In May2005, the FDA began {{investigating}} {{reports of}} sudden blindness in users of sildenafil (<b>Viagra).</b> The FDA {{said it had}} received reports of the condition, a permanent blindness in one eye known as non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, in 38users of sildenafil and 5users of tadalafil or vardenafil (Levitra). Lilly Icos voluntarily amended the Cialis label to warn of the condition. The FDA was criticized for its handling of the matter, as an FDA safety officer had commented on unusual reports of blindness over 13months before a journal article was published on the issue. United States Senator Chuck Grassley {{wrote a letter to}} the FDA detailing his criticism, saying that the FDA's Office of New Drugs (OND) had taken no action [...] "despite OND's knowledge of the blindness risks since January2004 and general agreement among FDA staff last spring that the label should be updated". Grassley's letter also suggested that Pfizer resisted adding the blindness warning to Viagra's label. In July2005, the FDA said that <b>Viagra,</b> Levitra, and Cialis labels would all carry warnings on the risk of sudden blindness, though it was unclear whether the drugs were actually causing the blindness.|$|E
