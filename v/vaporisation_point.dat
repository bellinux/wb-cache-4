5000|$|The {{melting point}} of Galinstan {{has been a}} source of much debate. Many commercially {{available}} gallium, indium and tin eutectic alloys are advertised with a melting point of about +11 °C, which is significantly higher than the −19 °C featured by Galinstan. The official MSDS (material safety data sheet) mentions only that Galinstan is an [...] "eutectic mixture of the metal components gallium, indium and tin" [...] with no further explanation provided. Additionally, a US patent to Geraberger Thermometerwerk GmbH describes various related eutectic alloys and mentions that they may contain up to 2 wt% of antimony (Sb) to increase oxidation resistance and up to 2 wt% of bismuth (Bi) to improve fluidity. The resulting eutectic alloy is said to contain 68 wt% to 69 wt% Ga, 21 wt% to 22 wt% In, and 9.5 wt% to 10.5 wt% Sn, with small addition of Sb and Bi and an impurity level less than 0.001 wt%. The resulting material is noted to have a melting point of −19.5 °C and <b>vaporisation</b> <b>point</b> of above 1800 °C.|$|E
30|$|As Fig.  10 shows, {{there is}} an obvious {{discrepancy}} between the temperature of water and heavy oil saturated samples compared to the dry ones. The temperature for the water saturated samples {{is less than the}} heavy oil saturated ones because the <b>vaporisation</b> <b>point</b> of water is higher than the oil. Moreover, the thermal capacity of water is more than the heavy oil and so vaporisation of water needs less temperature. Another reason for this difference is the higher absorption of the laser energy of heavy oil compared to that of water.|$|E
40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} {{thermal model}} for the calculation of temperature distributions, including heat conduction and phase change, for single-pulsed direct laser interference patterning (DLIP) was described. The numerical model was solved by the meshfree smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method. To obtain a good computational accuracy, the chosen particle distribution must permit several particles within the very short absorption length of the material. The observed influence of the smoothing length on the model accuracy leads {{to the conclusion that}} a 21 particle neighbourhood in the particle approximation is suitable. This corresponds to a kernel smoothing length of the 2. 4 -fold particle spacing in case of an equidistant rectangular particle distribution. Numerical tests provide evidence that a particle discretisation by a local refinement approach is comparable to a fine equidistant discretisation in terms of accuracy. However, employing the locally refined particle distribution leads to a strong reduction of both computation time and memory capacity requirement. The obtained results are in good agreement with results computed using a previous finite element model. An advantage of the SPH thermal model is that the enthalpy discontinuity at the phase transition point is considered. In contrast, existing FEM models of single-pulsed DLIP spread the enthalpy of phase transition over a broader temperature interval, and therefore differences in computed temperature distributions become particularly apparent close to the <b>vaporisation</b> <b>point.</b> Experimental investigations of DLIP were performed on stainless steel substrates. The computations of the adapted model correspond very well to the molten pool dimensions measured and estimated {{on the basis of the}} experiments. It is uncertain, though, whether the evaporation noticed in the computational model actually takes place as convection in the molten bath is able to reduce the temperature of the melt considerably. To assess the extent of evaporation and hence the support of the melt displacement by the evaporation-induced recoil pressure the fluid flow in the molten bath has to be accounted for in the model. A noticeable benefit of the meshfree SPH method in contrast to conventional numerical methods is that deformations, tangling and even disintegration of the computational domain do not pose a serious problem. Therefore, the developed model is extendable to investigate the molten bath convection and evaporation during the DLIP process. Considering moderate fluence, the convection is of thermo-capillary nature, that is, strong thermal gradients at the surface of the substrate cause surface tension gradients that induce shear stresses leading to convection. At high fluence, convection is dominated by the evaporation-induced recoil pressure. To understand the mechanisms involved in single-pulsed DLIP of metallic substrates, the effects of molten bath convection and even ablation by material evaporation have to be assessed. Thus, future investigations on modelling DLIP using SPH will include the discussion of fluid flow and evaporation...|$|E
40|$|This master thesis project aims to {{investigate}} the circumstances of boil-off for heavy vehicle transports, using LNG as fuel, and suggest possible ways of handling these gases otherwise released into the atmosphere. LNG, Liquefied Natural Gas, is when natural gas is cooled below its <b>vaporisation</b> <b>point,</b> turning it into liquid phase which {{is a much more}} dense way of storing and transporting the fuel. Trucks running on LNG store their fuel in super insulated tanks, but some heat are transferred to the fuel anyway, causing it to vaporise at a steady rate. During driving of these trucks, this vaporised gas is consumed and the pressure are kept at a certain level of 10 bar. Once the truck is turned off, consumption stops and the pressure starts to increase. After a period of standstill, normally several days, the pressure within the tank has increased to 16 bar where a valve opens to release gas from the tank. This is a safety feature, causing the pressure not to increase further creating hazards. While natural gas, mostly containing methane, is released, fuel is lost and an environmentally unfriendly substance is let out into the atmosphere. This should be avoided, to improve the environmental aspects of using LNG as a fuel for trucks, which most likely will be regulated by laws yet to come. Since the release of boil-off gases rarely should happen during the regular use of these trucks, but a system handling these gases should work at any time and place, a cheap and lightweight unit are to be fitted to these trucks. Equipment already on the truck should be used as much as possible, keeping additional costs and weight low. The only practical way of storing this gas, which is the most resource efficient way of handling these boil-off gases, is to re-liquefy it and transferring it back to the usual LNG tank on the vehicle. The second best option is to consume the gas, making it less environmentally unfriendly. While consuming the gas, as much as possible of its energy should be utilised as electricity and heat. Preferably, electricity should be produced as much as possible, charging the batteries on the truck, decreasing the fuel consumption while running and increasing the lifespan of the batteries. The most efficient way of managing the heat generated is to distribute it to the coolant system on the truck, providing it to the engine and several other components. Distributing the energy is also a matter of safety, as very hot areas otherwise might cause risks of fire. The most simple concept, that is easiest to implement in the near future, is to use a burner similar to the auxiliary diesel heaters fitted to some trucks today. This consumes fuel, generating heat to the coolant system. An additional cooler is needed, to cool of excess heat from the system keeping the temperatures to a certain level. Using this system for an extensive period of time needs an external power supply, since no electricity is generated from consuming the gas. Other technologies {{that could be used in}} the future, also generating electricity, is thermoelectric generators and solid oxide fuel cells. These are technologies now being further developed and adapted to the industry of vehicles. These technologies are especially interesting when they are implemented to these trucks for use within other systems as well, for instance utilisation of the heat within exhaust gases. A small scale re-liquefaction unit mounted to the truck is however seen as the most resource efficient solution, making it possible to keep using the gas for it intended purpose of propelling the trucks forward. This technology has to be made more compact, adapting it to the use on a truck...|$|E
