50|$|George Audemars first {{manufactured}} regenerated nitrocellulose fibers in 1855. Though these fibers were {{soft and}} strong -resembling silk- {{they had the}} drawback of being highly flammable. Hilaire de Chardonnet perfected production of nitrocellulose fibers, but manufacturing of these fibers was relatively uneconomical. In 1890, L.H. Despeissis invented the cuprammonium process -which uses a cuprammonium solution to solubilize cellulose- a method still used today for production of artificial silk. In 1891, {{it was discovered that}} treatment of cellulose with alkali and carbon disulfide generated a soluble cellulose derivative known as viscose. This process, patented by the founders of the Viscose Development Company, is the most widely used method for manufacturing regenerated cellulose products. Courtaulds purchased the patents for this process in 1904, leading to significant growth of <b>viscose</b> <b>fiber</b> production. By 1931, expiration of patents for the viscose process led to its adoption worldwide. Global production of regenerated cellulose fiber peaked in 1973 at 3,856,000 tons.|$|E

40|$|Controlling {{the size}} and shape of noble Ag nanocrystals (NCs) is of great {{interest}} because of their unique size-and shape-dependent properties, especially below 20 nm, and because of interesting applications in drug delivery, sensing, and catalysis. However, the high surface energy and tendency of these tiny NCs to aggregate deteriorates their unique properties and limits their applications. to avoid the aggregation of Ag NCs and improve their performance, we report a. seed-mediated hot injection approach to synthesize highly dispersed tiny Ag NCs on a nanosized solid CaCO 3 support. This simple, low-cost, and effective chemical approach allows for synthesizing highly uniform Ag NCs (similar to 10 nm) on the surface of presynthesized CaCO 3 single NCs (similar to 52 nm) without any aggregation of the Ag NCs. <b>Viscose</b> <b>fibers</b> were coated with the Ag@CaCO 3 composite nanoparticles (NPs) produced, as well as with similar to 426 nm Ag NPs for reference.

In this project, Lyocell and <b>viscose</b> <b>fibers</b> were reinforced in chemically modified soybean based bio-matrix, acrylated epoxidized soybean oil (AESO) by compression molding technique. The composites are characterized for mechanical performance by tensile, flexural and impact tests, viscoelastic performance by dynamical mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) and morphological analysis by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In general, Lyocell composites had better tensile and flexural properties than viscose based composites. The same goes with elastic and viscous response of the composites. Hybrid composites were formed by fiber blending; on addition of Lyocell to viscose based composites improved the properties. The amount of Lyocell and <b>viscose</b> <b>fibers</b> used determined the properties of hybrid composites {{and the possibility of}} tailoring properties for specific application was seen. Hybrid composites showed better impact strength. Morphological analysis showed that the viscose composites had small fiber pull out whereas Lyocell composites had few pores.

To overcome the above mentioned issue and to reduce the water absorption, surface modification of the fiber was done by alkali treatment and silane treatment. The effect of treatment is done through swelling, water absorption and morphological analysis tests. The properties could be increased on proper modification of the fibers.

40|$|Cellulose, {{the most}} {{abundant}} renewable organic material on earth, exhibits outstanding properties and useful applications, but also presents a tremendous challenge with regard to economical and environmentally friendly chemical processing. The viscose process, more than 100 year old {{is still the most}} widely utilized technology to manufacture regenerated cellulose <b>fibers</b> and films. <b>Viscose</b> <b>fibers</b> are produced today worldwide on a 5 million ton scale with various fiber types ranging from high performance tire yarn to textile filaments and staple fibers with excellent properties close to those of cotton. At Fraunhofer IAP, the technical equipment for viscose preparation, wet spinning of fibers, hollow fibers, and tube-like films is available on a min-plant scale. Research focused on raw materials testing, process optimization with regard to economic and ecological aspects, structural analysis of cellulose during processing, and structure-property relations of fibers and films. Similar to the <b>viscose</b> process, cellulosic <b>fibers</b> can be produced via cellulose carbamate as an environmentally friendly route. In a close cooperation of Fraunhofer IAP with industrial partners, a specific process based on cellulose carbamate was developed on a pilot plant scale, giving fiber properties close to those of conventional <b>viscose</b> <b>fibers.</b> In recent decades the N-methylmorpholine-N-oxide (NMMO) -technology {{turned out to be a}} nonderivatizing commercial alternative to the still dominant viscose route. From the very beginning, Fraunhofer IAP has been engaged in investigating the structure formation of cellulose fibers precipitated from NMMO-water solution, revealing structural reasons for the fibrillation tendency of these fibers and means to overcome them. Starting from fiber formation via dry-jet wet spinning, for the first time the blown film formation and the meltblown nonwovens technology were developed for cellulosics on a pilot plant scale at Fraunhofer IAP. Based on the elastic behavior of the dope at elevated temperatures, cellulose can be processed like a melt in the air-gap, offering new possibilities of shaping cellulose like meltable mass polymers.
