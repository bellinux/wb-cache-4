2500|$|A {{major change}} in the {{approach}} to writing about botanical pharmacology is signalled in the De Medicamentis. As texts associated with Mediterranean medicine traveled west and north with the expanding borders of the Roman empire, the plants required by drug recipes were no longer familiar, and the descriptions or illustrations provided by earlier herbals failed to correspond to indigenous flora. Marcellus’s practice of offering synonyms is one attempt to bridge this gap. He often provides a string of correspondences: the Greek plant name polygonos is first glossed as sanguinaria in Latin (1.2), then as [...] "what we [...] call rubia" [...] (1.44); in the same chapter polygonos is given as another name for millefolium (1.28), and identified elsewhere as equivalent to <b>verbena</b> (10.5). Of {{the dozen or so}} Celtic plant names, ten are provided with or as synonyms for Greek or Latin names. A preoccupation with naming rather than description is a characteristic also of medieval herbals. The problems of identifying plants may have been an intellectual attraction for Marcellus’s Renaissance editor Cornarius, whose botanical work emphasized the value of words over illustration.|$|E
2500|$|The dunes are {{separated}} into uplands and wetlands habitats. [...] Uplands include the fore dunes, back dunes, and sandy beaches. [...] Dunes {{can occur in}} three different formations. [...] Primary Foredunes are parallel to the shore and support sparse vegetation. [...] Parabolic dunes are [...] "U" [...] shaped and perpendicular to the shore with vegetative ridges. [...] Moving sand sheets consist of constantly moving sand, making it hard for vegetation to settle. The fore dunes begin at the high tide line, where only low growing plants with deep root systems (such as sand <b>verbena)</b> can live. The strong winds, salt spray, and massive amounts of sand make this area uninhabitable for other types of plants. [...] Plants in the dunes adapt growth forms to survive high winds. [...] Some grow {{close to the ground}} to avoid the wind and others adopt a Krummholz growth form. [...] The back dunes, just behind the fore dunes, are stabilized and covered with plants. The back dunes are dominated by shrub species like mock heather, dune lupine, coastal buckwheat, and blochman's senecio. The sandy beaches are a harsh environment with no plants able to survive there. [...] The wetlands include the areas that contain water: salt marshes, fresh and brackish-water marshes, swamps, and mudflats. [...] Plants that live there are adapted to dynamic environmental conditions including high salinity concentration and extreme temperatures. [...] Solutions that the plants can take to adapt to high salinity are large tap roots to reach the perched water table, thick cuticle to prevent water loss, and succulence.|$|E
