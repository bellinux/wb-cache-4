40|$|Podolian cattle {{represents}} {{one of the most important}} native Italian breed. This breed was once dolian reared in many different Italian regions, whereas in recent years a dramatic reduction of the number of head has relegated this breed to some marginal areas of southern Italy. For meat production, calves are dam-reared on pasture for about 8 - 10 months and, subsequently they are fed a finishing diet in loose house conditions with external paddock. They usually are slaughtered from 14 to 18 months of age. The aim of this study was to evaluate the chemical and the fatty acid composition of sample cuts of Podolian bulls slaughtered at different ages; even if breed, age and sex related to differences in the fatty acid composition of beef cattle have been widely demonstrated (Einchhorn et al., 1986; Huerta- Leidenz et al., 1996; Malau-Aduli et al., 2000), few data are available on Podolian cattle. This trial was carried out on 12 Podolian steers, from the same farm in the Basilicata region. The subjects, at the age of about 10 months, were moved to a stall for fattening and divided into 2 homogeneous groups of 6 animals each. During the trial period, the animal were fed ad libitum with hard wheat straw and a complete pellet feed, containing barley, oats, field beans, and a vitamin-mineral integrator. The steers were slaughtered at the age of 14 months (A group) and 18 months (B group), according to <b>veterinary</b> <b>police</b> rules. The chemical composition of raw Longissimus lumborum (Ll) of the B group presented a more higher incidence of protein (22. 25...|$|E
40|$|Adriano Mantovani {{was born}} in 1926 in Altedo, Malalbergo (Bologna). After graduating in {{veterinary}} medicine from Bologna University in 1948, he gained his Masters in public health from the University of Minnesota in 1952 and qualified to lecture in microbiology and immunology in 1957 and in parasitology in 1963. He held numerous positions over the years: Assistant, Aide and Vice‐Director of the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale di Teramo(1949 ‐ 1962), Researcher at the Faculty of Medicine in Rome (1962 - 1965), Professor of Infectious Diseases, Prophylaxis and <b>Veterinary</b> <b>Police</b> Work at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in Bologna, Director of the Institute {{of the same name}} (1965 - 1982) and Research Manager and Director of the Parasitology Laboratory at the Italian National Institute of Health and the WHO/FAO Collaboration Centre for Veterinary Public Health in Rome (1983 - 1991). He was active in numerous national and international organisations, including {{as a member of the}} National Health Council (1974 - 1982), Secretary of the World Federation of Parasitologists (1971 - 1987) and from 1972 President, Vice President or presenter in various WHO, FAO and OIE working groups. He worked in numerous countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and North America as an expert, presenter and lecturer. From 1978, the year in which the Mediterranean Zoonoses Control Plan was established, he was one of the major collaborators of the WHO Mediterranean Zoonoses Control Centre in Athens (MZCC). In 1989, he was the first Italian to be awarded the OIE’s international award for contributions to veterinary public health and in 2001 was publicly recognised by the MZCC for his many years of activities carried out to support the zoonoses control plan and promote well-being in the Mediterranean. He had been a member of the Italian National Guard’s Commission for Predicting and Preventing Great Risks since 1994. In 2002, he was presented with the Italian Parasitology Society’s Battista Grassi medal. He covered leading roles in the executive boards of various Italian and international scientific associations, including the Italian Small Animal Veterinary Association, the World Association for the Advancement of Veterinary Parasitology, the Italian Society of Tropical Medicine, the Italian Society of Parasitology, the World Association for the History of Veterinary Medicine and the World Small Animal Veterinary Association. Professor Mantovani’s principal areas of activity were in veterinary public health, above all the epidemiology and control of zoonoses and animal diseases, veterinary urban hygiene, health education and veterinary actions in emergency situations. His interests were not limited to transmissible diseases but included all problems connected with the relationship between humans, animals and the environment in both urban and rural areas, especially disadvantaged areas. He was particularly involved in the development and organisation of public veterinary services, the social and economic aspects of health and animal production and prevention and control activities. He was a committed advocate of the overriding importance of One Medicine and inter‐ and intra-professional cooperation. He authored over 250 publications...|$|E

30|$|Most recently, CARPA led {{the effort}} to protect another {{critical}} transhumance corridor that mobile pastoralists take {{to move to the}} Logone floodplain (Bebisse 2011). The corridor was blocked by a forest created by the Cameroonian government. CARPA brought all the stakeholders together, i.e. everyone with an interest in agro-pastoral conflicts, which included representatives from the agricultural and pastoral communities, representatives of the different government services (e.g. <b>veterinary</b> services, <b>police),</b> traditional authorities of all the villages along the corridor, municipal authorities (e.g. mayor and council members) and the government authorities (e.g. district head or sous-préfet). The process involved surveying the corridor, identifying conflicts along the corridor, signing an agreement, delimiting the corridor with cement markers {{and the creation of a}} local oversight (or management) committee to continue dialogue between the different user groups and support the participatory management of the corridors (Bebisse 2011).|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{describe}} the spectrum and occurrence of occupational exposures of {{relevance to the}} respiratory system and their subsequent adverse effects within the service industries and occupations, as outlined by the U. S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2007. ^ Design. Systematic {{review of the literature}} from an Ovid search including years 1950 to 2008. Initially, occupational respiratory disease categories were searched, and then combined with each of the different occupations for a comprehensive review of the literature. ^ Results. Ten groups within the U. S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2007 were identified as having exposures leading to occupational respiratory disease. These include janitors/cleaners, dental personnel, cosmetology professionals, traffic <b>police,</b> <b>veterinary</b> personnel, firefighters, healthcare workers, bakers, and bar/restaurant workers. The most common respiratory disorder affecting this population was occupational asthma caused by many different exposures in each occupation. The biggest limitation was the absence of a uniform reporting method for occupational respiratory diseases. ^ Conclusion. There is evidence that there are risks for occupational respiratory disease in the services industry. ^ Key Words. occupational and respiratory disease and service industries...|$|R
