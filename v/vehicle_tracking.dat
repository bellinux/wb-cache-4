25|$|The <b>vehicle</b> <b>tracking</b> and {{maintenance}} issue had not improved by August 2013. The Washington Post {{reported that the}} Ellerbe never ordered the 16 fire engines and seven ladder trucks which he said were needed in 2011. Ellerbe blamed the city council and an unspecified dispute with a vendor for the two-and-a-half year delay. He also asserted that six new fire engines and two new ladder trucks had been ordered, but did not say {{how long it would}} be until they arrived. The newspaper also reported that Ellerbe had yet to fix the vehicular tracking database problem. The department spent $160,000 on a consultant to inventory the department's equipment, but no permanent staff person had been hired to oversee the project and keep it going.|$|E

500|$|Having {{reached the}} {{conclusion}} {{that this was a}} search under the Fourth Amendment, the Court declined to examine whether any exception exists that would render the search [...] "reasonable", because the Government had failed to advance that alternate theory in the lower courts. [...] Also left unanswered was the broader question surrounding the privacy implications of a warrantless use of GPS data absent a physical intrusion – as might occur, for example, with the electronic collection of GPS data from wireless service providers or factory-installed <b>vehicle</b> <b>tracking</b> and navigation services. [...] The Court left this to be decided in some future case, saying, [...] "It may be that achieving the same result through electronic means, without an accompanying trespass, is an unconstitutional invasion of privacy, but the present case does not require us to answer that question." ...|$|E

500|$|In August 2010, {{the company}} {{introduced}} an early running alarm system for drivers, which is linked into the automatic <b>vehicle</b> <b>tracking</b> system, and sounds an alarm and displays warning messages if {{the bus is}} running early. This was {{as a result of}} the company being fined £10,500 by the Traffic Commissioner for Scotland, having been found to be running buses early. After a customer complaint, Vehicle and Operator Services Agency monitored services 4, 16, 27 and 45 in February 2010, and found that of 303 instances, 44 buses were running early, despite starting the route on time, while 20 were running late. The company's defence was that they had built in some running time to cope with the delays due to tram works, but in some places, these works had ended early. The Commissioner accepted this defence, and chose not to take action against the company's operating licence (which authorises a maximum of 700 vehicles). Instead the Commissioner imposed a fine set much lower than the legal maximum (calculated as £550 * 700 vehicles = £385,000) ...|$|E

2500|$|Many {{companies}} today utilize {{some type}} of satellite <b>vehicle</b> <b>tracking</b> or trailer tracking to assist in fleet management. In this context [...] "tracking" [...] refers to a location tracking and [...] "satellite" [...] refers either to a [...] GPS or GLONASS satellites system providing location information or communications satellites used for location data transmission. A special location tracking device {{also known as a}} tracker or an AVL unit is installed on a truck and automatically determines its position in real-time and sends it to a remote computer database for visualizing and analysis.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of high-speed railway, dynamic interaction between <b>vehicles</b> and <b>track</b> is correspondingly strengthened. Therefore, dynamic responses {{analysis of the}} high-speed <b>vehicles</b> and <b>track</b> {{become more and more}} important to the train operation safety, riding comfort as well as the maintenance of railway infrastructure. In this paper, <b>vehicle</b> and <b>track</b> vibration equations are separately established based on the <b>vehicle</b> <b>track</b> vertical coupling model. Taking the CRH vehicle running on the existing line as an example, the random vibration responses of the <b>vehicle</b> and <b>track</b> under different running speed are analyzed in time domain through numerical integral method and MATLAB program. According to the results, the velocity of train has more influence on the vibration property of rail and wheelsets than bogie and carbody...|$|R

2500|$|Automatic vehicle {{location}} (AVL or ~locating; telelocating in EU) is a {{means for}} automatically determining and transmitting the geographic location of a vehicle. [...] This data, from one or more vehicles, may then be collected by a <b>vehicle</b> <b>tracking</b> system to manage an overview of vehicle travel. As of 2017, GPS technology has reached {{the point of having}} the transmitting device be smaller than the size of a human thumb (thus easier to conceal), able to run 6 months or more between battery chargings, easy to communicate with smartphones (merely requiring a duplicate SIM card from one's mobile phone carrier in most cases) — all for less than $20 USD.|$|E
2500|$|EATS {{technology}} is predominately used when applying <b>vehicle</b> <b>tracking</b> to vehicle security solutions. [...] An {{example of this}} distinction is given in the following scenario; [...] A construction company owns some pieces of plant machinery that are regularly left unattended, at weekends, on building sites. Thieves break onto one site and a piece equipment, such as a digger, is loaded {{on the back of}} a flat bed truck and then driven away. [...] Typically the ignition wouldn’t need to be turned on and as such most of the AVL products available wouldn’t typically be activated. Only products that included a unit that was activated by a motion sensor or GeoFence alarm event, would be activated.|$|E
2500|$|AVL {{technology}} is predominately used when applying <b>vehicle</b> <b>tracking</b> to fleet or driver management solutions. [...] The use of Automatic Vehicle Location {{is given in}} the following scenario; A car breaks down {{by the side of}} the road and the occupant calls a vehicle recovery company. The vehicle recovery company has several vehicles operating in the area. [...] Without needing to call each driver to check his location the dispatcher can pinpoint the nearest recovery vehicle and assign it to the new job. [...] If you were to incorporate the other aspects of vehicle telematics into this scenario; the dispatcher, rather than phoning the recovery vehicle operative, could transmit the job details directly to the operative’s mobile data device, who would then use the in-vehicle satellite navigation to aid his journey to the job.|$|E

40|$|The {{matching}} of GPS received {{locations to}} roads is challenging. Traditional matching method {{is based on}} the position of the GPS receiver, the vehicle position and vehicle behavior near the receiving time. However, for probe vehicle trajectories, the sampling interval is too sparse and there is a poor correlation between adjacent sampling points, so it cannot partition the GPS noise through the historical positions. For the data mining of probe <b>vehicle</b> <b>tracks</b> based on spatial semantics, the matching is learned from the traditional electronic navigation map matching, and it is proposed that the probe <b>vehicle</b> <b>track</b> matching algorithm is based on spatial semantic features. Experimental results show that the proposed global-path matching method gets a good matching results, and restores the true path through the probe <b>vehicle</b> <b>track...</b>|$|R
