In Saudi Arabia, only 1 shisha smoker out of 24 cases of CO-related intoxications of various origins could be identified [2]. A few years ago, two cases related to hookah lounges were reported in France, {{a country with a}} total of about 1, 000 neo-Orientalist smoking tea houses by that time [3]. Prevention should focus on the long overdue message that shisha smoking should never take <b>place</b> in poorly <b>ventilated</b> <b>places,</b> particularly when cigarette smoke is simultaneously generated [4].

The fungal genus Malassezia, which lives {{on the surface of}} the skin and mucosae of some mammals and birds, is a {{commensal}} organism that may sometimes act as a pathogen. This paper describes the presence of Malassezia spp at the edge of the eye of a white-eyed parakeet seized by IBAMA (Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources) and examined at the Federal University of Uberlândia (UFU) Veterinary Hospital. The examination of the bird revealed the presence of a small white rounded structure at the edge of its right eye. The bird was sedated and a fragment of the structure was removed and sent to the university’s Laboratory of Infectious Diseases. This material was seeded in blood and MacConkey agars and a slide was prepared and stained by the Gram-staining technique; no biochemical assays were performed. Reading was performed in an optical microscope under 100 X magnification, revealing flattened oval colonies resembling purplish footprints, indicative of Malassezia spp. The bird was not treated because the structure gradually diminished in size until it disappeared completely after the animal was isolated in a clean well <b>ventilated</b> <b>place</b> and supplied with water and good quality food suitable for the species.

40|$|Garlic - a {{powerful}} plant Cue: In European folk stories, garlic is perhaps {{known for its}} power to keep away vampires - the fictional creatures that live by drinking human blood. But the reputation of garlic for protecting humans from harm {{is not just a}} story. In fact the power of garlic to help the body to fight infections is well known, and some people eat garlic as an alternative medicine to treat fevers. Originating from Europe, China and Japan, garlic is widely used as a flavouring in European and Asian cooking. It?s also becoming more popular in African cooking, and the future for garlic farmers selling to local markets in Africa would seem to be bright. The power of garlic to repel pests is not just a folk tale either. Garlic plants act as a repellent to many insect pests, and if grown among other vegetable crops, such as tomatoes, garlic can help to protect all the plants from insect attack. Once harvested, the garlic bulbs - each one made from many smaller sections called cloves - can be stored in a well <b>ventilated</b> <b>place</b> for up to a year without losing their value. Canisius Mpala is a garlic farmer from Zimbabwe. He spoke to Busani Bafana about his experience of growing this powerful, high value crop. Busani began by asking him why he decided to grow garlic. IN:		?I saw the crop being grown at home? OUT:		? it is an easy crop to grow and the returns are very good. ? DUR?N		 5 ? 39 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Canisius Mpala, a garlic farmer from Bulawayo in Zimbabwe. Transcript Mpala	I saw the crop being grown at home in the Lukosi irrigation scheme in Hwange. Then I decided to experiment on the crop because I was told that it was easy to grow. I tried it and then after harvesting I realised that it was an easy crop to grow, it had a good market. So I decided to retain most of the seed, I sold a bit, so that the following year I went into it and grew it on a much larger area. Bafana	What would you say are the necessary conditions for the cultivation of garlic? Mpala	It is a cold season crop which requires chilling. So you can only grow it in the winter months. So in the winter months you have to plough your land, put in your manure, mix it with your soil. After that you put rows which are about 20 cms apart. Then in between the plants, you need to plant it about 5 cms apart. And then from there the only thing {{you have to do is}} to weed. And once in a while you can use a bit of pesticide just to prevent some diseases, but otherwise it is an easy crop. Even without any chemicals you can grow it as long as you do some irrigation since it is grown in winter. You have to plant it in March. It will be ready by July/August for harvesting. Bafana	You sound very passionate about growing garlic. Are there any difficulties in growing garlic? Mpala	Usually I tell people that garlic is an easy crop to grow because it is not attacked by any pests. It is actually a repellent. When the guys in Hwange started it was on the IPM workshop, whereby they wanted to find out which crop would they grow with their tomatoes in order to reduce the amount of pesticides that they were using. So they did a crop of garlic and tomatoes, and tomatoes alone and garlic alone, and then looked at the yields. So from there most of those guys in Hwange have now sort of resorted to taking garlic as the major crop. So it is an easy crop to grow, you just need a bit of water in winter and then even the fertilisation, once you do your composting in manure that is ideal for the crop. Bafana	What would you say was the biggest challenge you faced when you went into garlic growing? Mpala	The biggest challenge was the availability of cloves and the availability of the proper seed, because there are two varieties. There is the pink garlic and there is the white garlic. The pink garlic, most of the guys say this is more pungent and most people like it but it is not favourable for export. The white garlic is easy to handle and it is favourable for export but the seed was not available or it is not readily available. I think that has been the biggest challenge, getting the right material for seed. Bafana		Is it also easy to find the market for garlic? Mpala	Locally it has been easy, I think because most of the big wholesalers, the fruit and vegetable sellers they take up the garlic. And many people are learning or getting to use garlic on a regular basis so that marketing of the garlic has not been a problem. Bafana	You talked about white garlic and the pink garlic. When you grow the garlic do you sell it as processed or do you sell it raw? Mpala	Right now the pink garlic that we are growing, we are selling it as raw garlic. You just have to remove the leaves, remove the roots, package it into 10 kg pockets, sell it to Interfresh or the vegetable wholesalers. The white garlic that is for export has bigger cloves. It is easy to process and the South African market want it crushed as puree. Therefore this will be semi-processed, that will be sold to the outside market. Bafana	As a passionate farmer no doubt, what is the future of garlic growing in Zimbabwe as far as you can see? Mpala	The future of garlic growing is very bright. The past years or the past decade it was associated with the people of Asian decent or the whites. Those are the people who were eating garlic. But right now most people are taking up garlic because of its medicinal effect and most people use it as an antibiotic. So most people are taking up garlic and so the demand is increasing. So I think the prospects are brighter. And then there is also the prospect of selling it across the borders. Most countries the demand for garlic is high, therefore there is going to be a ready market and to grow. Bafana	For a farmer who might be interested definitely to go into garlic growing, what would be your advice? Mpala	My advice is tell the farmer to get in touch with the extension services, find out who are the guys who are already growing garlic, if they want to be assisted. And last year at the farm we had about 15 people coming, even though I was not around my supervisor showed them on how to grow it. When it was harvesting time the people came back again and said ?OK, how do we harvest the garlic?? So I think there is quite a lot of extension that might be needed for people. But looking at the ease at which you can grow garlic, it might have a bit of labour on planting but it is an easy crop to grow and the returns are very good. End of track.

40|$|Exercise induces a {{residual}} post-exercise {{increase in the}} core temperature threshold at which cutaneous vasodilation and sweating begins. The hypothesis that exercise intensity causes a parallel increase in the post-exercise onset threshold for cutaneous vasodilation mediated by an attenuation of active vasodilator activity, was tested in nine subjects. The effect of exercise intensity on the esophageal temperature threshold for the onset of sweating was also evaluated. Esophageal temperature was monitored as an index of core temperature while sweat rate was measured using a <b>ventilated</b> capsule <b>placed</b> on the upper back. Increases in forearm skin blood flow and mean arterial blood pressure were measured and used to calculate cutaneous vascular conductance at two superficial sites, one with intact alpha-adrenergic vasoconstrictor activity and one infused with bretylium tosylate. On four separate days, subjects either remained seated for 35 min or performed 15 min treadmill running at 55, 70 or 85 % VO 2 max followed by 20 min seated recovery. A liquid conditioned suit was used to increase mean skin temperature until cutaneous vasodilation and sweating occurred. It is concluded that intensity of exercise has a prolonged residual effect on the post-exercise vasomotor and sudomotor response by increasing the esophageal temperature at which onset of vasodilation and sweating occurs. Furthermore, the post-exercise increase in onset threshold for vasodilation is likely caused by an attenuation of active vasodilator activity modulated by baroreceptor reflexes in response to post-exercise hypotension...|$|R
40|$|Advisor: Frederick Carey, PT, PhDBackground/Purpose: Early {{mobility}} protocol {{has been}} an issue of discussion within {{the intensive care unit}} (ICU) {{for a short period of}} time. Researchers have been developing protocols and treatment techniques in order to maximize the effects of this intervention. Early mobility can be most effective when paired with reducing drug sedation due to the higher degree of mobility a patient can participate in. The purpose of this review is to determine whether critically ill and ventilated patients who receive early mobility have a better functional outcome and decreased length of stay in the hospital when compared to a patient receiving standard care. Case Description: This case follows a 22 year old male admitted to a University Medical Center in Texas following a three story fall from construction site scaffolding. He was evaluated and medically managed as a trauma patient sustaining multiple organ lacerations. The patient was intubated, <b>ventilated</b> and <b>placed</b> on several precautions. Outcomes: Outcome measures were based upon safety, highest degree of functional mobility at discharge and length of stay in the hospital in days. Discussion: Early mobilization within the ICU is feasible and safe. The most adverse common response to treatment was a drop in oxygen saturation, which was quickly restored after a short rest period. Patients who received early mobilization therapy had an improved functional mobility score when compared to patients receiving standard care. There was no difference in length of stay at the hospital when comparing early mobilization with standard care therapy...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was the {{quantification}} of inorganic phosphate (Pi) and other phosphorus metabolites by P- 31 NMR spectroscopy in the mouse heart muscle in situ, beating at around 600 min(- 1). Male adult Quacker-bush mice (mean weight 32 +/- 7 g) were anaesthetized, <b>ventilated</b> and <b>placed</b> in a temperature-controlled animal holder. A purpose-built 31 P NMR surface coil was positioned against the exposed left ventricular myocardium. Partial signal overlap of Pi with 2, 3 -DPG from chamber blood was minimized using a DEPTH pulse sequence (180 degrees - 90 degrees - 180 degrees - 180 degrees -acq.). Quantification of phosphorus metabolites was performed using an external standard positioned directly above the surface coil. We report for the mouse myocardium in situ an intracellular free [p(i) ] of M, [ATP] of 5 +/- 0. 5 mM and [PCr] of 14 +/- 1, 5 mM. The phosphorylation ratio (ATP/ADP P-i) was 1005 +/- 200 mM(- 1) for a PCr/ATP ratio of 2. 7 +/- 0. 3, It was concluded that the detection of free [P-i] in the mouse myocardium in situ can be greatly enhanced using a DEPTH pulse sequence. Quantification of compounds using an external standard positioned directly above the surface coil gave comparable results to estimations using internal ATP that was quantified enzymatically. The close agreement between the external and internal methods indicates that ATP is 100 % NMR visible in the mouse heart in situ. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies which}} have {{indicated}} that the stimulation of ventricular mechanoreceptors induces significant reflex responses can be criticised because of the likelihood of concomitant stimulation of coronary arterial baroreceptors. We therefore undertook this investigation to examine the coronary and ventricular mechanoreflexes in a preparation in which the pressure stimuli to each region were effectively separated. Dogs were anaesthetised, artificially <b>ventilated</b> and <b>placed</b> on cardiopulmonary bypass. A balloon at the ventricular outflow separated pressure in the left ventricle from that perfusing the coronary arteries. Ventricular pressures were changed by varying inflow and outflow of blood entering and leaving the ventricle through an apical cannula, and coronary pressure by changing pressure in a reservoir connected to a cannula tied in the aortic root. Pressures distending carotid and aortic baroreceptors were controlled. Changes in descending aortic perfusion pressure (flow constant) {{were used to assess}} systemic vascular responses. Large changes in carotid sinus and coronary pressures decreased vascular resistance by 35 ± 1. 9 and 40 ± 2. 5 %, respectively. Intracoronary injections of veratridine (30 – 60 μg) decreased vascular resistance by 31 ± 2. 5 %. However, large increases in ventricular pressure decreased resistance by only 9 ± 2. 2 %. Significant changes in vascular resistance were obtained with increases in coronary arterial pressure from 60 to 90 mmHg. However, ventricular pressures had to increase to 152 / 18 mmHg (systolic/end-diastolic) before there was a significant response. These results show that coronary mechanoreceptors are likely {{to play an important role}} in cardiovascular control. If ventricular receptors have any function at all, it is as a protective mechanism during gross distension, possibly associated with myocardial ischaemia...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Because of the {{logistical}} {{obstacles to}} measurement under hyperbaric conditions, {{the effect of}} nitrous oxide (N 2 O) alone on spinal neuronal responses has not been tested. We hypothesized that, like other inhaled anesthetics, N 2 O would depress spinal neuronal responses to noxious stimulation. METHODS: The lumbar spinal cord was exposed in rats anesthetized with isoflurane. Mechanically <b>ventilated</b> rats were <b>placed</b> into a hyperbaric chamber and needle electrodes were inserted into the hindpaws. Isoflurane administration was discontinued and anesthesia converted to N 2 O by pressurizing the chamber with N 2 O. A microelectrode was inserted into the lumbar cord using computer-controlled motors and a hydraulic microdrive. Neuronal responses to electrical stimulation of the hindpaw were sought at 1. 5, 2, and 2. 5 atm N 2 O (0. 8 – 1. 3 minimum alveolar concentration). RESULTS: Increasing N 2 O partial pressures variably affected neuronal responses to a 2 s 100 -Hz electrical stimulus.

40|$|The {{construction}} of massive concrete structures is often conditioned by {{the necessity of}} phasing casting operations {{in order to avoid}} excessive heat accumulation due to cement hydration. To accelerate construction and allow larger casting stages (usually increasing lift height), it is usual to adopt internal cooling strategies based on embedding water pipes into concrete, through which water is circulated to minimize temperature development. The present paper reports the use of horizontally <b>placed</b> <b>ventilated</b> prestressing ducts embedded in a massive concrete wall for the same purpose, in line with a preliminary Swedish proposal made in the 1990 s. The application herein reported is a holistic approach to the problem under study, encompassing extensive laboratory characterization of the materials (including a technique developed for continuous monitoring of concrete E-modulus since casting), in situ monitoring of temperatures and strains, and 3 D thermo-mechanical simulation using the finite element method. Based on the monitored/simulated results, it is concluded that the air-cooling system is feasible and can effectively reduce early cracking risk of concrete, provided adequate planning measures are taken.

40|$|Rodent {{models have}} been {{described}} to investigate lung preservation and reperfusion injury but have significant disadvantages. In large animals single lung transplant studies are probably optimal but problems remain over the ability to rigorously separate the lungs for assessment while promoting medium to long-term animal survival for meaningful investigation.

Specifically, small animal models of lung transplantation usually have short perfusion times (often one hour) and include extracorporeal circuits while larger animal models often require the contralateral lung to be excluded after transplantation-an unphysiological situation under which to evaluate the graft. A porcine model of left lung allotransplantation was developed in which native and donor lungs are individually <b>ventilated.</b> Sampling catheters <b>placed</b> within the graft lung allowed specimen withdrawal without mixing of blood from the contralateral lung after reimplantation. The model permits a variety of clinical scenarios to be simulated with the native lung supporting the animal irrespective of function in the graft.

In areas where tuberculosis is endemic, poorly <b>ventilated</b> social gathering <b>places</b> such as shebeens (informal alcohol drinking places), minibus taxis, and clinic waiting rooms are all potential transmission hot spots. We modeled the transmission reduction achieved by removal of infectious persons in settings with different tuberculosis prevalence rates to demonstrate the concept of transmission elasticity. We then applied this concept to real-life data from a hyperendemic community in Cape Town, South Africa. Results. In a hyperendemic area, {{reducing the number of}} infectious people by a given percentage results in a smaller percentage decrease in the annual risk of infection (ARI) compared with a nonendemic area; for example, removing 10 % of infectious persons could result in as little as a 5 % reduction in the ARI. With use of real-life data and removal of 60 % of infectious individuals with tuberculosis, as would be achieved by meeting current performance targets of 70 % case detection and 85 % cure, the estimated ARI reduction is 50 %. Conclusions. The relationship between the number of infectious people removed and the decrease in ARI i...|$|R
40|$|Immobility {{is one of}} {{the factors}} {{associated}} with the accumulation of respiratory secretion in mechanically <b>ventilated</b> patients. <b>Placing</b> patients in a semi-recumbent position between 30 ° and 45 ° and frequent manual turning in every two hours are the standard ventilator nursing care practice adopted worldwide. However, the prevalence of pulmonary complications remains high. The use of continuous lateral rotation therapy (CLRT) to improve drainage of secretion within the lung and the lower airways was proposed and has been investigated in numerous studies. The purposes of this dissertation are (1) to perform a comprehensive systematic review for a critical appraisal of the current evidence on the use of CLRT to prevent pulmonary complications in mechanically ventilated patients, (2) to develop an evidence-based guideline and to assess the implementation potential, and (3) to develop an implementation and evaluation plan for translating the guideline to an adult intensive care unit (ICU) of a teaching hospital in Hong Kong. In order to identify studies that compared CLRT with the standard care, four electronic databases, including CINAHL Plus, Medline, British Nursing Index and PubMed, were searched. 94 studies were identified and eight of them met the inclusion criteria. These studies included one randomized controlled trial (RCT), two non-randomized controlled clinical trials, one pretest-posttest clinical trial and four retrospective cohort studies. The quality of these reviewed studies was assessed by using the appraisal instruments of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network. Four of the reviewed studies were graded as high quality. No major adverse patient outcome was reported. Instead, beneficial patient outcomes that reached statistical significance were consistently reported in the CLRT group. There were reductions in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), atelectasis, duration of mechanical ventilation and length of stay. However, its effect on health care cost and mortality was inconclusive. The implementation potential, in terms of the transferability, feasibility, and the cost-benefit ratio, was considered as high in the target setting. Based on the synthesized finding, a CLRT guideline is developed and is proposed to translate into practice. The implementation plan includes a communication plan with stakeholders and a pilot test. The guideline will be revised after the trial run of the proposed innovation for one and a half months. A full-scale controlled trial using a quasi-experimental design will be conducted. The primary outcome is to evaluate whether there is a reduction in the prevalence of VAP after the use of CLRT. According to previous studies, the use of CLRT can lead to a 49 % reduction in VAP. The proposed innovation will be considered as clinical effective when similar observation is obtained. published_or_final_versionNursing StudiesMasterMaster of Nursin...|$|R
40|$|Realizou-se estudo de tipo {{transversal}} sobre intoxicação por chumbo e cádmio em trabalhadores no setor de reforma de baterias para veículos automotores. Foram estudados 39 trabalhadores procedentes de 19 estabelecimentos de pequeno porte, existentes na zona urbana de Salvador, Ba (Brasil). As condições higiênicas do ambiente de trabalho, características biológicas dos trabalhadores e suas percepções dos riscos ocupacionais foram avaliadas e correlacionadas com níveis hemáticos de cádmio, chumbo, eritroprotoporfirina e hematócrito. As concentrações de chumbo e cádmio no sangue foram determinadas por espectrofotometria de absorção atômica sem chama. Trinta e seis (92, 3 %) dentre os 39 operários consideraram que a atividade de reformar baterias poderia ser prejudicial à saúde. A legislação brasileira de segurança, higiene e medicina do trabalho considera as intoxicações por chumbo e cádmio como sendo doenças profissionais quando ocorrem em trabalhadores do setor de reforma de baterias. Entretanto, apenas 7 (17, 9 %) dos 39 operários sabiam que eram potenciais beneficiários desta legislação. Nenhum dos 39 operários sabia que estava exposto ao cádmio nem sobre os riscos ocupacionais decorrentes desta exposição. A média geométrica e o desvio padrão dos níveis de cádmio no sangue estavam extremamente elevados (0, 074; 2, 3 &# 181 mol/l), com 97, 4 % dos operários excedendo o limite de tolerância de 0, 009 &# 181 mol/l. Os valores médios dos níveis de chumbo no sangue e de eritroprotoporfirina foram de 2, 06 5; 1, 4 e 0, 86; 3, 1 &# 181 mol/l, respectivamente. Níveis elevados de chumbo e cádmio no sangue estavam associados a maior idade do operário, maior tempo de serviço na atividade, ventilação insatisfatória do ambiente de trabalho, trabalhar em estabelecimento não incorporado a empresas de ônibus e com o desconhecimento de medidas preventivas contra a intoxicação pelo chumbo. A {{cross-sectional study}} on lead and cadmium poisoning among {{workers from the}} sector engaged in repairing batteries for motor vehicles was carried out. Thirty-nine workers from 19 small establishments, existent in the urban area of Salvador City, State of Bahia, Brazil, were studied. Conditions of hygiene at work place, biological characterization of the workforce and workers' perception of occupational hazards were evaluated and related to blood levels of cadmium, lead, erythroprotoporphyrin and hematocrit. Concentrations of cadmium and lead in blood were determined by flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometry techniques. Thirty-six (92. 3 %) out of the 39 workers mentioned that their job could be hazardous to their health. Brazilian legislation on safety, hygiene and occupational medicine considers lead and cadmium poisoning as being professional diseases when occurring among people working on repairing batteries. However, only 7 (17. 9 %) out the 39 workers {{knew that they were}} potentially eligible for benefits from present legislation. None of the 39 workers knew that they had been exposed to cadmium nor about the occupational risks arising from this exposure. Geometric mean and standard deviation of cadmium in blood levels was extremely high (0. 074; 2. 3 &# 181 mol/ 1), with 97. 4 % of the working population exceeding the reference limit of 0. 009 &# 181 mol/ 1. Mean level of lead in blood was 2. 06; 1. 4 &# 181 mol/l. Only one worker presented blood lead level higher than 3. 36 mmol/ 1, which placed him at a higher risk of presenting clinical lead poisoning. Mean level of erythroprotoporphyrin was 0. 86; 3. 1 &# 181 mol/l. Two workers had low hematocrit levels : 37 and 38 %, respectively. In the whole group, hematocrit levels were poorly correlated with lead or with cadmium levels in blood. A brief, oriented clinical examination did not reveal any clear cases of lead or cadmium poisoning. Higher levels of cadmium and lead in blood were associated with workers' ages above 19 years of age, with amount of time spent in the activity of repairing batteries, poorly <b>ventilated</b> work <b>place,</b> working in establishments which were not incorporated by big bus enterprises and the lack of knowledge about preventive measures against lead poisoning...|$|R
