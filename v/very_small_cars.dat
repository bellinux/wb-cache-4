50|$|Between 1938 and 1945 about 1,000 <b>very</b> <b>small</b> <b>cars</b> were produced. They were {{powered by}} 100 cc engines from Sachs. The cars {{featured}} open-topped bodies with space for two.|$|E
50|$|A microcar is the {{smallest}} automobile classification, usually applied to <b>very</b> <b>small</b> <b>cars</b> (smaller than city cars). Such small cars were generally referred to as cyclecars until the 1940s. More recent models are also called bubble cars due to their bubble-shaped appearance.|$|E
50|$|Most {{car engines}} have {{four to eight}} cylinders, with some {{high-performance}} cars having ten, 12 — or even 16, and some <b>very</b> <b>small</b> <b>cars</b> and trucks having two or three. In previous years, some quite large cars such as the DKW and Saab 92, had two-cylinder or two-stroke engines.|$|E

50|$|Businesses in town include Andres & Wilton Farmers Grain Elevator {{along with}} a <b>very</b> <b>small</b> <b>car</b> dealership. Besides buying and selling grain, the {{elevator}} sells livestock feed, straw, wood shavings, and plastic drainage tile. In October 2006, a strong windstorm demolished a large steel grain bin at the elevator.|$|R
50|$|As {{was normal}} {{at this time}} even for <b>very</b> <b>small</b> <b>cars,</b> a range of body types was available. In {{addition}} to the roadster, open topped sedan/saloon and saloon bodied cars, buyers could also specify various sports style bodies including a single seater featuring a then fashionable “boat-deck” style rear end.|$|E
50|$|New-Map is {{a former}} French {{manufacturer}} of motor-bikes and, more recently, of <b>very</b> <b>small</b> <b>cars</b> and delivery vehicles. The business of powered vehicle production was instigated by Paul Martin at the bicycle plant that had been founded by his father, Joseph Martin, {{at the end of}} the previous century. The motor-bike and small vehicle business operated from Lyon between 1920 and 1956.|$|E
50|$|When riders {{walk up to}} {{the front}} entrance, they see the sign for Gadget's coaster made out of random items. Above the loading dock is a {{portrait}} of the rescue ranger on a postage stamp. The Go Coaster is primarily for children and therefore has <b>very</b> <b>small</b> <b>cars.</b> While two children can easily fit into a single car, most adults would have to travel alone (or with a small child). Guests board a train fashioned from acorns and scavenged parts.|$|E
50|$|A clown {{car is a}} prop in {{a circus}} clown routine. A common {{example of such a}} routine {{involves}} an implausibly large number of clowns emerging from a <b>very</b> <b>small</b> <b>car,</b> to humorous effect. The first performance of this routine was in the Cole Bros. Circus during the 1950s.|$|R
50|$|S'Estanyol {{is reached}} along an un-metalled , or lane which can prove {{difficult}} to find. The cove is 3.5 km {{from the nearest}} village which is called Jesús. Just behind the beach there is a <b>very</b> <b>small</b> <b>car</b> park. To {{the back of the}} beach there is one beach restaurant bar.|$|R
50|$|A small non-airconditioned {{community}} {{hall was}} {{constructed by the}} Church for use by its parishioners. It is built over two floors and has a <b>very</b> <b>small</b> <b>car</b> park. The first floor can seat about 300 people and the dining ground floor can seat about 100. Cars are often parked outside the facility in the land belonging to Church. It is not available during the Church festival period.|$|R
50|$|Straight-twin engines {{have been}} used in <b>very</b> <b>small</b> <b>cars,</b> e.g. microcars, kei cars, and city cars such as the Fiat 500 and 126, NSU Prinz, VAZ Oka, Dacia Lăstun, Daihatsu Cuore, and Mitsubishi Minica. From 1967 to 1972, Honda {{produced}} the N360 and its successors N400 and N600 with straight-two engines in 360 cc, 400 cc, and 600 cc sizes. The Z600 was produced from 1970 to 1972. From 1958 to 1971, Subaru produced the 360 with a rear-mounted, rear-drive 358 cc air-cooled engine.|$|E
5000|$|According to {{a report}} by the U.S. Government's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, among 10 {{different}} classes of passenger vehicles, [...] "very small cars" [...] have the highest fatality rate per mile driven. For instance, a person driving 12,000 miles per year for 55 years would have a 1% chance of being involved in a fatal accident. This is twice the fatality rate of the safest vehicle class, a [...] "large car". According to the data in this report, the number of fatal crashes per mile is only weakly correlated with the vehicle weight, having a correlation coefficient of just (-0.45). A stronger correlation is seen with the vehicle size within its class; for example, [...] "large" [...] cars, pickups and SUVs, have lower fatality rates than [...] "small" [...] cars, pickups and SUVs. This is the case in 7 of the 10 classes, with the exception of mid-size vehicles, where minivans and mid-size cars are among the safest classes, while mid-size SUVs are the second most fatal after <b>very</b> <b>small</b> <b>cars.</b> Even though heavier vehicles sometimes are statistically safer, it is not necessarily the extra weight that causes them to be safer. The NHTSA report states: [...] "Heavier vehicles have historically done a better job cushioning their occupants in crashes. Their longer hoods and extra space in the occupant compartment provide an opportunity for a more gradual deceleration of the vehicle, and of the occupant within the vehicle... While it is conceivable that light vehicles could be built with similarly long hoods and mild deceleration pulses, it would probably require major changes in materials and design and/or taking weight out of their engines, accessories, etc." ...|$|E
50|$|The Simca {{acquisition}} {{triggered a}} major expansion at the Poissy site. During 1955 new factory buildings were constructed {{so that by}} the end of the year, finally, more than half of the site had been built on.During the early 1950s the economy finally started to grow again and the Simca Vedette made a strong start, with 42,439 produced in 1955 and 44,836 in 1956. These figures probably fell well short of the expectations when the site was acquired in 1937, but it was still a fourteenfold increase over the 3,023 cars produced in 1947. Unfortunately the Suez Crisis struck at the end of 1956, and the resulting fuel shortages placed the emphasis back on <b>very</b> <b>small</b> <b>cars.</b> Sales of the V8 Simcas recovered a little by the end of the decade, but production volumes of never again approached those of 1956. Simca responded rapidly by adding to their range the Simca Ariane which was a big car with a small engine, also produced in Poissy, which during the ensuing six years clocked up over 160,0000 sales. However, by now the large car market in France was increasingly dominated by the Citroen DS which was in a lower car tax bracket than the V8 Simcas and had, after slow start, caught the spirit of the new age.By 1961 it was not lack of customer demand that was squeezing Vedette production, but Simca’s own preparations for a return to small car production. Poissy’s large site had always been underutilised, and the Simca 1000 was intended to make far better use of Poissy’s potential capacity than either Ford or Simca had hitherto achieved. With more than 100,000 Simca 1000s produced every year from 1962 to 1973, Simca succeeded in this. Nevertheless, there would still be capacity to spare at Poissy, and in 1961 Simca sold the plant at Nanterre which they had occupied since 1934. After this Poissy was Simca’s only large scale production facility in France.|$|E

50|$|The La Ponette was a French {{automobile}} manufactured from 1909 until 1925. The <b>very</b> <b>small</b> <b>car</b> builder began production with a single-cylinder 697 cc car {{which was}} very similar to a small Renault. This was followed in 1911 by a four-cylinder 1592 cc Ballot-engined vehicle, which was built until 1920. A few minor models were also made using various proprietary engines. The parent company, the Société des Automobiles La Ponette, collapsed in 1925, and the marque ceased production.|$|R
40|$|Compatibility is {{an issue}} that relates to the {{improvement}} of vehicle safety. After frontal and side impact self protection, partner protection, a key component of compatibility, represents the next step forward for passive safety improvement. Compatibility is complicated to achieve, because it requires world-wide industry to take steps in a similar direction. A harmonized approach is difficult to achieve because many differences in vehicle makes and models between the various fleets around the world exist. This leads to incompatibilities between vehicles in a global sense: Asian markets have a high market share of <b>very</b> <b>small</b> <b>cars,</b> the American market is characterized by a high proportion of LTVs and SUVs and the European market is somewhere between the American and the Asian markets. It is obvious that a lot of requirements need to be fulfilled by a compatibility regulation which is; beneficial to the customer, which is scientifically meaningful, refers to front and side-impact and which is applicable for all markets and, last but not least, is considered to be fair by all manufacturers. ACEA is not in the position to suggest a solution meeting all these requirements. However, some test results and observations which could contribute to a solution are presented in this paper. The focus of most proposed compatibility procedures is to improve structural interaction in collisions involving passenger cars. A couple of conditions exist that influence the definition of a geometric zone for structural interaction. A zone for structural interaction has to ensure maximal interaction between passenger vehicles with other passengers vehicles, SUVs/LTV’s and trucks (to be supported by under-run protection systems) can be achieved. This could represent a first step in increasing compatibility within vehicle fleets. Structural interaction is, in fact, the principle requirement for compatibility before the issue of stiffness can be solved. Keeping this in mind, ACEA drafted a road map chartering the path toward improved compatibility, which is presented in this paper...|$|E

50|$|Lucien Rosengart (1881 - 1976) was {{a gifted}} {{engineer}} and businessman who {{had established a}} successful engineering business {{by the time he}} was 24. In the mid-1920s, he saw the opportunity to produce a <b>very</b> <b>small</b> <b>car</b> for a segment of the market in France that he believed was not being properly covered by any of the major players. He therefore purchased, in 1923, a license to build the English Austin 7 and with support from the engineer Jules Salomon he purchased the old Bellanger factory at Neuilly. The site was a large one and in the early years the business appeared set to fill it.|$|R
50|$|This <b>very</b> <b>small</b> <b>car</b> {{originated}} as a fairground Dodgem and was electrically powered. In 1934, {{the designer}} Jack Shillan changed {{the engine to}} a 98 cc Villiers Midget single-cylinder engine and sold it for road use. The transmission was single speed and operated by a single pedal which opened the throttle on being pressed down and applied the brake when released. The clutch was automatic. There were no springs. Drive was {{to one of the}} rear wheels and the single brake operated on the other. It was said to be capable of reaching 15 mph (25 km/h). The body was open and had a single seat.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, General Motors Company {{directed}} its GM R&D and Pontiac divisions to develop concept mini-cars for urban drivers. Pontiac developed the Pontiac X-4 with a radical two stroke aircraft type radial engine, and GM developed the XP-883 an experimental plug-in hybrid car demonstrated by General Motors in 1969. Primarily {{intended as a}} commuter vehicle, the <b>very</b> <b>small</b> <b>car</b> had a fiberglass body with a design resembling the future Chevrolet Vega or Ford Pinto. The two-door hatchback had seating for two adults and two children, though the children sat in rear-facing seats and would enter and exit through the tailgate. It was powered by {{the combination of a}} two-cylinder engine and a DC electric motor. Electricity was stored in six 12-volt batteries placed between the rear wheels.|$|R
50|$|Increasingly {{affluent}} customers {{may have}} encouraged Vincent {{to go for}} a 'high end' luxury touring model, {{but at the same time}} high volume and <b>very</b> affordable <b>small</b> <b>cars</b> were flooding the market. Vincent's accountants suddenly realised that they were losing money on every Black Knight sold, so the last example of both the model and the marque left the production line on Friday, 16 December 1955.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to find a {{connection}} between changes in societies and changes in semantic prototypes by examining the prototypes of ‘fruit’ and ‘car’ among Slovenes that reached adulthood in Yugoslavia and Slovenes that that reached adulthood in the Republic of Slovenia and to compare those results with a control group of native English speakers. The results of the study suggests that in some aspects, the prototypes of ‘fruit’ and ‘car’ amongyounger Slovenes have moved closer to what they are in cultures that have a long history of capitalism and consumerism. The opinions about how good an example of a ‘fruit’ a banana is, is the best example of this. Younger Slovenes and the control group see it as a very good example, while older Slovenes rated it lower. The older Slovenes were also slightly more accepting of a <b>very</b> <b>small</b> <b>car</b> model being a good example of a ‘car’, than both younger Slovenes and the control group were...|$|R

50|$|Unfortunately {{production}} of the Supertraction was never large, and the factory was destroyed by the German Army following the German invasion. The business was able to survive the German occupation but did not produce cars during the conflict. After the war Lucien Rosengart, who spent the war in exile in the United States, returned to France and tried to guide his company back to the {{production of}} the <b>small</b> <b>cars</b> on which its success in the 1920s and 1930s had been based. Unfortunately, the several major manufacturers of France were by then making <b>very</b> <b>small,</b> economical <b>cars</b> that were very well suited to the conditions of post-war France, achieving sales volumes and economies of scale that the Rosengart branded car from SIOP were quite unable to match, leaving the Neuilly plant massively underutilised.|$|R
50|$|The initial {{problems}} {{damaged the}} Imp's reputation and popularity trailed off, {{with half of}} all production being from the first three years. It still sold thanks to its competitive price, distinctive styling, and cheap running costs, but sales never lived up to expectations for what had become a <b>very</b> competent <b>small</b> <b>car.</b> Another problem {{that contributed to the}} reputation for poor reliability was the lack of understanding of the maintenance needs of alloy engines by owners and the motor trade in the 1960s. Regular failures of the Giubo couplings also occurred. It was overshadowed in popularity by the Mini.|$|R
50|$|The narrow {{profit margins}} of economy cars can cause {{financial}} instability for their manufacturers. Historically, Volkswagen in the 1970s and Ford in the 1920s almost collapsed {{because of their}} one model economy car business strategy. Ford was saved by the Model A and Volkswagen was saved by the Golf. Ford started the Mercury and Lincoln brands to diversify its product range. VW {{moved away from the}} narrow profit margins of economy cars, by expanding its range so that now it spans from <b>very</b> <b>small</b> city <b>cars</b> like the Volkswagen Up to Audis and Bentleys, and it also owns SEAT and Skoda.|$|R
50|$|Unfortunately {{production}} of the Supertraction was never large, and the company was devastated by the Nazi invasion of France. The company was able to survive the German occupation of France until after the war but did not produce cars during the conflict. After the war Rosengart, {{who had been in}} the United States (while his son stayed in the south of France), tried to guide his company back to the <b>small</b> <b>cars</b> that had made it a success in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Unfortunately, the major manufacturers of France were by then making <b>very</b> <b>small,</b> economical <b>cars</b> that were very well suited to the conditions of post-war France. The last Rosengart car, the Ariette, was produced from 1947 to 1954, but failed to sell. The company closed its doors in the summer of 1955, after failing to launch its new car, the Sagaie, a development of the Ariette with a flat-twin engine.|$|R
50|$|The Countryman {{hatchback}} appeared {{exactly a}} year later in October 1959, and differed from the saloon in that the rear window was marginally smaller, {{to allow for a}} frame that could be lifted up, with its own support, while the lower panel was now flush with the floor and its hinges had been strengthened. It was a <b>very</b> <b>small</b> estate <b>car</b> with a horizontally split tailgate having a top-hinged upper door and bottom-hinged lower door. October 1959 also saw the standardisation on both cars of self-cancelling indicators and the provision of a centre interior light and, in early summer 1960, a flat lid was added over the spare wheel in the rear luggage compartment.|$|R
50|$|Raw {{material}} {{shortages and}} general economic difficulties in Europe following the Second World War made <b>very</b> <b>small,</b> economical <b>cars</b> popular in many countries. In Spain, following the Spanish Civil War and the embargo declared by the United Nations against General Francisco Franco's dictatorship, {{the situation was}} even worse. The combination of relative underdevelopment, war devastation and an international trade embargo meant that the country operated {{at a much lower}} economic level than the rest of Western Europe for nearly two decades and was forced to develop domestic substitutes for hard-to-get imported products and technologies. The Biscúter, tiny, simple, and cheap even by microcar standards, was a product of this economic environment and was well suited to its time and market.|$|R
50|$|Pyeonghwa has the {{exclusive}} rights to car production, purchase, and sale of used cars in North Korea. However, most North Koreans are unable to afford a car. Because of the <b>very</b> <b>small</b> market for <b>cars</b> in the country, Pyeonghwa's output is reportedly very low. In 2003, only 314 cars were produced even though the factory had the facilities to produce up to 10,000 cars a year. Erik van Ingen Schenau, {{author of the book}} Automobiles Made in North Korea, has estimated the company's total production in 2005 at not more than around 400 units.|$|R
5000|$|Zoe Motors' best-known {{product was}} its Zoe Zipper vehicle, a <b>very</b> <b>small</b> {{three-wheeled}} single-seat <b>car</b> (or [...] "microcar") {{based on a}} 50 cc Honda motorcycle engine. It was manufactured by Mitsuoka Motors of Japan, introduced there in 1982 and made its American debut the following year in 1983, where Zoe had distribution and branding rights to the vehicle. In the US, the Zipper {{could be considered a}} motorcycle for registration and insurance purposes, making it somewhat simpler to own than a full-sized car. The Zipper was sold in both a convertible and a hardtop model.|$|R
