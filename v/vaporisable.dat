25|$|In radiant-heat {{experiments}} {{that called for}} much laboratory expertise in the early 1860s, he showed {{for a variety of}} readily <b>vaporisable</b> liquids that, molecule for molecule, the vapour form and the liquid form have essentially the same power to absorb radiant heat. (In modern experiments using narrow-band spectra, some small differences are found that Tyndall's equipment was unable to get at; see e.g. absorption spectrum of H2O).|$|E
40|$|Impact {{ionisation}} is {{a standard}} procedure to ionise gaseous or <b>vaporisable</b> substances in organic mass spectrometry. In this work, a "softer" ionisation is introduced {{which seems to be}} an alternative ion source for reducing collision between substance molecules and the hot internal walls of the box. Through collision mainly found in impact ionisation sources, fragments are built especially from thermally sensitive substances falsifying the spectra. We present here photoelectron emitting materials for the soft ionisation using semiconducting compounds, galliumn nitride (GaN), and a representative of the borides, lanthanum hexaboride (LaB 6). They are evaluated by photoelectron spectroscopic studies. (C) 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim...|$|E
