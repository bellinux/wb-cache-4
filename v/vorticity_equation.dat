500|$|The first {{successful}} numerical prediction was performed using the ENIAC digital computer in 1950 {{by a team}} composed of American meteorologists Jule Charney, Philip Thompson, Larry Gates, and Norwegian meteorologist Ragnar Fjørtoft, applied mathematician John von Neumann, and computer programmer Klara Dan von Neumann. [...] They used a simplified form of atmospheric dynamics based on solving the barotropic <b>vorticity</b> <b>equation</b> over a single layer of the atmosphere, by computing the geopotential height of the atmosphere's [...] pressure surface. [...] This simplification greatly reduced demands on computer time and memory, so the computations could be performed on the relatively primitive computers of the day. [...] When news of the first weather forecast by ENIAC was received by Richardson in 1950, he remarked that the results were an [...] "enormous scientific advance." [...] The first calculations for a 24‑hour forecast took ENIAC nearly 24hours to produce, but Charney's group noted that {{most of that time}} was spent in [...] "manual operations", and expressed hope that forecasts of the weather before it occurs would soon be realized.|$|E
40|$|The {{barotropic}} {{motion of}} a viscous fluid {{in a laboratory}} simulation of ocean circulation may be modelled by Beards ley's <b>vorticity</b> <b>equations.</b> It is established here that these equations have unique smooth solutions which depend continuously on initial conditions. To avoid a boundary condition which involves an integral operator, the <b>vorticity</b> <b>equations</b> are replaced by an equivalent system of momentum equations. The system resembles the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in a rotating reference frame. The existence of unique generalized solutions of the system in a square domain is established by modifying arguments used by Ladyzhenskaya for the Navier-Stokes equations. Smoothness of the solutions is then established by modifying Golovkin's arguments, again originally for the Navier- Stokes equations. A numerical procedure for solving the <b>vorticity</b> <b>equations</b> is discussed, as are the effects of reentrant corners in the domain modelling islands and peninsulae...|$|R

The <b>vorticity</b> <b>equations</b> were spatially filtered to define the large scale turbulence field, and the subgrid scale turbulence was modeled. A general method was developed to show numerical conservation of momentum, vorticity, and energy. The terms that arise from filtering the equations were treated (for both periodic boundary conditions and no stress boundary conditions) in a fast and accurate way by using fast Fourier transforms. Use of vorticity as the principal variable is shown to produce results equivalent to those obtained by use of the primitive variable equations...|$|R

2500|$|Barotropic models {{assume the}} {{atmosphere}} is nearly barotropic, {{which means that the}} direction and speed of the geostrophic wind are independent of height. [...] In other words, no vertical wind shear of the geostrophic wind. [...] It also implies that thickness contours (a proxy for temperature) are parallel to upper level height contours. [...] In this type of atmosphere, high and low pressure areas are centers of warm and cold temperature anomalies. [...] Warm-core highs (such as the subtropical ridge and Bermuda-Azores high) and cold-core lows have strengthening winds with height, with the reverse true for cold-core highs (shallow arctic highs) and warm-core lows (such as tropical cyclones). A barotropic model tries to solve a simplified form of atmospheric dynamics {{based on the assumption that}} {{the atmosphere is}} in geostrophic balance; that is, that the Rossby number of the air in the atmosphere is small. If the assumption is made that the atmosphere is divergence-free, the curl of the Euler equations reduces into the barotropic <b>vorticity</b> <b>equation.</b> This latter equation can be solved over a single layer of the atmosphere. Since the atmosphere at a height of approximately [...] is mostly divergence-free, the barotropic model best approximates the state of the atmosphere at a geopotential height corresponding to that altitude, which corresponds to the atmosphere's [...] pressure surface.|$|E

40|$|Abstracts: A {{new set of}} basis {{functions}} {{was constructed}} using the Rossby-Haurwitz waves, which are the eigenfunctions of nondivergent barotropic <b>vorticity</b> <b>equations</b> on the sphere. The basis functions were designed to be non-separable, that is, not factored into functions of either the longitude or the latitude. Due to this property, the nodal lines of the functions are aligned neither along with the meridian nor the parallel. The basis functions can be categorized into groups of which members have the same degree or the total wavenumber-like index on the sphere. The orthonormality of the basis functions {{were found to be}} close to the machine roundoffs, giving the error of O(10 − 15) or O(10 − 16) for double-precision computation (64 bit arithmetic). It was demonstrated through time-stepping procedure that the basis functions were also the eigenfunctions of the non-divergent barotropic <b>vorticity</b> <b>equations.</b> The projection of the basis functions was carried out onto the low-resolution geopotential field of Gaussian bell, and compared with the theory. The same projections were performed for the observed atmospheric-geopotential height field of 500 hPa surface to demonstrate decomposition into the fields that contain disturbance of certain range of horizontal scales. The usefulness of the new basis functions was thus addressed for application to the eigenmode analysis of the atmospheric motions on the global domain...|$|R
