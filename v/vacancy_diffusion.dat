Our mesoscopic model consists of the <b>vacancy</b> bulk <b>diffusion</b> equation and a dislocation climb velocity formula. The effects of pipe diffusion and the jog structure on dislocations are incorporated by a Robin boundary condition near the dislocations for the bulk diffusion equation and a new contribution in the dislocation climb velocity due to <b>vacancy</b> pipe <b>diffusion</b> driven by the stress variation along the dislocation. Our climb formulation is able to quantitatively describe the translation of prismatic loops at low temperatures when the bulk diffusion is negligible.

50|$|A {{dislocation}} {{that has}} been brought to a halt by an obstacle (a point defect) can overcome the obstacle and start moving again by a process called dislocation climb. For dislocation climb to occur, vacancies {{have to be able}} to move through the crystal. When a vacancy arrives at the place where the dislocation is stuck it can cause the dislocation to climb out of its glide plane, after which the point defect is no longer in its way. Dislocation climb is therefore dependent from the velocity of <b>vacancy</b> <b>diffusion.</b> As with all diffusion processes, this is highly dependent on the temperature. At higher temperatures dislocations will more easily be able to move around obstacles. For this reason, many hardened materials become exponentially weaker at higher temperatures.|$|E

We find that D for coulomb crystals with relatively soft-core 1 /r interactions may be larger than D for Lennard-Jones or other solids with harder-core interactions. Diffusion, for simulations of nearly perfect body-centered-cubic lattices, involves the exchange of ions in ring-like configurations.
