5|$|A Polish Nobleman is a 1637 {{painting}} by Rembrandt depicting {{a man in}} a costume of either Polish szlachta or boyar nobility. The identity of the subject of the painting is unclear, and has given rise to several different interpretations.

5|$|A report {{published}} in 2007 by the Consultative Committee for Thermometry (CCT) to the CIPM noted that their current definition of temperature {{has proved to}} be unsatisfactory for temperatures below 20 kelvins and for temperatures above 1300 kelvins.

5|$|As a Justice, Black {{held the}} <b>view</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Court should {{literally}} enforce constitutional guarantees, especially the First Amendment free speech clause.

Black maintained that literalism was necessary to cabin judicial power.|$|E

5|$|Despite growing {{pressure}} for his deposition, Stigand continued {{to attend the}} royal court and to consecrate bishops, until in 1070 he was deposed by papal legates and imprisoned at Winchester.

50|$|In 1903, the Gajret {{cultural}} {{society was}} established; it promoted Serbian identity among the Slavic Muslims of Austria-Hungary (today's Bosnia and Herzegovina) and <b>viewed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Muslims were Serbs lacking ethnic consciousness. <b>The</b> <b>view</b> <b>that</b> Muslims were Serbs {{is probably the}} oldest of three ethnic theories among the Bosnian Muslims themselves.|$|R

5|$|Ignosticism is {{the view}} that a {{coherent}} definition of a deity must be put forward before {{the question of the}} existence of a deity can be meaningfully discussed.

5|$|After the trial, Kenealy instigated {{a popular}} radical reform movement, the Magna Charta Association, which championed the Claimant's cause for some years. Kenealy {{was elected to}} Parliament in 1875 as a radical {{independent}} but was not an effective parliamentarian. The movement was in decline when the Claimant was released in 1884, {{and he had no}} dealings with it. In 1895, he confessed to being Orton, only to recant almost immediately. He lived generally in poverty {{for the rest of his}} life and was destitute at the time of his death in 1898. Although most commentators have accepted the court's <b>view</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Claimant was Orton, some analysts believe that an element of doubt remains as to his true identity and that, conceivably, he was Roger Tichborne.|$|E
5|$|All the {{foregoing}} rules and aids and difficulties in classification are explained, if I do not greatly deceive myself, on the <b>view</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> natural system {{is founded on}} descent with modification; that the characters which naturalists consider as showing true affinity between any two or more species, are those which have been inherited from a common parent, and, in so far, all true classification is genealogical; that community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking,...|$|E

5|$|Before 2000, {{arguments}} that the Deccan Traps flood basalts caused the extinction were usually {{linked to the}} <b>view</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> extinction was gradual, as the flood basalt events were thought to have started around 68Mya and lasted more than 2 million years.

5|$|Described by Kartodikromo as an {{extended}} simile, Student Hidjo {{has been noted}} as depicting a new Indonesian youth culture which has adopted Western cultural and lingual facets.

5|$|Dietrich Wildung {{proposed}} that the bust in Berlin was a model for official portraits and {{was used by the}} master sculptor for teaching his pupils how to carve the internal structure of the eye, and thus the left iris was not added.

5|$|Early Reformed theologians such as John Calvin and Huldrych Zwingli {{rejected}} the medieval belief in transubstantiation, that {{the bread and}} wine of the Eucharist change into Christ's body and blood, but taught that Christ's person, including his body and blood, are presented to Christians who partake of it in faith. They also disagree with Martin Luther and the Lutheran tradition which taught that Christ's body is physically eaten with the mouth in the sacrament. Later Reformed orthodox theologians continued to teach views {{similar to that of}} Calvin and Zwingli. In the modern period, Karl Barth espoused a symbolic <b>view</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sacrament only communicates God's promises rather than functioning to actually confer these promises.
