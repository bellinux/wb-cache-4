60|$|Thus, for instance, {{the roof}} of Milan Cathedral is {{seemingly}} covered with elaborate fan tracery, forcibly enough painted to enable it, in its dark and removed position, to deceive a careless observer.

50|$|The London 1899 chess tournament {{was without}} a doubt one of the <b>very</b> <b>strongest</b> tournaments ever held on British soil.

5|$|Despite {{his power}} advantage, Woods has always focused on {{developing}} an excellent all-around game. Although {{in recent years}} he has typically been {{near the bottom of}} the Tour rankings in driving accuracy, his iron play is generally accurate, his recovery and bunker play is <b>very</b> <b>strong,</b> and his putting (especially under pressure) is possibly his greatest asset. He is largely responsible for a shift to higher standards of athleticism amongst professional golfers, and is known for utilizing more hours of practice than most.|$|E
5|$|Earthquakes in Alabama are sporadic, {{and tend}} to cause little to no damage. During a 91-year period, there were 19earthquakes, varying from near-imperceptible to damaging. The first known {{activity}} in Alabama, the New Madrid earthquakes of 1812, registered Mercalli intensities of VII (<b>Very</b> <b>strong)</b> throughout the northern and central portions of the state.

5|$|Glacial {{acetic acid}} {{is used in}} {{analytical}} chemistry for the estimation of weakly alkaline substances such as organic amides. Glacial acetic acid is a much weaker base than water, so the amide behaves as a strong base in this medium.

50|$|The Ards peninsula, however, is a hurling stronghold {{within the}} county, {{and while the}} county hurling team are not among the <b>very</b> <b>strongest</b> on the island, {{competing}} in the second tier Christy Ring Cup, the 'Ardsmen' (as opposed to the nickname of the football team, the 'Mourne men') have won a number of Ulster Senior and Minor Hurling Championships despite the historical provincial dominance in that sport of Antrim.|$|R
50|$|The {{strength}} {{of the military and}} community forts varied widely. Surprisingly, some of the forts built by communities were considerably more defendable than some built by the military. A few of the <b>very</b> <b>strongest</b> forts, however, were established by the Army. Fort Sully, built overlooking Fort Leavenworth, was built in a location making it practically impregnable. Camp Ben Butler, at Baxter Springs, was also perched in a practically impregnable location.|$|R
60|$|Frank, {{without the}} least {{intending}} it, {{had taken up}} the <b>very</b> <b>strongest</b> military position. Let a man once make a woman understand, or fancy, that {{he knows that he}} is nothing to her; and confess boldly that there is a great gulf fixed between them, which he has no mind to bridge over: and then there is little that he may not see or do, for good or for evil.|$|R
5|$|He’s {{had a huge}} role in my career. There’s {{no doubt}} about that. I value his opinion. But as a person, Salman has had the biggest impact on my life.

5|$|His {{primary focus}} was gay-themed writing, though {{he also wrote}} about the {{entertainment}} industry. Mostly satirical, his writing was filled with increasingly clear anger and disdain for the Republican neo-con agenda, especially after the AIDS pandemic began to take a large toll on the gay community. A <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> voice in gay literature, Baker had admirers and detractors for his gay radical stance, both in the mainstream literary {{community as well as}} the gay community itself.|$|E
5|$|Ned Flanders - (Unlockable) Ned Flanders is a weak {{character}} with <b>very</b> <b>strong</b> special attacks. His prayer attack {{is the most}} damaging in the game as it causes high damage, stuns instantly and hits repeatedly anywhere in the ring. He also fully recovers when pinned, so opponents must beat him twice just to win one singular round.|$|E
60|$|Farnie must {{be brought}} back. That was plain. And {{he must be}} brought back at once, before anyone could get to hear of what had happened. Gethryn had the <b>very</b> <b>strongest</b> {{objections}} to his uncle, considered purely as a human being; but the fact remained that he was his uncle, and the Bishop had equally strong objections to any member of his family being mixed up in a business of this description.|$|R
