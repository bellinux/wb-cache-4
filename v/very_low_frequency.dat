5|$|The {{use of a}} {{subwoofer}} augments {{the bass}} capability of the main speakers, and allows them to be smaller without sacrificing low frequency capability. A subwoofer does not necessarily provide superior bass performance in comparison to large conventional loudspeakers on ordinary music recordings due to the typical lack of <b>very</b> <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> content on such sources. However, there are recordings with substantial low frequency content that most conventional loudspeakers are ill-equipped to handle {{without the help of}} a subwoofer, especially at high playback levels, such as music for pipe organs with 32' (9.75 meter) bass pipes (16Hz), very large bass drums on symphony orchestra recordings and electronic music with extremely low synth bass parts, such as bass tests or bass songs.|$|E

25|$|The main antenna {{consisted}} of two lead weighted 120-meter-long wires deployed by electric motor or hand crank. The emergency antenna was a 40-meter wire stretched from a ring on the airship hull. Three high-quality, six-tube receivers served the wavelength ranges 120 to 1,200m (medium frequency), 400 to 4,000m (low frequency) and 3,000 to 25,000m (overlapping low frequency and <b>very</b> <b>low</b> <b>frequency).</b> The radio room also had a shortwave receiver for wavelengths 10 to 280m (high frequency).|$|E

25|$|When the Sun is active, strong solar flares {{can occur}} that {{will hit the}} sunlit side of Earth with hard X-rays. The X-rays will {{penetrate}} to the D-region, releasing electrons that will rapidly increase absorption, causing a high frequency (3–30nbsp&MHz) radio blackout. During this time <b>very</b> <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> (3–30nbsp&kHz) signals will be reflected by the D layer instead of the E layer, where the increased atmospheric density will usually increase the absorption of the wave and thus dampen it. As soon as the X-rays end, the sudden ionospheric disturbance (SID) or radio black-out ends as the electrons in the D-region recombine rapidly and signal strengths return to normal.|$|E
25|$|In the Earth's {{magnetic}} field, NMR frequencies are in {{the audio}} frequency range, or the <b>very</b> <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> and ultra low frequency bands of the radio frequency spectrum. Earth's field NMR (EFNMR) is typically stimulated by applying a relatively strong dc magnetic field pulse to the sample and, {{after the end of}} the pulse, analyzing the resulting low frequency alternating magnetic field that occurs in the Earth's magnetic field due to free induction decay (FID). These effects are exploited in some types of magnetometers, EFNMR spectrometers, and MRI imagers. Their inexpensive portable nature makes these instruments valuable for field use and for teaching the principles of NMR and MRI.|$|E

25|$|The precise {{details of}} how a British Prime Minister would {{authorise}} a nuclear strike remain secret, although {{the principles of the}} Trident missile control system is believed {{to be based on the}} plan set up for Polaris in 1968, which has now been declassified. A closed-circuit television system was set up between 10 Downing Street and the SSBN Control Officer at the Northwood Headquarters of the Royal Navy. Both the Prime Minister and the SSBN Control Officer would be able to see each other on their monitors when the command was given. If the link failed – for instance during a nuclear attack or when the PM was away from Downing Street – the Prime Minister would send an authentication code which could be verified at Northwood. The PM would then broadcast a firing order to the SSBN submarines via the <b>Very</b> <b>Low</b> <b>Frequency</b> radio station at Rugby. The UK has not deployed control equipment requiring codes to be sent before weapons can be used, such as the U.S. Permissive Action Link, which if installed would preclude the possibility that military officers could launch British nuclear weapons without authorisation.|$|E
25|$|Tonearm skating {{forces and}} other {{perturbations}} are also {{picked up by}} the stylus. This is a form of frequency multiplexing as the control signal (restoring force) used to keep the stylus in the groove is carried by the same mechanism as the sound itself. Subsonic frequencies below about 20Hz in the audio signal are dominated by tracking effects, which is one form of unwanted rumble ("tracking noise") and merges with audible frequencies in the deep bass range up to about 100Hz. High fidelity sound equipment can reproduce tracking noise and rumble. During a quiet passage, woofer speaker cones can sometimes be seen to vibrate with the subsonic tracking of the stylus, at frequencies as low as just above 0.5Hz (the frequency at which a rpm record turns on the turntable; Hz exactly on an ideal turntable). Another reason for <b>very</b> <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> material can be a warped disk: its undulations produce frequencies of only a few hertz and present day amplifiers have large power bandwidths. For this reason, many stereo receivers contained a switchable subsonic filter. Some subsonic content is directly out of phase in each channel. If played back on a mono subwoofer system, the noise will cancel, significantly reducing the amount of rumble that is reproduced.|$|E
25|$|Wild-type AAV has {{attracted}} considerable interest from gene therapy researchers {{due to a}} number of features. Chief amongst these is the virus's apparent lack of pathogenicity. It can also infect non-dividing cells and has the ability to stably integrate into the host cell genome at a specific site (designated AAVS1) in the human chromosome 19. This feature makes it somewhat more predictable than retroviruses, which present the threat of a random insertion and of mutagenesis, which is sometimes followed by development of a cancer. The AAV genome integrates most frequently into the site mentioned, while random incorporations into the genome take place with a negligible frequency. Development of AAVs as gene therapy vectors, however, has eliminated this integrative capacity by removal of the rep and cap from the DNA of the vector. The desired gene together with a promoter to drive transcription of the gene is inserted between the inverted terminal repeats (ITR) that aid in concatemer formation in the nucleus after the single-stranded vector DNA is converted by host cell DNA polymerase complexes into double-stranded DNA. AAV-based gene therapy vectors form episomal concatemers in the host cell nucleus. In non-dividing cells, these concatemers remain intact {{for the life of the}} host cell. In dividing cells, AAV DNA is lost through cell division, since the episomal DNA is not replicated along with the host cell DNA. Random integration of AAV DNA into the host genome is detectable but occurs at <b>very</b> <b>low</b> <b>frequency.</b> AAVs also present very low immunogenicity, seemingly restricted to generation of neutralizing antibodies, while they induce no clearly defined cytotoxic response. This feature, along with the ability to infect quiescent cells present their dominance over adenoviruses as vectors for human gene therapy.|$|E
