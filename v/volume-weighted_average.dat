40|$|Formaldehyde (HCHO) is a labile organic {{compound}} involved in several important processes occurring within the troposphere. Atmospheric deposition {{is a significant}} source of HCHO since concentrations in rainwater are proposed to be up to three orders of magnitude higher than in surface waters. Despite the significance of HCHO to the chemistry of the troposphere very few works have been addressed the occurrence and variability of this compound in rain. Especially no work has been reported for the Mediterranean or the Southern Europe. We report in this study HCHO concentrations measured in 66 rain samples in Heraklion (Crete) from September 1999 to May 2000 (i. e. during the rainy period). Concentrations ranged from 12. 7 to 334 ppb, in the range of HCHO levels reported at other locations world-wide. The <b>volume-weighted</b> annual <b>average</b> rainwater formaldehyde concentration was 91. 6 ppb and comprised approximately 3 % of the dissolved total carbon. Formaldehyde levels in rain water were found to be air-masses origin dependant since the per event deposition of HCHO when air masses originated from Europe or Balkans were 3 - 4 times higher compared to that from Africa or from marine sectors. Formaldehyde was positively correlated with formic acid, non-sea-salt sulfate, nitrate and ammonium. Ambient concentrations of HCHO measured during EL-CID campaign at Finokalia (Crete) in a total of 214 samples. HCHO concentrations ranged between 0. 18 and 1. 01 ppbv with an overall average value of 0. 54 ppbv. A diurnal variation has been observed which exhibits the daytime photo-oxidation production and destruction and the night-time production from the oxidation of dimethylsulfide (DMS) through nitrate (NO 3.) radicals. Very good correlation was observed between HCHO, Black Carbon (BC) and carbon monoxide (CO) during the biomass burning events which were occurred all over Greece during a period of the campaign...|$|R

An assessment of the magnitude and seasonal variation of atmospheric Hg deposition in the Lake Champlain basin was initiated in December 1992 with one year of event precipitation collection, as well as collection of vapor and particle phase Hg in ambient air. Samples were collected at the Vermont Monitoring Cooperative air monitoring site at the Proctor Maple Research Center in Underhill Center, VT. The <b>average</b> <b>volume-weighted</b> concentration for Hg in precipitation was 8. 3 ng/L for the sampling year and the average amount of Hg deposited with each precipitation event was 0. 069 μg/m 2. The total amount of Hg deposited through precipitation during 1993 was 9. 26 μg/m 2 /yr. A seasonal pattern for Hg in precipitation was evident, with increased concentrations and deposition during spring and summer months. Meteorological analysis indicated {{the highest levels of}} Hg in precipitation were associated with regional transport from the south regardless of season, and with transport from the west, southwest and northwest during spring and summer months. Concentrations of ambient vapor phase Hg were typical of rural locations and consistent across seasons.

40|$|Lake St. Croix is {{a natural}} {{impoundment}} located {{at the southern end}} of the St. Croix River. Land use changes since European settlement (c. 1850) have resulted in nutrient runoff, eutrophication, and periodic oxygen depletion in the hypolimnion of Lake St. Croix. Establishing sound lake management practices requires knowledge of historical conditions obtained through paleoecological studies. Remains of non-biting midges (Insecta: Diptera Chironomidae) in lake sediments have been shown to be reliable indicators of past hypolimnetic oxygen conditions. Cores from two sub-basins in the lake were collected in 2006. Midge analysis indicated that shifts in species assemblages correspond to the times of land use change. Chironomus and Procladius, which are tolerant of low oxygen levels, increased in relative abundance as land use changes adversely impacted the St. Croix River’s watershed. Volume-weighted hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations were estimated using a transfer function developed for southern Ontario. Mean post-settlement chironomid reconstructed <b>average</b> <b>volume-weighted</b> hypolimnetic oxygen values were 0. 73 mg/L lower than mean pre-settlement values for sub-basin 1, near Prescott, WI and 0. 45 mg/L lower for sub-basin 3, near Lakeland, MN. These results indicate that oxygen depletion has occurred in the lake since the time of European settlement, and are supported by increases in the relative abundance of eutrophic midge bioindicators and the decrease in relative abundance of bioindicators of less productive conditions since the 1850 s. This study, in conjunction with other historical and paleoecological studies of Lake St. Croix, provides historical data for setting management goals and strategies for Lake St. Croix...|$|R
40|$|The {{rates of}} water and solute {{transport}} tend to be lower in fibrous materials than in bulk solution. This phenomenon of "hindered transport" is caused by steric, hydrodynamic, and electrostatic interactions between the solvent, the solute, and the fibers. In this research {{the effect of these}} interactions were studied using charged, fibrous agarose-glycosaminoglycan (GAG) membranes. The work was motivated by current research into the role of the glomerular capillary wall (GCW) in ultrafiltering blood plasma, which {{is the first step in}} the processing of blood by the kidney. The GCW is composed of three layers in series: an endothelium, a basement membrane, and an epithelium. Intreasing evidence from experimental results and theoretical models of the GCW indicate that the endothelial layer and its associated glycocalyx may significantly limit the transport of macromolecules across the glomerular barrier. The glycocalyx is primarily composed of proteoglycans, a fibrous mixtures of proteins and anionic GAG. GAG fibers are present in many other biological materials, such as basement membranes and cartilage, making the current studies in agarose-GAG relevant to a variety of biological systems. Agarose-GAG membranes were synthesized by using 1 -cyano- 4 -(dimethylamino) pyridinium tetrafluoroborate (CDAP) to create reactive sites in thin agarose hydrogels. Chondroitin sulfate GAG was then covalently bound to the reactive sites via their terminal amine group. By manipulating the temperature and duration of key reaction steps, the synthesis was optimized to provide high bound GAG yields and a spatially uniform distribution of GAG throughout the membrane. Models of the coupling reaction were developed to guide the synthesis conditions, resulting in 70 - 115 [mu]m-thick membranes composed of 2 - 4 v% agarose and 0 - 0. 4 v% GAG. (cont.) The Darcy (or hydraulic) permeabilities of the membranes with variable GAG content were measured with buffer solutions over a range of ionic strengths. In 3 v% agarose gels, the addition of even a small amount of GAG (0. 4 v%) resulted in a two-fold reduction in the Darcy permeability. Electrokinetic coupling, caused by the flow of ions past the charged GAG fibers, resulted in an additional two-fold reduction in the opencircuit hydraulic permeability when the solution ionic strength was decreased from 1 M to 0. 011 M. A microstructural model was used to understand these phenomena, accounting for the charge of the GAG fibers, heterogeneities in the agarose gels, and the mixture of agarose and GAG fibers. Several "mixing rules" from the literature were compared to predict the permeability of a mixture of fibers from structural models for a single fiber type. A fiber <b>volume-weighted</b> <b>averaging</b> of each fiber resistivity was found to be reasonably reliable, with a root-mean-squared error of 24 % for 64 cases of fiber mixtures with differing radii, orientation, and/or charge. The microstructural model, using this mixing rule, accurately predicted the Darcy permeability when charge effects were suppressed at high ionic strengths; however, this model underestimated the reduction in permeability at lower ionic strengths when the effects of the GAG charge were significant. A macroscopic approach to electrokinetic effects using Donnan equilibria better captured the decrease in Darcy permeability with decreasing ionic strength. Studies of equilibrium partitioning and sieving were performed with BSA (an anionic globular protein) and Ficoll (an uncharged spherical polysaccharide). The effects of charge were studied by varying the ionic strength in experiments with BSA; the effects of solute size were examined by using Ficolls with radii ranging from 2. 7 to 5. 9 nm. (cont.) Solute permeability studies were performed in 4 v% agarose gels with 0 or 0. 2 v% GAG. Partition coefficients (F) for BSA were measured for ionic strengths of 0. 5 to 0. 011 M. For BSA in agarose gels with no GAG, F = 0. 65 ± 0. 02 (standard error) and did not vary with ionic strength. In gels with 0. 2 v% GAG, F = 0. 54 ± 0. 02 at ionic strengths = 0. 2 M, but decreased by nearly two-fold at 0. 011 M. For the same Stokes-Einstein radius (3. 5 - 3. 6 nm), the partition coefficients of BSA at neutral conditions and of Ficoll were similar in blank agarose gels, but differed by 15 % in agarose-GAG gels. The partition coefficients for Ficolls decreased with increasing solute radius. A microstructural model for partitioning in fibrous materials was evaluated against the experimental observations. The experimental data were most consistent models that had a nearly homogeneous fiber density. The model was in good agreement for partition coefficients of Ficolls with various radii. The decrease in BSA partition coefficient at low ionic strengths was well captured by both microstructural and Donnan models of charge effects. The sieving coefficient (T), or ratio of downstream to upstream solute concentrations, was measured at moderately high Péclet number where T = FKc, where Kc is the convective hindrance factor. It has been hypothesized by others that Kc is independent of charge, such than any charge effects in T are caused by F. Sieving coefficients were measured under similar conditions as partition coefficients. Like partitioning, ionic strength had little effect on the sieving of BSA through blank agarose, but T was decreased by over half from 0. 1 M to 0. 011 M in gels with 0. 2 v% GAG. In these agarose-GAG gels, there was not a statistically significant effect of ionic strength on Kc. Models used for agarose-GAG membranes were applied to a simple model of the glomerular endothelial glycocalyx. (cont.) The composition and structure of the glycocalyx are not well characterized, but some of its properties can be inferred from the properties of the entire capillary wall and the other capillary layers. Models of the hydraulic permeability of the endothelium suggest that the glycocalyx may be up to several hundred nanometers thick, but the GAG density is probably less than 4 v%. To determine if sieving through such a layer would contribute to glomerular selectivity, improved models for hindered transport coefficients are needed for fibrous systems where the fiber spacing is on the same scale as the solute size. by Kristin J.
