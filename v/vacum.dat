In simpler terms, to see if controlled hyperventilation would help extend bouts of exercise. Fourteen subjects volunteered for the study. All fourteen subjects were tested on the treadmill, whereas only ten subjects were tested on the rowing ergometer. The <b>VacuMed,</b> pH meter, heart rate monitor, rowing ergometer and treadmill were all used in collecting data. There was only {{a statistically significant difference}} (p=. 034) of the average pH between the control, experimental 1 and experimental 2 trials when analyzed by Two Way Repeated Measure ANOVA with Replication. The reason for two experimental trials existing was for re-assurance of experimental testing results. However, when a Post-Hoc test was run there were no statistically significant comparisons between the trial groups. This resulted in having to accept the null hypothesis for controlled hyperventilation having an effect on pH during anaerobic exercise. Whereas, the results showed a statistical significance (p<. 05) in comparing CO 2 Exhalation on the treadmill and rowing ergometer.

Secondly, we assume the dark matter particle is meta-stable and decays very lately into the dark energy scalar field.

40|$|In {{this work}} we analyze various {{implications}} {{of the presence of}} large field <b>vacum</b> expectation values (VEVs) along supersymmetric flat directions during the early universe. First, we discuss supersymmetric leptogenesis and the gravitino bound. Supersym-metric thermal leptogenesis with a hierarchical right-handed neutrino mass spectrum normally requires the mass of the lightest right-handed neutrino to be heavier than about 109 GeV. This is in conflict with the upper bound on the reheating tempera-ture which is found by imposing that the gravitinos generated during the reheating stage after inflation do not jeopardize successful nucleosynthesis. We show that a solution to this tension is actually already incorporated in the framework, {{because of the presence of}} flat directions in the supersymmetric scalar potential. Massive right-handed neutrinos are efficiently produced non-thermally and the observed baryon asymmetry can be explained even for a reheating temperature respecting the grav-itino bound if two conditions are satisfied: the initial value of the flat direction mus...|$|E

Light company {{made and the}} refined one (Part 1), after adding caustic soda slightly more than the calculated amount and decicated by <b>vacum</b> sactioning in room temperature, and the following results were obtained. 1) In the absorption band of L. Light company made biliverdin, C=O streching vibration of the carbonyl group (γ C=O) at 5. 82 μ and a broad absorption band ranging over 5. 90 μ to 6. 46 μ. was seen instead of 5. 86 μ to 6. 04 μ. which {{was thought to be}} of the ionized carboxyl group. 2) In the absorption band of the refined biliverdin, no C=O streching vibration of the carbonyl group (γ C=O) at 5. 88 μ., and the absorption band of the ionized carboxyl group was seen at 6. 20 - 6. 40 μ., which was probably due to sodium salt formation. 3) In the refined biliverdin the perfect sodium salt formation was observed following the addition of caustic soda, on the other hand, it was imperfect in the L. Light company made biliverdin, probably due to impurity of the biliverdin itself. Therefore, some corrections would be necesseary for the Shindo's result in his experiment about this study...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to understand the method of packaging and cold storage and characteristic changes that occur in banana blossom and catfish meatballs during storage. This study used Factorial Randomized Design with 2 factor treatments, cold storage (± 0 oC, ± 5 oC, dan ± 10 oC) and packaging method (<b>vacum</b> and non-vacum) with 3 replications. The treatments in this research include T 1 M 1 (vacuum method at ± 0 oC), T 1 M 2 (non-vacuum method at ± 0 oC), T 2 M 1 (vacuum method at ± 5 oC), T 2 M 2 (non-vacuum method at ± 5 oC), T 3 M 1 (vacuum method at ± 10 oC), T 3 M 2 (non-vacuum method at ± 10 oC). The result of analysis showed that vacuum and non-vacuum method at cold storage was not significantly affect the water content, ash content, protein content, lipid content, total microbial and organoleptic assessment during storage of 2 days, 4 days, and 6 days. The best treatment combination was (T 1 M 1) 6 nd day with water content 74, 06 %, ash content 1, 57 %, protein content 12, 73 %, lipid content 4, 46 %, and total microbial 8, 67 x 106 colony/ml. white, slightly slimy appearance, tyis...|$|E
40|$|Effort to use {{new energy}} source was an {{important}} part in energy diversification caused by the reduction of energy stock and increasing of fuel needs. The utilization of physic nut (Jatropha curcas L.) oil as bio-diesel fuel is an alternative to anticipate the increasing fuel needs. Major variety could be found by plant utilization, like mutation and transgenic. One of Mutation technique used in plant chemical mutation using colchicine compound. The research aimed to discuss the difference of vegetative and molecular character from two accession of physic nut (Jatropha curcas. L) plant caused by several colchicine mutagen concentrate treatment. The research was done in Forestry Experiment Lab, Agronomy Lab Faculty of Farming and Molecular Lab, Center of Biotechnology Development University of Muhammadiyah Malang. The research was done from March 2008 to February 2009. Tools used were: seedbox, polybag, sieve, durran bottle, drop pipette, analytic weighing, microscope, plastic gloves, aluminium foil, camera, gloves, scissors, micropipette (1 - 10 µL; 10 - 100 µL; 100 - 1000 µl), tube 1, 5 ml, tip (1 - 10 µl, 10 - 100 µl, 100 - 1000 µl), mortar and hammer, spatulae, tissue, beaker glass, measurement glass, analytic weighing, sentrifuse, vortex, magnetik stirrer, pH meter, microwave, centrifuge, <b>vacum</b> frezer, autoclave, electroforesis tool, UV-transiluminator, Thermocycler (Biometra), timer, PCR and writing tool.
