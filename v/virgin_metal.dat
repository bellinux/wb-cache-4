50|$|Metals were {{an early}} {{priority}} for the International Resource Panel, since little was known about them, their impacts, their economic importance or their scarcity. The report aimed to calculate the amount of metals present in society and assess the potential for utilising in-use stock to offset demand from <b>virgin</b> <b>metal.</b> Knowing how much metal stock there is in use, and how long the lifespan of the metal is, can help planners know when these metal stocks will enter recycling or waste streams. It suggested that these 'mines above ground' had growing potential for future metals supply; the authors found that there is about 50 kg of above-ground copper for every person on earth, and more than two tons of iron per capita. However, they noted that enormous disparities in global metals stocks existed between developed and developing nations including Brazil, China and India.|$|E

40|$|This report {{documents}} {{the development of}} the initial dynamic policy mixes that were developed for assessment in the DYNAMIX project. The policy mixes were designed within three different policy areas: overarching policy, land-use and food, and metals and other materials. The policy areas were selected to address absolute decoupling in general and, specifically, the DYNAMIX targets related to the use of <b>virgin</b> <b>metals,</b> the use of arable land and freshwater, the input of the nutrients nitrogen and phosphorus, and emissions of greenhouse gases. Each policy mix was developed within a separate author team, using a common methodological framework that utilize previous findings in the project. Specific drivers and barriers for resource use and resource efficiency are discussed in each policy area. Specific policy objectives and targets are also discussed before the actual policy mix is presented. Each policy mix includes a set of key instruments, which can be embedded in a wider set of supporting and complementary policy instruments. All key instruments are described in the report through responses to a set of predefined questions. The overarching mix includes a broad variety of key instruments. The land-use policy mix emphasizes five instruments to improve food production through, for example, revisions of already existing policy documents. It also includes three instruments to influence the food consumption and food waste. The policy mix on metals and other materials primarily aims at reducing the use of <b>virgin</b> <b>metals</b> through increased recycling, increased material efficiency and environmentally justified material substitution. To avoid simply shifting of burdens, it includes several instruments of an overarching character...|$|R
40|$|E-waste {{could be}} an {{important}} source of valuable metals if we can design an effective recovery mechanism. This article aims to: enhance the rate of E-waste recycling, treatment and the rate of recycled metal (secondary metal); and reduce the extraction of primary <b>metals</b> (<b>virgin</b> <b>metals)</b> by introducing an E-waste recycling tax, by minimizing CO 2 emissions as a requirement of China’s climate change policy. On this basis, we designed a dynamic environmental-social economic model for the period 2008 - 2020. Upon comprehensive consideration of economic benefits and environmental impacts, the results show that by imposing a 4 % levy on production volume for electronics manufacturing and imposing specific taxes on consumers for recycling E-wastes, the total GDP is maximized and is higher than without introducing any tax.

40|$|The Stainless Steel Beneficial Reuse Program {{began in}} 1994 as a {{demonstration}} funded by the DOE Office of Science and Technology. The purpose {{was to assess the}} practicality of stainless steel radioactive scrap metal (RSM) recycle. Technical feasibility has been demonstrated through the production of a number of products made from recycled RSM. A solid business foundation is yet to be achieved. However, a business environment is beginning to develop as multiple markets and applications for RSM are surfacing around the Complex. The criteria for a successful business reality includes: - affordable programs, - a continuing production base from which to expand, - real products needs, - adequate RSM supply, and - a multi-year program This program currently sponsored by SRS and DOE-ORO to fabricate Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) canisters from RSM provides an activity that satisfies these criteria. The program status is discussed. A comparison of the cost of DWPF canisters fabricated from recycled RSM and <b>virgin</b> <b>metal</b> is presented. The comparison is a function of several factors: disposal costs, the fabrication cost of <b>virgin</b> <b>metal</b> canisters, the fabrication cost of recycled RSM canisters, free release decontamination costs, and the cost to accumulate the RSM.

40|$|Technetium is a {{radioactive}} {{product of the}} nuclear fission process. During reprocessing of spent or partially spent fuel from nuclear reactors, the technetium can be released and contaminate other, otherwise good, metals. A specific example is equipment in gaseous diffusion uranium enrichment cascades which {{have been used to}} process fuel which was returned from reactors, so-called reactor returns. These returns contained volatile technetium compounds which contaminated the metals in the equipment. Present regulations require that technetium be removed before the metal can be re-used at non-radioactive sites. Removing the technetium from contaminated metals has two desirable results. First, the large amount of nonradioactive metal produced by the process herein described can be recycled at a much lower cost than <b>virgin</b> <b>metal</b> can be produced. Second, large amounts of radioactively contaminated metal can be reduced to relatively small amounts of radioactive slag and large amounts of essentially uncontaminated metal.

High dislocation densities {{of the order of}} 1012 /cm 2 are associated with distributed strain fields of intermediate range. These results support the proposition that the dislocation structure is inheritable during the a-ߠphase transition, with the dislocations from the first-formed a phase on basal planes, and the majority created during nucleation and growth of the ߠphase on the prismatic planes, all being retained during subsequent phase transitions.

This first phase of the mint was officially opened on 17 December 1968 by the royal attendance of Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip and their son Prince Charles. Originally there were fears that the Royal family would face protests because of the Investiture of Prince Charles as the Prince of Wales however such protests failed to materialise. The second phase of construction began in 1973 and included the addition of a means to mint coins from <b>virgin</b> <b>metals</b> completing the full minting process. Upon completion the final cost for the land, buildings and plant came to £8 million. [...] Coin minting and production gradually shifted to the new site {{over the next seven years}} until the last coin, a gold sovereign, was struck in London in November 1975. In an attempt to consolidate all previous coin-related acts, the Coinage Act of 1971 was produced which among other things effectively abolishing the individual role of Master of the Mint.

40|$|Li-ion {{batteries}} are now used in electric vehicles (EVs), plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs) and, hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). Nanostructured Li(NiyMnzCo 1 -y-z) O 2 {{is one of}} the more popular cathode chemistries for automotive Li-ion battery, due to its enhanced properties such as large surface area, short diffusion length, enhanced ionic and electronic conductivity, improved mechanical strength and structural integrity [Pan et al, #y 2013]. Recycling of Li-ion batteries helps to mitigate environmental effects of <b>virgin</b> <b>metal</b> extractions along with improper disposal of end of life batteries. To fulfill these objectives of the recycling, recovery of pure streams of the involved metals should be considered. In this study, the batteries were first discharged and dismantled in an inert atmosphere (Ar). The electrodes were then heat treated in a box furnace. This was done in order to break the chains of the adhesive (PVDF) and consequently separate the metallic substrates Cu and Al from the electrochemically active compound. This heat-treatment also helped to simplify the dissolution of the metal constituents in the electrochemically active compound from the cathode in the acid leaching process. Solvent extraction was chosen to achieve separation and recovery of metals with higher purity from these leachates. In the scope of the present work, a complete process from the point of dismantling to separation of constituent metals using solvent extraction was studied...|$|E
40|$|Magnesium {{zirconium}} phosphate, MgZr₄P₆O₂₄ (MZP), is a magnesium ion conducting {{ceramic material}} with potential for application as solid electrolyte in high temperature electrochemical sensor in non-ferrous scrap metal refining and <b>virgin</b> <b>metal</b> alloying operations. In this work, MZP was synthesized using {{a simple but}} novel and economical sol–gel route at a significantly reduced temperature. An insight into the calcination process and possible phase transformation at higher temperature was obtained using simultaneous thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry (TGA/DSC). Phase identification of the synthesized material was studied after calcining the powder at 900 °C for 3 h using X-ray diffraction (XRD); a single monoclinic phase was observed at that temperature. However, a trace amount of possible minor second phase, zirconium oxide phosphate [Zr 2 (PO 4) 2 O], was formed after heating at temperatures T ≥ 1000 °C. Impedance spectroscopy measurements on platinized sintered-MZP pellets were {{carried out in the}} frequency range 100 mHz to 32 MHz and in a temperature range of 30 – 800 °C to determine the electrical properties of MZP. Ionic conductivity of MZP was found to be equal to 7. 23 × 10 – 3 Ω– 1 cm– 1 at relatively lower temperature, 725 °C. Furthermore, the Nyquist and modulus plots measured at 764 and 390 °C show single semicircles suggesting contribution from only grain interiors (GIs). The ion-hopping rate was calculated by fitting the conductance spectra to the power law variation, σac (ω) = σdc + Aωn. The ac and dc conductivity of MZP shows Arrhenius-type of behavior with activation energies in the range 0. 84 ≤ Ea(eV) ≤ 0. 87. SEM of the fractured MZP pellet sintered at 1300 °C for 24 h revealed a highly dense microstructure with clearly visible grain boundaries and low porosity which is in good agreement with the relative density of ∼ 99 % determined using the Archimedes’ principle and the theoretical density calculated from the crystal structure. EDS confirms the presence of Mg, Zr, P, O in appropriate atomic ratio to yield MgZr 4 P 6 O 24. Finally, TEM on MZP particles with crystallite size of ∼ 50 nm also confirmed MZP as stable at 900 °C with no observable second phase, Zr 2 (PO 4) 2 O...|$|E
40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{focussed}} on improving the material yield in closed-die forging and rolling. The former {{is restricted to}} the manufacturing of heavy crown wheels and front axle beams and the latter to the hot rolling of steel slabs. To enhance the yield the commercial FE-codes Form 2 D and Dyna 3 D are used. Results from forging simulations are strengthened by full scale experiments. The research is carried out in near contact with the Swedish steel and engineering industry. In closed die forging, two bulk forming problems are treated: How to improve the tool design and how to change the pre-form geometry for decreasing the amount of material exiting the flash gap? In slab rolling, two problems related to material defects are considered: How to eliminate existing surface cracks and how to prevent the formation of voids around macro-inclusions embedded in the steel matrix? Internal voids might be the reason for scrapping the whole workpiece. Considering the forging of crown wheels, a new concept is proposed. For making the central hole of the product, the traditional method was forging a thin circular plate which was then sheared off and scrapped. Using the new technique this operation is replaced by forging a conical tap in the centre, which is then discarded. Doing so, the inner scrap material decreased with about 15 %. The idea {{has been used in}} production for seven years. – Regarding the forging of front axle beams, a quasi- 3 D method is used comprising full scale measurements of the axial material flow. Here the theoretical material yield increased 2 - 7 %. Regarding rolling, the initial surface cracks in the simulations are V-shaped with a crack angle of 6 o and of depth 5 - 20 mm. The inclusions are cylindrical and either three times harder or three times softer than the matrix. The behaviour of the cracks and the inclusions are studied as influenced by process parameters. Current industrial input data are used as a reference. – It is concluded that longitudinal cracks cannot be totally eliminated. During rolling their V-shape gradually changes to Y-shape and a remaining oxide flake separates the crack bottom surfaces. For minimizing the detrimental influence of the entrapped oxide, an early closure of the crack bottom is important. Throughout the remaining rolling schedule the entrapped oxide is then torn to pieces with large areas of <b>virgin</b> <b>metal</b> in between ensuring a strong bond. The following recommendations are given for the longitudinal cracks: Light drafts/pass {{at the beginning of the}} rolling schedule followed by heavy ones. – Contradictory to longitudinal cracks it is concluded that transversal cracks are possible to eliminate. When eliminated, the initial bottom of the crack coincides with the slab surface. No folds are formed. For the transversal cracks light drafts/pass are proposed together with reversal rolling, the latter for avoiding crack folding. – Voids are easiest formed around hard macro-inclusions in the centre of the slab. Large rolls and heavy drafts are recommended to avoid this. QC 2010072...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{material}} use {{efficiency is}} important to mitigate future supply risks and minimize environmental impacts associated with {{the production of the}} materials. The policy mix presented in this paper aims to contribute to reducing the use of <b>virgin</b> <b>metals</b> in the EU by 80 % by 2050 without significant shifting of burdens to other material resources, environmental impacts, or parts of the world. We used a heuristic framework and a systems perspective for designing the policy mix that combines primary instruments designed to increase material efficiency, recycling and substitution of materials (a materials tax, the extended producer responsibility, technical regulations, and environmental taxes) and supportive instruments aimed to reduce barriers to implementing the primary instruments and to contribute towards the policy objectives (e. g., research and development support, and advanced recycling centers). Furthermore, instruments were designed so as to increase political feasibility: e. g., taxes were gradually increased as part of a green fiscal reform, and border-tax adjustments were introduced to reduce impacts on competitiveness. However, even in such a policy mix design ongoing ex-ante assessments indicate that the policy mix will be politically difficult to implement—and also fall short of achieving the 80 % reduction target. Nonetheless, we suggest combining primary and supportive instruments into coherent and dynamic policy mixes as a promising step towards system reconfigurations for sustainability...|$|R
40|$|Noxious diesel {{emissions}} {{far above}} official limits {{and the need}} to rapidly reduce-greenhouse gases generate widespread calls for banning fossil-fueled cars in Europe. This report shows {{that it is possible to}} electrify 50 per cent of all new cars in the EU by 2030.  This, however, requires massive investment in European battery production capacity, and a long-term commitment to sustainable supply of critical materials. In addition a large-scale expansion of the charging infrastructure is needed, in particular at home and at work places, which account for around 95 per cent of all battery charging. Moreover, local grids will need enforcement in most countries. The additional electricity demand must be satisfied at a time when many coal-fired and nuclear-based power plants will be decommissioned.  Plug-in hybrids, which combine a downsized combustion engine with an electric motor, will probably play an important role, both to relieve long-distance drivers of range anxiety and to reduce the demand for scarce <b>virgin</b> <b>metals,</b> in particular cobalt.  To make the shift happen, an EU-wide Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate needs to be established from 2025, with planned stringency increases every second year or so. Such a regulation is less vulnerable to budget restraints and changing relative prices than financial incentives. At the same time, the regulatory demands on manufacturers to reduce CO 2 emissions from combustions engines need to become more stringent and apply to all combustion engines, including those in plug-in hybrids. Such a combination of policies will make it possible to realize the overall target of 50 per cent electrification of new cars in a robust and flexible way.

40|$|Automobile {{electrification}} {{is one of}} {{the technological}} developments that may establish an eco-friendly transport system by mitigating vehicle emissions, and hopefully lead to a less fossil fuel-dependent society. Conservative forecasts predict four million electric cars on the road by 2015 (Bernhart et al., 2012). A crucial component of electric vehicles is the battery. This component affects two key performance factors, energy storage and usage. This implies that battery performance is the basis for public acceptance of electric vehicles. The lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery chemistries are the most popular battery chemistries to fulfill this requirement (especially for the complete electric vehicles) among manufacturers. The large influx of HEVs and EVs will present unique challenges for the safe disposal and recycling of their batteries at the end of product life. The high energy density, ironically the characteristic that makes the Li-ion batteries ideal for electric drive, is the cause for concern in handling and processing them at their end of life. However, recycling end-of-life batteries for their constituent metals has multifold advantages. If successful, recycling may effectively mitigate environmental effects of mining/ brine extractions for <b>virgin</b> <b>metals</b> and raw material transportation emissions. In addition, it can also balance fluctuating cost dynamics and ensure a steady supply of raw material. Leaching and separation of the metals in the leachates are two of the main steps in a hydrometallurgy process. Mastering these two steps will allow for the possibility to develop a successful process for the recovery of metals e. g., Li, Cu, Al, Ni, and Mn. In this work, characterizing of the electrochemically active material on the electrodes in relation to their chemical composition and physical phases using XRD, SEM coupled with EDX was done. Leaching study showed that the state of battery charge or microstructure did not affect lechability of metals from the electrodes. Preliminary solvent extraction experiments using the extractants (Cyanex 272, Cyanex 923 and HDBM) resulted in successful separation of Li from other metal ions from chloride solutions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} how metals originate in industrial wastewaters from the mining and metal finishing industries. Treatment of wastewaters containing dissolved metals produces a metallic hydroxide sludge {{which has to}} be disposed of in an environmentally acceptable way. It is estimated that the metal finishing industry annually disposes of 2, 500, 000 pounds and 49, 000, 000 pounds of non-ferrous metals in Canada and the United States respectively. These non-ferrous metals are either discharged to municipal sewers as untreated wastewater where they can interfere with the sewage treatment process and can also pose serious problems for sewage sludge disposal, or they can be disposed of as metallic hydroxide sludges in landfills, deepwells, or holding lagoons. The value of the metals contained in these sludges has long been recognized, and technology has been developed for their recovery. This recovery technology is based on well known chemical unit processes such as leaching, selective precipitation, ion exchange, and electrowinning. These processes are capable of recovering metals in a pure form, however, this technology {{does not appear to}} be economical at this time due to high energy costs, high chemical cost, and undue competition of this pure product from <b>virgin</b> <b>metals.</b> The paper describes a process whereby these non-ferrous metals can be recovered via microbial sulphate-reduction as metallic sulphides suitable as basemetal smelter feed. The bacterium Desulfovibrio desulfuricans is capable of reducing sulphate sulphur to sulphide sulphur while simultaneously oxidizing organic carbon to carbon dioxide. The hydrogen sulphide thus produced reacts with metal hydroxide sludge leachate to produce a high grade metallic sulphide concentrate suitable for basemetal smelter feed. The process described utilizes three industrial waste streams, namely: metallic hydroxide sludge, waste sulphuric acid, and biodegradable waste organics, as feedstocks for the reaction. Bench scale experiments are described which produced concentrates containing in excess of 28 per cent copper and zinc as sulphides. The paper includes a flow sheet and process design for a pilot plant recovering 1000 pounds per year of non-ferrous metal as metallic sulphides...|$|R
40|$|Energy and {{material}} flows associated with portable and industrial rechargeable batteries have been quantified in a life-cycle perspective, as guidance {{for development of}} battery systems. The study included portable batteries based on nickel-cadmium, nickel-metal hydride and lithium-ion. Energy return factors and overall energy efficiencies were calculated for a stand-alone photovoltaic (PV) -battery system under different operating conditions. Eight different battery technologies for stationary energy storage were evaluated: lithium-ion (Ni), sodium-sulphur, nickel-cadmium, nickel-metal hydride, lead-acid, polysulphide-bromide, vanadium redox and zinc-bromine. In applications where batteries are difficult to collect {{at the end of}} their life, dissipative losses of toxic metals from incineration and landfills are of main concern. Indicators of global metal flows were used to assess the potential environmental impact of metals used in portable batteries. Lithium-ion and nickel-metal hydride batteries have lower impact based on indicators of anthropogenic and natural metal flows than nickel-cadmium batteries. Energy requirements during production and usage are important for battery systems where the metal losses throughout the battery life cycle are low. For a PV-battery system with a battery capacity three times higher than the daily energy output, the energy return factor is 0. 64 - 12, depending on the battery technology and operating conditions. With a service life of 30 years, the energy payback time is 1. 6 - 3. 0 years for the PV-array and 0. 55 - 43 years for the battery, which highlights the energy related significance of batteries and the large variation between different technologies. Some of the emerging technologies studied, e. g. lithium-ion and sodium-sulphur, show favourable performance for use in PV-battery systems, resulting in higher energy return factors and higher overall battery efficiencies than for established battery technologies. The environmental impact can be reduced by matching operating conditions and battery characteristics in a life-cycle perspective. To decrease the environmental impact of battery systems, the development of battery technologies should aim at the recycling of materials, increased service lives and higher energy densities. To decrease the environmental impact arising from the use of metals in battery systems, metals with high natural occurrence should be used and regulations implemented to decrease the need for <b>virgin</b> <b>metals.</b> To increase the overall energy efficiencies of battery systems, the development of battery technologies should aim at higher charge-discharge efficiencies and more efficient production and transport of batteries...|$|R

40|$|Arsenic is an {{extremely}} poisonous element. It {{has been reported to}} cause contamination of drinking water sources {{in many parts of the}} world. The current drinking water permissible limit for arsenic in the European Union is 10 μg/L. The World Health Organization has a general rule that no substance may have a higher lifetime risk of more than 1 in 100, 000. However, several studies on toxicity of arsenic suggest that purely based on health effects the arsenic limit of 10 μg/L is not sufficient. The main goal of this research was to develop an efficient arsenic removal technology that could be able to produce drinking water with an arsenic concentration of less than 1 μg/L. For this purpose, an innovative three step technique, Advanced Oxidation - Coagulation - Filtration (AOCF), was investigated through bench-scale and pilot scale experiments in the Netherlands at the water treatment plant of Dorst. Firstly, prior to the investigations on AOCF, the existing arsenic removal at the water treatment plant was investigated. Secondly, through a series of bench-scale experiments, the optimum type of coagulant, its combination dose with the selected chemical oxidant and optimum process pH were determined. Eventually, the partially optimized technique from the bench-scale was implemented at the pilot scale physical model of water treatment plant Dorst where AOCF was evaluated for arsenic removal and its effect on the removal of other common undesirable groundwater constituents. The optimized AOCF technology consistently removed arsenic from groundwater to below 1 ug/L when implemented at pilot scale. The overall effluent quality also remained acceptable. The method is efficient with both types of filtration media tested in this research i. e., <b>virgin</b> sand and <b>metal</b> oxide coated sand, however virgin sand media showed slightly better arsenic removal efficiency.
