25|$|The first fibulae design, <b>violin</b> bow fibulae (drahtbugel in German), {{appeared}} in the late Bronze Age. This simple design, with a unilateral spring, looks remarkably like a modern safety pin. The <b>violin</b> bow fibula has a low flat arch; the body runs parallel to the pin so it resembles a <b>violin</b> bow. The bow could be round, square, or flat and ribbon-like in cross-section. Some had simple punched or incised decoration on the bow. <b>Violin</b> bow fibula, such as the Peschiera type and the Unter-Radl type, {{was introduced in the}} 14th century BC (Late Mycenean III era) by the Myceneans on the Greek Peloponnesus. The fibula soon spread to Crete, Cyprus and Mycenean trading posts in Sicily.|$|E
