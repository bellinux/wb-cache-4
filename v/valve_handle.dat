40|$|Abstract [...] Cavitation {{can occur}} in control <b>valves</b> <b>handling</b> fluids, causing loud noise as well as {{damaging}} valve components and ultimately leading to additional costs. When actions for preventing cavitation are considered, {{it is essential to}} recognize the existence of cavitation and location of cavitation inception point. In fluid power components and systems cavitation {{can occur in}} various locations where the access for measuring instruments is limited. Therefore, the existence of cavitation is often very difficult to detect. In this review paper, cavitation phenomenon is explained and effects of cavitation in the control valves are dealt.

5|$|An {{announcement}} was made on July 13, 2006 stating that Episode Two would be released on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 {{in addition to the}} PC, where previous iterations of the series separated. It was originally rumored that Episode Two would be delayed until 2008. On June 14, 2007, however, Valve confirmed the release date for Episode Two to be October 9, 2007 for all announced platforms. <b>Valve</b> <b>handled</b> the development of the game for the PC and Xbox 360, while Electronic Arts British office in Chertsey worked on the PlayStation 3 version of the game. It was announced on September 7, 2007 that the PlayStation 3 version of the game would be delayed because the development studio behind the game was in the United Kingdom, away from Valve's development team, and therefore lagged behind in its schedule. Valve's marketing director, Doug Lombardi, gave assurance that the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC versions of the game would be identical in functionality and performance.|$|R
50|$|During the 6AM to 2PM {{shift at}} the factory, workers were {{required}} to take a routine sample {{from each of the}} LPG storage tanks. A team composed of a plant operator, the shift fireman and a laboratory technician were taking a sample from sphere no.443. The operator, {{due to the fact that}} he had only a single valve spanner, opened the valves in the incorrect order. This caused the release of a small amount of caustic soda and a small amount of gas when he opened the lower valve. This prompted the operator to close the valve and then reopen it, leading to only a few drops emerging. The upper valve was then opened fully. This led to a very powerful jet of propane to rush out. This release splashed up from the drain and gave frost burns to the operator on the face and forearm. As he recoiled from the flow, the operator partly pulled off the <b>valve</b> <b>handle.</b> The fireman, losing sight of the operator, turned on the water supply to the sprays fitted to the sphere and, with the operator, attempted to reposition the <b>valve</b> <b>handle</b> and shut the valve.

50|$|A saddle valve {{is mounted}} {{directly}} on to a pipe {{which is usually}} 1/2 inch copper tubing. Saddle valves are self-tapping devices.

The study shows that the best abrasion wear resistance comparable to Ni-Hart cast iron was obtained in the cast duplex steel, where Ni was partially replaced with Mn and N. This cast steel was also characterized by the highest hardness and matrix microhardness among all the tested cast steel grades. The best resistance to electrochemical corrosion in 3 % NaCl-H 2 O solution showed the cast duplex steel with high content of Cr, Mo and N.

40|$|Abstract — In {{the field}} of competition, all {{companies}} should supply their goods and services with high quality, in shortest period with lower prices than its competitors {{in order to survive}} the competitive environment. A ball valve is a form of quarter-turn valve which uses a hollow, perforated and pivoting ball (called a "floating ball") to control flow through it. It is open when the ball's hole is in line with the flow and closed when it is pivoted 90 -degrees by the <b>valve</b> <b>handle.</b> Reduced flow and excessive pressure drop are some of the common problems in ball valve. Angle backlash in the ball position is one of the causes for reduced flow and excessive pressure drop. This paper discusses on creating various alternatives for eliminating the angle backlash in the ball position, evaluating them and choosing the best alternative followed by CFD analysis of the ball valve before and after adjusting the backlash is made in ANSYS FLUENT and the results are compared.

40|$|In {{lost foam}} casting (LFC), the {{distribution}} of polymer beads during the bead filling process is not uniform, and the collision between polymer beads determines {{the distribution of}} two-phase flow of gas and solid. The interaction between the gas and solid phases reveals as coupling effect of the force that gas exerts on particles or vice versa, or that among particles. The gas-solid flow in filling process is nonlinearity, which makes the coupling effect an essential point {{to carry out a}} simulation properly. Therefore, information of each particle’s motion is important for acquiring the law of filling process. In bead filling process, compressed air is pressed into mold cavity, and discharged from gas vent, creating a pressure difference between outer and inner space near the gas vent. This pressure difference directly changes the spatial distribution and motion trace of gas and solid phases. In this paper, Discrete Element Method (DEM) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) are employed to simulate the fluid dynamic character based on Newton’s Third Law of Motion. The simulation results of some casting products such as pressure plate and <b>valve</b> <b>handle</b> are compared with the result obtained from practical experiment in order to test the feasibility of DEM.
