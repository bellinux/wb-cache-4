40|$|Ecological {{assessments}} such as {{species distribution}} modelling and benchmarking site quality towards regulations often rely on full spatial coverage information of site {{factors such as}} soil acidity, moisture regime or nutrient availability. To determine if remote sensing (RS) is {{a viable alternative to}} traditional data sources of site factor estimates, we analysed the accuracy (using ground truth validation measurements) of traditional and RS sources of pH and mean spring groundwater level (MSL, in m) estimates. Traditional sources were a soil map and hydrological model. RS estimates were obtained using <b>vegetation</b> <b>indicator</b> values (IVs) from a Dutch national system as an intermediate between site factors and spectral response. IVs relate to those site factors that dictate vegetation occurrence, whilst also providing a robust link to canopy spectra. For pH, the soil map and the RS estimate were nearly as accurate. For MSL, the RS estimates were much closer to the observed groundwater levels than the hydrological model, but the error margin of the estimates still exceeded the tolerance range of moisture sensitive vegetation. The relatively high accuracy of the RS estimates was made possible by the availability of local calibration points and large environmental gradients in the study site. In addition, the error composition of the RS estimates could be analysed step-by-step, whereas the traditional sources had to be accepted ‘as-is’. Also considering that RS offers high spatial and temporal resolution at low costs, RS offered advantages over traditional sources. This will likely hold true for any other situation where prerequisites of accurate RS estimates have been met...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} the calibration {{and evaluation of}} an optical-passive microwave method for retrieving soil moisture (SM) at regional scale using remote sensing and reanalysis data. Several data sets were used, such as the bipolarized brightness temperature provided by SM and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) L 3 brightness temperature product, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), the soil temperature and water content of the first 0 - 7 cm of depth from the ERA-Interim reanalysis, and 13 land cover classes obtained from the ECOCLIMAP database. The method was applied over Chile between 28 °S and 43 °S for 2010 - 2012. The data set was used to calibrate and evaluate a semiempirical approach for estimating SM, first by using only the data from SMOS and ERA-Interim and then also including the MODIS <b>vegetation</b> <b>indicator.</b> Results were analyzed for every land cover class using the determination coefficient (r 2), the coefficients obtained from the regressions, and the unbiased rootmean-square difference (ubRMSD). Results showed {{an increase in the}} average r 2 for all classes when a vegetation index was used in the calibration of the approach. The increases in r 2 ranged from 3 % for the crop class, to 49 % for the closed shrubland class. The ubRMSD presented a decrease in its value of up to 1 % m 3 /m 3 for the woodlands, open shrublands, and woody shrublands classes and up to 2 % m 3 /m 3 for the closed shrubland class. These results contribute to the use of single linear and semiempirical regressions to estimate SM at regional scale based on SMOS L-band bipolarized brightness temperature...|$|E
40|$|The spatiotemporal {{distribution}} of soil moisture over the Tibetan Plateau {{is important for}} understanding the regional water cycle and climate change. In this paper, the surface soil moisture in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau is estimated from time-series VV-polarized Sentinel- 1 A observations by coupling the water cloud model (WCM) and the advanced integral equation model (AIEM). The <b>vegetation</b> <b>indicator</b> in the WCM {{is represented by the}} leaf area index (LAI), which is smoothed and interpolated from Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI eight-day products. The AIEM requires accurate roughness parameters, which are parameterized by the effective roughness parameters. The first halves of the Sentinel- 1 A observations from October 2014 to May 2016 are adopted for the model calibration. The calibration results show that the backscattering coefficient (σ°) simulated from the coupled model are consistent with those of the Sentinel- 1 A with integrated Pearson’s correlation coefficients R of 0. 80 and 0. 92 for the ascending and descending data, respectively. The variability of soil moisture is correctly modeled by the coupled model. Based on the calibrated model, the soil moisture is retrieved using a look-up table method. The results show that the trends of the in situ soil moisture are effectively captured by the retrieved soil moisture with an integrated R of 0. 60 and 0. 82 for the ascending and descending data, respectively. The integrated bias, mean absolute error, and root mean square error are 0. 006, 0. 048, and 0. 073 m 3 /m 3 for the ascending data, and are 0. 012, 0. 026, and 0. 055 m 3 /m 3 for the descending data, respectively. Discussions of the effective roughness parameters and uncertainties in the LAI demonstrate the importance of accurate parameterizations of the surface roughness parameters and vegetation for the soil moisture retrieval. These results demonstrate the capability and reliability of Sentinel- 1 A data for estimating the soil moisture over the Tibetan Plateau. It is expected that our results can contribute to developing operational methods for soil moisture retrieval using the Sentinel- 1 A and Sentinel- 1 B satellites...|$|E

Accordingly, this study employs texture information and <b>vegetation</b> <b>indicators</b> as ancillary information for classifying paddy rice through remote sensing images. In the first stage, the images are attained using a remote sensing technique and ancillary information is employed to increase the accuracy of classification. In the second stage, we decide to construct an efficient supervised classifier, {{which is used to}} evaluate the ancillary information. In the third stage, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is introduced. LDA is a well-known method for classifying images to various categories. Also, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is employed to optimize the LDA classification outcomes and increase classification performance. In the fourth stage, we discuss the strategy of selecting different window sizes and analyze particle numbers and iteration numbers with corresponding accuracy. Accordingly, a rational strategy for the combination of ancillary information is introduced. Afterwards, the PSO algorithm improves the accuracy rate from 82. 26 % to 89. 31 %.

40|$|We {{examined}} the potential {{role of the}} soil seed bank in restoration of an open eucalypt forest community following land-use change involving clearing of native eucalypt forest for grazing and subsequent abandonment, and for establishment of Pinus radiata plantation. We used plant functional traits responsive to disturbance and other traits associated with the capacity to re-colonise and form persistent seed banks {{as a means of}} assessing the effects of land-use change on soil seed banks. The soil seed bank and corresponding extant vegetation was surveyed within four replicated paired sites of fragmented native forest and abandoned farmland, and native forest and pine plantation. There was {{a significant difference in the}} composition of the soil seed bank for both land-use changes. Non-metric Multi-dimensional Scaling of plant attributes showed a clear separation of samples according to land-use type and between seed bank and extant vegetation. Cluster analysis of plant functional traits produced eight emergent groups. Phanerophytes were classified as either Ant-dispersed shrubs and herbs, Ericoid heaths or Eucalypts, perennial herbs were either Vertebrate-dispersed species, Barochorous annuals and herbs or Small-seeded hemicryptophytes and the remaining species were Wind-dispersed species or Small-seeded annuals. Small-seeded annuals dominated the soil seed banks and native phanerophytes with low specific leaf area, resprouting, ant-dispersal, large seed, and ericoid mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal associations formed a minor component of the soil seed bank for all land-use types. Sørensen Similarity between the vegetation and soil seed bank was low across all land-use types and was explained by the dominance of annuals in the soil seed bank and perennial species in the extant <b>vegetation.</b> <b>Indicator</b> species analysis revealed an increase in Wind-dispersed species, Barochorous species and Small-seeded annuals in the soil seed bank relative to extant vegetation. Trait associations include a therophyte life form (of predominantly introduced species) with high specific leaf area, small round seed, a seeder fire response, and arbuscular or non-mycorrhizal associations. Underlying axes in trait variation indicate seed banks were dominated by traits associated with the rapid acquisition of resources or the ability to respond rapidly to disturbance that provided for large and persistent stores of introduced ruderal species. In contrast, species excluded from the seed bank shared traits associated with the conservation of resources or ability to withstand environmental stress and were typical of native phanerophytes. These generalisable patterns in plant traits make it unlikely that eucalypt communities can be restored from the native soil seed bank alone...|$|E
40|$|Coastal areas {{across the}} world are {{experiencing}} rapid population growth. One of the main drivers of this growth is the aesthetic value of coastal regions, which is based at least partly on good environmental quality. However, {{in the absence of}} good management, this population growth has the potential to degrade environmental quality. Changes in coastal condition are not only important in terms of environmental impacts, but are also likely to affect {{the quality of life of}} people living in the coastal zone. Information on potential social implications of resource management actions is increasingly required before management decisions are made. However, there are few tools available to assess the impacts of changes in environmental resource condition on people. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate a system dynamics model that can be used to assess the potential impacts of changes in the condition of coastal waterways on human quality of life. The model is based on the Pumicestone catchment in south-east Queensland. It consists of three sub-models; environmental condition, human health, and social wellbeing. The environmental sub-model is very simple, and includes population growth and management actions driving decreases and increases in waterway condition respectively. Waterway condition is made up of water quality, vegetation and biota. The health model is driven by changes in the environmental sub-model. Enterococci concentrations (a water quality indicator) are positively related to the risk of coming down with gastrointestinal illness; bacterial and heavy metal contamination of oysters (biota indicator) leads to increased health risk and the potential closure of oyster aquaculture farms; and increased iron concentrations in the water promote summer blooms of the toxic cyanobacterium Lyngbya majuscula (<b>vegetation</b> <b>indicator),</b> which can cause dermatitis in swimmers. Perceived waterway condition is driven by overall waterway condition (comprising water quality, vegetation and biota) and affects the frequency and duration of recreational visits made to coastal waterways. Recreational visits result in greater amounts of exercise, and also contribute to overall mental and physical health. In terms of social impacts, recreational visits are related to attachment to place and social interaction, which in turn lead to wider social networks and the sense of belonging to the place, significant determinants of quality of life. Place attachment is also related to willingness to contribute to an area and rates of volunteerism, both of which have positive contributions to waterway management. Results from three scenarios show that social and health aspects of wellbeing deteriorate as a result of population growth in the absence of management, but improve if management efforts are sufficient to offset the negative impacts from population growth. However, the positive effects are diminished, and in some cases do not occur within the model timescale, when management efforts are delayed relative to population growth. Dynamic models offer a potentially very useful tool for integrated impact assessment. The integrated quality of life assessment framework described here can be easily generalised to other places and situations, including other types of natural resource management, and offers a potentially valuable tool for natural resource managers...|$|E
40|$|The complex {{topography}} of floodplains provides conditions for high diversity and density of transitional areas between different grassland plant communities. Nevertheless, transitions {{have been almost}} completely neglected in previous studies of diversity patterns in semi-natural floodplain grasslands. We analyzed α-, β- and γ-components of plant species diversity in transitional areas between neighbouring wet and dry grassland communities in two landscapes of the Gauja River floodplain (Latvia) differing in landscape heterogeneity created by land use history and current management type (grazing versus mowing). In total 9 transition areas and their adjacent vegetation were sampled in 1 m wide and 8 to 28 m long belt transects gridded into 0. 5 m × 1 m plots. Cluster {{analysis was used to}} analyze varia-tion in species composition of transitional areas and adjacent <b>vegetation.</b> <b>Indicator</b> species analysis was used to determine species specific to transitional areas (ecotonal species). Transitional areas of the homogeneous site had a more distinct species composition (clear division in clusters by cluster analysis) and significantly lower β-diversity than those of the heterogeneous site. α-Diversity was significantly higher in transitions than in wet grasslands and lower than in dry grasslands in both sites. Comparing the two sites, α-diversity was significantly higher in wet grasslands of the heterogeneous site, but no differences were found between transitions and dry grasslands in the two sites. Higher β-diversity of transitional areas in the heterogeneous site could be attributed to a higher density of different habitats per unit area in combination with grazing. No species were restricted to transitions, and no differences were apparent in the number of generalist species (indifferent species sensu Ellenberg indicator values for edaphic factors) between transitions and adjacent grasslands. Nevertheless, the total number of generalist species was considerably higher in the investigated flood-plain grasslands than usually reported for respective vegetation types in Latvia. It was concluded that transitions of neighboring floodplain grassland plant communities were more important in shaping β-diversity compared to α- and γ-diversity. Our results suggest that destroying transitional areas between dry and wet grasslands by leveling the ground or by abandonment of the management practices will decrease habitat heterogeneity and lead to less pronounced ecotonal pro-cesses in the whole riverine landscape. Thus further studies about the role of fine-scale transitional areas for biodiversity of floodplains are important for ecological restoration of floodplain grasslands. Die vielschichtige Topographie von Flussauen ist Vorrausetzung für eine hohe Diversität und Dichte an Ökotonen und damit auch für zahlreiche Übergänge zwischen verschiedenen Graslandgesellschaften. Ökotone sind ein wichtiges Landschaftselement da sie erheblich zur floristischen Diversität sowohl auf Habitats- wie auch auf Landschaftsebene beitragen. Wir untersuchten den Ökoton zwischen Buckeln/Wällen und Senken im Grasland von Flussauen. Auf den Buckeln/Wällen wuchs trockenes Grasland der Verbände Filipendulo vulgaris-Helictotrichion pratensis (Brachypodietalia, Festuco-Brometea) und Arrhenatherion und in den Senken feuchtes Grasland des Calthion und Magno-caricion. Nach unserem Wissen liegen für solche Ökotone bislang keine Biodiversitätsdaten vor. Das Ziel der Untersuchung war die Einschätzung der Diversität des halbnatürlichen Graslands im Übergangsbereich von trockenen zu feuchten Auenstandorten in Beziehung zur Landschaftsheterogenität. Wir vermuteten, dass sich die Übergangsbereiche durch spezifische Arten sowie eine höhere Beta-Diversität und auch eine höhere Anzahl an Generalisten als die angrenzenden, entweder trockenen oder feuchten Bereiche, auszeichneten.

We provide a statistical assessment of the results for count data, addressing issues of sample size (n), efficiency, power, statistical significance, variability and model selection. Treatment effects were consistent between rare and abundant species. Coefficients of variation averaged 73 % but varied widely. High variability in <b>vegetation</b> <b>indicators</b> was usually offset by large n and treatment effects, whilst invertebrate indicators often had smaller n and lower variability; overall, achieved power was broadly consistent across indicators. Inferences about treatment effects were robust to model misspecification, justifying the statistical model adopted.

40|$|Riparian {{condition}} is commonly measured {{as part of}} stream health monitoring programs as riparian vegetation provides an intricate linkage between the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Field surveys of a riparian zone provide comprehensive riparian attribute data but can be considerably intensive and onerous on resources and workers.

Subsequently, we developed a non-parametric approach to calculate an information retained (IR) statistic for comparing several constrained systematic sampling schemes to the original survey. The IR statistic is used to select a scheme that reduces the time taken to undertake riparian surveys (and thus potentially the costs) whilst maximising the IR from the original survey. Approximate bootstrap confidence intervals were calculated to improve the inferential capability of the IR statistic. The approach is demonstrated using riparian <b>vegetation</b> <b>indicators</b> collected as part of an aquatic ecosystem health monitoring program in Queensland, Australia. Of the nine alternative sampling designs considered, the sampling design that reduced the sampling intensity per site by sixfold without significantly comprising the quality of the IR, results in halving the time taken to complete a riparian survey at a site.

Besides low {{resolution}} sensors as SPOT-VGT and NOAA-AVHRR, medium resolution data from TERRA/AQUA-MODIS or ENVISAT-MERIS are used at pan-European level. In case of available time-series, esp. NOAA AVHRR (since 1981) and SPOT-VGT (since 1998) difference {{values of the}} indicators (e. g. relative or absolute differences) and frequency analysis of the indicators (e. g. position in historical range or distribution) are calculated. The exploitation of the data is performed at full resolution, at grid level of the MCYFS or regional unmixed means (C-indicators) are used. Therefore a database has been set-up {{in order to provide}} the indicators based on a weighted average for each CORINE land cover class within an area of interest. The study aims to develop a strategy for an optimal use of the different sensors and thus derived indicators at different aggregation levels for the ingestion into the MCYFS. As a first step smoothing algorithms have to be applied to the time series to diminish noise effects. Therefore, existing methods as simple sliding windows, piecewise linear regression or fitting of polynomial functions are employed and compared. Thereafter the time-series analysis is performed with the aim to establish relationships between indicators profile features and the crop phenology. JRC. DDG.

40|$|Wetland {{delineation}} {{is commonly}} based on terrain unit, soil form, soil wetness and <b>vegetation</b> <b>indicators.</b> These and the shallow groundwater or proximate surface water are often absent in many ephemeral inland South African areas due to, for instance, prolonged dry periods (seasons to years) which mask these indicators, {{as well as}} disruption of surface materials due to construction, agricultural activities and field fires. Furthermore, many “wetlands” in South Africa comply with the four indicators, but the notable absent requirement for wetlands are missing, namely the shallow groundwater table, {{as many of these}} systems form in hillslope seeps, catenas or from perched water tables. A 200 m long excavation through one such a system is being studied in Midrand (Gauteng, South Africa). The site is underlain by Lanseria Gneiss and is waterlogged after long and intense periods of intense rainfall. Frequent downslope soil profiling, horizonspecific laboratory analyses for grading and Atterberg Limits, X-Ray Diffraction and X-Ray Fluorescensce Spectroscopy data are interpreted together with soil percolation tests to generate a conceptual model of the system. The results are discussed in terms of the need to consider these temporary systems that do not have a shallow groundwater table and that are not in direct contact with surface drainage features as a possible special type of wetlands, notably in arid regions where they play a very important role in biodiversity and should, therefore, be protected.

40|$|Marine pollen {{analysis}} {{is an important}} tool for paleoclimatic reconstruction of regions like the eastern Mediterranean and Near East where few onshore sites provide long pollen records. First, a compilation was made of core-top data from the eastern Mediterranean to Black Seas to map regional variations in modern marine pollen-spore concentrations. These data show a strong link between pollen-spore concentrations and sea surface salinity, with minima of 5 grains/g in the southern Mediterranean and maxima of 160 000 grains/g in the Black Sea. Despite under-representation of some forest and herbaceous <b>vegetation</b> <b>indicators,</b> e. g. Fagus and Pistacia, variations in species composition of the marine assemblages correspond closely with the distribution of regional vegetation zones {{and can be used}} as proxies for spatial differences in seasonal and total temperature and rainfall. Pollen-spore assemblages in five cores from the Marmara Sea with multiple ages ranging from 33 550 to 1990 yr BP and one Holocene core from southeastern Black Sea were used to compile a Late Quaternary marine pollen stratigraphy. These data were then compared with eastern Mediterranean onshore reference sites in order to reconstruct a vegetation and paleoclimate history for the Black Sea^Aegean corridor from the Pleniglacial interval to present. Five marine pollen zones are recognized. PZ- 5 (V 33. 6 ^ 24 ka) corresponds to the late Wu«rm Pleniglacial; PZ- 4 (V 24 ^ 13 ka) spans the Late Glacial Maximum (LGM); PZ- 3 (V 13 ^ 10. 2 ka) includes the Allero«d^Younger Dryas glacial...|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric {{deposition}} of nitrogen {{has become a}} serious concern for nature conservation managers and policy makers. It {{has the potential to}} reduce species richness, increase the graminoid component of the sward, encourage species typical of more fertile conditions and alter the soil biogeochemistry of grasslands. Calcifugous grasslands (grasslands found on acid soils) are among the most sensitive to N deposition due to their poorly buffered soils and species typical of nutrient poor environments. Indicators have an important role to play in detecting the impact of nitrogen deposition on sites of conservation importance and assessing conservation status. This study investigates potential indicators of nitrogen deposition impacts that could be incorporated into site condition monitoring programmes such as the UK Common Standards Monitoring. Using two national surveys of calcifugous grasslands we examined the potential for using: {{the presence or absence of}} indicator species, the cover of indicator species, the species richness and richness of functional groups, and the cover of functional groups as indicators of N deposition impacts. Of all the potential indicators investigated, graminoid:forb ratio was found to be the best indicator of N deposition impacts. It showed a significant relationship to N deposition in both data sets and is quick and easy to assess in the field. <b>Vegetation</b> <b>indicators</b> must be used with caution as there is potential for vegetation management regime and nutrients from other sources to cause similar changes in species composition. Consideration must be given to these before attributing changes to nitrogen deposition...|$|R
40|$|Aridification is an {{important}} component of Late Neogene climate change in south-western Africa probably caused by modifications in the atmospheric circulation in relation to the initiation and intensification of the Benguela Upwelling System due to globally steepening of the meridional pressure gradient. Intensification of the meridional pressure gradient influenced the climate intensively which had then an impact on the vegetation. However, vegetation changes of south-western Africa from the Miocene to Pliocene have not yet been reported and only indirectly investigated by sedimentological data. Here, we present a pollen record of marine ODP Site 1081 retrieved 160 km offshore Namibia covering the time between 9 and 2. 7 Ma. Using an endmember unmixing model we distinguished three vegetation phases: a relative wet phase, during the Tortonian, showing higher representations of Cyperaceae, a transition phase during the Messinian, when especially grasses expanded, and a dry one covering the Pliocene with a strong representation of desert and semi-desert plants. The three phases indicate ongoing aridification probably caused by intensified meridional pressure gradients. Additionally, aquatic <b>vegetation</b> <b>indicators</b> appear in our pollen record from around 5 Ma on, which we attribute to a relocation of the lower course of the Cunene River to its modern outlet in the Atlantic Ocean. Redirection of the Cunene River toward the Atlantic would have deprived the palaeolake Cunene of {{an important}} source of fresh-water ultimately resulting in desiccation of the lake and the formation of the Etosha Pan...|$|R

In this paper, with Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 remote sensing data, we quantitatively estimated vegetation coverage in Henan Province, China. According to the urbanization rate, altitude, slope degree, and slope exposure, we analyzed spatial and temporal variation laws of vegetation coverage under the action of different factors to provide a reference {{for the improvement of}} the ecological environment and the quality assessment of Chinese granary. From 2000 to 2013, the vegetation coverage in Henan Province declined by 30. 49 % and the ecological environment deteriorated. The spatial change of vegetation coverage was evenly distributed in Henan Province. The vegetation coverage was increased in the west, south, and southwest parts of Henan Province and slightly decreased in the central, east, and the eastern part of Taihang Mountain. Vegetation coverage in a city was related to its population urbanization rate. The population urbanization rate was often negatively correlated with the vegetation coverage. According to the results of terrain factors based analysis, the low-altitude areas were in a good vegetation cover condition with the high vegetation coverage grade; the areas with a smaller slope degree had the large vegetation coverage and the coverage decreased with the increase in the slope degree; the coverage showed no significant difference between sunny and shady slopes and was less limited by light, temperature, and humidity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The Marine Strategy Framework Directive {{requires}} the environmental status of European marine waters {{to be assessed}} using biodiversity as 1 out of 11 descriptors, but the complexity of marine biodiversity and its large span across latitudinal and salinity gradients have been {{a challenge to the}} scientific community aiming to produce approaches for integrating information from a broad range of indicators. The Nested Environmental status Assessment Tool (NEAT), developed for the integrated assessment of the status of marine waters, was applied to 10 marine ecosystems to test its applicability and compare biodiversity assessments across the four European regional seas. We evaluate the assessment results as well as the assessment designs of the 10 cases, and how the assessment design, particularly the choices made regarding the area and indicator selection, affected the results. The results show that only 2 out of the 10 case study areas show more than 50 % probability of being in good status in respect of biodiversity. No strong pattern among the ecosystem components across the case study areas could be detected, but marine mammals, birds, and benthic <b>vegetation</b> <b>indicators</b> tended to indicate poor status while zooplankton indicators indicated good status when included into the assessment. The analysis shows that the assessment design, including the selection of indicators, their target values, geographical resolution and habitats to be assessed, has potentially a high impact on the result, and the assessment structure needs to be understood in order to make an informed assessment. Moreover, recommendations are provided for the best practice of using NEAT for marine status assessments...|$|R
40|$|Flooding {{and land}} use changes can be a {{significant}} source of nutrients to wetlands and contribute to ecosystem changes at a community level. We studied changes in vegetation composition and peat properties in a New Zealand wetland incorporated into a flood control scheme. Lack of hydrological records pre-development of the flood control scheme allowed the opportunity to use nutrient and physical indicators developed for restiad vegetation groups, to identify if increased flooding was the primary cause for ecological succession. Vegetation changes along a 2. 3 -km transect were related to hydrological processes, peat characteristics and atmospheric ammonia inputs. Measurements for peat and vegetation composition were taken from 27 sites, whereas hydrological analysis incorporated seven automated water level sites and a historical investigation of 46 years of river flood records. Ammonia deposition was higher on the farmland/wetland fringe (4. 0 kgNha- 1 year- 1) but decreased to background levels (2 - 2. 5 kgNha- 1 year- 1) 500 m into the wetland. Classification and ordination of vegetation data with environmental variables identified six main groups along a gradient from low nutrients and stable water tables (farthest from the river) to high nutrients and a dynamic water table near the river. Invasion over 50 years of the native scrub tree Leptospermum scoparium into restiad bog was linked to enhanced nutrient inputs and physical degradation from flooding, portrayed through levels higher than restiad indicator target ranges. This study shows that target ranges for <b>vegetation</b> <b>indicators</b> {{can be used as a}} tool to identify ecological succession and invasion...|$|R
40|$|Tillage {{can destroy}} or greatly disturb {{indicators}} of hydric soils and hydrophytic vegetation, making delineation of tilled wetlands difficult. The remains of aquatic invertebrates (e. g., shells, drought-resistant eggs, and trichopteran cases) are easily identifiable and persist in wetland substrates even when wetlands are dry. Additionally, these remains {{are not easily}} destroyed by mechanical tillage. To test the feasibility of using invertebrate remains to delineate wetlands, we used two methods to identify the wetland edge of ten seasonal and ten temporary wetlands, evenly divided between grassland and cropland landscapes. First, we identified the wetland edge using hydric soil and <b>vegetation</b> <b>indicators</b> along six evenly spaced transects in each wetland (our ‘‘standard’’ delineation). We then identified the wetland edge along the same transects using aquatic invertebrate remains as our indicator. In grassland landscapes, delineations of the wetland edge made using invertebrate remains were consistently at the same location or closer to the wetland center as the standard delineations for both seasonal and temporary wetlands. In cropland landscapes, however, many of our invertebrate delineations of seasonal and temporary wetlands were on the upland side of our standard delineations. We attribute the differences to movement of remains during tillage, increased maximum pool levels in cropland wetlands, and disturbance of hydric soils and plants. We found that the elevations of the wetland edge indicated by invertebrate remains were more consistent within a wetland than elevations determined by standard delineations. Aquatic invertebrate remains {{can be useful in}} delineating wetlands when other indicators have been destroyed or severely disturbed by tillage...|$|R
