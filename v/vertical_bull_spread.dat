50|$|A jade lizard may {{be created}} in reverse, in which case it {{is known as a}} twisted sister. The {{construction}} of a twisted sister consists of a <b>bull</b> <b>vertical</b> <b>spread</b> created with put options, along with the sale of a call option. For one underlying security, a put option is sold at one strike price, and another put option is bought at a lower strike price, then an OTM call option is sold at a strike price higher than that of both put options. The addition of the sale of a call option is consistent with the expected move of the underlying and results in additional premium collected. Although this strategy appears to be a mirror image of the jade lizard, it is not a perfect one. Its main disadvantage is that the volatility skew, as mentioned above in the Jade Lizard section, works against the trader with naked short calls trading for cheaper premium than naked short puts, and short put spreads trading cheaper than short call spreads. The jade lizard will almost always trade for a higher net credit than the twisted sister consisting of the same strikes.|$|R
50|$|Because of put-call parity, a <b>bull</b> <b>spread</b> can be {{constructed}} using either put options or call options. If constructed using calls, it is a <b>bull</b> call <b>spread.</b> If constructed using puts, it is a <b>bull</b> put <b>spread.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many options {{strategies}} are built around spreads and combinations of spreads. For example, a <b>bull</b> put <b>spread</b> {{is basically a}} <b>bull</b> <b>spread</b> that is also a credit spread while the iron butterfly {{can be broken down}} into a combination of a <b>bull</b> put <b>spread</b> and a bear call spread.|$|R

50|$|Moderately bullish options traders usually set {{a target}} {{price for the}} bull run and utilize <b>bull</b> <b>spreads</b> to reduce cost. (It does not reduce risk because the options can still expire worthless.) While maximum profit is capped for these strategies, they usually cost less to employ for a given nominal amount of exposure. The <b>bull</b> call <b>spread</b> and the <b>bull</b> put <b>spread</b> are common {{examples}} of moderately bullish strategies.|$|R
50|$|In options trading, a <b>bull</b> <b>spread</b> is a bullish, {{vertical}} spread options strategy {{that is designed}} to profit from a moderate rise in the price of the underlying security.|$|R
50|$|If {{a spread}} is {{designed}} to profit from {{a rise in the}} price of the underlying security, it is a <b>bull</b> <b>spread.</b> A bear spread is a spread where favorable outcome is obtained when the price of the underlying security goes down.|$|R
50|$|The {{stock market}} is always moving somewhere or some how. It's up to the stock trader to figure what {{strategy}} fits the markets for that time period. Moderately bullish options traders usually set a target price for the bull run and utilize <b>bull</b> <b>spreads</b> to reduce cost or eliminate risk altogether. There is limited risk when trading options by using the appropriate strategy. While maximum profit is capped {{for some of these}} strategies, they usually cost less to employ for a given nominal amount of exposure. There are options that have unlimited potential to the up or down side with limited risk if done correctly. The <b>bull</b> call <b>spread</b> and the <b>bull</b> put <b>spread</b> are common examples of moderately bullish strategies.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Bull</b> Put Credit <b>Spread</b> (see <b>bull</b> <b>spread)</b> is a bullish {{strategy}} {{and consists of}} selling a put option and purchasing a put option for the same stock or index at differing strike prices for the same expiration. The purchased put option is entered at a strike price lower than the strike price of the sold put option. The return calculation for the Bull-Put Credit Spread position assuming price of the stock or index at expiration {{is greater than the}} sold put is shown below: ...|$|R

40|$|A superreplicating hedging {{strategy}} {{is commonly used}} when delta hedging is infeasible or is too expensive. This article provides an exact analytical solution to the superreplication problem for a class of derivative asset payoffs. The class contains common payoffs that are neither uniformly convex nor concave. A digital option, a <b>bull</b> <b>spread,</b> a bear spread, and some portfolios of <b>bull</b> <b>spreads</b> or bear spreads, are all included as special cases. The problem is approached by first solving for the transition density of a process that has a two-valued volatility. Using this process to model the underlying asset and identifying the two volatility values as σmin and σmax, the value function for any derivative asset in the class is shown to solve the Black-Scholes-Barenblatt equation. The subreplication problem and several related extensions, such as option pricing with transaction costs, calculating superreplicating bounds, and superreplication with multiple risky assets, are also addressed. Superreplication, subreplication, uncertain volatility, Black-Scholes-Barenblatt equation, transaction costs,...|$|R

50|$|For example, {{investors can}} create several {{different}} positions simultaneously {{to compare the}} performance and payoff characteristics between multiple strategies. A textbook may state that writing a covered call is synthetically the same as writing a naked put, but in practice there are subtle differences. With a paper trading account, an investor can set up a <b>bull</b> credit <b>spread</b> and a <b>bull</b> debit <b>spread</b> simultaneously and watch how the payoff for each position changes as the market moves.|$|R

40|$|Corporate {{insiders}} holding derivative contracts {{on their}} firm's stock {{have an incentive}} to engage in stock price manipulation. I examine several derivative contracts susceptible to manipulation and the price impact of the insiders' strategic behavior. Digital contracts, the basic building blocks for valuing complex financial derivatives, are vulnerable to manipulation. The impact of the strategies from holding digital contracts is consistent with an implied volatility skew and volatility clustering. Even seemingly innocuous derivatives, such as ordinary <b>bull</b> <b>spreads,</b> generate these manipulation incentives. This has strong implications for corporate policy, since firms often use option spreads in their stock repurchase programs. ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{position}} is {{so named because}} of {{the shape of the}} profit/loss graph, which loosely resembles a large-bodied bird, such as a condor. In keeping with this analogy, traders often refer to the inner options collectively as the [...] "body" [...] and the outer options as the [...] "wings". The word iron in the name of this position indicates that, like an iron butterfly, this {{position is}} constructed using both calls and puts, by combining a <b>bull</b> put <b>spread</b> with a bear call spread. The combination of these two credit spreads makes the long iron condor (and the long iron butterfly) a credit spread, {{despite the fact that it}} is [...] "long." [...] This distinguishes the position from a plain Condor position (and the plain Butterfly), which would be constructed with all calls or all puts, by combining either a <b>bull</b> call <b>spread</b> with a bear call <b>spread</b> or a <b>bull</b> put <b>spread</b> with a bear put spread. Because the long, plain Condor (and Butterfly) combine a debit spread with a credit spread, that overall position is instead entered at a net debit (though usually small).|$|R

5000|$|In options trading, a {{box spread}} is a {{combination}} of positions that has a certain (i.e. riskless) payoff, considered to be simply [...] "delta neutral interest rate position". For example, a <b>bull</b> <b>spread</b> constructed from calls (e.g. long a 50 call, short a 60 call) combined with a bear spread constructed from puts (e.g. long a 60 put, short a 50 put) has a constant payoff of the difference in exercise prices (e.g. 10) assuming that the underlying stock does not go ex-dividend before the expiration of the options. If the underlying asset has a dividend of x, then the settled value of the box will be 10+x. Under the no-arbitrage assumption, the net premium paid out to acquire this position should be equal to the present value of the payoff.|$|R

50|$|A <b>bull</b> put <b>spread</b> is {{constructed}} by selling higher striking in-the-money put options and buying {{the same number}} of lower striking out-of-the-money put options on the same underlying security with the same expiration date.

5000|$|The iron {{butterfly}} is {{a neutral}} strategy {{and consists of}} a combination of a <b>bull</b> put credit <b>spread</b> and a bear call credit spread (see above). The iron butterfly is a special case of an iron condor (see above) where the strike price for the <b>bull</b> put credit <b>spread</b> and the bear call credit spread are the same. Ideally, the margin for the iron butterfly is the maximum of the bull put and bear call spreads, but some brokers require a cumulative margin for the bull put and the bear call. The maximum return generated for the iron butterfly is when the stock price is the same as when the position was entered.

50|$|With {{four minutes}} {{remaining}} Sharks lock Johann Muller won a lineout 25 metres from the Bulls' line. The Sharks then mauled for before it maul collapsed three metres from the Bulls line. After four phases of driving play Van den Berg drove past Danie Rossouw and Derick Kuün {{to score a}} try for the Sharks. Steyn then missed the conversion; the Sharks now led 19-13. The Bulls then needed to score a converted try to win the match, and {{with only a few}} minutes remaining of regular time they started attacking expansively. In the 79th minute Gary Botha grubber kicked the ball from inside Bulls territory to within the Sharks 22-metre line. François Steyn collected the ball but did not kick out, and instead kicked down field where the ball was collected by Bulls' captain Victor Matfield. The <b>Bulls</b> <b>spread</b> the ball, and went through several phases until it reached winger Bryan Habana near the right touchline. Habana jinked back infield and ran through a gap in the Sharks' defence before scoring a try five metres to right of the goal-posts. The 83rd minute try was then converted by Hougaard to give the Bulls' a 20-19 victory.|$|R
