In this paper a Micro-strip low pass filter with Dumbbell Shaped Slot Defected Ground Structure (DGS) is designed. The response of the filter is analyzed with respect to <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> <b>dimension</b> of the DGS unit. The variation of dimensions of defects studied with their corresponding change in capacitance, inductance as well as frequency response. The defects dimensions are modeled with respect to frequency using the artificial neural network. Optimizing the convergence of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifiers is an important task to increase the speed and accuracy in the decision-making. The frequency response of the micro strip filter is modeled with respect to the <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> <b>dimension</b> of DGS using CST microwave studio. The dimensions are further optimized in order to achieve minimum error in frequency response. Incremental and online back propagation learning approach is followed in the training of neural network because of its learning mechanism based upon the calculated error and its ability to keep track of previous learning iteratively. The simulation results are compared with the results obtained through ANN and the designs are further optimized...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} role of internal customers {{in the delivery of}} external service quality. It will consider any potentially different internal customer types that may exist within the organisation. Additionally, it will explore any potential differences in the dimensions that are used to measure service quality internally and externally. If there are different internal customer types then there may be different dimensions which are used to measure service quality between these types and this will be considered also. The approach adopted given the depth and breadth of understanding required, was an action research case based approach. The research objectives were:(i) To determine the dimensions of internal service quality between internal customer supplier cells. (ii) To determine what variation, if any, there is in the dimension sets between internal customer supplier cells. (iii) To determine any ranking in the dimensions that could exist by internal customer supplier cell type. (iv) To investigate the impact of internal service quality on external service quality over time. The research findings were: (i) The majority of the dimensions used in measuring external service quality were also used internally. There were additions of new dimensions however and some dimensions which were used externally, for internal use, had to be redefined. (ii) <b>Variation</b> <b>in</b> <b>dimension</b> sets were revealed during the research. Four different dimension sets were identified and these were matched with four different types of internal service interaction. (iii) Differences in the ranking of dimensions within each dimension set for each internal customer supplier cell type were confirmed. (iv) Internal service quality was seen to influence external service quality but at a cellular level rather than company level. At the company level, the average internal service quality at the start and finish of the research showed no improvement but external service quality had improved. Further investigation at the cellular level showed that improvements in internal service quality had occurred. Those improvements were found to be with the cells that were closest to the customer. The research implications were found to be: (i) some cells may not be necessary in the delivery of external service quality. (ii) The immediacy of the cell to the external customer and number of interactions into and out of that cell has the greatest effect on external customer satisfaction. (iii) Internal service quality may be driven by the customer affecting those cells at {{the front end of the}} business first. This then cascades back to those cells which are less immediate until ultimately the whole organisation shows improvements in internal service quality...|$|E

40|$|The {{extent to}} which the genetic risk for alcohol {{dependence}} (AD) and conduct disorder (CD) and their common genetic risk overlap with genetic factors contributing to <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> <b>dimensions</b> of personality was examined in a study of 6, 453 individuals from 3, 383 adult male and female same-sex and unlike-sex twin pairs from the Australian Twin Registry. The associations between the personality dimensions of positive emotionality, negative emotionality, and AD and CD risk were modest, whereas the associations between behavioral undercontrol and AD and CD risk were substantially higher. Genetic influences contributing to <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> behavioral undercontrol accounted for about 40 % of the genetic <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> AD and CD risk and about 90 % of the common genetic risk for AD and CD.
