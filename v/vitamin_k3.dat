40|$|The tumor growth-inhibiting and chemo-potentiating {{effects of}} <b>vitamin</b> C and <b>K(3)</b> {{combinations}} {{have been demonstrated}} both in vitro and in vivo. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the influence of orally administered <b>vitamin</b> C and <b>K(3)</b> on the metastasis of mouse liver tumor (T. L. T.) cells implanted in C 3 H mice. Adult male C 3 H mice were given water containing vitamin C and K 3 (15 g/ 0. 15 g dissolved in 1000 ml) beginning 2 weeks before tumor transplantation until the end of the experiment. T. L. T. cells (106) were implanted intramuscularly in the right thigh of mice. All mice were sacrificed 42 days after tumor transplantation. Primary tumor, lungs, lymph nodes and other organs or tissues suspected of harboring metastases were macroscopically examined. Samples of primary tumors, their local lymph nodes, lungs and main organs such as liver, kidneys, spleen were taken for histological examination. Forty-two percent of control mice exhibited lung metastases and 27 % possessed metastases in local lymph nodes whereas 24 % of vitamin-treated mice exhibited lung metastases and 10 % possessed local lymph nodes metastases. The total number of lung metastases was 19 in control group and 10 in <b>vitamin</b> C and <b>K(3)</b> -treated mice. Histopathological examination of the metastatic tumors from the vitamin-treated mice revealed the presence of many tumor cells undergoing autoschizic cell death. These results demonstrate that oral <b>vitamin</b> C and <b>K(3)</b> significantly inhibited the metastases of T. L. T. tumors in C 3 H mice. At least a portion of this inhibition was due to tumor cell death by autoschizis...|$|R
40|$|The {{decision}} of stressed cells to die or to survive {{is made by}} integrating signals at different levels through multiple check points. However, initiation and continued progression toward cell death by apoptosis in cancer cells may be blocked by mutation of the tumor suppressor p 53 or overexpression {{of members of the}} bcl- 2 family of proteins. The existence of such mechanisms indicates that cancer cells lose the controls regulating their cell cycle. Therefore, the activation of their programmed cell death appears as a major therapeutic target. Oxidative stress can stimulate growth, trigger apoptosis, or cause necrosis depending upon the dose and the exposure time of the oxidizing agent. A large body of evidence supports the idea that oxidative stress induced by redox cycling of <b>vitamins</b> C and <b>K(3)</b> in association surpasses cancer cellular defense systems and results in cell death. The molecular mechanisms underlying such a process are, however, still unknown. Indeed, several types of cell death may be produced, namely autoschizis, apoptosis and necrosis. Combined <b>vitamin</b> C and <b>K(3)</b> administration in vitro and in vivo produced tumor growth inhibition and increased the life-span of tumor-bearing mice. CK(3) -treatment selectively potentiated tumor chemotherapy, produced sensitization of tumors resistant to some drugs, potentiated cancer radiotherapy and caused inhibition of the development of cancer metastases without inducing toxicity in the host. We propose the association of <b>vitamins</b> C and <b>K(3)</b> as an adjuvant cancer therapy which may be introduced into human cancer therapy without any change in the classical anticancer protocols, and without any supplementary risk for patients...|$|R
40|$|Human {{prostate}} cancer cells (DU 145) implanted into nude mice are deficient in DNase activity. After administration of a <b>vitamin</b> C/vitamin <b>K(3)</b> combination, both alkaline DNase (DNase I) and acid DNase (DNase II) activities were detected in cryosections with a histochemical lead nitrate technique. Alkaline DNase activity appeared 1 hr after vitamin administration, decreased slightly until 2 hr, and disappeared by 8 hr after treatment. Acid DNase activity appeared 2 hr after vitamin administration, reached its highest levels between 4 and 8 hr, and maintained its activity 24 hr after treatment. Methyl green staining indicated that DNase expression {{was accompanied by}} a decrease in DNA content of the tumor cells. Microscopic examination of 1 -microm sections of the tumors indicated that DNase reactivation and the subsequent degradation of DNA induced multiple forms of tumor cell death, including apoptosis and necrosis. The primary form of vitamin-induced tumor cell death was autoschizis, which is characterized by membrane damage and the progressive loss of cytoplasm through a series of self-excisions. These self-excisions typically continue until the perikaryon consists of an apparently intact nucleus surrounded by a thin rim of cytoplasm that contains damaged organelles...|$|R

50|$|The enzyme is also {{involved}} in biosynthetic processes such as the vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylation of glutamate residues in prothrombin synthesis. NQO1 catalyzes the reduction of vitamin K1,K2 and K3 into their hydroquinone form, but it only has a high affinity for <b>Vitamin</b> <b>K3.</b> Vitamin K hydroquinone serves as a cofactor for vitamin K γ‐carboxylase that catalyzes γ‐carboxylation of specific glutamic acid residues in Gla‐factors/proteins (Gla domain) leading to their activation and participation in blood clotting and bone metabolism. Vitamin K is used as radiation sensitizer or in mixtures with other chemotherapeutic drugs to treat several types of cancer. ROS generated in redox cycling contributes to anticancer activity of vitamin K. NQO1 competes with enzymes that redox cycle vitamin K to formation of semiquinone and ROS. NQO1is therefore able to detoxify <b>vitamin</b> <b>K3</b> and protect cells against oxidative stress.|$|E

50|$|Up-to-date two non-synonymous {{polymorphism}}s on CBR1 {{have been}} identified. The CBR1 V88I polymorphism encodes for a valine-to-isoleucin substitution at position 88 of the aminoacid chain.

40|$|Cancer cells show an up-regulation of glycolysis, they readily take up vitamin C, {{and they}} appear more {{susceptible}} to an oxidative stress than the surrounding normal cells. Here we compare, analyse and discuss these particular hallmarks by performing experiments in murine hepatomas (TLT cells) and freshly isolated mouse hepatocytes. The results show that rates of lactate formation are higher in TLT cells as compared to mouse hepatocytes, but their ATP content represents less than 25 % of that in normal cells. The uptake of vitamin C is more important in hepatoma cells as compared to normal hepatocytes. This uptake mainly occurs through GLUT 1 transporters. Hepatoma cells have less than 10 % of antioxidant enzyme activities as compared to normal hepatocytes. This decrease includes not only the major antioxidant enzymes, namely catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, but also the GSH content. Moreover, catalase is almost not expressed in hepatoma cells as shown by western blot analysis. We explored therefore a selective exposure of cancer cells to an oxidative stress induced by pro-oxidant mixtures containing pharmacological doses of vitamin C and a redox active compound such as menadione (<b>vitamin</b> <b>K(3)).</b> Indeed, the combination of vitamin C (which accumulates in hepatoma cells) and a quinone undergoing a redox cycling (<b>vitamin</b> <b>K(3))</b> leads to an oxidative stress that kills cancer cells in a selective manner. This differential sensitivity between cancer cells and normal cells may have important clinical applications, {{as it has been}} observed with other pro-oxidants like Arsenic trioxide, isothiocyanates, Adaphostin. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|An in situ {{photochemical}} fluorescence probe {{method for}} {{the determination of}} nucleic acids with <b>vitamin</b> <b>k(3)</b> (VK 3) as the photochemical fluorescence probe was developed for the first time. It {{was based on the}} conversion of VK 3 into an intensively fluorescent product on irradiating with UV radiation. The photochemical reaction is decelerated by nucleic acids. The determination can be carried out by measuring the fluorescence intensity at a fixed time. The calibration graph was linear in the range of 0 - 1. 5 mu g/ml for CT DNA, and 0 - 2. 0 mu g/ml for yeast RNA the limit of detection was 10 ng/ml for CT DNA and 26 ng/ml for yeast RNA. The kinetic behaviour of the photochemical reaction and the effects of some experimental conditions were investigated and discussed in detail. CT DNA could be determined in the presence of 40 %(w/w) yeast RNA and yeast RNA was determined when the content of CT DNA in synthetic samples was below 6 %(w/w) ...|$|E
40|$|Deficiency of {{alkaline}} {{and acid}} DNase is a hallmark in all non-necrotic cancer cells in animals and humans. These enzymes are reactivated at {{early stages of}} cancer cell death by vitamin C (acid DNase) and <b>vitamin</b> <b>K(3)</b> (alkaline DNase). Moreover, the coadministration of these vitamins (in a ratio of 100 : 1, for C and K(3), respectively) produced selective cancer cell death. Detailed morphological studies indicated that cell death is produced mainly by autoschizis, {{a new type of}} cancer cell death. Several mechanisms are involved in such a cell death induced by CK(3), they included: formation of H(2) O(2) during vitamins redox cycling, oxidative stress, DNA fragmentation, no caspase- 3 activation, and cell membrane injury with progressive loss of organelle-free cytoplasm. Changes in the phosphorylation level of some critical proteins leading to inactivation of NF-kappaB appear as main intracellular signal transduction pathways. The increase knowledge in the mechanisms underlying cancer cells death by CK(3) may ameliorate the techniques of their in vivo administration. The aim is to prepare the introduction of the association of vitamins C and K(3) into human clinics as a new, non-toxic adjuvant cancer therapy. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{capability}} of cyanobacteria to convert carbon dioxide into carbohydrates offers a promising carbon-neutral energy solution. Unfortunately, the lifespan of cyanobacteria based photoelectrochemical cells is poor because discharge current drops to zero within days. The primary factor that limits lifespan {{was believed to}} be the toxicity of an artificial mediator that extracts electrons from cyanoacteria to electrode. It is critical to experimentally identify the true limiting factor such that we could prolong the lifespan for practical use. RESULTS: Systematic tests on cell physiology and current discharge were performed in autotrophic and heterotrophic conditions. Contrary to previous belief, results for cell viability, chlorophyll content and growth curve of Cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6714 under continuous <b>vitamin</b> <b>K(3)</b> -mediated current discharge did not exhibit any toxic effect. The role of glucose was then investigated. Surprisingly, discharge current dropped to zero although there was significant intracellular glycogen (2. 5 x 10 (- 10) mg cell(- 1)). Further tests of current response to the addition of exogenous glucose suggest the regulatory role of glucose on cyanobacterial metabolism that is relevant to current generation. Furthermore, current generation in the light and dark conditions corroborates glucose as energy reserve. CONCLUSION: It is not mediator toxicity but the regulatory effect of glucose on the metabolism of cyanobacteria that limits the lifespan for current generation. Glucose functions in a dual role as energy reserve and regulatory molecule to modulate cyanobacterial metabolism related to current generation. (C) 2010 Society of Chemical Industr...|$|E
40|$|Among {{different}} {{features of}} cancer cells, {{two of them}} have retained our interest: their nearly universal glycolytic phenotype and their sensitivity towards an oxidative stress. Therefore, we took advantage of these features to develop an experimental approach by selectively exposing cancer cells to an oxidant insult induced by the combination of menadione (<b>vitamin</b> <b>K(3))</b> and ascorbate (vitamin C). Ascorbate enhances the menadione redox cycling, increases the formation of reactive oxygen species and kills K 562 cells as shown by more than 65 % of LDH leakage after 24 hr of incubation. Since both lactate formation and ATP content are depressed by about 80 % following ascorbate/menadione exposure, we suggest that the major intracellular event involved in such a cytotoxicity {{is related to the}} impairment of glycolysis. Indeed, NAD(+) is rapidly and severely depleted, a fact most probably related to a strong Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activation, as shown by the high amount of poly-ADP-ribosylated proteins. The addition of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) restores most of the ATP content and the production of lactate as well. The PARP inhibitor dihydroxyisoquinoline (DiQ) was able to partially restore both parameters as well as cell death induced by ascorbate/menadione. These results suggest that the PARP activation induced by the oxidative stress is a major but not the only intracellular event involved in cell death by ascorbate/menadione. Due to the high energetic dependence of cancer cells on glycolysis, the impairment of such an essential pathway may explain the effectiveness of this combination to kill cancer cells. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|It is {{uncertain}} at which {{stage of the}} germinaton process the chemical reagents exert its inhibitory effect. In this paper an attempt is made to decide the inhibitory effect of disinfectants, food preservatives and antibiotics on the germination process of Bacillus subtilis spores. The technique employed as criteria of germination was based on changes in optical density of spore suspension. The experiments yielded the following results: 1. Spores of B. subtilis germinated rapidly in 0. 1 % glucose, yeast extract medium (medium F) as listed in Table 1. The curves of optical density-change in germination process were shown in Figure 1. A typical curve of optical density-change shown in Figure 2 may indicate the three steps a, b and c as described by Schmidt 3). 2. Inhibitory effect of some chemical reagents on the spore germination was investigated by using a curve of optical density-change. a. Phenol and mercuric chloride inhibited germination in step a, but in the concentration of less than 0. 01 % of mercuric chloride, germination was inhibited in step b (Figure 3). Nitrofurazone {{had no effect on}} spore germination but inhibited it effectively in step b or in step c (Figure 4). <b>Vitamin</b> <b>K₃</b> seems inhibitory in step a. Sorbic acid, dehydroacetic acid, boric acid and their sodium salts did not retard the rate of germination, but in acidic side at pH 5. 5, it took a little lag time for sorbic acid to inhibit germination in step a. Chlortetracycline and dihydrostreptomycin inhibited the outgrowth only, that is, step b or c. The results above mentioned are summarized in Table 3. b. Enzyme inhibitors as listed in Table 4 have less effect upon spore germination. Oxine, cuperon and α. α'-dipyridil seem to have inhibitory action at an intermediate stage of spore germination...|$|E
