50|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, many {{users in the}} {{computer}} industry realized that an affordable <b>video</b> <b>data</b> entry <b>terminal</b> could supplant the ubiquitous punched cards and permit new uses for computers that would be more interactive. The problem was that the amount of memory needed to store the information on a page of text was comparable to the memory in low end minicomputers then in use. Displaying the information at video speeds was also a challenge and the necessary control logic took up a rack worth of pre-integrated circuit electronics. One company announced plans to build a video terminal for $15,000 and attracted a large backlog of orders, but folded when their engineering plans, which included fabricating their own ICs, proved too ambitious. Another approach involved the use of the storage tube, a specialized CRT developed by Tektronix that retained information written on it without the need to refresh.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- Data mining {{technique}} can {{be applied}} in various documents. In this paper concentration on the application of <b>video</b> <b>data,</b> called <b>video</b> <b>data</b> mining, because acquisition and storage of <b>video</b> <b>data</b> is an easy task but retrieval of information from <b>video</b> <b>data</b> is challenging task. So <b>video</b> <b>data</b> mining {{plays an important role}} in efficient <b>video</b> <b>data</b> management for information retrieval. This paper describes a proposed framework for <b>video</b> <b>data</b> mining to extract the information from <b>video</b> <b>data.</b> This includes developing the technique for shot detection then key frame analysis is considered to compare the frames of each shot to each others to define the relationship between shots. After all hierarchical clustering technique is adopted to make a group of similar shots to detect the particular event on some requirement as per user demand.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{efficient}} <b>video</b> <b>data</b> model that extends the DISIMA image data model {{by adding the}} video components and setting up links between image and <b>video</b> <b>data.</b> Many <b>video</b> <b>data</b> models have been proposed, most of which describe <b>video</b> <b>data</b> independently of image data and therefore fail to consider the relationship between videos and images. Our proposed model expresses the semantics of <b>video</b> <b>data</b> content by means of salient objects and relationships among them. Connections between <b>video</b> <b>data</b> and DISIMA images are made through key frames, which are extracted from each shot. Based on these connections, techniques used to query image data {{may be used to}} query <b>video</b> <b>data.</b> In addition, a set of new predicates has been defined to describe the spatio-temporal characteristics of salient objects in the <b>video</b> <b>data.</b> MOQL is used as a query language, with which we present example queries that can be posed on the proposed <b>video</b> <b>data</b> model [...] ...|$|R

30|$|Efficient {{compression}} of <b>video</b> <b>data</b> {{is essential for}} storage and communication, since the amount of <b>video</b> <b>data</b> is very large. Video coding standards, such as MPEG or H. 264, {{have been widely used}} to compress <b>video</b> <b>data.</b> The temporal and spatial correlations of <b>video</b> <b>data</b> are used by adopting the motion compensated prediction and discrete cosine transform (DCT) in the encoder of conventional video coding systems. The conventional video encoder is more complex than the decoder is, since motion compensated prediction requires many operations. This conventional video coding system is appropriate for systems, in which <b>video</b> <b>data</b> is encoded by one complex encoder and decoded by many simple decoders.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in computing, communication, and data storage {{have led to}} {{an increasing number of}} large digital libraries publicly available on the Internet.

Instead of words, a video retrieval system deals with collections of video records. Therefore, the system is confronted with the problem of video understanding.
