40|$|Background: Human Bocavirus (HBoV) {{infection}} is of worldwide distribution. There is increasing evidence that HBoV is pathogenic {{for the human}} gastroenteric tract. However, less data {{are available on the}} role of HBoV in gastroenteritis. The present study was aimed to determine the prevalence of HBoV in children with gastroen-teritis. Methods: Real-time PCR TaqMan was used to screen 200 stool specimens that had been referred to the virol-ogy laboratory for HBoV evaluation. All of samples were collected on <b>viral</b> <b>transport</b> <b>media.</b> Results: Of the 200 stool samples analyzed, 16 (8 %) were positive for HBoV. Human Bocavirus positive sam-ples from patients aged between 1 to 5 years with acute gastroenteritis infection suggest a minor role of HBoV in gastroenteritis (p= 0. 0001).

40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of viral infections by culture {{relies on the}} collection of proper specimens, proper care to protect the virus in the specimens from environmental damage, and use of an adequate transport system to maintain virus activity. Collection of specimens with swabs that are toxic to either virus or cell culture should be avoided. A variety of transport media have been formulated, beginning with early bacteriological transport media. Certain swab-tube combinations have proven to be both effective and convenient. Of the liquid transport media, sucrose-based and broth-based media appear to be the most widely accepted and used. Studies on virus stability show that most viruses tested are sufficiently stable in transport media to withstand a transport time of 1 to 3 days. Some viruses may withstand longer transport times. In many cases, {{it is not necessary to}} store virus specimens in a refrigerator or send them to the laboratory on wet ice or frozen on dry ice.

A subset of 15 of these subjects were studied daily until symptom resolution during a single episode of recurrent HSV. Direct-site specimens were collected and either placed in <b>viral</b> <b>transport</b> <b>media</b> (for Ortho ELISA and fresh inoculation into primary rabbit kidney cells) or frozen in ELISA collection media (DuPont). One hundred eighty-six culture-ELISA comparisons were analyzed. On the basis of culture positivity, the DuPont and Ortho ELISAs differed substantially with regard to sensitivity (93 versus 35 %) but had similar specificities (95 versus 100 %) and positive (85 versus 100 %) and negative (98 versus 85 %) predictive values. There were seven DuPont ELISA-positive, culture-negative samples which were confirmed positive for HSV by blocking antibody test (revised specificity, 100 %; positive predictive value, 100 %). Six of these discrepant samples were from previously culture-positive subjects. These results demonstrate that currently available ELISA kits vary substantially as to their sensitivities in detecting HSV antigen from direct-site specimens.

The most common viruses in {{conjunctivitis}} infection include Herpes simplex virus, Adeno virus and Entrovirus. It has been estimated that HSV 1 causes 60 - 90 % conjunctival infectionsin adults. Recurrent infection by HSV 1 results in Herpes keratitis that is the most common cause for blindness in developing countries. Therefore, a prompt laboratory diagnosis is often very useful. Theaim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of conjunctivitis infection by HSV- 1 Hospital affiliated to Iran University of Medical Sciences (IUMS) in 2009. Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study was doneon 100 tear film and eye swabs specimens from patient with symptoms of viral conjunctivitis. All samples werecollected in <b>viral</b> <b>transport</b> <b>media</b> (VTM) and inoculated in Vero cell line. Viral cytopatic effect was compared with control sample.

40|$|Standard {{recommended}} {{guidelines for}} diagnosis of infectious keratitis do exist. Based on an extensive Medline literature search, the various investigative modalities available for aiding {{the diagnosis of}} microbial keratitis have been reviewed and described briefly. Preferred practice patterns have been outlined {{and the importance of}} routine pre-treatment cultures in the primary management of infectious keratitis has been highlighted. Corneal scraping, tear samples and corneal biopsy are few of the specimens needed to carry out the investigative procedures for diagnosis and for initiating therapy in cases of microbial keratitis. In bacterial, fungal and amoebic keratitis, microscopic examination of smears is essential for rapid diagnosis. Potassium hydroxide (KOH) wet mount, Gram&#x 2032;s stain and Giemsa stain are widely used and are important for clinicians to start empirical therapy before microbial culture results are available. The usefulness of performing corneal cultures in all cases of suspected infectious keratitis has been well established. In cases of suspected viral keratitis, therapy can be initiated on clinical judgment alone. If a viral culture is needed, scrapings should directly be inoculated into the <b>viral</b> <b>transport</b> <b>media.</b> In vivo confocal microscopy is a useful adjunct to slit lamp bio-microscopy for supplementing diagnosis in most cases and establishing early diagnosis in many cases of non-responding fungal and amoebic keratitis.

40|$|This {{project was}} {{designed}} to develop a method for the collection of environmental samples during prolonged Norovirus (NoV) outbreak investigations, and to develop real-time RT-PCR assays to analyze environmental samples for GI and GII noroviruses. The collection and processing of environmental samples could provide epidemiological data to facilitate investigations of prolonged NoV outbreaks and could guide public health NoV intervention strategies. Real-time RT-PCR assays {{for the detection of}} GI and GII NoVs were developed by adapting the State Hygienic Laboratory clinical GI and GII assays to the AB 7500 Fast platform. Analysis of the GI assay performance yielded a dilution curve slope = 3. 28, R 2 = 0. 999 and a calculated amplification efficiency of 102 %. The GII assay yielded a dilution curve slope = 3. 39, R 2 = 0. 999 and a calculated amplification efficiency of 97 %. Amplification efficiencies determine the sensitivity and the limit of detection of real-time RT-PCR assays. Optimum efficiencies range from 95 %- 105 %, with a 100 % efficiency indicating exponential amplification of targeted nucleic acid. To develop a method for the collection of environmental samples, multiple swab types were tested to determine their ability to recover NoV from laboratory spiked environmental surfaces.

40|$|Background: Influenza virus {{infections are}} {{responsible}} for significant morbidity and mortality in both pediatric and adult populations worldwide. Rapid and accurate diagnosis of influenza is necessary for appropriate patient management during the influenza season and for optimal utilization of anti-influenza therapy. We prospectively tested the accuracy of a simple and rapid diagnostic method. Methods: Ninety-eight samples (nasal and pharyngeal swabs) from patients with upper respiratory tract infection symptoms who presented to primary healthcare centres in Barcelona (Spain) were prospectively analyzed. The samples were collected as part of influenza surveillance program. Samples that had enough volume to make the new test after aliquoting the amount needed to perform routine tests were included. None of the samples were pre-selected {{as a result of}} their status in relation to influenza virus. Samples were analyzed by in-house real-time PCR and AlereTM i Influenza A & B (AlereTM i), which uses isothermal amplification of nucleic acids for the qualitative detection of influenza A and B in nasal swabs transported in <b>viral</b> <b>transport</b> <b>media.</b> The two techniques were compared by positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA). Statistical analysis was performed with Stata. Results: Of the 98 samples analysed 90 were concordant; 46 (46. 9 %) were positive and 44 (44. 9 %) were negative. Five samples showed invalid results with the AlereTM i test and could be not re-tested due to insufficient sample volume and were not included in the final statistical analysis. In the 93 remaining samples, the AlereTM i test showed 97 % of accuracy having correctly classified 90 samples. We obtained discordant results in 3 samples (3 %). The PPA was 93. 8 % for influenza A and 94. 1 % for influenza B, and NPA was 100 % for influenza A and influenza B virus. In addition, the AlereTM i was very rapid (15 minutes or less) and extremely easy to use. Conclusions: The AlereTM i test provided a good correlation compared to the real-time PCR test for the diagnosis of influenza. Since this method can be performed in minutes, it allows immediate, accurate clinical decisions to prescribe appropriate antiviral treatment or isolation of patients.
