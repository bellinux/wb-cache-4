25|$|CFLs {{typically}} have a rated service life of 6,000–15,000 hours, whereas standard incandescent lamps have a service life of 750 or 1,000 hours. However, the actual lifetime of any lamp depends on many factors, including operating voltage, manufacturing defects, exposure to <b>voltage</b> <b>spikes,</b> mechanical shock, frequency of cycling on and off, lamp orientation, and ambient operating temperature, among other factors.|$|E
25|$|The {{most popular}} simple snubber circuit {{consists}} {{out of a}} film capacitor and a resistor in series, connected in parallel with a semiconductor component to suppress or damp undesirable <b>voltage</b> <b>spikes.</b> The capacitor absorbs the inductive turn-off peak current temporarily, so that the resulting voltage spike is limited. But the trend in modern semiconductor technology is towards higher power applications, which increases the peak currents and switching speeds. In this case, the boundary between a standard electronic film capacitor and a power capacitor is blurred, so that larger snubber capacitors belong more {{in the area of}} power systems, electrical installations and plants.|$|E
25|$|Power {{capacitors}} can be {{used for}} a wide variety of applications, even where extremely non-sinusoidal voltages and pulsed currents are present. Both AC and DC capacitors are available. AC capacitors serve as damping or snubbing capacitors when connected in series with a resistor, and are also specified for the damping of undesirable <b>voltage</b> <b>spikes</b> caused by the so-called charge carrier storage effect during switching of power semiconductors. In addition, AC capacitors are used in low-detuned or close-tuned filter circuits for filtering or absorbing harmonics. As pulse discharge capacitors, they are useful in applications with reversing voltages, such as in magnetizing equipment.|$|E

25|$|Diodes are {{frequently}} used to conduct damaging high voltages away from sensitive electronic devices. They are usually reverse-biased (non-conducting) under normal circumstances. When the voltage {{rises above the}} normal range, the diodes become forward-biased (conducting). For example, diodes are used in (stepper motor and H-bridge) motor controller and relay circuits to de-energize coils rapidly without the damaging <b>voltage</b> <b>spikes</b> that would otherwise occur. (A diode used in such an application is called a flyback diode). Many integrated circuits also incorporate diodes on the connection pins to prevent external voltages from damaging their sensitive transistors. Specialized diodes are used to protect from over-voltages at higher power (see Diode types above).|$|E
25|$|More {{rarely a}} {{defect in the}} magnet can cause a quench. When this happens, that {{particular}} spot is subject to rapid Joule heating from the enormous current, which raises {{the temperature of the}} surrounding regions. This pushes those regions into the normal state as well, which leads to more heating in a chain reaction. The entire magnet rapidly becomes normal (this can take several seconds, {{depending on the size of}} the superconducting coil). This is accompanied by a loud bang as the energy in the magnetic field is converted to heat, and rapid boil-off of the cryogenic fluid. The abrupt decrease of current can result in kilovolt inductive <b>voltage</b> <b>spikes</b> and arcing. Permanent damage to the magnet is rare, but components can be damaged by localized heating, high voltages, or large mechanical forces.|$|E
2500|$|After {{forming a}} {{dielectric}} oxide on the rough anode structures, a counter-electrode has {{to match the}} rough insulating oxide surface. This {{is provided by the}} electrolyte, which acts as the cathode electrode of an electrolytic capacitor. Electrolytes may be [...] "non-solid" [...] (wet, liquid) or [...] "solid". Non-solid electrolytes, as a liquid medium that has an ion conductivity caused by moving ions, are relatively insensitive to <b>voltage</b> <b>spikes</b> or current surges. Solid electrolytes have an electron conductivity, which makes solid electrolytic capacitors sensitive to voltages spikes or current surges.|$|E

50|$|If a motor {{is running}} during a {{lightning}} strike {{on the power}} grid, the run capacitor might be damaged or weakened by a <b>voltage</b> <b>spike,</b> thus requiring replacement.|$|R
2500|$|Another {{method for}} suppressing <b>voltage</b> <b>spikes</b> is the transient-voltage-suppression diode (TVS). Although diodes {{do not have}} as much {{capacity}} to conduct large surges as MOVs, diodes are not degraded by smaller surges and can be implemented with a lower [...] "clamping voltage". MOVs degrade from repeated exposure to surges and generally have a higher [...] "clamping voltage" [...] so that leakage does not degrade the MOV. Both types are available {{over a wide range}} of voltages. MOVs tend to be more suitable for higher voltages, because they can conduct the higher associated energies at less cost.|$|E
2500|$|Snubbers are energy-absorbing {{circuits}} used {{to eliminate}} <b>voltage</b> <b>spikes</b> caused by circuit inductance when a switch opens. The {{purpose of the}} snubber is to improve electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) by eliminating the voltage transient that occurs when a switch abruptly opens, or by suppressing sparking of switch contacts (such as an automotive ignition coil with mechanical interrupter), or by limiting the voltage slew rate of semiconductor switches like thyristors, GTO thyristors, IGBTs and bipolar transistors. Snubber capacitors (or higher power [...] "damping capacitors") require a very low self-inductance and very low ESR capacitor construction. [...] These devices are also expected to be highly reliable because, if the snubber RC circuitry fails, a power semiconductor will be destroyed in most cases.|$|E
