A person's handshake can speak <b>volumes</b> <b>about</b> them and their personality. Chiarella (2006) wrote an article for Esquire magazine explaining to the predominantly male readership how handshakes differ {{from person to person}} and how they send nonverbal messages. He mentioned that holding the grip longer than two seconds will result in a stop in the verbal conversation, thus the nonverbal will override the verbal communication.|$|E

500|$|Fashion is Bhandarkar's fourth women-centric film after Chandni Bar (2001), Page3 (2005) and Corporate (2006) to earn {{widespread}} {{praise for}} their strong, independent female characters. According to The Times of India, Fashion [...] "is not about cliches alone and manages to transcend them with its moving tale of three women {{who try to}} maintain their honour, dignity, [...] identity in a cruel world that spills over with grime behind the glamour. The film not only takes you behind the psychedelic ramp, it travels through the dark inner recesses of the three lead characters, laying bare their strengths and weaknesses; their fears and hopes; their dreams and nightmares". Ananya Bhattacharya of Zee News said that the film [...] "went on to speak <b>volumes</b> <b>about</b> women, their aspirations and the dark side-effects of over-ambition". In {{an interview with the}} Hindustan Times, Chopra said that the film is [...] "an emotional tale and the story of three girls... shows female bonding in a beautiful way...".|$|E

500|$|Other {{critics were}} more positive. The New Statesmans Robert Potts found the stories [...] "entertaining and {{intriguing}} for readers familiar with their background {{and with the}} genre", {{and for the most}} part charmingly innocent, [...] "especially when compared with the reality of boarding-school life". [...] The evocation of adolescent homoeroticism was deliberate and playful rather than pornographic. In a similar vein, Richard Canning in The Independent found the Willow Gables fiction vibrant, well-constructed and entertaining, and praised Larkin's [...] "sly Sapphic spin". In a more recent analysis Terry Castle, writing in the journal Daedalus, disagrees profoundly with the notion expressed by Adam Kirsch in The Times Literary Supplement, that the publication of the Coleman works was damaging to Larkin's reputation. On the contrary, argues Castle, [...] "the Brunette phase speaks <b>volumes</b> <b>about</b> the paradoxical process by which Philip Larkin became 'Larkinesque'—modern English poetry's reigning bard of erotic frustration and depressive (if verse-enabling) self-deprecation".|$|E
500|$|The {{story was}} {{inspired}} partially by Foote's nephew, who struggled {{to succeed in}} the country music business. Foote was initially interested in writing a film based on his nephew's efforts to organize a band, which he saw as paralleling his own youthful attempts to find work as an actor. During his research, however, he met an experienced musician who had offered to help his nephew's band, and Foote found himself growing more interested in a story about him, rather than the band itself. Foote said, [...] "This older man had been through it all. As I thought about a storyline, I got very interested in that type of character." [...] The moment in the film where a woman asks, [...] "Were you really Mac Sledge?" [...] and he responds, [...] "Yes ma'am, I guess I was," [...] was based on an exchange that Foote overheard between a washed-up star and a fan. Foote said the entire film pivots on that statement, which he believed spoke <b>volumes</b> <b>about</b> Mac's personality and former status.|$|E
500|$|The Kasivisvesvara Temple at Lakkundi (Gadag district), the Dodda Basappa Temple at Dambal (Gadag district), the Mallikarjuna Temple at Kuruvatti (Bellary district), the Kallesvara Temple at Bagali (Davangere district), the Siddhesvara Temple at Haveri (Haveri district), the Amrtesvara Temple at Annigeri (Dharwad district), the Mahadeva Temple at Itagi (Koppal district), the Kaitabheshvara Temple at Kubatur, and the Kedareshvara Temple at Balligavi are {{the finest}} {{examples}} {{produced by the}} later Chalukya architects. The 12th-century Mahadeva Temple with its well executed sculptures is an exquisite example of decorative detail. The intricate, finely crafted carvings on walls, pillars and towers speak <b>volumes</b> <b>about</b> Chalukya taste and culture. An inscription outside the temple calls it [...] "Emperor of Temples" [...] (devalaya chakravarti) and relates that it was built by Mahadeva, a commander in the army of king Vikramaditya VI. The Kedareswara Temple (1060) at Balligavi {{is an example of}} a transitional Chalukya-Hoysala architectural style. The Western Chalukyas built temples in Badami and Aihole during their early phase of temple building activity, such as Mallikarjuna Temple, the Yellamma Temple and the Bhutanatha group of Temples.|$|E

500|$|Asked {{how does}} he think that the album has aged, Dave Mustaine responded: [...] "I think it's timely and {{timeless}} at the same time, and I think that's {{one of the most}} difficult things for a musician to do. Very few records in our genre are like that. Musically it's heavy and the lyrics are very symbolic." [...] In the liner notes of the album's 20th anniversary edition, music journalist Kory Grow wrote that [...] "thanks to a perfect balance of hard-rock song structures, epic choruses, and fleet-fingered guitar work, Countdown to Extinction became an instant classic, benefiting from copious MTV and radio play." [...] Artistdirect editor in chief Rick Florino called the album a [...] "seminal" [...] release and commented that it [...] "changed the game by preserving the band's thrash intensity and impressive technical prowess, while dropping some of the biggest hooks the genre had ever seen". In a retrospective review of the album, Craig Hayes from Popmatters wrote that Countdown to Extinctions [...] "status as a gateway metal album is indisputable" [...] and its [...] "popularity speaks <b>volumes</b> <b>about</b> its significance in the metal canon".|$|E
500|$|Twyne died on 4 July 1644, {{having made}} a will {{earlier that day}} in which he left his books and manuscripts to his college and the university. He made some pecuniary bequests to friends {{and those who had}} {{assisted}} him in his final illness. His manuscript collections amounted to 24 main <b>volumes</b> (<b>about</b> 12,000 pages) with other supplementary material. He was buried in the chapel of Corpus Christi. A hard-working researcher and collector of manuscripts, he was highly regarded and consulted by the legal scholar John Selden, the historian William Camden and Archbishop James Ussher. A later Keeper of the Archives, Strickland Gibson, described him in 1940 as [...] "one of the greatest of Oxford antiquaries". Twyne's collections, he said, were [...] "one of his greatest achievements, and in themselves a monument." [...] They were used extensively by Antony Wood in his history of the university but (noted Gibson) without proper credit being given. He was, however, disliked intensely by the city authorities for his actions against them. As it happens, many of the town's medieval records were lost in the early 17th century and are only known because Twyne had copied them into his collection.|$|E
500|$|Others {{have argued}} that the work was {{originally}} longer, with some hypothesizing that it comprised eight books. These individuals base their assertion on an AD 983 letter sent by Gerbertus Aureliacensis (later Pope SylvesterII) to the Archbishop of Rheims, in which the former reports that he had recently located [...] "eight <b>volumes</b> <b>about</b> astrology by Boethius" [...] (viii volumina Boetii de astrologia) at the abbey at Bobbio. Given that Boethius was often confused with Manilius (due to the fact that one of the former's names was [...] "Manlius"), those who favor the idea that the poem was once longer argue that the manuscript at Bobbio was a misattributed but nonetheless eight-book version of the Astronomica. Goold repudiates this hypothesis, noting that the catalogue at Bobbio lists the work Gerbertus was likely referring to as comprising [...] "three books by Boethius about arithmetic, and the rest [...] about astronomy" [...] (libros Boetii iii de aritmetica [...] et alterum de astronomia). This, Goold contends, is evidence suggesting that Gerbertus found a single manuscript containing both Boethius's De arithmetica and Manilius's Astronomicanot an eight-book version of the latter.|$|E

500|$|By {{the start}} of the 1890s, Lloyd had built up a {{successful}} catalogue of songs, which included [...] "What's That For, Eh?", about a little girl who asks her parents the meaning of various everyday household objects. Her biographer and theatre historian W. J. MacQueen-Pope described the song as being [...] "blue" [...] and thought that it spoke <b>volumes</b> <b>about</b> her reputation thanks to her [...] "wonderful wink, and that sudden, dazzling smile, and the nod of the head." [...] Similar-styled songs followed; [...] "She'd Never had her Ticket Punched Before", told the story of a young, naive woman travelling to London on her own by train. [...] This was followed by [...] "The Wrong Man Never Let a Chance go By"; [...] "We Don't Want to Fight, But, by Jingo, If we Do"; [...] "Oh You Wink the Other Eye" [...] and [...] "Twiggy Vous"—a song which won her much success and increased her popularity abroad. After an evening's performance at the Oxford music hall, a French well-wisher requested a conversation and to meet Lloyd backstage. [...] Flanked by Courtenay, she appeared at the stage door, where Courtenay threatened the man with violence as both had become suspicious of his interest in her. She took a chance and invited the man into her dressing room, where he identified himself {{as a member of the}} French government. He confirmed to her that [...] "Twiggy Vous" [...] was [...] "most popular in Paris"; she was delighted at the news. [...] At the end of the year, Lloyd returned to London where she appeared in the Christmas pantomime Cinderella in Peckham alongside her sister Alice.|$|E

2500|$|The classicist Lily Ross Taylor {{addresses}} this issue, as follows. Cicero, {{to refer}} to these two rival political groups, continually used the Latin word partes [...] Cicero (106–43) was {{a key figure in}} Roman politics who wrote <b>volumes</b> <b>about</b> it. In distinguishing the two groups, he employed the Latin terms optimates for proponents of the Senate nobility and populares for elite proponents of the popular demos or commoners. She points to the Roman historians Sallust (86–34) and Livy (59 BC-AD 17) for partial confirmation, as well as to later writers Plutarch (c.46–120), Appian (c.95-c.165), and Dio (c.155-c.235), and later still Machiavelli (1469–1527).|$|E
