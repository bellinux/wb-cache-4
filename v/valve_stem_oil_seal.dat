50|$|As {{valve guides}} wear, {{their ability to}} {{positively}} locate the valve to the valve seat decreases. As the valves lose their ability to seal the combustion chamber properly, the engine can lose performance and start to burn oil, leaking {{from the top of}} the cylinder head into the intake and exhaust manifolds. Modern engines are fitted with <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> <b>oil</b> <b>seals</b> which can be replaced if oil leakage occurs.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{simulation}} of oil leakage through a <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> seal involves complex fluid-structure interaction between a moving <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> (rigid body), <b>oil</b> and deformable <b>seal</b> (flexible body). In the simulation {{we used a}} full 3 D model of a seal and considered a two-way fluid-structure coupling between the <b>seal</b> (structure) and <b>oil</b> (fluid). The <b>seal</b> deformation is modeled with Abaqus-explicit and oil leakage with FlowVision (finite volume based CFD code). The calculation domain is descretized by a volume Cartesian grid with dynamic local adaptation and uses a Euler grid approach for {{simulation of}} the moving boundary. At each physical time step the simulation domain is re-meshed and loads are exchanged between Abaqus and FlowVision(FV). Pressure values calculated by FV are transferred to Abaqus-explicit to calculate the resulting seal deformation. The data is automatically exchanged using Capvidia’s Multi-Physics-Manager (MPM). The MPM links FV with Abaqus and transfers data via Abaqus user-subroutines. The approach described above allows us to perform {{detailed analysis of the}} oil leakage through a <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> for various engine loads and operational conditions. The <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> shape and material can be optimized to minimize the oil leakage...|$|R
40|$|Detailed exhaust {{emission}} data {{have been taken}} from a Cummins N- 14 single cylinder research engine in which the oil consumption was varied by different engine modifications. Low sulfur fuel was used, and oil consumption was varied by modifying the intake <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> seals, the exhaust <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> <b>seals,</b> the <b>oil</b> control ring and combinations of these modifications. Detailed measurements of exhaust gas particle size distributions and chemical composition were made for the various oil consumption configurations {{for a range of}} engine loads and speeds. The particulate mass was measured with TEOM and traditional gravimetric filter methods. Filter data for EC/OC, sulfates and trace metals have been taken and analyzed. The trace metals in the particulate mass {{serve as the basis for}} assessing oil consumption at the different operating conditions. The data indicate that the oil consumption for the steady state testing done here was approximately an order of magnitude below oil consumption values cited in the literature. We did measure changes in the details of the chemical composition of the particulate for the different engine operating conditions, but it did not correlate with changes in the oil consumption. Furthermore, the data indicate that the particle size distribution is not strongly impacted by low level oil consumption variations observed in this work...|$|R
50|$|For certain {{applications}} the <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> and disk {{are made}} of different steel alloys, or the <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> may be hollow and filled with sodium to improve heat transport and transfer. Although a better heat conductor, an aluminium cylinder head requires steel valve seat inserts, where a cast iron cylinder head would often have employed integral valve seats in the past. Because the <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> extends into lubrication in the cam chamber, it must be sealed against blow-by to prevent cylinder gases from escaping into the crankcase, even though the <b>stem</b> to <b>valve</b> clearance is very small, typically 0.04-0.06 mm, so a rubber lip-type seal is used to ensure that excessive oil is not drawn in from the crankcase on the induction stroke, and that exhaust gas does not enter the crankcase on the exhaust stroke. Worn valve guides and/or defective <b>oil</b> <b>seals</b> can often be diagnosed by a puff of blue smoke from the exhaust pipe on releasing the accelerator pedal after allowing the engine to overrun, when there is high manifold vacuum. Such a condition occurs when changing gear.|$|R
40|$|<b>Valve</b> <b>stem</b> {{seal leakage}} {{is a major}} source of {{fugitive}} emissions, and controlling these emissions can result in added expense in leak detection and repair programs. Elastomeric O-rings can be used as <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> seals, and O-ring manufacturers recommend lubrication of elastomeric seals to prevent damage and to assure proper sealing. In this research, a metallic coating was applied as a lubricant using a vacuum vapor deposition process to the surface of elastomeric <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> seals. <b>Valve</b> <b>stem</b> leak measurements were taken to determine if the coated O-rings, alone or with the recommended lubrication, reduced <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> seal leakage. This research determined that the metallic coating did not reduce <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> leakage...|$|R
40|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>seals</b> are {{commonly}} used in high speed multistage compressors.

50|$|The <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> is a tube made {{of metal}} or rubber, {{through which the}} tire is inflated, with a check valve, {{typically}} a Schrader valve on automobiles and most bicycle tires, or a Presta valve on high-performance bicycles. <b>Valve</b> <b>stems</b> usually protrude through the wheel for easy access. They mount directly to the rim, {{in the case of}} tubeless tires, or {{are an integral part of}} the inner tube. The rubber in <b>valve</b> <b>stems</b> eventually degrades, and, in the case of tubeless tires, replacement of the <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> at regular intervals or with tire replacement reduces the chance of failure. Some may notice that their <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> is all metal with a nut retaining it (as opposed to the typical rubber stem with brass threads). Most modern passenger vehicles are now required to have a tire pressure monitoring system which usually consists of a <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> attached to an electronic module. The module is hidden inside and is only visible when the tire has been removed from the wheel.|$|R

40|$|A {{non-metallic}} {{brush seal}} {{has been developed}} as an <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> for use in turbomachinary.

The said carbon matrix plug acting as a mandrel over which said carbon fiber rope is braided, said carbon fiber rope and carbon matrix plug forming a valve head portion suitable for mating with a valve seat; cutting said braided carbon <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> portion at one end to form a valve tip and cutting said braided carbon fiber after said valve head portion to form a valve face and thus provide a composite valve preform; and densifying said preform by embedding the braided carbon in a matrix of carbon to convert said <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> portion to a <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> and said <b>valve</b> head portion to a valve head thereby providing said composite valve...|$|R
40|$|Keywords:stop valve; bolt; valve stem; preload; stress analysis; ANSYS Abstract. The {{finite element}} model of {{electric}} stop valve with flange bolts preload and <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> force was established to improve the valve stress calculation method which was based only on action of fluid pressure, thermal stresses and pipe reaction forces. The principle and application of pretension load elements were expounded.

The results indicate {{the influence of the}} stresses on the valve caused by preload of bolt mounted on the flange and <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> force can not be ignored...|$|R
