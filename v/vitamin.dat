5|$|A <b>vitamin</b> is {{an organic}} {{compound}} and an essential nutrient that an organism requires in limited amounts. An organic chemical compound (or related set of compounds) {{is called a}} <b>vitamin</b> when the organism cannot synthesize the compound in sufficient quantities, {{and it must be}} obtained through the diet; thus, the term <b>vitamin</b> is conditional upon the circumstances and the particular organism. For example, ascorbic acid (one form of <b>vitamin</b> C) is a <b>vitamin</b> for humans, but not for most other animals. <b>Vitamin</b> D is essential only for people who do not have adequate skin exposure to sunlight, as ultraviolet light promotes synthesis in skin cells. Supplementation is important for the treatment of certain health problems, but there is little evidence of nutritional benefit when used by otherwise healthy people.|$|E
5|$|Hematinic {{deficiencies}} (<b>vitamin</b> B12, {{folic acid}} and iron), occurring singly or in combination, and {{with or without}} any underlying gastrointestinal disease, may be twice as common in people with RAS. However, iron and <b>vitamin</b> supplements only infrequently improve the ulceration. The relationship to <b>vitamin</b> B12 deficiency {{has been the subject}} of many studies. Although these studies found that 0–42% of those with recurrent ulcers suffer from <b>vitamin</b> B12 deficiency, an association with deficiency is rare. Even in the absence of deficiency, <b>vitamin</b> B12 supplementation may be helpful due to unclear mechanisms. Hematinic deficiencies can cause anemia, which is also associated with aphthous-like ulceration.|$|E
5|$|To {{balance the}} {{oxidative}} state, {{plants and animals}} maintain complex systems of overlapping antioxidants, such as glutathione and enzymes (e.g., catalase and superoxide dismutase) produced internally or the dietary antioxidants: <b>vitamin</b> A, <b>vitamin</b> C, and <b>vitamin</b> E.|$|E
40|$|The {{deficiency}} of <b>vitamins</b> {{is one of}} the main reasons of health worsening. The lack or the absence of <b>vitamins</b> results in metabolic disorders, decrease of physical and intellectual development, and quick fatigability of organism. Besides the regular inclusion of food, fortified with <b>vitamins,</b> the reliable source of <b>vitamins</b> and minerals are multivitamin preparations and <b>vitamins</b> and minerals complexes for the prophylactic use. At the time of administration <b>vitamins,</b> the daily need, the presence of micronutrients deficiency, and compatibility and balance of <b>vitamins</b> and minerals complexes must be taken into account.

50|$|B <b>Vitamins</b> are classic {{water-soluble}} <b>vitamins</b> which influence {{growth and}} development in several different ways.

5|$|Well-known human <b>vitamin</b> {{deficiencies}} involve thiamine (beriberi), niacin (pellagra), <b>vitamin</b> C (scurvy), and <b>vitamin</b> D (rickets). In much of {{the developed}} world, such deficiencies are rare; {{this is due to}} (1) an adequate supply of food and (2) the addition of vitamins and minerals to common foods (fortification). In addition to these classical <b>vitamin</b> deficiency diseases, some evidence has also suggested links between <b>vitamin</b> deficiency and a number of different disorders.|$|E
5|$|When a T-cell {{encounters}} a foreign pathogen, it extends a <b>vitamin</b> D receptor. This {{is essentially a}} signaling device that allows the T-cell to bind to the active form of <b>vitamin</b> D, the steroid hormone calcitriol. T-cells have a symbiotic relationship with <b>vitamin</b> D. Not only does the T-cell extend a <b>vitamin</b> D receptor, in essence asking to bind to the steroid hormone version of <b>vitamin</b> D, calcitriol, but the T-cell expresses the gene CYP27B1, which is the gene responsible for converting the pre-hormone version of <b>vitamin</b> D, calcidiol into the steroid hormone version, calcitriol. Only after binding to calcitriol can T-cells perform their intended function. Other immune system cells that are known to express CYP27B1 and thus activate <b>vitamin</b> D calcidiol, are dendritic cells, keratinocytes and macrophages.|$|E
5|$|Antioxidant dietary {{supplements}} do not improve health {{nor are they}} effective in preventing diseases as shown by randomized clinical trials including supplements of beta-carotene, <b>vitamin</b> A, and <b>vitamin</b> E singly or in different combinations having no effect on mortality rate or cancer risk. Supplementation with selenium or <b>vitamin</b> E does not {{reduce the risk of}} cardiovascular disease. Oxidative stress can be considered as either a cause or consequence of some diseases, an area of research stimulating drug development for antioxidant compounds for use as potential therapies.|$|E
25|$|While some <b>vitamins</b> have {{no known}} {{tolerable}} upper intake level, others, including <b>vitamins</b> A and D, {{are known to}} be toxic at high doses. All <b>vitamins</b> known to be toxic in high doses are fat-soluble, not water-soluble, as water-soluble <b>vitamins</b> can be voided via urine within a reasonable timeframe.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Vitamins</b> may {{be added}} to a bulk {{premixed}} nutrient immediately before administration, since the additional <b>vitamins</b> can promote spoilage of stored product [...] <b>Vitamins</b> can be added in two doses, one fat-soluble, the other water-soluble. There are also single-dose preparations with both fat- and water-soluble <b>vitamins</b> such as Cernevit.|$|R
50|$|With few exceptions, {{like some}} <b>vitamins</b> from B-complex, hypervitaminosis usually occurs more with fat-soluble <b>vitamins</b> (D, E, K and A or 'DEKA'), which {{are stored in}} the liver and fatty tissues of the body.

5|$|Cabbages are {{prepared}} {{in many different}} ways for eating. They can be pickled, fermented for dishes such as sauerkraut, steamed, stewed, sautéed, braised, or eaten raw. Cabbage is a good source of <b>vitamin</b> K, <b>vitamin</b> C and dietary fiber.|$|E
5|$|Cobalt is {{essential}} to the metabolism of all animals. It is a key constituent of cobalamin, also known as <b>vitamin</b> B, the primary biological reservoir of cobalt as an ultratrace element. Bacteria in the guts of ruminant animals convert cobalt salts into <b>vitamin</b> B, a compound which can only be produced by bacteria or archaea. The minimum presence of cobalt in soils therefore markedly improves the health of grazing animals, and an uptake of 0.20mg/kg a day is recommended because they have no other source of <b>vitamin</b> B.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Vitamins</b> {{can also}} be {{interpreted}} as being metaphors for alcohol. The narrator is seen to be drinking alcohol throughout the story and the <b>vitamins</b> may represent the negative effects {{played out in the}} life of his wife, Patti. Patti constantly thinks about <b>vitamins</b> in much the way that an alcoholic thinks about drinking. Patti confides to the narrator that she feels suffocated by <b>vitamins,</b> and that she wants to escape from <b>vitamins.</b> These feelings are similar to ones that an alcoholic feels and in the end, the <b>vitamins</b> are seen to be destroying the marriage.|$|R

50|$|B <b>vitamins,</b> {{also known}} as the B-complex, are an interrelated group of {{nutrients}} which often co-occur in food. The complex consists of: thiamine (B1), riboflavin (B2), niacin (B3), pantothenic acid (B5), pyridoxin (B6), folic acid (B9), cobalamin (B12), and biotin. B <b>vitamins</b> are not synthesized in the body, and thus need to be obtained from food. B-complex <b>vitamins</b> are water-soluble <b>vitamins,</b> which means that they are not stored within the body. In consequence, the B <b>vitamins</b> need ongoing replenishment.|$|R

5|$|For {{people who}} need rapid {{reversal}} of warfarin such as due to serious bleeding or need emergency surgery, the effects of warfarin can be reversed with <b>vitamin</b> K, prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), or fresh frozen plasma (FFP) in addition to intravenous <b>vitamin</b> K. Blood products should not be routinely used to reverse warfarin overdose when <b>vitamin</b> K could work alone. PCC {{has been found to}} be better than FFP when rapid reversal is needed.|$|E
5|$|It is conjectured that a {{progressive}} decline in hormone levels with age is partially responsible for weakened immune responses in aging individuals. Conversely, some hormones are {{regulated by the}} immune system, notably thyroid hormone activity. The age-related decline in immune function is also related to decreasing <b>vitamin</b> D levels in the elderly. As people age, two things happen that negatively affect their <b>vitamin</b> D levels. First, they stay indoors more due to decreased activity levels. This means that they get less sun and therefore produce less cholecalciferol via UVB radiation. Second, as a person ages the skin becomes less adept at producing <b>vitamin</b> D.|$|E

The evidence for effectiveness for such treatments in most cases is weak or absent. Examples of treatments used by patients include dietary supplementation and regimens such as <b>vitamin</b> D, calcium, <b>vitamin</b> B12, and antioxidants.
