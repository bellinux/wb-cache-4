Upon its release, Chris Phillips from the Live at the Vault show on BRfm 97.3 called it one of the best albums of the year. Luke McNaney of The Music Fix rated it 8/10 and praised the album, using terms like [...] "swooning melodies", [...] "beguilingly sexy rock", and [...] "prowling guitars". He appreciated the final third of the album the most, and declared [...] "the band have proved their belltower remains a den of intoxicating noise." [...] Scott Causer of Contactmusic rated it 7/10 and expected to hear Stoermer produce an album full of indie anthem pop songs, similar to those of The Killers, but was surprised to instead hear a darker creation. He ended his review by stating that [...] "Howling Bells {{are one of the most}} interesting bands in the world right now and should be cherished as such." [...] Tom O'Donovan of V Music acknowledged that Juanita stood out from her female-fronted counterparts and praised her <b>vocal</b> <b>capacity</b> for its diverse range.

He worked subsequently on [...] "Baollak Eih" [...] (Tell You What) record in 1995 and musically composed all its tracks. The record {{was produced by}} Laser Records owned by Mustafa Dagher. In this record, Ameer Abdel Mageed recommended Angham to pick up songs that demonstrate her full <b>vocal</b> <b>capacities</b> alongside emotions. The track [...] "Tekdar Aal Meshwar" [...] (Are You Up To The Long Journey) was sung in 7.6 octave voice with a rich oriental music background. [...] "Law Hasseit" [...] which was filmed as a music video is the first track to contain quick Latin/Spanish beats, and perhaps helped Angham gain more popular in the young demographic. The sound engineering was taken care by Ameen Akef, Hussein Aahdy, and Omro Hashem, while the record was co-produced by Angham and Adel Othman Helal. The record received good review, and was perhaps the first record to be successful without her father's help.|$|R
40|$|Aims: This single-case study {{assess the}} {{emotional}} expression {{in a patient}} affected with Steinert disease {{in order to better}} analyze the patient's therapeutical needs as well as widen our perspective on the therapeutical means in speech therapy. Methods: A neutral text was read by the patient and a comedian, with five different emotions (joy, anger, fear, sadness and neutral). A group of judges identified the emotions by categorical choice and graded their intensity on a 4 -point scale. The samples included three modes: visual, audio and audio-visual. Results: Compared to the comedian, the patient’s expression of emotion is less well perceived in the visual mode (65 %> 51 %, (p= 0. 009)). In the gradation of intensity, there is a better correlation for the comedian (0. 583 > 0. 325, p< 0. 001) than for the patient. Conclusion: The results suggests that the emotions expressed by the patient are less well identified, especially through the visual channel, which confirms the influence of the patient’s disease on the quality of his emotional expressions. In addition, the fact that the patient's expressions are less well transmitted through the facial channel leads the author to consider a therapy focused not only on <b>vocal</b> <b>capacities</b> but also on facial mimicry.

40|$|Voice range profile {{measurement}} {{is being}} used {{more and more as}} a practical clinical tool in the process of voice evaluation. In principle it means a graphical representation of a patient's or person's vocal capabilities concerning the fundamental frequency range and dynamic range on several arbitrarily chosen pitches. The examination of these two most important aspects of the voice has, in fact, been routinely done since interest in the voice started {{in the early days of}} phoniatrics and voice care. These two features are represented in the phonetogram after being measured in an objective and instrumental way. This information represents the capacity of one's voice, and needs to be evaluated against the vocal needs and demands put on the voice. A teacher with low <b>vocal</b> <b>capacities</b> might encounter the fact that daily occupational life presents him/her with great voice-straining demands, which could develop into a voice disorder. The voice range profile might then be used as a tool for explanation. This is usually called functional disorder where the balance between capacities and demands is lost. For a proper voice evaluation the next two steps are necessary: laryngeal examination with stroboscopy to reveal possible organic causes, and a careful exploration of the vocal demands by history taking...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Musical theater {{performers}} are {{a special}} group of elite vocal performers {{with a high}} vocal load as they combine singing, acting, and physical performance. As they are absolutely depending on their voice quality and <b>vocal</b> <b>capacities</b> for their studies and their future profession, an optimal voice production is very important. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the voice quality of musical theater students. The voice quality of seven students was then reevaluated 1 year after the first assessment. Study design: Observational study. Methods: Thirty-one musical students (7 men and 24 women) with a mean age of 20 years participated in the study. To determine the voice quality, objective (aerodynamic measurements, voice range profile, acoustic analysis, and Dysphonia Severity Index) and subjective (videolaryngostroboscopy, Voice Handicap Indexes, and questionnaires regarding voice symptoms and risk factors) voice measurements were performed. Results: The median Dysphonia Severity Index in male and female musical students was respectively 5. 3 and 5. 7, both corresponding with an overall good voice quality. The questionnaires revealed the presence of vocal fatigue, dryness of the throat, vocal tract discomfort, and harmful vocal habits in the majority of students. In 45 % of the subjects, videolaryngostroboscopic evaluation of the vocal folds showed an organic lesion. The majority of these lesions are inflammatory lesions (26 %).

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the short-term effect of 2 semi-occluded vocal tract training programs, "resonant voice training using nasal consonants" versus "straw phonation," on the vocal quality of vocally healthy future occupational voice users. Method: A multigroup pretest-posttest randomized control group design was used. Thirty healthy speech-language pathology students with a mean age of 19 years (range: 17 - 22 years) were randomly assigned into a resonant voice training group (practicing resonant exercises across 6 weeks, n = 10), a straw phonation group (practicing straw phonation across 6 weeks, n = 10), or a control group (receiving no voice training, n = 10). A voice assessment protocol consisting of both subjective (questionnaire, participant's self-report, auditory-perceptual evaluation) and objective (maximum performance task, aerodynamic assessment, voice range profile, acoustic analysis, acoustic voice quality index, dysphonia severity index) measurements and determinations was used to evaluate the participants' voice pre- and posttraining. Groups were compared over time using linear mixed models and generalized linear mixed models. Within-group effects of time were determined using post hoc pairwise comparisons. Results: No significant time x group interactions were found for any of the outcome measures, indicating no differences in evolution over time among the 3 groups. Within-group effects of time showed a significant improvement in dysphonia severity index in the resonant voice training group, and a significant improvement in the intensity range in the straw phonation group. Conclusions: Results suggest that the semi-occluded vocal tract training programs using resonant voice training and straw phonation may have a positive impact on the vocal quality and <b>vocal</b> <b>capacities</b> of future occupational voice users. The resonant voice training caused an improved dysphonia severity index, and the straw phonation training caused an expansion of the intensity range in this population...|$|R

As they are absolutely depending on their vocal quality and <b>vocal</b> <b>capacities</b> for their studies and their future profession, an optimal voice coaching is very important. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the voice quality, voice symptoms and the risk factors for developing voice problems in future elite vocal performers (musical theater performers). Thirty-one Musical students (7 men and 24 women) with a mean age of 20 years participated to the study. To determine the objective voice quality aerodynamic measurements, voice range profile, acoustic analysis and Dysphonia Severity Index were used. To inventory the voice symptoms and the risk factors for developing voice disorders the Dutch version of the checklists (De Bodt et al. 2008) of Russel et al. (2000) were used. The questionnaires investigate the presence and the frequency (never, daily, weekly, monthly) of voice symptoms and risk factors (vocal abuse, vocal misuse) as reported by the subjects. Psychosocial impact of a voice disorder was investigated using the the Voice Handicap Index and Singing Voice Handicap Index. The mean DSI in male and female Musical theater students was respectively 3. 9 and 5. 6, both corresponding with an overall good vocal quality. The results of the VHI showed no important psychosocial impact on the speaking voice. Despite the overall good vocal quality, more than 40 % experienced voice symptoms on a regular basis. Vocal misuse and abuse was also frequently reported. Videolaryngostroboscopy revealed a high presence of organic and functional voice disorders.

50|$|Prior to surgery, {{the patient}} must be {{informed}} of serious, debilitating, and permanent consequences of surgery, most notably the loss of speaking capacity with severity correlating to the portion of vocal cords removed. A patient will be incapable of producing most vocal sounds following total cordectomy, although certain primal deep guttural screams may still be produced, with the patient almost always retaining the ability to speak in whispers. There is little no chance of a patient recovering their voice following a complete or near-complete cordectomy as the procedure literally removes the organs responsible for vocal utterances, and patients with a less-than-entire cordectomy will always lose some or most of their vocal range (again corresponding to the section and amount of removed vocal cords). Doctors are encouraged to explore alternative communication technologies with patients (such as voice-boxes, whisper-amplifying devices, and text=to-speak software) prior to determining the acceptability of the procedure. Patients {{should be made to}} understand that the procedure is absolutely permanent and their <b>vocal</b> <b>capacity</b> (with current technology) will never recover to its range prior to the surgery, and patients with small percentages of cord removals will experience disproportionately severe loss of vocal range compared to the loss suffered by patients who have undergone a near-entire cordectomy procedure.|$|E

5000|$|His first {{appearance}} {{was made at}} Swansea. After playing at Southampton, Portsmouth, and other towns {{in the south of}} England, he obtained an engagement in Bath. The first printed mention of him in connection with this city which can be traced is 19 May 1819, when for his benefit he played Don Guzman in Giovanni in London. At this period he had probably {{been a member of the}} company four or five years. A reference to his playing with Kean in Richard III which appears in his [...] "Recollections", points to the spring of 1815 as the time of his {{first appearance}}. He then proceeded to Dublin as one of a company engaged by Henry Harris of Covent Garden to play in the new theatre in that city. Among the company was Miss Green, an actress of little reputation, who subsequently made her first appearance in London with Bedford as Mrs. Bedford. The period of the Dublin migration appears to have been 1820. Two successive tours in Scotland with Madame Catalani followed, without breaking the Dublin engagement, which only ended when Bedford accepted an offer from Sir Henry Bishop for Drury Lane. Bedford's first appearance at this theatre took place as Hawthorn in 'Love in a Village', 2 November 1824, Mrs. Bedford, late Miss Green, playing Rosetta. The occasion was also signalised by the first appearance of Terry, who took the character of Justice Woodcock. On the 10th of the same month Bedford played Bernhard, head ranger of the forest, in Soane's version of Der Freischütz, the fifth and the most successful adaptation of Weber's great opera which that year had achieved. Soon afterwards he was promoted to Caspar in the same opera. Through successive managements of Elliston, Price, Polhill and Lee, and lastly Bunn, Bedford kept a position chiefly due to his <b>vocal</b> <b>capacity.</b> In 1833 he joined, still as a singer, the company at Covent Garden under Macready, appearing in Fra Diavolo, Gustavus III, and other operas.|$|E

West, 1995) but showed incompetent courtship of female cowbirds. In their 2 nd year, half of the males were housed with older males and female cowbirds, and half were housed with only females. Those exposed to older males courted much more successfully than did those deprived of such experience. All males developed new repertoires, and song potencies did not correlate across years. The data reveal intraspecific variation in the ontogeny of mate recognition but intraspecific dependence on social learning to acquire courtship skills. In the experiments reported here, we manipulated juve-nile Molothrus ater ater cowbirds ' opportunities for social and vocal interaction during their 1 st and 2 nd years. We bad three goals. First, we looked for intraspecific variation in the ontogeny of mate recognition in cowbirds. Second, we examined interrelationships between <b>vocal</b> <b>capacity</b> and vo-cal performance. Third, we investigated the role social experience with older conspecific males may play in con-solidating the courtship skills of younger males. Our interest in intraspecific variation in mate recognition derived from field and laboratory studies suggesting con-siderable ontogenetic variation among cowbird subspecies, especially in processes related to vocal communicatio...|$|E
40|$|The 19 th-century {{fascination with}} madness {{led to a}} {{theatrical}} phenomenon most palpably represented in the operatic mad scene, where the insane heroine expresses her madness in an aria of ‘phenomenal difficulty’ (Ashley 2002). This research explores the representation of female madness as power in the mad scenes of two famously mad opera characters: Lucia from Gaetano Donizetti’s Lucia di Lammermoor (1835) and Ophélie from Ambroise Thomas’s Hamlet (1868). The objective is to investigate the representation of female madness in the libretti, the musical scores and in visual performances, in order to challenge the notion of female madness as weakness. The research was conducted using a qualitative research paradigm. The study explored the depiction of female madness in various fields of artistic representation, {{and the concept of}} power and female power in literature, resulting in the novel interpretation of these enigmatic mad scenes. This was a hermeneutic study considered within an interpretive paradigm. The research was conducted in three stages: a literature review, a full score analysis and a visual performance analysis. The results show that the 19 th-century gendered paradigm shift of madness to an overtly female disorder, led to various artistic interpretations of the madwoman, most notably in art, literature, theatre and opera. Opera proved to be the ultimate platform for the musical depiction of female madness, particularly due to the virtuosic <b>vocal</b> <b>capacity</b> of the coloratura soprano. In spite of social and political advancement, women were portrayed as weak in operatic plots. It was established that a delicate balance exists between power and powerlessness in the operatic mad scene. Both Lucia and Ophélie are women trapped in a patriarchal environment, and the onset of their madness is traditionally attributed to the weak default of their gender and their inability to process dramatic emotional events. However, the composers’ musical realisation of madness, as well as the embodied performance of both characters by the soloists, accentuates the interplay between madness as weakness and, most importantly, madness as empowerment. The study shows that the powerlessness associated with female madness is paradoxically reversed by the very factors that denote female madness in the operatic mad scene, namely gender and vocal virtuosity. Numerous musical and visual performance elements employed by composers and directors, notably depicting the madwoman as feeble, point to the empowerment of the seemingly ‘weak’ soprano. Musical elements used to portray madness include deconstruction, orchestration and high pitch. The study revealed additional musical elements, such as the inclusion of themes from previous acts of the opera, the use of specific instrumentation and a capella passages for soprano. The study argues that the characteristics that define female madness in music, namely gender and vocal excess, specifically contribute to the representation of madness as power. Elaborate coloratura vocal passages and scant orchestration are the two musical elements used by Donizetti and Thomas to assist in the depiction of female madness as power in the operatic mad scene. Consequently the study establishes that the extravagant vocal virtuosity displayed by the coloratura soprano casts the madwoman as powerful in the operatic mad scene.

40|$|Cochlear implant (CI) {{recipients}} usually {{complain about}} poor speech understanding {{in the presence}} of noise. Indeed, they generally show ceiling effects for understanding sentences presented in quiet, but their scores decrease drastically when testing {{in the presence of}} competing noise. One important aspect that contributes to speech perception skills, especially when listening in a fluctuating background, has been described as Temporal Fine Structure (TFS) processing. TFS cues are more dominant in conveying Low Frequency (LF) signals linked in particular to Fundamental Frequency (F 0), which is crucial for linguistic and musical perception. A§E Harmonic Intonation (HI) and Disharmonic Intonation (DI) are tests of pitch perception in the LF domain and their outcomes are believed to depend on the availability of TFS cues. Previous findings indicated that the DI test provided more differential LF pitch perception outcomes in that it reflected phase locking and TFS processing capacities of the ear, whereas the HI test provided information on its place coding capacity as well. Previous HI/DI studies were mainly done in adult population showing abnormal pitch perception outcomes in CI recipients and there was no or limited data in paediatric population as well as HI/DI outcomes in relation to speech perception outcomes in the presence of noise. One of the primary objectives of this thesis has been to investigate LF pitch perception skills in a group of pediatric CI recipients in comparison to normal hearing (NH) children. Another objective was to introduce a new assessment tool, the Italian STARR test which was based on measurement of speech perception using a roving-level adaptive method where the presentation level of both speech and noise signals varied across sentences. The STARR test attempts to reflect a better representation of real world listening conditions where background noise is usually present and speech intensity varies according to <b>vocal</b> <b>capacity</b> as well as the distance of the speaker. The Italian STARR outcomes in NH adults were studied to produce normative data, as well as to evaluate interlist variability and learning effects. Finally, LF pitch perception outcomes linked to availability of TFS were investigated in a group of adult CI recipients including bimodal users in relation to speech perception, in particular Italian STARR outcomes. Results were interesting: Although the majority of CI recipient children showed abnormal outcomes for A§E, their scores were considerably better than in the adult CI users. Age had a statistically significant effect on performance in both children and adults; younger children and older adults tended to show poorer performance. Similarly, CI recipient adults (even the better performers) showed abnormal STARR outcomes in comparison to NH subjects and group differences were statistically significant. The duration of profound deafness before implantation had a significant effect on STARR performance. On the other hand, the significant effect of CI thresholds re-emphasized the sensitivity of the test to lower level speech which a CI user can face very often during everyday life. Analysis revealed statistically significant correlations between HI/DI and STARR performance. Moreover, contralateral hearing aid users showed significant bimodal benefit for both HI/DI and STARR tests. Overall findings confirmed the usefulness of evaluating both LF pitch and speech perception in order to track changes in TFS sensitivity for CI recipients over time and across different listening conditions which might be provided by future technological advances as well as to study individual differences...|$|E
