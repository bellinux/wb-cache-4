5|$|During secret {{surrender}} {{negotiations with}} the Allies in early September, the Italian government offered to open the ports of Taranto and Brindisi on the eastern coast. German forces in that area were <b>very</b> <b>weak</b> and {{would be expected to}} withdraw rather than fight if the Allies landed there. General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander in the Mediterranean, quickly planned a third landing, codenamed Slapstick, {{to take advantage of the}} offer.|$|E
5|$|Optical {{heterodyne}} detection {{is used for}} coherent Doppler lidar measurements capable of detecting <b>very</b> <b>weak</b> light scattered in the atmosphere and monitoring wind speeds with high accuracy. It has application in optical fiber communications, in various high resolution spectroscopic techniques, and the self-heterodyne method {{can be used to}} measure the linewidth of a laser.|$|E
50|$|A further {{development}} as a semi-portable engine was the tank-bed engine. This replaced the flat lower frame with a deep, cast-iron 'bath tub'. This improved the rigidity of the frame, such that the engines could {{be placed on the}} <b>very</b> <b>weakest</b> foundations. Many of these engines, in colonial use, were merely staked down to timber baulks, rather than being built onto masonry.|$|R
50|$|The {{team are}} {{currently}} {{one of the}} <b>very</b> <b>weakest</b> {{in the world and}} are, as of March 2016 are ranked 46th and last in the Asian Football Confederation with zero points and 193rd in the world on the official FIFA / Coca Cola rankings. Their highest ranking achieved was 159th, which they last reached in April 2015 following their two World Cup qualifying victories over Sri Lanka.|$|R

5|$|An area of squally {{weather was}} first noted {{a few hundred}} miles east of the Lesser Antilles on September 18. The {{convective}} area organized into a tropical depression near the north coast of Hispaniola on September 20. After moving west-northwestward for a day, it turned northeastward, where upper level winds were very favorable and steering currents were <b>very</b> <b>weak.</b> On September 22 Gracie was named as a tropical depression before it developed into Tropical Storm Gracie, followed by reaching hurricane strength later that night. It turned to the east on September 25, and turned back west to west-northwest on September 27 as a stable anticyclone built in to its north.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} arthropods, chelicerates' cuticles would block out {{information}} about the outside world, except that they are penetrated by many sensors or connections from sensors to the nervous system. In fact, spiders and other arthropods have modified their cuticles into elaborate arrays of sensors. Various touch and vibration sensors, mostly bristles called setae, respond to different levels of force, from strong contact to <b>very</b> <b>weak</b> air currents. Chemical sensors provide equivalents of taste and smell, often by means of setae.|$|E
5|$|Bond and Leiter {{alert the}} Thunderball war room of their suspicions of Largo {{and join the}} crew of the American nuclear {{submarine}} Manta as the ransom deadline nears. The Manta chases the Disco Volante to capture it and recover the bombs en route to the first target. An undersea battle ensues between the crews, while Bond fights Largo. Bond, now <b>very</b> <b>weak</b> from his efforts to disable the bombs, tries to get away, but Largo corners him in an underwater cave and easily overpowers him. Before Largo can finish Bond off Domino shoots him with a spear gun. The bombs are recovered and Bond is sent to hospital with Domino.|$|E
50|$|Cannabis tea is an {{herbal tea}} that is <b>very</b> psychoactively <b>weak</b> {{due to the}} lack of fat and alcohol in the drink.|$|R
60|$|Tarzan {{thought that}} he was dead, until he {{suddenly}} raised his eyes to those of the ape-man, sighed, and spoke--in a <b>very</b> low, <b>weak</b> whisper.|$|R
30|$|<b>Very</b> narrow <b>weak</b> signals, {{observed}} in all spectra under discussion, originate from paramagnetic impurities in the substrate [24], {{and they are}} not analyzed in this work.|$|R
5|$|Despite being a <b>very</b> <b>weak</b> storm, forecasters were wary about Katrina, as Central America {{was devastated}} by Hurricane Mitch exactly one year earlier. There was {{considerable}} fear of additional flash flooding and mudslides across the mountainous region. Immediately after being declared a tropical depression, {{a tropical storm}} warning was issued for Nicaragua, and it was extended to the San Andrés islands of Colombia shortly afterward. Officials in Honduras evacuated 71 families from the district of Colón and another 17 families from other at-risk areas. Along the coastline of Honduras, a red alert was declared as torrential rains were anticipated to produce deadly mudslides in areas still recovering from Mitch nearly one year ago.|$|E
5|$|In {{the area}} of Pendjari National Park, almost all West African males are maneless or have <b>very</b> <b>weak</b> manes. Maneless, male African lions have also been {{reported}} from Senegal, from Sudan (Dinder National Park), and from Tsavo East National Park in Kenya, and the original male white lion from Timbavati also was maneless. The testosterone hormone {{has been linked to}} mane growth; therefore, castrated lions often have minimal to no mane, as the removal of the gonads inhibits testosterone production. In addition, increased testosterone may be the cause of the maned lionesses of northern Botswana.|$|E
5|$|Osmium tetroxide {{has been}} used in {{fingerprint}} detection and in staining fatty tissue for optical and electron microscopy. As a strong oxidant, it cross-links lipids mainly by reacting with unsaturated carbon–carbon bonds and thereby both fixes biological membranes in place in tissue samples and simultaneously stains them. Because osmium atoms are extremely electron-dense, osmium staining greatly enhances image contrast in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies of biological materials. Those carbon materials have otherwise <b>very</b> <b>weak</b> TEM contrast (see image). Another osmium compound, osmium ferricyanide (OsFeCN), exhibits similar fixing and staining action.|$|E
60|$|But {{it was a}} <b>very</b> dumb, <b>weak,</b> {{helpless}} self, a crawling nursling. He {{went about}} very quiet, and in a way, submissive. He had an unalterable self at last, free, separate, independent.|$|R
40|$|We study {{theoretically}} {{the electron}} transport properties in achiral carbon nanotubes {{under the influence}} of an external electric field E(t) using Boltzmann’s transport equation to derive the current-density. A negative differential conductivity (NDC) is predicted in quasi-static approximation i. e. , ωτ 0 is equal to the amplitude of the AC electric field E 1 . The peak of the NDC intensity occurs at <b>very</b> <b>weaker</b> fields than that of superlattice under the same conditions. The peak intensity decreases and shifts to right with the increase in the amplitude of the ac field. This mechanism suppresses the domain formation and therefore could be used in terahertz frequency generation...|$|R

5|$|Researchers {{found out}} that <b>very</b> <b>weak</b> {{electromagnetic}} fields disrupt the magnetic compass used by European robins and other songbirds to navigate using the Earth's magnetic field. Neither power lines nor cellphone signals {{are to blame for}} the electromagnetic field effect on the birds, according to the new study published in the 8 May 2014 edition of the journal Nature. Instead, the culprits consist of frequencies between 2kHz and 5MHz, such as AM radio signals and ordinary electronic equipment that might be found in businesses or private homes.|$|E
5|$|The M249 LMG entered {{service in}} 1984 as the M249 SAW. Initial {{reactions}} to the gun were mixed: it fulfilled the light machine gun role well when fired from the ground, but was not as effective when fired from the shoulder or hip. It was praised for its extreme durability and massive firepower, though {{a number of areas}} for improvement were highlighted: the blank firing attachment fitted poorly, the bipod was <b>very</b> <b>weak</b> and broke easily, the sling attachment was awkward, and there were many slots and gaps that accumulated dirt. Some claimed that the heavy-barrelled version of the M16 rifle was a more effective light machine gun.|$|E
5|$|The comedian {{has said}} that he likes playing weak characters, and {{particularly}} revealing weaknesses in high status figures. During the course of the show, he will frequently peel back the Colbert character's apparent bravado to expose a <b>very</b> <b>weak</b> inner core. In one instance, Colbert demands one of his staff members subject him to simulated waterboarding, only to break down into pleas for mercy upon hearing a water bottle cap popped. In another episode, he criticizes The Today Show cohost Matt Lauer for saying that it's unacceptable for men to cry, only to sob hysterically upon learning that Katie Couric has left the show. These status shifts occur commonly, and constitute a central component of the show's comedy.|$|E

50|$|Hans Taubemann (Hansu Tābuman) (nicknamed Fox (Fokkusu)) is an English fox zoanthrope with a warped {{mind and}} {{heightened}} aesthetic sense. He {{is obsessed with}} beauty and despises ugly things, boasting of his good looks and publicly declaring all else ugly. Abandoned {{as a child and}} raised in the slums, he grew up into a well-known scoundrel. He earned the nickname of Fox from his wariness and cruelty in beating up even the <b>very</b> <b>weakest.</b> He works for the Organization in the same unit as Bakuryū and engages in such activities as kidnapping and murder. After the events of the story, Fox kills another civilian, but is shocked to discover that it is his own mother.|$|R
60|$|Rome, at her <b>very</b> <b>weakest,</b> {{has always}} been a river that wanders and widens and that waters many fields. Berlin, at its strongest, will never be {{anything}} but a whirlpool, which seeks its own centre, and is sucked down. It would only narrow all the rest of Europe, as it has already narrowed all the rest of Germany. There is a spirit of diseased egoism, which at last makes all things spin upon one pin-point in the brain. It is a spirit expressed more often in the slangs than in the tongues of men. The English call it a fad. I do not know what the Italians call it; the Prussians call it philosophy.|$|R
5|$|The {{destruction}} of the North Korean Army at Pusan made communist continuation of the war impossible with North Korean troops alone. The massive equipment and manpower losses rivaled those of the ROK Army in the first stages of the war. The North Koreans totally collapsed as a fighting force, and the remainder of their routed military retreated into North Korea offering <b>very</b> <b>weak</b> resistance against the UN force, which was now on the offensive with overwhelming superiority by land, air and sea. Many of the outmaneuvered North Korean units simply surrendered, having been reduced from units of thousands {{to just a few}} hundred men.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} arthropods, spiders' cuticles would block out {{information}} about the outside world, except that they are penetrated by many sensors or connections from sensors to the nervous system. In fact, spiders and other arthropods have modified their cuticles into elaborate arrays of sensors. Various touch sensors, mostly bristles called setae, respond to different levels of force, from strong contact to <b>very</b> <b>weak</b> air currents. Chemical sensors provide equivalents of taste and smell, often by means of setae. Pedipalps carry {{a large number of}} such setae sensitive to contact chemicals and air-borne smells, such as female pheromones. Spiders also have in the joints of their limbs slit sensillae that detect forces and vibrations. In web-building spiders, all these mechanical and chemical sensors are more important than the eyes, while the eyes are most important to spiders that hunt actively.|$|E
5|$|At {{atmospheric}} pressure, {{molecular nitrogen}} condenses (liquefies) at 77K (−195.79°C) and freezes at 63K (−210.01°C) into the beta hexagonal close-packed crystal allotropic form. Below 35.4K (−237.6°C) nitrogen assumes the cubic crystal allotropic form (called the alpha phase). Liquid nitrogen, a colourless fluid resembling water in appearance, but with 80.8% of the density (the density of liquid nitrogen at its boiling point is 0.808g/mL), {{is a common}} cryogen. Solid nitrogen has many crystalline modifications. It forms a significant dynamic surface coverage on Pluto and outer moons of the Solar System such as Triton. Even at the low temperatures of solid nitrogen it is fairly volatile and can sublime to form an atmosphere, or condense back into nitrogen frost. It is <b>very</b> <b>weak</b> and flows {{in the form of}} glaciers and on Triton geysers of nitrogen gas come from the polar ice cap region.|$|E

5|$|At both Portsmouth and Cirencester, Hammond {{excelled at}} sports {{including}} cricket (playing for the Portsmouth Grammar School second eleven), football and fives. At Cirencester, he played football {{for the school}} first eleven in his first term. He quickly reached the school cricket first eleven, where he outperformed the other players and became captain in his second season; his headmaster, quickly spotting his potential, encouraged him. His first century was scored in a match against a parents' team from the school. In an inter-house match, he scored 365 not out, albeit against <b>very</b> <b>weak</b> bowling. These achievements brought him some local acclaim. Hammond enjoyed less success in the classroom; his marks were usually low, and he preferred to be out playing cricket.|$|E
5|$|Copernicium is {{the tenth}} and last {{member of the}} 6d series and is the {{heaviest}} group 12 element in the periodic table, below zinc, cadmium and mercury. It is predicted to differ significantly from the lighter group12 elements. The valence s-subshells of the group 12 elements and period 7 elements {{are expected to be}} relativistically contracted most strongly at copernicium. This and the closed-shell configuration of copernicium result in it probably being a very noble metal. Its metallic bonds should also be <b>very</b> <b>weak,</b> possibly making it extremely volatile, like the noble gases, and potentially making it gaseous at room temperature. However, it should be able to form metal–metal bonds with copper, palladium, platinum, silver, and gold; these bonds are predicted to be only about 15–20kJ/mol weaker than the analogous bonds with mercury.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, Cope began {{suffering}} from a gastrointestinal illness he said was cystitis. His wife cared for him in Philadelphia when she was able; at other times, Cope's university secretary, Anna Brown, tended to him. Cope at this time lived in his Pine Street museum and rested on a cot surrounded by his fossil finds. Cope often prescribed himself medications, including large amounts of morphine, belladonna, and formalin, a substance based on formaldehyde used to preserve specimens. Osborn was horrified by Cope's actions and made arrangements for surgery, but the plans were put on hold after a temporary improvement in Cope's health. Cope went to Virginia looking for fossils, became ill again, {{and returned to his}} home <b>very</b> <b>weak.</b> Osborn visited Cope on April 5, inquiring about Cope's health, but the sick paleontologist pressed his friend for his views on the origin of mammals. Word of Cope's illness spread, and he was visited by friends and colleagues; even in a feverish condition Cope delivered lectures from his bed. Cope died on April 12, 1897, 16 weeks short of his 57th birthday.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ay, {{that has}} been the stumbling-block with thousands; and yet it is, in truth, the <b>very</b> <b>weakest</b> part of the transatlantic side of the question. Of what avail is {{allegiance}} to the king, if parliament uses its power in a way to make American interests subservient to those of England? A great deal may be said, that is reasonable, in favor of kingly power; that I am ready enough to allow; but very little that renders one people subject to another. This thing called loyalty blinds men to facts, and substitutes a fancied for a real power. The question has been, whether England, by means of a parliament in which we have no representative, is to make laws for us or not; and not whether George III. is to be our sovereign, or whether we are to establish the sovereignty of the people."[4] ...|$|R
