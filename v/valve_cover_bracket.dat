50|$|Rules and {{regulations}} will change {{depending on the}} venue, but the basics remain the same: Competitors must construct a vehicle using a <b>valve</b> <b>cover</b> from a car's engine. Usually it must have four wheels. It can be decorated or modified within the rules set by the organizing body. The <b>valve</b> <b>cover</b> is powered by gravity. In a <b>valve</b> <b>cover</b> race, two or more racing <b>valve</b> <b>covers</b> are placed {{at the top of}} a specially constructed incline, which can be straight or curved. They are released at the same time and the first to cross a finish line at the bottom of the incline wins the race. Win lights or timers may be used to more accurately determine the winner of a race. <b>Valve</b> <b>cover</b> racing is often an event for children at car shows, although adult <b>valve</b> <b>cover</b> race events are also seen.|$|R

40|$|Project (M. S., Mechanical Engineering) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2011. Tier 4 Emission control versus {{conventional}} engine {{design is}} what every design engineer???s challenge {{to be dealt}} with. To design an engine to current market standards and requirements has become very intricate. In order to make such an explicit design which meets the standards, every component of the engine plays as a vital role. Every component design and development to current engineering standards pushes the envelope of manufacturability to new limits, which constraints {{the cost of the}} product across the ease of manufacturability of it. In consideration of the complexity to be attained, every component design contributes to the existence of a complete standardized engine, such as integrated <b>valve</b> <b>cover.</b> With the new tier 4 final regulations for engine manufactures, every new engine produced needs to meet those regulations. Caterpillar Inc regulated to produce tier 4 final compatible engines for the market. The new drive for development of new engines identified the objective of this project to design a new integrated breather <b>valve</b> <b>cover</b> for large power engines. <b>Valve</b> <b>Cover,</b> the noun by name explains it <b>covers</b> <b>valves.</b> In explanation to the definition of the <b>valve</b> <b>cover,</b> it covers the cylinder head mechanism;this is a high speed operating <b>valve.</b> <b>Valve</b> <b>Cover</b> not only covers the head mechanism and should also be persistent to pressure, stress and heat dissipated during the operation of the engine. <b>Valve</b> <b>cover</b> design initiates and explains the intricacy of a complete engine design. All the functional requirements of <b>valve</b> <b>cover</b> would be designed, analyzed and validated in this project, that drive the process of execution of the project to several phases of product development. Process identified for execution initiates with correct manufacturing technique, design intent and analysis. Caterpillar Inc. Engineering standards have been taken as a reference for defining all form fit functions. Pro engineering, Abaqus, Gambit and Fluent are the computer aided design tools used in this project for the execution of design intent. Identification of a proper manufacturing technique, processed execution of design requirements and analysis of concepts of design are validated across the requirements in this project with a justification of value added solutions are notified in the project. Conclusion on complete product design of integrated breather <b>valve</b> <b>cover</b> with optimal solution of all the available techniques in every aspect of design, development and real time production of <b>valve</b> <b>cover</b> have been discussed in this project,Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R

The 225-horsepower version had an 8.4:1 compression ratio. Later in the model year, a 235-horsepower version with 9.0:1 compression ratio became available. All 1956 Mercury engines had gold-painted blocks and heads. The 210-horsepower version had red <b>valve</b> <b>covers</b> and air cleaner, while the 225-horsepower version had blue <b>valve</b> <b>covers</b> and air cleaner. The 235-horsepower version had argent silver <b>valve</b> <b>covers</b> and air cleaner. A dealer-installed [...] "M 260" [...] engine kit was released in January 1956.

5000|$|For 1987, Chevrolet {{once again}} made some {{revisions}} to increase overall reliability, {{many of them}} borrowed from the TBI L03, which was to replace the LG4. The coil-in-cap HEI distributor was retired, and an all-new electronic distributor design was used. The intake manifold to head bolt pattern was redesigned to improve gasket integrity - four of the center intake manifold bolts were drilled at 72 degrees instead of 90 degrees for the cast iron cylinder heads. Changes to the <b>valve</b> <b>covers</b> were also made. [...] "ribbing" [...] {{was added to the}} top of the <b>valve</b> <b>covers</b> to increase surface area, acting as a heat sink. To improve intake gasket sealing, the mounting bolts were relocated to the <b>valve</b> <b>cover</b> centerline, placing all sealing pressure evenly upon the mounting flange perimeter... thus these became known as [...] "centerbolt valve covers", first introduced in 1985 on the LB4 4.3L V6 and the Corvette a year earlier (the aluminum cylinder heads used with the Vette were the first to have the centerbolt <b>valve</b> <b>covers).</b> Another improvement was utilization of a hydraulic lifter/roller camshaft on most '87 LG4's. Some early engines have lifter retainer provisions, but utilize the older, non-roller camshaft. 1987 would also be the last year for the LG4 production, however a run of LG4 engines was made to supplement the carry-over production for the 1988 Monte Carlo and the 1988 Chevrolet Caprice.|$|R
