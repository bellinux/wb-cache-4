30|$|To {{investigate}} {{the efficiency and}} stability of <b>Venezuela’s</b> oil-oriented economy, this paper applied entropy to the analysis. Based on this method, <b>Venezuela’s</b> oil-centered industry, inefficient regulatory system, and insensitive response to external changes are recognized as {{an increase in the}} country’s entropy. According to these facts, a dissipative structure model is constructed to analyze the efficiency and stability of the <b>Venezuela’s</b> economic system. The results show that financial assistants (fund flow), policy reform (policy flow), and advanced technology (technology flow) can perform as negative entropy inflows (NEIFs). These NEIFs will promote a series of influence and feedback reactions, which will contribute to recovering <b>Venezuela’s</b> system efficiency and stability.|$|R
30|$|As {{mentioned}} in this paper, entropy cannot directly reflect the stability of <b>Venezuela’s</b> economic system. But based on the analysis above, <b>Venezuela’s</b> entropy itself is obviously not in a stable state, which to some extent describes the stability of <b>Venezuela’s</b> economic system. <b>Venezuela’s</b> oil-oriented economics represents a series of systems that merely rely on resources, yet ignores that the prices of these resources are unstable. A global stability can only be achieved within a diverse, averaging, and internal motivated multifactored system. In such systems, healthy structure and various elements stick to their duties, obey their rules, seek self-adaption, and pursue the global optimization and stability together.|$|R
5|$|August 7–9, 1993 - Tropical Storm Bret {{moves across}} {{northern}} <b>Venezuela</b> and Colombia. In <b>Venezuela,</b> the storm drops at least 13.35inches (339mm) in Guanare. The rainfall causes mudslides, particularly {{near the city}} of Caracas, that cover many low-income housing units. Of the 173 deaths caused by Bret in <b>Venezuela,</b> most occur in the low-income areas near Caracas. Lack of preparation, including weather forecasters prematurely stating the worst of the storm is over, is part of the problem. In all, 10,000 are left homeless, and damaged totals $25million (1993USD, $37million 2008USD). In Colombia, Bret causes one death and one injury.|$|E

5|$|By 1895 <b>Venezuela</b> had had {{a dispute}} with the United Kingdom about the {{territory}} of Guayana Esequiba, which Britain claimed as part of British Guiana and <b>Venezuela</b> saw as Venezuelan territory, for over half a century. The territorial claims were originally those of the Spanish Empire (inherited by <b>Venezuela</b> after its independence in 1830) and of the Dutch Empire (inherited by the United Kingdom with the acquisition of the Dutch territories of Essequibo, Demerara and Berbice in 1814), having remained unsettled over previous centuries.
