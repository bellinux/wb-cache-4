50|$|The {{sintering}} of liquid-phase materials {{involves a}} fine-grained solid phase {{to create the}} needed capillary pressures proportional to its diameter and the liquid concentration must also create the required capillary pressure within range, else the process ceases. The vitrification rate is dependent upon the pore size, the viscosity and amount of liquid phase present leading to the viscosity of the overall composition, and the surface tension. Temperature dependence for densification controls the process because at higher temperatures viscosity decreases and increases liquid content. Therefore, when changes to the composition and processing are made, it will affect the <b>vitrification</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E

In this work, the measurement of hysteresis loops has been applied and combined with colour survey to characterise the magnetic properties of burnt clays and archaeological tiles. Four calcareous and non-calcareous clays, along with seventeen tile fragments excavated from the sites of the ancient Roman towns of Pompeii and Gravina di Puglia, in Southern Italy, are examined. The ferrimagnetic character of the clays, in general, enhances with increasing firing temperatures until <b>vitrification</b> <b>processes</b> occur (900 – 1000 C) dissolving iron oxides and dispersing the colour and magnetic properties they provide. High values of saturation magnetization are observed in clays with relevant calcareous content after firing above 900 C, which results in the formation of Ca-silicates able to delay the onset of the <b>vitrification</b> <b>processes.</b> Magnetic properties of the tiles have been evaluated in terms of the high coercivity (i. e. mainly ferrimagnetic) or low coercivity behaviour (i. e. including relevant paramagnetic and superparamagnetic contributions).
