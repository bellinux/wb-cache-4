5|$|As they hovered {{above the}} target, however, the first {{helicopter}} experienced a hazardous airflow condition {{known as a}} <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> state. This was aggravated by higher than expected air temperature ("a so-called 'hot and high' environment") and the high compound walls, which stopped the rotor downwash from diffusing. The helicopter's tail grazed one of the compound's walls, damaging its tail rotor, and the helicopter rolled onto its side. The pilot quickly buried the aircraft's nose {{to keep it from}} tipping over. None of the SEALs, crew and pilots on the helicopter were seriously injured in the soft crash landing, which ended with it pitched at a 45-degree angle resting against the wall. The other helicopter landed outside the compound and the SEALs scaled the walls to get inside. The SEALs advanced into the house, breaching walls and doors with explosives.|$|E

[...] A complete loss of power requires both engines to fail, as one engine can power both proprotors via interconnected drive shafts. Though <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> state (VRS) contributed to a deadly V-22 accident, flight testing found the aircraft to be less susceptible to the condition than conventional helicopters. A GAO report stated that the V-22 is [...] "less forgiving than conventional helicopters" [...] during this phenomenon. Several test flights to explore the V-22's VRS characteristics were canceled.

[...] Initially it was unclear if the accident was caused by enemy fire. [...] The loaded CV-22B was at its hovering capability limit, landing at night near Qalat (altitude approx. 5,000 feet) in brownout conditions, in turbulence due to the location in a gully. [...] The USAF investigation ruled out brownout conditions, enemy fire, and <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> state as causes.

2500|$|The {{cause was}} {{determined}} to be <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> state (VRS), a fundamental limitation on vertical descent which is common to helicopters.

[...] Another factor that may have triggered VRS was their operating in close proximity, which is believed to be a risk factor for VRS in helicopters. [...] Subsequent testing has shown that the V-22, and the tiltrotor in general, is less susceptible to VRS, the conditions are easily recognized by the pilots; recovery from VRS requires a more natural action by the pilot than recovery in helicopters, the altitude loss is significantly less than for helicopters, and, with sufficient altitude ( [...] or more), VRS recovery is relatively easy.|$|E
40|$|We compare {{dynamical}} and energetical stability {{criteria for}} <b>vortex</b> <b>rings.</b> It {{is argued that}} <b>vortex</b> <b>rings</b> will be intrinsically unstable against perturbations with short wavelengths below a critical wavelength, because the canonical vortex Hamiltonian is unbounded from below for these modes.

2500|$|Jellyfish {{have been}} proven {{to be the most}} energy {{efficient}} swimmers of all animals. They move through the water by radially expanding and contracting their bell-shaped bodies to push water behind them. They pause between the contraction and expansion to create two vortex rings. Muscles are used for the contraction of the body, which sheds the first vortex and pushes the animal forward, but the mesoglea is so elastic that the expansion is powered exclusively by relaxing the bell, which releases the energy stored from the contraction. By doing so, the second <b>vortex</b> <b>ring</b> rolls under it and begins to spin faster. This sucks in water which refills the bell and is pushed up against the centre of the body, giving it a secondary and [...] "free" [...] boost forward. The mechanism, called passive energy recapture, only works at low speeds and relatively small body sizes, allowing the animal to travel 30 percent farther on each swimming cycle.

40|$|The {{formation}} and pinch-off of non-axisymmetric <b>vortex</b> <b>rings</b> is considered experimentally. <b>Vortex</b> <b>rings</b> are generated using a non-circular pistonâ€“cylinder arrangement, {{and the resulting}} velocity fields are measured using digital particle image velocimetry. Three different nozzle geometries are considered: an elliptical nozzle with an aspect ratio of two, an elliptical nozzle with an aspect ratio of four and an oval nozzle constructed from tangent circular arcs. The formation of vortices from the three nozzles is analysed {{by means of the}} vorticity and circulation, as well as by investigation of the Lagrangian coherent structures in the flow.
