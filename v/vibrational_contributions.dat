50|$|The {{magnitudes}} of such secondary isotope effects at the α-carbon {{are largely}} {{determined by the}} Cα-H(D) vibrations. For an SN1 reaction, since the carbon is converted into an sp2 hybridized carbenium ion during the transition state for the rate-determining step {{with an increase in}} Cα-H(D) bond order, an inverse kinetic isotope effect would be expected if only the stretching vibrations were important. The observed large normal kinetic isotope effects are found to be caused by significant out-of-plane bending <b>vibrational</b> <b>contributions</b> when going from the reactants to the transition state of carbenium formation. For SN2 reactions, bending vibrations still play an important role for the kinetic isotope effect, but stretching <b>vibrational</b> <b>contributions</b> are of more comparable magnitude, and the resulting kinetic isotope effect may be normal or inverse depending on the specific contributions of the respective vibrations.|$|E
50|$|For the {{aforementioned}} nucleophilic substitution reactions, secondary hydrogen kinetic isotope effects at the α-carbon provide a direct means {{to distinguish between}} SN1 and SN2 reactions. It {{has been found that}} SN1 reactions typically lead to large secondary kinetic isotope effects, approaching to their theoretical maximum at about 1.22, while SN2 reactions typically yield kinetic isotope effects that are very close to or less than unity. Kinetic isotope effects that are greater than 1 are referred to as normal kinetic isotope effects, while kinetic isotope effects that are less than one are referred to as inverse kinetic isotope effects. In general, smaller force constants in the transition state are expected to yield a normal kinetic isotope effect, and larger force constants in the transition state are expected to yield an inverse kinetic isotope effect when stretching <b>vibrational</b> <b>contributions</b> dominate the kinetic isotope effect.|$|E

In particular, we have studied both the nuclear relaxation and the <b>vibrational</b> <b>contributions</b> to the static molecular electrical properties, the vibrational Stark effect (VSE) and the vibrational intensity effect (VIE). From a mathematical point of view, when a static and uniform electric field is applied to a molecule, the energy of this system can be {{expressed in terms of}} a double power series with respect to the bond length and to the field strength. From the power series expansion of the potential energy, field-dependent expressions for the equilibrium geometry, for the potential energy and for the force constant are obtained. The nuclear relaxation and <b>vibrational</b> <b>contributions</b> to the molecular electrical properties are analyzed in terms of the derivatives of the electronic molecular properties. In general, the results presented show that accurate inclusion of the correlation energy and large basis sets are needed to calculate the molecular electrical properties and their derivatives with respect to either nuclear displacements or/and field strength. With respect to experimental data, the calculated power series coefficients are overestimated by the SCF, CISD, and QCISD methods.

40|$|The Brillouin peak {{appears in}} the dynamic {{structure}} factor S(q,w), and the dispersion curve is the Brillouin peak frequency as function of q. The theoretical function underlying S(q,w) is the density autocorrelation function F(q,t). A broadly successful description of time correlation functions is provided by mode coupling theory, which expresses F(q,t) in terms of processes through which the density fluctuations decay. In contrast, vibration-transit (V-T) theory is a Hamiltonian formulation of monatomic liquid dynamics in which the motion consists of vibrations within a many-particle random valley, interspersed with nearly instantaneous transits between such valleys.

Recently, analysis of the mean square displacement (MSD) resolved a crossover behavior that was not observed in the SISF study. Our purpose here is to apply the more accurate MSD calibration to the SISF, and assess the results.

We find that any deviation from charge neutrality produces complex rearrangements of atomic positions and electronic distribution, and consequent phase transitions.

Such accumulation is accounted by the d 3 z 2 -r 2 orbital of the transition metal and it is regulated by the Pt 2 g,eg orbital polarization. The latter, in turn, determines {{the frequency of the}} phonon modes related to the intrisic friction through non-trivial electro-vibrational coupling.
