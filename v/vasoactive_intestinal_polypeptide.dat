40|$|Voluntary {{exercise}} {{is the traditional}} way of improving performance {{of the human body}} in both the healthy and unhealthy states. Physiological responses to voluntary exercise are well documented. It benefits the functions of bone, joints, connective tissue, and muscle. In recent years, research has shown that neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) simulates voluntary exercise in many ways. Generically, NMES can perform three major functions: suppression of pain, improve healing of soft tissues, and produce muscle contractions. Low frequency NMES may gate or disrupt the sensory input to the central nervous system which results in masking or control of pain. At the same time NMES may contribute to the activation of endorphins, serotonin, <b>vasoactive</b> <b>intestinal</b> <b>polypeptides,</b> and ACTH which control pain and may even cause improved athletic performances. Soft tissue conditions such as wounds and inflammations have responded very favorably to NMES. NMES of various amplitudes can induce muscle contractions ranging from weak to intense levels. NMES seems to have made its greatest gains in rehabilitation where directed muscle contractions may improve joint ranges of motion correct joint contractures that result from shortening muscles; control abnormal movements through facilitating recruitment or excitation into the alpha motoneuron in orthopedically, neurologically, or healthy subjects with intense sensory, kinesthetic, and proprioceptive information; provide a conservative approach to management of spasticity in neurological patients; by stimulation of the antagonist muscle to a spastic muscle stimulation of the agonist muscle, and sensory habituation; serve as an orthotic substitute to conventional bracing used with stroke patients in lieu of dorsiflexor muscles in preventing step page gait and for shoulder muscles to maintain glenohumeral alignment to prevent subluxation; and of course NMES is used in maintaining or improving the performance or torque producing capability of muscle. NMES in exercise training is our major concern...|$|R

In this model, coinjection of <b>vasoactive</b> <b>intestinal</b> peptide prevents white matter lesions. In the present study, co{{administration of}} ibotenate, <b>vasoactive</b> <b>intestinal</b> peptide, and selective transduction inhibitors showed that protein kinase C and mitogen-associated protein kinase pathways were critical for neuroprotection. In vivo and in vitro immunocytochemistry revealed that <b>vasoactive</b> <b>intestinal</b> peptide activated protein kinase C in astrocytes and neurons, and mitogen-associated protein kinase in neurons. In vitro neuronal transduction activation was indirect and required medium conditioned by astrocytes in which protein kinase C had been activated by <b>vasoactive</b> <b>intestinal</b> peptide. Although <b>vasoactive</b> <b>intestinal</b> peptide did not prevent the initial in vivo appearance of white matter lesion, it promoted a secondary repair of this lesion with axonal regrowth. Through protein kinase C activation, <b>vasoactive</b> <b>intestinal</b> peptide also prevented ibotenate-induced white matter astrocyte death.

40|$|The {{sympathetic}} {{nervous system}} controls bone remodeling by regulating bone formation and resorption. How nerves and bone cells influence each other remains elusive. Here we modulated the content or activity of the neuropeptide <b>Vasoactive</b> <b>Intestinal</b> Peptide to investigate nerve-bone cell interplays in the mandible periosteum by assessing factors involved in nerve and bone behaviors. Young adult rats were chemically sympathectomized or treated with <b>Vasoactive</b> <b>Intestinal</b> Peptide or <b>Vasoactive</b> <b>Intestinal</b> Peptide 10 - 28, a receptor antagonist. Sympathectomy depleted the osteogenic layer of the periosteum in neurotrophic proNerve Growth Factor and neurorepulsive semaphorin 3 a; sensory Calcitonin-Gene Related Peptide-positive fibers invaded this layer physiologically devoid of sensory fibers. In the periosteum non-osteogenic layer, sympathectomy activated mast cells to release mature Nerve Growth Factor while Calcitonin-Gene Related Peptide-positive fibers increased. <b>Vasoactive</b> <b>Intestinal</b> Peptide treatment reversed sympathectomy effects. Treating intact animals with <b>Vasoactive</b> <b>Intestinal</b> Peptide increased proNerve Growth Factor expression and stabilized mast cells. <b>Vasoactive</b> <b>Intestinal</b> Peptide 10 - 28 treatment mimicked sympathectomy effects.

40|$|<b>Vasoactive</b> <b>intestinal</b> peptide {{has been}} {{suggested}} to play some roles in inflammatory dermatoses such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. The {{aim of this study}} is to clarify the precise mechanisms of how <b>vasoactive</b> <b>intestinal</b> peptide is implicated in the pathogenesis of these disorders. We investigated the expression of <b>vasoactive</b> <b>intestinal</b> peptide and its receptors in normal human fibroblasts and keratinocytes, as well as in a human epidermal keratinocyte cell line DJM- 1, using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and northern blotting. Type I VIP receptor mRNA was expressed in normal human keratinocytes and DJM- 1 cells, and the latter also expressed type II receptor in lesser amounts. Neither type I nor type II VIP receptor mRNA was detected in fibroblasts, and <b>vasoactive</b> <b>intestinal</b> peptide transcript was not found in any cells examined. Type I VIP receptor mRNA was upregulated by Th 1 cytokines (interferon-γ), Th 2 cytokines (interleukin- 4), and tumor necrosis factor α, as well as <b>vasoactive</b> <b>intestinal</b> peptide itself, suggesting the presence of an autoregulatory loop. <b>Vasoactive</b> <b>intestinal</b> peptide increased cAMP production and cell proliferation of DJM- 1 cells, and also induced the production of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin- 6, interleukin- 8, and RANTES. The production of cAMP and cytokines was abrogated by a type I VIP receptor selective antagonist, indicating that type I receptor mediates these effects. Overall, these results suggest that upregulation of <b>vasoactive</b> <b>intestinal</b> peptide receptors by cytokines from inflammatory cells in the dermis enhances the proliferation and cytokine production of keratinocytes in response to <b>vasoactive</b> <b>intestinal</b> peptide from nerve endings. This cytokine network around keratinocytes may be involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory dermatoses...|$|R
50|$|Vasoactive {{intestinal}} peptide, {{also known}} as <b>vasoactive</b> <b>intestinal</b> <b>polypeptide</b> or VIP, is a peptide hormone that is vasoactive in the intestine. VIP is a peptide of 28 amino acid residues that belongs to a glucagon/secretin superfamily, the ligand of class II G protein-coupled receptors.VIP is produced in many tissues of vertebrates including the gut, pancreas, and suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus in the brain. VIP stimulates contractility in the heart, causes vasodilation, increases glycogenolysis, lowers arterial blood pressure and relaxes the smooth muscle of trachea, stomach and gall bladder. In humans, the vasoactive intestinal peptide is encoded by the VIP gene.|$|E
50|$|A severe {{secretory}} diarrhea {{can develop}} and cause fluid and electrolyte depletion with non-β-cell tumors. This complex, {{referred to as}} the watery diarrhea, hypokalemia and achlorhydria syndrome (VIPoma) has been ascribed to <b>vasoactive</b> <b>intestinal</b> <b>polypeptide,</b> although other intestinal hormones or secretagogues (including prostaglandins) may contribute. Hypersecretion of glucagon, somatostatin, chromogranin, or calcitonin, ectopic secretion of ACTH resulting in Cushing's syndrome, and hypersecretion of somatotropin-releasing hormone (causing acromegaly) sometimes occur in non-β-cell tumors.

50|$|Through {{his work}} circa 1988, Moore {{developed}} an organizational {{model for the}} SCN in all mammals. His design described two anatomically and functionally distinct subdivisions called the core and shell. This was determined by a comparative anatomy of the SCN in a mouse, guinea pig, cat, and opossum with immunohistochemistry studies that identified segregation of afferents and distinct neuropeptides between the core and shell. The core is a division lying above the optic chiasm composed of <b>vasoactive</b> <b>intestinal</b> <b>polypeptide</b> (VIP)-producing neurons that receive RHT and secondary visual inputs. The shell surrounds the core and is composed of vasopressin-producing neurons and receives input from the hypothalamus, brainstem, and basal forebrain. These subdivisions function as individual pacemakers, and their neurochemical organization reflects intercellular communication that posit potential coupling mechanisms.|$|E
40|$|<b>Vasoactive</b> <b>intestinal</b> peptide causes bronchodilatation {{when given}} {{intravenously}} but is less effective in both animals and man when given by inhalation. This difference {{may be due}} to poor transit of the peptide across the bronchial epithelium. To test this hypothesis pulmonary clearance of radiolabelled <b>vasoactive</b> <b>intestinal</b> peptide was measured in Sprague Dawley rats and compared with that of pertechnetate (TcO 4 -) and diethylene triamine pentaacetate (DTPA). Despite a molecular weight (MW) of 3450, iodinated <b>vasoactive</b> <b>intestinal</b> peptide was cleared rapidly from the lungs, with a mean half time (t 1 / 2) of 19 minutes after an initial slower phase. This compares with a t 1 / 2 of 10 minutes with TcO 4 - (MW 163) and a t 1 / 2 of 158 minutes with DTPA (MW 492). The possibility that <b>vasoactive</b> <b>intestinal</b> peptide mediates a non-specific increase in permeability was discounted {{by the fact that the}} combination of <b>vasoactive</b> <b>intestinal</b> peptide and DTPA did not alter DTPA clearance significantly. Chromatography and radioimmunoassay of blood taken after intratracheal administration of <b>vasoactive</b> <b>intestinal</b> peptide demonstrated a metabolite but no unchanged peptide. An intravenous injection of the peptide disappeared on first pass through the lung. It is concluded that inhaled <b>vasoactive</b> <b>intestinal</b> peptide lacks efficacy as a bronchodilator not because of slow diffusion to airway smooth muscle but because it is metabolised at an early stage of its passage through the respiratory epithelium...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} hepatic transit on {{concentrations}} of synthetic cyclic (ovine) somatostatin and of highly purified (porcine) <b>vasoactive</b> <b>intestinal</b> peptide were studied in five conscious dogs prepared with indwelling portal catheters. The peptides were infused via peripheral vein catheters or the portal catheters for 40 minutes at actual integrated doses of 2. 8 pmol/kg/min for <b>vasoactive</b> <b>intestinal</b> peptide an 8. 2 pmol/kg/min for somatostatin. Specific radioimmunoassays {{were used for}} the measurement of the circulating peptides. As estimated from the plateau peptide concentrations achieved a hindleg vein during the portal and the peripheral infusions, the transhepatic loss of immunoreactive <b>vasoactive</b> <b>intestinal</b> peptide was 72. 9 +/- 2. 1 %, against 27. 5 +/- 12. 5 % for somatostatin. For the given doses of peptides infused systematically, the half-life, metabolic clearance rate, and distribution volume were, respectively, 1. 80 +/- 0. 1 minutes, 39. 3 +/- 5. 2 ml/kg/min, and 103. 7 +/- 14. 8 ml/kg for <b>vasoactive</b> <b>intestinal</b> peptide, and 1. 0 +/- 0. 2 minutes, 95. 2 +/- 12. 5 ml/kg/min, and 114. 7 +/- 6. 0 ml/kg for somatostatin. These results indicate that (ovine) somatostatin and (porcine) <b>vasoactive</b> <b>intestinal</b> peptide are both readily cleared from plasma in dogs. In the present experimental conditions, <b>vasoactive</b> <b>intestinal</b> peptide, but not somatostatin, was rapidly altered through hepatic transit so that it escaped recognition by the assay system...|$|R
50|$|Lim-1 (Lhx1) {{functions}} as a transcription factor necessary for regulating the production of coupling factors required for proper communication between the neurons located {{in the part of}} the brain responsible for regulation of circadian rhythms called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). In mouse studies where Lim-1 transcription was restricted at some point during development in utero, the individual units within the subject’s molecular clock functioned properly but were unable to work together. Communication of these units is required to match their release of clock proteins which begin a transcription cascade of many other proteins that produce functional responses in tissues. The cyclic pattern of these responses is due to the feedback of the clock proteins and consequent changes to this transcription cascade. Reduced Lim-1 expression leads to inadequate levels of proteins such as <b>Vasoactive</b> <b>Intestinal</b> <b>Polypeptide</b> (VIP) that work to produce the neuron coordination required for a regulated circadian rhythm. The lack of such coupling factors causes the circadian clock to not function properly because the units within the SCN cannot match their release of clock proteins, and therefore their transcriptional cascades of proteins that cause changes in arousal do not align.|$|E

40|$|<b>Vasoactive</b> <b>intestinal</b> <b>polypeptide,</b> a {{neurotransmitter}} peptide {{detected in}} animal and human hearts, {{has been found}} in nerves of coronary arteries. To determine the amount and distribution of <b>vasoactive</b> <b>intestinal</b> <b>polypeptide</b> in the large coronary vessels and its possible participation in coronary vasoregulation, two groups of animals were studied. In the first group, 11 anesthetized dogs were sacrificed to collect three (1 cm) segments along the circumflex and left anterior descending coronary arteries. These segments represented proximal (I), middle (II) and distal (III) portions of the two arteries. Concentrations (ng/g) of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-like immunoreactive substance were determined by radioimmunoassay. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-like immunoreactivity was present in the left anterior descending (I = 7. 28 ± 1. 65, II = 3. 74 ± 0. 57, III = 2. 29 ± 0. 53) and circumflex (I = 4. 16 ± 1. 52, II = 4. 58 ± 1. 13, III = 4. 00 ± 0. 81) coronary arteries. The difference in vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-like immunoreactivity among epicardial segments of the anterior descending artery was significant, but {{there was no significant difference}} among segments of the circumflex coronary artery. In the second group (eight closed chest anesthetized dogs), the effects of <b>vasoactive</b> <b>intestinal</b> <b>polypeptide</b> intracoronary infusion on epicardial coronary constriction were examined at rest and with the artery constricted by serotonin. Left anterior descending (segments I, II and III) artery responses (% area change) to <b>vasoactive</b> <b>intestinal</b> <b>polypeptide</b> and <b>vasoactive</b> <b>intestinal</b> <b>polypeptide</b> plus serotonin were examined using quantitative coronary angiography. <b>Vasoactive</b> <b>intestinal</b> <b>polypeptide</b> infusion resulted in significant vasodilation in all the segments (I, II and III) of the left anterior descending artery.

40|$|<b>Vasoactive</b> <b>intestinal</b> peptide, {{one of the}} {{putative}} neurotransmitters of non-adrenergic inhibitory nerves in human airways, is a potent relaxant of human airways in vitro.

The effect on airway function of infused <b>vasoactive</b> <b>intestinal</b> peptide was studied in normal subjects, who readily develop bronchodilation in response to a beta agonist. Separate experiments were designed to assess whether there is any synergy between this peptide and the beta agonist isoprenaline. Incremental doses of 1, 3, and 6 pmol/kg/min of <b>vasoactive</b> <b>intestinal</b> peptide were infused for 15 minutes.
