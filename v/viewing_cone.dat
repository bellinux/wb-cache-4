50|$|A <b>viewing</b> <b>cone</b> {{can also}} result from {{measurements}} (versus viewing direction) {{carried out with}} a certain display device under specified operating conditions. Then the <b>viewing</b> <b>cone</b> is obtained by limiting values of a visual quantity (e.g. contrast) which for a certain application is required to be above e.g. 10 (compare e.g. Vesa FPDM2 307-4 Viewing-cone thresholds).

40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} a simple {{extension}} to existing compressive multilayer light field displays that greatly extends their {{field of view}} and depth of field. Rather than optimizing these displays to create a moderately narrow field of view {{at the center of}} the display, we constrain optimization to create narrow <b>view</b> <b>cones</b> that are directed to the viewer’s eyes, allowing the available display bandwidth to be utilized more efficiently. These narrow <b>view</b> <b>cones</b> follow the viewer, creating a wide apparent field of view. Imagery is also recalculated for the viewer’s exact position, creating a greater depth of field. The <b>view</b> <b>cones</b> can be scaled to match the positional error and latency of the tracking system. Using more efficient optimization and commodity tracking hardware and software, we demonstrate a real-time, glasses-free 3 D display that offers a 110 x 45 degree field of view. 1...|$|R

5000|$|Recent {{experiments}} [...] {{have shown}} that the acceptable <b>viewing</b> <b>cone</b> is rather determined by decrease of luminance and change of chromaticity than by the decrease of contrast. Comprehensive comparisons between experiments and measurements have been carried out in order to identify the quantities and the corresponding limiting values that define the apparent <b>viewing</b> <b>cone</b> for television screens with LCDs and PDPs. One of the results is that [...] "the luminance at intermediate-to-high gray levels determines the viewingdirection dependent quality and not the contrast ratio." [...] This is found to be in agreement with other research results that [...] "find a low correlation between contrast ratio and visual assessment value". Furthermore, [...] "not only the chromaticity coordinates of the primaries, but even more those of the white point play an important role and need to be included in a viewing direction dependent metric". The authors conclude that [...] "for LCDs, this new metric results in a <b>viewing</b> <b>cone,</b> which is on the order of 70°-90° (subtended angle), and thus, considerably lower than what is usually specified based on a minimum contrast of 10. For PDPs, this new metric yields the same viewing direction range as the present specification that uses a luminance decrease to 50%". In the terminology as introduced above (and illustrated in Figure 2) a <b>viewing</b> <b>cone</b> of 70°-90° subtended angle means (for a rotationally symmetric <b>viewing</b> <b>cone)</b> a maximum angle of inclination of 35°-45°.|$|E

50|$|CRT (cathode-ray tube): The {{most common}} screens were direct-view CRTs {{for up to}} roughly 100 cm (40 inch) (in 4:3 ratio) and 115 cm (45 inch) (in 16:9 ratio) diagonals.

A typical NTSC broadcast signal's visible portion has an equivalent resolution of 449 x 483 rectangular pixels. It actually could be slightly higher than that, but the vertical blanking interval (VBI), allows time for magnetic beam scanning retrace in affordable CRT-equipped television receivers.

40|$|We {{present a}} new method for {{rendering}} novel images of flexible 3 D objects {{from a small}} number of example images in correspondence. The strength of the method is the ability to synthesize images whose viewing position is significantly far away from the <b>viewing</b> <b>cone</b> of the example images ("view extrapolation"), yet without ever modeling the 3 D structure of the scene. The method relies on synthesizing a chain of "trilinear tensors" that governs the warping function from the example images to the novel image, together with a multi-dimensional interpolation function that synthesizes the non-rigid motions of the viewed object from the virtual camera position. We show that two closely spaced example images alone are sufficient in practice to synthesize a significant <b>viewing</b> <b>cone,</b> thus demonstrating the ability of representing an object by {{a relatively small number of}} model images [...] - for the purpose of cheap and fast viewers that can run on standard hardware...|$|E
40|$|When {{striving for}} maximum {{efficiencies}} in solar thermal central receiver systems (CRS) {{the use of}} gas turbines with bottoming cycles is inevitable. Pressurized volumetric receivers have proven their feasibility and good performance, and their integration into gas turbine cycles has been demonstrated. One disadvantage of this system is the necessity to use secondary concentrators. The sunlight has to be concentrated into the relatively small glass windows of the receiver, {{which leads to a}} limited <b>view</b> <b>cone.</b> This means that of all the possible heliostat positions around the tower, only those within the ellipse, resulting from the section boundary of the <b>view</b> <b>cone</b> with the ground plane, are usable. For small systems, for which tower costs are small, the resulting heliostat field layout is similar, with or without secondary concentrator. For large systems, which are more cost-effective, tower costs become significant, and the losses due to atmospheric attenuation and spillage dominate over the cosine losses. Thus, the purely North-oriented fields become increasingly sub-optimal. This article shall demonstrate at what power levels this problem can be alleviated by not using a single, North-oriented aperture, but up to six apertures—each of them associated with a separate heliostat field...|$|R
