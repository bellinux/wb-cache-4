On the other hand, such virtualized systems are now targets for attacks. We propose an intrusion detection architecture for virtualized systems, and discuss some of the security issues that arise. We argue that a weak spot of such systems is domain zero administration, which is left entirely under the administrator’s responsibility, and is in particular vulnerable to trojans. To avert some of the risks, we propose to install a role-based access control model with possible role delegation, and to describe all undesired activity flows through simple temporal formulas. We show how the latter are compiled into Orchids rules, via a fragment of linear temporal logic, through a generalization of the so-called history <b>variable</b> <b>mechanism.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|As XML spreads {{to various}} {{application}} domains, transformation tasks on XML documents are accomplished by an ever {{increasing number of}} non-programmers. In this respect, rather than providing just a collection of basic operations via a library in a special purpose language, {{it is useful to}} provide a more intuitive, rule-based approach to XML transformation. The rule-based approach requires pattern-matching for identifying parts of the document to be processed. As XML document processing is basically a subarea of tree processing for which the functional programming style is very natural, we choose SML as implementation language. The functional style implies a processing model in which navigation is possible only to subtrees of a tree. This restriction can be compensated by using a tree pattern-matcher able to relate to ancestors, successors, as well as to siblings of a match. On top of the powerful fxgrep XML pattern-matcher, we build fxt, a transformation tool for XML documents.

40|$|Phase {{variable}} expression, {{mediated by}} high frequency reversible {{changes in the}} length of simple sequence repeats, facilitates adaptation of bacterial populations to changing environments and is frequently important in bacterial virulence. Here we elucidate a novel phase <b>variable</b> <b>mechanism</b> for NadA expression, an adhesin and invasin of Neisseria meningitidis. The NadR repressor protein binds to operators flanking the phase variable tract of the nadA promoter gene and contributes to the differential expression levels of phase variant promoters with different numbers of repeats, likely due to different spacing between operators. It is shown that IHF binds between these operators, and may permit looping of the promoter, allowing interaction of NadR at operators located distally or overlapping the promoter. The 4 -hydroxyphenylacetic acid, a metabolite of aromatic amino acid catabolism that is secreted in saliva, induces nadA expression by inhibiting the DNA binding activity of the NadR repressor. When induced, only minor differences are evident between NadR-independent transcription levels of promoter phase variants, which are likely due to differential RNA polymerase contacts leading to altered promoter activity. These results suggest that NadA expression is under both stochastic and tight environmental-sensing regulatory control, and both regulations are mediated by the NadR repressor that and may be induced during colonization of the oropharynx where it {{plays a major role}} in the successful adhesion and invasion of the mucosa. Hence, simple sequence repeats in promoter regions may be a strategy used by host-adapted bacterial pathogens to randomly switch between expression states that may nonetheless still be induced by appropriate niche-specific signals...|$|E
40|$|The quasi-steady, spherically {{symmetric}} combustion of multicomponent isolated fuel droplets {{has been}} modeled using modified Shvab-Zeldovich <b>variable</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Newly developed modified Shvab-Zeldovich equations {{have been used}} to describe the gas phase reactions. Vapor-liquid equilibrium model has been applied to describe the phase change at the droplet surface. Constant gas phase specific heats are assumed. The liquid phase is assumed to be of uniform composition and temperature. Radiative heat transfer between the droplet and surroundings is neglected. The results of evaporation of gasoline with discrete composition of hydrocarbons have been presented. The evaporation rates seem to follow the pattern of volatility differentials. The evaporation rate constant was obtained as 0. 344 mm 2 /sec which compared well with the unsteady results of Reitz et al. The total evaporation time of the droplet at an ambience of 1000 K was estimated to be around 0. 63 seconds. Next, the results of evaporation of representative diesel fuels have been compared with previously reported experimental data. The previous experiments showed sufficient liquid phase diffusional resistance in the droplet. Numerical results are consistent with the qualitative behavior of the experiments. The quantitative deviation during the vaporization process {{can be attributed to the}} diffusion time inside the droplet which is unaccounted for in the model. Transient evaporation results have also been presented for the representative diesel droplets. The droplet temperature profile indicates that the droplet temperature does not reach an instantaneous steady state as in the case of single-component evaporation. To perform similar combustion calculations for multicomponent fuel droplets, no simple model existed prior to this work. Accordingly, a new simplified approximate mechanism for multicomponent combustion of fuel droplets has been developed and validated against several independent data sets. The new mechanism is simple enough to be used for computational studies of multicomponent droplets. The new modified Shvab-Zeldovich mechanism for multicomponent droplet combustion has been used to model the combustion characteristics of a binary alcohol-alkane droplet and validated against experimental data. Burn rate for the binary droplet of octanol-undecane was estimated to be 1. 17 mm 2 /sec in good concurrence with the experimental value of 0. 952 mm 2 /sec obtained by Law and Law. The model has then been used to evaluate the combustion characteristics of diesel fuels assuming only gas phase reactions. Flame sheet approximation has been invoked in the formulation of the model...|$|E

However, reflected masses of a SEA and <b>variable</b> structure parallel <b>mechanism</b> linked with a compliant actuator {{result in a}} potentially unstable coupled mechanical oscillator, {{which has not been}} addressed in previous studies. Methods The aim of this paper was to investigate through simulation, experimentation and theoretical analysis the necessary conditions that guarantee stability and passivity of a haptic device (based on a <b>variable</b> structure parallel <b>mechanism</b> driven by SEA actuators) when in contact with a human. We have analyzed an equivalent mechanical system where a dissipative element, a mechanical damper was placed in parallel to a spring in SEA. Results The theoretical analysis yielded necessary conditions relating the damping coefficient, spring stiffness, both reflected masses, controller's gain and desired virtual impedance that needs to be fulfilled in order to obtain stable and passive behavior of the device when in contact with a human. The validity of the derived passivity conditions were confirmed in simulations and experimentally.

Methods A simulation study of a linear regression with a response Y and two predictors X 1 and X 2 was performed on data with n = 50, 100 and 200 using complete cases or multiple imputation with 0, 10, 20, 40 and 80 auxiliary <b>variables.</b> <b>Mechanisms</b> of missingness were either 100 % MCAR or 50 % MAR + 50 % MCAR. Auxiliary variables had low (r=. 10) vs. moderate correlations (r=. 50) with X’s and Y. Results The inclusion of auxiliary variables can improve a multiple imputation model. However, inclusion of too many variables leads to downward bias of regression coefficients and decreases precision. When the correlations are low, inclusion of auxiliary variables is not useful.
