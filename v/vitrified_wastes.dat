40|$|International audienceManagement of {{domestic}} wastes often relies on incineration, {{a process that}} eliminates large amount of wastes but also produces toxic residues that concentrate heavy metals. Those hazardous secondary wastes require specific treatment. Vitrification {{is seen as a}} powerful way to stabilise them. However, concern exists about the long term behaviour of these glass wastes and the potential release of toxic species into the environment. The answers will come with further investigation into the physico-chemical evolution of the <b>vitrified</b> <b>wastes</b> and the mobility of hazardous elements within the matrix with appropriate analytical methods. Laser ablation coupled with inductively coupled mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) is a challenging technique for the chemical analysis of trace elements in solid materials. This paper presents an evaluation of the potential of LA-ICP-MS for macro and microanalysis of trace metals in domestic <b>vitrified</b> <b>wastes</b> with regards to other physical analytical techniques of solids such as scanning electronprobe X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDXS). Two typical samples, vitreous and crystallized, are used to compare the analytical performances of the two techniques. SEM-EDXS was used for mineralogical characterisation and chemical analysis of the mineralogical phases. Relative micro-analysis and bulk quantitative analysis of 30 major, minor and trace elements was performed by LA-ICP-MS: precision was between 10 and 20 % for most elements and quantitative analysis proved possible with an accuracy of 20 % and relative detection limits of 0. 1 mg kg- 1...|$|E

Several Fe sites have been observed through the deconvolution of Mössbauer spectra, representing the Fe 2 + oxidation state and tetrahedrally and octahedrally coordinated Fe 3 + ions. The interdependency of iron redox and iron coordination is demonstrated, and suggests that conversion of tetrahedral Fe 3 + to octahedral Fe 2 + preferentially occurs upon increasing Fe 2 +/ΣFe. For Fe 2 +/ΣFe= 0 · 30 - 0 · 89, the abundance of octahedrally coordinated Fe 3 + remains approximately constant whilst tetrahedrally coordinated Fe 3 + exhibits a linear decrease in its abundance with increasing Fe 2 +/ΣFe ratio...|$|E
40|$|The current {{baseline}} for the conditioning of most UK intermediate-level {{radioactive waste}} (ILW) is immobilisation using cement. However, vitrification of some UK ILW is being considered as an alternative. One {{option for the}} disposal of the resulting vitrified ILW would be to place it in a geological disposal facility in a high-pH environment with cemented ILW and a cement-based backfill. Therefore, the potential effects of such a high pH (∼ 12. 5), calcium-rich cement-based environment on the dissolution behaviour of simulant ILW glasses have been studied using the product consistency test (PCT). Three non-radioactive waste compositions were assessed: a laboratory simulant ILW vitrified in a borosilicate glass and two full-scale simulant vitrified products (a slag containing simulant plutonium-contaminated material and Magnox sludge; and a glass containing clinoptilolite). Powdered samples were leached in saturated Ca(OH) 2 solutions for up to 42 days at temperatures between 30 and 90 °C. In general the rates of dissolution were lower than expected at such a high pH compared to studies in the literature under alkaline conditions. In contrast to the typical dissolution behaviour of high level waste (HLW) glasses, dissolution of the simulant borosilicate ILW glass was initially slow, followed by a period of faster boron and alkali metal release. The saturation/residual regime was not reached within experimental timescales. The rate of dissolution {{during the period of}} faster release increased with increasing temperature; the activation energy for this stage of dissolution was calculated to be 47 ± 2 kJ mol- 1 based on boron release. The two full-scale simulant glasses, which contained negligible boric oxide, exhibited conventional static dissolution profiles, and entered the residual rate regime after 7 - 14 days at 50 °C. The greater durability of the full-scale simulants is thought to be due to the greater content of network-forming oxides in these glasses compared to the borosilicate glass. It is also suggested that the formation of calcium borates may delay initial hydration of the borosilicate glass in a similar manner to the retardation of cement hydration by soluble borates. More generally, the formation of calcium- and magnesium-containing precipitates {{on the surface of the}} <b>vitrified</b> <b>wastes,</b> and agglomeration of the powder, appeared to act to reduce the dissolution rate. Overall these results suggest that calcium has an important role in the long-term durability of <b>vitrified</b> <b>wastes</b> at high pH...|$|E
40|$|Glass is {{used for}} the {{vitrification}} of high level waste that results from the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. A better understanding of the structure of <b>vitrified</b> <b>wastes</b> may lead to insights into the observed compositional flexibility. It is also the starting point for studies of the self-irradiation behaviour of glasses under long-term repository conditions. Appropriate models need to be employed for the study of glasses when using molecular dynamics. The nature of nuclear waste necessitates an accurate structure prediction for a range of compositions and parameters. To this end, the suitability of established potential sets have been compared. The established potential models were used to investigate the structure of zinc containing sodium silicate glass. Once validated, this structure was used to investigate structural changes observed during simulated self-irradiation, where significant changes were observed on the atomic scale. This will provide the basis for further studies of radiation damage, glass-crystal interfaces and damage across glass-crystal interfaces. In order to further enhance the understanding of potential models, a novel glass of composition LiAlF 4 has been successfully described, and may become relevant in the future as a thin film coating in Li-ion batteries.

40|$|Experiments {{have been}} {{performed}} to test the stability of <b>vitrified</b> municipal solid <b>waste</b> (MSW) incinerator bottom ash under the presence of bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and plants (corn). The substratum used for the plant growth was a humus-rich soil mixed with <b>vitrified</b> <b>waste.</b> For the first time, information on the stability of waste glasses {{in the presence of}} bacteria and plants is given. Results show that inoculated plant samples contained always about two times higher lanthanide and actinide element concentrations. Bacteria support the element transfer since plants growing in inoculated environment developed a smaller root system but have higher trace element concentrations. Compared with the substratum, plants are light rare earth element (LREE) enriched. The vitrified bottom ash has to some extent been corroded by bacteria and plant activities as indicated by the presence of Nd (REE) and Sr from the <b>vitrified</b> <b>waste</b> in the plants. (87) Sr/(86) Sr and (143) Nd/(144) Nd isotope ratios of plants and soil components allow the identification of the corroded soil components and confirm that bacteria accelerate the assimilation of elements from the vitrified bottom ash.

40|$|This report {{analyzes}} {{the feasibility of}} emplacing DOE-owned defense nuclear waste from weapons production into a permanent borehole repository drilled ~ 4 km into granite basement rock. Two canister options were analyzed throughout the report: the canister currently used by the DOE for <b>vitrified</b> defense <b>waste</b> and a reference canister with a smaller diameter. In a thermal analysis, the maximum temperatures attained by the rock surrounding the waste, waste form, canister, liner, and gaps during the post-emplacement period were calculated. From this data, simple analytic equations were formed {{that can be used}} to calculate the maximum temperature differences for both defense waste and spent fuel when one does not want to repeat the analysis. Canister corrosion and waste form dissolution analyses were performed using Pourbaix diagrams. Finally, the cost and time for drilling the borehole and emplacing the defense waste were calculated. The temperature change in the granite is 15. 1 °C for the reference canister and 45. 7 °C for the DOE Canister. The resulting maximum temperature at the bottom of the borehole is 135. 1 °C (reference canister) and 165. 7 °C (DOE canister) for the bounding defense waste. The centerline temperature for the borosilicate glass waste package is approximately 150 °C for the reference canister and 207 °C for the DOE canister. Because of the thermodynamic properties, overall corrosion resistance, and reasonable cost, pure copper was shown to be the best borehole outer canister material. High-chromium stainless steel could also be a good option for borehole canisters because it has been shown to be highly corrosion-resistant in environments similar to predicted borehole environments. Cesium ion was found to have the highest concentration in the borehole environment. However, the relatively low half life of the most abundant cesium isotope suggests that the cesium would decay before the canister is breached. For the reference canister, the drilling and emplacement costs are not expected to exceed $ 46 /kg of <b>vitrified</b> <b>waste</b> and the total disposal cost was found to be $ 153 /kg of <b>vitrified</b> <b>waste.</b> The total cost of disposal of defense waste in DOE containers is not expected to exceed $ 53 /kg of <b>vitrified</b> <b>waste.</b> Based on these analyses, disposal of <b>vitrified</b> defense <b>waste</b> in deep boreholes is expected to be technically and economically feasible.

40|$|Durable {{phosphate}} {{glasses were}} formed by vitrifying waste filter cakes from two metal finishing operations. Some melts formed crystalline components during cooling. Compositional analysis of dried, heat treated and vitrified samples was made using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, inductively-coupled plasma spectroscopy and Leco induction furnace combustion analysis. Hydrolytic dissolution, measured by an adapted product consistency test, was reduced {{by up to}} 3 orders of magnitude upon heat treatment or vitrification, surpassing the performance of borosilicate glass in some cases. This was attributed to {{the high levels of}} iron and zinc in the wastes, which greatly improve the durability of phosphate glasses. One of the wastes arose from a metal phosphating process and was particularly suitable for vitrification due to its high P 2 O 5 content and favourable melting behaviour. The other waste, which arose from a number of processes, was less suitable as it had a low P 2 O 5 content and during heating it emitted harmful corrosive gases and underwent violent reactions. Substantial volume reductions were obtained by heat treatment and vitrification of both wastes.

In Russia, these wastes {{are to be}} processed for disposition by immobilization in either borosilicate glass or cement matrices depending upon the waste stream-specific radionuclide contents. Vitrification is planned for the liquid high-level waste raffinate stream containing {{the bulk of the}} Am- 241 produced from Pu- 241 decay. Previous work on the Russian MOX Fuel Fabrication Facility (R-MFFF) by the Public Joint Stock Corporation (TVEL) [1] showed that this waste stream may contain significant amounts of silver derived from the electrochemical dissolution of PuO 2 using a Ag(II) catalyst. The work reported here further investigated silver solubility limits, which, if exceeded in a production glass melter, allow discrete silver grains to form in the glass and also deposit over time on the bottom of a joule-heated ceramic melter. In melters with immersed electrodes, such as the Russian EP- 100 for phosphate glasses or the US Duratek DP- 100 type melters for borosilicate glasses that are being considered for use at the Siberian Chemical Combine (SCC) Tomsk site, the undissolved silver could cause a short circuit and an unacceptable production melter failure. The silver solubility limit of 3. 85 wt% Ag{sub 2 }O in liquid, alpha-bearing wastes determined in this work will guide the production scale use of borosilicate glass compositions, and effectively increase the capacity of the ceramic melters and reduce the total volume of solidified <b>vitrified</b> <b>wastes</b> at SCC Tomsk that require storage prior to geologic disposal...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this review is to {{evaluate}} the final forms that have been proposed for radioactive-containing solid wastes and to determine their application to the solid wastes that will result from the treatment of newly generated liquid low-level waste (NGLLLW) and Melton Valley Storage Tank (MVST) supernate at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Since cesium and strontium are the predominant radionuclides in NGLLLW and MVST supernate, this review {{is focused on the}} stabilization and solidification of solid wastes containing these radionuclides in cement, glass, and polymeric materials-the principal waste forms that have been tested with these types of wastes. Several studies have shown that both cesium and strontium are leached by distilled water from solidified cement, although the leachabilities of cesium are generally higher than those of strontium under similar conditions. The situation is exacerbated by the presence of sulfates in the solution, as manifested by cracking of the grout. Additives such as bentonite, blast-furnace slag, fly ash, montmorillonite, pottery clay, silica, and zeolites generally decrease the cesium and strontium release rates. Longer cement curing times (> 28 d) and high ionic strengths of the leachates, such as those that occur in seawater, also decrease the leach rates of these radionuclides. Lower cesium leach rates are observed from <b>vitrified</b> <b>wastes</b> than from grout waste forms. However, significant quantities of cesium are volatilized due to the elevated temperatures required to vitrify the waste. Hence, vitrification will generally require the use of cleanup systems for the off-gases to prevent their release into the atmosphere...|$|E

Chemical weathering of LD 6 glass at 90 oC in contact with an aliquot of uncontaminated Hanford Site groundwater resulted in the formation of a Crystalline zeolitic mineral, phillipsite. In contrast similar chemical weathering of SRL 202 glass at 90 "C resulted in the formation of a microcrystalline smectitic mineral, nontronite. A second experiment was conducted at 90 "C to assess the degree to which key radionuclides would be sequestered in the structure of secondary crystalline minerals; namely, phillipsite and nontronite. Chemical weathering of LD 6 in contact with radionuclide-spiked Hanford Site groundwater indicated that substantial ilactions of the total activities were retained in the phillipsite structure. Similar chemical weathering of SRL 202 at 90 "C, also in contact with radionuclide-spiked Hanford Site groundwater, showed that significant fractions of the total activities were retained in the nontronite structure.

The generic disposal concept for high-level radioactive waste (HLW) in Boom Clay pursued within this context is based on the Belgian supercontainer concept [1]. In this concept, cementitious materials are extensively used in the engineered barrier system (i) as buffer within the waste container, (ii) as backfilling grout, and (iii) in the construction material for the disposal gallery linings. Thus the post closure conditions in the near-field will be governed by the interaction of Boom Clay porewaters with cementitious materials, leading to highly alkaline conditions {{in the vicinity of the}} emplaced wastes. The HLW inventory for the OPERA safety case comprises in particular <b>vitrified</b> <b>wastes</b> (HLW glass) from the reprocessing of light water reactor (LWR) fuels from commercial nuclear reactors and spent research reactor fuels, besides spent uranium targets from molybdenum isotope production, and non-heat generating wastes such as compacted hulls and ends from fuel assemblies. In this paper we present and discuss initial results of the evaluation of the corrosion behaviour of and the radionuclide release from vitrified HLW and spent fuel from research reactors under the disposal conditions encountered in a geological repository in Boom Clay in the Netherlands. The overall aim of this project is (i) to provide a coherent picture of the radionuclide release from HLW disposed in a generic repository in Boom Clay, (ii) to increase the understanding of waste form evolution (i. e. leaching and dissolution behaviour with time) and the radionuclide migration behaviour in the near-field, and finally (iii) to develop source terms for relevant radionuclides that are the main contributors to dose in the long-term in support of the post closure safety assessments. The results derived address directly the safety function "delay and attenuation of releases" relevant after the failure of the waste canisters when the waste forms come into contact with the near-field water. Due to the variability of the porewater composition encountered in the Boom Clay in the Netherlands and the generic nature of the OPERA safety case (i. e. without selection of a repository site), various scenarios regarding the composition of the near-field water resulting from the interaction of Boom Clay porewater with the cementitious materials and their evolution with time will be discussed. Vitrified HLW within the OPERA inventory comprise predominantly R 7 T 7 glasses from spent fuel reprocessing in La Hague, France, and, to a lesser extent, glasses from the reprocessing of fuels from the Dodewaard NPP in Sellafield, UK. The dissolution behaviour of the glasses depends on their composition (e. g. Mg-bearing glasses such as MW produced in the Sellafield vitrification plant exhibit generally a lower durability than the French R 7 T 7 glasses) as well as on the post closure conditions in the near-field. In general, HLW glass dissolution is expected to be more rapid at high pH in alkali-rich waters compared to waste emplacement in a non-cementitious, clay-based repository, leading to the formation of altered glass and secondary silicate phases, some of which may retain certain radionuclides (e. g. [2]). However, the presence of elevated calcium concentrations such as in evolved cement porewaters buffered by portlandite appears to reduce the glass dissolution rate (e. g. [3]), suggesting a favourable effect on HLW glass durability under high pH conditions. Thus the evolution of near-field chemistry and the extent of cement alteration resulting from the exchange with Boom Clay porewaters will directly impact the glass corrosion rates, the formation of glass alteration layers and secondary phases as well as radionuclide release with time. Research reactor fuels relevant within the OPERA safety case are plate-shaped dispersion type fuels consisting of uranium-aluminide (UAlx) or uranium-silicide (e. g. U 3 Si 2) fuel particles dispersed in an aluminium matrix that is metallurgicaly bonded to aluminium cladding, employing either high-enriched uranium (HEU, up to 80 to 95 wt. % 235 U) or low-enriched uranium (LEU, up to 20 wt. % 235 U). Corrosion data obtained for these types of fuels in salt brines, granite waters, or clay waters indicate a – with respect to the time scales relevant for geological disposal – practically instantaneous corrosion after coming into contact with groundwater (i. e. after failure of the waste canisters) [4, 5]. A similar behaviour is suggested under disposal conditions in a cementitious repository in Boom Clay, due to high aluminium corrosion rates under alkaline conditions leading to a fast disintegration of the fuels. The amount, nature and stability of potential secondary phases formed during the corrosion process (e. g. layered double hydroxide phases (LDH)) that may retain certain radionuclides depend on the near field conditions and is as such the degree of interaction of the Boom Clay pore waters with the cementitious materials and the stage of cement degradation at the time of the failure of the waste canisters. Uranium and some actinides are assumed to be solubility limited under the expected near-field conditions. References[1] Verhoef, E., Neeft, E., Grupa, J., Poley, A. 2011.

40|$|The Soviet Union {{operates}} {{a vast and}} growing radioactive waste management system. Detailed information on this system is rare and a general overall picture only emerges after a review of {{a great deal of}} literature. Poor waste management practices and slow implementation of environmental restoration activities have caused a great deal of national concern. The release of information on the cause and extent of an accident involving high-level waste at the Kyshtym production reactor site in 1957, as well as other contamination at the site, serve to highlight past Soviet waste management practices. As a result, the area of waste management is now receiving greater emphasis, and more public disclosures. Little is known about Soviet waste management practices related to uranium mining, conversion, and fuel fabrication processes. However, releases of radioactive material to the environment from uranium mining and milling operations, such as from mill tailings piles, are causing public concern. Official Soviet policy calls for a closed fuel cycle, with reprocessing of power reactor fuel that has been cooled for five years. For power reactors, only VVER- 440 reactor fuel has been reprocessed in any significant amount, and a decision on the disposition of RBMK reactor fuel has been postponed indefinitely. Soviet reprocessing efforts are falling behind schedule; thus longer storage times for spent fuel will be required, primarily at multiple reactor stations. Information on reprocessing in the Soviet Union has been severely limited until 1989, when two reprocessing sites were acknowledged by the Soviets. A 400 -metric ton (MT) per year reprocessing facility, located at Kyshtym, has been operational since 1949 for reprocessing production reactor fuel. This facility is reported to have been reprocessing VVER- 440 and naval reactor fuel since 1978, with about 2000 MT of VVER- 440 fuel being reprocessed by July 1989. A second facility, located near Krasnoyarsk and having a 1500 MT per year capacity as the first of several modules, was about 30 % completed by July 1989. The completion of this plant was subsequently "indefinitely postponed. " The initial reprocessing scheme at the Kyshtym site used sodium uranyl acetate precipitation from fuel dissolved in nitric acid solutions. The basic method~ ology now appears {{to be based on the}} conventional PUREX process. Dry reprocessing on a pilot or laboratory scale has been under way in Dimitrovgrad since 1984, and a larger unit is now being built, according to the French CEA. Perhaps significantly, much research is being done on partitioning high-level waste into element fractions. The Soviets appear to have the technology to remove radioactive noble gases released during reprocessing operations; however, there are no indications of its implementation. Millions of curies of liquid low- and intermediate-level wastes have been disposed of by well injection into underground areas where they were supposedly contained by watertight rock strata. Some gaseous wastes were also disposed of by well injection. This practice is not referred to in recent literature and thus may not be widely used today. Rather, it appears that these waste streams are now first treated to reduce volume, and then solidified using bitumen or concrete. These solidified liquid wastes from Soviet nuclear power reactor operations, along with solid wastes, are disposed of in shallow-land burial sites located at most large power reactor stations. In addition, 35 shallow-land burial sites have been alluded to by the Soviets for disposal of industrial, medical, and research low-level wastes as well as ionization sources. Research on tritium-bearing and other gaseous wastes is mentioned, as well as a waste minimization program aimed at reducing the volume of waste streams by 30 %. The Soviets have announced that their high-level waste management plan is to 1) store liquid wastes for 3 - 5 years; 2) incorporate the waste into glass (at a final glass volume of 100 - 150 liters/MT of fuel reprocessed); 3) set it aside in air-cooled storage for 30 - 50 years; and 4 } provide for its final disposal in a deep geologic repository. High-level waste solidification research started in the 1950 s, and a pilot vitrification facility has operated for 10 years at Kyshtym. A fully radioactive unit also operated there for about two years until 1988 and produced 160 MT of HLW phosphate glass, containing 3. 9 x 106 curies of radioactivity. [This corresponds to radioactivity in about 10 MT of 10 -year-old power reactor fuel. ] Problems with the glass melter electrodes have caused this latter plant to shut down, but a new design and plant are being developed. A site near Krasnoyarsk has also recently been referred to as a disposal site for low- and intermediate-level waste streams and possibly for <b>vitrified</b> <b>wastes</b> from Kyshtym. Deep geologic disposal of vitrified high-level waste has been studied, at a modest level of effort, over the last decade in the Soviet Union. Key disposal concepts under consideration include mining shafts, deep drill holes, and underground excavations. Although a variety of host rock types have been addressed, the emphasis appears to be on salt, clay, and granite. The Soviet Union appears to require the use of man-made barriers and waste packages in permanent disposal, but the geologic formation will be relied upon as the primary protective barrier. The construction schedule for a Soviet repository has not been stated. Meanwhile, a decision on the first repository site may be made in 1990, with a candidate site being at Chelyabinsk...|$|E

40|$|Performance {{modeling}} for Low Level Mixed Waste disposal {{was conducted}} using the measured leach rates {{from a number}} of <b>vitrified</b> <b>waste</b> formulations. The objective {{of the study was to}} determine if the improved durability of a <b>vitrified</b> mixed <b>waste</b> would allow trench disposal at the Savannah River Site (SRS). Leaching data were compiled from twenty-nine diverse reference glasses, encompassing a wide range of exposed glass surface area to leachant volume ratios (SA/V), and various leachant solutions; all of which had been leached at 90 degrees Celsius, using the MCC- 1 or PCT procedures (ASTM Procedures C 1220 - 92 and C 1285 - 94, respectively). The normalized leach rates were scaled to the ambient disposal temperature of 25 degrees Celsius, and compared to the allowable leach rate of uranium - which would meet the performance assessment requirements. The results indicated that a glass of above average durability (vs. the reference glasses) would meet the uranium leaching concentration for direct SRS trench disposal...|$|R
40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This {{feasibility}} study report presents a draft {{design of the}} <b>Vitrified</b> <b>Waste</b> Interim Storage Facility (VWISF), {{which is one of}} three subprojects of the Idaho Waste Vitrification Facilities (IWVF) project. The primary goal of the IWVF project is to design and construct a treatment process system that will <b>vitrify</b> the sodium-bearing <b>waste</b> (SBW) to a final waste form. The project will consist of three subprojects that include the Waste Collection Tanks Facility, the Waste Vitrification Facility (WVF), and the VWISF. The Waste Collection Tanks Facility will provide for waste collection, feed mixing, and surge storage for SBW and newly generated liquid waste from ongoing operations at the Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center. The WVF will contain the vitrification process that will mix the waste with glass-forming chemicals or frit and turn the waste into glass. The VWISF will provide a shielded storage facility for the glass until the waste can be disposed at either the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant as mixed transuranic waste or at the future national geological repository as high-level waste glass, pending the outcome of a Waste Incidental to Reprocessing determination, which is currently in progress. A secondary goal is to provide a facility that can be easily modified later to accommodate storage of the <b>vitrified</b> high-level <b>waste</b> calcine...|$|R

The mixed waste samples investigated include <b>vitrified</b> <b>waste</b> glass and contaminated soil. Compared to traditional analysis techniques, the laser-based method is fast (i. e., analysis times {{on the order of}} minutes) and essentially waste free since little or no sample preparation is required. Detection limits on the order of pmm Sr were determined. Detection limits obtained using a fiber optic cable to deliver laser pulses to soil samples containing Cr, Zr, Pb, Be, Cu, and Ni will also be discussed...|$|R

Feeding a liquid slurry requires simpler and less expensive equipment than feeding a powdered calcine. Experiments have progressed from manual feeding, to a semiautomatic system, to the present slurry-feed system, which is completely automatic.

Here, tests are to be made of conditioning the fuel elements in order to store them in a deep repository, and also to reload the containers for the <b>vitrified</b> <b>waste</b> blocks into containers suited to long-term storage. The dry cask storage containers themselves are not suitable for long-term storage and can not be placed in the salt dome for technical reasons. However, at present the plant may only be used for repairing damaged containers, according to an agreement signed by the German government.|$|R
40|$|The in situ {{analysis}} of surface conditions of <b>vitrified</b> nuclear <b>wastes</b> can provide an important check of the burial status of radioactive objects without risk of radiation exposure. Raman spectroscopy was initially chosen as the most promising method for testing the surface conditions of glasses undergoing chemical corrosion, and was used extensively during the first year. However, {{it was determined that}} infrared reflection spectroscopy was better suited to this particular need and was used for the remaining two years to investigate the surface corrosion behavior of model silicate glasses for extension to nuclear waste glasses. The developed methodology is consistent with the known theory of optical propagation of dielectric media and uses the Kramers-Kronig formalism. The results show {{that it is possible to}} study the corrosion of glass by analyzing the glass surface using reflection fast Fourier infrared measurements and the newly developed ''dispersion analysis method.

40|$|Safeguarding the {{plutonium}} {{passing through a}} large-scale reprocessing plant (such as one with 800 t of uranium per year) involves nondestructive assay measurements for plutonium at key points. The gamma-ray and neutron signals from {{the plutonium}} are generally hidden by the much larger backgrounds from fission products and actinides, so indirect measurements are routinely used. The intense neutron emission rate from spent fuel is from curium. In a spent fuel assembly at the head-end of a plant, the curium neutrons are used to deduce the amount of plutonium present. Coincidence and multiplicity counting are alternative ways to measure neutrons from spent fuel; they have advantages over total neutron counting in certain conditions and offer new opportunities for examining assemblies. New uses for measurements of curium`s neutrons are proposed to safeguard waste streams. From a year`s work at a large-scale plant, 4 to 7 kg of plutonium can remain in leached hulls and 4 to 22 kg of plutonium can remain in the <b>vitrified</b> high-level liquid <b>waste.</b> While the plutonium in these wastes has the safeguards advantage of being dilute, {{it is important to}} verify (a) that the many kilograms involved are in fact present and (b) that the declared masses are not higher than the actual amounts so that more concentrated plutonium cannot pass through the plant by masquerading as waste. Curium measurements on spent fuel assemblies, the accountability tank, and leached hulls would form a safeguards system around all the inputs and outputs of a plant`s head-end where the plutonium is always intimately mixed with the curium. A neutron measurement of the <b>vitrified</b> <b>waste</b> would help identify the presence of a diversion path upstream because essentially all of the curium measured in the spent fuel assemblies should also be found in the <b>vitrified</b> <b>waste</b> (on a batch basis). 7 refs., 4 figs...|$|R
