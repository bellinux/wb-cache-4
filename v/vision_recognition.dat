50|$|In {{practice}} {{it is not}} possible to obtain the quoted theoretical maximum throughput rate for machines in a placement system. It is necessary to derate the theoretical numbers to obtain realistic values, due to unexpected downtime, board load and unload time and machine configuration. Other factors include PWB size, component mix, and the requirement for more complex <b>vision</b> <b>recognition</b> for fine-pitch components. There are many techniques of derating. Global derating considers system-wide stops, slow-downs and set ups as well as machine factors. To calculate the amount of global or system derating, one should take the average of the number of total components placed per hour in a long period (i.e. an entire product shift). Regularly scheduled stops should be included when determining the level of global derating the system requires.Rigorous derating, which considers each piece of equipment in service for a particular product individually, must be conducted by specific machine model for the line balancing. Rigorous derating values are necessary for full optimization of the process.|$|E

To this end, this paper presents a method for computer <b>vision</b> <b>recognition</b> of incomplete symbols in Russian symbols based on Hough transform algorithm. According to the mapping from the image space to the parameter space, the complex edge feature information in image space is transformed into the clustering problem in the parameter space, and the discrimination function and the rules are developed and employed to recognize the image need to be recognized. Experiments show that with Hough transform algorithm to identify incomplete symbols in Russian symbols, the incomplete symbol in Russian symbols can be identified quickly and effectively, which improves the performance of recognition method and meet the needs of many scholars. ...|$|E

In order {{to investigate the}} law of quantitative changes of the visual recognition distance under the conditions of different speeds and different environmental luminosity around drivers, calibration experiments were conducted on an actual road. And {{on the basis of}} the data set from the experiments, using the method of curved surface regression analysis, the function models describing the rule of the visual recognition distance changing with the environmental luminosity around drivers and running speeds were established. The models were effective via statistical tests. Furthermore, combined with the automobile braking distance, the reaction time allowed for drivers and the critical speeds were analyzed then. Verification tests were also designed to test the established function model. Results showed that as the environmental luminosity around drivers increases, <b>vision</b> <b>recognition</b> distance decreases; as vehicle speed increases, <b>vision</b> <b>recognition</b> distance decreases. Therefore, the sudden showing-up light sources will affect the environmental luminosity in the cab and lead to the reduction in the visual recognition distance as well as the reaction time for drivers. In this circumstance, drivers must control the speed lower than the critical speed to avoid collision...|$|E

For this, a computer <b>vision</b> feature <b>recognition</b> method based on Improved Wavelet arithmetic is put forward. Firstly, spline binary wavelet decomposition is fused in the method to extract edge feature from collected images, and then wavelet moment invariants of the processed image is calculated and acted as the characteristic quantity of computer vision, so as to complete the accurate identification of the characteristics of computer vision. Characteristic quantity extracted through this method can not only solve the problem of uneven illumination, illumination variation and noise interference, also translation, rotation and zoom.

40|$|Feedforward visual object {{perception}} recruits a {{cortical network}} that {{is assumed to}} be hierarchical, progressing from basic visual features to complete object representations. However, the nature of the intermediate features related to this transformation remains poorly understood. Here, we explore how well different computer <b>vision</b> <b>recognition</b> models account for neural object encoding across the human cortical visual pathway as measured using fMRI. These neural data, collected during the viewing of 60 images of real-world objects, were analyzed with a searchlight procedure as in Kriegeskorte, Goebel, and Bandettini (2006) : Within each searchlight sphere, the obtained patterns of neural activity for all 60 objects were compared to model responses for each computer recognition algorithm using representational dissimilarity analysis (Kriegeskorte et al., 2008). Although each of the computer vision methods significantly accounted for some of the neural data, among the different models, the scale invariant feature transform (Lowe, 2004), encoding local visual properties gathered from 2 Ì 2 interest points, 2 Ì 2 was best able to accurately and consistently account for stimulus representations within the ventral pathway. More generally, when present, significance was observed in regions of the ventral-temporal cortex associated with intermediate-level object perception. Differences in model effectiveness and the neural location of significant matches may be attributable to the fact that each model implements a different featural basis for representing objects (e. g., more holistic or more parts-based). Overall, we conclude that well-known computer <b>vision</b> <b>recognition</b> systems may serve as viable proxies for theories of intermediate visual object representation...|$|E

Background Early computer <b>vision</b> <b>recognition</b> schemes focused primarily on the {{recognition of}} rigid three-dimensional (3 D) objects, such as machine parts, tools, and cars. This is a challenging problem because the same object can have markedly different appearances when viewed from different directions.

These techniques numerically describe shapes independent of translation, scale and rotation and can be easily applied to topographical data. The applicability of the moment invariants technique to classify objects on large-scale maps is described. From the test data used, moments are fairly reliable at distinguishing certain classes of topographic object. However, their effectiveness will increase when fused with the results of other techniques. 1...|$|E
