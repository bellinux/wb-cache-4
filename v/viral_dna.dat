5|$|The major way {{bacteria}} {{defend themselves}} from bacteriophages is by producing enzymes which destroy foreign DNA. These enzymes, called restriction endonucleases, cut up the <b>viral</b> <b>DNA</b> that bacteriophages inject into bacterial cells.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} viral capsid enters the cell, an enzyme called reverse {{transcriptase}} liberates the single-stranded (+)RNA genome from the attached viral proteins and copies {{it into a}} complementary DNA (cDNA) molecule. The process of reverse transcription is extremely error-prone, and the resulting mutations may cause drug resistance or allow the virus to evade the body's immune system. The reverse transcriptase also has ribonuclease activity that degrades the viral RNA during the synthesis of cDNA, as well as DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity that creates a sense DNA from the antisense cDNA. Together, the cDNA and its complement form a double-stranded <b>viral</b> <b>DNA</b> that is then transported into the cell nucleus. The integration of the <b>viral</b> <b>DNA</b> into the host cell's genome is carried out by another viral enzyme called integrase.|$|E
5|$|This {{integrated}} <b>viral</b> <b>DNA</b> {{may then}} lie dormant, in the latent stage of HIV infection. To actively produce the virus, certain cellular transcription factors {{need to be}} present, {{the most important of}} which is NF-κB (NF kappaB), which is upregulated when T-cells become activated. This means that those cells most likely to be killed by HIV are those currently fighting infection.|$|E
40|$|The {{identification}} method of adenoviruses by cleavage patterns with restriction endonucleases was improved for practical use. 1) Spot hybridization with infected cell DNAs {{could be used}} for subgrouping of adenoviruses, and the subgrouping was of considerable help for the identification of adenoviruses. 2) Southern blot hybridization with nick translated 32 P labelled <b>viral</b> <b>DNAs</b> as probes increased the sensitivity of detecting cleavage patterns by 300 -fold or more compared to the ethidium bromide staining procedure. 3) Using the Southern blot hybridization method, cleavage patterns of infected <b>viral</b> <b>DNAs</b> could be investigated with DNAs from virus infected cells before the cytopathic effect appeared...|$|R

5|$|A {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} test on a blood sample from affected animals will confirm a suspected case by identifying the <b>viral</b> <b>DNA,</b> though it is now common to start famciclovir treatment at the earliest possible moment rather than waiting for confirmation of the case. Prior {{to the development of}} the test, or in circumstances where it is not available, the disease may be misdiagnosed as any of a number of other conditions which have a quick onset leading to rapid death, including encephalomyocarditis and salmonellosis.|$|E
5|$|Genital herpes {{can be more}} {{difficult}} to diagnose than oral herpes, since most HSV-2-infected persons have no classical symptoms. Further confusing diagnosis, several other conditions resemble genital herpes, including fungal infection, lichen planus, atopic dermatitis, and urethritis. Laboratory testing is often used to confirm a diagnosis of genital herpes. Laboratory tests include culture of the virus, direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) studies to detect virus, skin biopsy, and polymerase chain reaction to test for presence of <b>viral</b> <b>DNA.</b> Although these procedures produce highly sensitive and specific diagnoses, their high costs and time constraints discourage their regular use in clinical practice.|$|E
5|$|Some viruses {{replicate}} within archaea: {{these are}} double-stranded DNA viruses with unusual and sometimes unique shapes. These viruses {{have been studied}} in most detail in the thermophilic archaea, particularly the orders Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales. Defences against these viruses involve RNA interference from repetitive DNA sequences within archaean genomes {{that are related to}} the genes of the viruses. Most archaea have CRISPR–Cas systems as an adaptive defence against viruses. These enable archaea to retain sections of <b>viral</b> <b>DNA,</b> which are then used to target and eliminate subsequent infections by the virus using a process similar to RNA interference.|$|E

We present an effective ICP-MS-based multiplex and ultrasensitive assay of <b>viral</b> <b>DNAs</b> with lanthanide-coded oligonucleotide hybridization and rolling circle amplification (RCA) strategies on biofunctional magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), in which single-stranded capture DNA (ss-Cap-DNA) -functionalized MNPs (up to 1. 65 X 10 (4) ss-Cap-DNA per MNP) were used to recognize and enrich target DNAs, and single-stranded report DNA (ss-Rep-DNA-DOTA-Ln) coded by the lanthanide-DOTA complex hybridized with the targeted DNA for highly sensitive readout of HIV (28 amol), HAV (48 amol), and HBV (19 amol). When utilizing the RCA technique {{in association with the}} design and synthesis of a "bridge" DNA and a corresponding ss-Rep-DNA-DOTA-Ho, as low as 90 zmol HBV could be detected. Preliminary applications to the determination of the <b>viral</b> <b>DNAs</b> in 4 T 1 cell lysates and in serum confirmed the feasibility of this ICP-MS-based multiplex DNA assay for clinical use.

40|$|While the cytoplasmic {{phase of}} the {{hepadnavirus}} replication cycle is well understood, very {{little is known about}} the nuclear phase. In contrast to retroviruses, proviral integration is not required for hepadnavirus replication; however, some of the <b>viral</b> <b>DNAs</b> in the nucleus are diverted into an integration pathway. Under certain conditions these integrations function as carcinogenic agents. In order to study the integration process, we have utilized LMH-D 2 cells, which replicate wild-type duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV), to develop the first protocol to detect and characterize integrations of DHBV originating from episomal <b>viral</b> <b>DNAs.</b> Contrary to expectations, our results showed that stable new integrations are readily detectable in subclones of LMH-D 2 cells. Complete characterization of one integration revealed a single-genome-length integrant with the structure of double-stranded linear (DSL) DHBV DNAs which are produced by in situ priming during viral replication. The integration contained a terminal redundancy of 6 bp from the r region of the virus DNA minus strand as well as a direct repeat of 70 bp of cellular DNA. On the basis of the structure of the integrant and the cellular DNA target site, we propose a molecular model for the integration mechanism that has some similarities to that of retroviruses. Identification of DSL hepadnavirus DNA integration suggests the possibility that modified DSL <b>viral</b> <b>DNAs</b> may be the precursors to a class of simple, unrearranged hepadnavirus integrations...|$|R
5|$|The genome of HBV {{is made of}} {{circular}} DNA, but it {{is unusual}} because the DNA is not fully double-stranded. One end of the full length strand {{is linked to the}} <b>viral</b> <b>DNA</b> polymerase. The genome is 3020–3320 nucleotides long (for the full-length strand) and 1700–2800 nucleotides long (for the short length-strand). The negative-sense (non-coding) is complementary to the viral mRNA. The <b>viral</b> <b>DNA</b> is found in the nucleus soon after infection of the cell. The partially double-stranded DNA is rendered fully double-stranded by completion of the (+) sense strand and removal of a protein molecule from the (−) sense strand and a short sequence of RNA from the (+) sense strand. Non-coding bases are removed from the ends of the (−) sense strand and the ends are rejoined. There are four known genes encoded by the genome, called C, X, P, and S. The core protein is coded for by gene C (HBcAg), and its start codon is preceded by an upstream in-frame AUG start codon from which the pre-core protein is produced. HBeAg is produced by proteolytic processing of the pre-core protein. In some rare strains of the virus known as Hepatitis B virus precore mutants, no HBeAg is present.|$|E
5|$|The major way {{bacteria}} {{defend themselves}} from bacteriophages is by producing enzymes that destroy foreign DNA. These enzymes, called restriction endonucleases, cut up the <b>viral</b> <b>DNA</b> that bacteriophages inject into bacterial cells. Bacteria also contain {{a system that}} uses CRISPR sequences to retain fragments of the genomes of viruses that the bacteria have {{come into contact with}} in the past, which allows them to block the virus's replication through a form of RNA interference. This genetic system provides bacteria with acquired immunity to infection.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{a member}} of the genus Lentivirus, part of the family Retroviridae. Lentiviruses have many morphologies and {{biological}} properties in common. Many species are infected by lentiviruses, which are characteristically responsible for long-duration illnesses with a long incubation period. Lentiviruses are transmitted as single-stranded, positive-sense, enveloped RNA viruses. Upon entry into the target cell, the viral RNA genome is converted (reverse transcribed) into double-stranded DNA by a virally encoded reverse transcriptase that is transported along with the viral genome in the virus particle. The resulting <b>viral</b> <b>DNA</b> is then imported into the cell nucleus and integrated into the cellular DNA by a virally encoded integrase and host co-factors. Once integrated, the virus may become latent, allowing the virus and its host cell to avoid detection by the immune system. Alternatively, the virus may be transcribed, producing new RNA genomes and viral proteins that are packaged and released from the cell as new virus particles that begin the replication cycle anew.|$|E
40|$|The human {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) and the woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) {{are closely}} related by several criteria and {{belong to the same}} class of DNA viruses. The DNA genomes from these viruses are difficult to obtain in quantities required for biochemical analysis. We have, therefore, cloned these two DNAs in the vector lambda gtWES and subcloned into the kanamycin resistance plasmid pA 01. Comparison of the recombinant <b>DNAs</b> with authentic <b>viral</b> <b>DNAs</b> by specific hybridization, size, and restriction enzyme analysis suggests that the recombinants contain the complete genome of each virus. The nominal size of the cloned HBV genome was 3150 base pairs, compared to 3200 base pairs for the cloned WHV genome.

25|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} replication systems {{during the life}} cycle of a retrovirus. First of all, the reverse transcriptase synthesizes <b>viral</b> <b>DNA</b> from viral RNA, and then from newly made complementary DNA strand. The second replication process occurs when host cellular DNA polymerase replicates the integrated <b>viral</b> <b>DNA.</b> Lastly, RNA polymerase II transcribes the proviral DNA into RNA, which will be packed into virions. Therefore, mutation can occur during one or all of these replication steps.|$|E
25|$|Assembly of the virion uses two {{scaffolding}} proteins, internal scaffolding protein B {{and external}} scaffolding protein D. The function of protein B {{seems to be}} to lower the amount of protein D needed by the virion for assembly. Protein H is a multifunctional structural protein required for piloting the <b>viral</b> <b>DNA</b> into the host cell interior during the entry process. Protein E is a 91-amino acid membrane protein that causes host cell lysis by inhibiting the host translocase MraY. This inhibitory activity is located within the N terminal 29 amino acids. Protein A is a single strand endonuclease and is responsible for the initiation of <b>viral</b> <b>DNA</b> replication. It catalyses cleavage and ligation of a phosphodiester bond between a G and A nucleotide residue pair at the phi X origin. It may not be essential for phage viability but burst sizes are reduced by 50% when it is mutated. Protein A* inhibits host DNA replication. Unlike protein A it is capable of cleaving the phi X <b>viral</b> <b>DNA</b> in the presence of single-stranded binding protein of the host. Protein A*, like Protein A, may not be required for phage viability. Protein C increases the fidelity of the termination and reinitiation reactions and is required for the packagaing of the <b>viral</b> <b>DNA</b> in to the protein shell. Protein K has 56 amino acids and is found in the membrane of the host cell. It appears to be able to increase the burst size of the virus.|$|E

40|$|Marek {{disease is}} a lymphomatous disease of {{chickens}} caused by infection of a herpesvirus, Marek disease virus (MDV). Marek disease is the only neoplastic disease for which a successful vaccine has been developed. The vaccine virus, herpesvirus of turkeys (HVT), is non-oncogenic in chickens. Despite the strong antigenic relationship between these viruses, previous studies showed that the two <b>viral</b> <b>DNAs</b> share little or no homology. Using less stringent hybridization conditions and methods that greatly improve the reassociation kinetics, we have reexamined the sequence homology between MDV and HVT DNA. We report here that HVT and MDV are far more closely related than previously reported. The homology between these two <b>viral</b> <b>DNAs</b> ranges between 70 % and 80 % at the nucleotide level and appears to extend over 90 - 95 % of the respective genomes. Under the low stringency conditions used, MDV DNA fails to cross-hybridize with DNA from feline rhinotracheitis virus, an antigenically unrelated herpesvirus with a G-C content identical to that of MDV and HVT...|$|R
