40|$|International audienceThe {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to compare the mechanical behaviour of lengthwise and plain <b>sliced</b> <b>veneer</b> of the species beech (L.). Therefore, tension tests parallel and perpendicular to the grain were carried out. The results were evaluated using the variance analysis (ANOVA). As a result it can be stated that lengthwise <b>sliced</b> <b>veneers</b> exhibit significantly higher strength and better mechanical characteristics than plain <b>sliced</b> <b>veneers.</b> The checks parallel to the grain which occurred by manufacturing at that side of the veneer leaf which faces the cutting edge and which is stressed in tension are to be considered as reason therefore. In contrast to the tests parallel to the grain the modulus of elasticity perpendicular to the grain shows significantly lower values for lengthwise <b>sliced</b> <b>veneers</b> than for plain <b>sliced</b> <b>veneers.</b> Due to their higher strength values lengthwise <b>sliced</b> <b>veneers</b> are considered better base materials for engineered wood products than plain <b>sliced</b> <b>veneers...</b>|$|R

40|$|Plantains are wasted due to {{deterioration}} when {{dumped in}} villages and towns {{during the peak}} of harvest. Therefore, {{it is necessary that}} plantains are processed into chips for preservation and availability throughout the year. Modern methods of slicing have greatly improved production rate and reduces slicing time. The main objective {{of this study was to}} modify an existing plantain <b>slicing</b> <b>machine</b> so as to optimize its efficiency at low cost, reduce total time of slicing and produce hygienic and quality chips. The improvement on the design of the existing <b>slicing</b> <b>machine</b> was achieved through proper focus on the capacity, materials and other design criteria for various component parts. The slicer consists of cutting disc, cutting chamber, feeding chute, the main frame and power transmitting unit. The result of the improvement on the design of this <b>slicing</b> <b>machine</b> showed that maintenance cost is cheap, slicing time of plantain chips was reduced, operation of the machine does not require special skill, the machine is easy and safe to operate, it is free of noise and vibration,the slicing method is continuous with two slicing blades provided inside the cutting chamber and energy for loading and unloading is reduced since feeding chute and collecting bucket are provided.

40|$|The {{value of}} red alder lumber is diminished by {{discoloration}} {{caused by the}} enzyme-mediated poly-merization of the diarylheptanoid xyloside, Oregonin that results {{in the formation of}} red-colored chro-mophores in freshly felled wood. This discoloration can be reduced by pre-steaming wood prior to kiln drying of lumber or <b>veneer</b> <b>slicing,</b> but in practice, there is still variation in the color of heat-treated wood, particularly in <b>veneer</b> <b>sliced</b> from heat-treated cants processed at different times of the year. There is seasonal variation in the concentration of Oregonin that is involved in the discoloration of red alder wood and it is hypothesized here that heat-treated red alder wood will be redder and darker when the wood is obtained from logs harvested during spring when the concentration of Oregonin is known to be higher than in other seasons. The aim of this research was to test this hypothesis, and also examine the effects of log storage time and location of wood in stems on the color of heat-treated red alder wood. The color of red alder wood subjected to an isothermal heat treatment at 70 °C was strongly influenced by the season in which parent trees were harvested and the length of time that logs were stored prior to heat treatment of wood. In particular, wood harvested in spring and stored for 2 wk prior to heat treatment was significantly darker than similarly treated wood obtained from logs harvested in other seasons, and redder than woo...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} slicing {{of extended}} finite state machines. These may be non- deterministic and hence standard techniques for slicing, developed for control flow graphs, are not immediately applicable. In this {{paper we propose}} ways of expressing the semantic correctness of slicing. We shall demand that the <b>sliced</b> <b>machine</b> simulates the original machine, so an “observable” step taken by the latter can also {{be done by the}} former. In the other direction, we cannot hope for a perfect simulation, but demand that for each observable step by the <b>sliced</b> <b>machine,</b> either the original machine simulates it or (i) it gets stuck, or (ii) it loops. To ensure correctness, it suffices to demand that the set of transitions in the slice satisfies two conditions: it must be closed under the well-known notion of data dependence, and it must have the “weak commitment ” property highlighted by Danicic et al. If the slice also has the “strong commitment ” property, the case (ii) above can be ruled out, meaning that the original machine will simulate the <b>sliced</b> <b>machine</b> except that it may get stuck. We prove that for each of the properties “weak commitment ” and “strong com- mitment”, there exists a least set with that property; we also give algorithms to compute that least set...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1993 The drying of wood is {{required}} in most forest products manufacturing operations. Depending on the wood species, dimensions, drying temperatures, and drying duration, the amount of emissions and energy consumption can greatly affect the operating cost, environment, and quality of wood dried. As such, the forest products industry continues to explore the use of new technologies to address these points of concern. A study was done to evaluate {{the addition of a}} radio-frequency (RF) heating system to a natural gas-fired conventional veneer dryer as a means to reduce emissions, reduce energy consumption, and improve productivity while maintaining material quality. To establish the benefits of RF-assisted drying, a study comparison was made for drying wood veneer in a RF-assisted dryer and a conventional dryer. The study was conducted at Western <b>Veneer</b> and <b>Slicing</b> in White City, Oregon. This plant was selected because both types of dryers, an RF-assisted dryer manufactured by Production Machinery, Inc. and a conventional dryer manufactured by Amitec, were located at the same site and were used for drying the same type of material. Two comparison drying tests were conducted, one using sliced ponderosa pine and the other using rotary peeled Douglas-fir. The <b>sliced</b> <b>veneer</b> was selected because it was the type of material used by the White City plant and the rotary veneer was used because it is of the type used in the plywood industry. The parameters measured for each drying run were material flows, drying rates, emission rates, dryer operating conditions, exhaust conditions, and electrical and natural gas consumption. It was found that although the RF-assisted dryer was able to successfully dry the <b>sliced</b> <b>veneer</b> as it was designed to do, it was not properly "tuned" to efficiently dry the rotary veneer. Therefore, {{the results of this study}} should only be made for the <b>sliced</b> <b>veneer</b> studies.
