40|$|This article {{introduces}} a technique for estimating the {{power spectral density}} (PSD) of a random signal based on observations made by several observers and at dierent sampling rates. We consider a discrete-time mathematical model where an observer sees the original random signal x(n) through a bank of sensors which we model by linear lters and down-samplers. Each sensor, therefore, outputs a measurement signal <b>v</b> <b>i</b> (<b>n)</b> whose sampling rate is {{only a fraction of}} the sampling rate assumed for the original signal under observation. In general, low-rate observations give only partial information about a signal's statistics. Thus, estimating the PSD of x(n) given statistics of <b>v</b> <b>i</b> (<b>n)</b> is an illposed problem. In this paper, we use the Maximum Entropy Principle as a formal method of inductive inference and provide a solution for the case that x(n) is Gaussian and wide-sense stationary.

The holomorphic invariants, which generalize the famous Futaki invariants [1], are obstructions towards {{the existence of}} Kähler-Ricci solitons. For a Kähler manifold with the first positive Chern class, {{the existence of the}} Kähler-Ricci soliton can be reduced to the existence of the solution of a non-linear equation of Monge-Ampere type. In general, solving such an equation is highly non-trivial. Similar to the Futaki invariants, the Tian-Zhu invariants gives the obstruction before one need to solve the equation. It is thus very important to compute it concretary. In this paper, in the case of hypersurfaces, we give an explicit formula. Let M ⊂ CP n be a smooth hypersurface defined by a homogeneous polynomial F = 0 of degree d. Let v and X be two holomorphic vector fields on CP n.

The Roman general Scipio Africanus conquered it in 209 BC and renamed it as Carthago Nova (literally [...] "New New City") to distinguish it from the mother city.
