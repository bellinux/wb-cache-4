The paper deals about the automation of direct strength analysis procedure using ANSYS. The stresses at different locations are calculated due to internal cargo load, ballast load, and the external hydrodynamic sea pressure for specific load cases. The still water bending moment (SWBM) has been picked from loading manuals. The wave bending moments (WBM) are calculated from JBP Rules. The effects of SWBM & WBM are applied to the structure with proper load combination factor and local hull girder moment correction. The results are extracted using general post-processor of ANSYS for checking yielding, buckling and ultimate strength.

As part of the patrol role, the Pacifics {{have been used for}} customs inspection of ships, and have stopped some smuggling and drug-running operations. Some nations charter the vessels out to other government agencies or private companies for salvage work, hydrographic surveying, or even tasks like helping to establish aquaculture farms.
