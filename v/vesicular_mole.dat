50|$|Clinically, Breus' mole may be asymptomatic, or {{may present}} with signs of {{decreased}} {{blood flow to}} the foetus such as growth restriction and foetal distress. Postnatally, Breus' mole is found in placental examination following live birth or spontaneous abortion. Breus' mole is diagnosed antinatally by ultrasound, where a thick multilobulated hematoma can be seen beneath the chorion. Occasionally, subchorial thrombohematoma may later become intraplacental, making its diagnosis difficult. The mole may be echogenic or hypoechoic depending upon the amount of fresh blood present in it. Breus' mole should be differentiated from <b>vesicular</b> <b>mole</b> and missed abortion in an ultrasound examination.|$|E

40|$|Cardiopulmonary {{dysfunction}} {{has been}} observed after the removal of benign hydatidiform mole {{which can lead to}} substantial morbidity and mortality. We report a case of 30 year old woman who came to casualty with a complete <b>vesicular</b> <b>mole.</b> Evacuation of <b>vesicular</b> <b>mole</b> was done under spinal anesthesia as an emergency procedure. Immediately after evacuation she developed acute massive pulmonary edema with extensive crepitations over both lung fields. She was successfully managed with extensive perioperative management in the form of continuous monitoring, broad spectrum antibiotics, oxygen inhalation, diuretics and she did well postoperatively. She was discharged on 9 th post operative day in satisfactory and stable condition. [Natl J Med Res 2014; 4 (1. 000) : 101 - 103...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{differential}} diagnosis of intramural vascular lesions of the myometrium includes arteriovenous malformation, gestational trophoblastic neoplasia, hemangiomata, sarcoma, and interstitial pregnancy. We present {{a case of}} irregular uterine bleeding after evacuation of <b>vesicular</b> <b>mole.</b> The laboratory investigation showed rising serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin levels (beta HCG). Transvaginal ultrasound and Color Doppler images showed arteriovenous malformation. These data were consistent with persistent mole...|$|E
40|$|AbstractGestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) is a {{term used}} {{for a group of}} pregnancy-related tumors. Gestational trophoblastic {{neoplasia}} (GTN), is recognized as the most curable gynecologic malignancy. However, many cases are resistant to first line chemotherapy. We present cases of invasive mole. They were diagnosed as a <b>vesicular</b> <b>mole</b> on ultrasonography and underwent suction and evacuation but vaginal bleeding recurred with plateau and rising B-hcg with intramyometrial vascular lesion. Hysterectomy was done that indicated invasive mole. Patients were cured of their symptoms. Surgical therapy (hysterectomy) with chemotherapy has shown to achieve remission in these cases especially with resistance to chemotherapy and in perimenopause...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} study of {{fibrinogen}} levels in 133 patients who were prone to develop disseminated intravascular coagulation {{as a result of}} an underlying complication of pregnancy such as abruptio placentae, pregnancy-induced hypertension, missed abortion, septic abortion, intrauterine fetal death, <b>vesicular</b> <b>mole</b> and amniotic fluid embolism. A high incidence of hypofibrinogenemia was found in cases of abruptio placentae (43. 9 &#x 0025;) and pregnancy-induced hypertension (25 &#x 0025;). Hypofibrinogenemia occurred in 10 &#x 0025; cases of intrauterine fetal death within 4 weeks of fetal demise. The use of this simple investigation makes possible the diagnosis of hemostatic failure and also helps to guide replacement therapy during the fibrinopenic state. There were 4 maternal deaths and 12 perinatal losses in this study...|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the pregnancy outcome (fetal and maternal) in women above the age of 35 years in Lower Egypt. Patients and methods: This study was conducted on 5000 pregnant women of those attending outpatient clinicof Banha teaching Hospital, Kalyobia governorate- Lower Egypt. These women were divided into 3 age groups; group 1 with age < 35 years,group 2 with age from 35 - 40 years and group 3 with age more than 40 years. Results:The rate of maternal and neonatal complications at ages 35 - 40 and above 40 years respectively was; abortion 13 %, 14 %, Ectopic pregnancy 0. 6 %, 2 %, <b>vesicular</b> <b>mole</b> 0. 2 %, 0. 5 %, pre-eclampsia 15. 6 %, 26 %, Chronic hypertension 5. 7 %, 28. 5 %, gestational DM 16. 6 %, 16. 5 %, Chronic DM 3. 3 %, 17. 5 %, placental abruption 13. 4 %, 13. 5 %, placenta previa 6. 4 %, 12 %%,PPH 1. 4 % 3. 5 %,C-section 39 %, 63 %...|$|E
