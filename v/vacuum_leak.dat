5000|$|The PCV valve is a {{variable}} orifice {{that controls the}} flow of crankcase fumes, admixed with fresh air admitted to the crankcase by the breather, into the intake tract. With no manifold vacuum, a restrictor—generally a cone or ball—is held by a light spring in a position exposing the full size of the valve's orifice to the intake manifold. With the engine running, the restrictor is drawn towards the orifice by manifold vacuum, restricting the opening proportionate {{to the level of}} engine vacuum vs. spring tension. At idle, manifold vacuum is high, but a large amount of extra air would amount to a <b>vacuum</b> <b>leak,</b> causing the engine to run too lean and/or too fast. So at high manifold vacuum, the PCV valve allows only a low flow rate. This is in accordance with the low volume of crankcase fumes generated at low engine speeds. At higher engine speeds, with less manifold vacuum, the PCV valve permits a greater flow rate {{to keep up with the}} greater volume of crankcase fumes; because of the higher engine speed, a greater amount of [...] "extra" [...] air via the PCV system can be tolerated without upsetting the engine's running. At full throttle, very little manifold vacuum is present, so there is little flow through the PCV valve. However, this is the condition under which the maximum volume of crankcase gas is present. Most of it escapes under its own pressure via the crankcase breather, flowing into the engine's intake tract via the air cleaner.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this program}} {{was to develop a}} 50 MW, {{multiple}} beam klystron at 11. 424 GHz. The device uses eight electron guns and beam lines to achieve the required power level at a beam voltage of 190 kV, consistent with solid state power supplies. The electron gun operates with confined flow focusing, which is unique among current multiple beam sources, and allows operation at power levels consistent with producing 10 s of MWs of pulsed RF power. The circuit consists of a ring resonator input cavity, eight sets of buncher cavities, and a ring resonator output cavity. The RF output power is coupled into four rectangular waveguides equally spaced around the klystron. Eight individual collectors absorb the spent beam power in each beam. The klystron operates in a solenoid. The principle challenges in the design included development of the beam optics using confined flow focusing, shaping of the magnetic field in the gun region to avoid beam spiraling, coupling input power equally to all eight beam lines from a single input, and obtaining the required frequency and Q in the output cavity. The mechanical design was particularly complex due to the large parts count, number of braze and weld joints, and close proximity of the beam lines that limited access.

40|$|Steady state Ion Cyclotron Range of Frequency (ICRF) heating {{technologies}} {{have been developed}} to heat plasma for more than 30 minutes in the Large Helical Device (LHD). Steady state operation tests of high voltage up to 40 kV_ 0 P for more than 30 minutes were carried out on the RF vacuum feedthroughs and the co-axial transmission line in the test set. Four types of ceramic feedthroughs each having a diameter of 240 mm were tested. The cone-type alumina ceramic and the cylinder-type silicon nitride composite-ceramic feedthroughs produced good performances of 40 kV/ 30 minutes and 50 kV/ 10 seconds. The others had <b>vacuum</b> <b>leaks</b> when subjected to a long pulse duration. The temperature of the cone-type alumina ceramic feedthrough was measured during the ICRF operations. By using gas-cooling techniques, the temperature increase of the ceramic was substantially reduced and saturated within 20 minutes. Without any gas-cooling techniques, the temperature increased linearly and did not saturated. Therefore, this approach could not be used for steady state operation. The RF dissipation on the ceramic was calculated using the finite element computer code (ANSYS). It was found that damaged feedthroughs had local high heat spots, which could result in <b>vacuum</b> <b>leaks.</b> A water-cooled co-axial transmission line of 240 mm diameter was designed and tested for steady state operation. The specially designed connector components and Teflon insulator disks were tested. During the test operation, the insulation gases of nitrogen, sulfur hexafluoride and carbon dioxide were used to compare the capability of insulation for steady state. For the duration of a 10 -second pulse, these gases performed well up to 60 kV_ 0 P. However, for steady state operation, carbon dioxide gas could not withstand voltages above 40 kV_ 0 P.
