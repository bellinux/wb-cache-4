In the meantime, the host rock undergoes swelling or shrinking induced by wetting or drying during <b>ventilation</b> <b>or</b> <b>sealing</b> process. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} study the influence of temperature and water content, as well as their coupling effects, on the mechanical behaviour of argillite for the safety of underground disposal of high-level {{radioactive waste}}. For this purpose, we performed classical triaxial compression tests, micro-indentation tests and mini-compression tests on Callovo-Oxfordian (Cox) argillite under both temperature-controlled and relative humidity-controlled condition. Five levels of relative humidity (from 33 to 99 %) and five levels of temperature (from 20 to 95 [*]°C) were studied. The evolutions of elastic modulus, strength and deformability of Cox argillite were related to the temperature and relative humidity. It is found that the mechanical properties of Cox argillite were significantly deteriorated by the temperature and relative humidity, as well as their coupling effects...|$|E
