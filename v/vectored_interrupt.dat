50|$|In {{computer}} science, a <b>vectored</b> <b>interrupt</b> is a processing {{technique in}} which the interrupting device directs the processor to the appropriate interrupt service routine.

5000|$|As an {{asynchronous}} bus, Zorro III specified bus {{cycles of}} set lengths during which a transaction conforming to the specifications {{of the bus}} could be carried out. The initial implementation of Zorro III was in Commodore's [...] "Fat" [...] Buster (BUS conTrollER) gate array, assisted by a very high speed PAL and numerous TTL buffer chips for bus buffering, isolation, and multiplexing. The Amiga 4000 implementation was fundamentally the same, but integrated a second gate-array to replace the TTL buffers. The Buster chip provided bus arbitration, translation between the MC68030 bus protocols and either Zorro II or Zorro III bus cycles (geographically mapped based on the Zorro bus address), and a <b>vectored</b> <b>interrupt</b> mechanism, generally not used. Zorro II bus masters were legal bus hogs, but Zorro III devices were fairly arbitrated and had controller-limited bus tenure.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} process {{interrupt}} events quickly and to handle {{large numbers of}} interrupts can be critical to many embedded systems. The <b>Vectored</b> <b>Interrupt</b> Controller (VIC) is designed to address these requirements. The VIC can provide interrupt performance {{four to five times}} better than the Nios ® II processor’s default internal interrupt controller (IIC). The VIC also allows expansion to a virtually unlimited number of interrupts, through daisy chaining. This document explains how to use the VIC in your hardware design, from both a hardware perspective and a software perspective.

5000|$|An [...] "interrupt vector table" [...] (IVT) is a data {{structure}} that associates {{a list of}} interrupt handlers {{with a list of}} interrupt requests in a table of <b>interrupt</b> <b>vectors.</b> Each entry of the <b>interrupt</b> <b>vector</b> table, called an <b>interrupt</b> <b>vector,</b> is the address of an interrupt handler. While the concept is common across processor architectures, IVTs may be implemented in architecture-specific fashions. For example, a dispatch table is one method of implementing an <b>interrupt</b> <b>vector</b> table.|$|R

50|$|On the PC, the BIOS (and thus also DOS) {{traditionally}} maps {{the master}} 8259 interrupt requests (IRQ0-IRQ7) to <b>interrupt</b> <b>vector</b> offset 8 (INT08-INT0F) and the slave 8259 (in PC/AT and later) interrupt requests (IRQ8-IRQ15) to <b>interrupt</b> <b>vector</b> offset 112 (INT70-INT77). This was done despite the first 32 (INT00-INT1F) <b>interrupt</b> <b>vectors</b> being reserved by the processor for internal exceptions (this was ignored {{for the design}} of the PC for some reason). Because of the reserved vectors for exceptions most other operating systems map (at least the master) 8259 IRQs (if used on a platform) to another <b>interrupt</b> <b>vector</b> base offset.|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} further sophistication of an already complex serial CAMAC control system at Fermilab led to the {{development}} of an Auxilary/Master CAMAC Crate Controller. The controller contains a Motorola 6800 microprocessor, 2 K bytes of RAM, and 8 K bytes of PROM memory. Bussed dataway lines are time shared with CAMAC signals to provide memory expansion and direct addressing of peripheral devices without the need of external cabling. The Auxiliary/Master Crate Controller (A/MCC) can function as either a Master, i. e., stand alone, crate controller or as an Auxiliary controller to Fermilab's Serial Crate Controller (SCC). Two modules, one single- and one double-width, make up an A/ MCC. The microprocessor has one nonmaskable and one maskable <b>vectored</b> <b>interrupt.</b> Time sharing the dataway between SCC programmed and block transfer generated dataway cycles and A/MCC operations still allows a 99 percent microprocessor CPU busy time. Since the conception of the A/MCC, there has been an increasing number of control system-related projects proposed which would not have been possible or would have been very difficult to implement without such a device. The first such application now in use at Fermilab is a stand-alone control system for a mass spectrometer experiment in the Main Ring Internal Target Area. This application in addition to other proposed A/MCC applications, both stand-alone and auxiliary, is discussed. (auth...|$|E
40|$|Static {{checking}} {{can provide}} safe and tight bounds on stack usage and execution times in interrupt-driven systems. This dissertation presents static analysis algorithms and a prototype implementation of those algorithms for statically computing resource bounds in interrupt-driven systems. Advanced knowledge of resource bounds enables real-time system designers to eliminate whole classes of errors from their software before testing begins, {{thereby reducing the}} testing effort necessary to achieve confidence in their system. ^ Despite the ubiquity of hardware interrupts in real-time systems, little prior research has dealt with interrupt-driven software. The benchmark suite of commercially-deployed, interrupt-driven systems examined here includes proprietary Z 86 -based microcontrollers programmed in assembly language with multiple <b>vectored</b> <b>interrupt</b> sources, a shared system stack, extensive use of unstructured loops, and no formal loop annotations. ^ The stack analysis bounds the maximum stack size to within one byte of the true maximum {{in all but one}} of the programs in the benchmark suite. The deadline analysis found firm worst-case latencies in 30 % of the cases; in the remaining 70 % of the benchmarks, the prototype reduced the size of the testing problem by an average of 98 %. While the testing effort still required for these systems is large, it is several orders of magnitude smaller than the testing problem without deadline analysis. ^ This dissertation presents novel algorithms for static analysis in the context of interrupt-driven assembly code. The prototype implementation is one of the first tools to incorporate static analysis with testing oracles in an interactive fashion. ...|$|E

50|$|An input/output device {{determined}} the memory addresses {{to which it}} would respond, and specified its own <b>interrupt</b> <b>vector</b> and <b>interrupt</b> priority. This flexible framework provided by the processor architecture made it unusually easy to invent new bus devices, including devices to control hardware {{that had not been}} contemplated when the processor was originally designed. DEC openly published the basic Unibus specifications, even offering prototyping bus interface circuit boards, and encouraging customers to develop their own Unibus-compatible hardware.|$|R
50|$|VME also decodes {{all seven}} of the 68000's {{interrupt}} levels onto a 7-pin interrupt bus. The interrupt scheme is one of prioritized <b>vectored</b> <b>interrupts.</b> The interrupt request lines (IRQ1 - IRQ7) prioritize interrupts. An interrupting module asserts one of the interrupt request lines. Any module on the bus may potentially handleany interrupt. When an interrupt handling module recognizes an interrupt request at a priority it handles, it arbitrates for the bus in the usual fashion described above. It then performs a read of the <b>interrupt</b> <b>vector</b> by driving the binary version of the IRQ line it handles (e.g. if IRQ5 is being handled, then binary 101) onto the address bus. It also asserts the IACK line, along with the appropriate data transfer strobes for {{the width of the}} status/ID being read. Again, LWORD*, DS0* and DS1* allow status/ID read cycles to be 8, 16, or 32 bit wide transfers but most existing hardware interrupters use 8 bit status/IDs. The interrupter responds by transferring a status/ID on the data bus to describe the interrupt. The interrupt handling module (usually a CPU) will usually use this status/ID number to identify and run the appropriate software interrupt service routine.|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, {{we present}} a design of {{interrupt}} system upon an extensible and reconfigurable VLIW softcore processor: r-VEX. This interrupt system is designed and implemented in four mechanisms to match different application requirements {{in terms of the}} hardware consumption and performance issues (interrupt latency). On the other hand, {{due to the fact that}} the VEX compiler is not an open-source compiler, extra requirements to the assembler are also considered to make our work feasible. Our interrupt system itself can also be parameterized to fit different applications. These parameters include the number of <b>interrupt</b> <b>vectors,</b> <b>interrupt</b> priority of each <b>vector</b> and <b>Interrupt</b> Service Routines (ISRs) location address in the instruction memory. The testing results show that each version of our interrupt system takes reasonable amount of hardware usage. We implemented our interrupt system on a virtex- 6 FPGA. Besides, the interrupt latency can be reduced to only 2 clock cycles which is even better than some RISC-based softcore processors like Microblaze. This project creates a prototype of interrupt system that could work on VLIW softcore processor which extends the functionality and capability of the processor such as running operating systems and establishing a multi-core system.
