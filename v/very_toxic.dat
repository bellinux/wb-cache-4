5|$|Osmium tetroxide {{is highly}} {{volatile}} and penetrates skin readily, and is <b>very</b> <b>toxic</b> by inhalation, ingestion, and skin contact. Airborne low concentrations of osmium tetroxide vapor can cause lung congestion and skin or eye damage, and {{should therefore be}} used in a fume hood. Osmium tetroxide is rapidly reduced to relatively inert compounds by polyunsaturated vegetable oils, such as corn oil.|$|E
5|$|Cerium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ce and atomic number 58. Cerium is a soft, ductile and silvery-white metal that tarnishes {{when exposed to}} air, and it is soft enough to be cut with a knife. Cerium is the second element in the lanthanide series, and while it often shows the +3 oxidation state characteristic of the series, it also exceptionally has a stable +4 state that does not oxidize water. It is also traditionally {{considered one of the}} rare-earth elements. Cerium has no biological role and is not <b>very</b> <b>toxic.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cucurbita {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, {{including}} the Cabbage Moth (Mamestra brassicae), Hypercompe indecisa, and the Turnip Moth (Agrotis segetum). Cucurbita can be susceptible to the pest Bemisia argentifolii (silverleaf whitefly) as well as aphids (Aphididae), cucumber beetles (Acalymma vittatum and Diabrotica undecimpunctata howardi), squash bug (Anasa tristis), the squash vine borer (Melittia cucurbitae), and the twospotted spidermite (Tetranychus urticae). The squash bug causes major damage to plants because of its <b>very</b> <b>toxic</b> saliva.|$|E

50|$|The {{fruit is}} edible in small quantities, {{with a very}} acidic taste; {{it can be used}} to make jelly. It is however <b>very</b> mildly <b>toxic,</b> and may cause {{vomiting}} or diarrhea if eaten in large amounts.|$|R
5|$|The early {{lanthanides}} act {{as essential}} cofactors for the methanol dehydrogenase of the methanotrophic bacterium Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV, for which lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, and neodymium alone are about equally effective. Praseodymium is otherwise {{not known to}} have a biological role in any other organisms, but is not <b>very</b> <b>toxic</b> either. Intravenous injection of rare earths into animals {{has been known to}} impair liver function, but the main side effects from inhalation of rare-earth oxides in humans come from radioactive thorium and uranium impurities.|$|E
5|$|Cerium has {{no known}} {{biological}} role in humans, {{but is not}} <b>very</b> <b>toxic</b> either; it does not accumulate in the food chain to any appreciable extent. Because it often occurs together with calcium in phosphate minerals, and bones are primarily calcium phosphate, cerium can accumulate in bones in small amounts that are not considered dangerous. Cerium, like the other lanthanides, is known to affect human metabolism, lowering cholesterol levels, blood pressure, appetite, and risk of blood coagulation. Cerium nitrate is an effective topical antimicrobial treatment for third-degree burns, although large doses can lead to cerium poisoning and methemoglobinemia. The early lanthanides act as essential cofactors for the methanol dehydrogenase of the methanotrophic bacterium Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum SolV, for which lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, and neodymium alone are about equally effective.|$|E
5|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of selenosis include a garlic odor on the breath, gastrointestinal disorders, hair loss, sloughing of nails, fatigue, irritability, and neurological damage. Extreme cases of selenosis can exhibit cirrhosis of the liver, pulmonary edema, or death. Elemental selenium and most metallic selenides have relatively low toxicities because of low bioavailability. By contrast, selenates and selenites have an oxidant mode of action {{similar to that of}} arsenic trioxide and are <b>very</b> <b>toxic.</b> The chronic toxic dose of selenite for humans is about 2400 to 3000 micrograms of selenium per day. Hydrogen selenide is an extremely toxic, corrosive gas. Selenium also occurs in organic compounds, such as dimethyl selenide, selenomethionine, selenocysteine and methylselenocysteine, all of which have high bioavailability and are toxic in large doses.|$|E
5000|$|Based on {{ecological}} effects, fipronil {{is highly}} toxic to upland game birds on an acute oral basis and <b>very</b> highly <b>toxic</b> on a subacute dietary basis, but is practically nontoxic to waterfowl on both acute and subacute bases.|$|R
50|$|The {{compound}} {{is slightly}} toxic to ducks (LD50 = 1698 mg/kg) and quail (LD50 = 3000 mg/kg). It {{has been found}} non-toxic to bees and <b>very</b> slightly <b>toxic</b> to fish (Rainbow trout LC50 (96 hrs.) = 117 ppm).|$|R
50|$|Sodium azide is the {{inorganic}} compound with the formula NaN3. This colorless salt is the gas-forming component in many car airbag systems.

5|$|The main ore {{of mercury}} is cinnabar, long {{used as a}} pigment by painters. He says that the colour is similar to scolecium, {{probably}} the kermes insect. The dust is <b>very</b> <b>toxic,</b> so workers handling the material wear face masks of bladder skin. Copper and bronze are, says Pliny, most famous for their use in statues including colossi, gigantic statues as tall as towers, the most famous being the Colossus of Rhodes. He personally saw the massive statue of Nero in Rome, which was removed after the emperor's death. The face of the statue was modified shortly after Nero's death during Vespasian's reign, {{to make it a}} statue of Sol. Hadrian moved it, {{with the help of the}} architect Decrianus and 24 elephants, to a position next to the Flavian Amphitheatre (now called the Colosseum).|$|E
25|$|Thiomersal is <b>very</b> <b>toxic</b> by inhalation, ingestion, and {{in contact}} with skin (EC hazard symbol T+), with a danger of {{cumulative}} effects.

25|$|In late 2010, {{the state}} of Minnesota sued 3M, {{claiming}} they released PFCs, a <b>very</b> <b>toxic</b> chemical according to the EPA but unknown {{at the time of}} release, into local waterways.|$|E
25|$|When heated with carbon, the oxide {{is reduced}} to {{antimony}} metal. With other reducing agents such as sodium borohydride or lithium aluminium hydride, the unstable and <b>very</b> <b>toxic</b> gas stibine is produced. When heated with potassium bitartrate, a complex salt potassium antimony tartrate, KSb(OH)2•C4H2O6 is formed.|$|E
25|$|Incineration has {{particularly}} strong {{benefits for the}} treatment of certain waste types in niche areas such as clinical wastes and certain hazardous wastes where pathogens and toxins can be destroyed by high temperatures. Examples include chemical multi-product plants with diverse toxic or <b>very</b> <b>toxic</b> wastewater streams, which cannot be routed to a conventional wastewater treatment plant.|$|E
5|$|Zoo or {{laboratory}} rearing and isolation are important factors leading to increased susceptibility to self-harm in higher mammals, e.g., macaque monkeys. Non-primate mammals are also known to mutilate themselves under laboratory conditions after administration of drugs. For example, pemoline, clonidine, amphetamine, and <b>very</b> high (<b>toxic)</b> doses of caffeine or theophylline {{are known to}} precipitate self-harm in lab animals.|$|R
5000|$|Acute {{studies of}} estuarine animals using oysters, mysids, and {{sheepshead}} minnows show that fipronil is highly acutely toxic to oysters and sheepshead minnows, and <b>very</b> highly <b>toxic</b> to mysids. Metabolites MB 46136 and MB 45950 are more toxic than the parent to freshwater invertebrates (MB 46136 is 6.6 times more toxic and MB 45950 is 1.9 times more toxic to freshwater invertebrates).|$|R
5000|$|In 1911, {{poisoning}} {{by drinking}} Lysol {{was the most}} common means of suicide in Australia.

25|$|While {{the launch}} was successful, ground {{controllers}} lost {{control over the}} USA-193 satellite shortly after it was established on its orbit, and were unable to regain control. The satellite itself posed minimal risk of falling and causing damage. However, the satellite carried hydrazine fuel which is <b>very</b> <b>toxic.</b> In 2008, President George W. Bush decided this risk would be too great and tasked United States Strategic Command to destroy the satellite to preserve human life.|$|E
25|$|Ultimately, the {{infestation}} was eradicated, {{but both}} the Governor's delay and {{the scale of}} the action has remained controversial ever since. Some people claimed that malathion was toxic to humans, as well as insects. In response to such concerns, Brown's chief of staff, B. T. Collins, staged a news conference during which he publicly drank a glass of malathion. Many people complained that, while the malathion may not have been <b>very</b> <b>toxic</b> to humans, the aerosol spray containing it was corrosive to car paint.|$|E
25|$|Sweet {{orange oil}} is a {{by-product}} of the juice industry produced by pressing the peel. It is used for flavoring food and drinks {{and also in the}} perfume industry and aromatherapy for its fragrance. Sweet orange oil consists of approximately 90% D-limonene, a solvent used in various household chemicals, such as wood conditioners for furniture and—along with other citrus oils—detergents and hand cleansers. It is an efficient cleaning agent with a pleasant smell, promoted for being environmentally friendly and therefore, preferable to petrochemicals. D-limonene is, however, classified from slightly toxic to humans, to <b>very</b> <b>toxic</b> to marine life in different countries.|$|E

5000|$|Regulatory {{authorities}} {{describe the}} toxicological database for clothianidin as [...] "extensive", and {{many studies have}} been reviewed to support registrations around the globe for this chemical. Laboratory and field testing revealed that clothianidin shows relatively low toxicity to many test species but is highly or <b>very</b> highly <b>toxic</b> to others.

25|$|Ricin is <b>very</b> <b>toxic</b> if inhaled, injected, or ingested. It {{can also}} be toxic if dust {{contacts}} the eyes {{or if it is}} absorbed through damaged skin. It acts as a toxin by inhibiting protein synthesis. It prevents cells from assembling various amino acids into proteins according to the messages it receives from messenger RNA in a process conducted by the cell's ribosome (the protein-making machinery)—that is, the most basic level of cell metabolism, essential to all living cells and thus to life itself. Ricin is resistant, but not impervious, to digestion by peptidases. By ingestion, the pathology of ricin is largely restricted to the gastrointestinal tract, where it may cause mucosal injuries. With appropriate treatment, most patients will make a decent recovery.|$|E
500|$|Assessing {{the hazard}} {{associated}} with an acid or base may require a knowledge of pKa values. For example, hydrogen cyanide is a <b>very</b> <b>toxic</b> gas, because the cyanide ion inhibits the iron-containing enzyme cytochrome c oxidase. Hydrogen cyanide is a weak acid in aqueous solution with a pKa of about 9. In strongly alkaline solutions, above pH11, say, it follows that sodium cyanide is [...] "fully dissociated" [...] so the hazard due to the hydrogen cyanide gas is much reduced. An acidic solution, on the other hand, is very hazardous because all the cyanide is in its acid form. Ingestion of cyanide by mouth is potentially fatal, independently of pH, because of the reaction with cytochrome c oxidase.|$|E
500|$|The In Rainbows artwork was {{designed}} by Stanley Donwood, {{who has worked with}} Yorke to design Radiohead's album art since 1994. Donwood worked in the studio as Radiohead were working on the album, which allowed the mood of the music to be conveyed in the album artwork, and regularly put up images in the studio and on the studio computer for the band to interact with and comment on. He also posted images daily on the Radiohead website, though none were used in the final album artwork. Donwood experimented with photographic etching, putting prints into acid baths and throwing wax at paper, creating images influenced by NASA space photography. He originally planned to explore suburban life, but realised it did not fit the album, saying [...] "it's a sensual record and I wanted to do something more organic." [...] Describing the album cover, Donwood said: [...] "It's very colourful—I've finally embraced colour! It's a rainbow but it is <b>very</b> <b>toxic,</b> it's more like the sort of one you'd see in a puddle." [...] The band decided not to release the cover for the digital release, preferring to hold it back for the physical release. The [...] "discbox" [...] release of the album includes a booklet containing additional artwork by Donwood.|$|E
