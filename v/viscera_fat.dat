This study aimed to analyze the value of proximate, heavy metal content and fatty acid profile of catfish <b>viscera</b> <b>fat</b> (Pangasius hypopthalmus) and characterized fish oil extracted by dry rendering in various temperature and time than compared it to fish oil extracted by stove heating to obtain the best treatment. Proximate, heavy metal residue, and the fatty acid profile analysis were conducted for characterizing catfish <b>viscera</b> <b>fat.</b> Fish oil extraction was conducted by dry rendering in various temperatures of 50, 60, 70, 80 °C for 1, 2, and 3 hours. Fish oil quality was determined by the chemical characteristics i. e. PV, FFA, anisidin and TOTOX. The results of the study showed that fat content of catfish fat viscera was 88. 19 %, the heavy metals content was below SNI standart to be consumed, and fatty acid profile composition was SFA>MUFA>PUFA. The highest fatty acid content was oleic acid. The best fish oil quality was resulted on temperature extraction of 50 °C for 2 hours with yield value, PV, FFA, anisidin, and TOTOX were 45. 17 %, 2. 77 meq/kg, 0. 83 %, 2. 86 meq/kg, 8. 39 meq/kg respectively.

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} effects of electroacupuncture and diet {{adjusting}} on insulin resistance in rats with nutrition obesity, and the role of electroacupuncture and diet adjusting in the treatment of obesity. Methods: Obesity was induced in rats by high-fat diet. Rats with nutrition obesity were randomly divided into high-fat diet (HD) group, high-fat diet plus electroacupuncture (HA) group, normal diet (ND) group and normal diet plus electroacupuncture (NA) group, with another group of SD rats as normal control (NC). After 15 days, all the rats' body weight and length were measured, the Lee's index was calculated, and the levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), free fatty acid (FFA), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting insulin (FINS) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were detected. Results: Compared with the HD group, food intake, body weight and <b>viscera</b> <b>fat</b> weight of the rats with nutrition obesity in the HA group and the NA group were markedly reduced (P< 0. 05). The levels of blood serum TC, FFA and IR index in the NA group were obviously lower than those in the HD group (P< 0. 01). The levels of TNF-α and FINS in the NA group were lower than those in the HD group (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: Electroacupuncture plus diet adjusting can decrease the levels of serum TNF-α and FINS of the obesity rats, and improve the state of insulin resistanc...|$|E

The {{study was}} conducted to investigate the effects of SR 141716 on body weight gain, body fat, hepatic fat deposit and Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT 1) expression in obese Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats induced by High Fat Diet (HFD). Twenty four SD rats were randomly allocated to three groups: the Normal Diet (ND) as control group, the High Fat Diet (HFD) and SR 141716 treated HFD-diet (SFD) animals as experimental groups. Plasma was collected immediately for following plasma indexes determination. Liver samples were flash frozen in lipid nitrogen and stored at – 80 °C until use for following experiments. Compared with the ND group, HFD significantly increased the body weight gain (p< 0. 05), total <b>viscera</b> <b>fat</b> pad (p< 0. 05) and hepatic Triglyceride (TG) (p< 0. 05) in rats while SR 141716 significantly suppressed these effects (p< 0. 05).

Hepatic CPT 1 and PPARγ mRNA level were significantly suppressed by SR 141716 accompany with CB 1 mRNA expression decrease (p< 0. 05). The results indicated that SR 141716 can significantly suppress the excess hepatic adipose deposit induced by HFD in rats. During this process, the pivotal role of CB 1 in hepatic fat deposit may considerably to a large extent be due to modulation of CPT 1 expression through PPARγ. However, the accurate mechanism remains to be elucidated in the future...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{quantify}} the sequential changes in metabolic response occurring {{in patients with}} severe sepsis after the onset of peritonitis. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Understanding the changes in energy expenditure and body composition {{is essential for the}} optimal management of severely septic patients; however, they have not been quantified in the context of modern surgical care. METHODS: Twelve patients with severe sepsis secondary to peritonitis (median APACHE II score = 21. 5) had measurements of energy expenditure and body composition {{as soon as they were}} hemodynamically stable and 5, 10, and 21 days later. Sequential measurements of acute-phase proteins and cytokine responses were also made. RESULTS: Resting energy expenditure rose to 49 % above predicted and remained elevated throughout the study period. Total energy expenditure was 1. 25 x resting energy expenditure. Body fat was oxidized when energy intake was insufficient to achieve energy balance. There was a positive fluid balance of 12. 5 1 over the first 2 days after onset of sepsis; thereafter, body water changes closely paralleled body weight changes and were largely accounted for by changes in extracellular water. During the 21 -day study period, there was a loss of 1. 21 kg (13 %) of total body protein. During the first 10 days, 67 % of the protein lost came from skeletal muscle, but after this time it was predominantly from viscera. Intracellular potassium levels were low but did not deteriorate further after hemodynamic stability had been reached. There was a reprioritization of hepatic protein synthesis that was obligatory and independent of changes in total body protein. The cytokine responses demonstrated the complexity, redundancy, and overlap of mediators. CONCLUSIONS: The period of hypermetabolism in severely septic patients is similar to that previously described, but the fluid changes are larger and the protein loss is greater. Protein loss early on is predominantly from muscle, thereafter from <b>viscera.</b> <b>Fat</b> loss can be prevented and cell function preserved once hemodynamic stability is achieved...|$|E

Computed {{tomography}} (CT) of intra‐abdominal tissue has {{not been}} thoroughly evaluated to establish associations with the occurrence of complications after PD. The current study sought to determine whether differences in non‐enhanced visceral attenuation predicted complications after PD. MethodsOutcomes in patients undergoing PD were analysed according to the Clavien system for classifying complications and the International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula system for classifying postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF). Preoperative non‐enhanced CT scans were evaluated by a blinded investigator for attenuation of abdominal <b>viscera</b> and <b>fat</b> thickness. Data on pancreatic firmness and pancreatic duct size were collected. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. ResultsA total of 134 patients underwent PD for malignant and benign disease. Rates of morbidity, mortality and POPF at 90 days were 61 %, 4 % and 23 %, respectively. Patients with a body mass index of > 25 [*]kg/m 2 had higher rates of POPF (P = 0. 05) and complications (P < 0. 01). In multivariate analysis, patients {{were more likely to}} develop any complication as CT attenuation decreased for paraspinus muscle (P < 0. 01), spleen (P < 0. 03) and liver (P = 0. 01) parenchyma. ConclusionsPostoperative complications after PD remain prevalent. Decreased CT attenuation of abdominal viscera is an independent predictor of morbidity after PD and suggests a high‐risk patient physiology for pancreatic resection...|$|R
60|$|It is not {{surprising}} that domestic races should generally present a different aspect from natural species. Man selects and propagates modifications solely for his own use or fancy, and not for the creature's own good. His attention is struck by strongly marked modifications, which have appeared suddenly, due to some great disturbing cause in the organisation. He attends almost exclusively to external characters; and when he succeeds in modifying internal organs,--when for instance he reduces the bones and offal, or loads the <b>viscera</b> with <b>fat,</b> or gives early maturity, etc.-the chances are strong that he will at the same time weaken the constitution. On the other hand, when an animal has to struggle throughout its life with many competitors and enemies, under circumstances inconceivably complex and liable to change, modifications of the most varied nature in the internal organs as well as in external characters, in the functions and mutual relations of parts, will be rigorously tested, preserved, or rejected. Natural selection often checks man's comparatively feeble and capricious attempts at improvement; and if it were not so, the result of his work, and of nature's work, would be even still more different. Nevertheless, we must not overrate the amount of difference between natural species and domestic races; the most experienced naturalists have often disputed whether the latter are descended from one or from several aboriginal stocks, and this clearly shows that there is no palpable difference between species and races.|$|R

Orlopp 91 tom turkeys were fed diets containing 2 percent added fat (control), 4 percent added fat (energy/protein ratio constant with the control), 6 percent added fat (energy/protein ratio constant with the control), and a diet containing 6 percent added fat with a higher energy/protein ratio than the control. Data collected in the study showed that the percent fat in the dry matter of the turkey carcass increased more as a result of increasing the nutrient density of the diet than by increasing the diet energy level alone. This finding is contrary to current feeding assumptions which state that carcass composition should not be affected by energy level if a constant energy/protein ratio is maintained. The most significant effects of added dietary fat on turkey carcass composition occurred in the viscera and the skin.

40|$|A dynamic {{mechanistic}} model {{was developed for}} growing and fattening pigs. The aim of the model was to predict growth rate and the chemical and anatomical body compositions from the digestible nutrient intake of gilts (20 - 105 kg live weight). The model represents the partitioning of digestible nutrients from intake through intermediary metabolism to body protein and body fat. State variables of the model were lysine, acetyl-CoA equivalents, glucose, volatile fatty acids and fatty acids as metabolite pools, and protein in muscle, hide-backfat, bone and <b>viscera</b> and body <b>fat</b> as body constituent pools. It was assumed that fluxes of metabolites follow saturation kinetics depending on metabolite concentrations.

When the rate of growth in the weights of several tissues was compared with each other as an increase rate of weights of the birth, the results at 26 weeks old were as follows: In the male, these became larger in the following order : 37. 7 times of viscera, 95. 6 times of total bone, 1. 37 times of skin, 150 times of total fat and 227 times of total muscle, and in the female, 44. 6 times of viscera, 47. 0 times of total bone, 78. 8 times of skin, 125 times of total muscle and 210 times of total fat. From these results mentioned above, we suppose the skeletal muscle is the late-maturing tissue. Because the abdominal fat was weighed primarily at 2 weeks old, the increase rate of it was not compared with the other directly. But, the abdominal fat of the male and the female increased 84. 1 times and 134 times respectively between 2 and 26 weeks old. These results indicate the abdominal fat is also late-maturing. 3. The total muscle weight of the male was about 28 % of dressing body weight during the first 1 week. It increased gradually to 51. 1 % at 22 weeks old, and 57. 2 % at 26 weeks old. On the other hand, those of the female increased from about 25 - 27 % of dressing body weight at hatching or 1 week old to 49. 2 % at 22 weeks old, but decreased to 43. 3 % at 26 weeks old conversely. This sexual difference is an interesting consequence. RIR種雌雄を使用して,他の諸組織の成長と比較して骨格筋の成長はどのような関係にあるのか,また,その雌雄間における相違について検討し,若干の成果を得た. 重量測定にあたつては,まず生体重ならびに裸体重を求め,さらに皮膚,内臓,腹腔内脂肪,総骨,総脂肪ならびに総筋肉の各重量を求めた. これらの組織相互の成長を比較し,その結果は次の通りであつた. 1. 生体重ならびに裸体重は初生時においては,雌の方が雄より重かつたが, 1 週齢以後は雄の方が常に重く,成長における雌雄の相違は 1 週齢から明らかであつた. 裸体重が生体重に占める割合は初生時から 2 ～ 3 週齢まで急速に増えた. その後は比較的一定した値を示したが,性成熟完成後には雌の方が雄よりも明らかに大きかつた. 2. 諸器官の間で 26 週齢の初生時に対する増量度を比較すると,雄では内臓の 37. 7 倍が最小で,次いで総骨の 95. 6 倍,皮膚の 137 倍,総脂肪の 150 倍が続き,総筋肉の 227 倍がもつとも大きかつた. 一方,雌でもやはり内臓が最小で 44. 6 倍,次いで総骨の 47. 0 倍,皮膚の 78. 8 倍,総筋肉の 125 倍が続き,総脂肪の 210 倍が最大であつた. これらの事実から骨格筋は成長の完成が遅い組織であることが明らかである. 腹腔内脂肪については, 2 週齢以後測定したので,直接比較できないが, 2 週齢を基準とした値は雄で 84. 1 倍,雌で 134 倍であるので,総脂肪より高い倍率になると思われる. 3. 総筋肉は初生時ならびに 1 週齢に雄は裸体重のほぼ 28 %程度であるが, 26 週齢には 57. 2 %を占めるようになる. 一方,雌においては,初生時ならびに 1 週齢には裸体重の 25 ～ 27 %を占め, 22 週齢で 49. 2 %の最高値を示す. その後 26 週齢には 43. 3 %に低下しているが,これは性成熟完成期と一致している. しかし,雄においては逆に 22 週齢の 51. 1 %から 26 週齢の 57. 2 %へ急速な増加を示していることは興味ある結果である...|$|R

The following parts were weighed; live body, <b>fat,</b> skin, <b>viscera,</b> abdominal <b>fat,</b> bone, intermuscular fat and skeletal muscle. The resu 1 ts obtained were as follows: 1. Sex differences of the live weight was a little {{at the age of}} zero week, and not recognized at one week. It was led to an apparent increase, however, after two weeks of age, particularly in the period from 10 to 20 weeks in advantage of the male. The live weight of the male was by about 700 g heavier than that of the female at the age of 31 weeks. 2. The skeletal muscle is a late-maturing organ, because the muscle weight expressed as the relative increase from zero to 31 weeks of age is about twice as large as that of the live weight. However, the skeletal muscle matured earlier than the abdominal fat in both sexes. In the female, it also matured earlier than the intermuscular fat and skin. 3. The muscle weight showed a rapid rate of increase from zero to two weeks of age, and it increased its initial weight by 4. 7 times in the male and 4. 6 times in the female for the two weeks. The growth rate of the muscle per week was the largest at the age of about 10 weeks, and larger until about 20 weeks of age. 4. Sex difference in the gain of the musc 1 e weight was only a little until two weeks of age, but became conspicuous gradually from two to 18 weeks. It was apparent from 18 to 25 weeks of age, and the most conspicuous from 25 to 31 weeks. The difference of the muscle weight between both sexes was about 450 g at the age of 25 weeks and about 590 g at 31 weeks in the advantage of the male, respectively. 5. The muscle of the male showed a larger percentage of the live weight than that of the female after the age of 18 weeks. The difference in the percentage of the muscle weight to the live weight between both sexes was 8. 0 % at the age of 25 weeks and 11. 2 % at 31 weeks. The percentage of the muscle weight to the live weight showed a rapid increasing rate from the age of zero to two weeks in both sexes. 6. The viscera matured most early among these six body components examined; the bone came second; next in order were the skin, the intermuscular fat and the muscle in the male, while the muscle, the skin and the intermuscular fat in the female. The abdominal fat matured most late among these six components in both sexes. 本研究はBPR種を用いて骨格筋の成長を検討し,また,それと他の諸器官の成長との比較を行ない,併せて雌雄間における相違についても検討した. 重量測定にあたつては,まず生体重を求め,さらに皮膚,内臓,腹脂肪,骨,筋間脂肪ならびに骨格筋の各重量を求めた. これらの発達を検討した結果の大要は次のとおりであつた. (1) 生体重は初生時には雄が雌よりやや大きいが, 1 週齢で雌雄間の差はまつたくなくなつた. その後の増加は雄の方が雌より大きく,とくに 10 週齢から 20 週齢にかけて著しい差があつた. その結果, 31 週齢には雄は雌より約 700 g重くなつた. (2) 総筋肉量の初生時に対する 31 週齢の増加度は生体重のそれの約 2 倍であり,骨格筋は晩熟型の器官であるといえる. しかし,雄では腹脂肪より,また,雌では腹脂肪のほかに筋間脂肪および皮膚などよりはなお早熟であつた. (3) 骨格筋の成長は第I期で著しく,その 2 週間に雄は 4. 7 倍,雌は 4. 6 倍に成長した. しかし,週間増加量がもつとも大きかつたのは 10 週齢前後で,その後も 20 週齢頃までは大きかつた. (4) 総筋肉量の雌雄間の差は,第Ｉ期には判然としないが,第II期になるとしだいに大きくなつた. 第III期では雌雄間の骨格筋の成長差が顕著で, 25 週齢には雄の総筋肉量が雌のそれより約 450 g重くなつた. 第IV期には骨格筋の成長は緩やかになるが,なお雌雄間の成長差は大きく, 31 週齢には雄の総筋肉量は雌のそれより約 590 g重くなつた. (5) 総筋肉量の生体重比(％) は第I期の 2 週間に顕著な増加を示した. また,第II期までは総筋肉量の生体重比(％) に雌雄間の差がなかつたが,第III期には難雄間の差は歴然とし,雄のそれは大きくなつたのに対し,雌では逆に小さくなつた.

The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the efficiency of composting on the treatment and recycling of solid waste from poultry slaughterhouse. The solid waste was from a commercial poultry slaughterhouse and was composed of <b>viscera,</b> muscle, <b>fat,</b> bone, blood and feathers that was mixed with a source of carbon, rice husk. Initially, a windrow with a volume of 1. 5 m(3) was built, and then some parameters were monitored: temperature, total solids (TS), volatile (VS), N, P, K, organic carbon (C), composting organic matter (COC), organic matter resistant to composting (MORC), chemical oxygen demand (COD), mass and volume of the windrow, most probable number (MPN) of total and fecal coliforms, as well as their reductions during the process. The maximum temperature reached in the center of the windrow was 53. 3 degrees C (weekly average) since reductions of weight of TS and VS and volume during the pre-composting were 36. 1, 44. 3 and 23. 3 %, respectively and during the composting process was 21. 8, 23. 8 and 4. 4 %. The low volume reduction can be associated with high concentrations of MORC (40. 1 %) which can be mainly related to the quality of the carbon source. The process produced satisfactory total reductions of TS, VS and volume that were respectively, 50. 1, 57. 5 and 26. 7 %. However reductions were observed in 43 % of amount of nitrogen in the final compound. Despite reductions in nitrogen content, composting proved to be an effective method in the treatment of solid waste from poultry slaughterhouse. Em virtude da grande demanda por proteína de origem animal, tem-se aumentado a produção de frangos de corte e consequentemente a geração de resíduos provenientes do abate de aves, sendo necessário o desenvolvimento de técnicas que permitam o aproveitamento e reciclagem desses materiais.

A temperatura máxima atingida no centro da leira foi de 53, 3 ºC (média semanal), já as reduções de massa de ST e SV e volume durante o processo de pré-compostagem foram de 36, 1; 44, 3 e 23, 3 %, respectivamente, e, durante o processo de compostagem, foram de 21, 8; 23, 8 e 4, 4 %. A baixa redução do volume das leiras pode estar associada à alta concentração de MORC (40, 1 %) que pode ser principalmente relacionada à qualidade da fonte de carbono.

40|$|Prediction of pig {{performance}} from data on nutrient intake and animal properties {{makes it easier}} to obtain a better productivity. It provides tools to arrive at desired outputs, or to calculate required inputs. Thus it enables production to be flexible, safe and less erratic. It is to be expected that the results will give a more profitable pig production. In practice, different types of models are used, mostly by feed producers, but also in farm management programmes. Each of these existing models was designed to meet a certain objective. The classification of different types of models, and the benefits of using them, are presented in the literature overview of the thesis. After a general overview of modelling, a critical evaluation was provided on existing models. It was concluded from the literature, that a comprehensive model, which predicts the chemical composition {{in different parts of the}} body, like in lean or in the meat, does not exist. It was also concluded that mechanistic approach should be used to modelling growth. The conceptual basis of a mechanistic model was developed in accordance with basic properties of protein and lipid metabolism. Since nutrients are almost exclusively absorbed in the hydrolyzed form, simulation of use of nutrients for growth should, at least to some extent, make use of biochemical pathways. Therefore, a biological approach to simulation of anatomical body composition is pretended as it follows nutrients from ingestion through intermediary metabolism to deposition as body fat and protein, preferably in distinct tissues or tissue groups. Prediction of anatomical body composition therefore has to be based on deposition of the chemical entities. Therefore the scope of the present thesis was 1) to develop a mechanistic-dynamic model for growing and fattening pigs which predicts anatomical and chemical body composition at slaughter; 2) to determine which model parameters are sensitive to changes in the model; 3) to determine the model accuracy by quantitative and qualitative prediction of the model tested with independent data; 4) to complete an experiment to define fat production potential of different energy sources at low and high feeding levels, and 5) to study the effect of different energy sources at two feeding levels on the distribution of fat deposition during the fattening period. The thesis presents both the description and the evaluation of the growth model. It was concluded that the developed model predicts growth rate as well as chemical and anatomical body compositions of gilts in the 20 - 105 kg live weight range, from nutrient intake. The model represents partitioning of nutrients from feed intake through intermediary metabolism to synthesis of body protein and body fat. State variables of the model are lysine, acetyl-CoA equivalents, glucose, VFA, and fatty acids as metabolite pools, as well as protein in muscle, hide, bone and <b>viscera</b> and body <b>fat</b> as body constituent pools. It is assumed that fluxes of metabolites follow saturation kinetics depending on metabolite concentrations. Anatomical body composition is predicted from chemical body composition and accretion. Partitioning of protein, fat, water and ash into muscle, organs, hide and bone fractions are described by allometric equations, driven by rates of muscle protein and body fat deposition. Two experiments were used in the model calibration process, one with 95 growing pigs (20 - 45 kg) fed different ileal digestible lysine intakes at two feeding levels, and another with 100 growing and fattening pigs (20 - 105 kg), which received different energy intakes. Differential equations were solved numerically for a given set of initial conditions and parameter values. The integration interval used was 0. 01 day, with the fourth-order fixed-step-length Runge-Kutta algorithm. The muscle protein and body fat deposition rates were considered in different weight ranges and for the whole fattening period. Results presented were not sensitive to small changes in initial conditions, or to smaller integration step sizes. In the model evaluation the predicted response of the pigs to changes in model parameters, and to changes in nutrient intakes, are shown. As a result of the sensitivity analysis, the model was responsive to changes in a number of the model parameters examined. Changes in maintenance energy requirements, and the fractional degradation rate of muscle protein, have the largest impact on tissue deposition rates. The model is highly sensitive to changes in the maximal velocity and steepness parameter of lysine utilisation for muscle protein synthesis. Those parameters which directly affect the size of the lysine pool generally have a considerable influence on model predictions. Furthermore, it should be noted that results of this sensitivity analysis depend on nutrient intakes of the reference simulation. The model was relatively insensitive to changes of parameters regarding energy metabolism. It was concluded that the probable reason was that protein and/or lysine was more limiting within the simulated conditions. The model was further tested by independent published data. In general, the model satisfactorily predicted qualitative pig responses to a wide range of variations in nutrient supply. The predicted chemical and anatomical body composition, and also the distribution of protein and fat, were satisfactory in model testing. In most cases, errors in the predicted parameters attributed to the deviation of the regression slope were minor. It was assumed that the major factors contributing to the relatively large bias, observed for most predicted growth characteristics, was variation in pig performance among genotypes, or differences in environmental conditions. Based on the comparison of model simulations with independent data sets, it was recommended to improve the model regarding prediction of protein and fat deposition rates from nutrient intake of different energy sources. It was found that literature data on the effect of different energy sources on fat deposition was limited. In non-protein energy fraction of the diet, dietary lipids, starch and rapidly fermentable non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) are major energy sources. Lipids are absorbed as long-chain fatty acids and starch as glucose. Dietary NSP is fermented and the short-chain fatty acids produced enter intermediary metabolism as an energy source. Equal intakes of energy from glucose, long-chain fatty acids and short-chains fatty acids might result in different fat deposition rates, and quite likely, result in different distributions of body fat over the tissues. There is, however, little quantitative data available on effects of energy source on partitioning of body lipids. Therefore a fattening trial was completed to: 1) study the effect of extra energy intake from fermentable NSP, digestible starch and digestible fat used for fat deposition under protein limiting conditions; 2) determine the location of the fat deposition resulting from extra intake fermentable NSP, digestible starch and digestible fat; 3) determine if the extra fat deposition from different energy sources depends on the level of feed intake, and 4) quantify potential interactions between feed intake level and energy source on the location of extra body fat deposition. A total of 58 hybrid individually housed pigs were used in the trial with an initial body weight of 48 ± 4 kg. The experimental treatments were arranged in a 3 x 2 factorial design, with three energy sources (i. e. fermentable NSP, digestible starch and digestible fat, all added to a control diet) at each of two energy levels. Within each energy level, daily nutrient intakes were the same with regard to digestible protein, ileal digestible lysine and other amino acids, vitamins and minerals. Treatments had an isocaloric proportion of daily nutrient intake derived from each energy source (0. 2 MJ DE/kg 0. 75), in addition to the nutrients from control diet. It was equal with 11 g/kg 0. 75 highly fermentable NSP, 11 g/kg 0. 75 starch or 5 g/kg 0. 75 digestible fat daily. The DE intakes were 2. 0 and 3. 0 maintenance requirement in control groups. The additional energy from different sources increased DE intake up to 2. 4 and 3. 4 times maintenance requirement at low and high feeding levels, respectively. To obtain   initial values, ten pigs were slaughtered at 48 ± 4 kg and the treatment pigs at 106 ± 3 kg body weight. Each body was dissected into four fractions being: 1) lean, 2) organs, 3) hide and subcutaneous fat, and 4) offal. Chemical body composition was determined in each body fraction. The differences between fat deposition of body parts in the control group, and the other treatments, resulted in the additional energy derived from each energy source. As a conclusion from the study, under protein limiting conditions, extra energy intake from fermentable NSP, digestible starch and digestible fat resulted in similar fat deposition. Preferential deposition of extra energy intake in various fat depots did not depend on the energy source. The extra fat deposition from fermentable NSP, digestible starch and digestible fat deposited as body fat was similar at both the low and high levels of feed intake. In the General Discussion, some consequences of the mechanistic approach were discussed and then substantial attention was devoted to the practical aspects of the model. The later part of the General Discussion focuses on representation of different energy sources as an aspect of the model. The energetic efficiency of the different dietary energy sources is discussed, based on data from Chapter 6. The growth model is further evaluated by results of the fattening study. Moreover, data from the fattening study are analysed regarding the distribution of fat deposition. Consequences of the fattening study on the model is discussed regarding the effect of energy sources on energetic efficiency, and on location of fat deposition in the pig. Finally, a new application of the present model is introduced in addition to development of feeding strategies and identifying research priorities...|$|R
