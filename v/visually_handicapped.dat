Products which were designed and {{market for the}} disable are broad, so {{it is important to}} consider quality product for the disabled people. Users (visually impaired) are considered significant users as they cannot see like the normal people.

In the area of remediation, {{the program for the}} educable mentally handicapped was improved while programs for the multi-handicapped, educable/trainable, learning disabled, behaviorally and emotionally <b>handicapped,</b> <b>visually</b> and physically impaired were added. Title I Reading was added in 1978 and a Competency Remediation Lab followed passage of the North Carolina Competency requirement. Opportunities for the academically talented were also improved. Students were able to begin their college-bound English as freshmen. Since 1974, seniors have been able to take Advanced Placement English. The Mathematics Department offered the traditional courses in algebra and geometry as well as two courses in advanced math, and in 1973, it added Advanced Placement Calculus. In 1980, the Science Department expanded its college preparatory courses from five to six when it included Advanced Placement Biology. In 1981, the Social Studies Department expanded its program to include Advanced Placement American History.

40|$|D. Ed. (Educational Psychology) Particular {{prominence}} {{has been}} given worldwide since the 1920 's to educational assistance for handicapped pupils. From the 1930 's in South Africa attention {{has been given}} to the <b>visually,</b> hearing and,intellectually <b>handicapped</b> by means of specialized teaching, but after the appearance of the Murray Report (1969) specific aid has been given to learning disabled pupils to a greater degree. This assistance has been aimed almost only at the primary school pupil and a good many pupils enter the secondary school with unsolved specific learning problems. Such pupils generally exhibit specific characteristics such as amongst others, a poor self-image, poor interpersonal relations, failure orientation, a high anxiety level and general lack of motivation [...] They generally maintain unsound relationships with their parents because such parents often do not understand their child's problems and consequently become disappointed in their apparently normal child's inability to progress scholastically according to his ability. To assist the learning disabled pupil to realise his potential to the best of his ability, a motivation programme has been compiled and used to raise his learning and achievement motivation. This programme is devised with a clear image of the learning disabled pupil in mind and also by applying the essentials of motivation. The motivation programme is devised around the theme: "I am a winner" whereby an attempt is made to raise the self concept to the central variable. are applicable: Additional to this, strategies like the following Realistic setting of goals; A positive attitude to life; The experience and acceptance of success and failure; Correct study methods...|$|R

The Adult Services Division of the American Library Association has adopted a statement accepting “The Library’s Responsibility to the Aging ” because of the “social, economic, and biologic problems resulting from the process of aging. ”z The full statement appears in the Javelin paper in this issue. Yet we all know library users over the magic age of 65 who are well and active, and in no need of services different from those provided for other adults. As one looks at what many libraries consider their services for the aging, confusion arises with services for the ill and the <b>visually</b> and physically <b>handicapped,</b> many of whom do not fall into the 65 -and-over age bracket. Less than 20 percent of the public library systems in the United States offer services specifkally for the aging or services in which {{more than half of the}} participants are 65 or ~lder, ~ possibly because the older persons seen most are those who show little evidence of “the problems resulting from the-aging process. ” The 1971 National Survey of Library Services to the Aging estimated that there are almost 4 million potential users among the aging whose need for extension services is unmet, more than 2 million whose need for group services is unmet, and almost 2 million whose need for special materials i...|$|R
