40|$|A {{finite element}} method for {{computing}} viscous incompressible flows based on the gauge formulation introduced in [Weinan E, Liu J-G. Gauge method for viscous incompressible flows. Journal of Computa-tional Physics (submitted) ] is presented. This formulation replaces the pressure by a <b>gauge</b> <b>variable.</b> This new <b>gauge</b> <b>variable</b> is a numerical tool and differs from the standard <b>gauge</b> <b>variable</b> that arises from decomposing a compressible velocity field. It has the advantage that an additional boundary condition can be assigned to the <b>gauge</b> <b>variable,</b> thus eliminating {{the issue of a}} pressure boundary condition associated with the original primitive variable formulation. The computational task is then reduced to solving standard heat and Poisson equations, which are approximated by straightforward, piecewise linear (or higher-order) finite elements. This method can achieve high-order accuracy at a cost compara-ble with that of solving standard heat and Poisson equations. It is naturally adapted to complex geometry and it is much simpler than traditional {{finite element method}}s for incompressible flows. Several numerical examples on both structured and unstructured grids are presented. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. KEY WORDS: gauge method; finite element method; incompressible flo...|$|R

40|$|The {{individuation}} of point-events and the Hamiltonian way {{of distinguishing}} gravitational from inertial effects in general relativity are discussed. The {{fact that both}} particle physics and all the approaches to gravity make use of variational principles employing singular Lagrangians [1] has the consequence that the Euler-Lagrange equations cannot be put in normal form, {{some of them may}} be non independent equations (due to the contracted Bianchi identities) and a subset of the original configuration <b>variables,</b> the <b>gauge</b> <b>variables,</b> are left completely undetermined. This leads to the necessity of a division of the initial configuration variables of any model in two groups: i) the arbitrary non determined gauge variables; ii) the gauge-invariant observables with a deterministic evolution.

A detailed analysis of non-perturbative dynamics associated with such exceptional field configurations within Coulomb- and axial gauge is described. We present evidence that compact variables generate confinement-like phenomena in both gauges and point out the deficiencies in achieving a satisfactory non-perturbative treatment concerning all <b>variables.</b> <b>Gauge</b> fixed formulations are shown to constitute also a useful framework for phenomenological studies.

Only at the Hamiltonian level it is possible to separate the <b>gauge</b> <b>variables</b> from the deterministic physical degrees of freedom, the Dirac observables, and to formulate a well posed Cauchy problem for them both in special and general relativity. Then the requirement of causality dictates the choice of retarded solutions at the classical level. However both the problems of the classical theory of the electron, leading to the choice of 1 2 (retarded + advanced) solutions, and the regularization of quantum field teory, leading to the Feynman propagator, introduce anticipatory aspects. The determination of the relativistic Darwin potential as a semi-classical approximation to the Lienard-Wiechert solution for particles with Grassmann-valued electric charges, regularizing the Coulomb self-energies, shows that these anticipatory effects live beyond the semi-classical approximation (tree level) under the form of radiative corrections, at least for the electro-magnetic interaction.
