40|$|Chatter in {{machining}} process {{is one of}} the common failures of a production line. For a cantilever tool, such as a boring bar, the rule of thumb requires the overhang length of the tool to be less than 4 times the diameter. The reason is because longer overhang will induce severe tool vibration in the form of chatter during machining. When a longer overhang than 4 times diameter is necessary for performing special machining operations, damping methods are needed to suppress tool chatter. One of the methods is the constrained layer damping method. Materials, such viscoelastic material, are applied in the <b>vibration</b> <b>node</b> regions of the structure to absorb the concentrated vibration strain energy and transform the mechanical energy to heat. With a cantilever tool clamped in a tool holder, the clamping interface is usually the <b>vibration</b> <b>node</b> region. The friction in the joint interface with low normal pressure became another source of damping and can be used for tool chatter suppression in mechanical structures. Joint interfaces are well known to possess normal pressure dependent stiffness and damping. The normal pressure’s effect on the structures frequency response function had been observed by H. Åkesson [1] et al, and L. Mi [2] et al. However, the direct effect of the joint interface normal pressure on {{machining process}} stability hasn’t been investigated. In this paper, a cantilever tool with 6. 5 overhang length to diameter ratio is investigated. The direct effect of the tool clamping interface’s normal pressure on the machining process stability is studied. Three different levels of clamping normal pressure are tested with an internal turning process. The machining results indicate another adaptable solution on shop floor for suppressing tool chatter.

Time averaged optical holography is used for the detection of mechanical defects, or damage, in various aerospace components. The damage is detected by measuring an alteration in structural dynamics, which is visually apparent when using time-averaged holography.

The natural heterogeneities in wood are oriented in a volume. However, one- dimensional models are still used in dynamic characterization of wooden beams. The {{aim of this study}} was to experimentally investigate the effects of the orientation and position of an artificial defect on the flexural vibration frequencies. Different batches of Fagus orientalis specimens were drilled in the radial direction at five positions along the specimen. Dynamic tests in free flexural vibration were performed on the specimens before and after drilling both in the longitudinal-radial (LR) and longitudinal-tangential (LT) bending plan. The behavior in free flexural vibration was found to be different depending on the position and orientation of heterogeneity.

Scanning laser vibrometry was used to measure the movement of the tip and to locate <b>vibration</b> <b>nodes</b> / anti-nodes at different generator power settings and contact loads (100 g and 200 g). Cavitation mapping was performed with luminol solution and recorded with a digital camera (Canon EOS 30 D).

The ultrasonic scaler has a free antinode at the tip, which gives the highest displacement amplitude, with a second antinode located approximately 9. 1 mm further up the tip. The emission of luminol recorded during operation indicated high cavitational activity occurred mainly around the second antinode of the probe with little or no activity at the tip. These emissions changed in intensity during loading of the tip. Mapping of the cavitation was confirmed by daylight stereomicroscope photography.

To address the need to improve precision and efficiency, a study is carried out on the proportion of a mixed model and the length of a 3 D stern cabin model to investigate the natural frequency of a ship. Using the FE method, different types of model are established for a research vessel, including six mixed models that are used for the basis of a detailed discussion on the different proportions of mixed models, and five stern cabin models that are used to analyze the impact of the modeling range on the natural frequency. Moreover, the Lewis method and virtual mass method are both used to consider the impact of outside water in the analysis of the wet mode. It is observed that the results of the calculated natural frequency of the mixed models are approximately the same when the proportion of the mixed models is over 1 / 5 the length of the ship, and in good agreement with the results of the calculations when the modeling range of the stern cabin models is exactly in the vicinity of the <b>vibration</b> <b>node</b> of the ship.

This project used the accelerometer to measures vibration and proper acceleration. The mounting of an accelerometer is easy but it is location must be carefully chosen.

The joint system employs a spring loaded internal latch mechanism housed in the CEJB. During mating, this mechanism is {{pushed away from the}} NJB and enters the NJB when mating is completed. In order to lock the joint and add a preload across the tongue and groove faces, an operating ring collar is rotated through 45 deg causing an internal mechanism to compress a Belleville washer preload mechanism.

In order to prevent inadvertent disassembly, a secondary lock is also engaged when the joint is closed. Plungers are carried in the operating ring collar. When the joint is closed, the plungers fall into tracks on the CEJB, which allows the joint to be opened only when the operating ring collar and plungers are pushed directly away from the joining end.

Protocols like WiFi HaLow, Bluetooth low energy (BLE), ZigBee and Thread are more suitable for long-term non-critical CM battery powered nodes as they provide inherent merits like low cost, self-organising network, and low power consumption. WirelessHART and ISA 100. 11 a provide more reliable and robust performance but their solutions are usually more expensive, thus they are more suitable for strict industrial control applications. Distributed computation can utilise the limited bandwidth of wireless network and battery life of sensor nodes more wisely.
