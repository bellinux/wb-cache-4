Shortly after that, the Steelers ran away with the game and the Jaguars lost 26-21. The Jaguars went on to lose eight of their remaining eleven games in the season.|$|E

When the Celts were near Telamon in Etruria, their advanced foragers encountered the advance guard of Gaius and were made prisoners. On being examined by the Consul they narrated all that had recently occurred and told him of the presence of the two armies, stating that the Gauls were quite near and Lucius behind them. The news surprised him but at the same time made him <b>very</b> <b>hopeful,</b> as he thought he had caught the Gauls on the march between the two armies. He ordered his Tribunes to put the legions in fighting order and to advance thus at marching pace in so far as the nature of the ground allowed the attack in line. He himself had happily noticed a hill situated above the road by which the Celts must pass, and taking his cavalry with him, advanced at full speed, being anxious to occupy the crest of the hill before their arrival and be the first to begin the battle, feeling certain that thus he would get the largest share of credit for the result.|$|E

500|$|Forgoing {{the closure}} favored by its contemporaries, Changelings final {{sequence}} reflects Collins' renewed hope that Walter is alive. The shot is a {{two and a}} half minute sequence showing Collins' walking off to become lost in a crowd. The sequence is representative of the range of effects that feature throughout the film; Los Angeles is presented as major character, brought to life by unobtrusive peripheral imagery that allows the viewer to focus on the story and the emotional cues. The [...] "hustle and bustle" [...] of the sequence was required to convey that downtown Los Angeles in 1935 was a congested urban center. In the closing shot, the camera tilts up to reveal miles of city blocks, pedestrians on the streets, cars going by and streetcars running along their tracks. The version of the film that screened at Cannes did not include this sequence; the scene faded to black as Collins walked away. The new 4,000-frame shot was Owens' idea. He felt the abrupt cut to black pulled the viewer out of the film too quickly, and that it left no room for emotional reflection. Owens said, [...] "There is a legend at the end before the credits. The legend speaks to what happened after the fact, and I think you need to just swallow that for a few moments with the visual still with you." [...] Owens told Eastwood the film should end like Chinatown(1974), in which the camera lifts to take in the scene: [...] "The camera booms up and she walks away from us from a very emotional, poignant scene at the end, walks away into this mass of people and traffic. It's <b>very</b> <b>hopeful</b> and sad at the same time." ...|$|E

Sen at 0 r Marigene ValiÂ­quette's mother, Mrs. Charles F. Valiquette, was one who waited, with rosary in hand, for a call from her daughter, who introduced the bill to have the ERA ratified in Ohio. Senator Valiquette said, "I am very proud of the women of Ohio who supported the ERA. We have all worked very hard and have accomÂ­plished our task. " I was confident that we would win, and in fact had the count right on the nose. It has taken a great deal of courage to see this thing through. I have had mail and phone calls from many supporters, but I have also had some of the most vicious and abusive calls and letters, all of them I'm sure communist inspired. But, I take comfort in what former president Harry Truman said, 'Do your duty and history will do you justice,' and I know this will be true. "Now that this is over, I'm ready to go to sleep for 24 hours, and then I'll be ready to go again, to work for other eq ally important things. " " I'm delighted," Mrs. Roger A. Brown said.
