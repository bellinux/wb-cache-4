25|$|While today some engines rely on {{a single}} {{camshaft}} per cylinder bank, which {{is known as a}} single overhead camshaft (SOHC), most modern engines are driven by a two camshafts per cylinder bank arrangement (one camshaft for the intake valves and another for the exhaust valves); such camshaft arrangement is known as a double or dual overhead cam (DOHC), thus, a <b>V</b> <b>engine,</b> which has two separate cylinder banks, may have four camshafts (colloquially known as a quad-cam engine).|$|E
25|$|The Dennis chassis for Enviro500 (also {{known as}} Trident E500) was {{modified}} from the Trident 3. It can be fitted with Cummins ISMe335 Euro III engine (later Cummins ISLe340 Euro IV/Euro <b>V</b> <b>engine</b> which uses AdBlue to reduce emission of nitrogen oxides through {{selective catalytic reduction}} process), or ISM-330 engine for the buses delivered to North America, and coupled to Voith DIWA864.3E 4-speed or ZF 5HP602 5-speed gearbox. Later Voith DIWA864.5 4-speed gearbox, ZF 6HP602 6-speed gearbox and Allison B500R 6-speed gearbox became available and gradually became the standard configurations.|$|E
25|$|Another change {{affected}} the stroke, also a technique from the Arab, {{where it had}} been responsible for the engine's failure. A multi-cylinder <b>V</b> <b>engine</b> offers little length for connecting rods. Coatalen's usual solution was to use articulated connecting rods, where one rod runs on the crankshaft journal, but the other acts indirectly, through a journal on the other rod. The difficulty is that this gives a slightly different piston stroke for each bank, leading to unbalance and possible vibration problems, as for the Arab. Stroke was thus 135mm on one bank and 142mm on the other.|$|E

25|$|The next {{version of}} the Vixen was the Vickers Type 91 Vixen III, first flying in April 1924 which was fitted with larger wings (with {{wingspan}} of 44ft/13.4m rather than 34ft 6in/10.5m earlier aircraft) for increased performance at altitude, and reverted to a nose-mounted radiator. The Vixen III was tested with both wheel and float undercarriages, and was later converted back to a landplane, and used for air racing, competing in the 1925, 1926 and 1927 King's Cup Races. The Vixen III {{formed the basis of}} the Type 116 Vixen V, fitted with a high-compression Lion <b>V</b> <b>engine</b> and a modified tail, of which 18 were purchased by Chile.|$|E
25|$|Various {{engineering}} refinements {{that had}} gone into the Tempest II were incorporated into the last Tempest variant, designated as the Tempest VI. This variant was furnished with a Napier Sabre <b>V</b> <b>engine</b> with 2,340hp (1,700kW). The more powerful Sabre V required a bigger radiator which displaced the oil cooler and carburettor air intake from the radiator's centre; air for the carburettor was drawn through intakes on {{the leading edge of the}} inner wings, while the oil cooler was located behind the radiator. Most Tempest VIs were tropicalised, the main feature of this process being an air filter which was fitted in a fairing on the lower centre section. Other changes included the strengthening of the rear spar and the inclusion of spring tabs, which granted the variant superior handling performance.|$|E
500|$|An {{experimental}} {{version of}} Izdeliye 156 {{was built in}} 1947 {{under the name of}} Izdeliye 174TK (Tonkoye Krylo - thin wing). It had a very thin, straight wing of 6% thickness, believed to be the thinnest yet flown in the world, and an imported Rolls-Royce Derwent <b>V</b> <b>engine,</b> rated at , mounted in the nose. The three NS-23 cannon had to be repositioned {{on the bottom of the}} nose to accommodate the engine. It was first flown in January 1948 and had a top speed of [...] at sea level. It reached an altitude of 5,000 meters in only 2.5 minutes, but even these impressive gains over the 156 were inferior to the swept-wing Lavochkin La-160 that had flown nine months earlier and the program was canceled.|$|E

2500|$|Along with ex-Rolls Roycers Stuart Tresillian and Charles Sewell, {{and design}} genius Frank Feeley, W.O. {{swallowed}} his distaste for the primitive conditions of Lagonda's factory, {{and got to}} work on the new engine that was to become his masterpiece, the V-12, launched in 1937. The 4480 cc engine delivered [...] and was said to be capable of going from [...] in top gear and to rev to 5000 rpm. The car was exhibited at the 1939 New York Motor Show: [...] "The highest price car in the show this year is tagged $8,900. It is a Lagonda, known as the [...] "Rapide" [...] model, imported from England. The power plant is a twelve-cylinder <b>V</b> <b>engine</b> developing 200 horsepower." ...|$|E
2500|$|The second prototype, {{originally}} the Type 118A {{made its first}} flight, with the Mercury <b>V</b> <b>engine</b> that it was designed for and bearing the experimental marking R-6, on 29 January 1932 [...] By that time, though it had acquired a rotatable turret or cupola over the gunner's cockpit and a new type number, 120. The Mercury was a stopgap engine (though the Mercury V had been recently renamed the Pegasus) and a Pegasus I.M.3 replaced it that April. The cupola was a lightweight transparent structure that completely enclosed the gunner and rotated with his Lewis gun, its Scarff ring now mounted higher in the cockpit. It gave him protection from the slipstream, which was particularly helpful when he was standing to fire downwards.|$|E
2500|$|The Military Aviation Service of Chile {{placed an}} initial order for twelve Vixen Vs in May 1925, this being {{increased}} to 18 in July. While prone to engine problems {{owing to the}} problems with the special fuel (⅔ petrol to ⅓ benzol) required for the high-compression Lion <b>V</b> <b>engine,</b> and requiring frequent re-rigging owing to the use of wooden wings in the high temperature of Northern Chile, the Vixen Vs, operated by the Grupo Mixto de Aviación N° 3. were popular in Chilean service, being used for long-distance flights of several hundred miles and continued in service for several years. Vixens participated in bombing raids against mutinying ships of the Chilean Navy (including the Battleship [...] ) during the Sailors' mutiny of September 1931.|$|E

2500|$|Two prototypes were ordered, {{with the}} first J8027, powered by a 385hp (287kW) Armstrong Siddeley Jaguar VII radial engine flying on 12 May 1927. It proved to be underpowered with this engine, and was {{therefore}} re-engined with a 460hp (340kW) Jaguar <b>V</b> <b>engine.</b> [...] Performance was still unimpressive however, {{with the first}} prototype not exceeding speeds of 160mph (260km/h) rather than the expected 180mph (290km/h), while low speed handling was poor. The prototype was evaluated against the later Specification F.9/26 in February 1926, but {{was rejected by the}} RAF, who instead selected the Bristol Bulldog. J8027 was returned to Armstrong Whitworth, who fitted it with new wings with Clark YH aerofoil section and leading edge slots fitted on the upper wings. It was given the civil registration G-AAHC in May 1929, and was shown at Olympia in London in July 1929. It was cancelled from the register in December 1930.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} {{names for}} some configurations are historic, arbitrary, or both, with some overlap. For example, the cylinder banks of a 180° <b>V</b> <b>engine</b> do {{not in any}} way form a V, but it is regarded as a <b>V</b> <b>engine</b> because of its crankshaft and big end configuration, which result in performance characteristics similar to a <b>V</b> <b>engine.</b> But it is also considered a flat engine because of its shape. On the other hand, some engines which have none of the typical <b>V</b> <b>engine</b> crankshaft design features and consequent performance characteristics are also regarded as V engines, purely because of their shape. Similarly, the Volkswagen Group VR6 engine is a hybrid of the <b>V</b> <b>engine</b> and the straight engine, and can not be definitively labeled as either.|$|E
