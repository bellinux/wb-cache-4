5|$|The site of {{the fort}} and warren is now grassy slopes which attract {{a wide range of}} wild flowers and butterflies. The differing soil types provide {{suitable}} habitats for both acid- and lime-loving plants. Kidney vetch (Anthyllis vulneraria), harebell (Campanula rotundifolia) and woolly thistle (Cirsium eriophorum) thrive on the dry stony soils. Heath bedstraw (Galium saxatile) and wood sage (Teucrium scorodonia) are found in more acidic areas. The higher areas support bell heather (Erica cinerea), western gorse (Ulex gallii) and common heather (Calluna vulgaris). Trees and shrubs include the wayfaring tree (<b>Viburnum</b> lantana), guelder rose (<b>Viburnum</b> opulus), whitebeam (Sorbus aria), privet (Ligustrum vulgare) and dogwood (Cornus sanguinea).|$|E
5|$|Keebach had {{the park}} {{designed}} {{in such a}} way that it would incorporate the landscape's native vegetation, mountain springs, and nearby rocky masses, in addition to foreign plant species brought in from the Mediterranean, both North and South America, as well as from East Asia. Today, the park still features more than 200 exotic tree and shrub species, including a wide variety of palm trees, laurels, cypresses, olive trees, and evergreen <b>viburnum,</b> among many others.|$|E

25|$|The Spanish fir (Abies pinsapo) {{is a true}} relic {{which has}} {{remained}} preserved in some mountain ranges around Málaga and Cádiz. Spanish firs {{are related to the}} North African spruce forests of the Yebala range, in Morocco. They come into contact with Algerian oak (Quercus canariensis) and other oak trees and sometimes even form mixed communities with these. Among the woody species also found in these forests are the hawthorn, barberry, butcher's broom (Ruscus aculeatus), <b>Viburnum</b> tinus, ivy, and Daphne laureola.|$|E
25|$|Forests of Holm oak (Quercus ilex) form natural {{forests in}} most of the Mediterranean region as well as {{penetrating}} into the warmer sun-exposed areas and hillsides of the Atlantic region; they extend from sea level, with the subspecies ilex, to an altitude of 1400 metres, in some mountains and high plains of the interior; in the continental zone, the oak found is the subspecies rotundifolia, more resistant to such a climate. The holm oak can also be found at higher altitudes, but as isolated trees, not forming forests. Coastal oak forests and those of sublittoral mountains are extraordinarily rich and varied, with a variety of shrubs and lianas; often accompanied by bramble, honeysuckle, ivy, <b>Viburnum</b> tinus, butcher's broom and, in the southwest of the peninsula, wild olive trees. The oak forests of the Balearic Islands are also rich, and incorporate characteristic species of the islands, such as the Balearic cyclamen (Cyclamen balearicum Willk.).|$|E
50|$|The elders {{are mostly}} shrubs, but two species are large {{herbaceous}} plants; all have compound leaves. The <b>viburnums</b> are all shrubs, with simple leaves.|$|R
50|$|The {{arboretum}} {{includes a}} grotto (former quarry), millrace, and pond with bald cypress. Its collection includes three Pennsylvania State Champion Trees (a giant dogwood, a needle juniper, and a lacebark elm), {{as well as}} azaleas, dogwoods, magnolias, junipers, lilacs, <b>viburnums,</b> witch-hazels, Japanese maples, boxwoods, and arborvitae. The site also contains cattails, ferns, irises, mosses, rushes, and wildflowers.|$|R
50|$|Mature oaks include {{specimens}} of black, bur, English, pin, sawtooth, shingle, shumard, and swamp white varieties. Other trees include blue ash, chestnut, pawpaw, sweetgum, black tupelo, and Scots pine. Additional plants include lilacs, cold-hardy rhododendrons, and <b>viburnums,</b> {{as well as}} over 80 hosta cultivars, and a 1 acre prairie with native wildflowers and bluestem and Indian grass.|$|R
500|$|The {{black bean}} aphid [...] can feed {{on a wide}} variety of host plants. Its primary hosts on which the eggs overwinter are shrubs such as the spindle tree (Euonymus europaeus), <b>Viburnum</b> species, or the mock-orange (Philadelphus species). Its {{secondary}} hosts, on which it spends the summer, include a number of crops including [...] sugar beets, spinach, beans, runner beans, celery, potatoes, sunflowers, carrots, artichokes, tobacco, and tomatoes. It colonises more than two hundred different species of cultivated and wild plants. Among the latter, it shows a preference for poppies (Papaver species), burdock (Arctium tomentonum), fat-hen (Chenopodium album), saltbush (Atriplex rosea), chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla), thistles (Cirsium arvense), and docks (Rumex spp.).|$|E
2500|$|Many dry fruits {{are used}} as decorations or in dried flower {{arrangements}} (e.g., annual honesty, cotoneaster, lotus, milkweed, unicorn plant, and wheat). Ornamental trees and shrubs are often cultivated for their colorful fruits, including beautyberry, cotoneaster, holly, pyracantha, skimmia, [...] and <b>viburnum.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Other {{items found}} with the Iceman were a copper axe with a yew handle, a flint-bladed knife with an ash handle and a quiver of 14 arrows with <b>viburnum</b> and dogwood shafts. Two of the arrows, which were broken, were tipped with flint and had {{fletching}} (stabilizing fins), {{while the other}} 12 were unfinished and untipped. The arrows were found in a quiver with what is presumed to be a bow string, an unidentified tool, and an antler tool {{which might have been}} used for sharpening arrow points. There was also an unfinished yew longbow that was [...] long.|$|E
5000|$|Alexandra Botanic Garden - {{established}} in 1906 {{in honor of}} Alexandra Severance, with today's gardens created in 1920-1921. The garden contains ponds, meadows, a maple swamp, collections of roses, <b>viburnums,</b> heather, etc., in naturalistic landscapes. It also contains the Cameron Garden, a sensory garden, and the Creighton Educational Garden, a small collection of alpine plants and miniature conifers.|$|R
50|$|He was {{employed}} {{as the city}} gardener in Helsinki from 1946 {{until his retirement in}} 1957. He was considered one of Finland's leading experts in the field of garden archicture, with a speciality in perennial plants and decorative bushes. He was also a pioneering plant breeder who grew new hybrid lilies, rhododendrons, crab apple trees, roses and <b>viburnums</b> for the gardens in Helsinki.|$|R
50|$|<b>Viburnums,</b> winterberry, blueberry, serviceberry, Virginia rose, {{and male}} berry {{comprise}} {{much of the}} shrub understory. Other upland habitats consist of grassland units and thicket units. Habitats are quite diverse, containing elements from the more southern oak-pine forests and the coniferous forests of the north. Southern Maine is where these two community types collide and blend, creating a wealth of biodiversity.|$|R
2500|$|Landscaping {{elements}} form {{an integral}} part of the memorial design. A row of gingko trees lines the side of the site west of the [...] "Wall of Gratitude", as well as both sides of the wide sidewalk on the Washington Avenue side of the site. Planting beds approximately [...] deep exist behind each glass wall. Ground cover consists of mondo grass and lily turf. Shrubs used at the site include Carolina allspice (Calycanthus floridus), dwarf sweet pepperbush, Harry's garnet sweetspire, [...] "Gulftide" [...] holly osmanthus, and Burkwood <b>viburnum.</b> Perennial plantings at the site include marginal wood fern, autumn fern, lenten rose (Helleborus orientalis), Virginia bluebell, and woodland sedge.|$|E
2500|$|The {{temperate}} climate and humidity resulting from {{proximity to the}} coast favour {{the growth of a}} rich mat of forest includong Atlantic and Mediterranean species, marking the transition in Portugal from northern to southern vegetation. The Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica) predominates over great expanses of the rocky heights and sheltered slopes. On moist shady slopes, normally facing north, or in sheltered places, the common oak (Quercus robur) is widespread. In lowland areas and warm places the Cork oak (Quercus suber) is common and in limestone areas the Portuguese oak (Quercus faginea) is found. Other species scattered throughout the mountains of Sintra include: maple (Acer pseudoplatanus), common hazel (Corylus avellana), common hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), European holly (Ilex aquifolium), Portuguese laurel (Prunus lusitanica), Bay laurel (Laurus nobilis), [...] Strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo), Laurestine (<b>Viburnum</b> tinus), Kermes oak (Quercus coccifera), and Italian buckthorn (Rhamnus alaternus). In the valleys, near watercourses, grow Narrow-leaf ash (Fraxinus angustifolia), Grey willow (Salix atrocinerea), European alder (Alnus glutinosa), Alder buckthorn (Rhamnus frangula) and Black Elderberry (Sambucus nigra).|$|E

Its specific collections include: an alpine rock garden, dahlia garden, entrance garden, fuchsia garden, ground cover garden, Lost Meadow Trail (with western redcedar, Douglas-fir, bigleaf maple and vine maple, plus native shrubs), native discovery garden, perennial border, water-wise garden, and the Yao garden (a Japanese-style stroll garden with maples, <b>viburnums,</b> hydrangeas, etc.) ...|$|R
50|$|The nursery's {{arboretum}} {{has been}} recognized by the national collection of the Conservatoire des Collections Végétales Spécialisées (CCVS) for its collections of Ginkgo biloba (28 varieties) and Liquidambar (26 varieties). It also contains oaks (144 varieties), maples (110 varieties), Japanese maples (50 varieties), <b>viburnums</b> (50 varieties), magnolias (35 varieties), hawthorns (30 varieties), and lilacs (30 varieties), as well as Metasequoia, Picea, Sequoia, and Taxodium specimens.|$|R
50|$|The {{arboretum}} contains approximately 2,500 {{native and}} exotic woody plant specimens, representing 800 species, varieties, and cultivars, with good collections of azaleas, conifers, crabapples, dogwoods, hollies, junipers, magnolias, oaks, rhododendrons, and <b>viburnums.</b> It also includes geographic groupings of plants from both relatively nearby habitats (Cumberland River gorge, Southern United States coastal plains) {{and elsewhere in}} the world (California, central China, and Poland), as well as four nature trails with interpretive signs.|$|R
60|$|A {{native species}} of spider (Thomisus citreus) {{exhibits}} a somewhat similar alluring protection by its close resemblance to buds of the wayfaring tree, <b>Viburnum</b> lantana. It is pure creamy-white, the abdomen exactly resembling {{in shape and}} colour the unopened buds of the flowers among which it takes its station; {{and it has been}} seen to capture flies which came to the flowers.|$|E
60|$|Splendid {{trees of}} Bombax, fig and banyan, overshadowed them: the largest banyan had a trunk five feet in diameter, {{clear of the}} buttresses, and {{numerous}} small trees of Celtic grew out of it, and an immense flowering tuft of Vanda caerulea (the rarest and most beautiful of Indian orchids) flourished on one of its limbs. A small plantain with austere woolly scarlet fruit, bearing ripe seeds, was planted in this sacred grove, where trees of the most tropical genera grew mixed with the pine, birch, Myrica, and <b>Viburnum.</b>|$|E
6000|$|The {{elevation}} being 12,080 feet, I {{was above}} the limit of trees, and the ground was covered with many kinds of small-flowered honeysuckles, berberry, and white rose.* [Besides these I found a prickly Aralia, maple, two currants, eight or nine rhododendrons, many Sedums, Rhodiola, white Clematis, red-flowered cherry, birch, willow, <b>Viburnum,</b> juniper, a few ferns, two Andromedas, Menziesia, and Spircaea. And {{in addition to the}} herbs mentioned above, may be enumerated Parnassia, many Saxifrages, Soldanella, Draba, and various other Cruciferae, Nardostachys, (spikenard), Epilobium, Thalictrum, and very many other genera, almost all typical of the Siberian, North European, and Arctic floras.] ...|$|E
50|$|Today the {{arboretum}} {{contains about}} 2500 taxa planted across 200 years, including Acer palmatum, Cypress, Fagus, Carya, Liquidambar, Nyssa, Quercus, and Sassafras, {{as well as}} azaleas, camellias, davidias, magnolias, rhododendrons, <b>viburnums,</b> a fine collection of Cornus, and old roses and hydrangeas. Noteworthy specimens include a 36-meter giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum) planted in 1856, a Sequoia sempervirens, a 45-meter bald cypress from Louisiana planted in 1822, and a 30-meter tupelo (Nyssa sylvatica).|$|R
5|$|The {{water in}} the bog is low in {{nutrients}} and high in acidity, which {{makes it difficult for}} most plants to live there. Only specialized plants can thrive in the park bogs: there are three species of carnivorous plants and seventeen varieties of orchid. Wild cranberries and blueberries grow in the bog along with sedges, leatherleaf shrubs, Arctic cotton grass, and <b>viburnums.</b> The bogs are all protected by the state of Pennsylvania.|$|R
5000|$|Longenecker Horticultural Gardens (35 acres) - {{more than}} 5,000 plants {{of more than}} 2,500 taxa; a leading {{collection}} of trees, shrubs and vines in Wisconsin. Major displays of lilacs, flowering crabapples (said {{to be one of}} the most complete and up-to-date in the world), <b>viburnums,</b> conifers (including a large collection of arborvitae cultivars), and dozens of other plant groups. More than 100 of Wisconsin's native woody plants are represented in the collections.|$|R
60|$|Pacheem {{stands at}} an {{elevation}} of nearly 7300 feet, and as I walked out on the following morning I met with English looking plants in abundance, but was {{too early in the}} season to get aught but the foliage of most. Chryosplenium, violet, Lobelia, a small geranium, strawberry, five or six kinds of bramble, Arum, Paris, Convallaria, Stellaria, Rubia, Vaccinium, and various Gnaphalia. Of small bushes, cornels, honeysuckles, and the ivy tribe predominated, with Symplocos and Skimmia, Eurya, bushy brambles, having simple or compound green or beautifully silky foliage; Hypericum, Berberry, Hydrangea, Wormwood, Adamia cyanea, <b>Viburnum,</b> Elder, dwarf bamboo, etc.|$|E
6000|$|I was {{disappointed}} at finding the rhododendron seeds still immature at Yeumtong, for I was doubtful whether {{the same kinds}} might be met with at the Chola pass, which I had yet to visit; besides which, their tardy maturation threatened to delay me for an indefinite period in the country. <b>Viburnum</b> and Lonicera, however, were ripe and abundant; the fruits of both are considered poisonous in Europe, but here the black berries of a species of the former (called [...] "Nalum") are eatable and agreeable; as are those of a Gualtheria, which are pale blue, and called [...] "Kalumbo." [...] Except these, and the cherry mentioned above, {{there are no other}} autumnal fruits above 10,000 feet: brambles, strange as it may appear, do not ascend beyond that elevation in the Sikkim Himalaya, though so abundant below it, both in species and individuals, and though so typical of northern Europe.|$|E
60|$|A few {{examples}} will show this. Amongst trees the Conifers are conspicuous at Lamteng, {{and all are}} of genera typical both of Europe and North America: namely, silver fir, spruce, larch, and juniper, besides the yew: there are also species of birch, alder, ash, apple, oak, willow, cherry, bird-cherry, mountain-ash, thorn, walnut, hazel, maple, poplar, ivy, holly, Andromeda, Rhamnus. Of bushes; rose, berberry, bramble, rhododendron, elder, cornel, willow, honeysuckle, currant, Spiraea, <b>Viburnum,</b> Cotoneaster, Hippophae. Herbaceous plants* [As an example, the ground about my tent was covered with grasses and sedges, amongst which grew primroses, thistles, speedwell, wild leeks, Arum, Convallaria, Callitriche, Oxalis, Ranunculus, Potentilla, Orchis, Chaerophyllum, Galium, Paris, and Anagallis; besides cultivated weeds of shepherd's-purse, dock, mustard, Mithridate cress, radish, turnip, Thlaspi arvense, and Poa annua.] are far too numerous to be enumerated, as a list would include most of the common genera of European and North American plants.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} Barnes Foundation {{campus in}} Merion, Pennsylvania, {{is now a}} 12-acre arboretum {{open to the public}} for tours. The plant collection features favorite plants assembled by Mrs. Barnes for teaching purposes, and includes stewartia, aesculus, phellodendron, clethra, magnolia, <b>viburnums,</b> lilacs, roses, peonies, hostas, medicinal plants, and hardy ferns. [...] A herbarium and horticulture library is available to the Foundation's horticulture students and other scholars by appointment. Classes are offered in horticulture topics for the general public.|$|R
50|$|Although native in {{the southeastern}} United States, it is hardy {{in the north and}} is {{extensively}} planted in gardens, where specimens are often grown with multiple trunks. The white flowers are best seen from below. Fall color is a fine, clear yellow, a good contrast with <b>viburnums</b> and evergreens. It prefers a moist soil and a sheltered situation. It may be propagated by grafting on Ash (Fraxinus sp.). The wood is light brown, sapwood paler brown; heavy, hard, and close-grained.|$|R
5000|$|There are two flower {{arrangements}} in hydrangeas with Corymb style inflorescens, {{which includes the}} commonly grown [...] "bigleaf hydrangea"—Hydrangea macrophylla. Mophead flowers are large round flowerheads resembling pom-poms or, as the name implies, {{the head of a}} mop. In contrast, lacecap flowers bear round, flat flowerheads with a center core of subdued, small flowers surrounded by outer rings of larger flowers having showy sepals or tepals. The flowers of some rhododendrons and <b>viburnums</b> can appear, at first glance, similar to those of some hydrangeas.|$|R
