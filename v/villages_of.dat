5|$|According to {{archaeologist}} Karl Lorenz, who excavated several Natchez settlements, {{another factor}} that complicated relations between the Natchez and the colonists {{was the fact that}} the French did not well understand the Natchez political structure. The French assumed that the Great Sun, the chief of the Grand Village, also held sway over all the other Natchez villages. In truth, each village was semi-autonomous, and the Great Sun's power only extended to the <b>villages</b> <b>of</b> Flour and Tioux (with which the Grand Village was allied) and not to the three pro-British <b>villages</b> <b>of</b> White Apple, Jenzenaque and Grigra. When the Great Sun died in 1728 and was succeeded by his inexperienced nephew, the pro-British villages became more powerful than the pro-French villages centered at Natchez.|$|E
