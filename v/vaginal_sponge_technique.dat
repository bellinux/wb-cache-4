A total of 20 thin tailed ewe lambs, aged 12 - 15 months, were at random assigned to one of four treatment groups in Completely Randomized Designed (CRD) : Animals in Treatment group I (P 1) received PGF 2 a of 5 mg/ml/head intramuscularly; Treatment group II (P 2) received PGF 2 a of 5 mg/ml/head by intra <b>vaginal</b> <b>sponges</b> for twodays;Treatment groupIII(P 3) received PGF 2 a of 5 mg/ml/head by intra <b>vaginal</b> <b>sponges</b> for four days; Treatment group IV (P 4) received PGF 2 a of 5 mg/ml/head by intra <b>vaginal</b> <b>sponges</b> for six days. Two rams, aged 2 - 2. 5 years used as a mated. Each treatment was repeated five times. Variables measured were onset and duration of estrus, and Non-return Rate (NR) in 30 days. Collected data were analyzed using analysis of variance followed by Post-hoc of Least Significant Difference (LSD). Average values of onset of estrus for P 1, P 2, P 3 and P 4 were 22. 91, 23. 16, 26. 31 and 44. 57 hours, respectively. Average values of duration of estrus for P 1, P 2, P 3 and P 4 were 26. 36, 48. 36, 94. 65 and 146. 56 hours, respectively. Analysis of variance indicated that the administration method of PGF 2 a affected significantly (P< 0. 01) on the onset and the duration of estrus. Non-return Rate (NR) in 30 days for P 1, P 2, P 3 and P 4 was 100, 100, 20 and 20 percent, respectively.

40|$|Objective: To isolate and {{identify}} microflora and fungal species at different phases during estrus synchronization of ewes and estimate their prevalence; compare {{the effectiveness of}} antimicrobial administration to intravaginal sponge on {{the changes in the}} vaginal microorganisms and reproductive performance. Methods: Sixty Egyptian ewes were allocated into three equal groups (G: 1, 2 and 3). G 1 was inserted with <b>vaginal</b> <b>sponge</b> containing medroxyprogesterone acetate and served as control; without antimicrobial additive. The other two groups were treated as G 1, but sponges were previously injected with ciprofloxacin (G 2), while sponges of G 3 were injected with ciprofloxacin and clotrimazole. Vaginal swabs were collected from each treated ewe, prior sponge insertion, at sponge withdrawal and 48 h later for microbiological investigation and bacterial count. On the day of sponge removal, 300 IU/eCG was administered for each treated ewe. The identified bacterial strains before sponge insertion were tested for sensitivity with antimicrobial disks. Results: Bacterial isolates before sponge insertion were more sensitive to ciprofloxacin. Frequencies of ewes in estrus; the interval from sponge withdrawal to onset estrus and the duration of estrus were statistically similar among treated groups. The pregnancy rate in G 2 (100. 0 %) was higher than G 1 (66. 7 %) and G 3 (82. 4 %). The total bacterial count before sponge insertion was similar between all treatments and increased significantly in all groups on the day of sponge withdraw. The prevailing bacteria on D 0, D 14 and 48 h after sponge removal for all treated groups were Staphylococcus spp. followed by Escherichia coli. Regarding to fungus species, percentages of isolation increased from 5. 00 % (before sponge insertion) to 100. 00 % and 88. 89 % at sponge withdraw for G 1 and G 2, respectively.

40|$|Background: Artificial {{insemination}} is {{an established}} and viable technique {{to accelerate the}} genetic advancement and economic return of the cattle. However, compromises the efficiency of detection of estrus results in low insemination rates. To avoid these problems in beef herd, synchronization protocols have been developed that allow inseminate large number of animals within a set period of time. These treatments are known as protocols for synchronization of ovulation for fixed-time artificial insemination (FTAI). There are several slow-release progesterone or progestins devices {{on the market for}} use in synchronization of estrus/ovulation programs in cattle, but these devices have a high cost, which results in less use of these protocols by farmers. This study aimed to determine the follicular dynamic of a low cost protocol to synchronize ovulation, which uses <b>vaginal</b> <b>sponges</b> impregnated with medroxy-progesterone acetate (MPA; group 1) and compare it with two trade protocols (groups 2 and 3). Materials, Methods & Results: Nine Braford cows, multiparous non-lactating, cyclic and BCS > 3 (BCS = 1 extremely lean cows and BCS = 5 obese cows) where used in these trial. The animals were divided into three treatments, which all animals went for three treatments in four replicates. (Continue 0 Group 1 (n = 14), animals received on day 0, a <b>vaginal</b> <b>sponge</b> impregnated with 250 mg MPA and an intramuscular (i. m.) application of 2 mg of estradiol benzoate (EB); on day 8, the <b>vaginal</b> <b>sponge</b> was removed and applied i. m. 0. 5 mg cloprostenol and 24 h latter was applied i. m. 1 mg of EB. Group 2 (n = 7), the animals received on day 0, a silicone vaginal implant with 1 g of progesterone and an application i. m. of 2 mg of EB; on day 8, the implant was removed and applied i. m. 0. 5 mg cloprostenol and 24 h latter was applied i. m. 1 mg of EB. Group 3 (n = 8), the animals received on day 0, a silicone ear implant impregnated with 3 mg norgestomet and an application i. m. of 3 mg norgestomet and 5 mg of estradiol valerate; on the 9 th day the implant was removed. From day 0, animals were examined daily by trans-rectal ultrasound with an 8 MHz linear transducer to monitor follicular and luteal dynamics. After removal of the implant in group 3 and after application of 1 mg EB in the other groups, the animals were evaluated by ultrasound two times per day until ovulation was detected. In group 1, seven animals lost a <b>vaginal</b> <b>sponge</b> impregnated with MPA and the data were removed from analysis. The emergence of follicular wave for groups 1, 2 and 3 occurred, respectively, 3. 7 ± 1. 1, 3. 7 ± 0. 7 and 4. 9 ± 1. 1 days, with a statistical trend (P < 0. 06) to occur earlier in groups 1 and 2 than in group 3. There was no statistical difference between groups in other variables. The interval between wave emergence and ovulation occurred in 7. 4 ± 0. 9, 7. 3 ± 0. 7 and 7. 6 ± 1. 3 days (P = 0. 82); the interval between implant removal and ovulation occurred in 66 ± 12, 66 ± 0 and 70. 5 ± 12. 7 hours (P = 0. 62); the dominant follicle diameter at implant removal was 10. 9 ± 2. 6, 12. 7 ± 2. 1 and 10. 3 ± 2. 1 mm (P = 0. 13); and the larger diameter of the dominant follicle was 15. 3 ± 2. 9, 16. 6 ± 1. 3 and 15. 9 ± 1. 5 mm (P = 0. 49) for groups 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Discussion: In this experiment, the protocols used in groups 1, 2 and 3 were effective in promoting the emergence of a synchronized new follicular wave and promote synchronized ovulation of a follicle with few days of dominance and an appropriate diameter. It was observed that numerical variations on the emergence of the new follicular wave numerically influenced in the timing ovulations.

40|$|AbstractThis paper proposes inflow and outflow {{boundary}} conditions for direct computation of airfoil noise {{under the influence}} of impinging gusts with a particular interest in the high frequency response. The proposed {{boundary conditions}} are based on an existing zonal <b>sponge</b> <b>technique</b> that has been used mostly to attenuate outgoing disturbances and absorb reflections from computational boundaries. A modified form of the <b>sponge</b> <b>technique</b> is presented in this paper in order to specify an incoming disturbance. The proposed boundary conditions still maintain the genuine non-reflective features that lead to accurate calculations of far-field sound intensity and directivity. It is also shown that the proposed boundary conditions enable the use of a significantly smaller domain size, and hence fewer grid cells, than used in conventional airfoil calculations, which enables the calculation of high-frequency gust-airfoil noise at a much lower computational cost. The proposed boundary conditions are validated against CAA (computational aeroacoustics) benchmark solutions after a variety of parametric tests, through which an optimal combination of the domain size, sponge thickness and a sponge coefficient is obtained for the highest efficiency. The proposed boundary conditions yield more accurate and consistent solutions particularly at the far field than the conventional ones. Further applications to high-frequency gust responses are performed to observe and demonstrate significant changes in the sound intensity and directivity varying with different frequencies and gust incidence angles...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to assess the effect of IVM {{treatment}} on the developmental competence of oocytes recovered from repeated laparoscopic ovum pickukp (LOPU) in goats. A total of 94 LOPU sessions were performed on 33 adult goats of the Saanen and Alpine breeds. Females were synchronized (Day 0) during the nonbreeding season by inserting <b>vaginal</b> <b>sponges</b> (45 mg of fluorogestone acetate, Intervet, Boxmeer, The Netherlands). At Day 8, an i. m. injection of 50 μg of cloprostenol (Estrumate; Schering-Plough Animal Health, Pointe-Claire, Quebec, Canada) was administered. Porcine FSH (Stimufol, Merial, Brussels, Belgium, 160 mg/goat) was administered in 5 injections at 12 -h intervals, starting on Day 8. The LOPU took place under general anesthesia on Day 11, and follicles ≥ 2 mm were aspirated with an 18 -gauge needle connected to a controlled vacuum system. <b>Vaginal</b> <b>sponges</b> were removed at the time of LOPU. Treatments were repeated 2 times in a 2 -week interval scheme (2 goats and 1 goat were excluded from the experiment during the second and third LOPU sessions, respectively). Cumulus–oocyte complexes were washed and evaluated for quality (graded from 1 to 3). Oocytes recovered from unstimulated slaughterhouse-derived ovaries served as a control. Cumulus–oocytes complexes from Grades 1 and 2 were submitted to IVM in TCM- 199, supplemented with 100 μm of cysteamine and either 10 ng mL– 1 of epidermal growth factor (EGF) or 10 % follicular fluid and 100 ng mL– 1 of ovine FSH (FF-FSH). Matured oocytes were then submitted to IVF and in vitro development as described by Cognié et al. (2004 Reprod. Fertil. Dev. 16, 437 – 445). Over the 94 LOPU sessions, 20. 4 ± 0. 9 follicles were aspirated (mean ± SEM), allowing the recovery of 12. 3 ± 0. 7 COC per goat and per session, of which 80. 1 % were suitable for IVM (Grades 1 and 2). Results of in vitro production are detailed in the table. The IVM treatment did not significantly affect cleavage or blastocyst development rates in oocytes derived from slaughterhouse ovaries. Cleavage rates were significantly decreased in LOPU-derived oocytes when compared with control oocytes. For LOPU-derived oocytes, cleavage and final blastocyst development rates were increased significantly and kinetics of embryo development were accelerated when FF-FSH was used during IVM as compared with EGF. The IVM with FF-FSH allowed us to produce 4. 1 blatocysts per goat per LOPU session. These results demonstrate the interest in LOPU for goat embryo production once appropriate IVM treatment is used. The difference observed between LOPU and slaughterhouse oocytes in terms of response to IVM treatments may be related to FSH stimulation prior to the LOPU session or to postmortem changes in oocyte responsiveness in the slaughterhouse group.

40|$|A {{pilot project}} was {{initiated}} to introduce artificial insemination (AI) in goats at farmer level with chilled semen. Does (n= 18) were synchronized with progesterone impregnated <b>vaginal</b> <b>sponges</b> (60 mg Medroxyprogesterone acetate; MAP) for 11 days. At 48 hrs {{prior to removal}} of the sponges, intramuscular injection of 400 IU equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) and cloprostenol (0. 075 mg) was given. Fixed time vaginal insemination (43 - 45 hrs after sponge removal) was done twice (at 12 hrs interval) in 17 does with chilled Beetal buck semen (4 °C) extended with Tris-citric acid (TCA) or skimmed milk (SM) based extender (75 x 106 sperm/ml). Pregnancy test was performed at 45 days post insemination through ultrasonography. An overall 94. 5 % (17 / 18) of does showed heat signs and 78 % of them were detected in heat between 12 - 24 hrs after sponge removal. An overall 29. 4 % (5 / 17) pregnancy rate was recorded. Higher pregnancy rate (44. 4 %) was obtained in does inseminated with SM extended semen as compared to 12. 5 % for TCA extended semen.

Ewes were allocated to five groups (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) and injected with O (control) 600, 800, 1000 and 1200 IU PMSGH respectively. Mating rates following natural mating,using 1 : 10 ram ewe ratio,were 73, 93, 86, 96 and 100 % respectively. Conception rates to treated (and mated) ewes were 69. 2 (94. 7), 50 (53. 6), 60 (69. 3), 43. 3 (44. 8) and 40 %(40 %) respectively. Number (and%) of experimental groups lambing twins were 4 (26. 7), 6 (33. 3), 3 (23. 1) and 4 (33. 3 %) respectively, as compared with 2 (11. 1 %) in the control, while number (and%) of ewes lambing triplets were 2 (13. 3), 2 (11. 1), 3 (23. 1) and 2 (16. 7 %) as compared with only one (5. 6 %) in the control. Only one ewe (5. 6 %) yielded one set of quintuplets in the group which received 800 IU PMSGH. Increasing PMSGH doses beyond 800 IU may depress, rather enhance conception, lambing and prolificacy rates. More research is recommended under good nutrition and management using optimum ram: ewe ratio of 1 : 5 during normal and autumn breeding seasons. ]]...|$|R
5000|$|Certain {{physical}} conditions {{may make it}} impossible for a woman to conceive. This is called [...] "involuntary infecundity." [...] If the woman has a condition making it possible, but unlikely to conceive, this is termed [...] "subfecundity." [...] Venereal diseases (especially gonorrhea, syphilis, and chlamydia) are common causes. Nutrition is a factor as well: women with less than 20% body fat may be subfecund, a factor of concern for athletes and people susceptible to anorexia. Demographer Ruth Frisch has argued that [...] "It takes 50,000 calories to make a baby". There is also subfecundity in the weeks following childbirth, and this can be prolonged {{for a year or more}} through breastfeeding. A furious political debate raged in the 1980s over the ethics of baby food companies marketing infant formula in developing countries. A large industry has developed to deal with subfecundity in women and men. An equally large industry has emerged to provide contraceptive devices designed to prevent conception. Their effectiveness in use varies. On average, 85% of married couples using no contraception will have a pregnancy in one year. The rate drops to the 20% range when using withdrawal, <b>vaginal</b> <b>sponges,</b> or spermicides. (This assumes the partners never forget to use the contraceptive.) The rate drops to only 2 or 3% when using the pill or an IUD, and drops to near 0% for implants and 0% for tubal ligation (sterilization) of the woman, or a vasectomy for the man.|$|R

40|$|Ninety-eight Alpine goats of two herds were {{followed}} over 4 {{years in a}} program of annual artificial insemination after estrus induction/synchronization, including progestagen administration (<b>vaginal</b> <b>sponge)</b> followed by prostaglandin analog and equine chorionic gonadotrophin (eCG) 48 h before sponge removal. Goats were sampled every 4 hours from the 16 th to the 56 th following sponge removal, for determination of LH surge and tested for estrus {{by the presence of}} a buck. Seven days after AI, endoscopic examination of the ovaries was performed to determine the number of corpus lutea. Pregnancy diagnosis was performed at day 21 - 22 post AI by determination of plasma progesterone and at day 40 - 45 by ultrasonography. Parturition, number and sex of kids were recorded. All the goats were sampled before and after each treatment, for anti-eCG antibodies screening. Statistical analysis of the results clearly established a significant effect of the treatments on anti-eCG antibodies. Time of estrus and LH surge were significantly different between herd. The antibodies significantly delayed the time of coming out of estrus as well as the time of LH surge. Two antagonistic effects were evidenced: first, the delayed of time of estrus and time of LH surge in relation with the immune reaction to eCG; secondly, the ahead of time of estrus and time of LH surge during the years of treatment, identical to both herd. The antibodies negatively influenced the percentage of ovulating females as well as kidding rate. Finally, no effect of antibodies on prolificacy was found. Peer reviewe...|$|R
