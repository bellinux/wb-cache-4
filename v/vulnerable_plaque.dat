25|$|Apart from thromboembolism, chronically {{expanding}} atherosclerotic lesions {{can cause}} complete {{closure of the}} lumen. Chronically expanding lesions are often asymptomatic until lumen stenosis is so severe (usually over 80%) that blood supply to downstream tissue(s) is insufficient, resulting in ischemia. These complications of advanced atherosclerosis are chronic, slowly progressive and cumulative. Most commonly, soft plaque suddenly ruptures (see <b>vulnerable</b> <b>plaque),</b> causing {{the formation of a}} thrombus that will rapidly slow or stop blood flow, leading to death of the tissues fed by the artery in approximately five minutes. This event is called an infarction.|$|E

Polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) of SG 13 S 114 A/T in ALOX 5 AP gene was performed for 284 patients with atherothrombotic cerebral infarction, of which 152 cases were diagnosed with stable plaque and the other 132 cases had <b>vulnerable</b> <b>plaques.</b> We found that the frequency of SG 13 S 114 AA genotype and A allele of ALOX 5 AP gene in the cases with <b>vulnerable</b> <b>plaques</b> was significantly higher than those in the cases with stable plaques.

40|$|Diagnostic {{techniques}} to identify <b>vulnerable</b> <b>plaques</b> are rapidly evolving. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) {{has the ability}} to detect and localize plaque as well as quantitate plaque burden. Recent IVUS studies have suggested that patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes have an approximate 25 % incidence of additional ruptured plaques in arteries other than the culprit lesion. The ability of IVUS to detect <b>vulnerable</b> <b>plaques</b> before rupture is currently being evaluated by novel techniques. Initially, IVUS was shown to be able to characterize plaque broadly as calcified or fibrofatty but was limited in its ability to more precisely detect lipid-rich plaques, necrotic cores, and thrombus. Recent advances in new applications of IVUS, such as integrated backscatter, wavelet analysis, and virtual histology, have focused on evaluating and mathematically transforming the radiofrequency signal from ultrasound waves into a color-coded representation of plaque characteristics such as lipid, fibrous tissue, calcification, and necrotic core. In addition, targeted contrast agents, applicable to both intravascular and transthoracic studies, are being evaluated in experimental models and aim to highlight specific plaque components, such as endothelial adhesion molecules and other plaque components that might be useful in targeting <b>vulnerable</b> <b>plaques.</b> These advances pave the way for future clinical trials in assessing the ability of such {{techniques to}} diagnose <b>vulnerable</b> <b>plaques</b> and to assess the effects of both pharmacologic and mechanical therapies on plaque characteristics...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop the first animal model of <b>vulnerable</b> carotid atherosclerotic <b>plaque.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS: Carotid atherosclerotic models were created in 12 Yucatan minipigs by using a combination of partial ligation and high cholesterol diet. Retia mirabilia from these animals were examined histopathologically to identify distal embolism. The association of distal embolism with advanced atherosclerosis and a thin fibrous cap was analyzed by using the Fisher exact test. RESULTS: Typical features of <b>vulnerable</b> <b>plaques,</b> including a thin fibrous cap, necrotic core, and intraplaque hemorrhage, were observed in this swine model of carotid atherosclerosis. Distal embo-lism was detected in retia mirabilia supplied by 7 of 10 carotid arteries with advanced atherosclerotic plaques, compared with 3 of 14 carotid arteries without advanced plaque (P. 05). CONCLUSIONS: This swine model of carotid atherosclerosis contains the salient features of <b>vulnerable</b> <b>plaques,</b> including plaque rupture and distal embolism.

40|$|International audienceCardiovascular {{diseases}} (CVD) are {{the leading}} cause of mortality worldwide. Despite major advances in the treatment of CVD, a high proportion of CVD victims die suddenly while being apparently healthy, the great majority of these accidents being due to the rupture or erosion of a <b>vulnerable</b> coronary atherosclerotic <b>plaque.</b> A non-invasive imaging methodology allowing the early detection of <b>vulnerable</b> atherosclerotic <b>plaques</b> in selected individuals prior to the occurrence of any symptom would therefore be of great public health benefit. Nuclear imaging could allow the identification of vulnerable patients by non-invasive in vivo scintigraphic imaging following administration of a radiolabeled tracer. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of radiotracers that have been recently evaluated for the detection of <b>vulnerable</b> <b>plaques</b> together with the biological rationale that initiated their development. Radiotracers targeted at the inflammatory process seem particularly relevant and promising. Recently, macrophage targeting allowed the experimental in vivo detection of atherosclerosis using either SPECT or PET. A few tracers have also been evaluated clinically. Targeting of apoptosis and macrophage metabolism both allowed the imaging of <b>vulnerable</b> <b>plaques</b> in carotid vessels of patients. However, nuclear imaging of <b>vulnerable</b> <b>plaques</b> at the level of coronary arteries remains challenging, mostly because of their small size and their vicinity with unbound circulating tracer.

40|$|International audienceAtherosclerosis, {{the main}} cause of heart attack and stroke, {{is the leading cause of}} death in most modern countries. Preventing {{clinical}} events depends on a better understanding of the mechanism of atherosclerotic plaque destabilization. Our knowledge on the characteristics of <b>vulnerable</b> <b>plaques</b> in humans has grown past decades. Histological studies have provided a precise definition of high-risk lesions and novel imaging methods for human atherosclerotic plaque characterization have made significant progress. However the pathological mechanisms leading from stable lesions to the formation of <b>vulnerable</b> <b>plaques</b> remain uncertain and the related clinical events are unpredictable. An animal model mimicking human plaque destablization is required as well as an in vivo imaging method to assess and monitor atherosclerosis progression. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly used for in vivo assessment of atherosclerotic plaques in the human carotids. MRI provides well-characterized morphological and functional features of human atherosclerotic plaque which can be also assessed in animal models. This review summarizes the most common species used as animal models for experimental atherosclerosis, the techniques to induce atherosclerosis and to obtain <b>vulnerable</b> <b>plaques,</b> together with the role of MRI for monitoring atherosclerotic plaques in animals...|$|R

Endarterectomy plaques were studied for CSE expression, and the role of CSE in micro-angiogenesis was studied in vitro.
