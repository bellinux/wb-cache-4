40|$|The {{object of}} the diploma thesis is a {{preparation}} of fundamentals for realization for replica of the aircraft L- 40 „Meta Sokol“ matching the requirements of Certification Specification for <b>Very</b> <b>Light</b> <b>Aeroplanes</b> (CS-VLA). The preamble of the work deals with the changes made on the original aircraft necessary to satisfy the criterias of the above-mentioned specification. One of the main contents of {{the first part of}} the thesis is the definition of replica’s basic dimensions and preparation of aerostatic fundamentals, including longitudinal stability control. As next a suitable engine is chosen and calculation of corresponding performances is made. A detailed weight analysis and a determination of centre of gravity position (c. g. position), important for solving the stability of an airplane, is also presented. Finally, a brief description of the manufacturing process of individual components and also factors influencing the technology are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This script {{refers to}} the {{strategic}} design steps followed towards {{the scope of the}} structural optimization of an unmanned air vehicle (UAV). In order to attain the aforementioned aim, the strategy of parameterization has been followed, given the capabilities that modern computer aided design and engineering (CAD and CAE) programs provide to the aeronautical engineer. Accordingly, both the external shell structure and the internal structural parts of the aircraft have been interactively parameterized. The capability to parametrically amend the geometry and material properties of major and/or non-essential structural parts of the aircraft, allowed for several loop-like structural and aerodynamic analyses that led to significant airframe weight reduction of more than 30 % between the initial-coarse and final-optimized structural configurations in a time effective manner. The outcome is a structurally integral aircraft according to the relevant Certification Specifications for <b>Very</b> <b>Light</b> <b>Aeroplanes</b> (CS-VLA) of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).

2500|$|The CLA.2 was {{the first}} {{aircraft}} completed by the Cranwell <b>Light</b> <b>Aeroplane</b> (CLA) club, formed in 1923 by staff and students at the RAF College Cranwell. The students came from No.4 Apprentices Wing and one of their lecturers, Flt-Lt Nicholas Comper, became chief designer of the three aircraft produced by the club as well as one, the CLA.1, that was not finished. The immediate target was the Lympne Two Seater <b>Light</b> <b>Aeroplane</b> Trials of 1924, but the emphasis was on producing a robust machine that could be simply built and maintained at low cost, suitable for flying schools. [...] It was built from wood and fabric covered throughout. Though it probably had the shortest flying career {{of any of the}} CLA's aircraft, {{it was one of the}} most profitable.|$|R

40|$|Flying a <b>light</b> <b>aeroplane</b> {{involves}} {{a combination of}} pilot and aeroplane performing a set task, within a specific environment. The pilot is continuously sampling and selecting available sensory cues, interpreting those cues, making decisions and manipulating the primary controls (stick and rudder) to safely achieve flying objectives. The ‘feel’ of an aeroplane (a flying quality) is directly associated with the stick and rudder forces and how the aeroplane responds to control inputs. Classical theory {{has been applied to}} estimate the apparent (as felt by the pilot) longitudinal stick-free static stability (change of stick force with airspeed) of a typical, two-seat, high-wing <b>light</b> <b>aeroplane.</b> The theory has been extended to consider the effects of tail downwash and flap deflection. The results are compared with actual flight tests and show that the method may be used for the initial assessment of longitudinal stick-free static stability and more importantly, tendencies towards neutral or negative stability affecting flight safet...|$|R
50|$|As {{experimental}} {{aircraft and}} microlights {{have become more}} sophisticated, {{it has become more}} common for such <b>light</b> <b>aeroplanes</b> to fit variable-pitch propellers, both ground-adjustable propellers and in-flight-variable propellers.
