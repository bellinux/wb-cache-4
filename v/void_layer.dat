40|$|The {{effect of}} {{interstitial}} trapping by surface nanovoids, induced by He ion implantation in crystalline Si, is described. The difference {{with respect to}} the effects induced by the deep <b>void</b> <b>layer</b> is evidenced and discussed. Interstitial trapping is investigated by studying the diffusion and the electrical activation of shallow boron implanted in Si. B and He ion implantations were performed on Czochralski bulk and silicon-on-insulator samples in order to isolate the void surface region from the deep <b>void</b> <b>layer.</b> A remarkable reduction of B diffusion is recorded near half the projected range (R-p) of He implantation, which leads to a boxlike shape in the distribution of mobile and electrically active B. Surface nanovoids (2 - 3 nm in size) cause the observed B diffusivity reduction through an enhanced recombination of self-interstitials. Moreover, these surface nanovoids do not hinder the B electrical activation, being the electrically active B dose comparable for the He implanted and the He-free samples. This peculiar effect of He coimplantation at about half the R-p could be used as an efficient interstitial trapping in defect engineering during Si based device processing...|$|E
40|$|Thin {{layers of}} {{titanium}} dioxide were fabricated by direct inkjet patterning of a reverse micelles sol-gel composition onto soda-lime glass plates. Several series of variable thickness samples were produced by repeated overprinting {{and these were}} further calcined at different temperatures. The resulting layers were inspected by optical and scanning electronic microscopy and their optical properties were investigated by spectroscopic ellipsometry {{in the range of}} 200 – 1000 nm. Thus the influence of the calcination temperature on material as well as optical properties of the patterned micellar titania was studied. The additive nature of the deposition process was demonstrated by a linear dependence of total thickness on the number of printed layers without being significantly affected by the calcination temperature. The micellar imprints structure of the titania layer resulted into significant deviation of measured optical constants from the values reported for bulk titania. The introduction of a <b>void</b> <b>layer</b> into the ellipsometric model was found necessary for this particular type of titania and enabled correct ellipsometric determination of layer thickness, well matching the thickness values from mechanical profilometry...|$|E

40|$|Brittle {{solder joints}} in Electroless Ni {{electroless}} Pd immersion Au (ENEPIG) surface finishes {{are one of}} the key reliability issues in electronics assembly. Previous characterization of the reflow process has indicated that interfacial voids formed after solder reflow are responsible for the decreases in solder joint strength. However, the mechanisms behind the formation of these voids in the ENEPIG process remain unclear. In this paper, the interaction between various aspects of the ENEPIG process and solder joint strength were investigated. Surface roughness, morphology, and nano-pitting at the interface between electroless Pd and Ni-P were characterized. The size and density of nano voids inside Ni 2 SnP were measured after the specimens were reflowed with Sn 4 Ag 0 · 5 Cu solder ball. Additionally, high speed shear solder joint strength measurements were made. The results indicated that anion adhesion induced nano-pitting at the interface between the Ni 2 SnP intermetallic and Pd, resulting in the formation of a nano <b>void</b> <b>layer</b> during reflow. These interfacial voids lead to lower solder joint strength. Based on the results, a solution to prevent the brittle solder joint failures is suggested...|$|E
40|$|Structural {{and optical}} {{properties}} of single crystal silicon irradiated with 27. 2 MeV helium ions by using fluences Ф ≥ 10 ¹⁶ ion/cm² were studied at various beam currents. It {{was found that}} at currents 0. 25 to 0. 45 μА, heavily damaged layers containing voids were formed in ion path in Si and behind it. The number of layers in the ion path region depends on the beam intensity. With increasing the beam current up to ~ 1 μA, the layer structures consisting of voids were observed only in the ion path. As helium is poorly soluble in Si, during implantation it collects in the gas-filled vacancy complexes. We consider that, like {{to the case of}} keV-ion implantation at fluences of Ф ≥ 10 ¹⁶ ion/cm², an amorphous layer is created in the ion stopping region at annealing. Moving by recrystallization fronts {{on both sides of the}} amorphous layer, vacancy clusters are collected inside, coalesce and form voids. It is a combination of high energy and high fluence helium implantation that can form layered structure with voids in silicon, as observed by us. At present, there is no strict explanation of the mechanism of voids’ ordering (forming of superlattice of them). Especially, it concerns the <b>void</b> <b>layer</b> formation beyond helium ion path. The concept of mobile solitons is used. Formation of the “lattice” from the voids leads to swelling of the material. Further researches are necessary to understand these processes and control them...|$|E

In addition, the thermal insulating capability of hollow concrete blocks {{in relation to their}} void constitutions was also examined. Test results have shown that a decrease of the volumetric fraction of natural sand in lightweight {{aggregate concrete}} results in a smaller thermal conductivity value (K value).

With the same void content, the no-fine concrete possesses similar thermal conductivity to that of hollow concrete. Accordingly, the hollow concrete blocks and the no-fine concrete blocks, with the K value of only about 0. 1 W/mK- 0. 2 W/mK, are proposed. 本文除探討輕質骨材混凝土(LWAC) 熱傳導係數受天熱砂含量及細骨材組成變化之影響，另外亦討論混凝土孔隙結構與中空混凝土隔熱能力間之關係。試驗結果顯示減少輕質骨材混凝土的天然砂含量，混凝土的熱傳導係數(K值) 將降低。當低砂含量之底灰及石灰石砂充當作細骨材時，輕質骨材混凝土的熱傳導係數(K值) 則分別降低 39 %及 23 %。本試驗也發現中空混凝土若孔隙排列在垂直於熱流方向者越多。則K值越小。若在相同的孔隙含量下，無細混凝土與混凝土空心磚有相近的熱傳導係數，而其K值最低者可達約 0. 1 W/mK~ 0. 2 W/mK之間...|$|R

40|$|Microstructures of Ti 2 AlN {{ceramics}} synthesized {{and simultaneously}} consolidated from starting mixtures of Ti/Al/TiN powders by spark plasma sintering (SPS) were characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, {{focused ion beam}} (FIB) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). When sintered for 10 min at 1300 °C, nearly single-phase Ti 2 AlN ceramics with elongated (∼ 22 × 6 × 6 μm) grains were obtained. After sintering for 10 min at 1200 °C and chemical etching, Ti 2 AlN nanowhiskers (150 – 200 nm dia., 1 – 5 μm long) were exposed in pores coexisting with TiAl, TiN and Ti 2 AlN grains. FIB-TEM studies revealed single-crystal Ti 2 AlN nanowhiskers in a TiAl matrix with orientation relationship [1 1 − 2 0]H//[− 1 0 1]γ, (0 0 0 1) H//(1 1 1) γ, γ = TiAl, H = Ti 2 AlN. The nanowhiskers are believed to form by diffusion of TiN into TiAl during SPS and to be exposed during the chemical etch. Microstructural development during high-temperature oxidation of dense Ti 2 AlN ceramics for 1 h at 1200 °C, more complex layered microstructures containing Al 2 TiO 5, rutile, α-Al 2 O 3 and continuous <b>voids</b> <b>layers</b> form. After heating to 1100 °C for 1 h and cooling to room temperature, planar defects are observed in surface TiO 2 grains identified as stacking faults bounded by partial dislocations. After heating for 1 h at 1400 °C and cooling to room temperature, cracks propagate in TiO 2 grains. It is believed that planar defects and cracks arise from stress generation in the oxide scale. Thermal stresses formed on cooling may arise from thermal expansion mismatch of phases (TiO 2, Al 2 O 3 and Al 2 TiO 5) in the oxide scale, the high anisotropy of thermal expansion in Al 2 TiO 5 and thermal expansion mismatch between the oxide scale and Ti 2 AlN substrate. Growth stresses formed during the isothermal oxidation treatment may arise from the volume changes associated with oxidation reactions of Ti 2 AlN. An oxidation mechanism for Ti 2 AlN ceramics is proposed, which involves initial reaction with atmospheric oxygen to form oxide phases, demixing of the mixed oxide phases, void formation due to the Kirkendall effect and gaseous NOx release.

40|$|In the {{deformation}} of layered {{materials such as}} geological strata, or stacks of paper, mechanical properties compete with the geometry of layering. Smooth, rounded corners lead to <b>voids</b> between <b>layers,</b> while close packing leads to geometrically induced curvature singularities. When creation of voids is penalized by external pressure, the system trades off these competing effects, leading to various accommodating formations. Three two dimensional energy based nonlinear models are presented to describe the formation of voids at areas of intense geological folding. For each model the layers {{are assumed to be}} flexible elastic beams under hard unilateral contact constraint; which are solved as quasi-static obstacle problems with a free boundary. In each case an application of Kuhn-Tucker theory leads to representation as a nonlinear fourth order differential equation. Firstly a single <b>layered</b> model for <b>voiding</b> is presented. An elastic layer is forced into a V-shaped singularity by a uniform overburden pressure, where the fourth order free boundary problem is shown to have a unique, convex, symmetric solution. Drawing parallels with the Kuhn-Tucker theory, virtual work and ideas of duality, the physical significance of this differential equation is emphasised. Finally, appropriate scaling of either the potential energy or the differential equation shows the solutions scale to a single parametric group, for which the size of the void scales inversely with the ratio of overburden pressure to bending stiffness of the layer. Common to structural geology, one or several especially thick layers can dominate the deformation process. As a result, the remaining weak layers must accommodate into the geometry imposed by these competent layers. The second model, extends the first by introducing a plastic hinge to replicate the geometry imposed by the competent layer, and also axial springs to resist the slip over the limbs. The equilibrium equations for the system are investigated using the mathematical techniques developed for the first model. Under rigid loading the system may snap from an initially flat state to a convex voiding solution, as seen in the first model. However, if resistance to slip is high, the slightest imperfection causes the system to jump to a convoluted up-buckled solution, following a de-stiffened path to a point of self contact. These solutions have similarities with the delamination of carbon fibre composites. Finally, we extend the two single layered models to a simple multilayered model, which describes the periodic formation of voids in a chevron fold. The model shows that in the limit of high overburden pressures solutions form <b>voids</b> every <b>layer,</b> producing straight limbs punctured by sharp corners. This analysis shows good agreement when compared with recent experiments. This work provides the basis for future work on the buckling of thin multilayer assemblies in which voids may develop, and emphasizes the importance of the intricate nonlinear constraints of layers fitting together in multilayered folds.

40|$|Partial {{discharge}} (PD) activity {{within a}} void in a dielectric material {{is influenced by}} many factors. One of the factors is the applied voltage waveform on the material. In this paper, a two-dimensional (2 D) model of a cylindrical <b>void</b> in polyethylene <b>layers</b> has been developed using finite element analysis (FEA) software. The model was used to simulate PD activity in the void under square waveform applied voltage. The obtained simulation results were compared with the measurement results from literature. It was found that both results are within reasonable agreement but with only slight disagreement. From comparison, critical parameters from the model affecting PD activity under square waveform applied voltage were identified; they include the inception and extinction voltages and electron generation rate. This finding may increase an understanding of PD behaviour within a void in a dielectric material under square waveform applied voltag...|$|R

The title compound, sodium cadmium orthoarsenate, adopts the olivine [Mg 2 (SiO 4) ] {{structure}} type {{in space}} group Pnma, with Na (site symmetry 1) and Cd (. m.) replacing the two Mg positions, and the AsO 4 tetrahedron (. m.) the SiO 4 tetra-hedron. The crystal structure {{is made up}} of a nearly hexagonal closed-packed arrangement of O atoms stacked along [001]. The Na and Cd atoms occupy one half of the octahedral <b>voids</b> in alternate <b>layers</b> stacked along [100], and one eighth of the tetrahedral voids are occupied by As atoms.

40|$|Gas filled {{cavities}} {{in solid}} insulation can form during production {{and are likely}} to have initial spherical or ellipsoidal geometry; as degradation takes place the shape will distort. Due to the difficulties of producing spherical and ellipsoidal cavity shapes most previous partial discharge (PD) measurements, in polymeric insulations, have used a layered polymer sandwich approach to create flat cylindrical voids. A series of experiments is carried out on air bubble voids inside block polymeric insulation. This paper will investigate and compare the PD repetition rate, PD magnitude, PD distribution plots and the total charge injection in each void for samples with varying sizes of the air bubble. The PD characteristics recorded from these air bubble arrangements will also be compared to those obtained from layered polymer models of similar dimensions. Comparison of the natural and <b>layered</b> <b>void</b> results will provide information on validity of sample production methods...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Massive {{concrete}} structures, like dams, {{are often}} subjected to aggressive attacks. Weathering actions, temperature variation, chemical attacks, abrasion and other degradation processes, can act simultaneously {{on the concrete}} surface and minimise its durability. The maintenance and rehabilitation of the near surface damaged concrete zone, require a good evaluation of its degradation depth. The use of Rayleigh waves in non invasive methods, {{appear to be a}} promising approach for the determination of concrete stiffness profile. Rayleigh waves propagate in cylindrical wave fronts, parallel to the concrete surface, with elliptical particle motion. Their amplitudes decrease exponentially with depth, and most of the energy propagates in a thickness equal to the wavelength. In this paper, applications of recent multistation Rayleigh wave methods were presented. Experiments have been conducted on large volume concrete blocks (8 m 3). Different typical near surface defects common to the downstream wall of concrete dams were induced in these blocks. <b>Voids,</b> heterogeneous <b>layering,</b> deterioration simulating freeze-thaw damage and horizontal fissuring, have been very well detected. Results show that this new technology can be applied on existing full scale concrete structures. Introduction: The deterioration of the near surface concrete in dams and civil engineering structures is being an important problem.
