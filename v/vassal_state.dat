5|$|The {{successful}} defense preserved Siamese {{independence for}} 15 years. Still, {{the war was}} not decisive. The next Burmese invasion in 1563 would force a Siamese surrender in February 1564, and make Ayutthaya a <b>vassal</b> <b>state</b> of Burma for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Amon's reign was in {{the midst}} of a {{transitional}} time for the Levant and the entire Mesopotamian region. To the east of Judah, the Assyrian Empire was beginning to disintegrate while the Babylonian Empire had not yet risen to replace it. To the west, Egypt was still recovering under Psamtik I from its Assyrian occupation, transforming from a <b>vassal</b> <b>state</b> to an autonomous ally. In this power vacuum, many smaller states such as Judah were able to govern themselves without foreign intervention from larger empires.|$|E
5|$|Christian Georgia was {{repeatedly}} attacked starting in 1220, and in 1243 Queen Rusudan formally {{submitted to the}} Mongols, turning Georgia into a <b>vassal</b> <b>state</b> which then became a regular ally in the Mongol military conquests. Hethum I of Cilician Armenia submitted in 1247, and over the following years encouraged other monarchs {{to enter into a}} Christian-Mongol alliance. He sent his brother Sempad to the Mongol court in Karakorum, and Sempad's positive letters about the Mongols were influential in European circles.|$|E

5|$|During {{the period}} 1558–1578, Russia {{dominated}} {{the region with}} early military successes at Dorpat (Tartu) and Narva. Russian dissolution of the Livonian Confederation brought Poland–Lithuania into the conflict, while Sweden and Denmark both intervened between 1559 and 1561. Swedish Estonia was established despite constant invasion from Russia, and Frederick II of Denmark bought the old Bishopric of Ösel–Wiek, which he placed {{under the control of}} his brother Magnus of Holstein. Magnus attempted to expand his Livonian holdings to establish the Russian <b>vassal</b> <b>state</b> Kingdom of Livonia, which nominally existed until his defection in 1576.|$|E
5|$|France, Russia and the United Kingdom {{recognised}} {{the autonomy}} of Greece, which remained a <b>vassal</b> <b>state</b> of the Ottoman Empire. The three powers agreed to a limited intervention in order to convince the Porte to accept {{the terms of the}} convention. A plan to send a naval expedition as a show of force was proposed and adopted. A joint Russian, French and British fleet was sent to exercise diplomatic pressure against Constantinople. The Battle of Navarino (October 1827), fought after a chance encounter, resulted in the destruction of the Turkish-Egyptian fleet.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 1158, {{during the reign of}} Manuel I, that Antioch truly became a vassal of the empire, after Manuel forced Prince Raynald of Châtillon to swear fealty to him in {{punishment}} for Raynald's attack on Byzantine Cyprus. The Greek Patriarch was restored, and ruled simultaneously with the Latin Patriarch. Antioch, weakened by powerless regents after Raynald's capture by the Muslims in 1160, remained a Byzantine <b>vassal</b> <b>state</b> until 1182 when internal divisions following Manuel's death in 1180 hindered the Empire's ability to enforce its claim.|$|E

5|$|Gia Long's {{rule was}} {{noted for its}} Confucian orthodoxy. He overcame the Tây Sơn {{rebellion}} and reinstated the classical Confucian education and civil service system. He moved the capital from Hanoi south to Huế as the country's populace had also shifted south over the preceding centuries, and built up fortresses and a palace in his new capital. Using French expertise, he modernized Vietnam's defensive capabilities. In deference to the assistance of his French friends, he tolerated the activities of Roman Catholic missionaries, something that became increasingly restricted under his successors. Under his rule, Vietnam strengthened its military dominance in Indochina, expelling Siamese forces from Cambodia and {{turning it into a}} <b>vassal</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the Late Classic (c. 600 c. 900), {{alliance}} with Calakmul frequently {{was associated with}} the promise of military support. The fact that Copán, a much more powerful city than Quiriguá, failed to retaliate against its former vassal implies that it feared the military intervention of Calakmul. Calakmul itself was far enough away from Quiriguá that K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat was not afraid of falling directly under its power as a full <b>vassal</b> <b>state,</b> even though it is likely that Calakmul sent warriors to help in the defeat of Copán. The alliance instead seems to have been one of mutual advantage, Calakmul managed to weaken a powerful ally of Tikal while Quiriguá gained its independence.|$|E
5|$|It {{was clear}} from the onset that Stephen's reign in Serbia would be short-lived. The Ottoman sultan Mehmed the Conqueror {{considered}} Stephen's enthronement an unwarranted violation of his own rights, for the Ottomans too considered Serbia their <b>vassal</b> <b>state.</b> Mehmed promptly launched an attack on Smederevo in June, and there was no serious consideration of trying to defend it. King Thomas rushed to his son's aid, trying to divert the Turks by laying siege to their fortress of Hodidjed, in the middle of Bosnia. Aware that Smederevo could not withstand Mehmed's attack, Stephen surrendered the fortress on 20 June. The Ottoman proceeded to annex the rest of the Serbian state to their empire within a year.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} of the rulers of Copán before the {{founding}} of a new dynasty with its origins at Tikal in the early 5thcentury AD, although the city's origins {{can be traced back}} to the Preclassic period. After this, Copán became one of the more powerful Maya city states and was a regional power in the southern Maya region, although it suffered a catastrophic defeat at the hands of its former <b>vassal</b> <b>state</b> Quirigua in 738, when the long-ruling king Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil was captured and beheaded by Quirigua's ruler K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat (Cauac Sky). Although this was a major setback, Copán's rulers began to build monumental structures again within a few decades.|$|E
5|$|Supported by the Han military, Minyue was {{established}} in 202 BC and Eastern Ou in 192 BC {{after the fall of}} the Qin dynasty. Zhao Tuo, a former Chinese commander of the Qin, established Nanyue in 208 BC after the death of the emperor Qin Shi Huang. Emperor Gaozu, first emperor of the Han dynasty, approved Zhao Tuo's new title as king. Zhao was born in the city of Zhending in Central China, and the ruling class of the new kingdom was composed of Chinese officials from the former Qin dynasty. In 180 BC, Zhao offered to submit as a <b>vassal</b> <b>state</b> and the Han accepted, a decision partly based on his family's northern Chinese ancestry.|$|E
5|$|The Kingdom of Mysore was {{a kingdom}} in {{southern}} India, traditionally {{believed to have}} been founded in 1399 {{in the vicinity of the}} modern city of Mysore. The kingdom, which was ruled by the Wodeyar family, initially served as a <b>vassal</b> <b>state</b> of the Vijayanagara Empire. With the decline of the Vijayanagara Empire (c. 1565), the kingdom became independent. The 17th century saw a steady expansion of its territory and during the rule of Narasaraja Wodeyar I and Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar, the kingdom annexed large expanses of what is now southern Karnataka and parts of Tamil Nadu to become a powerful state in the southern Deccan.|$|E

5|$|The {{early history}} of the site is lost due to the catastrophic defeat of the polity in AD 735 by the nearby Petexbatun kingdom with its capital at Dos Pilas, {{resulting}} {{in the destruction of}} its earlier sculpted monuments. Seibal was reduced to being a <b>vassal</b> <b>state</b> until the destruction of the Petexbatun kingdom in the late 8th century AD. In AD 830 a new elite installed itself at the site with the arrival of Wat'ul Chatel from Ucanal to the east. This new arrival reinvigorated Seibal and allowed it to last to the dawn of the 10th century, well after the Classic Maya collapse had engulfed most of the region.|$|E
5|$|Ahmad Maymandi's father, Hasan Maymandi, {{was from}} a town named Maymand in Zabulistan, a region known for its popular traditions about the mythological Iranian warrior Rostam. Hasan was the {{governor}} of Bust under Mahmud's father, Sabuktigin, whose kingdom was then a <b>vassal</b> <b>state</b> of the Samanids, who were the lords of Khorasan, and ruled much of the region through their vassals. During Hasan's governorship of Bust, Sabuktigin crucified him, an action which Sabuktigin later regretted. Maymandi was the foster brother and school-fellow of Mahmud, who was also from Zabulistan on his maternal side. Maymandi began his administrative career in 994 {{as head of the}} department of correspondence during Mahmud's governorship of Khorasan under his Samanid overlords. Maymandi was later promoted to chief accountant and head of the military department. He was also appointed as governor of Bust and Rukhkhaj.|$|E
5|$|During the 7th century CE, a settled {{community}} {{known as}} Vijayapura, a tributary to the Srivijaya empire, {{was thought to}} have existed in northwest Borneo. The earliest kingdom, supposed to have existed from the 9th century, was Po Ni, as recorded in the Chinese geographical treatise Taiping Huanyu Ji. It was believed that Po Ni existed {{at the mouth of}} Brunei River and was the predecessor to the Bruneian Empire. As China had been under the conquest of Mongol Empire, all Chinese <b>vassal</b> <b>state</b> subsequently controlled by the Mongol emperors of China. Early in 1292, Kublai Khan is said to have sending an expedition to northern Borneo, before departing for the invasion of Java in 1293. As a result of this campaign, it is believed that many of his followers in addition to other Chinese traders eventually settled and established their own colony at Kinabatangan River. In the 14th century, Brunei became the <b>vassal</b> <b>state</b> of Majapahit but in 1370 transferred its allegiance to Ming dynasty of China. The Maharaja Karna of Borneo then paid a visit to Nanjing with his family until his death. He was succeeded by his son Hsia-wang who agreed to send tribute to China once every three years. Since then, Chinese junks came to northern Borneo with cargoes of spices, bird nests, shark fins, camphor, rattan and pearls. More Chinese traders eventually settled in Kinabatangan, as stated in both Brunei and Sulu records. A younger sister of Huang Senping (Ong Sum Ping), the Governor of the Chinese settlement then married Sultan Ahmad of Brunei. Perhaps due to this relationship, a burial place with 2,000 wooden coffins, some estimated to be 1,000 years old, were discovered in Agop Batu Tulug Caves and around the Kinabatangan Valley area. It is believed that this type of funeral culture was brought by traders from Mainland China and Indochina to northern Borneo as similar wooden coffins were also discovered in these countries. In addition with the discovery of Chinese ceramics from a shipwreck in Tanjung Simpang Mengayau which estimated to be from 960–1127 A.D. of Song dynasty and Vietnamese Đông Sơn drum in Bukit Timbang Dayang on Banggi Island that had existed between 2,000–2,500 years ago.|$|E

5|$|In early 1018 Vladislav led an {{unsuccessful}} attack against Dyrrhachium, outside whose walls {{he found his}} death. The chronicle asserts that Vladimir appeared before Vladislav when he dined in his camp outside Dyrrhachium, and slew him while he cried for help. In the same year, the Byzantine army—led by the victorious Emperor Basil—terminated the First Bulgarian Empire. As Vladimir and Kosara had no children, his successor was his uncle Dragimir, ruler of Travunia and Zachlumia. Accompanied by soldiers, he set off for Duklja to establish himself as its ruler, probably {{in the first half}} of 1018. When he came to Kotor, the town's inhabitants ambushed and killed him after inviting him to a banquet, and his soldiers returned to Travunia. Duklja was not mentioned again in the sources until the 1030s. Some scholars believe that it was placed under direct Byzantine rule around 1018, while others believe it remained a Byzantine <b>vassal</b> <b>state</b> under an unknown native ruler.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, he {{was soon}} {{restored}} to his position, as he was present in Murad's 1446 campaign against the Morea. Murad was reportedly disheartened by {{the strength of the}} Hexamilion, but Turahan insisted on an assault. Aided by an artillery bombardment, the Ottomans again breached the Byzantine defences and ravaged the Peloponnese at will. As a result, the Morea was now officially reduced to an Ottoman <b>vassal</b> <b>state.</b> In early October 1452, Turahan and his sons Ahmed and Ömer led a large force into the Peloponnese. Sultan Mehmed II ordered them to remain there during the winter in order to prevent despots Thomas and Demetrios from assisting their brother, Emperor Constantine XI, during the Siege of Constantinople in 1453. Turahan again stormed the Hexamilion and penetrated into the Morea, raiding from Corinth through the Argolid and Arcadia to Messenia. The Byzantines put up little resistance after Hexamilion, although Turahan's son Ahmed was captured in an ambush at Dervenakia and imprisoned in Mystras.|$|E
