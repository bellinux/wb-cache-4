40|$|São Paulo state’s <b>vitiviniculture</b> ranks {{second in}} Brazil, being {{characterized}} by the production of table grapes and wines derived from American and hybrid varieties. Despite its economic, social, and environmental benefits, the state’s <b>vitiviniculture</b> has witnessed an increasing dependence on grapes produced in other states over the last decade. Besides adding {{to the cost of}} producing wine in São Paulo, grape imports from the state of Rio Grande do Sul compromises not only product quality, but also the process of creating an identity for the product. To give a new impetus to the production of grapes and wines in São Paulo, the State of São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) developed a project called “Revitalizing São Paulo’s Vitivinicultural Chain,” a joint effort by the state’s Agriculture and Supply Secretariat, Federation of Industries, municipal governments, and main unions and cooperatives of the industry. Data about <b>vitiviniculture</b> was gathered from specific questionnaires given to grape growers and wine producers in the municipalities of Jarinu, Jundiaí, São Miguel Arcanjo, and São Roque. This information enabled the creation of an original database for the state’s sector. The analyses of São Paulo’s vitivinicultural chain conducted through this project allowed us to address policy issues focused on reinforcing special product attributes related to specific territorial resources. This process resulted from the valorization of the characteristic cultural diversity of the state, including the social values constructed by people of Italian, Japanese, and Portuguese heritage {{over the course of the}} region’s history. From this perspective, the project proposed differentiation strategies based on specific territorial resources, primarily typical grape varieties such as the Niagara and the IAC 138 - 22 “Máximo. ” Thus, the strategies aimed at building an identity for the state’s wines include recovering the traditional cultural attributes of São Paulo’s <b>vitiviniculture</b> and developing the production of the local wine grape varieties. territorial resources, development, <b>vitiviniculture.,</b> Agribusiness, Agricultural and Food Policy, Community/Rural/Urban Development, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety, Labor and Human Capital,...|$|E

Field research in 20 wineries as well as interviews with related organizations were carried out {{in order to understand}} which learning mechanisms support innovative strategies adopted by enterprises. Since learning processes are also the result of local interactions, it was necessary to understand whether these interactions produced cooperative links. The results showed that innovations made by the firms were basically incremental. To do so, they use their intrinsic learning processes as well as external agents. These agents can be located in the region or elsewhere. The geographical proximity becomes more relevant for smaller firms. It was still possible to perceive the existence of cooperation in both vertical and horizontal level. Most frequent actions of vertical cooperation occur especially between firms and their suppliers.

40|$|Objectively {{evaluating}} {{the quality of}} a vineyard in the context of climate change is not always simple. Bayesian networks are widely used for knowledge representation and reasoning under uncertainty in natural resource management. There is a rising interest for this methodology as tools for ecological and agronomic modelling. We designed a probabilistic model that takes into account the parameters defining the status of a vineyard with their associated interactions. No such model has been developed before. It includes an inference engine and software. Data were collected from vine-growing experts. The model includes a database with more than 660 grape varieties. For climate, our model uses a classification method (Tonietto and Carbonneau, 2004) involving multivariate measurements of climate on the basis of three indices: heliothermal index (HI), cool night index (CI), and dryness index (DI). Our model should ease assessments of the likely impact of the choices and decisions of vine growers on the quality of new vineyards to be planted. Thanks to this mathematical model, any kind of simulation of climate change based on the international indexes can be performed. Some examples will be presented.

40|$|The {{filamentous}} fungi are {{ubiquitous in}} nature, so their occurrence in natural substrates {{is seen as}} natural. When {{the presence of these}} microorganisms is associated with favourable ecological conditions (e. g., temperature and relative humidity), these may multiply and produce undesirable compounds. Classic examples of this relationship are the production of chlorinated anisoles in cork or of polyphenol oxidases in grapes. More recently, in the sixties of last century, the discovery of the production in food of toxic metabolites - mycotoxins - by filamentous fungi has revolutionized the study of food mycology and created a new field: food mycotoxicology. The occurrence of food outbreaks due to the presence of mycotoxins in food is now well recognized, and even admitted that mycotoxins are closely related to some pests described in the Middle Ages. As in any other row of the agri-food sector, in <b>vitiviniculture</b> field is also possible to find reports on the possible presence of mycotoxins in the vineyard, the grape or its derivatives. However, it is necessary to distinguish between the mere detection of these metabolites and their occurrence at levels that cause harm to health. In this communication we present a historical survey on the detection of mycotoxins in grapes and their derivatives, indicating the case where the presence of the mycotoxin is regarded as a hazard: ochratoxin A. From a perspective of implementing a food safety model, the carry-over of ochratoxin A from grapes to wine will be presented and discussed...|$|E
40|$|Should controversies be cut short? An {{empirical}} {{analysis of}} agri-environmental certifications in the French <b>vitiviniculture</b> When {{we started our}} study about the environmental qualifications of French wines, in 2004 - 2005, the environmental concern {{seemed to be in}} a state of standby. This stagnation worried the actors and fed their controversies. Among the agrobiologists, two camps were confronting one another: they accused each other of impeding the development of organic agriculture. Since 2007, organic viticulture started spectacular growth. Did one side defeat the other? No opponent, no resistance was removed; change did not occur within the organic sphere. It resulted from a growing concern of a few AOC vintners for an authentic terroir quality and the controversy is still running. What is more, the same is occurring among producers within the Protected Denominations of Origin. The analysis of these two different cases shows that the controversy rests upon two divergent interpretations of the use of the organic or Protected Denominations of Origin labels. According to some, the label defines a quality resulting from the application of its regulations and constraints; for others, organic or terroir quality are linked to global approaches aiming at precise goals, but the implementation of which requires constant adaptation to all the specificities of each particular situation. These two interpretations of labels are quite incompatible. Should we therefore clear up the conflict by opting for one or the other side? The analysis of the integrated farming qualification, which, strangely enough, remains in the fringe of the wine environmental turn, helps suggest a negative answer to this question...|$|E
40|$|The {{theme of}} this thesis is the {{landscape}} in its specificity vineyard analyzed as a spatial representation in the building process of the geographical area of viticulture growing {{and the use of}} image of vineyard landscape as spatial landscape of the wine of the regions of Geographical Indication (GI’s) Vale dos Vinhedos, Pinto Bandeira and Monte Belo, Brazil. The objective was to explain the use of vineyard landscape as spatial representation and the images of vineyard landscape as spatial symbol for the wines of GI’s. The theoretical sources to analyze are related to the Critical geography and with the Cultural geography. The organization of the geographic area of the regions of GI’s comes {{within the context of the}} Italian colonization process in which its culture was part of the cultivation of vines. The vineyard regional industry development took the conditions of implementation of GI’s, whose producers associations begun to use images of landscape wine to build wine-region-toponym. The landscape analysis revealed six types of landscapes and a sous-type of traditional wine-growing landscapes and five types of modern wine landscapes, occurring in both natural and constructed features characteristic among these was the Araucaria angustifolia and the use of Platanus acerifolia in support of the vineyards, and is the Etruscan wine growing tradition. The analysis of the landscape wine images used by associations showed that there are significant differences; the most are images of traditional wine landscape. The association of Vale dos Vinhedos and Monte Belo established direct links of wine-region- landscape, but not Pinto Bandeira. The survey showed that landscape is a representational symbol of regional area and of the wine of GI’s from Vale dos Vinhedos, Pinto Bandeira and Monte Belo.

Les sources théoriques sont en lien avec la Géographie Critique et la Géographie Culturelle. L'objectif a été d'expliquer le paysage viticole comme représentation spatiale des régions et d’analyser l'image du paysage viticole comme symbole spatial pour les vins des IP. L'organisation de l'espace géographique des régions des IP s'insère dans le contexte de la colonisation italienne. Le développement de la <b>vitiviniculture</b> régionale a occasionné des conditions de mise en place des IP, dont les associations de producteurs ont utilisé des images de paysages viticoles pour construire le lien espace-région-toponyme-vin.

ProCa was applied at preblooming and CT was carried out at veraison in two consecutive years. Different physicochemical parameters and analyses of phenolic compounds were carried out in control, CT and ProCa grapes and wines and wine sensory was performed. Thinning treatments decreased crop yield, besides ProCa application reduced berry size, and berry weight. Color and phenolic composition of Grenache and Tempranillo wines in general were affected by thinning treatments, with an increase in anthocyanin, flavanol and flavonol concentrations. In sensory analysis, wines obtained from thinned vines presented higher values for several aromatic (e. g., white and yellow fruits, fresh flowers) and taste attributes (i. e., astringency, bitternes, persistence). CT and ProCa treatments resulted in an improvement in wine quality.
