5|$|Directional {{stability}} {{was achieved}} by four fixed vanes, two <b>vertical</b> and two horizontal, attached {{at the rear of}} the gas-bag, and by a long <b>vertical</b> vane running along the main axis of the gas-bag from the centre of the elliptical frame to its rear. Horizontal motion was controlled by the movement of a balanced rudder at the rear of an empennage on a long boom, mounted below the gas-bag and aft of the gondola (see lead image). The empennage consisted of <b>vertical</b> and horizontal vanes arranged like the fletching of an arrow, behind which the <b>vertical</b> rudder was mounted. During a refit in 1907 the <b>vertical</b> vanes of the empennage were modified, as is shown in the accompanying illustration.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{present a}} novel {{approach}} to develop scalable systems and services for preserving digital content generated from various application domains. The aim is to deliver an integrative scalable approach for digital content preservation across domain <b>verticals.</b> This would involve consolidating approaches for modeling document workflow, preserving the integrity of heterogeneous data, and developing robust and scalable tools for digital preservation ensuring interoperability across domains <b>verticals.</b> The authors consider various application domains including: healthcare, public, business and finance, media and performing art, and education. The authors focus on specific case studies of digital content preservation across the considered domain <b>verticals.</b> The authors describe an integrative framework for digital content preservation across domain <b>verticals.</b> This framework is developed at four levels and attempts to abstract and integrate the digital content workflow across domain <b>verticals.</b> The authors suggest a test bed to validate our integrative approach for digital content preservation. This integrates the digital content preservation activity along the value chain of domain <b>verticals...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{crucifix}} measures 448cm x 390cm and {{consists of}} five basic physical components; a <b>vertical</b> board reaching from the base to the cymatium onto which Christ is nailed, two horizontal cross-arms, and two <b>vertical</b> pieces acting as aprons adjacent to the central board. There are another eight minor pieces; mostly terminals, bases or framing devices. The structure is reinforced by two full length <b>vertical</b> battens. The horizontal cross-arms extend the full width of his outstretched body and are slotted into ridges in the <b>vertical</b> supports. The timber would have been cut and arranged by carpenters before Cimabue applied his design and paintwork.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Search result {{diversification}} {{has been}} effectively employed to tackle query ambiguity, {{particularly in the}} context of web search. However, ambiguity can manifest differently in different search <b>verticals,</b> with ambiguous queries spanning, e. g., multiple place names, content genres, or time periods. In this paper, we empirically investigate the need for diversity across four different <b>verticals</b> of a commercial search engine, including web, image, news, and product search. As a result, we introduce the problem of aggregated search result diversification as the task of satisfying multiple information needs across multiple search <b>verticals.</b> Moreover, we propose a probabilistic approach to tackle this problem, as a natural extension of state-of-the-art diversification approaches. Finally, we generalise standard diversity metrics, such as ERR-IA and α-nDCG, into a framework for evaluating diversity across multiple search <b>verticals.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|Constant {{pressure}} charts normally contain plotted {{values of}} temperature, humidity, wind, and the <b>vertical</b> height {{above sea level}} of the pressure surface. They {{have a variety of}} uses. In the mountainous terrain of the western United States and Mexican Plateau, the 850 hPa pressure surface can be a more realistic depiction of the weather pattern than a standard surface analysis. Using the 850 and 700 hPa pressure surfaces, one can determine when and where warm advection (coincident with upward <b>vertical</b> motion) and cold advection (coincident with downward <b>vertical</b> motion) is occurring within the lower portions of the troposphere. Areas with small dewpoint depressions and are below freezing indicate the presence of icing conditions for aircraft. The 500 hPa pressure surface {{can be used as a}} rough guide for the motion of many tropical cyclones. Shallower tropical cyclones, which have experienced <b>vertical</b> wind shear, tend to be steered by winds at the 700 hPa level.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the lateral dispersion (by invertebrates and deer) there is also importance {{in the fact that}} burial (<b>vertical</b> dispersion) by ants (or other vectors) increases the survival of new plants by two mechanisms. First, <b>vertical</b> dispersion ensures sufficient depth to preserve the seeds through their dormancy (Trillium seeds are normally dormant for their first year). Second, <b>vertical</b> dispersion ensures adequate anchorage of the rhizomes. This is particularly important for young plants because their small rhizomes, with few & short roots, are easily dislodged (e.g. frost heaveal and other erosion factors) and desiccated.|$|E
5|$|In {{the cases}} of Lake-effect snow and polar lows, the {{convective}} systems form over warm water bodies when cold air sweeps over their surface and leads {{to an increase in}} moisture and significant <b>vertical</b> motion.
