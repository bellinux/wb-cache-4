Approximately ten medullary <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> and a sclerenchymatous ring are in the inner cortex, and all the cortical <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> apparently develop. Both medullary <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> and cortical <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> continue to grow (Fig.  2 f), and a ring of sclerenchyma gradually forms (Fig.  2 g).

The medullary <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> scarcely change while the peripheral <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> soon exceed the medullary <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> (Fig.  2 h), wide rays fully develop, and the sclerenchymatous ring remains continuous. The species P. kadsura belongs to this type.|$|R

The {{purpose of this study is}} to make clear the microscopic structure in the bamboo culm and the arrangement of the <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> in nodal region and diaphragm. Using Mosochiku (Phyllostachys pubescens MAZEL) grown at Kyushu district, the structure in its bamboo culm and the arrangement of the <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> in nodal region and diaphragm were observed microscopically. The main results observed are summarized as follows: (1) The <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> run straight through the stem wall at the node curving somewhat outwardly or inwardly (Photos, 6, 7, 10, 11, 15 and 16). (2) The <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> run into the bamboo-sheath (Photos. 1, 3, 10 (b), 11 and 16). ⓐ The <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> run directly into the bamboo-sheath from the inner parts of the nodal diaphragm. ⓑ The <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> run directly into the bamboo-sheath from the lower internode along the epidermis. (3) The <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> run into of out of the nodal diaphragm (Photos. 10 (b), 11, 15 and 16). ⓐ The <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> run into the bamboo-sheath from the nodal diaphragm. ⓑ The <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> run into the upper internode along the epidermis from the nodal diaphragm. ⓒ The <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> run into the upper internode along the endodermis from the nodal diaphragm. ⓓ The <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> running along the epidermis run in the direction of thickness of the stem wall curving inwardly, and run straight into the nodal diaphragm. ⓔ The <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> running along the epidermis run into the diaphragm curving inwardly. (4) The <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> running in the lower internode along the endodermis run in the direction of thickness of the stem wall curving outwardly, and they run into the upper internode along the epidermis (Photos. 10 (b) and 16). (5) The <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> in the nodal diaphragm make the complicated arrangement (Photos. 11 and 13 ～ 16, and Fig. 4). ⓐ The <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> run straight through the nodal diaphragm. ⓑ The <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> run roud in bundle along the stem wall in the upper border of the nodal diaphragm and run into the stem wall. ⓒ In the nodal diaphragm, the <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> generally make the reticulated arrangement...|$|R

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this work was to {{evaluate}} the importance of <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> on the physical and mechanical properties of date palm. To prepare experimental samples, two trees (Phoenix dactylifera) with the average diameter of 47 cm were freshly cut from Ahvaz countryside in Khoozestan Province. Cubic samples with dimensions of 2 cm (tangential) × 2 cm (radial) × 2 cm (longitudinal) were taken from different heights of date palm trunk (2, 5 and 7 meter). The anatomical (number, diameter and cross-cut area of single <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles),</b> physical (density) as well as mechanical properties (<b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> tension strength and modulus of elasticity) were studied. The {{results showed that the}} calculated total area of <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> per 400 mm 2 was maximum for samples near the bark (33 % of total area) and the value gradually decreased to 27 % for specimens around the pith. The number of <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> increase was observed while moving from the pith to the bark. The same variation also attained when the height of date palm stem increased. But for the average values of single <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> diameter and cross-cut area, no regular trend of increase or decrease was observed. For mechanical properties of <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles,</b> the results revealed that tensile strength and modulus of elasticity were greater for specimens close to the pith in comparison with the values of samples near the bark.

30|$|A key for {{the seven}} species is provided, based on the {{internal}} stem anatomy. The seven Piper species climb via adventitious roots, and in cross section, the stems were generally eccentric and oblate, although a transversely elliptic stem was found in P. kadsura (Choisy) Ohwi and P. sintenense Hatus. A cambial variant with secondary growth of external primary <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> and xylem in plates was observed in all species except Piper betle L., which developed another cambium variant with xylem furrowed deeply by parenchyma proliferation. The sclerenchymatous ring surrounding the medullary <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> was always continuous except in P. betle, where it was discontinuous. Mucilage canals varied from absent to present {{in the center of}} the pith, or present in the pith and inner cortex. Different sizes of vessels dispersed throughout the stem were ring or diffuse porous. The numbers of medullary and peripheral <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> were distinctive and the widths of rays were noticeably different in each species. Differences in the growth rate of the medullary <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> produced two development types of <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles,</b> although in both types, the peripheral <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> gradually lengthen and become separated from each other by wide rays.|$|R
30|$|Several {{studies have}} {{characterized}} cambial variants in certain Piper species. Piper obtusilimbum C. DC. has a typical arrangement of tissues (Tepe et al. 2007), with a parenchymatous pith, medullary <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles,</b> a sclerenchymatous cylinder, peripheral <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles,</b> and a <b>vascular</b> cambium. The stem of Piper betle L. had an inner irregular circle of primary <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> interspersed {{with a large}} mucilage canal in the pith, more mucilage canals in the inner cortex, an undulating wall of sclerenchyma, and an outer ring of smaller cortical <b>bundles.</b> The primary <b>vascular</b> (medullary) <b>bundles</b> occupied the pith (Beck 2011). Raman et al. (2012) showed that the stem of P. betle has a ring of mucilage canals located between cortical and medullary rings of primary <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles,</b> a central mucilage canal in the pith, secretory cells in the cortex, cortical fibers, and an endodermis with a Casparian strip. The descriptions of P. betle here do not match each other owing {{to the age of}} the stem. Beck (2011) showed that the stem of P. excelsum G. Forst. had two medullary bundles that occupied {{the very center of the}} pith. The species had two cylinders of <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles.</b> The central, irregularly grouped primary <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> were enclosed by a thick cylinder of secondary xylem capped by phloem that is separated by wider medullary rays of primary parenchyma.|$|R
30|$|The vessel {{arrangement}} {{in the secondary}} xylem was diffuse porous in P. arborescens (Fig.  1 a), and ring porous in P. kawakamii (Fig.  1 e). A ring of sclerenchyma separated the rings of medullary <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> and peripheral <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> and was continuous in all species except P. betle (Fig.  1 c). P. betle developed a deeply furrowed xylem cambial variant by parenchyma proliferation, which is {{not found in the}} other six species. The mucilage canals varied from absent (P. sintenense and P. taiwanense) to present {{in the center of the}} pith (P. arborescens, P. kadsura, P. kawakamii, and P. kwashoense; Fig.  1 a, d–f) or present in the pith and inner cortex (P. betle; Fig.  2 a). The maximum and minimum width of rays differed from each other in all species except P. sintenense, which had rays of a uniform width (Fig.  1 g). The medullary <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> persist but their growth is eventually minimal, while the peripheral <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> continue to develop as the stem increases in diameter, and secondary thickening is restricted to the peripheral <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> (Fig.  2 a–d) due to the fascicular cambia that are located between the phloem and xylem of the peripheral <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles.</b>|$|R

30|$|Cambial {{variants}} of liana stems {{are divided into}} two types: those that originate from a single cambium and those from multiple cambia (Angyalossy et al. 2012). Members of Piperaceae such as Manekia obtusa (Miq.) T. Arias, Callejas and Bornst produce the external vascular cylinders type (Angyalossy et al. 2015); in the present study, all seven Piper species also developed two series of primary <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> separated by a ring of sclerenchyma. The outer irregular series of primary <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles,</b> or cortical <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles,</b> always developed near the cortex or periderm. The inner irregular series of <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles,</b> the medullary <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles,</b> were always found around {{the center of the}} stem. The stem of P. gorgonillense produced wide, lignified rays, with solitary or clustered vessels (Trueba et al. 2015), and the stem of P. sarmentosum has a discontinuous ring of collenchyma in the outer cortex (Raman et al. 2012); these characteristics were not observed in this study. The stem of P. obtusilimbum has a typical arrangement of tissues (Tepe et al. 2007), but lacks mucilage canals in the pith or in the inner cortex.|$|R

40|$|Plants make {{full use}} of light signals to {{determine}} the timing of flowering. In Arabidopsis thaliana, a blue/UV-A photoreceptor, CRYPTOCHROME 2 (cry 2), and a red/far-red photoreceptor, PHYTOCHROME B (phyB), are two major photoreceptors that control flowering. The light stimuli for the regulation of flowering are perceived by leaves. We have recently shown that phyB expression in mesophyll but not in <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> suppresses {{the expression of a}} key flowering regulator, FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), in <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles.</b> In this study, we asked where in the leaf cry 2 perceives light stimuli to regulate flowering. To answer this question, we established transgenic Arabidopsis lines in which the cry 2 –green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion was expressed under the control of organ/tissue-specific promoters in a cry 2 -deficient mutant background. Analysis of these lines revealed that expression of cry 2 -GFP in <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles,</b> but not in epidermis or mesophyll, rescued the late flowering phenotype. We further confirmed that cry 2 -GFP expressed in <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles</b> increased FT expression only in <b>vascular</b> <b>bundles.</b> Hence, in striking contrast with phyB, cry 2 most likely regulates FT expression in a cell-autonomous manner...|$|R
