40|$|Many {{studies have}} claimed that hemispheric {{processing}} is split precisely at the foveal midline and so place great emphasis on the precise location at which words are fixated. These claims are based on experiments in which a variety of fixation procedures were used to ensure fixation accuracy but {{the effectiveness of these}} procedures is unclear. We investigated this issue using procedures matched to the original studies and an eye-tracker to monitor the locations actually fixated. Four common types of fixation cues were used: cross, two <b>vertical</b> <b>gapped</b> lines, two <b>vertical</b> <b>gapped</b> lines plus a secondary task in which a digit was presented at the designated fixation point, and a dot. Accurate fixations occurred on < 35 % of trials for all fixation conditions. Moreover, despite the usefulness often attributed to a secondary task, no increase in fixation accuracy was produced in this condition. The indications are that split-fovea theory should not assume that fixation of specified locations occurs in experiments without appropriate eye-tracking control or, indeed, that consistent fixation of specified locations is plausible under normal conditions of word recognition. 1454...|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} major advantages: high gun {{placement}}, smaller turret size and simpler fitment of an autoloader. High gun placement allows for better depression angles, reduces the exposed {{part of the}} tank when using hull down positions, and reduces the <b>vertical</b> <b>gap</b> between line of sights and line of the gun. The fact that fully elevated gun does not cross the turret ring allows to reduce turret ring diameter hence width of the vehicles hull and/or mounting the more powerful gun. Autoloader mechanism is simpler and works more reliably when the gun is not moving relative to it.|$|E
50|$|Barnwell's {{response}} was again {{to design a}} full-scale aircraft which had the simplifications of a typical wind tunnel model, to which could be fitted any of several cowlings over the Jupiter engine; the Type 92 was the result. It was a two-bay biplane without stagger or sweep on the equal span, square-tipped wings. These and the tail unit, which was also very rectangular and simple, were fabric-covered steel strip and tube structures. Part of the Type 92's odd appearance came from the wish to minimise wing-fuselage aerodynamic interactions. To achieve this, the <b>vertical</b> <b>gap</b> between the wings was large: at 9 ft (2.74 m) it was 25% of the span. The undercarriage had a wide track and was a single axle arrangement mounted below {{the ends of the}} inner interplane struts.|$|E

The monorails are ADA-accessible and stroller-accessible, {{though there is a}} <b>vertical</b> <b>gap</b> between the monorails and the platforms, so wheelchair users must use a portable ramp, located at each station, to board the monorail. The monorail system opened in 1971 with the Magic Kingdom [...] "Resort" [...] and [...] "Express" [...] monorail lines; the former runs in a loop between Magic Kingdom and the TTC via the Polynesian, Grand Floridian, and Contemporary Resorts, while the latter bypasses the resorts and goes directly between the TTC and Magic Kingdom via a parallel loop.

50|$|On average, fatal {{injuries}} occur {{outside the}} school bus {{at a rate of}} four times those occurring inside the bus; besides being struck and killed by other vehicles, the greatest number of child fatalities occur by the right rear tire of the student’s own bus. Since the 1970-1971 school year, the Kansas State Department of Education has compiled an annual National School Bus Loading and Unloading Survey, detailing fatalities occurring in the danger zone surrounding school buses on which an MDZ Shield is not present. According to the reports, from the 2004-2005 through 2010-2011 school years, there have been 48 fatalities involving the school bus while loading and unloading. Of those, half were caused by the right rear wheels. Of all fatalities involving the rear wheels, 83% took place {{on the right side of}} the bus. The reports have shown that in a majority of cases involving the wheels, children first incur injuries by coming in contact with the tire before being propelled underneath the bus wheels. In addition to the 10 feet surrounding the school bus, there is typically an approximately 2 foot <b>vertical</b> <b>gap</b> in front of the rear wheels between the undercarriage and the ground, in which a child is at increased risk of coming in contact with the tire.|$|E

5000|$|Within the {{designation}} [...] "1080i", the i stands for interlaced scan. A frame of 1080i video {{consists of two}} sequential fields of 1920 horizontal and 540 vertical pixels. The first field consists of all odd-numbered TV lines and the second all even numbered lines. Consequently, the horizontal lines of pixels in each field are captured and displayed with a one-line <b>vertical</b> <b>gap</b> between them, so {{the lines of the}} next field can be interlaced between them, resulting in 1080 total lines. 1080i differs from 1080p, where the p stands for progressive scan, where all lines in a frame are captured at the same time. In native or pure 1080i, the two fields of a frame correspond to different instants (points in time), so motion portrayal is good (50 or 60 motion phases/second). This is true for interlaced video in general and can be easily observed in still images taken of fast motion scenes. However, when 1080p material is captured at 25 or 30 frames/second, it is converted to 1080i at 50 or 60 fields/second, respectively, for processing or broadcasting. In this situation both fields in a frame do correspond to the same instant. The field-to-instant relation is somewhat more complex for the case of 1080p at 24 frames/second converted to 1080i at 60 fields/second.|$|E

Objective. The aim {{of the present study}} was to observe the changes in vertical and horizontal marginal bone levels in platform-switched and platform-matched dental implants. Materials and Methods. 51 patients received 60 dental implants in the present study over a 1 -year period. Measurement was performed between the implant shoulder and the most apical and horizontal marginal defect by periapical radiographs to examine the changes of peri-implant alveolar bone before and 12 months after prosthodontic restoration delivery. Results. These marginal bone measurements showed a bone gain of 0. 23 ± 0. 58 [*]mm in the <b>vertical</b> <b>gap</b> and 0. 22 ± 0. 53 [*]mm in the horizontal gap of platform matching, while in platform switching a bone gain of 0. 93 ± 1 [*]mm (P< 0. 05) in the <b>vertical</b> <b>gap</b> and 0. 50 ± 0. 56 [*]mm in the horizontal gap was found.

40|$|Shallow skirted {{foundations}} can mobilize uplift {{resistance from}} end bearing {{in the short}} to medium term. However, uncertainty exists over the magnitude of reverse end bearing resistance compared with resistance in compression, and how this might be affected by {{a gap between the}} external face of the foundation skirt and the adjacent soil. The study presented in this paper explores this problem through centrifuge model tests, investigating the effect of skirt embedment ratio on (i) the magnitude of reverse end bearing capacity compared with compression capacity, (ii) the uplift displacement associated with spontaneous loss of suction during uplift, and (iii) the existence of a <b>vertical</b> <b>gap</b> along the external skirt-soil interface. The results show that (i) peak uplift capacity equivalent to compression capacity can be mobilized for a fully sealed foundation with an intact skirt-soil interface, (ii) suction required for reverse end bearing can be maintained through considerable foundation displacement, even for a low skirt embedment ratio, and (iii) the presence of a <b>vertical</b> <b>gap</b> along the external skirt-soil interface causes abrupt loss of suction beneath the top plate after minimal foundation displacement, with subsequent uplift capacity being markedly reduced. </p...|$|E
