40|$|The author {{narrative}} and the player narrative are distinct and separate parts {{that make up}} the whole of <b>videogame</b> literature. The <b>videogame</b> medium encourages a mixed-media understanding of conventions and the rejection of essentialism that leads to, inspires, and facilitates the player narrative. <b>Videogame</b> literatures require discreet actions that, as part of any possible reading, the player must do [...] and in doing the player must make a choice with mind and body that involves a human-to-machine expression of agency within constraints that define the player narrative. So the decision making process in <b>videogame</b> storytelling is that human-to-machine interaction that can be understood as both the means by which the <b>videogame</b> story progresses, and the process by which the player wields his or her narrative within the procedural possibility space. <b>Videogame</b> literary analysis requires understanding how players make those decisions, understanding how the player leverages media conventions in order to wield power over the narrative, and understanding what role the player has in <b>videogame</b> storytelling. The choice dynamics of a <b>videogame</b> narrative are the key narrative elements within <b>videogame</b> literature that provide players and researchers tools for evaluating choice opportunities within <b>videogame</b> literature toward forming {{a better understanding of the}} space between and connection to the author {{narrative and}} the player narrative. All of these analyses combine to form a picture of decision making processes in <b>videogame</b> literature that are complex and contradictory path making endeavors that define the narrative experience in <b>videogame</b> literature, and the interconnected dynamics of the author and player narrative space.

40|$|Part 2 : Use and Evaluation of Digital EntertainmentInternational audienceThe aim of {{the study}} is to propose a {{conceptual}} model which predicts consumer <b>videogame</b> engagement triggered by the playful-consumption experience of videogame-play. The proposed conceptual model is based on a review of past literature on experience and engagement in <b>videogame</b> studies. Moreover, this study employs the hedonic theory of consumption experience and the concept of consumer engagement in order to conceptualize and operationalize the construct of playful-consumption experience and consumer <b>videogame</b> engagement and accordingly, develops the conceptual model. Based on the conceptual model, this study has drawn related hypothesis. This study is unique in its investigation as it examines the idea of experience from the perspective of hedonic theory of consumption experience and whereas, engagement is studied from the previous work on consumer engagement. Besides, this conceptual model is new in the field of <b>videogame</b> literature that examines consumer <b>videogame</b> engagement and playful consumption experience concurrently and this model also predicts consumer <b>videogame</b> engagement that is provoked by the playful-consumption experience of <b>videogame</b> play...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to develop a new {{instrument}} to measure engagement in <b>videogame</b> play termed as consumer <b>videogame</b> engagement. The study followed the scale development procedure to develop an instrument to measure the construct of consumer <b>videogame</b> engagement. In this study, we collected the data in two different phases comprising study 1 (n= 136) and study 2 (n= 270). We employed SPSS 22. 0 for exploratory factor analysis using study 1 respondents to explore the factors for consumer <b>videogame</b> engagement and reliability analysis. Results of EFA resulted with six-factor solution. We further used SmartPLS 3. 0 software on study 2 respondents to further confirm the six-factor solution as reflective measurement model on the first-order level, and three second-order formative constructs on the second-order or higher-order level as formative measurement model. Results of the reflective measurement model and formative measurement model evidenced that consumer <b>videogame</b> engagement has strong psychometric properties and is a valid instrument to measure engagement in <b>videogame</b> play. Results also confirmed that consumer <b>videogame</b> engagement is a multidimensional construct as well as a reflective-formative construct.

40|$|Though {{theorists have}} long {{regarded}} spatiality {{as an essential}} facet of the <b>videogame,</b> {{the figure of the}} player has been largely absent from this research. In the language of Michel de Certeau, <b>videogame</b> space is theorized as 'from above', and outside of the direct experience of the player. Therefore, this article seeks to re-place the figure of the player as central within a theoretical schema of <b>videogame</b> space, and gesture towards the study of <b>videogame</b> space 'from below'. Through the theoretical framework provided by de Certeau, we can understand the player in space as more prone to error, appropriation and unintended movements through <b>videogame</b> diegeses. The player is comparable to de Certeau's city walker, and theory which instead finds itself at the perspective of the bureaucrat, looking down on the <b>videogame</b> 'from above', can never fully account for the player.

40|$|Theorists {{have long}} {{regarded}} spatiality {{as an essential}} facet of the <b>videogame,</b> and recent years have seen {{a dramatic increase in}} the emergence of space-focussed research. However, the figure of the player has been largely absent from this research, and the role of player action remains under-theorised in understandings of <b>videogame</b> spatiality. Generally, the internal, diegetic space of the <b>videogame</b> has been conceived of in static terms in order for any sort of analysis to be performed. In the language of De Certeau, <b>videogame</b> space is frequently imagined as 'from above', and outside of the direct experience of the player. This paper seeks to re-place the figure of the player as central within analyses of <b>videogame</b> space, and point towards the study of <b>videogame</b> space 'from below'. Unlike more traditional critical frameworks surrounding physical space, the spatial diegesis of the <b>videogame</b> is both conceptual and affordance-based. Consequently, though physical space may be repurposed and contested (as in Rasmussen's Experiencing Architecture (1959)), the player's place in <b>videogame</b> space is far more constitutive. Thus, the toolset and possibilities for action of the player form a critical frame for spatial design. Therefore, this paper argues that the design of <b>videogame</b> space is fundamentally inseparable from its use. Through close analysis of Valve's Portal (2007) from the perspective of space/use and the figure of the player, this paper will examine the possibilities of spatial analysis 'from below'...|$|R

25|$|Observers have {{generally}} described Gamergate {{as part of}} a long-running culture war against efforts to diversify the traditionally male video gaming community, particularly targeting outspoken women. They cite Gamergate supporters' frequent harassment of female figures in the gaming industry and its overt hostility toward people involved in social criticism and analysis of video games. Vox said that Gamergate supporters were less interested in criticizing ethical issues than in opposition to social criticism and analysis of video games and in harassment of prominent women.
