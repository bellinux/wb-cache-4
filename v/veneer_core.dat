5000|$|Cabinet {{frames and}} doors may be {{fashioned}} from solid wood (typically {{a species of}} hardwood), medium density fiberboard (MDF), particle board, plywood, or a combination, and may include lamination or a surface coating over these core materials. A floating panel in a door can be hardwood-veneer plywood captured within a solid wood or MDF frame. Solid wood and MDF can be edge-shaped, e.g., to round or pattern the edges of doors, drawer fronts, or face frames. Particle board, once manufactured, cannot be edge-shaped suitably. Plywood cannot be shaped without revealing its <b>veneer</b> <b>core,</b> often considered unsightly, though edge-shaped furniture-grade plywood with thin plies 1/16 in is considered attractive for limited uses. MDF, once shaped, can be coated conformally with flexible veneers such as thermofoil or can be painted. It can also be covered with wood veneer or high-pressure laminate {{but only if the}} edge profile is square or approximately so (to within the veneer thickness). Today many cabinet doors and drawer fronts utilize an MDF core. Doors and drawer fronts may also be fashioned of particle board surfaced with high-pressure laminate. Natural wood offers its subtle combination of color, grain, pore pattern, variable absorption and smoothness of finish, and variation with viewing angle and lighting condition. The appearance of natural wood can only be achieved with solid wood components (wherever edges are shaped) or possibly veneer (where they are not); as already pointed out, the two approaches can be combined in a single cabinet. Various transparent grain-revealing finishes including shellac, lacquer, varnish, or polyurethane have been devised. A built-up finish may optionally utilize diverse pigments, dyes, bleaches, glazes, or wood fillers that may highlight contrasting colorants. Finishes can be applied by brush or spray and may comprise many separately applied layers. Accordingly, finishes formulated by differing manufacturers do not, in general, exactly match. Distressing the wood cabinets is another finish application and is often done in conjunction with glazes, stains, paints or dyes. This process consists of adding manufactured imperfections to cabinet doors to give the wood cabinets an aged, distressed, old-world rustic appearance. Common techniques include creating wormholes, rasping, dings and dents and sanding through the wood and layers of finish unevenly.|$|E

Then, using the CAD CAM machine, 20 zirconia cores of Vita in Ceram YZ Cubes and 20 zirconia cores of IPS e. max zirCAD were provided. Half of the cores were provided using Vita VM 9 porcelain and the other half were veneered with the use of IPS e. max ceram. In groups one to four, Vita <b>Core</b> and <b>Veneer,</b> Vita <b>Core</b> and Ivoclar <b>Veneer,</b> Ivoclar <b>Core</b> and Vita <b>Veneer,</b> and Ivoclar <b>Core</b> and <b>Veneer</b> were used respectively. Afterwards, the samples were put under the static force in the Universal Test machine (UTM) with the speed of 0 / 5 mm per minute to bring about fracture. The type of fracture was determined by electronic microscope. Schmitz-Schulmeyer Test was applied to evaluate the shear bond strength of core-veneer. In order to analyze the data, Two-Way ANOVA and logestic regression were carried out using SPSS 19 (α= 0. 05). Results: The rate of shear bond strength for groups one to four were 10. 85  2. 67, 10. 35  3. 30, 10. 35  3. 30 and 6. 72  2. 47 mega pascal respectively. The type of core had no effects on shear bond strength (P= 0. 869), but the veneer kind was important in the rate of shear bond strength (P= 0. 027). The Vita veneer showed a higher level of shear bond strength. After the microscopic evaluation, samples showed a combination of the cohesive fracture at the veneer layer and mixed (cohesive, adhesive) fracture {{at the edge of the}} two layers; No adhesive fracture between the zirconia <b>cores</b> and <b>veneers</b> was observed.

The systems tested were: Vita In-Ceream®, Vita Hi-Ceram®, Dicor™ veneered with Vitadur® N, magnesia <b>core</b> <b>veneered</b> with Ceramco® II, magnesia <b>core</b> <b>veneered</b> with Silhouette™, and magnesia <b>core</b> <b>veneered</b> with Vita VMK® 68. A maxillary central incisor was prepared with 1. 0 mm axial and 1. 5 mm incisal reduction. Refractory dies were prepared and crowns were fabricated using the manufactures recommendations. Six specimens of each system were placed inside a beaker in a furnace at 90 °C. After 15 min heat soak, ice water was poured into the beaker through a funnel. The samples were dried in air, reheated, and inspected for crazing using light microscopy. If crazing was observed, this would constitute a failure at a temperature difference (ΔT) of 90 °C. If no failure occurred, the test was repeated at increasing temperature increments of 10 °C until failure. The crazing resistance of each system, expressed as the mean ΔT, was: > 200 (Hi-Ceram®), 152 ± 19 (Dicor™ / Vitadur® N), 143 ± 5 (magnesia core/Vita VMK® 68), 122 ± 21 (magnesia core/Silhouette™), and 118 ± 10 (magnesia core/Ceramco® II) °C. All systems tested resisted crazing due to quenching in ice cold water from 100 °C.

40|$|Abstract- In {{this study}} the {{suitability}} of using <b>core</b> <b>veneer</b> made from renewable natural fiber i. e. Non-oven jute felt, which {{is the second most}} widely used natural fiber for manufacturing of plywood was investigated to minimize the gap between demand and supply of wood veneer. The renewable natural hard jute fibre was impregnated with phenolic resin and was used for the manufacture of plywood. Plywood of 4 mm, 6 mm, 12 mm and 18 mm thick were manufactured by using phenolic resin impregnated jute felt having thickness 16 mm of 1850 GSM (approx.) as a core in place of the natural wood veneer. From the study, it can be inferred that PF Resin impregnated Non oven jute felt as a natural fibre can suitably replace the wooden glue <b>core</b> <b>veneer</b> to manufacture ply board up to 80 % as an alternative substitute of wood. The physico-mechanical properties such as surface roughness, moisture content, density, water absorption, swelling, compressive strength, tensile strength, static bending strength, glue shear strength, of the plywood manufactured by using jute felt as <b>core</b> <b>veneer</b> with different resin dilution have been studied. Data revels that most of the physico-mechanical properties of the plywood showed satisfactory results meeting the requirement of different grades of plywood tested as per IS: 1734 - 1983. The accelerated study of the glued core after impregnation with jute felt have been carried out for three months before plywood manufacture after storing it in proper temperature and humidity. The data revealed that there is no appreciable change in bond quality and mechanical properties of the plyboard manufactured after storing the veneer up to 30 days. The study concluded that wood substituted jute composites could be an ideal solution with ever depleting forest reserves where utilization of renewable resources will be beneficiary for plywood industries to meet the challenges during scarcity of veneer by reducing the cost of imported veneer...|$|R

Scanning electron microscope (SEM) examinations of Dicor/Dicor Plus ceramic specimens suggested better wetting of Dicor core by Dicor Plus ceramic with lower incidence of porosity at the interface. However, Dicor/Vitadur N ceramic specimens exhibited a higher incidence of porosity at the interface.

40|$|Ceramic {{properties}} such as biocompatibility and inertness have secured {{their use}} in biomedical prosthetics. The brittle nature of ceramics governs their application in any design and fabrication technique. Current all-ceramic dental crowns have a reported failure rate of approximately 3 % a year. An investigation into a possible improved design over current all-ceramic dental crowns is performed. Current methods of fabricating all-ceramic dental crowns involve laborious and time consuming application of porcelain veneer layers onto a core material. The proposed design is to join independently fabricated <b>veneer</b> and <b>core</b> layers together using a high elastic modulus composite. Fracture behavior of brittle layers joined by a high elastic modulus composite is studied in this dissertation. There are two dominant fracture mechanisms of concern for dental crowns when joining brittle layers with a more compliant interlayer; the formation of radial cracks in the <b>veneer</b> or <b>core</b> and the propagation of cracks between brittle layers. The occlusal loading on dental crowns can be simulated {{with the use of}} Hertzian contact testing on flat brittle laminates, which allow for the study of radial cracks in the veneer. It is shown {{for the first time that}} bottom-surface radial cracks in the veneer due to flexure can be suppressed using a high elastic modulus joining interlayer. The relationship between the critical loads for radial crack formation, Pcr and the interlayer modulus and thickness is elucidated. Furthermore, using the high modulus composite as an interlayer increases the long term cyclic loading lifetime over joins with similar moduli to currently available dental adhesives. The propagation of cracks between adjacent brittle layers is shown to be controlled by a reinitiation mechanism and not penetration through the adhesive. Cracks that traverse the layer of origin arrest at the join interface in brittle laminates. Reinitiation loads are dictated by strength of the adjacent brittle layer and modulus of adhesive. This study shows that it is possible to use a high modulus composite as a joining material in the fabrication of dental crowns, while suppressing the formation of radial cracks in the veneer and limiting the propagation of cracks between adjacent brittle layers...|$|R

40|$|Layered {{structures}} {{can be used}} {{to address}} the competing needs of systems like dental crown restorations where the exterior needs to be aesthetic and the interior needs to be strong and fatigue resistant. Dental crowns typically have an aesthetic porcelain veneer layered on a strong, fatigue resistant ceramic or metallic core. In current restorations, even when the core is shaped by a computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM) or solid-freeform fabrication processes, the veneer is applied in sequential layers. This process is labor intensive, time consuming and may not optimize the long-term performance properties of the veneer layer. If the <b>core</b> and <b>veneer</b> layers were to be independently fabricated and then joined, their individual and the veneer-core system performance could be optimized.

During the past years different {{systems in the}} field of allceramic crowns have been introduced in the market. A decisive criterion for the dentist when deciding on the system is the clinical fit of the crowns on the patients. In this study 99 Procera AllCeram crowns of 44 patients were clinically examined. 27 women and 17 men were provided with Procera AllCeram crowns during prothetic treatment at the dental clinic of the Freie Universität Berlin. The time period the crowns have been in situ averaged around 52 month or 4. 2 years. Of the Procera AllCeram crowns examined 54 crowns were located in the anterior and 45 crowns in the posterior region of the dental arch. The California Dental association quality evaluation system was used for assessment of the crowns in terms of margin integrity, colour and surface and anatomic term. 97 percent of all crowns showed a satisfactory and 83. 2 % thereof an excellent performance. The survival rate of the crowns after a lifetime of three years was 97. 9 % and 76. 6 % after five years. For determining the survival rate all diagnosed defects were assessed. They were defects either within the veneer material or complete fractures in both the <b>veneer</b> and the <b>core</b> material. The fracture rate in total was 3 %. These crowns showed defects in <b>veneer</b> and <b>core</b> material and had to be replaced. Concerning the correlation between defects and existing parafunctions a significant result (P< 0. 05) was determined. Out of 11 defects seven occurred on patients with parafunctions. A high significant variation was detected during the localisation of the defective crowns (P< 0. 01). 81 % of all damaged crowns were located in the posterior region. A significant variation concerning the type structure of the abutment tooth was also detected (P< 0. 05). A questioning of patients using a questionnaire showed an overall satisfaction with the prothetic treatment. 95 % of the patients would again decide themselves for this type of crown and 97 % stated that the resulting costs for the treatment were within reason.

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} framework design on the fatigue life and failure modes of metal ceramic (MC, Ni-Cr alloy core, VMK 95 porcelain veneer), glass-infiltrated alumina (ICA, In-Ceram Alumina/VM 7), and veneered yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystals (Y-TZP, IPSe. max ZirCAD/IPS e. max,) crowns. Methods: Sixty composite resin tooth replicas of a prepared maxillary first molar were produced to receive crowns systems of a standard (MCs, ICAs, and Y-TZPs, n = 10 each) or a modified framework design (MCm, ICAm, and Y-TZPm, n = 10 each). Fatigue loading was delivered with a spherical steel indenter (3. 18 mm radius) {{on the center of}} the occlusal surface using r-ratio fatigue (30 - 300 N) until completion of 10 (6) cycles or failure. Fatigue was interrupted every 125, 000 cycles for damage evaluation. Weibull distribution fits and contour plots were used for examining differences between groups. Failure mode was evaluated by light polarized and SEM microscopy. Results: Weibull analysis showed the highest fatigue life for MC crowns regardless of framework design. No significant difference (confidence bound overlaps) was observed between ICA and Y-TZP with or without framework design modification. Y-TZPm crowns presented fatigue life in the range of MC crowns. No porcelain veneer fracture was observed in the MC groups, whereas ICAs presented bulk fracture and ICAm failed mainly through the veneer. Y-TZP crowns failed through chipping within the <b>veneer,</b> without <b>core</b> fractures. Conclusions: Framework design modification did not improve the fatigue life of the crown systems investigated. Y-TZPm crowns showed comparable fatigue life to MC groups.

Fixture developments in the furniture industry allow lightweight panels to be used without stiles, rails and internal blocking, making them more cost competitive with particleboard and medium density fiberboard panels. This poster presents an alternative concept for the production of lightweight sandwich panels using preformed hardwood <b>veneer</b> residues/polyurethane foam <b>core</b> and different wood veneers as face layers. Mechanical properties of the panels including compression and bending strength were tested in two directions, parallel and perpendicular to the strand alignment. A two-level factorial design was employed in order to establish the effect of resin spread, pressure and resin setting temperature on the compression strength. The veneer clippings used as reinforcements in the core gave the panel more rigidity and increased compression strength. The obtained results demonstrate the viability of the newly developed panels for both structural and non-structural applications...|$|R
40|$|Water is {{distributed}} differently on Earth and on Mars {{and the differences}} may have implications for the accretion of the two planets {{and the formation of}} their atmospheres. The Earth's mantle appears to contain at least several times the water content of the Martian mantle even accounting for differences in plate tectonics. One explanation is that the Earth's surface melted during accretion, as a result of development of a steam atmosphere, thereby allowing impact-devolitalized water at the surface to dissolve into the Earth's interior. In contrast, because of Mars' smaller size and greater distance from the Sun, the Martian surface may not have melted, so that the devolatilized water could not dissolve into the surface. A second possibility is suggested by the siderophile elements in the Earth's mantle, which indicates the Earth acquired a volatile-rich <b>veneer</b> after the <b>core</b> formed. Mars may have acquired a late volatile-rich veneer, but it did not get folded into the interior as with the Earth, but instead remained as a water rich veneer. This perception of Mars with a wet surface but dry interior is consistent with our knowledge of Mars' geologic history...|$|R
40|$|The {{color of}} an object is {{perceived}} differently depending on the ambient light conditions. Since dental all-ceramic restorations are fabricated by building up several layers to reproduce the tooth shade, the optical properties of each layer should be optimized for successful shade reproduction. This study aimed to determine the separate contributions of the color shifts {{in each of the}} <b>core</b> and <b>veneer</b> layers of all-ceramics by switching the illuminating lights on the color shifts of layered ceramics. Specimens of seven kinds of core ceramics and the corresponding veneer ceramics for each core were fabricated with a layered thickness of 1. 5 mm. A sintering ceramic was used as a reference core material. The Commission Internationale de l&# 39;Eclairage (CIE) color coordinates of <b>core,</b> <b>veneer,</b> and layered specimens were measured with a spectroradiometer under the CIE illuminant D 65 (daylight), A (incandescent lamp), and F 9 (fluorescent lamp) simulating lights. Color shifts of the layered specimens were primarily determined by the CIE a* shifts (D 65 to A switch) or by the CIE b* shifts (D 65 to F 9 switch) of the veneer layer. The color coordinates shifts in the constituent layers differentially influenced those of the layered specimens by the kind of switched lights. Therefore, the optical properties of the constituent layers of all-ceramics should be controlled to reflect these findings.

40|$|Effective and {{reliable}} clinical uses of dental ceramics necessitate an insightful {{analysis of the}} fracture behaviour under critical conditions. To better understand failure characteristics of porcelain <b>veneered</b> to zirconia <b>core</b> ceramic structures, thermally induced cracking during the cooling phase of fabrication is studied here by using the extended finite element method (XFEM). In this study, a transient thermal analysis of cooling is conducted first to determine the temperature distributions. The time-dependent temperature field is then imported to the XFEM model for viscoelastic thermomechanical analysis, which predicts thermally induced damage and cracking at different time steps. Temperature-dependent material properties are used in both transient thermal and thermomechanical analyses. Three typical ceramic structures are considered in this paper, namely bi-layered spheres, squat cylinders and dental crowns with thickness ratios of either 1 : 2 or 1 : 1. The XFEM fracture patterns exhibit good agreement with clinical observation and the in vitro experimental results obtained from scanning electron microscopy characterization. The study reveals that fast cooling can lead to thermal fracture of these different bi-layered ceramic structures, and cooling rate (in terms of heat transfer coefficient) plays {{a critical role in}} crack initiation and propagation. By exploring different cooling rates, the heat transfer coefficient thresholds of fracture are determined for different structures, which are of clear clinical implicatio...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Evaluate {{the effect}} of {{different}} veneering techniques, Y-TZP core thicknesses, and firing cycles with different heat rates and holding times on the mechanical properties of veneering porcelain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Biaxial flexural strength and Thermal shock resistance tests were conducted to evaluate the mechanical properties of <b>veneer</b> porcelain. <b>Core</b> material, Y-TZP and two porcelain veneers, IPS e. max Ceram and VITA VM 9, were used in this study. Vita YZ zirconia blocks were sectioned and sintered to provide slabs of 1. 65, 3. 25, and 6. 50 mm in thickness. Two techniques were used to fabricate VITA VM 9 and e. max Ceram porcelain veneer porcelain discs, Hand Layered, mixing powder with manufacturer’s molding liquid, condensed in a mold, and Pressed, pressing powder uniaxially in a mold. A layer of carbon paint {{was applied to the}} zirconia to allow removal of the porcelain discs. For thermal shock test the veneering porcelain fired on the Y-TZP core with a wash layer. After the veneer discs were fabricated, they were sintered: (1) According to the manufacturer’s instructions; (2) Two different cycles with slower heat rate and longer holding than the recommended value. Biaxial flexural strength was determined using a universal mechanical tester. Thermal shock tests were performed using a Pober thermal shock device. Statistical analysis was conducted for all tests using ANOVA and Tukey post hoc test at p= 0. 05. RESULTS: There was significant effect from changes of YZ Core thickness, firing cycle, and veneer technique on the mechanical properties of porcelain veneer. The veneering technique had the largest impact on the mechanical properties of veneer porcelain followed by firing cycle, followed by YZ core thickness. In using different firing cycles with different heat rates and holding times, slowing the heating rate had more influence on the mechanical properties of veneer porcelain. In measuring the surface temperature of the Y-TZP/VITA VM 9 assembly, the specimen surface temperature was coincidental with the furnace programmed firing cycle using a slower heating rate firing cycle. CONCLUSIONS Veneering technique, slower heat rate firing cycle, and Y-TZP core thickness have significant impact on veneering porcelain mechanical properties. 2018 - 09 - 28 T 00 : 00 : 00...|$|R
40|$|Fast growing sengon (Paraserianthes moluccana) {{is largely}} rotary-cut to produce <b>veneer</b> for <b>core</b> plywood production. In {{order to provide}} better {{information}} on veneer production and utilization, in this {{study the effects of}} wood juvenility and veneer thickness on lathe checks of rotary-cut sengon veneers were evaluated. Before veneer manufacturing, sengon logs were boiled at 50 oC and 75 oC for 4 and 8 hours respectively. The boiled logs were peeled to produce veneer of 1 mm, 1. 5 mm, 2 mm in thickness. Lathe checks of veneers were measured on the loosed side at every 5 mm veneer length under an optical video microscope and their frequency, depth, and length were characterized. Twenty sampling points of 5 mm veneer length were prepared from each segmented ring of 1 cm width from pith to bark. Isocyanate resin adhesive were used to produce laminated veneer lumber (LVL) of 20 mm thick, which consisted of 24 -ply of 1 mm veneer thick, 14 -ply of 1. 5 mm veneer thick, and 11 -ply of 2 mm veneer thick, for glue bond and bending strength test. Results showed that wood juvenility and veneer thickness determined the frequency, depth and length of lathe checks for the sengon rotary-cut veneers. In general, the frequency of lathe checks of the veneer increases with increasing veneer thickness, and also increases from pith to bark. Boiling of logs before rotary-cutting could decreases the frequency of lathe check of the veneer. The results indicated that boiling of logs at 50 oC for 8 h and at 75 oC at least 4 h before peeling the logs could minimize the frequency of lathe check in manufacturing rotary cut veneer thickness of 1 mm, 1. 5 mm, and 2 mm from juvenile wood of fast growing sengon. The frequency of lathe check affect significantly the glue bond and bending strength, in which the glue bond, Modulus of Elasticity (MOE), and Modulus of Rupture (MOR) decrease as the frequency of lathe checks increases.

40|$|Abstract Objective. The aim of {{the study}} was to provide data on the {{fracture}} strength of monolithic high translucent Y-TZP crowns and porcelain-veneered high translucent Y-TZP crown cores and to compare that data with the fracture strength of porcelain-veneered Y-TZP crown cores and monolithic lithium disilicate glass-ceramic crowns. Materials and methods. Sixty standardized crowns divided into six groups (n = 10) were fabricated: monolithic high translucent Y-TZP crowns, brand A, monolithic high translucent Y-TZP crowns, brand B, veneered high translucent Y-TZP crown <b>cores,</b> brand A, <b>veneered</b> high translucent Y-TZP crown cores, brand B, heat-pressed monolithic lithium disilicate crowns and <b>veneered</b> Y-TZP crown <b>cores.</b> All crowns were thermocycled, cemented onto dies, cyclically pre-loaded and finally loaded to fracture. Results. The monolithic Y-TZP groups showed significantly higher fracture strength (2795 N and 3038 N) compared to all other groups. The fracture strength in the veneered Y-TZP group (2229 N) was significantly higher than the monolithic lithium disilicate group (1856 N) and the veneered high translucent Y-TZP groups (1480 N and 1808 N). Conclusions. The fracture strength of monolithic high translucent Y-TZP crowns is considerably higher than that of porcelain-veneered Y-TZP crown cores, porcelain-veneered high translucent Y-TZP crown cores and monolithic lithium disilicate crowns. The fracture strength of a crown made of monolithic high translucent Y-TZP is, with a large safety margin, sufficient for clinical use for the majority of patients. Porcelain-veneered Y-TZP crown cores show higher fracture resistance than monolithic lithium disilicate crowns...|$|R
