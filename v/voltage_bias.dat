25|$|The {{negative}} feedback into the difference amplifier allows the amplifier {{to compare the}} input to the actual output. The amplified signal from Q1 is directly fed to the second stage, Q3, which is a common emitter stage that provides further amplification of the signal and the DC bias for the output stages, Q4 and Q5. R6 provides the load for Q3 (a better design would probably use some form of active load here, such as a constant-current sink). So far, all of the amplifier is operating in class A. The output pair are arranged in class-AB push–pull, also called a complementary pair. They provide {{the majority of the}} current amplification (while consuming low quiescent current) and directly drive the load, connected via DC-blocking capacitor C2. The diodes D1 and D2 provide a small amount of constant <b>voltage</b> <b>bias</b> for the output pair, just biasing them into the conducting state so that crossover distortion is minimized. That is, the diodes push the output stage firmly into class-AB mode (assuming that the base-emitter drop of the output transistors is reduced by heat dissipation).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Three point {{bending fatigue}} tests {{were carried out}} to {{investigate}} the influence of <b>bias</b> <b>voltage</b> on fatigue behavior of medium carbon steel with chromium nitride film. The substrate material of the specimens was JIS S 45 C medium carbon steel. The chromium nitride films were coated at two different <b>bias</b> <b>voltages</b> (VB =- 20 V,- 300 V) for fatigue test by arc ion plating method. As a result, the fatigue limit was improved by coating at low <b>bias</b> <b>voltage,</b> while the fatigue limit of high <b>bias</b> <b>voltage</b> samples decreased by coating. In order to clarify the difference {{between high and low}} <b>bias</b> <b>voltages,</b> the tensile test was performed using the coated specimens. For this test, the chromium nitride films were deposited at four different <b>bias</b> <b>voltages.</b> It was found the cracking behavior clearly changed between- 40 V and- 80 V.

40|$|The channel {{temperature}} (Tch) of solution-processed 6, 13 -bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl) -pentacene (TIPS pentacene) {{thin film}} transistors (TFTs) is closely monitored {{in real time}} during current–voltage (I–V) measurements carried out in a He exchange gas cryostat at various base temperatures (Tb) between 300 K and 20 K. This is done using a platinum (Pt) resistance temperature sensor embedded within the transistor channel. Under large gate (Vg) and source-drain (Vds) <b>voltage</b> <b>biases,</b> an increase in Tch is observed, the magnitude of which depends on the thermal conductivity of the substrate. The increase in Tch {{is associated with a}} simultaneous increase in the transistor drain current (Id) and becomes particularly pronounced at cryogenic Tb. These experimental observations are rationalized using a 1 D theoretical model and are attributed to current-induced Joule heating. However, even though the heating of the channel unquestionably plays an important role, the corresponding amount of increase in Id at cryogenic Tb and large <b>voltage</b> <b>biases</b> cannot be fully accounted for unless at low temperatures μTIPS is enhanced in the presence of strong electrical fields. Therefore it is concluded that the I–V characteristics of TIPS pentacene TFTs at low Tb and large <b>voltage</b> <b>biases</b> are a result of a complex interplay between current-induced Joule heating and electrical field effects...|$|R
