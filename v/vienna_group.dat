25|$|In 2003, the <b>Vienna</b> <b>group</b> also {{demonstrated}} the wave nature of tetraphenylporphyrin—a flat biodye with {{an extension of}} about 2nm and a mass of 614u. For this demonstration they employed a near-field Talbot Lau interferometer. In the same interferometer they also found interference fringes for C60F48., a fluorinated buckyball with a mass of about 1600 u, composed of 108 atoms. Large molecules are already so complex that they give experimental access to {{some aspects of the}} quantum-classical interface, i.e., to certain decoherence mechanisms. In 2011, the interference of molecules as heavy as 6910u could be demonstrated in a Kapitza–Dirac–Talbot–Lau interferometer. In 2013, the interference of molecules beyond 10,000u has been demonstrated.|$|E

In 2008 logistical issues had meant that the parallel conference system was in abeyance, with a regionalised structure (a <b>Vienna</b> <b>group</b> and a non-Vienna group) with a knock-out stage for the top 6 Viennese teams joined by the top 2 from the non-Vienna group.
