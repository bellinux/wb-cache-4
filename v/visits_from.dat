5|$|The {{number of}} people who visited Malta in 2009 dropped {{considerably}} compared to the figures for 2008 - overall, the country's tourism industry suffered an 8 percent drop from 2008. <b>Visits</b> <b>from</b> non-European Union countries dropped more considerably than <b>visits</b> <b>from</b> European Union countries (and even more so than <b>visits</b> <b>from</b> Eurozone countries), while the average stay length remained the same for both 2008 and 2009. Visitors from most countries require a visa to visit Malta. The nationalities requiring a visa are standardised as per European Union rules. Visitors already holding a valid Schengen Area visa most likely will not need to complete any more formalities to enter Malta (so long as they are already inside the Schengen Area). Visitors holding citizenship of the European Union do not require a visa to enter Malta as they hold the right to free movement within the European Union. In recent years, the country's tourism industry has been faced with a number of issues relating to the nation's small size, both in terms of area and population. These issues include stretched resources and infrastructure (such as water, waste management, beaches and roads), especially during the summer months of July and August.|$|E

5|$|Fraternisation—peaceful and {{sometimes}} friendly interactions between opposing forces—was a regular feature in quiet front-line {{sectors of the}} Western Front. In some areas, it manifested as a passive inactivity, where both sides would refrain from overtly aggressive or threatening behavior, while in other cases it extended to regular conversation or even <b>visits</b> <b>from</b> one trench to another.|$|E
5|$|The 1980s saw <b>visits</b> <b>from</b> Pope John Paul II and Queen Elizabeth II, and the {{beginning}} of the annual Canterbury Festival. Canterbury received its own radio station in CTFM, now KMFM Canterbury, in 1997. Between 1999 and 2005, the Whitefriars Shopping Centre underwent major redevelopment. In 2000, during the redevelopment, a major archaeological project was undertaken by the Canterbury Archaeological Trust, known as the Big Dig, which was supported by Channel Four's Time Team.|$|E
5|$|The paralyzed Hamilton, {{who knew}} {{himself to be}} mortally wounded, was ferried to the Greenwich Village home of his friend William Bayard Jr., who had been waiting on the dock. After final <b>visits</b> <b>from</b> {{his family and friends}} and {{considerable}} suffering, Hamilton died at two o'clock the following afternoon, July 12, 1804, at Bayard's home at what is now 80–82 Jane Street.

5|$|While heavily recruited, Campbell {{narrowed his}} choices to Houston, Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, and Baylor. After in-home <b>visits</b> <b>from</b> Barry Switzer from Oklahoma and Darrell Royal from Texas, Campbell {{ultimately}} chose Texas. Switzer, who unsuccessfully recruited Campbell, {{said in his}} 1989 book that Campbell was the only player he ever saw who could have gone straight {{from high school to}} the NFL and immediately become a star.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} of rest and recovery, Zita found herself {{regularly}} going back to Europe for the weddings of her children. She decided {{to move back to}} the continent full-time, in 1952, to Luxembourg, in order to look after her aging mother. Maria Antonia {{died at the age of}} 96 in 1959. The bishop of Chur proposed to Zita that she move into a residence that he administered (formerly a castle of the Counts de Salis) at Zizers, Graubünden in Switzerland. As the castle had enough space for <b>visits</b> <b>from</b> her large family and a nearby chapel (a necessity for the devoutly Catholic Zita), she accepted with ease.|$|E

5|$|Andjar {{was born}} Abisin Abbas in Alahan Panjang, West Sumatra, on 26February 1902. He gravitated toward {{traditional}} theatre {{at a young}} age after <b>visits</b> <b>from</b> the wandering Wayang Kassim and Juliana Opera stambul troupes; he pretended to act with his friends in stage plays which they had seen. After completing his formal education up to the Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs (junior high school) level– first in Malay-language schools then Dutch ones– he moved to Batavia (modern-day Jakarta). He worked as a reporter for two daily newspapers, Bintang Timoer and Bintang Hindia; he may have also worked on a farm.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} Beatles' {{trip to the}} United States, merchandisers pitched many {{products}} to Epstein, including Beatles clocks, pens, cigarette lighters, plastic wigs, bracelets, games, etc., but he rejected them all. This was because he had already allowed David Jacobs, the lawyer for NEMS, to give away 90 per cent of merchandising rights to one Nicky Byrne, in the UK. This was later deemed to be a disastrous mistake, as it left only 10 per cent for Epstein, NEMS and the Beatles. Byrne then took over Epstein's Stramsact merchandising in the UK and set up Seltaeb (Beatles spelled backwards), in the United States. While the Beatles were ensconced in the Plaza Hotel in New York, Epstein was further besieged by calls and <b>visits</b> <b>from</b> promoters, retailers, television commentators and hustlers.|$|E
5|$|From September 1895 to June 1896 Bruce {{worked at}} the Ben Nevis summit {{meteorological}} station, where he gained further experience in scientific procedures and with meteorological instruments. In June 1896, again {{on the recommendation of}} Mill, he left this post to join the Jackson–Harmsworth Expedition, then in its third year in the Arctic on Franz Josef Land. This expedition, led by Frederick George Jackson and financed by newspaper magnate Alfred Harmsworth, had left London in 1894. It was engaged in a detailed survey of the Franz Josef archipelago, which had been discovered, though not properly mapped, during an Austrian expedition 20years earlier. Jackson's party was based at Cape Flora on Northbrook Island, the southernmost island of the archipelago. It was supplied through regular <b>visits</b> <b>from</b> its expedition ship Windward, on which Bruce sailed from London on 9 June 1896.|$|E

5|$|In Belgium, Merrick {{was robbed}} by his road manager and {{abandoned}} in Brussels. He eventually {{made his way}} back to London; unable to communicate, he was found by the police to have Dr. Treves's card on him. Treves came and took Merrick back to the London Hospital. Although his condition was incurable, Merrick was allowed to stay at the hospital for the remainder of his life. Treves visited him daily, and the pair developed quite a close friendship. Merrick also got <b>visits</b> <b>from</b> the wealthy ladies and gentlemen of London society, including Alexandra, Princess of Wales.|$|E
5|$|In the Halo universe, {{humans had}} {{advanced}} to a comparable level {{of technology to}} the Forerunners but, after losing a war with them, all human technology was destroyed and their intelligence reduced, leaving them in a subsistence economy with measures to prevent redevelopment of electronics. Humans {{are aware of the}} other, space-faring races, but their interactions are limited to <b>visits</b> <b>from</b> Forerunners as {{they do not have the}} technology to make contact themselves, they live in wooden buildings and have only primitive steam engines. The San'Shyuum (or Prophets as they are referred to in the Halo games) were also defeated by the Forerunners but their technology was not destroyed; they were instead confined to their home solar system and forbidden to manufacture weapons.|$|E
5|$|Luang Pu Sodh {{had a great}} {{interest}} to introduce Dhammakaya meditation outside of Thailand. Wat Paknam already published international magazines and leaflets in the time Kapilavaddho, his first Western student, started living {{under the guidance of}} Luang Pu Sodh. The periodical of the temple was in both Thai and English, and at certain occasions booklets would be published in Chinese as well. In old periodicals of the temple <b>visits</b> <b>from</b> high-standing monks from Japan and China have been recorded, and Dhammakaya meditation is still passed on by Japanese Shingon Buddhists that used to practice at Wat Paknam.|$|E

5|$|News of Mulder's arrest spreads to the FBI. Upon {{hearing that}} he has resurfaced, and in such a dire manner, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) visit him in {{military}} custody. During his time in captivity, Mulder receives mysterious <b>visits</b> <b>from</b> two phantoms of his past: Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) and X (Steven Williams). Meanwhile, Scully and Skinner {{go to great lengths}} to get him released, but are unsuccessful. Mulder's fate is ultimately made the subject of a military tribunal with Deputy Director Alvin Kersh (James Pickens, Jr.) in charge. At the outset, it appears Mulder will become the hopeless victim of a show trial stacked against him.|$|E
5|$|The {{best of the}} few Welsh {{artists of}} the 16th–18th centuries tended {{to leave the country}} to work, many of them moving to London or Italy. Richard Wilson (1714–82) is arguably the first major British landscapist. Although more notable for his Italian scenes, he painted several Welsh scenes on <b>visits</b> <b>from</b> London. By the late 18th century, the {{popularity}} of landscape art grew and clients were found in the larger Welsh towns, allowing more Welsh artists to stay in their homeland. Artists from outside Wales were also drawn to paint Welsh scenery, at first because of the Celtic Revival. Then in the early 19th century, the Napoleonic Wars preventing the Grand Tour to continental Europe, travel through Wales came to be considered more accessible.|$|E
5|$|The ground has {{attracted}} criticism from local residents. A parish council meeting in October 2001 revealed that Arsenal players {{had not been}} involved with local initiatives, despite claims during its planning phase that the ground would allow the club to develop links with the local community. Shenley Primary School reportedly failed to receive any <b>visits</b> <b>from</b> players despite repeated requests. The club responded by pointing to initiatives by its Ladies team to organise competitions at local grounds. Plans to develop new buildings and road links to the site were challenged by residents four years later; they believed {{it would lead to}} increased traffic and noise pollution in the area.|$|E
