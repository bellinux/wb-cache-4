50|$|Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) {{membrane}} roofing is {{also known}} as vinyl roofing. Vinyl is derived from two simple ingredients: fossil fuel and salt. Petroleum or natural gas is processed to make ethylene, and salt is subjected to electrolysis to separate out the natural element chlorine. Ethylene and chlorine are combined to produce ethylene dichloride (EDC), which is further processed into a gas called vinyl chloride monomer (VCM). In the next step, known as polymerization, the VCM molecule forms chains, converting the gas into a fine, white powder - <b>vinyl</b> <b>resin</b> - which becomes the basis for the final process, compounding. In compounding, <b>vinyl</b> <b>resin</b> may be blended with additives such as stabilizers for durability, plasticizers for flexibility and pigments for color.|$|E

5000|$|When RCA Victor {{launched}} the 7-inch 45 RPM record, they initially had eight musical classifications (pop, country, blues, classical, childrens, etc.) each {{with not only}} its own uniquely colored label but with a corresponding color vinyl. According to experts at the Sarnoff Center in Princeton, New Jersey, the cost of maintaining eight vinyl colors became too high, but the different colored labels were continued, at least for popular music (black) and classical (red, as in [...] "Red Seal"). In October 1945, RCA Victor put on the market its first [...] "non-breakable" [...] phonograph records. Made of a ruby-red, translucent <b>vinyl</b> <b>resin</b> plastic, they cost twice as much ($2 per disc) as the 12-inch Victor Red Seal.

50|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} combining new plasticizers with the white, flour-like <b>vinyl</b> <b>resin.</b> Finally, in January 1946, inventors Snell, Oace, and Eastwold of 3M {{applied for a}} patent for a vinyl electrical tape with a plasticizer system and non-sulfur-based rubber adhesive that were compatible. The first commercially available version of the tape was sold {{for use as a}} wire-harness wrapping. Interestingly, this original black tape wasn't black at all. Tapes formulated for high-temperature were yellow, and later versions were white. White tape, because of its instability in ultraviolet light, was eventually replaced with black tape, although colored vinyl tapes are still used as identification and marking tapes. Black became the standard industry color for vinyl standard tape, primarily because of its ultraviolet resistance. Thicknesses originally were 4 mil (100 µm), 8 mil (200 µm) and 12 mil (300 µm).

40|$|Free radical cured {{thermosetting}} <b>vinyl</b> ester <b>resins</b> have superior toughness {{and chemical}} resistance {{in comparison to}} unsaturated polyester. The use of vinyl ester composites reinforced with carbon fibers requires an improvement in the fiber-matrix adhesion levels. Previous data {{has shown that the}} application of a lightly cross-linked amine-cured epoxy sizing to the carbon fiber surface creates a beneficial interphase between the carbon fiber and <b>vinyl</b> ester <b>resin</b> matrix resulting in a substantial increase in fiber-matrix adhesion and the sizing has a optimum thickness [1, 2, 8]. However, the exact mechanism by which this coating improved adhesion is not known. <b>Vinyl</b> ester <b>resin</b> can undergo as much as 10 % volume shrinkage with cure while typical epoxy systems undergo only 3 - 4 % shrinkage during cure [4 - 6].

Three kinds of silane coupling agents are used by three different ways in order to improve the interface furtherly. All the specimens are manufactured by VARIM process. DCB method is used to measure the interlaminar energy release ratio(ERR) between the face sheet and paulownia wood core. By comparing the ERRs, the way that core surface pretreated by agent-added resins gets the most effective improvement.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} fiber diameter, trigger {{geometry}} and section geometry on the crush response of pultruded glass {{fiber reinforced plastic}} tubes, made with either {{polyester or vinyl ester}} resin, was determined at crush rates from 2. 1 x 10 - 4 m/s to &mdash; 15 m/s. The rate dependence of the specific energy for the polyester resin tubes was positive, whereas that for the <b>vinyl</b> <b>resin</b> tubes could be either positive or negative, depending upon the par-ticular tube geometry. Increases in the specific energy absorption, previously observed in quasi-static loading, caused by changes in the crush trigger geometry, were found also for dynamic loading. Reductions in the fiber diameter by one half (nominal), for the same glass content, decreased the specific energy by up to &sim; 20 %. Differences in the resin affect the quasi-static crush resistance, the vinyl ester resin tubes having a significantly higher specific energy than that of the polyester resin tubes. These differences tend to diminish for dynamic crush. Fiber delamination occurs more profusely under dynamic loading con-ditions, and it is suggested that a crush mode change occurs on passing from quasi-static to dynamic loading. A tendency to crush in an unstable manner was found for some square sections under dynamic loading, possibly due to the accumulation of crush debris in the tube interior...|$|E

40|$|Commercial {{antimycotic}} nail lacquers {{are commonly}} based on water-insoluble resins. The {{present study was}} aimed at evaluating a novel. experimental nail lacquer (P- 3051, Polichem SA, Lugano, Switzerland) based on the water-soluble film-forming agent hydroxypropyl chitosan (HPCH). The in vitro permeation of ciclopirox (CPX) from P- 3051 and from a commercial, water-insoluble lacquer based on a <b>vinyl</b> <b>resin</b> (Penlac(TM) Aven is Pharma), was investigated using thin membranes obtained from bovine hooves, an accepted model for human nails. Similar CPX permeation fluxes at steady state through the membranes, but significantly different lag times were observed for P- 3051 and Penlac(TM), when these were tested as dry films. The formulations thus appeared to influence only the time required by CPX to saturate the membrane, and not the final drug concentration gradient in the membrane. Permeation experiments performed on the same membranes and on hairless mouse skin with P- 3051 and with a similar, HPCH-free vehicle (ERV), both tested in liquid form, disproved the possibility that HPCH might act as a permeation enhancer for CPX in either substrate. The possible reasons for the greater efficiency of the HPCH vehicle in terms of CPX transfer from the vehicle itself to the keratin membrane are discussed. This effect might be tentatively attributed to a particular affinity of HPCH for the membrane, resulting in intimate contact and strong adhesion of the HPCH lacquer to the keratin substrate...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background From May 1968 through March 1980, vinyl-lined {{asbestos-cement}} (VL/AC) {{water distribution}} pipes were installed in New England to avoid taste and odor {{problems associated with}} asbestos-cement pipes. The <b>vinyl</b> <b>resin</b> {{was applied to the}} inner pipe surface in a solution of tetrachloroethylene (perchloroethylene, PCE). Substantial amounts of PCE remained in the liner and subsequently leached into public drinking water supplies. Methods Once aware of the leaching problem and prior to remediation (April-November 1980), Massachusetts regulators collected drinking water samples from VL/AC pipes to determine the extent and severity of the PCE contamination. This study compares newly obtained historical records of PCE concentrations in water samples (n = 88) with concentrations estimated using an exposure model employed in epidemiologic studies on the cancer risk associated with PCE-contaminated drinking water. The exposure model was developed by Webler and Brown to estimate the mass of PCE delivered to subjects' residences. Results The mean and median measured PCE concentrations in the water samples were 66 and 0. 5 μg/L, respectively, and the range extended from non-detectable to 2432 μg/L. The model-generated concentration estimates and water sample concentrations were moderately correlated (Spearman rank correlation coefficient = 0. 48, p Conclusion PCE concentration estimates generated using the Webler-Brown model were moderately correlated with measured water concentrations. The present analysis suggests that the exposure assessment process used in prior epidemiological studies could be improved with more accurate characterization of water flow. This study illustrates one method of validating an exposure model in an epidemiological study when historical measurements are not available. </p...|$|E

The extended salt spray test, delamination test, and deformation tests of the coatings all found that the type of coating and the thickness of the coating to have a significant effect on the measured outputs. The significant effect shown in the deformation test could not determine the proper material without the aid of microscopic studies of the surface geometry change due to the induced deformation. Powder coating the rapid battery exchange systems would result in proper performance if coupled with epoxy paint for repairs.
