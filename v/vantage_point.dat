5|$|Using a fence, branch or {{telegraph}} pole as a perch or <b>vantage</b> <b>point</b> to hunt from, {{the southern}} boobook pounces on prey then retreats {{to a tree}} or elevated place to eat it.

5|$|A {{possible}} {{issue with}} the causeway's identification as a Roman structure {{in the latter half}} of the twentieth century was its incorporation of many small bends along its course. Roman military roads are usually straight in both their overall course, and also typically from one <b>vantage</b> <b>point</b> to the next. Both the Foss Way and the Stanegate, roads of established Roman provenance, have sinuous courses similar to Wade's causeway, so the objection is not conclusive.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this work, {{we propose}} {{techniques}} to attain visibility into an arbitrary Internet subnetwork that {{is responsive to}} indirect probes but not to direct probes. By probing the network from {{a small number of}} selected <b>vantage</b> <b>points,</b> we are able to collect information about network-layer topology which would otherwise be hidden from measurement due to rate limiting practices, security mechanisms, and routing dynamics. We investigate the reasons for differing visibility, and the required number and placement strategies of <b>vantage</b> <b>points</b> needed to collect topology information at a low cost. We demonstrate substantial improvement in global visibility as probed by the TraceNET path measurement tool when leveraging only five 1 2 <b>vantage</b> <b>points</b> selected according to route similarity.

5|$|If {{a spider}} walks under a P. schultzi female's capture web and the {{vertical}} distance {{is less than}} 8centimetres, the P. schultzi often drops onto the prey too fast for a human eye to follow. If the P. schultzi misses, it quickly returns up its safety line to its <b>vantage</b> <b>point</b> and looks for another chance - and seldom misses the second time. Most drops cover two to four centimetres, as longer drops are often obstructed by the web.|$|E

5|$|In June 1944, {{units of}} the 346th Infantry Division {{occupied}} Bréville-les-Monts, a village on a watershed between the rivers Orne and Dives.

Following several German attacks on British positions from Bréville-les-Monts, the capture of the village became essential to secure the 6th Airborne Division positions and protect the Allied beachhead.|$|E
5|$|The red-capped robin mostly pounces on prey on the ground, {{although}} it can swoop and catch creatures while airborne. Less often, it gleans (takes prey while perched) in low-lying vegetation, almost always less than 3m (10ft) above the ground. The prey is most commonly on the ground when caught, although airborne insects are sometimes taken. A low branch {{may be used as}} a <b>vantage</b> <b>point</b> in hunting.|$|E

Only Jordanian soldiers and tourists were to be found there. A <b>vantage</b> <b>point</b> on Mount Zion, from which the Wall could be viewed, became the place where Jews gathered to pray. For thousands of pilgrims, the mount, being the closest location to the Wall under Israeli control, became a substitute site for the traditional priestly blessing ceremony which takes place on the Three Pilgrimage Festivals.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the pervasiveness}} of Internet {{censorship}}, we have scant data on its extent, mechanisms, and evolution. Mea-suring censorship is challenging: it requires continual measurement of reachability to many target sites from diverse <b>vantage</b> <b>points.</b> Amassing suitable <b>vantage</b> <b>points</b> for longitudinal measurement is difficult; existing systems have achieved only small, short-lived deployments. We observe, however, that most Internet users access content via Web browsers, and {{the very nature of}} Web site design allows browsers to make requests to domains with differ-ent origins than the main Web page. We present Encore, a system that harnesses cross-origin requests to measure Web filtering from a diverse set of <b>vantage</b> <b>points</b> with-out requiring users to install custom software, enabling longitudinal measurements from many <b>vantage</b> <b>points.</b> We explain how Encore induces Web clients to perform cross-origin requests that measure Web filtering, design a distributed platform for scheduling and collecting these measurements, show the feasibility of a global-scale de-ployment with a pilot study and an analysis of potentially censored Web content, identify several cases of filtering in six months of measurements, and discuss ethical concerns that would arise with widespread deployment. ...|$|R
