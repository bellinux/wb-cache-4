40|$|Chemical {{constituents}} {{of the leaves}} of rabbiteye blueberry (Vaccinium ashei READE) were investigated in detail. The major phenolic components were caffeoyl quinic acids, flavonol glycosides, flavan- 3 -ols and proanthocyanidins. Catechins and proanthocyanidins having additional phenylpropanoid units, such as cinchonains, kandelins and mururins, characterised the polyphenols of this plant. Among them, <b>vaccinin</b> A, an isomer of mururin A, {{was found to be}} a new compound, and the structure was characterised by spectroscopic methods. The most abundant polyphenols (11. 3 % of freeze-dried leaves) were oligomeric proanthocyanidins. Thiol degradation with mercaptoethanol indicated that the polymer was constituted of (+) -catechin and (-) -epicatechin as the terminal units and (-) -epicatechin, procyanidin A- 2, and cinchonains Ia and Ib as the extension units. Mass spectral analysis suggested the presence of at least dodecamers with A-type linkages and phenylpropanoid moieties...|$|E
