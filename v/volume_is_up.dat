50|$|However, not all {{critics have}} been {{impressed}} with the album. The band's hometown newspaper, the Los Angeles Times, gave the album a pretty negative review, saying it is a mishmash, lacks a center, and way too often feels duct-taped together from various points in the band's career. Writer Randall Roberts stated {{that out of the}} 14-song album there is a good EP worth of songs and did praise the album's first single, 'The Adventures of Rain Dance Maggie' along with 'Brendan's Death Song', which he said are among the best songs of the band's career. Roberts ended his review by saying the rest of the songs are stuff that will probably sound just fine beneath NFL highlight reels but fails to gel when the <b>volume</b> <b>is</b> <b>up</b> and California 2011 beckons.|$|E
5000|$|The fifth {{generation}} car has {{the widest}} variety of names of any generation. In most countries, it {{is referred to}} as the Jetta. Exceptions to this include [...] "Bora" [...] in Mexico and Colombia, [...] "Vento" [...] in Argentina and Chile, and [...] "Sagitar" [...] in China. The Mark 5 is 170 mm longer, 30 mm wider, and has a 70 mm longer wheelbase than the previous iteration. Interior room has increased from 2.46 cubic metres (87 cu ft) to 2.58 cubic metres (91 cu ft). In particular, rear legroom was increased by 65 mm over the fourth generation. Luggage compartment <b>volume</b> <b>is</b> <b>up</b> to 453 litres (16 cu ft).

40|$|The metal {{coatings}} {{in combination}} with sonochemical and leaching processes are used for nanostructuring and functionalization of glass, flax and hemp fabrics. The leaching is used for nanostructuring sodium alumosilicate K-glass fabrics to obtained silica like fibre with nanoporous structure on surface and in volume. The natural fibres as well as fabrics themselves are porous media. The porous media adsorbs water and content of moisture in fabrics have to be controlled. The metal-coated fabric characterization is an actual problem. Application of metal coatings for the functionalization of technical fibres and fabrics faced with influence of moisture on functional properties, e. g., the impedance of the metal coated K- glass and flax and hemp fabrics have strong dependence of content absorbed water or moisture. Presented studies are on the moisture content determination methodology based on thermogravimetric analyses and impedance spectroscopy. The leached K-glass fibres have three absorption sites with different kinetic and desorption heat. The flax has more complicated distribution of sorption/desorption sites. The water desorption heat 1, 3 kJ/g for both type of fabrics in temperature range 30 – 150 0 C {{is comparable to the}} water evaporation heat 2, 3 kJ/g at 100 0 C.

The petroleum transport lasted until the 1980s, when the Muruvik terminal was sold to Norwegian interests.
