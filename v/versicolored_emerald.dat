50|$|The white-chested emerald (Amazilia brevirostris) is a hummingbird {{found in}} eastern Venezuela, the Guianas, Trinidad and far {{northern}} Brazil (Roraima). It {{has sometimes been}} placed in the genus Agyrtria, and the name A. chionopectus was formerly used for this species, as the name A. brevirostris {{was believed to be}} applicable to the <b>versicolored</b> <b>emerald.</b> While most current authorities maintain the view that A. brevirostris is the correct name for the white-chested emerald, it has recently been suggested that this is incorrect, in which case its scientific name would revert to A. chionopectus.|$|E
5000|$|The exact {{distribution}} limits between several subspecies of the versicoloured emerald {{are poorly}} known, and, {{in addition to}} the coastal nominate, some other subspecies have been considered separate species, especially the blue-green emerald (A. (v.) rondoniae), also known as the Rondonia emerald. This was based on plumage and reported sympatry with A. versicolor (ssp?), but except for the blue to the head, A. v. rondoniae is very similar to A. v. nitidifrons, and any evidence for sympatry is lacking. It was therefore [...] "de-listed" [...] by the South American Classification Committee, and is now considered a subspecies of the <b>versicolored</b> <b>emerald,</b> with some even suggesting that rondoniae is entirely invalid.|$|E
