Subsequent hole directed reactivity {{of the radical}} cations of halogen bonded clusters is also discussed. Furthermore, we have examined effect of the halogen bond strength on the electron-electron correlation- and relaxation-driven charge migration in halogen bonded complexes. For this study, we have selected A-Cl (A represents F, OH, CN, NH 2, CF 3, and COOH substituents) molecules paired with NH 3 (referred as ACl:NH 3 complex) : these complexes exhibit halogen bonds. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first report on purely electron correlation- and relaxation-driven ultrafast (attosecond) charge migration dynamics through halogen bonds. Both density functional theory and complete active space self-consistent field theory with 6 - 31 + G(d, p) basis set are employed for this work. Upon <b>vertical</b> <b>ionization</b> of NCCl⋯NH 3 complex, the hole is predicted to migrate from the NH 3 -end to the ClCN-end of the NCCl⋯NH 3 complex in approximately 0. 5 fs on the D 0 cationic surface. This hole migration leads to structural rearrangement of the halogen bonded complex, yielding hydrogen bonding interaction stronger than the halogen bonding interaction on the same cationic surface. Other halogen bonded complexes, such as H 2 NCl:NH 3, F 3 CCl:NH 3, and HOOCCl:NH 3, exhibit similar charge migration following <b>vertical</b> <b>ionization.</b> On the contrary, FCl:NH 3 and HOCl:NH 3 complexes do not exhibit any charge migration following <b>vertical</b> <b>ionization</b> to the D 0 cation state, pointing to interesting halogen bond strength-dependent charge migration...|$|R

For noncovalent interactions, TAO-GGAs with empirical dispersion corrections are shown to yield excellent performance.
