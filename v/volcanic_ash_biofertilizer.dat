40|$|The {{forecast}} accuracy of distal <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> clouds {{is important for}} providing valid aviation advice during <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> eruption. However, because the distal part of <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> plume {{is far from the}} volcano, the influence of eruption information on this part becomes rather indirect and uncertain, resulting in inaccurate <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> forecasts in these distal areas. In our approach, we use real-life aircraft in situ observations, measured in the northwestern part of Germany during the 2010  Eyjafjallajökull eruption, in an ensemble-based data assimilation system combined with a <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> transport model to investigate the potential improvement on the {{forecast accuracy}} with regard to the distal <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> plume. We show that the error of the analyzed <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> state can be significantly reduced through assimilating real-life in situ measurements. After a continuous assimilation, it is shown that the aviation advice for Germany, the Netherlands and Luxembourg can be significantly improved.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} early ages of {{hydration}} behavior when basaltic <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> {{was used as}} a partial substitute to ordinary Portland cement using ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering and wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS). The mix design consisted of 10, 30 and 50 % substitution of Portland cement with two different-sized <b>volcanic</b> <b>ashes.</b> The data showed that substitution of <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> above 30 % results in excess unreacted <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash,</b> rather than additional pozzolanic reactions along longer length scales. WAXS studies revealed that addition of finely ground <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> facilitated calcium-silicate-hydrate related phases, whereas inclusion of coarser <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> caused domination by calcium-aluminum-silicate-hydrate and unreacted MgO phases, suggesting some <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> remained unreacted throughout the hydration process. Addition of more than 30 % <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> leads to coarser morphology along with decreased surface area and higher intensity of scattering at early-age hydration. This suggests an abrupt dissolution indicated by changes in surface area due to the retarding gel formation that can have implication on early-age setting influencing the mechanical properties of the resulting cementitious matrix. The findings from this work show that the concentration of <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> influences the specific surface area and morphology of hydration products during the early age of hydration.

Even if the amount of <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> is small, it can be fatal on the agricultural sector withering many plants and causing soil acidification. Thus, in this paper, we aim to estimate agricultural losses caused by the <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> and to visualize them with Google map. To estimate the <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> losses, a damage assessment model is needed. As the <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> hazard depends on the kind of a crops and the ash thickness, the fragility function of damage assessment model should represent the relation between ash thickness and damage rate of crops.
