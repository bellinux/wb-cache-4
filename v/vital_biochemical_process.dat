40|$|The {{spontaneous}} deamidation of asparaginyl residues at biological pH of 7. 4 causes experimentally and biologically {{important changes}} {{resulting in the}} formation of inactive peptides and proteins [1]. In asparaginyl deamidation, the primary reaction products are aspartyl and isoaspartyl residues [1]. Deamidation at neutral pH introduces a negative charge at the deamidation site and sometimes also leads to β isomerization [2]. These alterations in structure affect the properties of peptides and proteins in chemically and biologically important pathways [1]. It has been suggested that isoaspartates in proteins serves as a molecular timer of biological events and as a mechanism for postsynthetic production of unique proteins of biological significance [3 - 5]. In the case of in vivo protein turnover, the use of deamidation as a molecular timer has been experimentally demonstrated [6 - 8]. Deamidation has been primarily observed to progressively increase in aging cells and tissues[9]. Cellular aging is a fundamental phenomenon that affects all somatic cells at definite points of time in their longevity cycle and whose manifestation varies within cell types. Aging in its essence encompasses all those processes that lead to a decline in the ability of the organism to cope with environmental stresses and is defined as the accumulation of diverse deleterious changes occurring in cells and tissues with time that are responsible for the increased risk of disease and death. The major theories of aging eg, the free radical theory [10], the immunologic theory[11], the inflammation theory[12], and mitochondrial theory [13] are all specific of a particular cause of aging, providing useful and important insights for the understanding of physiological changes occurring with aging. With progressive cellular aging, the <b>vital</b> <b>biochemical</b> <b>process</b> slows down and biologically relevant macromolecules accumulate undesirable modifications. Such modifications further impair cellular functions thus hastening the progression of aging...|$|E
40|$|The purines are a {{group of}} {{molecules}} used by all cells for many <b>vital</b> <b>biochemical</b> <b>processes</b> including energy-requiring enzymatic reactions, cofactor-requiring reactions, synthesis of DNA or RNA, signaling pathways within and between cells, and other processes. Defects {{in some of the}} enzymes of purine metabolism are known to be associated with specific clinical disorders, and neurological problems may be a presenting sign or the predominant clinical problem for several of them. This chapter describes three disorders for which the clinical features and metabolic basis are well characterized. Deficiency of adenylosuccinate-lyase (ADSL) causes psychomotor retardation, epilepsy, and autistic features. Lesch-Nyhan disease is caused by deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) and is characterized by hyperuricemia, motor and cognitive disability, and self-injurious behavior. Deficiency of myoadenylate deaminase (mAMPD) is associated with myopathic features. In addition to these disorders, several other disorders are briefly summarized. These include defects of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthase, adenosine deaminase (ADA), purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PND), deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK), or IMP dehydrogenase (IMPDH). Each of these disorders provides an unusual window on the unique importance of purine metabolism for function of different parts of the nervous system. © 2013 Elsevier B. V...|$|R

Advisor: Veglia, Gianluigi. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xxi, 445 pages, appendices I-IV. Membrane proteins and antimicrobial peptides represent two diverse and challenging classes of macromolecules to characterize {{at the molecular}} level. They are linked by the interaction with the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane. Within the lipid bilayer, membrane proteins are involved in <b>vital</b> <b>biochemical</b> <b>processes</b> such as ion transport, signal transduction and cell adhesion. Antimicrobial peptides are a broad class of polypeptides produced by all living organisms, representing {{the first line of}} defense against bacterial infections. They work by selectively targeting the bacterial membranes and subsequently killing the cell by a variety of mechanisms such as membrane disruption, membrane potential dissipation and enzyme inactivation. Although very important, membrane proteins and antimicrobial peptides are underrepresented in terms of available high-resolution structural information compared to water-soluble proteins and this limits the current understanding of how they work in living cells. In this thesis I summarize my contribution towards the elucidation of the high-resolution structures of the integral membrane protein phospholamban and the mechanism of action of two important antimicrobial peptides (LL 37 and distinctin) by a hybrid solution and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy approach.

In the present work, aqueous FA solutions are submitted to electron-beam (E-beam) radiation in a dose range of 0. 25 – 10  kGy. Upon irradiation, main FA radio-products are quantified by HPLC. E-beam processing undergoes radiolysis to yield some known FA photoproducts and also new radio-products are formed: 6 -(hydroxymethyl) pterin and N-(4 -nitrobenzoyl) -l-glutamic acid.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Biochemistry)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. Neural tube defects (NTD) are a {{group of}} folate-responsive {{congenital}} defects that occur relatively frequently in humans. NTD display a multi-factorial aetiology, resulting from a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors (i. e. dietary folate and/or vitamin B 12 deficiency, teratogenic xenobiotics, etc.). β-Hydroxynorvaline (HNV) is a proven toxic, non-protein amino acid (xenobiotic agent), structurally related to L-threonine and L-serine and able to substitute L-threonine in the primary structure of proteins. The main objectives {{of this study were}} to investigate the teratogenic potential of HNV in the chicken embryo and Hanover NMRl mouse embryo models and to elucidate some of the molecular mechanisms involved in the aetiology of NTD. HNV was dosed to chicken embryos (in ovo), 24 h post incubation (p. i.) at 37. 8 °C ± 0. 5 °C. Controls received a sterile saline solution. Chicken embryos were removed 12 days p. i., weighed, fixed in Allen's solution and investigated stereo-microscopically to assess the incidence and nature of dysmorphogenic events (i. e. NTD). Body, toe and beak lengths of the chicken embryos were measured. Chicken embryo fibroblasts were cultured and used to measure the effect of HNV on the biosynthesis of DNA in fibroblasts. Pregnant Hannover NMRl female mice were dosed with HNV or a saline solution (per os) on days 7 - 9 post coitus (p. c.). Following the last dose of HNV on day 9, the pregnant mice were placed in metabolic cages for 24 h to collect urine samples. Urinary organic acids (GC-MS), acylcarnitines and amino acids (ESI-MSMS) were quantitatively and qualitatively determined to assess the catabolic breakdown of H NV and its effects on vital metabolic processes, such as amino acid catabolism and the P-oxidation of fatty acids. Control and HNV exposed mouse embryos were removed on days 10 or 18 post coitus (p. c.). Embryos, removed from each individual mother on day 10 were pooled and either immediately used to assess the catalytic activity of the glycine cleavage system (GCS), or stored at - 75 °C until the catalytic activities of cytosolic (cSHMT), mitochondria 1 serine hydroxymethyltransferase (mSHMT) and citrate synthase (CS) could be assayed. Mouse embryos removed on day 18 p. c., weighed and stereo-microscopically investigated to assess the incidence and nature of dysmorphogenic events. Bio-indicators of the effect of HNV on the flow of one-carbon units through the folate and remethylation cycles (i. e. [3 H]-thyrnidine incorporation, DNA methylation and synthesis, polyamine synthesis, carnitine synthesis, etc.) were determined in the liver tissues of pregnant females and in pooled batches of whole embryos. HNV proved to be embryotoxic and displayed the capacity to induce a variety of congenital defects, including NTD, in both the chicken and mouse embryo models. The incidence of NTD in both models proved to be dose-dependent. Selected stereoisomers of HNV were rapidly catabolised and the main HNV derived metabolite in the urines of HNV treated pregnant mice, was identified as 2, 3 - dihydroxypentanoic acid (DHPA; GC-MS). The structure of DHPA was confirmed by chemical synthesis and subsequent GC-MS, NMR (13 c-NMR, 1 H-NMR, HETCOR and COSY) spectroscopy and IR spectrometry. HNV altered the flow of one-carbon units through the folate and remethylation cycles, causing a decrease in DNA synthesis, DNA methylation, polyarnine biosynthesis, carnitine and trimethyllysine synthesis. Free carnitine stores in HNV treated pregnant mice appeared to be depleted, probably due to a combined effect of the detoxification of vast amounts of accumulated metabolites, generated as a result of HNV toxicosis and decreased carnitine biosynthesis. HNV also appeared to have altered serinelglycine interconversion, due to an inhibition of cSHMT and to a lesser degree the inhibition of GCS. Organic acid profiles of urine samples, collected from HNV treated pregnant mice, suggested that HNV had induced a general ketothiolase defect in pregnant females by inhibiting the P-oxidation of fatty acids, isoleucine catabolism and ketone body utilisation. HNV affected the hornocysteine to cysteine transulffuration by acting as a substrate for CBS, culminating in the biosynthesis of Sethylcysteine (GC-MS). The presence of 3 -ethylcysteine in the urines of HNV treated pregnant mice was confirmed by GC-MS. following its in vitro synthesis, employing a reaction system containing mouse liver hornogenate, homocysteine, HNV and pyridoxal- 5 - phosphate. In conclusion, HNV can apparently cause multiple metabolic perturbations in pregnant mice and their developing embryos. One-carbon flux, energy metabolism {{and a number of other}} <b>vital</b> <b>biochemical</b> <b>processes</b> can be adversely affected, resulting in a disturbance of normal embryonic development (i. e. proper closure of the neural tube) and subsequent dysmorphogenesis in developing embryos.
