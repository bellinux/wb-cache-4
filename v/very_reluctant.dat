At Augustus’ request in 11 BC, Tiberius divorced Vipsania and married Julia the Elder, Augustus' daughter and Agrippa's widow. Tiberius was <b>very</b> <b>reluctant</b> to do this, as Julia had made advances to him when she was married and Tiberius was happily married. His new marriage with Julia was happy at first, but turned sour.|$|E
5|$|In early drafts, the elephant's name {{changed from}} Osmer to Bosco to Humphrey. The final choice, Horton, was {{apparently}} after Horton Conrad, one of Geisel's classmates at Dartmouth College. The bird's name changed from Bessie to Saidie and finally Mayzie. In the first draft, the elephant character volunteered {{to sit on}} the eggs for the bird, who was <b>very</b> <b>reluctant.</b>|$|E
5|$|Like the {{previous}} two presidential elections, no candidates were put forward for voters to choose between in 1796. The Constitution provided for the selection of electors who would then elect a president. In seven states voters chose the presidential electors. In the remaining nine states, they were chosen by the state's legislature. The clear favorite of Democratic–Republicans was Jefferson, although he was <b>very</b> <b>reluctant</b> to run. There was little doubt that Adams would be {{the choice of a}} great majority of the Federalists. Even so, Hamilton also had hoped to lead the party.|$|E

5|$|The 1989 Draft {{has been}} noted as having been {{exceptionally}} successful for Detroit. While team executive Jim Devellano stated the team would be satisfied with two players from that draft {{making it to the}} NHL, seven of them did so. Those seven players (Mike Sillinger, Bob Boughner, Lidstrom, Fedorov, Shawn McCosh, Dallas Drake and Vladimir Konstantinov) amassed 5,995 games played, 1,227 goals, 2,367 assists, 3,594 points and 5,108 penalties in minutes. That draft has also been marked as signalling a paradigm shift for Detroit as prior to that the club was <b>very</b> <b>reluctant</b> to draft players from outside North America. Since then the club has drafted a large number of European as well as other non-North American players. In 2000, for example, they drafted four Swedes, three Russians, two Canadians, one Slovak and one American.|$|E
5|$|After {{a request}} from Army Group F to Himmler, a {{decision}} was made to move IX SS Mountain Corps and the division to perform road and railway security duties near Zagreb. This would relieve LXIX Army Corps from those duties so that it could reinforce a defensive line along the Drina facing the advancing Red Army. The 28th Regiment, I/27 and III/AR 13 were to remain behind at the Brčko bridgehead to keep the Sava river bridge open. The heavy desertions from the division were the main reason for the move from north-east Bosnia to northern Croatia, but it made matters worse: the Bosnians were <b>very</b> <b>reluctant</b> to leave Bosnia and the already serious desertion rate became a flood when the move began on 16 October 1944. Many took their weapons with them and hundreds joined the Partisans. In mid-October, 700 members of the division stationed at Orašje joined the Partisans, and were distributed between the 17th Majevica Brigade and 21st East Bosnian Brigade.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of the}} 20th century, women's {{football}} was a niche sport in Germany and was frowned upon. When the DFB appointed Gero Bisanz to coach the newly founded women's national team, he was initially <b>very</b> <b>reluctant</b> about his assignment and feared it would harm his reputation. Winning the 1989 European Championship was the team's first international success, but it had little lasting effect on their popularity. As a gift for the first European trophy, every player received a tea set, which is often cited {{as an example of}} male chauvinism and general lack of interest in the women's national team at that time. This attitude within the German Football Association has changed considerably in the last two decades, in particular during the term of Theo Zwanziger as DFB president, an outspoken supporter of women's football.|$|E

50|$|H. gigas is {{primarily}} a diurnal species. It {{is also a very}} active and inquistive snake, which will spend much of the day climbing, burrowing and even swimming. Their temperaments can vary considerably between specimens; some are <b>very</b> docile and <b>reluctant</b> to bite, whilst others are very defensive and even aggressive or intimidating. Captive-bred specimens can become quite tame and trusting and many exhibit a high level of intelligence.|$|R
5|$|The Maharaja of Patiala again invited Kilner to {{play and}} coach in India {{in the winter of}} 1927–28. Kilner's sister Mollie later said he was <b>very</b> <b>reluctant</b> to take up the {{invitation}} and hesitated before accepting. The trip started badly when Kilner's uncle, Irving Washington, died the day after he departed, and several of Kilner's actions suggest this triggered some form of depression. Even so, Kilner recorded several large scores, including an unbeaten 283 in one (non first-class) match. Near the end of trip, he began to suffer from a fever. His Yorkshire team mates, Arthur Dolphin and Maurice Leyland, who were also in India, believed he became unwell after eating oysters, but it is not certain how or when Kilner became ill. He began to have shivering attacks and perspiration while travelling from Marseilles on the way home. It was obvious he was seriously ill when he arrived in Southampton; a cricketing engagement was cancelled and he was confined to bed. He refused treatment in Southampton, wishing to return to his family, and asking for his wife. Arriving in Wombwell on 27 March 1928, he was examined by his doctor and taken home. Subsequently, his condition deteriorated and he was taken to Kendray Fever Hospital, near Barnsley. Although it was thought he had passed the worst, his condition became critical in {{the first few days of}} April. On 5 April 1928, Kilner died from enteric fever in the presence of his wife.|$|E

25|$|Initially, Aspasia was <b>very</b> <b>reluctant</b> {{to accept}} the romantic {{advances}} of the prince. Renowned for his many female conquests, Alexander seemed to her untrustworthy, also because their social differences impeded any serious relationship. However, the perseverance of the Greek prince, who travelled to Spetses {{in the summer of}} 1915 with the only purpose to see Aspasia, finally overcame her misgivings.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The task of {{planning}} humanitarian relief operations within {{a high number}} of hardly collaborating and vaguely linked non-governmental organizations is a challenging problem. We suggest an alternative knowledge based approach to the coalition formation problem for humanitarian and peace-keeping missions. Owing to the very special nature of this domain, where the agents representing individual organisations may eventually agree to collaborate, but are <b>very</b> often <b>reluctant</b> to share their knowledge and resources, we tried to reduce the problem complexity by splitting the community of agents into alliances. We combined classical negotiation mechanisms with the acquaintance models and social knowledge techniques {{in order to reduce the}} communication traffic and to keep the privacy of knowledge. Experimental results are discussed in the paper. ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Carey {{had been}} {{informed}} that his pupils {{would not come}} to him during the few days of their father's stay; and Sam begged to ride in on his pony {{by the side of}} the carriage; but he was desired to fetch his books, and call Henry, as his uncle wished to give them both an examination. Was this the beginning of captivity to Uncle John? David and Johnnie were quite angry. They considered it highly proper that Hal should be shut up with Uncle John, but they thought it very hard that Sam should be so used too; and Sam himself looked <b>very</b> round-backed, <b>reluctant,</b> and miserable, partly at the task, partly at being deprived of the sight of his father for several hours of one of those few precious days.|$|R
50|$|The Muthuvans are <b>very</b> {{independent}} and <b>reluctant</b> {{to interact with}} the outside world. Muthvan women are strictly prohibited from having contact with non-Muthvans, especially non-Muthvan men. There is a hamlet of Muthuvans at Machiplavu kudi near Adimali, idukki district of Kerala. The Muthuvan women usually live in bamboo huts and are not allowed to talk or see men outside their tribe. The Muthuva tribe grows ragi, cardamom and lemon grass. Now they are also cultivating banana and tapioca for their daily usage. Most of their women are illiterate and strongly bonded with their customs.|$|R
25|$|The West German Federal Government was <b>very</b> <b>reluctant</b> {{to prosecute}} Tiede and Ruske {{because of the}} West German policy of {{supporting}} the right of East Germans to flee oppression in the GDR. But the United States government had just spent years, finally successfully, persuading the East German government to sign a hijacking treaty. Consequently, the case was prosecuted in the never-before-convened United States Court for Berlin.|$|E
25|$|Māori {{were badly}} {{hit by the}} 1918 {{influenza}} epidemic when the Māori battalion returned from the Western Front. The death rate from influenza for Māori was 4.5 times higher than for Pakeha. Many Māori, especially in the Waikato, were <b>very</b> <b>reluctant</b> to visit a doctor {{and went to a}} hospital only when the patient was nearly dead. To cope with isolation, Waikato Māori, under Te Puea's leadership, increasingly returned to the old Pai Marire (Hau hau) cult of the 1860s.|$|E
25|$|After peaking {{during the}} {{whirlwind}} campaign {{west of the}} Oder, {{the morale of the}} French troops hit a new low point in Poland. The bad weather and approaching winter made Napoleon's troops <b>very</b> <b>reluctant</b> to continue the campaign. The Polish roads went from deep mud to frozen ruts as the weather grew colder. The emperor was forced to dispense a bonus in pay and extra shirts and shoes for his soldiers. Even so, French military discipline grew worse. At this time, Napoleon first used the term, les grognards (the grumblers), to describe his troops.|$|E
60|$|The last bell of {{the steamer}} rang. Cytherea had {{forgotten}} herself, {{and what she}} was looking for. In a fever of distress lest Owen should be left behind, she gathered up in her hand {{the corners of her}} handkerchief, containing specimens of the shells, plants, and fossils which the locality produced, started off to the sands, and mingled with the knots of visitors there congregated from other interesting points around; from the inn, the cottages, and hired conveyances that had returned from short drives inland. They all went aboard by the primitive plan of a narrow plank on two wheels--the women being assisted by a rope. Cytherea lingered till the <b>very</b> last, <b>reluctant</b> to follow, and looking alternately at the boat and the valley behind. Her delay provoked a remark from Captain Jacobs, a thickset man of hybrid stains, resulting from the mixed effects of fire and water, peculiar to sailors where engines are the propelling power.|$|R

25|$|Opponents {{have argued}} that at least in North America, wolves {{contribute}} little to overall livestock losses. In 2005 0.11% of all cattle losses were due to wolves. In states with wolf populations, they were responsible {{for an average of}} 2.5% of predation on sheep. Jim Dutcher, a filmmaker who raised a captive wolf pack, observed that the wolves were <b>very</b> <b>reluctant</b> to try meat that they had not previously eaten or seen another wolf eat before, possibly explaining why livestock depredation is unlikely except in cases of desperation. In Wyoming, Idaho and Montana, wolf predation accounts for 1% of total sheep deaths.|$|E
25|$|Inimicus are piscivorous ambush predators. They are nocturnal and {{typically}} lie partially buried {{on the sea}} floor or on a coral head during the day, covering themselves with sand and other debris to further camouflage themselves. They have no known natural predators. When threatened, they spread their brilliantly colored pectoral and caudal fins as a warning. Once dug in, they are <b>very</b> <b>reluctant</b> to leave their hiding places. When they do move, they display an unusual mechanism of subcarangiform locomotion---they crawl slowly along the seabed, employing the four lower rays (two on each side) of their pectoral fins as legs.|$|E
25|$|The {{housing units}} were {{scheduled}} for purchase and demolishing, except Hatlestad Terrasse 99, situated {{next to the}} source of the slide. The housing units below the slide would also be secured against landslides by a concrete wall. Furthermore, the municipality gave the residents new, temporary places to live and monetary compensation. The owners of the housing unit not included in the agreement risked having to move back to his home after his insurance company paid its repairs, which they were <b>very</b> <b>reluctant</b> to do. However, eventually the company decided to take over the house and then hand it over to the municipality for demolishing.|$|E
50|$|Like its predecessors, the Council of Elders under Somdet Nyanasamvara {{has been}} <b>very</b> {{conservative}} and <b>reluctant</b> to act without great deliberation. There are some indications {{that this may}} be the best course for maintaining the confidence of the lay public; in the United States, for instance, some temples that have attempted to change the roles of Theravada monks have been met by a strong backlash from their lay communities. However, the troubles of the Catholic Church in the United States have offered a model of the possible consequences of failing to deal openly and swiftly with corruption and misconduct: an eventual meltdown, made worse by stop-gap attempts to preserve the people’s faith in religious institutions, rather than dealing openly with problems.|$|R

The city of Berlin was <b>reluctant</b> <b>very</b> much opposed to take this route from the Dahlem Council or the Prussian Treasury. But in 1926 the situation improved considerably. The Prussian state wanted the route Berlin handed over free of charge and free of debt. At the same time offered the Sommerfeld Group, the great, still a farming areas had in {{the south of}} Berlin, free land and a construction cost assumption for an extension to Krumme Lanke. Thus, Berlin was in fact paid to three kilometers underground.|$|R
