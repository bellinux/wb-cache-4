30|$|In {{terms of}} obtaining IP connectivity, a ship can be {{directly}} connected to a base station, provided that the base station is within its communication range by guaranteeing line-of-sight (LOS). Otherwise, the ship can be indirectly connected to the base station {{with the help of}} neighboring ships in an ad hoc manner. The <b>VHF</b> <b>communication</b> range of a ship depends on the length of its mast, which is determined by the length overall (LOA) [13]. In the case where the length of the mast is less than 5 m, the <b>VHF</b> <b>communication</b> range is from 20 to 30 km. In the case where the length of the mast is from 12 to 30 m, the <b>VHF</b> <b>communication</b> range is from 55 to 120 km. As an example, a ship with a mast of 30 m that makes a voyage along a sea route which is normally 100 nautical miles (i.e., 185 km) from the shore, it can achieve IP connectivity to a base station by going through three or four hops, provided that it locates its neighboring ships.|$|R

40|$|Embedded {{computer}} systems equipped with wireless <b>communication</b> <b>transceivers</b> are nowadays {{used in a}} vast number of application scenarios. Energy consumption is important in many of these scenarios, as systems are battery operated and long maintenance-free operation is required. To achieve this goal, embedded systems employ low-power <b>communication</b> <b>transceivers</b> and protocols. However, currently used protocols cannot operate efficiently when communication channels are highly erroneous. In this study, we show how average diversity combining (ADC) can be used in state-of-the-art low-power communication protocols. This novel approach improves transmission reliability and in consequence energy consumption and transmission latency in the presence of erroneous channels. Using a testbed, we show that highly erroneous channels are indeed a common occurrence in situations, where low-power systems are used and we demonstrate that ADC improves low-power communication dramatically...|$|R
40|$|Very High Frequency (VHF) range {{covers the}} range of radio {{frequency}} electromagnetic waves from 156 MHz to 162. 025 MHz. Marine <b>VHF</b> <b>communication</b> devices have a wide application in navigation onboard convention and non-convention vessels. <b>VHF</b> <b>communication</b> is also partly used in inland waterways, rivers, and lakes.
