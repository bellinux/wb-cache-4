These models consider the salta tion layer as a boundary condition. For the now, and for the suspension, we adopt the same model as that ofUemats u a nd Liston. For mass exchange be tween the now a nd snow surface, we have developed an ero-sion- deposition model where mass excha nge is defined in rela tion to fl ow turbul ence, threshold-fri cti on velocity and snow concentration.

40|$|First {{received}} June 1994; {{accepted in}} revised form August 1995) Abstract [...] The filtration and expression behaviour {{of sewage sludge}} is discussed. Due to the increase of costs for controlled umping and transport and more severe environmental legislation the need for decreased sludge volumes is rising. Filtration and expression are the cheapest dewatering operations and it is therefore desirable to remove the maximal feasible amount of water by mechanical dewatering. High dry solids contents of 35 - 40 wt % can already be reached at pressures of 300 - 400 kPa and optimal flocculation conditions; however at pressures of 6 [...] 10 MPa dry solids contents of 60 wt % can be reached. Further the modelling of the dewatering is discussed; model and experiment show acceptable agreement.

40|$|Modelling of mass {{transfer}} of particles to solid surfaces {{is a considerable}} challenge in most industrial processes. Using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) directly on these applications is very challenging and costly due to the grid refinement required to capture the complex physical processes that dominate in the near-wall region. We propose a detailed boundary layer model, which can couple the detailed physics in the wall region with the external flow. This mass-transfer wall function can be applied as a boundary condition for coarse grid CFD models. The detailed boundary layer model incorporates external forces, turbulence and hydrodynamic lift and drag. In addition we include the effects of Brownian diffusion, thermophoresis, XDLVO forces and the inter-particle collisions. The particle deposition flux to the wall is modified with an effective adhesion probability, caused by the adhesive forces and the turbulent shear stress statistics.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work has been to investigate {{the applicability of the}} gas gun to study the armature-rail interface wear characteristics relevant to rail gun operations. The approach involved developing constitutive models for armature materials (aluminum 6061) as well as oxygen-free high-thermal conductivity copper as the rail material. Taylor rod-on-anvil impact experiments were performed to validate the accuracy of constitutive strength models by correlating predictions of dynamic simulations in ANSYS AUTODYN with experimental observations. An optical comparator was used to discretize the cross sectional deformation profile of each rod-shaped sample. Parameters of the Johnson-Cook strength model were adjusted for each material to match deformation profiles obtained from simulations with profiles obtained from impact experiments. The fitted Johnson-Cook model parameters for each material were able to give overall deformed length and diameter values within 2 % of the experimentally observed data. Additional simulations were then used with the validated strength model parameters to design the geometry involving cylindrical rods of armature material accelerated through a concentric cylindrical extrusion die made of copper, to emulate the interface wear effects produced in a rail gun operation. Experiments were conducted using this geometry and employing both the 7. 62 mm and 80 mm diameter gas guns. Microstructural analysis was conducted on interfaces of the recovered samples from both designs. Hardness measurements were also performed along the interface layer to evaluate the structure formation due to solid-state wear or melt formation. The stress and strain conditions resulting in the observed microstructural effects were correlated with predictions from numerical simulations performed using the validated material models. The overall results illustrate that the stress-strain conditions produced during acceleration of Al through hollow concentric copper extrusion die, result in interface deformation and wear characteristics that are influenced by velocity. At velocities (less than 800 m/s), interface wear leads to formation of layer dominated by solid-state alloying of Cu and Al, while higher velocities produce a melted and re-solidified aluminum layer. Hence, use of different armature (Al-based) and rail (Cu-based) materials can be evaluated with the gas-gun set-up employed in the current work to study the effects of interface wear ranging from formation melt layer to solid-state alloying as a function of material properties and <b>velocity.</b> <b>M.</b> <b>S.</b> Committee Chair: Dr. Thadhani; Committee Member: Dr. Cowan; Committee Member: Dr. Danyluk; Committee Member: Dr. Rose...|$|E
40|$|Walking is a {{basic form}} of {{locomotion}} and walking velocity is a good predictor of human health, with faster velocities indicating better health. While faster walking velocities {{have been attributed to}} overall increases in lower extremity joint torques and powers, the precise relationships of torque and power outputs at each joint to walking velocity remain elusive. We proposed that these relationships are fundamental in developing effective training programs aimed at increasing walking velocity in mobility-challenged populations such as older adults. Based on the previously established argument that aging induces asymmetric changes in joint torques and powers, we hypothesized that walking velocity is more strongly related to hip torque and power than ankle torque and power in old adults than young adults. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify the relationships among maximum, sagittal plane hip, knee, and ankle joint torques and powers and walking velocity in young and old, healthy adults in order to identify biomechanical correlates associated with modulating walking velocity. Gait biomechanics were collected using 8 camera 3 D motion capture and force platform systems. Twenty-two young healthy adults and twenty-two old healthy adults each walked at 20 speeds ranging from relatively slow to relatively fast velocities. Maximum sagittal plane joint torques and powers derived through inverse dynamics were correlated to walking velocity (p< 0. 05). The data showed that all peak torques and powers were significantly (p< 0. 05) and directly related to walking velocity. Hip and ankle relations were curvilinear upward and downward; knee were linear. Peak joint torques showed proximal to distal decrease in the strength of their relationships. Peak joint powers were similarly related to walking velocity at each joint. In old adults, torques were most strongly related to walking velocity at the proximal hip (R²= 0. 761) and decreased distally to the ankle (R²= 0. 275); powers were similar to walking velocity across the hip (R²= 0. 467) and the ankle (R²= 0. 445). In young adults, torques were also most strongly related to the walking velocity at the proximal hip (R²= 0. 747) and decreased distally to the ankle (R²= 0. 289); powers were similarly related to walking velocity across the hip (R²= 0. 601) than to the ankle (R²= 0. 528). Overall, mechanical output at the hip was the primary biomechanical correlate of walking velocity, whereas mechanical output at the ankle was most weakly correlated to walking velocity. This pattern of modulating walking velocity is used by both young and old adults similarly. Therefore, the hypothesis was refuted, as aging does not cause a mechanical plasticity in relation to walking <b>velocity.</b> <b>M.</b> <b>S...</b>|$|E

The user effort and wheelchair mechanical efficiency during motion are highly affected by rolling resistance, which is a resistive force depending on many factors such as vehicle speed, tire/floor materials and tire inflation pressure. The study of this force over several conditions could lead to improvements in wheelchair design. The Anatomical Model Propulsion System (AMPS) is a robotic device to test manual wheelchairs with better repeatability than human subjects, helping to identify the effect of resistive forces. It uses electric motors to apply torque directly to the rear wheel handrims. In this thesis, a control system is developed to achieve a specified wheelchair trajectory and velocity profile, by controlling the input torque to the system. A kinetic and dynamic model is used to estimate this necessary input. Data collected from different experiments allows to determine rolling resistance under various conditions. The results show that rolling resistance also varies with acceleration, affecting the overall mechanical efficiency of a wheelchair following different <b>velocity</b> profiles. <b>M.</b> <b>S...</b>|$|R

The elastic material {{consists of a}} polyacrylamide (PAA) gel whose elastic properties can be controlled by modifying the water content of the sample.

In this parameter space, jetting behaviour, jet velocity, bubble migration and bubble oscillation time are determined.

We are sensitive to planets with m_psin(i) >= 1. 5 MEarth (3 MEarth at 2 -sigma) in the classical habitable zone and our observations currently rule out planets with m_psin(i) > 0. 5 MJup at 0. 03 AU for all our targets. A total of 9 of the 15 targets exhibit r. <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> 10 MEarth in 0. 03 AU orbits. Since the mean rotation velocity is of order 8 km/s for an M 6 V star and 15 km/s by M 9 V, we avoid observing only slow rotators that would introduce a bias towards low axial inclination i << 90 deg systems, which are unfavourable for planet detection. Our targets with the highest vsini values exhibit radial velocities significantly above the photon-noise limited precision, even after accounting for vsini.

The earthquake reflects tectonic stresses resulting from the convergence of crustal material slowly moving from the high Tibetan Plateau, to the west, against a strong crust underlying the Sichuan Basin and southeastern China.

Different types of feedback {{were taken into}} account in MAR including drag partitioning caused by surface roughness elements. Model outputs are compared with observations made at two coastal locations, D 17 and D 47, situated respectively 10 and 100 km inland. Wind speed was correctly simulated with positive values of the Nash test (0. 60 for D 17 and 0. 37 for D 47) but wind <b>velocities</b> above 10 <b>m</b> <b>s</b> − 1 were underestimated at both D 17 and D 47; at D 47, the model consistently underestimated wind <b>velocity</b> by 2 <b>m</b> <b>s</b> − 1. Aeolian snow transport events were correctly reproduced with the right timing and a good temporal resolution at both locations except when the maximum particle height was less than 1 m. The threshold friction velocity, evaluated only at D 17 for a 7 -day period without snowfall, was overestimated. The simulated aeolian snow mass fluxes between 0 and 2 m at D 47 displayed the same variations but were underestimated compared to the second-generation FlowCapt ™ values, as was the simulated relative humidity at 2 m above the surface. As a result, MAR underestimated the total aeolian horizontal snow transport for the first 2 m above the ground by a factor of 10 compared to estimations by the second-generation FlowCapt ™.

40|$|International audienceDeposition of {{inertial}} solid particles {{transported by}} turbulent flows is modelled in {{a framework of}} a statistical approach based on the particle velocity Probability Density Function (PDF). The particle-turbulence interaction term is closed in the kinetic equation by a model widely inspired from the famous BGK model of the kinetic theory of rarefied gases. A Gauss-Hermite Lattice Boltzmann model is used to solve the closed kinetic equation involving the turbulence effect. The Lattice Boltzmann model {{is used for the}} case of the deposition of inertial particles transported by a homogeneous isotropic turbulent flows. Even if the carrier phase is homogeneous and isotropic, the presence of the wall coupled with particle-turbulence interactions leads to inhomogeneous particle distribution and non-equilibrium particle fluctuating motion. Despite these complexities the predictions of the Lattice Boltzmann model are in very good accordance with random-walk simulations. More specifically the mean particle <b>velocity,</b> the r. <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> particle <b>velocity</b> and the deposition rate are all well predicted by the proposed Lattice Boltzmann model...|$|R

Given the lack of Ca ii variation with the same period as that found in the RV measurements, the long-lived and coherent nature of these variations, and the high eccentricity of the implied orbit, Keplerian motion due to a planetary companion seems to be the most likely explanation for the observed RV variations. The wide angular separation of the planet from the star (approximately 10) and the long orbital period make this planet a prime candidate for both direct imaging and space-based astrometric measurements...|$|R

The integration technique is used to reproduce the motion of comet C/ 1843 D 1 —the second brightest sungrazer known and presumably the most massive surviving piece of superfragment I—from the motion of C/ 1882 R 1 —the brightest sungrazer on record and arguably the most massive surviving piece of superfragment II. Running the orbit of C/ 1882 R 1 back to a. d. 326, the progenitor comet is found to have split at a heliocentric distance of 50 AU and nearly 30 yr before perihelion.

The centimeter-sized highly porous bodies are produced by random ballistic deposition from individual micrometer-sized dust particles. We find packing densities between 0. 07 and 0. 15 for uncompressed samples, dependent on the shape and size distribution of the constituent dust grains. Impacts into these bodies are simulated by uniaxial compression experiments. We find that themaximum compression, equivalent to the highest protoplanetary impact <b>velocities</b> of 50 <b>m</b> <b>s</b> 1, increases the pack-ing density to 0. 20 – 0. 33. Tensile strength measurements with our laboratory samples yield values in the range 200 – 1100 Pa for slightly compressed samples. We review packing densities and tensile strengths found for primitive solar system bodies, e. g., for comets, primitive meteorites, and meteoroids. We find a consistency between packing densities and tensile strengths of our laboratory samples with those from cometary origin.

40|$|International audienceThe {{generation}} of Hall and field-aligned currents in {{and in the}} vicinity of nighttime mid-latitude sporadic E -layers moving under the action of strong acoustic impulses of seismic, anthropogenic, or meteorological nature is considered in a model presented in this paper. The influence of the electrical polarization fields caused by charges at the horizontal edges of the sporadic layers and the finite conductivity of the external circuits are also taken into account. The theoretical model is applicable for ionospheric altitudes between 95 and 130 km. The estimates show that under certain conditions in a system with two sporadic E -layers, one of which is the current generator and the other is situated in the external circuit, the Farley-Buneman instability could be generated. On the other hand, observations show that Farley-Buneman waves are likely responsible for the infrequent echoes of mid-latitude 50 -MHz backscatter with Doppler <b>velocities</b> near 300 <b>m</b> <b>s</b> ? 1.

LES predictions for six parameter cases were compared to the experimental measurements of Littell & Eaton (1994), obtained at a momentum thickness Reynolds number of 2660. A signaldecomposition scheme was developed by modifying the method of Spalart (1988) to prescribe time-dependent boundary conditions along the radial direction, entrainment towards the disk surface was prescribed by satisfying global mass conservation. Predictions of the mean <b>velocities</b> and r. <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> fluctuations are in good agreement with data, with the largest discrepancy occurring in the prediction of the wall-normal intensities. The primary and two secondary shear stresses are also in good agreement with the measurements and one-dimensional energy spectra of the velocity fluctuations agree well with established laws, i. e. a − 1 slope in the buffer region and − 5 / 3 slope {{near the edge of the}} boundary layer.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a recent study}} of the damage mechanisms generated by high velocity-sand impact on diamond coatings deposited on tungsten substrates by chemical vapour deposition (CVD). The coatings were erosion tested using 90 – 355 -?m diameter sand at a <b>velocity</b> of 268 <b>m</b> <b>s?</b> 1 and the eroded coatings examined by scanning electron and acoustic microscopy. The images indicate that the circumferential cracks and pinholes are the main erosion features and are only located on debonded areas of the coating. This suggests that they could be formed by stress waves reflected from the coating–substrate interface, which interact with surface waves to generate circumferential cracks, the precursor to pinholes. The high spatial resolution of scanning acoustic microscopy enables the resolution of individual pinholes, thus, providing important evidence for identifying the mechanism responsible for the formation of circumferential cracks, the precursor to the pinholes. However, the acoustic images must be interpreted with care; in particular, it is important to compare microstructural features observed by acoustic microscopy with other techniques...|$|R

40|$|The spring {{mass model}} has widely {{been used to}} {{characterize}} the whole body during running and sprinting. However the spring mass characteristics of the world's fastest men are still unknown. Thus {{the aim of this}} study was to model these characteristics for currently the 3 fastest men on earth (Usain Bolt, Tyson Gay and Asafa Powell). This was done by using data collected during the 2009 World championships in Berlin and the modelling method of Morin et al. 21. Even though Bolt achieved the greatest <b>velocity</b> (12. 3 <b>m.</b> <b>s</b> 1) over the 60 - 80 m split compared to his competitors, his estimated vertical stiffness (355. 8 kN. m 1) and leg stiffness (21. 0 kN. m 1) were significantly lower than his competitors. This reduction in stiffness is a consequence of Bolt's longer contact time (0. 091 s) and lower step frequency (4. 49 Hz). Thus Bolt is able to run at a greater velocity but with lower stiffness compared to his competitors. © 2012 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart New York...|$|R
