We also estimated the idealized energy {{for each of the}} three implementations (i. e., we subtract out the energy consumed when the sender is idle) and here, surprisingly, we find that in many instances SACK performs poorly compared to the other two implementations. We conclude that if the mobile device has a very low idle power consumption then SACK is not the best implementation to use for bursty or random loss. On the other hand, if the idle power consumption is significant, then SACK is the best choice since it has the lowest overall energy consumption...|$|E

Usage of clustering concept in hierarchical protocol provides more advantages than any other traditional routing protocols. LEACH and LEACH-C are most commonly used hierarchical routing protocols.

40|$|As {{wireless}} sensor {{networks are}} energy constraint networks so energy efficiency of sensor nodes is the main design issue. Clustering of nodes is an energy efficient approach. It prolongs the lifetime of {{wireless sensor networks}} by avoiding long distance communication. Clustering algorithms operate in rounds. Performance of clustering algorithm depends upon the round time. A large round time consumes more energy of cluster heads while a small round time causes frequent re-clustering. So existing clustering algorithms apply a trade off to round time and calculate it from the initial parameters of networks. But it is not appropriate to use initial parameters based round time value throughout the network lifetime because wireless sensor networks are dynamic in nature (nodes {{can be added to}} the network or some nodes go out of energy). In this paper a <b>variable</b> <b>round</b> time approach is proposed that calculates round time depending upon the number of active nodes remaining in the field. The proposed approach makes the clustering algorithm adaptive to network dynamics. For simulation the approach is implemented with LEACH in NS- 2 and the results show that there is 6 % increase in network lifetime, 7 % increase in 50 % node death time and 5 % improvement over the data units gathered at the base station...|$|E

The budworm site {{model of}} Jones (1979) is a {{complicated}} representation {{of the interaction between}} the spruce budworm and the forests of Northeastern Canada, which describes {{the way in which the}} budworm population undergoes periodic outbreaks, which lead to severe defoliation and widespread tree mortality. We show how this model can be systematically simpli"ed without gainsaying the essential description of the budworm/forest interaction. The main simpli"cation is the collapse of the year to year age structure to allow for three classes of young, mature, and old trees; we then obtain a reduced set of six di!erence equations for the six variables: larval population, new and old foliage, and the three age classes. Further analysis and reduction of the model is then possible on the basis of formal asymptotic limits, and we analyse a reduced model consisting of three di!erence equations for larvae, (old) foliage, and the area fraction of mature trees. In practice, the latter variable is inessential to the mechanism of oscillation, which can be understood via the slow cycling of the foliage <b>variable</b> <b>round</b> a hysteresis loop of quasi-steady states, mediated by the varying larval population as control parameter.

40|$|We {{study in}} this paper the {{performance}} of a single persis-tent TCP connection, which experiences packet loss oc-curring in clumps. More precisely, the transmission of packets is altered by several packet losses during some time periods, which can span over several round trip time intervals. In spite of multiple packet loss, we assume that TCP remains in the congestion avoidance regime. We perform, by properly rescaling time, an exact anal-ysis of the behavior of TCP when the loss rate becomes arbitrarily small. In particular, we investigate by means of elementary q-calculus the stationary distribution of the congestion window size embedded at the finishing times of loss periods. This allows us to exactly compute the mean throughput of the TCP connection. Then, by us-ing stochastic ordering arguments, we investigate the im-pact of correlations on the mean throughput. Surprisingly, for a same loss rate, the mean throughput in the case of correlated losses is greater than that obtained under inde-pendent loss conditions. We conclude the paper by dis-cussing how the results could be extended to account for additional features of TCP. In particular, we show that the slow start algorithm and <b>variable</b> <b>round</b> trip times have no impact on the asymptotic results of this paper.

WSU users can access the article via IEEE Xplore database licensed by University Libraries: [URL] based broadband networks are gaining importance due to their distance insensitivity and high bandwidth availability. Although it is possible to transmit Internet traffic through satellite network, it has been observed that many of the IP related protocols (especially transmission control protocol) do not perform well in the satellite environment due to the high latency and <b>variable</b> <b>round</b> trip time (RTT) offered by the satellite network. Some of the researchers have suggested using performance enhancement proxies (PEP) at strategic locations to improve the transmission control protocol (TCP) performance over the satellite network. However usage of end-to-end security mechanism like IPSec affects the PEP's functioning as the encryption mechanisms generally hide the TCP header information along with the data from intermediate nodes. While other approaches suggest either establishing multiple security associations or sacrificing end-to-end security by using less secure mechanisms like secure shell (SSL) or transport layer security (TLS), the authors of this paper propose a simpler solution for PEP and end-to-end security coexistence. The proposed solution achieves the coexistence of PEP and end-to-end security with minimal overhead as compared to the solutions proposed by other researchers.

40|$|Recently, {{wireless}} sensor {{networks have}} {{become one of the}} most exciting areas for research and development. However, sensor nodes are battery operated, thus the sensor¿s ability to perform its assigned tasks is limited by its battery capacity; therefore, energy efficiency is considered to be a key issue in designing WSN applications. Clustering has emerged as a useful mechanism for trade-off between certain design goal conflicts; the network life time, and the amount of data obtained. However, different sources of energy waste still exist. Furthermore, in such dynamic environments, different data rate requirements emerge due to the current network status, thus adapting a response to the changing network is essential, rather than following the same principle during the network¿s lifespan. This thesis presents dynamic techniques to adapt to network changes, through which the limited critical energy source can be wisely managed so that the WSN application can achieve its intended design goals. Two approaches have been taken to decreasing the energy use. The first approach is to develop two dynamic round time controllers, called the minimum round time controller MIN-RC and the <b>variable</b> <b>round</b> time controller VAR-RC, whereas the second approach improves intra-cluster communication using a Co-Cluster head; both approaches show better energy utilisation compared to traditional protocols. A third approach has been to develop a general hybrid protocol H-RC that can adapt different applications requirements; it can also tolerate different data rate requirements for the same application during the system¿s lifetime...|$|E
