40|$|Electron beam curing of {{composites}} is a non-autoclave process, and consolidation pressure during cure has therefore {{been limited}} to that which may be provided by vacuum bagging the part, or by the application of direct mechanical force. Tooling to apply mechanical force tends {{to be limited to}} simple geometric shapes and may also block (shadow) the electron beam’s path to the composite. Vacuum bagging is readily adapted to most complex three-dimensional parts but the applied consolidation is limited to roughly atmospheric pressure and therefore cannot be relied on to collapse the expansion of volatiles during cure of the electron beam cured laminate. Preventive measures are therefore needed to reduce the factors that cause voids. A critical opportunity to reduce voids in the cured laminate is to minimize air entrapment between plies during lay-up. This paper reports the results of process trials conducted with IM 7 -GP- 12 K/ 3 K and IM 7 -GP- 12 K/ 8 HM unidirectional prepreg tapes to evaluate <b>vacuum</b> <b>debulking</b> and other parameters on the reduction of voids in electron beam cured laminates...|$|E
40|$|In the {{aviation}} industry, manufacturers {{made the transition}} from aluminum to composite materials {{for the majority of}} their primary structures over the last few decades. While the design and manufacturing techniques have consistently evolved, field repair methods were consistently overlooked. In this study, specimens fabricated using some of the common repair methods such as the autoclave repair method, and Double <b>Vacuum</b> <b>Debulk</b> (DVD) repair method were tested against the Composite Aircraft Field Repair Method (CAFRM) proposed by the researcher. Specimens were tested with microscopy, acid digestion, short beam shear, and mode I fracture tests. The researcher was able to determine the specimen 2 ̆ 7 s void content, fiber volume fraction, shear strength, and opening mode interlaminar fracture toughness for the specimens fabricated using the different repair methods. The specimens fabricated using the autoclave repair method, DVD repair method, and CAFRM showed significant differences in void content, shear strength, and opening mode interlaminar fracture toughness. However, {{there were no significant differences}} between the specimens for fiber volume fraction. ...|$|R
25|$|PTFE film is also {{widely used}} in the {{production}} of carbon fiber composites as well as fiberglass composites, notably in the aerospace industry. PTFE film is used as a barrier between the carbon or fiberglass part being built, and breather and bagging materials used to incapsulate the bondment when <b>debulking</b> (<b>vacuum</b> removal of air from between layers of laid-up plies of material) and when curing the composite, usually in an autoclave. The PTFE, used here as a film, prevents the non-production materials from sticking to the part being built, which is sticky due to the carbon-graphite or fiberglass plies being pre-pregnated with bismaleimide resin. Non-production materials such as Teflon, Airweave Breather and the bag itself would be considered F.O.D. (foreign object debris/damage) if left in layup.|$|R
40|$|Automated fiber {{placement}} allows precision {{fabrication of}} complex composite structures, but significant thickness reduction may occur during cure {{due to the}} presence of voids and excess resin in fiber placed parts. Zero-bleed toughened epoxy resin systems required for many aerospace applications (including Cytec 977 or Hexcel 8552) are particularly difficult to <b>debulk,</b> and hot <b>vacuum</b> bag <b>debulking</b> or interim autoclave processing are widely used with these materials to avoid fiber wrinkling (marcelling). Foster-Miller’s Ultrasonic Tape Lamination (UTL) is a highly effective debulking method, capable of providing net thickness as-placed parts. UTL induces virtually instantaneous viscoelastic and frictional heating and intra-ply nesting. In-situ debulking and controlled staging of thermoset prepreg can be achieved through the use of closed loop temperature control and advanced process modeling. Used in conjunction with E Beam curing or novel thermal techniques, such as solid state postcure, UTL provides an avenue for out-of-autoclave curing of high quality fiber placed structures. This approach offers the possibility of out-of-autoclave processing without the development and qualification of new resin formulations. This paper covers the development of UTL for in-situ debulking and staging. It also includes a discussion of viscoelastic materials characterization and process modeling for carbon fiber/Hexcel 8552 thermoset prepreg...|$|R
