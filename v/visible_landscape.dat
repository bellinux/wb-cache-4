6000|$|... 184. Passing {{over the}} suburb, then, {{we have to}} {{distinguish}} between the simple blue country, which is composed only of rich cultivated champaign, relieved in parts by low undulations, monotonous and uninteresting as a whole, though cheerful in its character, and beautiful in details of lanes and meadow paths; and the picturesque blue country, lying at the foot of high hill ranges, intersected by their outworks, broken here and there into bits of crag and dingle scenery; perpetually presenting prospects of exquisite distant beauty, and possessing in its valley and river scenery, fine detached specimens of the natural [...] "green country." [...] This distinction we did not make in speaking of the cottage; the effect of which, owing to its size, can extend only over a limited space; and this space, if in picturesque blue country, must be either part of its monotonous cultivation, when it is to be considered as belonging to the simple blue country, or part of its dingle scenery, when it becomes green country; and it would not be just, to suit a cottage, actually placed in one color, to the general effect of another color, with which it could have nothing to do. But the effect of the villa extends very often over a considerable space, and becomes part of the large features of the district; so that the whole character and expression of the <b>visible</b> <b>landscape</b> must be considered, and thus the distinction between the two kinds of blue country becomes absolutely necessary. Of the first, or simple, we have already adduced, as an example, the greater part of the South of England. Of the second, or picturesque, the cultivated parts of the North and East Ridings of Yorkshire, generally Shropshire, and the north of Lancashire, and Cumberland, beyond Caldbeck Fells, are good examples; perhaps better than all, the country for twelve miles north, and thirty south, east, and west, of Stirling.|$|E

A first description was penned by the schoolteacher J.A. Buchner (1776-1854) in 1831, under the erroneous assumption of having found the Roman site of Vallatum. First excavations took place in 1892-93 under Joseph Fink (1859-1929). In 1903, Paul Reinecke recognised the site as a Celtic oppidum.|$|E
50|$|As {{shown in}} the diagram, a weak plate under {{compression}} generally forms thrusting sheets, or overlapping sliding sections. This can form a hill and valley landform, with the hills being the strong sections, and the valleys being the highly disturbed thrust faulted and folded sections.

The valley rock is very weak and usually highly weathered, presenting deep, fertile soil; naturally, this is the area that becomes populated.

A number of factors influenced the decision to cover over Pogue's Run, including the economic and human costs from decades of violent flooding, public health risks from diseases, and the stream's unsightly and unpleasant smell due to years of sewage and industrial pollution. The sewering of Pogue's Run also paved the way for railroad track elevations, which alleviated congestion on Indianapolis' ever busier roads.|$|E

40|$|The rapid {{developments}} of economy and urbanization bring great pressure to natural environment and resources, which contribute big challenge to {{sustainable urban development}} in high-density urban areas like Hong Kong, China and many other Eastern Asia cities. In these areas, protecting natural landscape resources and enhancing visibility to urban spaces and residential zones has become significant in improving the livability of human settlement. This paper presents a new approach in assessing the visual quality in high-density urban environment. The principal methodology is to quantitatively integrate human visual perception parameters with the <b>visible</b> <b>landscape</b> resources'characteristics. GIS is employed as the database and technical platform. A residential development in Hong Kong {{was used as a}} case study. The approach provides decision making support to urban planning, site layout design, and estate management during the early stage of the schematic design/planning process...|$|E
30|$|In {{the absence}} of any {{realistic}} guidance on the level of “invisible” radioactive contamination, the virtual viewer may be forced to rely on visual cues in the environment as proxies for high radioactivity. Spatiotemporal instability (Curtis et al. 2013) in the Fukushima GSV dataset makes this problematic, however. Signs and barriers at the entrances to highly contaminated areas may suddenly (re)appear or disappear as one transitions without warning from a set of photographs taken at one point in time to imagery of the same place shot months or years later, and other features may disappear completely as images are updated and replaced with newer ones. Inconsistencies in the dates at which adjacent photographs were taken cause waste piles to move, increase in size or disappear altogether as one moves through the map. These inconsistencies remind us that the <b>visible</b> <b>landscape</b> is a volatile product of the map producers’ methodology (Perkins 2014).|$|E

40|$|A White Paper to the NRC Decadal Survey Inner Planets Sub-Panel 1 OVERVIEW. Remote sensing by Earth-based and {{orbiting}} instruments {{has provided}} {{a wealth of information}} on the geologic and climate history of Mars that bears directly on the question of past and current habitability. Recent experience with radar imaging and sounding of the Moon, terrestrial arid regions and glaciers, and volcanic, sedimentary, and polar layered deposits of Mars shows that {{a significant part of the}} geologic record is recorded in features buried by mantling debris, layering due to ice property variations, and in the physical nature of deposits formed by volcanism, sedimentation, or impact. Global information on martian near-surface features and physical properties represents a great untapped aspect of the search for habitable zones and evidence of past climate. Imaging radar measurements at wavelengths of 30 - 60 cm can penetrate several meters of mantling material and 10 ’s of meters into ice, and a highly capable synthetic aperture radar (SAR) instrument is well within the scope of a Discovery or Scout-class mission.

40|$|International audienceMapping {{landscape}} visibility {{to reveal}} {{and measure the}} visual interactions between places within a territory is common practice today, especially {{in the context of}} visual impact studies. Maps of landscape visibility are also a powerful aid to considering development options and anticipating the future for territories that face a variety of challenges. On coasts, where landscape and views form part of the territorial resources, spatial planning particularly requires awareness of the visual properties of the space. Because of their attractiveness for residential and other types of development, coastal areas present management issues that often have a visual landscape dimension. This article proposes a method of characterizing the visual potential of coastal municipalities in the south of France, with a view to promoting consideration of landscape views in spatial planning. Developed in a GIS environment, this method defines the extent of the potentially <b>visible</b> <b>landscape</b> as well as the different landscape components of a municipality, which can then be compared to spatial planning data. Discussion of our results with stakeholders involved in local development revealed a positive perception and suggest that the approach could be extended to other coastal areas subject to urban pressure...|$|E
40|$|According to the European Landscape Convention (ELC, 2000) {{and the new}} Italian Code for Heritage and Landscape (2008), the {{valorisation}} of {{the landscape}} is a central issue for territorial policies and projects. An experimentation of the guidelines of the ELC and the Italian Code is research in the Turin Province developed with many institutional, economic and social actors, aimed at promoting awareness of territorial values and identifying policies, programmes and projects. The research leads to the formulation of valorisation and development projects {{in a number of}} areas of the Turin Province in the Piemonte Region (Italy), concluding with a 'Manifesto' for the landscape and local rural development aimed at defining guidelines for policies and planning. The Manifesto proposes a functional, social, economic and symbolic link between the town and the countryside as a territorial system, ready to share values and resources. This implies an agreement on the natural and social cohesion of the town and the countryside. This agreement is geared towards regulating the overall system in an innovative way, affecting not only the <b>visible</b> <b>landscape,</b> but also the inhabitable and liveable landscapes.
