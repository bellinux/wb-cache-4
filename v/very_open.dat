5|$|In January 1995 Hordern {{was invited}} {{back to his}} old college in Brighton, where a room was named in his honour. Inside, the college had {{commissioned}} the sculptor Peter Webster to create a bronze bust of the actor which is displayed with a plaque. Hordern's last physical acting role came shortly afterwards as Lord Langland in the comedy film A <b>Very</b> <b>Open</b> Prison. This was followed by two narration performances, firstly in Spode A History of Excellence, {{and then in the}} five-part film Dinosaurs and Their Living Relatives.|$|E
5|$|With {{the release}} of the fourth edition, Wizards of the Coast {{introduced}} its Game System License, which represented a significant restriction compared to the <b>very</b> <b>open</b> policies embodied by the OGL. In part as a response to this, some publishers (such as Paizo Publishing with its Pathfinder Roleplaying Game) who previously produced materials in support of the D product line, decided to continue supporting the 3rd Edition rules, thereby competing directly with Wizards of the Coast. Others, such as Kenzer & Company, are returning to the practice of publishing unlicensed supplements and arguing that copyright law does not allow Wizards of the Coast to restrict third-party usage.|$|E

5|$|The masked shrike's {{preferred}} {{habitat is}} open woodland with bushes and some large trees. It is less conspicuous than its relatives, avoiding <b>very</b> <b>open</b> country and often perching in less exposed locations. The nest is a neat cup {{built in a}} tree by both adults, and the clutch is normally 4–6 eggs, which are incubated by the female for 14–16 days until hatching. The chicks are fed by both parents until they fledge 18–20days later, and remain dependent on the adults for about 3–4 weeks after leaving the nest. The masked shrike eats mainly large insects, occasionally small vertebrates; it sometimes impales its prey on thorns or barbed wire. Populations are decreasing {{in parts of the}} European range, but not rapidly enough to raise serious conservation concerns, and the species is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern.|$|E

25|$|Stiff polymer geogrids, with <b>very</b> <b>open</b> apertures, in {{addition}} to three-dimensional geocells made from various polymers are also increasingly specified in unpaved and paved roadways, load platforms and railway ballast, where the improved loadbearing characteristics significantly reduce the requirements for high quality, imported aggregate fills, thus reducing the carbon footprint of the construction.|$|E
25|$|Although not a <b>very</b> <b>open</b> man and {{a rather}} secluded personality, he already {{achieved}} cult status during his life.

25|$|Geogrids {{represent}} {{a rapidly growing}} segment within geosynthetics. Rather than being a woven, nonwoven or knitted textile fabric, geogrids are polymers formed into a <b>very</b> <b>open,</b> gridlike configuration, i.e., they have large apertures between individual ribs in the transverse and longitudinal directions. Geogrids are (a) either stretched in one, two or three directions for improved physical properties, (b) made on weaving or knitting machinery by standard textile manufacturing methods, or (c) by laser or ultrasonically bonding rods or straps together. There are many specific application areas; however, geogrids function almost exclusively as reinforcement materials.|$|E
25|$|The {{historical}} {{growth of}} Canada's population {{is complex and}} has been influenced in many different ways, such as indigenous populations, expansion of territory, and human migration. Being a new world country, Canada has been predisposed to be a <b>very</b> <b>open</b> society with regards to immigration, {{which has been the}} most important factor in its historical population growth. Canadians comprise about 0.5% of the world's total population, The 2016 Canadian census counted a total population of 35,151,728, an increase of around 5.0 percent over the 2011 figure. Between 1990 and 2008, the population increased by 5.6 million, equivalent to 20.4 percent overall growth.|$|E

25|$|The town of Pau {{is marked}} by a strong {{cultural}} identity, with the presence of a French-Occitan bilingual school (calandreta Paulina) (90 students) in Pau and one in the metropolitan area in Lescar (60 students), by a living practice of Béarnese and the success of the Occitan cultural groups. The city has, however, received foreign influences of major importance (English, Spanish, Russian, Brazilian) and remains <b>very</b> <b>open</b> to the outside with a high English student community, along with the presence of Dutch, Portuguese, Spaniards and Moroccans. Near Dax, Bayonne and Biarritz, the Pau people have a love of city ferias. The bandas, bodegas (drinking places with typical animation) and Béarnese singing groups are numerous including Nadau, Lo Cèu de Pau and Balaguera. Since 2005, the city hosts the festival Hestiv'oc which is the grand festival of Occitania. The University of Pau, Université de Pau et des Pays de l'Adour, also often hosts concerts and cultural events.|$|E
25|$|Sima {{himself in}} the {{conclusion}} to chapter 110 of the Shiji declared {{that he was a}} writing in this tradition where he stated:“When Confucius wrote the Spring and Autumn Annals, he was <b>very</b> <b>open</b> in treating the reigns of Yin and Huan, the early dukes of Lu; but {{when he came to the}} later period of Dukes Ding and Ai, his writing was much more covert. Because in the latter case he was writing about his own times, he did not express his judgements frankly, but used subtle and guarded language.” Bearing this in mind, not everything that Sima wrote should be understood as conveying didactical moral lessons. But several historians have suggested that parts of the Shiji, such as where Sima placed his section on Confucius’s use of indirect criticism in the part of the book dealing with the Xiongnu “barbarians” might indicate his disapproval of the foreign policy of the Emperor Wu.|$|E
25|$|In 246, Zhu Ju was {{promoted}} to General of Agile Cavalry (驃騎將軍). Three years later, he was appointed as the Imperial Chancellor (丞相) {{in addition to his}} role as General of Agile Cavalry. Around the time, there was a rivalry between two of Sun Quan's sons – Sun He, the Crown Prince, and Sun Ba, the Prince of Lu – over the succession to their father's throne. Zhu Ju was <b>very</b> <b>open</b> and vocal in pledging his support to Sun He, whom he deemed the legitimate heir apparent. In 250, Sun Quan forced Sun Ba to commit suicide and put Sun He under house arrest with the intention of deposing him later. When Zhu Ju, Qu Huang (屈晃) and others heard about it, they covered their heads in mud, tied themselves up, and came to beg Sun Quan to release Sun He. When Sun Quan saw them, he felt angry and scolded them for creating a disturbance. After Zhu Ju and Qu Huang repeatedly pressured Sun Quan to spare Sun He, the emperor got fed up with them and ordered them to be flogged 100 times. Qu Huang was later removed from office and sent back to his hometown, while Zhu Ju was demoted to the position of an assistant official in Xindu Commandery (新都郡; around present-day Chun'an County, Zhejiang). While Zhu Ju was en route to Xindu, Sun Hong (孫弘), a supporter of Sun Ba, spoke ill of Zhu Ju in front of Sun Quan. At the time, as Sun Quan was sick, Sun Hong took advantage of the situation to forge an imperial decree in Sun Quan's name ordering Zhu Ju to commit suicide. Zhu Ju thought that the decree was genuine so he took his own life as ordered. He was 57 (by East Asian age reckoning) when he died.|$|E

500|$|Banjo-Kazooie is a single-player {{platform}} {{game where}} the player controls the protagonists Banjo and Kazooie from a third-person perspective. The game is split into nine levels where the player must gather musical notes and jigsaw pieces, called [...] "Jiggies", to progress. Players transit from one level to another through Gruntilda's lair, which {{acts as the}} game's central overworld. Jiggies allow the player to complete jigsaw puzzles which open doors to new levels, while musical notes grant players access to new inner sections of the overworld. Like in Super Mario 64, the gameplay of Banjo-Kazooie is <b>very</b> <b>open</b> and allows the player to collect Jiggies and musical notes in a nonlinear order. It is also possible to skip certain levels {{as long as the}} player has enough of these items to reach a farther one.|$|E
