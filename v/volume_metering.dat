40|$|To meet {{stringent}} {{control and}} emissions requirements, diesel fuel injectors {{need to be}} characterised accurately in terms of timing and rate of change of mass flow rate. Such characterisation is carried out with various rate metering devices which overwhelmingly utilise a liquid into liquid injection process. These devices have historically been hampered by unwanted 'noise' in the measurement signal whose source was poorly understood and mitigation relied on post processing filtering techniques. A model of a constant <b>volume</b> <b>metering</b> device with optical access was constructed and a hybrid schlieren laser imaging technique applied to the flow field external to the nozzle with simultaneous chamber pressure measurement. This technique is sensitive to the second derivative of density and so directly able to visualise pressure waves within the domain. LES simulations were also performed to extract relationships not available through experimental data. The experimental results show cloud cavitation in the shear layer of the jet whose vapour bubbles begin collapsing shortly after injection begins and persist more than 500 microseconds {{after the end of}} injection. Compression waves due to the collapse of cavitation bubbles are visualised directly and parameters such as their spatial origin and time are calculated. Compression wave diffraction, reflections and interaction between individual jets are demonstrated. The 'noise' in a constant volume chamber is therefore shown to actually be an accurate representation of the pressure field arising from the superposition of complex flow phenomena in the near field of the injector nozzle due to an interaction of pressure waves and cavitation. The novel use of a hybrid schlieren technique demonstrates the utility of this arrangement to fully three dimensional problems. Cavitation and its associated processes are shown to be the dominating force in liquid to liquid injection processes for the flows encountered in fuel injection metering. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, {{there have}} been two {{separate}} telecommunications networks, one based on switches, the other based on routers. The switched network basically carried voice. The packet switched network basically carried data. Now voice is about to go packet switched too. Ultimately, both networks might merge. If that were to happen, the governance structure of either of these networks would have to change fundamentally. Currently, a large amount of packet switched traffic goes over the public Internet. The Internet is organised as a club good. There is an access fee, but no further fee for its actual use. <b>Volume</b> <b>metering</b> is technically feasible, but typically only bandwidth is controlled. In the switched network, a split price is standard. There is an access fee, plus a separate fee for each call. In a club good, by definition each side pays for part of the traffic. On the Internet, the receiver pays principle is thus applied. In most countries, the switched network is governed by the caller pays principle. Under that principle, there are termination charges. Each operator has a local monopoly over its customers. There is thus the possibility that telephony will in the future be controlled by the same principles. Actually, in that case the only remaining property right would be access to the network. In the opposite case, data traffic might be contaminated by the principles currently governing switched telephony. This would presuppose that operators succeed in introducing artificial property rights for the relationship with their customers, maybe even for the individual instance of communication. Technically, there are two main opportunities for this. In switched telephony, for technical reasons it is natural to give out telephone numbers to operators, not to clients. Through these numbers, they control their customers. Voice over IP operators try to implement the same scheme for packet switched voice traffic, although here the domain name system would be natural. Domains are accorded to end users, not to operators. A second conduit for artificially introducing property rights is technical standards. They are needed for defining addressees, for the management of real-time interaction, and for the digital coding of voice signals. By way of proprietary standards, the operator gains full control. Competition policy should not only see at the establishment of these fundamental governance structures. It should also check the potential for distorting systems competition between switched and packet switched telephony. Incumbents are having a host of potential strategies for creating new barriers to entry, and for distorting actual competition. Most critical are bundling strategies. Diagonally integrated incumbents might offer their clients to carry their traffic over IP where possible, and through their traditional network otherwise. That way they could turn their customer base in the traditional networks into a barrier to entry. Currently, this strategy can fully work for mobile telephony. In fixed telephony it is more difficult to implement as long as IP addressees are not earmarked. property right, club good, network externality, monopolistic competition, systems competition, packet switched telephony, network access, E. 164 numbers vs. IP addresses, caller pays principle vs. receiver pays principle, sip, codecs...|$|E
