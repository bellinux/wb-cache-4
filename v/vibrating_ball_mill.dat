In this study, in order to grind and activate Li, the mechanical milling of Li with stable metal oxide, namely, Al 2 O 3 and MgO, using a high energy <b>vibrating</b> <b>ball</b> <b>mill</b> was performed. In the case of Li-MgO system, it reacts with N 2, but hardly reacts with O 2. The reaction with N 2 generally produces Li 3 N, while for some vigorous reactions the Mg 3 N 2 and Li 2 O are produced as the major phases. In the case of Li-Al 2 O 3 system, however, reactivities with both N 2 and O 2 are high. The difference will be explained in terms of the reaction mechanism and the Li state...|$|E

The adsorbents were characterized by nitrogen adsorption, size measurement, mercury porosimetry and scanning electron microscopy. Inverse gas chromatography at infinite dilution and finite concentration was also implemented to determine surface properties of the four samples, in particular the irreversibility indexes, a measurement of high-energy sites. In a second part, batch adsorption experiments were carried out to study the effect of mechanical and chemical treatments on lead adsorption properties of the powder. The isotherm analysis indicated that the Langmuir model could represent the adsorption data. The sample ground in Pulverisette 0 presented the highest cationic exchange capacity {{and led to the}} highest adsorption capacity despite the relatively low specific surface area and the complete destruction of the fibrous morphology of the raw powder. A correlation was shown between the cationic exchange capacity and irreversibility indexes obtained with isopropanol. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Increase in the COz {{concentration}} in atmosphere {{due to the}} combustion of fossil fuels has caused serious global warming. In dealing with this issue, the absorption of COz into EAF steelmaking slag was experimentally studied by the utilization of mechanical grinding method. The final objective {{of this research is}} to develop a new mineral carbonation process that has a high efficiency in the capture and storage of C 02 with low energy consumption {{and at the same time}} has some value added features that leads to the feasibility of the overall carbonation system. In the first stage of this study, the absorption behavior of C 02 into metal powders and CaO contained material was studied by dry grinding in a centrifugal ball mill. It was found that COz was not decomposed during the grinding, but the sorption of it occurred on the ground sample. In both cases of CaO and waste concrete, formation of CaC 03 was confirmed. While, in the case of metal powders, the COz absorption into ground powders was firstly occurred, thereafter, it decomposed to form metal oxides and carbon. COz sorption into the samples depended on the newly exposed surface area that was formed by grinding. It was found that the newly exposed surface area increased linearly with the increase in the grinding time. However, the dry grinding resulted to the agglomeration of particles in the latter stage of grinding. The agglomeration of particles has then led to the limitation of the COz absorption. In the next stage, the behavior of C 02 absorption into EAF normal and stainless steel reducing slag was investigated with wet grinding method. The slag was wet ground under COz atmosphere by a <b>vibrating</b> <b>ball</b> <b>mill</b> which has larger capacity than the centrifugal ball mill. The amount and the initial rate of C 02 absorption for the wet grinding were higher than those for the dry grinding. The optimum ratio of fillings to vessel's volume was found to be aboct 112. C 02 was stored into the slag mainly as CaC 03 and EO desorption of C 02 was observed. Thus, this indicates that the C 02 can be stored permanently inside the slag with this method. This study also revealed that the increase in the interfacial area between COz and the slurry of water and slag was necessary to enhance COz absorption. It was found that the absorption capacity of C 02 into the normal and stainless steel reducing slag using this method on the most optimum grinding condition was 0. 21 and 0. 3 1 kg CO~lkgsl ag respectively. To profoundly investigate the mechanism of COz absorption, study on the absorption behavior of C 02 into EAF normal and stainless steel oxidizing slag with wet grinding method was also conducted. The results showed that the conversion ratio of CaO to CaC 03 was not solely affected by the CaO content in the slag, but by the CaO/A 1203 ratio in the slag. The conversion ratio linearly increased with the increase in the Ca 01 A 1203 ratio. The rate of CO 2 absorption in the slag with wet grinding method was highly depended on the dissolution behavior of ca 2 + ion from the slag into water and the interfacial area between the COz gas and water. The rate increased with the increase in the both factors. The dissolution behavior of 2 +. Ca d. ~ fferedb etween each slags depended on the main phases reaction in the slag. Thus, the main phases in each slags affected the overall reaction of the C 02 absorption. The 2 Ca 0. A 1203. Si 02 was found to hinder the absorption of CO 2 into the slag. While CaO. Si 02 and 2 Ca 0. Si 02 phases in the slag were favorable for the CO 2 absorption. It was found that the absorption quantity of CO 2 into the stainless steel oxidizing slag with low A 1203 content on the most optimum grinding condition was about 0. 26 kg CO&g slag. Comparison between the amount of C 02 absorption in this study and the amount of CO 2 emitted from various power plants, which was estimated by the energy consumption of the vibrating mill, revealed that the former was not always higher than the latter. Reduction amount of 1 % from overall C 02 emission from steel industry can be expected by this method. Use of other possible materials will lead to the increase in the potential reduction amount. The overall cost for the system is expected to be very low and this also indicates that this method is economically feasible. Along with the absorption of C 02, Zn could be removed by using this method with high removal ratio. The dissolutions of Cr were low for all conditions and the pH of the sluny were within the environmental quality standard. It was also found that even though the mortar made from the ground carbonated slag can't be used to concrete, however, it can still be used as normal mortar...|$|E

30|$|The {{storage of}} spent maitake culture medium (SMCM) under various {{conditions}} was investigated as a potential pretreatment of SMCM for increased ethanol conversion. When SMCM was stored at 25 °C for 12  weeks, the glucose yield by enzymatic saccharification increased from 22 to 52 %. Selective degradation of lignin and hemicellulose occurred in SMCM during storage. The optimal storage temperature of SMCM was at the active growing temperature of maitake mycelium, which is between 25 and 30 °C. Storage of SMCM under anaerobic conditions did not increase the glucose yield compared to non-stored conditions. The glucose yield from the SMCM stored for 4  weeks at 25 °C was increased by about 30 % with either NaOH or <b>vibrating</b> <b>ball</b> <b>milling</b> pretreatment. After 12  weeks of storage, the glucose yield from SMCM without any other pretreatment was {{higher than that of}} non-stored SMCM with additional pretreatments. An ethanol yield of 42.1 % was obtained from SMCM stored for 12  weeks by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation, which was comparable to yields after NaOH (41.3 %) or <b>vibrating</b> <b>ball</b> <b>milling</b> (44.1 %) pretreatments. Therefore, storage of SMCM is a very useful pretreatment for bioethanol production.|$|R

30|$|The spent {{culture medium}} (SCM) of {{mushrooms}} {{can be regarded}} as the medium in which mushroom mycelium has already been grown. Since the lignin of SCM has been attacked by mushroom mycelium during cultivation, SCM is considered to have undergone biological pretreatment. For example, Lee et al. [15] evaluated waste logs of Lentinus edodes as a better material for bioethanol production compared to native logs. However, our previous study indicated that the influence of mycelial growth in the SCM was limited, i.e. only ~ 25 % of glucose yield was obtained from SMCM by enzymatic saccharification after cultivation. Therefore, we have studied several pretreatments for ethanol production from SMCM, and found that NaOH pretreatment [3, 4, 6] or <b>vibrating</b> <b>ball</b> <b>milling</b> [4] were suitable pretreatments of SMCM. In addition, SMCM, which is the waste after maitake cultivation, was more susceptible to these pretreatments than beech wood [3, 6]. Similar results have been reported by Hideno et al. [16].|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, {{we found}} the storage effect of SMCM {{which is one of}} the {{biological}} pretreatments by maitake mycelia that have already grown in SMCM. The glucose yield from SMCM became 2.4 – 16.8 times higher after 12  weeks of storage at 25 °C than the yield from the non-stored SMCM. The storage effect of SMCM was comparable pretreatment to NaOH or <b>vibrating</b> <b>ball</b> <b>milling</b> pretreatment for the ethanol conversion. These results suggest that SMCM is a very useful biomass resource; complex pretreatments for sugar and bioethanol production are unnecessary. Furthermore, because the storage does not require any complex equipment or chemicals, it is amenable to scaling up to industrial levels, and ethanol production cost should decrease. However, there are some limitations such as a storage space and storage time, and ethanol yields may still be low for practical applications. To solve the problems, it is necessary to enhance the storage effect of SMCM. Controlling ligninolytic enzyme activities during the storage might be a key to improve saccharification of SMCM. Therefore, our current research is focused on understanding the role of ligninolytic enzymes during the storage.|$|R

30|$|Here, {{we report}} an {{improved}} <b>ball</b> <b>milling</b> and annealing method for BNNT synthesis, which shows a better BNNT yield {{compared to the}} original <b>ball</b> <b>milling</b> method {{as well as the}} B ink method. The method involves <b>ball</b> <b>milling</b> of metal nitrate with B powder, and the subsequent thermal annealing of the milled powder in nitrogen-containing gases grows a high density of BNNTs.|$|R

2500|$|Usually {{the metal}} acetate and the organic proligand are mixed and ground {{up with a}} <b>ball</b> <b>mill.</b> Cu3(BTC)2 can be quickly {{synthesised}} in this way in quantitative yield. In the case of Cu3(BTC)2 the morphology of the solvent free synthesised product {{was the same as}} the industrially made Basolite C300. It is thought that localised melting of the components due to the high collision energy in the <b>ball</b> <b>mill</b> may assist the reaction. The formation of acetic acid as a by-product in the reactions in the <b>ball</b> <b>mill</b> may also help in the reaction having a solvent effect in the <b>ball</b> <b>mill.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} lay raw {{materials}} foundation {{for increasing the}} performance of insulating brick with the low grade quartz sand along the Yangtze River, the effect of <b>ball</b> <b>milling</b> time on the properties of quartz sand powder was researched via the <b>ball</b> <b>milling</b> method in this paper. The results show the grain diameter of quartz sand powder is gradually decreased, the grain fineness distribution is tapered narrowing. The liquidity of quartz sand powders is became poor with an increaseding the <b>ball</b> <b>milling</b> rotate speed, howerver, the tendency of variation is gradually relaxative. The vibration compaction density is decreased with an increaseding the <b>ball</b> <b>milling</b> rotate speed, but the fall amplitude difference is gradually shrinked. The <b>ball</b> <b>milling</b> rotate speed for 250 r/min is better through the whole cost performance analysis...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{experimental}} investigation of vibrations of a <b>ball</b> <b>mill</b> under variable load. The common causes of vibrations of the <b>ball</b> <b>mill</b> are described in short. The exciting frequencies at which the possible causes of vibration can be recognised are estimated for all principle parts of the <b>ball</b> <b>mill.</b> After that the measurement of accelerations of vibration at housings of bearings has been performed. Due to the production requirements {{the capacity of the}} <b>ball</b> <b>mill</b> is variable and therefore the torque on the <b>ball</b> <b>mill</b> drive is also variable. Measurement has been done for two different capacities. Vibration signatures have shown different vibration levels at different loads. It has been noticed that vibration amplitudes at the same frequencies decrease with increase of load of the mill...|$|R
40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the {{temperature}} stability of resistance below the switching temperature of {{positive temperature coefficient resistor}} (PTCR) ceramics. The BaTiO 3 based PTCR powders were grinded by conventional <b>ball</b> <b>milling</b> and high-energy <b>ball</b> <b>milling.</b> Particle size distribution analysis showed that high-energy <b>ball</b> <b>milling</b> was much more efficient for particle size reduction. It was found that the PTCR ceramic with 3000 rpm for 1 h high-energy <b>ball</b> <b>milling</b> has uniform grain size distribution. The measurement results of the resistance-temperature characteristics of PTCR ceramics indicated that the temperature stability of resistance below the switching temperature of PTCR ceramics could be improved by high-energy <b>ball</b> <b>milling,</b> and the optimum temperature stability of resistance below the switching temperature existed in the sample of 3000 rpm- 1 h. The capacitance temperature characteristics of PTCR ceramics were also investigated...|$|R
