"For Your Eyes Only" [...] {{begins with}} the murder of the Havelocks, a British couple in Jamaica who have refused to sell their estate to Herr von Hammerstein, a former Gestapo officer who is the chief of counterintelligence for the Cuban secret service. They are killed by two Cuban hitmen at the {{direction}} of their leader, Major Gonzales; all three work for von Hammerstein. The Havelocks turn out to be close friends of M, who served as the groom's best man during their wedding in 1925. M subsequently gives Bond a <b>voluntary</b> <b>assignment,</b> unconnected to sanctioned Secret Service duties, to travel to Vermont via Canada, find von Hammerstein at his rented estate at Echo Lake and assassinate him as a warning to future criminals who might think to target British citizens. When Bond arrives on the scene, he finds the Havelocks' daughter, Judy, who intends to carry out her own mission of revenge with a bow and arrow. Judy kills von Hammerstein by shooting him in the back with an arrow from [...] away at the exact moment that he dives into a lake. A shoot-out then occurs between Bond and Gonzales and the two Cuban gunmen. Bond kills all of them and returns to Canada with Judy, who has been wounded during the gunfight.|$|E

A survey method was employed to gather 142 usable questionnaires from a group of military officers, namely military cadet officers in a defence based higher education institution, Malaysia. The outcomes of SmartPLS path model showed two important findings: first, relationship between mandatory significantly correlated with trainees 'perceived value. Second, relationship between voluntary significantly correlated with trainees 'perceived value.

The following topics were discussed: (1) methods used for corrosion assessments, surface characterization techniques, and nickel leach testing of metallic cardiovascular implant devices, (2) the limitations {{of each of these}} in vitro tests in predicting in vivo performance, (3) the need, utility, and circumstances when each test should be considered, and (4) the potential testing paradigms, including acceptance criteria for each test. In addition to the above topics, best practices for these various tests were discussed, and knowledge gaps were identified. Prior to the workshop, discussants had the option to provide feedback and information on issues relating to each of the topics via a <b>voluntary</b> preworkshop <b>assignment.</b> During the workshop, the pooled responses were presented and a panel of experts discussed the results.

40|$|Corporate social {{responsibility}} (CSR) was historically a business-oriented idea that companies should voluntarily improve {{their social and}} environmental practices. More recently, CSR has increasingly attracted governments’ attention, and is now promoted in public policy, especially in the European Union (EU). Conflicts can arise, however, when advanced welfare states introduce CSR into public policy. The reason for such conflict is that CSR leaves key public welfare issues to the discretion of private business. This <b>voluntary</b> issue <b>assignment</b> contrasts starkly with advanced welfare states’ traditions favoring negotiated agreements and strong regulation to control corporate conduct. This article analyzes the conflicts and compatibilities arising when advanced welfare states introduce CSR, focusing on how the two traditions diverge and on how conflicts are reconciled. Empirically the study focuses on four Nordic countries—Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden—widely recognized as the most advanced welfare states, and increasingly as leaders in CSR public policy. From interviews of 55 officials of government ministries, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), labor unions, and employer associations, the authors conclude that tension indeed exists between CSR public policies and advanced welfare state traditions in all four countries. Whereas CSR’s aims are compatible with Nordic institutional traditions, the means promoted in CSR is in conflict with such Nordic traditions as corporatist agreements and rights-based welfare state regulation of social and environmental issues. There is harmony of goals, but conflict in means between the four Nordic countries studied...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 70 - 72) The study addressed whether volunteers {{would stay}} within the same organization in order to rise to its highest level of leadership; their motivation and commitment to board activity, and {{their perception of the}} characteristics of effective leadership. The volume of literature covering the administrative volunteer and the non-profit voluntary agency is comparatively sparse. Few empirical studies have focused on the complexities of board members and the agency to which they commit themselves. However, many authors reflect on the ubiquitous nature of voluntary action. The respondents were {{men and women who have}} been or are currently serving on a board of directors of a United Way agency. They either live or work within the San Fernando Valley, a part of metropolitan Los Angeles. The data collected was categorized into five segments: profile of respondents, motivation for voluntary efforts, leadership involvement, skills and characteristics of board responsibility, and characteristics of an ideal type of board assignment. The data indicates a substantial and enduring level of leadership involvement by the respondents. The majority of the volunteers stayed primarily within the same organization for many years although some served on more than one board. They represented a homogenous, well-established community leadership group. The majority of volunteers were motivated by feeling a commitment to "help others," "doing something to benefit the community" and/or "personal satisfaction. " Ideal <b>voluntary</b> board <b>assignments</b> centered around tasks motivated by a personal commitment. Effective board leadership was identified by setting agency and board objectives, making management and program decisions, and having a sound knowledge of the organization...|$|R
40|$|During the October 2006 Term, the United States Supreme Court will {{consider}} the constitutionality of <b>voluntary</b> race-conscious student <b>assignment</b> plans as employed in Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1 and Meredith v. Jefferson County Board of Education. These cases will mark the Court’s first inquiry {{regarding the use of}} race to combat de facto segregation in public education. This article examines the constitutionality of such plans and provides a prediction regarding the Court’s decisions. The article begins with an analysis of the resegregation trend currently plaguing American educational institutions and identifies two causes for the occurrence: (1) the shift in the Supreme Court’s jurisprudence regarding desegregation and (2) school officials’ adherence to the “neighborhood school concept” when making student assignment decisions. The article then examines the challenged plans, specifically their attempts to create and maintain racially diverse student bodies through the use of racial tiebreakers and guidelines. After considering the Supreme Court’s prior decisions and rationale regarding the use of race in education, the article predicts that the Supreme Court will strike down both plans as violative of the Equal Protection Clause. In light of this probable outcome, the article urges school officials to consider race-neutral methods to achieve diversity and {{to improve the quality of}} education provided to disadvantaged, minority students...|$|R

Curs acadèmic 2016 / 2017 The {{following}} study {{deals with}} the need of using the dictionary in the English as a Foreign Language (EFL) classroom {{in order to help}} students acquire better language competence. Nonetheless, in order to make that possible, language teachers need to start considering the relevance of teaching dictionary skills among learners. Indeed, there are many studies which show that dictionary skills are not developed and taught in the language classrooms. During my experience as a language teacher I have realised that my students were not trained to use the dictionary properly. The dictionary was normally used to look up for the translation of words when performing reading, translation or writing tasks. Nevertheless, most of their results were not accurate even when the dictionary was used. This shows that students did not understand the information provided by the dictionary and that they had no instruction {{in order to make the}} best use of lexical and encyclopaedic reference works (both print and electronic). The present study has been carried out among students who are attending a Business Module and whose level of English is A 1 -A 2 (i. e. ‘basic user’), according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). Therefore, considering students’ language level in English and their lack of training upon dictionary skills, this study has the aim of showing students the importance of reference works and how they need to be used as part of the language learning process. Since we do believe in the idea that reference works help language learners to enhance their competence in the L 2, a study has been conducted in order to test this hypothesis. It must be noted that due to the lack of time during the practicum period required for the Máster en Educación Secundaria Obligatoria y Bachillerato, Formación Profesional y Enseñanza de Idiomas of the Universitat Jaume I, the author of this study has specifically focused on improving three types of common mistakes among her students with the help of the dictionary. Hence, the present study deals exclusively with the following lexical points: phrasal verbs and the meaning of specific particles, polysemy and collocations. In order to raise awareness among students of the relevance of how to use reference works properly, and so as to provide them with enough dictionary use training to develop and foster autonomous work, the author has designed a variety of activities based on the lexical points mentioned above. Hereunder the procedure followed during the sessions is described: In the first place, students were given some instruction on dictionary typology and dictionary use so they could get familiar with its information and become more skilled at using reference works. Secondly, students received different activities along different sessions. They were given to students as means of homework or extra assignments during the classroom sessions; however, to take part on the study was <b>voluntary.</b> Then, the <b>assignments</b> were handed in to the teacher so she could track their mistakes, but she did not provide students with immediate correction. Instead, the teacher focused on explaining the lexical point students had to work on during the following session and how they could correct their mistakes with the help of a dictionary. Finally, students were asked to perform the activity again in order to work on the mistakes. To that end, attending to the lexical issue of the activity, the teacher selected the specific dictionary students would need to use for correction. This working method allowed the teacher to prove if: 1. Students become more skilled on dictionary use after instruction. 2. Dictionaries can help language learners to enhance their language competence and to correct mistakes successfully...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the continuing suitability of the existing Australian test for determining when a <b>voluntary</b> <b>assignment</b> of legal property has passed in equity. It suggests that the current test, which focuses upon the ‘completion’ by the donor of the all the necessary transfer formalities, and the underlying equitable maxims that support it, should be revised to better reflect the dual concerns of assignment and constructive trust. The article reviews the English authorities, in particular the English Court of Appeal in Pennington v Waine, which held that the equitable jurisdiction can validate a <b>voluntary</b> <b>assignment</b> of legal property where, in the circumstances, it would be unconscionable to allow the donor to resile. It is argued that this approach represents an appropriate progression because it provides greater scope for a particularised examination of the intention, circumstances and behaviour surrounding the purported assignment. A test which encourages greater contextual examination of the overall circumstances underlying the assignment process {{is consistent with the}} core expectations of equitable methodology. It supports the multi-layered process of determining whether a donor intended the assignment and further, whether that donor should be held liable as constructive trustee. <br /...|$|E

40|$|The <b>voluntary</b> <b>assignment</b> of {{contractual}} (and non-contractual) obligations {{in conflict}} of laws is governed by article 14 of the Rome I Regulation. Under this, {{the validity of the}} assignment as between the assignor and assignee is governed by the law applicable to the contract between them (paragraph 1 of article 14). On the other hand, the assignability of the claim and the relationship between the debtor and the assignee are governed by the law applicable to the obligation assigned (paragraph 2 of article 14). Certain issues are, however, outside the scope of article 14 as it stands at present. These are the question of priorities between competing assignments (if the same obligation is assigned twice to different assignees) and the rights of third parties (mainly creditors of the assignor). This article examines the precise scope of the two existing paragraphs and considers the arguments that might be relevant in deciding what law should govern the issues at present not covered by either paragraph, a question that has become more pressing {{in view of the fact}} that negotiations will soon begin on a possible amendment of article 14 to deal with it...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Each family {{utilizes}} specific {{methods for}} {{personal and social}} education of their children. These methods that are called “Parenting style” are affected by {{various factors such as}} biological, cultural, social, political, and economic factors. The present study intends to investigate the effectiveness of parental skills training on worry, anxiety and self-efficacy beliefs of single-child and multi-child parents. Methods: In this experimental study, two private girls' school located in the city of Karaj, were randomly selected as the control and experimental groups. Parents of experimental group’s students (54 couples) with a <b>voluntary</b> <b>assignment</b> participated in 8 training sessions. Data were obtained by General Self-efficacy Beliefs Questionnaire, Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) which were then analyzed by t-test and ANOVA. Results: Results showed that there was not any significant difference in the pretest between single-child and multi-child parents. Regarding control and experimental groups, a significant difference has been detected between the pretest and posttest between two groups. Multifactor ANOVA test results also showed that the effect of parental skills training is significant on fear, anxiety and self-efficacy. But the number of children does not have any significant effect on the fear, anxiety and self-efficacy. Conclusion: Findings emphasize the necessity and importance of parental skills training to facilitate children nurture, decrease stress and worry resulting from parenting responsibility...|$|E
