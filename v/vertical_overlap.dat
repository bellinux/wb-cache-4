Figure 1 illustrates the Franck–Condon principle for vibronic transitions in a molecule with Morse-like potential energy functions in both the ground and excited electronic states. In the low temperature approximation, the molecule starts out in the v = 0 vibrational level of the ground electronic state and upon absorbing a photon of the necessary energy, makes a transition to the excited electronic state. The electron configuration of the new state {{may result in a}} shift of the equilibrium position of the nuclei constituting the molecule. In the figure this shift in nuclear coordinates between the ground and the first excited state is labeled as q 01. In the simplest case of a diatomic molecule the nuclear coordinates axis refers to the internuclear separation. The vibronic transition is indicated by a vertical arrow due to the assumption of constant nuclear coordinates during the transition. The probability that the molecule can end up in any particular vibrational level is proportional to the square of the (<b>vertical)</b> <b>overlap</b> of the vibrational wavefunctions of the original and final state (see Quantum mechanical formulation section below).

40|$|M. S. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2014. Includes bibliographical references. This study aims to {{elucidate}} why some operational global models can predict TC genesis successfully, while others cannot by conducting two case studies for Typhoons Megi (2010) and Jelawat (2012). The archived {{data of the}} global model forecasts of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and United Kingdom Met O ce (UKMO) are analyzed and compared. For Megi (2010), the ECMWF model showed the best skill in predicting the genesis with the longest leading time. For Jelawat (2012), the NCEP model was the best among the four models. In order to differentiate the developing and non-developing systems in the forecast fields, a new index, called GPIOWZ is introduced in this study. It {{is based on the}} original Genesis Potential Index (GPI) proposed by Emanuel and Nolan (2004), and modified using the Okubo-Weiss-Zeta (OWZ) parameter (Tory et al. 2013) instead of the absolute vorticity in order to detect the rotational component of vorticity associated with a disturbance. The results show that the GPIOWZ is a good indicator of the developing and non-developing systems. The failed forecasts tend to show a smaller OWZ parameter, lower relative humidity (RH) in the mid-troposphere, stronger vertical wind shear (VWS) and/or weaker maximum potential intensity (MPI). The advantage of using the new GPIOWZ index is that sensitivity experiments can be conducted to identify which parameter(s) contribute negatively to the index and thus produce a negative e ect on the failed genesis forecasts. Results from our limited sensitivity experiments indicate that the parameters with negative effects vary from model to model and with different forecasts. In addition to the GPIOWZ, the comparison of convective available potential energy (CAPE) and the <b>vertical</b> <b>overlapping</b> of the OWZ parameter at 850 hPa and 500 hPa were conducted. The failed forecasts tend to show higher CAPE than the successful forecasts for Megi, suggesting that the convective scheme cannot release the CAPE well in the failed forecasts (although this is less systematic for Jelawat). The successful forecasts tend to show larger <b>vertical</b> <b>overlapping</b> regions of the OWZ parameter, but some failed forecasts also show large overlapping area, indicating that the environmental conditions are also important. The difference in the <b>vertical</b> <b>overlapping</b> grid numbers of the OWZ parameter between the failed and successful forecasts is model dependent.

The RBFPD was cast from a silver-palladium alloy (Castwell M. C. 12), and the pontic was veneered with an indirect composite material (Estenia). The retainers were primed with a metal conditioner (V-Primer) and seated with a tri-n-butylborane initiated adhesive resin (Super-Bond C&B). After an observation period of eight years, a fracture occurred in the incisal edge of the central incisor abutment. The fractured area was restored with light-polymerizing composite resin and the anterior guidance was re-adjusted.

40|$|Aim: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to analyze the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survery (NHANES III) database to determine whether excessive overlap of the anterior teeth was related to an increase in structural dental problems. Materials and Methods: The NHANES III database was procured from the National Center for Healthcare Statistics for the purpose of investigating whether a relationship exists between tooth condition and occlusal characteristics of horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>overlap.</b> The sample population was limited to those aged 18 - 50 to incorporate those people who had both Restoration and Tooth Condition Scores and Occlusal Characteristics. The subject set was statistically analyzed using SAS v 9. 2 software to demonstrate any possible relationships. Results: Our study reaffirmed the characteristics of naturally occurring occlusions. It was shown that 59. 5 % of the population has a horizontal overlap between 1 - 3 mm, 56 % of the population has a <b>vertical</b> <b>overlap</b> of 1 - 3 mm, and 4. 6 % of the population has an open bite. It was also suggested {{that the majority of the}} population has a sound dentition with 83. 61 % of all teeth recorded being sound. The anterior relationship to tooth condition score comparison was also made for individual at-risk teeth. Teeth numbers 9 (maxillary left central incisor), 12 (maxillary left first premolar), and 14 (maxillary left first molar) were analyzed. The vast majority of teeth were again found to be sound, approximately 85 % (tooth 9), 75 % (tooth 12), and 71 % (tooth 14). No association was found between overlap and tooth condition scores for any individual tooth. Conclusions: According to the NHANES III data file documentation currently available through the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, no relationship exists between the degree of anterior overlap and tooth condition. Due to large differences in the raw data found within this database when compared to previously published data, the reliability of the NHANES III database can be called into question...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} results of {{research}} carried out in Campania in 2002 and 2003, during winter-summer period, {{with the aim of}} determining the production of Capsicum annuum L. var. Longum, also known as “Friariello” (local cv Nocera) grown under double plastic film (IR-PE) polytunnels with the nutrient film technique. Comparisons were made of four nutritive solutions differing in electrical conductivity (EC) levels (3. 5, 3. 8, 4. 1 and 4. 4 mS•cm- 1), in factorial combination with crops arranged in pairs on two <b>vertical</b> <b>overlapping</b> layers; a split-plot design was arranged and each randomised treatment included 12 plants with three replications. Plants were placed on gullies through a pierced white PE film which prevents algae diffusion. A pepper control crop was grown in the same tunnels with the current technique, i. e. with plants spaced 30 cm apart along the row and in double rows 40 cm apart (achieving the same density of 5. 3 plants per m 2 as with the NFT) on black PE mulched ridges (80 cm wide). Due to the shade, the crop placed on the lower level was negatively affected with regard to yield, where the reduced fruit number caused a 37 % mean decrease. Of the salinity treatments examined, those based on nutrient solutions with 3. 8 mS•cm- 1 EC gave the highest yields, within the higher crop level, whereas the 4. 1 mS•cm- 1 EC gave the best results with regard to the lower layer; these two treatments, overall and in relation to the net unit surface area, exceeded the control by about 70 %. Daily water and ionic absorptions attained the highest intensities in the second decade of June, corresponding to the maximum fructification rate; in this phase, the absorption of most of the analysed nutrients was higher with the 3. 8 - 4. 1 mS•cm- 1 EC range for the upper layer and 4. 1 - 4. 4 for the lower one...|$|R
40|$|This PhD thesis {{provides}} design {{strategies to}} control changes produced in mountains places and landscapes following constructions of roads. Strategies {{are based on}} the activation of unexpressed potentialities in places, although compromised, characterized by presence of roads. With the term unexpressed potentialities we refer to functions, attitudes, uses which, during the process of road realization, have not found an appropriate design solution. Topic of the thesis is to demonstrate that these design gaps can be properly addressed by an architecture project, obtaining two results: create a link between places, landscapes and roads and consolidate the participation of architecture discipline in a field (roads production) in which, today in Italy, it is less integrated than others. Changes in mountain landscapes are characterized by morphology and orography of the territory crossed: the factor that most influences in this direction is the verticality of the space. This specificity is discussed in the thesis through the analysis of road segments, infrastructure nodes or other specific situations, divided according to the topography in which there are: high gradients, slope or bottom of valleys. Specific characteristics which correspond to the three different orographic situations are explained by an interpretative study of the cross section, highlighting the potentiality of the space related with its vertical dimension. Most study cases belong to the geographical area of Trentino Alto Adige, an Italian region characterized by mountain landscapes. Some study cases are taken from other Italian regions or known experiences of the international context. The proposed strategies are developed through study of architectural projects, joined by devices that interpret the <b>vertical</b> (<b>overlapping,</b> slope and difference in altitude) of the spaces, reproposable in cases of mountain road. All strategies can be applied at any step of road production, from concept to design to construction. In addition, and we assume that this is the most frequent case, can be applied ex post, when the road is built, intervening to change situations already in place. ...|$|R
