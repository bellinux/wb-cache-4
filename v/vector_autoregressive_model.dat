40|$|A spatio-temporal {{method for}} {{producing}} very-short-term parametric probabilistic wind power forecasts {{at a large}} number of locations is presented. Smart grids containing tens, or hundreds, of wind generators require skilled very-short-term forecasts to operate effectively, and spatial information is highly desirable. In addition, probabilistic forecasts are widely regarded as necessary for optimal power system management as they quantify the uncertainty associated with point forecasts. Here we work within a parametric framework based on the logit-normal distribution and forecast its parameters. The location parameter for multiple wind farms is modelled as a vector-valued spatio-temporal process, and the scale parameter is tracked by modified exponential smoothing. A state-of-the-art technique for fitting sparse <b>vector</b> <b>autoregressive</b> <b>models</b> is employed to model the location parameter and demonstrates numerical advantages over conventional <b>vector</b> <b>autoregressive</b> <b>models.</b> The proposed method is tested on a dataset of 5 minute mean wind power generation at 22 wind farms in Australia. 5 -minute-ahead forecasts are produced and evaluated in terms of point and probabilistic forecast skill scores and calibration.

We also examine various Bayesian and classical time-series models in our forecasting exercise to compare to the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model, estimated using Bayesian methods. In addition to standard vector-autoregressive and Bayesian <b>vector</b> <b>autoregressive</b> <b>models,</b> we also include the information content of either 10 or 120 quarterly series in some models to capture the influence of fundamentals. We consider two approaches for including information from large data sets â€“ extracting common factors (principle components) in a Factor-Augmented <b>Vector</b> <b>Autoregressive</b> or Factor-Augmented Bayesian <b>Vector</b> <b>Autoregressive</b> <b>models</b> or Bayesian shrinkage in a large-scale Bayesian <b>Vector</b> <b>Autoregressive</b> <b>models.</b> We compare the out-of-sample forecast performance of the alternative models, using the average root mean squared error for the forecasts. We find that the small-scale Bayesian-shrinkage model (10 variables) outperforms the other models, including the large-scale Bayesian-shrinkage model (120 variables). Finally, we use each model to forecast the turning point in 2006 :Q 2, using the estimated model through 2005 :Q 2. Only the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model actually forecasts a turning point with any accuracy, suggesting that attention to developing forward-looking microfounded dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models of the housing market, over and above fundamentals, proves crucial in forecasting turning points...|$|R
