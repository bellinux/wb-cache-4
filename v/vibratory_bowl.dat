40|$|The use of micro-scale {{metallic}} pins {{in small}} engineering devices poses numerous problems {{due to their}} physical size and the dominant forces which act on micro-scale objects. Assembly of devices with micro-scale parts is problematic because the components are below the practical threshold of unaided human manipulation and most robotic manipulation. The use of tweezers and microscopes to aid human assembly is possible but challenging because the micro-scale pins tend to adhere to tweezers. Previous work has found that vibratory feeder-bowls provide a feasible means to singulate and orient micro-scale pins by overcoming the adhesive forces that plague other manipulation techniques. ^ The analysis and prediction {{of the behavior of}} <b>vibratory</b> feeder <b>bowls</b> for micro-scale components has previously been limited to two dimensions.

This model is based on an impulse-momentum contact model and it incorporates traditional macro-scale forces such as gravity, air-drag, and friction as well as micro-scale interactions such as magnetic and electrostatic forces. In comparison to prior experimental pin capture rates, the three dimensional simulation produced more accurate results than the existing two dimensional simulation. Finally, the simulation was used to conduct a parametric study to characterize the effects that varying system parameters have on the performance of the feeder bowl. ...|$|R

The effects of the leaf-spring legs are transformed to forces and moments acting on the base and bowl of the feeder. Resultant forces are obtained based upon the coordinate transformation, and the moment analysis is produced based upon the orthogonality of the orientation matrix.

40|$|Abstract [...] - Modern {{production}} techniques demand {{high degree of}} automation in feeding and handling of individual components. Where the amount of production equipment has allowed machining times to be reduced in many processes, at the same time, feeding operations are still manually carried out {{which means that the}} handling of components accounts for a greater proportion of overall working cycle time. Mechanized part feeding has thus become an indispensable part of today’s automated assembly lines where feeding of small parts in a preferred orientation is of paramount importance. The conventional <b>vibratory</b> <b>bowl</b> feeder used in the industry is capable of feeding a variety of parts but is usually used for feeding one particular type of component to a particular assembly line. Situations occur where there are multiple assembly lines running in parallel carrying different components. Each line has a dedicated feeding system supplying components to the same. In case the variety of parts to be fed is large then this system of having different feeders for different parts is not feasible. The aim of our work is to design, fabricate and analyze the performance of an agile feeding system, which eliminates the need for multiple feeding systems and replaces it by a single unit. Our system consists of a <b>vibratory</b> <b>bowl</b> part feeder and a pneumatic programmable system integrated with it for identifying the different parts, sorting them and feeding them to their desired locations.

40|$|The <b>vibratory</b> <b>bowl</b> feeder {{remains the}} most common {{approach}} to the automated feeding (orienting) of industrial parts. We study the algorithmic design of a trap in the bowl feeder track that filters out all but one orientation of a given polygonal part. We propose {{a new class of}} traps that we call guillotine traps, which remove a portion of the track between two parallel lines. A major advantage of guillotine traps over previously studied traps [1] is that they permit feeding the part in a user-specified stable orientation, whereas these other traps offered no control over the orientation to be fed. The capability of feeding a part in any priorly specified orientation for example offers the user a means of control over the feed rate. We present a complete algorithm that takes as input any polygonal part consisting of n vertices, along with its center of mass, and a desired output orientation of the part. Our algorithm computes a guillotine trap for a <b>vibratory</b> <b>bowl</b> feeder that outputs parts in the desired orientation, or reports that no such trap exists. The algorithm runs in O(nα(n) log n + nk), where α(n) is the extremely slowly growing inverse of the Ackermann function, and k is the number of candidate solutions. Although the value of k is trivially bounded by O(n), we conjecture that k is a small constant except for highly symmetric and regular parts. Surprisingly, our algorithm is considerably more efficient than the algorithm for the more restricted and hence less powerful gap trap, which was shown to run in O(n 2 log n) time [1].

40|$|A {{review of}} the {{previous}} work on the mechanics of vibratory conveying is given., It is found that several theoretical studies {{have been made in}} the past but the predictions of the theories and the comparisons of these' with experimental results have only been applicable to a very limited range of the relevant variables. In the present work, a theoretical analysis is described which enables the mean conveying velocity of a component on a conventional vibratory conveyor to be determined for'a wide range of the relevant variables. Since an alternative method of vibration is discussed, "conventional" refers' to vibratory conveyors which are commercially available. The results of this theory are compared with the results of experimental work conducted on apparatus specially designed for the purpose. Within practical limits, good agreement is obtained. From this work it is concluded that fundamental limitations eXist in conventional vibratory conveying, the most important of which are that the conveying velocity is very sensitive to changes in the coefficient of friction between the component and the track and for low coefficients of friction, the conveying velocity for steady conveying is inadequate. • A further analysis is then described which considers the mechanics of Vibratory conveying where a phase difference exists between the normal and parallel motions of the track, (known as "out of phase" conveying). Again, within certain limits, the new theory is in good agreement with experimental results. It is apparent from this work that with the correct phase relation$hip between the two components of vibration, definite practical advantages exist over conventional conveying. With "out of phase" conveying, the component velocity is virtually independent of the nature of the component and track materials and conveying velocities significantly higher than those obtainable on a conventional vibratory conveyor axe possible. Further, with this vibration system, components can be conveyed separately and without erratic motion up an inclined track.

Very good agreement was observed between the simulation and the aforementioned experiments. The simulation was used to predict the behavior of the simple vibrational assembly of a washer onto an axle. The process was also examined experimentally and, once again, very good agreement was observed between the simulation and experiments. ^ The simulation was finally used to predict the effects of component geometry, operating conditions, material properties, and other characteristics on the performance of vibrational parallel assembly. Strategies for using the simulation to rapidly improve the design of components for vibrational parallel assembly were developed.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{solutions for}} problems derived from industrial assembly and robotic manipulation. The basic tasks {{in a factory}} are manufacturing the parts, and combining them into the desired product. In automating these tasks, we want to use robot manipulators that require little or no human intervention. We explore devices that deliver parts in a uniform orientation to robots. Such a device is called a partfeeder. Part feeders are used to improve the efficiency in an industrial assembly line: robots to which the parts are fed in a uniform orientation can easily process these parts without having to sense their initial orientations. In practice, the problem of part feeding is usually solved using trial-and-error approaches which are time consuming and error prone. We show how to systematically design part feeders using techniques from computational geometry. We consider four different feeders. The first feeder consists of a sequence of fences which are mounted across a conveyor belt. The fences brush the part as it travels down the belt thus reorienting it. The second feeder is a pulling finger which applies a sequence of pull operations that reorients flat parts with elevated edges. The third feeder deals with three-dimensional parts. It is a sequence of (tilted) plates with fences which reorients a three-dimensional polyhedral part as it travels down the plates.

Recent research in the theory of programmable force elds has yielded open-loop strategies to uniquely position, orient, and sort parts. These strategies typically consist of several elds that have to be employed in sequence to achieve a desired nal pose. The length of the sequence depends on the complexity of the part. In this paper, we show that unique part poses can be achieved with just one eld. First, we exhibit a single eld that positions and orients any part (with the exception of certain symmetric parts) into two stable equilibrium poses. Then we show that for any part there exists a eld in which the part reaches a unique stable equilibrium pose (again with the exception of symmetric parts). Besides giving an optimal upper bound for unique parts positioning and orientation, our work gives further evidence that programmable force elds are a powerful tool for parts manipulation. Our second result also leads to the design of parts feeders&quot;, proving an earlier conjecture about their existence. We argue that universal parts feeders are relatively easy to build, and we report on extensive simulation results which indicate that these devices may work very well in practice. We believe that the results in this paper could be the basis {{for a new generation of}} e cient, open-loop, parallel parts feeders...|$|E

These devices play an important operational role since feeding {{is one of the}} major operations involved in an automated assembly process. However they account for much of the cost of an automated assembly system because most of the engineering time spent to develop such a system is used to devise a means of feeding the components in the correct orientation for the assembly process. This thesis describes the implementation of an integrated and computer controlled feeding and transfer system. The system consists of a <b>vibratory</b> <b>bowl</b> feeder for selecting, orienting and feeding parts and a flat conveyor belt for transferring parts to a prescribed location. The work focusses mainly on the design and analysis of the bowl feeder, on the mechanical and information interfacing aspects of the integration problem and on the control of the system. Sensing and electronic control circuits were also built to complete the system. The system implemented is to be integrated at a later stage with an industrial robot for handling purposes. Therefore, some issues related to the handling of parts from the conveyor belt by the robot are also discussed. Experimental results show that the recommendable operating frequency for the vibratory feeder is close to the value predicted by theoretical analysis. Several concurrent activities with critical time constraints and different periods were involved in the system, making the control more difficult due to the limited control capabilities of Visual basic, an easy to learn programming language used to implement the control program and the relatively slow speed of the computer used Nevertheless, it was observed that for feed rates close to 3 parts/min, the program developed performs well regarding the random control of the flow rate of parts on the conveyor, parts position and speed profiles obtained compare satisfactorily with the corresponding theoretical profiles. Recommendations for the integration of the robot to the system are made...|$|E
40|$|The {{success of}} Automated Assembly in Mass Production {{hinges on the}} {{effective}} performance of automated high speed part positioners. One such parts presenter is the conventional <b>Vibratory</b> <b>Bowl</b> Feeder (VBF). There {{is a need to}} extend this success of assembly automation in Mass Production into Batch Production. However, the lack of flexible part positioners to facilitate the handling of different batches of components is a major obstacle in this. A need for a flexible production feeder in batch production processes is therefore clear. This project attempts to make progress {{in the development of a}} flexible VBF, the main problems being the inflexible nature of the orientation tools as currently employed. The project tackles the design, development and manufacture of a range of automated programmable orientation tools which, in combination, make up a typical orientation system for the VBF. Three prototype tools were developed: the Wiper Blade, Narrow Ledge and the Edge Riser Tools. These tools were focused for the purpose of the project on the feeding of a specific target component. Seven further orientation tools were designed with the intention of future development and implementation/inclusion into the feeding research process at a later stage. As well as the tool automation programming, a programme was developed to drive the system automatically through a sequence of settings, whilst logging the data related to each. An algorithm was developed to establish the performance at each setting and establish the overall optimum. A design of experiment approach could be incorporated at a later stage to establish combined optimum settings (optimum taking into account the interdependencies). For the purpose of developing and demonstrating a prototype flexible VBF in the time scale available, the optimisation of each variable independently of the others only, was tackled in this project. The outcome of this research was a prototype of a system of modular, programmable, interchangeable and self-optimisation orientation tools for the development of a fully flexible VBF system...|$|E
