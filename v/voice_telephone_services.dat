Failed PayTV provider MiTV attempted to use an IPTV-over-UHF service but the service failed to take off. Hypp.TV was supposed to use an IPTV-based system, but not true IPTV as it {{does not provide a}} set-top box and requires users to view channels using a computer. True IPTV providers available in the country at the moment are Fine TV and DETV. In Q2 2010, Telekom Malaysia launched IPTV services through their fibre to the home product UniFi in select areas. In April 2010, Astro began testing IPTV services on TIME dotCom Berhad's high-speed fibre to the home optical fibre network. In December 2010, Astro began trials with customers in high-rise condominium buildings around the Mont Kiara area. In April 2011, Astro commercially launched its IPTV services under the tag line [...] "The One and Only Line You'll Ever Need", a triple play offering in conjunction with TIME dotCom Berhad that provides all the Astro programming via IPTV, together with <b>voice</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>services</b> and broadband Internet access all through the same fibre optic connection into the customer's home.|$|E
40|$|Using econometric methods, this {{analysis}} develops quantity impacts of impediments {{to trade in}} <b>voice</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>services,</b> focusing on the perspective of negotiated agreements. These impacts, estimated {{on the basis of}} market, demographic, and policy variables, establish a baseline from which the achievements of future trade rounds, including the Doha Round, could be compared. In a departure from previous literature in this area, this article draws on documents appended or pertaining to the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) to identify barriers to trade in <b>voice</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>services,</b> and to estimate quantity impacts on this basis. The article finds that market access and national treatment commitments scheduled by WTO members under the GATS, when complemented by commitments to pro-competitive regulatory disciplines, may be formulated into meaningful policy variables. These policy variables are found to be statistically significant in explaining market penetration in <b>voice</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>services,</b> as are variables for income and private sector ownership. ...|$|E

40|$|IP {{telephony}} {{refers to}} the use of Internet protocols to provide voice, video, and data in one integrated service over LANs, BNs, MANs, not WANs. VoIP provides three key benefits compared to traditional <b>voice</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>services.</b> First, it minimizes the need fro extra wiring in new buildings. Second, it provides easy movement of telephones and the ability of phone numbers to move with the individual. Finally, VoIP is generally cheaper to operate because it requires less network capacity to transmit the same voice telephone call over an increasingly digital telephone network (FitzGerald & Dennis, 2007 p. 519). Unfortunately, benefits of new electronic communications come with proportionate risks. Companies experience losses resulting from attacks on data networks. There are direct losses like economic theft, theft of trade secrets and digital data, as well as indirect losses that include loss of sales, loss of competitive advantage etc. The companies need to develop their security policies to protect their businesses. But the practice of information security has become more complex than ever. The research paper will be about the major DoS threats the company’s VoIP environment can experience as well as best countermeasures {{that can be used to}} prevent them and make the VoIP environment and, therefore, company’s networking environment more secure...|$|E

40|$|In Section I of this Article, I {{provide an}} {{introduction}} to regulation and problems of trade in services and illustrate how the basic GATS framework extends to cover regulation of Internet services. Section II discusses two short studies that highlight these problems of trade in information services. China, {{one of the world}} 2 ̆ 7 s most comprehensive Internet regulators, makes for an interesting case because as a condition to accession to the WTO, it agreed to what have been called 2 ̆ 2 radical 2 ̆ 2 reforms of its service practices. Yet at the same time, China is among the world 2 ̆ 7 s more active filterers of Internet services. As we shall see, these two positions are in tension, and while WTO law leaves much room for exceptions, some of China 2 ̆ 7 s restrictions may have trouble being justified under the GATS. The second study is of Voice-over-IP services. Companies like the well- known 2 ̆ 2 Skype 2 ̆ 2 offer free <b>voice</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>services</b> to anyone with an Internet connection. As a consequence, in many instances incumbent telephony carriers, often state-owned, have a strong competitive interest in preventing VoIP from reaching their citizens.

40|$|Universal {{service in}} voice {{telephony}} is generally {{taken for granted}} in the United States. Once a policy for extending the monopoly network to include all citizens, modifications continue {{to be made to}} achieve the goal of full penetration in a competitive environment. The debate on universal service policy reform has included discussions of general versus targeted subsidies, support for high-cost areas versus low-income households, and source of contributions. Universality of <b>voice</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>service</b> seemed to have benefited from the combination of the end of a ubiquitous monopolist and the corresponding universal service policies. Penetration increased from 91. 4 % in 1983 to 95. 5 % in March 2003. More recently, however, telephone penetration has dropped significantly. Recent data from the FCC shows a significant {{decline in the number of}} U. S. households that have a telephone of any kind (including mobile), with telephone penetration down to 92. 9 % in November 2005 (FCC 2006). This decline is both statistically significant and meaningful, as approximately 2. 6 % of US households that could reach 911 for emergencies in 2003 no longer can. Since the current census questionnaire asks the respondent if they are using a wireline, wireless, or other type of telephone, the decline is not du...|$|R

50|$|Symmetrical {{high-speed}} {{digital subscriber}} line (SHDSL) {{is a form of}} symmetric {{digital subscriber line}} (SDSL), a data communications technology for equal transmit and receive (i.e. symmetric) data rate over copper telephone lines, faster than a conventional voiceband modem can provide. As opposed to other DSL technologies, SHDSL employs trellis-coded pulse-amplitude modulation (TC-PAM). As a baseband transmission scheme, TC-PAM operates at frequencies that include those used by the analog <b>voice</b> plain old <b>telephone</b> <b>service</b> (POTS). As such, a frequency splitter, or DSL filter, cannot be used to allow a telephone line to be shared by both an SHDSL service and a POTS service at the same time. Support of symmetric data rates made SHDSL a popular choice by businesses for private branch exchange (PBX), virtual private network (VPN), web hosting and other data services.|$|R

50|$|Another company, Delphi Communications of California, deserves some partial {{credit for}} {{invention}} of voicemail. Under {{the leadership of}} Jay Stoffer, Delphi developed a proprietary system called Delta 1 that picked up incoming calls directly from the telephone company. Stoffer presented the Delphi concept publicly to the association of <b>Telephone</b> Answering <b>Services</b> around 1973 and the prototype system was launched in San Francisco in 1976 by a Delphi company called VoiceBank. Delphi developed Delta 1 as a purely service-oriented voice messaging system to answer subscriber telephones for businesses and professionals. Delta 1 required human intervention for message deposit. While three machines were built, only one machine was put into operational service. The completely automated voice messaging system (Delta 2) was developed for initial operational use in Los Angeles in 1981. Apparently Delta 2 was built, installed and operational for a short while, but unfortunately Delphi's major early investor, Exxon Enterprises, abruptly shut down Delphi in July, 1982. Nothing further was done with Delphi's technology. A patent was applied for and issued for Delphi's Automated <b>Telephone</b> <b>Voice</b> <b>Service</b> System. The patent, U.S. Patent No. 4,625,081, was issued after Delphi's closure, but Delphi's assets (and the patent) were transferred to another Exxon company, Gilbarco, which made equipment for gas pumps at filling stations. Gilbarco is now owned by GEC in the United Kingdom.|$|R
