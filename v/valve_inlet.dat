A unique triggering and data collection system was developed, allowing a CCD to acquire two consecutive images at a specific crank angle.

The RMS turbulent quantities indicated a wider range of velocity closer to the valves than downstream. An adaptive cross correlation and validation PIV algorithm implemented by Usera (1999) was used.

50|$|Often, gas is {{produced}} {{through the same}} perforations as the oil. This can be problematic if gas enters the pump, because it can result in {{what is known as}} gas locking, where insufficient pressure builds up in the pump barrel to open the valves (due to compression of the gas) and little or nothing is pumped. To preclude this, the inlet for the pump can be placed below the perforations. As the gas-laden fluid enters the well bore through the perforations, the gas bubbles up the annulus (the space between the casing and the tubing) while the liquid moves down to the standing <b>valve</b> <b>inlet.</b> Once at the surface, the gas is collected through piping connected to the annulus.|$|E
