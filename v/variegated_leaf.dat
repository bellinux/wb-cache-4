Thirty-four SSR loci were selected for SSR primer design and were validated in PCR experiments. These multilocus SSR primers, distributed across the X. fastidiosa genome, clearly differentiated and clustered X. fastidiosa strains collected from grape, almond, citrus, and oleander.

40|$|Xylella fastidiosa {{can cause}} a number of plant {{diseases}} {{in a variety of}} plant hosts including Pierce’s disease of grapevines, almond leaf scorch disease, alfalfa dwarf, citrus <b>variegated</b> chlorosis, <b>leaf</b> scorch of live oak, pear leaf scorch, and oleander leaf scorch. In Southern California, the primary insect vector of concern is the glassy-winged sharpshooter, Homalodisca coagulata (Say). Previous studies of Xylella fastidiosa-induced diseases have described systems dealing with different primary vector species and different alternate host plants than those that are found in the Southern California systems. In this project, a variety of plant species found near a severe outbreak of Pierce’s disease in vineyards in the Temecula valley of California were tested to identify potential sources of inoculum in the area. Plants were tested though three summer seasons using ELISA, culture on specialized media, and PCR methods to monitor for the presence of the pathogen. Plant species from the field that consistently tested positive for a grape strain of X. fastidiosa were the previously known hosts grape and almond, and two new hosts, Spanish broom, Spartium junceum and wild mustard, Brassica spp. Samples of oleander, Nerium oleander, also tested positive, however the strain of X. fastidiosa that infects oleander differs from the grape strain and does not appear to infect grape plants. Greenhouse transmission studies indicate that the glassy-winged sharpshooter was able to transmit a grape strain of the pathogen to Spartium junceum, Brassica nigra and other hosts...|$|R
50|$|This non-mendelian {{inheritance}} pattern was later {{traced to a}} gene named iojap which codes for a small protein required for proper assembly of the chloroplast ribosome. Even though iojap assorts according to Mendel's rules, if the mother is homozygous recessive, then the protein is not produced, the chloroplast ribosomes fail to form, and the plasmid becomes non-functional because the ribosomes cannot be imported into the organelle. The progeny could have functional copies of iojap, but since the chloroplasts come exclusively from the mother in most angiosperms, {{they would have been}} inactivated in the previous generation, and so will give white plants. Conversely, if a white father is paired with a green mother with functional chloroplasts, the progeny will only inherit functional chloroplasts, and will thus be green. In his 1909 paper, he established <b>variegated</b> <b>leaf</b> color as the first conclusive example of cytoplasmic inheritance.|$|E
40|$|Several mutants were induced in the {{chickpea}} cultivar JG 315 after {{seed treatment}} with ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS). A <b>variegated</b> <b>leaf</b> mutant (Jawahar Gram Mutant 3 or JGM 3) was {{isolated in the}} M 2 of the 0. 4 % EMS treatment for 6 h. All leaflets of the <b>variegated</b> <b>leaf</b> mutant showed a large single white lesion on the foliage blade at {{both sides of the}} midrib. Each lesion was associated with a constriction at the leaflet margin. Another mutant with apical chlorosis (JGM 6) was isolated in the M 2 of the 0. 6 % EMS treatment for 6 h. In this mutant, the young foliage was always yellow at the growing apex while lower leaves developed chlorophyll and turned light green as they grew older. A foliar spray of 0. 5 % FeSO 4 had no effect on the chlorotic foliage although it corrected soil-borne chlorosis in the accession ICC 4992. This shows that the chlorosis in JGM 6 was not a result of iron deficiency. Both mutations were recessive. The genes controlling the <b>variegated</b> <b>leaf</b> and the apical chlorosis traits are assigned symbols var and ach, respectively. Variegated simple leaf segregants were recovered from the F 2 of the cross JGM 3 × ICC 10301 (simple leaf) which have ornamental appearance...|$|E
40|$|Extranuclear {{inheritance}} {{through the}} independent genetic codes of some organelles leads to non-Mendelian expression of traits. In this lab, we explored {{the phenomenon of}} extranuclear inheritance in a stock of Brassica rapa plants with a mutant phenotype. These plants express <b>variegated</b> <b>leaf</b> color with patches of white and green appearing in the tissue of the leaves and stems. We preformed crosses between the variegated and wildtype plants. The F 1 generation was scored for variegation {{with the result that}} variegated females mated with wildtype males gave rise to all variegated offspring while the reciprocal cross produced wildtype plants. This indicates that variegation is passed by maternal inheritance through the chloroplasts present in the cytosol of the egg rather than through the chromosomal genes...|$|E
40|$|The {{recessive}} nuclear vdl (for <b>variegated</b> {{and distorted}} <b>leaf)</b> mutant of tobacco {{was obtained by}} T-DNA insertion and characterized by variegated leaves and abnormal roots and flowers. Affected leaf tissues were white and distorted, lacked palisadic cells, and contained undifferentiated plastids. The variegation was due to phenotypic, rather than genetic, instability. Genomic and cDNA clones were obtained for both the mutant and wild-type VDL alleles. Three transcripts, resulting from alternate intron splicing or polyadenylation, were found for the wild type. The transcripts potentially encode a set of proteins (53, 19, and 15 kD) sharing the same N-terminal region that contains a chloroplast transit peptide capable of importing the green fluorescent protein into chloroplasts. The predicted 53 -kD product belongs to the DEAD box RNA helicase family. In the homozygous vdl mutant, T-DNA insertion resulted in accumulation of the shortest transcript {{and the absence of}} the RNA helicase-encoding transcript. Genetic transformation of the homozygous mutant by the 53 -kD product-encoding cDNA fully restored the wild-type phenotype. These data suggest that a plastid RNA helicase controls early plastid differentiation and plant morphogenesis...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Citrus {{variegated}} chlorosis (CVC) {{and coffee}} stem atrophy (CSA) are important diseases in Brazil associated with closely-related strains of Xylella fastidiosa, but little is know about host overlapping {{and importance of}} citrus and coffee as inoculum sources of these strains. In this study, reciprocal-inoculation experiments were performed to determine if CVC and CSA isolates are biologically similar within citrus and coffee plants. These two hosts were mechanically inoculated with a CVC and a CSA isolate of X. fastidiosa at four concentrations ranging between 103 and 109 colony forming units CFU mL- 1. At two, four and eight months after inoculation, the infection efficiency and bacterial populations of the isolates in each host were determined by culturing. The CVC isolate infected both citrus and coffee plants, but developed lower populations in coffee. The CSA isolate did not colonize citrus. Inoculation of coffee plants with the CVC isolate resulted in low rates of infection and required an inoculum concentration ten-fold higher than that necessary to obtain a similar (25 %) rate of infection in citrus. The relatively low infection rates and bacterial numbers of the CVC isolate in coffee plants compared with those observed in citrus suggest that coffee is not a suitable host {{to serve as a}} source of inoculum of the CVC strain for primary spread to citrus or within coffee plantations.

40|$|Regulation {{of carbon}} {{partitioning}} {{is essential for}} plant growth and development. To gain insight into genes controlling carbon allocation in leaves, we identified mutants that hyperaccumulate carbohydrates. tie-dyed 2 (tdy 2) is a recessive mutant of maize (Zea mays) with <b>variegated,</b> nonclonal, chlorotic <b>leaf</b> sectors containing excess starch and soluble sugars. Consistent with a defect in carbon export, we found that a by-product of functional chloroplasts, likely a sugar, induces tdy 2 phenotypic expression. Based on the phenotypic similarities between tdy 2 and two other maize mutants with leaf carbon accumulation defects, tdy 1 and sucrose export defective 1 (sxd 1), we investigated whether Tdy 2 functioned in the same pathway as Tdy 1 or Sxd 1. Cytological and genetic studies demonstrate that Tdy 2 and Sxd 1 function independently. However, in tdy 1 /+; tdy 2 /+ F 1 plants, we observed a moderate chlorotic sectored phenotype, suggesting that the two genes are dosage sensitive and have a related function. This type of genetic interaction {{is referred to as}} second site noncomplementation and has often, though not exclusively, been found in cases where the two encoded proteins physically interact. Moreover, tdy 1; tdy 2 double mutants display a synergistic interaction supporting this hypothesis. Additionally, we determined that cell walls of chlorotic leaf tissues in tdy mutants contain increased cellulose; thus, tdy mutants potentially represent enhanced feedstocks for biofuels production. From our phenotypic and genetic characterizations, we propose a model whereby TDY 1 and TDY 2 function together in a single genetic pathway, possibly in homo- and heteromeric complexes, to promote carbon export from leaves...|$|R
40|$|Seeds of Vigna unguiculata (L.) WALP cv Ife Brown {{were used}} to {{determine}} the effective dosage of Ethydium Bromide on the agro- morphology of first mutant (M 1) and second mutant (M 2) generations. The research was carried out both in the Screen house of College of Plant Science and Crop Production and on the Field of Teaching and Research Farms of the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta. Cowpea seeds were treated with varying concentration of Ethydium Bromide (0. 2 %, 0. 3 %, 0. 4 %) and incubation period (18 and 24 hours). The effect of this treatment combination on the germination, survival and agro- morphological traits were studied at M 1 and M 2 generations. All germinated seeds survived till the second week of planting but declined at the fifth week. Control recorded the poorest performance of all character studied while 0. 2 / 18 and 0. 2 / 24 recorded the highest. The growth rate of induced plants were fasten as compared to the control. This could be linked to the effect of the chemical mutagen. Lethal mutants and <b>variegated</b> <b>leaf</b> mutants were observed at M 2 generation. However, 0. 2 % concentration of Ethydium Bromide was found to be more effective on cowpea plants...|$|E
40|$|Brassinosteroids (BRs) are steroidal {{plant hormones}} that are {{important}} regulators of plant growth. These compounds are widely distributed throughout reproductive and vegetative plant tissues. This {{raises the question of}} whether or not BRs are transported over long distances between these tissues. Several lines of evidence indicate that this is not the case. Exogenous BRs move only slowly, if at all, after application to leaves; grafting BR-deficient mutants to wild-type plants has no phenotypic effect; removal of the apical bud or mature leaves does not reduce BR levels in the remaining internodes; and, in tomato, wild-type sectors do not substantially alter the growth of BR-deficient sectors when the two types are together in a <b>variegated</b> <b>leaf.</b> Although BRs do not undergo long-distance transport they may influence long-distance signalling by altering auxin transport. At the cellular level, BRs do appear to be transported. The enzymes for BR biosynthesis appear to be located within the cell, and to be associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, in particular. BR reception, on the other hand, is thought to occur on the exterior cell surface. Therefore, BRs must move from the interior of the cell to the exterior, where they are perceived by the same cell or by neighbouring cells. The existence of a feedback system, whereby bioactive BRs negatively regulate their own biosynthesis, provides further evidence that individual cells are able to both perceive and synthesize BRs...|$|E
40|$|Development of {{thylakoid}} membranes {{depends upon}} the transport of membrane vesicles from the chloroplast inner envelope and subsequent fusion of vesicles within {{the interior of the}} plastid. The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) Thylakoid formation 1 (Thf 1) gene product is shown here to control an important step required for the normal organization of these vesicles into mature thylakoid stacks and ultimately for leaf development. The Arabidopsis Thf 1 gene encodes an imported chloroplast protein, as shown by in vitro import and localization of a Thf 1 -green fluorescent protein fusion product in transgenic plants. This gene is conserved in oxygenic photoautotrophs ranging from cyanobacteria to flowering land plants. Transcript levels for Thf 1 are induced in the light and decrease under dark conditions, paralleling profiles of light-regulated nuclear genes involved in chloroplast function. Disruption of the Thf 1 gene via T-DNA insertion results in plants that are severely stunted with <b>variegated</b> <b>leaf</b> patterns. Nongreen sectors of variegated leaves lacking Thf 1 expression contain plastids that accumulate membrane vesicles on the interior and lack organized thylakoid structures. Green sectors of Thf 1 -disrupted leaves contain some chloroplasts that form organized thylakoid membranes, indicating that an inefficient compensatory mechanism supports thylakoid formation in the absence of Thf 1. Genetic complementation of a Thf 1 knockout line confirms the role of this gene in chloroplast and leaf development. Transgenic plants expressing the Thf 1 gene in antisense orientation are stunted with altered thylakoid organization, especially in young seedlings. The data indicate that the Thf 1 gene product plays a crucial role in a dynamic process of vesicle-mediated thylakoid membrane biogenesis...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of pale-green flecks on leaves (speckling) {{is a frequent}} character among herbaceous species from shady places and is usually due to local loosening of palisade tissue (air space type of variegation). In the winter-green Arum italicum L. (Araceae), dark-green areas of <b>variegated</b> <b>leaf</b> blades are ca. 400 mu m thick with a chlorophyll content of 1080 mg m(- 2) and a palisade parenchyma consisting of a double layer of oblong cells. Pale-green areas are 25 % thinner, have 26 % less chlorophyll and contain a single, loose layer of short palisade cells. Full-green leaves generally present only one compact layer of cylindrical palisade cells and the same pigment content as dark-green sectors, but the leaf blade is 13 % thinner. A spongy parenchyma with extensive air space is present in all leaf types. Green cells of all tissues have normal chloroplasts. Assays of photosynthetic activities by chlorophyll fluorescence imaging and 02 exchange measurements showed that variegated pale-green and dark-green sectors as well as full-green leaves have comparable photosynthetic activities on a leaf area basis at saturating illumination. However, full-green leaves require a higher saturating light with respect to variegated sectors, and pale-green sectors support relatively higher photosynthesis rates on a chlorophyll basis. We conclude that i) variegation in this species depends on number and organization of palisade cell layers and {{can be defined as}} a "variable palisade" type, and ii) the variegated habit has no limiting effects on the photosynthetic energy budget of A. italicum, consistent with the {{presence of}} variegated plants side by side to full-green ones in natural populations.

40|$|Plant embryo {{development}} is regulated by {{a network of}} transcription factors that include LEAFY COTYLEDON 1 (LEC 1), LEC 1 -LIKE (L 1 L), and B 3 domain factors, LEAFY COTYLEDON 2 (LEC 2), FUSCA 3 (FUS 3), and ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 3 (ABI 3) of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Interactions of these genes result in temporal progression of overlapping B 3 gene expression culminating in maturation and desiccation of the seed. Three VP 1 /ABI 3 -LIKE (VAL) genes encode B 3 proteins that include plant homeodomain-like and CW domains associated with chromatin factors. Whereas val monogenic mutants have phenotypes similar to wild type, val 1 val 2 double-mutant seedlings form no leaves and develop embryo-like proliferations in root and apical meristem regions. In a val 1 background, val 2 and val 3 condition a dominant <b>variegated</b> <b>leaf</b> phenotype revealing a VAL function in vegetative development. Reminiscent of the pickle (pkl) mutant, inhibition of gibberellin biosynthesis during germination induces embryonic phenotypes in val 1 seedlings. Consistent with the embryonic seedling phenotype, LEC 1, L 1 L, ABI 3, and FUS 3 are up-regulated in val 1 val 2 seedlings in association with a global shift in gene expression to a profile resembling late-torpedo-stage embryogenesis. Hence, VAL factors function as global repressors of the LEC 1 /B 3 gene system. The consensus binding site of the ABI 3 /FUS 3 /LEC 2 B 3 DNA-binding domain (Sph/RY) is strongly enriched in the promoters and first introns of VAL-repressed genes, including the early acting LEC 1 and L 1 L genes. We suggest that VAL targets Sph/RY-containing genes in the network for chromatin-mediated repression {{in conjunction with the}} PKL-related CHD 3 chromatin-remodeling factors...|$|E
40|$|Mutants with altered leaf {{morphology}} {{are useful}} as markers {{for the study}} of genetic systems and for probing the leaf differentiation process. One such mutant with deficient greening and altered development of the leaf mesophyll appeared in an inbred line of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.). The objectives of the present study were to determine the inheritance of the mutant leaf trait and its morphological characterisation. The mutation, named mesophyll cell defective 1 (mcd 1), has pleiotropic effects and it is inherited as a monogenic recessive. The structure and tissue organization of mcd 1 leaves are disrupted. In mcd 1 leaves, the mesophyll has prominent intercellular spaces, and palisade and spongy tissues are not properly shaped. The mutant palisade cells also appear to be more vacuolated and with a reduced number of chloroplasts than the wild type leaves of equivalent developmental stage. The lamina thickness of mcd 1 leaves is greatly variable and in some areas no mesophyll cells are present between the adaxial and abaxial epidermis. The leaf area of the mcd 1 mutant is extremely reduced as well as the stem height. A deficient accumulation of photosynthetic pigments characterizes both cotyledons and leaves of the mutant. In mcd 1 leaves, chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence imaging evidences a spatial heterogeneity of leaf photosynthetic performance. Little black points, which correspond to photosystem II (PSII) maximum efficiency (Fv/Fm) values close to zero, characterize the mcd 1 leaves. Similarly, the lightadapted quantum efficiency (ΦPSII) values show a homogeneous distribution over wild type leaf lamina, while the damaged areas in mcd 1 leaves, represented by yellow zones, are prominent. In conclusion, the loss of function of the MCD 1 gene in Helianthus annuus is correlated with a <b>variegated</b> <b>leaf</b> phenotype characterized by a localized destruction of mesophyll morphogenesis and defeat of PSII activity...|$|E
