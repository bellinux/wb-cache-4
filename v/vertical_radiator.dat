25|$|When first built, the car used a Napier Lion {{engine of}} around 500bhp. It was of {{conventional}} form with a front-mounted <b>vertical</b> <b>radiator</b> {{and the driver}} behind the engine. The three banks of the W-12 engine were hidden behind bulges in the narrow bonnet, with exhaust stub pipes protruding.|$|E
25|$|Since 1904, the fluted {{top surface}} to the {{radiator}} grille has been Daimler's distinguishing feature. This motif {{developed from the}} heavily finned water-cooling tubes slung externally {{at the front of}} early cars. Later, a more conventional, <b>vertical</b> <b>radiator</b> had a heavily finned header tank. Eventually these fins were echoed on a protective grille shell and, even later, on the rear licence plate holder.|$|E
2500|$|The large {{seaplane}} {{that emerged}} had {{a crew of}} three, accommodated in a long slim fuselage. The first aircraft (s/n 1415) was powered by two handed [...] Sunbeam Nubian engines driving four-bladed propellers, in nacelles sitting on the upper surface of the lower mainplanes. Cooling for the engines was achieved through <b>vertical</b> <b>radiator</b> blocks attached to the rear interplane struts {{on either side of}} the engine nacelles, which also supported the oil tanks for each engine.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Another type {{of large}} VLF antenna: the [...] "valley-span" [...] antenna, {{consisting}} of multiple horizontal topload cables spanning a valley, fed {{in the center}} by <b>vertical</b> <b>radiators.</b> This example is at the US Navy Jim Creek station near Seattle, which transmits on 24.8 kHz at a power of 1.2 MW.|$|R
2500|$|The {{principal}} {{difference between}} the two types was the engine. [...] The smaller Type 137 was designed for, and initially flown with, a 120hp (90kW) six-cylinder inline water-cooled Austro-Daimler, while the Type 138 had a 200hp (150kW) Salmson 2M7 14-cylinder water-cooled radial. [...] Engine choice determined the shape of the nose: the inline engine had a rectangular radiator mounted in front of it, projecting slightly above the upper fuselage line, whereas the radial was uncowled, with a pair of <b>vertical</b> <b>radiators</b> mounted in the small inner bays of the Type 138.|$|R
50|$|The short {{wavelengths}} also allow high gain antennas to be conveniently small. High gain antennas for point-to-point communication links and UHF television reception are usually Yagi, log periodic, corner reflectors, or reflective array antennas. At {{the top end}} of the band slot antennas and parabolic dishes become practical. For satellite communication, helical, and turnstile antennas are used since satellites typically employ circular polarization which is not sensitive to the relative orientation of the transmitting and receiving antennas. For television broadcasting specialized <b>vertical</b> <b>radiators</b> that are mostly modifications of the slot antenna or helical antenna are used: the slotted cylinder, zig-zag, and panel antennas.|$|R
5000|$|On April 5, 2016 WNVA {{was granted}} a Federal Communications Commission {{construction}} permit {{to move to a}} new transmitter site. Instead of using a conventional steel <b>vertical</b> <b>radiator</b> used by most stations it would use an 85-foot whip antenna. The steel <b>vertical</b> <b>radiator</b> currently in use is 360 feet.|$|E
50|$|The station {{includes}} three radio masts, including two standard lattice masts and one Blaw-Knox diamond cantilever <b>vertical</b> <b>radiator.</b> The two standard lattice masts have a wire slung T-antenna suspended between them. The Blaw-Knox radiator {{is the only}} one of its kind in Western Europe. The height of a <b>vertical</b> <b>radiator</b> is related to the frequency (or wavelength) of the service transmitted, and for maximum efficiency should be one half of the station's wavelength. Its height was originally 144.8 m, but it was shortened when the station's broadcast frequency was changed.|$|E
50|$|Faced {{with the}} same {{conundrum}} of appearing modern, an envelope body at odds with a mandatory trademark, a <b>vertical</b> <b>radiator</b> grille, Rolls-Royce could do little better in autumn 1955 than offer a razor-edged 1941 Packard Clipper, albeit with a curved, one-piece windshield, as their new Silver Cloud and concurrent Bentley S-series.|$|E
5000|$|This type of {{antenna array}} {{is called a}} trideco or {{umbrella}} antenna, {{one of the only}} type of antenna which can radiate power efficiently at the low 24 kHz frequency used. It functions as a capacitively top-loaded electrically short monopole antenna. Vertical wires at the central mast of the antenna radiates the VLF radio waves, while the suspended horizontal cable array functions as a large capacitor, increasing the efficiency of the <b>vertical</b> <b>radiators,</b> At the base of each mast is a star-shaped network of cables suspended a few feet above the ground, extending out hundreds of feet, called a [...] counterpoise, which serves as the bottom plate of the [...] "capacitor".|$|R
2500|$|The Nieuport 15 was a twin bay un-staggered wing sequiplane with V-struts and a newly {{designed}} tailplane including heart shaped elevators. It was {{powered by a}} [...] Renault 12F V-12 engine. [...] featuring Hazet <b>vertical</b> tube <b>radiators.</b>|$|R
50|$|WSAJ {{broadcast}} from Rockwell Science Hall {{on the college}} campus. The station {{was one of the}} last to use a horizontal longwire antenna, which in WSAJ's case was strung between 2 wooden poles, instead of more modern <b>vertical</b> tower <b>radiators.</b>|$|R
50|$|When first built, the car used a Napier Lion {{engine of}} around 500 bhp. It was of {{conventional}} form with a front-mounted <b>vertical</b> <b>radiator</b> {{and the driver}} behind the engine. The three banks of the W-12 engine were hidden behind bulges in the narrow bonnet, with exhaust stub pipes protruding.|$|E
50|$|In 1929, the Regia Marina again {{organized}} a contest for an M.7 ter replacement. Macchi produced {{a new version}} of the M.41, dubbed the M.41 bis, which differed from the M.41 chiefly in having a <b>vertical</b> <b>radiator.</b> It performed better than the SIAI S.58ter in the contest, and this time Macchi was awarded a contract to produce 41 M.41 bis aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Since 1904, the fluted {{top surface}} to the {{radiator}} grille has been Daimler's distinguishing feature. This motif {{developed from the}} heavily finned water-cooling tubes slung externally {{at the front of}} early cars.

Eventually these fins were echoed on a protective grille shell and, even later, on the rear licence plate holder.|$|E
50|$|A TURF (Tuning Unit Radio Frequency) is an Antenna Tuning Unit or ATU. It {{is used to}} artificially {{lengthen}} {{the antenna}} (or tune it) Often at HF wavelengths for example an antenna would be physically too long to attach to a radio without affecting portability and manoeuvrability. A shorter vehicle whip was more practicable and also field antennas were constructed with for example, <b>vertical</b> <b>radiators</b> constructed using the Racal 8 or 12 metre masts. Because these were an electrical compromise, {{they had to be}} tuned by use of a TURF (or electrically matched to the set). The TURF 25 Watt (a separate unit to the radio) is considered mandatory when using the VRC321 it tunes both unbalanced, end fed wires and whips and also balanced antenna such as the dipole.|$|R
50|$|There {{were two}} main models {{produced}} during the production run. The earlier model is easily {{identified with the}} <b>vertical</b> chrome bar <b>radiator</b> grill and was assembled between November 1967 and March 1970. The later model, with the black pressed metal radiator grill and slim bumber bars was assembled between April 1970 and December 1971. As {{there had not been}} any earlier Midget models assembled in Australia prior to these, these cars are sometimes referred to as Australian Mark 1 and Mark 2 Midgets.|$|R
40|$|On the moon, the {{available}} heat sink temperature for a <b>vertical</b> unshaded <b>radiator</b> at the equator is 322 K. A method of reducing this heat sink temperature using a parabolic trough shading device was investigated. A steady state heat balance {{was performed to}} predict {{the available}} heat sink temperature. The effect of optical surface properties on system performance was investigated. Various geometric configurations were also evaluated. A flexible shade conceptual design is presented which greatly reduces the weight and stowed volume of the system. The concept makes use of the natural catenary shape assumed by a flexible material when supported at two points. The catenary shape is very near parabolic. The lunar radiator parabolic shade design presented integrates the energy collection and rejection of a solar dynamic power cycle with the moderate temperature waste heat rejection of a lunar habitat...|$|R
50|$|Vehicle chassis was {{fabricated}} in two pieces, {{largely from}} large iron or steel castings. The nose of early models was distinctively solid and sloped, when other makers had a <b>vertical</b> <b>radiator</b> grille. Later models, after experience in Australia, also gained a lightweight steel grille for better ventilation. The chassis unbolted relatively quickly, two hours being cited, into front (engine) and rear (transmission) components.|$|E
50|$|The Tiger Cub was powered {{initially}} by a Leyland O350H 91bhp 5.76-litre diesel engine, {{a horizontal}} {{version of the}} engine fitted to the Comet 90. It had a newly designed lightweight high straight frame with a <b>vertical</b> <b>radiator</b> set just behind the front axle. The launch transmission was the same four-speed constant mesh unit which {{had been used in}} the Tiger PS1, Titan PD1 and their export equivalents.|$|E
5000|$|The large {{seaplane}} {{that emerged}} had {{a crew of}} three, accommodated in a long slim fuselage. The first aircraft (s/n 1415) was powered by two handed [...] Sunbeam Nubian engines driving four-bladed propellers, in nacelles sitting on the upper surface of the lower mainplanes. Cooling for the engines was achieved through <b>vertical</b> <b>radiator</b> blocks attached to the rear interplane struts {{on either side of}} the engine nacelles, which also supported the oil tanks for each engine.|$|E
50|$|They {{are used}} as {{transmitting}} antennas below 1 MHz, in the LF and particularly the VLF bands, at frequencies sufficiently low that it is impractical to build a full size quarter-wave monopole antenna. Either the central mast itself, insulated from the ground, {{is connected to the}} transmitter and serves as the radiating element, or vertical wires parallel to the mast. At the low frequencies used the height of the mast is typically 1/10 to 1/40 of a wavelength, so it makes a very electrically short antenna, and by itself would have very low radiation resistance and be a very inefficient radiator. The function of the umbrella-wires is to add capacitance {{to the top of the}} antenna, improving the current distribution on the <b>vertical</b> mast <b>radiator</b> to increase the radiation resistance and radiated power. The umbrella wires serve as the plate of a capacitor, with the ground serving as the other plate, which is charged and discharged by the radio frequency current from the tramsmitter. Umbrella antennas with heights of 15 to 460 metres are in service. The tallest umbrella antennas are actually used by Lualualei VLF transmitter, INS Kattabomman and the CHAYKA-transmitters at Inta and Dudinka.|$|R
50|$|A simple {{anti-fading}} antenna is a <b>vertical</b> <b>radiator</b> whose {{height is}} between 1/2 wavelength (180 electrical degrees) and 5/9 wavelength (200 degrees), 195 degrees being considered ideal. 200 degree and taller simple radiators have largely fallen into disuse, although {{these can be}} useful on medium power stations, in which case radiators as tall as 5/8 wavelength (225 degrees) are somewhat common. Any simple radiator (or array of radiators) which is taller than 195 degrees is generally not considered to have anti-fading properties.|$|E
50|$|At {{the time}} of initial {{establishment}} Radio 4QR operated from a city location. For many years now Radio 4QR has shared (with Radio 4QG, now 4RN) a tall dual anti-fading guyed and sectionalised <b>vertical</b> <b>radiator</b> of 198 metres AGL with structural capacitative top hat located at Bald Hills on the northern outskirts of Brisbane. The mast is a very prominent feature visible from major highways in the vicinity. There is a shorter (81 metres AGL) vertical guyed radiator on the site which provides a standby capability during main antenna maintenance.|$|E
5000|$|The first Wullenwever {{was built}} {{during the war}} at Skibsby, {{north-east}} {{of the city of}} Hjørring (in German: Hjörring), Denmark (...) [...] It used forty <b>vertical</b> <b>radiator</b> elements, placed on the arc of a circle with a diameter of 120 m. Forty reflecting elements were installed behind the radiator elements, suspended on a circular wooden support structure with a diameter of 112.5 meters. To more easily obtain true geographic bearings, the north and south elements were placed exactly on the North-South meridian. The Soviet Krug arrays also use the 40 radiator Wullenwever configuration.|$|E
5000|$|Introduced in January 1904 Cadillac's Model B {{was similar}} to their Model A, sharing its engine but using a pressed-steel frame and axles and the Model B was on a longer 76 in wheelbase. The front axle is {{described}} as girder-style. It supported the car through a single transverse half-elliptic spring. The sloping dash {{was replaced by a}} detachable box-like front to the body and a <b>vertical</b> <b>radiator.</b> All body styles lost as much as 70 pounds weight. Prices went up $50. The car was advertised as having [...] but there were no changes to the design of the engine.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the time}} of initial {{establishment}} Radio 4QG operated from the Executive Buildings in Brisbane City. The [...] "big transmitter" [...] was commissioned {{on the roof of}} the State Insurance Building in Brisbane City. For many years now Radio 4QG/4RN has shared (with Radio 4QR) a tall dual anti-fading guyed and sectionalised <b>vertical</b> <b>radiator</b> of 198 metres AGL with structural capacitative top hat located at Bald Hills on the northern outskirts of Brisbane. The mast is a very prominent feature visible from major highways in the vicinity. There is a shorter (81 metres AGL) vertical guyed radiator on the site which provides a standby capability during main antenna maintenance.|$|E
5000|$|T and {{inverted}} L [...] - [...] Consist {{of a long}} {{horizontal wire}} suspended between two towers with insulators, with a vertical wire hanging down from it, attached to a feedline to the receiver or transmitter. Used on LF and VLF bands. The vertical wire serves as the radiator. Since at these frequencies the vertical wire is electrically short, much shorter than a quarter wavelength, the horizontal wire(s) serve as a capacitive [...] "hat" [...] to increase the current in the <b>vertical</b> <b>radiator,</b> increasing the gain. Very narrow bandwidth, requires loading coil to tune out any remaining capacitive reactance. Requires low resistance ground (electricity).|$|E
5000|$|Under the Agreement, most {{existing}} stations {{operating on}} 740 kHz or higher {{would have to}} change frequencies. Open frequencies were created throughout the band by [...] "stretching out" [...] the existing assignments, achieved by following a table which in most cases moved all the stations on a common frequency to a new, higher, dial position. This provided gaps of unassigned frequencies, most of which became clear channels allocated to Mexico and Canada. A majority of the frequency shifts were limited to between 10 and 30 kHz, which conserved the electrical height of a station's existing <b>vertical</b> <b>radiator</b> towers, an important factor for readjusting directional antenna parameters to accommodate the new frequency.|$|E
50|$|By 1935, the {{engineering}} staff of WGY {{began to make}} plans to replace the T top antenna system with a single <b>vertical</b> <b>radiator</b> {{in the form of}} a tower. At the time, the station was plagued with signal fading at a distance of 30-100 miles from the transmitter site due to cancellation by out of phase co-channel signals from the same source. The ideas for this tower were formed from experiments at WJZ in New York. From this, a square, one half wavelength (on 790 kHz), 625 foot tower was constructed in 1938. The one half wavelength design greatly reduced high angle radiation, thus solved the close in fading issues. This tower is still in use today.|$|E
5000|$|... 1050 kHz {{has been}} a Mexican Clear Channel since 1941 (and was a U.S. Clear Channel before 1941). American {{stations}} operating on Mexican Clear Channel frequencies were restricted to 1,000 watts and had to sign-off at sunset, until the [...] "Rio" [...] treaty took effect in the late 1980s. Before 1941, 1020 kHz (WDZ's previous dial position) was a U.S. Clear Channel and that, too, was restricted. After [...] "Rio" [...] took effect, {{it was a simple}} matter for WDZ to add night operations with the maximum power permitted, 250 watts. Today the station is still operating with its pre-"Rio" [...] maximum daytime power and its post-"Rio" [...] minimum nighttime power. Anything more than 1,000 watts days and 250 watts nights very likely would require installation of a directional antenna system at great capital expense. WDZ is diplexed (i.e., it uses the very same <b>vertical</b> <b>radiator)</b> with co-owned 1340 WSOY.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{the ground}} waves {{used in this}} band require {{vertical}} polarization, vertical antennas are used for transmission, usually mast radiators, either insulated {{from the ground and}} fed at the bottom, or occasionally fed through guy-wires. T-antennas and inverted L-antennas are used when antenna height is an issue. Nearly all LF antennas are electrically short, shorter than one quarter of the radiated wavelength, so their low radiation resistance makes them inefficient, requiring very low resistance grounds and conductors to avoid dissipating transmitter power. These electrically short antennas need loading coils of high inductance to bring them into resonance. Many antenna types, such as the umbrella antenna and L- and T-antenna, use capacitive top-loading (a [...] "top hat"), {{in the form of a}} network of horizontal wires attached to the top of the <b>vertical</b> <b>radiator.</b> The capacitance improves the efficiency of the antenna without increasing its height or its supporting structures.|$|E
5000|$|In 1930, Macchi built a {{new version}} of its M.41bis flying boat fighter {{designed}} for launching by catapult from warships of the Regia Marina (Italian Royal Navy). The new aircraft, the M.71, built to the same dimensions as the M.41bis and aerodynamically very clean for an aircraft of its type, was identical to the M.41bis in most ways, being a wooden, single-seat, single-bay biplane armed with two fixed, forward-firing 7.7 mm machine guns, plywood and fabric skinning, unstaggered wings of equal span, a [...] Fiat A.20 engine driving a pusher propeller mounted on struts above the hull and below the upper wing, and fitted with a <b>vertical</b> <b>radiator.</b> It differed from the M.41bis in having a stronger wing cellule and catapult pick-up points and, to facilitate rapid assembly and disassambly during shipboard operations, it had inclined steel tube struts between the hull, interplane struts, and upper wing section instead of the M.41biss bracing wires.|$|E
5000|$|A {{more complex}} {{anti-fading}} antenna is a <b>vertical</b> <b>radiator</b> which is sectionalized {{and is one}} wavelength (360 degrees, generally 180 over 180 degrees, and historically and correctly termed a [...] "Franklin" [...] radiator; two in an array at KFBK), or 300 degrees (180 over 120 degrees, and formally called a WHO radiator), or 240 degrees (120 over 120 degrees, and formally called a WOAI radiator, but WOAI has since replaced this with a 195 degree radiator for lower maintenance cost {{at the expense of}} somewhat poorer [...] "fringe" [...] reception). Several have been incorporated into phased arrays (directional antennas). When so sectionalized the sections are themselves phased so as to provide the optimum vertical radiation pattern (suppressing high-angle radiation). An advantage of the 180 over 180 degree configuration is no ground radial system is required, and the bottom of the lower section may be insulated from the ground; for the others, the bottom of the lower section is usually connected to a ground radial system through a capacitor.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "multiple-tuned flattop antenna" [...] is {{a variant}} of the T antenna used in high power low {{frequency}} transmitters to reduce ground power losses. [...] It consists of a long capacitive top-load consisting of multiple parallel wires supported by a line of transmission towers, sometimes several miles long. Several <b>vertical</b> <b>radiator</b> wires hang down from the top-load, each attached to its own ground through a loading coil. The antenna is driven either at one of the radiator wires, or more often {{at one end of the}} top-load, by bringing the wires of the top-load diagonally down to the transmitter. Although the vertical wires are separated, the distance between them is small compared to the length of the LF waves, so the currents in them are in phase and they can be considered as one radiator. Since the antenna current flows into the ground through N parallel loading coils and grounds rather than one, the equivalent loading coil and ground resistance, and therefore the power dissipated in the loading coil and ground, is reduced to 1/N that of a simple T antenna. [...] The antenna was used in the powerful radio stations of the wireless telegraphy era but has fallen out of favor due to the expense of multiple loading coils.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the end of}} World War I, the Renault company {{used its}} {{experience}} in armored tanks to devise agricultural vehicles. The Renault's Department 14 (responsible for the FT tank) developed the first tractor of the company, the Type GP, which was powered by an engine {{similar to that of}} the FT (a four-cylinder) and had tracks. The most distinguishable differences of the new tractor with the FT were the front-engine design and the reduced weight. The tractors were assembled in Renault's Billancourt factory since 11 November 1918 on the same production lines that the tanks and tested at Louis Renault's farm in Herqueville. The Type HO introduced in 1921 replaced the tracks by more conventional wheels. In 1926, Renault introduced the Type PE which was extensively revised compared to its predecessors, incorporating a new engine with reduced consumes and a <b>vertical</b> <b>radiator.</b> In 1931, with the PE1, the radiator was moved from the middle position used in the previous models to the front and, in 1933, the model became the first France-produced rubber-wheeled tractor. The company also started to develop versions for specific markets, as vineyards. With the aim of reducing the fuel costs, it introduced its first diesel-engined model, the Type VI, in 1932. By 1938, Renault was producing about 40 tractors per month and was the largest French manufacturer.|$|E
