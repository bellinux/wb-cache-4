25|$|After {{three years}} at the Naval War College, Colbert was {{assigned}} to the Long Range Plans and Basic War Plans Branch of the Joint Staff. In 1960 he became commanding officer of the Sixth Fleet's general stores ship Altair, based in Barcelona, Spain, where he helped pioneer the use of helicopters for <b>vertical</b> <b>replenishment</b> of supplies for ships at sea.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} abeam {{replenishment}} at sea (RAS) stations for diesel oil, aviation fuel and fresh water. The flight deck and helicopter hangar allow <b>vertical</b> <b>replenishment</b> at sea. The flight deck {{is large and}} strong enough for a Chinook helicopter to land on.

50|$|Vega {{returned}} to San Francisco, California, on 4 August, following a circuitous route via Cebu and Subic Bay, Philippines; Hong Kong, British Crown Colony; Buckner Bay, Okinawa; and Pearl Harbor. A tally of the ships' activities on her most eventful WestPac cruise showed {{the ship to}} have completed some 105 underway, 15 boat, and 38 <b>vertical</b> <b>replenishments</b> -— the last utilizing the capabilities of helicopters for rapid and increased transport of supplies from ship to ship. A total of some 2,848.9 tons of provisions, including 136.8 tons of refugee supplies, were transferred. The ship then underwent restricted availability from 18 to 19 August. For {{the remainder of the}} ship's active service career with the United States Navy, Vega operated off the U.S. West Coast, conducting local operations, and later deployed to the Philippines, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, and Okinawa for her final WestPac deployment. She arrived at San Francisco on 21 December 1976 and immediately commenced leave and upkeep.|$|R
25|$|Following the Sea Knight's {{first flight}} in August 1962, the {{military}} designation {{was changed to}} CH-46A. During November 1964, {{the introduction of the}} Marines' CH-46A and the Navy's UH-46As commenced. The UH-46A variant was {{a modified version of the}} rotorcraft to perform the <b>vertical</b> <b>replenishment</b> mission. The CH-46A was equipped with a pair of T58-GE8-8B turboshaft engines, each being rated at 1,250 shp (930kW); these allowed the Sea Knight to carry up to 17 passengers or a maximum of 4,000 pounds (1,815kg) of cargo.|$|E
25|$|On 18 October 2010 Ronald Reagan {{departed}} for its Composite Training Unit Exercise. Over {{the next three}} weeks, flight operations were conducted nearly continuously under simulated combat conditions. Ronald Reagan also simulated a straits transit with four ships from the strike group, participated in three opposed replenishments at sea, a <b>vertical</b> <b>replenishment,</b> and ran many general quarters and man overboard drills. On 9 November 2010, the Reagan was diverted to provide assistance to the disabled cruise ship Carnival Splendor (pictured). On 14 November, the Ronald Reagan and its embarked carrier air wing completed its COMPTUEX successfully, and it returned to port on 17 December 2010.|$|E
25|$|The new gunboat {{arrived at}} the Naval Amphibious Base in Coronado, California, her home port, in July 1968. She {{conducted}} operational evaluation tests and participated in exercises with the U.S. Pacific Fleet. In addition, she conducted day and night operations with Fleet ships ranging from cruisers to conventional patrol craft. After a year of operating out of Coronado, Tucumcari was deployed to Vietnamese waters. She {{spent most of her}} six months in the combat zone assigned to Operation Market Time, the coastal patrol established to stop the flow from North Vietnam of Communist arms and infiltrators. While performing this duty, she logged 200 hours of foilborne operations including day and night, all-weather, and high sea state missions. She also conducted underway replenishments with larger Fleet units and <b>vertical</b> <b>replenishment</b> from helicopters. The latter included medical evacuation operations and the transfers of cargo and fuel.|$|E
2500|$|On 10 September 2014, the {{commander}} of the U.S. 7th Fleet announced that Fort Worth would deploy to the Asia-Pacific region in January 2015. [...] The ship will be used to expand operational envelopes that were not done by the previous deployment of USS Freedom to the region, particularly concerning the mine counter measures (MCM) package. Emphasis on MCM is based on periodic provocations made by North Korea, which has deployed sea mines around the peninsula that have sunk South Korean vessels in the past, so the Navy wants to test the MCM mission in and around the Korean peninsula. Another area of focus is to use the ship to provide [...] "non-traditional" [...] maritime lift for U.S. Marines due to constraints in the number of big deck amphibious vessels available to the 7th Fleet. [...] Operational trials made by [...] Freedom also showed the potential to improve <b>vertical</b> lift <b>replenishment</b> in shallow waters. She deployed with the surface warfare mission-equipment package and was the first LCS deployment with the MQ-8B.|$|R
40|$|A linked {{chain of}} causal factors—namely, winter air temperature, spring lake temperature, {{extent of the}} spring lake overturn, and extent of surface {{nutrient}} enrichment—had significant effects on the annual development of phytoplankton structure and biomass in Lake Garda, a large (49 3 109 m 3), deep (350 m) lake located south of the Alps. The relationship between the winter climate and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) was unclear, probably because of {{the location of the}} lake, which was on the border between different centers of action of the NAO (the Mediterranean region and central and northern Europe). Soon after the major enrichment episodes, conjugatophytes and large diatoms developed with higher biovolumes during April, whereas from midsummer to midautumn, the cyanobacteria and, more irregularly, the conjugatophytes were more important. In two other deep southern subalpine lakes (Iseo and Lugano), the interannual variations in the extent of spring <b>vertical</b> mixing, nutrient <b>replenishment,</b> and phytoplankton development were closely related because of the common effects of winter climate on the subalpine region. The effect was proportionally more evident in the two meromictic and more eutrophic lakes, Iseo and Lugano, because of the higher nutrient content in their hypolimnia. External nutrient loads and the consequent overall content of algal nutrients do not exclusively control the trophic statu...|$|R
5000|$|Underway from Subic Bay on 23 April, Vega sailed for {{the coast}} of South Vietnam. By this juncture, the {{government}} of South Vietnam was collapsing, leaving tons of American-supplied equipment intact for the communist forces. Operation Frequent Wind was launched to evacuate Americans, at-risk Vietnamese and third country nationals, lest they be left behind and fall into communist hands. For the next few days, Vega replenished United States and South Vietnamese Navy ships, delivered passengers and mail, and transferred refugee supplies to vessels loaded with fleeing South Vietnamese. Underway at sea from 25 to 30 April, the supply ship arrived off Vung Tau on 1 May and replenished South Vietnamese naval units YFU-69, HQ-3, HQ-800, and HQ-801 as well as conducted a <b>vertical</b> fleet supply <b>replenishment</b> with Mars (AFS-1) and fleet supplies and mail for five other Navy ships. Heading for Subic Bay, Vega served as escort for the [...] "New Life" [...] flotilla, heavily laden with Vietnamese refugees and their belongings. Arriving at Subic Bay on the 6th, she stood in with the first contingent of refugee vessels—some 70 craft in all, of all shapes and sizes. Underway for a resumption of escort duties later that day, Vega stood out to sea; she subsequently refueled from Taluga (T-AO-62) on the 7th before conducting underway replenishments {{over the next two}} days with Midway (CVA-41), Badger (DE-1071), and Ashtabula (AO-51). Arriving at Subic Bay on 10 May to load supplies, she got underway soon thereafter, in company with Harold E. Holt (DE-1074), for refugee vessel escort duties.|$|R
