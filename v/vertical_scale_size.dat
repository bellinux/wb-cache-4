40|$|This report {{presents}} the first {{estimates of the}} three-dimensional volume emission rate of enhanced O(1 D) 6300 Å airglow caused by HF radio wave pumping in the ionosphere. Images of the excitation show how the initially speckled spatial structure of excitation changes to a simpler shape with a smaller region that contains most of the excitation. A region of enhanced airglow was imaged by three stations in the Auroral Large Imaging System (ALIS) in northern Scandinavia. These images allowed for a tomography-like inversion of the volume emission of the airglow. The altitude of maximum emission {{was found to be}} around 235 ± 5 km with typical horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>scale</b> <b>sizes</b> of 20 km. The shape of the O(1 D) excitation rate varied from flatish to elongated along the magnetic field. The altitude of maximum emission is found to be approximately 10 km below the altitude of the enhanced ion line and 15 km above the altitude of maximum electron temperature. Comparisons of the measured altitude and temporal variations of the 6300 Å emission with modelled emission caused by O(1 D) excitation from the high energy tail of a Maxwellian electron distribution show significant deviations. The 6300 Å emission from excitation of the high energy tail is about a factor of 4 too large compared with what is observed. This shows that the source of O(1 D) excitation is electrons from a “sub-thermal” distribution function, i. e. the electron distribution is Maxwellian at low energies and at energies above 1. 96 eV there is a depletion...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1998 Despite the {{critical}} ecological roles of structural features in forests, ecologically relevant quantitative measures of structure that allow comparisons among forest stands are still limited. A new index, the structural complexity index (SCI), {{was developed to}} characterize and compare the structural complexity of different forests. Point patterns of stem-mapped trees were converted into nearest neighbor triangles (with x, y, and z coordinates) by spatial tessellation, where x and y represent horizontal spatial location of points, and z represents a character of the point like height or diameter. The SCI {{was defined as the}} sum of the surface areas of a network of non-overlapping triangles, which form a continuous faceted surface in 3 -D. Structural gradients were defined as the maximum size difference among the trees forming a triangle, with greater differences indicating higher structure. To compare structure at different <b>vertical</b> <b>scales,</b> <b>size</b> differences among neighbors that are below a certain magnitude (grain) are considered similar, trees sizes are set equal, giving a lower SCI limit of 1. The SCI was found to be strongly related to tree size variation, tree density, density of emergent canopy trees (> 100 cm dbh), and species mixture in multiple-aged stands. Different structural conditions were simulated by randomly assigning values of the tree size distribution to each tree position while holding the tree positions fixed, allowing an assessment of the maximum possible structural complexity (potential structure) given the observed tree size distribution. Based on the observed or effective structure and the potential structure, the 'maximum structure hypothesis for natural mixed conifer forests" was proposed, stating that in the absence of large-scale, stand replacement disturbances and in the presence of small-scale disturbances associated with mortality and replacement of individual trees, the effective structure is near the potential structure. There was strong evidence in young and mature stands in favor of the maximum structure hypothesis, but stands resembling old-growth structures had effective structures less that their potential. Although rejected in its simplistic form, the maximum structure hypothesis may prove to be a powerful concept in the analysis of forest ecosystems...|$|R

40|$|With scant {{research}} {{to draw upon}} {{with respect to the}} maintenance of <b>vertical</b> <b>scales</b> over time, decisions around the creation and performance of <b>vertical</b> <b>scales</b> over time necessarily suffers {{due to the lack of}} information. Undetected item parameter drift (IPD) presents one of the greatest threats to scale maintenance within an item response theory (IRT) framework. There is also still an outstanding question as to the utility of the Rasch model as an underlying viable framework for establishing and maintaining <b>vertical</b> <b>scales.</b> Even so, this model is currently used for scaling many state assessment systems. Most criticisms of the Rasch model in this context have not involved simulation. And most have not acknowledged conditions in which the model may function sufficiently to justify its use in <b>vertical</b> <b>scaling.</b> ^ To address these questions, <b>vertical</b> <b>scales</b> were created from real data using the Rasch and 3 PL models. Ability estimates were then generated to simulate a second (Time 2) administration. These simulated data were placed onto the base <b>vertical</b> <b>scales</b> using a horizontal <b>vertical</b> <b>scaling</b> approach and a mean-mean transformation. To examine the effects of IPD on <b>vertical</b> <b>scale</b> maintenance, several conditions of IPD were simulated to occur within each set of linking items. In order to evaluate the viability of using the Rasch model within a <b>vertical</b> <b>scaling</b> context, data were generated and calibrated at Time 2 within each model (Rasch and 3 PL) as well as across each model (Rasch data generataion/ 3 PL calibration, and vice versa). ^ Results pertaining the first question of the effect IPD has on <b>vertical</b> <b>scale</b> maintenance demonstrate that IPD has an effect directly related to percentage of drifting linking items, the magnitude of IPD exhibited, and the direction. With respect to the viability of using the Rasch model within a <b>vertical</b> <b>scaling</b> context, results suggest that the Rasch model is perfectly viable within a <b>vertical</b> <b>scaling</b> context in which the model is appropriate for the data. It is also clearly evident that where data involve varying discrimination and guessing, use of the Rasch model is inappropriate. ...|$|R

The measurements have a time span of almost 7 years (2000 – 06) and provide {{insights into the}} temporal <b>scales</b> and <b>vertical</b> structure of variability at intermediate depths. Variability in the zonal velocity component records is dominated by semiannual, annual, and interannual fluctuations. At semiannual and annual periodicities, <b>vertical</b> <b>scales</b> are large, {{on the order of}} 2000 stretched meters (sm), and show upward phase propagation. In contrast, interannual variability is associated with small <b>vertical</b> <b>scale</b> flows, called equatorial deep jets (EDJs), presenting downward phase propagation most of the time. Fitting a plane wave to these small vertical-scale flows leads to velocity amplitude, <b>vertical</b> <b>scale,</b> and temporal scale estimates of 8 (normalized) cm s − 1, 440 sm, and 4. 4 yr. However, this plane wave cannot explain all the variability presenting small <b>vertical</b> <b>scales.</b> Indeed, the data suggest that, along with a seasonal cycle of much larger <b>vertical</b> <b>scale,</b> different features with EDJ <b>vertical</b> <b>scale</b> coexist, with the possibility of a semipermanent eastward jet at around 1500 sm.

40|$|Developmental score scales {{represent}} {{the performance of}} students along a continuum, where as students learn more they move higher along that continuum. Unidimensional item response theory (UIRT) <b>vertical</b> <b>scaling</b> has become a commonly used method to create developmental score scales. Research has shown that UIRT <b>vertical</b> <b>scaling</b> methods can be inconsistent in estimating grade-to-grade growth, within-grade variability, and separation of grade distributions (effect size) of developmental score scale. In particular the finding of scale shrinkage (decreasing within-grade score variability as grade-level increases) has led to concerns about and criticism of IRT <b>vertical</b> <b>scales.</b> The causes of scale shrinkage {{have yet to be}} fully understood. Real test data and simulation studies have been unable to provide complete answers as to why IRT <b>vertical</b> <b>scaling</b> inconsistencies occur. Violations of assumptions have been a commonly cited potential cause for the inconsistent results. For this reason, this dissertation is an extensive investigation into how violations of the three assumptions of UIRT <b>vertical</b> <b>scaling</b> - local item dependence, unidimensionality, and similar reliability of grade level tests - affect estimated developmental score scales. Simulated tests were developed that purposefully violated a UIRT <b>vertical</b> <b>scaling</b> assumption. Three sets of simulated tests were created to test the effect of violating a single assumption. First, simulated tests were created with increasing, decreasing, low, medium, and high local item dependence. Second, multidimensional simulated tests were created by varying the correlation between dimensions. Third, simulated tests with dissimilar reliability were created by varying item parameters characteristics of the grade level tests. Multiple versions of twelve simulated tests were used to investigate UIRT <b>vertical</b> <b>scaling</b> assumption violations. The simulated tests were calibrated under the UIRT model to purposefully violate an assumption of UIRT <b>vertical</b> <b>scaling.</b> Each simulated test version was replicated for 1000 random examinee samples to assess the bias and standard error of estimated grade-to-grade-growth, within-grade-variability, and separation-of-grade-distributions (effect size) of the estimated developmental score scales. The results suggest that when UIRT <b>vertical</b> <b>scaling</b> assumptions are violated the resulting estimated developmental score scales contain standard error and bias. For this study, the magnitude of standard error was similar across all simulated tests regardless of the assumption violation. However, bias fluctuated as a result of different types and magnitudes of UIRT <b>vertical</b> <b>scaling</b> assumption violations. More local item dependence resulted in more grade-to-grade-growth and separation-of-grade-distributions bias. And local item dependence resulted in developmental score scales that displayed scale expansion. Multidimensionality resulted in more grade-to-grade-growth and separation-of-grade-distributions bias when the correlation between dimensions was smaller. Multidimensionality resulted in developmental score scales that displayed scale expansion. Dissimilar reliability of grade level tests resulted in more grade-to-grade-growth bias and minimal separation-of-grade-distributions bias. Dissimilar reliability of grade level tests resulted in scale expansion or scale shrinkage depending on the item characteristics of the test.

30|$|There are {{a number}} and variety of (micro-) {{benchmark}} results reported for Cloud CPU, Disk IO, Memory, network, and so on, usually involving Amazon Web Services (AWS) [7 – 13]. Often such results reveal performance {{with respect to the}} benchmark code for AWS and possibly contrast it with a second system – though not always. It becomes the task of the interested user, then, to try to assemble disparate distributed tests, potentially with numerous different parameter settings – some revealed, some not – into a readily understandable form of comparison. Many may balk at the need for such efforts simply in order to obtain a sense of what might be reasonably suitable for their purposes – {{in much the same way}} as they might simply see that a physical server has a decent CPU and is affordable to them. Gray [14] identified four criteria for a successful benchmark: (i) relevance to an application domain; (ii) portability to allow benchmarking of different systems; (iii) scalability to support benchmarking large systems; and (iv) simplicity so the results are understandable. There are, however, benchmarks that could be considered domain independent – or rather the results would be of interest in several domains depending on the nature of the problems to be solved – as well as those that are domain specific. Benchmarks measuring general characteristics of (virtualized) physical resources are likely feature here. Portability is an ideal characteristic, and there may be limitations to portability which will affect the ability to run on certain systems or with certain type of Cloud resources. In terms of scalability, we can break these into two types – horizontal scaling, involving the use of a number of machines running in parallel, and <b>vertical</b> <b>scaling,</b> involving different <b>sizes</b> of individual machines. In terms of the performance of each Cloud instance, <b>vertical</b> <b>scaling</b> is more of interest here. In addition, understandable results depend, in part, on who needs to understand them.

40|$|<b>Vertical</b> <b>scales</b> are {{typically}} {{developed for the}} purpose of quantifying achievement growth. In practice, it is commonly assumed that all of the scaled tests measure a single construct; however, in many instances there are strong theoretical and empirical reasons to suspect that the construct of interest is multidimensional. By modeling and scaling the tests unidimensionally, interpretations of growth are likely to be distorted. As such, there may be value in developing multidimensional <b>vertical</b> <b>scales</b> to allow for examinations of growth on different dimensions. Empirical data from Colorado 2 ̆ 7 s large-scale math assessment is used to examine 1) sufficient conditions for establishing a multidimensional <b>vertical</b> <b>scale</b> and 2) the extent to which interpretations of growth are distorted when tests are vertically scaled multidimensionally versus unidimensionally. A super test linking design is developed that allows items to be pooled over multiple years {{to increase the number of}} common items in establishing the multidimensional <b>vertical</b> <b>scale.</b> Based on this design, a resampling approach is used to examine linking error related to the number and format of common items and the choice of item response model and linking method. The results indicate that a minimum of 7 - 10 common items are needed per dimension to link the tests with acceptable amounts of error; there is no appreciable difference in the linking when dichotomous items are modeled using the M 2 PL versus the M 3 PL; and dichotomous, rather than mixed-format common items, with a variable dilation linking method should be preferred when creating a multidimensional scale. Between-grade differences on a unidimensional and two multidimensional <b>vertical</b> <b>scales</b> are compared to identify distortions related to unaccounted-for dimensionality for cross-sectional versus longitudinal cohorts when the scales are created using a single-year design versus the super test design. The single-year design was found to be insufficient for establishing a multidimensional <b>vertical</b> <b>scale.</b> Differences between unidimensional and dimension-specific growth are generally small although there are notable distortions related to each of the modeled dimensions in various grades. For both the cross-sectional and longitudinal cohorts, growth was consistently distorted for dimensions associated with number operations/computational techniques and algebra.
