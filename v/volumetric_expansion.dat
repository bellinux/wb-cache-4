50|$|The {{traditional}} {{explanation for}} frost weathering was <b>volumetric</b> <b>expansion</b> of freezing water. When water freezes to ice, its volume increases by nine percent. Under specific circumstances, this expansion {{is able to}} displace or fracture rock. At a temperature of -22 °C, ice growth {{is known to be}} able to generate pressures of up to 207MPa, more than enough to fracture any rock. For frost weathering to occur by <b>volumetric</b> <b>expansion,</b> the rock must have almost no air that can be compressed to compensate for the expansion of ice, which means it has to be water-saturated and frozen quickly from all sides so that the water does not migrate away and the pressure is exerted on the rock.

An important consideration is the effect of damage manifested principally by the formation of shear induced wing cracks which have a stress dependent orientation. The analytical formulation utilizes a scalar damage parameter, but is capable of indicating the non- isotropic dependence of inelastic straining on the stress state and the confining pressure.
