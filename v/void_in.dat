40|$|In Fe–Cu alloys, Cu {{precipitates}} {{are formed}} during high-energy particle irradiation. If there exists energetic binding between vacancies and Cu atoms, vacancy clusters (<b>voids)</b> are formed <b>in</b> precipitates at an initial stage of irradiation, separate from <b>voids</b> <b>in</b> the matrix, {{because of the}} migration of Cu atoms with vacancies. In this paper, the damage rate dependence on the formation and annihilation of <b>voids</b> <b>in</b> the precipitates and in the matrix is simulated by reaction kinetic analysis. The initial formation of voids at precipitates, the annihilation of them with an increased dosage and new formation of <b>voids</b> <b>in</b> the matrix are simulated, {{and the results are}} compared with the experiments. In a high damage rate of 3. 3 × 10 ^[− 7] dpa/s, the formation of <b>voids</b> <b>in</b> Cu precipitates is not significant, but the formation of <b>voids</b> <b>in</b> the matrix is dominant, different from those in a low damage rate of 1. 5 × 10 ^[− 10] dpa/s...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: <b>Voids</b> <b>in</b> {{the sealer}} mass have the {{potential}} to allow leakage through obturation. They are more critical in single cone (SC) obturation as the volume of sealer used in this obturation is larger when compared to other obturations. Aim: To compare the area of <b>voids</b> <b>in</b> mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) -based, resin-based, and zinc oxide-eugenol-based sealers when employed with SC obturation technique. Materials and Methods: Fifteen teeth were cleaned and shaped and divided into three groups for SC obturation using MTA Fillapex, AH 26, and Pulpdent sealers, respectively. The obturated teeth were sectioned at apical, middle, and coronal third, and area of <b>voids</b> <b>in</b> the sealer was assessed using a stereomicroscope and digital images and image software. The results were statistically analyzed using SPSS software and Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests. Results: The three tested sealers showed <b>voids</b> <b>in</b> all the sections except MTA Fillapex, which was <b>void</b> free <b>in</b> apical and middle sections. There were significant differences between these sealers regarding their section wise area of voids (P < 0. 05). Similarly, there were significant differences in their overall area of voids (P < 0. 05) with MTA Fillapex showing significantly least area of voids followed by AH 26. Conclusions: SC obturation with MTA Fillapex sealer, which showed void free apical and middle third sections, had significantly least area of <b>voids</b> <b>in</b> the sealer followed by the one with AH 26 sealer, whereas SC obturation with Pulpdent sealer had significantly most area of voids...|$|R

40|$|Moisture-induced damage within {{hot mix asphalt}} {{concrete}} has been a national problem. Although numerous laboratory tests have been developed {{over the last several}} decades, the premature failure of hot mix {{asphalt concrete}} is still prevalent. The failure of hot mix asphalt concrete has always been linked to the failure of test method in consistently and accurately predicting moisture sensitivity. ^ The factor most commonly disregarded is the acceptance criteria of the placed properties of hot mix asphalt concrete. To account for production and construction variability, state highway agencies typically allow a range of hot mix asphalt concrete properties to be acceptable. For instance, 7 percent of <b>voids</b> <b>in</b> total mix are specified but contractor is allowed to place hot mix asphalt concrete within 2. 7 to 9. 9 percent <b>voids</b> <b>in</b> total mix. An increase <b>in</b> <b>voids</b> <b>in</b> total mix to 9. 9 percent may increase moisture sensitivity of hot mix asphalt concrete. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} identify the influence of acceptance criterion <b>in</b> terms of <b>voids</b> <b>in</b> total mix on moisture sensitivity. Similarly, state highway agencies allow variations in binder content and gradation. Therefore, the influence of binder content and gradation at higher <b>voids</b> <b>in</b> total mix was also evaluated. ^ To achieve objectives of this study, three different aggregate types with two different binders were evaluated. The moisture sensitivity of these mixes was evaluated using two commonly used test methods: Hamburg Wheel Tracking Device and AASHTO T- 283. ^ The test results from Hamburg Wheel Tracking Device and AASHTO T- 283 suggest that the moisture sensitivity of hot mix asphalt concrete depends on the acceptance criteria especially <b>voids</b> <b>in</b> total mix. ...|$|R
