25|$|The {{large house}} {{situated}} halfway along the dam wall was originally the weirmaster's cottage. The weirmaster would {{walk up to}} the hexagonal <b>valve</b> <b>house,</b> constructed to the same design as BCN tollhouses, and operate the gate valves to release water from Chasewater reservoir into the canal. The construction of the M6 Toll between the reservoir and the A5 required {{the construction of a new}} bridge over the motorway to access the southern side of the lake, where an Innovation Centre provides enhanced access to the waterfront. Selling land for motorway construction also allowed the Chasewater Railway to construct new premises and a large engine shed on the lake side.|$|E
25|$|After {{the opening}} of the South Staffordshire Railway Line in 1849 rail {{infrastructure}} serving the collieries around the reservoir began to expand. John Robinson McClean engineered the rail line linking the South Staffordshire Line to the Hammerwich and Uxbridge Collieries as well as the Norton Branch. McClean leased pits from the Marquess of Anglesey and formed the Cannock Chase Colliery Company in 1859. In 1871 the rail line linking the Norton Branch and the Uxbridge Colliery was built. This line now used by Chasewater Railway involved the building of a causeway across the Crane Brook valley at the western end of the reservoir. Subsidence in the 1890s led to the extension of the western embankment north to the railway causeway and Norton East Road. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries the eastern dam was raised, with this a new hexagonal <b>valve</b> <b>house</b> and weir was built and the capacity of the reservoir was increased. The increased capacity of the reservoir created Jeffries Swag at the western end of the reservoir.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. MAN Diesel’s 6 S 50 MC-C disel is a {{two-stroke}} {{marine diesel}} engine. Preload of the exhaust valve component is applied in four bolts. The preload of bolts {{can improve the}} fatigue strength of the exhaust component. In addition, the bolt pretension ensure the sealing in the maximum firing pressure. Using of simulation method, the displacement and deformation of exhaust valve component are analyzed when the maximum firing pressure and preload are applied. By analysis of the deformation of the exhaust <b>valve</b> <b>housing</b> under different preload force, the deformation of exhaust <b>valve</b> <b>housing</b> increase with the increaseing of preload. The maximum total deformation is 0. 40 mm in the preload of 720 KN. The maximum deformation occurs in the region near the bolt {{in the side of}} exhaust gas outlet. The deformation in the direction of Y-axis of exhaust <b>valve</b> <b>housing</b> is along the Y-axis opposite direction when the preload is greater than 540 KN. This indicates that the exhaust valve seal well. The sealing and deformation of the exhaust valve component meets the desgin requirement...|$|R

40|$|The {{success of}} a bileaflet {{mechanical}} heart valve depends on the absence of persistent flow stases that may cause thrombus formation. Within the <b>valve</b> <b>housing,</b> the only obstruction to blood flow is the leaflets. The leaflet faces are repeatedly washed by blood as the valve opens and closes, but persistent flow stasis can occur at the leaflet pivot due to its size, location and design, as evidenced by recent thrombus-related failure (1 - 3). Therefore, {{it is imperative to}} char-acterize pivot flow of any bileaflet mechanical heart valve design prior to its clinical use (4). Pivot flow analysis is complicated by the geometry of the valve and its pivots. In general, a bileaflet mechanical heart valve typically comprises a rigid annular <b>valve</b> <b>housing</b> and a pair of rotatable leaflets (5 - 9) (Fig. 1). Each leaflet has a pair of ears that pro-trude from the leaflet and mate with the pivot recesses in the <b>valve</b> <b>housing.</b> The leaflet is retained inside the <b>valve</b> <b>housing</b> by the pivots, which control the range of the leaflet movement as the leaflets respond passively to local blood flow pressure gradients. Pivot flow analysis is challenging because the rotating leaflet obstructs visibility, and the complexity and motion of the pivot region result in complex flow that is difficult to measure or simulate. The present study outlines a systematic, detailed method for characterizing pivot flow of the Medtronic ADVANTAGE (ADV) bileaflet mechanical heart valve. This method, which was used during the design process of the ADV, combines both a macroscopic hydrodynamic performance assessment and a micro-scopic flow analysis. The St. Jude Medical (SJM) bileaflet mechanical valve was used as the control in these studies. Address for correspondence...|$|R

25|$|The valvular {{event that}} causes such {{cavitating}} conditions to exist is the closing {{mechanics of the}} MHV. Several causes of cavitation relating to valve closure have been identified. Squeeze flow is cavitation that is said to occur as the occluder approaches the housing during closure and fluid is squeezed between the occluder and the <b>valve</b> <b>housing</b> causing a low pressure formation. Water hammer is cavitation caused by the sudden stop of the valve occluder as it contacts the <b>valve</b> <b>housing.</b> This sudden retardation of the fluid retrograde inertia is said to put the fluid under tension causing cavitation. Squeeze flow is said to form a cloud of bubbles at the circumferential lip of the occluder whereas water hammer {{is said to be}} seen as transient bubbles at the occlude housing.|$|R

40|$|On {{behalf of}} Petroleum Technology Company AS (PTC), an {{experimental}} study regarding {{one of their}} safety valves has been conducted. The respective safety valve is called a Modular Surface Annulus Safety (MSAS) valve. This valve functions as a primary barrier against dangerous blow-outs from the annulus in an oil and gas-producing well. It is a back check valve, where a piston moves inside a <b>valve</b> <b>housing.</b> In the past {{there has been some}} issues regarding what torque values these valves are to be installed with. Too high torque values could lead to insufficient clearance between the moving piston and the <b>valve</b> <b>housing.</b> Insufficient clearance would lead to malfunctioning of the valve, and potential dangerous blow-outs from the well, due to a primary barrier not functioning properly. The goal of this thesis has been {{to come up with a}} method for determining the appropriate installation torque that is to be used during installation of such valves. In order to determine the appropriate installation torque there are three things that have to be accounted for. The first is achieving sufficient pre-tensioning of the valve so that the valve does not loosen due to vibrations. The second is to ensure that there is sufficient clearance between the <b>valve</b> <b>housing</b> and piston after installation. The third is to determine whether lubrications are necessary or not. In order to account for these things two different tests have been designed, Torque test 1 and Torque test 2 (TT 1 and TT 2). The previous tests totaled 118 measurements. In addition to these tests there have been performed finite element analysis (FEA) via SolidWorks Simulations. These tests and simulations are briefly described in the following. TT 1 was designed to measure the relationship between applied torque, corresponding axial force and the coefficient of friction between the valve and the VR-profile that it is inserted into. The relationship between the applied torque and corresponding axial force was measured via an electronic load cell. This was possible due to the design of the test setup. The coefficient of friction at different lubrication conditions was possible to calculate due to specially machined test parts, as well as engineering equations from threaded bolt theory. TT 2 was designed to measure the radial displacement that takes place in the <b>valve</b> <b>housing</b> when exposed to the installation torque, due to the angled contact surface in front of the valve. The purpose of the test was to calculate the torque that would lead to insufficient clearance between the <b>valve</b> <b>housing</b> and piston at given frictional conditions, calculated from the results from TT 1. This test was performed via strain gauges as well as manual measurements via a micrometer. Both of the previous tests were conducted in pit one, in PTC’s workshop. Two different valve housings were studied. A 2. 0 ” valve, and a 2. 5 ” valve, both with Xylan coating and 8 TPI Stub Acme threads...|$|R

25|$|The {{cavitation}} phenomenon {{can also}} be described using fluid mechanics. This can result from pressure oscillations, flow deceleration, tip vortices, streamline contraction, and squeeze jets. This last cause is the most contributive factor to cavitation. The squeeze jets are formed when the valve is closing and the blood between the occluder and <b>valve</b> <b>housing</b> is “squeezed” out to create a high-speed jet. This in turn creates intense vortices with very low pressures {{that can lead to}} cavitation.|$|R

Based on analytical calculations, pipe wall thickness of a swing check <b>valve</b> <b>housing</b> was selected for the nominal pipe diameter DN 300 and water test pressure p = 2. 4 MPa. All 3 D models of components, {{as well as the}} assembly, were made in the program tool SolidWorks. The 3 D model of the swing check valve with flanges was subjected to stress analysis (Finite Element Analysis) for the purpose of checking the accuracy of the analytical calculations. Fluid flow analysis (Flow Simulation) was used for presenting fluid flow process and rate through the swing check valve assembly.
