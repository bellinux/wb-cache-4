The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the clinical and functional results of combined anterior mitral leaflet extension and myectomy in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. Background. Septal myectomy is the most commonly performed surgical procedure in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Because of the role of the mitral valve in creating the outflow tract gradient, mitral valve replacement or plication is performed in selected cases in combination with myectomy, often with better hemodynamic results than those of myectomy alone. Mitral valve leaflet extension, in which a glutaraldehyde-preserved autologous pericardial patch is used to enlarge the mitral valve along its horizontal axis, is a novel surgical approach in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. Methods. Eight patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy were treated with mitral leaflet extension and myectomy. Preoperative and postoperative data (New York Heart Association functional class, number of drugs prescribed, width of the interventricular septum, severity of mitral valve regurgitation, severity of systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve and outflow tract gradient) were compared with those of 12 patients undergoing myectomy alone. Results. Preoperative evaluation demonstrated that mitral regurgitation and systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve were more severe in the group undergoing mitral <b>valve</b> <b>extension</b> (p < 0. 001 and p < 0. 05, respectively). There were no deaths associated with either surgical procedure. Two patients, both treated by myectomy alone, died during the follow-up period. Postoperatively, patients treated with mitral <b>valve</b> <b>extension</b> had less mitral regurgitation (p < 0. 005), less residual systolic anterior motion (p < 0. 01), greater improvement in functional class (p = 0. 05) and greater reduction in the number of drugs (p < 0. 005) and in septal thickness (p < 0. 05). Conclusions. Mitral leaflet extension in combination with myectomy is a promising new surgical approach that may provide superior results to those of myectomy alone. Further studies are needed to determine the clinical value of this procedure...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{different aspects}} of data plotting (2 -D bitmap images) into 3 -D complex parts, such as turbine blades, rotor steeples, welds and steam chest <b>valves.</b> <b>Extension</b> to defect reconstruction, defect comparison to other methods (magnetic particles, optical, fracture mechanics and/or designed parameters) is also described. Applications to beam simulation, and to multiple frames plotting is also illustrated. Data plotting in combination with simulation and ray tracing helped optimizing the probe design, the inspection parameters and namely provides a valuable tool for technician training. Defect parameters are within the following tolerances: location: ± 1 mm, angle = ± 1 °, length: ± 2 mm and height: ± 1 mm. Some aspects of real 3 -D data acquisition and analysis are commented and suggested.

40|$|An analog on-load valve {{sequencing}} {{system that}} is used to test the performances of the valves on a turbo-alternator can be replaced by a microcomputer testing system. On the way to the full-scale computerising of turbo-generator control systems, this type of testing system may be used under the control of a full-size supervisory computer. This microprocessor-based testing system provides test sequencing of the valves of an Electro-Hydraulic Governor. The hardware for the interfacing and scaling, and the firmware for the microprocessor are developed for one <b>valve.</b> The <b>extension</b> of the technique to the task of testing multiple valves in sequence is also discussed...|$|R
50|$|Nose wheel {{steering}} is electronically {{controlled by the}} rudder pedals, utilizing the synchro principle. Hydraulic pressure for retraction and extension of the gear is transmitted by a system of tubing, hoses and actuating cylinders and is electrically controlled by limit switches and solenoid <b>valves.</b> Emergency <b>extension</b> can be accomplished pneumatically in case of hydraulic or electrical system failure. The main gear is enclosed by two doors after retraction. The inboard doors are hydraulically operated while the outboard doors are mechanically operated by linkage connected to the main gear struts. The nose gear doors operate mechanically with linkages attached to the nose gear shock strut.|$|R
50|$|Since World War II the {{contrabass}} trombone in F {{with two}} valve attachments has been primarily {{in use in}} orchestras, though the 18′ B version is still used by many. Originally due to reasons of limited space conditions in opera orchestra pits, the bell section was provided with a coil to reduce {{the length of the}} bell bow, but since the 1970s the long, straight form has taken precedence. Through the combination of both <b>valves,</b> the <b>extension</b> handle on the outer slide also became redundant and the instrument is provided with five or six working positions on the slide. Valve tuning combinations are E/B, D/B, or more rarely D/C.|$|R
50|$|Barrel sealed {{manifolds}} {{with two}} O-rings in parallel are {{more tolerant of}} minor misalignment and varied centre distance than face-sealed manifolds with single O-ring seals which {{are more likely to}} leak if impacted. Isolation manifolds provide the possibility of closing off one cylinder if there is an unrecoverable leak, conserving the remaining gas in the other cylinder. Cylinder or manifold <b>valve</b> knob <b>extension</b> operators (slobwinders) can be stiff, can trail and snag on things, and can be difficult to find when needed. Valve- and manifold protector frames are not necessary and may be worse line-traps than the valves. Some models {{make it more difficult to}} reach the valve, and some can increase the diver's profile.|$|R

The <b>extension</b> of the infectious process from the aortic valve to surrounding tissue can occur in different directions. This case report describes a 28 -year-old man in whom the abscess of the aortic annulus was very large, causing a moderate aortic systolic obstruction, and also involved the left ventricular inferior wall.

40|$|The uptake, {{toxicity}} and metabolism of the N-methylcarbamate pesticide carbofuran (2, 3 -dihydro- 2, 2 -dimethyl- 7 -benzofuranyl methylcarbamate) by the nontarget freshwater bivalve mollusc Glebula rotundata (Lamarck) were examined. Uptake and {{toxicity studies}} were also conducted with another bivalve species, Rangia cuneata (Lea). Both G. rotundata and R. cuneata absorbed water-borne carbofuran. During long-term (> 48 hours) exposure experiments, R. cuneata did not appreciably concentrate this pesticide; generally, tissue and water concentrations of carbofuran were almost equivalent. In short-term (< 48 hours) exposure studies, carbofuran uptake by G. rotundata was {{proportional to the}} wet weight of whole body tissue. Glebula rotundata tissues did not differentially absorb this pesticide. When exposed to carbofuran concentrations greater than 75 ppm (waterborne or injected), both species exhibited symptoms of carbofuran poisoning; these included gaping of the shell <b>valves,</b> <b>extension</b> and flaccidity of the foot, incoordination and loss of tactile response. The effects of carbofuran were reversible except in R. cuneata that had {{lost the ability to}} respond to tactile stimulation. During in vivo experiments, G. rotundata converted radiolabeled carbofuran primarily to polar compounds; a variety of less abundant free metabolites were also recovered. The polar metabolites produced by water immersion incubated clams appeared to be conjugated products that were refractory to chemical and enzymatic conditions known to hydrolyze glycosidic conjugates. The possibility of the involvement of an amino acid moiety {{in the formation of the}} polar metabolites was suggested. Glebula rotundata degraded carbofuran more slowly than most other animals but more rapidly than plants and microorganisms. When in vitro methods were used, G. rotundata hemolymph metabolized carbofuran more rapidly than homogenates of gill, mantle and hepatopancreas tissues. The extracellular portion of this body fluid was more active than the cellular portion in metabolizing this pesticide. Hemolymph preparations converted radiolabeled carbofuran to hydrolysis products and polar metabolites. The in vitro produced polar carbofuran metabolites were tentatively identified as glycosidic conjugates. Bacteria isolated from clam tissue and incubation water were tested for the ability to metabolize this carbamate pesticide. The bacterial contribution to the observed metabolism of carbofuran by G. rotundata appeared to be negligible in both in vivo and in vitro studies. Future experiments are also discussed...|$|R

An iterative process is applied to determine {{the opening of the}} shim valve built into the piston. Characteristic diagram shows different parts, the slopes of which and the points of their changes are analysed by adjusting some structural features, to establish how to operate for obtaining predetermined shapes.

40|$|The {{case is a}} 16 {{days old}} female neonate with RDS after birth without {{significant}} finding on CXR, but in conventional CT (one centimeter thickness slices) we saw a complete ring of calcification {{in the course of}} aorta and pulmonary artery trunk including their <b>valves.</b> By <b>extension</b> of CT slices to abdomen and pel-vis, calcification was found in the abdominal aorta, SMA, renal and iliac arteries. Unfortunately, the neo-nate expired after 24 hours and during this period the following laboratory findings were the only available ones: Glucose= 240, BUN= 9, Ca= 0. 9, P= 9. 6 (neonate 3. 9 - 7. 7), Na= 135, K= 6. 8, WBC= 22300 (N= 47 L= 52). This patient was the first offspring of a rural couple and although we invited them to return to us for fur-ther investigations to detect probable inheritable dis-eases in their family, they did not come back. In a review of literature, {{we were not able to}} find a simi-lar case and this may be a unique one...|$|R
40|$|Rationale: Formation {{of heart}} valves {{requires}} early endocardial to mesenchymal transformation (EMT) to generate valve mesenchyme and subsequent endocardial cell proliferation to elongate valve leaflets. Nfatc 1 (nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 1) is highly expressed in valve endocardial cells and {{is required for}} normal valve formation, but {{its role in the}} fate of valve endocardial cells during valve development is unknown. Objective: Our aim was to investigate the function of Nfatc 1 in cell-fate decision making by valve endocardial cells during EMT and early valve elongation. Methods and Results: Nfatc 1 transcription enhancer was used to generate a novel valve endocardial cell–specific Cre mouse line for fate-mapping analyses of valve endocardial cells. The results demonstrate that a subpopu-lation of valve endocardial cells marked by the Nfatc 1 enhancer do not undergo EMT. Instead, these cells remain within the endocardium as a proliferative population to support <b>valve</b> leaflet <b>extension.</b> In contrast, loss of Nfatc 1 function leads to enhanced EMT and decreased proliferation of valve endocardium and mesenchyme. The results of blastocyst complementation assays show that Nfatc 1 inhibits EMT in a cell-autonomous manner. We further reveal by gene expression studies that Nfatc 1 suppresses transcription of Snail 1 and Snail 2, the key transcrip-tional factors for initiation of EMT...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} to pre-establish {{the features of}} a shockabsorber is analyzed in this work. Numerical simulations were {{used to evaluate the}} influence of a few geometrical parameters on the force given under excitation. Since the oil flowing inside a shock-absorber can follow several directions, an iterative procedure was applied to determine the opening of the valves incorporated in the piston, and the formulas of the elastic strain for the circular plate were used for this purpose. The damping coefficients were obtained from the characterristic and work diagrams; they were then analyzed as function of a few geometrical features of the shock absorber. The results show that the thickness of the shim valves and the preload on the <b>extension</b> <b>valve</b> have more influence than the other parameters on the damping force...|$|R
40|$|Second {{generation}} solid freeforming devices {{will have}} the capability to render both shape and the spatial arrangement of composition directly from a computer file. In order to build three-dimensional functional gradients in selective laser sintering it is necessary to have a computer-controlled mixing and dispensing system. We report such a system based on the horizontal acoustic vibration of vertical capillary tubes that provides both switching and flow rate control. An orchestra of such tubes can be constructed to deposit a multi-component system onto a building platform. Our concern is the initiation of flow. It requires an “attack” waveform to break the domes that provide flow arrest and release the potential energy of powder above the dome. The intensity of attack also influences the mass that flows out before a new dome forms, i. e., the response time of the <b>valve.</b> Neither the <b>extension</b> to vibration caused by ringing nor the wave amplitude account for the over-run of the valve. Much better correlation is obtained with acceleration and with calculated kinetic energy of horizontally vibrating particles. <br/...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundResidual or {{recurrent}} mitral regurgitation frequently occurs after {{mitral valve}} repair for ischemic mitral regurgitation with an annuloplasty ring. Because annuloplasty primarily addresses annular dilatation, we studied an adjunctive technique that might correct restricted leaflet (Carpentier type IIIb) systolic closing motion, which often accompanies annular dilatation {{in patients with}} ischemic mitral regurgitation. MethodsSix sheep had radiopaque markers placed on the left ventricle, mitral leaflets and annulus, and mitral subvalvular apparatus. A pericardial patch was sutured into the middle scallop of the posterior mitral valve leaflet and furled in with a reefing stitch placed in the radial axis. Posterolateral left ventricular myocardial ischemia was created by using proximal circumflex occlusion to induce acute ischemic mitral regurgitation. Under open-chest conditions, 3 -dimensional marker coordinates were measured by using biplane videofluoroscopy at baseline and during acute ischemia {{both before and after}} release of the reefing stitch (leaflet extension); transesophageal echocardiography was used to grade ischemic mitral regurgitation. ResultsLeaflet apical systolic tethering was not improved by leaflet extension, but ischemic mitral regurgitation decreased (control, 0. 9 ± 0. 3 *; ischemia, 2. 4 ± 0. 3; leaflet extension, 1. 5 ± 0. 3; *P < 0. 002). Posterior mitral valve leaflet midline length (control, 1. 45 ± 0. 09 *; ischemia, 1. 53 ± 0. 10; leaflet extension, 1. 83 ± 0. 13 *; *P < 0. 001) and posterior mitral valve leaflet middle scallop area (control, 1. 66 ± 0. 20 cm 2 *; ischemia, 1. 91 ± 0. 22 cm 2; leaflet extension, 2. 36 ± 0. 22 cm 2 *; *P < 0. 006) increased with leaflet extension because of patch unfurling (mean ± 1 standard error of the mean; repeated-measures analysis of variance, Dunnet post-hoc test vs ischemia). ConclusionsPosterior mitral <b>valve</b> leaflet <b>extension</b> ameliorated acute ischemic mitral regurgitation but did not correct the abnormal apically restricted systolic posterior mitral valve leaflet closing motion. This technique might be a useful adjunct repair in combination with ring annuloplasty for ischemic mitral regurgitation, but the clinical role of this adjunct remains to be defined in patients...|$|R
500|$|Holcroft’s {{valve gear}} design {{was also an}} attempt to address the {{problems}} associated with Gresley’s conjugated valve gear, which was prone to variations in valve events caused by heat expansion of the valve spindles within the pistons. The design utilised the motion of the outside valve rods (the rods transmitting the motion of the driving axles to the valves, such as the combination lever) instead, although the restricted space between the back of the outside cylinders and the front driving wheels made it impossible to locate the rocking arms controlling the conjugating mechanism in the vicinity. Holcroft’s solution was to move the mechanism to a position above the pony truck and ahead of the cylinders and link it to the outside <b>valve</b> rods with <b>extension</b> levers, which had to be accommodated within the strict SECR loading gauge tolerances. This necessitated a new design of cylinder block whereby the outside steam chests were set inwards {{and the size of the}} cylinders reduced to [...] stroke and diameter. [...] The sides of the outside cylinders consequently sloped inwards towards the top in a configuration similar to GWR 2-cylinder locomotives, thus providing ample space in which to accommodate the extension levers. The inside cylinder and conjugation assembly were set at an incline of 1 in 8 to clear the front pony truck, leaving space for a third set of independent Walschaerts valve gear between the frames should Holcroft’s conjugation mechanism prove unreliable in service.|$|R
50|$|The ventricles are histologically and {{electrically}} {{isolated from the}} atria by the unique and electrically impermeable collagen layers of connective tissue known as the cardiac skeleton. The bulwarks of this entity stem from the central body to form the four <b>valve</b> rings. Collagen <b>extensions</b> from the <b>valve</b> rings seal and limit atrial electrical influence from ventricular electrical influence to the SA/AV/Purkinje pathways. Exceptions such as accessory pathways may occur in this firewall between atrial and ventricular electrical influence but are rare.The compromised load of atrial fibrillation detracts from overall performance but the ventricles continue {{to work as a}} physiologically effective pump. Given this pathology, ejection fraction may deteriorate by ten to thirty percent. Uncorrected atrial fibrillation can lead to heart rates approaching 200 beats per minute. If one can slow this rate down to a normal range of approximately 80 beats per minute, the filling time of the heart cycle is longer and confers additional benefit to the pumping ability of the heart. Breathless individuals with uncontrolled atrial fibrillation can be rapidly returned to normal breathing when conversion with medication or electrical cardioversion is attempted.Pharmacological manipulation of rate control, for example, by beta blocker|beta adrenoceptor antagonists, non-dyhydropyridine calcium channel blockers and digoxin are important historical interventions in this condition. Individuals prone to a hypercoagulable state are at a decided risk of thromboembolism, thus requiring therapy with warfarin for life if the defined pathology cannot be corrected.|$|R

40|$|Surgical {{management}} of aortic insufficiency {{in the young}} is problematic {{because of the lack}} of an ideal valve substitute. Potential advantages of aortic valve repair include low incidences of thromboembolism and endocarditis, avoiding conduit replacements, the maintenance of growth potential, and improved quality of life. Aortic valve repair is still far from fulfilling the three key factors that have allowed the phenomenal development of mitral valve repair (standardization, reproducibility, and stable long-term results); however, techniques of aortic valve repair have been refined, and subsets of patients amenable to repair have been identified. We have focused on the oldest technique of aortic <b>valve</b> repair, cusp <b>extension,</b> focusing on children with rheumatic aortic insufficiency. Among 77 children operated from 2003 to 2007, there was one early death from ventricular failure and one late death from sudden cardiac arrhythmia. During a mean follow-up of 12. 8 ± 5. 9 years, there were 16 (20. 5 %) reoperations on the aortic valve, at a median of 3. 4 years (range, 2 months to 18. 3 years) from repair. Freedom from aortic valve reoperation was 96. 2 % ± 2. 2 % at 1 year, 94. 9 % ± 2. 5 % at 2 years, 88. 5 % ± 3. 6 % at 5 years, 81. 7 % ± 4. 4 % at 10 years, 79. 7 % ± 4. 8 % at 15 years, and 76. 2 % ± 5. 7 % at 20 years. Although aortic cusp extension is technically more demanding, it remains particularly more suitable in the context of evolving rheumatic aortic insufficiency in children with a small aortic annulus as a bridge surgical approach to late aortic valve replacement with a larger valvular prosthesis...|$|R
