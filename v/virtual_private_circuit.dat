A managed object class can be defined for any resource that an organization wishes to monitor or control. A single managed object class may represent a single network resource or a logical representation of many resources. Examples of hardware resources include switches, workstations, PBXs, LAN cards, and multiplexers. Examples of software resources are queuing programs, routing algorithms, and buffer management. Examples of logical resources include a network, a route, or a <b>virtual</b> <b>private</b> <b>circuit.</b> An agent application provides a view of its associated managed object instances. Manager applications are able to access the managed object instance attribute values and manipulate managed object instances through the management interfaces published by each managed object class.

A {{frame relay}} service offers <b>virtual</b> <b>private</b> {{networks}} to customers by provisioning {{a set of}} long-term <b>private</b> <b>virtual</b> <b>circuits</b> (PVCs) between customer endpoints on a large backbone network. During the provisioning of a PVC, routing decisions are made without any knowledge of future requests. Over time, these decisions can cause inefficiencies in the network and occasional offline rerouting of the PVCs is needed. In this paper, the offline PVC routing problem is formulated as an integer multicommodity flow problem with additional constraints and with an objective function that minimizes delays and network overload. We propose variants of a GRASP with path-relinking heuristic for this problem. Experimental results for realistic-size problems are reported, showing that the proposed heuristics are able to improve the solutions found with standard routing techniques. Moreover, the structure of our objective function provides a useful strategy for setting the appropriate value of its weight parameter, to achieve some quality of service (QoS) level defined by a desired maximum utilization rate. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. GRASP with path-relinking is {{a hybrid}} metaheuristic, or {{stochastic}} local search (Monte Carlo) method, for combinatorial optimization. A restart strategy in GRASP with path-relinking heuristics {{is a set}} of iterations {i 1,i 2, [...] . } on which the heuristic is restarted from scratch using a new seed for the random number generator. Restart strategies have been shown to speed up stochastic local search algorithms. In this paper, we propose a new restart strategy for GRASP with path-relinking heuristics. We illustrate the speedup obtained with our restart strategy on GRASP with path-relinking heuristics for the maximum cut problem, the maximum weighted satisfiability problem, and the <b>private</b> <b>virtual</b> <b>circuit</b> routing problem...|$|R

40|$|As {{internet}} usage grows exponentially, {{network security}} issues become increasingly important. Network security measures {{are needed to}} protect data during transmission. Various security controls are used to prevent the access of hackers in networks. They are firewall, <b>virtual</b> <b>private</b> networks and encryption algorithms. Out of these, the <b>virtual</b> <b>private</b> network plays {{a vital role in}} preventing hackers from accessing the networks. A <b>Virtual</b> <b>Private</b> Network (VPN) provides end users with a way to privately access information on their network over a public network infrastructure such as the internet. Using a technique called “Tunneling”, data packets are transmitted across a public routed network, such as the internet that simulates a point-to-point connection. <b>Virtual</b> <b>private</b> networks provide customers with a secure and low-cost communication environment. The basic structure of the virtual circuit is to create a logical path from the source port to the destination port. This path may incorporate many hops between routers for the formation of the circuit. The final, logical path or virtual circuit acts {{in the same way as}} a direct connection between the two ports. Our proposed Provisioning Restorable <b>Virtual</b> <b>Private</b> Networks Algorithm (PRA) is used to combine the provisioning and restoration algorithms to achieve better results than the ones obtained by independent restoration and provisioning. In order to ensure service quality and availability in <b>Virtual</b> <b>Private</b> Networks, seamless recovery from failures is essential. The quality of service of the <b>Virtual</b> <b>Private</b> Networks is also improved due to the combination of provisioning and restoration. The bandwidth sharing concept is also applied in link to improve the quality of service in the <b>Virtual</b> <b>Private</b> Network. The performance analysis of the proposed algorithm is carried out in terms of cost, the number of nodes, the number of VPN nodes, delay, asymmetric ratio and delay with constraints with Disjoint Path Algorithm and Approximation Restoration <b>Virtual</b> <b>Private</b> Networks Algorithm.

Grokster Ltd. in 2005, Internet users around the globe who engaged in {{copyright}} infringement had already turned to newer, alternative forms of peer-to-peer filesharing. One recent development is the “seedbox,” a <b>virtual</b> <b>private</b> server rentable for use to download and upload (“seed”) files through the BitTorrent protocol. Because BitTorrent is widely used for both non-infringing and infringing purposes, the operators of seedboxes and other rentable BitTorrent-capable <b>virtual</b> <b>private</b> servers face the possibility of direct and secondary liability as did the defendants in Grokster and more recent cases like UMG Recordings, Inc. v. Shelter Capital Partners LLC and Viacom Intern., Inc. v. YouTube, Inc. This Issue Brief examines whether the “safe harbor” provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) may shield <b>virtual</b> <b>private</b> server providers with customers running BitTorrent clients from potential liability for copyright infringement. It argues that general <b>virtual</b> <b>private</b> server providers {{are likely to find}} refuge in the safe harbor provisions as long as they conscientiously comply with the DMCA. In contrast, <b>virtual</b> <b>private</b> server providers specifically targeting BitTorrent users (“seedbox providers”) are much less likely to receive DMCA safe harbor protection...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Providing an Internet {{service is}} no longer only a domain of {{organizations}} and enterprises, but becomes increasingly popular for <b>private</b> persons. <b>Virtual</b> <b>private</b> services are defined as services that are offered by private users over public Internet connections and for a limited, possibly changing set of other <b>private</b> users. <b>Virtual</b> <b>private</b> services demand extended security properties, e. g. hiding service activity from unauthorized clients, that are less important in public services. Two common approaches exist to utilize Tor hidden services for offering <b>virtual</b> <b>private</b> services. These are examined for security problems that might be privacy-relevant for the service provider. Subsequently, {{an extension of the}} hidden service protocol is presented that is designed to better support <b>virtual</b> <b>private</b> services. This design is not meant to replace the existing hidden service design, but should complement it. 1 Problem Statement Providing an Internet service has first and foremost been a domain o...|$|R
