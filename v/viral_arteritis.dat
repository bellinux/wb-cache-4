40|$|Equine <b>viral</b> <b>arteritis</b> (EVA) is an {{economically}} important viral disease of equids. Stallions can become long term carriers of the virus, and transmit it during breeding. Although carrier stallions can be bred if precautions are taken, {{the need to}} mate them with seropositive or vaccinated mares decreases their desirability as breeders. Acute illness also occurs in some horses. Although deaths are very rare in healthy adults, pregnant mares that become infected may abort, and very young foals may die of fulminating pneumonia and enteritis. Equine <b>viral</b> <b>arteritis</b> has recently increased in prevalence, possibly due to increased transportation of horses and semen.

It can cause abortion in pregnant mares and death in young foals. Breeding stallions may become permanent carriers of the virus. Financial losses may include those due to abortion and/or disease and death in very young foals, reduced demand to breed and/or decreased commercial value of persistently infected stallions, and denied export market for infected animals. Overall, 59. 4 percent of operations had never heard of equine <b>viral</b> <b>arteritis.</b> The percentage of operations that knew some basics or were knowledgeable regarding EVA increased with size of operation, from 7. 6 percent of operations with one to five horse to 27. 3 percent of operations with 20 or more horses. the percentages of operations that were familiar with EVA were highest in the racing (31. 9 percent) and breeding (31. 3 percent) categories of horse use and the lowest in the farm/ranch category. Of horses vaccinated against EVA, 25. 3 percent were seropositive; of horses not vaccinated against EVA, 2. 0 percent were seropositive. However, due to the very small number of operations that vaccinated (1. 6 percent), these unvaccinated horses with a titer to EAV was higher (17. 4 percent) on operations which had taken a horse outside of the state within the previous 12 months than on those operations that did not take the horse out of the state (5. 4 percent). The percentage of horses of the Standardbred breed with positive EAV titer was higher (23. 9 percent) than percentages for Thoroughbred (4. 5 percent), Quarter Horse (0. 6 percent), Warmblood (3. 6 percent), and other (1. 3 percent) breeds.

From June 15 through September 11, 1998, horse management and health data were collected on-farm from 1, 136 participating operations that had three or more horses present on January 1, 1998. This target population was estimated to represent 51. 6 percent of operations with horses in the 28 states and 83. 9 percent of horses in the 28 states. Race tracks were not included in this phase of the study. The majority (94. 0 percent) of operations provided resident horses access to pasture in 1998. Overall, greater than 50 percent of operations with pasture access for horses had surface water, such as a stream, lake, pond, or irrigation ditch in the pasture itself. Approximately one-third of operations had resident stallions. Of the operations with stallions, just under one-half (47. 6 percent) used {{one or more of these}} stallions for breeding purposes in the previous 12 months.

Viral protein expression, plaque size, and cytopathogenicity of all three viruses were similar in RK- 13 cells, whereas two virulent strains of EAV were readily distinguished from an avirulent strain by their plaque morphology and cytopathogenicity in primary equine ECs. Furthermore, EAV nucleocapsid protein was detected by flow cytometric analysis significantly later in ECs infected with the avirulent than those infected with the virulent strains of EAV.

Application of these siRNAs led to a significant protection of the cells, and virus titers decreased drastically. siRNAs derived from DNA plasmids expressing small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) were also effective. The protection was most pronounced with two siRNAs targeting the open reading frame 1 (coding for non-structural proteins), whereas siRNAs targeting sequences for several structural proteins had less or no effect. In addition, it was investigated whether RNAi {{could be used to}} treat cells with an already established viral infection. Only application of the siRNAs shortly after viral challenge led to significant survival rates of the cells, whereas transfection at later time points caused much less benefit for the cells.

40|$|Abstract. Equine <b>viral</b> <b>arteritis</b> (EVA) {{can cause}} {{prominent}} economic losses for the equine industry. The {{purpose of this}} review is to provide the pathologist some familiarity with the clinical history, lesions, patho-genesis, and diagnosis of EVA. EVA is caused by an arterivirus (equine arteritis virus, EAV), and the vascular system is the principal but not unique viral target. EVA has variable presentations, including interstitial pneu-monia, panvasculitis with edema, thrombosis and hemorrhage, lymphoid necrosis, renal tubular necrosis, abor-tion, and inflammation of male accessory genital glands. EAV antigen (EAVAg) can be demonstrated within the cytoplasm of epithelial cells such as alveolar pneumocytes, enterocytes, adrenal cortical cells, trophoblasts, thymus stroma, renal tubular cells, and male accessory genital gland cells. It can be also demonstrated within endothelia, in vascular, myometrial, and cardiac myocytes, macrophages, dendritelike cells of lymphoid organs, and chorionic mesenchymal stromal cells. In young and adult horses, following colonization of macrophages, the virus spreads systemically using circulating monocytes and enters the endothelium and tunica media of blood vessels, histiocytes, and dendritelike cells. Eventually, the virus multiplies within renal tubular cells. Lesions are uncommon in the aborted fetus; if present, they are mild, and EAVAg is frequently not detectable within fetal tissues and placenta. The clinical presentation and lesions of EVA may resemble those of other diseases. Complete pathologic examination associated with immunohistochemistry, virus isolation, and, espe...|$|E
40|$|The {{persistently}} infected carrier stallion is {{the critical}} natural reservoir of equine arteritis virus (EAV), as venereal infection of mares frequently occurs after breeding to such stallions. Two Thoroughbred stallions that were infected during the 1984 outbreak of equine <b>viral</b> <b>arteritis</b> in central Kentucky subsequently became long-term EAV carriers. EAV genomes amplified from the semen of these two stallions were compared by sequence analysis of the six 3 ′ open reading frames (ORFs 2 through 7), which encode the four known structural proteins and two uncharacterized glycoproteins. The major variants of the EAV population that sequentially arose within the reproductive tract of each carrier stallion varied by approximately 1 % per year, and the heterogeneity of the viral quasispecies increased {{during the course of}} long-term persistent infection. The various ORFs of the dominant EAV variants evolved independently, and there was apparently strong selective pressure on the uncharacterized GP 3 protein during persistent infection. Amino acid changes also occurred in the V 1 variable region of the GL protein. This region has been previously identified as a crucial neutralization domain, and selective pressures exerted on the V 1 region during persistent EAV infection led to the emergence of virus variants with distinct neutralization properties. Thus, evolution of the EAV quasispecies that occurs during persistent infection of the stallion clearly can influence viral phenotypic properties such as neutralization and perhaps virulence...|$|E

The VB strain primarily infects CD 14 + monocytes and a small subpopulation of CD 3 + T lymphocytes (predominantly CD 4 + T lymphocytes), as determined by dual-color flow cytometry. In contrast, the MLV vaccine strain has a significantly reduced ability to infect CD 14 + monocytes and has lost its capability to infect CD 3 + T lymphocytes. Using a panel of five recombinant chimeric viruses, we demonstrated that interactions among the GP 2, GP 3, GP 4, GP 5, and M envelope proteins {{play a major role}} in determining the CD 14 + monocyte tropism while the tropism for CD 3 + T lymphocytes is determined by the GP 2, GP 4, GP 5, and M envelope proteins but not the GP 3 protein.

EAV infection of equine AMφ, BMφ, and ECs resulted in their activation with increased transcription of genes encoding proinflammatory mediators, including interleukin (IL) - 1 β, IL- 6, IL- 8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α. Furthermore, the virulent KY 84 strain of EAV induced significantly higher levels of mRNA encoding proinflammatory cytokines in infected AMφ and BMφ than did the avirulent CA 95 strain. Treatment of equine ECs with the culture supernatants of EAV-infected AMφ and BMφ also resulted in EC activation with cell surface expression of E-selectin, whereas infection of ECs with purified EAV alone caused only minimal expression of E-selectin. The presence of TNF-α in the culture supernatants of EAV-infected equine AMφ, BMφ, and ECs was confirmed by bioassay, and the virulent KY 84 strain of EAV induced significantly more TNF-α in all cell types than did the avirulent CA 95 strain. Thus, the data indicate that EAV-induced, macrophage-derived cytokines may contribute to the pathogenesis of EVA in horses, and that the magnitude of the cytokine response of equine AMφ, BMφ, and ECs to EAV infection reflects the virulence of the infecting virus strain...|$|E
40|$|Equine <b>viral</b> <b>arteritis</b> (EVA) {{may have}} serious {{economic}} {{impact on the}} equine industry. For this reason, it is monitored in many countries, especially in breeding stock, to avoid its spread during breeding activities. In France, surveillance is mainly based on serological tests, since mares are not vaccinated, but difficulties in interpreting certain series of results may impair the estimation {{of the number of}} outbreaks. In this study, we propose specific rules for identifying seroconversion in order to estimate the number of outbreaks that were detected by the breeding stock surveillance component (BSSC) in France between 2006 and 2013. A consensus among multidisciplinary experts was reached to consider seroconversion as a change in antibody titer from negative to at least 32, or as an eight-fold or greater increase in antibody level. Using these rules, 239 cases and 177 outbreaks were identified. Subsequently, we calculated the BSSC's sensitivity as the ratio of the number of detected outbreaks to the total number of outbreaks that occurred in breeding stock (including unreported outbreaks) estimated using a capture-recapture model. The total number of outbreaks was estimated at 215 (95 % credible interval 195 - 249) and the surveillance sensitivity at 82 % (CrI 95 % 71 - 91). Our results confirm EVA circulation in French breeding stock, show that neutralizing antibodies can persist up to eight years in naturally infected mares and suggest that certain mares have been reinfected. This study shows that the sensitivity of the BSSC is relatively high and supports its relevance to prevent the disease spreading through mating...|$|E
40|$|The {{members of}} the Bureau and other {{participants}} are listed in Appendix I. The Agenda adopted is given in Appendix II. Dr D. Wilson, Head of the International Trade Department, welcomed the {{members of the}} Bureau on behalf of the Director General, Dr B. Vallat, and recalled the extensive work programme for the Code Commission resulting from discussions at the 72 nd General Session, particularly on foot and mouth disease (FMD), avian influenza and a simplified categorisation system for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The Bureau took the opportunity to review the currency of all chapters and appendices in the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code (hereafter referred to as the Terrestrial Code), and the texts which remained under study from previous discussions. Topics which the Bureau considered should be updated as a priority were listed in the future work programme. After cross-checking against the 2004 edition of the OIE Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals (hereafter referred to as the Terrestrial Manual), the Bureau removed the term (under study) from texts for enzootic bovine leucosis, equine <b>viral</b> <b>arteritis</b> and small ruminant semen. The Bureau examined various draft and revised Terrestrial Code chapters and appendices, and comments received on them. The outcome of this part of the Bureau’s work is presented as appendices to this report, with insertions and amendments to existing Terrestrial Code text and previously circulated drafts being shown as double underlined text, and with text proposed for deletion in strikeout. Member Countries are strongly encouraged to comment on all aspects of the report. Comments need to reach th...|$|E
40|$|Previously, we {{have shown}} that horses could be divided into {{susceptible}} and resistant groups based on an in vitro assay using dual-color flow cytometric analysis of CD 3 + T cells infected with equine arteritis virus (EAV). Here, we demonstrate that the differences in in vitro susceptibility of equine CD 3 + T lymphocytes to EAV infection have a genetic basis. To investigate the possible hereditary basis for this trait, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to compare susceptible and resistant phenotypes. Testing of 267 DNA samples from four horse breeds that had a susceptible or a resistant CD 3 + T lymphocyte phenotype using both Illumina Equine SNP 50 BeadChip and Sequenom's MassARRAY system identified a common, genetically dominant haplotype associated with the susceptible phenotype in a region of equine chromosome 11 (ECA 11), positions 49572804 to 49643932. The presence of a common haplotype indicates that the trait occurred in a common ancestor of all four breeds, suggesting {{that it may be}} segregated among other modern horse breeds. Biological pathway analysis revealed several cellular genes within this region of ECA 11 encoding proteins associated with virus attachment and entry, cytoskeletal organization, and NF-κB pathways that may be associated with the trait responsible for the in vitro susceptibility/resistance of CD 3 + T lymphocytes to EAV infection. The data presented in this study demonstrated a strong association of genetic markers with the trait, representing de facto proof that the trait is under genetic control.

40|$|AbstractVirus {{derived from}} an {{infectious}} cDNA clone of equine arteritis virus (EAV 030 H) was intranasally inoculated into two stallions, {{neither of which}} subsequently developed clinical manifestations of equine <b>viral</b> <b>arteritis</b> (EVA). Virus was isolated from nasal swabs and mononuclear cells collected from both stallions ≤ 14 days p. i. and from the semen of one stallion only at 7 days p. i. Similarly, viral RNA was detected by RT nested-PCR in nasal swabs and mononuclear cells for ≤ 14 days p. i. and at 7 days p. i. in the semen of the one stallion. Both stallions seroconverted to EAV by 10 days p. i. and maintained high neutralizing antibody titers thereafter. Sequence and restriction digestion analysis demonstrated that the recombinant virus present in nasal swabs, mononuclear cells, and semen from the two stallions was identical to the infectious clone-derived virus {{that was used to}} inoculate them. Furthermore analysis of multiple clones derived by RT nested-PCR amplification from several samples indicated that the recombinant EAV 030 H virus was stable during replication in horses. These studies document {{for the first time that}} a recombinant virus derived from an infectious cDNA clone of a member of the order Nidovirales is replication competent in animals, and the genetic stability of the recombinant virus during in vivo replication indicates that it will be useful for the characterization of genetic determinants of virulence and persistence of EAV. The genetic conservation of the cloned recombinant virus during in vivo infection is similar to that which occurs during natural horizontal and vertical transmission of EAV in horses and contrasts with the heterogeneous virus population (quasispecies) that occurs in the semen of carrier stallions...|$|E
40|$|Eight {{sexually mature}} horse stallions were inoculated intranasally with a South African asinine strain of EAV, a strain that was {{isolated}} from the semen of a donkey carrier. All horses developed fever, with maximum rectal temperatures of 38, 9 - 39, 9 °C recorded 3 - 6 d post challenge. Six horses showed very mild clinical signs of equine <b>viral</b> <b>arteritis</b> and two were asymptomatic. The virus was recovered from the nasopharynxes of six horses 2 - 7 d after inoculation, and from buffy-coat samples of all horses, 2 - 11 d after inoculation. Seroconversion to EAV was detected on days 8 and 10 and peak serum-virusneutralizing antibody titres ranging from log₁₀ 1, 2 - 1, 8, on days 14 - 20 after challege. The titres varied from log₁₀ 0, 9 - 1, 2 after about 10 weeks, when the experiment was terminated. In three stallions euthanased on days 5, 7 and 9 after challenge, virus was detected inconsistently {{in different parts of}} the reproductive tract and urine. No virus was {{isolated from the}} tissues of the reproductive tract collected from stallions on days 16, 23 and 68 after challenge. Five stallions were bred to six seronegative mares between 13 and 34 d post challenge. No clinical signs of EAV were observed, and neither was seroconversion detected in any of the mares after mating. No virus was recovered from semen samples collected at the time of breeding. The results of this study demonstrated that the tissues of the reproductive tracts of the stallions did not become persistently infected with a South African asinine strain of EAV.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the correlation between}} in vitro susceptibility of CD 3 T lymphocytes to equine arteritis virus (EAV) infection and establishment of persistent infection among 14 stallions following natural infections. The data showed that carrier stallions with a CD 3 T lymphocyte susceptibility phenotype to in vitro EAV infection may be at higher risk of becoming carriers than those that lack this phenotype (P 0. 0002). Equine arteritis virus (EAV) is a small, enveloped virus with apositive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome that belongs to the family Arteriviridae (genus Arterivirus, order Nidovirales) (4, 11). It is the causal agent of equine <b>viral</b> <b>arteritis</b> (EVA), which is a respiratory and reproductive disease of horses andother equids (3, 14). While {{the vast majority of}} natural infections with EAV are unapparent or subclinical (3, 2, 14), occasional outbreaks of EVA occur that are characterized by influenza-like signs in adult horses, abortion in mares, and the possibility of pneumonia in foals (7, 14). Following EAV infection, a variable proportion of stallions (30 to 70 %) can become persistently infected and continuously shed the virus in their semen (14; S. M. Neu, P. J. Timoney, and W. H. McCollum, presented at the 5 th International Conference Equine Infectious Diseases, Lexington, Kentucky, 1987). Carrier stallions are the natural reservoir of EAV; they ensure the virus is maintained in equine populations between breeding seasons (14, 16). The continued growth in the international trade of horses and semen has served as a significant means of dissemination of EAV strains around theworld (1, 8, 13 – 16). Therefore, identification of carrier stallions is of critical epidemiological importance in the prevention and control of EAV infection in countries worldwide (2, 3, 12 – 14). While the mechanism of persistence of EAV in the male reproductive tract is not clear, it has been established that viral persistence in the stallion is testosterone dependent (9; T. V...|$|E
40|$|Blood {{samples from}} 181 equines from the Central Valley of Costa Rica were {{collected}} in the year 2012 to determine the presence of antibodies against selected infectious agents in horses and to determine the risk factors associated with these agents. The presence of antibodies against Equine Infectious Anemia Virus (EIAV), Equine Herpes Virus 1 and 4 (EHV- 1 and EHV- 4), West Nile Virus (WNV), Influenza A Virus (IAV), Equine <b>Viral</b> <b>Arteritis</b> Virus (EVAV), Babesia caballi, Theileria equi, Neospora caninum and Chlamydia abortus was determined using commercial assays, and risk factors associated with seropositivity to the different infectious agents was established. The most seroprevalent agent detected was EHV- 4 (96. 7 %), followed by WNV (44. 2 %), and IAV (41. 8 %). Horses > 3 years, used for work or sports, and with access to pastures, had significantly increased probability to be seropositive to WNV, whereas horses used for breeding and recreational purposes, being stabled, and without access to pastures, had significantly greater probability to be seropositive to IAV. Seroprevalence to B. caballi (19. 9 %) was lower than to T. equi (38. 1 %). For B. caballi, access to pastures was determined as a risk factor, whereas being older than 3 years was established as {{a risk factor for}} T. equi. Low seroprevalences were determined for EHV- 1 (5. 0 %), EVAV (5. 0 %), C. abortus (4. 8 %), and N. caninum (4. 4 %). Mares having history of abortion {{were more likely to be}} seropositive to EHV- 1, whereas horses > 3 years, used for work and sports, and mares having multiple parturitions, were more likely to be seropositive to N. caninum. None of the horses were seropositive to EIAV. Earlier, only diseases caused by EIAV, WNV and piroplasmosis were reported in Costa Rica. The present study however, determined the presence of carriers for EHV- 1, EHV- 4, and EIAV...|$|E
