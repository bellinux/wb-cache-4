40|$|This work {{presents}} a general layer- 2 approach for routing and load balancing in Wireless Infrastructure Mesh Network The key idea is dynamic select routes among {{a set of}} slowly changing alternative network paths. Our approach decou-ples the routing and load balancing problem into two distinct sub-problems: path creation and path selection. Paths are created through the reuse of classical 802. 1 Q multiple span-ning tree mechanisms. This guarantees that, for each formed tree, a path is deployed from each mesh node to the Mesh Gateway. Moreover, each tree (path) is assigned a <b>Virtual</b> LAN <b>identifier.</b> <b>Path</b> selection is driven by a local algorithm running at each mesh node, fed by measurements (taken along each path connecting the mesh node to the gateway) which allow to dynamically determine which are the best paths. In order to route a packet it is sufficient to mark the packet with the VLAN tag corresponding to the chosen path. The described approach provides a very general and flexible framework: performance/stability trade-offs can be tuned through the choice of i) the mechanism used to mea-sure the path quality; ii) the algorithm employed to select the path, and iii) the system parameter used (link costs and link weights) for the multiple spanning tree formation. 1...|$|R
