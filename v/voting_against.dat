5000|$|The bloggers often {{comment on}} {{nominations}} of federal judges, {{especially to the}} Supreme Court.

5|$|The {{convention}} ultimately {{compromised by}} loosening suffrage requirements. It also {{reduced the number}} of delegates and senators to the Virginia General Assembly. The resulting constitution was ratified by a popular majority, though most of the voters {{in the western part of}} the state ended up <b>voting</b> <b>against</b> it. Thus, the underlying intrastate tensions remained, and would have to be addressed later.|$|E

5|$|After his maiden speech, Breckinridge took a {{more active}} role in the House. In debate with Ohio's Joshua Reed Giddings, he defended the Fugitive Slave Law's {{constitutionality}} and criticized Giddings for hindering the return of fugitive slaves. He opposed Tennessee Congressman Andrew Johnson's Homestead Bill, fearing it would create more territories that excluded slavery. Although generally opposed to funding local improvements, he supported the repair of two Potomac River bridges to avoid higher costs later. Other minor stands included supporting measures to benefit his district's hemp farmers, <b>voting</b> <b>against</b> giving the president ten more appointments to the U.S. Naval Academy, and opposing funds for a sculpture of George Washington because the sculptor proposed depicting Washington in a toga.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the city}} of Santa Cruz already {{exhibited}} a strong conservation ethic before {{the founding of the}} university, the coincidental rise of the counterculture of the 1960s with the university's establishment fundamentally altered its subsequent development. Early student and faculty activism at UCSC pioneered an approach to environmentalism that greatly impacted the industrial development of the surrounding area. The lowering of the voting age to 18 in 1971 led to the emergence of a powerful student-voting bloc. A large and growing population of politically liberal UCSC alumni changed the electorate of the town from predominantly Republican to markedly left-leaning, consistently <b>voting</b> <b>against</b> expansion measures {{on the part of both}} town and gown.|$|E
5|$|Among the U.S. {{delegation}} to the 1984 World Population Conference in Mexico City, Keyes was selected by Reagan as deputy chairman. In that capacity, Keyes negotiated {{the language of the}} Mexico City Policy to withhold federal funds from international organizations that support abortion. Additionally, Keyes fought against an Arab-backed UN resolution calling for investigation of Israeli settlements. The measure passed, 83–2, with 15 abstentions and only Israel and the U.S. <b>voting</b> <b>against</b> it. Reagan again appointed Keyes to represent the U.S. at the 1985 Women's Conference in Nairobi.|$|E
5|$|As a legislator, Beshear {{gained a}} {{reputation}} as a consumer advocate, and sponsored bills to increase environmental protections and end the practice of commercial bail bonding. In 1974, Beshear voted against a resolution condemning the practice of desegregation busing because it called for changes to the federal constitution. One of his major accomplishments in the House was spearheading legislation to improve neonatal care at the University of Kentucky Medical Center. Although he considered a 1978 bill requiring the posting of the Ten Commandments in Kentucky classrooms to be unconstitutional, he abstained from voting on it rather than <b>voting</b> <b>against</b> it, a move he later claimed he regretted.|$|E

5|$|Subsequently, Jimmy Carter {{became the}} first Democratic {{president}} to use a Saxbe fix when he appointed Senator Edmund Muskie as his Secretary of State. Cyrus Vance had resigned on April 28, 1980. (Ironically, Muskie {{had been one of}} the ten senators <b>voting</b> <b>against</b> Saxbe's confirmation.) Carter nominated Muskie on April 29, and the Senate confirmed Muskie on May 7 by a 94–2 vote. Unlike the Knox and Saxbe fixes, the salary reduction to allow Muskie's appointment was temporary, reducing the salary only for the duration of Muskie's tenure. When Carter appointed Representative Abner Mikva to the D.C. Circuit, a lawsuit challenging the appointment based on Ineligibility Clause objections again failed for lack of standing.|$|E
5|$|Conference Premier rivals York City made a £10,000 bid for Charles in June, {{which was}} {{subsequently}} rejected, with MyFootballClub members <b>voting</b> <b>against</b> the offer with over a 98% majority. Following this, York manager Martin Foyle {{said it was}} unlikely they would increase their offer for Charles. Ebbsfleet later agreed to sell Charles and striker Michael Gash for a combined fee of £80,000 to an unnamed club, which was revealed to be York and he {{was reported to have}} signed on 29 June 2009. However, the deal eventually fell through after Charles decided against joining the club as {{he did not want to}} relocate to York. Shortly after Ebbsfleet received an enquiry about him from an unnamed League Two club, although nothing came of this interest. He later became Ebbsfleet captain and was sent off for dissent in a 1–0 defeat to Tamworth on 21 November 2009. He made 42 appearances for Ebbsfleet during the 2009–10 as they were relegated to the Conference South.|$|E
5|$|Hinkley Point C {{nuclear power}} station is a project to {{construct}} a 3,200 MW two reactor {{nuclear power station}}. On 18 October 2010, the British government announced that Hinkley Point– already {{the site of the}} disused Hinkley Point A and the still operational Hinkley Point B power stations– was one of the eight sites it considered suitable for future nuclear power stations. NNB Generation Company, a subsidiary of EDF, submitted an application for development consent to the Infrastructure Planning Commission on 31 October 2011. A protest group, Stop Hinkley, was formed to campaign for the closure of Hinkley Point B and oppose any expansion at the Hinkley Point site. In December 2013, the European Commission opened an investigation to assess whether the project breaks state-aid rules. On 8 October 2014 it was announced that the European Commission has approved the project, with an overwhelming majority and only four commissioners <b>voting</b> <b>against</b> the decision.|$|E

5|$|The {{unsuccessful}} Chicago 2016 Olympic bid {{placed the}} main {{site of the}} $1.1 billion residential complex, which would have accommodated athletes in an Olympic Village in the 4th Ward. Preckwinkle expressed her reservations about the initial plan, and was involved in plan revisions. Since the planned construction was almost entirely in her ward, she expressed concern that her constituents were not offered a chance to voice their concerns with the plan. She was an early advocate of moving {{what would have been}} the Olympic Village from the McCormick Place truck yard to the Michael Reese Hospital site. On March 14, 2007, Preckwinkle joined four other South Side aldermen in <b>voting</b> <b>against</b> a $500 million public-funded guarantee to back up Chicago's Olympics bid. On September 9, 2009, Preckwinkle voted to authorize Mayor Richard Daley to sign the International Olympic Committee's host city contract that included financial guarantees putting full responsibility for the Olympics and its proposed $4.8 billion operating budget on taxpayers.|$|E
5|$|During {{her maiden}} speech on 17 May 1999, Lamont {{was the first}} MSP to use Gaelic at a sitting of the Parliament. She served {{on a number of}} the Parliament's {{committees}} during her first term in office, including the Equal Opportunities Committee, the Local Government Committee and the Social Justice Committee. She became convener of the Social Justice Committee in 2001. In 2000 she became the first Labour MSP to rebel against the Labour-led administration when she threatened to lead backbenchers in <b>voting</b> <b>against</b> a planned Scottish Executive attempt to block the Abolition of Poindings and Warrant Sales Bill, which had been introduced by Sheridan. The move resulted in the withdrawal of the amendment, and a crucial parliamentary vote in favour of the legislation. At a session of First Minister's Questions in 2002, she narrowly avoided becoming the first MSP to be ejected from the parliament after continuing to speak when Presiding Officer David Steel had told her to sit down. Steel felt her supplementary question about youth crime was too long, but the incident led to a heated parliamentary debate, and accusations from Lamont's colleague, Labour's Helen Eadie that the Presiding Officer was not treating male and female MSPs equally, an allegation he rejected.|$|E
5|$|On February 15, 2008, Beshear {{unveiled}} his promised {{legislation that}} would allow casino gambling in Kentucky. Beshear's plan included a constitutional amendment allowing 12 casinos to be licensed in the state – seven {{at each of the}} state's horse racetracks and five additional free-standing casinos – and a companion bill specifying how the increased revenues would be spent. After the plan encountered initial resistance, House leadership reduced the number of casinos that would have been allowed to by the amendment to nine. One proposal, authored by House Speaker Jody Richards, would have guaranteed five casino licenses to the state's racetracks and allowed the other four to go to free-standing casinos. A competing measure, drafted by House Majority Whip Rob Wilkey and Speaker Pro Tem Larry Clark, would have allowed all nine licenses to be awarded competitively, with none specifically reserved for racetracks. In late February, the House Elections, Constitutional Amendments, and Intergovernmental Affairs committee failed to advance either proposal to the full floor of the House of Representatives. The following day, Speaker Richards removed Representative Dottie Sims from the committee; Sims claimed Richards retaliated against her for <b>voting</b> <b>against</b> the proposals, but Richards said he removed Sims because she told him she would vote for the proposals and then voted against them. Following Sims' removal the committee passed the amendment.|$|E
