40|$|Abstract—Cryogenic {{treatment}} {{is the process}} of cooling a material to extremely low temperatures to generate enhanced mechanical and physical properties. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the effect of cryogenic treatment on the impact behavior of En 52 and 21 - 4 N valve steels. The valve steels are subjected to shallow (193 K) and deep cryogenic treatment (85 K), and the impact behavior is compared with the <b>valve</b> <b>steel</b> materials subjected to conventional heat treatment. The impact test is carried out in accordance with the ASTM E 23 - 02 a standard. The results show an improvement of 23 % in the impact energy for the En 52 deep cryo-treated samples when compared to that of the conventionally heat treated samples. It is revealed that during cryogenic treatment fine platelets of martensite are formed from the retained austenite, and these platelets promote the precipitation of fine carbides by a diffusion mechanism during tempering.

40|$|Due to the environmental, {{energy saving}} and {{economic}} requirements, development {{of very high}} efficient compressors is of great importance. Consequently, flapper valve material becomes a critical issue and a limiting factor {{for the development of}} compressor. This paper provides a discussion on the material selection of the flapper valve for the compressors with very high efficiency, based mainly on a basic research on the mechanisms of impact fatigue and a FEM simulation on the formation of stress concentration in the flapper valve during the impact process. Impact fatigue initiation is caused by the initial impact stress, but the fatigue crack propagation is caused by a wavy stress propagation. This causes the formation of secondary cracks at the stress concentration points where two stress waves have the same phase. The results indicate that the flapper valve materials for the very high efficient compressors should have both high impact fatigue strength for the initial stress, and high stress damping capacity to reduce the crack propagation rate. Most recent developed flapper <b>valve</b> <b>steel,</b> Sandvik Hiflex™, shows both higher impact fatigue strength and higher damping capacity comparing with other commercial flapper valve steels available. This flapper <b>valve</b> <b>steel</b> material has successfully been used in the newly developed high efficient compressors recently. Some case stories have been discussed...|$|E

40|$|The {{detonation}} gun sprayed Fe-Al type coatings as {{an alternative}} for austenitic <b>valve</b> <b>steel,</b> were investigated using two different methods of testing corrosion resistance. High temperature, 10 -hour isothermal oxidation experiments at 550, 750, 950 and 1100 °C show differences in the oxidation behavior of Fe-Al type coatings under air atmosphere. The oxide layer ensures satisfying oxidation resistance, even at 950 and 1100 °C. Hematite, α-Al 2 O 3 and metastable alumina phases were noticed on the coatings top surface, which preserves its initial thickness providing protection to the underlying substrate. In general, only negligible changes of the phase composition of the coatings were noticed with simultaneous strengthening controlled in the micro-hardness measurements, even after 10 -hours of heating at 1100 °C. On the other hand, the electrochemical corrosion tests, which were carried out in 200 ppm Cl− (NaCl) and pH ~ 4 (H 2 SO 4) solution to simulate the acid-rain environment, reveal higher values of the breakdown potential for D-gun sprayed Fe-Al type coatings than the ones for the bulk Fe-Al type alloy and Cr 21 Mn 9 Ni 4 austenitic <b>valve</b> <b>steel.</b> This enables these materials {{to be used in}} structural and multifunctional applications in aggressive environments, including acidic ones...|$|E

Monolithic (of <b>valve</b> <b>steel)</b> and bimetallic valves produced with the same technology have been compared, the external layer of bimetallic valves being of the <b>valve</b> <b>steel</b> and the internal of steel 45. Results of valve heating research and measured temperatures {{on the surface of}} a valve and a guide have been presented. Model computations have been carried out using the finite elements method, temperatures distribution in a valve placed on the measuring position and during operation of an engine. Also, the impact of a crevice between a guide and a valve on the carrying away of heat have been analyzed (width of the crevice and its lubrication). For the purpose of the analysis a model of a guide together with a guide has been built. On the basis of analysis of heat emitted in the combustion chamber and the outlet channel, the conditions of heat transfer have been determined. The results of the analyses have been presented and compared with the research results. It has been stated that in case of using the bimetallic valves the amount of heat taken from the walls of the combustion chamber and from the outlet channel is higher, which enables their application in engines more loaded in terms of heat loading. Application of this type of valves enables also to reduce the production costs. 1...|$|E

Finished valve strip of each candidate material was used to quantify microstructure, tensile strength and fatigue life. Fracture investigations on the fatigue test samples were undertaken to detect any contributing non-metallic inclusions. Vibration damping was measured at temperatures and frequencies corresponding to operating conditions of reed valves in a compressor.

40|$|Abstract. In this study, CrZrN {{film was}} {{deposited}} on AISI 4130 cylinder barrel and valve plate using a unbalanced magnetron sputtering. The tribological properties between a coated steel cylinder barrel and coated <b>steel</b> <b>valve</b> plate {{were evaluated by}} a custom-built disk-to-disk tribometer {{and the results were}} compared with those between a coated steel cylinder barrel and a conventional bronze valve plate. The lowest friction coefficients were observed between a coated steel cylinder barrel and coated <b>steel</b> <b>valve</b> plate and they were approximately one half of those between a coated steel cylinder barrel and conventional bronze valve plate in the range of testing up to 1600 rpm. Coated valve plate and bronze valve plate showed a steady state of friction coefficient at approximately 0. 03 and 0. 06, respectively after about 1000 rpm, but <b>steel</b> <b>valve</b> plate without coating showed a continuous decrease in friction coefficient, which suggested that active wear is continuously occurring. By applying CrZrN coating on the commercial cylinder barrel and <b>steel</b> <b>valve</b> plate, much improved tribological results could be obtained, by a factor of approximately 2 in terms of friction coefficient than those from bronze valve plate. Under a tap water environment CrZrN coating appeared to perform better than CrSiN coating. Although further work to reduce the friction coefficient below 0. 13 in the steady state after initial drop is still needed, possibilities of applying CrZrN coating to realize a water hydraulic pump were demonstrated through the present work...|$|R

Basic properties such as tribological and erosion resistance as well as high temperature oxidation resistance were determined. Testing conditions were accepted with certain simplification owing {{to the complexity of}} mechanical and thermal load exhaust valves and, therefore, they do not reflect real operating conditions accurately. Specimens with and without laser, plasma and TIG pad welded stellite layers were subject to tests. The conducted tests showed the highest tribological resistance of stellite layers under the conditions of dry friction in comparison with the material in the initial state as well as plasma and TIG pad welded stellite layers. The main mechanism of the abrasive wear of the surface layer is an adhesive wear by breaking the connections and adhesions that are being formed. The research on wear by abrasive erosion showed a smaller decrease in the mass of specimens with pad welded stellite layers in comparison with plasma and TIG pad welded stellite layers as well as the material in the initial form without the pad welded stellite layer. The resistance of stellite layers to high temperature oxidation was showed in the research on heat resistance. Moreover, it was found that pad welding does not have any significant influence on the heat resistance of stellite layers...|$|R
