Accordingly, passports issued to Lebanese born in Hong Kong, Macau or Taiwan now only list the place of birth, without an accompanying three-letter country code, unless upon request.|$|E

Choosing to go through Turkey to Sweden was because I’m Palestinian and, because I’m Palestinian, I can’t get a <b>visa</b> <b>to</b> any Arab country, so I had to go that way.

5|$|In 2003, 80 Taiwanese {{practitioners}} {{were blocked}} from entering Hong Kong, {{and again in}} 2007, hundreds more Taiwanese were blocked from entering Hong Kong or detained at the airport, These events set off a six-year human rights case that tested {{the integrity of the}} one country, two systems arrangement. In 2009, Falun Gong's case against the Hong Kong immigration department was dismissed. Months later, Hong Kong immigration officials denied <b>visas</b> <b>to</b> several members of the Falun Gong-affiliated Shen Yun dance company, which was scheduled to perform in the territory in January 2010. Democratic Party chairman Albert Ho said the denial of the visas was a worrying new erosion of Hong Kong's freedoms, and damaged the reputation of Hong Kong as a liberal and open society. A court ruling in March 2010 overturned the Immigration Department's decision.|$|E

On June 23, Yeah! was released, followed by the release of Hell Yeah on August 18. Guitarists White and Hodgson were unavailable, so Konietzko recruited Chris Harms from Lord of the Lost to record the guitar parts. Harms, along with Lord of the Lost bandmates Pi (guitar) and Gared Dirge (keyboards), had been slated to perform as the live band for KMFDM's late 2017 tour. Lord of the Lost were unable to secure work <b>visas</b> <b>to</b> enter the U.S., so Andee Blacksugar was tapped to handle guitar tasks instead.|$|E

5|$|In March 2000, he {{left for}} Pakistan with Waleed and Ahmed al-Nami; later, {{they went on to}} Afghanistan. Wail al-Shehri {{followed}} the standard path for new al-Qaeda recruits in Afghanistan, spending time in the Khalden training camp and then Al Farouq training camp near Kandahar. Details on how the non-pilot ("muscle") hijackers were chosen for the September 11 attacks are vague, though the hijackers appear to have been selected by senior al-Qaeda leaders in 2000 from the thousands of recruits at training camps in Afghanistan. The most capable and motivated volunteers were at al-Farouq, and Saudi citizens were good candidates, since it would be easy for them to obtain <b>visas</b> <b>to</b> travel to the United States. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director George Tenet later said that the muscle hijackers were probably told little about their mission in the United States.|$|E
5|$|The Boys from Baghdad High {{received}} its world première at the 2007 Sheffield Doc/Fest, an annual film festival for documentary productions held in Sheffield, South Yorkshire.

The first time Winter and O'Mahoney met {{one of the}} film's subjects was at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival, nearly {{a year after the}} filming had completed. Ali and his family had relocated to the US since completing the documentary, and so he was able to attend the screening. Winter and Ali met a second time at the Traverse City Film Festival. The producers had tried to get the boys <b>visas</b> <b>to</b> enter the UK for a screening in London, but they were denied entry by the British Government.|$|E
5|$|The drive {{towards a}} boycott {{was fueled by}} {{the large number of}} African nations which became {{independent}} in the late 1950s and early 1960s. To prevent the new nations from overwhelming the ISFs, Brundage proposed that the federations adopt weighted voting systems to allow earlier members to wield disproportionate influence, which some did. By 1962, with the suspension of South Africa from FIFA (the association football governing body), Brundage had come around to the position that South Africa's racist policies were inconsistent with the ideals of the Olympic movement. At the 1963 IOC session in Baden-Baden (moved there from Nairobi when Kenyan officials refused to issue <b>visas</b> <b>to</b> South African representatives), the IOC voted to suspend South Africa from the Olympics unless its NOC and government adopted non-discrimination policies regarding Olympic selection. This did not come to pass, and South Africa did not participate in 1964. In 1968, Brundage and the IOC invited a South African team (supposedly to be multiracial) to the Mexico City Games, but under a threatened boycott and with evidence of minimal South African compliance, withdrew it.|$|E

5|$|The tournament {{initially}} {{began with}} the Americas, China, Europe, and Southeast Asia open region qualifiers in June. The winners of each region {{then went on to}} the main qualifiers, which also took place in June. Winners of the regional qualifier earned an invite to the main event, while a secondary playoff bracket took place for teams in 2nd–5th place, with the winner of those also earning an invite. Six teams were directly invited without need for qualifying, which was based on consistently good results at previous Dota 2 events. However, The International 2015 champion team Evil Geniuses did not receive a direct invite due to breaking Valve's rules on roster swapping after the completion of the last premier Dota 2 tournament, the Manila Major, in June. They and Team Secret, who also broke the same rule, were forced to make their way through the open and main qualifiers, eventually finishing first in their respective regions, gaining an invite. Two teams from the Philippines, TnC Gaming and Execration, had issues securing travel <b>visas</b> <b>to</b> the United States, but were eventually able to get them one week before the event due to assistance from Filipino senator Bam Aquino.|$|E
