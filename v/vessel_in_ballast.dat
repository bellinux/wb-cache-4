50|$|Gas tankers {{and product}} {{carriers}} cannot rely on flue gas systems (because they require IG with O2 content of 1% or less) and so use inert gas generators instead. The inert gas generator {{consists of a}} combustion chamber and scrubber unit supplied by fans and a refrigeration unit which cools the gas. A drier in series with the system removes moisture from the gas before it is supplied to the deck. Cargo tanks on gas carriers are not inerted, but the hold space around them is. This arrangement allows the tanks to be kept cool using a small heel of cargo while the <b>vessel</b> is <b>in</b> <b>ballast</b> while retaining the explosion protection provided by the inert gas.|$|R

50|$|This {{pattern of}} trading was {{repeated}} {{for almost all}} the Evan Thomas, Radcliffe ships with little variation until 1912-13 {{when there was a}} decline in the trade. Gradually the Black Sea trade declined and Evan Thomas, Radcliffe, in common with other Cardiff shipowners, had to look elsewhere for their trade. The Black Sea trade in its heyday was a very lucrative business and the carriage of coal from South Wales outwards and grain from southern Russia inwards really provided the basis of success for Evan Thomas, Radcliffe. <b>Vessels</b> rarely sailed <b>in</b> <b>ballast</b> except for short voyages from the points of discharge of coal to the Black Sea and from continental ports to Cardiff or Barry.|$|R
60|$|The {{opportunities}} for figurative flying were not wanting. There were no <b>vessels</b> <b>in</b> the port {{which might be}} engaged for an indeterminate voyage {{in pursuit of a}} British man-of-war, but there was a goodly sloop about to sail <b>in</b> <b>ballast</b> for Belize. Before sunset three passages were engaged upon this sloop.|$|R

The research about the heavy metal content of ballast water of commercial vessels, both passenger or cargo <b>vessels,</b> berthing <b>in</b> Port of Tanjung Emas Semarang (PTES), has been conducted by using method of AAS (Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy). Sample was gathered from <b>vessels</b> berthed <b>in</b> PTES, dated on December 18 th 2014 to October 21 st 2015. Results of the research show that the mean content of Pb <b>in</b> <b>ballast</b> water tank is 0. 37192 mg. l- 1.

5000|$|If a {{cargo vessel}} (such as a tanker, bulk carrier or {{container}} ship) wishes to travel empty or partially empty {{to collect a}} cargo, it must travel <b>in</b> <b>ballast.</b> This keeps the <b>vessel</b> <b>in</b> trim, and keeps the propeller and rudder submerged. Typically, being [...] "in ballast" [...] will mean flooding the ballast tanks with sea water. Serious problems arise when the ballast water is discharged, as water-borne organisms may create havoc when deposited in new environments.|$|R
60|$|We {{first went}} into Batavia, {{and entered the}} ship; after which, we sailed for a roadstead, called Terragall, to take <b>in</b> rice. The <b>vessel</b> was <b>in</b> <b>ballast,</b> and had brought money to make her {{purchases}} with. We got our cargo off in boats, and sailed for Batavia, to clear; all within a few weeks. The second night out, the ship struck, in fair weather, and a moderate sea, on a mud-bank; and brought up all standing. We first endeavoured to force the vessel over the bank; but this did not succeed; and, the tide leaving her, the ship fell over on her bilge; bringing her gunwales under water. Luckily, she lay quiet; though a good deal strained. The captain now took a boat, and four men, and pulled ashore, to get prows, to lighten the vessel. We had but eight men before the mast, and six aft. This, of course, left only nine souls on board. That night nothing occurred; but, in the morning early, two piratical prows approached, and showed a disposition to board us. Mr. Croes was the person who saved the ship. He stuck up handspikes, and other objects, about deck; putting hats and caps on them, {{so as to make}} us appear very strong-handed. At the same time, we got a couple of sixes to bear on the prows; and succeeded in keeping them at a safe distance. They hovered about until sunset, when they left us; pulling ashore. Just as they were quitting us, twenty-seven boats hove in sight; and we made a signal to them, which was not answered. We set them down as enemies, too; but, as they came nearer, we perceived our own boat among them, and felt certain it was the captain.|$|R

5000|$|Dame Ernouf (1807 − 1809), {{made several}} cruises under Alexis Grassin who had earlier captained Général Ernouf. On 11 September 1808, Dame Ernouf {{captured}} Brutus, Edwards, master, of and for New York. She was returning from Bengal {{when she was}} captured. Her captors sent her into Cayenne where she arrived on 5 October; Brutus was condemned there. Dame Ernouf reportedly was a brig of 185 tons (French). On 17 June 1809 she left Guadeloupe, carrying Madame Ernouf back to France for her health. Dame Ernouf arrived at Lorient on 28 July. On this voyage she captured several British merchant vessels: schooner Antelope and brig Hanna, and the ships Joseph, Swifise sic, and Diana. Lloyds List describes Antelope as a Spanish schooner that Dame Ernouf, of six guns, captured on 17 June as Antelope was sailing from St Thomass to Martinique. A report from Paris dated 1 March 1810 stated that Dame Ernouf had recently arrived with three prizes, a ship carrying sugar, coffee, and indigo, a brig with cotton, and a ship with oil and cod. The last readily accessible report states that on 24 July 1810 Dame Ernouf captured two Spanish <b>vessels,</b> one sailing <b>in</b> <b>ballast</b> from London to Caracas, and the other carrying ironmongery from Bristol to Cadiz. Dame Ernouf sank the first and sent the second into Brest. In 1809, she was decommissioned in Nantes; she was soon recommissioned as a privateer under the name Diligent. Under her new name, she made several successful cruises under Grassin.|$|R
