25|$|Several {{technological}} innovations {{were incorporated into}} the house’s design, including a state-of-the-art heating and cooling system, {{as well as a}} central <b>vacuum</b> <b>system.</b> The Purcell home had a telephone nook, an electric call system for the maid, and a spring-loaded pocket door to the kitchen, activated through buttons in the floor.|$|E

25|$|A TEM is {{composed}} of several components, which include a <b>vacuum</b> <b>system</b> in which the electrons travel, an electron emission source for generation of the electron stream, a series of electromagnetic lenses, as well as electrostatic plates. The latter two allow the operator to guide and manipulate the beam as required. Also required is a device to allow the insertion into, motion within, and removal of specimens from the beam path. Imaging devices are subsequently used to create an image from the electrons that exit the system.|$|E
25|$|High-voltage TEMs require ultra-high vacuums on {{the range}} of 10−7 to 10−9 Pa to prevent the {{generation}} of an electrical arc, particularly at the TEM cathode. As such for higher voltage TEMs a third <b>vacuum</b> <b>system</b> may operate, with the gun isolated from the main chamber either by gate valves or a differential pumping aperture – a small hole that prevents the diffusion of gas molecules into the higher vacuum gun area faster than they can be pumped out. For these very low pressures, either an ion pump or a getter material is used.|$|E
25|$|The Ames Arc Jet Complex is an {{advanced}} thermophysics facility where sustained hypersonic- and hyperthermal testing of vehicular thermoprotective systems takes place under {{a variety of}} simulated flight- and re-entry conditions. Of its seven available test bays, four currently contain Arc Jet units of differing configurations, serviced by common facility support equipment. These are the Aerodynamic Heating Facility (AHF), the Turbulent Flow Duct (TFD), the Panel Test Facility (PTF), and the Interaction Heating Facility (IHF). The support equipment includes two D.C. power supplies, a steam ejector-driven <b>vacuum</b> <b>system,</b> a water-cooling system, high-pressure gas systems, data acquisition system, and other auxiliary systems.|$|E

25|$|Milking is now {{performed}} {{almost exclusively}} by machine, though human technicians are still essential on most facilities. The most common milking machine {{is called a}} cluster milker. This milker consists of four metal cups—one per teat—each lined with rubber or silicon. The cluster is attached to both a milk collection system and a pulsating <b>vacuum</b> <b>system.</b> When the vacuum is on, it pulls air from between the outer metal cup and the liner, drawing milk out of the teat. When the vacuum turns off, it gives the teat an opportunity to refill with milk. In most milking systems, a milking technician must attach the cluster to each cow, but the machine senses when the cow has been fully milked and drops off independently.|$|E
25|$|The mass {{spectrum}} {{can be used}} to determine the mass of the analytes, their elemental and isotopic composition, or to elucidate the chemical structure of the sample. MS is an experiment that must take place in gas phase and under vacuum (1.33 * 10−2 to 1.33 * 10−6 pascal). Therefore, the development of devices facilitating the transition from samples at higher pressure and in condensed phase (solid or liquid) into a <b>vacuum</b> <b>system</b> has been essential to develop MS as a potent tool for identification and quantification of organic compounds and peptides. MS is now in very common use in analytical laboratories that study physical, chemical, or biological properties of a great variety of compounds. Among the many different kinds of mass analyzers, the ones that find application in LC-MS systems are the quadropole, time-of-flight (TOF), ion traps, and hybrid quadropole-TOF (QTOF) analyzers.|$|E
25|$|The <b>vacuum</b> <b>system</b> for {{evacuating}} a TEM to {{an operating}} pressure level consists of several stages. Initially, a low or roughing vacuum is achieved {{with either a}} rotary vane pump or diaphragm pumps setting a sufficiently low pressure to allow the operation of a turbo-molecular or diffusion pump establishing high vacuum level necessary for operations. To allow for the low vacuum pump to not require continuous operation, while continually operating the turbo-molecular pumps, the vacuum side of a low-pressure pump may be connected to chambers which accommodate the exhaust gases from the turbo-molecular pump. Sections of the TEM may be isolated {{by the use of}} pressure-limiting apertures to allow for different vacuum levels in specific areas such as a higher vacuum of 10−4 to 10−7 Pa or higher in the electron gun in high-resolution or field-emission TEMs.|$|E

25|$|The {{successful}} {{outcome of}} fat-graft breast augmentation {{is enhanced by}} achieving a pre-expanded recipient site to create the breast-tissue matrix that will receive grafts of autologous adipocyte fat. The recipient site is expanded with an external vacuum tissue-expander applied upon each breast. The biological effect of negative pressure (vacuum) expansion upon soft tissues derives from the ability of soft tissues to grow when subjected to controlled, distractive, mechanical forces. (see distraction osteogenesis) The study Non-surgical Breast Enlargement using an External Soft Tissue Expansion System (2000) reported the technical effectiveness of recipient-site pre-expansion. In a single-group study, 17 healthy women (aged 18–40 years) wore a brassiere-like <b>vacuum</b> <b>system</b> that applied a 20-mmHg vacuum (controlled, mechanical, distraction force) to each breast for 10–12 hours daily for 10-weeks. Pre- and post-procedure, the breast volume (size) was periodically measured; likewise, a magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the breast-tissue architecture and water density was taken during the same phase of the patient's menstrual cycle; of the 17-woman study group, 12 completed the study, and 5 withdrew, because of non-compliance with the clinical trial protocol.|$|E
2500|$|Milking {{machines}} {{are held in}} place automatically by a <b>vacuum</b> <b>system</b> that draws the ambient air pressure down from [...] of vacuum. The vacuum {{is also used to}} lift milk vertically through small diameter hoses, into the receiving can. A milk lift pump draws the milk from the receiving can through large diameter stainless steel piping, through the plate cooler, then into a refrigerated bulk tank.|$|E

The milk is pulled up into the milk-return pipe by the <b>vacuum</b> <b>system,</b> and then flows by gravity to the milkhouse vacuum-breaker that puts the milk in the storage tank. The {{pipeline}} system greatly reduced the physical labor of milking since the farmer no longer needed to carry around huge heavy buckets of milk from each cow.|$|E

50|$|The most {{prevalent}} outgassing product in <b>vacuum</b> <b>systems</b> is water absorbed by chamber materials. It {{can be reduced}} by desiccating or baking the chamber, and removing absorbent materials. Outgassed water can condense in the oil of rotary vane pumps and reduce their net speed drastically if gas ballasting is not used. High <b>vacuum</b> <b>systems</b> must be clean and free of organic matter to minimize outgassing.|$|R
2500|$|Sources {{that operate}} at room {{temperature}} have the disadvantage that they rapidly become covered with adsorbate molecules that arrive from the <b>vacuum</b> <b>system</b> walls, and the emitter has to be cleaned {{from time to time}} by [...] "flashing" [...] to high temperature. Nowadays, it is more common to use Mueller-emitter-based sources that are operated at elevated temperatures, either in the Schottky emission regime or in the so-called temperature-field intermediate regime. Many modern high-resolution electron microscopes and electron beam instruments use some form of Mueller-emitter-based electron source. Currently, attempts are being made to develop carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as electron-gun field emission sources.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a typical}} SEM, an {{electron}} beam is thermionically emitted from an electron gun {{fitted with a}} tungsten filament cathode. Tungsten is normally used in thermionic electron guns because it has the highest melting point and lowest vapor pressure of all metals, thereby allowing it to be electrically heated for electron emission, and because of its low cost. Other types of electron emitters include lanthanum hexaboride (...) cathodes, {{which can be used}} in a standard tungsten filament SEM if the <b>vacuum</b> <b>system</b> is upgraded or field emission guns (FEG), which may be of the cold-cathode type using tungsten single crystal emitters or the thermally assisted Schottky type, that use emitters of zirconium oxide.|$|E
2500|$|The Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Switzerland, was {{designed}} specifically {{to be able to}} either confirm or exclude the existence of the Higgs boson. Built in a 27km tunnel under the ground near Geneva originally inhabited by LEP, it {{was designed}} to collide two beams of protons, initially at energies of [...] per beam (7TeV total), or almost 3.6 times that of the Tevatron, and upgradeable to [...] (14TeV total) in future. Theory suggested if the Higgs boson existed, collisions at these energy levels should be able to reveal it. As one of the most complicated scientific instruments ever built, its operational readiness was delayed for 14 months by a magnet quench event nine days after its inaugural tests, caused by a faulty electrical connection that damaged over 50 superconducting magnets and contaminated the <b>vacuum</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

2500|$|To {{conduct an}} atom probe {{experiment}} {{a very sharp}} needle shaped specimen is placed in an ultra high vacuum chamber. After introduction into the <b>vacuum</b> <b>system,</b> the sample is reduced to cryogenic temperatures (typically 20-100K) and manipulated such that the needle's point is aimed towards an ion detector. A high voltage {{is applied to the}} specimen, and either a laser pulse is applied to the specimen or a voltage pulse (typically 1-2kV) with pulse repetition rates in the hundreds of kilohertz range is applied to a counter electrode. The application of the pulse to the sample allows for individual atoms at the sample surface to be ejected as an ion from the sample surface at a known time. [...] Typically the pulse amplitude and the high voltage on the specimen are computer controlled to encourage only one atom to ionize at a time, but multiple ionizations are possible. The delay between application of the pulse and detection of the ion(s) at the detector allow for the computation of a mass-to-charge ratio.|$|E
2500|$|The {{front part}} of the hub {{contained}} a nearly spherical landing capsule [...] in diameter and weighing [...] Compared to previous (failed) Venera probes, the capsule contained an improved heat shield which could withstand temperatures up to [...] Instead of the previous liquid-based cooling design, a simpler and more reliable gas system was installed. The durability of the capsule was checked by exposing it to high temperatures, pressures and accelerations using three unique testing installations. The heat resistance was checked in a high-temperature <b>vacuum</b> <b>system</b> emulating the upper layers of the atmosphere. The capsule was also pressurized up to 25 atmospheres. (The surface pressure on Venus was unknown at the time. [...] Estimates ranged from a few to hundreds of atmospheres). Finally, it was subjected to accelerations of up to 450 g in a centrifuge. The centrifuge test caused cracking of electronic components and cable brackets, which were all replaced shortly before launch. The timing for launch was rather tight, {{so as not to}} miss the launch window—the days of the year when the path to the destination planet from Earth is energetically least demanding.|$|E
2500|$|The thermospray (TSP) {{interface}} {{was developed}} in 1983 by Vestal laboratories at the University of Houston. The interface resulted from a long term research project intended to find a LC-MS interface capable of handling high flow rates (1 ml/min) and avoiding the flow split in DLI interfaces.The TSP interface was composed by a heated probe, a desolvation chamber, and an ion exchange skimmer. The LC effluent passed through the heated probe and emerged as a jet of vapor and small droplets flowing into the desolvation chamber at low pressure. The ionization of solutes occurred by direct evaporation or ion-molecule reactions induced by the solvent. This interface was able to handle up to 2 ml/min of eluate from the LC column and would efficiently introduce it into the MS <b>vacuum</b> <b>system.</b> TSP was also more suitable for LC-MS applications involving reversed phase liquid chromatography (RT-LC). The TSP system had a dual function acting as an interface and a solvent-mediated chemical ionization source. With time, the mechanical complexity of TSP was simplified, and this interface became popular as the first ideal LC-MS interface for pharmaceutical applications comprising the [...] analysis of drugs, metabolites, conjugates, nucleosides, peptides, natural products, and pesticides. The introduction of TSP marked a significant improvement for LC-MS systems and was the most widely applied interface {{until the beginning of}} the 1990s, when it began to be replaced by interfaces involving atmospheric pressure ionization (API).|$|E
