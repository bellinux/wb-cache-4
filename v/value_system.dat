50|$|One {{possible}} {{reply to}} {{this argument is}} that only a naive interpretation of negative utilitarianism would endorse world destruction. The conclusion can be mitigated by pointing out the importance of cooperation between different <b>value</b> <b>systems.</b> There are good consequentialist reasons why one should be cooperative towards other <b>value</b> <b>systems</b> and it is particularly important to avoid doing something harmful to other <b>value</b> <b>systems.</b> The destruction {{of the world would}} strongly violate many other <b>value</b> <b>systems</b> and endorsing it would therefore be uncooperative. Since {{there are many ways to}} reduce suffering which do not infringe on other <b>value</b> <b>systems,</b> it makes sense for negative utilitarians to focus on these options. In an extended interpretation of negative utilitarianism, cooperation with other <b>value</b> <b>systems</b> is considered and the conclusion is that it is better to reduce suffering without violating other <b>value</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a view of}} innovation as a process that changes <b>value</b> <b>systems</b> of producers and adopters of creative design ideas. <b>Value</b> <b>systems</b> comprise interpretations of the function and behaviour of an artefact, encapsulated in a producer’s or adopter’s situation. Changes in these <b>value</b> <b>systems</b> can be induced using distinct classes of processes. The paper shows that innovation requires changes in the encapsulated <b>value</b> <b>systems</b> of both producers and adopters, driven by their interactions with the artefact and with each other. This provides {{the basis for a}} computational, agent-based framework for testing models of innovation...|$|R

The training stressed ruthlessness and toughness as part of the SS <b>value</b> <b>system,</b> which helped foster a sense of superiority among the men and taught them self-confidence. The first schools were established at Bad Tölz and Braunschweig, with additional schools opening at Klagenfurt and Prague during the war.|$|E
5|$|Palahniuk's {{novel was}} optioned by 20th Century Fox {{producer}} Laura Ziskin, who hired Jim Uhls {{to write the}} film adaptation. Fincher {{was one of four}} directors the producers considered, and was selected because of his enthusiasm for the film. Fincher developed the script with Uhls and sought screenwriting advice from the cast and others in the film industry. The director and the cast compared the film to Rebel Without a Cause (1955) and The Graduate (1967). They said its theme was the conflict between a generation of young people and the <b>value</b> <b>system</b> of advertising. The director copied the homoerotic overtones from Palahniuk's novel to make audiences uncomfortable and keep them from anticipating the twist ending.|$|E

Generally the prominent scientists of the period resided in many different regions of the country, and increasingly, the majority were of urban, rather than noble origin.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the role played by <b>value</b> <b>systems</b> as mechanisms for organizational change. Three issues are examined: purpose; implementation; and effects, intended and unintended, that may arise from using <b>values</b> <b>systems</b> as a management control mechanism to effect organizational change. Design/methodology/approach – The research is based on evidenced garnered from an in-depth, longitudinal study of a major UK based organization which operates in the “global communications industry”. Data are collected from a range of sources, but particularly interviews and a questionnaire survey involving a broad cross-section of the company's managers. Findings – Findings suggest that, in terms of purpose, top management may use <b>value</b> <b>systems</b> as a management control mechanism to effect organizational change by espousing a new set of normative values which should inform managers' decisions and actions, particularly in trade-off situations. Communication and implementation of <b>value</b> <b>systems</b> may involve a multitude of formal and informal information-based mechanisms and procedures, including mission statements, newsletters, email, “strategy days”, “roadshows” and similar social events. Implementation may rely on change agents creating a drive for change. However, the results of a questionnaire survey suggest that <b>value</b> <b>systems</b> may be only partly successful in securing their intended purpose of mobilising attitudes around a particular set of normative values. Various unintended effects may arise which, in the present case, include increasing project redundancy, decreasing project scrutiny, a re-distribution of social esteem within the firm, polarisation of attitudes towards budgetary control, and a general reduction in the exercise of hierarchical management control. Overall, it argued that the use of <b>value</b> <b>systems</b> as a mechanism of organizational change may be as problematic to the firm as it is beneficial. Practical implications – The results of the present study may help firms devise more appropriate <b>value</b> <b>systems</b> for “maintaining or altering patterns of organizational behaviour”. Originality/value – The present study contributes further insight is through evidence which suggests <b>value</b> <b>systems</b> may be used to communicate a set of quite specific values; and adds to a knowledge of the range of procedures which may be involved in using <b>value</b> <b>systems</b> to effect organizational change...|$|R
