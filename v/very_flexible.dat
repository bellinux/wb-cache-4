5|$|Kane's former youth coach Alex Inglethorpe {{has said}} of him:When {{he first came}} into the under-18s as a 15 year old, he stood out in the sense he looked a bit gangly. He moved {{slightly}} awkwardly, {{he was a bit}} cumbersome. But look closer, {{he had a lot of}} ability, a great technique. I think he surprised people how good he was. Tactically he was <b>very</b> <b>flexible.</b> He often played in midfield. I remember seeing him once playing as a holding midfielder.|$|E
5|$|Helical: These viruses are {{composed}} of a single type of capsomere stacked around a central axis to form a helical structure, which may have a central cavity, or tube. This arrangement results in rod-shaped or filamentous virions: These can be short and highly rigid, or long and <b>very</b> <b>flexible.</b> The genetic material, in general, single-stranded RNA, but ssDNA in some cases, is bound into the protein helix by interactions between the negatively charged nucleic acid and positive charges on the protein. Overall, {{the length of a}} helical capsid is related to the length of the nucleic acid contained within it and the diameter is dependent on the size and arrangement of capsomeres. The well-studied tobacco mosaic virus {{is an example of a}} helical virus.|$|E

5|$|Matthew Cobley et al. (2013) dispute this, {{finding that}} large muscles and {{cartilage}} would have limited {{movement of the}} neck. They state the feeding ranges for sauropods like Diplodocus were smaller than previously believed, and the animals may have had to move their whole bodies around to better access areas where they could browse vegetation. As such, they might have spent more time foraging to meet their minimum energy needs. The conclusions of Cobley etal. are disputed by Taylor, who analyzed the amount and positioning of intervertebral cartilage to determine {{the flexibility of the}} neck of Apatosaurus and Diplodocus. He found that the neck of Apatosaurus was <b>very</b> <b>flexible.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several of the animal's {{physical}} features are adaptions to climbing through trees. It uses its tail to assist balance and has semi-retractable claws that it uses to climb trees in its search for prey. It has semiplantigrade feet, switching between a plantigrade-like gait (when arboreal) and a digitigrade-like one (when terrestrial). The soles of its paws are nearly bare {{and covered with}} strong pads. The fossa has <b>very</b> <b>flexible</b> ankles that allow it to readily grasp tree trunks so as to climb up or down trees head first or to leap to another tree. Captive juveniles {{have been known to}} swing upside down by their hindfeet from knotted ropes.|$|E
5|$|The mallard is {{omnivorous}} and <b>very</b> <b>flexible</b> in its {{choice of}} food. Its diet may vary based on several factors, including {{the stage of}} the breeding cycle, short-term variations in available food, nutrient availability, and interspecific and intraspecific competition. The majority of the mallard's diet seems to be made up of gastropods, invertebrates (including beetles, flies, lepidopterans, dragonflies, and caddisflies), crustaceans, worms, many varieties of seeds and plant matter, and roots and tubers. During the breeding season, male birds were recorded to have eaten 37.6% animal matter and 62.4% plant matter, most notably Echinochloa crus-galli, and nonlaying females ate 37.0% animal matter and 63.0% plant matter, while laying females ate 71.9% animal matter and only 28.1% plant matter. Plants generally make up the larger part of a bird's diet, especially during autumn migration and in the winter.|$|E

5|$|The {{impact of}} sickle cell trait on malaria {{immunity}} illustrates some evolutionary trade-offs {{that have occurred}} because of endemic malaria. Sickle cell trait causes {{a change in the}} hemoglobin molecule in the blood. Normally, red blood cells have a <b>very</b> <b>flexible,</b> biconcave shape that allows them to move through narrow capillaries; however, when the modified hemoglobinS molecules are exposed to low amounts of oxygen, or crowd together due to dehydration, they can stick together forming strands that cause the cell to sickle or distort into a curved shape. In these strands the molecule is not as effective in taking or releasing oxygen, and the cell is not flexible enough to circulate freely. In the early stages of malaria, the parasite can cause infected red cells to sickle, and so they are removed from circulation sooner. This reduces the frequency with which malaria parasites complete their life cycle in the cell. Individuals who are homozygous (with two copies of the abnormal hemoglobin beta allele) have sickle-cell anaemia, while those who are heterozygous (with one abnormal allele and one normal allele) experience resistance to malaria without severe anemia. Although the shorter life expectancy for those with the homozygous condition would tend to disfavor the trait's survival, the trait is preserved in malaria-prone regions because of the benefits provided by the heterozygous form.|$|E

25|$|The hamster tail can be {{difficult}} to see, as it is usually not very long (about 1/6 the length of the body), {{with the exception of the}} Chinese hamster, which has a tail the same length as the body. One rodent characteristic that can be highly visible in hamsters is their sharp incisors; they have an upper pair and lower pair which grow continuously throughout life, so must be regularly worn down. Hamsters are <b>very</b> <b>flexible,</b> but their bones are somewhat fragile. They are extremely susceptible to rapid temperature changes and drafts, as well as extreme heat or cold.|$|E
25|$|The Fortissimo emerged {{two years}} prior to the filing of the {{influential}} and lucrative patent for racquets sized 95-135 square inches by Prince Sporting Goods (now Prince Sports and commonly called Prince). This resulted in the disqualification of the patent by the German patent authority. The Prince patent was upheld elsewhere and the company became the only highly successful seller of oversize racquets in their early history. The first was the <b>very</b> <b>flexible</b> aluminum Prince Classic of 1976. Tad Weed introduced the first super-oversize in 1975, to start a line that continues to be sold today.|$|E
25|$|Jawless {{fish were}} the {{earliest}} fish to evolve. There is current {{debate over whether}} these are really fish at all. They have no jaw, no scales, no paired fins, and no bony skeleton. Their skin is smooth and soft to the touch, and they are <b>very</b> <b>flexible.</b> Instead of a jaw, they possess an oral sucker. They use this to fasten onto other fish, and then use their rasp-like teeth to grind through their host's skin into the viscera. Jawless fish inhabit both fresh and salt water environments.

25|$|The {{atmosphere}} in the upper levels of medical services was then one of internal strife and personal conflicts. Hammond—a tall and imposing young man—was no man of intrigue, nor even, according to all accounts, a <b>very</b> <b>flexible</b> person. However, the situation offered him the possibility for advancement. When Finley, the 10th Surgeon General, was fired after an argument with Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, Abraham Lincoln, against Stanton's advice and the normal rules of promotion, named the 34-year-old Hammond to succeed him with the rank of brigadier general. Hammond became Surgeon General of the Army on 25 April 1862, {{less than a year}} after rejoining the army.|$|E
25|$|Opitz {{argues that}} the binding of {{different}} brain areas is mediated by the hippocampus. Relational bindings, or relationships between separate objects, concepts, and memories, are <b>very</b> <b>flexible</b> because the targets can be combined {{in so many different}} ways to deal with the present situation, and the hippocampus ensures that these parts are arranged into a coherent whole. Particularly, the hippocampus has been implicated in binding that is involved with episodic memory, working memory, and language acquisition. According to Opitz, this is viable because the hippocampus meets all criteria to be suitable for the regulation relational binding and, based on its patterns of activity, it is likely that it is involved.|$|E
25|$|Each field {{artillery}} regiment was originally organised as two batteries, each of two troops of six guns. This was changed late in 1940 to three batteries each of eight guns. Perhaps {{the most important}} element of a battery was the Forward Observation Officer (FOO), who directed fire. Unlike most armies of the period, in which artillery observers could only request fire support, a British Army FOO (who was supposedly a Captain but could even be a subaltern) could demand it, not merely from his own battery, but from the full regiment, or even the entire {{field artillery}} of a division if required. The artillery's organisation became <b>very</b> <b>flexible</b> and effective at rapidly providing and switching fire.|$|E
