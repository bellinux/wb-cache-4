40|$|Assessing the {{influence}} of climate, soil fertility, and species identity on leaf trait relationships is crucial for understanding the adaptations of plants to their environment and for interpreting leaf trait relationships across spatial scales. In a comparative field study of 171 plant species in 174 grassland sites across China, we examined the trade-offs, defined as negative covariance between two traits, between leaf persistence (leaf mass per area, LMA) and leaf productivity (mass-based photosynthetic rate, Amass, N and P content, and photosynthetic N use efficiency, PNUE). We asked to which extent these trade-offs were influenced by: (1) <b>variation</b> <b>among</b> sites within species, decomposed into variation due to climatic and soil variables; (2) <b>variation</b> <b>among</b> species within sites, decomposed into <b>variation</b> <b>among</b> taxonomic, functional, or phylogenetic groups; and (3) the joint contribution of <b>variation</b> <b>among</b> species and sites. We used mixed-model analysis of covariance to partition bivariate relationships between leaf traits into trade-off components. We found significant mass-based persistence–productivity trade-offs of LMA–Amass, LMA–N, LMA–P, and LMA– PNUE consistent with previous broadscale findings. Overall, (1) <b>variation</b> <b>among</b> sites within species explained 14 – 23...|$|R

In 1933, after the repeal of Prohibition, the states were again permitted to regulate alcoholic beverages. Immediately upon the end of Prohibition in 1933, New Jersey instituted the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, which established and granted rulemaking powers to the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control. The law also established a three-tier alcohol distribution system whereby, with minor exceptions, alcohol manufacturers may only sell to wholesalers, who may only sell to retailers, who may only sell to customers.|$|E

In this study, the prediction that variation in reproductive traits among populations of viviparous organisms should be related to <b>variation</b> <b>among</b> populations in body shape was tested in the Pacific molly Poecilia butleri, a viviparous fish that inhabits western Mexico and northern Central America. <b>Variation</b> <b>among</b> 10 populations in four reproductive traits was examined: brood size, individual embryo mass, total reproductive allotment and degree of maternal provisioning of nutrients to developing embryos. <b>Variation</b> <b>among</b> these populations in body shape was also examined. Significant <b>variation</b> <b>among</b> populations was observed in both brood size and reproductive allotment but not in embryo mass or degree of maternal provisioning. Significant <b>variation</b> <b>among</b> populations was also observed in body shape. After correcting for female size, however, reproductive traits and body shape were not associated among populations. This suggests that selective pressures acting on reproduction do not necessarily affect morphology and vice versa.

500|$|Many {{medications}} {{may have}} been incorrectly thought to cause serotonin syndrome. For example, some case reports have implicated atypical antipsychotics in serotonin syndrome, but it appears based on their pharmacology that {{they are unlikely to}} cause the syndrome. [...] It has also been suggested that mirtazapine has no significant serotonergic effects, and is therefore not a dual action drug. Bupropion has also been suggested to cause serotonin syndrome, although as {{there is no evidence that}} it has any significant serotonergic activity, it is thought unlikely to produce the syndrome. In 2006 the United States Food and Drug Administration issued an alert suggesting that the combined use of SSRIs or SNRIs and triptan medications or sibutramine could potentially lead to severe cases of serotonin syndrome. This has been disputed by other researchers as none of the cases reported by the FDA met the Hunter criteria for serotonin syndrome. The condition has however occurred in surprising clinical situations, and because of phenotypic <b>variations</b> <b>among</b> individuals, it has been associated with unexpected drugs, including mirtazapine.|$|E
500|$|Until the 1990s, {{there was}} some dispute over the taxonomic status of the species. [...] For much of the 20th century, the small-toothed {{sportive}} lemur was considered a subspecies of the weasel sportive lemur (Lepilemur mustelinus). [...] In his book The Primates of Madagascar from 1982, primatologist Ian Tattersall deviated from the traditional view by considering L.microdon a synonym of the weasel sportive lemur, while also recognizing only a single species of sportive lemur. [...] Tattersall based his decision on what he {{considered to be a}} lack of detailed anatomical studies and field surveys, while also factoring in the difficulty in observing the animals in the wild, the presence of only subtle <b>variations</b> <b>among</b> museum specimens, and his own unwillingness to consider differences in karyotypes as grounds for defining distinct species. [...] However, primatologist Russell Mittermeier, etal. in Lemurs of Madagascar (1994), taxonomist Colin Groves in Mammal Species of the World (2005), and others favored recognizing the small-toothed sportive lemur as a species while also recognizing a total of seven sportive lemur species.|$|E

This {{variation in}} migration directions is also of interest for modelling of migratory flight paths. In test series with caged migrants, the <b>variation</b> <b>among</b> individuals is generally much smaller than the variation within individuals making the <b>variation</b> <b>among</b> individuals difficult to detect with small sample sizes. No methods exist for estimating among-individual variance for directional data. We therefore used simulations to estimate the <b>variation</b> <b>among</b> individual mean migration directions.
