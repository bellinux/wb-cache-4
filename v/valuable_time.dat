5|$|Preparedness {{refers to}} {{precautions}} {{that should be}} taken before a thunderstorm. Some preparedness {{takes the form of}} general readiness (as a thunderstorm can occur at any time of the day or year). Preparing a family emergency plan, for example, can save <b>valuable</b> <b>time</b> if a storm arises quickly and unexpectedly. Preparing the home by removing dead or rotting limbs and trees, which can be blown over in high winds, can also significantly reduce the risk of property damage and personal injury.|$|E
5|$|The {{attack on}} Ancona was an immense success, and the Austro-Hungarian ships were largely unopposed {{during the entire}} operation. The {{objective}} of the bombardment was to delay the Italian Army from deploying its forces {{along the border with}} Austria-Hungary by destroying critical transportation systems. The surprise attack on Ancona succeeded in delaying the Italian deployment to the Alps for two weeks. This delay gave Austria-Hungary <b>valuable</b> <b>time</b> to strengthen its Italian border and re-deploy some of its troops from the Eastern and Balkan fronts.|$|E
5|$|The {{decisions}} {{had been}} made {{at the highest levels}} and planning had been completed, but <b>valuable</b> <b>time</b> had been lost. The South Vietnamese were about to begin their largest, most complex, and most important operation of the war. The lack of time for adequate planning and preparation, as well as the absence of any real questioning about military realities and the capabilities of the ARVN were going to prove decisive. On 29 January President Nixon gave his final approval for the operation. On the following day, Operation Dewey Canyon II was under way.|$|E

5|$|Having stopped Kansas on fourth down, Virginia Tech {{took over}} on offense at its 22-yard line. With just 5:51 {{remaining}} in the game, the Hokies badly needed to score quickly and get a defensive stop {{in order to have}} a chance to win. The Hokies advanced on the first aspect of that requirement as Sean Glennon converted several first downs through the air. Kansas allowed no play over nineyards until late in the drive, forcing Virginia Tech to use up <b>valuable</b> <b>time.</b> On the last play of the drive, Sean Glennon connected on a 20-yard strike to Justin Harper for a touchdown. The score cut Kansas' lead to just three points, but with just three minutes {{remaining in the}} game, Virginia Tech's comeback would only be complete if the Hokies could recover a difficult onside kick.|$|E
40|$|Shovels, haul {{trucks and}} {{conveyors}} {{are used in}} surface mines for material haulage of which trucks are have been most widely used. This paper presents a comprehensive comparison study {{in terms of the}} operating efficiency of trucks and conveyors as applied in surface mining operations. Three key time usage metrics are used to assess the efficiency of both haulage systems namely: Utilised Time, Operating <b>Time</b> and <b>Valuable</b> Operating <b>Time.</b> The notion that measurement of equipment performance should focus on a multi instead of a single- factor approach is proposed. Comparison of the two systems based on these measures indicates that although trucks lend themselves to high flexibility and lower upfront capital outlay, conveyor haulage offers a better measure of performance on all the three metrics of measuring equipment performance. This opportunity lies in the high <b>Valuable</b> Operating <b>Time</b> achievable with the conveyors compared to the trucks. The results of analysis on 308, 912 load records and 12 months equipment usage indicates that while the truck fleet achieve much higher Available Time and Utilisation Time, the conveyors achieve a higher <b>Valuable</b> Operating <b>Time</b> (25 % higher) compared to the truck fleet. The conveyors achieved an average of 3, 509 hours in <b>Valuable</b> Operating <b>Time</b> compared to the average <b>Valuable</b> Operating <b>Time</b> of 2, 638 hours for the truck fleet. The inference made from this observation is that, the higher effective utilisation of a continuous haulage system for example In-Pit Crusher Conveying (IPCC) could significantly improve the operating efficiency of the loading equipment...|$|R

5|$|Nansouty's {{division}} {{suffered a}} very high casualty rate at the Battle of Wagram, with more men and horses lost {{than the other two}} heavy cavalry divisions combined. Losses in horses were extremely high, with 1,141 animals killed or injured, while losses in men were also significant, despite the fact that only the carabiniers-à-cheval really came into contact with the enemy. Overall, Nansouty's division lost 164 men killed and 436 wounded. Foremost of all, the highly battered two carabiniers-à-cheval regiments had no more than 300 horses standing between themselves {{by the end of the}} day, for an equine casualty rate of 77 percent, with the 9th and 12th cuirassiers also suffering high casualties. Bessières's charge, hastily organised with only the division of Nansouty, through murderous artillery fire and against masses of infantry prepared to receive them, had less tactical effect than at Aspern-Essling, but it did win Napoleon <b>valuable</b> <b>time,</b> allowing him to retake the initiative in this battle.|$|E
5|$|North Korean {{prisoners of}} war {{captured}} by the US troops during the battle reported that the NK 3rd Division suffered about 2,000 casualties, mostly from artillery fire, in the attack on Yongdong on July 24–25. This brought {{it down to a}} strength of about 5,000 men, approximately half the strength it had when the war began. The 1st Cavalry Division's actions were able to delay the North Korean advance for several days, giving the UN forces <b>valuable</b> <b>time</b> to set up the Pusan Perimeter. The UN losses after this battle and the subsequent fight at Hwanggan cost the 1st Cavalry Division 916 casualties. The defeat was a poor showing for the division, but its record quickly improved with experience and it became a more reliable fighting unit {{by the time it was}} placed on Pusan Perimeter.|$|E
5|$|On May 31, as McClellan planned an assault, {{his army}} was {{surprised}} by a Confederate attack. Johnston saw that the Union army was split in half by the rain-swollen Chickahominy River and hoped to defeat it in detail at Seven Pines and Fair Oaks. McClellan was unable to command the army personally because of a recurrence of malarial fever, but his subordinates were able to repel the attacks. Nevertheless, McClellan received criticism from Washington for not counterattacking, which some believed could have opened the city of Richmond to capture. Johnston {{was wounded in the}} battle, and General Robert E. Lee assumed command of the Army of Northern Virginia. McClellan spent the next three weeks repositioning his troops and waiting for promised reinforcements, losing <b>valuable</b> <b>time</b> as Lee continued to strengthen Richmond's defenses.|$|E

5|$|The 27th Infantry Regiment lost 53 men killed, 221 wounded, and 49 missing, a {{total of}} 323 battle {{casualties}} during the battles along the Hwanggan road. However, {{it was able to}} delay the North Korean division for five days in this effort. The NK 2nd Division suffered heavily during this time to US artillery and armor, some estimates placing its losses above 3,000 men in the battles along the road. The US 1st Cavalry Division initially took the 27th Infantry's place on the line, but retreated without engaging the NK 2nd Division after movement by the NK 3rd Division threatened to take Kumch'on and block the US division's route of supply. The division was driven to the Naktong River by July 31, having taken 916 battle casualties at Hwanggan and Sangju in its first ten days on the line. Tactically, the North Koreans had been successful in pushing the US forces south and capturing the ground, but the American units had bought strategically <b>valuable</b> <b>time</b> to set up the Pusan Perimeter.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure to}} {{coordinate}} the FAA, RAF and Navy dispersed any counterstrike. Confusion owing to {{the weather and the}} lack of any centralised control of British sea and air forces caused each element to work independently of one another. This caused several friendly fire incidents, such as the attack by No. 217 Squadron on HMS Mackay. The most serious failure was Fighter Command’s failure to provide adequate protection to bomber and naval forces. Although the weather also prevented greater German fighter activity by the time the target area was reached, <b>valuable</b> <b>time</b> had been lost by bomber formations searching for their fighter escorts over the rendezvous positions which either never arrived or were given incorrect orders or direction too late to be acted upon. Little communication was enabled between fighter and bomber units, but also between the strike units themselves. Compounding the problems, RAF Bomber Command’s crews, which made up the majority of the strike forces, were not trained for attacks against naval targets. The only anti-shipping torpedo-bomber squadrons were No. 42 and 217 Squadrons of Coastal Command, which owing to logistical issues, were five torpedoes short of their total complement.|$|E
5|$|With the ROK army in retreat, the 766th Regiment, 549th Unit, and KPA's 5th Divisions all {{advanced}} steadily {{south along}} the eastern roads without encountering much resistance. Across the entire front the North Korean Army had successfully routed the South Koreans and was pushing them south. The 766th Regiment acted as an advance force, attempting to infiltrate further inland as it moved through the mountainous eastern region of the country. The rugged terrain of the eastern regions of Korea, poor communication equipment, and unreliable resupply lines thwarted the South Korean resistance. The North Koreans used this to their advantage in advancing but they began to experience the same problems themselves. The 5th Division and the two other units began advancing south slowly and cautiously, sending strong reconnaissance parties into the mountains to ensure {{they would not be}} threatened from the rear. However, this more cautious advance began to give the South Koreans <b>valuable</b> <b>time</b> to build up further south. By June 28, the 766th had infiltrated into Taebaek-san from Uljin and was moving toward Ilwolsan, Yongyang and Cheongsong in order to block communications between Daegu and Busan, where United States Army forces were landing in an attempt to support the collapsing ROK Army.|$|E
