5|$|An {{important}} parameter {{determining the}} future {{evolution of the}} Universe theory is the density parameter, Omega (Ω), defined as the average matter density of the universe divided by a critical <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> density. This selects one of three possible geometries depending on whether Ω is equal to, less than, or greater than 1. These are called, respectively, the flat, open and closed universes.|$|E
5|$|The {{same idea}} of using a DAG to {{represent}} a family of paths occurs in the binary decision diagram, a DAG-based data structure for representing binary functions. In a binary decision diagram, each non-sink vertex is labeled {{by the name of}} a binary variable, and each sink and each edge is labeled by a 0 or 1. The function value for any truth assignment to the variables is the value at the sink found by following a path, starting from the single source vertex, that at each non-sink vertex follows the outgoing edge labeled with the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> vertex's variable. Just as directed acyclic word graphs {{can be viewed as a}} compressed form of tries, binary decision diagrams can be viewed as compressed forms of decision trees that save space by allowing paths to rejoin when they agree on the results of all remaining decisions.|$|E

25|$|Action {{is a part}} of an {{alternative}} approach to finding such equations of motion. Classical mechanics postulates that the path actually followed by a physical system is that for which the action is minimized, or more generally, is stationary. In other words, the action satisfies a variational principle: the principle of stationary action (see also below). The action is defined by an integral, and the classical equations of motion of a system can be derived by minimizing the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> integral.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} {{table lists}} a few selected values for t-distributions with ν {{degrees of freedom}} {{for a range of}} one-sided or two-sided critical regions. For an example of how to read this table, take the fourth row, which begins with 4; that means ν, the number of degrees of freedom, is 4 (and if we are dealing, as above, with n values with a fixed sum, n = 5). Take the fifth entry, in the column headed 95% for one-sided (90% for two-sided). The <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> entry is 2.132. Then the probability that T is less than 2.132 is 95% or Pr(−∞ < T < 2.132) = 0.95; this also means that Pr(−2.132 < T < 2.132) = 0.9.|$|E
25|$|The temple games {{featured}} {{the two remaining}} teams competing in three physical challenges to earn Pendants of Life which the winning team used in the final round. Several different types of temple games were featured, with the episode's legend serving as a theme for each. Most temple games lasted for a maximum of 60 seconds but some were untimed. After each challenge, the winning team received some portion of a protective Pendant of Life. The first two challenges, pitting single members from each team against one another, were worth one half of a pendant, while the final challenge, involving both contestants on both teams, was worth a full pendant. If a temple game ended in a tie, both teams received the pendant <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> game.|$|E
50|$|The {{sample mean}} is a vector each of whose {{elements}} is the sample mean {{of one of}} the random variablesthat is, each of whose elements is the arithmetic average <b>of</b> the observed <b>values</b> <b>of</b> one of the variables. The sample covariance matrix is a square matrix whose i, j element is the sample covariance (an estimate of the population covariance) between the sets <b>of</b> observed <b>values</b> <b>of</b> two of the variables and whose i, i element is the sample variance <b>of</b> the observed <b>values</b> <b>of</b> one of the variables. If only one variable has had values observed, then the sample mean is a single number (the arithmetic average <b>of</b> the observed <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> variable) and the sample covariance matrix is also simply a single value (a 1x1 matrix containing a single number, the sample variance <b>of</b> the observed <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> variable).|$|R

Although there are references to the borough that predate the Domesday Survey it is not mentioned by name in the survey. However, its existence within the manor of Ulvritone {{is evident from the}} massive rise in <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> manor {{at a time when most}} manors were worth less than in Saxon times. In 1086 the Domesday Book assesses the borough as having land for 12 ploughs, 2 mills, woodland for 25 pigs, 11 villeins (resident farmhands, unfree peasant who owed his lord labour services), 11 bordars (unfree peasants with less land than villans/villeins), and 51enclosures (private parks) rendering 70s 7d.|$|E

25|$|The Mark-to-Market Margin (MTM margin) on {{the other}} hand is the margin {{collected}} to offset losses (if any) that have already been incurred on the positions held by a firm. This is computed as the difference between the cost of the position held and the current market <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> position. If the resulting amount is a loss, the amount is collected from the firm; else, the amount may be returned to the firm (the case with most clearing houses) or kept in reserve depending on local practice. In either case, the positions are 'marked-to-market' by setting their new cost to the market value used in computing this difference. The positions held by the clients of the exchange are marked-to-market daily and the MTM difference computation for the next day would use the new cost figure in its calculation.|$|E

500|$|There {{were several}} {{possible}} actions {{available to the}} claimant. In the typical theft, the damages were a multiple {{of the value of}} the thing stolen, available through the actio furti. A subsequent rise in the value of the thing stolen whilst the claim was being brought was borne by the defendant, if found liable. If part of a thing was stolen, probably the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> part. A successful action for theft brought with it infamia for the thief. [...] If the claimant had an interest short of ownership, then the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> interest formed the basis for the damages instead. An heir of the claimant could sue, but the heir of a thief was not liable. Some types of theft were criminal wrongs by the end of the republic. Ulpian reports that criminal proceedings were more common, and Julian that a successful prosecution prevented a civil action under furtum. Even furtum itself was not compensatory but penal in nature.|$|E
