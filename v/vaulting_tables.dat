This study was purposed to compare {{kinematic}} differences between Yang Hak-Seon vault (Yang- 1) and Tsukahara 1260 vault (Yang- 2) performed by Yang Hak-Seon. Fourteen high-speed cameras were used to capture a whole body segment motion of Yang- 2 vault during the practice session.

However, the trunk rotation angle and its angular velocity of Yang- 2 vault exceeded Yang- 1 vault significantly. This {{might be due to}} a half turn off the springboard onto the <b>vault</b> <b>table</b> of Yang- 2 vault, which resulted in larger initial angular momentum at the <b>vault</b> <b>table</b> touchdown and further increase in angular velocity during the <b>vault</b> <b>table</b> contact...|$|R

40|$|VÝCHODISKA : Sportovní výkon v přeskoku trvá krátký čas a je ovlivněn množstvím biomechanických proměnných. Po Olympijských hrách v roce 2000 bylo tradiční přeskokové nářadí nahrazeno moderním přeskokovým stolem. V současné době nejsou známy komplexní biomechanická data o přeskocích při použití nového přeskokového stolu a je otázkou, jaké je současné provedení přemetových přeskoků u vrcholových sportovních gymnastek. CÍLE : Cílem studie je určit, které biomechanické faktory se podílejí na úspěšném provedení přemetových skoků. METODIKA : Výzkumu se účastnilo osm vrcholových sportovních gymnastek. Pro 3 D prostorovou analýzu byly použity dva digitální kamkordéry se snímkovací normou 50 půlsnímků/s. Data byla digitalizována pomocí softwaru Simi motion. Metoda podle Hay a Reid (1988) byla použita pro identifikaci biomechanických proměnných, které ovlivňují průběh přemetových skoků. Pro posouzení závislosti mezi biomechanickými proměnnými a bodovým hodnocením byla použita korelační analýza. Hladina statistické významnosti byla nastavena na hladinu p < 0, 05. VÝSLEDKY : Z 23 vyšetřovaných proměnných byly u pěti zjištěny signifikantní korelace s bodovým hodnocením. Signifikantní korelace byla zjištěna u vertikální výšky těžiště těla při odrazu z přeskokového stolu (r = 0, 86), maximální výšky těžiště těla ve druhé letové fázi (r = 0, 83), změně horizontální rychlosti ve fázi odrazu z přeskokového stolu (r = - 0, 69), u horizontální složky rychlosti při odrazu z přeskokového nářadí (r = 0, 75) a doby trvání druhé letové fáze (r = 0, 69). ZÁVĚRY : Fáze odrazu z přeskokového stolu je klíčovou fází skoku. Vrcholové sportovní gymnastky dokáží provést odraz z přeskokového stolu v relativně krátkém časovém úseku a v plném rozsahu pohybu (maximalizace výšky těžiště těla při odrazu z můstku). Odraz z přeskokového stolu je proveden s vysokou vertikální a horizontální rychlostí čímž je zajištěna dostatečná výška skoku a vzdálenost doskoku od přeskokového nářadí. Sportovní gymnastky tak mají dostatek času pro dokončení rotačního pohybu a kontrolovaný a bezpečný doskok. ] BACKGROUND : A {{vaulting}} performance takes a {{short time}} and it is influenced by and affects the quantity of mechanical variables. After the 2000 Olympic Games, the traditional horse {{was replaced by a}} new <b>vaulting</b> <b>table.</b> While the biomechanical data of vaulting using the new table (post 2000 Olympic competition) are not available yet, there is a question what the current technique of handspring performed by top-level female gymnasts looks like. OBJECTIVE : The aim of the study is to determine the biomechanical factors that govern success in the performance of the handspring and front somersault vaults. METHODS : Eight top-level female gymnasts participated in this study. For the 3 D spatial movement analysis, two digital camcorders with a frame rate of 50 fields per second were used. The data was digitized by the Simi motion software. The method of Hay and Reid (1988) was used to identify the biomechanical variables that determine the linear and angular motions of the handspring and front somersault vaults. A correlation analysis was used to establish the strength {{of the relationship between the}} causal biomechanical variables and the judges' scores. The level of statistical significance was determined at the value of p RESULTS : Five out of 23 examined variables showed significant correlations with the scores. A significant correlation was found in the vertical height of the body center of mass during the take-off from the <b>vaulting</b> <b>table</b> (r = 0. 86), in the maximum height of the body center of mass in the second flight phase (r = 0. 83), in the change of the horizontal velocity during the phase of the take-off from the <b>vaulting</b> <b>table</b> (r = - 0. 69), in the horizontal component of the velocity during the spring from the <b>vaulting</b> <b>table</b> (r = 0. 75) and in the duration of the second flight phase (r = 0. 69). CONCLUSIONS : The phase of the take-off from the <b>vaulting</b> <b>table</b> is a crucial phase of the vault. Top-level artistic female gymnasts are able to execute the take-off from the <b>vaulting</b> <b>table</b> in a relatively short period of time with a full extent of the movement (maximization of the height of the body center of mass at the board take-off). The take-off from the <b>vaulting</b> <b>table</b> is executed at a high vertical and horizontal velocity that ensures a sufficient height of the vault and landing distance of from the <b>vaulting</b> <b>table.</b> The longer time of the second flight allowed gymnasts to complete the rotation motion during the second flight phase and perform a controlled and safe landing...|$|R

40|$|Empirical {{evidence}} {{highlights the}} role of visual information to control gymnastics vaulting and thus neglects a stereotyped approach run. However, {{there is no evidence}} on which informational source this regulation is based on. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the position of the springboard as an informational source in the regulation of the handspring on vault. The hypothesis tested was that the action of running towards the springboard brings about changes in the approach run kinematics and handspring kinematics that relate directly to the position of the springboard. Therefore, kinematics of N = 14 female expert gymnasts’ handsprings on vault and their approach runs were examined while manipulating the position of the springboard. The results revealed that expert gymnasts placed their feet on average in the same position on the springboard and adapted to the springboard position during the last three steps of the approach run. A smaller springboard distance to the front edge of the <b>vaulting</b> <b>table</b> resulted in a different hand placement on the <b>vaulting</b> <b>table,</b> a shorter first flight phase, a take-off angle closer to 90 ° and a longer second flight phase.

Four male international level gymnasts were filmed in 3 D performing five trials on separate occasions. ISC of the hip and shoulder joint in three phases (board contact; flight; vault contact) was assessed using continuous relative phase (CRP). CRP variability (CRPsd) and root mean square difference (RMSD) between the old and new vault CRP profiles were also calculated. Small differences existed at key moments (e. g. both board touch downs= 155), but the RMSD in the CRP profiles were large (e. g. board contact phase = 27). Larger variability on the table than the horse (e. g. CRPsd during vault contact 26 % greater) suggests a less stable co-ordination pattern requiring further investigations into devising learning drills for the table.

Although it can be {{performed}} in a variety of rotations and body positions in different phases, it can be separated in three groups: handspring, Yurchenko and Tsukahara. It is believed that kinematic variables of vault may vary according to group of vault or gymnast body position, but few studies compares the real differences among the three groups of vaults, comparing and describing the variables in different phases. Vault kinematic variables could be diversifying according to the approach or position of the vaulting, but little has been studied about the biomechanical differences, comparing and describing behaviours at different stages. The aim {{of this study was to}} organize critical, objective and to systematize the most relevant kinematic variables to performance on vaulting. A Meta analysis over the basis Pubmed, Sport Discus and Web of Science were performed about this issue. From the selected references, we described and analyzed the kinematics of the <b>table</b> <b>vault.</b> Vault can be characterized in seven phases of analysis.

An angle-driven computer model of vaulting that simulated the interaction between a seven-segment gymnast and a single-segment <b>vaulting</b> <b>table</b> during the table contact phase of the vault was developed. Both dynamic and static friction were incorporated within the model by switching between two implementations of the tangential frictional force. Two vaulting trials were used to determine the model parameters by using a genetic algorithm to match simulations to recorded performances. A third independent trial was used to evaluate the model and close agreement was found between the simulation and the recorded performance with an overall difference of 13. 5 %. The two-state simulation model was found to be capable of replicating performance at take-off and also of replicating key contact phase features such as the normal and tangential motion of the hands. The results of the two-state model were compared to those using a pseudo-Coulomb friction implementation within the simulation model. The two-state model achieved similar overall results to those of the pseudo-Coulomb model but obtained solutions more rapidly...|$|R
