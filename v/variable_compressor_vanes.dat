Further, performance characteristics of the F 100 (3) compression system have been incorporated into the model on a blade row basis.

40|$|High {{response}} {{measurements of}} a Pratt and Whitney F 100 (3) turbofan engine at a simulated Mach number and altitude of 1. 2 and 3000 m (10, 000 ft) respectively were recorded during a nonrecoverable stall. The nonrecoverable stall occurred {{as a result}} of incorrect scheduling of the high <b>compressor</b> <b>variable</b> <b>vanes</b> (RCVV) during an experimental engine control investigation. Recorded data indicates rotating stall originating in the high pressure compressor. From this region the disturbance propagates upstream into the fan and downstream throughout the core compressor. The rotating stall remained in the core compressor until the engine was shutdown. The fan exhibited some rotating stall, but the amplitude of the pressure oscillations were less severe. Data indicates that the fan was able to recover from the stall. Fan turbine inlet temperature (FTIT) had been decreasing until stall developed in the high-pressure compressor. From this time, FTIT increased towards its maximum temperature limit. The rising FTIT during nonrecoverable stall {{may be the result of}} incomplete combustion in the combustor and additional combustion occurring through the turbine...|$|R
40|$|Variable {{geometry}} blade rows are {{a common}} instrument to avoid compressor instabilities which occur especially at low- and full-speed operation of gas turbines. The operating settings of variable stator vanes (VSVs) are typically obtained from expensive and time consuming performance rig tests and are not known during the early design phase of a gas turbine. During preliminary design of the overall engine it is common practice to use default component characteristics based on considerable engineering experience. These can deviate substantially at off-design and often do not properly account {{for the impact of}} changes in component geometry. As a solution, multi-fidelity simulation often referred to as zooming or variable complexity analysis is applied. This proceeding facilitates a transfer of single component performance characteristics obtained in mid- or high-fidelity analysis to a full gas turbine system analysis based on lower resolution level. The {{purpose of this study is}} to present a multidisciplinary numerical optimization methodology to define ideal blade row staggering of <b>variable</b> <b>compressor</b> stator <b>vanes</b> during the early preliminary design phase using multi-fidelity simulation. The objective of the resultant multi-dimensional constraint optimization is to find the best solution for the entire gas turbine system for a set of discrete operating points. For the assessment a generic turbofan engine model is designed by taking into account top level engine requirements from an assumed airframe and flight mission scenario. Based on the performance calculation a full 3 -D axial multistage high pressure compressor (HPC) is designed. The assumed design considerations are summarized and the modelling techniques are presented. The optimization of VSV staggering mentioned above is carried out by re-staggering the variable geometry blade rows of the high-fidelity HPC and run a full 2 -dimensional through-flow calculation. Results are then automatically transferred to the 0 -dimensional engine model to calculate the engine overall performance. A Pareto optimized blade row staggering is found by taking into account the surge margin and the specific fuel consumption of the entire engine system as objective functions of the optimization process. Simultaneously several constraints such as DeHaller numbers and diffusion factors are considered. The optimization process chain and the tool coupling are summarized and described in detail. The resulting VSV staggering for a set of discrete operating points is shown...|$|R

40|$|As a novel aero-engine concept, {{adaptive}} cycle aero-engines (ACEs) are attracting wide {{attention in}} the international aviation industry due to their potential superior task adaptability along a wide flight regime. However, this superior task adaptability can only be demonstrated through proper combined engine control schedule design. It has resulted in an urgent need to investigate the effect of each variable geometry modulation on engine performance and stability. Thus, {{the aim of this}} paper is to predict and discuss the effect of each variable geometry modulation on the matching relationship between engine components as well as the overall engine performance at different operating modes, on the basis of a newly developed nonlinear component-based ACE performance model. Results show that at all four working modes, turning down the high pressure <b>compressor</b> <b>variable</b> stator <b>vane,</b> the low pressure turbine variable nozzle, the nozzle throat area, and turning up the core-driven fan stage variable stator vane, the high pressure turbine variable nozzle can increase the thrust at the expense of a higher high pressure turbine inlet total temperature.

The above results provide valuable guidance and advice for engine combined control schedule design...|$|R

However {{as part of}} in-service maintenance, some components have shown, upon inspection, wear and localised cracking thus requiring repair or replacement. An understanding {{of the source of}} stress or loading is required in order to assess the effect of the crack, to see if further propagation will result. Such cracks have been found on a <b>compressor</b> <b>vane</b> ring associated with a turboprop engine. It is necessary to establish the origin of the stresses that have been leading to cracks and subsequent failures observed throughout the component. Due to the complexity of the shape of the component, a finite element approach was adopted and the component modelled and analysed for a series of representative load cases. The results and outcomes are presented herein. In addition, some guidance is given on the construction, development and verification of a three dimensional finite element model for use in <b>compressor</b> <b>vane</b> design. The stresses in the <b>compressor</b> <b>vane</b> ring arise from pressure and thermal actions, with the thermal action generating the highest stresses. However, {{in order to determine the}} magnitude of the thermal loading, some in-service experiments were undertaken using a full size test engine. Thermal characteristics were established using a thermal paint and suitable calibration specimens. Thereafter, these loads were applied to the finite element model of a single blade and thereafter the entire ring. The largest thermal transients occur during start-up and shutdown, along with the full power condition, which may happen during flight. Each of these cases was analysed as part of a full thermal parameter study. In each case, the location, magnitude and direction of the maximum stresses was recorded and comparisons made with the damage observed in the real structure. As a result, some recommendations have been made on the design and approach to repair of the vane ring for improved service life performance...|$|R

However, it used to require larger compressor size due to the lower fluid density compared with conventional refrigerants such as R 410 A. Thus, a new wing-vane compressor which has no contraction between the vane and the cylinder is developed to prevent increase in the size without performance degradation. The wing-vane compressor has higher compression efficiency compared to the conventional <b>vane</b> <b>compressor</b> as it has no friction loss of {{the tip of the}} vane and it can significantly reduce the mechanical loss for the conventional <b>vane</b> <b>compressor.</b> Since the structure of the wing-vane compressor is different from the conventional <b>vane</b> <b>compressor,</b> the load characteristic on the rotor and vanes are completely different from the conventional <b>vane</b> <b>compressor.</b> Therefore, the compression characteristics and the load characteristics are investigated by creating a dynamic model of the wing-vane compressor and a prototype of the wing <b>vane</b> <b>compressor</b> was operated using R 134 a refrigerant [...] The results are as follows: (1) Characteristics of torque and load are equivalent to those of a conventional <b>vane</b> <b>compressor.</b> (2) Lubrication of the newly added partial arc guide bearings is important to ensure the reliability...|$|R

Although highly limited in this topic, literature shows that the major constraint for the employment of such approaches is the deformation and motion of the rotor mesh, i. e. the computational grid related to the fluid volume between stator, rotor and blades of the positive displacement vane device. To address these issues, a novel grid generation approach is herein proposed and accomplished through a series of steps: geometrical 2 D modeling of the machine cross section profile, boundary generation of the rotor mesh and, eventually, distribution of computational nodes using algebraic algorithms with transfinite interpolation, post orthogonalization and smoothing. This methodology was subsequently tested on an industrial <b>vane</b> <b>compressor</b> comparing the results of oil free and oil injected simulations set up in the ANSYS CFX solver.

40|$|In Sliding <b>Vane</b> Rotary <b>Compressors,</b> {{as well as}} in most of {{positive}} displacement machines, the oil is injected to fulfill sealing and lubrication purposes. However, the oil injection could produce an additional effect during the compression phase with a great saving potential from the energetic point of view. Being the air inside the cell at a higher temperature than the oil injected, a cooling effect could be achieved so decreasing the mechanical power required for the compression. At the moment, the oil is introduced inside the <b>compressor</b> <b>vanes</b> through a series of simple holes that are only able to produce solid jets. In this way any effective heat transfer is prevented, as demonstrated by p-V measurements inside the cells during the compression phase. In the current study, a theoretical model of a sprayed oil injection technology was developed and further experimentally validated. The oil was injected along the axial length of the compressor through a number of pressure swirl atomizers which produced a very fine spray. The conservation equations, solved with a Lagrangian approach, allowed to track the droplets evolution from the injection until the impingement onto the metallic surfaces of the vanes.
