40|$|In an {{extensive}} environmental study, field samples, including soil, water, rice, <b>vegetable,</b> fish, human <b>hair</b> and urine, were collected at an abandoned tungsten mine in Shantou City, southern China. Results showed that arsenic (As) concentration in agricultural soils ranged from 3. 5 to 935  mg kg- 1 with the mean value of 129  mg kg- 1. In addition, As concentration {{reached up to}} 325  μg L- 1 in the groundwater, and the maximum As concentration in local food were 1. 09, 2. 38 and 0. 60  mg kg- 1 for brown rice, vegetable and fish samples, respectively, suggesting the local water resource and food have been severely contaminated with As. Health impact monitoring data revealed that As concentrations in hair and urine samples were up to 2. 92  mg kg- 1 and 164  μg L- 1, respectively, indicating a potential health risk among the local residents. Effective measurements should be implemented to protect the local community from the As contamination in the environment. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|AbstractContaminated food through {{dietary intake}} {{has become the}} main {{potential}} risk impacts on human health. This study investigated concentrations of rare earth elements (REEs) in soil, <b>vegetables,</b> human <b>hair</b> and blood, and assessed human health risk through vegetables consumption {{in the vicinity of}} a large-scale mining area located in Hetian Town of Changting County, Fujian Province, Southeast China. The results of the study included the following mean concentrations for total and bio-available REEs of 242. 92 ± 68. 98 (135. 85 – 327. 56) μgg− 1 and 118. 59 ± 38. 49 (57. 89 – 158. 96) μgg− 1 dry weight (dw) in agricultural soil, respectively, and total REEs of 3. 58 ± 5. 28 (0. 07 – 64. 42) μgg− 1 dw in vegetable samples. Concentrations of total REEs in blood and hair collected from the local residents ranged from 424. 76 to 1274. 80 μgL− 1 with an average of 689. 74 ± 254. 25 μgL− 1 and from 0. 06 to 1. 59 μgg− 1 with an average of 0. 48 ± 0. 59 μgg− 1 of the study, respectively. In addition, a significant correlation was observed between REEs in blood and corresponding soil samples (R 2 = 0. 6556, p 0. 05). Mean concentrations of REEs of 2. 85 (0. 59 – 10. 24) μgL− 1 in well water from the local households was 53 -fold than that in the drinking water of Fuzhou city (0. 054 μgL− 1). The health risk assessment indicated that vegetable consumption would not result in exceeding the safe values of estimate daily intake (EDI) REEs (100 − 110 μgkg− 1 d− 1) for adults and children, but attention should be paid to monitoring human beings health in such rare earth mining areas due to long-term exposure to high dose REEs from food consumptions...|$|R
40|$|Associating {{the global}} trend of {{incorporating}} active compounds and plants in cosmetic formulations {{and the vast}} Brazilian biodiversity, the present work aimed to study the incorporation of Brazilian <b>vegetable</b> oils in <b>hair</b> conditioner formulations, evaluating the mechanical resistance of hair fibers. The following oils were incorporated into base formulations at 5. 0 % (w/w) : babassu, buriti, andiroba and pequi. The formulations were applied to samples of Caucasian hair, followed by several washing steps, then the evaluation of mechanical strength. It was {{found that there was}} no statistically significant difference in mechanical resistance between samples treated with oils and the control between the first and seventh wash cycles. This fact {{can be explained by the}} possible low penetration of oils into the cortex, a region responsible for the mechanical properties of the hair fiber, since the grease composition disfavors its diffusion. The common effects of vegetable oils on the cuticle, such as filling in cracks or cavities, lubrication, and increased protein hydrophobicity cannot be excluded. The oils tested in this work were not able to raise or protect hair tresses. However, additional studies are required in order to establish the effects of oil treatments, particularly in damaged hair...|$|R
40|$|History {{of present}} illness: A 12 -year-old female with no past medical history {{presented}} with abdominal pain for 3 months. The pain was intermittent, {{located at the}} epigastric region, non-radiating, fluctuating intensity up to 8 / 10, and had worsened over the past month. She did not have fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or blood in her stool. The patient also endorsed hair loss over {{the same time period}} and noted that her previously long hair was now short and thin. On exam, patient was noted to have shoulder-length hair, a soft, non-distended abdomen with mild tenderness to the epigastric region, and a 5 cm hard mass palpated at the epigastrium. Significant findings: In the abdominal radiograph, a nonspecific and non-obstructive bowel gas pattern with no air-fluid level was noted, however the stomach was distended with soft tissue. The CT abdomen/pelvis revealed a distended stomach with undigested heterogeneous contents (presumed bezoar). Discussion: A bezoar is a mass of incompletely digested material typically originating in the stomach and consisting of <b>vegetable</b> fibers, <b>hair,</b> or drugs. 1 Bezoars develop after ingested foreign material accumulates in the gastrointestinal tract due to indigestibility, gastric outlet obstruction, or intestinal stasis. Trichobezoars are comprised of hair and classically form in young females with an underlying psychiatric disorder resulting in the urge to pull one’s hair out (trichotillomania) and swallow it (trichophagia). 2, 3 Gastric bezoars are rare with an approximate incidence of 0. 3 percent of patients undergoing upper endoscopy. 4 Patients tend to remain asymptomatic for long periods, but may develop abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, early satiety, anorexia, and weight loss. 5 Complications may include gastrointestinal ulcerations, perforations, intussusception, pancreatitis, obstructive jaundice, and death. 6 - 8 The diagnosis of a gastric bezoar can be made using plain films, ultrasound, or CT, and is confirmed via upper endoscopy. 2, 9 Management of gastric bezoars should be dictated by its composition and may include chemical dissolution, endoscopic removal, or surgical removal. 6, 9 Our patient underwent urgent surgical removal of the gastric trichobezoar...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} in 1992 in Mundu area, lndramayu regency, to observe the impact of mercury contamination on community health and the environment. This was a case control study and some samples were taken from the community such as human <b>hair,</b> <b>vegetables,</b> rice, and feathers of poultries (chickens, ducks) in Kedokan Bunder Wetan and Rambatan Wetan villages.   The results showed that the concentrations of total-Hg in human hair in the study area was still below the standard, though {{there was a significant difference}} between the exposed area (Kedokan Bunder Wetan village) and the control area (Rambatan Wetan village). We found that the concentration of total-Hg in environmental samples either in the exposed area or the control area was higher than the standard but there was no significant difference between the study areas. The health examination for those with mercury intoxication syndromes among the hair donors in the study areas (exposed and non-exposed) did not show any of the symptoms, probably because the level of mercury in the hair samples were also low. Since the level of mercury in the environmental samples were high, it is recommended to monitor mercury concentration in the environment as a routine activity. </p...|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{exposure}} to arsenic (As) {{in drinking water}} is an established cause of cancer and other adverse health effects. Arsenic concentrations > 10 μg L− 1 were previously measured in 5 % of private water supplies (PWS) in Cornwall, UK. The present study investigated prolongued {{exposure to}} As by measuring biomarkers in hair and toenail samples from 212 volunteers and repeated measurements of As in drinking water from 127 households served by PWS. Strong positive Pearson correlations (rp = 0. 95) indicated stability of water As concentrations over the time period investigated (up to 31 months). Drinking water As concentrations were positively correlated with toenail (rp = 0. 53) and hair (rp = 0. 38) As concentrations – indicative of prolonged exposure. Analysis of washing procedure solutions provided strong evidence of the effective removal of exogenous As from toenail samples. Significantly higher As concentrations were measured in hair samples from males and smokers and As concentrations in toenails were negatively associated with age. A positive association between seafood consumption and toenail As and a negative association between home-grown <b>vegetable</b> consumption and <b>hair</b> As was observed for volunteers exposed to < 1 As μg L− 1 in drinking water. These findings have important implications regarding the interpretation of toenail and hair biomarkers. Substantial variation in biomarker As concentrations remained unaccounted for, with soil and dust exposure as possible explanations...|$|R
40|$|Gladwell's latest book, What the Dog Saw, bundles {{together}} his favourite {{articles from}} the New Yorker since he joined {{as a staff}} writer in 1996. It makes for a handy crash course in {{the world according to}} Gladwell: this is the bedrock on which his rise to popularity is built. A warning, though: it's hard to read the book without the sneaking suspicion that you're unwittingly taking part in a social experiment he has masterminded to provide grist for his next book. Gladwell has divided his book into three sections. The first deals with what he calls obsessives and minor geniuses; the second with flawed ways of thinking. The third focuses on how we make predictions about people: will they make a good employee, are they capable of great works of art, or are they the local serial killer? Brought together, the pieces form a dazzling record of Gladwell's art. There is depth to his research and clarity in his arguments, but it is the breadth of subjects he applies himself to that is truly impressive. He bounds along from the inventors of automatic <b>vegetable</b> choppers and <b>hair</b> dye to Cesar Millan, the American "Dog Whisperer" behind the title piece, and Nassim Taleb, the US banker who turned his nose up at the investment strategies of George Soros and Warren Buffet and made himself a pile of money.

40|$|Humility, the {{keystone}} {{of the virtues}} in the Christian spiritual tradition, has been dismissed by modern philosophers, critiqued by feminist theologians, and overpowered by our industrial and technological culture. The incorporation of agricultural experience in Christian higher education presents the opportunity to cultivate anew the virtue of humility, properly understood not as a practice of self-abnegation but as a relation of the creature to the God who has gifted us with nourishing soil and deified us in Christ. Key words: virtue, humility, pride, agrarianism “You can toss them in with a salad, ” Mary Lu said, reaching down and breaking off several tall, thin, emerald-green leaves of a garlic plant, “or sauté them with <b>vegetables.</b> ” Her <b>hair</b> was pulled into a neat bun and tucked underneath her cap.

40|$|In {{order to}} assess soil As {{contamination}} and potential risk for human, soil, paddy rice, <b>vegetable</b> and human <b>hair</b> samples from the areas near the industrial districts in Chenzhou, southern China were sampled and analyzed. The {{results showed that the}} anthropogenic industrial activities have caused in local agricultural soils to be contaminated with As in a range of 11. 0 - 1217 mg/kg. The GIS-based map shows that soil contamination with As occurred on a large scale, which probably accounted for up to 30 % of the total area investigated. Soil As concentration abruptly decreased with an increase in the distance from the polluting source. High As concentrations were found in the rice grain that ranged from 0. 5 to 7. 5 mg/kg, most of which exceed the maximal permissible limit of 1. 0 mg/kg dry matter. Arsenic accumulated in significantly different levels between leafy vegetables and non-leafy vegetables. Non-leafy vegetables should be recommended in As-contaminated soils, as their edible parts were found in relatively low As level. Arsenic concentrations in 95 % of the total human hair samples in the contaminated districts were above the critical value, 1. 0 mg/kg, set by the World Health Organization. Arsenic could be enriched in human hair to very high levels without being affected by As containing water. The results revealed that the soils and plants grown on them are major contributors to elevate hair As in the industrial population. Therefore, the potential impact on human health of ingestion/inhalation of soil As around the industrial districts seems to be rather serious. Hence proper treatments for As contaminated soils are urgently needed to reduce the contamination. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

The gods {{collected}} all the most powerful poisons from all around the world {{and put it in a}} small container. The poison was later secretly put into Sri's drink. She was poisoned to death and died almost instantly. Her sudden death had caused guilt and fear among gods, since they have committed the sin of killing an innocent girl. This unjust act had incited the wrath of the universe and Sang Hyang Kersa, the supreme god that usually kept silent, punished the gods by sending the storm and peculiar harsh weather upon the heavenly kingdom. In tears of fears the gods took her body away from heaven and buried somewhere on earth in a far and hidden place. However, because of Sri Pohaci's innocence and divinity, her grave showed a miraculous sign; for at the time of her burial, up grew some useful plants that would forever benefit human beings.
