50|$|At first, {{the player}} {{is limited to}} the section of the casino with the lowest maximum bets. As the player meets his {{monetary}} obligations through winning casino games, the player is transferred from room to room. Each room has its floor in different colors like royal blue and red. As the player moves up to a higher level floor, the maximum bets for the individual games found will increase. Slot machines that once had a denomination of $1 and $5 will become slot machines with denominations of $100 and $1000 as the player accumulates more money in his <b>virtual</b> <b>wallet.</b> A cashier can provide the player with passwords that will allow him to continue to game at a later date. Rooms eventually connect to each other after gaining a certain amount of money; allowing players with bad luck to rebuild their fortunes at the lower-risk games.|$|E

5000|$|Currently {{there is}} no way to {{exchange}} onecoins to any other currency. Previous to January 2017 the only way to exchange onecoins to any other currency was OneCoin Exchange, xcoinx, an internal market place for members who had invested more than just a starter package. This service was shutdown without warning in January 2017. [...] While it was functioning, onecoins could only be exchanged for euros, which were placed in a <b>virtual</b> <b>wallet</b> from which they could be requested for wire transfer. The market place had daily selling limits based on which packages the seller had invested in, which greatly limited the amount of onecoins which could be exchanged. On 1 March 2016, without a prior warning, OneCoin issued an internal notice that the market would be closed for two weeks for maintenance. The notice explained that the maintenance was necessary due to high amount of miners and for [...] "better integration with blockchain". On 15 March 2016, after the two-week maintenance, the market opened again but no visible changes had been done; most of the transactions expired as before and daily limits stayed on.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{to build an}} Aadhaar Based Unified Payment Solution. The key idea is that a <b>virtual</b> <b>wallet</b> will {{be linked to the}} Aadhaar card number of the customer. After that, any {{identification}} unique to the person and linked with the Aadhaar card, be it something the person knows like secret Internet-banking password, be it something s/he carries like debit card/ credit card, something s/he owns like fingerprints, voice, email-id or somewhere s/he is like house or office address, can be used for money transfer from the sender's Aadhaar card linked <b>virtual</b> <b>wallet</b> to the receiver's Aadhaar card linked <b>virtual</b> <b>wallet,</b> whose any unique ID is known to the sender. If the sender knows the receiver's email-id, s/he can transfer money to his/ her Aadhaar card linked <b>virtual</b> <b>wallet</b> using the email-id. And, if the sender knows receiver's mobile number but not email-id, s/he can use the mobile number to transfer the money to his/ her Aadhaar card linked <b>virtual</b> <b>wallet.</b> And so on.

40|$|Smartphones {{are being}} {{increasingly}} used to perform financial transactions (through m-banking, <b>virtual</b> <b>wallet</b> or as a smartcard). The latter applications involve contactless technology (e. g., NFC) {{that is known}} to be vulnerable to mafia fraud attacks. In this work we show that a secret message inside an appropriately folded piece of paper (fortune cookie) can be used to effectively mitigate the mafia fraud attack. Fortune cookies implement a weakly unrelayable channel that, in combination with smartphones, provides a provable protection against those attacks. Our solution requires minimal or no hardware changes to the existing equipment (especially on the userâ€™s side) and is suitable for different communication technologies (e. g., intra-body communication, NFC, WiFi, Bluetooth, sound, infrared) ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} how {{mobile phones}} {{may be used}} to extend banking services to the â€˜unbankedâ€™. Generally, many more people possess mobile phones than bank accounts across Africa. Mobile banking services are already offered as an addition to existing bank accounts. Instead of adding a mobile phone as a complementary channel, why not add a bank account to an existing mobile phone number? This would narrow the access gap considerably, allowing mobile phones to be used to provide financial services to those without bank accounts. Two models are discussed that may help narrow the access gap: firstâ€”airtime cash convertibility, already a defacto practice in many parts of Africa, and secondâ€”the mobile wallet, which would allow full banking services to be performed {{on the basis of a}} <b>virtual</b> <b>wallet</b> linked to a SIM card. Results from Research ICT Africaâ€™s 2007 / 8 e-Access & Usage household Survey are used to investigate the current usage of airtime as a means of payment as well as the potential demand for m- banking. Regulatory challenges to the adoption of m-banking as well as potential business models and possible models of cooperation between banks and mobile operators are also explored...|$|E
