5|$|Polled Dorsets are a {{medium-sized}} sheep that are long lived and prolific, heavy milkers. They produce hardy lambs with moderate growth and maturity that yield heavily muscled carcasses. Their fleece is <b>very</b> <b>white,</b> strong, close, free from dark fiber and extends down the legs. When shorn, fleece averages {{between five and}} nine pounds (2.23 to 4kg) in ewes and fifty to seventy percent of their fleece can be used. The staple length ranges from 2.5 to 4 inches (6 to 10cm) with a numeric count of 46's-58's. The fiber diameter ranges from 27.0 to 33.0 microns. At maturity, ewes weigh between 150 and 200 pounds (67 to 91kg), some weighing more in show condition. Mature rams range in weight from 225 to 275 pounds (102 to 125kg). Dorsets are noted {{for their ability to}} be bred more than once per year and are commonly used in crossbreeding to produce females for out-of-season breeding. They {{are one of the few}} breeds that have this characteristic. Multiple births are common and they work well in commercial operations, including programs where rams are specifically used to sire lambs for slaughter. These rams are known as terminal sires since their genetics are more suitable for slaughter than breeding purposes.|$|E

From first hand accounts of his physical appearance Umar is said to be vigorous, robust and a very tall man, in markets he would tower above the people. The front part of his head was bald, always A'sara Yusran (working with two hands), both his eyes were black, with yellow skin, however, ibn Sa'ad in his book stated that he never knew that 'Umar had yellow skin, except if the people took into criterion a certain part of his life where his color changed because he always ate oil at that part of his life. Others say he had reddish-white skin. His teeth were ashnabul asnan (<b>very</b> <b>white</b> shining). He would always color his beard and take care of his hair using a type of plant.|$|E

In 1998, Chamberlain returned to Allen Field House in Lawrence, Kansas to participate in a jersey-retiring ceremony for his #13. Around this time, he has been quoted as saying: [...] "There's been a lot of conversation, since people have been trying to get my jersey number retired, that I have some dislike for the University of Kansas. That is totally ridiculous." ...|$|E

He's got this weird face, with a broken nose and greasy hair. He's starting to bald, but he's always got a <b>very</b> <b>white</b> separation in the middle of it. He's just so greasy, he's great to draw. And he still has to be seductive at the same time, so you can't make him repulsive... He's such a great character." ...|$|E
500|$|Gaga covered [...] "Orange Colored Sky" [...] {{during a}} {{surprise}} appearance at The Oak Room in New York City on September 29, 2010, {{and again on}} January 5, 2011. Brian Newman served as a guest performer on trumpet for performances at the Robin Hood Gala on May 9, 2011, to benefit the Robin Hood Foundation, and at BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend in Carlisle, England on May 15, 2011. Gaga later performed it on the ABC Christmas special A Very Gaga Thanksgiving, along with a cover version of [...] "White Christmas". Gaga put emphasis on the jazz side of the song. She added a second verse, describing the original song as [...] "too short". In the verse, Gaga describes a snowman, saying that Santa Claus {{is on his way}} to meet him. The lyrics end with Gaga saying, [...] "Okay, so I suppose it's not <b>very</b> <b>white</b> outside yet." [...] The songs on A Very Gaga Holiday were recorded during the shooting of A Very Gaga Thanksgiving at the Convent of the Sacred Heart, New York City.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "All Is Full of Love" [...] was {{directed}} by Chris Cunningham. Björk was impressed by Cunningham's original music videos for IDM musicians Autechre, Squarepusher, and Aphex Twin, and by his clear lines, science fiction inclinations, and discordant imagery. This resulted in the singer contacting him to meet at his London office; she brought Chinese Kama Sutra {{as a guide to}} what she wanted. Cunningham had also associated the track with sex upon hearing it, but could not {{figure out how to make}} the video explicit yet broadcastable. Regarding this, the singer confessed, [...] "I think the only thing I said was that I thought it was <b>very</b> <b>white</b> [...] and I'm trying to describe some sort of a heaven. But I wanted also to have the other level there, there would be lust, it wouldn't be just clean". She complemented saying she mentioned that the video should be [...] "white" [...] and [...] "frozen", and then it [...] "melts because of love" [...] and [...] "making love".|$|E

2500|$|The Spanish {{described}} Plains dogs as <b>very</b> <b>white,</b> {{with black}} spots, and [...] "not {{much larger than}} water spaniels." [...] Plains dogs were slightly smaller than those used for hauling loads by modern Inuit and northern First Nations people in Canada. Recent experiments show these dogs may have pulled loads up to 50 lb (20kg) on long trips, at rates as high as two or three miles per hour (3 to 5km/h). The Plains migration theory associates the Apache peoples with the Dismal River culture, an archaeological culture known primarily from ceramics and house remains, dated 1675–1725, which has been excavated in Nebraska, eastern Colorado, and western Kansas.|$|E

Millwood had been heading home from a visit to his parents and sister, who lived in Black Lion Lane. According to Anne Millwood, the plasterer's sister, immediately after seeing her brother off, she heard Smith challenge him, saying [...] "Damn you; who are you and what are you?

During the twelve years she worked as an actress, she never went to the beach or allowed herself to get a suntan, feeling {{that it was important}} to keep her skin <b>very</b> <b>white,</b> so that it could be seen turning red during some of the scenes involving such things as whippings or melting candle wax tortures. Tani wrote in 1998 [...] "The woman's naked body must not only be seen as a sensual object, but must also be able to express emotion; so, I did my best to keep Naomi Tani's body as close as possible to perfect condition." ...|$|E

2500|$|As sabino-type {{markings}} also originate on the underside, some splashed whites can {{be mistaken}} for cleanly marked sabinos. Both patterns can be present on the same horse, but splashed white markings are crisp and blocky, and horizontally distributed. In particular, the face markings of splashed whites are straight-edged and bottom heavy, whereas those of sabinos are often tapering or feathered, and often vertical in orientation. The presence of additional white patterning genes can intensify the amount or obscure the characteristics of splashed white markings. [...] There is some association between splashed white and deafness in horses that are <b>very</b> <b>white,</b> but {{more research is needed}} to determine how this occurs. White extending onto the ears is hypothesized to correlate to deafness. SW-1 has been found in homozygous form, but based on studies in mice, it is possible that SW-2 and SW-3 are homozygous lethals.|$|E
2500|$|In Who Would Have Thought It?, the {{experience}} of Lola Medina, the supposed protagonist of the story, mirrors many aspects of Ruiz de Burton's own life. [...] The character of Lola is a daughter of an aristocratic Spanish family from Mexico, who is adopted by a respected New England doctor and taken to the East Coast. [...] Lola is well educated, perfectly fluent in Spanish and English, good mannered, yet disrespected by the doctor's Protestant, white family and friends. [...] Lola is ostracized due to her appearances. [...] As a child her skin had been tinted to disguise her as an Indian, setting her apart from the <b>very</b> <b>white</b> ruling New England class. [...] The doctor however, attempts to vouch for her, because he knows the truth of her background, and explains {{that she is not}} in fact [...] "other" [...] as her appearance suggests, but rather has [...] "pure Spanish blood" [...] of potentially royal lineage [...] and deserves to be treated with due respect. [...] In the conclusion of the novel, Lola Medina is sent away to Mexico to be with her family, suggesting that despite her belief and the belief of the educated doctor that she has legitimate right to be in the US, her true place is not there, but in Mexico. [...] In Ruiz de Burtons own life, she was married young to a respected East Coast Protestant man, yet always felt herself to be an outsider in New England, despite her education, wealth, and European lineage. [...] Her appearance and name always gave her away.|$|E
