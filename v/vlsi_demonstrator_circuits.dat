Currently used topologies have disadvantages such as high power loss, analog controlling and high degree of signal distortion. This work first simulates available topologies which were previously developed by the company in order to compare them and build a trade-off list so the most suitable circuit is selected.

The flexibility of the topology as well as the possibility of implementing a digital control was also confirmed during this phase of the project.

40|$|The Doherty power {{amplifier}} (DPA) {{is one of}} the most popular {{power amplifier}} (PA) architectures used to obtain high efficiency for modern communication signals having high peak-to-average power ratios. Its often narrowband performance does, however, make it difficult for the DPA to meet the increasing demands of frequency agility in modern wireless communication systems. This thesis examines the theoretical and practical bandwidth limitations of the DPA and presents new methods to overcome them. A new type of output network topology that serves to reduce the influence of device output parasitics and to overcome manufacturing limitations, thereby extending the bandwidth, is proposed. The utility of the network is demonstrated by implementation in a gallium nitride (GaN) monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) DPA. Measurements show that by doing so, a power added efficiency (PAE) higher than 30 % at 9 dB output power back-off (OPBO) is obtained across a 6. 7 – 7. 8 GHz frequency range. To overcome the inherent bandwidth limitations imposed by the impedance inverter, a modified DPA is proposed. A comprehensive theoretical analysis is presented which shows that the modified DPA has a significantly larger bandwidth compared to the standard DPA, as well as reconfigurable efficiency. The theoretical findings are validated by the design and characterization of two <b>demonstrator</b> <b>circuits.</b> The first circuit, having dual RF-inputs and using baredie GaN devices, has a drain efficiency higher than 48 % at both full output power and at 6 dB OPBO across a 1. 5 – 2. 4 GHz frequency range. The second circuit is a single RF-input GaN MMIC DPA that delivers a PAE higher than 30 % at 9 dB OPBO from 5. 8 to 8. 8 GHz, constituting a fractional bandwidth of 41 %. To achieve bandwidths greater than one octave, a linear multi-harmonic analysis method based on a Doherty-outphasing continuum is proposed. By using this method a dual RF-input amplifier is designed. Measurements show that the amplifier provides more than 45 % PAE at 6 dB OPBO over a 1. 0 – 3. 0 GHz frequency range, corresponding to a 100 % fractional bandwidth.

40|$|The Doherty power {{amplifier}} (DPA) {{is one of}} the most popular {{power amplifier}} architectures for obtaining high average efficiency for modern communication signals with high peak-to-average power ratios (PAPR). However, the DPA suffers from often having narrowband performance which limits its capabilities in wideband and/or multi-standard microwave and radio frequency applications. In this thesis, the theoretical and practical bandwidth limitations of the DPA are examined and it is demonstrated, by theory and measurements, how to design high performance and wideband DPAs. A Tee-line network of transmission lines is presented that enables simple design of Doherty combining networks in many situations where traditional approaches would fail. The utility of the Tee-line network is demonstrated by implementation in a 7 - 8 GHz gallium nitride (GaN) monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) DPA. Continuous wave measurements showed a power added efficiency (PAE) larger than 30 % at 9 dB output power back-off across a 6. 7 - 7. 8 GHz frequency range. The maximum output power was maintained within 35 ± 0. 5 dBm from 6. 6 to 8. 5 GHz. Linearized modulated measurements, employing a signal with 7. 8 dB (PAPR), reported average PAE larger than 35 %, with an average output power of 27. 5 ± 0. 2 dBm and an adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) less than - 45 dBc, across a 6. 8 - 8. 5 GHz frequency range.

For Philips, this technology is interesting for integrated LED drivers as used e. g. in automotive head lamps.

The contributions by Philips Research to the project are to derive a circuit concept and create a <b>demonstrator</b> <b>circuit</b> for an automotive LED headlight driver. Further contributions are the design of integrated magnetic components and the characterization of related soft-magnetic materials. For the LED driver, a resonant converter is selected to minimize switching losses. The demonstrator driver is built as a multilayer PCB with functional layers. It includes winding and soft-magnetic layers for the inductive component and PCB integrated power FETs. The 15 W converter has a size of 34 mm x 66 mm with PCB thickness of about 4 mm. It converts an input voltage of 9 V to 18 V to the output of 1 A and about 15 V. The losses are mainly determined by the magnetic component, which are still too high because of the limited properties of the PCB integrated soft-magnetic material. To investigate the properties of soft-magnetic layers, a measurement setup is designed and built, which is used to measure the magnetic permeability of thin layers. 47 samples of Ferrite Polymer Compound (FPC), which were manufactured by the project partner PYCO, are characterized.

It is analytically shown that high efficiency {{can be maintained}} over a wide power dynamic range if the imaginary part of the Class-E load impedance is varied along with the duty cycle (pulsewidth). Using the theory developed, an explicit design procedure is presented that allows practical realization of the proposed topology from the circuit and component specifications. Following the design procedure, and using in-house (Chalmers University, Goteborg, Sweden) SiC varactor diodes to implement the tunable imaginary load impedance, a 2 -GHz 10 -W peak output power GaN HEMT <b>circuit</b> <b>demonstrator</b> is realized. RF-PWM input signals for characterization of the prototype power amplifier (PA) is generated with a dedicated 65 -nm CMOS modulator. The measurements show that a drain efficiency > 70 % can be obtained over an 6. 5 -dB dynamic range, which verifies the theory presented and demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed PA topology...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} energy {{optimization}} in multi-core systems (such as single-chip multiprocessors) where the individual energy demands of various processing elements {{are governed by}} instantaneous workload requirements is well defined in literature. The significance {{of the problem is}} underlined by the increasing prominence of multi-core systems that must operate under strict power/energy budget constraints, both in mobile applications and in cases where special cooling arrangements can be very expensive. A range of solutions have been proposed over the last few years, which are mostly based on static, off-line calculation of a limited set of operating points in the form of optimum voltage and frequency assignments, that are subsequently chosen according to actual demands. Still, to our best knowledge, none of these studies have demonstrated an on-line solution to complex, multi-variable energy optimization problem which allows dynamic adjustment of individual operating frequencies and supply voltages of multiple processing elements. This thesis presents the design and silicon implementation of an analog-based energy optimizer unit, which is capable of dynamically adjusting power supply and clock frequencies of multiple embedded cores, tailored to the instantaneous workload information (computational task) and fully adaptive to variations in process and temperature. Our approach borrows from the basic principles of analog computation to continuously optimize the system-wide energy dissipation of multiple processing elements, converging on the global minima of the constrained optimization problem which are represented as stable operating points of a simple feedback loop. It is already well known that stable, approximate solutions of multi-variable optimization problems (such as gradient descent) can be obtained by using very compact analog circuits, e. g. resistive networks. The analogy between the energy minimization problem under timing constraints in a general task graph and the power minimization problem under Kirchhoff's current law constraints in an equivalent resistive network is exploited. The implementation of the on-line analog optimizer is then discussed. The realization of the blocks composing the system architecture is described, and circuit design issues are studied thoroughly. The three-loop <b>demonstrator</b> <b>circuit</b> of the proposed analog optimizer architecture has been implemented using a 0. 18 μm standard digital CMOS process. The overall circuit area of the optimizer is (245 μm × 650 μm) excluding decoupling capacitors, while each loop circuit occupies only (180 μm × 120 μm). Operating at a nominal supply of 1. 8 V, the circuit is capable of supporting the desired frequency range of 170 MHz - 290 MHz, as well as the voltage range of 1. 2 V - 1. 8 V. Estimated workload levels for each task (loop) are provided as 4 -bit binary inputs, and the corresponding solution for minimum energy consumption is observed as assigned supply voltages and operating frequencies for each processing element, for a certain task duration. The measured worst-case settling time for supply voltages is less than 50 μs. The average power consumption of the entire three-loop optimizer is 4 mW. Measurements experimentally validate the concept of fully analog, current-based solution to implement on-line energy minimization in complex multi-core systems under varying workload conditions. Key functional blocks of the proposed circuit operate in weak inversion, resulting in very low power dissipation for the optimizer. The prototype successfully demonstrates that the proposed optimizer block is also capable of taking into account the on-chip variations of temperature as well as process parameters. As such, it {{can be used as a}} generic building block for on-line energy optimization in complex systems...|$|R
40|$|In {{this chapter}} {{we discuss the}} problem of "chaos generation", namely {{efficient}} techniques {{for the design of}} circuits to be employed as generators of chaotic signals (or sample sequences) in engineering applications. As intelligent computing techniques exploiting chaotic dynamics take momentum, synthesisers of chaotic waveforms become important design primitives. Consequently, design approaches suitable for cost containment, high robustness, and low susceptibility to external interference need to be formalised. This topic is particularly significant since digital hardware can deliver dynamics matching the characteristics of chaotic models only in the short term, and truly chaotic behaviour needs analog subsystems, for which design efforts are higher. The chapter opens with a concise history of chaotic circuits. This illustrates how the focus has progressively shifted from mere <b>demonstrators,</b> to <b>circuits</b> and systems finally optimised for typical merit indexes of engineering applications. The move from initial, mostly speculative designs to a real confrontation with emerging applications marked a key point in the design of "chaos generators". On one hand it posed precise statistical requirements {{and on the other hand}} it let important implementation robustness issues emerge. In the central part of the chapter, after a quick comparison of continuous-time vs discrete-time chaotic models, the focus goes on the latter. A brief review of techniques for their electronic implementation is presented illustrating how significant advantages can be obtained by concentrating on those that enable an eefficient reuse of existing hardware. A discussion on how chaotic circuits can be derived from Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) architectures is presented. Some hints at how the proposed approach also presents side advantages such as a particularly good rejection of interference is also provided. In the last part of the chapter, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is proved by measurements made on real prototypes. This part is also the occasion to underline that not always applications require "true analog chaos" but that when they do, the ability to achieve it by building blocks ready available on most electronic systems can lead to a strategic advantage...|$|R

A new biochemical measurement system able to sense key properties of biochemical fluids is presented. This new integrated circuit biochemical sensor, called the Chemical Current-Conveyor, uses the ion sensitive field effect transistor as the input sensor combined with the current-conveyor, an analog building-block, to produce a range of measurement systems. The concept of the Chemical Current-Conveyor is presented together with the design and subsequent fabrication of a <b>demonstrator</b> integrated <b>circuit</b> built on conventional 0. 35 μm CMOS silicon technology. The silicon area of the Chemical Current-Conveyor is (92 μm x 172 μm) for the N-channel version and (99 μm x 165 μm) for the P-channel version. Power consumption for the N-channel version is 30 μW and 43 μW for the P-channel version with a full load of 1 MΩ. The maximum sensitivity achieved for pH measurement was 46 mV per pH. The potential of the Chemical Current Conveyor as a versatile biochemical integrated circuit, able to produce output information in an appropriate form for direct clinical use has been confirmed by applications including measurement of (i) pH, (ii) buffer index (), (iii) urea, (iv) creatinine and (v) urea:creatinine ratio.

40|$|The More Than Moore {{concept of}} {{heterogeneous}} integration of MMICs with non-semiconductor functional components promotes, in particular, integration with ferroelectric based devices. This allows development of next generation reconfigurable/adaptable microwave devices and intelligent/smart systems. The ferroelectric varactors incorporating BaxSr 1 -xTiO 3 films with performance comparable {{or better than}} that of semiconductor analogues have been developed and successfully used in commercially competitive microwave <b>circuit</b> <b>demonstrators.</b> The potentially high Q-factor of the BaxSr 1 -xTiO 3 varactors at microwave frequencies {{is determined by the}} low intrinsic loss of the material in the paraelectric state. This talk addresses key issues of the microwave ferroelectric varactors development: extrinsic losses associated with film structural imperfections, resonant acoustic phenomena and circuit parasitics. The major extrinsic loss mechanisms in a ferroelectric film are studied in details and modelled. The analyses of field and frequency responses and charge currier transport mechanisms show that the dominant loss is usually due to charged defects associated with oxygen vacancies. This knowledge allows controlled improvement of the film microstructure via optimization of the growth conditions and subsequent reduction of the microwave loss down to its fundamental limit. The loss due to resonant microwave power absorption, caused by field induced piezoeffect, is studied and simulated using electroacoustic model of the multilayer varactor structure. It is proposed and confirmed experimentally that, by optimizing the varactor layered structure, it is possible to suppress the acoustic resonances and reduce the corresponding microwave loss. The analysis of an equivalent circuit model of the varactor shows that the microwave loss associated with parasitic series resistance of the electrode stack and interconnect strips can contribute substantially (even dominate) to the total loss balance. The series resistance loss is strongly depends on the area and shape factor of the varactor plates. This loss can be minimized by optimizing the varactor layout...|$|R
40|$|Indium {{phosphide}} high {{electron mobility}} transistors (InGaAs/InAlAs/InP HEMTs) exhibit the highest cut-off frequencies {{and the lowest}} microwave noise figures of all transistor technologies. Both InP HEMT technology and associated <b>circuit</b> <b>demonstrators</b> are therefore interesting to explore further. In this work, InP HEMTs have been demonstrated on different epitaxial structures, mainly lattice-matched InGaAs/InAlAs/InP, but also on materials containing phosphorus and high indium concentration layers. Device results include a single delta doped 0. 14 -mm HEMT with a current gain cut-off frequency (f T) of 135 GHz and a power gain cut-off frequency (f max) of 265 GHz obtained on a lattice-matched material with an InP etch stop layer. Recent progress in the gate process technology has enabled 50 nm gate-length devices to be fabricated routinely on pseudomorphic In 0. 65 Ga 0. 35 As/In 0. 40 Al 0. 60 As/InP material with f T and f max values in excess of 260 GHz and 310 GHz respectively. Passive components designed for monolithic integration have also been developed and evaluated. Thin film resistors (TFRs) and metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors have been investigated using reactive sputtering. Results include 85 ?/square tantalum nitride TFRs and 300 pF/mm 2 silicon nitride MIM capacitors. Special {{attention has been paid}} to the modeling of MIM capacitors.
