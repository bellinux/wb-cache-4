5000|$|A common {{way to do}} this is so {{that the}} front-panel has a [...] "step" [...] (as shown in the above image) where the tweeter mounts at some {{distance}} behind the woofer. This step can cause more errors in summing than the time delay between the drivers due to the diffraction of the tweeter's sound waves around the step. Sloping and rounding the edges of the step helps in reducing diffraction, but it cannot be eliminated completely. Also, the more gradual the slope, greater is the vertical separation between the drivers, which in turn again causes thinning of the lobe (i.e., increase in <b>vertical</b> <b>directivity)</b> at the crossover frequency.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{approach for}} studying the <b>vertical</b> <b>directivity</b> pattern of noise radiated from a passing train is presented. Four sets of noise measurements are conducted at three different sites, including ballast tracks at grade and railway on a concrete viaduct. The time histories computed from a horizontal radiation model are compared with the measured noise profiles. The measured sound exposure levels are used to deduce the <b>vertical</b> <b>directivity</b> pattern for different railway systems of continuously welded rail systems. It is found that the <b>vertical</b> <b>directivity</b> of different railway systems shows a rather similar pattern. The <b>vertical</b> <b>directivity</b> of train noise is shown to increase up to about 30 ° before reducing to a minimum at 90 °. A multipole expansion model is proposed {{to account for the}} vertical radiation directivity of the train noise. The empirical model is found to be applicable to different train/rail systems at train speeds ranging up to 120 km/h. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|The <b>vertical</b> <b>{{directivity}}</b> {{pattern of}} mid-frequency ambient noise {{in shallow water}} is anisotropic. The directivity pattern is asymmetric about the horizontal, a fact that can be exploited to estimate seabed reflectivity, and under appropriate oceanographic conditions it might also show a pronounced notch in the horizontal, a fact that can be exploited for source localization. The ambient noise field is typically highly variable in time, however, hampering its usefulness for either purpose. In the present work, a recently developed model for the mid-frequency ambient noise field is reviewed [1]. The premise of the model is that internal waves are responsible both {{for some of the}} observed variability in the noise field and for partially filling the noise notch. The model integrates three components: a modern shallow-water internal wave model, a noise model, and an acoustic propagation model that uses transport theory. The model output is the <b>vertical</b> <b>directivity</b> pattern of the ambient noise. Model predictions are compared to results from the 2001 East China Sea Experiment using data collected on a vertical array in the 1 to 5 kHz band. Making the realistic assumption that the background internal waves are of moderate strength, the predicted depth of the ambient noise notch is in good agreement with the observations...|$|E

30|$|Better {{well logging}} {{techniques}} for geologic investigations are urgently needed {{to identify and}} evaluate complex reservoirs. We describe {{a new type of}} 3 D transmitter station with corresponding circuits and bodies. They {{can be used in a}} promising new technique of acoustic reflection well logging, that features better azimuthal detection capabilities, as well as better investigation depth. The transmitter stations consist of three-level subarrays that can radiate acoustic energy in any required azimuth of 3 D space by circularly exciting various combinations at different levels. We tested the 3 D acoustic transmitter stations and obtained laboratory directivity measurements with the 3 D acoustic transmitter stations for the first time. The results show that the 3 -dB beam width in the horizontal plane ranges from 59 ° to 67 ° as a result of phase-delayed excitation. The main beam is steered in the vertical plane at a deflection angle that ranges from 0 ° to 16 ° when the delay time of the excitation pulse between each pair of adjacent arc arrays is gradually adjusted. The 3 -dB beam width is equal to 11 °, whereas the deflection angle in the vertical plane is equal to 14 °. Each of the four third-level subarrays in the same circumferential direction display consistent horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>directivities,</b> thus satisfying the requirements of azimuthal acoustic reflection logging.|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} Figs.  8 b, 6 b, and the {{corresponding}} tables, the third-level subarrays (three-element arc arrays) radiate acoustic waves with amplitudes that are approximately 2.5 times greater {{than those of the}} acoustic waves radiated by an individual element. The observed spectra are essentially identical. In addition, the 3 -dB beam width of the <b>vertical</b> <b>directivity</b> that is radiated by the third-level subarray is approximately 60 °, which reveals that three-element arc arrays can radiate focused acoustic energy in a certain azimuthal range while radiating weak acoustic energy in other directions.|$|E
40|$|Former {{measurement}} {{investigation on}} the directivity of wheel/rail radiation has specified that (1) rail radiation is of dipole directivity {{character in the}} horizontal direction, while it is only about 4 dB more directional than a monopole source in a vertical plane perpendicular to the rail; (2) the directivity of wheel radiation {{is close to the}} <b>vertical</b> <b>directivity</b> of rail radiation. The work presented in this article intends to interpret the phenomenon. It is found that a model of perpendicular dipole pair can explain these directivity characteristics specified by the measurement. This model naturally explains why rail radiation is of different horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>directivity</b> characters and why wheel radiation is not a dipole source (at least for wheels with a curved web). The study also emphasizes that, when considering the directivity effect of a dipole source, the orientation of the dipole axis needs to be specified. Moreover when more than one dipole is concerned, a special disposition of the dipoles together with a selection of difference in their sound powers can result in a change of directivity pattern from that of a monopole to that of a dipole. Since rail radiation dominates at low speed while wheel radiation becomes more important at high speed, the horizontal directivity of rolling noise varies with train speed. Therefore, this work on the directivity can help with to construct a proper directivity description of rolling noise, which is important for an accurate wayside noise prediction at different train speeds...|$|E

This paper explores the actual noise impact of this alternative drivetrain technology on the noise emission of a mid-size delivery truck powered by a parallel hybrid powertrain, compared with an equivalent internal combustion engine truck on the basis of pass-by noise measurements. It investigates jointly the overall emission, the main noise sources and the <b>vertical</b> <b>directivity</b> of the vehicle. The essential benefit results from the existence of a full-electric mode below 50 km/h, with a significant noise reduction which may exceed 8 dB(A) at low constant speed.

Due to weaker noise emitted upwards, the benefit should be even greater for residents living on upper building floors.

40|$|For a sound source, {{directivity}} is {{an important}} parameter to specify. This parameter also reflects the physical feature of the sound generation mechanism. For example, turbulence sound is of quadrupole directivity whilst fluid-structure interaction often induces a sound of dipole characteristic. Therefore, to reach a proper directivity description {{is in fact a}} process of understanding the sound source in a better way. However, in practice, this is often not a simple procedure. As for railway noise engineering, several noise types of different directivity characteristics are often mixed together, such as wheel and rail radiation, engine and cooling fan noise, scattered fluid sound around the bogie areas and turbulent boundary layer noise along the train side surfaces. Moreover, it is a question if the horizontal directivity of a line source can be measured directly. All these factors increase difficulties in reaching a proper directivity description that may explain why modelling directivities of railway noise sources is so far behind modelling their sound powers. This thesis work aims at working out an applicable directivity description of railway noise sources. The study focuses on the two most important railway noise types, i. e. rolling noise and aerodynamic noise. Directivities of these two noise types are studied based on measurement investigation, theoretical problem solution and model analysis. As for wheel/rail radiation, a model of a perpendicular dipole pair (PDP) was proposed to interpret those measurement specified directivity characteristics. This model naturally explains why rail radiation is of different horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>directivities</b> and why a vibrating railway wheel does not present dipole directivity. As for aerodynamic noise, it has been found that pantograph noise is also of perpendicular dipole components. Moreover, for aerodynamic noise around bogie areas, scattering of the air flow was proposed to be the dominant mechanism of the noise generation. This understanding leads to a different directivity description for this noise component. And, once again, scattered fluid sound around the bogie areas and turbulent boundary layer noise along the train side surfaces can be treated as a PDP source. Finally, to complete directivity description of railway noise, directivities of other important noise types have been studied as well; the directivity characteristics of these noise types become understood although lack the relevant directivity data. With all these outputs integrated, a survey of the directivities of all important railway noise sources has been achieved and applicable directivity functions have been worked out. Hopefully, this directivity study provides values not only for railway noise engineering but also for a better understanding of railway noise...|$|R
40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} to predict the reflection of sound at forest edges. A single tree is modelled as a vertical cylinder. For the reflection at a cylinder an analytical solution is given based on the theory of scattering of spherical waves.

The spacing between the cylinders {{is defined as a}} function of frequency and geometrical properties to account for contributions from the depth of the forest. As a consequence of this model assumption of a single line of reflecting cylinders, a variable segmentation of the forest edge and the use of look-up tables for the reflectivity of a single cylinder, a straightforward calculation procedure can be achieved, which allows an implementation in engineering sound propagation models. A validation of the model showed good agreement with measurements. Nevertheless the measurements indicated a tendency to overestimate the levels at frequencies above 1 kHz. Further measurements should be conducted to shed light on this question and to expand additional aspects such as meteorological influences on forest reflections and the behaviour over hilly terrain where a <b>vertical</b> <b>directivity</b> pattern will become important. © S.

40|$|Directivity is an {{important}} parameter to describe a sound source. For railway rolling noise this becomes a complicated issue because its vertical and horizontal directivities depend on many factors. In this paper a complete procedure to determine the vertical and horizontal directivities of railway rolling noise in one-third octave bands has been proposed. The procedure consists of two parts: (1) to define the vertical and horizontal directivities both for track and wheel radiations; (2) to determine the effective vertical and horizontal directivities for the total railway rolling noise. For practical reasons {{it is better to}} include the shielding effect of the car-body, also the low barriers when they are present alongside a track. Since this shielding effect dominates, the inclusive <b>vertical</b> <b>directivity</b> of railway rolling noise can vary with train types, and will also be different when influenced by low barriers (such as viaducts). The horizontal directivity of railway rolling noise is determined by the horizontal directivities of the track and wheel radiations, and weighted by the relative importance of the two sub-sources which is described by the track and vehicle transfer functions. In general, the horizontal directivity of railway rolling noise varies with different vehicle-track combinations...|$|E

This thesis investigates {{the performance of}} various configurations of tactical High Frequency (HF) field deployable antennas {{in the presence of}} lossy earth. Antennas investigated include horizontal dipoles, short sloping wires, inverted vees, and monopoles with buried and elevated radials. Numerical models of the antennas are exercised via the Numerical Electromagnetic Code (NEC) for radiation pattern performance. Antennas are analyzed for applicability to (1) short-range Near Vertical Incident Skywave (NVIS), where high elevation radiation angles are required, (2) medium- and long-range low radiation angle use, and (3) vertically polarized low-angle radiation for ground wave communication. Good NVIS and ground wave performance occurs for horizontal dipoles. Sloping wires and sloping dipoles are similar to horizontal dipoles but exhibit a moderate amount of azimuth plane <b>directivity.</b> <b>Vertical</b> monopoles with at least 15 buried radials produce medium- and long-range skyware coverage and good ground wave performance.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{dedicated}} to the work of Pieter Schippers and gives an overview of his achievement in sonar performance modelling over his career. This publication is the last of a long list, many of which published at UDT [1 - 5]. A historical review is presented of the sonar performance modeling work at TNO in Underwater Acoustics since the mid-seventies. At that time, sonar performance was a hot topic for the upcoming receiver technique using passive low frequencies towed arrays. The aim was entirely focused on detection of hostile submarines, being practically undetectable with other systems. The main challenge was the modeling of propagation, first for deep water, and later also for shallow water. The developed propagation modeling is based on eigenrays. This enabled fast semi-analytical solutions, which was a strong requirement at that time. In the late eighties active sonar regained interest [1, 2], and the active and passive sonar performance model ALMOST of TNO got under development. Sonar modeling got included and source and receiver <b>vertical</b> <b>directivity</b> patterns are applied. Furthermore, ambient noise and reverberation were modelled, based on noise sources at the sea surface, and scatterers at sea surface, volume and bottom, respectively. For active and passive detection performance, detection probability is computed from the modelled SNR for different types of signal processing in the receiver. After the Cold War the sonar bandwidth increased to enable shallow water operations [3]. Targets could no longer be considered as point targets and extended target modeling was started [4]. More attention was paid to input parameters, to properly model the complex environments is shallow water. Recently, graphical user interfacing got more attention [5]. This allows even unskilled operators to get their sonar performance prediction in due time and presented in an intuitive way. The future of sonar performance modeling is both in improving models and inputs, at the same time evaluating errors and uncertainty in the modeling. Pieter will watch this development from this lazy chair...|$|E
