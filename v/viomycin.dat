5000|$|The {{gene cluster}} for <b>viomycin</b> has been sequenced from Streptomyces sp. strain ATCC 11861, Streptomyces vinaceus and from Streptomyces lividans 1326. [...] It {{consists}} of a central cyclic pentapeptide code assembled from nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). The NRPS contains 4 proteins: VioA, VioF, VioI, and VioG. These proteins condense and cyclize two molecules of L-2,3-diaminopropionate (L-Dap), two molecules of L-serine (L-Ser), and one molecule of (2S,3R)-capreomycidine (L-Cam). After cyclizing these, VioJ catalyzes the α,β-desaturation of this preliminary structure. It is proposed that the <b>viomycin</b> gene cluster includes 36.3 kb of contiguous DNA that encodes 20 open reading frames (ORFs) {{that are involved in}} the biosynthesis, regulation, and eventual activation <b>viomycin.</b> In addition to these ORFs, the structure contains the resistance gene vph.

The tuberactinomycins target bacterial ribosomes, binding RNA and disrupting bacterial protein biosynthesis. It is produced by the actinomycete Streptomyces puniceus, that binds to RNA and inhibits prokaryotic protein synthesis and certain forms of RNA splicing.|$|E

5000|$|The {{following}} is the proposed biosynthesis of <b>viomycin</b> using NRPS-catalyzed peptide synthesis. There are five modules for cyclic pentapeptide biosynthesis, {{including one that}} lacks an adenylation domain (A). It is therefore proposed {{that one of the}} other A domains functions twice. Additionally, the NRPS subunits are not suspected to function in the order in which their genes are arranged, a characteristic of <b>viomycin</b> biosynthesis that is unlike typical NRPS-catalyzed peptide synthesis. [...] The NRPS components function in the order of VioA→VioI→VioF→VioG to account for the incorporation of β-ureidoalanine (β-Uda). The first A domain of VioA creates an L-Dap-PCP intermediate on the first PCP domain. Meanwhile, the second A domain of VioA loads L-Ser onto the second PCP domain, as well as the PCP of VioI. The activation of β-Uda occurs via VioF, and VioG incorporates L-Cam.|$|E

Recognition of the antiserum on the /?-Iysine terminus was also examined showing that the antiserum was also recognized on this part. Thus, the anti-viomycin antiserum was deduced to recognize the whole structure of <b>viomycin,</b> from which the deduction was made that the anti-viomycin antibodies in the antiserum must possess cavities fitting the whole structure of <b>viomycin.</b> The crystal dimensions of <b>viomycin</b> are 13 A in length, 8 A in width, and 7 A in depth. Thus, the high dimensional structure of the binding sites of the anti-viomycin anti-bodies was deduced to possess cavities of a similar size to that of <b>viomycin.</b> The molecular basis for the structural diversity of antibody binding sites has become apparent through X-ray diffraction studies on several im-munoglobulin fragments (1 - 5).

Recombinant VioG, a single module peptide synthetase from the <b>viomycin</b> gene cluster cloned from Streptomyces vinaceus (ATCC 11861), is shown to specifically activate capreomycidine for incorporation into <b>viomycin</b> (tuberactinomycin B). Insertional gene disruption of the putative hydroxylase gene vioQ resulted in a mutant that accumulated tuberactinomycin O, confirming that hydroxylation at C- 5 of the capreomycidine residue is a post-assembly event.

40|$|Antibiotics {{that target}} the {{bacterial}} ribosome {{make up about}} half of all clinically used antibiotics. We have studied two ribosome targeting drugs: Fusidic acid and <b>Viomycin.</b> Fusidic acid inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to elongation factor G (EF-G) on the ribosome, thereby inhibiting translocation of the bacterial ribosome. <b>Viomycin</b> binds directly to the ribosome and inhibits both the fidelity of mRNA decoding and translocation. We found that the mechanisms of inhibition of these two antibiotics were unexpectedly complex. Fusidic acid can bind to EF-G on the ribosome during three separate stages of translocation. Binding of the drug to the first and most sensitive state does not lead to stalling of the ribosome. Rather the ribosome continues unhindered to a downstream state where it stalls for around 8 seconds. Dissociation of fusidic acid from this state allows the ribosome to continue translocating but it soon reaches yet another fusidic acid sensitive state where it can be stalled again, this time for 6 seconds. <b>Viomycin</b> inhibits translocation by binding to the pre-translocation ribosome in competition with EF-G. If <b>viomycin</b> binds before EF-G it stalls the ribosome for 44 seconds, much longer than a normal elongation cycle. Both <b>viomycin</b> and fusidic acid probably cause long queues of ribosomes to build up on the mRNA when they bind. <b>Viomycin</b> inhibits translational fidelity by binding to the ribosome during initial selection. We found that the concentration of <b>viomycin</b> required to bind to the ribosome with a given probability during decoding is proportional to the accuracy of the codon∙anticodon pair being decoded. This demonstrated that long standing models about ribosomal accuracy cannot be correct. Finally, we demonstrated that a common <b>viomycin</b> resistance mutation increases the drug binding rate and decreases its dissociation rate. Our results demonstrate that ribosome targeting drugs have unexpectedly complex mechanisms of action. Both fusidic acid and <b>viomycin</b> preferentially bind to conformations of the ribosome other than those that they stabilize. This suggests that determining the structures of stable drug-bound states may not give sufficient information for drug design...|$|E
40|$|The {{requirements}} for the decoding process at the ribosomal A site have been investigated {{in the presence of}} <b>viomycin.</b> For these studies natural mRNA was replaced either by the synthetic oligonucleotide A-U-G(-U) n, with 0 £n£ 4, or by a physical mixture of the oligonucleotides A-U-G and various oligo(U) sequences. Thus the effect of the "removal " of selected covalent bonds from the sequence A-U-G(U) n could be studied. When the ribosomal P site contains tRNA 2 et, then normally the full hexanucleotide "messenger " A-U-G-u-U-U is needed for the EF-Tu-mediated binding of Phe-tRNA into the A site. However in presence of <b>viomycin</b> the pentanucleotide A-U-G-U-U suffices for this. It is also possible in the presence of <b>viomycin</b> to replace A-U-G-U-U-U with mixtures of A-U-G and U-U-U or A-U-G-U and U-U. In all the above systems the binding of Phe-tRNA required the presence of EF-Tu and GTP. The results suggest that <b>viomycin</b> reinforces interactions be-tween aa-tRNA and the A site after the codon-anticodon recogni-tion step...|$|E
40|$|Binding {{studies were}} {{performed}} with a [14 C]-labelled derivative of <b>viomycin,</b> tuberactinomycin 0 (TUM O). TUM O bound to 30 S and 50 S subunits. The binding component was the RNA, since ribosomal proteins did not bind the drug. Other RNAs such as tRNA, phage RNA (MS 2), and homopolynucleotides also bound the drug. Striking {{differences in the}} binding capacity of the various homopolynucleotides were found. Poly(U) bound strongly, poly(G) and poly(C) bound intermediately, whereas poly(A) showed a very low binding. DNA also bound TUM O, although with native DNA the binding was only weak. Finally the effects of <b>viomycin</b> on the assembly in vitro of the 50 S subunit from E. coli were tested. A very strong inhibition was found: when the reconstitution was performed at 0. 5 x 10 (- 6) M <b>viomycin</b> the particles formed sedimented at about 50 S, but showed a residual activity of less than 10 %. The inhibitory power of <b>viomycin</b> {{with respect to the}} in vitro assembly is more pronounced than that found in in vitro systems for protein synthesis...|$|E
40|$|Conformational {{analyses}} of <b>viomycin</b> and related compounds were performed {{by means of}} PMR and CD spectroscopic investigations {{in relation to their}} antimicrobial activities. PMR signals for some er-methines and methylenes in the sixteen-membered ring of <b>viomycin</b> or dihydroviomycin showed different chemical shifts and splitting patterns from those of broxovio-mycin. The differences {{can be explained by the}} different shielding effects on these protons by their neighbouring amide carbonyls due to the rigid or non-rigid conformations of the sixteen-membered ring. Measurements of temperature dependency in PMR signals and model investigations supported this view. The CD spectra of <b>viomycin</b> and related compounds, which were deduced to possess rigid conformations by PMR studies, showed a peak at 215 nm, whereas compounds which were assumed not to have a rigid conformation did not show this peak. Modifications of the double bond of the 3 -ureidodehydroalanine residue resulted in a conformational change of the sixteen-membered ring together with inactivation or reduction in antimicrobial activity. Thus, the dehydro residue in <b>viomycin</b> may have an important role in maintaining the rigid conformation. It is suggested that the rigid conformation is an im-portant factor in the potency of the antibiotic, and the cyclic structure in the antibiotic i...|$|E
40|$|Viomycin-resistant strains {{isolated}} from Mycobacterium smegmatis demonstrated pleiotropic resistance to tuberactinomycin-N, capreomycin, streptomycin, and kanamycin {{as a result}} of mutational alteration of ribosomes, even though they were selected for resistance to a single antibiotic. The pleiotropic drug resistance of three mutants isolated by stepwise selection for resistance to <b>viomycin</b> was due to alteration of the 30 S ribosomal subunit. One mutant, strain A, isolated independently by multiple-step selection to <b>viomycin</b> resistance, was resistant to <b>viomycin,</b> tuberactinomycin-N, and capreomycin through an alteration of the 50 S ribosomal subunit, whereas it was sensitive to kanamycin but resistant to streptomycin through an alteration of the 30 S ribosomal subunit.

40|$|AbstractBackground: The peptide {{antibiotic}} <b>viomycin</b> inhibits ribosomal protein synthesis, group I intron self-splicing and self-cleavage of {{the human}} hepatitis delta virus ribozyme. To understand the molecular basis of RNA binding and recognition by <b>viomycin,</b> we isolated a variety of novel viomycin-binding RNA molecules using in vitro selection. Results: More than 90 % of the selected RNA molecules shared one continuous highly conserved region of 14 nucleotides. Mutational analyses, structural probing, together with footprinting experiments by chemical modification, and Pb 2 +-induced cleavage showed that this conserved sequence harbours the antibiotic-binding site and forms a stem-loop structure. Moreover, the loop {{is engaged in a}} long-range interaction forming a pseudoknot. Conclusions: A comparison between the novel viomycin-binding motif and the natural RNA target sites for <b>viomycin</b> showed that all these segments form a pseudoknot at the antibiotic-binding site.

40|$|Several {{examples}} of inhibition {{of the function}} of a ribozyme or RNA-protein complex have shown that certain antibiotics can interact specifically with RNA. There are, however, few {{examples of}} antibiotics that have a positive, rather than a negative, effect on the function of an RNA. We have found that micromolar concentrations of <b>viomycin,</b> a basic, cyclic peptide antibiotic of the tuberactinomycin group, enhance the cleavage of a ribozyme derived from Neurospora VS RNA. <b>Viomycin</b> decreases by {{an order of magnitude}} the concentration of magnesium required for cleavage. It also stimulates an otherwise insignificant transcleavage reaction by enhancing interactions between RNA molecules. The ability of <b>viomycin</b> to enhance some RNA-mediated reactions but inhibit others, including translation and Group I intron splicing, demonstrates the potential for natural selection by small molecules during evolution in the 'RNA world' and may have broader implications with respect to ribozyme expression and activity in contemporary cells...|$|E

40|$|The aminoglycosides and cyclic polypeptides are {{essential}} {{drugs in the}} treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, underscoring the need for accurate and reproducible drug susceptibility testing (DST). The epidemiological cutoff value (ECOFF) separating wild-type susceptible strains from non-wild-type strains is an important but rarely used tool for indicating susceptibility breakpoints against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In this study, we established wild-type MIC distributions on Middlebrook 7 H 10 medium for amikacin, kanamycin, streptomycin, capreomycin, and <b>viomycin</b> using 90 consecutive clinical isolates and 21 resistant strains. Overall, the MIC variation between and within runs did not exceed +/- 1 MIC dilution step, and validation of MIC values in Bactec 960 MGIT demonstrated good agreement. Tentative ECOFFs defining the wild type were established for all investigated drugs, including amikacin and <b>viomycin,</b> which currently lack susceptibility breakpoints for 7 H 10. Five out of seven amikacin-and kanamycin-resistant isolates were classified as susceptible to capreomycin according to the current critical concentration (10 mg/liter) but were non-wild type according to the ECOFF (4 mg/liter), suggesting that the critical concentration may be too high. All amikacin- and kanamycin-resistant isolates were clearly below the ECOFF for <b>viomycin,</b> and two of them were below the ECOFF for streptomycin, indicating that these two drugs may be considered for treatment of amikacin-resistant strains. Pharmacodynamic indices (peak serum concentration [C-max]/MIC) were more favorable for amikacin and <b>viomycin</b> compared to kanamycin and capreomycin. In conclusion, our data emphasize the importance of establishing wild-type MIC distributions for improving the quality of drug susceptibility testing against Mycobacterium tuberculosis...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} the molecular mechanisms {{of resistance to}} kanamycin and <b>viomycin</b> in Mycobacterium smegmatis. All of the M. smegmatis strains with high-level kanamycin resistance had a nucleotide substitution from A to G at position 1389 of the 16 S rRNA gene (rrs). This position is equivalent to position 1408 of Escherichia coli, and mutation at this position is known to cause aminoglycoside resistance. Mutations from G to A or G to T at position 1473 of the M. smegmatis rrs gene were found in viomycin-resistant mutants which had been designated vicB mutants in our earlier studies. Using the M. smegmatis conjugation system, we confirmed that these mutations indeed contributed to kanamycin and <b>viomycin</b> resistance, and kanamycin susceptibility was dominant over resistance in a heterogenomic strain. Additional experiments showed that three of four Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains with high-level kanamycin resistance had a mutation from A to G at position 1400, which was equivalent to position 1389 of M. smegmatis...|$|E
40|$|Variations of inoculum, pH, and {{composition}} of the agar assay media each influenced the in vitro susceptibility of Nocardia organisms (30 strains of N. asteroides and 6 strains of N. brasiliensis) {{to one or more}} antimicrobial agents incorporated in solid agar and incubated at 37 C for 48 h. Among newer antimicrobial agents, doxycycline, minocycline, and 7 -halogenated lincomycin analogues exhibited the most consistent in vitro inhibitory activity; among older agents, <b>viomycin,</b> erythromycin, and streptomycin exhibited more selective in vitro inhibitory activity, but against a significant percentage of strains tested. N. brasiliensis was conspicuously more susceptible to erythromycin and gentamicin and more resistant to <b>viomycin</b> and capreomycin than was N. asteroides. Cycloserine demonstrated no significant in vitro inhibitory activity when assayed in appropriately augmented alanine-free medium. The outstanding feature of this in vitro survey was the marked variation in susceptibility among individual strains of N. asteroides, which variation deserves more careful consideration in future clinical or experimental therapeutic trials...|$|E
40|$|Mechanisms {{by which}} antibiotic-producing streptomycetes are {{specifically}} resistant to their products have been investigated. Two radically different mechanisms were encountered. Firstly, Streptomyces vinaceus and Streptomyces capreolus {{appear to be}} resistant to their products, <b>viomycin</b> and capreomycin, respectively, through the possession of novel enzymes (viomycin/capreomycin phosphotransferase, capreomycin acetyltransferase) which {{have the capacity to}} maintain intracellular antibiotic in inactive forms. The sites of modification by these enzymes have been established with varying degrees of certainty. The ribosomes of these organisms are just as sensitive to these antibiotics as are those of non-producing bacteria. The gene encoding <b>viomycin</b> phosphotransferase has been cloned from S. vinaceus into Streptomyces lividans, in which it determines resistance to <b>viomycin.</b> In contrast, the resistance of the erythromycin-producing organism, Streptomyces erythreus. to its product results from the total insensitivity of its ribosomes to the antibiotic. This insensitivity was shown to be due to a specific dimethylation of a single adenosine residue in 23 S ribosomal RNA and the enzyme responsible for this modification was isolated and purified. This RNA methylation also renders ribosomes resistant to other antibiotics (members of the MLS group) which share a common ribosomal binding-site with erythromycin. These results validate a previous hypothesis that the mechanism of resistance in the erythromycin-producing organism is essentially identical with that previously found in erythromycin-resistant clinical strains of bacteria. The possible evolutionary relationship of the methylases from the two different sources is discussed, as are the potential applications of such enzymes to the study of ribosome structure and function...|$|E
40|$|Capreomycin, kanamycin, amikacin, and <b>viomycin</b> are {{drugs that}} are used to treat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Each {{inhibits}} translation, and cross-resistance to them is a concern during therapy. A recent study revealed that mutation of the tlyA gene, encoding a putative rRNA methyltransferase, confers capreomycin and <b>viomycin</b> resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria. Mutations in the 16 S rRNA gene (rrs) have been associated with resistance to each of the drugs; however, reports of cross-resistance to the drugs have been variable. We investigated the role of rrs mutations in capreomycin resistance and examined the molecular basis of cross-resistance to the four drugs in M. tuberculosis laboratory-generated mutants and clinical isolates. Spontaneous mutants were generated to the drugs singularly and in combination by plating on medium containing one or two drugs. The frequencies of recovery of the mutants on single- and dual-drug plates were consistent with single-step mutations. The rrs genes of all mutants were sequenced, and the tlyA genes were sequenced for mutants selected on capreomycin, <b>viomycin,</b> or both; MICs of all four drugs were determined. Three rrs mutations (A 1401 G, C 1402 T, and G 1484 T) were found, and each was associated with a particular cross-resistance pattern. Similar mutations and cross-resistance patterns were found in drug-resistant clinical isolates. Overall, the data implicate rrs mutations as a molecular basis for resistance to each of the four drugs. Furthermore, the genotypic and phenotypic differences seen in the development of cross-resistance when M. tuberculosis bacteria were exposed to one or two drugs have implications for selection of treatment regimens...|$|E

40|$|Methodology {{which allows}} {{consistent}} shotgun cloning of streptomycete genes is presented. Parameters that increase transformation efficiency of Streptomyces lividans 66 were adjusted to generate reproducibly {{a population of}} cloned genes likely to represent the entire genome. Factors which influence the recovery of viable transformants include: growth phase of the mycelium, ionic and osmotic characteristics of the medium during protoplast formation and transformation, and moisture content and protoplast density during regeneration. A modified transformation procedure was devised which increased transformation frequency more than 20 -fold (allowing up to 10 (7) primary transformants per microgram of SLP 1. 2 covalently closed circular DNA) and greatly facilitated the cloning of drug resistance genes and biosynthetic genes, using one of two plasmid vectors. <b>Viomycin</b> resistance genes on BamHI or PstI fragments were cloned from S. vinaceus genomic DNA into S. lividans, using the SLP 1. 2 vector. At least three different S. vinaceus BamHI fragments (1. 9, 5. 8, or 8. 5 kilobases) confer <b>viomycin</b> resistance; only one PstI fragment (4. 3 kilobases) was found.

If codon—anticodon {{interaction is}} restricted to only one basepair, the ternary complex leaves the ribosome before GTP hydrolysis. Two basepairs allow hydrolysis of GTP, but the aminoacyl-tRNA dissociates and is recycled, resulting in wastage of GTP.

40|$|In vitro sensitivities {{to various}} drugs {{of a total}} of 106 strains of {{atypical}} mycobacteria were studied in modified Dubos Tween albumin liquid medium. Eight triple-drug com-binations of antituberculous drugs were also evaluated in vitro for their potentiated activities. Minimal to moderate potentiation was demonstrated in the majority of the combinations. From the results, the triple-drug combination- including rifampin, one of three aminoglycosides (streptomycin, kanamycin, <b>viomycin),</b> and either ethionamide or ethambutol-might be recommended for Mycobacterium kansasii infections. Against Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare infections, rifampin-kanamycin-ethiona-mide or rifampin-kanamycin-ethambutol might be the choice if we were to select any triple-drug regimen. None of the triple-drug regimens thus far tested on M. avium-intracellulare were active enough to recommend fully for clinical use. In vivo experi-mental chemotherapy of murine infection with Mycobacterium intracellulare (TMC 1469) on a five-drug regimen, kanamycin-rifampin-cycloserine-ethambutol-ethiona-mide, showed a moderate therapeutic effect but the infection was not eradicated. In spite of increasing interest in atypical mycobac-terial infections in recent years, many problems still remain unsolved in the pathogenesis, the epi-demiology, and the chemotherapy of these curious diseases.
