5|$|Due to {{its status}} an {{international}} language, English is expeditious {{when it comes}} adopting foreign words, and borrows <b>vocabulary</b> from {{a large number of}} other sources. Early studies of English <b>vocabulary</b> by lexicographers, the scholars who formally study <b>vocabulary,</b> compile dictionaries, or both, were impeded by a lack of comprehensive data on actual <b>vocabulary</b> in use from good-quality linguistic corpora, collections of actual written texts and spoken passages. Many statements published {{before the end of the}} 20th century about the growth of English <b>vocabulary</b> over time, the dates of first use of various words in English, and the sources of English <b>vocabulary</b> will have to be corrected as new computerised analysis of linguistic corpus data becomes available.|$|E
5|$|Reading is {{considered}} to be a key element of <b>vocabulary</b> development in school-age children. Before children are able to read on their own, children can learn from others reading to them. Learning <b>vocabulary</b> from these experiences includes using context, as well as explicit explanations of words and/or events in the story. This may be done using illustrations in the book to guide explanation and provide a visual reference or comparisons, usually to prior knowledge and past experiences. Interactions between the adult and the child often include the child's repetition of the new word back to the adult. When a child begins to learn to read, their print <b>vocabulary</b> and oral <b>vocabulary</b> tend to be the same, as children use their <b>vocabulary</b> knowledge to match verbal forms of words with written forms. These two forms of <b>vocabulary</b> are usually equal up until grade 3. Because written language is much more diverse than spoken language, print <b>vocabulary</b> begins to expand beyond oral <b>vocabulary.</b> By age 10, children's <b>vocabulary</b> development through reading moves away from learning concrete words to learning abstract words.|$|E
5|$|As {{children}} get older their rate of <b>vocabulary</b> growth increases. Children probably understand their first 50 words before they produce them. By {{the age of}} eighteen months, children typically attain a <b>vocabulary</b> of 50 words in production, and between two and three times greater in comprehension. A switch from {{an early stage of}} slow <b>vocabulary</b> growth to a later stage of faster growth {{is referred to as the}} <b>vocabulary</b> spurt. Young toddlers acquire one to three words per month. A <b>vocabulary</b> spurt often occurs over time as the number of words learned accelerates. It is believed that most children add about 10 to 20 new words a week. Between the ages of 18 to 24 months, children learn how to combine two words such as no bye-bye and more please. Three-word and four-word combinations appear when most of the child's utterances are two-word productions. In addition, children are able to form conjoined sentences, using and. This suggests that there is a <b>vocabulary</b> spurt between the time that the child's first word appears, and when the child is able to form more than two words, and eventually, sentences. However, there have been arguments as to whether or not there is a spurt in acquisition of words. Only about one in five children do have a spurt. This suggests that most children do not have a <b>vocabulary</b> spurt.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{survey the}} current state of SKOS <b>vocabularies</b> on the Web. We {{identified}} 478 SKOS <b>vocabularies,</b> which were gathered through collections and web crawling. Analyses were then conducted that included investigation of the use of SKOS constructs; the use of SKOS semantic relations and lexical labels; and the structure of <b>vocabularies</b> in terms of the hierarchical and associative relations, branching factors and the depth of the <b>vocabularies.</b> Almost one-third of the SKOS <b>vocabularies</b> collected fall into the term lists category, with no use of any SKOS semantic relations. As concept labelling is core to SKOS <b>vocabularies,</b> a surprising find is that not all SKOS <b>vocabularies</b> use SKOS lexical labels, whether skos:prefLabel or skos:altLabel, for their concepts. The survey results can serve to provide {{a better understanding of the}} modelling styles of the SKOS <b>vocabularies</b> published on the Web, especially when considering the creation of applications that utilize these <b>vocabularies.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|Few <b>vocabulary</b> {{items are}} {{considered}} unique to Ottawa. The influx of speakers of other Ojibwe dialects into the Ottawa area {{has resulted in}} mixing of dialects that were historically distinct. Given that <b>vocabulary</b> spreads readily from one dialect to another {{the presence of a}} particular <b>vocabulary</b> item in a given dialect is not a guarantee of the original source of the item. Two groups of function words are characteristically Ottawa: the sets of demonstrative pronouns and interrogative adverbs are both distinctive relative to other dialects of Ojibwe. Although some of the <b>vocabulary</b> items in each set are found in other dialects, taken as a group each is uniquely Ottawa.|$|E

5|$|The {{phonology}} {{of words}} {{has proven to}} be beneficial to <b>vocabulary</b> development when children begin school. Once children have developed a <b>vocabulary,</b> they utilize the sounds that they already know to learn new words. The phonological loop encodes, maintains and manipulates speech-based information that a person encounters. This information is then stored in the phonological memory, a part of short term memory. Research shows that children's capacities in the area of phonological memory are linked to <b>vocabulary</b> knowledge when children first begin school at age 4–5 years old. As memory capabilities tend to increase with age (between age 4 and adolescence), so does an individual's ability to learn more complex <b>vocabulary.</b>|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{their school}} years, {{children}} {{continue to build}} their <b>vocabulary.</b> In particular, children begin to learn abstract words.

The phonological loop and serial order short-term memory may both {{play an important role}} in <b>vocabulary</b> development.|$|E
40|$|We analyse the {{evolution}} of <b>vocabularies</b> on the Linked Open Data cloud. Based on the recent statistics of the LOD cloud, we have selected the twelve most dominant <b>vocabularies</b> {{in terms of their}} use in different pay-level domains. The number of versions we found for these <b>vocabularies</b> range between 2 to 11. While some ontologies exist for more than 10 years (e. g., FOAF) others are only online since a few years (like DCAT). Our analysis shows that many changes occurred on annotation properties. This reflects a need for more clarification of the terms, especially at early versions of the <b>vocabularies.</b> The majority of changes in the <b>vocabularies</b> are due to changes in other, imported <b>vocabularies.</b> Thus, there is a co-evolution of different <b>vocabularies.</b> This insight has practical impacts to ontology engineers.

Considering {{the need}} for {{metadata}} standards suitable for the Seman-tic Web, this paper describes the RDA Element Sets and the RDA Value Vo-cabularies that were created from attributes and relationships defined in Re-source Description and Access (RDA).

5|$|<b>Vocabulary</b> {{development}} is a process by which people acquire words. Babbling shifts towards meaningful speech as infants grow and produce their first words around the age of one year.

5|$|Each {{attempt to}} answer the mind–body problem {{encounters}} substantial problems. Some philosophers argue that this is because there is an underlying conceptual confusion. These philosophers, such as Ludwig Wittgenstein and his followers {{in the tradition of}} linguistic criticism, therefore reject the problem as illusory. They argue that it is an error to ask how mental and biological states fit together. Rather it should simply be accepted that human experience can be described in different ways—for instance, in a mental and in a biological <b>vocabulary.</b> Illusory problems arise if one tries to describe the one in terms of the other's <b>vocabulary</b> or if the mental <b>vocabulary</b> is used in the wrong contexts. This is the case, for instance, if one searches for mental states of the brain. The brain is simply the wrong context for the use of mental vocabulary—the search for mental states of the brain is therefore a category error or a sort of fallacy of reasoning.|$|E
