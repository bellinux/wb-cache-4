50|$|Spillover {{effect can}} be defined as an {{apparent}} gain in activity for small objects or regions, as opposed to the partial <b>volume</b> <b>effect.</b> It occurs often in biological imaging modalities such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) because of their limited spatial resolution. Although partial <b>volume</b> <b>effect</b> and spillover refer to essentially the same physical problem, it is important to distinguish the outcome of these two different effects. For partial <b>volume</b> <b>effect,</b> the apparent loss of activity in the object is distributed across adjacent voxels, which are considered outside the object, resulting in increase in activity in these voxels. This increase in activity is referred to as spillover, whereas loss in activity is referred to as partial volume loss.|$|E

These {{artifacts}} blur the boundaries between different regions, making accurate delineation of anatomi-cal structures difficult. In this paper, we propose a method for unsupervised estimation of partial <b>volume</b> <b>effects</b> in sin-gle-channel image data. Based on a statistical image mod-el, an algorithm is derived for estimating both partial vol-umes and {{the means of the}} different tissue classes in the image. To compensate for the ill-posed nature of the estima-tion problem, we employ a Bayesian approach that places a prior probability model on the parameters.

40|$|The {{excluded}} <b>volume</b> <b>effects</b> of randomly {{branched polymers}} are investigated. To approach this problem we assume the Gaussian distribution of segments around {{the center of}} gravity.

By simulating a model-polymer system, it is found that the excluded <b>volume</b> <b>effects</b> of branched polymers are manifested pronouncedly under any conditions from the dilution limit to the melt, including the Θ state; every result satisfies the restraining condition: 〈 s^ 2 〉^ 1 / 2 > N^ 1 /d in accord with our experiences. As a result the Gaussian approximation extracts the essential features of the excluded <b>volume</b> <b>effects</b> of branched molecules.

50|$|The partial <b>volume</b> <b>effect</b> can {{be defined}} as the loss of {{apparent}} activity in small objects or regions because of the limited resolution of the imaging system. It occurs in medical imaging and more generally in biological imaging such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). If the object or region to be imaged is less than twice the full width at half maximum (FWHM) resolution in x-, y- and z-dimension of the imaging system, the resultant activity in the object or region is underestimated.A higher resolution decreases this effect, as it better resolves the tissue.|$|E
5000|$|Partial volume loss alone occurs {{only when}} the {{surrounding}} activity of the object or region is zero.And the loss of activity in the object generally involves an increase in activity in adjacent regions, which are considered outside the object (i.e., spillover).

50|$|These high {{concentrations}} of macromolecules occupy {{a large proportion of}} the volume of the cell, which reduces the volume of solvent that is available for other macromolecules. This excluded <b>volume</b> <b>effect</b> increases the effective concentration of macromolecules (increasing their chemical activity), which in turn alters the rates and equilibrium constants of their reactions. In particular this effect alters dissociation constants by favoring the association of macromolecules, such as when multiple proteins come together to form protein complexes, or when DNA-binding proteins bind to their targets in the genome. Crowding may also affect enzyme reactions involving small molecules if the reaction involves a large change in the shape of the enzyme.|$|E

50|$|Flory {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} excluded volume, coined by Werner Kuhn in 1934, to polymers. Excluded volume refers {{to the idea that}} one part of a long chain molecule can not occupy space that is already occupied by another part of the same molecule. Excluded volume causes the ends of a polymer chain in a solution to be further apart (on average) than they would be were there no excluded volume. The recognition that excluded volume was an important factor in analyzing long-chain molecules in solutions provided an important conceptual breakthrough, and led to the explanation of several puzzling experimental results of the day. It also led to the concept of the theta point, the set of conditions at which an experiment can be conducted that causes the excluded <b>volume</b> <b>effect</b> to be neutralized. At the theta point, the chain reverts to ideal chain characteristics - the long-range interactions arising from excluded volume are eliminated, allowing the experimenter to more easily measure short-range features such as structural geometry, bond rotation potentials, and steric interactions between near-neighboring groups. Flory correctly identified that the chain dimension in polymer melts would have the size computed for a chain in ideal solution if excluded volume interactions were neutralized by experimenting at the theta point.|$|E

Probing the low-momentum regime is often problematic for lattice QCD computations {{on account of the}} restriction to periodic momentum modes.
