Isolated dilation of a pupil {{and loss of}} the pupillary light reflex may reflect brain herniation {{as a result of}} rising intracranial pressure (pressure inside the skull). Intraocular hemorrhage (bleeding into the eyeball) may occur in response to the raised pressure: subhyaloid hemorrhage (bleeding under the hyaloid membrane, which envelops the <b>vitreous</b> <b>body</b> of the eye) and vitreous hemorrhage may be visible on fundoscopy. This is known as Terson syndrome (occurring in 3–13 percent of cases) and is more common in more severe SAH.|$|E
25|$|The {{ciliary body}} is {{triangular}} in horizontal section and is coated by a double layer, the ciliary epithelium. The inner layer is transparent and covers the <b>vitreous</b> <b>body,</b> and is continuous from the neural tissue of the retina.

25|$|Arachnids {{have two}} kinds of eyes: the lateral and median ocelli. The lateral ocelli evolved from {{compound}} eyes and may have a tapetum, which enhances the ability to collect light. With the exception of scorpions, which can have up to five pairs of lateral ocelli, there are never more than three pairs present. The median ocelli develop from a transverse fold of the ectoderm. The ancestors of modern arachnids probably had both types, but modern ones often lack one type or the other. The cornea of the eye also acts as a lens, and is continuous with the cuticle of the body. Beneath this is a transparent <b>vitreous</b> <b>body,</b> and then the retina and, if present, the tapetum. In most arachnids, the retina probably {{does not have enough}} light sensitive cells to allow the eyes to form a proper image.|$|E

5000|$|Vitrification is the {{progressive}} partial fusion of a clay, or of a body, {{as a result}} of a firing process. As vitrification proceeds the proportion of glassy bond increases and the apparent porosity of the fired product becomes progressively lower. <b>Vitreous</b> <b>bodies</b> have open porosity, and may be either opaque or translucent. In this context 'zero porosity'; may be defined as less than 1% water absorption. However, various standard procedures define the conditions of water absorption. An example is by ASTM, who state [...] "The term vitreous generally signifies less than 0.5% absorption. except for floor and wall tile and low-voltage electrical insulators which are considered vitreous up to 3% water absorption." ...|$|R

2500|$|In time, the {{liquefied}} <b>vitreous</b> <b>body</b> loses {{support and}} its framework contracts. This leads to posterior vitreous detachment, {{in which the}} vitreous membrane is released from the sensory retina. During this detachment, the shrinking vitreous can stimulate the retina mechanically, causing the patient to see random flashes across the visual field, {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "flashers", a symptom more formally referred to as photopsia. The ultimate release of the vitreous around the optic nerve head sometimes makes a large floater appear, usually {{in the shape of a}} ring ("Weiss ring"). As a complication, part of the retina might be torn off by the departing vitreous membrane, in a process known as retinal detachment. This will often leak blood into the vitreous, which is seen by the patient as a sudden appearance of numerous small dots, moving across the whole field of vision. Retinal detachment requires immediate medical attention, as it can easily cause blindness. Consequently, both the appearance of flashes and the sudden onset of numerous small floaters should be rapidly investigated by an eye care provider.|$|E
2500|$|Eye {{floaters}} {{are suspended}} in the vitreous humour, the thick fluid or gel that fills the eye. The vitreous humour, or <b>vitreous</b> <b>body,</b> is a jelly-like, transparent substance that fills {{a majority of the}} eye. It lies within the vitreous chamber behind the lens, {{and is one of the}} four optical components of the eye. Thus, floaters follow the rapid motions of the eye, while drifting slowly within the fluid. When they are first noticed, the natural reaction is to attempt to look directly at them. However, attempting to shift one's gaze toward them can be difficult as floaters follow the motion of the eye, remaining to the side of the direction of gaze. Floaters are, in fact, visible only because they do not remain perfectly fixed within the eye. Although the blood vessels of the eye also obstruct light, they are invisible under normal circumstances because they are fixed in location relative to the retina, and the brain [...] "tunes out" [...] stabilized images due to neural adaptation. This stabilization is often interrupted by floaters, especially when they tend to remain visible.|$|E

40|$|Dopamine is {{generally}} {{accepted as a}} major neurotransmitter associated with light-adaptive processes in the retina. However, {{little is known about}} its precise release pattern in vivo, largely {{due to the lack of}} an unambiguous method for the determination of dopamine release. We have found that vitreal levels of dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) reflect the rate of dopamine release in chickens. Blocking re-uptake with nomifensine significantly lowered vitreal DOPAC and retinal dopamine, confirming the retinal origin and reliance of vitreal DOPAC on intact re-uptake mechanisms. Further, inhibition of monoamine oxidase with pargyline reduced vitreal as well as retinal DOPAC levels, confirming that the DOPAC detected is generated by monoamine oxidase. Finally, we found that DOPAC diffused freely into and out of isolated <b>vitreous</b> <b>bodies</b> and we found the vitreous to be metabolically inert with respect to DOPAC, supporting the idea that vitreal levels of DOPAC are consequential to the retinal metabolism of dopamine. Exposure to light, which is known to increase retinal dopamine release, readily increased vitreal DOPAC levels. The accumulation of DOPAC in the vitreous over 6 h light fitted a mathematical model of DOPAC accumulation based on zero-order influx (proportional to dopamine release rates) and diffusion driven, first-order efflux. ...|$|R
40|$|Spectral {{measurements}} of sunlight {{throughout the day}} show close correspondence between the timing of above ground activity of the European ground squirrel {{and the presence of}} ultraviolet light in the solar spectrum. However, in a standard entrainment experiment ground squirrels show no entrainment to ultraviolet light, while Syrian hamsters do entrain under the same protocol. Presented transmittance spectra for lenses, corneas, and <b>vitreous</b> <b>bodies</b> may explain the different results of the entrainment experiment. We found ultraviolet light transmittance in the colourless hamster lens (50 % cut-off at 341 nm), but not in the yellow ground squirrel lens (50 % cut-off around 493 nm). Ultraviolet sensitivity in the ground squirrels based upon possible fluorescence mechanisms was not evident. Possible functions of ultraviolet lens filters in diurnal mammals are discussed and compared with nocturnal mammals and diurnal birds. Species of the latter two groups lack ultraviolet filtering properties of their lenses and their circadian system is known to respond to ultraviolet light, a feature that does not necessarily has to depend on ultraviolet photoreceptors. Although the circadian system of several species responds to ultraviolet light, we argue that the role of ultraviolet light as a natural Zeitgeber is probably limited. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIt {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that vitreous humor-derived FGFs {{are required for}} the differentiation of anterior lens epithelial cells into crystallin-rich fibers. We show that BMP 2, 4, and 7 can induce the expression of markers of fiber differentiation in primary lens cell cultures to an extent equivalent to FGF or medium conditioned by intact <b>vitreous</b> <b>bodies</b> (VBCM). Abolishing BMP 2 / 4 / 7 signaling with noggin inhibited VBCM from upregulating fiber marker expression. Remarkably, noggin and anti-BMP antibodies also prevented purified FGF (but not unrelated stimuli) from upregulating the same fiber-specific proteins. This effect is attributable to inhibition of BMPs produced by the lens cells themselves. Although BMP signaling is required for FGF to enhance fiber differentiation, the converse is not true. Expression of noggin in the lenses of transgenic mice resulted in a postnatal block of epithelial-to-secondary fiber differentiation, with extension of the epithelial monolayer to the posterior pole of the organ. These results reveal the central importance of BMP in secondary fiber formation and show that although FGF may be necessary for this process, it is not sufficient. Differentiation of fiber cells, and thus proper vision, is dependent on cross-talk between the FGF and BMP signaling pathways...|$|R

MethodsA total of 12 New Zealand white rabbits, either sex, weighing 2. 5 – 3. 5 kg, and provided by the Experimental Animal Center of Henan Province were employed in this study. For each rabbit, 5 autologous eyelashes (1 cm in length and 0. 2 – 0. 3 mm in diameter) were implanted into the right ocular vitreum, while the left control ocular vitreum received sham operation but nothing was implanted. SWI sequential test was made 2 hours postoperatively. Then the rabbits were killed and the specimens of the <b>vitreous</b> <b>bodies</b> of the rabbits were obtained. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and histological examinations were performed. ResultsThe autologous eyelashes in 8 ocular vitreums of rabbits showed linear low signal intensity on the magnitude images and susceptibility weighted images, but linear high signal intensity on the phase images. Among the 12 experimental rabbits, 5 eyelashes in the right vitreum were completely shown in 3 rabbits, partly shown in 5 rabbits (2 eyelashes shown in 3 rabbits and 3 eyelashes shown in 2 rabbits), and not shown in 4 rabbits. ConclusionSWI of the foreign body of intravitreous autologous eyelashes in rabbits has its own characteristics.

The concepti of ICR mice on day 8. 5 of gestation were injected with MCMV through the uterine wall, then pregnancies {{were allowed to}} continue. On day 15. 5 of gestation, microphthalmia was observed in 19. 2 % of the MCMV-injected embryos (1 x 10 (4) plaque-forming units). As the survival rate decreased when pregnancies were allowed to continue further, incidence of microphthalmia decreased, whereas cerebral atrophies, determined by examining the histological sections, were observed in 17. 6 % of the surviving mouse fetuses on day 18. 5 of gestation. Microphthalmia was confirmed by microscopically measuring the eyes on the serial coronal sections. There were two types of microphthalmia: one with marked hypoplastic eye with periglobular mesenchymal proliferation, the other with small eye and lens without the mesenchymal proliferation. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed using antibodies specific to the nuclear antigen of MCMV. Viral antigen-positive cells were widely distributed in the mesenchymes around the oral and nasal cavities and in the mesenchymes around the brain, especially in the endothelial cells of the vessels and the perivascular mesodermal cells. In the eyes, viral antigen-positive cells were observed in mononuclear blood cells in the cavities of the <b>vitreous</b> <b>bodies.</b> These {{results suggest that the}} primary target of congenital cytomegalovirus infection may be the mesenchymal cells; then the infection extends to the eyes and brain.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{reestablish}} the immunosuppressive microenvironment of the eye, {{disrupted by}} ocular inflammation during endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU), {{by means of}} intravitreal injection of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) in saline or encapsulated in liposomes, to increase its bioavailability and efficiency. METHODS: EIU was induced in Lewis rats by subcutaneous injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Simultaneously, animals were intravitreally injected with saline, saline/VIP, VIP-loaded liposomes (VIP-Lip), or unloaded liposomes. EIU severity and cellular infiltration were assessed by clinical examination and specific immunostaining. VIP concentration was determined in ocular fluids by ELISA. Ocular expression of inflammatory cytokine and chemokine mRNAs was detected by semiquantitative RT-PCR. Biodistribution of rhodamine-conjugated liposomes (Rh-Lip) was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in eyes and regional cervical lymph nodes (LNs). RESULTS: Twenty-four hours after intravitreal injection of VIP-Lip, VIP concentration in ocular fluids was 15 times higher than after saline/VIP injection. At that time, EIU clinical severity, ocular infiltrating polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), and, to a lesser extent, ED 1 (+) macrophages, as well as inflammatory cytokine and chemokine mRNA expression, were significantly reduced in VIP-Lip-injected rats compared with rats injected with saline/VIP, unloaded liposomes, or saline. Rh-Lip was distributed in <b>vitreous,</b> ciliary <b>body,</b> conjunctiva, retina, and sclera. It was internalized by macrophages and PMNs, and VIP colocalized with liposomes at least up to 14 days after injection. In cervical LNs, resident macrophages internalized VIP-Rh-Lip, and some adjacent lymphocytes showed VIP expression. CONCLUSIONS: VIP was efficient at reducing EIU only when formulated in liposomes, which enhanced its immunosuppressive effect and controlled its delivery to all tissues affected by or involved in ocular inflammation...|$|R
