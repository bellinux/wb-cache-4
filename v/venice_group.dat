50|$|Venetian dialects are {{classified}} as a Western Romance language. Scholars distinguish between an Eastern or Coastal (<b>Venice)</b> <b>group,</b> a Central (Padua, Vicenza, Polesine) group, a Western (Verona) group, a North-Central (Treviso) group, and a Northern (Belluno, Feltre, Agordo, Cadore, Zoldo Alto) group of dialects. All dialects are mutually intelligible to varying degrees. Venetian is descended from Vulgar Latin and influenced by the Italian language. Venetian is attested as a written language in the 13th century.|$|E

5000|$|Mark Galanty {{assembled}} {{a committee of}} the VCA to locate a compromise design and material. Loffelstein, or Loffel Block, was identified by a VCA committee member Andy Shores as possibly meeting those goals. It allowed plants to grow inside the material, could be placed on a slope to allow birds and wildlife {{to climb out of}} the canals, was safe for small children as it allowed them {{to hold on to the}} sides, and or climb out of the Canals, was lower cost project over the Armorflex design, and was aesthetically pleasing to the property owners. Mark Galanty recruited canal resident architects to create a design board with the Loffel Block material, and Galanty publicly presented the Loffel design Plan at a public meeting with Councilwoman Galanter in attendance. Galanter stated she would be open to the Venice Canals Association design material. Mark Galanty got the Loffel Block distributor in Orange County to install a test site across from the Armorflex test site at the distributors cost. The test was successful with plants growing in the blocks, wildlife and ducks able to climb up the material, and the majority of the property owners supporting this design. Galanter agreed to have city engineers design an official city plan using the Loffel Block. Luis Ganajas revised the plans to include the material Loffel Block at 55 degree slop. VCA members Robert Trask and Mark Galanty took the city design, an actual Loffel Block, and the community support poll showing overwhelming support to different <b>Venice</b> <b>groups,</b> city government agencies, state agencies, environmental groups, historical groups, and each property owner on the canals getting support for what was termed [...] "The Compromise Plan". Eventually, letters of support for the Loffel plan were presented to the city from the Sierra Club, Heal the Bay, the local state senator and state assemblyman, both U.S. senators, and the local county supervisor. Based on the support of the Loffel Block design over the Armorflex design, Councilwoman Galanter had Public Works drop the Armorflex plan and focusd on the Loffel Block plan.|$|R

50|$|The group {{extended}} its antiwar protests and {{protests against the}} illing of student protesters by the Police at Jackson, Augusta, and Kent by calling for a boycott of the American Pavilion at the 1970 <b>Venice</b> Biennale. The <b>group</b> organized a counter-biennial in New York. This was then criticized by the Women Students and Artists for Black Art Liberation (WSABAL) directed by Faith Ringgold and joined by Michele Wallace, which led to it opening up to women and people of color. The WSABAL group also influenced the Ad Hoc Women Artists, conducted by Lucy Lippard. These two groups both had a demand of 50 percent women artist representation. Their protests led to the inclusion of black women artists Barbara Chase Riboud and Bettye Saar in the next Whitney Biennial.|$|R
5000|$|During the 16th century, Venice {{became one}} of the most {{important}} musical centers of Europe, marked by a characteristic style of composition (the Venetian school) and the development of the Venetian polychoral style under composers such as Adrian Willaert, who worked at St Mark's Basilica. Venice was the early center of music printing; Ottaviano Petrucci began publishing music almost as soon as this technology was available, and his publishing enterprise helped to attract composers from all over Europe, especially from France and Flanders. By the end of the century, Venice was known for the splendor of its music, as exemplified in the [...] "colossal style" [...] of Andrea and Giovanni Gabrieli, which used multiple choruses and instrumental <b>groups.</b> <b>Venice</b> was also the home of many noted composers during the baroque period, such as Antonio Vivaldi, Ippolito Ciera, Giovanni Picchi, and Girolamo Dalla Casa, to name but a few.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of TRANSALP is {{the investigation of}} the deep structure and dynamic evolution of the Eastern Alps. The core of the project is formed by a 340 km long reflection and refraction seismic profile between Munich and <b>Venice</b> (TRANSALP Working <b>Group</b> 2001, 2002). This paper deals with the p-wave velocity distribution derived from the wide-angle observations and the implications on crustal structure. PREVIOUS INVESTIGATIONS So far, the state of knowledge was based essentially on refraction seismic measurements from the 1970 s, which were characterized by large shot spacing and huge charges. This data provided low resolution but great depth penetration. Early models (Fig. 1) were dominated by layered structures – not least for the sake of simplicity – and interpreted in the context of isostatic concepts of crustal reequilibration. In the 1980 s, reflection seismic data was gathered on a series of short profiles in the Central Alps by the Swiss NRP 20 project (Pfiffner, 1997). These non-contiguous sections were assembled to a pseudo cross-section in which, amongst other patterns, pronounced lower-crustal reflectors were observed dipping towards the Alpine root, implying a more geodynamic interpretation as images of syncollisional structures. These results inspired efforts to reinterpret the data from the Eastern Alps. New models were developed that reflect such structures but it was impossible to distinguish between these and the older models based on the data at that time. One of the targets of TRANSALP was the verification of these models...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{investigation}} into the world of sixteenth-century <b>Venice,</b> encompassing a <b>group</b> of female portraits by artist Palma Vecchio. I utilized many primary and secondary sources concerning Renaissance society, including several which discussed the roles of women during the Renaissance. This thesis is divided into four chapters that discuss the purpose and evolution of the female portrait, ideal poetic beauty, and the authority the courtesan carried in both the poetry and the painting in Venice. Chapter one covers a short history of the portrait as well as an investigation of how the female portrait evolved from the profile image to the frontal three-quarter image. It also discusses how Palma Vecchio would have adhered to the early concepts of the portrait, yet came to depict women in an idealized fashion that came to be the Renaissance Venetian artist 2 ̆ 7 s specialty. Chapter two explores the issue of poetic beauty upon the paintings of Palma Vecchio and its birth from the Humanist movement, as started by the fourteenth-century poet Petrarch. Chapter three discusses the role of the courtesan predominantly in Venice. An educated and sophisticated woman who sold sexual favors, performed a considerable role {{in the world of the}} female portrait in Venice, particularly the images by Palma Vecchio. Chapter four, the conclusion, concretizes the issues of ideal poetic feminine beauty, the courtesan in female portraiture, and how these two factors carried an enormous role not only in the female portraits of Palma Vecchio, but in the social fabric of Venice...|$|R
2500|$|Henry Moore emerged after World War II as Britain's leading sculptor, {{promoted}} alongside Victor Pasmore, William Scott and Barbara Hepworth by the Festival of Britain. [...] The [...] "London School" [...] of figurative painters including Francis Bacon, Lucian Freud, Frank Auerbach, Leon Kossoff, and Michael Andrews {{have received}} widespread international recognition, while other painters such as John Minton and John Craxton are characterized as Neo-Romantics. Graham Sutherland, the Romantic landscapist John Piper (a prolific and popular lithographer), the sculptor Elisabeth Frink, {{and the industrial}} townscapes of L.S. Lowry {{also contributed to the}} strong figurative presence in post-war British art. According to William Grimes of the New York Times [...] "Lucien Freud and his contemporaries transformed figure painting in the 20th century. In paintings like Girl With a White Dog (1951-52), Freud put the pictorial language of traditional European painting in the service of an anti-romantic, confrontational style of portraiture that stripped bare the sitter’s social facade. Ordinary people — many of them his friends — stared wide-eyed from the canvas, vulnerable to the artist’s ruthless inspection." [...] In 1952 at the 26th <b>Venice</b> Biennale a <b>group</b> of young British sculptors including Kenneth Armitage, Reg Butler, Lynn Chadwick, William Turnbull and Eduardo Paolozzi, exhibited works that demonstrated anti-monumental, expressionism. Scottish painter Alan Davie created a large body of abstract paintings during the 1950s that synthesize and reflect his interest in mythology and zen. Abstract art became prominent during the 1950s with Ben Nicholson, Terry Frost, Peter Lanyon and Patrick Heron, who were part of the St Ives school in Cornwall. In 1958, along with Kenneth Armitage and William Hayter, William Scott was chosen by the British Council for the British Pavilion at the XXIX Venice Biennale.|$|R
