25|$|The South {{has become}} solidly Republican in {{national}} elections since 1980, {{and has been}} trending Republican {{at the state level}} since then at a slower pace. In 2004, Bush led Kerry by 70%–30% among Southern whites, who made up 71% of the Southern electorate. Kerry had a 70–30 lead among the 29% of the voters who were black or Hispanic. One-third of these Southern voters said they were white evangelicals; they <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>Bush</b> by 80–20; but were only 72% Republican in 2006.|$|E

In 2008. Barack Obama carried Florida, North Carolina and Virginia, but in 2010 the GOP regained their losses. Since the Reagan administration, U.S. presidential {{elections}} have been close. However, the Republican presidential candidate won {{a majority of the}} popular vote only in 2004, while coming in second in 1992, 1996, 2000, 2008, 2012 and 2016.|$|E

25|$|Religion {{has always}} {{played a major}} role for both parties, but {{in the course of a}} century, the parties' {{religious}} compositions have changed. Religion was a major dividing line between the parties before 1960, with Catholics, Jews, and Southern Protestants heavily Democratic, and Northeastern Protestants heavily Republican. Most of the old differences faded away after the realignment of the 1970s and 80s that undercut the New Deal coalition. Voters who attend church weekly gave 61% of their votes to Bush in 2004; those who attend occasionally gave him only 47%, while those who never attend gave him 36%. Fifty-nine percent of Protestants <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>Bush,</b> along with 52% of Catholics (even though John Kerry was Catholic). Since 1980, large majorities of evangelicals have voted Republican; 70–80% <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>Bush</b> in 2000 and 2004, and 70% for Republican House candidates in 2006. Jews continue to vote 70–80% Democratic. Democrats have close links with the African American churches, especially the National Baptists, while their historic dominance among Catholic voters has eroded to 54–46 in the 2010 midterms. The main line traditional Protestants (Methodists, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Episcopalians, Disciples) have dropped to about 55% Republican (in contrast to 75% before 1968). The mainline denominations are rapidly shrinking in size. Mormons in Utah and neighboring states voted 75% or more for Bush in 2000.|$|E
500|$|McCain did join Bush for a {{few days}} of {{appearances}} in late October, emphasizing, {{in the wake of the}} October 12 USS Cole bombing, his belief that Bush was a better choice than Democratic Party nominee Al Gore to deal with international security threats. [...] Bush aide Scott McClellan later described the joint appearances by saying, [...] "The tension was palpable. The two were cordial, but McCain would get that forced smile on his face whenever they were together." [...] McCain also campaigned for about forty Republican House of Representatives candidates, and was credited by National Republican Congressional Committee chair Tom Davis with keeping the House in Republican hands. [...] McCain would state that he <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>Bush</b> on November 7 (although years later several witnesses would relate that McCain and his wife Cindy had both said at a dinner party that they had not). [...] When the November presidential election continued on in indecision during the Florida election dispute, McCain stayed generally quiet in an atmosphere of extreme partisanship, though he did appear on CBS' Face the Nation to say, [...] "I think the nation is growing a little weary of this. [...] We're not in a constitutional crisis, but the American people are growing weary, and whoever wins is having a rapidly diminishing mandate, to say the least." [...] Once Bush was declared the winner and inaugurated in January 2001, McCain's battles with him would resume, with a significant amount of lingering bitterness between the two men and their staffs over what had transpired during the course of 2000.|$|E

2500|$|In the 2000 presidential {{election}} in Florida, George W. Bush defeated Al Gore by 537 votes. Nader received [...] votes, which led to claims that {{he was responsible for}} Gore's defeat. Nader, both in his book Crashing the Party and on his website, states: [...] "In the year 2000, exit polls reported that 25% of my voters would have <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>Bush,</b> 38% would have voted for Gore and the rest would not have voted at all." [...] Michael Moore at first argued that Florida was so close that votes for any of seven other candidates could also have switched the results, but in 2004 joined the view that Nader had helped make Bush president. When asked about claims of being a spoiler, Nader typically points to the controversial Supreme Court ruling that halted a Florida recount, Gore's loss {{in his home state of}} Tennessee, and the [...] "quarter million Democrats who <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>Bush</b> in Florida." ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 2004, Morris {{directed}} another {{series of}} commercials {{in the style}} of the [...] "Switch" [...] ads.

Morris also wrote an editorial for The New York Times discussing the commercials and Kerry's losing campaign.|$|E
2500|$|Connally {{said that}} he and Bush despised each other. The {{statement}} seemed to contradict [...] Connally's earlier insistence that President Nixon name Bush to a post in the administration as a pre-condition for Connally's agreeing to become treasury secretary. Rumors also abounded in 1964 that Connally personally <b>voted</b> <b>for</b> <b>Bush</b> for senator because of his greater dislike for Bush's then-opponent, Senator Ralph Yarborough. Bad feeling between Yarborough and both Connally and Vice-President Johnson was evident {{in the early stages of}} President Kennedy's tour of Texas in November 1963. Among other things, it was widely reported at the time that Yarborough had refused to travel in Johnson's car, although, after Kennedy's intervention and Connally's agreement to give Yarborough a more prominent role in functions planned for Austin, he did so during the fatal motorcade in Dallas. Charles Keating once contributed to Connally's campaign for President.|$|E
