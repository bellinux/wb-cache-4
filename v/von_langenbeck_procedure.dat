40|$|INTRODUCTION: Our aim was {{to compare}} the dentoalveolar {{development}} in beagle dogs after palatal repair according to the Von Langenbeck technique with and without implantation of a dermal substitute. METHODS: Nineteen beagles (age, 12 weeks) were assigned to 2 experimental groups and an untreated control group. Palatal surgery was performed with the Von Langenbeck technique in the 2 experimental groups. The dermal substitute Integra (Plainsboro, NJ, USA) was implanted in 1 experimental group, and the other served as sham group. Dental casts were made before surgery and at several times in all groups to measure dentoalveolar development. Transversal distances, arch depth, tipping, and rotation were determined. Histologic evaluations were performed at 3, 7, and 15 weeks after surgery. The degrees of reepithelialization and tissue organization were evaluated microscopically. RESULTS: All wounds healed without complications. Scar tissue attached to the bone was found in both experimental groups. Deposition of bone in the Integra occurred after implantation, indicating its osteoconductivity. Transversal dentoalveolar development was similar in both experimental groups, but it was significantly less than in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Implantation of Integra after the <b>Von</b> <b>Langenbeck</b> <b>procedure</b> for palatal repair does not improve dentoalveolar development...|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{prospective}} randomized {{clinical trial}} was to compare 2 cohorts of standardized cleft patients with regard to functional speech outcome and {{the presence or absence}} of palatal fistulae. The 2 cohorts are randomized to undergo either a conventional von Langenbeck repair with intravelar velarplasty or the double-opposing Z-plasty Furlow procedure. A prospective 2 x 2 x 2 factorial clinical trial was used in which each subject was randomly assigned to 1 of 8 different groups: 1 of 2 different lip repairs (Spina vs. Millard), 1 of 2 different palatal repair (von Langenbeck vs. Furlow), and 1 of 2 different ages at time of palatal surgery (9 - 12 months vs. 15 - 18 months). All surgeries were performed by the same 4 surgeons. A cul-de-sac test of hypernasality and a mirror test of nasal air emission were selected as primary outcome measures for velopharyngeal function. Both a surgeon and speech pathologist examined patients for the presence of palatal fistulae. In this study, the Furlow double-opposing Z-palatoplasty resulted in significantly better velopharyngeal function for speech than the <b>von</b> <b>Langenbeck</b> <b>procedure</b> as determined by the perceptual cul-de-sac test of hypernasality. Fistula occurrence was significantly higher for the Furlow procedure than for the von Langenbeck. Fistulas were more likely to occur in patients with wider clefts and when relaxing incisions were not used. NIH/NIDCR[R 01 -DE 10437...|$|E
40|$|We {{compared}} facial {{growth in}} patients with bilateral complete cleft lip and palate (BCLP) in whom the palate had been repaired by the <b>von</b> <b>Langenbeck</b> <b>procedure</b> {{at the age of}} 14 months (L- 14), or by the Wardill procedure at 18 months (W- 18). A total of 151 unaffected subjects were used as a reference group. Thirty-six adult patients, 26 in the L- 14 group, and 10 in the W- 18 group, were investigated clinically and with lateral skull radiography, and they also filled out a questionnaire about their dental condition. Multiple linear regression was used to analyse the effect of surgical strategy, sex, and the presence of a velopharyngeal flap on several dependent variables indicating sagittal and vertical jaw relations, and inclination of incisors. The BCLP group was characterised by a pre-normal basal relation (ss-n-sm), retroclined upper (ILs/NL) and lower (ILi/ML) incisors, maxillary retrognathism (s-n-ss) in men, larger maxillary plane angle (NSL/NL) in women, larger mandibular plane (NSL/ML) and intermaxillary vertical relation (NL/ML) in men, and smaller anterior facial height (n-gn) and upper anterior facial height (n-sp). In the BCLP group, differences in outcomes could be explained only by sex. The sagittal jaw base relation (ss-n-sm) was significantly smaller in men than in women, whereas the total anterior facial height (n-gn) was greater in men. Lateral crossbite was found in about 75 % of patients. About 70 % were satisfied with their dental condition. The choice of surgical strategy had no significant influence on the variables measured on facial morphology...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare facial growth in {{patients}} with unilateral complete cleft lip and palate (UCLP) in whom the palate was repaired with the <b>von</b> <b>Langenbeck</b> <b>procedure</b> at 8 months (L- 8), or the Wardill procedure at 18 months (W- 18). A total of 151 unaffected subjects were used as a reference series. Sixty-one adult patients, 34 in the L- 8 group and 27 in the W- 18 group, were investigated clinically and with lateral skull radiography and also filled out a questionnaire about their dental condition. Multiple linear regression was used to analyse the effects of the surgical strategy, sex, and the presence of a velopharyngeal flap on several dependent variables indicating sagittal jaw relations, vertical jaw relations, and inclination of incisors. The UCLP group was characterised by a short (n-sp) and retrusive maxilla (s-n-ss) and a retrusive mandible for women (s-n-sm), larger maxillary inclination (NSL/NL), more retroclined lower incisors (IL(I) /ML), shorter upper facial heights (n-sp) and normal total face height (n-gn) than the reference group. In the UCLP group there were significant differences between men and women in mandibular prognathism (s-n-sm), maxillary/mandibular relations (ss-n-sm), maxillary inclination (NSL/NL), total anterior facial height (n-gn), and upper anterior facial height (n-sp). Lateral crossbite was found in 20 % of the UCLP group. The prevalence was similar in the L- 8 and W- 18 groups. Almost 80 % of the patients in the UCLP group considered that their dental condition was good.

40|$|Information {{about the}} {{prevalence}} of consonant production errors, including compensatory articulations (CA), in individuals with cleft lip and palate (CLP) who speak Brazilian Portuguese is limited, particularly regarding liquid sounds. The literature primarily reports the occurrence of CA for plosive and fricative sounds, since occurrence of CAs in sounds that require higher amounts of oral air pressure is expected. While the use of CA during liquid sound production is not expected, clinical experience suggests that individuals with CLP present with inadequate backing, elevation, and anteriorization of the tongue as well as tongue clicks during production of /r/ and /l/. Objectives: Describe the occurrence of consonant error productions during liquid sounds for children with CLP; compare the occurrence between children operated with the Furlow and von Langenbeck techniques for palatoplasty; and compare the occurrence between children operated between 9 - 12 months and 15 - 18 months of age at primary palatoplasty. Material and Methods: A sample of 397 children (237 males and 160 females) with operated unilateral CLP was studied. In this group, 163 underwent palatoplasty with the Furlow procedure and 234 with the modified <b>von</b> <b>Langenbeck</b> <b>procedure.</b> Age at palatoplasty was between 9 and 12 months for 189 children and between 15 and 18 months for 208 children. Data about production of /l/, /r/, /R/, /&# 955;/ and consonant clusters /l/ and /r/ were obtained from speech pathology records. Speech pathologists registered the speech findings after an auditory-perceptual evaluation of the participants at the sixth year of age. Results: The use of middorsum palatal place (MDP) of production was identified for 2 % of the sample. Tongue anteriorization of the /l/ production was observed for 55 % of the children. No {{significant difference was found}} related to surgical technique, but children operated earlier developed the use of the consonant cluster /r/ sooner than children operated later (p= 0. 040). Conclusion: We found a low occurrence of use of cleft related CA during attempts of production of liquid phonemes, and the variable age at primary palatoplasty significantly interfered with the acquisition of consonant cluster /r/...|$|E
40|$|The Furlow {{cleft palate}} repair using a double {{opposing}} Z-plasty {{appears to be}} very promising. In order to detect advantages and disadvantages concerning the technique as well as speech- and hearing results, the Furlow palatoplasty was compared with the classical <b>von</b> <b>Langenbeck</b> technique. Data analysis from 10 children in both groups revealed that the Furlow technique proved to be superior to the <b>von</b> <b>Langenbeck</b> technique as far as speech sound is concerned: at {{a mean age of}} 3. 5 years, nasality and nasal escape were absent in almost all cases. However, {{there were no significant differences}} between the techniques in respect of articulatory skills, language comprehension, language production as well as hearing. Technically, the Furlow technique is more difficult to perform, particularly in wide clefts...|$|R

40|$|The {{treatment}} of facial paralysis {{is generally considered}} to have been nonsurgical {{until the end of}} the nineteenth century. However, the authors discovered recently that already in the 1840 s the celebrated German facial reconstructive surgeons Dieffenbach and <b>von</b> <b>Langenbeck</b> applied the technique of subcutaneous myotomy to healthy facial muscles to reestablish balance in the chronically paralyzed faces of their patients. They performed their operations at a time when anesthesia, asepsis, antisepsis, and antibiotics had not yet been introduced into surgery. It is concluded that Dieffenbach and <b>von</b> <b>Langenbeck</b> were the first, in recorded history, to develop a surgical way to treat irreversible facial paralysis. As their principles are still being used in surgical practice, they cannot be regarded as antiquated, which illustrates the difficulties that reconstructive surgeons still experience in the {{treatment of}} irreversible facial paralysis...|$|R

40|$|Sixty-six {{patients}} {{operated on}} for isolated cleft palate were evaluated as adults, and their speech was assessed clinically. Forty-four {{had undergone a}} <b>von</b> <b>Langenbeck</b> repair {{at the age of}} 7 months and 22 a Wardill repair at the age of 18 months. Speech was judged subjectively by the patients themselves, and perceptual assessment was made by three speech pathologists. The remaining speech problems, mainly hypernasality, were moderate or severe in 7 (16 %) of the patients in the <b>von</b> <b>Langenbeck</b> group, and in 7 (32 %) in the Wardill group. On the other hand, the patients in the Wardill group had fewer fistulas closed, and fewer velopharyngoplasties. There {{were no significant differences between}} the two methods regarding speech in adulthood. The Wardill method produced significantly more scar tissue clinically, which carries the potential risk of inhibition of facial growth. The present speech results will therefore be weighed against the outcome of maxillofacial growth for these patients...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{management}} of lower eyelid reconstruction has {{a variety of}} treatment strategies with varying success depending on the patient. We tried to apply the most suitable reconstruction techniques for this particular case. Methods: We report a case of a 99 -year-old woman, with a vision loss of 70 % in the left eye and 40 % in the right eye, who underwent basal cell carcinoma resection of the lower right eyelid 3 months before. The margins of resection and the deepest layers were affected. After the histopathology report, we decided to plan a more aggressive treatment with a total resection of the lower right eyelid. We had a case with 3 added difficulties: the old age of the patient, the vision loss in the contralateral eye, {{and the size of the}} resection. Results: On the basis of our experience and the bibliography reviewed, we decided to use the chondromucosal nasal flap for the posterior lamella reconstruction and the transposition flap of <b>von</b> <b>Langenbeck</b> for the anterior lamella.
