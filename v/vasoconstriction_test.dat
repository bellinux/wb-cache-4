Under conditions that predispose to maximal percutaneous absorption clobetasone butyrate ointment had minimal effect on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function.

40|$|AbstractWe characterised {{biological}} {{properties of}} novel formulations of two low-potency glucocorticosteroids, dexamethasone and hydrocortisone, which have an equivalent dose ratio of 1 : 50 in <b>vasoconstriction</b> <b>tests.</b> The rate of such carrier-mediated, mainly non-diffusive glucocorticosteroids transport with very deformable lipid vesicles (Transfersomes®) through the skin, {{and the corresponding}} cutaneous drug biodistribution data, were complemented with the drug bio-efficacy studies. The minimum effective drug dose that reduces arachidonic acid-induced murine ear oedema by 50 % was used as one bioactivity indicator. The minimum drug amount ensuring such an effect in mouse skin decreases appreciably when a corticosteroid is applied epicutaneously with very deformable vesicles rather than a lotion or a crème. Specifically, the minimum effective dose for hydrocortisone in very deformable carriers is 2 – 3 μg cm− 2 whereas for the crème- or lotion-like preparations at least 10 μg cm− 2 is required. Such three- to fivefold relative increase of hydrocortisone potency is accompanied by at least 13 %, and more often > 20 %, absolute drug potency enhancement. The delivery of hydrocortisone with very deformable carriers moreover prolongs {{the suppression of the}} drug-induced oedema nearly 2 -fold (to ∼ 24 h per application). The effective dose of dexamethasone delivered with very deformable vesicles into murine skin is reduced > 10 times compared with the crème- or lotion-based products. Specifically, less than 0. 1 μg cm− 2 dexamethasone in very deformable vesicles suppresses the arachidonic acid-induced murine ear oedema > 50 %, on the average. Dexamethasone use on the skin in such vesicles extends the duration of drug action fourfold, compared with a commercial crème, i. e. to > 48 h per application. Epicutaneous use of glucocorticosteroids in very deformable vesicles also diminishes such drug's abrasion sensitivity and may increase the general robustness of drug effect. Lower frequency of skin treatment, which ensures adequate biological response, is a result of this. Topical corticosteroid delivery with very deformable vesicles, Transfersomes®, thus improves the therapeutic risk–benefit ratio, arguably due to better targeting into and longer drug presence in the skin...|$|R
40|$|Diverse {{lines of}} {{evidence}} {{point to a}} basic human aversion to physically harming others. First, we demonstrate that unwillingness to endorse harm in a moral dilemma is predicted by individual differences in aversive reactivity, as indexed by peripheral <b>vasoconstriction.</b> Next, we <b>tested</b> the specific factors that elicit the aversive response to harm. Participants performed actions such as discharging a fake gun {{into the face of}} the experimenter, fully informed that the actions were pretend and harmless. These simulated harmful actions increased peripheral vasoconstriction significantly more than did witnessing pretend harmful actions or to performing metabolically matched nonharmful actions. This suggests that the aversion to harmful actions extends beyond empathic concern for victim harm.

25|$|Furthermore, when warranted, {{specific}} tests—the mirror <b>test,</b> <b>vasoconstriction</b> examinations, and the Cottle maneuver—are {{included to}} the pre-operative {{evaluation of the}} prospective rhinoplasty patient. Established by Maurice H. Cottle (1898–1981), the Cottle maneuver is a principal diagnostic technique for detecting an internal nasal-valve disorder; whilst the patient gently inspires, the surgeon laterally pulls the patient's cheek, thereby simulating the widening of the cross-sectional area of the corresponding internal nasal valve. If the maneuver notably facilitates the patient's inspiration, that result is a positive Cottle sign—which generally indicates an airflow-correction to be surgically effected with an installed spreader-graft. Said correction will improve the internal angle of the nasal valve and thus allow unobstructed breathing. Nonetheless, the Cottle maneuver occasionally yields a false-positive Cottle sign, usually observed in the patient afflicted with alar collapse, and in the patient with a scarred nasal-valve region.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Low dietary sodium intake {{increases}} {{central nervous}} system angiotensin activity, which increases basal renal sympathetic nerve activity and shifts its arterial baroreflex control {{to a higher level}} of arterial pressure. This results in a higher level of renal sympathetic nerve activity for a given level of arterial pressure during low dietary sodium intake than during either normal or high dietary sodium intake, in which there is less central angiotensin activity. Peripheral thermal receptor stimulation overrides arterial baroreflex control and produces a pressor response, tachycardia, increased renal sympathetic nerve activity, and renal <b>vasoconstriction.</b> To <b>test</b> the hypothesis that increased central angiotensin activity would enhance the responses to peripheral thermal receptor stimulation, anesthetized normal rats in balance on low, normal, and high dietary sodium intake were subjected to acute peripheral thermal receptor stimulation. Low sodium rats had greater increases in renal sympathetic nerve activity, greater decreases in RBF, and greater increases in renal vascular resistance than high sodium rats. Responses of normal sodium rats were between those of low and high sodium rats. Arterial pressure and heart rate responses were not different among dietary groups. Spontaneously hypertensive rats, known to have increased {{central nervous system}} angiotensin activity, also had greater renal sympathoexcitatory and vasoconstrictor responses than normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats. These results support the view that increased central nervous system angiotensin activity alters arterial baroreflex control of renal sympathetic nerve activity such that the renal sympathoexcitatory and vasoconstrictor responses to peripheral thermoreceptor stimulatio...|$|R

Design: Prospective, noninterventional study. Patients: Normotensive patients with suspected PE (n= 87) who underwent CT pulmonary angiography and transthoracic Doppler-echocardiography. Measurements: Significant TR {{was defined as a}} jet velocity > 2. 7 m/s. Leukocyte expression of hmox- 1, haptoglobin, haptoglobin related gene, the haptoglobin receptor, CD 163 and cox- 2 genes were assessed by quantitative rtPCR, and the hmox- 1 promoter was examined for the − 413 A→T SNP and GT repeat polymorphisms. Results: Of the 44 (50 %) with PE+, 22 had TR+, and their mean pulmonary vascular occlusion (39 ± 32 %) did not differ significantly from patients who were TR− (28 ± 26 %, P= 0. 15). Patients with PE+ and TR+ had significantly lower expression of hmox- 1 and haptoglobin genes than patients without PE+ and no TR. Expression of hmox- 1 varied inversely with TR velocity (r 2 = 0. 45, P< 0. 001) for PE+ (n= 22) but not patients without PE. Hmox- 1 expression did not vary significantly with genotype. Cox- 2 did not differ between groups and had no correlation with TR.

In isolated guinea-pig atria, Vo. Cr equally inhibited force and rate of spontaneous atrial contractions. On the baseline of rat thoracic aortae (endothelium-intact and denuded), the plant extract caused phentolamine-sensitive <b>vasoconstriction.</b> When <b>tested</b> on phenylephrine (PE, 1 μM) and K + (80 mM) -induced vasoconstriction, Vo. Cr caused a concentration-dependent relaxation and also caused a rightward shift of Ca ++ concentration-response curves as well as suppression of PE (1 μM) control peaks in Ca ++ -free medium, similar to that caused by verapamil. In the presence of L-NAME, the relaxation curve of Vo. Cr was partially inhibited showing involvement of Nitric oxide (NO) mediated pathway. In Tyloxapol-induced dyslipidemia, Vo. Cr caused reduction in total cholesterol and triglyceride levels. In high-fat diet-induced dyslipidemia model, the plant extract caused {{a significant decrease in}} total cholesterol, LDL-C, atherogenic index and prevented the increase in average body weights, while it increased HDL-C. Conclusions These data indicate that the vasodilator effect of the plant extract is mediated through multiple pathways like inhibition of Ca ++ influx via membranous Ca ++ channels, its release from intracellular stores and NO-mediated pathways, which possibly explain the fall in BP.

40|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that the potent constrictor peptide, endothelin (ET) has a mediating role in cyclosporine A (CsA) -related renal vasoconstriction. However, the nature of the CsA-ET interaction and effect on the renal vasculature is uncertain. The {{purpose of the present study}} was twofold: (a) to determine if CsA exposure caused direct local release of ET from the endothelium of the renal microvasculature and (b) to determine if locally generated ET has paracrine effects on the underlying vascular smooth muscle to induce vasoconstriction. Experiments were performed in isolated rat renal arterioles. First it was determined that both afferent arteriole (AA) and efferent arteriole (EA) exhibited concentration-dependent decreases in lumen diameter to increasing molar concentrations of CsA. The AA was more sensitive to the vasoconstrictive effects of CsA than the EA. Next, the blocking effect of a recently synthesized putative ETA receptor antagonist was verified in both the AA and EA, where it was found that the cyclic peptide cyclo D-Asp-L-Pro-D-Val-L-Leu-D-Trp totally inhibited the vasoconstriction observed with ET addition. Finally, the role of locally stimulated ET in CsA-induced <b>vasoconstriction</b> was <b>tested</b> by determining the effect of the ETA receptor antagonist on CsA-induced AA and EA constriction. In the AA the vasoconstrictor effect of 10 (- 11) M CsA was completely blocked by the ETA receptor antagonist. However, in contrast to AA, 10 (- 11) M CsA in EA in the presence of the ETA receptor antagonist decreased EA lumen diameter by a mean of 41 % from baseline (4. 80 +/- 0. 75 microns vs 7. 80 +/- 0. 84 microns, P < 0. 05). This change in lumen diameter was similar to that induced by CsA alone. These data suggest that CsA directly constricts renal microvessels.

40|$|The {{potential}} of bovine lactoferrin (LF) {{as a source}} of antihypertensive peptides acting on the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and the endothelin (ET) system as dual vasopeptidase inhibitors has been examined. For this purpose enzymatic LF hydrolyzates (LFHs) were generated by trypsin and proteinase K digestions. Permeate fractions with molecular masses lower than 3 kDa (LFH < 3 kDa) were orally administered to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Although both LFHs < 3 kDa showed in vitro angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) -inhibitory activity, only proteinase K LFH < 3 kDa exerted an in vivo antihypertensive effect. The proteinase K LFH < 3 kDa and a previously characterized pepsin LFH < 3 kDa with ACE-inhibitory and antihypertensive effects were tested in ex vivo functional assays as inhibitors of ACE-dependent vasoconstriction. Pepsin LFH < 3 kDa but not proteinase K LFH < 3 kDa inhibited ACE-dependent <b>vasoconstriction.</b> When <b>tested</b> as inhibitors towards endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE), both LFHs < 3 kDa exerted in vitro inhibitory effects on ECE activity and inhibited ECE-dependent vasoconstriction. Most abundant peptides in proteinase K LFH < 3 kDa were identified by using an ion trap mass spectrometer. Based on peptide abundance, two peptides (GILRPY and REPYFGY) were chemically synthesized and their ECE-inhibitory activity was tested. Both exerted in vitro inhibitory effects on ECE activity. In conclusion, orally effective antihypertensive LFHs < 3 kDa may act as dual vasopeptidase (ACE/ECE) or as single ECE inhibitors with different antivasoconstrictor effects depending on the protease used to release bioactive peptide sequences. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{determine}} whether sympathetic coronary vasoconstrictor responses are altered after brief ischemia and reperfusion. Adult mongrel dogs were anesthetized and instrumented for measurements of heart rate, arterial pressure, left ventricular pressure, left ventricular dP/dt, anterior myocardial wall thickening, and left circumflex coronary artery (LCX) and left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) blood flow velocities. Changes in coronary vascular resistance were recorded during intravenous bolus doses of norepinephrine and bilateral electrical stimulation of the stellate ganglia. After f 3 -adrenergic blockade and bilateral vagotomy, electrical stimulation of the stellate ganglia increased coronary vascular resistance in the LAD and LCX beds by 38 ± 5 % and 39 ± 5 %, respectively. After a 15 -minute LAD occlusion, repeat electrical stimulation produced increases in coronary resistance of 16 ± 3 % and 45 ± 8 %, respectively (p< 0. 05 for the LAD before versus after the occlusion). The peak increase in coronary vascular resistance to two doses of norepinephrine was unchanged. After a shorter period of myocardial ischemia (7 minutes), similar increases in coronary resistance to stellate stimulation were observed before (27 ± 4 %) and after (26 ± 6 %) myocardial ischemia.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Sepsis is characterised by diminished {{vasopressor}} responsiveness. Vasoconstriction {{depends upon}} a balance: Ca(2 +) -dependent myosin light-chain kinase promotes and Ca(2 +) -independent myosin light-chain phosphatase (MLCP) opposes vascular smooth muscle contraction. The enzyme Rho kinase (ROK) inhibits MLCP, favouring <b>vasoconstriction.</b> We <b>tested</b> {{the hypothesis that}} ROK-dependent MLCP inhibition was attenuated in late sepsis and associated with reduced contractile responses to certain vasopressor agents. METHODS: This is a prospective, controlled animal study. Sixteen-week-old C 57 /BL 6 mice received laparotomy or laparotomy with caecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Antibiotics, fluids and analgesia were provided before sacrifice on day 5. Vasoconstriction of the femoral arteries {{to a range of}} stimuli was assessed using myography: (i) depolarisation with 87 mM K(+) assessed voltage-gated Ca(2 +) channels (L-type, Cav 1. 2 Ca(2 +) channels (LTCC)), (ii) thromboxane A 2 receptor activation assessed the activation state of the LTCC and ROK/MLCP axis, (iii) direct PKC activation (phorbol-dibutyrate (PDBu), 5 μM) assessed the PKC/CPI- 17 axis independent of Ca(2 +) entry and (iv) α 1 -adrenoceptor stimulation with phenylephrine (10 (- 8) to 10 (- 4) M) and noradrenaline (10 (- 8) to 10 (- 4) M) assessed the sum of these pathways plus the role of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). ROK-dependent MLCP activity was indexed by Western blot analysis of P[Thr 855]MYPT. Parametric and non-parametric data were analysed using unpaired Student's t-tests and Mann-Whitney tests, respectively. RESULTS: ROK-dependent inhibition of MLCP activity was attenuated in both unstimulated (n = 6 to 7) and stimulated (n = 8 to 12) vessels from mice that had undergone CLP (p < 0. 05). Vessels from CLP mice demonstrated reduced vasoconstriction to K(+), thromboxane A 2 receptor activation and PKC activation (n = 8 to 13; p < 0. 05). α 1 -adrenergic responses were unchanged (n = 7 to 12). CONCLUSIONS: In a murine model of sepsis, ROK-dependent inhibition of MLCP activity in vessels from septic mice was reduced. Responses to K(+) depolarisation, thromboxane A 2 receptor activation and PKC activation were diminished in vitro whilst α 1 -adrenergic responses remained intact. Inhibiting MLCP may present a novel therapeutic target to manage sepsis-induced vascular dysfunction. Benjamin AJ Reddi, John F Beltrame, Richard L Young, and David P Wilso...|$|R
40|$|Regulation of the renal {{angiotensin}} II receptor gene {{in acute}} unilateral ureteral obstruction. We {{have shown that}} acute (24 -hr) unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) induces the genes encoding for renin, in juxtaglomerular apparatuses and in tubules, for angiotensin converting enzyme in vascular endothelial cells, and for angiotensinogen in perivascular fat. These molecular changes occur in temporal association to marked reductions in renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR), suggesting that angiotensin II (Ang II) is at least {{partly responsible for the}} renal <b>vasoconstriction.</b> We <b>tested</b> the hypothesis that down-regulation of the Ang II type- 1 receptor (AT 1 -R) gene occurs in UUO in response to Ang II, by examining the effects of an ACE inhibitor [lisinopril (Li), 5 mg/kg/day] and of the specific nonpeptidic AT 1 -R blocker, losartan (Lo) (10 mg/kg/day). UUO or sham operated (which included manipulation but not obstruction of the ureter) rats (S) were studied. Northern blot analysis of the steady state concentration of AT 1 -R mRNA corrected for GAPDH mRNA showed a marked decrease in receptor expression (- 77 %, N = 4, P < 0. 01) in the obstructed kidney (UUO) compared to S; sham diminished gene expression modestly compared to the contralateral kidneys (C) of UUO. In situ hybridization for AT 1 -R mRNA also showed diminished expression in UUO compared to C kidneys (N = 4). Treatment of UUO rats (N = 4) with Lo increased AT 1 -R mRNA five times above the levels in UUO rats receiving vehicle; the increase induced by Li was 50 % that of Lo; S (N = 4) and C (N = 4) did not change. Losartan, but not vehicle treatment increased RBF (sixfold) and GFR (fivefold) in the UUO kidneys. We conclude that UUO leads to down-regulation of AT 1 -R mRNA, and that this effect is mediated by Ang II, which is also responsible for a major component of the renal hemodynamic changes. Some function of UUO or ureteral manipulation, possibly stretch or nerve stimulation, differentially regulates the genes encoding for the renin-angiotensin system in the kidney...|$|R
40|$|We {{hypothesized}} that in salt-dependent forms of hypertension, endogenous ouabain acts on arterial smooth muscle to cause enhanced <b>vasoconstriction.</b> Here, we <b>tested</b> for {{the involvement of}} the arterial endothelium and perivascular sympathetic nerve terminals in ouabain-induced vasoconstriction. Segments of rat mesenteric or renal interlobar arteries were pressurized to 70 mmHg at 37 °C and exposed to ouabain (10 − 11 – 10 − 7 M). Removal of the endothelium enhanced ouabain-induced vasoconstriction by as much as twofold (at an ouabain concentration of 10 − 9 M). A component of the ouabain-induced vasoconstriction is due to the enhanced spontaneous release of norepinephrine (NE) from nerve terminals in the arterial wall. The α 1 -adrenoceptor blocker prazosin (10 − 6 M) decreased ouabain-induced vasoconstrictions by as much as 50 %. However, neither the contraction induced by sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) nor the NE release evoked by SNA (measured directly by carbon fiber amperometry) was increased by ouabain (< 10 − 7 M). Nevertheless, the converse case was true: after brief bursts of SNA, vasoconstrictor responses to ouabain were transiently increased (1. 75 -fold). This effect may be mediated by neuropeptide Y and Y 1 receptors on smooth muscle. In arteries lacking the endothelium and exposed to prazosin, ouabain (10 − 11 M and greater) caused vasoconstriction, indicating a direct effect of very “low” concentrations of ouabain on arterial smooth muscle. In conclusion, in intact arteries, the endothelium opposes ouabain (10 − 11 – 10 − 7 M) -induced vasoconstriction, which is caused by both enhanced spontaneous NE release and direct effects on smooth muscle. Ouabain (< 10 − 7 M) does not enhance SNA-mediated contractions, but SNA enhances ouabain-induced contractions. The effects of endogenous ouabain may be accentuated in forms of hypertension that involve sympathetic nerve hyperactivity and/or endothelial dysfunction...|$|R

Therefore, we investigated the effect of extremity cooling on skin blood flow (SkBF) and temperature (T sk) between ethnic groups. Methods Thirty males [10 Caucasian (CAU), 10 Asian (ASN), 10 AFD] undertook three tests in 30 °C air whilst digit T sk and SkBF were measured: (i) vasomotor threshold (VT) test—arm immersed in 35 °C water progressively cooled to 10 °C and rewarmed to 35 °C to identify vasoconstriction and vasodilatation; (ii) cold-induced vasodilatation (CIVD) test—hand immersed in 8 °C water for 30 min followed by spontaneous warming; (iii) cold sensitivity (CS) test—foot immersed in 15 °C water for 2 min followed by spontaneous warming. Cold sensory thresholds of the forearm and finger were also assessed. Results In the VT <b>test,</b> <b>vasoconstriction</b> and vasodilatation occurred at a warmer finger T sk in AFD during cooling [21. 2 (4. 4) vs. 17. 0 (3. 1) °C, P = 0. 034] and warming [22. 0 (7. 9) vs. 12. 1 (4. 1) °C, P = 0. 002] compared with CAU. In the CIVD test, average SkBF during immersion was greater in CAU [42 (24) %] than ASN [25 (8) %, P = 0. 036] and AFD [24 (13) %, P = 0. 023]. Following immersion, SkBF was higher and rewarming faster in CAU [3. 2 (0. 4) °C min − 1] compared with AFD [2. 5 (0. 7) °C min − 1, P = 0. 037], but neither group differed from ASN [3. 0 (0. 6) °C min − 1]. Responses to the CS test and cold sensory thresholds were similar between groups. Conclusion AFD experienced a more intense protracted finger vasoconstriction than CAU during hand immersion, whilst ASN experienced an intermediate response.

40|$|A review {{contains}} {{a description of}} the most common methods of evaluation and monitoring of "endothelial dysfunction" that are assessed in terms of their information content and applicability in the practice of medicine. The term "endothelial function" is interpreted primarily {{as a function of the}} regulation of capillary blood flow, carried out by the expense of the dynamic change of the phase of vasoconstriction and vasodilatation in vessels of resistive type (in accordance with the changing needs of cellular metabolism). Assessment of endothelial dysfunction is understood as a generalized indicator of the extent and nature of violations of the regulation of peripheral circulation. It includes an assessment of imbalances between endotheliumdependent vasoconstrictor and vasodilating factors or mismatch of the local and central regulation of capillary blood flow in response to various functional tests or other effects (eg, cold test, or test with local ischemia). All methods of endothelial dysfunction assessment in the survey are divided into invasive and non-invasive. The main feature of invasive methods lies in the direct effect on the endothelium of the coronary or other vessels by introducing into these vessels vasoactive substances such as acetylcholine. Response to the <b>test</b> (<b>vasoconstriction</b> or vasodilation) is evaluated by coronary angiography or by ultrasound. Non-invasive methods of the assessment of endothelial dysfunction or functions of regulation of the peripheral circulation are regarded as the most promising for widespread use. There are two basic methods that underlie functional tests: methods PAT (peripheral arterial tone) and PHG (polyhepatography). Assessment of endothelial dysfunction in many modern scientific researches is important. They are regarded as the causative factors of many different diseases. Such assessments can be useful in everyday medical practice. Assessment of endothelial function provides the clinician with critical information essential for a personalized selection of therapy. In particular, for taking into account the individual characteristics of the local and central regulatory system response of peripheral blood circulation in the various functional tests, or other effects. </p...|$|R
