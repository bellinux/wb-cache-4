In essence, this concept boils down to the right of an individual to have equal opportunity to be successful with their bid for work.|$|E

40|$|Most of {{the online}} {{advertising}} today is sold via an auction, which requires the advertiser to respond with a <b>valid</b> <b>bid</b> within {{a fraction of a}} second. As such, most advertisers employ bidding agents to submit bids on their behalf. The architecture of such agents typically has (1) an offline optimization phase which incorporates the bidder’s knowledge about the market and (2) an online bidding strategy which simply executes the offline strategy. The online strategy is typically highly dependent on both supply and expected price distributions, both of which are forecast using traditional machine learning methods. In this work we investigate the optimum strategy of the bidding agent when faced with incorrect forecasts. At a high level, the agent can invest resources in improving the forecasts, or can tighten the loop between successive offline optimization cycles in order to detect errors more quickly. We show analytically that the latter strategy, while simple, is extremely effective in dealing with forecast errors, and confirm this finding with experimental evaluations...|$|E

40|$|Group-based {{approaches}} to the elicitation of stated preferences are considered particularly suitable for valuing unfamiliar or complex environmental goods. While such exercises provide participants with detailed information and time to think and deliberate, they require a considerable degree of motivation from the respondents. Effects of motivation on willingness to pay (WTP) tend to be ignored within the valuation research community, although similar effects {{have been reported in}} psychological literature. In this study, a novel approach using video recordings and behaviour coding of participants in group-based Market Stall meetings was employed to measure motivation as well as its impact on WTP and the theoretical and convergent validity of stated WTP. Indicators of motivation correlated significantly with both WTP statements and their validity, with more motivated individuals stating higher and more <b>valid</b> <b>bids.</b> These findings suggest that the recognition of motivation is an important novel element of research into stated preferences, particularly with respect to usefulness and quality of WTP measures. butterflies, conservation, motivation, Market Stall, stated preference techniques, validity, willingness to pay,...|$|R

The study also shows that the proportion of protest bids averages 14.8 percent of all responses. Such figure is somewhat consistent with other results in the literature. Kirkland ([1988]) has 18 percent of protest responses in his study, about 24 percent are determined by Sappideen ([1992]) and 28 – 31 percent of protest bids in the study by Jakobsson and Dragun ([1996]). According to Moser and Dunning ([1986]), the high level of protest bids reveals that some questions could be misunderstood; the respondents have troubles to understand the study scenario or are not convinced that the proposed project becomes real.|$|R
40|$|System {{security}} and power quality {{is important in}} today's society {{and the ability to}} regulate and balance production and consumption is crucial for any power system. More and more penetration of intermittent production in power systems increases the need for regulation capability and the importance of capacity reserve markets where capacity used for regulation is procured and secured increases too. Several types of regulation mechanisms are used in a power system, which creates the possibility of several different capacity reserve markets with significant prices. A producer participating in these markets must decide how his limited production capacity should be used taking these markets and other physical power markets into account. A method for finding true costs for capacity reserve supply and for bidding in sequential capacity reserve markets is presented in this report. The method is based on a mixed-integer programming model and work has been done to create and formulate a suitable model. The modeling is implemented with the programming language AMPL and is an optimization model that maximizes total profit on several markets subject to market prices and market obligations for a set of production units. The model is then used to highlight some of the fundamental mechanisms and charactheristics in the markets and to illustrate the bidding method for a price-taking producer in perfect markets. Price uncertainty in future markets has a large impact on the results from the method and a model version where price uncertainty is included for the spot market is compared to a version where price uncertainty is not included. The reason for this comparison is that hourly spot price forecasts used for short-term production planning in Norway today doesn't consider price uncertainty. The versions are compared for bidding in one capacity reserve market for a number of market clearings where prices for the spot market in the model are taken from real spot price forecasts and real spot price outcomes. It shows that inclusion of price uncertainty gives better bids, but also that adjusting bids to account for price uncertainty can give good results from a model that doesn't explicity include this uncertainty. The method can in any case calculate <b>valid</b> <b>bids</b> for capacity reserve market solutions that exist today where costs and opportunity costs from all relevant markets can be accounted for. The limitations of the method is mostly connected to what it is possible to describe with mixed-integer programming and the computational efforts and calculation times mixed-integer programming models require. </p...|$|R
40|$|I {{examine a}} model of a uniform price auction of a {{perfectly}} divisible good with private information in which the bidders submit discrete bidpoints rather than continuous downward sloping demand functions. I characterize necessary conditions for equilibrium bidding. The characterization reveals a close relationship between bidding in multiunit auctions and oligopolistic behaviour. I demonstrate that a recently proposed indirect approach to the revenue comparisons of discriminatory and uniform price auctions is not <b>valid</b> if <b>bid</b> functions have steps. In particular, bidders may bid above their marginal valuation in a uniform price auction. In order to demonstrate that discrete bidding can have important consequences for empirical analysis I use my model to examine a data set consisting of individual bids in uniform price treasury auctions of the Czech government. I propose an alternative method for evaluating the performance of the employed mechanism. My results suggest that the uniform price auction performs well, both in terms of efficiency of the allocation and in terms of revenue maximization. I estimate that the employed mechanism failed to extract at most 3 basis points in terms of the annual yield of T-bills worth of expected surplus while implementing an allocation resulting in almost all the efficient surplus. Failing to account for discreteness of bids would in my application result in overestimating the unextracted revenue by more than 50 %. Copyright 2011, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper follows up on a model {{described}} elsewhere by the authors. The model {{incorporates a}} privacy cost component to expected payoff in auctions. This is the cost, to the bidder, {{of the information}} revealed, by the bid, about the bidder’s valuation. It applies even if the sale is lost, and hence, negative pay-offs, not possible in regular auctions, are possible in auctions with privacy costs. An important concern is whether such a cost affects seller revenue. Our initial analysis of eBay data on sales of the Mustang indicates that those bidders who avail of privacy technology tend to pay a larger sale price, on average, {{than those who do}} not. This indicates that privacy cost does effect seller revenue in at least some cases. In this paper we provide a mathematical analysis of threshold strategies- where bidders have monotonic increasing strategies for valuations x ≥ xt ≥ 0 and do not bid for valuations x < xt- for sealed-bid first and second-price auctions with privacy cost. We observe that bidders pass on at least some, if not all, privacy costs to the seller, and that expected revenues are lower in auctions with privacy costs than otherwise. We also find that a zero-plus bid- one arbitrarily close to zero- is a <b>valid</b> equilibrium <b>bid,</b> and, in equilibrium, the probability of it winning the auction is non-negligible. Most importantly, we find that when privacy costs are large enough, revenue equivalence does not hold. In such cases, first-price auctions provide higher expected payoffs, but which auction provides a higher revenue depends on the privacy cost function and the number of bidders. Because bidders can choose between the two auctions and revenues and payoffs are not equivalent, and because the bidder passes on {{at least some of the}} privacy cost to the seller, it is in the interest of the seller to reduce privacy cost. We conclude that it could often be valuable for the seller to provide privacy-protecting technology while executing an auction, so as to increase revenue by reducing the bidder’s privacy cost. ...|$|R
40|$|This study reports an {{application}} of the Contingent Valuation method (CV) to estimate the non-market {{costs and benefits of}} hydro scheme developments in an Icelandic wilderness area.   A deliberative group-based approach, called Market Stall (MS), is compared to a control group consisting of conventional in-person interviews, in order to investigate flaws of CV, such as poor validity, high non-response rates to the elicitation question and protest responses.   A careful exploration into perceived property rights led to the use of willingness to accept (WTA) in compensation for wilderness loss and willingness to pay (WTP) for hydro scheme related benefits.   Furthermore, a novel approach to participant behaviour observation and debriefing questions provided insights into the shortcomings of conventional data collection modes, in terms of encouraging motivation, standardised information sets and time pressure, as well as a useful supplement to validity testing. The study suggests that public preferences for the preservation of the wilderness area (status quo) outweigh preferences for non-market hydro scheme benefits.   Mean WTA accounts for 780. 107 kr (MS estimates) and 86, 328 kr (control group estimates), while mean WTP totals 21, 326 kr (MS estimates) and 6, 377 kr (control estimates).   According to this study, MS is better suited for preference construction over complex environmental goods:  estimates have more explanatory power, the non-response rate to the elicitation question is lower, and respondents are more engaged.   A further finding provides evidence that individuals have differing information requirements, and hence standardised information sets may not be suitable in CV.   However, according to the debriefing questions, MS adjusted information to individual needs better than interviews.   Although previous research has avoided using WTA due to high mental demands, protesting and strategic bidding, the questionnaire design used in this study resulted in both MS and interview respondents reporting <b>valid</b> WTA <b>bids.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
