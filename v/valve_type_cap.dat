40|$|Prior to {{the recent}} work {{performed}} by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) relative to nuclear industry check valve performance, no information was readily available regarding the failure characteristics of check valves based on <b>valve</b> <b>type</b> (e. g., swing check, lift check). Although it had been recognized by component experts that the two most significant factors in determining check valve performance were valve design (i. e., type) and operating conditions, no industry data was available relative to the former. In cooperation with the Nuclear Industry Check Valve Group (NIC), ORNL has reviewed and analyzed check valve failures from the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations` (INPOs`) Nuclear Plant Reliability Database System (NPRDS) according to several parameters,including <b>valve</b> <b>type.</b> Since the <b>valve</b> <b>type</b> identification is not inherently included within the NPRDS engineering record for each component, ORNL had to rely upon input from NIC, valve manufacturers, and catalogs to supply the missing information. As {{a result of this}} effort, approximately 77 % of the check valve failures occurring during the 1991 - 1996 study period and nearly 62 % of the overall installed population were identified according to type. This data provided the basis to perform previously unavailable cross-correlations between parameters such as <b>valve</b> <b>type</b> versus failure mode and failure cause. Design characteristics and service applications differ markedly among check <b>valve</b> <b>types,</b> resulting in discernible differences in performance. This paper focuses on the performance characteristics of swing and lift <b>type</b> check <b>valves</b> since failure and population distributions have shown these to be the two most common types employed {{in a wide range of}} nuclear plant applications...|$|R
40|$|Patient {{background}} {{mortality and}} excess mortality related to aortic valve disease {{may play a}} greater role than implanted <b>valve</b> <b>type</b> in explaining the observed survival differences after aortic valve replacement. This study attempts to identify {{the differences between the}} performance of selected biological valves, given similar patient characteristics and excess mortality. Four biological <b>valve</b> <b>types,</b> the Carpentier-Edwards pericardial and supra-annular valve, Medtronic Freestyle valve and allografts were used for this analysis. Primary data calculated observed patient-survival and median time to structural valvular deterioration. We then used a microsimulation model to calculate age-specific patient survival and reoperation- and event-free life expectancies. The model incorporated the US population mortality and a uniform excess mortality, while the hazards of valve-related events after implantation of the four <b>valve</b> <b>types</b> were estimated from corresponding meta-analysis and primary data. Observed 10 -year survival (60 - 69) -year age group survival and median time to SVD for the different <b>valve</b> <b>types</b> did not differ. Microsimulation calculated, for a 65 -year-old male for example, a 10 -year survival of 51 %, 51 %, 53 % and 56 % for Carpentier-Edwards pericardial and Supra-annular valve, Freestyle and allografts, respectively. Patient life expectancy was 10. 8, 10. 8, 11. 0 and 11. 4 years, respectively. Assuming uniform patient characteristics and excess mortality, the observed difference in performance between the four biological <b>valve</b> <b>types</b> is less marked. Patient selection and the timing of operation may explain most of the observed differences in prognosis after aortic valve replacement with biological prostheses...|$|R

We found that individual <b>valves</b> of each <b>type</b> and manufacturer functioned similarly. Different <b>valve</b> <b>types,</b> however, functioned differently: with one type, system pressure {{was higher than}} rated (p < 0. 05), and with another type, system pressure was significantly flow-dependent (p < 0. 01). The remaining <b>types</b> of <b>valves</b> had no flow-resistive properties and maintained a system pressure of 10 cm H 2 O. We conclude that system pressure is not similar in all continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) systems using bias flow and EPP valves.

40|$|AbstractIn a Veterans Administration Cooperative Study {{involving}} 13 medical centers, 575 patients undergoing {{single valve}} replacement were prospectively randomized to receive either the standard Björk-Shiley prosthesis or the Hancock porcine heterograft (with a modified orifice for sizes 23 and smaller). The hemodynamic {{data in the}} 268 patients who underwent cardiac catheterization an average of 6 months (range 3 to 12) postoperatively are reported. Statistical analyses were performed on valve sizes 23, 25 and 27 in the aortic position, and 29, 31 and 33 in the mitral position. A wide variation was observed in mean pressure gradient and calculated orifice area in both <b>valve</b> <b>types</b> within all sizes in both the aortic and the mitral positions. In the aortic position, the Björk-Shiley prosthesis tended to have a lower pressure gradient and larger calculated orifice area than the Hancock heterograft, but the differences in gradient between the two <b>valve</b> <b>types</b> were significant only in the larger-sized valves. The difference in calculated area between the two <b>valve</b> <b>types</b> was not significant within each valve size. In the mitral position, {{there were no differences}} in gradient and calculated orifice area between the two types of prostheses. The postoperative cardiac index, regurgitant volume, pulmonary artery systolic and mean pressures, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, left ventricular ejection fraction and left ventricular end-diastolic volume index did not differ in patients receiving the Björk-Shiley prosthesis from values in patients receiving the Hancock heterograft. Hence, the overall hemodynamic performance of both <b>types</b> of <b>valves</b> is remarkably similar. The choice between these two prostheses should, therefore, be governed not by the hemodynamic performance, but by other factors such as valve durability, risk of anticoagulation and incidence of valve-related complications...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS OF THE STUDY: In vivo hemodynamic {{assessment}} of bileaflet aortic valve prostheses using standardized echocardiography is still uncommon; hence, adequate comparison of <b>valve</b> <b>types</b> can rarely be made. We compared the postoperative hemodynamics of St. Jude Standard valves (SJS) {{with those of}} Sorin Bicarbon valves (BC) implanted in the aortic position, using pulsed, continuous and color Doppler echocardiography. METHODS: The examination was performed four months after aortic valve prosthesis implantation in 76 patients (39 SJS valves, 37 BC valves). Valve sizes varied from 19 mm to 25 mm. Maximal and mean instantaneous pressure gradients were measured by Doppler echocardiography. Effective valve orifice area (EOA) was calculated and prosthetic valve regurgitation was assessed by color Doppler flow imaging. RESULTS: At valve sizes of 21 mm, 23 mm and 25 mm, SJS valves had a significantly lower EOAs than BC valves (p < 0. 05). However, for a given nominal size, BC valves are larger, i. e. they have a larger anatomic (AOA) and geometric orifice area (GOA) than SJS valves. Consequently, BC valves were implanted in patients with a larger left ventricular outflow tract (p < 0. 05). When EOA {{is related to the}} corresponding AOA, BC valves still show a larger EOA than SJS valves (p < 0. 05). Prosthetic valve regurgitation is low in both <b>valve</b> <b>types.</b> CONCLUSIONS: (a) Nominal valve size is not always a good basis for comparison of hemodynamic profiles between <b>valve</b> <b>types.</b> (b) Using the relationship between EOA and AOA, the hemodynamic profile of BC valves in the aortic position is shown to be superior to that of SJS valves. status: publishe...|$|R
