40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} {{some of the}} economic implications of climate change scenarios {{as described in the}} Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). By comparing potential water demand with estimates of (sustainable) water availability in different regions, we identify regions that are likely to be constrained in their future economic growth potential by the scarcity of water resources. We assess the macroeconomic impact of water scarcity under alternative allocation rules finding that, by assigning more water to sectors in which it has a higher <b>value,</b> <b>shifting</b> production to less water intensive sectors, and importing more water intensive goods, constrained regions can effectively neutralize these water related climate risks and adapt to a changing water environment. However, this adaptation effort is likely to imply some radical changes in water management policies...|$|E

The value chain of the trade in knocked down products is defined in this paper through {{the analysis of the}} process of the intra-product international division of labour. Firstly, the value chain of knocked down products is divided into two parts, i. e. the value chain of product design and production and the value change of product assembly and sale. Then, the necessary conditions are deduced to realize the reconstruction of the value chain. The tariff escalation policy of the importing country is the main reason for the disruption of the product value chain and the <b>value</b> <b>shifting</b> to the importing country. Finally, the areas of value chain disruption in the cases of various modes of trade in knocked down products are established. As a result, the research on the restructuring of the value chain in the trade in knocked down products will help companies choose a high value link in the value chain from the global distribution perspective...|$|E

Three 12 -element row vectors, nine 12 -element row vectors with one 9 -element column vector, and two 9 -element row vectors with one 2 -element column vector are the structure of the HL 1, HL 2, and OL memory, respectively. The input, synaptic weight, and bias <b>value</b> <b>shifting</b> are synchronized with the clock manager units that are controlled by the ‘weight_sht_ctrl 1 ’ and ‘bias_sht_ctrl 1 ’ signal for HL 1, the ‘weight_sht_ctrl 2 ’ and ‘bias_sht_ctrl 2 ’ signal for HL 2, and the ‘weight_sht_ctrl 3 ’ and ‘bias_sht_ctrl 3 ’ signal for OL. The weight and bias values are serially shifted to perform the input-weight multiplications, cumulative and bias addition operations to compute the net input of neuron ‘n 1 (.)’ in HL 1 and the weight are serially and bias are paralleley shifted to perform the multiply and accumulation and bias addition operations to compute the neuron net inputs ‘n 21 (.) to n 29 (.)’ and ‘n 31 (.) and n 32 (.)’ in HL 2 and OL, respectively.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an interdisciplinary}} project {{aimed to explore}} normative and empirical dimensions and underpinnings of a societal transformation towards sustainability and the underlying <b>value</b> <b>shift</b> in developed countries.

30|$|Figure  8 {{shows the}} graph of tan delta versus temperature. The tan delta curve closely resembles the loss modulus curve leading to the glass {{transition}} tan delta values well below 0.1. The rapid rise in tan delta values closely resembles the rapid decline in storage modulus values. The peak value of tan delta indicates that the material is nonelastic, whereas the lower value of tan delta indicates that the material is elastic in nature (Agarwal et al. [2013]). Region 1 shows that the material is highly elastic in this region, and as the value of tan delta shifts to region 2, the nature of material shifts from elastic to plastic. The peak value of tan delta indicates that any further increase in temperature beyond this changes the material from elastic to plastic zone. Figure  8 shows that {{as the percentage of}} fiber/filler increases, the peak <b>value</b> <b>shifts</b> towards higher temperature resulting in wider elastic range of temperature, whereas as the percentage of fiber/filler decreases, the peak <b>value</b> <b>shifts</b> towards the lower temperature range resulting in narrow elastic range.|$|R

40|$|This thesis has {{two main}} themes: (1) <b>values</b> <b>shift</b> versus {{cultural}} particularity and (2) values and democracy. The Postmaterialist thesis and related theories of <b>values</b> <b>shift</b> presented by Ronald Inglehart and others assume that, {{as a consequence}} of industrialisation and post-industrialisation, people's values transform {{in such a way as}} to increase an emphasis on self-esteem, self-expression and other qualities. Individuals become increasingly capable, autonomous and inclined to public demands, which can be conducive to liberal democratic outcomes. In relation to these, the present study suggests that cultural particularity should be taken into consideration as a factor competing with that of <b>values</b> <b>shift</b> in terms of influence on people's attitudinal conditions. For individualism is often quoted as a core element of Western civilisation, which is not necessarily so in other cultural scenarios. With this enquiry, the study mainly concentrates on the analysis of the World Values Survey. Postmaterialist indexes are closely investigated by comparing the USA, Britain, Russia and Japan. The examination further incorporates broader regions: Western, Postcommunist and East Asian regions. The results indicate a certain validity in the cultural effect. This is especially the case with a Postmaterialist values item on 'freedom of speech', which contrasts with other Postmaterialist item: 'giving people more say in important government decisions'. Their implications for democracy are subsequently considered. These non-Western societies appear to exhibit certain weaknesses in the Postmaterialist transformation and its attitudinal efficacy for polyarchy-like democracy. The attention turns to gaps in perceptions of freedom between the USA, Russia and Japan, which could be applied to the trilateral regions. This national difference also seems to be present in the area of protest, notwithstanding the fact that there are some indications of <b>values</b> <b>shift.</b> Culture seems to matter on popular outlooks vis-à-vis the Postmaterialist effects. Multivariate analysis on this aspect endorses the same conclusion. The outcomes imply variation between the citizens of these societies in ways that they relate to government. The nations are compared with respect to the influences of liberal democratic attitudes on moderate protest and views of governance. After all, American (and probably British) individuals seem to be more compatible with public demands and participatory democracy than those in Russia and Japan. Western cultural emphasis on the particular quality of freedom could be favourable to Postmaterialist values as well as individual attitudes that call for responsive and accountable democracy.

Paige's awakening to nonkilling occurred during 1973-74 and has led {{to more than a}} quarter century of discovery and re-education resulting in the thesis of Nonkilling Global Political Science. This unexpected shift by a conventionally trained, violence-accepting political scientist, whose doctoral dissertation justified war and threat of war in Korea, perhaps can be attributed in part to a process of [...] "cognitive dissonance" [...] in which one's values and perceptions of reality come in conflict. Having participated in and justified a Cold War crusade for freedom and peace in Korea (values) combined with opposition in 1973 by the United States and ROK governments to a University of Hawai‘i initiative to invite North Korean scholars to visit Honolulu for a peaceful cultural exchange (non-peace reality) one day produced a strongly felt <b>value</b> <b>shift</b> expressed in three words of an inner voice, [...] "No more killing!"
