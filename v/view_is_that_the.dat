5|$|The {{traditional}} <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> coelom(s) in deuterostomes and protostomes form {{by different}} process, called enterocoely and schizocoely respectively. However, research {{since the early}} 1990s has found significant exceptions. Both types of coelom construction appear among brachiopods, and therefore do not imply that brachiopods are deuterostomes.|$|E
5|$|In {{a note on}} torsion, Thompson {{mentions}} Charles Darwin's {{treatment of}} climbing plants which often spiral around a support, noting that Darwin also observed that the spiralling stems were themselves twisted. Thompson disagrees with Darwin's teleological explanation, that the twisting makes the stems stiffer {{in the same way}} as the twisting of a rope; Thompson's <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> mechanical adhesion of the climbing stem to the support sets up a system of forces which act as a 'couple' offset from the centre of the stem, making it twist.|$|E
5|$|Like all Hawaiian volcanoes, Kīlauea {{was created}} as the Pacific tectonic plate moved over the Hawaiian hotspot in the Earth's {{underlying}} mantle. The Hawaii island volcanoes {{are the most}} recent evidence of this process that, over 70 million years, has created the -long Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain. The prevailing, though not completely settled, <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> hotspot has been largely stationary within the planet's mantle for much, {{if not all of}} the Cenozoic Era. However, while the Hawaiian mantle plume is well understood and extensively studied, the nature of hotspots themselves remains fairly enigmatic.|$|E
50|$|After the {{massacre}} at Columbine High School on April 20, 1999, one common <b>view</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> violent actions perpetrated by the shooters, Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, {{were due to}} violent influences in entertainment, specifically those in the music of Marilyn Manson.|$|R
50|$|Hanski {{was also}} an active {{advocate}} of nature and biodiversity conservation, participating in public debates. His central <b>view</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> responsibility of ecologists is not restricted to producing scientific information but includes avid participation in the processes using the information produced.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> old <b>view</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{extinguishment}} {{of aboriginal}} title extinguished all tribal {{rights to the}} same land. <b>The</b> current <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> usufructory rights pursuant to a treaty may survive the extinguishment of aboriginal title. However, such usufructs may be lost when tribes cede land to the federal government. Certain usufructs may be extinguished by implication.|$|R
5|$|The {{traditional}} {{view of a}} {{much larger}} 4th century army has fallen out of favour with some historians in more recent times, as existing evidence has been reappraised and new evidence uncovered. The revisionist <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 4th-century army was, at its peak, roughly {{the same size as the}} 2nd-century one and considerably smaller in the late 4th century.|$|E
5|$|Today, the eliminativist view is {{most closely}} {{associated}} with the philosophers Paul and Patricia Churchland, who deny the existence of propositional attitudes (a subclass of intentional states), and with Daniel Dennett, who is generally considered to be an eliminativist about qualia and phenomenal aspects of consciousness. One way to summarize the difference between the Churchlands's views and Dennett's <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Churchlands are eliminativists when it comes to propositional attitudes, but reductionists concerning qualia, while Dennett is an anti-reductionist with respect to propositional attitudes, and an eliminativist concerning qualia.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the ontological}} {{argument}} {{may have been}} implicit {{in the works of}} Greek philosophers such as Plato and the Neoplatonists, the mainstream <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ontological argument was first clearly stated and developed by Anselm of Canterbury. Some scholars argued that the Islamic philosopher Avicenna (Ibn Sina) developed a special kind of ontological argument before Anselm, but other scholars have doubted this position. Daniel Dombrowski marked three major stages {{in the development of the}} argument: Anselm's initial explicit formulation; the eighteenth century criticisms of Kant and Hume; and the identification of a second ontological argument in Anselm's Proslogion by twentieth century philosophers.|$|E
50|$|Cahan disdained those {{entrepreneurial}} {{immigrants who}} attempted to improve their standing through capitalistic free enterprise. His <b>view</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> owners and bosses advanced themselves through the exploitation of their workers. This theme was repeated in editorials in The Forward and in his acclaimed book, The Rise of David Levinsky.|$|R
50|$|Following Angkor's rediscovery by {{the outside}} world in the mid-19th century, decades passed before archeologists grasped Phnom Bakheng's {{historical}} significance. For many years, scholars' consensus <b>view</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Bayon, the temple located {{at the center of}} Angkor Thom city, was the edifice to which the Sdok Kak Thom inscription referred. Later work identified the Bayon as a Buddhist site, built almost three centuries later than originally thought, in the late 12th century, and Phnom Bakheng as King Yasovarman's state temple.|$|R
500|$|The {{historian}} and clergyman Edmund Tyrrell Green, writing {{a survey of}} Anglesey church architecture and contents in 1929, described the arcade as [...] "good" [...] {{and some of the}} tracery in the windows as [...] "very good". His <b>view</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> [...] "excellence of the work" [...] at St Nidan's was because of its link with Beddgelert Priory.|$|R
5|$|Emperors {{could choose}} whether to {{supervise}} the policy bureaucracy or to pursue scholarship, cults, hobbies, or women instead. However, Frederick W. Mote argues that most Song emperors – who spent much of their childhood confined and isolated within a luxurious palace – were aloof conformists detached {{from the world of}} normal affairs and thus relied on officialdom to administer the government. While the mainstream <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Song court exercised the highest degree of restraint and courtesy towards civil officials, the new protocol of enhanced deferential treatment by officials towards the emperor during conferences and meetings further eroded the emperor's close contact with his ministers.|$|E
5|$|Like all Hawaiian volcanoes, Mauna Kea {{has been}} created as the Pacific tectonic plate has moved over the Hawaiian hotspot in the Earth's {{underlying}} mantle. The Hawaii island volcanoes are the most recent evidence of this process that, over 70 million years, has created the -long Hawaiian Ridge–Emperor seamount chain. The prevailing, though not completely settled, <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> hotspot has been largely stationary within the planet's mantle for much, {{if not all of}} the Cenozoic Era. However, while Hawaiian volcanism is well understood and extensively studied, there remains no definite explanation of the mechanism that causes the hotspot effect.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the Jaffna kingdom is obscure and still the subject of {{controversy}} among historians. Among mainstream historians, such as K. M. de Silva, S. Pathmanathan and Karthigesu Indrapala, the widely accepted <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Kingdom of the Aryacakravarti dynasty in Jaffna began in 1215 with the invasion of a previously unknown chieftain called Magha, {{who claimed to be}} from Kalinga in modern India. He deposed the ruling Parakrama Pandyan II, a foreigner from the Pandyan Dynasty who was ruling the Kingdom of Polonnaruwa at the time {{with the help of his}} soldiers and mercenaries from the Kalinga, modern Kerala and Damila (Tamil Nadu) regions in India.|$|E
40|$|For about 2500 years, from Plato’s {{time until}} the closing decades of the 20 th century, <b>the</b> {{dominant}} <b>view</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> emotions <b>are</b> quite distinct from the processes of rational thinking and decision making, and are often a major impediment to those processes. But in recent years this orthodoxy has been challenged {{in a number of}} ways...|$|R

50|$|Gen Diya also {{reported}} that Gen Abacha had said <b>that</b> there <b>was</b> a military tribunal which was considering the matter relating to Generals Obasanjo and Yar’Adua. It <b>was</b> necessary <b>that</b> he should allow the tribunal to complete its work. His <b>view</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tribunal would recommend {{the release of the}} two Generals, failing which he would again intervene to release them.|$|R
5|$|The allied Greek {{army had}} taken up a {{position}} near Chaeronea, astride the main road. On the left flank, the allied Greek line lay across the foothills of Mount Thurion, blocking the side-road that led to Lebedea, while on the right, the line rested against the Kephisos river, near a projecting spur of Mount Aktion. The allied Greek army included contingents from Achaea, Corinth, Chalcis, Epidaurus, Megara and Troezen, {{with the majority of}} troops being supplied by Athens and Thebes, thus making it an army of allied cities of southern Greece, that had been traditionally self-governed for centuries. The Athenian contingent was led by the generals Chares and Lysicles, and the Thebans by Theagenes. No source provides exact numbers for the allied Greek army; the modern <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> allied Greek numbers were approximately equal to those of the Macedonians, who according to Diodorus numbered roughly 30,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry. Philip took command of {{the right wing of the}} Macedonian wing and placed his 18-year-old son Alexander (the future Alexander the Great) in command of the left wing, accompanied by a group of Philip's experienced generals.|$|E
5|$|The heating {{mechanism}} {{required for}} the formation of the grooved terrain on Ganymede is an unsolved problem in the planetary sciences. The modern <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> grooved terrain is mainly tectonic in nature. Cryovolcanism is thought to have played only a minor role, if any. The forces that caused the strong stresses in the Ganymedian ice lithosphere necessary to initiate the tectonic activity may be connected to the tidal heating events in the past, possibly caused when the satellite passed through unstable orbital resonances. The tidal flexing of the ice may have heated the interior and strained the lithosphere, leading to the development of cracks and horst and graben faulting, which erased the old, dark terrain on 70% of the surface. The formation of the grooved terrain may also be connected with the early core formation and subsequent tidal heating of Ganymede's interior, which may have caused a slight expansion of Ganymede by 1–6 % due to phase transitions in ice and thermal expansion. During subsequent evolution deep, hot water plumes may have risen from the core to the surface, leading to the tectonic deformation of the lithosphere. Radiogenic heating within the satellite is the most relevant current heat source, contributing, for instance, to ocean depth. Research models have found that if the orbital eccentricity were an order of magnitude greater than currently (as it may have been in the past), tidal heating would be a more substantial heat source than radiogenic heating.|$|E
25|$|A {{traditional}} <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> biometricians and the Mendelians rejected {{natural selection}} and argued for their separate theories for 20 years, the debate only {{resolved by the}} development of population genetics.|$|E
50|$|A {{previously}} {{more common}} <b>view</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{beginning of the}} Shaka era corresponds to the ascension of Kanishka I in 78 CE. However, the latest research by Henry Falk indicates <b>that</b> Kanishka ascended <b>the</b> throne in 127 CE. Moreover, Kanishka was not a Shaka, but a Kushana ruler. Other historical candidates have included rulers such as Vima Kadphises, Vonones, and Nahapana.|$|R
25|$|Shafi'i: The Shafi'i {{school has}} had two {{well-known}} positions on this issue. <b>The</b> first <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> covering of <b>the</b> face is not obligatory (fard). <b>The</b> second <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> covering <b>the</b> face <b>is</b> obligatory only in times of fitnah (where men do not lower their gaze; or when a woman is very attractive).|$|R
25|$|Arnold Murray (1929–2014), {{founder of}} The Shepherd's Chapel, taught the serpent seed doctrine. He {{accepted}} <b>the</b> belief <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Jews (Kingdom of Judah) were descended from Adam through Seth, {{as described in}} the Bible. However, his <b>view</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Kenites <b>were</b> the offspring of Cain, and <b>that</b> they infiltrated <b>the</b> northern kingdom of Israel. Murray's teachings are disputed by Protestant apologetics ministries CARM and CRI.|$|R
25|$|Henry of Huntingdon's {{account of}} the battle would imply that the men of Lothian with their 'long spears' were in the first line; however, the {{generally}} accepted <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> long spears were those of the Galwegians.|$|E
25|$|A {{different}} <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> similarities {{are caused}} by shallow contamination of the oceanic section, which could be caused by sediments from the continent or by rafted crustal blocks that were trapped in the oceanic lithosphere during the separation between South America and Africa.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Tosefta {{should be}} dated to a period concurrent with or {{shortly after the}} redaction of the Mishnah.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s <b>the</b> {{prevailing}} <b>view</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> genes in a chromosome acted like discrete entities, indivisible by recombination and arranged like beads on a string.

50|$|Both Christians (see Eusebius, Jerome, and Origen) and pagans (see Porphyry and Plotinus) claimed him {{a teacher}} {{and founder of the}} Neoplatonic system.

25|$|The loss of both Loch Vennachar and Loch Sloy {{convinced}} the Marine Board of South Australia {{to argue for}} the bringing forward of a plan that it recommended in 1902 to build a lighthouse at Cape du Couedic.

25|$|By {{the end of}} the 18th century, {{population}} density levels exceeded those in Europe. China had more large cities but far fewer small ones than in contemporary Europe.

25|$|An {{emerging}} <b>view</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Dewatto fault {{marks the}} western edge of the relatively rigid Seattle Uplift (see map). Accommodation of strain (displacement) between the Seattle Fault and the Saddle Mountain deformation zone is likely distributed across the more pliable sediments of the Dewatto Basin; this, and the greater depth to the Crescent Formation, may account for the subdued expression of the Seattle Fault west of Green Mountain.|$|E
50|$|Apparently, all Eppler and Sandtede {{ever did}} in Cairo was {{to spend the}} {{considerable}} sums they had at their disposal on women and a lavish lifestyle. Sadat was extremely critical of them in his book Revolt on <b>the</b> Nile. Sadat's <b>view</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two Germans deliberately sabotaged their own radio, {{because they wanted to}} enjoy themselves and live with two Jewish prostitutes. Reading the British interrogation reports, it is hard to argue with this view.|$|R
5|$|Nearly {{a decade}} after the Tagora had ceased production, the view of the car in <b>the</b> {{automotive}} press <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> merely average though there was little actively wrong with <b>the</b> car. <b>The</b> <b>view</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Tagora had the advantage of refinement, good manners and, in V6 form, good performance.
