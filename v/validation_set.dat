25|$|The group {{method of}} data {{handling}} (GMDH) features fully automatic structural and parametric model optimization. The node activation functions are Kolmogorov-Gabor polynomials that permit additions and multiplications. It used a deep feedforward multilayer perceptron with eight layers. It is a supervised learning network that grows layer by layer, where each layer is trained by regression analysis. Useless items are detected using a <b>validation</b> <b>set,</b> and pruned through regularization. The size {{and depth of}} the resulting network depends on the task.|$|E
25|$|Supervised neural {{networks}} that use a {{mean squared error}} (MSE) cost function can use formal statistical methods to determine {{the confidence of the}} trained model. The MSE on a <b>validation</b> <b>set</b> can be used as an estimate for variance. This value can then be used to calculate the confidence interval of the output of the network, assuming a normal distribution. A confidence analysis made this way is statistically valid as long as the output probability distribution stays the same and the network is not modified.|$|E
5000|$|The {{basic process}} {{of using a}} <b>validation</b> <b>set</b> for model {{selection}} (as part of training set, <b>validation</b> <b>set,</b> and test set) is: Since {{our goal is to}} find the network having the best performance on new data, the simplest approach to the comparison of different networks is to evaluate the error function using data which is independent of that used for training. Various networks are trained by minimization of an appropriate error function defined with respect to a training data set. The performance of the networks is then compared by evaluating the error function using an independent <b>validation</b> <b>set,</b> and the network having the smallest error with respect to the <b>validation</b> <b>set</b> is selected. This approach is called the hold out method. Since this procedure can itself lead to some overfitting to the <b>validation</b> <b>set,</b> the performance of the selected network should be confirmed by measuring its performance on a third independent set of data called a test set.|$|E

40|$|Using <b>validation</b> <b>sets</b> for {{outcomes}} {{can greatly}} improve {{the estimation of}} vaccine efficacy (VE) in the field (Halloran and Longini 2001; Halloran et al. 2003). Most statistical methods for using <b>validation</b> <b>sets</b> rely {{on the assumption that}} outcomes on those with no cultures are missing at random. However, often the <b>validation</b> <b>sets</b> will not be chosen at random. For example, confirmational cultures are often done on people with influenza-like illness as part of routine influenza surveillance. VE estimates based on such non-MAR <b>validation</b> <b>sets</b> could be biased. Here we propose frequentist and Bayesian approaches for estimating vaccine efficacy in the presence of validation bias. Our work builds on the ideas of Rotnitzky et al. (1998, 2001), Scharfstein et al. (1999, 2003) and Robins et al. (2000). Our methods require expert opinion {{about the nature of the}} validation selection bias. In a re-analysis of an influenza vaccine study we found, using the beliefs of a flu expert, that within any plausible range of selection bias the VE estimate based on the <b>validation</b> <b>sets</b> is much higher than the point estimate using just the nonspecific case definition. Our approach is generally applicable to studies with missing binary outcomes with categorical covariates...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} achieve {{non-destructive}} of mature vinegar varieties, a fast discrimination method was put forward based on Visible_near infrared reflectance (NIR) spectroscopy. The FieldSpec 3 spectrometer was used for collecting 20 sample spectra data of the three kinds of mature vinegar separately. Then principal component analysis (PCA) was used to process the spectral data after pretreatment using average smoothing method and multiplicative scatter correction (MSC) method, and principal components(PCs) were selected based on accumulative reliabilities. A total of 60 mature vinegar samples were divided into calibration <b>sets</b> and <b>validation</b> <b>sets</b> randomly, the calibration sets had 45 samples and the <b>validation</b> <b>sets</b> had 15 samples. The stepwise discriminant analysis was trained with five PCs in calibration sets as the inputs,and mature vinegar varieties as the outputs. The stepwise discriminant analysis model was built for discrimination of mature vinegar variety,and the model contains 15 samples in the <b>validation</b> <b>sets.</b> The result showed that a 100 % recognition ration was achieved.

50|$|In {{order to}} avoid overfitting, when any {{classification}} parameter needs to be adjusted, {{it is necessary to}} have a <b>validation</b> <b>set</b> in addition to the training and test sets. For example if the most suitable classifier for the problem is sought, the training set is used to train the candidate algorithms, the <b>validation</b> <b>set</b> is used to compare their performances and decide which one to take, and finally, the test set is used to obtain the performance characteristics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F-measure and so on. The <b>validation</b> <b>set</b> functions as a hybrid: it is training data used by testing, but neither as part of the low-level training, nor as part of the final testing.|$|E
50|$|More {{sophisticated}} forms use cross-validation - multiple partitions of {{the data}} into training set and <b>validation</b> <b>set</b> - instead of a single partition into a training set and <b>validation</b> <b>set.</b> Even this simple procedure is complicated in practice {{by the fact that}} the validation error may fluctuate during training, producing multiple local minima. This complication has led to the creation of many ad-hoc rules for deciding when overfitting has truly begun.|$|E
5000|$|These early {{stopping}} rules work by {{splitting the}} original training set {{into a new}} training set and a <b>validation</b> <b>set.</b> The error on the <b>validation</b> <b>set</b> {{is used as a}} proxy for the generalization error in determining when overfitting has begun.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to further investigate the use of Bayesian Networks (BN) for Web effort estimation when using a cross-company dataset. Four BNs were built; two automatically using the Hugin tool with two training sets; two using a structure elicited by a domain expert, with parameters obtained from automatically fitting the network to the same training sets used in the automated elicitation (hybrid models). The accuracy of all four models was measured using two <b>validation</b> <b>sets,</b> and point estimates. As a benchmark, the BN-based predictions were also compared to predictions obtained using Manual StepWise Regression (MSWR), and Case-Based Reasoning (CBR).

40|$|The {{performance}} of a classification model is often assessed {{in terms of how}} well it separates a set of known observations into appropriate classes. If the <b>validation</b> <b>sets</b> used for such analyses are redundant due to bias in sampling, the relevance of the conclusions drawn to prospective work in which new kinds of positives are sought may be compromised. In the case of the various virtual screening techniques used in modern drug discovery, such bias generally appears as over-representation of particular structural subclasses in the test set. We show how clustering by substructural similarity, followed by applying arithmetic and harmonic weighting schemes to receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, can be used to identify <b>validation</b> <b>sets</b> that are biased due to such redundancies. This can be accomplished qualitatively by direct examination or quantitatively by comparing the areas under the respective linear or semilog curves (AUCs or pAUCs) ...|$|R
40|$|Motivation: Common {{contemporary}} practice {{within the}} {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (NMR) metabolomics community is to evaluate and validate novel algorithms on empirical data or simplified simulated data. Empirical data captures the complex characteristics of experimental data, but the optimal or most correct analysis is unknown a priori; therefore, researchers are forced to rely on indirect performance metrics, which are of limited value. In order to achieve fair and complete analysis of competing techniques more exacting metrics are required. Thus, metabolomics researchers often evaluate their algorithms on simplified simulated data with a known answer. Unfortunately, the conclusions obtained on simulated data are only of value if the data sets are complex enough for results to generalize to true experimental data. Ideally, synthetic data should be indistinguishable from empirical data, yet retain a known best analysis. Results: We have developed a technique for creating realistic synthetic metabolomics <b>validation</b> <b>sets</b> based on NMR spectroscopic data. The <b>validation</b> <b>sets</b> are developed by characterizing the salient distributions in sets of empirical spectroscopic data. Using this technique, several <b>validation</b> <b>sets</b> are constructed {{with a variety of}} characteristics present in ârealâ data. A case study is then presented to compare the relative accuracy of several alignment algorithms using the increased precision afforded by these synthetic data sets.

50|$|Suppose {{we have a}} {{model with}} one or more unknown parameters, and a data set to which the model can be fit (the {{training}} data set). The fitting process optimizes the model parameters to make the model fit the training data as well as possible. If we then take an independent sample of validation data from the same population as the training data, it will generally turn out that the model does not fit the validation data as well as it fits the training data. This is called overfitting , and is particularly likely to happen when the size of the training data set is small, or when the number of parameters in the model is large. Cross-validation is a way to predict the fit of a model to a hypothetical <b>validation</b> <b>set</b> when an explicit <b>validation</b> <b>set</b> is not available.|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} way of performing hyperparameter optimization has been grid search, or a parameter sweep, which is simply an exhaustive searching through a manually specified subset of the hyperparameter space of a learning algorithm.

This study aims to develop a nomogram with tumor burden as the core element for BCLC stage D patients. A total of 386 patients were randomly grouped into derivation and <b>validation</b> <b>sets</b> (1 : 1 ratio). The multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was used to select factors with significant prognostic effect and generate the nomogram. Concordance indices and calibration plots were used to evaluate the performance of nomogram. Overall survival of study patients was significantly associated with tumor burden as well as hepatitis B, serum Î±-fetoprotein level, cirrhosis and performance status in multivariate Cox regression (all p< 0. 05). Beta-coefficients of these variables in derivation set were used to generate the nomogram.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to verify how valid misclassification measurements obtained from a 'pre-survey' calibration exercise are by comparing them to validation scores obtained in 'field' conditions. Validation data were collected from the 'Smile for Life' project, an oral health intervention study in Flemish children. A calibration exercise was organized under 'pre-survey' conditions (32 age-matched children examined by eight examiners and the benchmark scorer). In addition, using a pre-determined sampling scheme blinded to the examiners, the benchmark scorer re-examined between six and 11 children screened by each of the dentists during the survey. Factors influencing sensitivity and specificity for scoring caries experience (CE) were investigated, including examiner, tooth type, surface type, tooth position (upper/lower jaw, right/left side) and <b>validation</b> <b>setting</b> (pre-survey versus field). In order to account for the clustering effect in the data, a generalized estimating equations approach was applied. Sensitivity scores were influenced not only by the calibration setting (lower sensitivity in field conditions, p[*]<[*] 0. 01), but also by examiner, tooth type (lower sensitivity in molar teeth, p[*]<[*] 0. 01) and tooth position (lower sensitivity in the lower jaw, p[*]<[*] 0. 01). Factors influencing specificity were examiner, tooth type (lower specificity in molar teeth, p[*]<[*] 0. 01) and surface type (the occlusal surface with a lower specificity than other surfaces) but not the <b>validation</b> <b>setting.</b> Misclassification measurements for scoring CE are influenced by several factors. In this study, the <b>validation</b> <b>setting</b> influenced sensitivity, with lower scores obtained when measuring data validity in 'field' conditions.
