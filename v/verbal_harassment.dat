25|$|Women can {{experience}} {{all types of}} violence from childhood onwards but most sexual violence is experienced {{in high school and}} in the first year at university.

Prevalence was: 8.7% completed rape, 23.5% attempted rape, 24.2% physical harassment, 18.7% <b>verbal</b> <b>harassment</b> and 11.3% forced sexual initiation. Having a boyfriend currently or being married could serve as a shield against non-partner sexual violence in the university, although they were still susceptible to sexual victimization by their intimate partners.|$|E
500|$|Two {{music videos}} were shot for [...] "Can't Take That Away," [...] both {{directed}} by Sanaa Hamri in New York City. The {{creation of the}} video involved some of Carey's fans: two weeks prior to filming, they were invited via her website to send in video clips of themselves, telling her of the hardships {{in their lives and}} how the song had inspired them to look at life differently, and had given them strength. A contest was held, and video clips from five fans were chosen for inclusion in the video.

2500|$|In a July {{meeting with}} activists and journalists {{at the end}} of an investigatory visit, Manjoo heard {{complaints}} and criticized the Mexican government's record on gender inequality in public agencies, describing <b>verbal</b> <b>harassment</b> and sexual harassment as forms of violence against women. She said that violence against women [...] "is acknowledged as a pervasive and widespread human rights violation" [...] and that [...] "no single country can claim that there is progressive elimination occurring". She said that two UN reports on the US in 2014 highlighted a disproportionate level of violence experienced by women from ethnic and racial minorities, mirroring findings in her own report of 2011 and similarly urging that the government do more to address the issue.|$|E
2500|$|While {{many aspects}} of LGBT health disparities are {{heretofore}} uninvestigated, at this stage, {{it is known that}} one of the main forms of healthcare discrimination nbsp&LGBT individuals face is discrimination from healthcare workers or institutions themselves. A systematic literature review of publications in English and Portuguese from 2004–2014 demonstrate significant difficulties in accessing care secondary to discrimination and homophobia from healthcare professionals. This discrimination can take the form of verbal abuse, disrespectful conduct, refusal of care, the withholding of health information, nbsp&inadequate treatment, and outright violence. In a study analyzing the quality of healthcare for South African {{men who have sex with}} men (MSM), researchers interviewed a cohort of individuals about their health experiences, finding that MSM who identified as homosexual felt their access to healthcare was limited due to an inability to find clinics employing healthcare workers who did not discriminate against their sexuality. They also reportedly faced [...] "homophobic <b>verbal</b> <b>harassment</b> from healthcare workers when presenting for STI treatment". Further, MSM who did not feel comfortable disclosing their sexual activity to healthcare workers failed to identify as homosexuals, which limited the quality of the treatment they received.|$|E
2500|$|Due {{to social}} {{conventions}} and retribution against both victim and perpetrator of non-consensual same-sex sexual conduct and violence against participants in consensual same-sex sexual conduct, this activity was generally unreported. In {{light of the}} law authorities relied on public indecency charges or confessions of monetary exchange (i.e., prostitution, which is illegal), to prosecute same-sex sexual activity. ... LGBT persons often faced abuse and violence from family and nongovernmental actors. From February to April, a wave of violent attacks in Baghdad, Basrah, Samarra, Wasit, and Tikrit targeted individuals perceived to be LGBT.... In early February signs and flyers appeared in Baghdad that threatened persons by name unless they cut their hair, stopped wearing nonconformist clothing, and gave up their [...] "alternative" [...] lifestyles. This intimidation campaign precipitated attacks. Attacks ranged from intimidation and <b>verbal</b> <b>harassment</b> to reports of kidnappings, beatings (some of which resulted in deaths), sexual assault, and killings. Reports varied {{on the number of}} victims killed in the attacks, some of which reportedly were carried out by extremist groups, including the Mahdi Army and League of the Righteous (Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq). UNAMI independently verified the deaths of at least 12 individuals; a Reuters report put the number of victims in Baghdad at 14. Local human rights NGOs reported much higher numbers. ... The government did not acknowledge a pattern of attacks nor take measures to ensure safety for individuals publicly named. ... Due to stigma, intimidation, and potential harm, including violent attacks, LGBT organizations did not operate openly, nor were gay pride marches or gay rights advocacy events held. The law prohibits discrimination based on race, disability, or social status, but it does not address ... sexual orientation or gender identity. Societal discrimination in employment, occupation, and housing based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and unconventional appearance was common. Information was not available regarding discrimination in access to education or health care due to sexual orientation or gender identity, although media reported that students were harassed at school for not adopting conventional clothing or hairstyles. There were minimal government efforts to address this discrimination. At year's end authorities had not announced any other arrests or prosecutions of any persons for violence against LGBT individuals, including cases reported in 2011.|$|E

It is a form of imprisonment." ...|$|R
