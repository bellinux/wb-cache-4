40|$|Aim of the study: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to compare the use of a conven-tional {{underwater}} seal device with suction and a flutter <b>valve</b> drainage <b>bag</b> for pleural drainage after lung surgery. Patients and Methods: Altogether 59 patients undergoing elective lung surgery ex-cept pneumonectomy between February 2001 and April 2002 were prospectively rand-omized to receive postoperative pleural drainage by 28 F chest tube(s) attached to un-derwater seal device placed on negative pressure of 15 cm of water or flutter <b>valve</b> drain-age <b>bag.</b> Following withdrawal of four patients from the study, 55 patients were evalu-ated (31 patients in the underwater seal device group and 24 patients in the flutter <b>valve</b> drainage <b>bag</b> group). Results: In the conventional underwater seal device group the mean drainage time was 2. 6 (SD ± 2. 0) days and in the flutter <b>valve</b> drainage <b>bag</b> group the mean drainage time was 3. 3 days (SD ± 4. 0); difference – 0. 8, 95 % confidence interval (CI) – 2. 4 to 0. 9. The mean length of hospitalization in the surgical ward was 3. 6 (SD ± 2. 7) and 4. 1 (SD ± 4. 4) days respectively (difference – 0. 5, 95 % CI – 2. 5 to 1. 4). Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that flutter valve drainage system is a safe and feasible alternative in managing postoperative air leaks and haemorrhage af-ter lung surgery other than pneumonectomy if air leaks are not extremely massive.

40|$|Introduction: Cardiac arrest {{is one of}} {{the major}} causes of {{increased}} mortality and morbidity worldwide Regarding the occurrence of physiological changes in the vital system of pregnant mothers and reminders, it must be stated that the fact that heart disease in pregnant women can endanger two lives simultaneously, it is clearly indicative of the importance of taking correct remedial and precautionary measures. On the other hand, since the implementation of cardiopulmonary arrest on pregnant women cause incidents, timely and correct remediation is associated with a high percentage of success. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to review the recovery of heart rhythm in pregnant mothers. Methods: In this review article, the databases Medline, Cochrane, Science Direct, and Google Scholar were thoroughly searched to identify the studies investigating Pulmonary cardiopulmonary resuscitation. In this review, the papers published until early January 2017 that were conducted to study the Paget's disease were selected. In searching for the articles, those English papers were selected that had investigated Pulmonary cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Results:. Side effects such as heart rhythm disorders and pulmonary edema usually arise in the context of old heart disease and follow physiological changes in the cardiovascular and pulmonary causes which, unless treated timely and correctly, may lead to cardiac arrest. Conclusion: In case of cardiac arrest, ventilation of pregnant mothers is initially performed by mask and <b>bag</b> <b>valve</b> mask and the oxygen core. If additional ventilation is needed, intubation of the trachea should be done as soon as possible and the ventilation must continue through the tracheal tube and <b>bag</b> <b>valve</b> mask; finally, in case of prolonged cardiac and respiratory difficulty, long-term ventilation can be used.

25|$|Administration {{of oxygen}} at 15 litres per minute by face mask or <b>bag</b> <b>valve</b> mask is often sufficient, but {{tracheal}} intubation with mechanical ventilation may be necessary. Suctioning of pulmonary oedema fluid should be balanced against {{the need for}} oxygenation. The target of ventilation is to achieve 92% to 96% arterial saturation and adequate chest rise. Positive end-expiratory pressure will generally improve oxygenation. Drug administration via peripheral veins is preferred over endotracheal administration. Hypotension remaining after oxygenation may be treated by rapid crystalloid infusion. Cardiac arrest in drowning usually presents as asystole or pulseless electrical activity.
