25|$|After 1510 he {{may have}} lived in London, and it is {{suggested}} that {{he may have}} had some association with the court of Henry VIII. In 1520/21 he was paid by the Dean and Chapter of the Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick, to advise on the purchase and installing of a new organ. By 1525 at the latest Aston was settled and working in Leicester, as a <b>verbatim</b> <b>record</b> of his evidence given to a Bishop’s Visitation on 27 & 28 November 1525 is preserved in the Lincoln Diocesan Records, and he seems to have stayed in Leicester {{for the rest of his}} life. His appointment in Leicester was that of Keeper of the Organs and Magister Choristerorum (Master of the Choristers) at the major Royal foundation, the Hospital and College of St Mary of the Annunciation. This was first established by Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster in 1330, and re-endowed and substantially enlarged by his son Henry, 4th Earl and later 1st Duke of Lancaster under a Charter of 24 March 1355/6. Later known as The Newarke, the institution had a Dean and twelve Canons (later termed Prebends), thirteen Vicars-Choral, four Lay Clerks and six (boy) choristers. By the late 15th century it had achieved a high status and musical reputation and had acquired the privilege, apparently shared only with the Chapels Royal, of having the right to recruit outstanding musicians and singers from other institutions without their consent, in other words to poach the very best musicians of the country. Perhaps the already highly regarded Aston was himself recruited by The Newarke using this privilege, but there seems to be no surviving documentary evidence of exactly how or when he came to be engaged by the Leicester Choral College.|$|E

The Cantonese Chinese CAT system essentially converts phonologically-based shorthand code, or stenograph code, into orthographic representation in Chinese characters. One big challenge in our development of a Cantonese Chinese CAT system is the ambiguity resolution for homophonous Chinese characters that share identical stenograph code. To solve the problem, the bigram model is used as the language model. We implemented the Viterbi algorithm to efficiently compute the most likely Chinese character string for each sequence of stenograph code input. The CAT system is trained with a 0. 85 million character corpus.
