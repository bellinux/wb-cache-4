40|$|Background: Traditional <b>vegetables</b> are {{produced}} and consumed throughout Japan. Individual <b>vegetables,</b> including Kyo <b>vegetables</b> and Kaga <b>vegetables,</b> are individually defined {{with their own}} criteria for history and quality standards and are registered in their respective regions. Several traditional <b>vegetables</b> are utilized as symbols of regional revitalization. For example, Kaga <b>vegetables</b> are tourist attractions, and Noto <b>vegetables</b> are promoted in the Noto region and were registered under the Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS). Methods: We will review the distribution, public standards, and definitions of dento-yasai, traditional Japanese <b>vegetables.</b> Quantitative analysis {{on the status of}} the branding of traditional <b>vegetables</b> will be conducted. Results: First, the ambiguity and distribution of traditional <b>vegetables</b> are demonstrated. Next, as a case study, the results of a quantitative analysis of Kaga <b>vegetables</b> and Noto <b>vegetables</b> are provided. Kaga <b>vegetables</b> have their own quality standards and definition, and producers have acknowledged the positive impact of the regional certification, GIAHS, on the amount sold. However, a social conflict has been caused by their standards and definition. On the other hand, Noto <b>vegetables</b> do not have a strict quality standard, and they were registered relatively recently. Because of their comparatively lax standard, producers could not acknowledge the positive impacts of GIAHS certification. Conclusion: Origins of traditional Japanese <b>vegetables</b> and relationships with their regions have innumerable ambiguous points. The results of the analysis of two types of traditional <b>vegetables</b> show that quality standards and definitions strongly influence branding and brand management...|$|R
