5|$|Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels is a 1986 side-scrolling, {{platform}} {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Nintendo as the first sequel to their 1985 bestseller Super Mario Bros.

The Lost Levels also introduces setbacks such as poison mushroom power-ups, counterproductive level warps, and mid-air wind gusts. The game has 32 levels across eight worlds, and five bonus worlds.|$|E

The Jets' new home, MetLife Stadium, opened to the public in April 2010. The stadium took 34 months to construct, and can seat 82,500.

5|$|The Lost Levels is a side-scrolling, {{platformer}} action game {{similar in}} style and gameplay to the original 1985 Super Mario Bros., save {{for an increase in}} difficulty. As in the original, Mario (or Luigi) <b>venture</b> <b>to</b> rescue the Princess from Bowser. The player jumps between platforms, avoids enemy and inanimate obstacles, finds hidden secrets (such as warp zones and vertical vines), and collects power-ups like the mushroom (which makes Mario grow), the Fire Flower (which lets Mario throw fireballs), and the Invincibility Star. Unlike the original, there is no two-player mode but at the title screen, the player chooses between the twin plumbers, who are differentiated for the first time: Luigi, designed for skilled players, has less ground friction and higher jump height, while Mario is faster.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea for}} {{assembling}} {{a team of}} Māori footballers to tour Britain was conceived by Joseph Warbrick, a rugby player who had toured with the first New Zealand national team in 1884. He initially proposed a team of Māori or part-Māori to play the touring British side in 1888; this developed into a <b>venture</b> <b>to</b> have a Māori team tour Britain if a preliminary tour of New Zealand were successful. Hearing of Warbrick's plans, civil servant Thomas Eyton contacted him to offer help managing the tour, which Warbrick accepted. When James Scott, a publican, subsequently joined the partnership, the three men decided that Warbrick would be the team's captain, Scott its manager and Eyton its promoter.|$|E

5|$|Buenos Aires {{attempted}} to retain {{influence over the}} settlement by installing a garrison, but a mutiny in 1832 was followed the next year {{by the arrival of}} British forces who reasserted Britain's rule. The Argentine Confederation (headed by Buenos Aires Governor Juan Manuel de Rosas) protested against Britain's actions, and Argentine governments have continued since then to register official protests against Britain. The British troops departed after completing their mission, leaving the area without formal government. Vernet's deputy, the Scotsman Matthew Brisbane, returned to the islands that year to restore the business, but his efforts ended after, amid unrest at Port Louis, gaucho Antonio Rivero led a group of dissatisfied individuals to murder Brisbane and the settlement's senior leaders; survivors hid in a cave on a nearby island until the British returned and restored order. In 1840, the Falklands became a Crown colony, and Scottish settlers subsequently established an official pastoral community. Four years later, nearly everyone relocated to Port Jackson, considered a better location for government, and merchant Samuel Lafone began a <b>venture</b> <b>to</b> encourage British colonisation.|$|E
5|$|During their suspension, Mulder and Scully <b>venture</b> <b>to</b> Hollywood to {{view the}} {{production}} of Federman's film.

After filming is done, Mulder and Scully attend a screening of the film with Skinner, but are thoroughly disgusted at how their case, and they, are portrayed on the big screen. Mulder and Scully leave the set holding hands, presumably {{on their way to}} dinner with the FBI credit card Skinner gave them after watching the movie, hinting at the continued romantic relationship between Mulder and Scully that has been suggested in the last few episodes. As the agents leave, the dead who were resting underneath the film set are revived and begin to dance passionately, reinforcing a theory Mulder made earlier in the episode.|$|E
