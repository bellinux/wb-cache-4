40|$|Abstract: We {{illustrate}} the valuable {{information provided by}} echocardiography for hemodynamic monitoring and for optimizing ventilatory strategies, during ARDS. Although the transthoracic and the transesophageal routes can be used, we always prefer, {{in the absence of}} contraindications, to perform transesophageal echocardiography. ARDS includes numerous affections which brutally damage the interface between the distal airway tract and pulmonary vascular bed. Two factors combine to produce right ventricular systolic overload, the pathologic features of the syndrome per se and mechanical ventilation. Acute cor pulmonale (ACP) reflects the severity of the pulmonary disease, but may also be caused or exacerbated by an aggressive and unsuitable ventilatory strategy. With tidal <b>volume</b> <b>limitation,</b> the incidence of ACP has declined to 25 %. Providing that ventilatory management is adapted to right ventricular function, ACP is no longer significantly associated with increased mortality. If not, it is demonstrated that right ventricular dysfunction is actually associated with a poor prognosis. In conclusion, whereas some have promoted a lung protective approach, echocardiography allows us to promote a right ventricular protective approach, by adapting respiratory settings to right ventricular function, which is key in the prognosis of these patients...|$|E

We have shown in a series of studies on patients with acute lung failure and in the perioperative period that application of alveolar recruitment strategy (ARS) improves compliance of respiratory system and prevents its deterioration during surgery, that repeated use of lung RM improves oxygenation in subacute phase of adult respiratory distress syndrome and that combined assessment of quasistatic compliance of respiratory system and the estimate of the extent of recruitment/ derecruitment -estimated lung recruitment may be used for predicting changes in lung shunt due to positive end-expiratory pressure changes in ARDS patients.

An effective coordination of these vehicles {{can take advantage of}} the strengths of both, while mediate each other's weaknesses. In particular, a micro UAV typically has limited flight time due to its weak payload capacity. To take advantage of the mobility and sensor coverage of a micro UAV in long range, long duration surveillance mission, a UGV can act as a mobile station for recharging or battery swap, and the ability to perform autonomous docking is a prerequisite for such operations. This work presents an approach to coordinate an autonomous docking between a quadrotor UAV and a skid-steered UGV. A joint controller is designed to eliminate the relative position error between the vehicles. The controller is validated in simulations and successful landing is achieved in indoor environment, as well as outdoor settings with standard sensors and real disturbances. Another goal for this work is to improve the autonomy of UAV-UGV teams in positioning denied environments, a very common scenarios for many robotics applications. In such environments, Simultaneous Mapping and Localization~(SLAM) capability is the foundation for all autonomous operations.

While developing financial models to price these services {{it is important to}} include the impact of Vehicle to Grid operation on the power-delivery components of these Electric Vehicles. Considerable amount of academic research has been focused on understanding the impact of Vehicle to Grid operation on Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs). However, information about the impact of Vehicle to Grid operation on the fuel cells (FCs) of Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs) and Fuel Cell Range Extender Electric Vehicles (FCREEVs) is scarce. Long term tests are required to asses the impact of Vehicle to Grid operation on these fuel cells. The fuel tank <b>volume</b> <b>limitation</b> of the TU Delft Hyundai FCEV does not allow for long term Vehicle to Grid experiments using the operational Vehicle to Grid set-up at the TU Delft Green Village site. Furthermore, there exist limited control over the power management strategy programmed in the Hyundai FCEV; the power management strategy defining the load cycle it’s Fuel Cell undergoes in Vehicle to Grid operation.

The apparatus, technique of operation and analysis of results are described. The interaction of sound with binary liquid mixtures is {{discussed in terms of}} (a) perturbing stoichiometric chemical equilibria, and (b) interacting with non-stoichiometric concentrations, and a survey is made of previous applications of these ideas to suvh mixtures. The water-rich, plateau', region defined by ultrasonic absorption, over which absorption is effectively independent of alcohol concentration, is investigated for a number of alcohol - water systems The extent of this region is correlated with the stereochemistry of the alcohol and with a <b>volume</b> <b>limitation</b> by water. The excess absorption is linked with incipient phase-separation, using as probe a partially-miscible ternary system. Analysis of the frequency-dependence of absorption in each alcohol - water system produces two relaxation frequencies, each effectively independent of alcohol and each exhibiting a minimum near the highly sound-absorbing composition. These features are consistent with the interpretation that the process perturbed is a hydrophobic association of alcohol, rate-controlled by water. Concentration-fluctuation theories of frequency-dependence could be applied satisfactorily only to the partially-miscible ternary system mentioned above. 1, 3 -Dioxolane-water mixtures produce excess ultrasonic absorption, with features reminiscent both of alcohol- and acetonitrilc-water mixtures. Urea-water mixtures appear to show a low-frequency relaxation process. Amide- water mixtures, including urea-water mixtures, possess minima in sound absorption as a function of composition. Alkyl-substited amides also exhibit maxima, the intensities of which reflect the size of the alkyl substituent, as with alcohol-water mixtures. Investigation of alcohol-acetonitrile-water ternary systems shows that the processes which produce sound absorption in alcohol-water and acetonitrile-water mixtures are dissimilar, and incompatible in the ternary system. Finally, relative partial molar volumes in a number alcohol-water systems have been computed from literature density data, leading to correlations with maximum density effects...|$|E
40|$|Glass is {{considered}} a vitreous supercooled liquid that is in a thermodynamically metastable state between the molten liquid state and the crystalline state. Different glass structures {{are influenced by the}} thermal history of the cooling process. In 1932, Zachariasen established the continuous random network (CRN) paradigm for the structure of glass in which the random structure of glass {{is similar to that of}} liquid. Prior to Zachariasen, diffraction patterns observed by Lebedev indicated that glass structures are comprised of microcrystallites approximately 20 angstrom in size. According to the microcrystalline hypothesis, these microcrystallite domins are linked by amorphous interlayers. This debate on the predominant feature of glass structure (i. e. whether it exists in an ordered state) has lasted for more than half a century. Great efforts have been invested to develop a universal model to represent all glass structures. However, the concept of a universal structure model is incompatible with the fact that the vitreous state is in a thermodynamically metastable state because a specific structure can only arise in a thermodynamically stable state. To date, theories proposed on glass structures are based on various models rather than on the variability and diversity of glass structures in thermodynamically metastable states. The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) International defines glass as "an inorganic product of fusion which has cooled to a rigid condition without crystallizing. " Therefore, glass structures lie between a melt state and a glassy state which may have undetectable microcrystalline domains. The gradual transformation from glass to crystal is controlled by local fluctuations in the structural order, the formation of a nucleus, and crystal growth. A fuzzy mathematical method can distinguish between glass and crystal better than a logical criterion based on a quantitative <b>volume</b> <b>limitation.</b> Therefore, the controversy surrounding the aforementioned hypotheses by Zachariasen and Lebedev lies in the estimation of the degree of order or disorder, i. e., whether the structure of glass is more ordered ("microcrystallite" hypothesis) or more disordered ("random network" hypothesis). While whether or not glass is an ordered state has long been a topic of debate, the structure-properties relationships are not much addressed. In recent years, we propose a phase diagram model that effectively explains various glass structures. Based on infrared spectroscopy, Raman and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements, as well as the physical properties of relevant compounds in phase diagrams (e. g. density and refractive index), we conclude that glasses and crystalline congruent compounds exhibit similar NMR data and spectral features in a phase diagram. Thus, it is reasonable to consider glass as a product of mixed melts of nearest-neighbor congruent compounds in a phase diagram. Most importantly, the properties of glass can be calculated via the lever rule by applying the additive properties that can predict the structural units of glass with mutually miscible or immiscible phases. Based on NMR data, we are capable of predicting glass properties by employing the phase diagram model using data on congruent compounds through the additive properties of several binary and ternary borate systems such as Li 2 O 3 -B 2 O 3, Na 2 O-B 2 O 3, K 2 O 3 -B 2 O 3, BaO-B 2 O 3, La 2 O 3 -B 2 O 3, Na 2 O-B 2 O 3 -V 2 O 5, Na 2 O-B 2 O 3 -GeO 2, Na 2 O-B 2 O 3 -MgO and K 2 O-B 2 O 3 -Al 2 O 3. The authors also calculated the [BO 4]/[B 2 O 3] ratios in binary and ternary borate systems. The calculated results confirm the experimental data. Moreover, estimates based on the refractive index and density using the same model, are also well consistent with the experimental data. For some other glass systems where NMR could not be used, e. g., the Na 2 O-CaO-SiO 2 system, the refractive index and density calculated from the nearest congruent compounds match well with the experimental data. Further, this approach can be used to determine the relationship between glass compositions and properties in multi-component glass systems. This review summarizes the recent progress made in understanding glass structure and describes the technological developments driven by this new information. The review is organized as follows: Sections 1 - 4 introduce the classical approaches to understanding glass structure, outline the fundamental thermodynamic characteristics of glass, discuss the Krogh-Moe's structural model approach, summarize measurements of glasses using IR, Raman and NMR spectral measurements, and introduce the basics of the phase diagram structural model of glass. Section 5 presents a detailed description of the phase diagram structural model of glass, a universal analytical model from the thermodynamic perspective, the phase diagram, and spectral measurements that elucidate the new structural model of glass and its relevant novel physical and chemical properties. Section 6 discusses the phase diagram structural model of silicate glass and other oxide glass systems, as well as their properties. Finally, Section 7 discusses the universal character of the phase diagram structural model for glass from both the thermodynamic and phase diagram kinetic perspectives. The conclusions of this review are then summarized in Section 8, which include: (I) the vitreous state is in a thermodynamic metastable state, and a fuzzy mathematical method is better to distinguish glass from crystal than a logical criterion of quantitative <b>volume</b> <b>limitation.</b> Neither the "crystalline" hypothesis nor the "random network" hypothesis is a universal structural model for glass. (2) Glasses and crystalline congruent compounds in a phase diagram exhibit similar NMR data and spectral structures. (3) In a phase diagram structural approach, binary glass {{is considered}} to be a mixture of the melts of the two nearest congruent compounds in a binary phase diagram. The structures and properties of glass can be predicted and calculated from the properties of the two congruent compounds by applying the lever rule. (4) Ternary glass is composed of a mixture of the three nearest congruent compounds in a ternary phase diagram. The structures and properties of the resulting glass can be predicted and calculated from the characteristics of the three congruent compounds. (5) In addition to borate and silicate glasses, the phase diagram structure approach could be applied to chalcogenide, halogenide, and metallic glasses. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|It {{is noted}} {{that due to}} {{restrictions}} of payload and <b>volume</b> <b>limitations</b> of current and projected launch systems, space construction of ultralarge space structures is essential. The present paper discusses the concepts of a key piece of construction equipment needed to support assembly of such large structures. Attention {{is given to the}} manned remote work station (MRWS), a universal crew cabin {{to be used as a}} construction cherry picker, space crane turret, work station on a construction base rail system, or a free flyer. Concepts and safety and rescue requirements for this spacecraft are delineated for early applications in support of Shuttle operations, as well as applications in support of a mid to late 1980 's space construction base. Finally, applications in support of constructing and maintaining a solar power satellite system are covered...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{performed}} to analytically determine the cyclic thermomechanical behavior and fatigue life of three configurations of a Plug Nozzle Thrust Chamber. This thrust chamber is a test model which represents the current trend in nozzle design calling for high performance coupled with weight and <b>volume</b> <b>limitations</b> as well as extended life for reusability. The study involved the use of different materials and material combinations to evaluate their application {{to the problem of}} low-cycle fatigue in the thrust chamber. The thermal and structural analyses were carried out on a three-dimensional basis. Results are presented which show plots of continuous temperature histories and temperature distributions at selected times during the operating cycle of the thrust chamber. Computed structural data show critical regions for low-cycle fatigue and the histories of strain within the regions for each operation cycle...|$|R
30|$|We {{used the}} Amberchrome CG 161 M™ resin (Rohm and Haas Company, Philadelphia, PA, USA) for {{cytokine}} removal {{as described by}} Cataluppi et al. [28]. Recombinant resistin and serum lots were identical for all experiments. Briefly, resin was activated with 50 % methanol and extensively washed with PBS before use. One inch inner diameter chromatography columns (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) were treated with Sigmacote™ and washed with distilled water before use. Primed chromatography columns were packed with 2  mL of activated resin and circulated human serum without or with 100  ng/mL recombinant resistin at a flow rate of 0.3  mL/min using a peristaltic pump. Samples {{were removed from the}} reservoir at 60, 120, and 180  min. Serum samples before and after resin adsorption therapy (RAT) were kept at − 80  °C for ROS testing and transwell migration assay. Other neutrophil function assays were not possible due to sample <b>volume</b> <b>limitations.</b>|$|R
