The detection system employs biotin-labeled probes to capture the DNA segments that contain specific regions of the genes for VT 1 and VT 2 by DNA-DNA hybridization. The hybrids formed were isolated by streptavidin-coated magnetic beads which were collected by a magnetic particle separator and, subsequently, amplified directly by conventional PCR. The detection system was found to be specific for VTEC: no amplification was obtained from non-VTEC controls, whereas VTEC isolates tested positive for one or two specific PCR products. With 5, 7, or 10 h of enrichment, the limits of detection were 103, 102, and 100 CFU/ml, respectively, by agarose gel electrophoresis. Southern hybridization did not seem to improve the limit of the detection. When applied to food, MCH-PCR was capable of detecting 100 CFU of VTEC per g of ground beef with 15 h of nonselective enrichment.

Strain VTEC and EHEC have been isolated from human and various animal species, mainly ruminants and pigs. The prevalence of VTEC in cattle is 35 %, milk 10 %, cheese 1. 5 %. In beef meat, pork, poultry, goat and sheep is 3. 7, 1. 5, 1. 5, 2 and 2. 5 %, respectively.

Verotoxin in human, ruminants and piglets causes bloody diarrhea so with ruminants. In the adult ruminants, verotoxin results in clinical signs and they act as asymptomatic carriers of VTEC and EHEC strains but in human, it produced haemorrhagic colitis (HC), haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and thrombocytopenia purpura (TPP).

This study was conducted to determine the occurrence of verotoxigenic E. coli and antibiotic resistance of the isolates from vegetables. Materials and methods: A total of 500 fresh vegetable samples were collected randomly from retail shops in Shahrekord, Iran. E. coli was isolated and identified using bacteriological and biochemical tests. PCR method was used to identify the rbfE, stx 1, stx 2 and eae genes. Also, antibiotic resistance of the isolates was determined by disk diffusion method. Results: The results represented that among 25 isolates possess virulence genes, 40, 12 and 4 % of the isolates contained eaeA, STx 2, and both genes, respectively. But none of them contained H 7, STx 1, and rfbE genes. The antibiotic resistance pattern demonstrated that the isolates were highly resistant to Gentamycin and cefotoxime.

In the presence of <b>Escherichia</b> <b>coli</b> O 111, the aptamer was dissociated from the capture probe-aptamer duplex due to the stronger interaction between the aptamer and the <b>Escherichia</b> <b>coli</b> O 111.

A total of 199 proposed water samples were collected and analysed by the Miniaturised Most Probable Numbers method using 96 -well micro-titre plates to enumerate <b>Escherichia</b> <b>coli</b> from the water samples. Twenty eight of 199 water samples were also analysed with a multiplex polymerase chain reaction using specific primers for the identification of diarrhoeagenic <b>Escherichia</b> <b>coli</b> related virulent genes namely – Mdh for commensal E. coli, Eagg and pCVD for Enteroaggregative E. coli, ST 1 and LT 1 for Enterotoxigenic E. coli, Stx 1 and Stx 2 for Enterohaemorrhaegic E. coli, EaeA for Enteropathogenic E. coli and Enterohaemorrhagic E. coli, Ial for Enteroinvasive E. coli. River water samples were directly filtered and 100 -mℓ of filtered water samples were extracted while 1 -mℓ pre-cultured <b>Escherichia</b> <b>coli</b> from storm run-off samples were extracted for use in the multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Because of the villages along the Nwanedi River catchment, Enteropathogenic E. coli followed by Enterotoxigenic E. coli was suspected to be the dominant diarrhoeagenic <b>Escherichia</b> <b>coli.</b> Contrary to this Enteroaggregative E. coli (54 %) was dominant followed by Enterohaemorrhaegic E. coli (29 %), Enteroinvasive E. coli (7 %), Enteropathogenic E. coli (4 %) and Enterotoxigenic E. coli (4 %) respectively, in the surface water samples. The <b>Escherichia</b> <b>coli</b> numbers were significantly higher in storm run-off compared to the river water samples. Literature report Enteroaggregative E. coli to be associated with diarrhoea in HIV/AIDS patients, to whom its dominance in the surface water samples could pose serious infection risk to the Nwanedi River catchment communities, more especially the young, elderly and the immuno-compromised at the period of sampling if the waters are used untreated. The high <b>Escherichia</b> <b>coli</b> numbers could possibly be the results of continuous faecal contamination into the water sources and the rain storm events carrying faecal materials from land surface. Results show that Nwanedi River catchment waters harbour pathogens indicated by diarrhoeagenic <b>Escherichia</b> <b>coli</b> occurrence as well as commensal <b>Escherichia</b> <b>coli</b> numbers, which suggest the possible infection risk posed to the consumers if the waters are used untreated.
