50|$|The land {{on which}} the {{original}} village and the pit itself stood (along with {{the site of the}} cokeworks, Andrews House Colliery and Bowes Bridge MPD) has lain empty since the colliery was demolished, although the foundations of a number of buildings, a few old concrete lamp-posts, some of the tub lines, and the concrete caps covering the backfilled shafts are still clearly visible. The upcast shaft is on top of the hill overlooking the yard of the Tanfield Railway, and the two caps covering the coal-drawing shafts {{can be found in a}} gully just to the north of it, hidden among the trees. Until around 2010, the metal floor tiles of the pit head baths were still in situ, but have since been removed by scrap thieves. The stables are easily identifiable, with drainage channels running down the centre, and post-holes where the stalls would have been. The steps leading up to the door of the colliery's office block are still in situ, and Peruvian Lilies can still be found where the flower beds at the front of the building were. Considerable numbers of Crocosmia and Lupins can also be found growing in the area where the screens and headgear of the coal-drawing shafts once stood, most likely as a result of somebody tipping garden waste. The NCB sign which stood at the entrance to the colliery yard is now on display in the Tanfield Railway's carriage shed. Almost thirty years after closure, nature has largely reclaimed the site, with an abundance of wildlife having taken up residence, and the area is well known locally for the rich pickings to be had when blackberries are in season. However, the entire area remains covered in spoil from the two collieries (as does the site of Byermoor Colliery) and there is still a considerable amount of junk, such as steel toe-capped wellingtons, compressed air hoses and <b>ventilation</b> <b>ducting</b> lying around in the undergrowth. Fly tipping has also been a problem, with a notable incident occurring on the Tanfield Railway's coal train day in October 1998, when a vast heap of tyres which had been dumped in the gill adjacent to the site of the cokeworks was set alight. The fire destroyed a number of trees, and was visible from trains on the incline between Bobgins Crossing and Andrews House Station. The land is now owned by UK Coal, and a sign by the gate on St. Cuthbert's Road bearing the company's former name (RJB Mining) warns against fly-tipping.|$|E

In order to compare various prediction techniques {{that have been}} developed over the past, a macroscopic investigation of air leakage and friction resistance of auxiliary <b>ventilation</b> <b>ducting</b> systems has been undertaken. Measurements were conducted on 450 and 915 mm diameter fabric ducting over 100 m duct length to determine frictional resistances and the extent of leakage. Due to the high degree of accuracy required and the large volume of data that needed to be collected, electronic pressure transducers were used with computer for data recording. Conceptual models that describe the leakage characteristics of auxiliary <b>ventilation</b> <b>ducting</b> systems were developed based on this information. It was found that these models provided good correlation with most of the existing prediction techniques.

Simple source apportionment analysis was conducted based on a simplified materials balance equation to identify sources of the indoor VOC accumulation and their contributions from building material-related sources, occupant-related sources and the outdoors. The average emission rate of TVOCs from building materials was 0. 19 mug. m(- 2). s(- 1) and that from the occupants was 5 mug. s(- 1) per person. The TVOC emission rate from ventilation ductwork was 0. 21 mug. s(- 1). During the daytime, the building material-related TVOC sources and the occupant-related TVOC sources each contributed 17. 5 and 14. 9 % by weight to the total indoor TVOC accumulation, respectively, with the remaining 67. 5 % coming from the outdoor sources.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical and experimental {{study on the}} implementation of active noise and vibration control on a <b>ventilation</b> <b>duct.</b> <b>Ventilation</b> systems radiate noise at the duct outlets and from the duct walls. In many practical applications, <b>ventilation</b> <b>ducts</b> are installed without shielding, although, they often run through corridors and adjacent rooms or halls to be ventilated. Thus both air- and structure-borne disturbances are a cause of acoustic discomfort for the occupants. In this study the combined active control of air- and structure-borne noise is examined. For the theoretical study, a section of a circular <b>ventilation</b> <b>duct</b> is modeled via structural-mobility and acoustic-impedance formulations, where the interior fluid-structure coupling and sound radiation to the outside is modeled using an elemental approach. The control performance is evaluated {{in terms of the}} far field sound power radiated from the duct outlet and from the duct wall. For the experimental study, a laboratory duct set-up equipped with an axial ventilator and a ring of four control loudspeakers is used.

To address this issue industry has invested substantial resources in developing technologies such as continuous haulage and bolting cycle automation.

40|$|Abstract. For {{the complex}} status of fluid flow in stator radial <b>ventilation</b> <b>ducts</b> of large turbo-generator, the {{temperature}} distribution of stator is dramatically {{affected by the}} flow status of cooling medium in stator ventilating ducts. In this paper, a new ventilating ducts structure in stator is investigated. According to fixing a wind deflector on the stator teeth adjacent to the <b>ventilation</b> <b>ducts,</b> the fluid flow status of cooling air is changed flowing in stator <b>ventilation</b> <b>ducts.</b> For this reason, the effect of heat transfer in stator is changed. Taking an air-cooled turbo-generator as an example, considering the characteristics of fluid flow and heat transfer in turbo-generator ventilation system, the three-dimensional fluid flow and heat transfer coupling model is established. Using finite volume method, three-dimensional fluid field and temperature field control equations are coupling solved. Based on this, the velocity distribution in ventilating ducts is obtained. Besides that, the velocity distribution is studied with the cooling air flows into radial <b>ventilation</b> <b>ducts</b> at different incident angles. The influences of wind deflector and incident angles on the fluid velocity and temperature distribution are analyzed. Based on that, some useful conclusions are obtained...|$|R
