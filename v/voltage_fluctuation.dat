Both Alonso and Marques again ran strongly in the race running in the mid-field before both drivers retired after three-quarter distance with mechanical issues. At the Canadian Grand Prix Alonso had originally qualified in twenty-first but had his fastest qualifying lap time disallowed because of a front wing technical infringement and was required to start behind team-mate Marques in twenty-second. Marques equalled his best result {{of the season with}} a ninth-place finish despite struggling from blistering tyres and broken bargeboard mountings in the race's final ten laps, whilst Alonso retired after seven laps because of a broken driveshaft CV joint. The cars again occupied the back row of the grid at the European Grand Prix with Alonso ahead of Marques. The PS01s were both nearly four seconds off the polesitter's time, but only four-thousands of a second behind Button. Marques retired after completing seven laps from a <b>voltage</b> <b>fluctuation</b> in his electronics system which broke his gearbox and shut down his engine, whilst Alonso moved from twenty-first to finish fourteenth. Alonso outqualified Marques by four tenths of a second in the French Grand Prix and both drivers again shared the back row of the grid.

40|$|Department of Electrical EngineeringAs {{the speed}} of I/O {{interface}} has increased up to multi-gigabit data rates [1], the research of signal integrity issues for the I/O channel is more demanding. The statistical approach to get jitter in time domain can reduce computational time and effort compared to the typical transient SPICE simulations. In this paper, the output voltage waveforms of the multi-stage buffers are calculated with simpler analytical solutions. The driving non-linear MOSFETs are replaced by Thevenin equivalent voltages and impedances, and the solutions of differential equations can be simply expressed with corresponding impulse responses. Also, the jitter induced by the supply <b>voltage</b> <b>fluctuations</b> can be calculated. The supply <b>voltage</b> <b>fluctuations</b> in the time domain are directly convolved with the impulse responses to obtain the output waveforms. The validation of the proposed analytic method is done by experiments. In the experiments, the <b>voltage</b> <b>fluctuations</b> in time domain are measured both at the integrated circuit (IC) and printed circuit board (PCB) pads simultaneously. Then, the on-chip supply <b>voltage</b> <b>fluctuations</b> are extracted from the measured results. The Power Distribution Network (PDN) of the IC and PCB are modeled from impedance measurements on the pads. Using the PDN model, the measured power and ground <b>voltage</b> <b>fluctuations</b> are validated with the SPICE simulation. The output off-chip channel of the victim buffer can be modeled as parasitic inductances and capacitances from the measured two-port S-parameters at the designed PCB channel. As the number of buffer stages connected to the fluctuating supply voltages are varied from one to three in the experiments, {{the effect on the}} output waveform induced by supply <b>voltage</b> <b>fluctuations</b> can be investigated. The calculated step responses and jitter PDFs of the multi-stage buffers are all validated with measured output waveforms and jitter histograms. In addition, the Electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection structures which are commonly employed at near the I/O pins can induce parasitic junction capacitance (CESD) and parasitic resistance (RESD) causing parasitic effects. Thus, the supply <b>voltage</b> <b>fluctuations</b> also can couple through ESD parasitic. The step responses of a linear output driver with silicon interposer channel are derived including the parasitics of ESD protection circuits. The probability density functions of the output voltage due to supply <b>voltage</b> <b>fluctuations</b> are also analytically calculated. With changing the frequency of supply <b>voltage</b> <b>fluctuations,</b> the effect of ESD parasitics on the output jitter is calculated and compared. ope...|$|R
