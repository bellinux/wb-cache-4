With the aid of catalysts, and at room temperatures, the alkaline hydrolysis of NaBH 4 can be enhanced [2]. In this work, a 100 L innovative reactor for hydrogen production was designed, based on the optimized layout of a laboratorial scale reactor [3], as part of a project financed by the Portuguese financial support program NSRF.

The NaBH 4 solution is stored in a 50 L reservoir from where seven consecutive 7, 0 L injections to the reactor are possible.
