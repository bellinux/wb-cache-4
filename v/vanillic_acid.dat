Among numerous bioactive compounds in the red wine, there is a large group of polyphenols, which are considered to be responsible for the health beneficial activity.

40|$|The {{influence}} of seven phenolic compounds, normally present in wine, {{on the growth}} and arginine deiminase system (ADI) of Lactobacillus hilgardii X 1 B, a wine lactic acid bacterium, was established. This system provides energy for bacterial growth and produces citrulline that reacts with ethanol forming the carcinogen ethyl carbamate (EC), found in some wines. The {{influence of}} phenolic compounds on bacterial growth was compound dependent. Growth and final pH values increased in presence of arginine. Arginine consumption decreased in presence of protocatechuic and gallic acids (31 and 17 %, respectively) and increased in presence of quercetin, rutin, catechin and the caffeic and <b>vanillic</b> phenolic <b>acids</b> (between 10 and 13 %, respectively). ADI enzyme activities varied in presence of phenolic compounds. Rutin, quercetin and caffeic and <b>vanillic</b> <b>acids</b> stimulated the enzyme arginine deiminase about 37 - 40 %. Amounts of 200 mg/L gallic and protocatechuic acids inhibited the arginine deiminase enzyme between 53 and 100 %, respectively. Ornithine transcarbamylase activity was not modified at all concentrations of phenolic compounds. As gallic and protocatechuic acids inhibited the arginine deiminase enzyme that produces citrulline, precursor of EC, these results are important considering the formation of toxic compounds...|$|R

Effects were seen primarily on roots at 200 and 400 µM for most of the compounds. Supported liquid membrane technique was adopted to extract several plant and microbial metabolites in situ in the greenhouse. The method was then used to study the nutrient solution in tomato, cucumber and gerbera crops, which were grown in closed growing systems including artificial infection of root pathogenic fungi and/or selected disinfestation methods, namely slow sand filtration and UV-radiation. They were investigated at different developmental stages and compounds were determined in the range of 10 - 200 nM in the nutrient solutions.
