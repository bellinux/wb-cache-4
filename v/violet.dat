5|$|Lesser Roman Catholic prelates use {{a variety}} of colors. <b>Violet</b> hats were once {{actually}} worn by certain monsignors, and so in heraldry they have used a <b>violet</b> hat with red or <b>violet</b> tassels in varying numbers, currently fixed at six on each side. The lowest grade of monsignor, a Chaplain of His Holiness, uses a black hat with <b>violet</b> tassels. The superior general of an order displays a black galero with six tassels on each side, while provincial superiors and abbots use a black galero with six or three tassels on each side, although Norbertines (White Canons) use a white galero. Although a priest would rarely assume arms unless he had an ancestral right to arms independent of his clerical state, a priest would use a simple black ecclesiastical hat with a single tassel on each side. Priests who hold an office such as rector would have two tassels on each side.|$|E

5|$|Ultra <b>Violet,</b> {{according}} to her somewhat unreliable report, interviewed her. Solanas was then known as Onz Loh.

5|$|Although {{there are}} many Cortinarius species {{with some degree of}} <b>violet</b> colour, C.violaceus and its close {{relatives}} are easily distinguished by their much darker purple colour. Cortinarius iodes of the southeastern United States has a slimy purple cap and paler <b>violet</b> stipe. The other species in the section Cortinarius are dark purple and superficially similar, but can be differentiated based on host and geography as they do not occur in the same locations as C. violaceus. Certain Leptonia species in northwestern North America, including L. carnea and L. nigroviolacea, have a similar color, but are easily differentiated due to their pink spore print.|$|E

5|$|An optical phenomenon, {{known as}} a green flash, can {{sometimes}} be seen shortly after sunset or before sunrise. The flash is caused by light from the Sun just below the horizon being bent (usually through a temperature inversion) towards the observer. Light of shorter wavelengths (<b>violet,</b> blue, green) is bent more than that of longer wavelengths (yellow, orange, red) but the <b>violet</b> and blue light is scattered more, leaving light that is perceived as green.|$|E
