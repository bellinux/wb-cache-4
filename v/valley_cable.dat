5000|$|CRN {{was founded}} in 1983 as Cable Radio Network to provide {{commercial}} radio programming to local cable television systems. CRN founder Michael Horn (who, at the time, was an on-air personality at Los Angeles’ KFI AM) read an article in trade publication Radio & Records that mentioned Los Angeles radio station KMET earned ratings points in the Phoenix market. Horn learned KMET was the audio source for a channel on a local cable system in Phoenix. Horn brought the radio-on-television idea to San Fernando <b>Valley</b> <b>cable</b> provider King Cable, where he soon programmed a country music channel. Seeking a more mass appeal, Horn changed the channel’s format to oldies music. Two other cable systems - <b>Valley</b> <b>Cable</b> and Falcon Cable - then became interested. Broadcast hookups were initially conducted through phone lines before the method became cost prohibitive. Horn invested more money and switched to satellite transmission. A branding change from [...] "Cable Radio Network" [...] to [...] "CRN Networks" [...] eventually followed. Noncommercial music channels from companies such as Digital Planet and DMX eventually were picked up by cable providers. Instead of competing with them, Horn switched CRN’s programming to a talk radio platform. CRN Networks then became [...] "CRN Talk" [...] and, in 2007, [...] "CRN Digital Talk Radio." [...] Horn commissioned a company that worked with Arbitron (now Nielsen Audio) to determine CRN’s listenership. Results indicated that CRN shared a similar-size audience as MSNBC, Cinemax, and Fox Sports.|$|E

40|$|International audienceShaking by {{moderate}} to large earthquakes in the Mediterranean Sea has proved {{in the past}} to potentially trigger catastrophic sediment collapse and flow. On 21 May 2003, a magnitude 6. 8 earthquake located near Boumerdès (central Algerian coast) triggered large turbidity currents responsible for 29 submarine cable breaks {{at the foot of the}} continental slope over ~ 150 km from west to east. Seafloor bathymetry and backscatter imagery show the potential imprints of the 2003 event and of previous events. Large slope scarps resulting from active deformation may locally enhance sediment instabilities, although faults are not directly visible at the seafloor. Erosion is evident at the foot of the margin and along the paths of the numerous canyons and <b>valleys.</b> <b>Cable</b> breaks are located at the outlets of submarine valleys and in areas of turbiditic levee overspilling and demonstrate the multi-source and multi-path character of the 2003 turbiditic event. Rough estimates of turbidity flow velocity are not straightforward because of the multiple breaks along the same cable, but seem compatible with those measured in other submarine cable break studies elsewhere. While the signature of the turbidity currents is mostly erosional on the continental slope, turbidite beds alternating with hemipelagites accumulate in the distal reaches of sediment dispersal systems. In perspective, more chronological work on distal turbidite successions offshore Algeria offers promising perspectives for paleoseismology reconstructions based on turbidite dating, if synchronous turbidites along independent sedimentary dispersal systems are found to support triggering by major earthquakes. Preliminary results on sediment core PSM-KS 23 off Boumerdès typically show a 800 -yr interval between turbidites during the Holocene, in accordance with the estimated mean seismic cycle on land, even if at this stage it is not yet possible to prove the earthquake origin of all the turbidites...|$|R

Although Fox supported the idea, the conversion plan never materialized, and the station continues to operate as a low-power outlet. The Palm Springs market has only two full-power commercial stations (NBC affiliate KMIR-TV (channel 36) and ABC affiliate KESQ-TV (channel 42)); however, rather than settling for an affiliation {{with one of the}} area's low-power outlets, CBS opted to relay its programming to the Coachella <b>Valley</b> via <b>cable</b> through Los Angeles owned-and-operated station KCBS-TV (channel 2) or KFMB-TV (channel 8) in San Diego. The network would not have an over-the-air affiliate in Palm Springs until Desert Television signed on KPSP-LP (channel 38) in September 2002.

50|$|Porthcurno {{is unusually}} {{well known for}} its size because of its history as a major {{international}} submarine communications cable station. In the late nineteenth century, the remote beach at Porthcurno became internationally famous as the British termination of early submarine telegraph cables, {{the first of which}} was landed in 1870, part of an early international link stretching {{all the way from the}} UK to India, which was then a British colony. Porthcurno was chosen in preference to the busy port of Falmouth because of the reduced risk of damage to the cables caused by ships' anchors. In 1872, the Eastern Telegraph Company (ETC) Limited was formed which took over the operation of the cables and built a cable office in Porthcurno <b>valley.</b> The concrete <b>cable</b> hut, where the cable shore ends were connected to their respective landlines, is a listed building and still stands at the top of the beach. ETC and its cable operations expanded through the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in 1928 to merge with Marconi's Wireless Telegraph Company Limited to form Imperial and International Communications Limited which was renamed Cable and Wireless Limited in 1934. Cable and Wireless Limited was a predecessor company of Cable & Wireless Worldwide.|$|R
25|$|The {{conservation}} measures undertaken in Bhutan {{to preserve and}} conserve the cranes are unique; in fact more and more crane habitat areas are being brought under the protected area concept. The Royal Society for Protection of Nature (RSPN) established in 1987, which has the mandate for conservation and nature education {{has been involved in}} monitoring the winter visitors to the Phobjika valley and other habitats such as Bomdeling Valley. According to recorded information, 141 cranes visit Bomdeling valley (Phobjika reports a count of about 400 now) every year. RSPN has a Visitor Centre at the Phobjikha Valley, which provides information on cranes and the environment of the valley. The information Centre is a very modern decagonal building, next to a stream, with high-tech equipment. There is an observatory for birdwatchers, a mini theatre with mural painting with narration. The center staff provides services such as narration, facilitation and presentation of the valley and cranes in Bhutan. The Society has also produced a documentary (1989 : On the wings of prayer and 2014: Heavenly Bird with A german TV comapny) film on the cranes visiting Bhutan every year. Further, in Phubjika the Observation Towers have been so located that they cause the least disturbance to the crane habitats. Tourists are allowed to observe the cranes through the two or three high tech “spotting telescopes’’ and spotted on the watch the behaviour of the crane as described in the RSPN pamphlet titled “Field Guide to Crane Behaviour”, from a safe distance under the strict supervision of forest officials. Farmers are also advised to replace the barbed wire fencing with wooden and stone fencing to reduce harm to the cranes. Collisions with powerlines cause mortality to many crane species and when electricity was to be provided to the <b>valley,</b> the power <b>cables</b> were laid underground to avoid any mortality. The work was taken up during summer when the birds do not use the area.|$|R
