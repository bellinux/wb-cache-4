The gudewife, however, showed some knowledge of chirurgery; she cut away with her scissors the gory locks whose stiffened and coagulated clusters interfered with her operations, and clapped on the wound some lint besmeared with a <b>vulnerary</b> salve, esteemed sovereign by the whole dale (which afforded upon fair nights considerable experience of such cases); she then fixed her plaster with a bandage, and, spite of her patient's resistance, pulled over all a night-cap, to keep everything in its right place. Some contusions on the brow and shoulders she fomented with brandy, which the patient did not permit till the medicine had paid a heavy toll to his mouth. Mrs. Dinmont then simply, but kindly, offered her assistance to Brown.|$|E
60|$|Annot Lyle, as was {{not unusual}} for females in the Highlands, was possessed of a slight degree of medical and even {{surgical}} skill. It may readily be believed, that the profession of surgery, or medicine, as a separate art, was unknown; and the few rude rules which they observed were intrusted to women, or to the aged, whom constant casualties afforded too much opportunity of acquiring experience. The care and attention, accordingly, of Annot Lyle, her attendants, and others acting under her direction, had made her services extremely useful during this wild campaign. And most readily had these services been rendered to friend and foe, wherever they could be most useful. She was now in an apartment of the castle, anxiously superintending the preparation of <b>vulnerary</b> herbs, {{to be applied to}} the wounded; receiving reports from different females respecting those under their separate charge, and distributing what means she had for their relief, when Allan M'Aulay suddenly entered the apartment. She started, for she had heard that he had left the camp upon a distant mission; and, however accustomed she was to the gloom of his countenance, it seemed at present to have even a darker shade than usual. He stood before her perfectly silent, and she felt the necessity of being the first to speak.|$|E
60|$|When Ivanhoe {{reached the}} {{habitation}} of Isaac, {{he was still}} in a state of unconsciousness, owing to the profuse loss of blood which had taken place during his exertions in the lists. Rebecca examined the wound, and having applied to it such <b>vulnerary</b> remedies as her art prescribed, informed her father that if fever could be averted, of which the great bleeding rendered her little apprehensive, and if the healing balsam of Miriam retained its virtue, there was nothing to fear for his guest's life, and that he might with safety travel to York with them on the ensuing day. Isaac looked a little blank at this annunciation. His charity would willingly have stopped short at Ashby, or at most would have left the wounded Christian to be tended in the house where he was residing at present, with an assurance to the Hebrew to whom it belonged, that all expenses should be duly discharged. To this, however, Rebecca opposed many reasons, of which we shall only mention two that had peculiar weight with Isaac. The one was, that she would on no account put the phial of precious balsam into the hands of another physician even of her own tribe, lest that valuable mystery should be discovered; the other, that this wounded knight, Wilfred of Ivanhoe, was an intimate favourite of Richard Coeur-de-Lion, and that, in case the monarch should return, Isaac, who had supplied his brother John with treasure to prosecute his rebellious purposes, would stand in no small need of a powerful protector who enjoyed Richard's favour.|$|E
60|$|We {{have already}} said {{the patient was}} eminently handsome, {{and the removal of}} his helmet, or more properly, of his morion, had {{suffered}} his fair locks to escape in profusion, around a countenance in which the hilarity of youth was qualified by a blush of modesty at once and pleasure. And then the feelings of the younger Countess, when compelled to hold the kerchief to the wound, while her aunt sought in their baggage for some <b>vulnerary</b> remedy, were mingled at once with a sense of delicacy and embarrassment, a thrill of pity for the patient, and of gratitude for his services, which exaggerated, in her eyes, his good mien and handsome features. In short, this incident seemed intended by Fate to complete the mysterious communication which she had, by many petty and apparently accidental circumstances, established betwixt two persons, who, though far different in rank and fortune, strongly resembled each other in youth, beauty, and the romantic tenderness of an affectionate disposition. It was no wonder, therefore, that from this moment the thoughts of the Countess Isabelle, already so familiar to his imagination, should become paramount in Quentin's bosom, nor that if the maiden's feelings were of a less decided character, at least so far as known to herself, she should think of her young defender, to whom she had just rendered a service so interesting, with more emotion than of any of the whole band of high born nobles who had for two years past besieged her with their adoration. Above all, when the thought of Campobasso, the unworthy favourite of Duke Charles, with his hypocritical mien, his base, treacherous spirit, his wry neck and his squint, occurred to her, his portrait was more disgustingly hideous than ever, and deeply did she resolve no tyranny should make her enter into so hateful a union.|$|E

40|$|Today the {{surgical}} correction of pathological {{structure of the}} vestibule of the mouth {{is one of the}} modern methods of periodontal tissue with shallow vestibule of mouth complex treatment. The objective of the research was to improve the efficiency of complex treatment of patients with generalized periodontitis with the shallow vestibule of the mouth by improving the methods of vestibuloplasty and using the <b>vulnerary</b> quercetin in the postoperative period. 85 patients with generalized periodontitis with shallow vestibule of the mouth were examined and treated. All patients were divided into 2 groups. Patients of the first group (42 people) had their vestibuloplasty performed according to Hrudyanov A. I. (2006). Patients of the second group (43 people) underwent vestibuloplasty developed by us in which a number of technological moments were improved. An important element of intervention was the placement and fixation of free mucosal transplants taken from the palate by stitches into the area of horizontal sections near the premolars. Patients with generalized periodontitis of both groups in the postoperative period were prescribed <b>vulnerary</b> quercetin. The results of the research show that our proposed use of vestibuloplasty using free mucosal transplants in treatment of patients with generalized periodontitis with shallow vestibule of the mouth provides significant improvement of clinical treatment efficiency. The most important results of our vestibuloplasty operations included the restoration of the vestibule of the mouth normal depth, elimination of the chronic injury in the vestibule area of the mouth, normalization of blood supply to the periodontal tissues, restoration of mucosa structure of periodontal tissues at the cellular level, normalization of functioning of fibroblasts of vestibule mucous membrane of the mouth. Applying vestibuloplasty using free mucosal transplants and <b>vulnerary</b> quercetin in postoperative period, complex treatment of patients with generalized periodontitis with shallow vestibule of the mouth demonstrates significantly higher treatment efficiency compared to vestibuloplasty when operating wound heals by secondary intention according to clinical and laboratory parameters, cytological, morphological features of mucous membrane of vestibule of the mouth and radiographic, ultrasound characteristics of jaw bones in the early and long-term periods after treatment. ...|$|E

We isolated and characterized a galactosyldiacylglycerol mixture (1), composed mainly of 1, 2 -di-O-linolenoyl- 3 -O-β-D-galactopyranosyl-glycerol, from the frond dichloromethane extract. The wound healing properties of 1 were assessed in vitro on keratinocytes. Scratch wound assays showed increased wound closure rates in keratinocyte monolayers exposed to subtoxic doses, previously determined in cytotoxicity assays. The strongest effect, obtained at a dose of 5 μg/mL, approached that of a platelet lysate used in clinical settings. The use of inhibitors of the main cellular pathways involved in wound repair, revealed important roles for intracellular calcium and the ERK 1 / 2 MAP kinase. Conversely, a PCR array of genes involved in wound healing showed an almost total absence of gene modulation.

EGF was purified to homogeneity by reverse-phase HPLC and quantified by receptor binding assay and amino acid analysis. Preliminary data showed moderate promotion of granulation tissue formation by daily injections of 10 micrograms of EGF. To test the hypothesis that long-term exposure to EGF is required for complete cellular response, the factor was incorporated into pellets releasing 10 or 20 micrograms of biologically active EGF per day, and the pellets were embedded within the sponges. Slow release of EGF caused {{a dramatic increase in}} the extent and organization of the granulation tissue at day 7, a doubling in the DNA content, and 33 % increases in protein content and wet weight, as compared with placebo controls. Although collagen content was also increased by almost 50 %, the relative rate of collagen synthesis remained the same, suggesting that the morphological and biochemical increase in collagen resulted from increased numbers of fibroblasts rather than a specific stimulation of collagen synthesis.

The plant has been traditionally used as analgesic, astringent, anti-inflammatory and <b>vulnerary.</b> The aim of this work {{was to investigate the}} chemical variability in the volatile profiles obtained from the flowering aerial parts of S. sericea harvested in different localities (Palm Mar, Los Roques and La Barranquera) of Tenerife characterized by different microclimates. For the purpose, the essential oils were hydrodistilled from the dried aerial parts by a Clevenger-type apparatus and analysed by GC-MS. A similar chemical composition for the oil samples from the different geographic areas was obtained. The aromatic monoterpene hydrocarbon p-cymene (43. 0 - 57. 0 %) was by far the main component of the oils, with minor amounts of isobornyl acetate (4. 5 - 11. 0 %), limonene (4. 7 - 5. 6 %), β-pinene (0. 7 - 5. 3 %), α-phellandrene (2. 2 - 4. 8 %) and camphene (1. 8 - 4. 5 %). Interesting to note was the occurrence of thymol derivatives that may be considered important chemotaxonomic markers of the genus Schizogyne, and, more in general, of the tribe Inulae. The volatile chemical profile obtained for S. sericea was similar to that of S. glaberrima previously studied...|$|E
