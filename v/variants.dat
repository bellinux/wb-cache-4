5|$|Genotyping arrays {{designed}} for GWAS rely on linkage disequilibrium to provide {{coverage of the}} entire genome by genotyping a subset of <b>variants.</b> Because of this, the reported associated <b>variants</b> {{are unlikely to be}} the actual causal <b>variants.</b> Associated regions can contain hundreds of <b>variants</b> spanning large regions and encompassing many different genes, making the biological interpretation of GWAS loci more difficult. Fine-mapping is a process to refine these lists of associated <b>variants</b> to a credible set most likely to include the causal variant.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Product <b>variant</b> {{design is}} one of the key {{technologies}} of Manufacturing Enterprise for responding market demand. During the product <b>variant</b> design, dimensional tolerance <b>variant</b> design plays an important role. However, dimensional tolerance <b>variant</b> design is considered rarely in the researches of product <b>variant</b> design. To solve the dimensional tolerance <b>variant</b> design during product <b>variant</b> design, information expression, extraction and labeling method of dimensioning of dimensional tolerance of part dimension model is investigated. A <b>variant</b> design method with dimensional tolerance is presented in this paper. In the method, dimension <b>variant</b> design and dimensional tolerance <b>variant</b> design are integrated, so dimension <b>variant</b> design and dimensional tolerance <b>variant</b> design are implemented concurrently. A part <b>variant</b> design module with dimension and dimensional tolerance based on SolidWorks is developed for using Visual C++. Finally, an example of shaft illustrates the proposed method...|$|R

5|$|Between 1934 and the mid-1940s, several <b>variants</b> of the Panzer I were designed, {{especially}} during the later years of its combat history. Because they were obsolescent from their introduction, incapable of defeating foreign armor, and outclassed by newer German tanks, the PanzerI chassis were increasingly adapted as tank destroyers and other <b>variants.</b> One of the best-known <b>variants</b> was the kleiner Panzerbefehlswagen ("small armoured command vehicle"), built on the Ausf. A and Ausf. B chassis—200 of these were manufactured. The Panzer I Ausf. B chassis was also used to build the German Army's first tracked tank destroyer, the Panzerjäger I. This vehicle was armed with a Czech 47-millimeter (1.85in) anti-tank gun.|$|E

5|$|Progeny of {{two parents}} of {{different}} breeds are termed F1 hybrids, F1 crosses or first crosses. F1 hybrids generally have an extremely uniform phenotype {{and benefit from}} hybrid vigour. These advantages are observed in the breeding {{of a wide variety}} of animals and plants, and arise because progeny inherit one of each paired gene from each parent. When both parents are homozygous for different <b>variants</b> of genes (known as alleles), which is likely to be the case when a breed has been developed and selected over several generations, progeny will inherit both gene <b>variants</b> present in the parents. The F1 hybrid progeny will then be heterozygous for each gene variant, which in turn increases the likelihood that the genes will code for an optimal protein or enzyme. This is the genetic basis of hybrid vigour. While many gene <b>variants</b> have effects that are of little consequence to beef production, a few, such as the myostatin <b>variants</b> found in different cattle breeds, have a major effect.|$|E
