40|$|BackgroundAmong {{the sexual}} {{minority}} groups, the Men who have Sexwith Men (MSM) {{community is a}} large and scatterednetwork. Sexual activity among MSM is frequent and oftenunplanned. STI and HIV are major medical problems facedby this vulnerable group. Stigma and discriminationtowards this group result in poor access to preventiveservices that encourage condom and lubricant usage. MethodA cross-sectional, community-based study of 309 MSM wascarried out in the Davangere district between December 2008 and February 2010. Participants were identified inthree stages: cruising <b>venue</b> <b>identification</b> and mapping;determining eligibility and willingness to participate; andrecruitment to the study. Consecutive sampling was used torecruit the participants {{with the help of}} a snowballtechnique, obtaining informed and written consent. ResultsOf the participants 79. 61 % and 88. 03 % reportedinconsistent use of condom and lubricant during the threemonths prior to the interview, respectively. In multivariateanalysis, middle socioeconomic class, sex in a public placeand increased frequency of sex were significantly associatedwith inconsistent condom use. Whereas, practising bothtypes of anal sex (receptive and insertive), not using acondom during the last sexual encounter and increasedfrequency of sex were significantly associated withinconsistent lubricant use. ConclusionMany social and behavioural factors are involved in theinconsistent use of condom and lubricant among MSM. Preventive programmes must identify these factors in orderto target consistent condom and lubricant use among theMSM community...|$|E
5000|$|Transgender {{individuals}} {{may also be}} discouraged from voting under these photo identification circumstances because of prior experiences with presenting identification that does not accurately reflect their gender: 41% percent of transgender people reported being harassed in situations where they presented gender incongruent identification, while 15% reported being asked to leave the <b>venue</b> where the <b>identification</b> had been presented, and 3% reported being assaulted or attacked {{as a result of}} presenting their ID. [...] Additionally, 22% percent reported being denied equal treatment or being verbally harassed by government officials.|$|R
40|$|Background: In October 2009, a dual-pathogen {{outbreak}} of Campylobacter and Salmonella occurred in which 59 cases were identified among guests attending a regional {{conference in the}} North of England. The mean symptomatic period was 5. 4 days (confidence intervals: 4. 4 - 6. 4), and over 84 % of the cases had abdominal pain and diarrhoea. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was used to investigate the outbreak, and active case-finding was performed through the conference organizers and environmental health officers. A focused questionnaire was distributed to all guests via the event organizers 10 days after the conference. Results: Response rate among guests was 61 % (107 / 175). A cohort study was undertaken, and a strong association was found between illness and consumption of chicken liver pâté, supporting the hypothesis that chicken liver pâté was the most likely cause of the outbreak. Conclusion: This is the first mixed pathogen outbreak documented associated with the consumption of chicken liver pâté and adds to the evidence of potential hazards associated with the undercooking of poultry livers. A rapid outbreak investigation with collaboration between several organizations and the <b>venue</b> led to <b>identification</b> of the most probable source...|$|R
40|$|White poplar (Populus alba) is a {{widespread}} species of the northern hemisphere. Introgressed populations or hybrid zones with the related species of the European aspen (Populus tremula) have been suggested as potential <b>venues</b> for the <b>identification</b> of functionally important variation for germplasm conservation, restoration efforts and tree breeding. Data on the genetic diversity and structure of introgressed P. alba are available only for sympatric populations from central Europe. Here, clonality, introgression and spatial genetic patterns were evaluated in three riparian populations of P. alba along the Ticino, Paglia-Tevere and Cesano river drainages in Italy. Samples of all three populations were typed for five nuclear microsatellite markers and 137 polymorphic amplified fragment length polymorphisms. Microsatellite-based inbreeding co-efficients (FIS) were significantly positive in all three populations. Genetic diversity was consistently highest in Ticino, the population with {{the highest level of}} introgression from P. tremula. Population differentiation (F ST) was low between the Ticino valley in northern Italy and the Cesano valley in central Italy and between the central Italian populations of Cesano and Paglia-Tevere, consistent with a role of the Appenine mountain range as a barrier to gene flow between adjacent drainage areas. Introgression was not the primary determinant of within-population spatial genetic structure (SGS) in the studied populations...|$|R
40|$|Effective {{goal setting}} {{involves}} {{collaboration between the}} client and therapist and {{is an important component}} of occupational therapy practice. However, encouraging involvement and collaboration does not necessarily guarantee that client goals are incorporated into the treatment plan. The purpose of this innovative treatment program was to determine if providing a client with a <b>venue</b> for goal <b>identification,</b> documentation, and maintenance might impact participation and satisfaction in a day rehabilitation setting. Responses to a study satisfaction survey (Ss) were taken at baseline and immediately postintervention from the experimental (N = 11) and control (N = 10) groups and attendance rates were compared between groups. Semi-structured post- intervention interviews were used to obtain qualitative feedback of the intervention. Minimal differences between the control and experimental group were found on the quantitative measures. However, unanticipated results to components were identified. Qualitative findings suggested that both patients and therapists felt the intervention created positive outcomes. This innovative program approach outlines basic strategies therapists can employ to provide a venue for client goal ownership focusing on client goal identification, client goal documentation, and client goal maintenance. While results do not support increases in self-efficacy, further research to explore the role of client-owned goals is suggested...|$|R
40|$|Clothing {{serves as}} a marker of identity, {{but how do you}} dress when you have nothing left but the clothes that you were wearing when you had to run? Who are you, when dressed entirely in someone else’s choice of clothes? Does the resourcefulness {{necessary}} for self-expression under such circumstances also reinforce our ability to cope and survive on a more than material level? What can losing everything help us to remember? Taking the earthquakes in Christchurch, New Zealand as its starting point, this article will examine the usefulness of fashion, sometimes dismissed as a “frivolous” concern, during times of crisis. It will consider examples from these and other catastrophic events, considering how individuals and communities have used fashion as an expression of resilience and to defy the devastation wrought by disaster (Howell, 2012; Labrum, McKergow, & Gibson, 2007). The article will be structured to consider the “epicentre” of the effect of the earthquake, as on the individual, the wider social ramifications as the tremors ripple out, and the aftershocks that can continue to disrupt attempts at re-establishing daily patterns. “Habitus” is defined as a state of mind by the sociologist Pierre Bourdieu (Bourdieu & Nice 1977). It is what we practice, what has been “preached” to us, and what we have picked up from our surroundings. However, this mental space, a culmination of personal and cultural memory, requires a habitat, a physical place for its expression and evolution. Analysis {{of the success of the}} temporary Re:START mall, created from shipping containers, offers a case study on the role of fashion, as retail and spectacle, in the vigorously debated regeneration of this city. Workplaces, offices, bars and clubs serve as <b>venues</b> for interaction, <b>identification</b> and individuality, but if we dress up to go out, what happens when there is nowhere left to go to? If the street is gone, how could a shop serve “street style”, and act as a site for social interaction as well as retail and revenue? What role can fashion play in reinvigorating public spaces and events in a devastated area? From individual efforts to community initiatives, what is the role of fashion in the recovery of a city, and the cultural life of a region...|$|R
