25|$|According to the cladogram, {{the genus}} Rhynia {{illustrates}} two {{steps in the}} evolution of modern vascular plants. Plants have <b>vascular</b> <b>tissue,</b> albeit significantly simpler than modern vascular plants. Their gametophytes are distinctly smaller than their sporophytes (but have <b>vascular</b> <b>tissue,</b> unlike almost all modern vascular plants).|$|E
25|$|Polysporangiophytes, {{also called}} polysporangiates or {{formally}} Polysporangiophyta, are plants {{in which the}} spore-bearing generation (sporophyte) has branching stems (axes) that terminate in sporangia. The name literally means many sporangia plant. The clade includes all land plants (embryophytes) except for the bryophytes (liverworts, mosses and hornworts) whose sporophytes are always unbranched. While the definition is independent {{of the presence of}} <b>vascular</b> <b>tissue,</b> all living polysporangiophytes also have <b>vascular</b> <b>tissue,</b> i.e., are vascular plants or tracheophytes. Fossil polysporangiophytes are known that have no <b>vascular</b> <b>tissue,</b> and so are not tracheophytes.|$|E
25|$|Stem usually {{consist of}} three tissues, dermal tissue, ground tissue and <b>vascular</b> <b>tissue.</b> The dermal tissue covers the outer {{surface of the}} stem and usually {{functions}} to waterproof, protect and control gas exchange. The ground tissue usually consists mainly of parenchyma cells and fills in around the <b>vascular</b> <b>tissue.</b> It sometimes functions in photosynthesis. <b>Vascular</b> <b>tissue</b> provides long distance transport and structural support. Most or all ground tissue may be lost in woody stems. The dermal tissue of aquatic plants stems may lack the waterproofing found in aerial stems. The arrangement of the vascular tissues varies widely among plant species.|$|E
40|$|The {{secondary}} {{growth of a}} woody stem requires {{the formation of a}} vascular cambium at an appropriate position and proper patterning of the <b>vascular</b> <b>tissues</b> derived from the cambium. Class III homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD ZIP) transcription factors have been implicated in polarity determination and patterning in lateral organs and primary <b>vascular</b> <b>tissues</b> and in the initiation and function of shoot apical meristems. We report here the functional characterization of a Populus class III HD ZIP gene, popREVOLUTA (PRE), that demonstrates another role for class III HD ZIPs in regulating the development of cambia and secondary <b>vascular</b> <b>tissues.</b> PRE is orthologous to Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) REVOLUTA and is expressed in both the shoot apical meristem and in the cambial zone and secondary <b>vascular</b> <b>tissues.</b> Transgenic Populus expressing a microRNA-resistant form of PRE presents unstable phenotypic abnormalities affecting both primary and {{secondary growth}}. Surprisingly, phenotypic changes include abnormal formation of cambia within cortical parenchyma that can produce secondary <b>vascular</b> <b>tissues</b> in reverse polarity. Genes misexpressed in PRE mutants include transcription factors and auxin-related genes previously implicated in class III HD ZIP functions during primary growth. Together, these results suggest that PRE plays a fundamental role in the initiation of the cambium and in regulating the patterning of secondary <b>vascular</b> <b>tissues...</b>|$|R
40|$|Four oligofructans (neokestose, 1 -kestose, nystose, and an un-identified pentofructan) {{occurred}} in the <b>vascular</b> <b>tissues</b> and phloem sap of mature leaves of Agave deserti. Fructosyltransferases (responsible for fructan biosynthesis) also {{occurred in}} the <b>vascular</b> <b>tissues.</b> In contrast, oligofructans and fructosyltransferases were virtually absent from the chlorenchyma, suggesting that fructan biosynthesis was restricted to the <b>vascular</b> <b>tissues.</b> On a molar basis, these oligofructans accounted for 46 % of the total soluble sugars in the <b>vascular</b> <b>tissues</b> (sucrose [Suc] for 26 %) and for 19 % in the phloem sap (fructose for 24 % and Suc for 53 %). The Suc concentration was 1. 8 times higher in the cytosol of the chlorenchyma cells than in the phloem sap; the nystose concentration was 4. 9 times higher and that of pentofructan was 3. 2 times higher in the <b>vascular</b> <b>tissues</b> than in the phloem sap. To our knowledge, these results provide the first evidence that oligofructans are synthesized and transported in the phloem of higher plants. The polymer-trapping mechanism proposed for dicotyledonous C 3 species may also be valid for oligofructan transport in monocotyledonous species, such as A. deserti, which may use a symplastic pathway for phloem loading of photosynthates in its mature leaves...|$|R
50|$|In botany, a {{fascicle}} is {{a bundle}} of leaves or flowers growing crowded together; alternatively the term might refer to the <b>vascular</b> <b>tissues</b> that supply such an organ with nutrients. However, <b>vascular</b> <b>tissues</b> may occur in fascicles even when the organs they supply are not fascicled. In zoology and animal anatomy the term fascicle refers to a small bundle, usually of fibres, nerves, or vessels.|$|R

25|$|Most ferns have {{rhizomes}} with no vertical stem. The {{exception is}} tree ferns, with vertical stems {{up to about}} 20 metres. The stem anatomy of ferns {{is more complicated than}} that of dicots because fern stems often have one or more leaf gaps in cross section. A leaf gap is where the <b>vascular</b> <b>tissue</b> branches off to a frond. In cross section, the <b>vascular</b> <b>tissue</b> does not form a complete cylinder where a leaf gap occurs. Fern stems may have solenosteles or dictyosteles or variations of them. Many fern stems have phloem tissue {{on both sides of the}} xylem in cross-section.|$|E

40|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} (CO) induced a concentration-dependent {{relaxation of}} isolated rat tail artery tissues which were precontracted with phenylephrine or U- 46619. This vasorelaxing effect of CO was {{independent of the}} presence of the intact endothelium. The CO-induced vasorelaxation was partially inhibited by the blockade of either the cyclicGMP pathway or big-conductance calcium-activated K (KCa) channels. When both the cyclicGMP pathway and KCa channels were blocked, the CO-induced vasorelaxation was completely abolished. Incubation of <b>vascular</b> <b>tissues</b> with hemin, in order to enhance the endogenous production of CO, suppressed the phenylephrine-induced vasocontraction in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The hemin-induced suppression of the vascular contractile response to phenylephrine was abolished after the <b>vascular</b> <b>tissues</b> were co-incubated with either oxyhaemoglobin or zinc protoporphyrin-IX, suggesting an induced endogenous generation of CO from <b>vascular</b> <b>tissues.</b> The effect of hemin incubation on vascular contractility did not involve the endogenous generation of nitric oxide. Our results suggest that CO may activate both a cyclicGMP signalling pathway and KCa channels in the same <b>vascular</b> <b>tissues,</b> and that the endogenously generated CO may significantly affect the vascular contractile responses...|$|R
40|$|Differences of {{arterial}} and venous {{smooth muscle}} tissues in their sensitivity to Ca 2 + antagonists and to serotonin antagonists were studied {{in a number}} of blood vessels. The tissue selectivity for Ca 2 + antagonists, in particular differences between arteries and veins is related both to the presence of extra- and intracellular pools from which Ca 2 + ions are mobilized and to differences in access to or sensitivity of the Ca 2 + channels in various <b>vascular</b> <b>tissues.</b> Tissue selectivity also exists for serotonin as well as for serotonin antagonists of which R 41 468 {{is an example of a}} compound with high selectivity for <b>vascular</b> <b>tissues.</b> link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
30|$|OsAP 77 ::GUS {{expression}} levels {{appeared to}} increase in response to X. oryzae pv. oryzae and wounding with symptoms (Figure  2 C and D), which was confirmed by in vitro assay of GUS activity (Additional file 5 B), suggesting that the expression of OsAP 77 has roles in the defense response to bacterial leaf blight (BLB). Increased GUS activity was detected around the BLB symptom sites {{as well as the}} wounding sites (Figure  2 C). As shown in Figure  2 C, GUS activity was restricted to the <b>vascular</b> <b>tissues</b> around the wounded area, but not in the mesophyll cells, guard cells, epidermal cells and <b>vascular</b> <b>tissues</b> in the BLB and wounded areas.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} a Chinese herbal formula for calming liver and suppressing yang on the protein expressions of <b>vascular</b> <b>tissues</b> in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), and to explore the mechanism of efficacy. Methods: Twenty SHRs were randomly divided into model group and treatment group. Another 10 Wistar-Kyoto rats were selected as a normal control. SHRs in the treatment group were administered with the formula for calming liver and suppressing Yang for 4 weeks. During the course of treatment, blood pressure and heart rates were monitored every week and the ethology of rats, including irritability and rotation endurance was also evaluated. After treatment, thoracic aorta was obtained and its proteins were separated by 2 -dimensional gel electrophoresis (2 -DE). The differentially expressed proteins were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and database query. Results: The formula for calming liver and suppressing yang not only decreased the systolic blood pressure and heart rate, but also improved irritability degree and rotation endurance time of SHRs. This experiment had established the 2 -DE graph of protein expressions of <b>vascular</b> <b>tissues</b> in SHRs. Compared with the normal group, the expressions of 15 proteins were down-regulated, and 12 proteins were up-regulated in <b>vascular</b> <b>tissues</b> of the model group. The formula for calming liver and suppressing yang treatment up-regulated expressions of 10 proteins in the 15 down-regulated proteins, and down-regulated 8 proteins in the 12 up-regulated proteins in <b>vascular</b> <b>tissues</b> of SHRs. After analysis, 16 obviously differentially expressed proteins were found, and 13 of them were identified. Conclusion: The formula for calming liver and suppressing yang can improve the ethology of SHRs. The mechanism is probably concerned with regulating the protein expressions of <b>vascular</b> <b>tissues...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{concept of}} the polysporangiophytes, more {{formally}} called Polysporangiophyta, {{was first published in}} 1997 by Kenrick and Crane. (The taxobox at the right represents their view of the classification of the polysporangiophytes.) The defining feature of the clade is that the sporophyte branches and bears multiple sporangia. This distinguishes polysporangiophytes from liverworts, mosses and hornworts, which have unbranched sporophytes each with a single sporangium. Polysporangiophytes {{may or may not have}} <b>vascular</b> <b>tissue</b> – those that do are vascular plants or tracheophytes.|$|E

40|$|Epigenetic {{mechanisms}} of gene regulation in context of cardiovascular diseases are of considerable interest. So far, our current {{knowledge of the}} DNA methylation profiles for atherosclerosis affected and healthy human <b>vascular</b> <b>tissues</b> is still limited. Using the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 27 BeadChip, we performed a genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in right coronary artery {{in the area of}} advanced atherosclerotic plaques, atherosclerotic-resistant internal mammary arteries, and great saphenous veins obtained from same patients with coronary heart disease. The resulting DNA methylation patterns were markedly different between all the <b>vascular</b> <b>tissues.</b> The genes hypomethylated in athero-prone arteries to compare with atherosclerotic-resistant arteries were predominately involved in regulation of inflammation and immune processes, as well as development. The great saphenous veins exhibited an increase of the DNA methylation age in comparison to the internal mammary arteries. Gene ontology analysis for genes harboring hypermethylated CpG-sites in veins revealed the enrichment for biological processes associated with the development. Four CpG-sites located within the MIR 10 B gene sequence and about 1 kb upstream of the HOXD 4 gene were also confirmed as hypomethylated in the independent dataset of the right coronary arteries in the area of advanced atherosclerotic plaques in comparison with the other <b>vascular</b> <b>tissues.</b> The DNA methylation differences observed in <b>vascular</b> <b>tissues</b> of patients with coronary heart disease can provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the development of pathology and explanation for the difference in graft patency after coronary artery bypass grafting surgery...|$|R
25|$|When {{the plant}} is an embryo, <b>vascular</b> <b>tissue</b> emerges from procambium tissue, {{which is at the}} center of the embryo. Protophloem itself appears in the mid-vein {{extending}} into the cotyledonary node, which constitutes the first appearance of a leaf in angiosperms, where it forms continuous strands. The hormone auxin, transported by the protein PIN1 is responsible for the growth of those protophloem strands, signaling the final identity of those tissues. SHORTROOT(SHR), and microRNA165/166 also participate in that process, while Callose Synthase 3(CALS3), inhibits the locations where SHORTROOT(SHR), and microRNA165 can go.|$|E
25|$|As {{a part of}} a {{sedimentary}} or metamorphic rock, fossils {{undergo the}} same diagenetic processes as does the containing rock. A shell consisting of calcite can, for example, dissolve while a cement of silica then fills the cavity. In the same way, precipitating minerals can fill cavities formerly occupied by blood vessels, <b>vascular</b> <b>tissue</b> or other soft tissues. This preserves the form of the organism but changes the chemical composition, a process called permineralization. The most common minerals involved in permineralization are cements of carbonates (especially calcite), forms of amorphous silica (chalcedony, flint, chert) and pyrite. In the case of silica cements, the process is called lithification.|$|E
25|$|Dawson, a Canadian {{geologist}} and paleobotanist, was {{the first}} to discover and describe a megafossil of a polysporangiophyte. In 1859 he published a reconstruction of a Devonian plant, collected as a fossil from the Gaspé region of Canada, which he named Psilophyton princeps. The reconstruction shows horizontal and upright stem-like structures; no leaves or roots are present. The upright stems or axes branch dichotomously and have pairs of spore-forming organs (sporangia) attached to them. Cross-sections of the upright axes showed that <b>vascular</b> <b>tissue</b> was present. He later described other specimens. Dawson's discoveries initially had little scientific impact; Taylor et al. speculate that this may have been because his reconstruction looked very unusual and the fossil was older than was expected.|$|E

Below the ground, the roots branch and spread out widely; they serve to anchor the tree and extract moisture and nutrients from the soil. Above ground, the branches divide into smaller branches and shoots. The shoots typically bear leaves, which capture light energy and convert it into sugars by photosynthesis, providing the food for the tree's growth and development.|$|E

We attempted to assess the physiological role of H 2 S in the regulation of vascular contractility, the modulation of H 2 S production in <b>vascular</b> <b>tissues,</b> and the underlying mechanisms. Intravenous bolus injection of H 2 S transiently decreased blood pressure of rats by 12 – 30 mmHg, which was antagonized by prior blockade of KATP channels.

In isolated vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs), H 2 S directly increased KATP channel currents and hyperpolarized membrane. The expression of H 2 S-generating enzyme was identified in vascular SMCs, but not in endothelium. The endogenous production of H 2 S from different <b>vascular</b> <b>tissues</b> was also directly measured with the abundant level {{in the order of}} tail artery, aorta and mesenteric artery.

The aim of this work is to study in Arabidopsis thaliana the adaptive processes associated to the carbohydrate metabolism and allocation between source and sink organs in plants submitted to salt stress with or without acclimation. Physiological and metabolic modifications under acclimation were investigated through the analysis of plant growth, and of accumulation of sugars and proline in the leaves and floral stem. The anatomical modifications {{taking place in the}} stem and in the <b>vascular</b> <b>tissues</b> were studied through measuring the diameter of the stem, the area of the <b>vascular</b> <b>tissues</b> in the transverse sections and the number of irregular vessels in the xylem poles. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) was used for analysing the composition of the secondary cell walls of the xylem in flower stem sections. The results indicated that an acclimation to salt stress had no beneficial effects on the tolerance to high NaCl concentrations, similar plant growth reductions occuring with or without acclimation. Nevertheless, in the floral stem of plants submitted to salt stress, fewer collapsed vessels were observed in the xylem after acclimation. No significant effect was observed on the area of <b>vascular</b> <b>tissues</b> in contrast to plants without acclimation. The analysis of FTIR’s spectra showed for stressed plants a significant modification in the content of lignin. Significant variations in polysaccharides and pectins were also observed.
