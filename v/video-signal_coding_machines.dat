5000|$|These <b>coding</b> <b>machines</b> {{are further}} sub {{categorized}} {{into the following}} types depending on their mode of operation: ...|$|R
2500|$|Compilers {{are used}} to {{translate}} source code from a programming language into either object <b>code</b> or <b>machine</b> <b>code.</b> [...] Object code needs further processing to become <b>machine</b> <b>code,</b> and <b>machine</b> <b>code</b> consists of the central processing unit's native instructions, ready for execution. Compiled computer programs are {{commonly referred to as}} executables, binary images, or simply as binaries– a reference to the binary file format used to store the executable code.|$|R

50|$|Packaging {{machines}} are machines that complete {{stages of the}} packaging process. Examples include filling machines, sealing machines, wrapping machines, strapping machines, labelling <b>machines</b> and <b>coding</b> <b>machines.</b>|$|R
50|$|An {{assembler}} is used {{to convert}} assembly <b>code</b> into <b>machine</b> <b>code</b> (object code). A linker links several object (and library) files to generate an executable. Assemblers can also assemble directly to <b>machine</b> <b>code</b> executable files without the object intermediary step.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to the visual and audio information, there are board games in different languages (including a giant Scrabble board), {{as well as an}} Enigma <b>machine</b> (<b>coding</b> <b>machine</b> used in the Second World War).|$|R
50|$|There is an Occupation Museum {{about the}} years 1940-1945 which holds the Victoria Cross awarded posthumously to Captain Bernard Warburton-Lee of the British Royal Navy in 1940 and a rare German Enigma <b>coding</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|R
50|$|The HP project Dynamo was an {{experimental}} JIT compiler where the 'bytecode' format and the <b>machine</b> <b>code</b> format were the same; the system turned PA-6000 <b>machine</b> <b>code</b> into PA-8000 <b>machine</b> <b>code.</b> Counterintuitively, {{this resulted in}} speed ups, in some cases of 30% since doing this permitted optimizations at the <b>machine</b> <b>code</b> level, for example, inlining code for better cache usage and optimizations of calls to dynamic libraries and many other run-time optimizations which conventional compilers {{are not able to}} attempt.|$|R
2500|$|The Narvik War Museum (Narvik Krigsmuseum) {{covers the}} war years 1940–1945. The museum [...] {{displays}} the Victoria Cross awarded posthumously to Captain Bernard Warburton-Lee of the British Royal Navy and a rare German Enigma <b>coding</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|R
50|$|Bernard Willson was a British {{linguist}} {{and noted}} academic, who during World War II {{was the first}} person to decrypt the Italian Navy Hagelin C-38 <b>code</b> <b>machine.</b> He is the father of television presenter Quentin Willson.|$|R
50|$|MATH-MATIC {{programs}} could include inline assembler sections of ARITH-MATIC <b>code</b> and UNIVAC <b>machine</b> <b>code.</b>|$|R
50|$|Snippet is a {{programming}} {{term for}} a small region of re-usable source <b>code,</b> <b>machine</b> <b>code,</b> or text. Ordinarily, these are formally defined operative units to incorporate into larger programming modules. Snippet management is a feature of some text editors, program source code editors, IDEs, and related software. It allows the user to avoid repetitive typing {{in the course of}} routine edit operations.|$|R

40|$|An {{intermediate}} {{representation is}} a data structure {{that represents the}} program source {{during the process of}} translation into object code. At first, the compiler translates source code into a more suitable form for optimization, and then turns it into <b>machine</b> <b>code.</b> The compiler transforms the code into a more manageable language, usually three-address code, which represents exactly one instruction <b>code</b> <b>machine,</b> does type checking and translates expressions...|$|R
40|$|Machine [Leroy 90] {{although}} I have omitted any optimisations {{and added}} a few instructions of my own to handle objects. 3. 6. 1 Overview of the Byte <b>Code</b> <b>Machine</b> The internal state of the byte <b>code</b> <b>machine</b> consists of: a program which {{is a list of}} instructions to be executed, the head of the list is the next one to be executed, an accumulator, an environment, an argument stack and a return stack. Unlike a real computer the accumulator can hold more than just a 32 -bit number, it can hold the value top, an integer, a dummy parameter for types (explained later), a closure or an object (which is similar to a list of closures). This is the advantage of using a byte <b>code</b> <b>machine</b> designed yourself; you can customise it to work with high level data and not just numbers like a real CPU. This simplifies compilation a great deal. The environment is used to store the 'context' of a function. Whenever a function is defined it is stored as a closure which is a function body along with the current to [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This {{script is}} {{arranged}} {{based on the}} research purposed to know the best alternative for PT Air Mancur between repairing of Filling and Packaging Sachet Machine, Honey Liquid Filler Machine, Auto strip Packaging <b>Machine,</b> <b>Coding</b> <b>Machine</b> Daichi DH- 7, Ribbon Mixer Material Sus 304 Machine, Filling Sachet Machine, Honey Stick <b>Machine,</b> <b>Coding</b> <b>Machine,</b> Tank and Mixer Machine, Conveyor Machine, and Gear and Pump Brand Machine or buy for each of this machines. The basic method of the research is decrypting method and implementation by case study method. This research is done in PT Air Mancur. This location research is selected on purpose because PT Air Mancur is a factory that processing plant medicine becomes an herb product more than 40 years, this company doesn’t pay attention for feasibility analysis if economic age of machines finished, and data that needed for this research is available. Based on infestations criteria Pay Back Period (PBP), Net Present Value (NPV), Profitability Index (PI), and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) are know that all of investation alternatives and feasible to do. But then, the infestation alternative for buy for new Filling and Packaging Sachet Machine, Honey Liquid Filler Machine, Auto strip Packaging <b>Machine,</b> <b>Coding</b> <b>Machine</b> Daichi DH- 7, Ribbon Mixer Material Sus 304 Machine, Filling Sachet Machine, Honey Stick <b>Machine,</b> <b>Coding</b> <b>Machine,</b> Tank and Mixer Machine, Conveyor Machine, and Gear and Pump Brand Machine is the best alternative. This decision is taken based on value of infestation criteria NPV and PI for buying new machine alternative is more than value infestation criteria NPV and PI for repairing machine alternative. In expectation, this alternative give more benefit than repairing the old machine. The result of this research show that the reasonable alternative is buy for new machine of Filling and Packaging Sachet Machine, Honey Liquid Filler Machine, Auto strip Packaging <b>Machine,</b> <b>Coding</b> <b>Machine</b> Daichi DH- 7, Ribbon Mixer Material Sus 304 Machine, Filling Sachet Machine, Honey Stick <b>Machine,</b> <b>Coding</b> <b>Machine,</b> Tank and Mixer Machine, Conveyor Machine, and Gear and Pump Brand Machine. From the research result suggested that PT Air Mancur should choose buying infestation alternative for new machine prioritized for Filling and Packaging Machine, Honey Liquid Filler Machine, and Auto strip Packaging Machine because these machines are the oldest (17 years old). PT Air Mancur should give attention for the economic age of machines. All this time this company operated machines although the economic age of machine is finished. This research showed that repairing old machine as an effort for elongate machine’s economic age is an unprofitable alternative than buy new machine...|$|R
40|$|Sometimes <b>machine</b> <b>code</b> {{turns out}} to be a better target for {{verification}} than source <b>code.</b> RISC <b>machine</b> <b>code</b> is especially advantaged with respect to source code in this regard because it has only two instructions that access memory. That architecture forms the basis here for an inference system that can prove <b>machine</b> <b>code</b> safe against `hardware aliasing', an effect that occurs in embedded systems. There are programming memes that ensure code is safe from hardware aliasing, but we want to certify that a given <b>machine</b> <b>code</b> is provably safe.
