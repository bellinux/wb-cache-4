In a first for the Premier League, Aston Villa donated {{the front of the}} shirt on their kit, usually reserved for high-paying sponsorships, to Acorns Hospice so that the charity would gain significant additional <b>visibility</b> <b>and</b> greater fund raising capabilities. Outside of the shirt sponsorship the club have paid for hospice care for the charity as well as regularly providing player visits to hospice locations.|$|E
5|$|During {{the weekend}} of June 13–14, 2015, a large swarm of mayflies caused several {{vehicular}} accidents on the Columbia–Wrightsville Bridge, carrying Pennsylvania Route 462 across the Susquehanna River between Columbia and Wrightsville, Pennsylvania. The bridge had to be closed to traffic twice during that period due to impaired <b>visibility</b> <b>and</b> obstructions posed by piles of dead insects.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the current}} {{opportunities}} for stellar atmospheric modeling is the interpretation of optical interferometric data of stars. Starting from the robust, open source ATLAS atmospheric code [1], we have developed a spherically symmetric code, SATLAS, as a new option for modeling stellar atmospheres of low gravity stars. The SATLAS code is tested against both interferometric observations of M giants by Wittkowski and collaborators, and spherically symmetric M giant NextGen models from the PHOENIX code. The SATLAS models predict interferometric visibilities that agree with the observed <b>visibilities</b> <b>and</b> with predicted <b>visibilities,</b> <b>and</b> the SATLAS atmospheric structures also agree with those from spherical PHOENIX models, with just small differences in temperature and pressure at large depths in the atmospheres...|$|R
5|$|Highway21 {{is often}} subject to {{closures}} {{at various points}} as it lies on the lee shore of Lake Huron. Lake effect snow squalls frequently subject motorists to poor <b>visibility</b> <b>and</b> slippery conditions, leading to whiteout conditions. Because of this, the Ontario Provincial Police claim that the road is the most often closed in the province.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, the Albert Bridge was rewired {{and painted}} {{in an unusual}} colour scheme {{designed}} {{to make it more}} conspicuous in poor <b>visibility,</b> <b>and</b> avoid being damaged by ships. At night it is illuminated by 4,000bulbs, making it one of west London's most striking landmarks. In 2010–2011, these were replaced with LEDs.|$|E
5|$|In 2012–2013, Mogadishu's {{municipal}} authority {{in conjunction with}} the British and Norwegian governments began a project to install solar-powered street lights on all of the capital's major roads.

5|$|To {{accommodate}} the same flight deck design as the 767, the 757 {{has a more}} rounded nose section than previous narrow-body aircraft.

5|$|A precise search {{area was}} {{difficult}} to define, as even small differences in estimates of the aircraft's speed, or the environmental conditions along the flight path (which varied significantly by location and altitude), changed Cooper's projected landing point considerably. An important variable was {{the length of time}} he remained in free fall before pulling his rip cord—if indeed he succeeded in opening a parachute at all. Neither of the Air Force fighter pilots saw anything exit the airliner, either visually or on radar, nor did they see a parachute open; but at night, with extremely limited <b>visibility</b> <b>and</b> cloud cover obscuring any ground lighting below, an airborne human figure clad entirely in black clothing could easily have gone undetected. The T-33 pilots never made visual contact with the 727 at all.|$|E
5|$|As intended, {{it would}} have functioned as a stealth helicopter, {{incorporating}} {{a number of different}} techniques and technologies in order to reduce its radar cross-section (RCS) along with other areas of <b>visibility</b> <b>and</b> detectability. The exterior surfaces of the RAH-66 were faceted and covered with both radar-absorbent material (RAM) coatings and infrared-suppressant paint; {{as a result of these}} combined measures, the Comanche's RCS was claimed to have been 360 times smaller than that of the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter. The acoustic signature of the rotorcraft was also reported to be noticeably lower than comparative helicopters; this reduction had been partially achieved through the adoption of an all-composite five-blade main rotor and pioneering canted tail rotor assembly.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the remote}} {{location}} of the Itcha Range, future eruptions are not a major hazard. Future volcanism is most likely {{in the form of}} basaltic cinder cones, but eruptions of felsic magma can not be ruled out. The most immediate hazard relating to future eruptions is of local concern only and includes the possibility of forest fires by lava flows and the disruption of local air traffic if an eruption column is produced. Volcanic ash reduces <b>visibility</b> <b>and</b> can cause jet engine failure, as well as damage to other aircraft systems.|$|E
5|$|Crime {{continued}} to be a problem at the Anacostia Station late into {{the first decade of the}} 21st century. Assaults and shootings were more frequent at the station than at any other station in the transit system. There were 32 robberies at the station in 2007. Although Anacostia was one of the 10 Metro stations with the highest crime rate in 2007 (and the only such station on the list inside the District of Columbia), no auto thefts or auto break-ins were reported at the station that year. To help deter crime, Metro installed outdoor security cameras at all 10 high-crime Metrorail stations in July 2008. In September 2008, Metro Transit Police stepped up their <b>visibility</b> <b>and</b> presence at all stations with high student ridership, including Anacostia.|$|E

40|$|Context: Mode {{identification}} {{is a crucial}} step to comparing observed frequencies with theoretical ones, but {{has proven to be}} difficult in rapidly rotating stars. Aims: To further constrain mode identification, we aim to accurately calculate mode <b>visibilities</b> <b>and</b> amplitude ratios in rapid rotators. Methods: We derive the relevant equations for calculating mode visibilities in different photometric bands while fully taking into account the geometric distortion from both the centrifugal deformation and the pulsation modes, the variations in effective gravity, and an approximate treatment of the temperature variations. These equations are then applied to 2 D oscillation modes, calculated using the TOP code, in fully distorted 2 D models based on the SCF method. The specific intensities come from a grid of Kurucz atmospheres, thereby taking into account limb and gravity darkening. Results: We obtain mode <b>visibilities</b> <b>and</b> amplitude ratios for 2 M_ models rotating at 0 to 80...|$|R

5|$|Green can {{communicate}} safety to proceed, as in traffic lights. Green and red were standardized as {{the colors of}} international railroad signals in the 19th century. The first traffic light, using green and red gas lamps, was erected in 1868 {{in front of the}} Houses of Parliament in London. It exploded the following year, injuring the policeman who operated it. In 1912, the first modern electric traffic lights were put up in Salt Lake City, Utah. Red was chosen largely because of its high <b>visibility,</b> <b>and</b> its association with danger, while green was chosen largely because it could not be mistaken for red. Today green lights universally signal that a system is turned on and working as it should. In many video games, green signifies both health and completed objectives, opposite red.|$|E
5|$|It was at {{this stage}} that the attack began to go seriously wrong. Strong winds blowing off the land swept the smoke screen {{into the face of}} the {{advancing}} cruisers, blinding their commanders who attempted to navigate by dead reckoning. The same wind disclosed the Inshore Squadron to the German defenders who immediately opened up a withering fire on the blockships. With their volunteer crews suffering heavy casualties, the commanders increased speed despite the poor <b>visibility</b> <b>and</b> continued groping through the narrow channels inshore, searching for the Stroom Bank buoy which directed shipping into the canal.|$|E
5|$|Securing an {{airstrip}} {{would be}} an important objective for the invader. Airfields, considered extremely vulnerable, were protected by trench works and pillboxes which faced inwards towards the runway, rather than outwards. Many of these fortifications were specified by the Air Ministry and defensive designs were unique to airfields—these would {{not be expected to}} face heavy weapons so the degree of protection was less and there was more emphasis on all-round <b>visibility</b> <b>and</b> sweeping fields of fire. It was difficult to defend large open areas without creating impediments to the movement of friendly aircraft. Solutions to this problem included the pop-up Picket Hamilton fort—a light pillbox that could be lowered to ground level when the airfield was in use.|$|E
