40|$|Thesis (M. A.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2009. Two moral orientations {{in men and}} women‟s {{reasoning}} about moral dilemmas {{have dominated}} the literature: an orientation to rights, fairness, and justice and another based on care, compassion and concern for others. It is widely accepted that exposure <b>to</b> <b>violence</b> {{has a number of}} adverse effects on children and adolescents‟ psychosocial development. Recent research has begun to explore whether, and how, exposure <b>to</b> <b>violence</b> impacts on moral development. Studies examining the nature of this association, however, have yielded contradictory results. While there is evidence to suggest that exposure <b>to</b> <b>violence</b> adversely affects moral development, it has also been shown that exposure <b>to</b> <b>violence</b> simply influences which moral reasoning style is likely to predominate – justice or care. Beginning with a brief review of moral development theories and of the psychosocial effects of exposure <b>to</b> <b>violence,</b> the present research explored the association between exposure <b>to</b> <b>violence</b> and moral development. This study aimed to determine whether there is an association between gender, moral orientation, and exposure <b>to</b> <b>violence.</b> Based on the literature, it was hypothesised that men would exhibit a justice moral orientation, while women would exhibit a moral orientation based on care. Further, it was expected that men would show higher levels of exposure <b>to</b> <b>violence</b> than women. Exposure <b>to</b> <b>violence</b> was expected <b>to</b> be significantly positively correlated with justice reasoning. A significant association was anticipated between gender, exposure <b>to</b> <b>violence</b> and moral orientation. In particular, it was hypothesised that greater exposure <b>to</b> <b>violence</b> would have an adverse effect on moral development. This association, in turn, was expected to be significantly related to gender...|$|R

Exposure <b>to</b> <b>violence</b> was related <b>to</b> both internalizing and externalizing problems. High levels of participation in extracurricular activities and positive parent–child relations appeared to function as protective factors, weakening the positive association between exposure <b>to</b> <b>violence</b> and externalizing problems.
