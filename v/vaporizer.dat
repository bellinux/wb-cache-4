5|$|The {{aging of}} high quality red wine {{required}} specialized knowledge as well as expensive storage and equipment, and resulted in an even more expensive end product. Judging from the advice given in many medieval documents on how to salvage wine that bore signs of going bad, preservation {{must have been a}} widespread problem. Even if vinegar was a common ingredient, there was only so much of it that could be used. In the 14th century cookbook Le Viandier there are several methods for salvaging spoiling wine; making sure that the wine barrels are always topped up or adding a mixture of dried and boiled white grape seeds with the ash of dried and burnt lees of white wine were both effective bactericides, even if the chemical processes were not understood at the time. Spiced or mulled wine was not only popular among the affluent, but was also considered especially healthy by physicians. Wine was believed to act as a kind of <b>vaporizer</b> and conduit of other foodstuffs to every part of the body, and the addition of fragrant and exotic spices would make it even more wholesome. Spiced wines were usually made by mixing an ordinary (red) wine with an assortment of spices such as ginger, cardamom, pepper, grains of paradise, nutmeg, cloves and sugar. These would be contained in small bags which were either steeped in wine or had liquid poured over them to produce hypocras and claré. By the 14th century, bagged spice mixes could be bought ready-made from spice merchants.|$|E
25|$|Vaporizer: A <b>vaporizer</b> is {{a device}} used to {{sublimate}} the active ingredients of plant material. Rather than burning the herb, which produces potentially irritating, toxic, or carcinogenic by-products; a <b>vaporizer</b> heats {{the material in}} a partial vacuum so that the active compounds contained in the plant boil off into a vapor. This method is often preferable when medically administrating the smoke substance, as opposed to directly pyrolyzing the plant material.|$|E

5000|$|In a study {{published}} in the Journal of Psychopharmacology in May 2008, it was stated that <b>vaporizers</b> were a [...] "suitable method for the administration of THC". A 2007 study by the University of California, San Francisco, published in the Journal of the American Academy of Neurology, found that [...] "there was virtually no exposure to harmful combustion products using the vaporizing device". A 2006 study performed by researchers at Leiden University found that <b>vaporizers</b> were [...] "safe and effective cannabinoid delivery system(s)". The study stated that the amount of THC delivered by <b>vaporizers</b> were equivalent to the amount delivered by smoking.

25|$|Besides {{the usage}} of {{dedicated}} pyrolyzers, pyrolysis GC of solid and liquid samples can be performed directly inside Programmable Temperature <b>Vaporizer</b> (PTV) injectors that provide quick heating (up to 30°C/s) and high maximum temperatures of 600–650°C. This is sufficient for some pyrolysis applications. The main advantage is that no dedicated instrument has to be purchased and pyrolysis can be performed as part of routine GC analysis. In this case quartz GC inlet liners have to be used. Quantitative data can be acquired, and good results of derivatization inside the PTV injector are published as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{vaporizing}} fuel injector, {{the third}} type, {{is similar to}} the air blast injector in that primary air is mixed with the fuel as it is injected into the combustion zone. However, the fuel-air mixture travels through a tube within the combustion zone. Heat from the combustion zone is transferred to the fuel-air mixture, vaporizing some of the fuel (mixing it better) before it is combusted. This method allows the fuel to be combusted with less thermal radiation, which helps protect the liner. However, the <b>vaporizer</b> tube may have serious durability problems with low fuel flow within it (the fuel inside of the tube protects the tube from the combustion heat).|$|E
25|$|Thermospray {{was first}} {{developed}} {{as a way to}} effectively remove solvent and vaporize samples more easily. This method involves the liquid sample from the LC flowing through an electrically heated <b>vaporizer</b> that simply heats the sample, removing any solvent and therefore putting the sample in the gas phase. Electrospray ionization (ESI) is similar to thermospray in the principle of removing the liquid solvent from the sample as much as possible, creating charged sample molecules either in small droplets or in gas form. Studies have shown that ESI can be as much as ten times more sensitive than other ionization methods coupled to LC. The spray methods are particularly useful considering that non-volatile samples can be analyzed easily through this method since the sample is not itself turned into a gas, the liquid is simply removed, pushing the sample into a gaseous or mist phase.|$|E

2500|$|A {{hybrid cycle}} {{combines}} {{the features of}} the closed- and open-cycle systems. In a hybrid, warm seawater enters a vacuum chamber and is flash-evaporated, similar to the open-cycle evaporation process. The steam vaporizes the ammonia working fluid of a closed-cycle loop {{on the other side of}} an ammonia <b>vaporizer.</b> [...] The vaporized fluid then drives a turbine to produce electricity. The steam condenses within the heat exchanger and provides desalinated water (see heat pipe).|$|E
2500|$|The tractor used a , inline four-cylinder engine. The {{engine was}} similar to the Ford Model T engine in many respects. Like many engines of its day, it was multifuel-capable; it was usually tuned for {{gasoline}} or kerosene, but alcohol could also be burned. (Tractor vaporising oil [...] existed in 1920 but was not yet widely used. It entered broader use in the 1930s and 1940s.) Like many other multifuel machines, the Fordson started on gasoline from a small auxiliary tank (just a few quarts) and then switched over to the main fuel tank once warmed up sufficiently (no more than 5 minutes). To handle the kerosene (or, rarely, TVO), the intake system had a <b>vaporizer</b> downstream of the carburetor. The mixture coming from the carburetor was intentionally rich, and the <b>vaporizer</b> heated it and mixed it with more air to lean it out to the final ratio before entering the intake manifold. The intake system also had a water-bath air cleaner to filter the dust out of the air inhaled by the engine (an invention that did not originate at Ford but that was still rather novel in 1917). Air cleaning is critical to engine lifespan, even for road vehicles and most especially for farming and construction vehicles (which work in environments where dirt is frequently stirred up into the air). The Fordson carburetor and air cleaner were designed by Holley. In later decades, the water bath would be replaced with an oil bath for better filtering performance.|$|E

40|$|All {{halothane}} <b>vaporizers</b> {{tested for}} leakage when turned off, leaked {{significant amounts of}} halo-thane and this may represent a hazard to patients liable to develop halothane hepatitis or malignant hyperpyrexia. The hazard from leaking <b>vaporizers</b> may be reduced considerably {{by the use of}} well-designed bypass units. Circuit contamination by halothane may still result from such sources as neoprene seals around flowmeters, breathing bags and anaesthetic hose which have had previous contact with halothane vapour, whether or not an apparatus is in use. The hazard from contami-nated hoses and bags may be reduced considerably by washing and then hanging in a halothane-free atmosphere for a day. The hazard from contaminated rubber or plastic components of the anaesthetic machine can be eliminated only by using one apparatus without the <b>vaporizers</b> having been attached at any time during its working life. Similarly, hazards may arise from trichloro-ethylene <b>vaporizers</b> and from circuit components contaminated with trichloroethylene.

2500|$|Machine {{malfunction}} or misuse {{may result}} in an inadequate delivery of anesthetic. Many Boyle's machines used in many hospitals have the oxygen regulator serving as a slave to the pressure in the nitrous oxide regulator, to enable the nitrous oxide cut-off safety feature. [...] If nitrous oxide delivery suffers due to a leak in its regulator or tubing, an 'inadequate' mixture can be delivered to the patient, causing awareness. Many World War II vintage Boyle 'F' models are still functional and used in UK hospitals. Their emergency oxygen flush valves {{have a tendency to}} release oxygen into the breathing system, which when added to the mixture set by the anesthesiologist, can lead to awareness. This may also be caused by an empty <b>vaporizer</b> (or nitrous oxide cylinder) or a malfunctioning intravenous pump or disconnection of its delivery tubing. Patient abandonment, when the anesthesiologist leaves, causes some cases of awareness and death.|$|E
2500|$|Yad Sarah {{started in}} the 1970s as a gemach (free-loan service) {{in the home of}} Rabbi Uri Lupolianski, who later served as mayor of Jerusalem from 2003 to 2008. At that time, Lupolianski was a high school teacher with a young family and one of his {{children}} needed a <b>vaporizer</b> during the winter, so his wife borrowed one from a neighbor. Upon hearing that such short-term-use items were hard to obtain, Lupolianski decided to start his own gemach by buying a few vaporizers to lend to others. People who heard about his gemach began dropping off other items which are also used for a short time, such as crutches, walkers and wheelchairs. With seed money from his father, Yaakov Lupolianski, and guidance from Kalman Mann, director general of Hadassah Medical Center, Lupolianski incorporated his gemach into a nationwide non-profit in 1976. Lupolianski named the organization Yad Sarah (Hebrew for [...] "Memorial to Sarah") in memory of his grandmother, Sarah, who had died in the Holocaust. Yad Sarah raises 92% of its operating budget from donations. The organization does not receive any government assistance. Yad Sarah has helped establish equipment-lending centers and repair workshops in Angola, Cameroon, El Salvador, Russia, South Africa, and Jordan.|$|E
2500|$|Polycyclic {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons are tar components produced by pyrolysis in smoldering organic matter and emitted into smoke. [...] Several of these PAH's are already toxic in their normal form, however, many of then can become more toxic to the liver. Due to the hydrophobic nature of PAH's {{they do not}} dissolve in water and are hard to expel from the body. [...] In {{order to make the}} PAH more soluble in water, the liver creates an enzyme called Cytochrome P450 which adds an additional oxygen to the PAH, turning it into a mutagenic epoxides, which is more soluble, but also more reactive. The first PAH to be identified as a carcinogen in tobacco smoke was benzopyrene, which been shown to toxicate into a diol epoxide and then permanently attach to nuclear DNA, which may either kill the cell or cause a genetic mutation. The DNA contains the information on how the cell function; in practice, it contains the recipes for protein synthesis. If the mutation inhibits programmed cell death, the cell can survive to become a cancer cell, a cell that does not function like a normal cell. The carcinogenicity is radiomimetic, i.e. similar to that produced by ionizing nuclear radiation. Tobacco manufacturers have experimented with combustion less <b>vaporizer</b> technology to allow cigarettes to be consumed without the formation of carcinogenic benzopyrenes. Although such products have become increasingly popular, they still represent a very small fraction of the market, and no conclusive evidence has shown to prove or disprove the positive health claims.|$|E
