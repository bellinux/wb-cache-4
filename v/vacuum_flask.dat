5|$|Hydrogen was {{liquefied}} for {{the first}} time by James Dewar in 1898 by using regenerative cooling and his invention, the <b>vacuum</b> <b>flask.</b> He produced solid hydrogen the next year. Deuterium was discovered in December 1931 by Harold Urey, and tritium was prepared in 1934 by Ernest Rutherford, Mark Oliphant, and Paul Harteck. Heavy water, which consists of deuterium in the place of regular hydrogen, was discovered by Urey's group in 1932. François Isaac de Rivaz built the first de Rivaz engine, an internal combustion engine powered by a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen in 1806. Edward Daniel Clarke invented the hydrogen gas blowpipe in 1819. The Döbereiner's lamp and limelight were invented in 1823.|$|E

25|$|The Prius is a {{power-split}} or series-parallel (full) hybrid, {{sometimes referred}} to as a combined hybrid, a vehicle that can be propelled by gasoline or electric power or both. Wind resistance is reduced by a drag coefficient of 0.25 (0.29 for 2000 model) with a Kammback design to reduce air resistance. Lower rolling-resistance tires are used to reduce road friction. An electric water pump eliminates serpentine belts. In the US and Canada, a <b>vacuum</b> <b>flask</b> is used to store hot coolant when the vehicle is powered off for reuse so as to reduce warm-up time. The Prius engine makes use of the Atkinson cycle.|$|E

25|$|James Dewar, the {{scientist}} after whom the Dewar (<b>vacuum</b> <b>flask)</b> is named, {{spent much time}} studying activated carbon and published a paper regarding its adsorption capacity with regard to gases. In this paper, he discovered that cooling the carbon to liquid nitrogen temperatures allowed it to adsorb significant quantities of numerous air gases, among others, that could then be recollected by simply allowing the carbon to warm again and that coconut based carbon was superior for the effect. He uses oxygen as an example, wherein the activated carbon would typically adsorb the atmospheric concentration (21%) under standard conditions, but release over 80% oxygen if the carbon was first cooled to low temperatures.|$|E

2500|$|At first, {{a single}} SQUID {{detector}} {{was used to}} successively measure the magnetic field {{at a number of}} points around the subject's head. This was cumbersome, and, in the 1980s, MEG manufacturers began to arrange multiple sensors into arrays to cover a larger area of the head. Present-day MEG arrays are set in a helmet-shaped <b>vacuum</b> <b>flask</b> that typically contain 300 sensors, covering most of the head.

In this context, {{it was the first}} bomb in which most of the energy released came from nuclear reaction stages that followed the primary nuclear fission stage of the atomic bomb. The Ivy Mike bomb was a factory-like building, rather than a deliverable weapon. At its center, a very large cylindrical, insulated <b>vacuum</b> <b>flask</b> or cryostat, held cryogenic liquid deuterium in a volume of about 1000 liters (160 kilograms in mass, if this volume had been completely filled). Then, a conventional atomic bomb (the [...] "primary") {{at one end of the}} bomb was used to create the conditions of extreme temperature and pressure that were needed to set off the thermonuclear reaction.|$|E

50|$|Liquid {{nitrogen}} is a {{cryogenic fluid}} {{that can cause}} rapid freezing on contact with living tissue. When appropriately insulated from ambient heat, liquid nitrogen can be stored and transported, for example in <b>vacuum</b> <b>flasks.</b> The temperature is held constant at 77 K by slow boiling of the liquid, resulting {{in the evolution of}} nitrogen gas. Depending on the size and design, the holding time of <b>vacuum</b> <b>flasks</b> ranges from a few hours to a few weeks. The development of pressurised super-insulated vacuum vessels has enabled liquefied nitrogen to be stored and transported over longer time periods with losses reduced to 2% per day or less.|$|R

A removable pot, with handle and lid, fits inside the <b>vacuum</b> <b>flask.</b> The pot and contents are heated to cooking temperature, and then sealed in the flask. The flask simply reduces heat loss to a minimum, so that the food remains at cooking temperature for a long time, and cooks without continued heating. Note that the food is not cooked in a vacuum. It is cooked inside a <b>vacuum</b> <b>flask.</b> The hollow evacuated wall of the cooker thermally insulates its contents from the environment, so they remain hot for several hours.|$|E
