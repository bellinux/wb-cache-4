40|$|Background: Although the {{clitoris}} is {{more sensitive}} to stimulation than the vagina, and its innervation more conducive to sensory feedback, the field of sexual psychophysiology relies heavily on the measurement of vaginal pulse amplitude (VPA). This is most likely due to the availability of an instrument, the vaginal photoplethysmograph, that is easy to place and that allows for relatively stable measurement. Recently, two studies (Gerritsen et al., 2009; Suschinsky et al., 2015) have used clitoral photoplethysmography to assess blood flow in the clitoris. However, only clitoral blood volume (CBV), thought to represent general clitoral vasocongestion, was reported rather than clitoral pulse amplitude (CPA). In the current study, we developed and tested a new clitoral photoplethysmograph for the measurement of CPA. Methods: After several design iterations, we selected two {{different versions of the}} new device, which differed in their orientation of the sensor and light source (i. e. parallel and angled). We tested the two newly developed clitoral sensors in 15 premenopausal, sexually functional women (mean age = 26. 6, SD = 4. 7). Vaginal pulse amplitude (VPA) was assessed simultaneously using a standard vaginal photoplethysmograph. Women wore elastic spandex shorts to enable stable placement of the instruments. The women viewed a three-minute erotic and an anxiety-inducing film segment with each clitoral sensor, and were presented with neutral video excerpts prior to the first and after each subsequent video. In addition, they were asked to use a lever to indicate their subjective level of sexual arousal during the erotic video presentations. Results: Due to technical problems, the data of three women could not be used. For the remaining participants we obtained satisfactory signals, especially when using the non-parallel clitoral device, which detected clear pulse waves in all women. Less than 2 % of the clitoral and <b>vaginal</b> <b>device</b> data were impacted by artifacts. Main effects of Film and the interaction between Film and Epoch were stronger, in terms of effect size, for the clitoral than for the <b>vaginal</b> <b>device.</b> Furthermore, CPA followed more closely the changes in intensity of the sexual films than VPA: The clitoral pulse signal grew more steadily throughout the three-minute erotic video sequence, showing a substantial increase during the third minute, when vaginal intercourse was depicted. The vaginal pulse wave, on the other hand, showed the fastest and strongest increase during early parts of the erotic video (depicting petting and oral sex). Both within- and between-subject correlations between genital response and subjective sexual arousal were higher for the clitoral than for the <b>vaginal</b> <b>device.</b> Key Words: clitoral pulse amplitude, clitoral photoplethysmography, sexual arousal, vaginal pulse amplitudestatus: accepte...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} whether patients can understand {{and use the}} <b>vaginal</b> pH <b>device</b> in the diagnosis of vaginitis. To compare whether vaginal pH readings determined by patients and healthcare providers are similar. To {{determine whether}} vaginal pH can reduce inappropriate over-the-counter (OTC) antifungal medication use and improve the correct diagnosis of vaginitis. Methods: One hundred and fifty-one women indicated their belief about the cause of their vaginal infection, read the instructions of the <b>vaginal</b> pH <b>device</b> package insert, used the device and interpreted the findings. The patient interpretations were compared with results obtained by healthcare providers, blinded to patient findings. Results: Over 96 % of patients stated that they could easily read the instructions, use the <b>vaginal</b> pH <b>device</b> and interpret the readings. They obtained the same readings as healthcare professionals (Kappa = 0. 9). Restricting the use of OTC antifungal medications to those individuals with vaginitis symptoms and vaginal pH ≤ 4. 5 significantly reduced inappropriate use by approximately 50 %, Fisher’s exact test, p-value = 0. 018. Conversely, seeking healthcare provider assessment with vaginal pH> 4. 5, leads to correct diagnosis of vaginitis. Conclusions: The <b>vaginal</b> pH <b>device</b> {{can be used as}} an OTC diagnostic tool by consumers when a vaginal infection is suspected.

The study compared them with commercial vaginal inserts (CIDR®) and polyurethane sponges impregnated with MAP. In Experiment 1, the device loss rate, the degree of vaginitis during the device removal, the count and identification of bacterial colonies at the device insertion and removal, and efficiency in estrous synchronization and estrus temporal distribution were evaluated. Pubertal ewes {{at the beginning of}} the breeding season were randomly allocated to three experimental groups: CIDR®, PSP (polyurethane sponge) and OB®. No device losses occurred in any group, but the use of OB® caused milder signs of vaginitis than polyurethane sponges, with a similar vaginal bacterial growth and microbiota than the CIDR group. The estrus distribution was more disperse in the CIDR than PSP or OB groups. In Experiment 2, pregnancy rates using CIDR® or OB® devices were compared, with estrus manifestation (85. 4 % and 89. 8 %) and pregnancy rates (58. 3 % and 49. 0 %) being similar between groups (P> 0. 05), respectively.

40|$|The aim was {{to develop}} a timed {{artificial}} insemination (TAI) system in suckled beef cows. Cows (n= 227), 60 - 80 days postpartum, received estradiol benzoate (5 mg) and a <b>vaginal</b> <b>device</b> containing 250 µg of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA; day 0). On day six, cloprostenol (125 µg) and eCG (400 IU) were administrated and calves were weaned for 88 h. The devices were removed on day seven (BioRep group) or on day eight (TAI group). All cows of TAI group and cows of BioRep group that did not exhibit standing estrus received GnRH (100 µg) on day 9. In experiment I, the follicular growth was monitored daily by transrectal ultrasound exams, from day 6 to day 9. The average size of the dominant follicle on day nine was 11. 1 ± 0. 99 mm (BioRep, n= 7) and 11. 5 ± 0. 65 mm (TAI, n= 7) and all animals ovulated. In experiment II, the BioRep group cows (n= 106) were observed for estrous behavior after withdrawal of the device, twice a day for 48 h, and inseminated 12 h after detection. In the TAI group (n= 107), the devices were withdrawn on day eight and after 24 h these cows and those from the BioRep group, which were not stand in estrus, received 100 µg of GnRH and TAI 16 h later.

No experimento 1, foi utilizado sêmen de um reprodutor e 67 ovelhas com estros sincronizados, divididas aleatoriamente entre os grupos: sêmen congelado (SC 1) e sêmen congelado capacitado in vitro (SCC 1). As ovelhas foram submetidas à IA, com 50 x 106 espermatozóides, 56 e 60 horas, respectivamente, após a retirada das esponjas impregnadas com progesterona. No grupo SCC 1, a taxa de prenhez foi de 48, 39 % (15 / 31) significativamente superior a do grupo SC 1 de 25 % (9 / 36). No experimento 2, utilizou-se um reprodutor e 100 ovelhas com os estros sincronizados, distribuídas aleatoriamente entre três grupos: sêmen fresco (SF 2), SC 2 e SCC 2. Nos grupos SF 2 e SC 2 as fêmeas foram inseminadas com 100 x 106 espermatozóides e 56 horas após a retirada da progesterona. No grupo das fêmeas inseminadas com espermatozóides capacitados in vitro, utilizou-se 50 x 106 espermatozóides e um intervalo de 60 horas após retirada da progesterona. As taxas de prenhez diagnosticadas nos diferentes grupos experimentais foram: SF 2 60, 9 % (25 / 41), SC 2 56, 70 % (17 / 30) e SCC 2 44, 90 % (13 / 29), não existindo diferença estatística entre os grupos.

The ovine artificial insemination (AI) by laparoscopy was described {{the first time}} in 1982, since this time frozen semen became a tool for use under field conditions. Today one research goal is to achieve high preganancies rates after AI using a reduced number of frozen/thawed spermatozoa per dosis. The experiments were carried out with the objective to determine the pregnancy rate of ewes inseminated by laparoscopy, using 50 x 106 thawed and in vitro capacited spermatozoa. In the experiment 1 was used semen of one fertily ram and 67 ewes with synchronized estrus. The females were randomly distributed among two experimental groups: inseminated with frozen semen (SC 1) or frozen and in vitro capacitated semen (SCC 1). The ewes were submitted to the AI with 50 x 106 spermatozoa, 56 (SC 1) or 60 (SCC 1) hours, respectively, after retreat of the intra <b>vaginal</b> <b>device</b> impregnated with progesterona. In the group SCC 1 the pregnancy rate was 48, 39 % (15 / 31) significantly different from the 25 % (9 / 36) observed in the group SC 1.

The literature shows discordant results, {{probably due to the}} heterogeneity of populations, variables and outcomes studied. The results of our study agree with the literature about previous deliveries and Bishop score, but not regarding maternal age and fetal weight. The objective {{of this study is to}} verify predictors of vaginal delivery in a specific and more homogeneous population of prolonged pregnancies induced with prostaglandins PGE 2. Methods We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study with analytic component. The population was made up of 145 women hospitalized only for ‘‘induction of labor in post-term pregnancy’’ after the 41 st week treated with the <b>vaginal</b> <b>device</b> Propess (prostaglandin PGE 2). The ‘‘outcome’’ studied was the type of delivery at the end of the induction: vaginal or cesarean. The maternal variables analyzed were: age, weight, height, BMI, BMI percentage increase due to the gestational weight gain, previous deliveries, previous curettage of the uterine cavity, and Bishop score at the beginning of the induction; while the fetal variables were: gestational age, AFI and weight at birth. A descriptive analysis of the population, a monovariate and a multivariate logistic regression was carried. Results 80. 7 % of the population had a vaginal delivery after the induction. Four significant covariates were included into the final model: age > 35 years and the fetal weight at the birth > 3500 g resulted very strong risk factors for failed induction (respectively OR 4. 20, p= 0. 006 and OR 3. 63, p = 0. 013); while previous deliveries and a high Bishop score resulted as protective factors towards delivery induction failure (respec- tively OR 0. 16, p = 0. 028 and OR 0. 62, p = 0. 034). Conclusions Our results agree with the literature concerning previous deliveries and Bishop score. However, not all previous studies found results similar to ours regarding maternal age and fetal weight. This could be explained by the peculiarity of our population.

When stored at 4 °C, but not when stored at 40 °C/ 75 % RH, the RiR formulation offered protection against structural and conformational changes to BSA. The insert also retained matrix integrity and release characteristics. The results demonstrate that lypophilised gels can provide relative protection against degradation at lower temperatures compared to semi-solid gels. The major mechanism of degradation at 40 °C/ 75 % RH was shown to be protein aggregation. Finally, in a preliminary study, we found that addition of trehalose to the formulation significantly reduces the rate of BSA degradation compared to the original formulation when stored at 40 °C/ 75 % RH. Establishing the mechanism of degradation, and finding that degradation is decelerated {{in the presence of}} trehalose, will help inform further development of RiRs specifically and polymer based freeze-dried systems in general...|$|R
40|$|The true {{incidence}} of pelvic organ prolapse (POP) {{is difficult to}} determine, however, {{it is a common}} condition reported to affect 50 % of parous women over 50 years of age. In their widely cited study, Olsen et al found a lifetime risk of 11 % (by age 80 years) for women to undergo surgery for POP and urinary incontinence. The risk of recurrent POP after surgery is reported to be between 10 - 30 %. Although non-life threatening, POP is an embarrassing condition that has been shown to negatively impact on various quality of life domains. Population modeling studies have projected a population of 9 billion by 2040 and also an increase in demand for services to care for female pelvic floor disorders. Currently non-surgical treatment modalities include expectant management, pelvic floor exercises and the use of support <b>devices</b> i. e. <b>vaginal</b> pessaries. <b>Vaginal</b> support <b>devices</b> date back to at least 1550 BC, and have remained the mainstay of treatment for POP until recent advances in pelvic floor reconstructive surgery...|$|R

40|$|The {{proposed}} work is {{the conception}} of a novel intra-body sensor device capable of measuring and gathering long-term intra-vaginal pH and temperature. At its early stage this project focuses on the analysis of different design concepts and operation principles of such intra <b>vaginal</b> sensor <b>device.</b> Traditional methods of intra-vaginal pH sampling, which rely on analysis of vaginal secretions or discharge from lateral vaginal walls, are difficult in long-term and often fraught {{with the potential for}} errors. Therefore this paper focuses on the analysis of such sensor's shape, form, size and fabric in order to enable precise, continuous acquisition of females' and animals' intra-vaginal pH and temperature at the right place inside the vagina. The aim is to set such operation principles, which will enable convenient collection and analysis of continuous vaginal pH and temperature samples for the purpose of further study. The objective is to achieve at least as accurate results as with the discrete analysis of clinicallyobtained intra-vaginal specimens, if not better. The data obtained with such sensors could enable a development of insemination prediction and gynaecological disorders detection models, which deployed to, for example smartphone devices, will help to attain high conception rate for animals and eventually improve the control of the vaginal health for women...|$|R
40|$|Microporous poly(e-caprolactone) {{matrices}} {{were loaded}} with an antibacterial agent, ciprofloxacin and an antifungal agent, miconazole nitrate, respectively, for investigations {{of their potential}} as controlled <b>vaginal</b> delivery <b>devices.</b> Ciprofloxacin loadings up to 15 % w/w could be obtained by increasing the drug content of the poly(e-caprolactone) solution, while the actual loadings of miconazole were much lower (1 - 3 % w/w) due to drug partition into methanol during the solvent extraction. The kinetics of ciprofloxacin release in simulated vaginal fluid at 37 degrees C were characterised by a small burst release phase in the first 24 h, low drug release up to 7 days (10 %) and gradual release of up to 80 % of the drug content by day 30. Meanwhile, the release kinetics of miconazole-loaded matrices could be effectively described by the Higuchi model with 100 % drug release from the highest loaded matrices (3. 2 % w/w) in 13 days. Ciprofloxacin or miconazole released over 30 and 13 days, respectively, from poly(e-caprolactone) matrices into simulated vaginal fluid retained high levels of antimicrobial activity in excess of 80 % of {{the activity of the}} free drug.

To better understand the genetic basis of BT regulation, a genome-wide association study was conducted utilizing crossbred steers and heifers totaling 239 animals of unknown pedigree and breed fraction.

Posterior heritability estimates were moderate to high and were estimated to be 0. 68 and 0. 21 for AUCS 5 D and AUCW 5 D, respectively. Moderately positive correlations between direct genomic values for AUCS 5 D and AUCW 5 D (0. 40) were found, although {{a small percentage of}} the top 5 % 1 -Mb windows were in common.

Through modelling of the release data using the Higuchi equation, and determination of the silicone solubility of the drugs, the apparent silicone elastomer diffusion coefficients of the drugs have been calculated. Furthermore, {{in an attempt to}} develop a quantitative model for predicting release rates of new drug substances from these <b>vaginal</b> ring <b>devices,</b> it has been observed that linear relationships exist between the log of the silicone solubility of the drug (mg ml- 1) and the reciprocal of its melting point (K- 1) (y= 3. 558 x- 9. 620, R= 0. 77), and also between the log of the diffusion coefficient (cm 2 s- 1) and the molecular weight of the drug molecule (g mol- 1) (y=- 0. 0068 x- 4. 0738, R= 0. 95). Given that the silicone solubility and silicone diffusion coefficient are the major parameters influencing the permeation of drugs through silicone elastomers, it is now possible to predict through use of the appropriate mathematical equations both matrix-type and reservoir-type intravaginal ring release rates simply from a knowledge of drug melting temperature and molecular weight...|$|R
30|$|Earlier {{studies have}} {{taught us that}} LH has certain {{disadvantages}} with respect to patient safety when compared to VH and AH. Technical developments have already contributed to the enhanced safety of LH. However, further simplifying the LH is necessary, since reducing the operation time of LH may reduce health care costs and complication rates [20, 21]. Our study demonstrates that the colpotomy step in LH should be simplified. Not only is this surgical step time consuming bu it is also regarded as significantly more difficult when compared to AH. A vaginal approach of the colpotomy step may solve these issues. A surgical instrument {{was designed as a}} uterine manipulator with an integrated <b>vaginal</b> colpotomizer.

Inicialmente, {{los animales}} fueron asignados por muestreo aleatorio en dos grupos de 42 (G 1 y G 2). G 1 fue tratado por 12 días con un dispositivo intravaginal con 0. 3 gr. de progesterona y, {{en el momento}} de su retiro, se les aplicaron 250 UI de PMSG. 21. 4 % (9 / 42) de los animales perdieron el dispositivo y fueron descartados. G 2 actuó como control. Al finalizar el tratamiento de inducción, las corderas se manejaron como un solo grupo, encastándose por 34 días con tres carneros Austral, provistos de arneses marcadores. Presentaron celo y fueron montadas 96. 9 % de las corderas de G 1 (40 / 42) y 9. 5 % (4 / 42) de G 2. En G 1 parió el 75. 7 % (25 / 33) durante 7 días, con 159. 3 % de parición (42 corderos). En G 2 no se presentaron partos. El tratamiento utilizado es un buen {{inductor}} de celo y ovulación en la época de anestro profundo. La diferencia entre grupos es altamente significativa (p ­ 0. 01). La pérdida de dipositivos intravaginales fue extraordinariamente alta. En las condiciones de este experimento, las borregas Austral no presentan una actividad sexual importante en noviembre. No se observaron diferencias significativas en peso y condición corporal entre los animales que parieron 0, 1 ó 2 corderos. The effects of out of season oestrus-ovulation induction treatment were studied in eighty four fourteen month old Austral breed hoggets, weighing 39. 4 ± 3. 4 kg, through their reproductive and productive response and the natural reproductive activity during November (Spring). Initially, the animals were randomly allocated into 2 groups of 42 each. Group 1 was treated for 12 days with a 0. 3 g progesterone intravaginal device {{and at the moment}} of withdrawal, injected with 250 IU of PMSG. Nine out of 42 (21. 4 %) devices were lost and those animals were discarded. Group 2 acted as control. The hoggets were managed as a single group and paddock mated with 3 Austral harnessed rams for 34 days. 96. 9 % (32 / 33) of the treated hoggets in Group 1 showed oestrus and were mounted. 7. 1 % (3 / 42) in Group 2 were mounted. 75. 7 % of the hoggets in Group 1 lambed (25 / 33) over 7 days, producing 42 lambs (159. 3 %).

30|$|For the {{treatment}} of cystocoele, five randomized trials on the seven published show {{that the risk of}} anatomic recurrence is reduced with NAS mesh. The global rate of relapse at 1  year is estimated around 37 % after traditional surgery (87 patients out of 237) and at 11 % with NAS mesh (27 patients out of 247) [6, 10 – 12]. We must remain careful: our review does not represent a meta-analysis, and many biases may exist. But NAS meshes seem to bring an anatomic benefit when treating cystocoele. One of these studies demonstrates after a 3 -year follow-up the anatomic benefit of NAS meshes (12 % of recurrence after 104 grafts versus 41 % after 96 traditional surgery) [22]. Carey did not find any benefit with a sub-vesical mesh, but in his surgical description, it was the only observation where prosthesis was left free without any suspension [12]. This technical variation seems to be important: in all other studies, sub-vesical mesh is suspended by its four arms. Carey changed his technique, using a <b>vaginal</b> support <b>device</b> after intervention and during 1  month [55]. Clinical results are not yet enough to conclude, and no comparative study has been published. The second trial showing no benefit of NAS prostheses was stopped after an unacceptable rate of meshes expositions (five patients out of 32, 15 %) [19]. Hysterectomy was also systematic during the cure of cystocoele. The high number of failures at 1  year (59 % and 72 %), the concomitant hysterectomy and also the surgeon skills were questioned [56].|$|R

The ewes fed diets containing two levels of metabolizable energy, 2. 0 or 2. 3 Mcal kg - 1 with 115 g kg - 1 DM crud protein for 21 days prior to mating period. After 7 days of experiment, the ewes were synchronised with intra <b>vaginal</b> CIDR <b>devices</b> containing 1. 9 g progesterone for 14 days. Ewes received 300 or 500 IU of PMSG injection at CIDR removal time and later mated with Zel or Shal ram. All important reproductive parameters such as ewe fertility, prolificacy, lambing rate, lamb mortality and twining measured. The results showed that Shal rams increased ewe fertility (p< 0. 05) but not affected by PMSG administration and flushing. Ewes bred to Shal rams had higher fertility compared to ewes bred to Zel rams. Prolificacy was not affected by PMSG administration but it was significantly affected by diet and ram (p< 0. 05). High dietary energy resulted in a higher prolificacy. Lambing rate changed with energy level and ram breed (p< 0. 05) and high level of energy increased lambing rate by 26 %. Administration of 500 IU PMSG resulted in higher lamb mortality in compared to 300 IU (p< 0. 05).

As a proof-of-concept, we tested the in vivo release of progesterone from a silicone elastomer <b>vaginal</b> ring <b>device.</b> Methods: Six female pig-tailed macaques were treated with a GnRH agonist (Lupron) prior to ring placement. Four macaques received a progesterone-loaded silicone ring, and two macaques received a blank silicone ring.

Results: The median plasma progesterone levels for macaques with a progesterone IVR were 13, 973 pg/ml (day 3), 12, 342 pg/ml (day 7), 10, 112 pg/ml (day 14), 8445 pg/ml (day 21) and 8061 pg/ml (day 28), with a significant decrease from day 14 to day 21 (P = 0. 0286). The median plasma progesterone levels for macaques with a blank IVR were 221 ±±± ±± 88 pg/ml. Macaques with a progesterone IVR had CVL progesterone levels of 20, 935 pg/ml (day 7), 6892 pg/ml (day 21) and 11, 515 pg/ml (day 28). Macaques with a blank IVR had CVL progesterone levels of 29 �± 13 pg/ml.
