40|$|The article {{argues that}} {{judicial}} persons (legal entities) constitute a particular {{class of objects}} {{that are able to}} receive proper names and that are distinct from typical ergonymic objects — business institutions. To designate the corresponding class of proper names the author suggests the term themonym (from Ancient Greek θέμις ‘law, habit, custom’). Based on themonyms pertaining to the residential community of Gorny Shchit (Chkalovsky district, Ekaterinburg, Russia) as registered in the Unified Federal Register of Legal Entities, the author studies the situation of naming as applied to this kind of objects. The article illustrates the almost complete absence of functional specificity of themonyms as proper names: they are not uniques, being used alongside with more reliable and more unambiguous designators like <b>VAT</b> <b>identification</b> <b>number</b> or Primary State registration number which explains the existence of specific homonymy among themonyms (the latter is sometimes due to the shadow economy). Besides that, themonyms do not display the ability to be used for advertising purpose which is far from being typical for names used in business, although the author is inclined to believe that the advertising function can be realized under some circumstances...|$|E

40|$|Emergency {{vehicles}} worldwide have unique aerial <b>identification</b> <b>numbering</b> on the rooves {{for ease}} of identification for aerial support, particularly if the individuals crewing the vehicle need exigent assistance. Drawing on an actual event from the 2013 Blue Mountains Wildfire, this paper highlights how aerial support from a water bombing aircraft was unable to read the existing black aerial <b>identification</b> <b>numbering</b> of a fire appliance because the black <b>identification</b> <b>number</b> coalesced with the black plumes of smoke emitted by the wildfire. Given the extensive technological development {{in the application of}} high visibility markings over the past twenty-one years, the current black and aerial <b>identification</b> <b>numbering</b> used by the New South Wales Rural Fire Service on their fire appliances is far from adequate, doing little to provide optimum safety for fire ground crews in a wildfire. This paper concludes that the current black aerial <b>identification</b> <b>numbering</b> should be replaced with high visibility aerial <b>identification</b> <b>numbering</b> markings because these have greater visibility for aerial support in a wildfire particularly in the colours of red, lime, yellow, orange or blue. 15 page(s...|$|R
