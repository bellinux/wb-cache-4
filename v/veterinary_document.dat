40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the changes in {{scientific}} rhetoric {{and the impact of}} these changes on the culture of the last five centuries. The horse is used as focal point for the study since he is a prevalent part of the societies directly affected by scientific rhetoric. ^ The Introduction serves as a framework for the study addressing several issues regarding theories of scientific rhetoric. Chapter One {{focuses on the}} early rhetoricians, such as Aristotle and Plutarch, and their works. ^ Chapter Two moves into the scientific writing of the Renaissance. The majority of work is philosophic rather than empirical. This chapter also examines the literature which evolved from this era {{as a result of the}} scientific discourse. ^ Chapter Three continues the study of scientific rhetoric addressing eighteenth-century notions of science prevalent in the culture. Comments on equus in art and sport are also added in this chapter. ^ Chapter Four focuses on examples of scientific rhetoric as society in the twentieth century recognizes it. Along with the literature of the era, <b>veterinary</b> <b>documents</b> and handbooks used by horse owners are studied as well as works addressing horse trading. ^ Chapter Five attempts to bring the notions of scientific rhetoric into the twentieth century. The problem lies in the fact that by this time, scientific discourse was well established separate from philosophic discourse. ^ Overall, the tracing of the emergence of scientific discourse and its development is examined through literature which utilizes a variety of issues surrounding the horse. ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This research, in {{progress}} {{at the time}} of this abstract, surveys the current state of academic <b>veterinary</b> libraries and <b>documents</b> recent changes across the international academic veterinary library community. Specifically, it will gather evidence from veterinary colleague libraries that are listed in the international veterinary libraries directory, maintained by the Veterinary Medical Libraries Section of the Medical Library Association, to document any closing and merging of academic veterinary libraries, to compile all evidence and descriptive information concerning changes in space, collections, reporting relationships and librarian assignments. Methods: Principal investigators developed an online survey, administered using Qualtrics, to gather data from current and recently retired veterinary librarians. Additionally, Qualtrics provides standard reporting and analysis tools. The survey is scheduled for distribution in January 2015. Responses will be compiled and analyzed during the spring. Results will be shared with participants and other colleagues. The survey will be repeated triennially using the 2015 survey as a benchmark.

40|$|The {{traditional}} management, {{conservation and}} use of plant diversity with focus on medicinal plants found in and around home gardens in Loma and Gena Bosa Districts of Dawro Zone, Southern Ethiopia was studied. Data was collected between September 2006 and March 2007 to get relevant information and plant specimen of different seasons. The information was gathered through semi-structured interview conducted on 112 traditional healers whose ages ranged between 15 to 121 years. A total of 178 medicinal plants distributed in 64 families were documented in this study. The most frequently used plant part was leaf while the growth form with the highest number (43. 82 %) of representatives among the plants encountered {{in this study were}} herbs. About 57. 9 % medicinal plants were collected from wild while 24. 1 % were cultivated and 18. 5 % were both cultivated and collected from wild. A total of 62 human and 27 <b>veterinary</b> diseases were <b>documented</b> in the study. However, only 58 % of the traditional healers exercised their indigenous knowledge on treating both human and livestock diseases, while 41. 96 % practiced treatment of only human diseases. The medicinal plant resources and the associated knowledge of herbal medicine need to be used in a sustainable way and developed for more effective use in the future...|$|R
40|$|In {{veterinary}} medical education, reduction, replacement, {{and refinement}} (the three Rs) must be considered. Three clinical skills in anesthesia {{were identified as}} challenging to students: endotracheal intubation, intravenous catheterization, and drug dose calculations. The aims of this project were to evaluate students' perception of their level of confidence in performing these three clinical skills in <b>veterinary</b> anesthesia, to <b>document</b> the extent of students' previous experience in performing these three tasks, and to describe students' emotional states during this training. Veterinary students completed a series of four surveys over the period of their pre-clinical training to evaluate the usefulness of high-fidelity models for skill acquisition in endotracheal intubation and intravenous catheterization. In addition, practice and ongoing assessment in drug dose calculations were performed. The curriculum {{during this period of}} training progressed from lectures and non-animal training, to anesthesia of pigs undergoing surgery from which they did not recover, and finally to anesthesia of dogs and cats in a neutering clinic. The level of confidence {{for each of the three}} clinical skills increased over the study period. For each skill, the number of students with no confidence decreased to zero and the proportion of students with higher levels of confidence increased. The high-fidelity models for endotracheal intubation and intravenous catheterization used to complement the live-animal teaching were considered a useful adjunct to the teaching of clinical skills in veterinary anesthesia. With practice, students became more confident performing drug dose calculations...|$|R
40|$|Only {{in recent}} years have studies emerged that {{highlight}} the medical consequences of spay or neutering an animal. However, the method used to categorize dogs in a majority of studies impedes the progress to discovery: <b>veterinary</b> literature <b>documents</b> the neuter status of animals as 2 ̆ 2 neutered 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 intact 2 ̆ 2 to study an outcome. In the context of disease outcome, this method assumes that all neutered dogs are created equal. In contrast, a small number of veterinary literature report that the length of exposure to hormones determines the outcome for a disease, thus, not all neutered dogs are created equal. A previous study showed that categorizing dogs in this fashion, called dichotomous binning (DB), gives way to misleading assumptions about the consequences of spay or neuter. It is therefore likely that most studies err by implying there is no difference between a dog neutered at 2 ̆ 2 four 2 ̆ 2 years and neutered at 2 ̆ 2 fourteen 2 ̆ 2 years when in fact a difference actually exists. In 2009, our laboratory reported that female Rottweiler dogs, which kept their ovaries longer, lived longer. By this merit, we hypothesized that in our data set of Scottish Terriers, 1) keeping gonads longer is associated with lower risk for bladder cancer (TCC). The first objective of this research was to investigate whether there was a window of time of gonadal exposure that was protective against bladder cancer. The second objective was to determine if there were sex-specific differences in the relationship between length of gonad exposure and bladder cancer risk. To test this hypothesis, we grouped dogs into three based on their length of gonadal exposure (LGE). Using logistic regression analyses in SPSS Statistics Data Editor, we studied associations between length of gonadal exposure (LGE) and TCC. We performed the same analysis using the same dogs but categorized by DB, and compared findings derived from using DB and LGE classification methods. After adjusting for covariates, the DB model yielded no significant difference in TCC risk between neutered and intact dogs, while the LGE model revealed that gonadal exposure may be a risk factor for TCC: LGE dogs with the shortest length of gonadal exposure had a borderline significant increased risk of TCC (OR, 3. 39; 95...|$|R
40|$|The {{value of}} collaborative, case-based, and problem-based {{learning}} has received Increased attention In recent years. Several studies have <b>documented</b> <b>veterinary</b> staff and students' generally positive feedback on group learning activities, but one largely unaddressed question Is how students actually {{learn from each}} other. This study examined how second-year veterinary students learned from each other during a collaborative, case-based learning project. Data were students' written reflections on their learning In the veterinary course and the specific learning experience, and a matched pre-and post-task questionnaire. Consistent with prior research describing veterinary students as Individualistic learners, {{only a third of}} students spontaneously mentioned learning from each other as one of their most effective strategies. However, when prompted to describe a time when they felt that group members were really learning from each other, students reported highly valuable collaborative learning processes, which they explicitly linked to learning and understanding benefits. Questionnaire data were consistent, showing that students became more positive toward several aspects of the activity as well as toward group work In general. One unexpected finding was the lack of a relationship between students' self-evaluation of their learning and how well group members knew each other. These findings provide strong support for the educational value of collaborative, case-based learning. In light of other research evidence (using observation data) that the amount of time students actually engage In high-level collaborative processes may be rather limited, this article points to the need for veterinary teachers to better prepare students for group learning activities...|$|R
