25|$|Coal {{comes in}} four main types or ranks: lignite or brown coal, {{bituminous}} coal or black coal, anthracite and graphite. Each {{type of coal}} has a certain set of physical parameters which are mostly controlled by moisture, <b>volatile</b> <b>content</b> (in terms of aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons) and carbon content.|$|E
500|$|Temperatures {{estimated}} for the erupted rocks cover a wide range, {{with some}} exceeding [...] These rocks are of enigmatic origin, {{which may be}} geothermal or magmatic, {{with the presence of}} lava bombs of magnetite lava supporting the magmatic origin theory. Other viewpoints consider the texture and chemical composition of the rocks as evidence that metasomatism of andesitic rocks formed the magnetite [...] "lavas". The role of a post-magmatic fluid phase, which was inferred from inclusions in crystals, has also been suggested. Some magnetite was oxidized to hematite, probably under the influence of rainwater as indicated by isotope analysis. Only a minor amount of hematite is primary. Isotope data indicate that the formation of this magnetite magma was accompanied by the segregation of plagioclase. This plagioclase may have generated the rhyodacite lava dome. An iron-phosphate-rich magma generated the magnetite lava flows after release of volatile substances. The magma was probably bordering on forming a two-phase melt containing nelsonite and rhyolite. A favourable tectonic context associated with the compression of the magma chamber and the presence of faults helped with the eruption of the magnetite. The magma formation probably occurred in a magma chamber. During the cooling of the magma, the ores formed. This process was probably not directed by water-rich phases, and the segregation occurred at a shallow depth. High phosphorus and <b>volatile</b> <b>content</b> may have lowered the melting point of the magma and facilitated its eruption, as well as overcoming density-based constraints on the eruption of iron-rich magmas. Suggestions that anatexis of iron-rich sediments generated the iron-rich magmas appear implausible. The ultimate origin of the El Laco iron may be subducted metal-containing sediment.|$|E
2500|$|Though the {{meteorite}} impact theory of tektite formation is widely accepted, {{there has been}} considerable controversy about their origin in the past. In contrast to a terrestrial impact source for tektites, it was argued that tektites consist of material that was ejected from the Moon by major hydrogen-driven lunar volcanic eruptions and then drifted through space to later fall to Earth as tektites. The major proponents of the lunar origin of tektites include NASA scientist John A. O'Keefe, NASA aerodynamicist Dean R. Chapman, meteorite and tektite collector Darryl Futrell, and long-time tektite researcher Hal Povenmire. From the 1950s to the 1990s, O'Keefe argued for the lunar origin of tektites based upon their chemical, i.e. rare-earth, isotopic, and bulk, composition and physical properties. Chapman used complex orbital computer models and extensive wind tunnel tests {{to argue that the}} so-called Australasian tektites originated from the Rosse ejecta ray of the large crater Tycho on the Moon's nearside. O'Keefe, Povenmire, and Futrell claimed on the basis of behavior of glass melts that the homogenization, which is called [...] "fining", of silica melts that characterize tektites could not be explained by the terrestrial-impact theory. They also argued that the terrestrial-impact theory could not explain the vesicules and extremely low water and other <b>volatile</b> <b>content</b> of tektites. Futrell also reported the presence of microscopic internal features within tektites, which argued for a volcanic origin.|$|E

30|$|The <b>volatile</b> matter <b>content</b> of coal {{depends on}} its rank. Volatile matter is known to {{decrease}} {{with an increase in}} rank, and {{it is one of the}} most important parameters that determine the suitable application of a coal. In metallurgical coke making, volatile matter does not form part of the coke; it usually evolves as tar during carbonization. High-volatile bituminous coal, due to its high <b>volatile</b> matter <b>content,</b> generates high pressure during carbonization which can damage the coke oven walls[13]. Medium-volatile coals (<b>volatile</b> <b>contents</b> in the range of 27.70 % to 30.30 %) are known to produce good coke[15]. These suggest that only the Shankodi-Jangwa coal sample, with a <b>volatile</b> matter <b>content</b> of 29.69 % (Table[*] 1), falls within the acceptable range for metallurgical coke making.|$|R
50|$|All carbon {{blacks have}} chemisorbed oxygen {{complexes}} (i.e., carboxylic, quinonic, lactonic, phenolic groups and others) on their surfaces {{to varying degrees}} depending on the conditions of manufacture. These surface oxygen groups are collectively referred to as <b>volatile</b> <b>content.</b> It is also {{known to be a}} non-conductive material due to its <b>volatile</b> <b>content.</b>|$|E
50|$|Volatility is also {{critical}} for steel-making and power generation, as this determines the burn {{rate of the}} coal. High <b>volatile</b> <b>content</b> coals, while easy to ignite often are not as prized as moderately volatile coals; low volatile coal {{may be difficult to}} ignite although it contains more energy per unit volume. The smelter must balance the <b>volatile</b> <b>content</b> of the coals to optimize the ease of ignition, burn rate, and energy output of the coal.|$|E

Following this approach, this study succeeded in furthering our understanding of (i) the spatial and temporal distribution of near-surface water ice, as defined by the distribution and sizes of rootless volcanic cones ("pseudocraters"), and (ii) the properties, eruption conditions, and <b>volatile</b> <b>contents</b> of magmas producing primary vent cones...|$|R

40|$|The Cascades arc is a warm-slab {{subduction}} zone {{characterized by the}} slow (3. 5 cm/a) subduction of young (< 10 Ma) oceanic crust. Elevated slab temperatures likely result in shallow dehydration beneath the forearc and reduced slab fluid addition to the mantle wedge beneath the volcanic front.

We test this hypothesis in Central Oregon, {{the region of the}} arc that has experienced the highest mafic output over the last 2 Ma. Naturally quenched basalt and basaltic andesite melt inclusions from tephra erupted from monogenetic vents record pre-eruptive magmatic <b>volatile</b> <b>contents.</b> After accounting for the effects of degassing, our data show that initial <b>volatile</b> <b>contents</b> from seven calc-alkaline cinder cones range from 1. 7 to 3. 6 wt. ...|$|R

A protective agent, dimethyl polysiloxane (DMPS), was also tested in crisp frying. Peroxide values and <b>volatile</b> <b>contents</b> of the crisps stored in normal storage conditions (room temperature) were measured during storage. From the peroxide values it could be seen that crisps fried in normal sunflower oil were the most unstable during storage. Crisps fried in high oleic sunflower oil proved to be almost as stable towards oxidation as crisps fried in reference oil palm olein. <b>Volatile</b> <b>contents,</b> measured by a static headspace - gas chromatograph - mass spectrometry system, confirmed the conclusions of peroxide analysis.

5000|$|There is much {{variation}} {{in the style of}} submarine eruptions. [...] This changes with a number of variables including magma viscosity, water depth, effusion rate and <b>volatile</b> <b>content.</b> Many studies highlight the effects of pressure which increases with depth. It is believed that increased pressure restricts the release of volatile gases, resulting in effusive eruptions. This {{is not to say that}} explosive eruptions don’t occur at depth, just that a higher <b>volatile</b> <b>content</b> is required. It has been estimated that at 500 m explosive activity associated with basalts is suppressed, while depths greater than 2300 m would be sufficient to prevent the majority of explosive activity from rhyolite lava.|$|E

25|$|The {{difference}} in water content {{can be used}} to distinguish tektites from terrestrial volcanic glasses. When heated to their melting point, terrestrial volcanic glasses will turn into a foamy glass because of their content of water and other volatiles. Unlike terrestrial volcanic glass, a tektite will produce only a few bubbles at most when heated to its melting point, because of its much lower water and other <b>volatiles</b> <b>content.</b>|$|R
30|$|Regarding the {{explosive}} eruption, pyroclasts with high vesicle contents (Fig. 1 d) usually {{show that the}} magma containing abundant volatiles undergoes strong exsolution, and {{the energy of the}} volcanic eruption {{is the result of the}} large gas expansion. Similarly, pyroclasts (e.g., lapilli) with few vesicles (Fig. 1 b) indicate low <b>volatiles</b> <b>content,</b> which means the energy for explosive eruption may be derived from the vaporization of hot magma interacted with the surface water except from exsolution of <b>volatiles</b> <b>content</b> (De Rita et al. 2002). Therefore, the vesicle contents of pyroclasts (lapilli) can be used to identify hydrovolcanism if it is confirmed as {{the explosive}} eruption. A lack of vesicles in pyroclasts indicates that part of the energy is derived from the rapid vaporization of hot water when the magma interacts with the surface water during the hydrovolcanism. Previous studies have demonstrated that, at sea floor less than 3  km deep, the vapor generated by the interaction between magma or hot particles and water may cause intense expansion, even explosion (White et al. 2003).|$|R
40|$|Stromboli volcano {{is famous}} in the {{scientific}} literature for its persistent state of activity, which began about 1500 years ago and consists of continuous degassing and mild intermittent explosions (normal Strombolian activity). Rare lava emissions and sporadic more violent explosive episodes (paroxysms) also occur. Since its formation, the present-day activity {{has been dominated by}} the emission of two basaltic magmas, differing chiefly in their crystal and <b>volatile</b> <b>contents,</b> whose characteristics have remained constant until now. The normal Strombolian activity and lava effusions are fed by a crystal-rich, degassed magma, stored within the uppermost part of the plumbing system, whereas highly vesicular, crystal-poor light-colored pumices are produced during paroxysms testifying to the ascent of volatile-rich magma batches from deeper portions of the magmatic system. Mineralogical, geochemical, and isotopic data, together with data on the <b>volatile</b> <b>contents</b> of magmas, are presented here with the aim of discussing (1) the relationships between the different magma batches erupted at Stromboli, (2) the mechanisms of their crystallization and transfer, (3) the plumbing system and triggering mechanisms of Strombolian eruptions...|$|R
