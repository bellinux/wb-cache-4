50|$|In economics, fixed costs, {{indirect}} costs or overheads are business expenses {{that are not}} dependent {{on the level of}} goods or services produced by the business. They tend to be time-related, such as salaries or rents being paid per month, and are often referred to as overhead costs. This is in contrast to variable costs, which are <b>volume-related</b> (and are paid per quantity produced). For a simple example, such as a bakery, the monthly rent for the baking facilities, and the monthly payments for the security system and basic phone line are fixed costs, as they do not change according to how much bread the bakery produces and sells. On the other hands, the wage costs of the bakery are variable, as the bakery will have to hire more workers if the production of bread increases. The relation between fixed cost and variable cost can be modelled by an analytical formula.|$|E

In this in vitro biomechanical study, 48 goat cervical spines (C 2 - 5) were tested in flexion, extension, axial rotation, and lateral bending with a nondestructive stiffness method using a nonconstrained testing apparatus, and three-dimensional displacement was measured. Autologous iliac bone and cervical spine intervertebral fusion cage were implanted according to manufacturers’ information after complete discectomy (C 3 - 4).

ABSTRACT: The majority or male patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) have an abnormal pharyngeal structure and function, with epl· sodlc complete airway occlusion during sleep. Since OSA Is less common In females than In males, lt Is possible that other abnormalities are active In female patients with OSA. Consequently, we measured pharyn-geal area and its lung <b>volume-related</b> changes (LVRC) from functional residual capacity (FRC) to residual volume (RV) in overweight females, 14 with OSA and 14 without OSA. Pharyngeal areas were measured using the acoustic renection technique.

The approach presented in this paper is based on mechanical equilibrium of whole muscle. A <b>volume-related</b> force is introduced to keep muscle volume constant.

40|$|The {{conversion}} of gaseous molecular iodine into iodine oxide aerosols has significant relevance {{in the understanding}} of the fission product iodine volatility in a LWR containment during severe accidents. In containment, the high radiation field caused by fission products released from the reactor core induces radiolytic oxidation into iodine oxides. To study the characteristics and the behaviour of iodine oxides in large scale, two THAI tests Iod- 13 and Iod- 14 were performed, simulating radiolytic oxidation of molecular iodine by reaction of iodine with ozone, with ozone injected from an ozone generator. The observed iodine oxides form submicron particles with mean <b>volume-related</b> diameters of about 0. 35 mu m and show low deposition rates in the THAI tests performed in the absence of other nuclear aerosols. Formation of iodine aerosols from gaseous precursors iodine and ozone is fast as compared to their chemical interaction. The current approach in empirical iodine containment behaviour models in severe accidents, including the radiolytic production of I- 2 -oxidizing agents followed by the I- 2 oxidation itself, is confirmed by these THAI tests.

40|$|ObjectivesTo {{assess the}} outcome of carotid endarterectomy in England {{with respect to the}} {{hospital}} case-volume. MethodsData were from English Hospital Episode Statistics (2000 – 2005). Admissions were classified as elective or emergency. Risk-adjusted data were analysed through modelling of death rate, complication rate and length of admission with regard to the year of procedure and annual hospital volume of surgery. Hospitals with elevated death rates were identified and the evidence quantified that they had outlying mortality rates. ResultsThere were 280   081 diagnoses of extra-cranial atherosclerotic arterial disease in which 18   248 CEA were performed. The mean mortality rates were 1. 04 % for elective and 3. 16 % for emergency CEA. A <b>volume-related</b> improvement in mortality (p= 0. 047) was seen for elective CEA. Length of stay decreased as annual volume increased for elective and emergency CEA (p< 0. 001). 20 % of the operations were performed in 67. 1 % of the hospitals, each of which performed fewer than 10 CEA per annum. A number of hospitals had elevated death rates. ConclusionsVolume-related improvements in outcome were demonstrated for elective CEA. Minimum volume-criteria of 35 CEA per annum should be established in England. Hospitals performing low annual volumes of surgery should consider arrangements to network services...|$|E
