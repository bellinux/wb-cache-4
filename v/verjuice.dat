5|$|A type of refined cooking {{developed}} in the late Middle Ages that set the standard among the nobility all over Europe. Common seasonings in the highly spiced sweet-sour repertory typical of upper-class medieval food included <b>verjuice,</b> wine and vinegar in combination with spices such as black pepper, saffron and ginger. These, along with {{the widespread use of}} sugar or honey, gave many dishes a sweet-sour flavour. Almonds were very popular as a thickener in soups, stews, and sauces, particularly as almond milk.|$|E
5|$|Food {{preservation}} methods were {{basically the same}} as had been used since antiquity, and did not change much until the invention of canning in the early 19th century. The most common and simplest method was to expose foodstuffs to heat or wind to remove moisture, thereby prolonging the durability if not the flavor of almost any type of food from cereals to meats; the drying of food worked by drastically reducing the activity of various water-dependent microorganisms that cause decay. In warm climates this was mostly achieved by leaving food out in the sun, and in the cooler northern climates by exposure to strong winds (especially common for the preparation of stockfish), or in warm ovens, cellars, attics, and at times even in living quarters. Subjecting food {{to a number of}} chemical processes such as smoking, salting, brining, conserving or fermenting also made it keep longer. Most of these methods had the advantage of shorter preparation times and of introducing new flavors. Smoking or salting meat of livestock butchered in autumn was a common household strategy to avoid having to feed more animals than necessary during the lean winter months. Butter tended to be heavily salted (5–10%) in order not to spoil. Vegetables, eggs or fish were also often pickled in tightly packed jars, containing brine and acidic liquids (lemon juice, <b>verjuice</b> or vinegar). Another method was to seal the food by cooking it in sugar or honey or fat, in which it was then stored. Microbial modification was also encouraged, however, by a number of methods; grains, fruit and grapes were turned into alcoholic drinks thus killing any pathogens, and milk was fermented and curdled into a multitude of cheeses or buttermilk.|$|E
25|$|White wine is {{regularly}} {{used as an}} ingredient. Its acidity balances well with fat taking away excess heaviness. This acidity also refines the meat or fish and it helps {{to break down the}} fibres of the meat to make it tender. The role of white wine {{is similar to that of}} lemon juice used under the same conditions: once <b>verjuice</b> also fulfilled this function. The vinegar combines acidity with a burning sensation that gives recipes where it is used a bittersweet side characteristic.|$|E
40|$|The need to {{preserve}} and extend the availability of perishable and seasonal fleshy fruits and obtain derivatives for direct consumption and seasoning has generated in the world {{a wide range of}} traditional products characterized by peculiar sensory quality and expected functions and based on different raw material and home processing systems. A comparison of present situation of traditional fruit derivatives of the Black sea area and Italy, as reference Country of the Mediterranean Basin, {{has been the subject of}} an investigation aimed at finding common points and differences in way of processing and uses. The survey has focused on Georgia, Ukraine and Bulgaria in the Black sea area, and on the regions of Emilia Romagna, Marche, Trentino Alto Adige in Italy. Growers, processors and local experts have been interviewed. Consultation of historical and recent documentation on ingredients and processing have been carried out; Information on paste and present uses and recipes has been collected [...] Within each category of product (for direct consumption or seasoning; liquid or solid; sweet or sour) similar processing systems and raw material are used in the Black sea Countries and in Italy. In both areas the traditional ways of fruit preservation are: - the reduction of water content (dried fruits, concentrated juices, concentrated juices and pulps, dried pulps; - addition of sugar or salt; - fermentation (alcoholic or other). Correspondences between the two areas for products, ingredients and systems may be individuated: pekmez and saba are concentrated juices obtained after long cooking of fruits and grapes (Black sea area) and grapes (Italy); pelamushi are made with flour mixed to cooked juice of grape or other fruits) similarly to ‘sughi’ (grape must cooked with flour), lekvar and savor or savurett are produced boiling for hours fruit juice with fruit slices, isrimi (Georgia) and agresto (Italy) are <b>verjuices</b> obtained from unripe grapes and are generally used as a substitutes of vinegar, Factors of differentiation among products are area of production, species used and needs of the local communities. The varying local availability of raw material as a function of territory and year has led to recipes often characterized by ingredients and dosages not strictly fixed, but adapted to the current situation. In Bulgaria, Georgia, Ukraine these traditions are well preserved and widely diffused. In Italy saba and sughi are produced not only at home ihave been almost lost or only recently resumed (agresto), other are. 1) Dried fruits are still The present richness of traditional products in the different areas from the Black sea regions to the Mediterranean Basin is variable, mostly as a consequence of life style and economic conditions which have allowed different levels of preservation of these traditions or pushed to their abandonment and to innovation...|$|R

25|$|Dishes {{that were}} {{intended}} to be eaten as well as entertain {{can be traced back}} at least to the early Roman Empire. In his Satyricon, the Roman writer Petronius describes a dish consisting of a rabbit dressed to look like the mythical horse Pegasus. The function of the entremet was to mark the end of a course, met (a serving of several dishes), of which there could be several at a banquet. It punctuated each stage of a banquet, prepared the diners for the next serving and functioned as a conversation piece. The earliest recipe for an entremet can be found in an edition of Le Viandier, a medieval recipe collection from the early 14th century. It described a comparatively simple dish: boiled and fried chicken liver with chopped giblet, ground ginger, cinnamon, cloves, wine, <b>verjuice,</b> beef bouillon and egg yolks, served with cinnamon on top, and was supposed to be of a bright yellow color. An even simpler dish, like millet boiled in milk and seasoned with saffron, was also considered to be an entremet.|$|E
500|$|Surviving medieval recipes {{frequently}} {{call for}} flavoring {{with a number}} of sour, tart liquids. Wine, <b>verjuice</b> (the juice of unripe grapes or fruits) vinegar and the juices of various fruits, especially those with tart flavors, were almost universal and a hallmark of late medieval cooking. In combination with sweeteners and spices, it produced a distinctive [...] "pungeant, fruity" [...] flavor. Equally common, and used to complement the tanginess of these ingredients, were (sweet) almonds. They were used in a variety of ways: whole, shelled or unshelled, slivered, ground and, most importantly, processed into almond milk. This last type of non-dairy milk product is probably the single most common ingredient in late medieval cooking and blended the aroma of spices and sour liquids with a mild taste and creamy texture.|$|E
2500|$|Sheridan later deleted <b>Verjuice</b> {{and gave}} Snake {{most of her}} lines, as {{reflected}} in the 1821 edition and those editions that follow it. Here is the opening in that text: ...|$|E
2500|$|This is a {{significant}} difference, and some editors and performers have preferred the manuscript version that includes Miss <b>Verjuice.</b> However, the cast list of the first production of the play in 1777 has no [...] "Miss Verjuice" [...] listed, showing that the change Sheridan made to combine her part with Snake's predates the premiere.|$|E
2500|$|In the Project Gutenburg text's {{version of}} I.1, Lady Sneerwell's {{accomplice}} is her cousin Miss <b>Verjuice,</b> not the socially inferior Snake (who appears only in V.3). Here is {{the opening of}} the play as given in that text (in which the editor has retained the original spelling and punctuation of Sheridan's manuscript found at Frampton Court): ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{example of}} {{strictly}} verbal {{differences between the}} two texts can be found in II.1, where the Project Gutenburg text has Lady Teazle rather more pointed in suggesting that Sir Peter can oblige her by making her his [...] "widow" [...] (only implied by her in the 1821 text, leaving him to fill in [...] "My widow, I suppose?" [...] and her to add [...] "Hem! hem!"). Also, interestingly, in Crabtree's recitation of the imaginary duel between Sir Peter and Charles Surface (V.2), the shot of Sir Peter bounces off a [...] "little bronze Pliny" [...] in the older version, but the bust is changed to one of [...] "Shakspeare (sic)" [...] in the 1821 text. Many other slight differences of a few words here and there can be found throughout the play (though these do not impact the plot the way that the deletion of Miss <b>Verjuice</b> does).|$|E
2500|$|The Iberian Peninsula has {{a highly}} varied {{geography}} {{with a central}} Meseta, a vast, flat plateau, surrounded on all sides by mountain ranges and {{cut off from the}} rest of Europe by the Pyrenees. This meant that several distinct cultures co-existed on the peninsula with several unique cuisines. Since Ancient times it had been a colony of several Mediterranean cultures. The Phoenicians introduced the cultivation of olives and the Greeks brought the Malvasia grape, founding a wine industry that would become renowned in the Middle Ages. But it was the Roman Empire, of which the peninsula was the westernmost outpost, that had the biggest impact on Iberian cuisine. After the collapse of Roman rule, Visigothic invaders conquered most of the modern day Spain and Portugal in the 5th century. The Visigoths took on many Roman customs, like the focus on vegetables, and used Latin for official purposes. But it was the invasions of North African Muslims and the establishment of Al-Andalus that gave Iberian cuisine its unique nature. The Muslims brought with them the highly refined cuisine influenced by Arab courts in the Middle East. The center of this Arab civilization was Baghdad, at the time one of the largest cities in the world. The new rulers introduced many new customs and foodstuffs; goblets made of glass rather than metal, savory meat dishes cooked with fruit, spices and herbs like cinnamon, mastic, caraway, sesame and mint and the use of ground almonds or rice as thickeners and a fondness for adding tangy liquids like <b>verjuice,</b> tamarind and the juice of bitter oranges to produce a distinctly sweet-sour taste. The impact can clearly be seen in the multitude of Arab loanwords in Spanish; naranja [...] "orange", azúcar ("sugar"), alcachofa ("artichoke"), azafrán ("saffron") and espinaca ("spinach"), many of which eventually spread to other languages in Europe. The Spanish Muslims established the sequences of dishes which was to permeate the entire continent and which is still forms the basis for many modern European meals; soup followed by meat dishes and finished off with sweets. It also believed that escabeche, a vinegar-based dish, could very well be of Arab-Persian origin, though this has been contested.|$|E

60|$|<b>VERJUICE.</b> Yes yes--I know Sir Peter vows He has not his {{equal in}} England; and, above all, He praises {{him as a}} MAN OF SENTIMENT.|$|E
60|$|<b>VERJUICE.</b> Madam by this Time Lady Brittle is the Talk of {{half the}} Town--and I doubt not in a week the Men will toast her as a Demirep.|$|E
