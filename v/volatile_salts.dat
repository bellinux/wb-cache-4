(Narwhale), that is, Nostril whale.-- Another {{instance}} of a curiously named whale, so named I suppose from his peculiar horn being originally {{mistaken for a}} peaked nose. The creature is some sixteen feet in length, while its horn averages five feet, though some exceed ten, and even attain to fifteen feet. Strictly speaking, this horn is but a lengthened tusk, growing out from the jaw in a line a little depressed from the horizontal. But it is only found on the sinister side, which has an ill effect, giving its owner something analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left-handed man. What precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers, {{it would be hard}} to say. It does not seem to be used like the blade of the sword-fish and bill-fish; though some sailors tell me that the Narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food. Charley Coffin said it was used for an ice-piercer; for the Narwhale, rising to the surface of the Polar Sea, and finding it sheeted with ice, thrusts his horn up, and so breaks through. But you cannot prove either of these surmises to be correct. My own opinion is, that however this one-sided horn may really be used by the Narwhale--however that may be--it would certainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets. The Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked whale, the Horned whale, and the Unicorn whale. He is certainly a curious example of the Unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature.

This sampling system can separate <b>volatile</b> ammonium <b>salts</b> (NH 4 NO 3 and NH 4 Cl) from non-volatile ammonium salts ((NH 4) (2) SO 4), {{as well as the}} non-volatile nitrate and chloride. The measurement data was used as input of a thermodynamic equilibrium model (ISORROPIA II) to investigate the gas aerosol equilibrium characteristics. Results show that (NH 4) (2) SO 4, NH 4 NO 3 and NH 4 Cl were the major inorganic salts in aerosols and mainly existed in the fine particles. The sulfate, nitrate and chloride associated with crustal ions were also important in Beijing where mineral dust concentrations were high. About 19 % of sulfate in winter and 11 % of sulfate in summer were associated with crustal ions and originated from heterogeneous reactions or direct emissions. The nonvolatile nitrate contributed about 33 % and 15 % of nitrate in winter and summer, respectively. Theoretical thermodynamic equilibrium calculations for NH 4 NO 3 and NH 4 Cl suggest that the gaseous precursors were sufficient to form stable <b>volatile</b> ammonium <b>salts</b> in winter, whereas the internal mixing with sulfate and crustal species were important for the formation of <b>volatile</b> ammonium <b>salts</b> in summer. The results of the thermodynamic equilibrium model reasonably agreed with the measurements of aerosols and gases, but large discrepancy existed in predicting the speciation of inorganic ammonium salts. This indicates that the assumption on crustal species in the model was important for obtaining better understanding on gas aerosol partitioning and improving the model prediction.

40|$|The {{corrosion}} and fouling of heat-transfer {{surfaces and}} the agglomeration of bed materials in fluidized beds {{are some of}} the ash-related problems caused by the transformation and release to the gas phase of ash-forming elements from biomass during thermochemical conversion processes. The magnitudes of these problems are largely dependent upon the release of potassium (K), chlorine (Cl), and sulfur (S) from the biomass. We investigated the effects of steam on the release of K, Cl, and S during char conversion, under conditions relevant for dual-fluidized-bed gasification (DFBG). The study was carried out with wheat straw in a laboratory-scale bubbling fluidized-bed reactor in the temperature range of 800 - 900 degrees C. The release of K, Cl, and S from wheat straw during devolatilization, char gasification, and char combustion was quantified with a mass balance that linked the masses of these elements in the wheat straw to the mass of the solid residue obtained {{at the end of each}} experiment. To facilitate analyses of the experimental results, leaching and the BrunauerEmmettTeller surface area measurement of the wheat straw and some of the solid residues were carried out. The results show that, during devolatilization, the release of <b>volatile</b> <b>salts,</b> e. g., KCl, is significantly limited by intraparticle diffusion resistance, owing to a compact char matrix (i. e., negligible porosity). However, during char gasification, steam renders the char less compact by expanding and/or creating new pores in the char. As a result, intraparticle diffusion resistance decreases, thereby facilitating the evaporation of <b>volatile</b> <b>salts</b> of K and S from the char matrix. The conversion of the char is also conducive to the release of char-bound K and S, especially at 900 degrees C. At temperatures of > 800 degrees C, the relative proportions of the elements released and char gasified indicate that the release of K can somewhat be decoupled from the release of S and Cl by maximizing the extent of char conversion in the gasification chamber. The results also show that, during char combustion, the proportions of the char that can be combusted and the extent of the release of the elements are influenced by the extent to which the char is gasified in the gasification chamber...|$|E

To meet the requirements of peptides with different physical and chemical properties an iterative extraction with basic or acidic solutions is performed.

40|$|The {{transformation}} and release of ash-forming elements during thermal conversion of biomass are conducive to ash-related problems, for example, agglomeration of bed material in fluidized beds. The occurrence {{and severity of}} these problems largely depend {{on the extent to}} which K, Cl, and S are released from biomass during thermal conversion processes. Therefore, in order to predict and effectively mitigate these problems, knowledge of the mechanisms and the quantity of the primary release of each of these elements from the fuel under relevant operational conditions is required. In the present work, the release of K, Cl and S from biomass under conditions relevant to dual fluidized bed gasification was investigated. Emphasis was placed on the effect of steam as a fluidization medium and oxidant during char conversion. The study was carried out in a laboratoryscale bubbling fluidized bed reactor in the temperature range 550 – 900 °C. To avoid concentrations of K, Cl, and S in the fuel closer or lower than the detection limits of instruments used for chemical analysis, wheat straw which typically has a higher concentration of these elements than many other biomass fuels was selected. The release of K, Cl, and S from the wheat straw during devolatilization, char gasification, and char combustion was quantified with a mass balance linking the mass of each element in the wheat straw to that in the solid residue obtained at the end of each experiment. To gain further insight into the release mechanisms, leaching and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area measurement of the wheat straw and some of the solid residues as well as chemical thermodynamic equilibrium modeling were carried out. The results from all the analyses indicate that, at temperatures > 700 °C, the evaporation of KCl and other <b>volatile</b> <b>salts</b> of K during devolatilization are significantly limited by pore diffusion owing to a compact char matrix. However during char gasification, the conversion of the char with steam renders the char less compact by widening and/or creating new pores in the char. Consequently, the resistance to the diffusion of <b>volatile</b> <b>salts</b> out of the char matrix decreases thereby facilitating their release. The conversion of the char is also conducive to the release of char bound-K and S, especially at 900 °C. Based on the release of each of the elements per char gasified, it was inferred that, at temperatures > 800 °C, the release of K can to some extent be decoupled from the release of S and Cl by maximizing the extent of char conversion in the gasification chamber. The extent to which the char is gasified was also found to affect the extent to which the elements are released during char combustion. On the basis of all the results obtained and literature on the {{transformation and}} release of ash-forming elements during thermal conversion processes, it can be asserted that, at operational temperatures > 800 °C, the release of K, Cl, and S from biomass in both chambers of a dual fluidized bed gasifier can be controlled to some extent by controlling the extent of char conversion in the gasification chamber...|$|E

RESULTS: Activity assays showed that alpha-amylase (1, 4 -alpha-D-glucan glucanohydrolase, EC 3. 2. 1. 1), lysozyme (1, 4 -beta-N-acetylmuramoylhydrolase, EC 3. 2. 1. 17) and lipase (triacyl glycerol acyl hydrolase, EC 3. 1. 1. 3) did not undergo activity loss in ammonium carbamate solutions with concentrations from 1. 0 to 5. 0 mol kg(- 1), whereas cellulase complex (1, 4 -(1, 3 : 14) -beta-D-glucan 4 -glucano-hydrolase, EC 3. 2. 1. 4) and peroxidase (hydrogen peroxide oxidoreductase, EC 1. 11. 1. 7) showed an average activity loss of 55 % and 44 %, respectively. Precipitation assays did not show enzyme denaturation or phase separation for alpha-amylase and lipase, while celullase and peroxidase precipitated with some activity reduction. Analysis of similar experiments with ammonium and sodium sulfate did not affect the activity of enzymes. CONCLUSION: Celullase and peroxidase were denatured by ammonium carbamate. While more systematic studies are not available, care must be taken in designing a protein precipitation with this salt. The results suggest that the generally accepted idea that salts that denature proteins tend to solubilize them does not hold for ammonium carbamate. (C) 2010 Society of Chemical Industr...|$|E
40|$|Vacuum {{distillation}} of chloride salts from {{plutonium oxide}} (PuO{sub 2 }) and simulant PuO{sub 2 } {{has been previously}} demonstrated at Department of Energy (DOE) sites using kilogram quantities of chloride salt. The apparatus for vacuum distillation contains a zone heated using a furnace and a zone actively cooled using either recirculated water or compressed air. During a vacuum distillation operation, a sample boat containing the feed material is placed into the apparatus while it is cool, and the system is sealed. The system is evacuated using a vacuum pump. Once a sufficient vacuum is attained, heating begins. <b>Volatile</b> <b>salts</b> distill from the heated zone to the cooled zone where they condense, leaving behind the non-volatile materials in the feed boat. The application of vacuum salt distillation (VSD) is {{of interest to the}} HB-Line Facility and the MOX Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) at the Savannah River Site (SRS). Both facilities are involved in efforts to disposition excess fissile materials. Many of these materials contain chloride and fluoride salt concentrations which make them unsuitable for dissolution without prior removal of the chloride and fluoride salts. Between September 2009 and January 2011, the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) and HB-Line designed, developed, tested, and successfully deployed a system for the distillation of chloride salts. Subsequent efforts are attempting to adapt the technology for the removal of fluoride. Fluoride salts of interest are less-volatile than the corresponding chloride salts. Consequently, an alternate approach is required for the removal of fluoride without significantly increasing the operating temperature. HB-Line Engineering requested SRNL to evaluate and demonstrate the feasibility of an alternate approach using both non-radioactive simulants and plutonium-bearing materials. Whereas the earlier developments targeted the removal of sodium chloride (NaCl) and potassium chloride (KCl), the current activities are concerned with the removal of the halide ions associated with plutonium trifluoride (PuF{sub 3 }), plutonium tetrafluoride (PuF{sub 4 }), calcium fluoride (CaF{sub 2 }), and calcium chloride (CaCl{sub 2 }). This report discusses non-radioactive testing of small-scale and pilot-scale systems and radioactive testing of a small-scale system. Experiments focused on demonstrating the chemistry for halide removal and addressing the primary engineering questions associated with a change in the process chemistry...|$|E
40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) is {{currently}} evaluating an alternative Chemical Process Cell (CPC) flowsheet to increase throughput. It includes {{removal of the}} steam-stripping step, which would significantly reduce the CPC processing time and lessen the sampling needs. However, its downside would be to send 100 % of the mercury that come in with the sludge straight to the melter. For example, the new mercury content in the Sludge Batch 5 (SB 5) melter feed is projected to be 25 times higher than that in the SB 4 with nominal steam stripping of mercury. This task was initiated to study {{the impact of the}} worst-case scenario of zero-mercury-removal in the CPC on the DWPF melter off-gas system. It is stressed that this study is intended to be scoping in nature, so the results presented in this report are preliminary. In order to study the impact of elevated mercury levels in the feed, it is necessary to be able to predict how mercury would speciate in the melter exhaust under varying melter operating conditions. A homogeneous gas-phase oxidation model of mercury by chloride was developed to do just that. The model contains two critical parameters pertaining to the partitioning of chloride among HCl, Cl, Cl{sub 2 }, and chloride salts in the melter vapor space. The values for these parameters were determined at two different melter vapor space temperatures by matching the calculated molar ratio of HgCl (or Hg{sub 2 }Cl{sub 2 }) to HgCl{sub 2 } with those measured during the Experimental-Scale Ceramic Melter (ESCM) tests run at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). The calibrated model was then applied to the SB 5 simulant used in the earlier flowsheet study with an assumed mercury stripping efficiency of zero; the molar ratio of Cl-to-Hg in the resulting melter feed was only 0. 4, compared to 12 for the ESCM feeds. The results of the model run at the indicated melter vapor space temperature of 650 C (TI 4085 D) showed that due to excessive shortage of chloride, only 6 % of the mercury fed is expected to get oxidized, mostly as HgCl, while the remaining mercury would exist either as elemental mercury vapor (90 %) or HgO (4 %). Noting that the measured chloride level in the SB 5 qualification sample was an order of magnitude lower than that used in the SB 5 simulant, the degree of chloride shortage will be even greater. As a result, the projected level of HgCl in the actual SB 5 melter exhaust will be even lower than 6 % of the total mercury fed, while that of elemental mercury is likely to be greater than 90 %. The homogeneous oxidation of mercury in the off-gas was deemed to be of primary importance based on the postulation that mercury and other <b>volatile</b> <b>salts</b> form submicron sized aerosols upon condensation and thus remain largely in the gas stream downstream of the quencher where they can deposit in the off-gas lines, Steam-Atomized Scrubbers (SAS), and High-Efficiency Mist Eliminator (HEME). Formation of these submicron semi-volatile salts in the condensate liquid is considered to be unlikely, so the liquid phase reactions were considered to be less important. However, subsequent oxidation of mercury in the liquid phase in the off-gas system was examined in a simplified model of the off-gas condensate. It was found that the condensate chemistry was consistent with further oxidation of elemental mercury to Hg{sub 2 }Cl{sub 2 } and conversion of HgO to chlorides. The results were consistent with the available experimental data. It {{should also be noted that}} the model predictions presented in this report do not include any physically entrained solids, which typically account for much of the off-gas carryover on a mass basis. The high elemental mercury vapor content predicted at the DWPF Quencher inlet means that physically entrained solids could provide the necessary surface onto which elemental mercury vapor could condense, thereby coating the solids as well as the internal surfaces of the off-gas system with mercury. Clearly, there are many process benefits to be gained by removing the steam-stripping step from the CPC cycle. The goal of this task was to study what adverse impact the zero-mercury-removal scenario would have on the DWPF melter off-gas system operation. It is stressed again that this study was intended to be scoping in nature, so the results presented in this report are preliminary. Any further substantiation of these results for actual implementation into the DWPF flowsheet would require an in-depth modeling study of all three reaction zones, including the aqueous-phase reactions in the quencher, OGCT, Steam Atomized Scrubber (SAS), and off-gas condenser with recirculated condensate, and the proof-of-principle experiments...|$|E
5|$|Because of its extreme {{reactivity}} {{with oxygen}} and water, strontium occurs naturally only in compounds with other elements, {{such as in}} the minerals strontianite and celestine. It is kept under a liquid hydrocarbon such as mineral oil or kerosene to prevent oxidation; freshly exposed strontium metal rapidly turns a yellowish color with the formation of the oxide. Finely powdered strontium metal is pyrophoric, meaning that it will ignite spontaneously in air at room temperature. <b>Volatile</b> strontium <b>salts</b> impart a bright red color to flames, and these salts are used in pyrotechnics and in the production of flares. Like calcium and barium, as well as the alkali metals and the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium, strontium metal dissolves directly in liquid ammonia to give a dark blue solution.|$|R

Production of volatile bases was generally highest in brining and lowest in mixed salting. The rate of TVB production increased with temperature and length of storage. The TVB produced during salt preservation consisted mainly of ammonia and, to a lesser extent, trimethylamine, dimethy-lamine and other unidentified components. More trimethylamine was produced in herring than in Sardinella eba during salt preservation...|$|R
40|$|Background : The {{interest}} in microalgae as source of biofuels has significantly increased in recent years, {{because of their}} higher photosynthetic efficiency and faster growing rates than terrestrial biomass. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), also called subcritical water extraction, is a promising technology that converts wet microalgae into an organic liquid energy carrier, usually called bio-crude oil. Much focus is currently set on lipid-rich strains, as they are believed to produce more biocrude oil via HTL. However, these strains are usually slow growing organisms, thus reducing the overall productivity of the process. Aim : This work aims to study the suitability of several microalgae species as feedstock for biofuel via HTL under practical conditions for industrial operation. The species were cultivated, harvested and converted to biofuels in a single chain. Strains with high biomass productivity (non-lipid-rich) were selected. Methods : The selected strains had great differences in strain-specific parameters (i. e. biochemical composition, cell structure or growth environment), and they all presented a robust growth and a high biomass productivity. They were characterized in terms of biochemical and elemental composition. Special focus was paid on the accurate characterization of the feedstock {{and the fate of}} salts from the culture medium during the HTL process. Two temperatures were tested (250 and 375 ºC) with a reaction time of 5 min, in autoclaves of 43 mL. Results : A sound characterization of the organic content of the HTL feedstock is critical for a correct mass balance closure. The presence of <b>volatile</b> inorganic <b>salts</b> from the culture medium can significantly affect the mass balances. At 250 ºC, these salts are mixed with the biocrude oil and aqueous phases obtained after HTL, while these phases appear to be entirely organic when 375 ºC are used. This is related to the change in the polarity of water at subcritical conditions. Regarding the production of biofuels, the type of strain appeared to affect HTL at 250 ºC, especially the cell wall, leading to noteworthy differences in the biocrude oil yields. These differences appear to be scarcer at 375 ºC. Harsher conditions seem to make the process less sensitive to strain-specific parameters. Summary/conclusions : This works shows that the <b>volatile</b> inorganic <b>salts</b> accumulated in the algae pastes after harvesting significantly affect the HTL process. These salts are mixed with the biocrude oil and aqueous phases obtained from HTL at 250 ºC, while at 375 ºC they crystallize and precipitate, separating from the biocrude oil. A correct management of these salts (directly linked with the cultivation and harvesting techniques) appears to be critical for an industrial implementation of the HTL technology. With regard to the production of biofuels, fast growing species with high biomass productivity seem to be the best option for making microalgae HTL a successful technology...|$|R
