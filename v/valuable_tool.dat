5|$|Stem {{cell therapy}} is the {{replacement}} of damaged neurons by transplantation of stem cells into affected regions of the brain. Experiments have yielded mixed results using this technique in animal models and preliminary human clinical trials. Whatever their future therapeutic potential, stem cells are already a <b>valuable</b> <b>tool</b> for studying Huntington's disease in the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|The iPad {{has several}} uses in the classroom, {{and has been}} praised as a <b>valuable</b> <b>tool</b> for homeschooling. Soon after the iPad was released, it was {{reported}} that 81% of the top book apps were for children. The iPad has also been called a revolutionary tool to help children with autism learn how to communicate and socialize more easily.|$|E
5|$|Food webs {{are often}} limited {{relative}} to the real world. Complete empirical measurements are generally restricted to a specific habitat, such as a cave or a pond, and principles gleaned from food web microcosm studies are extrapolated to larger systems. Feeding relations require extensive investigations into the gut contents of organisms, which {{can be difficult to}} decipher, or stable isotopes can be used to trace the flow of nutrient diets and energy through a food web. Despite these limitations, food webs remain a <b>valuable</b> <b>tool</b> in understanding community ecosystems.|$|E

5|$|Structural {{alignment}} {{attempts to}} establish homology between {{two or more}} polymer structures based on their shape and three-dimensional conformation. This process is usually applied to protein tertiary structures but {{can also be used}} for large RNA molecules. In contrast to simple structural superposition, where at least some equivalent residues of the two structures are known, structural alignment requires no a priori knowledge of equivalent positions. Structural alignment is a <b>valuable</b> <b>tool</b> for the comparison of proteins with low sequence similarity, where evolutionary relationships between proteins cannot be easily detected by standard sequence alignment techniques. Structural alignment can therefore be used to imply evolutionary relationships between proteins that share very little common sequence. However, caution should be used in using the results as evidence for shared evolutionary ancestry because of the possible confounding effects of convergent evolution by which multiple unrelated amino acid sequences converge on a common tertiary structure.|$|E

25|$|Iceland has {{extensive}} genealogical records {{dating back}} to the late 17th century and fragmentary records extending back to the Age of Settlement. The biopharmaceutical company deCODE genetics has funded the creation of a genealogy database that is intended to cover all of Iceland's known inhabitants. It views the database, called Íslendingabók, as a <b>valuable</b> <b>tool</b> for conducting research on genetic diseases, given the relative isolation of Iceland's population.|$|E
30|$|Later, Clunie’s theorem {{has been}} {{improved}} into many forms (see [2], pp. 39 - 44) which are <b>valuable</b> <b>tools</b> for studying meromorphic solutions of Painlevé and other non-linear differential equations; see, e.g., [2].|$|R

25|$|There {{have been}} many calls for {{alternative}} approaches to rupture risk assessment over the past number of years, with many believing that a biomechanics-based approach may be more suitable than the current diameter approach. Numerical modeling is a <b>valuable</b> <b>tool</b> to researchers allowing approximate wall stresses to be calculated, thus revealing the rupture potential of a particular aneurysm. Experimental models are required to validate these numerical results and provide a further insight into the biomechanical behavior of the AAA. In vivo, AAAs exhibit a varying range of material strengths from localised weak hypoxic regions to much stronger regions and areas of calcifications.|$|E
25|$|Krumm (voiced by David Eccles) – Like {{the rest}} of his family, his eyeballs are not {{attached}} to his body, and are usually carried in his hands; if he requires the use of both hands, he can carry them in his mouth. His most <b>valuable</b> <b>tool</b> in scaring is his overwhelming armpit stench, as well as using his eyeballs. A running gag in the series is that Krumm sometimes loses his eyeballs and has to get them back, once {{going so far as to}} make a fake head to keep from losing them. His dad is a mold farmer.|$|E
25|$|As the {{temperature}} increases, an amorphous solid will become less viscous. At {{some point the}} molecules may obtain enough freedom of motion to spontaneously arrange themselves into a crystalline form. This {{is known as the}} crystallization temperature (Tc). This transition from amorphous solid to crystalline solid is an exothermic process, and results in a peak in the DSC signal. As {{the temperature}} increases the sample eventually reaches its melting temperature (Tm). The melting process results in an endothermic peak in the DSC curve. The ability to determine transition temperatures and enthalpies makes DSC a <b>valuable</b> <b>tool</b> in producing phase diagrams for various chemical systems.|$|E

25|$|The Indian Evidence Act of {{the same}} year, entirely Stephen's own work, made the rules of {{evidence}} uniform for all residents of India, regardless of caste, social position, or religion. Besides drafting legislation, at this time Stephen had {{to attend to the}} current administrative business of his department, and he took a full share in the general deliberations of the viceroy's council. His last official act in India was the publication of a minute on the administration of justice which pointed the way to reforms not yet fully realized, and is still a <b>valuable</b> <b>tool</b> for anyone wishing to understand the judicial system of British India.|$|E
25|$|Many forces also operate unmarked cars, {{in any of}} {{the roles}} shown above, but most {{frequently}} for the use of traffic enforcement or detectives. They have the advantage of not being immediately recognizable, and are a <b>valuable</b> <b>tool</b> in catching criminals while the crime is still taking place. In the United States, unmarked cars are also used by federal law enforcement agencies such as the FBI and the Secret Service, but can be recognized by their U.S. government plates. However, not all unmarked police cars have government license plates. Many U.S. jurisdictions use regular civilian issued license plates on unmarked cars, especially gang suppression and vice prevention units. Also see Q-car.|$|E
25|$|Recently, chloroplasts {{have caught}} {{attention}} by developers {{of genetically modified}} crops. Since, in most flowering plants, chloroplasts are not inherited from the male parent, transgenes in these plastids cannot be disseminated by pollen. This makes plastid transformation a <b>valuable</b> <b>tool</b> for the creation and cultivation of genetically modified plants that are biologically contained, thus posing significantly lower environmental risks. This biological containment strategy is therefore suitable for establishing the coexistence of conventional and organic agriculture. While the reliability of this mechanism {{has not yet been}} studied for all relevant crop species, recent results in tobacco plants are promising, showing a failed containment rate of transplastomic plants at 3 in 1,000,000.|$|E
50|$|Current {{research}} efforts also include directing the fate {{and age of}} human pluripotent stem cells, and using pluripotent stem cells as <b>valuable</b> <b>tools</b> for modeling human diseases such as Familial Dysautonomia, Hirschsprung's disease, neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as melanocyte-related diseases.|$|R

30|$|Using a {{different}} technique based on reducing the studied equation into a first-order Riccati-type inequality, {{which is generally}} considered {{as one of the}} most <b>valuable</b> <b>tools</b> in the oscillation theory, Li et al. [15] provided the following criterion for property A of (1.1).|$|R
25|$|The cooling {{produced}} in the Joule–Thomson expansion makes it a <b>valuable</b> <b>tool</b> in refrigeration. The effect is applied in the Linde technique as a standard process in the petrochemical industry, where the cooling effect is used to liquefy gases, and also in many cryogenic applications (e.g. {{for the production of}} liquid oxygen, nitrogen, and argon). A gas must be below its inversion temperature to be liquefied by the Linde cycle. For this reason, simple Linde cycle liquefiers, starting from ambient temperature, cannot be used to liquefy helium, hydrogen, or neon. However, the Joule–Thomson effect can be used to liquefy even helium, provided that the helium gas is first cooled below its inversion temperature of 40 K.|$|E
25|$|Chirality {{is another}} {{property}} that a DNAzyme can exploit. DNA occurs in {{nature as a}} right-handed double helix and in asymmetric synthesis a chiral catalyst is a <b>valuable</b> <b>tool</b> in the synthesis of chiral molecules from an achiral source. In one application an artificial DNA catalyst was prepared by attaching a copper ion to it through a spacer. The copper - DNA complex catalysed a Diels-Alder reaction in water between cyclopentadiene and an aza chalcone. The reaction products (endo and exo) {{were found to be}} present in an enantiomeric excess of 50%. Later it was found that an enantiomeric excess of 99% could be induced, and that both the rate and the enantioselectivity were related to the DNA sequence.|$|E
25|$|Ergonomic {{simulation}} {{involves the}} analysis of virtual products or manual tasks within a virtual environment. In the engineering process, the aim of ergonomics is to develop and to improve the design of products and work environments. Ergonomic simulation utilizes an anthropometric virtual representation of the human, commonly referenced as a mannequin or Digital Human Models (DHMs), to mimic the postures, mechanical loads, and performance of a human operator in a simulated environment such as an airplane, automobile, or manufacturing facility. DHMs are recognized as evolving and <b>valuable</b> <b>tool</b> for performing proactive ergonomics analysis and design. The simulations employ 3D-graphics and physics-based models to animate the virtual humans. Ergonomics software uses inverse kinematics (IK) capability for posing the DHMs. Several ergonomic simulation tools have been developed including Jack, SAFEWORK, RAMSIS, and SAMMIE.|$|E
