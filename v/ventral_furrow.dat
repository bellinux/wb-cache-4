50|$|The {{molecular}} {{picture of}} apical constriction is most complete for Drosophila. During Drosophila gastrulation, apical constriction of midline cells initiates invagination {{to create the}} <b>ventral</b> <b>furrow.</b> Like in Xenopus, actomyosin contractility {{plays a major role}} in constricting the apical side of the cell. The constricting cells have an actin meshwork directly beneath the apical membrane as well as circumferential actin belts lining the adherens junctions between cells. Pulsed contractions of the actin meshwork are believed to be primarily responsible for reducing the apical surface area.|$|E
50|$|In Drosophila, {{researchers}} have also pinpointed the molecules responsible for coordinating apical constriction in time.

The transmembrane protein T48 is part of a redundant pathway that is also needed for coordination of apical constriction. Both pathways must be disrupted in order to completely block <b>ventral</b> <b>furrow</b> formation.

50|$|After {{the initial}} stage of embryogenesis, the {{implantation}} of the embryo and {{the initiation of}} placenta formation are associated with EMT. The trophoectoderm cells undergo EMT to facilitate the invasion of endometrium and appropriate placenta placement, thus enabling nutrient and gas exchange to the embryo. Later in embryogenesis, during gastrulation, EMT allows the cells to ingress in a specific area of the embryo - the primitive streak in amniotes, and the <b>ventral</b> <b>furrow</b> in Drosophila. The cells in this tissue express E-cadherin and apical-basal polarity. Since gastrulation is a very rapid process, E-cadherin is repressed transcriptionally by Twist and SNAI1 (commonly called Snail), and at the protein level by P38 interacting protein. The primitive streak, through invagination, further generates mesoendoderm, which separates to form a mesoderm and an endoderm, again through EMT. Mesenchymal cells from the primitive streak participate also {{in the formation of}} many epithelial mesodermal organs, such as notochord as well as somites, through the reverse of EMT, i.e. mesenchymal-epithelial transition. Amphioxus forms an epithelial neural tube and dorsal notochord but does not have the EMT potential of the primitive streak. In higher chordates, the mesenchyme originates out of the primitive streak migrates anteriorly to form the somites and participate with neural crest mesenchyme in formation of the heart mesoderm.|$|E

A comparative proteomics approach employing difference gel electrophoresis was used to identify more than fifty proteins with altered abundance levels or isoform changes in ventralized versus lateralized embryos. Curiously, the majority of protein differences between these embryos appeared well before gastrulation, only a few protein changes coincided with gastrulation, suggesting that the ventral cells are primed for cell shape change. Three proteasome subunits were found to differ between ventralized and lateralized embryos.

40|$|In Drosophila, <b>ventral</b> <b>furrow</b> {{formation}} and mesoderm differentiation are initiated by two regulatory genes, twist (twi) and snail (sna).

Evidence is presented that sna is sufficient to initiate the invagination of the ventral-most embryonic cells {{in the absence of}} twi+ gene activity. The invaginated cells fail to express mesoderm regulatory genes, suggesting that <b>ventral</b> <b>furrow</b> formation can be uncoupled from mesoderm differentiation. Despite the previous demonstration that sna functions as a sequence-specific transcriptional repressor, low levels of sna that fail to repress neuroectoderm determinants in the presumptive mesoderm are nonetheless able to promote invagination.

40|$|<b>Ventral</b> <b>furrow</b> {{formation}} in Drosophila {{is an outstanding}} model system to study the mechanisms involved in large-scale tissue rearrangements. Ventral cells accumulate myosin at their apical sides and, while being tightly coupled to each other via apical adherens junctions, execute actomyosin contractions that lead to reduction of their apical cell surface. Thereby, a band of constricted cells along the ventral epithelium emerges which will form a tissue indentation along the ventral midline (the <b>ventral</b> <b>furrow).</b> Here we adopt a 2 D vertex model to simulate <b>ventral</b> <b>furrow</b> {{formation in}} a surface view allowing easy comparison with confocal live-recordings. We show {{that in order to}} reproduce furrow morphology seen in vivo, a gradient of contractility must be assumed in the ventral epithelium which renders cells more contractile the closer they lie to the ventral midline. The model predicts previous experimental findings, such as the gain of eccentric morphology of constricting cells and an incremental fashion of apical cell area reduction. Analysis of the model suggests that this incremental area reduction is caused by the dynamical interplay of cell elasticity and stochastic contractility {{as well as by the}} opposing forces from contracting neighbour cells. We underpin results from the model through in vivo analysis of <b>ventral</b> <b>furrow</b> formation in wildtype and twi mutant embryos. Our results show that <b>ventral</b> <b>furrow</b> formation can be accomplished as a "tug-of-war" between stochastically contracting, mechanically coupled cells and may require less rigorous regulation than previously thought. For the developmental biologist it is a fascinating question how cells can coordinate major tissue movements during embryonic development. The so-called <b>ventral</b> <b>furrow</b> of the Drosophila embryo is a well-studied example of such a process when cells from a ventral band, spanning nearly the entire length of the embryo, undergo dramatic shape change by contracting their tips and then fold inwards into the interior of the embryo. Although numerous genes have been identified that are critical for <b>ventral</b> <b>furrow</b> formation, it is an open question how cells work together to elicit this tissue rearrangement. We use a computational model to mimic the physical properties of cells in the ventral epithelium and simulate the formation of the furrow. We find that the <b>ventral</b> <b>furrow</b> can form through stochastic self-organisation and that previous experimental observations can be readily explained in our model by considering forces that arise when cells execute contractions while being coupled to each other in a mechanically coherent epithelium. The model highlights the importance of a physical perspective when studying tissue morphogenesis and shows that only a minimal genetic regulation may be required to drive complex processes in embryonic development...|$|E
40|$|<b>Ventral</b> <b>furrow</b> {{formation}} {{is the first}} morphogenetic movement to occur during Drosophila gastrulation causing the internalization of mesodermal precursors. A previous proteomic screen for ventral-specific proteome changes identified a set of about forty 2 ̆ 2 difference-proteins 2 ̆ 2 that spanned many cellular functions. To understand the connections between these disparate proteins, we initiated a pathway-building scheme using cycles of protein expression manipulation and proteome analysis. This pathway-building exercise started with the proteasomal subunit, Pros 35, one of three proteasome subunits found to be ventral-specific difference-proteins. Here we show that Pros 35 is a key regulator in <b>ventral</b> <b>furrow</b> formation. Altering the level of Pros 35 led to <b>ventral</b> <b>furrow</b> defects. Proteome analysis of the changes induced by Pros 35 RNAi showed extensive overlap with the original set of ventral-specific difference-proteins. One {{of the most prominent}} changes was in the extracellular iron carrier, Transferrin (Tsf 1). Tsf 1 is normally less abundant in ventral cells relative to lateral cells; however, RNAi of Pros 35 in ventralized embryos negated this ventral-specific difference. Increasing Tsf 1 in wild-type embryos blocked <b>ventral</b> <b>furrow</b> formation and caused proteome changes that were similar to the previously seen ventral-specific difference-proteins, including Pros 35, which indicates the existence of an unprecedented regulatory loop between the proteasome and iron homeostasis. Additionally, we show that the iron regulatory protein, Irp- 1 A, also {{plays an important role in}} <b>ventral</b> <b>furrow</b> formation. Together these three proteins are part of a regulatory loop that coordinately controls a large number of ventral-specific protein changes...|$|E

Although many of the genes involved have been identified, the details of the mechanical processes that convert local changes in gene expression into whole-scale changes in embryonic form remain to be fully understood. Biologists have identified two main cell deformation modes responsible for <b>ventral</b> <b>furrow</b> invagination: constriction of the apical ends of the cells (apical wedging) and deformation along their apical–basal axes (radial lengthening/shortening). In this work, we used a computer 2 D finite element model of <b>ventral</b> <b>furrow</b> formation to investigate the ability of different combinations of three plausible elementary active cell shape changes to bring about epithelial invagination: ectodermal apical–basal shortening, mesodermal apical–basal lengthening/shortening and mesodermal apical constriction. We undertook a systems analysis of the biomechanical system, which revealed many different combinations of active forces (invagination mechanisms) were able to generate a <b>ventral</b> <b>furrow.</b> Two important general features were revealed. First that combinations of shape changes are the most robust to environmental and mutational perturbation, in particular those combining ectodermal pushing and mesodermal wedging.

40|$|Gastrulation in Drosophila {{begins with}} <b>ventral</b> <b>furrow</b> formation. Although some genes {{required}} for <b>ventral</b> <b>furrow</b> formation have been known, {{it was evident}} that as yet unidentified genes were involved in this process. Thus, a screen to identify new loci involved in <b>ventral</b> <b>furrow</b> formation was performed previously, implicating the cytogenetic region 24 - 25 on the left arm of the second chromosome among other regions. In this study, further genetic analysis of this region was carried out to pinpoint and fine map the locus or loci in the 24 - 25 region that are responsible for the defect in <b>ventral</b> <b>furrow</b> formation. It was found that at least two genetically separable maternal loci and one zygotic locus were involved in the observed defects. Mapping of the different loci were carried out. The maternal loci were narrowed down to short genomic stretches of 15 - 20 Kb and a candidate gene for the zygotic effect, Traf 1 was identified. Traf 1 was identified based on the Traf 1 expression pattern. Later, it was found that Traf 1 is a Twist target and embryos from available hypomorphic alleles of Traf 1 exhibited defects in gastrulation. However, conclusive evidence in this regard requires a complete loss of function allele. Overexpression of Traf 1 in the mesoderm also caused defective gastrulation, possibly mediated by the ability of Traf 1 to activate the JNK signalling cascade. It was found that the gastrulation defects observed upon overexpression of Traf 1 was not due to cell fate changes or abnormal cell division. Further investigations are required to identify the precise processes affected upon such overexpression that lead to gastrulation defects...|$|E
40|$|The article {{provides}} a biomechanical analysis of <b>ventral</b> <b>furrow</b> {{formation in the}} Drosophila melanogaster embryo. <b>Ventral</b> <b>furrow</b> formation is the first large-scale morphogenetic movement in the fly embryo. It involves deformation of a uniform cellular monolayer formed following cellularisation, and has therefore long {{been used as a}} simple system in which to explore the role of mechanics in force generation. Here we use a quantitative framework to carry out a systematic perturbation analysis to determine the role of each of the active forces observed. The analysis confirms that <b>ventral</b> <b>furrow</b> invagination arises from a combination of apical constriction and apical–basal shortening forces in the mesoderm, together with a combination of ectodermal forces. We show that the mesodermal forces are crucial for invagination: the loss of apical constriction leads to a loss of the furrow, while the mesodermal radial shortening forces are the primary cause of the internalisation of the future mesoderm as the furrow rises. Ectodermal forces play a minor but significant role in furrow formation: without ectodermal forces the furrow is slower to form, does not close properly and has an aberrant morphology. Nevertheless, despite changes in the active mesodermal and ectodermal forces lead to changes in the timing and extent of furrow, invagination is eventually achieved in most cases, implying that the system is robust to perturbatio...|$|E

We seek to understand how changes in the Drosophila dorsal-ventral patterning network produce diverse gastrulation profiles in other insects, specifically Anopheles gambiae. In D. melanogaster, the developmental genes folded gastrulation, or fog, and t 48 drive the flattening and constriction of cell apices that leads to coherent invagination of mesodermal cells to create a deep, linear <b>ventral</b> <b>furrow.</b> Although contested by current literature, we believe A. gambiae to also express fog.

This significant morphological difference challenges the role of fog in Anopheles gambiae embryogenesis and suggests that although present in both genomes, fog function may vary between flies and mosquitoes.

40|$|Tissue {{morphogenesis}} is {{the process}} in which coordinated movements and shape changes {{of large numbers of}} cells form tissues, organs, and the internal body structure. Understanding morphogenetic movements requires precise measurements of whole-cell shape changes over time. Tissue folding and invagination are thought to be facilitated by apical constriction, but the mechanism by which changes near the apical cell surface affect changes along the entire apical–basal axis of the cell remains elusive. Here, we developed Embryo Development Geometry Explorer, an approach for quantifying rapid whole-cell shape changes over time, and we combined it with deep-tissue time-lapse imaging based on fast two-photon microscopy to study Drosophila <b>ventral</b> <b>furrow</b> formation. We found that both the cell lengthening along the apical–basal axis and the movement of the nucleus to the basal side proceeded stepwise and were correlated with apical constriction. Moreover, cell volume lost apically due to constriction largely balanced the volume gained basally by cell lengthening. The volume above the nucleus was conserved during its basal movement. Both apical volume loss and cell lengthening were absent in mutants showing deficits in the contractile cytoskeleton underlying apical constriction. We conclude that a single mechanical mechanism involving volume conservation and apical constriction-induced basal movement of cytoplasm accounts quantitatively for the cell shape changes and the nucleus movement in Drosophila <b>ventral</b> <b>furrow</b> formation.

Many hybrid formalizations (i. e., with both discrete and continuous parts) have been proposed for modelling morphogenesis in embryonic or adult animals, like gastrulation and wound healing. We propose first to study the <b>ventral</b> <b>furrow</b> invagination as the initial step of gastrulation, early stage of embryogenesis. We focus {{on the study of}} the connection between the apical constriction of the ventral cells and the initiation of the invagination. For that, we have created a 3 D biomechanical model of the embryo of the Drosophila melanogaster based on the Finite Element Method. Each cell is modelled by an elastic hexahedron contour and is firmly attached to its neighbouring cells. A uniform initial distribution of elastic and contractile forces is applied to cells along the model. Numerical simulations show that invagination starts at ventral curved extremities of the embryo and then propagates to the ventral medial layer. Then, this experimental observation can be attributed uniquely to the specific shape of the embryo and we provide mechanical evidence to support it. Results of the simulations of the â€œpill-shapedâ€ geometry of the Drosophila melanogaster embryo are compared with those of a spherical geometry corresponding to the Xenopus lÃ¦vis embryo.

40|$|Spatiotemporally coordinated cell {{behavior}} is observed during morphogenesis, in both embryonic development {{as well as}} tissue regeneration. An open question is how individual cells collectively generate force to achieve the correct tissue architecture. This thesis examines how the apical forces generated by Drosophila <b>ventral</b> <b>furrow</b> cells undergoing collective apical constriction are coordinated to fold the tissue. In Chapter 2, I investigate how discrete actomyosin contraction events are coordinated in time and between neighboring cells to yield tissue contraction and folding. I developed a computational pipeline to identify and classify contraction events from live images of <b>ventral</b> <b>furrow</b> formation. Using this framework, I found heterogeneity in contraction events, {{both in terms of}} contraction intensity as well as apical area behavior. I found that apical constricting cells transition in contractile behavior over time, from undergoing reversible contractions into a ratcheted state where contractions are irreversible. High expression of the transcription factor Twist is required for the transition into this irreversible, ratcheted state, which is associated with more neighboring contractions as well as cooperative interactions between neighbors. In Chapter 3, I examined how contractility is buffered against heterogeneity in cell apical area. I found that Cta-signaling is required to robustly maintain apical Factin cortex that can support contracting over larger apical distances. Without this buffering, apically larger cells progressively lose apical F-actin and exhibit delayed initiation of actomyosin contractions, leading to a lack of coordinated constriction. by Shicong Xie.

40|$|Gastrulation is {{a period}} of {{embryonic}} development during which the three germ layers (mesoderm, ectoderm, and endoderm) arise and differentiate. This is a well-studied process in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster. The developmental genes folded gastrulation (fog) and T 48 drive the apical constriction that leads to a coherent invagination of mesodermal cells which creates the <b>ventral</b> <b>furrow,</b> a prominent physical feature of gastrulation. We wish to investigate how gastrulation in D. melanogaster compares to the process in other insects, specifically Anopheles gambiae, in order to elucidate the more intricate workings of apical constriction pathways in a different (yet closely related) organism. Investigation of gastrulation differences will highlight our understanding of how these pathways evolve and affect cell shape changes. Previous literature used Scanning Electron Microscopy to analyze morphological differences in A. gambiae and D. melanogaster and illustrated that the <b>ventral</b> <b>furrow</b> in A. gambiae is shallower than Drosophila’s. The authors implicated the lack of a fog homologue for this difference. However, we now have evidence that A. gambiae does have a fog homologue. It is not well known if fog, T 48, and other gastrulation-related genes have the same expression pattern or function in A. gambiae. Therefore, we wish to investigate so through in situ hybridization and fluorescence antibody studies. In order to do so, we must first create materials such as RNA probes and antibodies, which require a series of procedures, the first of which requires isolating and amplifying the gene homologue. The transcription factor gene twist has been successfully cloned and amplified along with abl, armadillo, DECadherin, ROK, and RhoGEF 2 (previously cloned in Biology Superlab). We are attempting to ligate twist into an expression vector so we can collect a histidine-tagged protein product which can be isolated for antibody preparation...|$|E
