There were a few problems with the system, however, such as audio quality and volume levels.|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: Modern {{signs in}} the Kiev Metro are in Ukrainian. The {{evolution}} in their language followed {{the changes in the}} language policies in post-war Ukraine. Originally, all signs and <b>voice</b> <b>announcements</b> in the metro were in Ukrainian, but their language was changed to Russian in the early 1980s, at the height of Shcherbytsky's gradual Russification. In the perestroika liberalization of the late 1980s, the signs were changed to bilingual. This was accompanied by bilingual <b>voice</b> <b>announcements</b> in the trains. In the early 1990s, both signs and <b>voice</b> <b>announcements</b> were changed again from bilingual to Ukrainian-only during the de-russification campaign that followed Ukraine's independence. Since 2012 the signs have been in both Ukrainian and English.|$|R
