50|$|The 196-acre (0.79-kmÂ²) Mount Tabor Park {{does not}} appear to have ever been {{formally}} ordained by the City as a park. According to archival records, an ordinance declaring Williams Park, named for a prominent citizen, was stopped by neighborhood activists wanting the historic name, Mt. Tabor Park, to be retained. No other ordinance appears to have been enacted to date. The entire park, including the Central Maintenance Yard, was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. The nomination was forwarded by a community effort spearheaded and funded by the Mt. Tabor Neighborhood Association. Mt. Tabor Park is known for its reservoirs, three of which were accepted to the National Register of Historic Places in January 2004. The reservoirs' nomination was also a community effort spearheaded by the Friends of the Reservoirs and funded by donations. The park was designed, along with other Portland parks, by Emanuel Tillman Mische, a highly pedigreed horticulturist and long-time landscape designer for the famed Olmsted Brothers landscape firm. John Charles Olmsted, stepson and nephew of the famed Frederick Law Olmsted, visited Portland in 1903 to help design the site for the Lewis and Clark World Exposition, on the request of Rev. Thomas Lamb Eliot, minister of the First Unitarian Church and relative of Charles Eliot, the son of the president of Harvard University and acclaimed landscape architect and partner in the Olmsted landscape firm in Brookline, Massachusetts. Rev. Eliot arranged for Olmsted to visit Seattle for park planning, too, in order to help make the long trip financially feasible. While John Charles Olmsted was in Portland, Rev. Eliot and other park supporters took him on a tour throughout the city so that he could create a grand plan of parks. Mt. Tabor Park was the largest Portland park until 1947 when Forest Park was created. The land making up the Mt. Tabor <b>volcanic</b> <b>butte</b> was identified for a park in the 1880s due to its ideal elevation for a water distribution system. City fathers formed a water committee and created a municipal water system piping water some 25 miles from the Bull Run River watershed, separate and west of Mt. Hood, to Mt. Tabor reservoirs and across the Willamette River to City Park reservoirs (now Washington Park) in 1894. The Bull Run watershed was among the first federal lands to be set aside in the Forest Reserve Act of 1891 and enacted by president Benjamin Harrison.|$|E

40|$|During two shallow thermal {{drilling}} programs, thermal measurements were obtained in 56 shallow (76. 2 m) and one intermediate (457. 3 m) depth holes located both onshore and offshore {{along the southern}} margin of the Salton Sea in the Imperial Valley, California. These data complete the surficial coverage of the thermal anomaly, revealing the shape and lateral extent of the hydrothermal system. The thermal data show the region of high thermal gradients to extend only a short distance offshore {{to the north of}} the Quaternary volcanic domes which are exposed along the southern shore of the Salton Sea. The thermal anomaly has an arcuate shape, about 4 km wide and 12 km long. Across the center of the anomaly, the transition zone between locations exhibiting high thermal gradients and those exhibiting regional thermal gradients is quite narrow. Thermal gradients rise from near regional (0. 09 C/m) to extreme (0. 83 C/m) in only 2. 4 km. The heat flow in the central part of the anomaly is > 600 mW/m{sup 2 } and in some areas exceeds 1200 mW/m{sup 2 }. The shape of the thermal anomaly is asymmetric with respect to the line of volcanoes previously thought to represent the center of the field, with its center line offset south of the <b>volcanic</b> <b>buttes.</b> There is no broad thermal anomaly associated with the magnetic high that extends offshore to the northeast from the volcanic domes. These observations of the thermal anomaly provide important constraints for models of the circulation of the hydrothermal system.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study of the Lyons flora is to {{determine}} the age and paleoecology of the flora through the examination and identification of the fossil plant species of the flora. The plant fossi Is comprising the Lyons flora were collected from a locality in the. t~~Â·fi:~ora upper Thomas Creek area, 5 mi les sou theast of the town of Lyons, Oregon. Geologic Occurrence The beds from which the Lyons flora was obtained are part of the Little <b>Butte</b> <b>Volcanic</b> Series of Oligocene and early Miocene age described by Peck and others(1964). Stratigraphically below the fossil deposit, the Little <b>Butte</b> <b>Volcanic</b> Series is characterized by a pumiceous tuff-breccia which contains blocks and fragments of a volcanic flow rock.

40|$|The Sleeping <b>Butte</b> <b>volcanic</b> centers {{comprise}} two, spatially separate, small-volume (< 0. 1 km{sup 3 }) basaltic centers. The centers {{were formed}} by mildly explosive Strombolian eruptions. The Little Black Peak cone {{consists of a}} main scoria cone, two small satellitic scoria mounds, and associated lobate lava flows that vented from sites {{at the base of}} the scoria cone. The Hidden Cone center consists of a main scoria cone that developed on the north-facing slope of Sleeping Butte. The center formed during two episodes. The first included the formation of the main scoria cone, and venting of aa lava flows from radial dikes at the northeast base of the cone. The second included eruption of scoria-fall deposits from the summit crater. The ages of the Little Black Peak and the Hidden Cone are estimated to be between 200 to 400 ka based on the whole-rock K-Ar age determinations with large analytical undertainty. This age assignment is consistent with qualitative observations of the degree of soil development and geomorphic degradation of volcanic landforms. The younger episode of the Hidden Cone is inferred to be significantly younger and probably of Late Pleistocene or Holocene age. This is based on the absence of cone slope rilling, the absence of cone-slope apron deposits, and erosional unconformity between the two episodes, the poor horizon- development of soils, and the presence of fall deposits on modern alluvial surfaces. Paleomagnetic data show that the centers record similar but not identical directions of remanent magnetization. Paleomagnetic data have not been obtained for the youngest deposits of the Hidden Cone center.

40|$|Volcanic tuffs and tuffaceous sediments are {{frequently}} associated with elevated As groundwater concentrations {{even though their}} bulk As contents (5 mg kg- 1; Savoie, 2013) are only marginally greater than the average crustal abundance of 4. 8 mg g- 1 (Rudnick 2 Ì 6 Gao, 2003). Thus, As mobilization must be facilitated by conditions particular to these rocks. Alkaline desorption, anionic competition, reactive glass dissolution, and reductive dissolution of iron oxides are proposed processes of As release from volcanic rocks. Geogenic As contamination of groundwater in the southern Willamette Valley in western Oregon has been well-documented since the early 1960 s, and previous studies have identified the Little <b>Butte</b> <b>Volcanics</b> Series and Fisher and Eugene Formations {{as the source of}} As contamination. This study examines 19 samples from 10 units of ash flow tuffs and tuffaceous sediments within the Fisher Formation and Little <b>Butte</b> <b>Volcanics</b> Series, representing a range of weathering and devitrification, to determine conditions of mobilization and mineralogical constraints that control As release into solution. Leachate studies were conducted over a range of pH from 7 to 11, phosphate concentrations from 10 Î¼M to 100 mM, and in time series from 4 to 196 hours. Results demonstrate that silicic volcanic tuffs are capable of mobilizing As in concentrations above regulatory limits at pH conditions produced naturally by the tuffs (pH 8 - 9) or with moderate concentrations of P (10 - 100 Î¼M). Alteration products, e. g. zeolites and clays, appear to be the primary host phases for mobile As. Samples that do not contain these alteration products tend to produce concentrations of As well below regulatory limits and often below the instrument detection limits of this study. The type of alteration may influence As mobilization: tuffs containing more clays tend to mobilize As through surficial desorption, and tuffs containing more zeolites tend to mobilize As by dissolution or formation of colloids. Additionally, one volcaniclastic sample demonstrates that extremely elevated concentrations of As, up to 1000 Î¼g/L are possible as a result of oxidative dissolution of As-bearing sulfide phases...|$|R

40|$|Over 200 diatremes {{occur in}} the Hopi <b>Buttes</b> <b>volcanic</b> {{province}} on the southwestern flank of the Black Mesa basin in northeastern Arizona. The diatremes are funnel-shaped vents with maar craters at the surface. They were formed by phreatomagmatic eruptions along existing northwest-southeast fractures during mid-Pliocene time. Anomalous concentrations of uranium occur in at least 20 of the diatremes. The diatremes and dikes which feed them are composed of lamprophyres, monchiquite, and limburgite. Tuff breccias and agglomerates rimming the vents consist of sedimentary and igneous fragments in a limburgite matrix. The maars contain waterlaid deposits of interlayered tuff, claystone, and marl.

The lack of correlation between U and Hf or Th indicates that uranium traveled in mobile phases and was segregated from many elements in the lamprophyres. Localization of uranium in maar-type diatremes may have occurred as fluids percolated up through frac-tures in the vents and mixed with ground and surface waters...|$|R
2500|$|The High Lava Plains {{ecoregion}} is a vast, nearly {{level to}} undulating sagebrush steppe containing scattered <b>volcanic</b> cones and <b>buttes.</b> Elevation varies from 4,200to6,800feet (1,280to2,073m). The region {{is similar to}} the Dissected High Lava Plateau in its physiography, climate, and vegetation, but, unlike the plateau, it is internally drained. As a result, it lacks anadromous fish runs. It also differs from the plateau in having numerous intermittent lakes on the impermeable volcanic bedrock. Vegetation on the steppe includes Wyoming big sagebrush, low sagebrush, mountain big sagebrush, Lahontan sagebrush, bluebunch wheatgrass, Sandberg's bluegrass, Thurber's needlegrass, bottlebrush squirreltail, and Idaho fescue. Silver sagebrush, creeping wildrye, and mat muhly are found in depressions. Shallow and rocky soils support scattered western juniper. The federally threatened Warner sucker fish lives in permanent, shallow, weedy lakes and spawns in Nevada's Twelvemile Creek. The Wall Canyon area supports a unique fish species, the Wall Canyon sucker. Higher elevations once supported Lahontan cutthroat trout but water availability limits their present distribution. The largest of the Northern Basin and Range subregions, the High Lava Plains covers [...] in Oregon and [...] in Nevada, featuring a variety of land uses, including rangeland, wildlife habitat, irrigated pastureland and cropland, historic gold and silver mines, and active opal mines and clay quarries. It contains the Sheldon National Wildlife Refuge and lower elevations in the Hart Mountain National Antelope Refuge. Contiguous areas in California have not been mapped yet.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 The Hampton Tuff is a 3. 9 Â±. 02 Ma (2 Ï) {{ignimbrite}} sheet {{from the}} High Lava Plains of central Oregon. The majority of known outcrops exist to the north, within 22 mi (35 km) of the Frederick <b>Butte</b> <b>Volcanic</b> Center, the proposed {{source of the}} tuff. Thickness of the tuff is typically 8 m (25 ft), but varies from 6. 5 m (20 ft) up to 46 m (150 ft). In nearly all cases, these are minimum thicknesses as the bases of outcrops are rarely exposed and the tops are eroded. Assuming a constant thickness of 8 m and a defined area of 2418 kmÂ², the estimated eruption volume is 20 kmÂ³, dense rock equivalent (DRE). Welding facies varies from nonwelded with pumice to densely welded with fiamme. Westward migration of bimodal volcanism of the High Lava Plains consists mainly of rhyolitic domes, ignimbrites and ash-flow sheets, and is associated with widespread tholeiitic basalt. Ignimbrites represent the dominant volume of erupted high-silica rhyolite in this region and include the Devine Canyon Tuff (9. 7 Ma), the Prater Creek Tuff (8. 4 Ma), and the Rattlesnake Tuff (7. 1 Ma); each of which represents 100 - 300 kmÂ³ of erupted material. A westward younging trend of rhyolitic volcanism of the High Lava Plains represents a coarse mirror of the northeast trending Yellowstone hotspot track from 12 Ma to present. The Hampton Tuff is the youngest and westernmost tuff of the mapped ignimbrites within this westward younging trend. Although less voluminous than other High Lava Plains ignimbrites, the Hampton Tuff bears the high-iron signature (up to 3. 9 wt...|$|R
