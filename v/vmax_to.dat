Density of functional glands (determined by responses to 1 μM carbachol) was 1. 5 ± 0. 3 per mm 2 (n = 6). Secretion rates (in pl·min− 1 ·gland− 1) were as follows: 4. 1 ± 0. 7 basal (unstimulated; n = 27, 669 glands), 338 ± 70 to 10 μM forskolin (n = 8, 90 glands), 234 ± 13 to 1 μM VIP (n = 6, 57 glands), 183 ± 92 to 10 μM isoproterenol (n = 3, 33 glands), 978 ± 145 to 1 μM carbachol (n = 11, 131 glands), and 1, 348 ± 325 to 10 μM phenylephrine (n = 7, 74 glands). The potency (EC 50, in μM) and efficacy (Vmax, in pl·min− 1 ·gland− 1) were 7. 6 (EC 50) and 338 ± 16 (<b>Vmax)</b> <b>to</b> forskolin, 1. 0 (EC 50) and 479 ± 19 (<b>Vmax)</b> <b>to</b> VIP, 0. 6 (EC 50) and 1, 817 ± 268 (<b>Vmax)</b> <b>to</b> carbachol, and 3. 7 (EC 50) and 1, 801 ± 95 (<b>Vmax)</b> <b>to</b> phenylephrine. Although carbachol and phenylephrine were equally effective secretagogues, only carbachol caused contractions of the trachealis muscle.

The dependence of fluid secretion on Cl− and HCO 3 − varied {{depending on the}} mode of stimulation. Secretion stimulated by VIP or forskolin was reduced by ∼ 60 % by blocking either anion, while carbachol-stimulated secretion was blocked 68 % by bumetanide and only 32 % by HEPES replacement of HCO 3 −.

Lactate production and the relationship between contractile force and O 2 consumption were uninfluenced by BGPA treatment. The force-velocity relation of electrically stimulated portal veins showed no influence of BGPA treatment on <b>Vmax.</b> <b>To</b> investigate whether decrease in PCr influenced the response to metabolic stress, portal veins were exposed to graded concentrations (0. 1 - 0. 5 mM) of cyanide to depress cellular respiration.

Availability of the fast sodium channel for current flow was inferred from the maximum rate of rise of membrane potential during phase O of the action potential (<b>Vmax).</b> Muscle exposed <b>to</b> polysorbate 80 (10 to 80 micrograms ml- 1) showed a concentration-dependent lengthening of action potential duration (APD) but no detectable change in <b>Vmax.</b> Amiodarone (1 <b>to</b> 20 micrograms ml- 1) was dissolved in physiological salt solution {{with the aid of}} polysorbate 80 (50 micrograms ml- 1) and caused a concentration-dependent prolongation of APD and a decrease in Vmax, both of which were slow to develop and extremely slow to wash-out. The speed of onset of action of amiodarone varied with drug concentration and ranged from a few minutes with high concentrations to many hours with low concentrations...|$|R
40|$|Vmax and Km {{values with}} twenty-five "atypical" and thirty-seven "usual" cholinesterase human sera were {{determined}} for the cholinesterase substrates procaine, tetracaine, benzoylcholine, o-nitro-phenylbutyrate, [alpha]-naphthylacetate and aspirin. Aspirin was demonstrated to be a substrate for serum cholinesterase. For {{each of these}} substrates the ratio of <b>Vmax</b> substrate <b>to</b> <b>Vmax</b> benzoylcholine {{was found to be}} similar with atypical and usual cholinesterase sera. Therefore, we concluded that the respective turnover numbers for atypical and usual cholinesterase were the same. Both atypical and usual cholinesterase sera had turnover numbers of 255 min- 1 for procaine, 74 min- 1 for tetracaine, 7200 min- 1 for aspirin in the presence of 50 mM CaCl 2 36, 000 min- 1 for [alpha]-naphthylacetate, and 48, 000 min- 1 for o-nitrophenylbutyrate, at 25 [deg] in 0. 1 M Tris-Cl buffer, pH 7. 4. A comparison of Km values for atypical and usual cholinesterase indicated that the positively charged substrates, as well as aspirin in the presence of CaCl 2, showed a lower affinity with atypical than with usual cholinesterase, while neutral esters had nearly the same Km for atypical and usual cholinesterase. These results imply that individuals with atypical cholinesterase will hydrolyze therapeutic doses of positively charged substrates and aspirin at reduced rates, but neutral substrates should be hydrolyzed at normal rates...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn wheat, non-phosphorylating, NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate {{dehydrogenase}} (GAPN) {{was found}} to be encoded by one gene giving rise to a single protein. However, Western blots revealed two different subunits of about 58 and 60 kDa in endosperm and shoots. The latter was attributed to in vivo phosphorylation of shoot GAPN. No modification occurred in leaves, where the enzyme is composed by a single 58 kDa polypeptide. GAPN partially purified from shoots and endosperm was dephosphorylated in vitro with alkaline phosphatase. Phosphorylated GAPN exhibited similar affinity for substrates but a lower <b>Vmax</b> compared <b>to</b> the non-phosphorylated enzyme. Results suggest that reversible phosphorylation of GAPN could regulate NADPH production in the cytosol of heterotrophic plant cells...|$|R
