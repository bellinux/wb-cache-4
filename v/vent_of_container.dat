40|$|The <b>venting</b> <b>of</b> {{cylindrical}} <b>containers</b> partially {{filled with}} initially saturated liquids was conducted under zero gravity conditions and {{compared with an}} analytical model which determined the effect of interfacial mass transfer on the ullage pressure response during venting. A model is proposed to improve the estimation of the interfacial mass transfer. Duhammel's superposition integral is incorporated in this analysis to approximate the transient temperature response of the interface, treating the liquid as a semiinfinite solid with conduction heat transfer. This approach to estimating interfacial mass transfer gives improved response when compared to previous models. The model still predicts a pressure decrease greater {{than those in the}} experiments reported...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} is to predict the pressure response of a saturated liquid-vapor system when undergoing a venting or depressurization process in zero gravity at low vent rates. An experimental investigation <b>of</b> the <b>venting</b> <b>of</b> cylindrical <b>containers</b> partially filled with initially saturated liquids was previously conducted under zero-gravity conditions and compared with an analytical model which incorporated the effect of interfacial mass transfer on the ullage pressure response during venting. A new model is presented to improve the estimation of the interfacial mass transfer. Duhammel's superposition integral is incorporated to approximate the transient temperature response of the interface, treating the liquid as a semi-infinite solid with conduction heat transfer. Account is also taken of the condensation taking place within the bulk of a saturated vapor as isentropic expansion takes place. Computational results are presented for the <b>venting</b> <b>of</b> R- 11 from a given vessel and initial state for five different venting rates {{over a period of}} three seconds, and compared to prior NASA experiments. An improvement in the prediction of the final pressure takes place, but is still considerably below the measurements...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the Savannah River Site Accelerated Transuranic (TRU) Waste Project that was initiated in April of 2009 {{to accelerate the}} disposition of remaining legacy transuranic waste at the site. An overview of the project execution strategy that was implemented is discussed along with the lessons learned, challenges and improvements to date associated with waste characterization, facility modifications, startup planning, and remediation activities. The legacy waste was generated from approximately 1970 through 1990 and originated both on site {{as well as at}} multiple US Department of Energy sites. Approximately two thirds of the waste was previously dispositioned from 2006 to 2008, with the remaining one third being the more hazardous waste due to its activity (curie content) and the plutonium isotope Pu- 238 quantities in the waste. The project strategy is a phased approach beginning with the lower activity waste in existing facilities while upgrades are made to support remediation of the higher activity waste. Five waste remediation process lines will be used to support the full remediation efforts which involve receipt of the legacy waste <b>container,</b> removal <b>of</b> prohibited items, <b>venting</b> <b>of</b> <b>containers,</b> and resizing <b>of</b> contents to fit into current approved waste shipping containers. Modifications have been minimized to the extent possible to meet the accelerated goals and involve limited upgrades to address life safety requirements, radiological containment needs, and handling equipment for the larger waste containers. Upgrades are also in progress for implementation of the TRUPACT III for the shipment of Standard Large Boxes to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, the US TRU waste repository. The use of this larger shipping container is necessary for approximately 20 % of the waste by volume due to limited size reduction capability. To date, approximately 25 % of the waste has been dispositioned, and several improvements have been made to the overall processing plan as well as facility processing rates. These lessons learned, challenges, and improvements will be discussed to aid other sites in their efforts to conduct similar activities...|$|R

40|$|Within {{the whole}} world {{container}} traffic, the largest share <b>of</b> <b>containers</b> is in the status <b>of</b> repositioning. <b>Container</b> repositioning results from the need for harmonization between the point <b>of</b> empty <b>container</b> accumulation and the point of demand, and waiting time for {{the availability of the}} first next transport of cargo.
