25|$|Rousseau portrays Geneva in a <b>very</b> <b>romantic</b> and {{positive}} light, {{where people are}} productive, happy and hard at work, but he also recognizes the extreme wealth and poverty in the city. He first tries to sway Geneva away {{from the idea of}} theatre by suggesting that it is not economically feasible, and that the population is too low to support a theatre.|$|E
500|$|Nixon and Broderick also crafted the {{character}} as a darkly brooding and mysterious {{man in the}} same vein as gothic literary heroes such as Heathcliff from Wuthering Heights, Edward Rochester from Jane Eyre, and Maxim de Winter from Rebecca. Nixon used these characters as inspiration for Dimitri because, as she told Soap Opera Weekly, [...] "In doing the 'stolen life' story, I felt that we needed something to follow that was also a little larger than life, <b>very</b> <b>romantic,</b> and gothic." [...] The characters played a part in shaping Dimitri as well as his environment and storylines. Maxim de Winter's estate, Manderley, provided the inspiration for Dimitri's Pine Valley estate, Wildwind. The design was taken from both the description in Du Maurier's book and the depiction from the film Rebecca, a 1940 adaptation of the novel by Alfred Hitchcock. Like Mr. Rochester, the wife Dimitri falsely claims died years ago is revealed to be alive just before his marriage to another woman.|$|E

500|$|Another great {{passion that}} is {{depicted}} in Traherne's work is his love {{of nature and the}} natural world, frequently displayed in a <b>very</b> <b>Romantic</b> treatment of nature that has been described as characteristically pantheist or panentheist. While Traherne credits a divine source for its creation, his praise of nature seems nothing less than what one would expect to find in Thoreau. Many scholars consider Traherne a writer of the sublime, and in his writing he seems to have tried to reclaim the lost appreciation for the natural world, as well as paying tribute to what he knew of in nature that was more powerful than he was. In this sense Traherne seems to have anticipated the Romantic movement more than 130 years before it actually occurred. There is frequent discussion of man's almost symbiotic relationship with nature, as well as frequent use of [...] "literal setting", that is, an attempt to faithfully reproduce a sense experience from a given moment, a technique later used frequently by William Wordsworth.|$|E
500|$|Sale el Sol is {{considered}} to be Shakira's return to her [...] "roots" [...] and is a [...] "fusion between rock and pop heavily influenced from Latino and Colombian music". Shakira said there are three [...] "directions" [...] of Sale el Sol: a romantic one, a [...] "very rock and roll" [...] one, and a [...] "Latino, tropical" [...] one. Explaining the romantic [...] "direction" [...] of the album, she said that it was something [...] "which I hadn't tapped into for the past three years, but it suddenly came to me and I couldn't hold it back. So it’s [...] got songs that are very intense, <b>very</b> <b>romantic</b> [...] ". Examples include ballads like [...] "Antes de las Seis" [...] ("Before Six O'Clock") and [...] "Lo Que Mas" [...] ("The Most"); in the former Shakira delivers [...] "sad, emotional, and heartfelt vocals," [...] while in the latter she sings over a piano and string-supplemented melody. About the rock and roll [...] "direction" [...] of the album, Shakira said [...] "I started my career as a rock artist and then I kind of crossed over into pop, so it’s been fun to re-encounter that side of my artistic personality".|$|E
500|$|The {{recording}} {{was generally}} acclaimed by music critics. Kevin Apaza, writing for Direct Lyrics, called the song [...] "catchy and [...] "super infectious", suggesting that [...] "if promoted correctly '1.000.000' can slay European, and US charts." [...] He went on praising its chorus for being [...] "too cute", and labelling the recording as being [...] "so simple, so generic, but so {{fire at the}} same time." [...] Although Romanian music website Utv felt that the refrain's lyrics were [...] "repetitive and monosyllabic", they acclaimed the track's rhythm and stated, [...] "Moreover, Alexandra Stan accustomed us that once she releases a new single, this must {{be different from the}} previous ones." [...] German magazine Klatsch–Tratsch said that [...] "1.000.000" [...] contains [...] "gentle and sometimes quite <b>very</b> <b>romantic</b> tones", while AllMusic's Celeste Rhoads called the recording [...] "addictive" [...] during his review of Saxobeats. German portal Mix1 expected the single to become a hit and awarded it a score 6 out of 8. Music website Digijunkies praised Carlprit's contribution on [...] "1.000.000", concluding that the recording is [...] "supple on the dance floor and affectionate in the ear canal." [...] In a mixed review for Saxobeats, Yam Magazine declared that the single [...] "stands out for sounding different {{than the rest of the}} tracks [...] and Stan expresses herself well in the genre." ...|$|E

500|$|The Hallucination version {{had only}} a basic story concept, having dropped the {{previous}} scenario penned by Noboru Sugimura of Flagship. In 2012, [...] scenario writer Yasuhisa Kawamura said {{he was responsible for}} this version, as he wanted to make Biohazard 4 scarier [...] "and suggested using a particular scene from the film Lost Souls, where the main character [...] suddenly finds herself in a derelict building with a killer on the loose. An arranged version of this idea eventually turned into Hook Man. The idea went through several iterations as Mr. Sugimura and I carefully refined this world (which, I have to say, was <b>very</b> <b>romantic).</b> Leon infiltrates the castle of Spencer seeking the truth, while inside a laboratory located deep within, a young girl wakes up. Accompanied by a B.O.W. [...] dog, the two start to make their way up the castle. Unfortunately, there were many obstacles that needed to be overcome and the cost of development was deemed too expensive." [...] Kawamura added he was very sorry and [...] "even ashamed" [...] that Mikami had to step in and scrap this version. After this attempt, the last canceled revision featured classic zombies again. However, it was discontinued after few months, and before it was ever shown to the public, as the developers felt it was too formulaic.|$|E
500|$|Goldsmith was {{influenced}} by the style of the romantic, sweeping music of Star Wars. [...] "When you stop and think about it, space is a <b>very</b> <b>romantic</b> thought. It is, to me, like the Old West, we’re up in the universe. It’s about discovery and new life [...] it’s really the basic premise of Star Trek," [...] he said. Goldsmith's initial bombastic main theme reminded Ramsay and Wise of sailing ships. Unable to articulate what he felt was wrong with the piece, Wise recommended writing an entirely different piece. Although irked by the rejection, Goldsmith consented to re-work his initial ideas. The rewriting of the theme required changes to several sequences Goldsmith had scored without writing a main title piece. The approach of Kirk and Scott to the drydocked Enterprise by shuttle lasted a ponderous five minutes due to the effect shots coming in late and unedited, requiring Goldsmith to maintain interest with a revised and developed cue. Star Trek: The Motion Picture is the only Star Trek film to have a true overture, using [...] "Ilia's Theme" [...] (later re-recorded - as a lyrical version - by Shaun Cassidy as [...] "A Star Beyond Time" [...] with lyrics by Larry Kusik) in this role, most noticeably in the [...] "Director's Edition" [...] DVD release. Star Trek and The Black Hole were the only feature films to use an overture from the end of 1979 until 2000 (with Lars von Trier's Dancer in the Dark).|$|E
500|$|On April 17, 2011, Gaga {{performed}} [...] "Judas" [...] at {{a nightclub}} called Kennedy Lounge, in Tampa, Florida, after her Monster Ball {{show in the}} city's St. Pete Times Forum. Gaga performed [...] "Judas" [...] live on television {{for the first time}} on Ellen on April 28, 2011. She was accompanied by a string of male dancers, wearing black monk-like garments, by her side. The song was performed as a dance-filled number, with Gaga singing the lines while wearing a blue latex ensemble. According to James Dinh from MTV, the [...] "choreography [...] seemingly more difficult than in her usual performances, the singer showcased her best high-energy moves." [...] As the music came to a close, she struck a pose before planting a kiss on the cheek of DeGeneres, who playfully replicated her stance. At the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, Gaga sang the song for French television show Le Grand Journal. Wearing a gold-embellished ensemble, a red hood and a black-and-white hairstyle, Gaga performed an energetic version of the song accompanied by her male dancers, on a stage in front of the Mediterranean Sea. She explained to host Michel Denisot that the inspiration behind her look was the religious imagery and fashion portrayed in the [...] "Judas" [...] music video. [...] "I've been wearing <b>very</b> <b>romantic,</b> very biblical arrangements, and I always throw in some punk rock for good measure," [...] Gaga added.|$|E

2500|$|Garvey {{split up}} with his {{long-term}} girlfriend, journalist and novelist Emma Jane Unsworth, during {{the making of the}} album, which led him to revise some of the album's lyrics.

So that's <b>very</b> <b>romantic,</b> but something I'm fond of doing, when I'm offering a huge romantic gesture, is to point out the realities as well." [...] After the break-up, he said that the song [...] "was about this mythical mix of ex-girlfriends, it's really about her, it's this prophetic thing. I added some lyrics at the end, about imagining her going on and having a family without me, which is tough to swallow." ...|$|E
50|$|One {{thing which}} might have been {{different}} from other sections of German society is the following: The Youth Movement was <b>very</b> idealistic, <b>romantic</b> and moral.

2500|$|It {{has been}} alleged that Béla Bartók quoted the march {{theme of the}} first {{movement}} in the [...] "Intermezzo Interotto" [...] of his Concerto for Orchestra {{in response to the}} Hungarian composer's frustration about the positive reception of the piece. The quotation is clearly the [...] "invasion" [...] theme, {{and the manner in which}} it is presented seems very much a parody. Bartók interjects his <b>very</b> <b>romantic</b> and lyrical melody in the movement with a much slower, dimwitted interpretation of Shostakovich's invasion ostinato. The resemblance has been variously interpreted by later commentators as an accusation of tastelessness, as a commentary on the symphony's over-popularity in Bartók's eyes, and as an acknowledgement of the position of the artist in a totalitarian society. However, it is much more likely that Bartók (as his pianist friend György Sándor has said) was, like Shostakovich, parodying the very popular Lehár theme directly. This view has been confirmed by Bartók's son Peter, in his book [...] "My father": Bartók had respect and admiration for Shostakovich's works, and was mocking Lehár's music and behind it the Nazis.|$|E

Josephine first met John [...] "Johnny" [...] Harris Behan at the ranch house, who she described as, [...] "young and darkly handsome, with merry black eyes and an engaging smile.

2500|$|Vrelo Ibra ( [...] ; [...] ) is {{the spring}} of the River Ibar located in the {{north-east}} region of Montenegro in Rožaje. [...] It {{is one of the}} top natural landmarks in Rožaje. It is located 10km away from the city center on the northern side at the foot of the mountain Hajla in a dense conifer forest. Rožaje has a big amount of springs, but the strongest one is {{the spring of}} the river Ibar [...] which is also the longest Montenegrin river. The road to the spring has beautiful landscapes with a lot of places suitable for picnic or sport activities (such as mountain biking) or other recreation. The road which needs only to be followed to the spring is located in Suho Polje a few kilometers from the city center of Rožaje on Ibarska magistrala in the direction to Berane, on the left side over the bridge next to the hotel Aldi. The road to the Vrelo Ibra is suitable for going by foot or by any vehicle. The strongest recommendation of the turistic organization of Rožaje is to go with a bike. Near the spring is located the main turistic mountain house in Bandžov. The length of the road to Vrelo Ibra is 12km from the place Suho Polje in Rožaje. In the upper course of the river Ibar, which can be followed on the main road to the spring, can be found a lot of brown trout, and in the downstream part of the present chub, carp and whitefish. Vrelo Ibra is a <b>very</b> <b>romantic</b> place which potentials are still not fully valorized.|$|E
