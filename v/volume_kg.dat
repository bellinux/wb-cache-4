40|$|Local cooling, or {{cryotherapy}} can induce an ergogenic effect during {{short term}} intense exercise. One proposed method of personal cooling involves heat extraction from the palm using a device called the Rapid Thermal Exchanger (RTX). PURPOSE: In {{this study we}} hypothesized that local palm cooling during rest intervals between progressive weight training sets will increase total repetitions and exercise volume in resistance trained subjects in a thermoneutral environment and that local palm heating will have no effect. METHODS: Sixteen male subjects (mean±SD, age = 26 ± 6 yr, height = 178 ± 7 cm, body mass = 81. 5 ± 11. 3 kg, 1 RM Bench press = 123. 5 ± 12. 6 kg, % body fat = 10. 3 ± 5. 4 %, weight training experience = 10 ± 6 yr) performed 4 sets of 85 % 1 RM bench press exercise to fatigue, with 3 min rest intervals. Exercise trials were performed in counterbalanced order on three days, separated by at least 3 days; Thermoneutral (TN), Palm Heating (PH), and Palm Cooling (PC). Heating and cooling were applied using the RTX set to 45 C and 10 C, respectively. Data were analyzed using 2 -way repeated measures ANOVA and Tukey’s post hoc tests. RESULTS: Total exercise <b>volume</b> (<b>kg)</b> during the 4 PC sets (2480 ± 636) {{was significantly higher than}} during TN (1972 ± 632) and PH (2156 ± 668) sets, (p < 0. 01). The RMS of the surface EMG with PC exercise was higher (p < 0. 01), and heart rate and RPE were lower (p < 0. 01 and p < 0. 05, respectively) during PC compared to TN and PH. CONCLUSION: Palm cooling was associated with increased exercise repetitions and exercise volume, possibly related to a delayed central fatigue or to a peripheral counter-irritation effect. These results suggest that palm cooling may enhance training during progressive resistive exercise. Physical Education, Sports, and Exercise ScienceDoctoralUniversity of New Mexico.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 42 - 46) Over {{a period}} of three months of swim training, no significant increase in forced expiratory volume per one second (FEV 1. 0) and residual lung <b>volume</b> per <b>kg.</b> of body weight occurred in human subjects. However, the distance swim group (using long workouts with relatively little rest) showed a significant increase in vital capacity per kg. of body weight over a control group. In contrast, the sprint group showed no such effect using a workout of less distance and more rest. Both the distance and sprint swim groups had greater vital capacities per kg. body weight and higher residual lung volume (using Wilmore's predictive residual volume formula) at both the mid and post seasons than the control group. This suggests that both swim groups might have more buoyancy from internal air than the control group. Single tests done at the postseason only showed no differences between the two swim groups and the control in regards to percent body fat, buoyancy per kg. of body weight, FEV 1. 0 per kg. of fat-free mass, residual <b>volume</b> per <b>kg.</b> of body weight (Helium dilution method). However, using Wilmore's predictive values for residual volumes, the distance swim group had significantly higher values than the control group.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the effects of bodyweight (BW) gain on respiratory function and airway responsiveness in healthy Beagles using barometric whole body plethysmography (BWBP). Six adult dogs were examined before and after a fattening diet. The high-energy diet induced a mean increase in BW of 41 ± 6 %. BWBP basal parameters were recorded prior to airway reactivity testing (using increasing concentrations of histamine nebulisations). An airway responsiveness index (H-Penh 300) was calculated as the histamine concentration necessary to reach 300 % of basal enhanced pause (Penh, bronchoconstriction index). The same dogs underwent a doxapram hydrochloride (Dxp) stimulation testing 2 weeks later. Basal measurements showed that obese dogs had tidal <b>volume</b> per <b>kg</b> (TV/BW) that was significantly decreased whilst respiratory rate (RR) increased significantly. H-Penh 300 decreased significantly in obese Beagles, indicating increased bronchoreactivity. Dxp administration induced {{a significant increase in}} TV/BW, minute <b>volume</b> per <b>kg</b> (MV/BW), peak inspiratory and expiratory flows per kg (PIF/BW and PEF/BW) in both normal and obese dogs although the TV/BW increase was significantly less marked in the obese group. In conclusion, obesity induced changes in basal respiratory parameters, increased bronchoreactivity and a blunted response to Dxp-induced respiratory stimulation. This combination of basal respiratory parameters, bronchoreactivity testing and pharmacological stimulation testing using non-invasive BWBP can help characterize pulmonary function and airway responsiveness in obese dogs.

The western side of the Cascades experiences high levels of precipitation and mild temperatures due to the maritime influence of the Pacific Ocean, while the eastern side lies in the rain shadow of the Cascades and is subject to more continental temperatures and arid conditions. Several tree species have subspecies or varieties adapted to the contrasting climates, including Douglas-fir (Pseudostsuga menziesii), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and the shore pine and lodgepole pine subspecies of Pinus contorta. These species provide a unique opportunity to study adaptations of tree hydraulic architecture to contrasting climates.

Circulatory blood <b>volume</b> per <b>kg</b> body weight obtained by LAWSON'S method was 62. 0 ml, by GREGERSEN'S 72. 2 ml, by GIBSON & EVANS' 76. 0 ml. Circulatory plasma volume by LAWSON'S was 40. 0 ml, by GREGERSEN'S 46. 4 ml, by GIBSON & EVANS' method 49. 0 ml. 2) When circulatory blood volume and circulatory plasma volume changes corresponding to dye volume changes within a range of 0. 202 ∿ 0. 586 mg were studied, within the range 0. 202 ∿ 0. 250 no significant changes were seen. However when the volume of infused dye was increased, the values of circulatory blood volume and plasma volume increased with the increase of volume of infused dye. 3) Dye was infused through jugular vein and blood samples were taken at regular intervals from the opposite jugular vein and right forefoot median vein; the differences by sampling site were studied. It was found in regard to the time course of extinction and the circulatory blood volume and plasma volume obtained from the time course of extinction, that no significant differences were seen by sampling site. 4) From the correlation between circulatory blood volume and circulatory plasma volume and body weight obtained from infused dye volume within a range of 0. 202 ∿ 0. 289 mg per kg body weight by least square method, circulatory blood volume and circulatory plasma <b>volume</b> per <b>kg</b> body weight calculated. 5) One minute values of extinction were calculated by LAWSON's method, by extrapolation to the vertical axis. When extrapolated to the horizontal axis the time of disappearance was obtained. Since an experimental formula can be expressed by least square method when the time of disappearance is calculated by this formula, the time required at its shortest was 7 days and the same at its longest was 260 days. However, in actuality when long term observations were made on plasma dye concentration {{it was found that the}} time of disappearance was 5 ∿ 6 days. 6) When circulatory blood volume was measured, samples were taken at regular intervals; Ht values were measured from part of the samples and their changes were studied. It was noted that besides experimental error, considerable physiological changes occurred. 7) In the measurement of circulatory blood volume by P especially in blood corpuscle method the total blood volume value was 73. 56 ml per kg body weight while by use of total blood method the obtained value was 46. 95 ml; thus the blood corpuscle method showed higher values than total blood method. When the P method and the dye method were compared, it was noted that the values by GREGERSEN'S method were closely approximate to those obtained by the P method. When compared with simultaneous measurement by T- 1824,it was shown that in both circulatory blood volume and circulatory plasma volume, GREGERSEN'S and GIBSON & EVANS' methods showed higher values than those obtained by P method while by LAWSON's method the values were smaller.

We investigated a novel volumetric vest system (FloRight), which measures volume {{changes of the}} respiratory system from changes in the magnetic fields induced by current-carrying coils around the entire chest and abdomen. Using a facemask and ultrasonic flowmeter as comparator, we assessed the validity and repeatability of tidal breathing parameters measured by FloRight in 10 healthy newborn infants during natural sleep. We also assessed {{the effect of a}} facemask on tidal volume and tidal expiratory flow parameters. To assess the ability of the FloRight system to detect disease, we compared the healthy infants with 11 infants suffering from bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Tidal parameters with the FloRight vest corresponded closely with facemask measurements. Mean difference, mask minus vest, for tidal volume was 0. 096 mL (p< 0. 05), with limits of agreement + 4. 5 to - 4. 3 mL. Coefficient of repeatability was similar for mask and vest measurements. Tidal volume measured by FloRight with mask in place (20. 6 mL) was significantly higher than without mask (16. 1 mL), but tidal expiratory flow parameters were not altered.

40|$|Fruit size at {{harvest is}} an {{important}} parameter of table olive yield and quality, and {{is a function of}} the growth of both major tissues, the fleshy mesocarp (pulp) and the endocarp (pit). High crop loads most often reduce both fruit size and the mesocarp-to-endocarp ratio and delay fruit maturity. Less is known quantitatively, however, about the relationships between olive fruit size and source:sink ratios. Thus, the objectives of the present study were to assess the responses of fruit size and tissue parameters to crop load and to obtain source:sink relationships for these parameters. Fruit samples were taken from low, medium, and high crop load treatments in a commercial orchard (cultivar 'Arauco') located in Bañado de los Pantanos, Argentina, at harvest for green table olives in March 2009. Fruit fresh and dry weight, mesocarp weight, and mesocarp-to-endocarp ratio were at least 35 % less in trees with high crop load than those with low crop load. The endocarp showed less response with only a modest reduction of 15 %. At the cellular level, mesocarp cell number decreased with increasing crop load, while cell size was not affected. Additionally, a bilinear relationship was found between individual fruit dry weight and the source:sink ratio (canopy volume:fruit dry weight) with fruit weight increasing linearly up to a threshold of about 0. 8 m 3 of canopy <b>volume</b> per <b>kg</b> of fruit dry weight, above which no further increase occurred. Similar relationships were also obtained for mesocarp and endocarp dry weights versus source:sink ratio.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{premature}} born infants {{red blood}} cell (RBC) transfusions {{have been associated with}} both beneficial and detrimental sequels. Upon RBC transfusion, improvement in cerebral blood flow and oxygenation have been observed, while a more liberal transfusion policy may be associated with a better developmental outcome. The effect of the transfusion volume on long-term outcome is not known. Methods Observational follow-up study of a cohort of extremely premature born infants, treated in 2 neonatal intensive care units using a different transfusion volume (15 ml/kg in Unit A and 20 ml/kg in Unit B). The primary outcome was a composite of post discharge mortality, neuromotor developmental delay, blindness or deafness, evaluated at a mean corrected age (CA) of 24 months related to the transfusion volume/kg bodyweight administered during the postnatal hospital stay. Results Despite the difference in transfusion volume in clinically comparable groups of infants, they received a similar number of transfusions (5. 5 ± 3. 2 versus 5. 5 ± 2. 3 respectively in Unit A and B). The total transfused volume in unit A was 79 ± 47 ml/kg and 108 ± 47 ml/kg in unit B (p = 0. 02). Total transfused RBC <b>volume</b> per <b>kg</b> bodyweight was not an independent predictor of the composite outcome (p = 0. 96, OR 1. 0 (CI 0. 9 - 1. 1). Conclusion There was no relationship between the composite outcome at 24 months CA and transfusion volume received during the post natal hospital stay. As there was no clinical advantage of the higher transfusion volume, a more restrictive volume will reduce total transfusion volume and donor exposure. Future research on the optimal transfusion volume per event to extreme preterm infants should include larger, prospective studies with a longer follow-up period through to childhood or even adolescence. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Using whole genome {{sequence}} data {{might improve}} genomic prediction accuracy, {{when compared with}} high-density SNP arrays, and could lead to identification of casual mutations affecting complex traits. For some traits, the most accurate genomic predictions are achieved with non-linear Bayesian methods. However, {{as the number of}} variants {{and the size of the}} reference population increase, the computational time required to implement these Bayesian methods (typically with Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampling) becomes unfeasibly long. Results: Here, we applied a new method, HyB_BR (for Hybrid BayesR), which implements a mixture model of normal distributions and hybridizes an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm followed by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, to genomic prediction in a large dairy cattle population with imputed whole genome sequence data. The imputed whole genome sequence data included 994, 019 variant genotypes of 16, 214 Holstein and Jersey bulls and cows. Traits included fat yield, milk <b>volume,</b> protein <b>kg,</b> fat% and protein% in milk, as well as fertility and heat tolerance. HyB_BR achieved genomic prediction accuracies as high as the full MCMC implementation of BayesR, both for predicting a validation set of Holstein and Jersey bulls (multi-breed prediction) and a validation set of Australian Red bulls (across-breed prediction). HyB_BR had a ten fold reduction in compute time, compared with the MCMC implementation of BayesR (48 hours versus 594 hours). We also demonstrate that in many cases HyB_BR identified sequence variants with a high posterior probability of affecting the milk production or fertility traits that were similar to those identified in BayesR. For heat tolerance, both HyB_BR and BayesR found variants in or close to promising candidate genes associated with this trait and not detected by previous studies. Conclusions: The results demonstrate that HyB_BR is a feasible method for simultaneous genomic prediction and QTL mapping with whole genome sequence in large reference populations...|$|R

The demand of oil palm seedlings for extensification and replantation increases continuously, and therefore this need to be supported by precise fertilization programs. The objectives of this experiment were to investigate the role of organic fertilizer and to obtain the best organic-NPK fertilizer combination in increasing the effectiveness of the use of NPK fertilizer for the growth of oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) seedling in the main nursery. The experiment was conducted from December 2011 to September 2012 at IPB Teaching Farm Dramaga Bogor. The treatment was arranged in a factorial randomized block design with three replications. The first factor was amount of organic fertilizer consisted of 0 : 6, 1 : 6, 2 : 6, and 3 : 6 of the soil <b>volume</b> (6 <b>kg).</b> The second factor was NPK fertilizer rates, i. e., 0. 0, 127. 5, 255, and 382. 5 g NPK per plant. The results showed that application of organic fertilizer increased the effectiveness of NPK fertilizer and could be a substitute for NPK fertilizer in oil palm seedlings. The best combination treatment was 2 : 6 (organic fertilizer:top soil) and 382. 5 NPK g per plant with effectiveness of 158. 9, 209. 1 and 170. 1 % for plant height, leaf number and stem diameter, respectively. The efficiency of N, P, and K application were 56. 2, 11. 1, and 29. 0 % for the same variables, respectively.

40|$|The NEXT {{experiment}} aims {{to observe}} the neutrinoless double beta decay of ^ 136 Xe in a high pressure gas TPC using electroluminescence (EL) to amplify the signal from ionization. Understanding {{the response of the}} detector is imperative in achieving a consistent and well understood energy measurement. The abundance of xenon k-shell x-ray emission during data taking has been identified as a multitool for the characterisation of the fundamental parameters of the gas as well as the equalisation of the response of the detector. The NEXT-DEMO prototype is a 1. 5 <b>kg</b> <b>volume</b> TPC filled with natural xenon. It employs an array of 19 PMTs as an energy plane and of 256 SiPMs as a tracking plane with the TPC light tube and SiPM surfaces being coated with tetraphenyl butadiene (TPB) which acts as a wavelength shifter for the VUV scintillation light produced by xenon. This paper presents the measurement of the properties of the drift of electrons in the TPC, the effects of the EL production region, and the extraction of position dependent correction constants using K_α X-ray deposits. These constants were used to equalise the response of the detector to deposits left by gammas from ^ 22 Na...|$|R

40|$|Both acute lung {{injury and}} acute kidney injury (AKI) are {{frequent}} and serious problems {{in intensive care}} medicine. Therefore, the avoiding of any iatrogenic insult to these organs is of great importance. While an increasing body of evidence suggests that mechanical ventilation is capable of inducing lung and distant organ injury, the complex underlying molecular mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. In the previous issue of Critical Care, Vaschetto and colleagues reported {{the results of an}} experimental study designed to further explore pathways linking injurious ventilation with AKI. The authors demonstrated that scavenging of peroxynitrite or inhibiting poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) afforded protection against AKI induced by double-hit lung injury. Although PARP inhibition or peroxynitrite detoxification or both may become viable candidates for a protective strategy in this setting, the implementation of a lung-protective ventilatory strategy remains the only clinical tool to mitigate the lung biotrauma and its systemic consequences. In the previous issue of Critical Care, Vaschetto and colleagues [1] sought to determine whether and by which mechanism(s) the activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) contributes to the acute kidney injury (AKI) induced by injurious mechanical ventilation (MV). The authors used a double-hit rat model of acute lung injury comprising lipopolysaccharide-induced lung inflammation and MV with either very high tidal <b>volume</b> (19 mL/ <b>kg,</b> zero positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP]) or low tidal volume (6 mL/kg, PEEP 5 cm H 2 O).

40|$|Background: We {{hypothesized}} that gallbladder (GB) volume {{is affected by}} serial changes during the early infancy period in extremely premature infants. Methods: We conducted a prospective study of extremely premature infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of Fukushima Medical University Hospital, Fukushima City, Japan between January 2014 and December 2015. GB volume was measured by an abdominal ultrasound ellipsoid method between Day 0 and Day 56 after birth within 60  minutes before enteral feeding. We calculated GB <b>volume</b> (mL) /weight (<b>kg),</b> which was evaluated as GV/W. Results: In total, 30 infants were included. The median gestational age of the infants was 26  weeks 5  days (range, 23  weeks 1 day– 28 weeks 6  days), and the median birth weight was 731  g (range, 398 – 1220  g). The detection rate of GB decreased in the infants over time; the rates were > 93 % between Day 0 and Day 7 and < 77 % between Day 10 and Day 56 after birth. GV/W decreased in the infants over time. The median GV/W values were 0. 18 (range, 0. 05 – 0. 59) in infants on admission and constantly <  0. 05 in those between Day 10 and Day 56 after birth. There was no correlation of GV/W with clinical variables after birth. Conclusion: It is considered that GB volume is not affected by serial changes without nonfavorable course of enteral nutrition...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a feasibility study conducted {{to evaluate the}} possibility of applying an helicon-double-layer plasma-thruster on UNISAT-class micro-satellite. UNISAT satellites are designed, built and operate in orbit by students, researchers and professors of GAUSS. In the framework of this program four satellite have already been launched (2 years apart one from the other, starting in 2000) by the Baykonour Cosmodrome and a fifth satellite {{is scheduled to be}} launched in the 2008. Helicon double layer thruster is an innovative type of plasma thruster firstly proposed by Australian National University (ANU) based on helicon plasma source and Double-layer effect. The paper firstly presents the analysis conducted at GAUSS (Group of Astrodynamics of University "La Sapienza"of Rome) on UNISAT in order to evaluate the available mass budget, volume budget and power budget. Moreover, the minimum required thruster-performances which can be measured using the available instrumentation onboard UNISAT have been assessed. The main requirements of the propulsion system are: thrust 1 mN, specific impulse higher than 1000 s, weight lower than 2 <b>kg,</b> <b>volume</b> lower than 1 dm 3. Then the thruster has been designed firstly applying a global-model of the helicon source and 1 -D PIC code operated by a genetic algorithms in order to identify the best optimum thruster configuration (respect to system requirements, constrains and performances) and finally using a 2 -D PIC code in order to verify and refine thruster performances.
