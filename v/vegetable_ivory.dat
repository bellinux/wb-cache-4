The soil in which they grow here is half pitch pavement, half loose brown earth, and over both, shallow pools of water, which will become much deeper in the wet season; and all about float or lie their pretty fruit, the size of an apple, and scaled like a fir-cone. They are last year's, empty and decayed. The ripe fruit contains first a rich pulpy nut, and at last a hard cone, something like that of the <b>vegetable</b> <b>ivory</b> palm, {159} which grows in the mainland, but not here.

40|$|Characterization {{studies on}} the genetic {{diversity}} among cultivated cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) varieties are valuable tools to optimize the use of available genetic resources by farmers, local communities, researchers and breeders. Eight cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) genotypes (<b>Vegetable</b> cowpea, <b>Ivory</b> grey, Okhalweni, Fahari, Fahari dark, 97 K- 1069 - 8, IT 93 K- 73 h, and 129 - 3) were subjected to molecular, morphological and agronomical characterization. DNA amplification fingerprinting markers were {{used to evaluate the}} genetic diversity among the eight genotypes. Nine random arbitrary primers were used to screen the eight genotypes to assess their ability to reveal polymorphisms in cowpea, and seven of them were selected for use in characterizing the total sample. A total of 43 bands were generated which are all polymorphic. On the average, the primers generated a total of 6. 1 polymorphic bands. The resulting data-matrix included 43 analysed bands with a total of 344 characters. Neighbour joining analysis was used to generate the dendrogram, clustering the genotypes into two groups at an agglomerate coefficient of 0. 30 irrespective of their geographical origins. The results also showed the presence of significant differences in morphological and quality traits among the genotypes. Fahari yielded the highest concentration of crude protein (46. 51 mg/mg dry leaf) while Vegetable cowpea yielded the lowest (24. 41 mg/mg dry leaf). The influence of manure was also found to be effective by increasing the crude protein content of the genotypes as shown by Fahari dark with an average of 53. 53 mg/mg dry leaf as opposed to 39. 85 mg/mg dry leaf without manure application. Although some small clusters grouped accessions of the same growth habits, a general lack of agreement between clustering and morphological features was observed. It can therefore be concluded that the significant differences between the molecular genetic analysis using DAF-PCR markers, morphologic characters and yield traits can be important tools to identify and discriminates the different cowpea genotypes...|$|R
60|$|Now, {{when the}} coco-nut has {{actually}} reached {{the ground at}} last, and proceeds to sprout in the spot where chance (perhaps in the bodily shape of a disappointed monkey) has chosen to cast it, these numerous safeguards and solid envelopes naturally begin to prove decided nuisances to the embryo within. It starts under the great disadvantage of being hermetically sealed within a solid wooden shell, so that no water can possibly get at it to aid it as most other seeds are aided {{in the process of}} germination. Fancy yourself a seed-pea, anxious to sprout, but coated all round with a hard covering of impermeable sealing-wax, and you will be in a position faintly to appreciate the unfortunate predicament of a grower coco-nut. Natural selection, however--that deus ex machinâ of modern science, which can perform such endless wonders, if only you give it time enough to work in and variations enough to work upon--natural selection has come to the rescue of the unhappy plant by leaving it a little hole {{at the top of the}} shell, out of which it can push its feathery green head without difficulty. Everybody knows that if you look at the sharp end of a coco-nut you will see three little brown pits or depressions on its surface. Most people also know that two of these are firmly stopped up (for a reason to which I shall presently recur), but that the third one is only closed by a slight film or very thin shell, which can be easily bored through with a pocket knife, so as to let the milk run off before cracking the shell. So much we have all learnt during our ardent pursuit of natural knowledge on half-holidays in early life. But we probably then failed to observe that just opposite this soft hole lies a small roundish knob, imbedded in the pulp or eatable portion, which knob is in fact the embryo palm or seedling, for whose ultimate benefit the whole arrangement (in brown and green) has been invented. That is very much the way with man: he notices what concerns his own appetite, and omits all the really important parts of the whole subject. We think the use of the hole is to let out the milk; but the nut knows that its real object is to let out the seedling. The knob grows out at last into the young plantlet, and it is by means of the soft hole that it makes its escape through the shell to the air and the sunshine which it seeks without. This brings us really down at last to the true raison d'être for the milk in the coco-nut. As the seed or kernel cannot easily get at much water from outside, it has a good supply of water laid up for it ready beforehand within its own encircling shell. The mother liquid from which the pulp or nutty part has been deposited remains in the centre, as the milk, till the tiny embryo begins to sprout. As soon as it does so, the little knob which was at first so very small enlarges rapidly and absorbs the water, till it grows out into a big spongy cellular mass, which at last almost fills up the entire shell. At the same time, its other end pushes its way out through the soft hole, and then gives birth to a growing bud at the top--the future stem and leaves--and to a number of long threads beneath--the future roots. Meanwhile, the spongy mass inside begins gradually to absorb all the nutty part, using up its oils and starches for the purpose of feeding the young plant above, until it is of an age to expand its leaves to the open tropical sunlight and shift for itself in the struggle for life. It seems at first sight very hard to understand how any tissue so solid as the pulp of coco-nut can be thus softened and absorbed without any visible cause; but in the subtle chemistry of living vegetation such a transformation is comparatively simple and easy to perform. Nature sometimes works much greater miracles than this in the same way: for example, what is called <b>vegetable</b> <b>ivory,</b> a substance so solid that it can be carved or turned only with great difficulty, is really the kernel of another palm-nut, allied to the coco-palm, and its very stony particles are all similarly absorbed during germination by the dissolving power of the young seedling.|$|E

Community involvement in tagua harvesting promises an attractive economic arrangement leading to forest conservation by the local populace. A global antipathy to the trade in elephant ivory has led to renewed interest in the sustainable resource of <b>vegetable</b> <b>ivory.</b> Tagua is becoming sought after for small carvings and for use in jewelry such as watches, earrings, bracelets, and necklaces.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Design)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2015. <b>Vegetable</b> <b>ivory</b> is {{the generic}} term used when {{referring}} to the nut of palm trees. Although their outward appearance varies depending on the variety of the palm, the nuts are all known to be hard, ivory-like in colour and lend themselves to shaping in various forms. The craft-related use of <b>vegetable</b> <b>ivory</b> in Namibia has been limited to carving in the past. The nut, known locally as Makalani seed, is the seed of the Hyphaene Petersiana palm fruit. <b>Vegetable</b> <b>ivory</b> products found globally prove that this non-timber forest product (NTFP) has greater potential than what is currently being explored by Namibian crafters. Similar nuts are found across the globe, including the South American tagua nut. The tagua nut has a pronounced role in the craft-related market place due to its popularity as a sustainable alternative to animal ivory. It has also provided many locals with employment and a stable form of income. Globally, focus has expanded to address the sustainability of the integrity of forest systems, as economic profits {{to be gained from}} timber-producing trees, no longer take sole priority. Rural households are making use of NTFPs as a source of income and often use the money generated from trading as a safety net in times of economic challenges. Developing management strategies for addressing global climate change has become an increasingly important issue influencing forest management around the globe. Participatory forest management is one of the strategies developed for addressing issues arising from global climate change. It is aimed at rural development, by involving locals living in the area, in programmes that involve domestication of indigenous fruit trees. By means of participatory action research (PAR) and co-design sessions, the study looked at expanding the scope of manufacturing techniques used when crafting the Makalani seed. The list of sustainable manufacturing practices generated from the data informed the creation of the crafter’s product. Expanding the range of manufacturing practices feeds into the potential the seed has as an income-generating product. These techniques contribute to the body of knowledge of craft in Namibia by addressing the issue of sustainability by exploring the potential of the Makalani nut as a crafting material as well as a medium of teaching various crafting skills. It also engaged the researcher in contributing towards social upliftment, while allowing crafters to engage in experimenting with new sustainable techniques used globally on similar seeds that could benefit their generating of income. By assessing data gathered in the codesign sessions, recommendations were made towards elevating the Makalani seed from its current craft level to that of a well-used NTFP craft material. The nature of participatory action research required analysing gathered data to feed into a solution for solving a local problem. The study is of a qualitative nature, and involved a case-study of one, a local crafter. Participatory action design was the framework for the research, as both researcher and crafter explored how the Makalani nut lends itself to techniques used on the tagua nut. It is through this lens that the study speaks to the practices of respect and responsibility, {{as well as that of}} sustainability within the parameters of a Namibian contex...|$|E
40|$|Many {{people believe}} that {{tropical}} forest conservation strategies for Latin America should focus on extracting non-timber products.

We found that, until recently, households collecting tagua received payments that barely covered the value of their harvest labor. By contrast, a few firms that slice tagua into disks that are exported to overseas button manufacturers have captured sizable profits. This concentration of economic returns at the top of the domestic marketing chain has been typical of non-timber extraction throughout Latin America. Processing and exporting are becoming more competitive. As a result, producer-level prices are increasing. Nevertheless, our research findings lead us to doubt that collecting non-timber products will save vast tracts of tropical forest. Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|E
40|$|Basketry {{production}} {{is an important}} informal sector activity in the palm savanna of north-central Namibia, particularly for women. This study assesses the comparative impact of utilization by basket makers and browsing livestock in areas of different human and livestock population pressures on the source of weaving fibre, leaves from juvenile individuals of the <b>vegetable</b> <b>ivory</b> palm,Hyphaene petersiana.

Destructive uses of mature individuals such as tapping for palm wine and the cutting of stems for construction purposes are also practised, even though they are forbidden by customary law. Unlike other centres of basket production in southern Africa, the level of leaf utilization for basketry is low and there is potential for greater use of this resource. Despite the unpalatability of this species, a cause for concern, however, is the intensity of browsing by domestic livestock on young palms, which may affect the future structure and viability of the palm population in north-central Namibia. This predicted degradation of a multiple-use species such asH. petersiana represents the gradual erosion of an important buffer against rural poverty, loss of income and reduction in food security...|$|E
