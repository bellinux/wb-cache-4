5|$|The {{evidence}} for auxiliary ranks and pay is scant: even less exists than the patchy {{evidence for}} their legionary counterparts. There {{seems to be}} some consensus, however, that the auxiliary was paid one third of what a legionary received: 300 sesterces a year (400 after the reign of the emperor Commodus). Both auxiliaries and seamen received the <b>viaticum</b> of 300 sesterces, although the various sources differ as to whether auxiliaries and sailors received the retirement bonus known as the honesta missio, or honorable discharge.|$|E
5|$|Anne was ill for 15 {{months after}} the birth of her {{youngest}} son, Edgar. She bore Henrietta in 1669 and Catherine in 1671. Anne never recovered from Catherine's birth. Ill with breast cancer, she died on 31 March 1671. On her deathbed, her two brothers Henry and Laurence tried to bring an Anglican priest to give her communion, but Anne refused and she received <b>viaticum</b> of the Catholic Church. Two days after her death, her embalmed body was interred in the vault of Mary, Queen of Scots, at Westminster Abbey's Henry VII Chapel. In June 1671, Anne's only surviving son Edgar died of natural causes, followed by Catherine in December, leaving Mary and Anne as the Duke of York's heiresses.|$|E
5|$|Innocent {{gave some}} dispensations as the crisis progressed. Monastic {{communities}} {{were allowed to}} celebrate Mass in private from 1209 onwards, and late in 1212 the Holy <b>Viaticum</b> for the dying was authorised. The rules on burials and lay access to churches {{appear to have been}} steadily circumvented, at least unofficially. Although the interdict was a burden to much of the population, it did not result in rebellion against John. By 1213, though, John was increasingly worried about the threat of French invasion. Some contemporary chroniclers suggested that in January Philip II of France had been charged with deposing John on behalf of the papacy, although it appears that Innocent merely prepared secret letters in case Innocent needed to claim the credit if Philip did successfully invade England.|$|E

25|$|In 1692, {{the writer}} had {{published}} a revised {{edition of the}} Contes, although he suffered a severe illness. In that same year, La Fontaine converted to Christianity. A young priest, M. Poucet, tried to persuade him about the impropriety of the Contes and {{it is said that}} the destruction of a new play was demanded and submitted to as a proof of repentance. La Fontaine received the <b>Viaticum,</b> and the following years he continued to write poems and fables.|$|E
25|$|In {{defiance}} of the archbishop, the Abbé Baradère gave him the <b>viaticum,</b> while the rite of extreme unction was administered by the Abbé Guillon, an opponent of the Civil Constitution, without consulting the archbishop or the parish curé. The attitude of the archbishop caused great excitement in Paris, and the government had to take precautions to avoid a repetition of the riots which in the preceding February had led to the sacking {{of the church of}} Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois and the archiepiscopal palace. Grégoire's funeral was held at the church of the Abbaye-aux-Bois. The clergy absented themselves in obedience to the archbishop's orders, but mass was sung by the Abbé Grieu assisted by two clerics, the catafalque being decorated with the episcopal insignia. After the hearse set out from the church the horses were unyoked, and it was pulled by students to the cemetery of Montparnasse, the cortege being followed by a sympathetic crowd of some 20,000 people.|$|E
25|$|The {{reasons for}} the {{reservation}} of the sacrament vary by tradition, but until around 1000 AD the only reason for reserving the sacrament was {{to be taken to}} the ill. homebound, or dying (<b>viaticum).</b> After that devotional practices arose, as for Eucharistic Adoration and for Communion services when a priest is unavailable to celebrate the Eucharist. During the Triduum, the sacrament is taken in procession from the tabernacle, if on the high altar or otherwise in the sanctuary, to the Altar of Repose, and reserved {{from the end of the}} Mass of the Lord's Supper until the Communion Rite on Good Friday (called the Mass of the Pre-Sanctified, since the Eucharistic Prayer and consecration are omitted in the Good Friday celebration); this period is seen by some as symbolic of the time between the Last Supper and the Crucifixion of Jesus. The Blessed Sacrament is then absent from the tabernacle until the end of the first Mass of the Resurrection.|$|E
500|$|Drawing on this metaphorical {{sense of}} [...] "provision {{for the journey}} into death," [...] ecclesiastical Latin {{borrowed}} the term <b>viaticum</b> {{for the form of}} Eucharist that is placed in the mouth of a person who is dying as provision for the soul’s passage to eternal life. The earliest literary evidence of this Christian usage for <b>viaticum</b> appears in Paulinus’s account of the death of Saint Ambrose in 397 AD.|$|E
500|$|In February 1821, Napoleon's health {{began to}} {{deteriorate}} rapidly. He reconciled with the Catholic Church. He died on 5 May 1821, after confession, Extreme Unction and <b>Viaticum</b> {{in the presence}} of Father Ange Vignali. His last words were, [...] "France, l'armée, tête d'armée, Joséphine" [...] ("France, army, head of the army, Joséphine").|$|E
500|$|The phrase [...] "Charon’s obol" [...] as used by archaeologists {{sometimes}} {{can be understood}} as referring to a particular religious rite, but often serves as a kind of shorthand for coinage as grave goods presumed to further the deceased's passage into the afterlife. In Latin, Charon's obol sometimes is called a <b>viaticum,</b> or [...] "sustenance for the journey"; the placement of the coin on the mouth has been explained also as a seal to protect the deceased's soul or to prevent it from returning.|$|E
500|$|In Latin, Charon’s obol is {{sometimes}} called a <b>viaticum,</b> which in everyday usage means [...] "provision for a journey" [...] (from via, [...] "way, road, journey"), encompassing food, money and other supplies. The same word can refer to the living allowance granted to those stripped of their property and condemned to exile, and by metaphorical extension to preparing for death {{at the end of}} life’s journey. Cicero, in his philosophical dialogue On Old Age (44 BC), has the interlocutor Cato the Elder combine two metaphors — nearing the end of a journey, and ripening fruit — in speaking of the approach to death: ...|$|E
500|$|Nothing more {{is heard}} of Siward until 1087, {{the year of}} the death of William the Conqueror. The Chronicle of John of Worcester relates that:On his [...] return [...] fierce {{intestinal}} pains afflicted him, and he got worse from day to day. When, as his illness worsened, he felt the day of his death approaching, he set free his brother, Odo, bishop of Bayeux, earls Morkar and Roger, Siward called Barn, and Wulfnoth, King Harold's brother (whom he had kept in custody since childhood), as well as all he had kept imprisoned either in England or Normandy. Then he handed the English kingdom over to William , and granted the Norman duchy to Robert , who was then exiled in France. In this way, fortified by the holy <b>viaticum,</b> he abandoned both life and kingdom on Thursday, 9 September, after ruling the English kingdom for twenty years, ten months, and twenty-eight days. A similar account is in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, recension E, though specific names are omitted. This unfortunately is also the last notice of Siward in any near-contemporary, reliable source.|$|E
500|$|Dunstan's {{retirement}} at Canterbury {{consisted of}} long hours, both day and night, spent in private prayer, {{as well as}} his regular attendance at Mass and the daily office. He visited the shrines of St Augustine and St Æthelberht, and there are reports of a vision of angels who sang to him heavenly canticles. He worked to improve the spiritual and temporal well-being of his people, to build and restore churches, to establish schools, to judge suits, to defend widows and orphans, to promote peace, and to enforce respect for purity. He practised his crafts, made bells and organs and corrected the books in the cathedral library. He encouraged and protected European scholars who came to England, and was active as a teacher of boys in the cathedral school. On the vigil of Ascension Day 988, it is recorded that a vision of angels warned he would die in three days. On the feast day itself, Dunstan said Mass and preached three times to the people: at the Gospel, at the benediction, and after the Agnus Dei. In this last address, he announced his impending death and wished his congregation well. That afternoon he chose the spot for his tomb, then went to his bed. His strength failed rapidly, and on Saturday morning, 19 May, he caused the clergy to assemble. Mass was celebrated in his presence, then he received Extreme Unction and the <b>Viaticum,</b> and died. Dunstan's final words are reported to have been, [...] "He hath made a remembrance of his wonderful works, being a merciful and gracious Lord: He hath given food to them that fear Him." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{tabernacle}} is {{left empty}} and open. [...] The lamp or candle usually situated {{next to the}} tabernacle denoting the Presence of Christ is put out, and the remaining Eucharistic Hosts consecrated on Holy Thursday are kept elsewhere, usually the sacristy, with a lamp or candle burning before it, so that, in cases {{of the danger of}} death, they may be given as <b>viaticum.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "last rites" [...] {{refers to}} {{administration}} to a dying person {{not only of}} this sacrament but also of Penance and Holy Communion, the last of which, when administered in such circumstances, is known as [...] "Viaticum", a word whose original meaning in Latin was [...] "provision for the journey". The normal order of administration is: first Penance (if the dying person is physically unable to confess, absolution, conditional {{on the existence of}} contrition, is given); next, Anointing; finally, <b>Viaticum</b> (if the person can receive it).|$|E
2500|$|A story [...] from Amsterdam, 1345, {{claims that}} a priest {{was called to}} {{administer}} <b>Viaticum</b> to a dying man. He told the family that if the man threw up, they were to take the contents and {{throw it in the}} fire. The man threw up, and the family did what the priest had advised them to do. The next morning, one of the women went to rake the fire and noticed the Host sitting on the grate, unscathed and surrounded by a light. It has apparently passed through both the man's digestive system and the fire unscathed. [...] The story is commemorated with an annual silent procession through central Amsterdam.|$|E
2500|$|Don Bosco narrates {{that before}} {{he came to the}} Oratory, Dominic made his Confession and took Communion once a month. After hearing a homily on the Sacraments, he chose a priest as his regular Confessor, (to whom Dominic made his Confessions until the end of his stay at the Oratory). The {{regularity}} with which Dominic approached the sacraments increased and, {{at the end of that}} year, as per the advice of his confessor, Dominic was taking Communion daily. He had a special intention for the Eucharist each day of the week. [...] John Bosco notes that, whenever permitted, Dominic eagerly accompanied the priest when he took the <b>Viaticum,</b> and that he also kept the habit of kneeling down in the street if he encountered the Eucharist being carried by a priest, as was the custom in Catholic countries.|$|E

60|$|We left Bathurst {{more than}} ever {{convinced}} that the sooner {{we got rid of}} the wretched station, miscalled a colony, the better. It still supplies hides from the tipper country, ivory, bees'-wax, and a little gold. The precious metal is found, they say, in the red clay hills near Macarthy's Island; but the quality is not pure, nor is the quantity sufficient to pay labour. The Mandengas, locally called 'gold strangers,' manage the traffic with the interior, probably the still mysterious range called the 'Kong Mountains.' They are armed with knives, sabres, and muskets; and for <b>viaticum</b> they carry rude rings of pure gold, which, I am told, are considered more valuable than the dust.|$|E
6000|$|Byfield {{produced}} {{from one of}} the lockers a pork pie and a bottle of sherry (the <b>viaticum</b> in choice and assortment almost explained the man) and we sat down to the repast. Dalmahoy's tongue ran like a brook. He addressed Mr. Sheepshanks with light-hearted impartiality as Philip's royal son, as the Man of Ross, as the divine Clarinda. He elected him Professor of Marital Diplomacy to the University of Cramond. He passed the bottle and called on him for a toast, a song--"Oblige me, Sheepshanks, by making the welkin ring." [...] Mr. Sheepshanks beamed, and gave us a sentiment instead. The little man was enjoying himself amazingly. [...] "Fund of spirits your friend has, to be sure, sir--quite a fund." ...|$|E
60|$|As for {{the fear}} of Gehenna, again, after he dies: that is too dim and distant; too unlike {{anything}} which he has seen in this life (now that the tortures and Autos da fe of the middle age have disappeared) to frighten him very severely, except in rare moments, when his imagination is highly excited. And even then, he can--in practice he does--look forward to 'making his peace with God' as it is called, at last, and fulfilling Baalam's wish of dying {{the death of the}} righteous, after living the life of the wicked. He knows well, too, that when that day comes, he can find--alas! that it should be so--priests and preachers in plenty, of some communion or other, who will give him his <b>viaticum,</b> and bid him depart in peace to that God, who has said that there is no peace to the wicked.|$|E
60|$|In 1877 Mr. Gladstone penned {{words to}} which later events gave an only too {{striking}} verification. “Territorial questions,” he said, “are {{not to be}} disposed of by arbitrary limits; we cannot enjoy the luxury of taking Egyptian soil by pinches. We may seize an Aden and a Perim, where is no already formed community of inhabitants, and circumscribe a tract at will. But our first site in Egypt, be it by larceny or be it by emption, will be the almost certain egg of a North African empire, that will grow and grow until another Victoria and another Albert, titles of the lake-sources of the White Nile, come within our borders; and till we finally join hands across the equator with Natal and Cape Town, {{to say nothing of}} the Transvaal and the Orange River on the south, or of Abyssinia or Zanzibar to be swallowed by way of <b>viaticum</b> on our journey.”(45) It was one of the ironies in which every active statesman’s life abounds, that the author of that forecast should have been fated to take his country over its first marches towards this uncoveted destination.|$|E
60|$|It {{is a deep}} question. For, if administered, if so much as spoken of, must not, on {{the very}} {{threshold}} of the business, Witch Dubarry vanish; hardly to return should Louis even recover? With her vanishes Duke d'Aiguillon and Company, and all their Armida-Palace, as was said; Chaos swallows the whole again, and there is left nothing but a smell of brimstone. But then, on the other hand, what will the Dauphinists and Choiseulists say? Nay what may the royal martyr himself say, should he happen to get deadly worse, without getting delirious? For the present, he still kisses the Dubarry hand; so we, from the ante-room, can note: but afterwards? Doctors' bulletins may run as they are ordered, but it is 'confluent small-pox,'--of which, as is whispered too, the Gatekeepers's once so buxom Daughter lies ill: and Louis XV. {{is not a man}} to be trifled with in his <b>viaticum.</b> Was he not wont to catechise his very girls in the Parc-aux-cerfs, and pray with and for them, that they might preserve their--orthodoxy? (Dulaure, viii. (217), Besenval, &c.) A strange fact, not an unexampled one; for there is no animal so strange as man.|$|E
6000|$|But revelry {{at night}} brings morning headache, {{and we did}} not set out, as agreed, at dawn. By slow degrees the grumbling, {{loitering}} party was mustered. The chiefs were Gidi Mavunga, head guide, and his son Papagayo, a dull quiet body; Chico Mpamba, [...] "French landlord" [...] of Banza Nokki, and my interpreter Nchama Chamvu. Fourteen armed moleques carried our hammocks and our little <b>viaticum</b> in the shape of four bottles of present-gin, two costa- finas, (= twenty-four yards of fancy cotton), and fourteen fathoms of satin-stripe, the latter a reserved fund. The boy [...] "Lendo," [...] whose appropriate name means [...] "The Go," [...] bore a burden of his own size all day, and acted as little foot-page at the halt. The [...] "gentlemen" [...] were in full travelling costume. Slung by a thong to the chief guide's left shoulder were a tiger-cat skin, cardamom-sheaths and birds' beaks and claws clustering round a something in shape like the largest German sausage, the whole ruddled with ochre: this charm must not be touched by the herd; a slave-lad, having unwittingly offended, knelt down whilst the wearer applied a dusty big toe between his eyebrows. Papagayo had a bag of grass-cloth and bits of cane, from which protruded strips of leather and scarlet broadcloth.|$|E
60|$|They all turned, leaning {{upon their}} short spears, {{and watched the}} advance of the men of Josselin, as their troop wound its way out from the woodlands. In front rode three heralds with tabards of the ermine of Brittany, blowing loudly upon silver trumpets. Behind them a great man upon a white horse bore the banner of Josselin which carries nine golden torteaus upon a scarlet field. Then came the champions riding two and two, fifteen knights and fifteen squires, each with his pennon displayed. Behind them on a litter was borne an aged priest, the Bishop of Rennes, {{carrying}} in his hands the <b>viaticum</b> and the holy oils that he might give the last aid and comfort of the Church {{to those who were}} dying. The procession was terminated by hundreds of men and women from Josselin, Guegon, and Helleon, and by the entire garrison of the fortress, who came, as the English had done, without their arms. The head of this long column had reached the field before the rear were clear of the wood, but as they arrived the champions picketed their horses on the farther side, behind which their banner was planted and the people lined up until they had inclosed the whole lists with a dense wall of spectators.|$|E
6000|$|The head linguister, who, like [...] "Persian interpreters" [...] to {{commanders in}} chief of India during my clay, could not speak a word of any {{language}} but his own, after clapping hands, congratulated us {{in the name of}} the great king Nekulu; he lives, it appears, in a Banza at some distance to the north or north- east, out of sight of the river, and he cannot be visited without great outlay of gunpowder and strong waters. We returned compliments, and after the usual complications we came to the main point, the [...] "dash." [...] I had privily kept a piece of satin- stripe, and this was produced as the very last of our <b>viaticum.</b> The interpreter, having been assured that we had nothing else to give, retired with his posse to debate; whilst we derided the wild manners of these [...] "bush-folk," [...] who feared to shake hands with us. After an hour or so the council returned, clapped palms, sat clown, grumbled at the gift and gave formal leave to see the Yellala--how the word now jarred in my ears after its abominable repetition! Had these men been told a month before that a white would have paid for permission to visit what they considered common property, they would have refused belief: with characteristic readiness, however, the moment they saw an opportunity of [...] "making money," [...] they treated the novelty as a matter of course.|$|E
6000|$|Peter's, <b>VIATICUM,</b> the Antique Indecency, Friedrich Wilhelm did not grudge to part with; glad to {{purchase}} the Czar's good-will by coin of that kind. Last year, at Havelberg, he had given the Czar an entire Cabinet of Amber Articles, belonging to his late Father. Amber Cabinet, in the lump; and likewise such a Yacht, for shape, splendor and outfit, as probably Holland never launched before;--Yacht also belonging to his late Father, and without value to Friedrich Wilhelm. The old King had got it built in Holland, regardless of expense,--15,000 pounds, they say, perhaps as good as 50,000 pounds now;--and it lay at Potsdam: good for what? Friedrich Wilhelm sent it down the Havel, down the Elbe, silk sailors and all, towards Hamburg and Petersburg, {{with a great deal}} of pleasure. For the Czar, and peace and good-will with the Czar, was of essential value to him. Neither, at any rate, is the Czar a man to take gifts without return. Tall fellows for soldiers: that is always one prime object with Friedrich Wilhelm; for already these Potsdam Guards of his are getting ever more gigantic. Not less an object, though less an ideal or POETIC one (as we once defined), was this other, to find buyers for the Manufactures, new and old, which he was so bent on encouraging. [...] "It is astonishing, what quantities of cloth, of hardware, salt, and all kinds of manufactured articles the Russians buy from us," [...] say the old Books;--"see how our 'Russian Company' flourishes!" [...] In both these objects, not to speak of peace and good-will in general, the Czar is our man.|$|E

Royalists enough, Captains on furlough, burnt-out Seigneurs, may likewise be met with, 'in the Cafe de Valois, and at Meot the Restaurateur's.' There they fan one another into high loyal glow; drink, in such wine as can be procured, confusion to Sansculottism; shew purchased dirks, of an improved structure, made to order; and, greatly daring, dine.

60|$|The {{merchant}} {{lived in}} opulence and splendour, even {{to an extreme}} old age. He had several losses in his trade, according to the chance of things which are depending on the sea; but his friends continually relieved him in his necessities, and gave him wherewithal to set up again. At length, being {{one day at a}} great entertainment, and more gay than ever, having asked for wine, he found the taste of it was bitter. Immediately remembering the prophecy of Father Xavier, he was seized with an inward horror; which beginning from the soul, spread over his body, as if death had been pronounced against him, or the image of death presented to his eyes. Nevertheless, somewhat recovering his spirits, for his farther satisfaction in the point, he desired his fellow-guests at the table to taste the wine out of his glass. All judged it to be excellent, besides himself, who made divers trials of it on his palate. He called for other wines, and another glass; but always found the same bitterness. Then, no longer doubting but that his last hour was coming, after he had made an interior sacrifice of his life to God, he related to the company that prediction, which was now accomplished; and arose from the table with the thoughts of a Christian, who is disposing himself for death. Having distributed his goods betwixt his children and the poor, he went to see his friends, and to give and take the last farewell;--notwithstanding his great age, he was in perfect health. It was thought he doted, and they endeavoured to persuade him out of his melancholy apprehensions. But their arguments prevailed so little on his mind, that he gave orders for his own funeral, and invited his friends to do him the last kind office, of accompanying his corpse to burial. To content him, and to make themselves merry at his folly, they attended him into the church: in their presence he received the <b>viaticum,</b> and the extreme unction, without being sick; afterwards he laid himself upon the bier, and caused them to sing the mass for the dead. The people gathered in a crowd at the strangeness of the report; some drawn by the novelty of the sight, the rest to be eye-witnesses how the prediction of Father Xavier would succeed. Mass being ended, the priest, attended by his inferiors, performed all the ceremonies of the church about the grave, and, at length, sung the last words belonging to a Christian burial over the old man, who was alive, and bore his part in the responses. There now remaining no more to do, the servant of Veglio coming to help his master off the bier, he found him dead. All the assistants were witnesses of the matter of fact, and every one went home full of admiration of God's mercy towards this merchant, who had been so charitable, and blessing the memory of the holy apostle of the Indies.|$|E
