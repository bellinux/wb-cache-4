40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} (RC) {{structures are}} subject to environmental actions a↵ecting their performance, serviceability and safety. Among these actions, chloride ingress leads to corrosion and has been recognized as a critical factor reducing the service life of RC structures. This paper presents a stochastic approach to study the influence of weather conditions and global warming on chloride ingress into concrete. The assessment of chloride ingress is carried out {{on the basis of}} a comprehensive model that couples the e↵ects of convection, chloride binding, concrete aging, temperature and humidity. A simplified model of temperature and humidity including seasonal variations and global warming is also proposed in this work. Three scenarios of global warming are defined based on: gas emissions, global population growth, introduction of new and clean technologies and use of fossil sources of energy. The proposed approach is illustrated by a numerical example where it is found that the climate changes may yield to significant lifetime reductions. These results justify the implementation of countermeasures directed to (1) reduce and/or mitigate the action of global warming on weather and (2) minimize the impact of climate changes on RC structures.

40|$|A {{retaining}} wall {{is one of}} the most important types of retaining structures. It is extensively used in variety of situations such as highway engineering, railway engineering, bridge engineering and irrigation engineering. Reinforced concrete {{retaining wall}}s have a vertical or inclined stem cast with base slab. These are considered suitable up to a height of 6 m. It resists lateral earth pressure by cantilever action of stem, toe slab and heel slab. The tendency of wall to slide forward due to lateral earth pressure should be investigated and a factor of safety of 1. 5 shall be provided against sliding. Cantilever retaining walls are found best up to a height of 6 m. For greater heights earth pressure due to retained fill will be higher due to lever arm effect, higher moments are produced at base, which leads to higher section for stability design as well as structural design. This proves to be an uneconomical design. As an alternative to this, one may go for counter fort retaining wall, which demands greater base area as well as steel. As a solution to this difficulty, a new approach that is to minimize effect of forces coming from retained fill, short reinforced concrete members in the form of cantilever steps are cast along the stem on the retaining face. Addition of these steps would counterbalance the locally appearing forces and will result into lesser moment and shear forces along the stem. Also it will reduce the bending action that is pressure below the base. The objectives of the study are 1) To reduce the stresses on the retaining face of the cantilever retaining wall, it is proposed to introduce <b>reinforced</b> <b>concret...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{proposes a}} {{comparison}} of the environmental impacts calculated with the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology of two on-site small-scale activated sludge total oxidation systems in linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) and <b>vibrated</b> <b>reinforced</b> concrete (VRC). The plants were designed to ensure a treatment capacity of 5, 10, 20 and 30 equivalent inhabitants (PE). The main aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the incidence of construction, disposal and operation phases on the total impacts evaluated with three different methods: ReCiPe 2008, Ecological Footprint and IPCC 2007 100 years. The most significant phase for both treatment lines was the use phase, which contributed more than 80 % to the total impacts. The construction phase was the second most impactful phase with an incidence less than 25 % for both systems and for all the considered impacts assessment methods. The plant in LLDPE was more eco-friendly than that in (VRC). The plant in VRC was always most impactful, even comparing each single phase of the life cycle and for all the treatment capacities taken into consideration. Finally, the obtained results were not dependent on the impact assessment method considered...|$|R

One could suppose that in self-compacting fibre reinforced concrete (SCFRC) fibres orient along the flow due to the wall-effect, the flow direction and the velocity profile in the concrete. To investigate the fresh and hardened characteristics (mechanical properties, orientation and distribution of the fibres) of SCFRC and to relate them to those of traditionally <b>vibrated</b> fibre <b>reinforced</b> concrete (TFRC), a research program is set up.

40|$|Self-compacting fibre {{reinforced}} concrete (SCFRC) combines {{the benefits of}} SCC in the fresh state with an enhanced postcracking performance in the hardened state thanks to the fibres. The main properties of SCFRC in the fresh state {{will be affected by}} the fibres. The beneficial effect of the fibres in the hardened state (i. e. postcracking resistance) will, among other factors, depend on their orientation in the cracked section. One could suppose that fibres orient along the flow due to the effect of the walls and the velocity profile in the concrete flow. To investigate the influence of hooked-end fibres on the fresh and hardened behaviour of SCFRC, a research program is started at the Reyntjens Laboratory, Department of Civil Engineering, K. U. Leuven. The following parameters are investigated: length of the fibre, flow distance of the concrete and type of concrete (SCFRC and traditionally <b>vibrated</b> fibre <b>reinforced</b> concrete (TFRC)). Both the fresh properties of SCFRC and the mechanical characteristics in the hardened state (bending test according to EN 14651 : 2005, orientation analysis by X-ray detection and fibre counting) are determined. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Although a {{great deal}} of work in {{investigating}} the possibility of using linear vibration techniques to detect damage in bridges has been carried out over the past 25 years, there are still some major concerns, such as poor sensitivity of modal parameters to damage, requirement of baseline data, need of measuring excitation force as well as environmental effects. Nonlinearity in the vibration characteristics when the structure is damaged further complicates the problem and causes doubts on the feasibility of applying these techniques on actual structures. Understanding of the nonlinear behaviour is therefore crucial. The aim of the work presented herein is to improve the current understanding of the nonlinear vibration characteristics of reinforced concrete beams and to assess its importance to the subject of structural health monitoring of bridges. These non-linear vibration characteristics were studied by conducting harmonic excitation vibration tests on reinforced concrete beams at various damage levels. In order to detect and characterise the nonlinear behaviour, both linear and nonlinear system identification techniques were used. Results indicated that the responses of the tested beams showed marked softening behaviour and that this non-linear vibration behaviour varied with increasing damage. The restoring force surface technique was applied to the test data and results suggested that cracks in reinforced concrete beams never fully closed in the vibration cycle. Existing phenomenological models suggested by other researchers were investigated and compared with the experimental results. The study confirmed that a bilinear crack model would not be sufficient to replicate the observed <b>vibrating</b> cracked <b>reinforced</b> concrete beams' behaviour. Based on these phenomenological models, an empirical model was derived. Using the empirical crack model proposed, the author suggested a means of estimating the ratio of cracked and uncracked stiffness of a <b>vibrating</b> cracked <b>reinforced</b> concrete beam. The author further suggested a possible routine for structural health monitoring for reinforced concrete beam and stressed that it could be extended for more complicated structures, like bridges. To improve understanding of the nonlinearities in the vibration characteristics, a damage mechanics model of cracked reinforced concrete beam was suggested. Based on strain softening behaviour of concrete material under tensile force, the model is capable of including damage {{in the form of a}} moment rotation relationship over the cracked region. Results from the vibration analysis of the model were compared with experimental data...|$|R
