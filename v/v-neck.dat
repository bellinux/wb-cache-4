25|$|Sheffield United {{have played}} in red and white stripes {{for most of their}} history, but began playing in white shirts and blue shorts. They briefly played in narrow red stripes for the 1890–91 season, before {{returning}} to all white the following year. The stripes returned in the 1892–93 season, with black shorts replacing the blue in 1904. The shirts remained largely unchanged until collars were first removed in 1955, replaced by <b>V-necks</b> until the 1966–67 season (when white socks were also used), and from here on the neck style varied.|$|R
25|$|The current Melbourne club jumper {{consists}} of a red <b>V-neck</b> on a navy blue background, with the AFL logo on the front as well. Due to the ubiquitous nature of their sponsorship deal, the AHG logo features on both {{the front and back}} of the guernsey.|$|E
25|$|The summer service uniform was a two-piece {{green and}} white outfit made of {{washable}} seersucker material. It had two pieces, a skirt and a short-sleeved jacket with a <b>V-neck.</b> The cap was green and decorated with a white cord, buttons were white, chevrons were green, and emblems were bronze.

5000|$|The pair commented in a Rolling Stone {{article that}} {{the song was}} based on an actual event: [...] "A real event that {{actually}} happened. We were 16. This was the first summer that we actually got to hang out a lot. One day we were just really bored: [...] "We love to fish, so let's go fishing." [...] We'd been texting these guys, [...] "Do you want to go fishing with us?" [...] We literally thought it was just fishing, because they had the fishing poles, which they didn't even know how to use, come to find out. So we get there, and they come dressed up in like white <b>v-necks</b> and coral shorts. Just the typical city boy with their Sperry shoes and stuff. So we're like, [...] "You know we're going fishing, right?"" ...|$|R
500|$|A third set of {{alternate}} uniforms {{honoring the}} 1978 Sounds are worn for Thursday home games {{in conjunction with}} Throwback Thursday promotions. The jerseys, similar to those worn by the 1978 team, are white pullover <b>v-necks</b> with bands of red, white, and blue around the neck, with larger bands at the sleeve openings. The word [...] "Sounds" [...] is written across the chest in red-on-blue music note-like script, with the player's number below the team name on the player's left chest in blue block characters surrounded by red. The right sleeve bears the round [...] "Slugger" [...] patch. White pants are worn with blue belts and blue stirrups. The cap is blue with a red brim, displaying an [...] "N" [...] styled like a music note in white, bordered by red. The team wears olive drab jerseys paired with white pants and home caps for all Sunday home games {{as a part of}} Military Sundays. These jerseys have the same [...] "Sounds" [...] wordmark and back numbers as appear on home uniforms, but they are presented in two-tone gray and tan camouflage instead of red. The player's number is located on the front, an American flag appears on the left sleeve, and ribbon honoring military personnel is found on the right sleeve. The team's batting practice cap is solid red with the guitar patch on the front.|$|R
5|$|In {{the period}} {{immediately}} after the war, many teams in Europe were forced to wear unusual kits due to clothing restrictions. England's Oldham Athletic, who had traditionally worn blue and white, spent two seasons playing in red and white shirts borrowed from a local rugby league club, and Scotland's Clyde wore khaki. In the 1950s kits worn by players in southern Europe and South America became much more lightweight, with <b>V-necks</b> replacing collars on shirts and synthetic fabrics replacing heavy natural fibres. The first boots to be cut below the ankle rather than high-topped were introduced by Adidas in 1954. Although they cost {{twice as much as}} existing styles the boots were a huge success and cemented the German company's place in the football market. Around the same time Adidas also developed the first boots with screw-in studs which could be changed according to pitch conditions. Other areas were slower to adopt the new styles – British clubs again resisted change and stuck resolutely to kits little different from those worn before the war, and Eastern European teams continued to wear kits that were deemed old-fashioned elsewhere. The FC Dynamo Moscow team that toured Western Europe in 1945 drew almost as much comment for the players' long baggy shorts as for the quality of their football. With the advent of international competitions such as the European Cup, the southern European style spread {{to the rest of the}} continent and by the end of the decade the heavy shirts and boots of the pre-war years had fallen entirely out of use. The 1960s saw little innovation in kit design, with clubs generally opting for simple colour schemes which looked good under the newly adopted floodlights. Designs from the late 1960s and early 1970s are highly regarded by football fans.|$|R
25|$|Away: The new away kit, which {{represented}} 'Victorious', was {{designed in the}} yellow and navy blue colours worn by Arsenal during {{some of the most}} famous Gunners' away victories, including the FA Cup final in 1971 and 1979 wins, and the title-winning victory at Anfield in 1989. The <b>V-neck</b> shirt featured a yellow body with blue sleeves, blue shorts and blue-and-yellow hooped socks. The away kit was presented by Santi Cazorla.|$|E
25|$|For Test matches, {{the team}} wears Cricket Whites, with an {{optional}} sweater or sweater-vest {{with a green}} and gold <b>V-neck</b> for use in cold weather. The sponsor's (currently Commonwealth Bank for Home Test matches and Qantas for Away Test matches) logo is displayed {{on the right side}} of the chest while the Cricket Australia coat-of-arms is displayed on the left. If the sweater is being worn the coat-of-arms is displayed under the <b>V-neck</b> and the sponsor's logo is again displayed {{on the right side of}} the chest. The baggy green, the Australian cricket cap, is considered an essential part of the cricketing uniform and as a symbol of the national team, with new players being presented with one upon their selection in the team. The helmet also prominently displays the Australian cricketing coat-of-arms. At the end of 2011, ASICS was named the manufacture the whites and limited over uniforms from Adidas, with the ASICS logo being displayed on the shirt and pants. Players may choose any manufacturer for their other gear (bat, pads, shoes, gloves, etc.).|$|E
25|$|Lord Hawke, in {{the early}} days of his captaincy, {{designed}} the white rose badge. Copying the idea from Lancashire, who already had adopted the red rose as a symbol, Hawke designed a rose which, unlike Lancashire's, was not a real flower. He created a rose with eleven petals, to represent the eleven players of the team, based on the hedge rose. Only players who had received their county cap were allowed to wear the badge. It was not until the 1980s it was allowed by the committee to be placed on merchandise as a marketing device. Yorkshire's club colours are dark blue, light blue and gold; these are knitted in bands forming the <b>v-neck</b> of each player's sweater.|$|E
25|$|Male mods {{adopted a}} smooth, {{sophisticated}} look that included tailor-made suits with narrow lapels (sometimes made of mohair), thin ties, button-down collar shirts, wool or cashmere jumpers (crewneck or <b>V-neck),</b> Chelsea or Beatle boots, loafers, Clarks desert boots, bowling shoes, and hairstyles that imitated {{the look of}} French Nouvelle Vague film actors. A few male mods went against gender norms by using eye shadow, eye-pencil or even lipstick. Mods chose scooters over motorbikes partly because they were a symbol of Italian style and because their body panels concealed moving parts and made them less likely to stain clothes with oil or road dust. Many mods wore military parkas while driving scooters {{in order to keep}} their clothes clean.|$|E
25|$|Fashionable {{clothing}} {{in the early}} 1980s included both unisex and gender-specific attire. Widespread fashions {{for women in the}} early 1980s included sweaters (including turtleneck, crew neck, and <b>v-neck</b> varieties); fur-lined puffer jackets; tunics; faux-fur coats; velvet blazers; trench coats (made in both fake and real leather); crop tops; tube tops; knee-length skirts (of no prescribed length, as designers opted for choice); loose, flowy, knee-length dresses (with high-cut and low-cut necklines, varying sleeve lengths, and made in a variety of fabrics including cotton, silk, satin, and polyester); high-waisted loose pants; embroidered jeans; leather pants; and designer jeans. Women's pants of the 1980s were, in general, worn with long inseams – a style carried over from the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|In Test matches, {{the team}} wears cricket whites, with an {{optional}} sweater or sweater-vest {{with a dark}} blue and blue <b>V-neck</b> for use in cold weather, such as Australia, England, and New Zealand tours. The Sri Lankan flag {{is found in the}} left side of chest of the jersey and usually the Test cap number can be seen below the flag. The team's official sponsors have been Dilmah Tea since the 1996s until the 2000s. The sponsor's logo displayed {{on the right side of}} the chest and sleeve with the Sri Lankan Cricket logo deployed on the left in test cricket. Since 2000 to 2010, the sponsors have been changed from Ceylon Tea, Reebok, Mobitel Sri Lanka and Dialog Axiata.|$|E
25|$|A taekwondo student {{typically}} wears {{a uniform}} (dobok 도복), often white but sometimes black (or other colors), with a belt tied around the waist. White uniforms {{are considered the}} traditional color and are encouraged for use at formal ceremonies such as belt tests and promotions. Colored uniforms are often reserved for special teams (such as demonstration teams or leadership teams) or higher-level instructors. There {{are at least two}} major styles of dobok, with the most obvious differences being in the style of jacket: (1) the cross-over front jacket (ITF style), (2) the <b>V-neck</b> or Y-neck jackets (no cross-over) typically worn by Kukkiwon/WT practitioners. White uniforms in the Kukkiwon/WT tradition will typically be white throughout the jacket (black along the collars for dan grades), while ITF-style uniforms are trimmed with a black border along the bottom of the jacket (for dan grades).|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, fashion had {{moved away from}} the unkempt hippie look and overdressed disco style of the late 1970s. Athletic clothes were more popular than jeans during this period, as were more subdued colors. Popular colors were black, white, indigo, forest green, burgundy, and {{different}} shades of browns, tans, and oranges. Velour, velvet, and polyester were popular fabrics used in clothes, especially button-up and <b>v-neck</b> shirts. Looser pants remained popular during this time, being fairly wide but straight, and tighter shirts were especially popular. The general public, at this time, wanted to wear low-maintenance clothing with more basic colors, as the global recession going on at the time kept extravagant clothes out of reach. Also worn were striped tube socks sometimes worn with the top folded over worn with shorts. It was not uncommon to see parents especially fathers wearing these along with their kids.|$|E
25|$|When in the Lower School (Lower 1st (Year 6) to Upper 3rd (Year 9)), boys {{wear the}} {{standard}} school dark blue blazer with the Whitgift crest emblazoned {{on the chest}} pocket; blue shirt with the school crest emblazoned on the breast pocket; charcoal grey trousers; dark blue <b>v-neck</b> jumper with the school crest emblazoned on the chest (optional); black/grey socks and, if in the 1st Form (Years 6 & 7), the 1st Form tie (navy blue body with two yellow stripes running diagonally across the centre, encasing the school crest); or if in the 3rd Form (Years 8 & 9) and or 5th form (Years 10 & 11), the standard school tie with house colours. Students in years 10 and 11 wear {{a white shirt and}} those in the Sixth Form wear black, blue or dark grey suits with the Sixth Form tie. Sixth Form prefects wear the prefect tie (navy blue body with alternate diagonal rows of the Whitgift crest and thick royal purple stripes running down the tie).|$|E
500|$|Cinya Burton of E! {{wrote about}} Timberlake's video wardrobe, [...] "Apparently when Justin Timberlake isn't in his now-signature {{suit and tie}} getup, he's donning AllSaints." [...] The singer wore two head-to-toe {{ensembles}} by the brand. The first was a gray Baxley <b>V-neck</b> T-shirt layered under a white Redono half-sleeved shirt, with casual Charge Chino pants. The second, a darker combination worn while he dances against a lighter background, was a black Resident Crew T-shirt, dark gray Pipe Chino pants, a Duncan denim shirt and black Trap boots. According to Burton, [...] "While his ensembles are both dapper", the nude models in the video attracted more attention.|$|E
500|$|Richard Burton {{received}} his third Tony Award nomination {{when he played}} his second Hamlet, his first under John Gielgud's direction, in 1964 in a production that holds {{the record for the}} longest run of the play in Broadway history (137 performances). The performance was set on a bare stage, conceived to appear like a dress rehearsal, with Burton in a black <b>v-neck</b> sweater, and Gielgud himself tape-recorded the voice for the ghost (which appeared as a looming shadow). It was immortalised both on record and on a film that played in US theatres for a week in 1964 as well as being the subject of books written by cast members William Redfield and Richard L. Sterne.|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé {{said that}} the wedding dress she wears in the video was a Baracci one, which she saw in a shop window {{a year ago when}} she was at the 52nd Grammy Awards.

Beyoncé also wears a tiara designed by Lorraine Schwartz, who converted it from a necklace. Beyoncé {{said that the}} wedding outfit made her feel [...] "like royalty... like a queen". She added that the music video wedding was more chaotic than her real wedding in 2008, [...] "This may have been a little more crazy, actually. I had to sing at the same time!" [...] The ivory draped <b>V-neck</b> gown which Beyoncé wears in the video was designed by the Chinese-American fashion designer Vera Wang. The video premiered online at 8 pm (EST) on July 7, 2011. It was available for digital download on June 9, 2011.|$|E
500|$|The school's uniform {{up to the}} end of Fifth Form is a white shirt, dark {{or light}} grey {{trousers}} and a single-breasted navy blue school blazer.

500|$|Swift annexed [...] "Today Was a Fairytale" [...] to {{a revised}} set {{list for the}} {{continuation}} of her Fearless Tour in 2010. During the performances, which was the penultimate of each concert, Swift was usually costumed in a black cocktail dress with a <b>v-neck</b> cut and black, leather boots. She performed with a rhinestoned acoustic guitar center-stage as a forest was projected on the stage; concluding the performance, clips from Valentine's Day were depicted and, following its completion, confetti dropped from the ceiling. At the May 22, 2010 concert at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, Jane Stevenson of The Toronto Sun said that Swift wearing a Toronto Maple Leafs jersey [...] "didn't hurt [...] popularity either in this hockey-mad town." [...] Molly Trust of Billboard noted the performance at the tour's final concert on June 5, 2010 at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts [...] "sported a touch of a hometown feel, as Swift literally and figuratively played to the crowd in a Patriots shirt." ...|$|E
500|$|From 1978 to 1986, {{the team}} wore {{pullover}} <b>v-neck</b> jerseys made of white fabric, for home games, gray, for road games, and red or blue, {{for use as}} alternates. Bands of red, white, and blue were worn around the neck, with larger bands at the sleeve openings (the blue jerseys had one white band and two red bands). The word [...] "Sounds" [...] was written across the chest in red-on-blue music note-like script. Numbers, but not names, were sewn {{on the back of}} jerseys. The team's pants were white and also displayed small red, white, and blue stripes down the legs and larger stripes around the waistband. Similar gray pants were worn for road games. Beginning in 1984, numbers were also located on the front of jerseys on the player's left chest, below the team name. The team wore a blue cap with a red brim, displaying an [...] "N" [...] styled like a music note in white, bordered by red; this was the official team cap from 1978 through the mid-1990s.|$|E
500|$|From 1987 to 1998, {{the team}} wore button up jerseys made of white fabric, for home games, and gray, for road games. The {{design of the}} home jerseys {{remained}} mostly {{the same as their}} previous uniforms. The word [...] "Sounds" [...] was still written across the chest in blue music note-like script, with a red border; though, the font was changed briefly from 1987 to 1988. Numbers were present on the front of jerseys below the team name on the player's left chest in blue block characters surrounded by red. The back of the jersey carried the player's number; during some years, names were also present. Road grays had [...] "Nashville" [...] written across the chest and were missing the tri-color bands at both the neck and sleeves. During this time, the team also added a blue mesh <b>v-neck</b> jersey with the red and white guitar swinger logo on the left chest. The wide tri-color stripes were dropped from the pants and were replaced by a blue belt. The Sounds continued to wear the original red-billed blue cap with all uniforms until approximately 1993 when a new cap was introduced. This new all-blue cap added the [...] "Slugger" [...] logo to accompany the [...] "N." [...] The two caps were worn interchangeably through 1998.|$|E
500|$|Crystal Dynamics {{focused on}} believability rather than realism to re-develop the character, posing {{decisions}} around the question, [...] "What could Lara do?", and giving her action more freedom. The designers updated Lara Croft's move set {{to make her}} movements appear more fluid and continuous. The animations were also updated so the character could better interact with environmental objects. The developers introduced a feature that causes the character's skin and clothing to appear wet after swimming and dirty after rolling on the ground. Responding to criticism directed at the character controls in Angel of Darkness, Crystal Dynamics redesigned the character's control scheme to provide what it felt was the best third-person action experience. The developers also introduced close-quarter melee manoeuvres. Crystal Dynamics updated the character model to add more realism, but retained past design elements. The polygon count increased to over 9,800. More {{attention was paid to}} the character's lip synching and facial expressions to allow for dynamic emotional responses to in-game events. In redesigning the character's appearance, Crystal Dynamics updated Croft's hairstyle, wardrobe, and accessories. Her shirt was changed to a <b>V-neck</b> crop top, her body was given more muscle tone, and her hair braid was switched to a pony tail. The voice actor for Lara Croft was initially rumoured to be Rachel Weisz, but the role was eventually given to Keeley Hawes. Crystal Dynamics retained the design changes for the next game, Tomb Raider: Anniversary, a remake of the first game. The designers aimed to portray Croft with more emotional depth, and focused on the character's desire to achieve the end goal of the game, culminating in killing one of the antagonists. The developers used the death to evoke guilt in Croft afterward and illustrate that shooting a person should be a difficult choice.|$|E
2500|$|The club's colours have {{traditionally}} been red and white. In the early years Tikvesh played in red and white striped shirts, [...] but for much of its history they have been playing in red shirts with white collar or white <b>V-neck.</b> [...] In the mid-90s Tikvesh played a couple of seasons in red and white hooped shirts as well.|$|E
2500|$|After {{two seasons}} in the diagonally sashed kit, both {{yielding}} Final Series football, the first season, winning the Grand Final, Puma released {{a new set of}} kits, including, for the first time, an alternative strip, deemed by the club as an [...] "Event" [...] kit. The home kit consisted of the usual orange, with black sides, black arm cuffs and a black <b>V-neck</b> collar, which also had a white piece of round-collared fabric attached, which had 3 centrally based lines, white in the centre, orange on the left and black on the right with white {{on the outside of the}} black and orange lines. The away kit reverted to the white with orange sides, black arm cuffs and a black <b>V-neck</b> collar. As with the home kit, the away kit had an orange piece of collared fabric attached to the collar, which had 3 centrally based lines, orange in the middle with a white stripe on the left and black on the right of the orange stripe with orange on the outside of the black and white lines. The alternative, or [...] "event" [...] strip, was silver with a top left to bottom right, orange diagonal sash. It also had black arm cuffs and a black <b>V-neck</b> collar with the inner silver fabric and the 3 centrally based stripes. Silver stripe in the middle with a black stripe on either side of the silver stripe and silver on the outside of the two black stripes.|$|E
2500|$|Emo fashion was {{originally}} clean-cut and tended towards geek chic. A 2002 Honolulu Advertiser article compared the style to Fred Rogers', noting differences between emo and goth or hip-hop styles: <b>V-neck</b> sweaters, white dress shirts and fitted, cuffed jeans. The [...] Advertiser described emo fashion as sweaters, tight shirts, horn-rimmed glasses (like those worn by Buddy Holly), dyed {{black hair and}} fitted, flat-front jeans.|$|E
2500|$|Popular {{clothing}} {{in the early}} 1980s worn by men includes tracksuits, <b>v-neck</b> sweaters, polyester and velour polo-neck shirts, sports jerseys, straight-leg jeans, jeans rolled {{to show off their}} slouch socks, polyester button-ups, cowboy boots, beanies, and hoodies. Around this time it became acceptable for men to wear sports coats and slacks to places that previously required a suit. In the UK, children's trousers remained flared, but only slightly.|$|E
2500|$|When Sutcliffe was {{stripped}} {{at the police}} station he was wearing an inverted <b>V-neck</b> sweater under his trousers. The sleeves had been pulled over his legs and the <b>V-neck</b> exposed his genital area. The front of the elbows were padded to protect his knees as, presumably, he knelt over his victims' corpses. The sexual implications of this outfit were considered obvious, but it was not made public until the 2003 book, Wicked Beyond Belief: The Hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper, by Michael Bilton was published. After two days of intensive questioning, on the afternoon of 4 January 1981 Sutcliffe suddenly declared he was the Ripper. Over the next day, Sutcliffe calmly described his many attacks. Weeks later he claimed God had told him to murder the women. He displayed emotion only when telling of the killing of his youngest victim, Jayne MacDonald, and when questioned about the murder of Joan Harrison, which he vehemently denied committing. Harrison's murder had been linked to the Ripper killings by the [...] "Wearside Jack" [...] claim, and in 2011, DNA evidence proved it had been committed by convicted sex offender Christopher Smith, who died in 2008.|$|E
