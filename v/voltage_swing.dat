To maintain performance, the threshold voltage of the MOSFET has to be reduced as well. As threshold voltage is reduced, the transistor cannot be switched from complete turn-off to complete turn-on with the limited <b>voltage</b> <b>swing</b> available; the circuit design is a compromise between strong current in the [...] "on" [...] case and low current in the [...] "off" [...] case, and the application determines whether to favor one over the other. Subthreshold leakage (including subthreshold conduction, gate-oxide leakage and reverse-biased junction leakage), which was ignored in the past, now can consume upwards of half of the total power consumption of modern high-performance VLSI chips.|$|E

However, unlike other DCVS gates with cross-coupled inverters, it is fairly robust and relatively insensitive to load imbalances at the output. The salient features of this low-voltage DCSL family are: high speed for high fan-in large stack height NMOS trees, low power due to restricted internal <b>voltage</b> <b>swings</b> and a latching nature which locks out inputs once outputs are evaluated.

50|$|For a good noise performance, a high {{feedback}} resistance should thus be used.

Additional implementation challenges are imposed when analog and mixed signal processing functions must coexist with digital circuits.

The maximum signaling frequency is specified to be 100 MHz, although some applications use higher frequencies.

50|$|A bridge-tied load (BTL), {{also known}} as bridged transformerless and bridged mono, is an output {{configuration}} for audio amplifiers, a form of impedance bridging used mainly in professional audio & car applications. The two channels of a stereo amplifier are fed the same monaural audio signal, with one channel's electrical polarity reversed. A loudspeaker is connected between the two amplifier outputs, bridging the output terminals. This doubles the available <b>voltage</b> <b>swing</b> at the load {{compared with the same}} amplifier used without bridging. The configuration is most often used for subwoofers.|$|E
40|$|Decreasing {{transistor}} {{sizes and}} lower <b>voltage</b> <b>swings</b> cause two distinct problems for communication in integrated circuits. First, decreasing inter-wire spacing increases interline capacitive coupling, which adversely affects transmission energy and delay. Second, lower <b>voltage</b> <b>swings</b> render the transmission susceptible to various noise sources. Coding {{can be used}} to address both these problems. So-called crosstalk-avoidance codes mitigate capacitive coupling, and traditional error-correction codes introduce resilience against channel errors. Unfortunately, crosstalk-avoidance and error-correction codes cannot be combined in a straightforward manner. On the one hand, crosstalk-avoidance encoding followed by error-correction encoding destroys the crosstalk-avoidance property. On the other hand, error-correction encoding followed by crosstalk-avoidance encoding causes the crosstalk-avoidance decoder to fail in the presence of errors. Existing approaches circumvent this difficulty by using additional bus wires to protect the parities generated from the output of the error-correction encoder, and are therefore inefficient. In this work we propose a novel joint crosstalk-avoidance and error-correction coding and decoding scheme that provides higher bus transmission rates compared to existing approaches. Our joint approach carefully embeds the parities such that the crosstalk-avoidance property is preserved. We analyze the rate and minimum distance of the proposed scheme. We also provide a density evolution analysis and predict iterative decoding thresholds for reliable communication under random bus erasures. This density evolution analysis is nonstandard, since the crosstalk-avoidance constraints are inherently nonlinear. Comment: 18 page...|$|R

50|$|In {{practice}} the ideal current source {{is replaced by}} a current mirror, which is less ideal in two ways. First, its AC resistance is large, but not infinite. Second, the mirror requires a small voltage drop to maintain operation (to keep the output transistors of the mirror in active mode). As a result, the current mirror does limit the allowable output <b>voltage</b> <b>swing,</b> but this limitation is much less than for a resistor, and also does not depend upon the choice of bias current, leaving more flexibility than a resistor in designing the circuit.|$|E
50|$|For voltage amplification, {{the range}} of allowed output <b>voltage</b> <b>swing</b> in this {{amplifier}} is tied to voltage gain when a resistor load RC is employed, as in Figure 1. That is, large voltage gain requires large RC, and that in turn implies a large DC voltage drop across RC. For a given supply voltage, the larger this drop, the smaller the transistor VCB and the less output swing is allowed before saturation of the transistor occurs, with resultant distortion of the output signal. To avoid this situation, an active load can be used, for example, a current mirror. If this choice is made, the value of RC in the table above is replaced by the small-signal output resistance of the active load, which is generally at least {{as large as the}} rO of the active transistor in Figure 1. On the other hand, the DC voltage drop across the active load has a fixed low value (the compliance voltage of the active load), much less than the DC voltage drop incurred for comparable gain using a resistor RC. That is, an active load imposes less restriction on the output <b>voltage</b> <b>swing.</b> Notice that active load or not, large AC gain still is coupled to large AC output resistance, which leads to poor voltage division at the output except for large loads RL ≫ Rout.|$|E
50|$|Clamp {{circuits}} {{were also}} used to speed up cutoff transitions. When the transistor is cutoff, the output is similar to an RC circuit that exponentially decays to its final value. As the circuit gets closer to its final value, there is less current available to charge the capacitor, so the rate of approach lessens. To reach 90 percent of the final value takes about 2.3 time constants. Cutoff clamping reduces the output <b>voltage</b> <b>swing</b> but makes the transition faster. Clamping the collector voltage to 63 percent of the final value allows a factor of two speed increase.|$|E
