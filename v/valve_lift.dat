2500|$|<b>Valve</b> <b>lift</b> can be {{expressed}} as an actual dimension in decimal inches or mm. It can also be specified as a ratio between a characteristic diameter and the lift L/D. Most often used is the valve head diameter. Normally engines have an L/D ratio from 0 up {{to a maximum of}} [...]35. For example, a [...] valve would be lifted a maximum of 0.350inch. During flow testing the valve would be set at L/D [...]05 [...]1 [...]15 [...]2 [...]25 [...]3 and readings taken successively. This allows the comparison of efficiencies of ports with other valve sizes, as the <b>valve</b> <b>lift</b> is proportional rather than absolute. For comparison with tests by others the characteristic diameter used to determine lift must be the same.|$|E
2500|$|The {{camshaft}} [...] "lift" [...] is {{the resultant}} net {{rise of the}} valve from its seat. [...] The farther the valve rises from its seat the more airflow can be provided, which is generally more beneficial. [...] Greater lift has some limitations. [...] Firstly, lift {{is limited by the}} increased proximity of the valve head to the piston crown and secondly, greater effort is required to move the valve springs to a higher state of compression. Increased lift can also be limited by lobe clearance in the cylinder head casting. Higher <b>valve</b> <b>lift</b> can have the same effect as increased duration where valve overlap is less desirable.|$|E

2500|$|Cams {{that have}} {{excessive}} <b>valve</b> <b>lift,</b> running at high rpm, can cause {{what is called}} [...] "valve float", where the valve spring tension is insufficient to keep the valve following the cam at its apex. This {{could also be a}} result of a very steep rise of the lobe, where the valve is effectively shot off the end of the cam rather than following the camsâ€™ profile. [...] This is typically what happens when a motor over revs. [...] This is where the engine rpm exceeds the maximum design rpm. [...] The valve train is typically the limiting factor in determining the maximum rpm the engine can maintain either for a prolonged period or temporarily. [...] Sometimes an over rev can cause engine failure when the valves become bent as a result of colliding with the piston crowns.|$|E

50|$|Variable <b>valve</b> <b>lift</b> (VVL) is a {{technology}} which is increasingly used in automotive piston engines. It varies the height that a valve opens, {{in order to}} improve performance, fuel economy or emissions. There are two main types of VVL: discrete, which employs fixed <b>valve</b> <b>lift</b> amounts, and continuous, which is able to vary the amount of lift.

Observation shows that two principal kinds of flow occur in simple flat-seated valves. For small <b>valve</b> <b>lifts,</b> the flow is along the horizontal wall and is therefore deflected 90 degrees, but for greater <b>valve</b> <b>lifts</b> the flow separates and forms a free stream, whose angle of deflection naturally increases with increasing lift.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the airflow through inlet port of a standard production direct injection diesel engine is presented.

The {{results show that the}} velocity field is distributed non-uniformly across the valve gap and around valve periphery. Nonuniformity is more expressed at higher <b>valve</b> <b>lifts.</b> Flow instability in a jet leaving the port (jet flapping) is also evident since the skewness and kurtosis of the velocity probability distribution function depart from the Gaussian form.

40|$|Gas-lifted {{oil wells}} are {{susceptible}} to failure through malfunction of gas <b>lift</b> <b>valves.</b> This {{is a growing concern}} as offshore wells are drilled thousands of meters below the ocean floor in extreme temperature and pressure conditions and repair and monitoring become more difficult. Gas <b>lift</b> <b>valves</b> and oil well systems have been modeled but system failure modes are not well understood. In this paper a quasi-steady-state fluid-mechanical model is constructed to study failure modes and sensitivities of a gas-lifted well system including the reservoir, two-phase flow within the tubing, and gas <b>lift</b> <b>valve</b> geometry. A set of three differential algebraic equations of the system is solved to determine the system state. Gas <b>lift</b> <b>valve,</b> two-phase flow, and reservoir models are validated with well and experimental data. Sensitivity analysis is performed on the model and sensitive parameters are identified. Failure modes of the system and parameter values that lead to failure modes are identified using Monte Carlo simulation. In particular, we find that the failure mode of backflow through the gas <b>lift</b> <b>valve</b> with a leaky check valve is sensitive to small variations in several design parameters.

50|$|VTEC, the {{original}} Honda variable valve control system, originated from REV (Revolution-modulated valve control) introduced on the CBR400 in 1983 known as HYPER VTEC. In the regular four-stroke automobile engine, the {{intake and exhaust}} valves are actuated by lobes on a camshaft. The shape of the lobes determines the timing, lift and duration of each valve. Timing refers to an angle measurement of when a valve is opened or closed {{with respect to the}} piston position (BTDC or ATDC). Lift refers to how much the valve is opened. Duration refers to how long the valve is kept open. Due to the behavior of the working fluid (air and fuel mixture) before and after combustion, which have physical limitations on their flow, as well as their interaction with the ignition spark, the optimal <b>valve</b> timing, <b>lift</b> and duration settings under low RPM engine operations are very different from those under high RPM. Optimal low RPM <b>valve</b> timing <b>lift</b> and duration settings would result in insufficient filling of the cylinder with fuel and air at high RPM, thus greatly limiting engine power output. Conversely, optimal high RPM <b>valve</b> timing <b>lift</b> and duration settings would result in very rough low RPM operation and difficult idling. The ideal engine would have fully variable <b>valve</b> timing, <b>lift</b> and duration, in which the valves would always open at exactly the right point, lift high enough and stay open {{just the right amount of}} time for the engine speed in use.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{documents}} {{the development of}} a fully continuous, hydraulics-based variable valve timing system. This hydraulics based variable valve timing system is capable of controlling an engine <b>valves</b> <b>lift</b> height and infinitely varying the engine <b>valves</b> <b>lift</b> profile. Along with full valve controllability during normal operation, the variable valve timing system is capable of providing the same operation as a classic cam shaft under engine power loss conditions. This is possible due to the rotating hydraulic spool valves coupled to the engines crank shaft, which are used to actuate the engine poppet valves. The main focus of this thesis is to investigate, alter and implement a new iteration of the hydraulic variable valve timing system on a standalone test bench to validate the systems operating principles. The test bench utilizes servo motors to act as an engines crank shaft which runs the rotating hydraulic spool valves and hydraulic pump. This serves as an intermediate step to full engine implementation of the variable valve timing system. The research begins by analyzing the current mechanical spool valve and hydraulic cylinder design for any potential problems that may occur either during assembly or full operation. The basic system equations are presented to give a glimpse into the working principles of the rotary valves. The mechanical, electrical, and hydraulic subsystems are discussed in terms of what was considered during the design and implementation process. Then design changes that were performed on the rotary valve system to overcome any failures. Lastly the resulting data is presented from the current variable valve timing design to verify proper system functionality...|$|R
