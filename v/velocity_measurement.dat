Shear wave <b>velocity</b> <b>measurement</b> and standard penetration test are generally expensive and are not feasible to be carried out at large number of sites for the purpose of microzonation. Ambient Vibrations measurement (also called Microtremor) has become a popular method for determining the dynamic properties of soil strata and is being extensively used for microzonation. Microtremor observations are easy to perform, inexpensive and can be applied to places with low seismicity as well, hence, microtremor measurements can be used conveniently for microzonation.|$|E
25|$|In general {{there are}} two ways to set up a {{transducer}} system to measure the sound velocity in a solid. One is a setup with two or more transducers where one is acting as a transmitter, while the other(s) is acting as a receiver. The sound <b>velocity</b> <b>measurement</b> can then be done by measuring the time between a signal is generated at the transmitter and when it is recorded at the receiver while assuming to know (or measure) the distance the acoustic signal have traveled between the transducers, or conversely to measure the resonance frequency knowing the thickness over which the wave resonate. The other type of setup is often called a pulse-echo system. Here one transducer is placed in the vicinity of the specimen acting both as transmitter and receiver. This requires a reflective interface where the generated signal can be reflected back toward the transducer which then act as a receiver recording the reflected signal. See ultrasonic testing for some measurement systems.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} avoid the {{unstable}} quality of the raw Doppler <b>velocity</b> <b>measurements,</b> the time differenced L 1 carrier phases were substituted for the double differenced Doppler measurements in IMU/GNSS KF. Accordingly, the accuracy of the Doppler <b>velocity</b> <b>measurements</b> is directly related to L 1 carrier phase accuracy. As a result, the variance component estimation of the Doppler <b>velocity</b> <b>measurements</b> is skipped because its variance is easily achieved through error propagation.|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{intraoperative}} use of a new angle-independent ultrasound scan device (EchoFlow [EF]) in measurement of carotid artery velocities after endarterectomy. Specifically, the purpose was to determine the reproducibility of <b>velocity</b> <b>measurements</b> obtained with EF and to compare these <b>measurements</b> with the <b>velocity</b> <b>measurements</b> obtained with duplex ultrasound scan. Methods: <b>Velocity</b> <b>measurements</b> of the common, internal, and external carotid arteries were performed by the operative surgeon with EF in 65 consecutive patients after carotid endarterectomy (36 female, 29 male; mean age, 71 years). Three <b>velocity</b> <b>measurements</b> were obtained from each of the arteries with EF and compared with the <b>velocity</b> <b>measurements</b> obtained with duplex ultrasound scan performed by a radiologist. Results: <b>Velocity</b> <b>measurements</b> obtained with the EF device were reproducible in the common, internal, and external carotid arteries (intrapatient correlation coefficients, 0. 95, 0. 96, and 0. 95, respectively). Seventy-five percent of common, 88 % of internal, and 78 % of external carotid <b>velocity</b> <b>measurements</b> obtained with the angle-independent ultrasound scan device were within 25 cm/s of the velocities measured with duplex ultrasound scan. The mean differences in <b>velocity</b> <b>measurements</b> between EF and duplex scan were − 12 cm/s in the common, − 8 cm/s in the internal, and − 11 cm/s in the external carotid arteries. Differences between the EF device and duplex scan <b>velocity</b> <b>measurements</b> correlated with increasing arterial velocities in each of the three arteries measured (P <. 05). Conclusion: Reproducible measurements of carotid artery velocity may be obtained with a new angle-independent Doppler system after endarterectomy. Most measurements obtained with the EF system are clinically comparable with those obtained with standard duplex ultrasound scan. This novel low-cost device may be useful in the intraoperative assessment of hemodynamic adequacy of carotid endarterectomy. (J Vasc Surg 2003; 37 : 374 - 80. ...|$|R
