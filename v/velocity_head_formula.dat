50|$|The {{pressure}} of a fluid is different when it flows {{than when it}} is not flowing. This is why static pressure and dynamic pressure are never the same in a system in which the fluid is in motion. This pressure difference arises from a change in fluid velocity that produces <b>velocity</b> <b>head,</b> which is a term of the Bernoulli equation that is zero when there is no bulk motion of the fluid. In the picture on the right, the pressure differential is entirely due to the change in <b>velocity</b> <b>head</b> of the fluid, but it can be measured as a pressure head because of the Bernoulli principle. If, on the other hand, we could measure the velocity of the fluid, the pressure head could be calculated from the <b>velocity</b> <b>head.</b> See the Derivations of Bernoulli equation.|$|R

The velocity in the tail race is not taken into account because for a perfect wheel the water would leave with zero energy which requires zero velocity.

40|$|Wave run-up on {{foundations}} {{is a very}} important factor in the design of entrance platforms for offshore wind turbines. When the Horns Reef 1 wind turbine park in Denmark was designed the vertical wave run-up phenomenon was not well known in the. industry, hence not sufficiently considered in the design of Horns Reef 1. As a consequence damage was observed on the platforms. This has been the situation for several sites and design tools for platform loads are lacking. As a consequence a physical model test study was initiated at Aalborg University to clarify wave run-up on cylindrical piles for different values of diameter to water depth ratios (D/h) and different wave heights to water depth ratios (H/h) for both regular and irregular waves. A calculation model is calibrated based on stream function theory for crest kinematics and <b>velocity</b> <b>head</b> stagnation theory. Due to increased velocities close to the pile an empirical factor is included on the <b>velocity</b> <b>head.</b> The evaluation of the calculation model shows that an accurate design rule can be established even in breaking wave conditions. However, calibration of a load model showed that it was necessary to increase the run-up factor on the <b>velocity</b> <b>head</b> by 40 % {{to take into account the}} underestimation of run-up for breaking or nearly breaking waves given that they produce thin run-up wedges and air entrainment, two factors not coped with by the measurement system...|$|R

The benefit of a PKW is an increased discharge capacity, and hence lower free surface heads at the upstream reservoir. During the last years several experimental and numerical research investigations were carried out to analyze discharge coefficients for various PKW types. Therefore, numerical 3 D CFD codes and small-scaled experimental models were used. To identify discharge coefficients the Poleni formula can be used. By measuring the total discharge and the weir head, discharge coefficients can be calculated. But results will be sensitive due to the weir head, because basically the total energy <b>head</b> includes the <b>velocity</b> <b>head.</b> Hence, the position of the measuring point for the weir head and the associated <b>velocity</b> <b>head</b> must be selected carefully.
