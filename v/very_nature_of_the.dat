5|$|The {{aerodynamics}} of a {{wind turbine}} are not straightforward. The air flow at the blades {{is not the}} same as the airflow far away from the turbine. The <b>very</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way in which energy is extracted from the air also causes air to be deflected by the turbine. In addition the aerodynamics of a wind turbine at the rotor surface exhibit phenomena that are rarely seen in other aerodynamic fields. The shape and dimensions of the blades of the wind turbine are determined by the aerodynamic performance required to efficiently extract energy from the wind, and by the strength required to resist the forces on the blade.|$|E

25|$|From late May 1900, {{the first}} {{successes of the}} Boer guerrilla {{strategy}} were at Lindley (where 500 Yeomanry surrendered), and at Heilbron (where a large convoy and its escort were captured) and other skirmishes resulting in 1,500 British casualties in less than ten days. In December 1900, De la Rey and Christiaan Beyers attacked and mauled a British brigade at Nooitgedacht. As {{a result of these}} and other Boer successes, the British, led by Lord Kitchener, mounted three extensive searches for De Wet, but without success. However, the <b>very</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Boer guerrilla war was sporadic, poorly planned, and had little overall long-term objective, with the exception to simply harass the British. This led to a disorganised pattern of scattered engagements throughout the region.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms of an {{ingrown nail}} include pain along {{the margins of}} the nail (caused by hypergranulation that occurs around the {{aforementioned}} margins), worsening of pain when wearing tight footwear, and sensitivity to pressure of any kind, even the weight of bedsheets. Bumping of an affected toe can produce sharp and even excruciating pain as the tissue is punctured further by the nail. By the <b>very</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> condition, ingrown nails become easily infected unless special care is taken early to treat the condition by keeping the area clean. Signs of infection include redness and swelling of the area around the nail, drainage of pus and watery discharge tinged with blood. The main symptom is swelling {{at the base of the}} nail on the ingrowing side (though it may be both sides).|$|E

500|$|Tim Anderson, {{reviewer}} for {{the website}} Bloody-Disgusting.com, disagreed on some points. He found {{the film to}} be cheesy, but very watchable. He praised DeCocteau's pacing of the film and felt the cast of four was [...] "serviceable." [...] He also praised {{the use of a}} real bear. Like other reviewers, was disappointed by the bear not being in the same scenes with the actors though he notes that at least the bear suit used in such scenes was well made. As a whole, he notes that [...] "ridiculous is the <b>very</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Maneater Series. So, I don't fault them for following suit on this production..." [...] and concludes with the remark that Grizzly Rage is [...] "a pretty silly but satisfying little fright flick" [...] and rated it a seven out of ten.|$|E
500|$|Miyazaki's work on Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind was {{inspired}} by a range of works including Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea, Brian Aldiss's Hothouse, Isaac Asimov's Nightfall, and J.R.R Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. Dani Cavallaro also suggests inspiration from The Princess Who Loved Insects folktale, and the works of William Golding. Nausicaä, the character, {{was inspired}} in name and personality, by Homer's Phaeacian princess in the Odyssey. While a connection to Frank Herbert's Dune is often made there is no confirmation apart from the name [...] "Ohmu" [...] being a syllabic rendition of the English [...] "worm". Miyazaki's imagination was sparked by the mercury poisoning of Minamata Bay and how nature responded and thrived in a poisoned environment, using it to create the polluted world of Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind. Ian DeWeese-Boyd agrees, [...] "Her commitment to love and understanding—even to the point of death—transforms the <b>very</b> <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conflict around her and begins to dispel the distorting visions that have brought it about." ...|$|E
