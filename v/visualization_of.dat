5|$|Director David Silverman had {{difficulty}} devising a legible Scrabble {{board for the}} opening scene that would convey {{the idea that the}} Simpsons were only able to devise very simple words. The design of Bart's <b>visualization</b> <b>of</b> the math problem was partially inspired by the art of Saul Steinberg. The increasing appearance of numbers in that sequence derived from Silverman's use of a similar tactic when he had to develop a set design for the play The Adding Machine.|$|E

5|$|The {{presence}} of T. cruzi is diagnostic of Chagas disease. It {{can be detected}} by microscopic examination of fresh anticoagulated blood, or its buffy coat, for motile parasites; or by preparation of thin and thick blood smears stained with Giemsa, for direct <b>visualization</b> <b>of</b> parasites. Microscopically, T. cruzi can be confused with Trypanosoma rangeli, which is not known to be pathogenic in humans. Isolation of T. cruzi can occur by inoculation into mice, by culture in specialized media (for example, NNN, LIT); and by xenodiagnosis, where uninfected Reduviidae bugs are fed on the patient's blood, and their gut contents examined for parasites.|$|E
5|$|Using the <b>visualization</b> <b>of</b> complex {{numbers in}} the complex plane, the {{addition}} has the following geometric interpretation: the sum of two complex numbers A and B, interpreted as points of the complex plane, is the point X obtained by building a parallelogram three of whose vertices are O, A and B. Equivalently, X is the point such that the triangles with vertices O, A, B, and X, B, A, are congruent.|$|E
5|$|In 1854, a Spanish singing teacher named Manuel García (1805–1906) {{became the}} first man to view the {{functioning}} glottis in a living human. In 1858, French pediatrician Eugène Bouchut (1818–1891) developed a new technique for non-surgical orotracheal intubation to bypass laryngeal obstruction resulting from a diphtheria-related pseudomembrane. In 1880, Scottish surgeon William Macewen (1848–1924) reported on his use of orotracheal intubation as an alternative to tracheotomy to allow a patient with glottic edema to breathe, {{as well as in the}} setting of general anesthesia with chloroform. In 1895, Alfred Kirstein (1863–1922) of Berlin first described direct <b>visualization</b> <b>of</b> the vocal cords, using an esophagoscope he had modified for this purpose; he called this device an autoscope.|$|E

An efficient approach inspired by computational linguistics for constructing a linear kernel matrix for the gene expression data is described. <b>Visualizations</b> <b>of</b> the questionnaire data show a cluster of non–fatigued individuals distinct from those suffering from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome that supports the fact that diagnosis is generally made using this kind of data.
