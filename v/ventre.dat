5|$|Grand Teton National Park {{has five}} front-country {{vehicular}} access campgrounds. The largest are the Colter Bay and Gros <b>Ventre</b> campgrounds, {{and each has}} 350campsites which can accommodate large recreational vehicles. Lizard Creek and Signal Mountain campgrounds have 60 and 86campsites respectively, while the smaller Jenny Lake campground has only 49 sites for tent use only. Additionally, full hookups for recreational vehicles are at the concessionaire managed 112campsites at Colter Bay Village and another 100 at Flagg Ranch in the John D. Rockefeller Memorial Parkway. Though all front-country campgrounds are only open from late spring to late fall, primitive winter camping is permitted at Colter Bay near the visitor center.|$|E
5|$|From its {{headwaters}} on Two Ocean Plateau in Yellowstone National Park, the Snake River flows {{north to}} south through the park, entering Jackson Lake near the boundary of Grand Teton National Park and John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway. The Snake River then flows through the spillways of the Jackson Lake Dam and from there southward through Jackson Hole, exiting the park {{just west of the}} Jackson Hole Airport. The largest lakes in the park all drain either directly or by tributary streams into the Snake River. Major tributaries which flow into the Snake River include Pacific Creek and Buffalo Fork near Moran and the Gros <b>Ventre</b> River at the southern border of the park. Through the comparatively level Jackson Hole valley, the Snake River descends an average of , while other streams descending from the mountains to the east and west have higher gradients due to increased slope. The Snake River creates braids and channels in sections where the gradients are lower and in steeper sections, erodes and undercuts the cobblestone terraces once deposited by glaciers.|$|E
5|$|From {{the end of}} the Mesozoic to present, {{the region}} went through a series of uplifts and erosional sequences. Commencing 66million years ago the Laramide orogeny was a period of mountain-building and erosion in western North America that created the ancestral Rocky Mountains. This cycle of uplift and erosion left behind one of the most {{complete}} non-marine Cenozoic rock sequences found in North America. Conglomerate rocks composed of quartzite and interspersed with mudstone and sandstones were deposited during erosion from a now vanished mountain range that existed to the northwest of the current Teton Range. These deposits also have trace quantities of gold and mercury. During the Eocene and Oligocene, volcanic eruptions from the ancestral Absaroka Range buried the region under various volcanic deposits. Sedimentary basins developed in the region due to drop faulting, creating an ancestral Jackson Hole and by the Pliocene (10million years ago), an ancestral Jackson Lake known as Teewinot Lake. During the Quaternary, landslides, erosion and glacial activity deposited soils and rock debris throughout the Snake River valley of Jackson Hole and left behind terminal moraines which impound the current lakes. The most recent example of rapid alteration to the landscape occurred in 1925 just east of the park, when the Gros <b>Ventre</b> landslide was triggered by spring melt from a heavy snowpack as well as heavy rain.|$|E
50|$|In 1832, the Gros <b>Ventres</b> {{made contact}} with the German {{explorer}} and naturalist, Prince Maximilian. Along with the naturalist painter Karl Bodmer, the Europeans painted portraits and recorded their meeting with the Gros <b>Ventres,</b> near the Missouri River in Montana.The Gros <b>Ventres</b> joined the Blackfoot Confederacy. After allying with the Blackfoot, the Gros <b>Ventres</b> moved to north-central Montana and southern Canada. In 1855, Isaac Stevens, Governor of the Washington Territory, concluded a treaty (Stat., L., XI, 657) to provide peace between the United States and the Blackfoot, Flathead and Nez Perce tribes. The Gros <b>Ventres</b> signed the treaty {{as part of the}} Blackfoot Confederacy, whose territory near the Three Fork area became a common hunting ground for the Flathead, Nez Perce, Kootenai, and Crow Indians. A common hunting ground north of the Missouri River on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation included the Assiniboine and Sioux. In 1861, the Gros <b>Ventres</b> left the Blackfoot Confederacy.|$|R
50|$|The Gros <b>Ventres</b> {{acquired}} {{horses in}} the mid-18th century. The earliest known contact of Gros <b>Ventres</b> with whites was around 1754, {{between the north and}} south forks of the Saskatchewan River. Exposure to smallpox severely reduced their numbers about this time. Around 1793, in response to attacks by well-armed Cree and Assiniboines, large groups of Gros <b>Ventres</b> burned two Hudson's Bay Company trading posts that were providing guns to the Cree and Assiniboine tribes in what is now Saskatchewan.|$|R

5|$|The first U.S. Government {{sponsored}} {{expedition to}} enter Jackson Hole was the 1859–60 Raynolds Expedition. Led by U.S. Army Captain William F. Raynolds and guided by mountain man Jim Bridger, it included naturalist F. V. Hayden, who later led other expeditions to the region. The expedition {{had been charged}} with exploring the Yellowstone region, but encountered difficulties crossing mountain passes due to snow. Bridger ended up guiding the expedition south over Union Pass then following the Gros <b>Ventre</b> River drainage to the Snake River and leaving the region over Teton Pass. Organized exploration of the region was halted during the American Civil War but resumed when F. V. Hayden led the well-funded Hayden Geological Survey of 1871. In 1872, Hayden oversaw explorations in Yellowstone, while a branch of his expedition known as the Snake River Division was led by James Stevenson and explored the Teton region. Along with Stevenson was photographer William Henry Jackson who took the first photographs of the Teton Range. The Hayden Geological Survey named many of the mountains and lakes in the region. The explorations by early mountain men and subsequent expeditions failed to identify any sources of economically viable mineral wealth. Nevertheless, small groups of prospectors set up claims and mining operations on several of the creeks and rivers. By 1900 all organized efforts to retrieve minerals had been abandoned.|$|E
25|$|The Gros <b>Ventre</b> were Algonquian-speaking. They had {{originally}} been allies with Blackfoot, also Algonquian-speaking. However, the Gros <b>Ventre</b> later allied with the Assiniboines until the Cree invaded the area. The two struggled to get along and the Gros Ventres began to relocate.|$|E
25|$|The Pennsylvanian System is {{represented}} by the Amsden Formation and the Tensleep Sandstone. Cliffs of the Tensleep Sandstone can be seen along the Gros <b>Ventre</b> River at the east edge of the park. The Amsden, below the Tensleep, consists of red and green shale, sandstone, and thin limestone. The shale is especially weak and slippery when exposed to weathering and saturated with water. These are the strata that make up the glide plane of the Lower Gros <b>Ventre</b> Slide east of the park.|$|E

25|$|Mass wasting {{events such}} as the 1925 Gros <b>Ventre</b> {{landslide}} continue to change the area. On June 22, 1925 an earthquake with an estimated magnitude of 4 weakened {{the side of a mountain}} located three miles (4.8km) outside of the current park's southeastern border. The next day, 50 million cubic yards (38 million cubic meters) of water-saturated Pennsylvanian-aged Tensleep Sandstone slid 1.5 miles (2.4km) from its source on Sheep Mountain and into the Gros <b>Ventre</b> River valley 2,100 feet (640 m) below, damming the river. Stressed by snow melt, the resulting 5 mile (8km) long and 200 feet (60 m) deep lake breached the debris dam on May 18, 1927 and flooded the town of Kelly, Wyoming, killing six.|$|E

5000|$|The battle raged all {{day with}} little gain on either side. As night fell, someone within the Gros <b>Ventres</b> {{barricade}} shouted that they had reinforcements, [...] "many Blackfeet", coming. The trappers somehow understood that Gros <b>Ventres</b> reinforcements were attacking the rendezvous camp ground and goods back at Pierre's Hole, and quickly mounted their horses and raced to Pierre Hole's to save their fellow trappers and wealth. However, no hostile Indians had attacked the remnant of the rendezvous. The following morning, returning trappers found the Gros <b>Ventres</b> fortifications abandoned. Thirty horses found nearby included some that had been previously stolen from Sublette's supply train and two that {{had been taken from}} Thomas Fitzpatrick during his earlier escape from the Blackfeet.|$|R

25|$|Natural dams often pose {{significant}} hazards {{to human}} settlements and infrastructure. The resulting lakes often flood inhabited areas, while a catastrophic {{failure of the}} dam could cause even greater damage, such as the failure of western Wyoming's Gros <b>Ventre</b> landslide dam in 1927, which wiped out the town of Kelly and resulted {{in the deaths of}} six people.|$|E
25|$|By about 34 {{million years}} ago, these forces had uplifted a broad part of western Wyoming into a {{continuous}} high plateau. This region includes areas now {{occupied by the}} Teton Range, Gros <b>Ventre</b> Range, Wind River Mountains and other mountain ranges {{to the south and}} east of the Tetons. A separate area of uplift called the Targhee Uplift formed north of park borders around this time.|$|E

25|$|The {{period of}} uplift that {{resulted}} {{in the formation of the}} ancestral Rocky Mountains is called the Laramide orogeny. Mountains already existed west and southwest of Wyoming, with progressively older mountains (up to Jurassic age) trending west into Nevada.

25|$|As the {{shoreline}} continued to move eastward, the 285-foot-thick (87 m) Death Canyon Limestone Member of the Gros <b>Ventre</b> Formation was {{laid down in}} clear water farther from shore. It consists of two thick beds of dark blue-gray limestone that are separated by 15 to 20 feet (4.5 to 6 m) of shale. The Death Canyon contains abundant fossil of brachiopods and trilobites in some places. Following this the sea retreated to the west for a short time. The 220-foot-thick (67 m) Park Shale Member of the Gros <b>Ventre</b> Formation was deposited in the shallow muddy water resulting from this retreat. It is a gray-green shale that contains beds of platy limestone conglomerate along with fossils of trilobites and brachiopods. Underwater expanses of algae flourished in places on the sea bottom and built extensive reefs. Periodically shoal areas were hit by violent storm waves that tore loose platy fragments of recently solidified limestone and swept them into nearby channels where they were buried and cemented into thin beds of jumbled fragments called 'edgewise' conglomerate. These are widespread in the shale and in overlying and underlying limestone layers.|$|E
25|$|Military {{history of}} Saskatchewan {{includes}} the early conflicts between conflicting First Nations. Prior to European settlement many battles were fought between the Blackfoot, Atsina, Cree, Assiniboine, Saulteaux, Sioux, and Dene. Many place names hearken back to these early conflicts {{such as the}} Battle River: so named due to Cree-Blackfoot fighting in the area. The Blackfoot Confederacy, and Atsina or Gros <b>Ventre</b> were pushed out of Saskatchewan following decades of warfare with the Cree, Saulteaux, and Assiniboine. In the boreal forest conflicts raged between the Woods Cree and Dene or Chipewyan up until the late 19th century.|$|E

50|$|In July 1794, {{following}} their destruction of Manchester House the year before, {{one or two}} hundred Gros <b>Ventres</b> attacked the HBC post. Only two company men were in the fort along {{with a handful of}} Indians. Two company officers, Magnus Annal and Hugh Brough, who were outside the fort were quickly killed. The two men inside barred the gate and hid in a cellar. The Gros <b>Ventres</b> broke in and butchered everyone inside including women and children, except for J. C. Van Dreil who managed to escape in a canoe after hiding in an abandoned cellar for eight hours. They next turned to the NWC post across the river. Duncan McGillivray's journal implies that the NWC people were unaware of what was happening at the HBC fort. An interpreter named Jacques Raphael was out riding and saw the Gros <b>Ventres</b> coming. He raced to the fort and got the men under arms. The first discharge from the fort drove the Indians back. They retired to cover and fired on the fort until they began to run low on ammunition. Their chief, L'Homme de Callumet, tried to lead a charge but was immediately shot by Raphael. The Gros <b>Ventres</b> recovered the chief's body and withdrew. Seeing the impossibility of defense or further trade, Louis Chatelain, the master, loaded all his men and goods on canoes and abandoned the fort.|$|R
50|$|The {{successful}} trapping {{season in}} 1832 concluded {{with the famous}} Battle of Pierre's Hole. As the rendezvous at Pierre’s Hole was breaking up, a group of Gros <b>Ventres</b> (sometimes mistaken as Blackfeet), who had been dogging the trappers as they arrived, bumped into a trapping brigade as it left the valley, sparking a full-fledged battle. The Gros <b>Ventres</b> built quick fortifications out of downed logs as trapper reinforcements arrived, commencing a day-long siege. Between three and twelve trappers were killed, and nine to fifty Gros <b>Ventres.</b> The Natives were able to retreat during the night. Robert, who was interrupted {{in the middle of}} writing a letter to his brother, joined the fighting. Sublette and Robert agreed to dispose of each other’s property, in the event of one’s death. Both men led a charge on the Indian defenses, with Robert at one point believing he had been wounded, and Sublette taking a bullet in the arm. Robert helped Sublette from the field. The Battle of Pierre’s Hole would later be dramatized in Washington Irving’s The Adventures of Captain Bonneville (1837).|$|R
25|$|Mud {{was laid}} {{down on top}} of the Flathead Sandstone as the {{shoreline}} advanced eastward across the Teton area. The resulting soft greenish-gray shale with beds of purple and green sandstone near its base, became the 100 feet (30 m) thick Wolsey Shale Member of the Gros <b>Ventre</b> Formation. Some shale shows patterns of cracks that formed when the accumulating mud was briefly exposed to the air along tidal flats. Small phosphatic-shelled animals called brachiopods inhabited these tidal flats but as far as is known, nothing lived on land. Many shale beds are marked with faint trails and borings of worm-like creatures, and a few contain the remains of tiny trilobites.|$|E
25|$|The {{creation}} of the Métis added {{a new dimension to}} conflicts in what is now Saskatchewan. In addition to violence related to the fur trade between the North West Company and Hudson's Bay Company (which ended with the merger of the two in 1821), the Métis took part in battles with the Sioux and Gros <b>Ventre</b> across the plains. The last battles fought in Saskatchewan, and the last battles fought in what is now Canada occurred in 1885 during the Saskatchewan Rebellion. Although small by global standards this short war {{had a profound effect on}} Canadian French-English relations, and was a defining moment in the history of the West and the Métis.|$|E
25|$|The Anishinaabe, {{also known}} as the Ojibwe or Chippewa, have {{inhabited}} the Lake Superior region for more than 500 years. They were preceded by the Dakota, Fox, Menominee, Noquet and Gros <b>Ventre</b> peoples, whom they pushed out of the area. After the arrival of Europeans, the Anishinaabe found a niche as the middlemen between the French fur traders and other Native peoples. They soon became the dominant Indian nation in the region, forcing out the Dakota Sioux and Fox and winning a victory against the Iroquois west of Sault Ste. Marie in 1662. By the mid-18th century, the Ojibwe occupied all of Lake Superior's shores. For both the Ojibwe and the Dakota, interaction with Europeans during the contact period revolved around the fur trade and related activities.|$|E
