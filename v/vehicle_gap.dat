5000|$|On the 6th April, 1943, in {{the attack}} upon the Wadi Akarit position, the task of {{breaking}} through the enemy minefield and anti-tank ditch to the East of the Roumana feature and of forming the initial bridgehead for a Brigade of the 51st Highland Division was allotted to the Battalion of the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Campbell. The attack had to form up in complete darkness and had to traverse the main offshoot of the Wadi Akarit {{at an angle to}} the line of advance. In spite of heavy machine gun and shell fire {{in the early stages of}} the attack, Lieutenant-Colonel Campbell successfully accomplished this difficult operation, captured at least 600 prisoners and led his Battalion to its objective, having to cross an unswept portion of the enemy minefield in doing so. Later, upon reaching his objective he found that a gap which had been blown by the Royal Engineers in the anti-tank ditch did not correspond with the vehicle lane which had been cleared in the minefield. Realising the vital necessity of quickly establishing a gap for the passage of anti-tank guns, he took personal charge of this operation. It was now broad daylight and, under very heavy machine-gun fire and shell fire, he succeeded in making a personal reconnaissance and in conducting operations which led to the establishing of a <b>vehicle</b> <b>gap.</b> Throughout the day Lieutenant-Colonel Campbell held his position with his Battalion in the face of extremely heavy and constant shell fire, which the enemy was able to bring to bear by direct observation. About 1630 hours determined enemy counter-attacks began to develop, accompanied by tanks. In this phase of the fighting Lieutenant-Colonel Campbell's personality dominated the battle field by a display of valour and utter disregard for personal safety, which could not have been excelled. Realising that it was imperative for the future success of the Army plan to hold the bridgehead his Battalion had captured, he inspired his men by his presence in the forefront of the battle, cheering them on and rallying them as he moved to those points where the fighting was heaviest. When his left forward company was forced to give ground he went forward alone, into a hail of fire and personally reorganised their position, remaining with the company until the attack at this point was held. As reinforcements arrived upon the scene he was seen standing in the open directing the fight under close range fire of enemy infantry and he continued to do so although already painfully wounded in the neck by shell fire. It was not until the battle died down that he allowed his wound to be dressed. Even then, although in great pain, he refused to be evacuated, remaining with his Battalion and continuing to inspire them by his presence on the field. Darkness fell with the Argylls still holding their positions, though many of its officers and men had become casualties. There is no doubt that but for Lieutenant-Colonel Campbell's determination, splendid example of courage and disregard of pain, the bridgehead would have been lost. This officer's gallantry and magnificent leadership when his now tired men were charging the enemy with the bayonet and were fighting them at hand grenade range, are worthy of the highest honour, and can seldom have been surpassed in the long history of the Highland Brigade.|$|E

Because regional emergency vehicles are limited, <b>vehicle</b> <b>gaps</b> will be created in the rescue station after vehicles are dispatched to several accidents, which affects quick response to the subsequent incidents.

40|$|The CICAS-SSA sign is a {{roadside}} driver support {{system that is}} intended to improve gap rejection at rural stopcontrolled intersections. The CICAS-SSA system tracks vehicle locations on a major roadway and then displays a message to a driver on the minor road via an active LED icon-based sign. The basis of this sign is a âDivided Highwayâ sign that is commonly presented in traffic environments. Overlaid on the roadways of the sign are yellow or red icons that represent approaching vehicles that are at a distance at which the driver on the minor road should proceed with caution or at a distance that is considered unsafe to enter the intersection. Previous research conducted in a driving simulation environment indicated potentially beneficial changes in driver decision-making relative to approaching <b>vehicle</b> <b>gap</b> sizes and indicated that drivers perceive the system as being both useful and satisfying. While simulation-based evaluations provide a wealth of useful information, their ability to replicate the full array of behavioral, cognitive, and perceptual elements of a driving environment do have some limitations. It is because of these limitations that {{it is useful to}} confirm simulation-based findings in a real-world environment. The primary goal of the current work was to evaluate the candidate CICAS-SSA sign in a real-world setting to confirm previously identified benefits and identify any unintended consequences of sign usage.

The overall (IDS) research plan was constructed to explore the requirements, tradeoffs assessment, and technology investigations necessary to define a Cooperative Intersection Collision Avoidance System. This report is the third report on the California PATH IDS research, and it focuses on two human factors studies which used the PATH instrumented Ford Taurus research vehicle to study driver behavior while making left turns. The goal of the first study was to observe drivers? intersection approaches and left-turn maneuvers in a mostly naturalistic setting.

The goal of the second study at the California PATH Richmond Field Station (RFS) instrumented intersection was twofold. First, left-turn gap (or lag) acceptance was examined in an environment where gaps could be more accurately measured and tightly controlled. Second, the study introduced drivers to the concept of a left-turn Driver Infrastructure Interface (DII), a dynamic, no-left-turn sign, warning sign. Twenty drivers (both male and female and younger and older) were recruited to drive the instrumented vehicle through the RFS intersection 54 times with a single oncoming vehicle approaching.

The main findings are: 1) dissipation speed does not vary purely by location; 2) a heavy vehicle is faster to discharge than its passenger car size-equivalent is; 3) the queue in a left-turn lane discharges faster than that in a through lane; 4) an upgrade slope increases the queue dissipation time due to more rolling resistance to vehicle start-up and larger <b>vehicle</b> <b>gaps</b> for safety; 5) morning queues generally discharge more slowly; 6) contrary to common delay estimation models, regression analysis shows that queue dissipation time is linearly related to the number of vehicles rather than quadratically or in other ways; and 7) the simple linear function performs well both in terms of explanatory power (R 2) and consistency of signs. ...|$|R
40|$|Analyses of pedestrian-related {{issues have}} been gaining much {{attention}} from researchers in recent years, particularly studies of pedestrian safety and pedestrian level of service (LOS) in developing countries. The focus for evaluating pedestrian LOS has shifted from quantitative methods to qualitative methods and factors to be considered have been changing. Crosswalks (namely, signalized, unsignalized, and midblock) are complex locations because of the interaction of pedestrians with the vehicle flow. Pedestrian LOS at crosswalks {{is quite different from}} that on sidewalks. A measure of effectiveness (MOE) is usually adopted for evaluation of pedestrian facilities, and the MOE changes with the type of facility.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of managed lanes (MLs), {{also known as}} dynamically priced express lanes, to improve freeway traffic flow and personal throughput is on the rise. Congestion pricing is increasingly becoming a common strategy for congestion management, often requiring microscopic simulation during both planning and operational stages. VISSIM is a recognized microscopic simulation software used for analyzing the performance of managed lanes (MLs). This thesis addressed two important microscopic simulation issues that affect the evaluation results of MLs. One of the microscopic simulation issues {{that has not yet}} been addressed by previous studies is the required minimum managed lane routing decision (MLRD) distance upstream of the ingress point of MLs. Decision distance is an optimal upstream distance prior to the ingress at which drivers decide to use MLs and change lanes to orient on a side of MLs ingress. To answer this question, this study used a VISSIM model simulating I- 295 proposed MLs in Jacksonville, Florida, United States (U. S), varying the MLRD point at regular intervals from 500 feet to 7, 000 feet for different levels of service (LOS) input. Three measures of effectiveness (MOEs) - speed, the number of vehicles changing lanes, and following distance - were used for the analysis. These MOEs were measured in the 500 feet zone prior to the ingress. The results indicate that as the LOS deteriorates, speed decreases, the number of vehicles changing lanes increases, and the following distance decreases. When the LOS is constant, the increase in the MLRD distance from the ingress point was associated with the increase in the speed at the 500 feet zone prior to the ingress, less number of lane changes, and the increase in following <b>vehicle</b> <b>gap.</b> However, the MOEs approached constant values after reaching a certain MLRD distance. LOS D was used to determine the minimum MLRD distance to the ingress of the MLs. The determined minimum MLRD distances were 4, 000 and 3, 000 feet for 6 and 3 lane segments prior to the ingress point, respectively. Another issue addressed in this thesis is the managed lane evaluation (MLE) outputs, which include speed, travel time, density, and tolls. In computing the performance measures, the existing VISSIM managed lane evaluation (EVMLE) tool is designed to use the section starting at the point when vehicles are assigned to use MLs, also known as the MLRD point, which is located upstream of the ingress. The longer the MLRD distance from the ingress, the more the EVMLE tool uses the traffic conditions of the MLs traffic before entering the ML in its computations. This study evaluates the impact of the MLRD distance on the EVMLE outputs and presents a proposed algorithm that addresses the EVMLE shortcomings. In order to examine the influence of the MLRD distance on the outputs of the above-mentioned two algorithms, simulation scenarios of varying MLRD distances from 500 ft to 7, 000 feet from the ingress were created. For demonstration purposes, only the speed was used to represent other performance measures. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was performed to determine whether {{there was a significant difference}} in the speed results with the change in the MLRD distance. According to the ANOVA results, the EVMLE tool produced ML speeds that are MLRD dependent, yielding lower speeds with an increased MLRD distance. On the other hand, the ML speed results from the proposed algorithm were fairly constant, regardless of the MLRD distance...|$|E
40|$|Bridge {{structures}} are {{key components of}} highway infrastructure and their safety is clearly of great importance. Safety assessment of highway bridges requires accurate prediction of the extreme load effects, taking account of spatial variability through the bridge width and length. This concept of spatial variability i s also known as random field analysis. Reliability - based bridge assessment permits the inclusion of uncertainty in all parameters and models associated with the deterioration process. Random field analysis takes account of the probability that two points n ear each other on a bridge will have correlated properties. This method incorporates spatial variability which results in a more accurate reliability assessm ent. This paper presents an integrated model for spatial reliability analysis of reinforced concre te bridges that considers both the bridge capacity and traffic load. A sophisticated simulation model of two - directional traffic is used to determine accurate annual maximum distributions of load effect.

They may include irrigation ditches, stream banks, short but steep escarpments, canals, walls, berms, excavation overburden, and other micro-terrain features with a positive or negative elevation difference from immediately surrounding terrain. We examined LIDAR (LIght Detection and Ranging) data over southwestern Montana to capture detailed elevation profiles over suspected terrain gaps, and derived geometric attributes from profile subsets to characterize gap morphology from the perspective of critical military parameters. These data were captured as geospatial information in a GIS environment containing gap linear feature classes with associated attribute data. The profile subsets for each gap feature lend themselves to automatic extraction of elevation breaklines in defining the spatial limits of the gap in the direction of maximum slope change. The distribution of gap features with attribution within the study area demonstrates the critical role that micro-terrain gaps can play in tactical military routing and maneuver models, by obviating bridging, crossing, and avoidance decisions on the ground with advance knowledge of gaps from tactical remote sensors...|$|R
40|$|Observation at midblock signalled {{pedestrian}} crossings in Malaysia {{showed that}} {{violation of the}} red signal aspect by both the motorists and pedestrians is close to 70 %. Motorists may travel on the red signal aspect {{when there is no}} pedestrian on the crossing. Pedestrians are also observed to cross in <b>vehicle</b> <b>gaps</b> at the crossings during the right of way to vehicles. Such behaviour is dangerous especially at a system where the traffic movements rely on the signal aspects shown to them. Four alternative algorithms were designed in order to enhance the operation and safety of users at the midblock signalled pedestrian crossings in Malaysia. The objectives are to increase pedestrian safety and drivers compliance with the signal. The developed strategies required detectors to register the vehicle and pedestrian demands. Algorithms were designed to compute the appropriate time to start and terminate the vehicle and pedestrian precedence. The applied computation aimed to limit vehicle delay and to ensure that vehicle saturation flow does not exceed 85 % of the road capacity. Apart from the vehicle demands, the developed strategies also attempt to emphasis on the requirement and limits of pedestrian behaviour. Four measures of performance are compared and evaluated. These measures are the percentage of vehicles crossing on the red man, pedestrian mean delay, mean cycle times and vehicle mean delay. The measures of performance of all algorithms are evaluated using a fully calibrated and validated simulation program. All of the new strategies increase the pedestrian compliance and balance.
