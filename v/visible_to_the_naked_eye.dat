5|$|Hale–Bopp was a record-breaking comet—the {{farthest}} comet {{from the}} Sun discovered by amateurs, {{with the largest}} well-measured cometary nucleus known after 95P/Chiron, and it was <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye</b> for {{twice as long as}} the previous record-holder. It was also brighter than magnitude0 for eightweeks, longer than any other recorded comet.|$|E
5|$|The nucleus {{reached its}} maximum {{apparent}} size in December 1882. The comet faded gradually, but despite its fragmentation it remained <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye</b> until February 1883. The last definite sighting {{of the comet}} was made by B. A. Gould at Córdoba on 1 June 1883.|$|E
5|$|The {{overwhelming}} probability is {{that the}} next supernova observed in the Milky Way will originate from an unknown white dwarf or anonymous red supergiant, very likely not even <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye.</b> Nevertheless, {{the prospect of a}} supernova originating from an object as extreme, nearby, and well-studied as Eta Carinae arouses great interest.|$|E

5|$|The star HR 6958, {{also known}} as MV Serpentis, is an Alpha2 Canum Venaticorum {{variable}} that is faintly <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye.</b> The star's metal abundance is ten {{times higher than the}} Sun for most metals at the iron peak and up to 1,000 times more for heavier elements. It has also been found to contain excess silicon. Barely <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye</b> is HD 172365, a likely post-blue straggler in the open cluster IC 4756 that contains a large excess of lithium. HD 172189, also located in IC 4756, is an Algol variable eclipsing binary with a 5.70 day period. The primary star in the system is also a Delta Scuti variable, undergoing multiple pulsation frequencies, which, combined with the eclipses, causes the system to vary by around a tenth of a magnitude.|$|E
5|$|Halley's Comet or Comet Halley, officially {{designated}} 1P/Halley, is a short-period comet {{visible from}} Earth every 74–79 years. Halley {{is the only}} known short-period comet that is regularly <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye</b> from Earth, and the only naked-eye comet that might appear twice in a human lifetime. Halley last appeared in the inner parts of the Solar System in 1986 and will next appear in mid-2061.|$|E
5|$|Like the {{classical}} planets, Uranus is <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye,</b> {{but it was}} never recognised as a planet by ancient observers because of its dimness and slow orbit. Sir William Herschel announced its discovery on 13 March 1781, expanding the known boundaries of the Solar System {{for the first time in}} history and making Uranus the first planet discovered with a telescope.|$|E
6000|$|VII. Miscellaneous.--I {{send you}} a pikler of me in the cloak. I think {{it is like a}} hunchback. The {{moustache}} is clearly <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye--O diable! what do I hear in my lug? A mosquito--the first of the season. Bad luck to him! ...|$|R

25|$|Most {{inclusions}} {{present in}} gem-quality diamonds do {{not affect the}} diamonds' performance or structural integrity and are not <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eyes. However, large clouds can affect a diamond's ability to transmit and scatter light. Large cracks close <b>to</b> or breaking <b>the</b> surface may reduce a diamond's resistance to fracture.|$|R
5|$|Phoenix {{contains}} HE0107-5240, possibly one of {{the oldest}} stars yet discovered. It has around 1/200,000 the metallicity that the Sun has and hence must have formed very early {{in the history of the}} universe. With a visual magnitude of 15.17, it is around 10,000 times dimmer than the faintest stars <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye</b> and is 36000 light years distant.|$|E
5|$|The planet Jupiter {{has been}} known since ancient times. It is <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye</b> {{in the night sky}} and can {{occasionally}} be seen in the daytime when the Sun is low. To the Babylonians, this object represented their god Marduk. They used Jupiter's roughly 12-year orbit along the ecliptic to define the constellations of their zodiac.|$|E
5|$|With an {{apparent}} magnitude between +7.7 and +8.0, Neptune is never <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye</b> {{and can be}} outshone by Jupiter's Galilean moons, the dwarf planet Ceres and the asteroids 4 Vesta, 2 Pallas, 7 Iris, 3 Juno, and 6 Hebe. A telescope or strong binoculars will resolve Neptune as a small blue disk, similar in appearance to Uranus.|$|E
5000|$|Chief Justice Warren Burger {{wrote for}} the 5-4 majority, {{referring}} to Katz v. United States. He concluded, [...] "The Fourth Amendment simply {{does not require the}} police traveling in the public airways at this altitude to obtain a warrant in order to observe what is <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{complete}} larvae stage takes approximately 21 days. After fertilization {{there are}} seven stages of larva metamorphosis: cleavage, blastocyst, gastrulation, auricularia (subdivided in early, mid, late), doliolaria (mid metamorphic stage pre settlement), penttactula and the last settled sea cucumber larva, <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> human eye, which develops into the final organism.|$|R
50|$|AG Carinae (AG Car) {{is a star}} in the {{constellation}} Carina. It is classified as a luminous blue variable {{and is one of the}} most luminous stars in the Milky Way. The large distance (20,000 light-years) and intervening dust mean that the star is not usually <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye; its apparent brightness varies erratically between magnitude 5.7 and 9.0.|$|R
5|$|According to {{measurements}} {{made by the}} Hipparcos astrometric satellite, Mu Arae {{exhibits a}} parallax of 64.47 milliarcseconds as the Earth moves around the Sun. When combined with the known distance from the Earth to the Sun, this means the star is located {{at a distance of}} 50.6 light years (15.51 parsecs). Seen from Earth it has an apparent magnitude of +5.12 and is <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{the galactic}} plane passes through it, Serpens Cauda {{contains}} many massive OB stars. Several {{of these are}} <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye,</b> such as NW Serpentis, an early Be star that {{has been found to}} be somewhat variable. The variability is interesting; according to one study, it could be one of the first discovered hybrids between Beta Cephei variables and slowly pulsating B stars. Although not <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye,</b> HD 167971 (MY Serpentis) is a Beta Lyrae variable triple system consisting of three very hot O-type stars. A member of the cluster NGC 6604, the two eclipsing stars are both blue giants, with one being of the very early spectral type O7.5III. The remaining star is either a blue giant or supergiant of a late O or early B spectral type. Also an eclipsing binary, the HD 166734 system consists of two O-type blue supergiants in orbit around each other. Less extreme in terms of mass and temperature is HD 161701, a spectroscopic binary consisting of a B-type primary and an Ap secondary, although it is the only known spectroscopic binary to consist of a star with excess of mercury and manganese and an Ap star.|$|E
5|$|Both the {{apparent}} and absolute magnitude scales are logarithmic units: one whole number difference in magnitude {{is equal to}} a brightness variation of about 2.5 times (the 5th root of 100 or approximately 2.512). This means that a first magnitude star (+1.00) is about 2.5 times brighter than a second magnitude (+2.00) star, and about 100 times brighter than a sixth magnitude star (+6.00). The faintest stars <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye</b> under good seeing conditions are about magnitude +6.|$|E
50|$|The {{best known}} example is Rigel, the {{brightest}} star in the constellation of Orion. Its mass is about 20 times that of the Sun, and its luminosity is around 117,000 times greater. Despite their rarity and their short lives they are heavily represented among <b>the</b> stars <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye; their immense brightness is more than enough to compensate for their scarcity.|$|R
50|$|Chi1 Hydrae (χ1 Hya) is {{a binary}} {{star in the}} {{equatorial}} constellation of Hydra. It originally received the Flamsteed designation of 9 Crateris before being placed in the Hydra constellation. Based upon an annual parallax shift of 23.13 mas as seen from Earth, it is located about 141 light years from the Sun. It is <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> with a combined apparent visual magnitude of 4.94.|$|R
40|$|Eu-doped BaTiO 3 xerogel {{thin films}} of pseudo-cubic {{perovskite}} phase were successfully fabricated on MgO substrates {{by using a}} high concentration sol-gel process, in which a gel-aging process on substrate (GAPS) was employed. Strong photoluminescence in <b>the</b> xerogels is <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eyes under UV excitation at room temperature. Influences of europium concentration, hydrolysis and aging conditions on the photoluminescence were investigated quantitatively...|$|R
5|$|Comets {{are small}} Solar System bodies, {{typically}} {{only a few}} kilometres across, composed largely of volatile ices. They have highly eccentric orbits, generally a perihelion within the orbits of the inner planets and an aphelion far beyond Pluto. When a comet enters the inner Solar System, its proximity to the Sun causes its icy surface to sublimate and ionise, creating a coma: a long tail {{of gas and dust}} often <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|E
5|$|HD 2039 is {{a yellow}} dwarf or yellow subgiant {{star in the}} {{constellation}} Phoenix. The star is not <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye,</b> and lies approximately 330 light years away from the Sun. HD 2039 is a relatively stable star, and an exoplanet {{at least three times}} the mass of the planet Jupiter has been discovered in its orbit; this exoplanet, known as HD 2039 b, was the 100th exoplanet to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|Hale–Bopp became <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> <b>eye</b> in May 1996, and {{although}} its rate of brightening slowed considerably {{during the latter}} half of that year, scientists were still cautiously optimistic that it would become very bright. It was too closely aligned with the Sun to be observable during December 1996, but when it reappeared in January 1997 it was already bright enough to be seen by anyone who looked for it, even from large cities with light-polluted skies.|$|E
50|$|Phi2 Hydrae (φ2 Hya) {{is a star}} in the {{constellation}} Hydra. It originally received the Flamsteed designation of 1 Crateris before being placed in the Hydra constellation. Based upon an annual parallax shift of 4.31 mas as seen from Earth, it is located roughly 760 light years from the Sun. The star is faintly <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> with an apparent visual magnitude of 6.09.|$|R
50|$|M21 is a {{relatively}} young cluster of a mere 4.6 million years of age. It is tightly packed but contains about 57 stars. A few blue giant stars {{have been identified in}} the cluster, but Messier 21 is composed mainly of small dim stars. With a magnitude of 6.5, M21 is not <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye; however, with the smallest binoculars it can be easily spotted on a dark night.|$|R
5000|$|COROT-1 is {{a yellow}} dwarf main {{sequence}} star similar <b>to</b> our Sun. <b>The</b> star is located approximately 1,560 light-years {{away in the}} constellation of Monoceros. The apparent magnitude of this star is 13.6, which means it is not <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>naked</b> eye; however, {{it can be seen}} through a medium-sized amateur telescope on a clear, dark night. The first exoplanet discovered {{in the course of the}} COROT mission orbits this star; it is considered to be a [...] "hot Jupiter," [...] and is approximately as massive as the planet Jupiter itself.|$|R
