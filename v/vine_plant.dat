5|$|During a {{geological}} survey on Surata IV, Commander William Riker (Jonathan Frakes) {{is struck by}} a thorn growing on a motile <b>vine</b> <b>plant.</b> The away team immediately beams back to the Enterprise, where Dr. Katherine Pulaski (Diana Muldaur) finds out that the thorn has released a deadly virus into Riker's body. Within a matter of hours, the virus will reach Riker's brain, killing him. To try to save Riker's life, Pulaski puts him into a machine that will artificially stimulate his brain neurons, keeping them active and resisting the virus. This causes Riker to dream of his past adventures aboard the Enterprise. Riker's first dreams are of reasonably neutral occasions, such as {{his first meeting with}} Lieutenant Commander Data (Brent Spiner). He soon moves on to more passionate and even erotic dreams, such as meeting the cheerful young Edo women on Rubicon III, the matriarch Beata (Karen Montgomery) on Angel One, or the computer-generated holodeck woman Minuet (Carolyn McCormick).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive case study and a psychological examination of lianas intended for their landscaping application. In the Introduction, {{the significance of}} the study is represented by showing why the study for use of <b>vine</b> <b>plants</b> in Japan is belated to those in Europe and America and also the possibility of the <b>vine</b> <b>plants</b> being used extensively in the urban green and landscaping projects in Japan. In Chapter 1, the characteristics of <b>vine</b> <b>plants</b> are investigated theoretically, and a methodological framework for case study and analysis is examined. First, the <b>vine</b> <b>plants</b> are classified in seven categories {{from the point of view}} that they are organs climbing on other objects, and to these is added one category for other plants showing similar properties to the lianas, being specified as 2 ̆ 2 lianoid plants. 2 ̆ 2 Thus, the <b>vine</b> <b>plants</b> are classified in total eight categories according to their characteristics for application. On the other hand, the structures on which the <b>vine</b> <b>plants</b> are dependent are classified in fifteen types. Then, theoretically possible combinations of <b>vine</b> <b>plants</b> and their supports are investigated, and a table serving as a basis for analysis is prepared. In Chapter 2, the result of investigation and analysis of the cases of <b>vine</b> <b>plants</b> mainly in the urban area in Tokyo is shown, and the problems to be resolved hereafter are discussed. The findings of the investigation are generally as follows: a) The <b>vine</b> <b>plants</b> used over a wall of a large scale are comprised overwhelmingly of Japanese ivy which has a strong adsorptive force shows a growth coming up to a height of 20 m in about 10 years; b) With the new type commercial high-rise buildings, nutant characteristics of the plants of the hedera genus are generally employed; c) With the tea houses, restanrants and other similar shops, the <b>vine</b> <b>plants</b> are used in order to give an impression of Western style; d) In the independent houses, use of a variety of <b>vine</b> <b>plants</b> is seen; e) For the trellis, the traditional wisteria is used generally...|$|R

The original Chardonnay <b>vines</b> <b>planted</b> at Hanzell are Wente Clone and arrived at Hanzell {{by way of the}} McCreas' Stony Hill vineyard in St. Helena, which obtained its cuttings from the Wente Livermore Vineyard in 1948. [...] The original Pinot noir <b>vines</b> <b>planted</b> at Hanzell were derived from Martin Ray estate cuttings (now commonly referred to as the Mount Eden clone). The original Pinot noir vines at Mount Eden Vineyards were pulled out in 1997, and the original block of Pinot noir at Chalone planted in 1946 was replaced in 2003. [...] As of 2010, the 1953 blocks (C53 and N53) at Hanzell continue to produce, and the grapes are typically blended with grapes from the <b>vines</b> <b>planted</b> in subsequent years. From time to time, Hanzell bottles wines derived solely from these original blocks and dubs them [...] "Ambassador's 1953 Vineyard" [...] wines.|$|R

5000|$|While {{the grape}} is likely {{northern}} Italian in origin, the synonym Schiava {{is closely related}} to the Italian word for [...] "Slave" [...] and may hint to the type of <b>vine</b> <b>plant</b> in Roman times (forced by pruning). Records show that the grape has been growing in the Trentino-Alto Adige region since at least the 13th century. The German synonym Trollinger appears to be a corruption of the word Tirolinger meaning [...] "of Tyrol". The synonym Vernatsch appears to have a similar origins as Vernaccia in having the same root word as [...] "vernacular" [...] or [...] "local". British Master of Wine Nicolas Belfrage has interpreted this association as further evidence that the grape likely originated in the South Tyrol/Alto Adige region.|$|E

40|$|SummaryDespite {{all modern}} {{advances}} in medicine, an effective drug treatment of obesity {{has not been}} found yet. Discovery of leptin two decades ago created hopes for treatment of obesity. However, development of leptin resistance {{has been a big}} obstacle, mitigating a leptin-centric treatment of obesity. Here, by using in silico drug-screening methods, we discovered that Celastrol, a pentacyclic triterpene extracted from the roots of Tripterygium Wilfordi (thunder god <b>vine)</b> <b>plant,</b> is a powerful anti-obesity agent. Celastrol suppresses food intake, blocks reduction of energy expenditure, and leads to up to 45 % weight loss in hyperleptinemic diet-induced obese (DIO) mice by increasing leptin sensitivity, but it is ineffective in leptin-deficient (ob/ob) and leptin receptor-deficient (db/db) mouse models. These results indicate that Celastrol is a leptin sensitizer and a promising agent for the pharmacological treatment of obesity...|$|E

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the XXI century one of the main issues in the life of processing industries is the use of secondary resources. At that, the main factors are the desire to miti-gate the impact on the environment, on the one hand, and to receive new products additionally, on the other hand. This trend is of topical interest in the industries engaged in the processing of agricultural raw materials, since the so-called waste products are of biological origin and may be the initial material for the production of feed and, in some cases, food products. In the production of wines the main wastes are sweet and fermented grape pomace, yeast and racking sludges, grape seed and others.

40|$|Wine (Latin: vinum) is an {{alcoholic}} beverage {{obtained by the}} fermentation of the grapes, {{the fruit of the}} <b>vine</b> <b>plant.</b> In Europe, according to legal regulations, the wine is the product obtained exclusively by full or partial fermentation of fresh grapes, clove or not, or of grape must. The transformation of grapes into wine is called vinification. The science of wine is called oenology. In some other parts of the world, the word wine can be true of alcohol obtained from other types of fruit. These wines are referred to as fruit wines, or wear a name by which the fruit is used for obtaining them (for example apple wine). Wine tourism is a type of tourism that involves visiting wineries, tasting, consumption and purchase of wine, usually directly from the manufacturer.

40|$|The vine {{mealybug}} (VM), Planococcus ficus (Signoret), is {{a worldwide}} pest and affects mainly grapevine and figs. In Israel, (S) -lavandulyl senecioate [(S) -LS] and (S) -lavandulyl isovalerate [(S) -LI] were identified from VM reared for several generations on potato sprouts, {{when compared with}} the identification of only (S) -LS from feral females. Racemic lavandulyl senecioate (LS) can be used for fieldwork because the unnatural enantiomer is benign and does not affect the activity of the pheromone. Lures loaded with 200 lg of LS remained active for 24 weeks but it is recommended to replace lures after 12 weeks to preserve constant and high attractiveness. Delta sticky traps, baited with 50 or 200 lg of LS were used to determine the daily flight pattern and the seasonal flight activity including <b>vine</b> <b>plant</b> infestation. A positive correlation between peak mealybug density and male capture was observed strengthening the usefulness of the pheromone traps for monitoring the pest. Addition of racemic or the two enantiomers of lavandulyl isovalerate (LI) to LS decreased the capture of VM males. The level of inhibition varied during 2003 – 2004. Both enantiomers of LI displayed the same antagonistic activity. Addition of (S) -lavandulol to the pheromone resulted in shutdown of the traps.
