5|$|A {{cellular}} automaton {{is defined by}} its cells (often a one- or two-dimensional array), a finite set of values or states that can go into each cell, a neighborhood associating each cell with a finite set of nearby cells, and an update rule according to which the <b>values</b> <b>of</b> all cells are updated, simultaneously, {{as a function of}} the <b>values</b> <b>of</b> their neighboring cells.|$|E

50|$|Output rose {{so rapidly}} that by 1985 the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> {{production}} generated in sidelines exceeded the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> principal crop and livestock production. To make the gross <b>value</b> <b>of</b> agricultural output more realistically represent agricultural production, statisticians in 1985 limited sideline production to hunting and fishing, collecting wild herbs, and producing family handicrafts. After 1985, therefore, {{there were at least}} three aggregate measures of economic performance: gross <b>value</b> <b>of</b> output; gross <b>value</b> <b>of</b> agricultural output (crops, livestock, forestry, aquatic, and sideline); and gross <b>value</b> <b>of</b> rural society, which included the gross <b>value</b> <b>of</b> agricultural output plus the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> rural industrial, transportation, construction, and other output.|$|R
5|$|The {{total of}} the round points the player (or pair) has gained is {{calculated}} as the sum of <b>values</b> <b>of</b> the cards collected in the baza and the <b>values</b> <b>of</b> the declared combinations.

5|$|This form of Cotes's spirals {{corresponds}} {{to one of}} the two Poinsot's spirals (Figure 8).
