Despite its importance, a major issue has clouded the frequent pattern mining methodology: the number of frequent patterns can easily become too large to be analyzed and used. Though many efforts have tried to tackle this issue, {{it remains to be}} an open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel block-interaction model to answer this call. This model can help summarize a collection of frequent itemsets and provide accurate support information using {{only a small number of}} frequent itemsets. At the heart of our approach is a set of core blocks, each of which is the Cartesian product of a frequent itemset and its support transactions. Those core blocks interact with each other through two basic operators (horizontal union and <b>vertical</b> <b>union)</b> to form the complexity of frequent patterns. Each frequent itemset can be expressed and its frequency can be accurately recovered through the combination of these core blocks. This is also the first complete generative model for describing the formation of frequent patterns. Specifically, we relate the problem of finding a minimal block-interaction model to a generalized set-cover problem, referred to as the graph set cover (GSC) problem. We develop an efficient algorithm based on GSC to discover the core blocks. A detailed experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach...|$|E

40|$|The {{production}} of textile artifacts is spatially {{distributed in the}} state of Rio Grande do Norte {{in a way that it}} is concentrated in the metropolitan area of Natal and in the Seridó Potiguar region. The later houses 49 % of the total of production units of the State, with emphasis on the domestic utensils field (FIERN, 2017). The activity is likewise concentrated within the region itself, especially in its western half, in the municipalities of Caicó, Currais Novos and Jardim de Piranhas. Their productive structure is based on obsolete techniques and technologies, with the origin of the capital being local or regional and intensive use of cheap and low-skilled labour. In view of the above, the present study has as central question: how can an activity with the characteristics of the {{production of}} textile artefacts in Seridó Potiguar be successfully inserted in the current dynamics of spatial circuits of production and, moreover, coexist with the hegemonic technical systems of planetary order? Therefore, the aim is to analyze the use of the territory by the spatial circuit of textile production, with emphasis on the production of domestic utensils, through its processes, dynamics and content in the region of the Seridó Potiguar. For the development of the research, a bibliographical review was carried out, mainly from Andrade (1981), Arroyo (2008), Azevedo (2007, 2013), Barrios (2014), Castillo and Frederico (2010), Furtado (1969), Marx (1990, 2011), Moraes (1984), Santos (2012) and Silveira (2010 b). Furthermore, some theoretical and methodological procedures were adopted to collect and systematize data, based on the techniques of documentary research, field research - in which interviews were executed based on semi-structured scripts and forms - articulated with a spatial descriptive statistical baseline. It was determined, through the research, that in the spatial of production of textile artefacts in Seridó Potiguar, the raw material flow derives mainly from the Northeast region itself, materializing the existence of a monopoly, in these assets supply, controlled by companies from Ceará with subsidiaries in Rio Grande do Norte. The machine's productive consumption flow and equipment comes exclusively from the Concentrated Region, notably from São Paulo. Conversely, the consumptive consumption is markedly sprayed, embracing mainly the Northeast and, in a lesser extent, the North and Southeast region. It was possible to conclude that the circulation process is completely alienated, considering that local companies have a relative capacity of production, however, as they occupy subaltern positions in the territory, they do not own market power to hold their control, awarding themselves the middlemen action. In this field, the places <b>vertical</b> <b>union</b> overlaps to a great extent to the horizontal links with the productive use of the Seridó Potiguar territory. Considering that the low social and productive cohesion between the textile field agents verified in the mentioned cut by means of the absent, to a certain extent, of the State, as a public policies promoter, and in detriment of the development of the activity itself in the region. The shy initiatives of the Public Power insists on thinking about the productive branches in isolation, and not the territory used as a whole, when they do not arbitrarily transfer their role to the corporative interests. A produção de artefatos têxteis distribui-se espacialmente no Rio Grande do Norte de modo concentrado nas regiões Metropolitana de Natal e Seridó Potiguar. Esta última abriga, aproximadamente, metade das unidades produtivas do estado, onde se destaca o ramo de artefatos domésticos. A atividade concentra-se, outrossim, no interior da própria região, sobretudo em sua porção ocidental, nos municípios de Caicó, Currais Novos e Jardim de Piranhas, cuja estrutura produtiva baseia-se em tecnologias obsoletas, em relação aos processos produtivos baseados em um elevado grau de capitalização, com a origem local ou regional do capital e uso intensivo de mão de obra barata e pouco qualificada. Diante do exposto, o presente trabalho tem como questionamento central: como uma atividade com as características da produção de artefatos têxteis no Seridó Potiguar consegue lograr inserção na dinâmica atual dos circuitos espaciais produtivos e coexistir com os sistemas técnicos de ordem planetária? Desse modo, busca-se analisar o uso do território pelo circuito espacial produtivo têxtil, com ênfase na produção de artefatos domésticos a partir dos processos, dinâmica e conteúdo desta na região do Seridó Potiguar. Para o desenvolvimento da pesquisa, realizou-se revisão bibliográfica, sobretudo a partir de Andrade (1981), Arroyo (2008), Azevedo (2007, 2013), Barrios (2014), Castillo e Frederico (2010), Furtado (1969), Marx (1990, 2011), Moraes (1984), Santos (2012) e Silveira (2010 b). Ademais, adotaram-se procedimentos teórico-metodológicos de coleta e sistematização de dados, baseados nas técnicas de pesquisa documental, pesquisa de campo – na qual executou-se a aplicação de entrevistas com base em roteiros semiestruturados e formulários – articulada com uma base estatística. Constatou-se, através da pesquisa, que, tratando-se do circuito espacial da produção de artefatos têxteis no Seridó Potiguar, os fluxos de matéria-prima são oriundos principalmente da própria região Nordeste, materializando a existência de monopólio no fornecimento desses bens, controlado por empresas do Ceará com filiais no Rio Grande do Norte. Os fluxos do consumo produtivo de máquinas e equipamentos são oriundos exclusivamente da região concentrada, notadamente de São Paulo. Por outro lado, o consumo consuntivo é marcadamente pulverizado, abrangendo sobretudo o Nordeste, e, com menor expressão, as regiões Norte e Sudeste. Foi possível depreender, outrossim, que o processo de circulação é completamente alienado, haja vista que as firmas locais detêm uma capacidade relativa de produção, todavia, por ocuparem posições subalternas no território, não detêm poder de mercado suficiente para realizar o seu controle, outorgando-lhe a ação de atravessadores. Nessa esfera, a união vertical dos lugares se sobrepõe em grande medida aos nexos horizontais coadunados ao uso produtivo do território do Seridó Potiguar. Considera-se que a baixa coesão social e produtiva entre os agentes do ramo têxtil verificada no referido recorte se dá pela ausência, em certa medida proposital, do Estado, enquanto promotor de políticas públicas, e em detrimento do desenvolvimento da própria atividade na região. As acanhadas iniciativas do Poder Público insistem em pensar os ramos produtivos isoladamente, e não o território usado como um todo, isso quando não legam, arbitrariamente, o seu papel aos interesses corporativos...|$|E
40|$|Continuant son étude sur le syndicalisme commencée dans le dernier numéro, notre distingué {{collaborateur}} romain envisage ici tant du côté des principes que du côté des contingences historiques le problème que soulèvent les rapports entre le syndicat et la religion. Il définit ce que l'on entend par syndicat confessionnel et syndicat neutre et montre la différence qui existe entre les syndicats européens et les syndicats anglo-saxons. Enfin il analyse l'évolution qui est en train de s'accomplir chez les syndicats chrétiens d'Europe et y découvre une tendance vers la multiplicité dans l'organisation et l'unité dans l'action. CATHOLIC TRADE UNIONSTrade unionism reflects {{necessarily the}} thinking on social questions {{of those who}} were responsible for it. One must conclude that Catholics, in the light of logic, should establish Catholic unions. Moreover, such action corresponds to the frequently repeated teaching of the Church. NON-SECTARIAN TRADE UNIONSNevertheless, there may be historical conditions in which the establishment of specifically Catholic trade unions is impossible and unwise. In this case, Catholics should affiliate with trade union organizations that, as such, do not profess any religious conviction; in other words, non-sectarian unions. This policy {{is to be found in}} the teachings of Pius XI and Pius XII. Such a general union should limit its activities strictly to the economic and professionnal, and in the event that it broadened its action beyond this, it would be endangering its own existence. In fact, the union would be split because today the workers do not profess the same religion nor the same political opinion. NEUTRAL AND VERTICAL UNIONSIt is possible that a single union be established for each professional group. If the workers themselves dedice in favour of this policy (Great Britain and the United States) they are called general unions. If the State recognizes only one union, that is called a <b>vertical</b> <b>union.</b> Vertical unions, in spite of their drawbacks, should not be condemned everywhere and in all circumstances because it is possible that certain conditions may prevail which justify them. Catholics not only are permitted to belong but are urged to join them in order to vitalize them with their truth and sense of fraternity. NEUTRAL ORGANIZATIONS AND ACTIONA trade union organization is neutral when it is not inspired by an existing religious sentiment. Neutrality in the organization does not imply religious or moral neutrality in trade union action. Modern parliaments under the democratic dispensation, are neutral, but it does not follow that the member of the parliament must act politically as though morality and religion did not exist. There are two reasons for this: the first factual. It is psychologically impossible for a man to perform any action, no matter how technical, without introducing into it his religious, moral and social sentiments. The second is based on principle: man, whatever may be the field of his action, is bound to seek inspiration in the moral principles that constitute his ideal. In practice there is no such thing as a morally indifferent action. The moral and religious neutrality in the trade union organization demands a far greater moral and religious devotion in the action of its members. THE PROBLEM IN ITS HISTORICAL EVOLUTIONSince the historical circumstances that have determined the development of trade unions are different, the interest of the workers has "Of been envisaged in the same way and different methods have been used to fulfill them. Thus, in the Anglo-American world, the unions are devoted primarily to the achievement of immediate ends and are limited to strictly trade union purposes. On the continent of Europe, the unions have sought two ends at the same time: one immediate, that is to say, the specifically trade union objectives; the other more remote, that is, the establishment of a new economic and social order. In order to avoid a situation of inferiority with reference to the Marxists, Christian workers have founded trade unions whose programme is based on Christian social doctrine. COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CHRISTIAN TRADE UNIONSThe unions organized by Christians display almost everywhere certain common features: democratic structure, slow evolution in method, independence of the political parties and autonomy with regard to the State. In this they are quite distinct from the communist unions which practice revolutionary methods, seek long range objectives and depend entirely on the Party. DIFFERENT RELIGIOUS EMPHASESThe Christian trade unions, in addition to their economic and social objectives, also include certain moral and religious aims. Nevertheless, it would be inexact to assert that these objectives are similar in importance or assume the same form everywhere. Everything depends on the circumstances and environment of each country. RELIGIOUS NEUTRALITY AND BELIEFIn religion the general trade unions are necessarily neutral. If religion were to be the basis of organization, in view of the diversity of religious belief among workers, the result would inevitably be a multiplicity of unions. This does not mean that a neutral trade union ought, by definition, to be irreligious or unreligious. A trade union is neutral from the religious point of view, if, as such, it professes no religious belief and adheres to no single religious group in preference to all others. When it is non-sectarian, this does not mean that it cannot assume a positive attitude regarding religious values. Historically speaking, the most active neutral trade unions have been and are moved by a profond and often effective religious spirit. MULTIPLICITY OF ORGANIZATION AND UNITY OF ACTIONDuring the past few decades, as a result of social turmoil, European Catholics have given considerable thought to the problem of whether it is wiser to establish sectarian or neutral trade unions. Historically the practical solutions have been different. The difficulty of finding a single formula or solution is rooted in two undeniable facts: First, the conflict of social ideas among the workers and secondly the character of their specific interests as a group in opposition to the employers and the political community. If the emphasis is to be placed on the first, the inclination is to establish as many trade unions as there are essentially different social points of view. If the second point is emphasized, the existence of neutral trade unions would seem desirable, with specifically religious and moral organizations side by side. Historically both solutions have been carried out but even yet it is impossible to reach definitive conclusions. There is a certain tendency to think that the natural evolution of the situation will lead the European countries to the following arrangement which would appear the most logical. Basically, a large number of trade union organizations corresponding to the fundamental ideas of the workers; at the top, unity of action in the pursuit of common interests, such unity being made possible by successive agreements between trade unions or by some institutional arrangement as in the Netherlands. The trade union movements, becoming more and more independent of political parties and concentrating their attention on the pursuit of economic and professional goals, would move, on the continent of Europe, toward the system of a united trade unionism of the Anglo-American type...|$|E

5000|$|Until {{some point}} Añoveros’ focus on poverty, injustice, labor {{and social issues}} in general {{appeared}} to have been in line with syndicalist Falangist propaganda, but already when assisting Herrera Oria in Malaga his relations with the Movimiento were getting cold. Añoveros’ increasingly militant support for Catholic labor groupings, Hermandad Obrera de Acción Católica (HOAC) and Juventud Obrera Cristiana de España (JOC), was putting him on collision course with the official policy, especially as the organizations were assuming an alternative and challenging format. Some of his gestures looked like manifestos, which pitted the world of poverty against that of glamour and officialdom. Also in his sermons he embraced similar threads, e.g. when he lamented the plight of agricultural workers in Andalusia and lambasted lack of social conscience by the upper strata. However, at that time Añoveros was careful not to enter an openly confrontational path; in 1966 he presided over the 1966 Ceuta celebrations of 30th anniversary of [...] "Convoy de la victoria".After death of the conservative primate Enrique Pla y Deniel Añoveros became more vocal within the Spanish episcopate; he co-engineered condemnation of the official <b>vertical</b> <b>unions,</b> declared by the Bishops Conference in July 1968. Gradually his articles in HOAC bulletins, sermons and pastoral letters were assuming increasingly militant tone; some references, like the ones about [...] "the oppressed", were no longer compatible even with most flexibly applied official line. Apart from focus on social issues Añoveros advocated also a new Church animated by the Vaticanum II spirit; he also voiced in favor of family values in what seemed like confronting a new, consumer lifestyle. With the censorship almost lifted, in the late 1960s his sermons were getting widely quoted in the Spanish press; their author gained a nationwide recognition, e.g. declared Person of the Year by the Catalan periodical Mundo in 1970.Añoveros approved of and supported the phenomenon of „curas obreros”, encouraging seminarians from Cádiz to take up labor assignments in local industry. This, combined with his focus on social issues and down-to-earth profile of a [...] "parish bishop", drew comparisons to Hélder Câmara, chief exponent of the Latin American so-called liberation theology, though Añoveros has never admitted embracing the concept. At the turn of the decades the regime officials lost any illusions they might have had about Añoveros; at one point police suspected him of having running a Communist cell and in 1971 Dirección General de Seguridad counted him, together with Vicente Tarancón and Narciso Jubany, among [...] "jerarquías desafectas".|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{adoption}} of the organising model of union renewal by the Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) in response to membership decline and civil service restructuring. The neoliberal stance of successive UK Governments, together with the continuing decline of union influence and membership, have led unions to reassess their organisational and recruitment strategies. The growth in union renewal has seen many unions adopt both organising and partnership approaches since the formal re-launch of the TUC in 1994 (Heery, 1998). Despite organising now being a well-established tactic deployed by many unions, evaluating its effectiveness is problematic and requires further detailed research which transcends the extent to which organising fits the organising model. The central aim of this research is to: situate debates around union organising in a wider historical and political context; systematically examine the issues of structure and action in relation to union organising and union purpose; and provide a more holistic overview of one union's approach to organising by examining organising across different (horizontal and <b>vertical)</b> levels of <b>union</b> activity in a recognised environment. Hyman's (1994) model of internal union dynamics was adopted as a framework to examine the extent to which organising has been embedded in the structures of the PCS and the work of Simms (2007 a) and Martinez Lucio and Stuart (2005) were applied where appropriate. The research findings extend and challenge the existing literature on union renewal with two case studies illustrating that different sections of the same union can be expected to engage with the organising agenda to varying degrees. This is dependent on the perceived purpose of the union amongst representatives, as well as structural factors such as the employer's organisation of services and employment, the union's own internal structures, and crucially bargaining locus and scope.

In Paper II we {{determine the number of}} Khalimsky-continuous functions with 2, 3 and 4 points in their codomain. These enumerations yield examples of known sequences as well as new ones. We also study the asymptotic behavior of each of them. In Paper III we study the number of Khalimsky-continuous functions with codomain Z and N. This gives us examples of Schröder and Delannoy numbers. As a byproduct we get some relations between these numbers. In Paper IV we study the number of Khalimsky-continuous functions between two points in a rectangle. Using a generating function we get a recurrence formula yielding this numbers.   In the second part we study an analogue of discrete convexity, namely lateral convexity. In Paper V we define by means of difference operators the class of lateral convexity. The functions have plus infinity in their codomain. For the real-valued functions we need to check the difference operators for a smaller number of points. We study the relation between this class and integral convexity. In Paper VI we study the marginal function of real-valued functions in this class and its generalization. We show that for two points with a certain distance we have a Lipschitz property for the points where the infimum is attained. We show that if a function is in this class, the marginal function is also in the same class.

40|$|The Doctoral Thesis {{entitled}} “Essays on the Mode of Competition, Quality Improvement, and Collusion”, {{focuses on}} the alternative firms’ and unions’ strategies, such as cartel formation, unions’ structure, mode of market competition and R&D investments on quality improvement of products. In particular, it investigates {{their impact on the}} competitive position of an oligopolistic firm in the market, the market outcomes and social welfare. The above scientific fields are fundamental concerns of Industrial Organization, as they convey theoretical as well as empirical importance. The thesis consists of four theoretical essays on unionized oligopolistic markets with differentiated products. The first chapter, “Welfare Improving Cartel Formation in a Union-Oligopoly Static Framework”, studies the role of unions regarding the possibility and the effects of endogenous cartel formation. It also analyzes how the cartel formation may be welfare improving in a union-oligopoly static framework. The second chapter, “On the mode of Competition as a Collusive Perspective in Unionized Oligopoly”, endogenizes the mode of product market competition by exploring its strategic role on firms’ incentives for collusion. It indicates that the cartel formation is an unavoidable equilibrium in the product market. The last two chapters, “Union-Oligopoly Bargaining and <b>Vertical</b> Differentiation: Do <b>Unions</b> Affect Quality?” investigate the alternative unions’ and market’s structures in oligopolies with R&D investments on static and dynamic analysis context. Among others, it concludes that all market participant surpluses are higher (and consequently so is Social Welfare), when the R&D – quality improvement is a public good, even if this leads to indirect taxation on market products. Regarding the technical analysis of the thesis’ issues, Game Theory proves more superior among the other economic modeling techniques, as it {{focuses on the}} strategic interdependence among the economic agents. Consequently, for each issue a non-cooperative multi-stage game setup (single/one-shot or infinitively repeated) is proposed, where economic agents select their strategies from within a given agenda. Each of the proposed games has been solved using backwards induction in order to obtain the perfect sub-game Nash equilibrium...|$|R
