50|$|Discriminant {{function}} {{analysis is}} a statistical analysis to predict a categorical dependent <b>variable</b> (<b>called</b> a grouping <b>variable)</b> {{by one or}} more continuous or binary independent <b>variables</b> (<b>called</b> predictor <b>variables).</b> The original dichotomous discriminant analysis was developed by Sir Ronald Fisher in 1936.

Discriminant function analysis is useful in determining whether a set of variables is effective in predicting category membership.|$|R

50|$|The {{vertical}} alignment (or {{profile in the}} United States, but {{not to be confused}} with rail profile) is the surface uniformity in the vertical plane.
