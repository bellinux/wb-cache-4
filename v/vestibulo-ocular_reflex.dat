5|$|Dynamic {{balance is}} {{provided}} through the three semicircular canals. These three canals are orthogonal (at right angles) to each other. At {{the end of}} each canal is a slight enlargement, known as the ampulla, which contains numerous cells with filaments in a central area called the cupula. The fluid in these canals rotates according to the momentum of the head. When a person changes acceleration, the inertia of the fluid changes. This affects the pressure on the cupula, and results in the opening of ion channels. This causes depolarisation, which is passed as a signal to the brain along the vestibulocochlear nerve. Dynamic balance also helps maintain eye tracking when moving, via the <b>vestibulo–ocular</b> <b>reflex.</b>|$|E
25|$|Treatment {{includes}} balance retraining exercises (vestibular rehabilitation). The exercises include {{movements of}} the head and body specifically developed for the patient. This form of therapy is thought to promote habituation, adaptation of the <b>vestibulo-ocular</b> <b>reflex,</b> and/or sensory substitution. Vestibular retraining programs are administered by professionals with knowledge and understanding of the vestibular system and its relationship with other systems in the body.|$|E
25|$|The {{neurochemistry}} {{of vertigo}} includes six primary neurotransmitters {{that have been}} identified between the three-neuron arc that drives the <b>vestibulo-ocular</b> <b>reflex</b> (VOR). Glutamate maintains the resting discharge of the central vestibular neurons, and may modulate synaptic transmission in all three neurons of the VOR arc. Acetylcholine appears to function as an excitatory neurotransmitter in both the peripheral and central synapses. Gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) {{is thought to be}} inhibitory for the commissures of the medial vestibular nucleus, the connections between the cerebellar Purkinje cells, and the lateral vestibular nucleus, and the vertical VOR.|$|E

25|$|The {{function}} of the vestibular system during spaceflight {{is by far the}} most carefully studied of all. This is especially true of the gravity-sensing otolith organs and their relationship to eye movements. The vestibular semicircular canal function seems unchanged in weightlessness because the horizontal eye movements that compensated for head yaw rotation are not affected by spaceflight. The absence of gravity stimulation of the otoliths reduces the torsional <b>vestibulo-ocular</b> <b>reflex</b> during head roll rotation in microgravity. This deficit is absent when astronauts are exposed to centrifugal forces, suggesting that the adaptive CNS changes are taking place centrally rather than peripherally.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea that}} {{climbing}} fiber activity functions as an error signal has been examined in many experimental studies, with some supporting it but others casting doubt. In a pioneering study by Gilbert and Thach from 1977, Purkinje cells from monkeys learning a reaching task showed increased complex spike activity—which {{is known to}} reliably indicate activity of the cell's climbing fiber input—during periods when performance was poor. Several studies of motor learning in cats observed complex spike activity {{when there was a}} mismatch between an intended movement and the movement that was actually executed.

Vestibular function will be investigated at several levels: <b>vestibulo-ocular</b> <b>reflexes,</b> vestibulo-spinal pathways, cortical functions involving perception of motion and spatial orientation, visual vestibular interaction, and motion sickness susceptibility.

40|$|<b>Vestibulo-ocular</b> <b>reflexes</b> ensure gaze {{stability}} during locomotion and passively induced head/body movements. In precocial vertebrates such as amphibians, vestibular reflexes {{are required}} very early {{at the onset}} of locomotor activity. While the formation of inner ears and the assembly of sensory-motor pathways is largely completed soon after hatching, angular and translational/tilt <b>vestibulo-ocular</b> <b>reflexes</b> (VOR) display differential functional onsets and mature with different time courses. Otolith-derived eye movements appear immediately after hatching, whereas the appearance and progressive amelioration of semicircular canal-evoked eye movements is delayed and dependent on the acquisition of sufficiently large semicircular canal diameters. Moreover, semicircular canal functionality is also required to tune the initially omnidirectional otolith-derived VOR. The tuning is due to a reinforcement of those vestibulo-ocular connections that are co-activated by semicircular canal and otolith inputs during natural head/body motion. This suggests that molecular mechanisms initially guide the basic ontogenetic wiring, whereas semicircular canal-dependent activity is required to establish the spatio-temporal specificity of the reflex. While a robust VOR is activated during passive head/body movements, locomotor efference copies provide the major source for compensatory eye movements during tail- and limb-based swimming of larval and adult frogs. The integration of active/passive motion-related signals for gaze stabilization occurs in central vestibular neurons that are arranged as segmentally iterated functional groups along rhombomere 1 - 8. However, at variance with the topographic maps of most other sensory systems, the sensory-motor transformation of motion-related signals occurs in segmentally specific neuronal groups defined by the extraocular motor output targets...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundSelf-generated body {{movements}} require compensatory eye {{and head}} adjustments {{in order to}} avoid perturbation of visual information processing. Retinal image stabilization is traditionally ascribed to the transformation of visuovestibular signals into appropriate extraocular motor commands for compensatory ocular movements. During locomotion, however, intrinsic “efference copies” of the motor commands deriving from spinal central pattern generator (CPG) activity potentially offer a reliable and rapid mechanism for image stabilization, in addition to the slower contribution of movement-encoding sensory inputs. ResultsUsing a variety of in vitro and in vivo preparations of Xenopus tadpoles, we demonstrate that spinal locomotor CPG-derived efference copies do indeed produce effective conjugate eye movements that counteract oppositely directed horizontal head displacements during undulatory tail-based locomotion. The efference copy transmission, by which the extraocular motor system becomes functionally appropriated to the spinal cord, is mediated by direct ascending pathways. Although the impact of the CPG feedforward commands matches the spatiotemporal specificity of classical vestibulo-ocular responses, the two fundamentally different signals do not contribute collectively to image stabilization during swimming. Instead, when the CPG is active, horizontal <b>vestibulo-ocular</b> <b>reflexes</b> resulting from head movements are selectively suppressed. ConclusionsThese results therefore challenge our traditional understanding of how animals offset the disruptive effects of propulsive body movements on visual processing. Specifically, our finding that predictive efference copies of intrinsic, rhythmic neural signals produced by the locomotory CPG supersede, rather than supplement, reactive <b>vestibulo-ocular</b> <b>reflexes</b> in order to drive image-stabilizing eye adjustments during larval frog swimming, represents a hitherto unreported mechanism for vertebrate ocular motor control...|$|R

50|$|The <b>vestibulo-ocular</b> <b>reflex</b> {{needs to}} be fast: for clear vision, head {{movement}} must be compensated almost immediately; otherwise, vision corresponds to a photograph taken with a shaky hand. To achieve clear vision, signals from the semicircular canals are sent as directly {{as possible to the}} eye muscles: the connection involves only three neurons, and is correspondingly called the three neuron arc. Using these direct connections, eye movements lag the head movements by less than 10 ms, and thus the <b>vestibulo-ocular</b> <b>reflex</b> is one of the fastest reflexes in the human body.|$|E
40|$|Many medicines, {{mainly with}} {{neurological}} purpose, {{interfere with the}} oculomotricity. The biochemistry of the oculomotor systems and thus, the mechanisms of action of these drug interferences are not completely clarified. Most medicines impair the eye movements {{at the level of}} their fine adjustment by feed-back loops implying the cerebellum. Quite often, the interferences remain asymptomatic, restricted to a saccadic pursuit, hypometric saccades or an end-point nystagmus. Sometimes however, symptoms of dizziness or oscillopsia appear, due to loss of the <b>vestibulo-ocular</b> <b>reflexes</b> efficiency. A diplopia or a blurred vision by double outline could be suggestive of an ocular motor paresis or a loss of the binocular fusion due to drugs action.
