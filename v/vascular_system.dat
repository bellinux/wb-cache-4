The molecules are absorbed into the plants' <b>vascular</b> <b>system</b> and poison insects feeding on them. Another approach involves spraying dsRNA like a conventional pesticide. This would allow faster adaptation to resistance. Such approaches would require low cost sources of dsRNAs that do not currently exist.|$|E
5|$|Acquired {{risk factors}} include the strong risk factor of older age, which alters blood {{composition}} to favor clotting. Other important acquired risk factors include major surgery and trauma, {{both of which}} may increase the risk because of tissue factor from outside the <b>vascular</b> <b>system</b> entering the blood. In orthopedic surgery, venous stasis may be temporarily provoked by a cessation of blood flow {{as part of the}} procedure. Cancer can grow in and around veins, causing venous stasis, and can also stimulate increased levels of tissue factor. Pregnancy causes blood to favor clotting, and in the postpartum, placental tearing releases substances that favor clotting. Oral contraceptives and hormonal replacement therapy increase the risk through a variety of mechanisms, including altered blood coagulation protein levels and reduced fibrinolysis.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from their}} {{function}} in locomotion, the tube feet act as accessory gills. The water <b>vascular</b> <b>system</b> serves to transport oxygen from, {{and carbon dioxide}} to, the tube feet and also nutrients from the gut to the muscles involved in locomotion. Fluid movement is bidirectional and initiated by cilia. Gas exchange also takes place through other gills known as papulae, which are thin-walled bulges on the aboral surface of the disc and arms. Oxygen is transferred from these to the coelomic fluid, which acts as the transport medium for gasses. Oxygen dissolved in the water is distributed through the body mainly by the fluid in the main body cavity; the circulatory system may also play a minor role.|$|E

5|$|CSF {{returns to}} the <b>vascular</b> <b>system</b> by {{entering}} the dural venous sinuses via arachnoid granulations. These are outpouchings of the arachnoid mater into the venous sinuses around the brain, with valves to ensure one-way drainage. This occurs because of a pressure difference between the arachnoid mater and venous sinuses. CSF has also been seen to drain into lymphatic vessels, particularly those surrounding the nose via drainage along the olfactory nerve through the cribriform plate. The pathway and extent are currently not known, but may involve CSF flow along some cranial nerves and be more prominent in the neonate. CSF turns over {{at a rate of}} three to four times a day. CSF has also been seen to be reabsorbed through the sheathes of cranial and spinal nerve sheathes, and through the ependyma.|$|E
5|$|Invertebrate predators include crabs, starfish and octopuses. Crabs {{crack the}} shells with their pincers and starfish use their water <b>vascular</b> <b>system</b> {{to force the}} valves apart and then insert part of their stomach between the valves to digest the bivalve's body. It has been found {{experimentally}} that both crabs and starfish preferred molluscs that are attached by byssus threads to ones that are cemented to the substrate. This was probably because they could manipulate the shells and open them more easily when they could tackle them from different angles. Octopuses either pull bivalves apart by force, or they bore a hole into the shell and insert a digestive fluid before sucking out the liquified contents.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a pipeline of image processing steps for deriving symbolic models of vascular structures from radiological data which reflect the branching pattern and diameter of vessels. For the visualization of these symbolic models, concatenated truncated cones are smoothly blended at branching points. We put {{emphasis on the}} quality of the visualizations which is achieved by anti-aliasing operations in different stages of the visualization. The methods presented are referred to as HQVV (High Quality Vessel Visualization). Scalable techniques are provided to explore vascular structures of different orders of magnitude. The hierarchy as well as the diameter of the branches of <b>vascular</b> <b>systems</b> are used to restrict visualizations to relevant subtrees and to emphasize parts of <b>vascular</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Golden Ratio (a {{ratio of}} ~ 1. 618 : 1) appears {{repeatedly}} in nature including structural and functional traits of organisms (e. g. Fibonacci spirals of snail shells and certain seed heads), the spiraled shape of galaxies and hurricanes, {{and even in}} much cultural architecture and art. In the mid- 19 th century, branching structures in plant and animal <b>vascular</b> <b>systems</b> were found to follow the Golden Ratio; that is, successive branches in the <b>vascular</b> <b>systems</b> {{of plants and animals}} tend to follow a length ratio of about 1. 618 : 1. Here we present a model that uses this empirical evidence as a branching ratio in theoretical <b>vascular</b> <b>systems.</b> We then use a defined mass of the model system as a predictor of log-log scaling of terminal units. In this model, log terminal units and log mass scale similarly with that of other models as well as empirical evidence, but with more parsimony and a perspective not yet offered among all available models of allometric scaling. This model invites novel and broad hypotheses on the influence of the Golden Ratio on power scaling in organisms...|$|R

25|$|The {{mechanism}} by which the neural system provides feedback to the <b>vascular</b> <b>system</b> of its need for more glucose is partly the release of glutamate as part of neuron firing. This glutamate affects nearby supporting cells, astrocytes, causing a change in calcium ion concentration.

Nitric oxide is a vasodilator causing arterioles to expand and draw in more blood.|$|E
