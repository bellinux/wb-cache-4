This paper reports the field vibration tests {{of a typical}} stay cable of 115 m long before and after being installed with MR dampers. The field vibration tests were conducted by using ambient vibration excitation, and sinusoidal excitation followed by free vibration decay, respectively. The resonant frequencies and equivalent modal damping of the first twenty in-plane modes of the cable with and without MR dampers are identified. The relationship between the equivalent modal damping ratio and the applied <b>voltage</b> <b>strength</b> to MR dampers is experimentally determined. The test {{results show that the}} modal damping ratios of the free cable without dampers conform to a combined Rayleigh and frequency-independent damping model, and are almost unvaried with vibration amplitude within the tested range. Installation of MR dampers results in a slight change of resonant frequencies in comparison with the free cable, but variation in applied voltage almost does not affect the resonant frequencies. The equivalent modal damping ratios of the cable-damper system are found to be dependent on the installation location of MR dampers, <b>voltage</b> <b>strength</b> applied to the dampers, and the cable vibration level. The optimal voltage input, which achieves maximum system damping, is obtained for different modes under different vibration amplitudes. With optimal voltage applied to the dampers, the resulting system damping should be high enough to suppress both wind-rain-induced vibration and wake galloping of cables.

The research in this paper looks at the electrochemical performance of ultrasound integrated with an electrodeposition technique for the reclamation of EDTA-copper wastewater. Since the pH and <b>voltage</b> <b>strength</b> are major working parameters of the technique, their effects on the copper removal, COD (chemical oxygen demand) degradation and current efficiency were investigated. According to experimental results, the ultrasound + electrodeposition technique can effectively remove copper (95. 6 %, w/w) and decompose the EDTA (84 % COD removal) from the wastewater containing EDTA-copper complex compounds under certain operational control. The copper removal efficiencies follow-the order of pH 3 > pH 5 > pH 7. The removal efficiency of copper under different voltage gradients follows the order of 2. 0 V cm(- 1) > 1. 5 V cm(- 1) > 1. 0 V cm(- 1) > 0. 5 V cm(- 1). A neutral pH and an appropriate voltage gradient (1. 0 V cm(- 1) in this case) provide the maximum current efficiency. A pseudo-first-order and zero-order mode is proper to describe the electrodeposition kinetics without ultrasonication (R(2) values are greater than 0. 90) and with ultrasonication (R(2) values are greater than 0. 96), respectively.

40|$|A {{new type}} of a {{demountable}} and gas-permeable high voltage insulation was developed for the cable-in-conduit conductor connections of the superconducting Wendelstein 7 -X (W 7 -X) magnet system. These connections are situated within the cryovacuum space of the machine. Normal operation voltages are very low {{so that they do}} not need to be considered separately with respect to electrical insulation. On the other hand, in case of an emergency switch off the maximal voltage between two conductor joints might reach around 3 kV. Again, the normal operation cryovacuum is by far sufficient as an electrical insulator for this voltage too. However, in case of a vacuum failure which might occur simultaneously with or might even trigger a fast coil discharge, the gas pressure could reach the conditions of the 'Paschen minimum' which is characterized by a low breakdown voltage. In the worst case the leak woulder occur for instance between the cryovacuum space and the helium system leading to the minimal helium breakdown voltage of #approx# 160 V even for large electrode distances. The gas-permeable high voltage insulation was tested with regard to dc <b>voltage</b> <b>strength</b> and to gas flow for He below atmospheric pressure. Experiments were performed around the Paschen minimum region at ambient as well as LN_ 2 temperatures. The results show that this type of insulation has sufficient strength for the specified test voltage of 12 kV under all vacuum conditions. The gas flow investigations proved that the flow resistance and the ability to hold helium will hinder neither the pumping of the W 7 -X cryostat nor the leak tests. This work shows the principal applicability of the proposed insulation system. Further investigations would be needed for better physical understanding and for optimization. However, the development is so far advanced that one could start to build an insulation prototype for W 7 -X. A patent application was filed for this gas-permeable and dismountable high voltage insulation which is suitable also for other large superconducting magnets with cable-in-conduit conductors. (orig.)

In this thesis, a depth literature review regarding the technical contribution of FACTS devices along with their allocation methods in power systems is presented. Four types of FACTS devices (Static Var compensator (SVC), Thyristor-Controlled Series Capacitor (TCSC), Thyristor-Controlled Voltage Regulator (TCVR), and Thyristor-Controlled Phase Shifting Transformer (TCPST)) are considered for optimal placement in a multi-machine power system to reduce the overall costs of power generation. The placement methodology simultaneously considers the cost of generated active and reactive powers and the cost of selected FACTS devices for a range of operating conditions. The annual Load Duration Curve (LDC) has been used in the selection of the operating conditions {{in order to make the}} proposed allocation beneficial over the year and to remove any bias in the device selection. Two global optimisation techniques: the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and a new method based on the Low Discrepancy Sequences (LOS), are employed to solve the allocation task. The Optimal Power Flow (OPF) is integrated into the proposed optimisation methods in order to solve for the cheapest generation dispatch. The Net Present Value(NPV) method is then utilised to assess the economic value of the solution. The NPV evaluation study includes a detail discussion of the uncel 1 ainties involved in the NPV main parameters. The system steady state propel 1 ies in terms of voltage profile and power transfer are investigated after the allocation of the devices in order to avoid any adverse effects of such allocations. The Voltage Security Margin (VSM) is used in the voltage profiles assessment which measures the relative <b>voltage</b> <b>strength.</b> In addition to the steady state performance assessment, the system dynamics has been examined as well after the placement of the devices in order to find out the devices impact on the system stability, both small signal and transient, as the contribution of such devices to damping the electromechanical oscillation represents a crucial benefit. In this assessment, a systematic explanation of the FACTS devices incorporation in the muItimachine power system is presented in addition to a method of coordinated tuning of the system damping controllers. Furthermore, an observability study is performed for the selection of the FACTS devices damping controllers input signals. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

The {{attention is focused on}} highly efficient procedures to be able to scan a large number of candidate gases. To identify new molecules, we derived an empirical correlation between the electric strength of a gas and certain molecular properties, like polarizability or dipole moment, which can be calculated by means of density functional theory. The swarm parameters of these pre-selected molecules in mixtures with buffer gases is then quantified, using a newly set-up Pulsed Townsend experiment. The setup operates {{with a high degree of}} automation to enable systematic evaluation of gas mixtures not to miss possible synergistic effects. Key element of this PT setup is a new photocathode that works with a high quantum efficiency and long lifetime even when exposed to reactive species during the measurements. Moreover, for an automated operation it is important to know precisely in which range the experiment can be operated, i. e. for example to know up to which electron density space charge effects can be neglected. Finally, the measured swarm parameters need to be translated into breakdown <b>voltage</b> <b>strengths</b> of different electrode arrangements and different applied voltage wave shapes.
