5|$|Carménère is {{produced}} in wineries either as a single-variety wine (sometimes called a <b>varietal</b> <b>wine),</b> or as a blend usually with Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet franc or Merlot.|$|E
5|$|While Cabernet Sauvignon {{can grow}} {{in a variety}} of climates, its {{suitability}} as a <b>varietal</b> <b>wine</b> or as a blend component is strongly influenced by the warmth of the climate. The vine {{is one of the last}} major grape varieties to bud and ripen (typically 1–2 weeks after Merlot and Cabernet franc) and the climate of the growing season affects how early the grapes will be harvested. Many wine regions in California give the vine an abundance of sunshine with few problems in ripening fully, which increases the likelihood of producing varietal Cabernet wines. In regions like Bordeaux, under the threat of inclement harvest season weather, Cabernet Sauvignon is often harvested a little earlier than ideal and is then blended with other grapes to fill in the gaps. In some regions, climate will be more important than soil. In regions that are too cool, there is a potential for more herbaceous and green bell pepper flavours from less than ideally ripened grapes. In regions where the grape is exposed to excess warmth and over-ripening, there is a propensity for the wine to develop flavours of cooked or stewed blackcurrants.|$|E
25|$|In Argentina, the 18,759 {{hectares}} (46,354 acres) of Bonarda/Douce noir {{makes it}} is the second most widely planted red grape variety in the country after Malbec and representing 8% of the country's total vineyard plantings. The vast majority of the plantings are in the Mendoza wine region but significant plantings can also be found in the La Rioja, San Juan, and (the relatively unknown) Catamarca provinces. Here the grape is used for both blending (sometimes with Malbec or even Cabernet Sauvignon) but also as a <b>varietal</b> <b>wine</b> that Master of Wine Jancis Robinson notes {{has the potential to be}} of high quality.|$|E
5000|$|The DOC {{also allows}} two white <b>varietal</b> <b>wines,</b> Vermentino and Sauvignon Blanc. These <b>varietal</b> <b>wines</b> must {{have at least}} 85% of the variety stated on the bottle (e.g., Colline Lucchesi Sauvignon blanc).|$|R
50|$|In Languedoc, Piquepoul blanc is {{used both}} for {{blending}} and for <b>varietal</b> <b>wines.</b> Red wines produced from Picpoul noir {{are high in}} alcohol, are richly scented, but have a very pale colour, which has made the variety more popular as a blending ingredient than as a producer of <b>varietal</b> <b>wines.</b>|$|R
50|$|In Australia, Graciano is used {{either in}} blends with Tempranillo or as <b>varietal</b> <b>wines.</b>|$|R
25|$|The wine {{laws for}} the Hunter Valley {{follow the same}} {{regulations}} {{as the rest of}} Australia, as governed by the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. For a grape variety to appear on the wine label as a <b>varietal</b> <b>wine</b> it must account for at least 85% of the wine. If the wine is a multi-grape blend it must list the grapes on the wine in order of importance with the exact percentages of each grape listed somewhere on the wine. If the wine is labelled with a region then at least 85% of the grapes must be sourced from that area.|$|E
25|$|Wine expert Jancis Robinson {{has noted}} that Chenin blanc is {{probably}} the world's most versatile grape, being able to produce quality wines of various sweetness, including dessert wines noted for their aging ability, as well as sparkling made according to the méthode champenoise and fortified wines. The grape can distinguish itself as a single <b>varietal</b> <b>wine,</b> or it can add acidity as a blending component. Its ability to be crafted into premium quality wines across {{a wide spectrum of}} dry and sweetness levels invites the comparison to German Rieslings, with Robinson noting that in many ways Chenin blanc is France's answer to the German Riesling.|$|E
25|$|In the Old World wine {{regions of}} France and Italy, Bonarda/Douce noir {{is often used}} as {{blending}} grape contributing to the mid-palate of the wine. In California, the grape is often made as a <b>varietal</b> <b>wine.</b> There, many of the Bonarda/Douce noir/Charbono vines planted are very old, producing a very dense, medium to full bodied wine with a deep, inky purple color and moderate acidity. The wines often have black fruit and plum aroma and flavor notes that can develop into leather and tar notes as the wine ages. Well-made examples from favorable vintages can {{have the potential to}} age in the bottle for 10 to 20 years.|$|E
5000|$|Discovery Series (Okanagan), <b>varietal</b> <b>wines</b> {{made from}} [...] "odd" [...] {{varieties}} not commonly cultivated in Okanagan Valley.|$|R
5000|$|Pardillo {{is a white}} Spanish {{wine grape}} planted {{primarily}} in western Spain. <b>Varietal</b> <b>wines</b> made from Pardillo are neutral flavored.|$|R
50|$|Coteaux Bourguignons can be {{produced}} from Pinot noir, Gamay, Chardonnay, Aligoté, Tressot, and César, either as <b>varietal</b> <b>wines</b> or as blends.|$|R
25|$|Outside France it {{is grown}} in the Italian wine regions of Liguria and Tuscany where it is a {{permitted}} grape in Montecarlo bianco. In Australia, it was {{believed to have been}} brought to the continent to be blended with Shiraz. Documents dating as far back as 1882 have noted the presence of Roussanne plantings in Victoria. Today it is used both as a blending grape and as a <b>varietal</b> <b>wine.</b> In California, it is widely planted in the Central Coast AVA and the northern region of Yuba County. It has also recently been {{grown in the}} northern Golan Heights and produced as a wine in Israel.|$|E
25|$|In winemaking, {{the grape}} {{is often used}} as a deep {{coloring}} component in blends, rather than being made in a varietal form with some exceptions. Carignan can be a difficult variety for winemakers to work with being naturally high in acidity, tannins and astringency which {{requires a lot of}} skill to produce a wine of finesse and elegance. Some winemakers have experimented with carbonic maceration and adding small amounts of Cinsault and Grenache with some positive results. Syrah and Grenache are considered its best blending partners being capable of performing a softer wine with rustic fruit and perfume. In California, Ridge Vineyards has found some success with a <b>varietal</b> <b>wine</b> made from Carignan vines that were planted in the 1880s.|$|E
25|$|In California, American {{sparkling}} wine producers wishing {{to emulate the}} Champagne method began planting Pinot Meunier in the 1980s. Today most of the state's plantings {{are located in the}} Carneros AVA. Bouchaine Vineyards, Mumm Napa and Domaine Chandon are a few wineries in the all of the Napa Valley to produce a still Pinot Meunier. In Australia, the grape has had a longer history in Australian wine production than Pinot noir. In the Grampians region of Victoria, Pinot Meunier was known at one time as Miller's Burgundy and used to make still red <b>varietal</b> <b>wine.</b> In the late 20th century plantings were starting to decline until a revival of Champagne-style {{sparkling wine}} took hold in the 2000s which sparked renewed interest in Pinot Meunier. The New Zealand wine industry has recently discovered Pinot Meunier for both still & sparkling wine production. As a varietal red wine, Pinot Meunier tends to produce slightly jammy, fruit wines with moderate acidity and low tannins.|$|E
50|$|Two <b>varietal</b> <b>wines</b> are permitted, Sauvignon blanc and Vermentino, {{of which}} there {{must be at least}} an 85% of either grape variety.|$|R
50|$|Originally, Vin de Pays {{designation}} was commonly {{viewed as}} inferior to an AOC Appellation, often being ascribed to thin and simple wines. However, {{since the late}} 1980s, an increase in demand for <b>varietal</b> <b>wines</b> has led some French producers and cooperatives to produce more Vin de Pays, especially Vin de Pays d'Oc, to make <b>varietal</b> <b>wines</b> with some form of designation, while {{turning away from the}} highly restrictive AOC classification which often requires very specific blends of grape varieties.|$|R
25|$|Around 2005, Pinot gris {{was enjoying}} {{increasing}} {{popularity in the}} marketplace, especially in its Pinot grigio incarnation and similar New World <b>varietal</b> <b>wines.</b>|$|R
25|$|In France, Mourvèdre doesn't grow {{much farther}} north than the Châteauneuf-du-Pape AOC in the {{southern}} Rhône and even there has some trouble ripening in cooler vintages. It tends to ripen most consistently in the warmer Provençal region of Bandol AOC along the Mediterranean coast where the growing season is often 5°C warmer. While plantings have been declining in Spain, they have been increasing in France, particularly in the Languedoc-Roussillon region where the grape variety has seen growing popularity as both a <b>varietal</b> <b>wine</b> and as a blending component. After the phylloxera epidemic of the late 19th century and with declining interest in the variety {{for most of the}} 20th century, there were less than 900 ha in 1968, mostly {{in the southern}} Rhône and the Bandol AOC of Provence. But the spark of interest and international investment in the Languedoc saw planting sharply increase and by 2000 there were over 7,600 ha of Mourvèdre planted throughout Southern France.|$|E
25|$|As a <b>varietal</b> <b>wine,</b> Merlot {{can make}} soft, velvety wines with plum flavors. While Merlot wines tend to mature faster than Cabernet Sauvignon, some {{examples}} {{can continue to}} develop in the bottle for decades. There are three main styles of Merlot — a soft, fruity, smooth wine with very little tannins, a fruity wine with more tannic structure and, finally, a brawny, highly tannic style made in the profile of Cabernet Sauvignon. Some of the fruit notes commonly associated with Merlot include cassis, black and red cherries, blackberry, blueberry, boysenberry, mulberry, ollalieberry and plum. Vegetable and earthy notes include black and green olives, cola nut, bell pepper, fennel, humus, leather, mushrooms, rhubarb and tobacco. Floral and herbal notes commonly associated with Merlot include green and black tea, eucalyptus, laurel, mint, oregano, pine, rosemary, sage, sarsaparilla and thyme. When Merlot has spent significant time in oak, the wine may show notes of caramel, chocolate, coconut, coffee bean, dill weed, mocha, molasses, smoke, vanilla and walnut.|$|E
25|$|There {{are around}} 12 square {{kilometres}} of Mourvèdre in Australia, {{where it is}} also known as Mataro though more producers have begun adopting the French name Mourvèdre. While the grape {{has a long history of}} being used for generic cask wines and fortified wine, it has recently become more popular in highly acclaimed GSM blends with Grenache and Syrah. Like many grape varieties, Mourvèdre was first introduced to Australia as part of James Busby's collection of cuttings from his European travels in the 1830s. There it was quickly established in the South Australia wine region of the Barossa Valley by Lutheran immigrants from the Silesia Province in Prussia. From there it was spread by English immigrants to the McLaren Vale region south of Adelaide. Some of the oldest continually producing vines of Mourvèdre are in the New South Wales wine region of Riverina or South Australian wine region of Riverland. Turkey Flat Vineyards in the Barossa Valley was one of the forerunners of producing Mourvèdre as a single <b>varietal</b> <b>wine</b> with its first vintage in 2005.|$|E

25|$|Most of the {{vineyards}} of the Friuli-Venezia Giulia {{are located in}} the southern half of the region, including the large wine regions of Collio Goriziano, Colli Orientali del Friuli, Isonzo and Carso. The Lison-Pramaggiore region is shared with the Veneto. Smaller regions such as the Annia, Aquileia, Grave and Latisana {{are located in the}} central and western part of the region around the city of Pordenone. These smaller regions are located on alluvial plains with soils composed of gravel and sand. The wines made here are lighter and less elegant than the Friuli wines made in the major southern wine regions. Unlike other Friuli regions which require 100%, a <b>varietal</b> <b>wine</b> in the Graves and Aquileia zones only need 85% of the grape variety with the Latisana and Annia zones requiring 90%. More red wine is produced in these zones than {{in the rest of the}} Friuli with Merlot, Cabernet franc and Cabernet Sauvignon being the leading varietals. With wine production still, frizzante and spumante styles are produced from Chardonnay, Pinot bianco, Pinot grigio, Friulano and Verduzzo.|$|E
500|$|... is a green-skinned grape {{variety that}} {{originates}} from the Bordeaux region of France. [...] The grape most likely gets {{its name from}} the French words sauvage ("wild") and blanc ("white") due to its early origins as an indigenous grape in South West France. It is possibly a descendant of Savagnin. [...] is planted in many of the world's wine regions, producing a crisp, dry, and refreshing white <b>varietal</b> <b>wine.</b> The grape is also a component of the famous dessert wines from Sauternes and Barsac. Sauvignon blanc is widely cultivated in France, Chile, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, the states of Washington and California in United States.

2500|$|Malbec (...) is {{a purple}} grape variety used in making red wine. [...] The grapes {{tend to have}} an inky dark color and robust tannins, and are {{known as one of}} the six grapes allowed in the blend of red Bordeaux wine. The French {{plantations}} of Malbec are now found primarily in Cahors in South West France. It is increasingly celebrated as an Argentine <b>varietal</b> <b>wine</b> and is being grown around the world.|$|E
