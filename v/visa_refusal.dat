50|$|After {{years of}} <b>visa</b> <b>refusals</b> {{due to his}} past arrests for {{marijuana}} possession, Japan had finally allowed McCartney, and thus Wings, to perform. It would be McCartney's first time playing there since 1966 with the Beatles, and anticipation was running high with Wings' tour completely sold out. However, upon his arrival in Tokyo on 16 January 1980, a search of McCartney's luggage revealed a bag containing 219 grams of marijuana, prompting his immediate arrest and eventually cancelling the tour. After a nine-day jail stay, McCartney was released and returned home to his Scottish farm. Deciding to put Wings on hold while he contemplated his future, he now decided to issue his solo recordings from the previous summer.|$|R

They also planned to play Schubert's String Quintet with Pierre Fournier, and Mozart's Quintet with two violas (K.516) with Milan Škampa, violist of the Smetana Quartet, but neither project was realized, the first {{due to the}} impossibility of finding a concert date, the second due to a <b>visa</b> <b>refusal</b> from the Czechoslovakian authorities.

5000|$|The Government {{restricted}} {{religious freedom}} both actively and indirectly. The Government enforced laws that limit freedom of worship, speech, and assembly. The Government was sometimes responsible for and regularly failed to condemn acts of religious insensitivity or intolerance. The Government frequently referred to groups {{it did not}} consider to be traditional as [...] "nontraditional," [...] and government officials and state media widely used the term [...] "sect" [...] when referring to such groups, {{although it is not}} an official designation. Foreign missionaries, clergy, and charity workers faced increased government obstacles, including deportation and <b>visa</b> <b>refusal</b> or revocation. With or without official registration, some religious groups encountered difficulty renting or purchasing property to establish places of worship, building churches, or reacquiring state-controlled religious property. The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community is banned in Belarus.|$|E
5000|$|To be {{eligible}} for a visa waiver under the VWP, the traveler seeking admission to the United States must be a citizen {{of a country that}} has been designated by the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, as a [...] "program country". Permanent residents of designated countries who are not citizens of a designated country do not qualify for a visa waiver. The criteria for designation as program countries are specified in Section 217 (c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Title [...] ). The criteria stress passport security and a very low nonimmigrant <b>visa</b> <b>refusal</b> rate, not more than 3% as specified in Section 217(c)(2)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act and ongoing compliance with the immigration law of the United States.|$|E
50|$|Respect for {{religious}} freedom has recently worsened. The Government continued to restrict religious freedom {{in accordance with}} the provisions of a 2002 law on religion and a 2003 concordat with the Belarusian Orthodox Church (BOC), a branch of the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) and the only officially recognized Orthodox denomination. Although there is no state religion, the concordat grants the BOC privileged status. Protestants in particular attracted negative attention, presumably for their perceived links with the United States. Numerous anti-Semitic acts and attacks on religious monuments, buildings, and cemeteries occurred with little discernible response from the Government. Authorities kept many religious communities waiting as long as several years for decisions about property registration or restitution. Authorities also harassed and fined members of certain religious groups, especially those that the authorities appeared to regard as bearers of foreign cultural influence or as having a political agenda. Foreign missionaries, clergy, and humanitarian workers affiliated with churches faced many government-imposed obstacles, including deportation and <b>visa</b> <b>refusal</b> or cancellation.|$|E
50|$|After 1961, the Berlin Wall {{prevented}} the East German Action for Reconciliation (Aktion Sühnezeichen, or ASZ) from sending any more volunteers to the west. Because the German Democratic Republic (GDR) considered {{itself to be}} an anti-fascist state, it did not consider itself responsible for the consequences of German fascism. Therefore, the projects of the ASZ were initially limited to the GDR. In 1965 and 1966, volunteers were still able to travel with Catholic chaplains from Magdeburg to Auschwitz, Majdanek, Stutthof, Groß-Rosen and Breslau. By 1967 and 1968, further trips to memorial sites in Poland and Czechoslovakia were not permitted, despite invitations {{being sent to the}} state <b>visa</b> <b>refusal.</b> With the introduction in 1972 of visa-free travel between the GDR and Poland and Czechoslovakia, young German were able to take part in summer camps in Poland. By then, Polish and Czech young people were also embarking on missions in the GDR. From this time on, reconciliation groups were involved in the preservation and restoration of Jewish cemeteries in almost every region of the GDR. The first group to work at Buchenwald was in 1979. Starting in 1981, the number of summer camps expanded to include Sachsenhausen, Ravensbrück, and Nordhausen-Dora. From 1962 till 1992, over 12,000 volunteers took part in the summer camps from ASZ.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>visa</b> <b>refusal</b> {{rate for}} the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has dropped to 1.7% for HKSAR {{passport}} and 2.6% for British National (Overseas) passport as of 2012. Hong Kong met all VWP criteria but did not qualify at the time {{because it is not}} legally a separate country, despite having its own passports and independent judicial system, monetary system and immigration control. The former Chief Executive of Hong Kong, Donald Tsang, raised the issue with then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during his visit to the U.S. in 2011 and was met with positive response. On May 16, 2013, a bipartisan amendment bill was passed by the Senate Judiciary Committee but not ratified into law. On 10 August 2015, the U.S. Consul General to Hong Kong and Macau, Clifford Hart, said during an interview with South China Morning Post that the visa waiver is [...] "not happening anytime soon", as the Visa Waiver law requires the participant to be a [...] "sovereign state" [...] and Hong Kong is not independent, thus ending the possibility of Hong Kong joining the program. He also denied that the failed lobbying effort of HKSAR government on this issue was a result of the refusal of detaining Edward Snowden in 2013.|$|E
5000|$|After the {{expansion}} of the European Union in 2004, both the newly admitted countries and EU agencies began intensive lobbying efforts to include those new countries in the VWP. The U.S. Government initially responded to those efforts by developing bilateral strategies with 19 candidate countries known as the Visa Waiver Roadmap process. The U.S. Government began to accept the possibility of departing from the original country designation criteria - which had been contained within immigration law per se - and to expand them by adding political criteria, with the latter being able to override the former. This development began first with Bill S.2844 which explicitly named Poland as the only country {{to be added to the}} VWP, and continued as an amendment to the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 (S.2611), whose Sec. 413, Visa Waiver Program Expansion, defined broader criteria that would apply to any EU country that provided [...] "material support" [...] to the multinational forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. However, the definition of that [...] "material support" [...] would be met again only by Poland and Romania, a fact that was not favorably received by the other EU candidate countries. Ironically, Poland remains the only Central European country that is not a participating nation in the VWP as of 2017, due to a <b>visa</b> <b>refusal</b> rate above the critical threshold of 3%.|$|E
5000|$|During {{his visit}} to Estonia in November 2006, President Bush {{announced}} his intention [...] "to work with our Congress and our international partners to modify our visa waiver program". In 2006, the Secure Travel and Counterterrorism Partnership Bill {{was introduced in the}} Senate but no action was taken and that bill, as well as a similar one introduced in the House the following year, died after two years of inactivity. [...] The bill would have directed the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish a pilot program to expand the visa waiver program for up to five new countries that are cooperating with the United States on security and counterterrorism matters. The bill would have changed the nonimmigrant <b>visa</b> <b>refusal</b> rate threshold - from 3% - to 10%, thus making (as of 2010) 28 countries qualify for inclusion in the visa-waiver program: Argentina, Bahamas, Bahrain, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Croatia, Cyprus, Hong Kong (HKSAR passport and British National (Overseas) passport), Israel, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mauritius, Mozambique, Oman, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Poland, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Seychelles, South Africa, Swaziland, Taiwan, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and Uruguay. Note that Cyprus, Malta, Timor Leste, and Vatican City, had already (in 2006) refusal rates less than the original 3%, but {{were not included in the}} VWP countries (whereas a year later, some additional countries had this original low level: Cyprus and Taiwan). However, for continued participation, DHS re-evaluates participating countries every two years, as required by Congress. Through this process, two countries, Argentina and Uruguay, now are no longer eligible to participate. Current members will have to fulfill any new requirements to continue their eligibility for membership in the program. The European Union is currently planning to negotiate for participation of all of its members in the Visa Waiver Program.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} a {{description}} {{and analysis of the}} EU law and policy on Schengen visas. The EU visa policy is analysed in its historical development and its place in the framework of Schengen acquis. Separately, important visa policy measures are analysed including the typology of visas, exceptions from visa obligation, visa reciprocity, visa facilitation and processes of visa liberalisation. Different phases of the visa procedure are studied with focus on the questions whether there is a right to be issued a Schengen visa when the conditions are met and the right of appeal. The relevant legislation subject to analysis is above all the Visa Code, the regulation on visa lists and the relevant jurisprudence of the Court of Justice. By way of illustration, the implementation in the Czech legal order is used and jurisprudence of the Czech higher courts is quoted to show to what extent the EU visa procedure and <b>visa</b> <b>refusal</b> matches the requirements of the administrative law theory on the administrative procedure and decision in general. The relevant rules are assessed as to the extent they match with principles of legitimacy, influence of legal certainty, effectiveness and proportionality.

40|$|First, X and X {{contributes}} to legal uncertainty {{as regards the}} applicability of the Charter to member states for the purposes of Article 51 (1) CFR. The judgment does not conform to the expansive and creative interpretation of Fransson; it contradicts the specific precedent regarding powers derived from EU Regulations established in N. S. and Others; and it does not fit satisfactorily within the Siragusa criteria which the CJEU in any case entirely omitted. Second, the Court, instead of giving an appropriate degree of weight to the formal connection of the visa application to EU law, which was confirmed by the legal practice of the parties to the dispute at national level, the CJEU engaged in a counter-intuitive teleological interpretation that disregarded the textual reading of the statute. Such contra legem failure to give effect to an applicable statute – which merely required the acknowledgement of the applicability of EU law, not the reversal of the <b>visa</b> <b>refusal</b> – is inimical to a conventional functioning of legal systems based on the rule of law, such as the legal order of the EU. Moreover, the teleological interpretation cannot be validated by reference to any of the values that the EU is based upon; nor can it be legitimatized by requirements of the Dublin Regulation establishing the common EU asylum system, as there is no legal hierarchy between that Regulation and the Regulation on the Visa Code. Third and last, the CJEU paid little attention to the potential effects on the unity, primacy and effectiveness of EU law when divergent national standards with respect to visa applications “formally” based on the Visa Code are developed. By going to such great lengths to negate the Visa Code, the EU has effectively created “un-Chartered” territory in EU law. status: publishe...|$|E
