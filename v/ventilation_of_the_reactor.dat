40|$|General {{globalisation}} {{and increasing}} orientation of exporting branches of environmental technology towards {{the so called}} developing countries or threshold countries require new technological approaches which facilitate sustainable management in those countries especially with waste and sewage treatment. In order to protect ground and surface waters and to reduce ecological damages / nutrient discharge there is an urgent demand to remove not only oxygen consuming organic carbon compounds, but for example also ammonia-nitrogen, nitrate-nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater {{in order to prevent}} further eutrophication <b>of</b> <b>the</b> waters. However it is known that this results in a high technological and financial expenditure. <b>The</b> algae <b>reactor</b> developed in <b>the</b> research project makes use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> synergetic effect <b>of</b> heterotrophic and photoauto-/-heterotrophic organisms immobilized on an inert carrier material as biofilm, in order to achieve a purification efficiency that could so far only be reached with costly procedural solutions. The auto- and heterotrophic microalgae and cyanobacteria established in the biofilm contributed to the COD-decomposition and the oxygen supply for the heterotrophic bacteria in the biofilm. This synergetic effect enabled a COD-decomposition of up to 94 %. The developed and tested process allowed for an extensive nitrogen decomposition of up to 80 %. The phosphorus reduction correlated with <b>the</b> content <b>of</b> green algae in the biofilm and amounted up to 40 %. The excess biomass formed during the process could be anaerobically converted into biogas at high methane contents (up to 74 %). Alternatively, the excess biomass could also be utilized as NPK-fertilizer. A first calculation of profitability showed that the compact design and the fact that a technical <b>ventilation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> algae <b>reactor</b> is not necessary because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oxygen supply for the heterotrophic bacteria by microalgae and cyanobacteria resulted in extensive economies for investment costs and operating expenses compared to an aeration plant dimensioned for 1, 000 pe. The specific technical application <b>of</b> <b>the</b> synergetic effect between photauto-/-photoheterotrophic organisms and heterotrophic bacteria decomposing COD in an algae reactor thus lead to an effective and low-priced decentral sewage treatment process according to <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> project.

40|$|In <b>the</b> {{theoretical}} part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Master's thesis we first summarized the legislation about the disposal {{and treatment of}} wastewaters.

When the endotracheal tube was developed, this method was put aside. Recently, its use has gone up again.

In addition, there is no risk <b>of</b> intubation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> airways. The contraindication includes acute ischemic myocardium, a non-cooperating patient and inability to ensure the face seal. The research used qualitative and quantitative data collection methods. The qualitative research was done in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> interviews and content analyses <b>of</b> data. <b>The</b> research sample composed of six patients from the intensive care units in the hospital Nemocnice Tábor, a. s. <b>The</b> research sample <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quantitative data collection {{was made up of}} nurses from four hospitals in the Czech Republic, who work at the intensive care units and at the anaesthesiology and resuscitation unit. In total, 100 questionnaires were distributed and 84 properly filled in questionnaires were returned. The questionnaire included 40 closed questions. Objective 1 was to find out whether the nurses know and use <b>the</b> standard <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nursing care for the patient with non-invasive <b>ventilation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lungs. Objective 2 was to map actual conditions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nursing care for the patients with non-invasive <b>ventilation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lungs.

This work has got one research question. Which problems do the patients with non-invasive <b>ventilation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lungs have? The research found out that the patients most often have problems with rubbing and soreness to their face, dry mouth and throat and problems with sleeping. Hypothesis 1 (the nurses know standards <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nursing care for patients with non-invasive <b>ventilation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lungs) was disproved. The standard is not established in any hospitals. Hypothesis 2 (the nurses use <b>the</b> standards <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nursing care for the patients with non-invasive <b>ventilation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lungs) was disproved. The output is <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> standard called "The nurse assistance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patients with non-invasive <b>ventilation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lungs". Hypothesis 3 (<b>the</b> way <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nursing care for the patients with non-invasive <b>ventilation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lungs is different in the selected hospitals) was disproved. The nursing care in the selected hospitals is provided at the same level. The nursing care for these patients is a very demanding task for a nurse. An important element of successful treatment is a good psychological preparation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patient and almost continuous presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nurse at the patient´s bedside.
