50|$|Xsigo Systems' product, the I/O Director, is a {{hardware}} and software device that consolidates data center infrastructure and streamlines server I/O management. Using the Xsigo I/O Director, users provision I/O resources on live servers, without disrupting network and storage configurations, and without physically entering the data center. Xsigoâ€™s I/O virtualization solution replaces a serverâ€™s multiple Ethernet and Fibre Channel interfaces with a single high-speed Ethernet or InfiniBand link. Multiple <b>virtual</b> Ethernet <b>interfaces</b> (vNICs) and <b>virtual</b> Fibre Channel <b>interfaces</b> (vHBAs) communicate over this link. <b>Virtual</b> <b>interfaces</b> are established using Xsigoâ€™s virtualization hardware and Xsigoâ€™s host drivers.
