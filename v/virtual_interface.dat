They provide rich and powerful abstractions of the underlying hardware. They provide a small set of simple hardware abstractions and use applications called servers to provide more functionality.

For example, a multicast router mayoperate differently on interfaces that represent tunnels than onphysical interfaces (e.g. it may only need to collect membership informationfor physical interfaces).

50|$|Xsigo Systems' product, the I/O Director, is a {{hardware}} and software device that consolidates data center infrastructure and streamlines server I/O management. Using the Xsigo I/O Director, users provision I/O resources on live servers, without disrupting network and storage configurations, and without physically entering the data center. Xsigo’s I/O virtualization solution replaces a server’s multiple Ethernet and Fibre Channel interfaces with a single high-speed Ethernet or InfiniBand link. Multiple <b>virtual</b> Ethernet <b>interfaces</b> (vNICs) and <b>virtual</b> Fibre Channel <b>interfaces</b> (vHBAs) communicate over this link. <b>Virtual</b> <b>interfaces</b> are established using Xsigo’s virtualization hardware and Xsigo’s host drivers. These virtual I/O resources appear to the server’s applications like their traditional I/O card-based counterparts but unlike traditional I/O resources, vNICs and vHBAs can be created as needed and do not require the server to be opened or rebooted.|$|R
