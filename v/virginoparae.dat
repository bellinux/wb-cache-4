25|$|When a {{sophisticated}} reproductive strategy is used, only females {{are present in}} the population {{at the beginning of the}} seasonal cycle (although a few species of aphids have been found to have both male and female sexes). The overwintering eggs that hatch in the spring result in females, called fundatrices. Reproduction is typically parthenogenetic and viviparous. Eggs are parthenogenetically produced without meiosis and the offspring are clonal to their mother. The embryos develop within the mothers' ovarioles, which then give live birth to first-instar female nymphs (viviparous). The offspring resemble their parents in every way except size, and are called <b>virginoparae.</b>|$|E
40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} from 1974 through 1976 {{to determine the}} effects of temperature, leaflet maturity, and leaflet suitability as influenced by crowding and prior aphid feeding on the biology of individual blackmargined aphids, Monellia caryella (=costalis) (Fitch), feeding on pecans, and the relative importance of each of these factors in influencing aphid population dynamics. Nymphal mortality was greater on young than on mature leaflets and increased when temperatures varied above or below the optimum temperature of 23. 9 °C. Rate of development was not affected by leaflet maturity. Temperature had a significant effect on vivipara longevity and reproductive activity. Total fecundity was greatest at 23. 9 °C. More <b>virginoparae</b> produced progeny, lived longer, and were reproductive longer on mature than young leaflets. Fundatrices exhibited superior reproductive activity on young leaflets to <b>virginoparae</b> on either mature or young leaflets, especially at lower temperatures. Heat unit requirements for total nymphal development averaged 124. 9 °C-days above a lower developmental threshold of 8. 2 °C, using 32. 2 °C as the upper threshold. The rate of development of the blackmargined aphid was not affected by crowding but was decreased on leaflets conditioned by heavy prior aphid feeding. Nymphal mortality was increased by crowding and even more so on conditioned leaflets. Crowding decreased the proportion of <b>virginoparae</b> reproducing and their reproductive rate, but had no influence on longevity or reproductive period. The proportion of <b>virginoparae</b> producing progeny, longevity, reproductive period, and reproductive rates were significantly reduced for <b>virginoparae</b> reared on conditioned leaflets. When <b>virginoparae</b> were given a choice, 84 percent preferred leaflets which had not been conditioned. Studies of blackmargined aphid populations in southern Arizona pecan orchards confirmed laboratory and greenhouse findings that leaflet age, prior aphid feeding, and temperature were the major factors influencing aphid population patterns. The heat requirements for nymphal development under fluctuating orchard conditions were similar to those determined in controlled environments within ordinary temperature ranges. The relationship of vivipara longevity and reproductive rate to the daily rate of heat unit accumulation was determined...|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} {{of males and}} females by apterae of a holocyclic clone of Myzus persicae (Sulzer) was studied in the laboratory by transferring apterous <b>virginoparae</b> from long day to short day conditions at different stages of their pre- and post-natal development. Prenatal exposure was also examined in nine additional clones coming from different regions of Greece. By increasing the number of short day cycles at 17 degreesC, the aphids switched to male production earlier and produced more males. The highest mean number of male progeny was observed in apterae that were transferred to short day conditions 13 - 14 days prenatally. Apterae that were transferred to short day conditions after the fourth nymphal instar produced only females. Apterous <b>virginoparae</b> were produced by aphids that were transferred to short day conditions 0 - 1 days prenatally or postnatally. Aphids, given short days prenatally or in the first instar, produced alate female progeny that were all gynoparae. The later the instar aphids were transferred to short day conditions the fewer the gynoparae produced among their female progeny. A reduction in the total number of progeny and embryos per ovariole was observed as aphids were transferred to short day conditions in earlier stages of their development. The increase in male production, which follows the increase in the duration of long night exposure, was also observed in the additional eight out of nine examined clones...|$|E
40|$|Results from a {{behavioral}} study using a four-armed olfactometer (Vet et al, 1983) showed that alate and apterous <b>virginopara</b> of Aphis glycines were clearly attracted or arrested by volatiles from Glycine max, its secondary host plant, and Rhamnus davurica, its primary host plant. The attractiveness of G. max {{was greater than}} that of R. davurica. Chemical analysis indicated that there is some difference in the volatile profiles between these two plant species. The volatiles from two nonhost plant species Gossypium hirsutrm and Cucumis sativa, which are the most suitable host plants of another aphid A. gossypii closely related to A. glycines, were found to be neutral. However, the odors of Luffa cylindrical and Cucurbita pepo significantly repelled the alate <b>virginopara</b> of A. glycines. Thus, the olfactory response of A. glycines to these host and nonhost plants implies the evolutionary transition of A. glycines in host plant specificity. Blending the odors from nonhost plants Gossypium hirsutum, Luffa cylindrical and Cucurbita pepo with the attractive odor of host plant G. max blocked the attractiveness of the latter to the alate <b>virginopara</b> of A. glycines. It thus appeared that attractiveness of host plant to aphids can be disrupted by the presence of nonhost plant volatiles which have presumably masked the host plant odor, and the lack of attractiveness of the blended odors is caused by the change in volatile profile.

40|$|The host-plant {{acceptance}} behaviour of aphids was examined, in two aphid species, {{the bird}} cherry-oat aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi and the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphum pisum, to elucidate the recognition factors {{used to assess}} plant suitability for parthenogenetic reproduction. In addition, host-plant chemistry was investigated to study possible cues that initiated reproduction. The probing and parturition behaviour of R. padi on barley, Hordeum vulgare, or bird cherry leaves, Prunus padus, were monitored by electrical penetration graph (EPG) coupled with a simultaneous video recording. The autumn winged gynoparae and the summer winged <b>virginoparae</b> initiated reproduction on their host plants, P. padus and H. vulgare, respectively, before phloem contact occurred and {{these findings suggest that}} phloem contact is not necessary for host-acceptance decisions. Host acceptance behaviour of A. pisum, on susceptible and phloem-based resistant line of Medicago truncatula was monitored and found to be similar on both plant lines. The phloem-based resistance mechanism did not affect parturition behaviour indicating that reproduction is initiated prior to phloem contact. The results also imply that sign chemicals used as host recognition cues located in a peripheral tissue rather than in the phloem of host plants. Bioassays were employed to characterise the sign chemicals within host-plants of R. padi. It was found that <b>virginoparae</b> reproduced similarly on a neutral medium such as water or holidic diet as well as host-plant aqueous extract, which suggests that particular stimulants may be not involved in host-plant recognition by this generalist morph. On the other hand, aqueous extracts of bird cherry leaves specifically stimulated parturition in autumn gynoparae. Bioassay-guided chemical fractionation showed that at least five secondary metabolites appear to be involved in host recognition by gynoparae.

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{constitutive}} resistance of the apple cultivar Florina, Malus domestica Borkh. (Rosaceae), to the rosy apple aphid, Dysaphis plantaginea (Passerini) (Homoptera Aphididae), was performed {{for the first time}} by the electrical penetration graph (DC-EPG) system, using the susceptible apple cultivar Smoothe as control. All experiments were conducted with apterous adult <b>virginoparae.</b> The results showed a constitutive resistance in Florina due to a much longer period before the first probe reflecting surface factors. Some weak indications were found for pre-phloem resistance and initiating phloem access was not affected as inferred from equal time to show phloem salivation. However, the complete absence of phloem ingestion indicates a major resistance factor in the phloem sieve elements, most likely in the sieve element sap. Surface factors could have affected tissue related variables and this should be studied further. Anyhow, the strong constitutive resistance in Florina, either on the surface alone or in the phloem as well, effectively prevented reliable experiments on induced resistance, previously detected by molecular methods...|$|E
40|$|As adults, {{the summer}} (alate virginopara) and autumn (gynopara) winged {{forms of the}} black bean aphid, Aphis fabae, utilise {{different}} host plants, the bean Vicia faba, and the spindle tree, Euonymus europaeus, respectively. Electroantennograms (EAGs) were recorded from the antennae of these aphid forms, reared from a single clone, to thirty five plant volatiles and to paraffin oil extracts from leaves of the two host plants. The EAG peak responses were normalised against the adjacent responses to a standard stimulus ((E) - 2 -hexenal at log 2 dilution). The comparison of different parameters of the EAG responses, i. e. peak, rise and decay, reveals that peripheral olfactory perception of most volatiles is not significantly different between these two forms. In addition, the responses of adult wingless <b>virginoparae</b> to thirteen of the plant volatiles show, with one exception, similar peripheral perception. The results indicate that any odour discrimination between the two alternative host plants by their respective colonisers is not perceived {{at the level of}} the peripheral olfactory receptors. The EAG response profile of A. fabae differs from that of the vetch aphid, Megoura viciae, which also colonises bean...|$|E
40|$|Observation {{were made}} on the {{morphology}} of antennal sensilla of Aphis glycines using scanning electron microscopy. Apterae have antennal sensilla {{similar to those of}} the alatae, A group of four stout and often blunt-ended hairs appear at the tip of the antenna. A flattened sense organ (primary rhinarium) is located on the fifth antennal segment and that on the sixth segment there are four sensilla coeloconica and two sensilla placodea. They are ringed with a fringe of cuticle of which the finger-like extensions might function as a protective sieve against the entry of undesirable particles. Secondary rhinaria consist of sensilla placoidea resembling that on the fifth antennal segment, but without the elaborate fringe. Alatae differ even more markedly from apterae by possession of several to many secondary rhinaria on the flagellum. There were many secondary rhinaria on the third and the fourth, even the fifth segment in male A. glycines. The olfactory site of tested chemicals were analyzed by making use of EAG technique. It is demonstrated that primary rhinarium on the sixth antennal segment in slate <b>Virginoparae</b> responds to terpene derivatives (their alcohols, aldehydes and esters), but not to terpene hydrocarbons. While the rhinarium on the fifth segment responds to terpene hydrocarbons and not to terpene derivatives. Green leaf volatile and aromatic compounds were perceived by primary rhinaria on both segments, but the intensities of olfactory respones to the chemicals in each rhinarium are different. Besides the primary rhinaria on the two segments, receptor cells which responded strongly to (E) - 2 -hexanal and 1 -hexanal were found on other sensilla, which might be the trichodea (1 µm) and the small placodea (0. 8 µm) on the fifth segment. However, there was no direct electrophysiological evidence for it. Primary rhinarium on the sixth segment consists of main olfactory receptors for 3 -octen- 1 -ol; moreover, trichodeum and small placodeum on the some segment might also contribute to the sensory response to 3 -octen- 1 -ol. Primary rhinarium on the sixth segment was proved to be the sensory site for (E) -ß -farnesene in alate and apterous virgenoparae. Caryophyllene, which is an inhibitor of alarming pheromone, and (E) -ß-farnesene tarnesene could evoke a weak response in the secondary rhinaria on the t hird segment, and the primary rhinarium in apterous <b>virginoparae.</b> Originating text in Chinese.

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 A {{method of}} culturing Eriosoma pyricola on {{detached}} root pieces {{was developed to}} ensure a regular supply of aphids for experimental work. Another method was designed for studying the alate sexuparae formation in woolly pear aphid, whereby growing plants were infested so that the aphids or their progeny could be recovered later. Sexuparae were produced in woolly pear aphid colonies on the roots of "Domestic Bartlett" seedlings treated to induce dormancy, indicating E. pyricola is holocyclic in Oregon. No sexuparae were found while shoot growth continued. Shoot growth of pear seedlings ceased when the plants were exposed to 10 -hour photoperiods at a constant 24 °C. Growth continued for a much longer time when plants were kept under 16 -hour photoperiods at alternating day and night temperatures, 24 °C and 18 °C, respectively. However, aphids did not produce sexuparae when cultured on detached root pieces from plants treated for four weeks under 10 -hour photoperiods at a constant 24 °C. Also, sexuparae were not found in aphid colonies on root pieces of dormant plants from the field. All these results agree with our field observations. In the field, sexuparae are produced for about two months in late summer and early fall on the roots of infested plants. After this, no more sexuparae appear in the remaining aphid populations which continue as apterous <b>virginoparae</b> on pear roots until autumn of the following year. Experiments on growth cessation in pear plants indicated that short day-length was not the critical factor responsible for the induction of growth cessation in pear seedlings. These experiments also showed that constant temperatures were {{more important in the}} regulation of growth in this pear variety. The direct effect of photoperiods and temperatures on sexuparae production in this aphid was also investigated. Aphids on detached root pieces did not produce sexuparae when exposed to 10 -hour photo-periods at alternating day and night temperatures, 24 °C and 18 °C, respectively. Aphid cultures on detached root pieces were kept under different combinations of 10 - and 16 -hour photoperiods and 15 ° and 18 °C constant temperatures. But the treatments had no effect on sexuparae formation. No sexuparae were found in aphid colonies on root pieces kept in continuous darkness at constant temperatures of 15 °, 18 °, 21 °, 24 ° and 27 °C for periods of 14 to 49 days. Also, sexuparae were not produced when aphid cultures on root pieces were alternated between 15 ° and 24 °C every 12 hours for 47 days. Sexuparae were not found in our stock cultures maintained at 21 °C for about three years. Direct effect of different temperatures on the development and increase in numbers of woolly pear aphid was also studied. Apterous E. pyricola on detached roots developed and reproduced normally at 24 °C, but failed to reproduce and died within two weeks when kept at 27 °C. Apterous from stock culture and alate <b>virginoparae</b> from elm galls were transferred to the detached roots of "Domestic Bartlett" pear, Amelanchier florida Lindl., Sorbus sitchensis, Crataegus species, Ribes sativum and Red Delicious apple. The aphids did not survive except on the pear roots...|$|E
40|$|Changes in wing {{development}} and development through the stadia of Aphis fabae are examined after parasitisation by Aphidius colemani {{along with the}} underlying mechanisms. Parasitoid oviposition into nymphs of winged gynoparae of A. fabae shows that wing development is inhibited and the earlier parasitism takes place, the stronger the effect. Consideration of the timing of events indicates that the active component(s) is most likely injected during oviposition and {{is not related to}} hatching and growing of the parasitoid larva. When extracts of venom glands are injected into late-second stadium aphids, many develop to fourth-stadium possessing rudimentary wingbuds, show developmental arrest and often die while moulting to the adult stage. Injections with extracts of female or male parasitoids into later stadia give similar results with regard to development to the adult but aphids injected in the late-fourth stadium develop normally. Experiments with long-day winged <b>virginoparae</b> reveal similar results in development to the adult but injections into long-day wingless aphids, which develop more rapidly, show this effect only when performed early in the third stadium. The earlier the injection before the final moult the greater the effect of the extract on preventing adult development. The results indicate that there is an active factor(s) in the female parasitoid’s venom that disrupts wing {{development and}}/or inhibits development to the adult; the loss of activity after treatment at 100 °C or with protease makes it likely that the factor(s) is a protein. Surprisingly, injections of extracts from male parasitoids have similar effects. The location and function of such a factor(s) in males are unknown. Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography is used to fractionate the parasitoid extracts and bioassays reveal activity in fractions 16 - 25. Aphidius ervi venom also inhibits development of A. fabae (a non-host) whereas A. colemani venom has no effect on the development of Megoura viciae (a non-host). Injection with lipopolysaccharides and infection with a fungal pathogen are used to test whether stimulation of the immune response affects wing development in the host and the possibility that the host is in control of inhibiting its own wing development in order to support its immune system is discussed.
