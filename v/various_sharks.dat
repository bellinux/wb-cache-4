40|$|AbstractOptical {{measurements}} of the refractive state of the eyes of <b>various</b> <b>shark</b> species typically have depicted sharks as hyperopic (far-sighted) with little evidence of accommodation (i. e. the ability to change focus for visualizing objects at different distances from the eye). In this study, we used infrared video retinoscopy to measure the refractive state in juvenile lemon sharks (Negaprion brevirostris). This technique allows dynamic measurement of refractive state in free-swimming animals as they pass by an aquarium window. We found that unrestrained lemon sharks are focused emmetropically relative to a 1 -m distant photorefractor for the lateral visual field. However, when restrained either right side up or upside down (the latter inducing tonic immobility), the sharks become increasingly hyperopic, an artifact also reported in some other vertebrates. In addition, unrestrained lemon sharks display small amplitude accommodative excursions. Thus, refractive state measurements on restrained sharks in general may not reflect the natural, resting state of the shark eye, but rather, an induced hyperopia and lack of accommodative function. Such an artifact may be present in other vertebrate species, underscoring the need to obtain {{measurements of}} refractive state in unrestrained animals...|$|R

40|$|Trade in {{shark fins}} {{represents}} {{one of the most serious}} threats to shark populations worldwide. Previous studies have indicated that certain types of fins are more valued than others, but due to the largely unregulated and often covert nature of the trade, information on actual species composition has been anecdotal and unverified. In order to examine the potential impacts of the shark fin trade on the abundance of <b>various</b> <b>shark</b> species, a study of the species composition in the world’s largest shark fin trading center, Hong Kong, was initiated. Several approaches for distinguishing the species identity of dried fins were evaluated including visual differentiation (shape, color and morphometrics), denticle recognition, and DNA-based methods. This assessment found that genetic analyses were necessary to reliably determine species identity, and a technique involving application of polymerase chain reactions (PCR) with species-specific primers was selected. A sampling program was developed based on the requirements of the PCR technique, the practicalities of accessing samples, and the ability to draw statistically robust conclusions. Shark fins from twelve market categories were sampled and analyzed across a broad range of traders to investigate the concordance between trader names for fins and the associated species identity. Preliminary results indicating an initial matching of trade names and species identities will be presented. These data will subsequently be used in combination with daily shark fin auction records to estimate verified, speciesspecific proportions and quantities of shark fins in the trade...|$|R

40|$|In {{terrestrial}} environments, {{species diversity}} tends to {{increase from the}} poles to the equator and MacArthur’s Latitude-Niche Breadth hypothesis {{has become one of}} the universally accepted explanations for this phenomenon. MacArthur’s hypothesis states that species in the tropics experience greater stability across seasons than species at the poles due to relatively constant temperature regimes and primary productivity at low latitudes. As a result, tropical species can occupy smaller niches (defined as the environment and diet of the organism). Consequently, a larger diversity of species can inhabit the same niche area in the tropics, when compared to the poles. However, few studies have been conducted that actually test MacArthur’s hypothesis and even fewer studies have examined if it holds true in the marine environment. In fact, preliminary results have indicated that instead of inhabiting larger niches, as expected based on MacArthur’s hypothesis, shark species at the poles actually experience much smaller niches than their counterparts at the equator. Thus, the purpose of this project is to test MacArthur’s Latitude-Niche Breadth hypothesis in the marine environment by utilizing stomach content data of sharks in conjunction with location to estimate niche size and niche overlap. This will be accomplished by systematically comparing stomach content data of sharks that range from studies performed at the poles to those at the equator. Stomach content data is appropriate for this task since it provides specific prey items by number, mass, and frequency that were recently eaten by the shark. As a result, it can be utilized to determine the diversity of species consumed. The primary aim of this project will be to determine the niche sizes of <b>various</b> <b>shark</b> species. Then, using MacArthur’s and Levin’s measure and accounting for the body size of each species, variation in niche size and niche overlap will be examined with respect to latitude. Ultimately, the findings from this project on niche size and niche overlap will provide further insight into determining the ecological roles of sharks and the importance that they play to maintain ecosystem stability...|$|R

40|$|Small cetaceans, such as harbour porpoises, {{often become}} {{entangled}} in gillnets, and this anthropogenic mortality is a conservation concern. For years, harbour porpoises have been captured regularly in fisheries in waters of Newfoundland and Labrador (Canada), but defendable estimates have been lacking. Incidental catch of small cetaceans in nearshore and offshore gillnet fisheries in Newfoundland and Labrador waters was studied {{for the years}} 2001, 2002 and 2003, using datasets from Fisheries and Oceans Canada, reports from fishers, and Fishery Observer records. Fisheries studied included those targeting Atlantic cod, lumpfish, Atlantic herring, monkfish, white hake, Greenland halibut, redfish and winter flounder. [...] A methodology was developed to estimate incidental catch, based on datasets currently available within the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. Confidence intervals were generated using resampling statistics, allowing an assessment of uncertainty surrounding these estimates. Despite reductions in fishing effort since 1992, an estimated average of 1, 516 harbour porpoises were captured in various Newfoundland and Labrador gillnet fisheries annually between 2001 and 2003. Most captures occurred in nearshore fisheries for Atlantic cod and lumpfish. Several dolphin species were also captured in smaller numbers, mostly in the offshore monkfish fishery. The impact of this mortality on the population of harbour porpoise and other small cetaceans cannot be assessed until population estimates become available. [...] Using the same methodology, incidental catch assessments were compiled for numerous species of pinnipeds, seabirds, sharks and bony fish that had been reported as incidental catch. For most species, insufficient information exists {{to assess the impact}} of this mortality. However, catch rates of harbour seals, murres. shearwaters, <b>various</b> <b>shark</b> species and sturgeons appear to warrant concern. [...] In conclusion, Newfoundland and Labrador gillnet fisheries annually remove considerable numbers of non-target large marine vertebrates from the local marine ecosystem. The nearshore fisheries for Atlantic cod and lumpfish, and the offshore fishery for monkfish, appear to capture the greatest diversity of species, including small cetaceans, various seals, murres, shearwaters, schooling <b>sharks</b> and sturgeons. <b>Various</b> potential measures to mitigate this incidental catch in Newfoundland and Labrador are discussed.

40|$|Among the <b>various</b> <b>shark</b> {{species that}} are {{captured}} as bycatch in commercial fishing operations, the group of pelagic sharks {{is still one of}} the least studied and known. Within those, the crocodile shark, Pseudocarcharias kamoharai, a small-sized lamnid shark, is occasionally caught by longline vessels in certain regions of the tropical oceans worldwide. However, the population dynamics of this species, as well as the impact of fishing mortality on its stocks, are still unknown, with the crocodile shark currently one of the least studied of all pelagic sharks. Given this, the present study aimed to assess the population structure of P. kamoharai in several regions of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans using genetic molecular markers. the nucleotide composition of the mitochondrial DNA control region of 255 individuals was analyzed, and 31 haplotypes were found, with an estimated diversity Hd = 0. 627, and a nucleotide diversity pi = 0. 00167. An analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed a fixation index phi(ST) = - 0. 01118, representing an absence of population structure among the sampled regions of the Atlantic Ocean, and between the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. These results show a high degree of gene flow between the studied areas, with a single genetic stock and reduced population variability. in panmictic populations, conservation efforts can be concentrated in more restricted areas, being these representative of the total biodiversity of the species. When necessary, this strategy could be applied to the genetic maintenance of P. kamoharai.
