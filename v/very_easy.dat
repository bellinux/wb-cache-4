5|$|A {{survey of}} 1000 {{secondary}} school pupils and university students in Tayside conducted in February 2010 found 20% {{of them had}} previously taken mephedrone. Although {{at the time it}} was available legally over the internet, only 10% of users reported purchasing it online, with most purchasing it from street dealers. Of those who had used mephedrone, 97% said it was easy or <b>very</b> <b>easy</b> to obtain. Around 50% of users reported at least one negative effect associated with the use of mephedrone, of which teeth grinding is the most common. Detailed interviews with users in Northern Ireland similarly found that few purchased mephedrone online, with most interviewees citing concerns that their address would be traced or that family members could intercept the package.|$|E
5|$|I'll {{say that}} the Ukrainian people treated me well. I recall warmly the years I spent there. This was a period full of responsibilities, but {{pleasant}} because it brought satisfaction... But far be it from me to inflate my significance. The entire Ukrainian people was exerting great efforts... I attribute Ukraine's successes to the Ukrainian people as a whole. I won't elaborate further on this theme, but in principle it's <b>very</b> <b>easy</b> to demonstrate. I'm Russian myself, and I don't want to offend the Russians.|$|E

5|$|In 1956, {{the test}} program was {{transferred}} to Fort Eustis, Virginia, where Captain Selmer Sundby took over test-flying duties. The HZ-1 had been designed to be <b>very</b> <b>easy</b> to fly, and early testing indicated that untrained soldiers could learn to operate the craft in less than 20 minutes, and some claiming that only five minutes of instruction were required. In addition, the HZ-1 proved to be faster than other flying platform designs evaluated by the Army. Sundby, however, quickly determined that the craft was {{much more difficult to}} fly than had been expected, and would not be safe {{in the hands of an}} inexperienced pilot. In addition, the low-mounted rotors proved to be prone to kicking up small rocks and other debris.|$|E
5|$|Silver, he writes, {{does not}} occur in native form {{and has to be}} mined, usually {{occurring}} with lead ores. Spain produced the most silver in his time, many of the mines having been started by Hannibal. One of the largest had galleries running up to two miles into the mountain, while men worked day and night draining the mine in shifts. Pliny is probably referring to the reverse overshot water-wheels operated by treadmill and found in Roman mines. Britain, he says, is very rich in lead, which is found on the surface at many places, and thus <b>very</b> <b>easy</b> to extract; production was so high that a law was passed attempting to restrict mining.|$|E
5|$|The tests {{revealed}} {{a number of}} problems in that the thick wing inherited from the Yak-3 limited the top speed of the aircraft, the engine exhaust damaged the surface of the airfield, the cockpit often filled with smoke from kerosene and oil that had dripped onto the engine, and the aircraft was very short-ranged. Despite these problems, the Yak-15 proved to be <b>very</b> <b>easy</b> to fly, even for pilots accustomed to piston-engined fighters, and caused the VVS to accept the fighter as a conversion trainer.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we use the}} exp-function {{method to}} {{construct}} some new soliton solutions of the Benjamin–Bona–Mahony and modified Benjamin–Bona–Mahony equations. These equations have important and fundamental applications in mathematical physics and engineering sciences. The exp-function method is used to find the soliton solution of a wide class of nonlinear evolution equations with symbolic computation. This method provides the concise and straightforward solution in a <b>very</b> <b>easier</b> way. The results obtained in this paper {{can be viewed as}} a refinement and improvement of the previously known results...|$|R

The paintings' backdrop is prepared from red or yellow ochre earth which is then painted over using brushes fashioned from tender bamboo shoots. Ikons use natural dyes and chromes derived from ground white stone, hued earth, and vermilion and mixtures of tamarind seed, flower and leaf extracts.|$|R

5|$|Ikaruga was {{targeted}} to Treasure's core fanbase, as pleasing {{them was the}} team's first priority. Although the game was primarily being developed for the Sega NAOMI arcade platform, it was standard for NAOMI games to be ported to the Dreamcast, and so the development team had this in mind. The NAOMI version was bug checked on a Dreamcast, so porting was <b>very</b> <b>easy.</b> Ikaruga was first released in arcades in Japan on 20 December 2001. A Dreamcast port was released exclusively in Japan on 5 September 2002. Although not yet published in the West, Ikaruga began to garner a cult following in North America among import gamers. On 16 January 2003, Infogrames published Ikaruga for the GameCube in Japan under their Atari label. Later that month Infogrames confirmed the GameCube version of Ikaruga would come to North America and Europe, with Infogrames representatives citing the popularity of Ikaruga in Japan and growing fan base around the world. The game was finally released on 15 April 2003 In North America and 9 May 2003 in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The Silkie (sometimes spelled Silky) is a {{breed of}} chicken {{named for its}} atypically fluffy plumage, which is said to feel like silk, and satin. The breed has several other unusual qualities, such as black skin and bones, blue earlobes, and five toes on each foot, whereas most {{chickens}} only have four. They are often exhibited in poultry shows, and appear in various colors. In addition to their distinctive physical characteristics, Silkies are well known for their calm, friendly temperament. It {{is among the most}} docile of poultry. Hens are also exceptionally broody, and care for young well. Though they are fair layers themselves, laying only about three eggs a week, they are commonly used to hatch eggs from other breeds and bird species due to their broody nature. Silkie chickens are <b>very</b> <b>easy</b> to keep as pets. They are suitable for children, as they can easily withstand being roughly handled.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{numbers of}} Catholic {{refugees}} {{came from the}} two northern dioceses with {{the highest percentage of}} Catholics in Vietnam. These were Phát Diêm and Bùi Chu, mainly located in modern-day Ninh Bình and Nam Định Provinces respectively. The bishops of the dioceses, had been strident opponents of the communists, and both had organised Catholic paramilitary groups that fought against the Viet Minh, which had long identified Catholics with colonial collaborationism. When the communists had gained the upper hand in the north, many Catholics had already begun making preparations to move to the south, where the communists were less influential, and large movements began immediately when news of the partition came through. After the defeat of French Union forces at Dien Bien Phu, French officers had evacuated their troops from Bui Chu and Phat Diem to reinforce the area between Hanoi and Haiphong which they still controlled, making it <b>very</b> <b>easy</b> for the communists to progress through the Catholic strongholds.|$|E

5|$|The Cleveland Bay {{generally}} {{stands between}} , and is always bay in colour. Bright bay horses (bays {{with a more}} reddish tint than normal) are the most preferred by breeders, followed by ordinary bay, dark bay and then light bay. This preference for brighter shades of bay was originally stated in the official breed standard, although this stipulation has since been removed. In some bloodlines of the breed, light, grayish hairs in the mane and tail are known as a characteristic of pure blood. White markings, except for a small star on the forehead, render the horse inadmissible to the stud book. Horses {{are expected to have}} complete black points, including completely black lower legs. Legs that are red below the knees and hocks are considered faulty in colour, although they do not disqualify a horse from registry. The occasional red legs that appear in the breed are thought to come from chestnut Thoroughbred stallions that were crossed into Cleveland Bay and Yorkshire Coach Horse bloodlines at some points in the history of both breeds. The uniformity in colour is encouraged as it makes creating matching driving teams and pairs <b>very</b> <b>easy.</b> When the breed was first developed, the horses almost always had a countershaded dorsal stripe, but these disappeared with the outcrossings of the 18th century.|$|E
