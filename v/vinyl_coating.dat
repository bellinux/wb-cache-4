40|$|The {{permanence}} of large format, outdoor inkjet signs {{is a concern}} for many advertisers and companies creating signs that will be displayed for years or months in such an environment. The permanence industry has focused their research on using equipment to simulate these outdoor conditions the prints face to gauge their fading properties. This research took a more direct approach by placing the prints in an actual outdoor environment and tracking the rate of color change (∆Eab), and the environmental variables. A multiple regression {{analysis of the data}} was then used to create prediction models and to eliminate environmental variables which did not affect the fading. The multiple regression analysis was able to create a prediction model for only two of the patches tested on one of the substrates. The test included three substrates (uncoated <b>vinyl,</b> <b>coated</b> <b>vinyl</b> and Tyvek (DuPont)) and ten color patches (cyan, magenta, yellow, black, red, green, blue, two grays, and plain substrate). The successful models were for the measured substrate patch and the cyan patch on the ESM (uncoated vinyl) substrate. The model showed that the substrate patch was affected by the average high and low temperatures and by the amount of time exposed in weeks. A second model showed that the cyan patch on the ESM substrate was affected by the UV index and the amount of time exposed in weeks. Further examination of the study showed that the ESM substrate was the most stable under the experiment conditions out of the three substrates. Cyan ink was the least stable ink on the Tyvek (DuPont) and <b>coated</b> <b>vinyl</b> and that the coatings on the substrates play a role in their ability to maintain color integrity of the print...|$|R
40|$|Temperature cables {{restrained}} from lateral movement, {{were measured}} {{as a function}} of grain height, cable location and surface coating. For the restrained conditions, the cable forces were one to nine times those previously measured for unrestrained cables. The large load increase on the restrained cables is believed to be caused by the flow profile which existed at each of the three different cable locations. The flow profile at the center cable is predominantly vertical and the forces in the restrained condition resembled those in the unrestrained condition. For the two outer cable locations, both vertical and lateral force components exist {{because of the nature of}} the discharging grain at these two different locations. For the restrained condition, the largest forces occurred on the cable located at the middle position. For the unrestrained condition, the largest forces occurred on the cable located at the wall position. Surface coatings on the cable had an effect on the magnitude of the forces. Forces on <b>vinyl</b> <b>coated</b> cables were significantly larger than either the nylon or HDLE polyethylene coated cables in the restrained condition...|$|R
40|$|Original article can {{be found}} at : [URL] Copyright ElsevierA {{particle}} engineering method that adsorbs a microfine <b>vinyl</b> polymer <b>coat</b> to crystalline drug microparticles {{has been shown to be}} an effective way to control delivery. However, the means by which the functional performance of such microparticles is altered by the behaviour of the polymers in the microparticle coat remains unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of <b>vinyl</b> polymer <b>coating</b> on the in vitro delivery characteristics of intranasal lorazepam microparticles. A series of four, similarly sized (ca. 10 ??m), lorazepam-rich microparticles with different polymer coats were generated. The absorption of the polymer coats appeared to disrupt lorazepam solid state dimer formation in the microparticles, which manifested in a reduction in drug melting point. Mildly cohesive particles (aerodynamic diameter of 32 ??m) that allowed rapid drug release (ca. 80 % in 5 min) were generated when partially hydrolysed PVA dominated the microparticle coat, whilst fully hydrolysed PVA reduced particle cohesion and retarded drug release (ca. 15 % release in 5 min). Infrared analysis showed that the properties of the microparticles were dictated by the strength of the hydrogen bonding in the polymer coat and not the strength of coat adsorption that was facilitated by hydrogen bond formation between the hydroxyl groups of the PVA and the hydroxyl group at position C 3 of the lorazepam diazepine ring...|$|R

40|$|The {{awareness}} of increasing water pollution implies studies concerning water treatment. Removal of heavy metals from industrial wastewater is of primary importance 1. With a {{rapid increase in}} global industrial activities, pollution derived from the uncontrolled escape of heavy metals such as copper, nickel, chromium and zinc has become serious.

40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate the relationship between the peel force required to remove the medical adhesive tapes and the angle of peel. Method : Three kinds of adhesive tapes to fix gauze, 25 mm in width and 125 mm in length (Tape A, B and C) were stuck on a bakelite board for 30 minutes, and then removed while the peel forces were recorded. Peel force measurements were obtained at 30 °, 60 °, 90 °, 120 °, 150 °, and 170 °. Tape A was rayon non-woven fabric coated with an acrylic adhesive. Tape B was poly <b>vinyl</b> chloride tape <b>coated</b> with a rubber adhesive. Tape C was polyethylene film coated with an acrylic adhesive. Results: For all tapes used, the maximal peel force occurred at peel angle 30 °. The peel forces at 30 ° were three times the minimal peel forces which were observed at 90 ° to 120 ° for Tape A, 120 ° to 170 ° for Tape B, and 90 ° to 150 ° for Tape C. Conclusion : These findings suggest that a peel angle near 120 ° might be commonly good for less irritation...|$|R
40|$|A {{prefabricated}} building was designed in 1965 by the Committee for Antarctic Buildings and built in 1966 at Syowa Station. This building is of box-frame structure, {{which can be}} easily assembled in short time for multi-purpose establishment in the Antarctic area, such as sleeping quarters, mess hut, laboratory, etc. Therefore, even expedition members without any experiences in such construction are able to put it together. With the said building, thickness of the panel and its weight are exceptionally much more {{than those of the}} standard type, since the building is expected to accommodate deep frozen food as a cold storage. Of course, there is no changes in basic design. The outline of this building for cold storage is as follows : [table] Each panel contains insulation material of 100 mm thick which is sandwiched by water-proof plywood. Exterior surface of the panel is covered with stainless steel sheet and in-terior is lined with <b>vinyl</b> resin <b>coated</b> steel sheet. This {{prefabricated building}} has the following features : 1. For the jointed part of each corner of the structure, the unique prefabricated Lshaped corner-wall is employed. Since it is manufactured under a standard size, other components of the establishment, such as roof, floor, and side-wall can also be standardized. Besides, such tightly fastened prefabricated corner completely eliminates the fundamental weakpoint that has been unavoidable so far withstanding shock and tortion. 2. As for the jointing method of two panels, a long sized bolt of 13 φ is tightly screwed across the both adjacent frames, thus the surface of the both frames being tightly put together each other. In this method, only the bolting at two points in a panel substitutes for the traditional connecting method that is less endurable against shock and tortion. 3. Each jointed surface of the panel is finished with foamed chloroprene rubber, so that the gaps at the jointed surface can be completely eliminated. This foamed rubber lining has another merit that the elasticity of the rubber makes the errors characteristic to the assembly of the customary prefabricated structure practically ignorable...|$|R
