50|$|Tartan is {{made with}} {{alternating}} bands of coloured (pre-dyed) threads woven as both warp and weft {{at right angles to}} each other. The weft is woven in a simple twill, two over—two under the warp, advancing one thread at each pass. This forms <b>visible</b> <b>diagonal</b> lines where different colours cross, which give the appearance of new colours blended from the original ones. The resulting blocks of colour repeat vertically and horizontally in a distinctive pattern of squares and lines known as a sett.|$|E

This church building has {{stood on the}} site for almost nine hundred years, although there {{may well have been}} a church already on the site, as the remnants of an Anglo Saxon sun-dial is <b>visible</b> on the <b>diagonal</b> buttress on the south-east corner of the chancel. The church was built by William FitzOsbern, who came over with William the Conqueror.|$|R
5000|$|Hinckley has {{a history}} going back to Anglo-Saxon times; the name Hinckley is Anglo Saxon: [...] "Hinck" [...] is someone's name and [...] "ley" [...] is a meadow. By {{the time of the}} Domesday Book in 1086, Hinckley was quite a large village, and grew over the {{following}} 200 years into a small market town—a market was first recorded there in 1311. There is evidence of an Anglo Saxon church - the remnants of an Anglo Saxon sun-dial being <b>visible</b> on the <b>diagonal</b> buttress on the south-east corner of the chancel.|$|R
50|$|A total {{solar eclipse}} {{occurred}} on June 16, 1806. A solar eclipse {{occurs when the}} Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby totally or partly obscuring {{the image of the}} Sun for a viewer on Earth. A total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's apparent diameter is larger than the Sun's, blocking all direct sunlight, turning day into darkness. Totality occurs in a narrow path across Earth's surface, with the partial solar eclipse visible over a surrounding region thousands of kilometres wide.Totality was <b>visible</b> in a <b>diagonal</b> path across the United States, and ended in North Africa.|$|R

A stripe is bleached {{perpendicular to the}} A–P axis as indicated (vertical black bar). A fluorescence profile along the A–P axis (orange box) is then measured over time to generate a kymograph. If there is directed motion, the bleached region will be displaced over time (Flow). If not, recovery should occur uniformly with {{the center of the}} bleach area remaining stationary (No Flow). (B) Line FRAP was performed on GFP–PAR- 2 – or GFP–PAR- 6 –expressing embryos during either the onset or maintenance phase. During onset, kymographs reveal anterior translocation of the bleach region. In the case of PAR- 6, bright, moving puncta are also <b>visible</b> as <b>diagonal</b> lines. In contrast, during the maintenance phase, no such translocation of the bleach area or bright foci is seen. Total time after bleaching is indicated. Figure S 2. PAR gradients in latrunculin A–treated embryos. As in Fig. 4 D, PAR distributions were measured several minutes after treatment with latrunculin A. Mean ± SD (n = 8 anterior to posterior profiles) is shown. Note that the positive distance is toward the anterior from the posterior pole. At midcell, proteins localize to opposing spatial gradients, which overlap (shaded yellow region). Lateral diffusion of PAR proteins • Goehring et al. S 1 Figure S 3. PAR proteins associate with expanding bleb membranes. To examine how PAR proteins respond to an acute loss of actomyosin cortical integrity, we took advantage of the ability of partial pod- 1 (RNAi) to induce membrane blebs in one-cell embryos (Rappleye et al., 1999). Blebs are thought to be caused by defects in the actomyosin cortical network, which result in transient detachment of the membrane from the underlying cytoskeletal network (Charras et al., 2006; Paluch et al., 2006). This membrane initially expands as a result of hydrostatic pressure. Expansion ultimately stalls as actomyosi...|$|R
40|$|The Holocene, Upper Pleistocene and Middle Pleistocene sediments in {{the eastern}} part of the Drava {{depression}} the substratum of which is determined by the conditional EK marker Q 2 ̆ 7, are composed in the lower part mainly of silts and clays and in the upper part of sands. The thickest parts are about 400 m. The composition of the transparent heavy minerals and the result of the paleontological treatment show that the sedimentation was in the lake or swamp with the origin of detritus from the metamorphic rocks and smaller quantity of older clastic sediments. The collected data show the quaternary tectonic activity after the sedimentation of the marker horizon Q 2 ̆ 7. In the area between the boundary faults of the valley, the faults of the system E. N. E. - W. S. W. (N. E. - S. W.) influenced directly the sedimentation and the folding. They were the consequence of the regional movements and stress strain behaviour of rock masses, which built the structures of the valley. As a result, the horizontal component of the left wing movement is <b>visible</b> along the <b>diagonal</b> system of faults. The vertical movements have also been determined. The greatest amplitudes were along the boundary South fault of the Drava valley, up to 350 m for the period of Middle and Upper Pleistocene, or 90 m for Upper Pleistocene only...|$|R
40|$|This study {{critically}} {{investigates the}} material and structural behaviour of Aer-Tech material. Aer- Tech material is composed of 10 % by volume of foam mechanically entrapped in a plastic mortar. The research study showed that {{the density of the}} material mix controls all other properties such as fresh state properties, mechanical properties, functional properties and acoustic properties. Appreciably, the research had confirmed that Aer-Tech material despite being classified as a light weight material had given high compressive strength of about 33. 91 N/mm 2. The compressive strength characteristics of Aer-Tech material make the material a potential cost effective construction material, comparable to conventional concrete. The material also showed through this study that it is a structural effective material with its singly reinforced beam giving ultimate moment of about 38. 7 KN. In addition, the Aer-Tech material is seen as a very good ductile material since, the singly reinforced beam in tension showed <b>visible</b> signs of <b>diagonal</b> vertical cracks long before impending rapture. Consequently, the SEM test and the neural network model predictions, carried out had showed how billions of closely tight air cells are evenly distributed within the Aer-Tech void system as well as the close prediction of NN model for compressive strength and density are same with the experimental results of compressive strength and density. The result shows that the Aer-Tech NN-model can simulate inputs data and predicts their corresponding output data...|$|R
