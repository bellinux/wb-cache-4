Seaside {{operations}} at container ports often suffer from uncertainty due to {{events such as}} the variation in arrival and/or processing time of vessels, weather conditions and others.

It is then solved exactly and approximately. Experimental results show that only small instances of the proposed model can be solved exactly. To handle large instances in reasonable times, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used. However, it does not guarantee optimality and often the approximate solutions returned are of low quality. A hybrid meta-heuristic which combines Branch-and- Cut (B & C) as implemented in CPLEX, with the GA as we implement it here, is therefore suggested.

40|$|The {{offshore}} {{industry is}} a dynamic industry with constant demand changes. This creates many challenges, one of them being logistical supply planning. The need changes fast and this makes it important to receive the deliveries when required. If not, the consequences can be severe and costly. The supply chain may experience disruptions that may cause delays of lesser or greater extent. If possible, delay reducing measures may be taken to reduce this delay to an acceptable level. There are many existing optimization tools for this purpose, {{but they are very}} extensive and have a long lead. The purpose of this thesis is to start a process towards developing an operational rescheduling simulator that is easier, faster and more user-friendly than the existing optimization tools. The first part of the thesis considered a study over planning-and disruption challenges in the offshore supply chain. Statistics from Statoil were analyzed and it showed that quite a few disruptions happened before <b>vessel</b> <b>departure</b> from the base. Measures for reducing delays to an acceptable level are taken here. The most used measures are extra treatment on base, extra call on route and helicopter delivery. Transit is the segment where most delays occur; this is mainly due to weather situations. The delays under installation treatment (loading operations) were negligible. It is also at the installations the most severe consequences may occur. This is a result of multiple delays and failures in safety system, functions and barriers. Furthermore, a thorough and comprehensive event- and risk analysis was performed for the purpose of identifying the major disruption contributors in the chain and their direct and secondary consequences. The information retrieved in this analysis was combined with the Statoil case and used to define accurate event frequencies for the uncovered disruptions. The second part of the thesis contains the construction of a simulation model that imitates the daily operation in the offshore supply chain where disruptions occur and creates delays. Measures to reduce these delays were also implemented. The risk profile from part one was used in the simulator {{in order to create a}} reliable imitation of an offshore supply chain. The model was based on a fixed route, and does therefore not include all delay reducing measures. The model gives a good demonstration of the daily flow in the supply chain, but implemented simplifications weaken the level of realism in the model. Special consideration should be taken in terms of changing the impact calculation method of the model. To make a simulator that will cover all characteristics uncovered in part one requires careful preparations, good programming skills and time. The extent of such a model exceeds the capacity of this thesis in all requirements mentioned above. In the areas where the model is insufficient, measures for further development have been proposed. The model presented in this thesis is merely a prototype with the purpose of demonstrating the mindset of the author and create a solid basis for further simulator development. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{assessment}} of port marine operations performance {{by means of}} simulation is treated in this master thesis project. The navigational services provided to vessel at the access channels, from their arrival to the berthing operations and from unberthing to <b>vessels</b> <b>departure,</b> are investigated and evaluated. In the case study, FlexSim is used as the simulation tool. Since no previous marine operations performance assessment using FlexSim were found in literature, its application for this purpose is tested and evaluated. From the literature review, it is concluded that {{despite the fact that}} the use of logistic simulation models is increasing, and many practical applications are identified, the number of publications and academic studies is still limited. By describing extensively the methods used in this graduation project, it is expected that though a case study is analysed, the given research approach can be adapted and harnessed in other problems with similar aims. Case Study - The Port of Jebel Dhanna/Ruwais The production of Abu Dhabi National Oil Company is expected to increase and new terminals are planned at the Port of Jebel Dhanna/Ruwais in order to cope with this progress. The marine traffic is expected to be almost doubled from 2014 to 2030. The approach channels to the port are relatively long and occasionally limited in width and depth. Some sections are restricted to one-way traffic and priority is given to outgoing vessels. Additionally, tidal windows are imposed to deep draught vessels in depth restricted sections. With the expected increase in marine traffic, it is possible that congestion of the access channel will become a limiting factor. The evolution of the Port of Jebel Dhanna/Ruwais marine operations performance from 2014 to 2030 is evaluated based on FlexSim results. The conclusion is that performance is acceptable for the forecasted 2030 traffic and no real bottleneck at the access channels is identified; the berth unavailability is the main cause of delay. In order to be able to identify the marine operations bottleneck, the traffic is artificially increased. For the simulated fleet mix, the performance of the marine operations reaches an unacceptable level when 900 vessels per year are added to the 2030 forecast. The existing infrastructure is unable to cope with the demand when 1200 vessels per year are added to the 2030 forecast. In order to make it possible for the port to handle these 1200 extra vessels, three interventions are proposed: routing three vessel classes instead of one through a secondary channel; deepening one of the one-way sections; and widening one of the one-way sections. Six measures, formed by the combination of the three interventions are simulated. The most effective measure is the combination of the three of them; however, each measure has a different cost related to it; therefore, only a cost benefit analysis can indicate the best alternative. FlexSim Evaluation After performing all simulations involved in the graduation work, the FlexSim simulation software is considered to be adequate to perform port marine operations simulations. Realistic results are obtained with more than acceptable simulation times and with a moderate time for implementation, which decreases with the modeller increasing experience. However, the possibility of using default FlexSim functions for implementing the traffic regulations would be appreciated.

40|$|The berth {{scheduling}} problem {{deals with the}} assignment of vessels to berths in a marine terminal, with the objective to maximize the ocean carriers’ satisfaction (minimize delays) and/or minimize the terminal operator's costs. In the existing literature, two main assumptions are made regarding {{the status of a}} vessel: (a) either all vessels to be served are already in the port before the planning period starts, or (b) they are scheduled to arrive after the planning period starts. The latter case assumes an expected time of arrival for each vessel, which {{is a function of the}} departure time of the vessel from the previous port, the average operating speed and the distance between the two ports. Recent increases in fuel prices have forced ocean carriers to reduce current operating speeds, while stressing to terminal operators the need to maintain the integrity of their schedule. In addition, several collaborative efforts between industry and government agencies have been proposed, aiming to reduce emissions from marine vessels and port operations. In light of these issues, this article presents a berth-scheduling policy to minimize <b>vessel</b> delayed <b>departures</b> and indirectly reduce fuel consumption and emissions produced by the vessels while in idle mode. Vessel arrival times are considered as a variable and are optimized to accommodate the objectives of the proposed policy while providing ocean carriers with an optimized vessel speed. Example problems using real data show that the proposed policy reduces the amount of emissions produced by vessels at the port in idle mode, optimizes fuel consumption and waiting time at the port by reducing vessel operating speeds to optimal levels and minimizes the effects of late arrivals to the ocean carriers’ schedule. ...|$|R
