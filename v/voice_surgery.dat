Study design: Non-randomized, prospective. Methods: Forty-six patients operated for benign laryngeal lesions were enrolled in the present study. All patients were assessed according to the European Laryngological Society (ELS) guidelines. In terms of self-evaluation, patients answered the Greek versions of both VHI and VoiSS, pre- and 6 weeks postoperatively and the results were statistically analyzed. Results: The strongest correlation was observed between the functional subscale of VHI and the impairment subscale of VoiSS, as well as, between the emotional subscales of both VHI and VoiSS, preand post-operatively. A statistical significant change in subscale scores, as well as in total score, was found. VHI and VoiSS subscales and total scores correlated with the stroboscopic and aerodynamic measurements in a variable manner.

40|$|Acoustic {{measures}} have been extensively studied, {{in terms of their}} relation with laryngeal pathology, the perceptual severity of dysphonia and the outcome of interventions (surgical and conservative), {{as well as the other}} measures of vocal performance, and the results have been controversial. In the present study, patients, operated for benign laryngeal lesions with microlaryngoscopy were included. They were assessed according to the protocol, proposed by the European Laryngological Society (Dejonkere et al, 2001) with stroboscopy, perceptual analysis, voice analysis, aerodynamic measurements and subjective evaluation questionnaires, before and after the operation. In the first part of the study, the role of the Greek version of Voice Handicap Index (VHI) was studied, in comparison with the Voice Symptom Scale (VoiSS) in terms of measuring <b>voice</b> <b>surgery</b> outcome. A statistical significant change in subscale scores, as well as in total score, was found. VHI and VoiSS correlated strongly to each other. Both VHI and VoiSS correlated with perceptual characteristics before and after the operation. Among acoustic measures, Harmonic-to-Noise Ratio (HNR) and shimmer, showed significant correlation with both VHI and VoiSS subscale and total scores, post-operatively. None of the two, however, correlated with stroboscopic, and aerodynamic measurements. VHI and VoiSS were considered useful tools in evaluating <b>voice</b> <b>surgery</b> outcome, in the Greek language. In the second part of the study, acoustic measurements (jitter, shimmer, HNR, NHR) by two commercially available analysis programs, Praat and MDVP were compared, in terms of independent information they provide, and the influence of parameters such as gender, SPL, as well the data acquisition system. Moreover, the relationships between acoustic measurements and the other measures of vocal assessment, especially perception and VHI, were studied with correlation coefficients, as well as with Mutual Information analysis. All measurements changed significantly postoperatively, except for F 0. The results were dispersed among individuals, as not all patients had pathological measurements preoperatively, neither improved in all measurements postoperatively. The two programs seemed to correlate in the majority of cases, MDVP measuring higher values. Noise measures from Praat were observed to correlate the most with perceptual parameters (GRBAS scale).

40|$|Purpose: The {{outcome of}} <b>voice</b> <b>surgery</b> on {{unilateral}} vocal cord paralysis (UVCP) by medialization laryngoplasty (ML) was various although {{the series of}} reports consistently claimed that the phonation ability restored well after their reconstructive surgery. We revised several unsatisfactory subjects and proposed a correct concept to facilitate a successful surgery. Patients and Methods: One hundred and forty subjects suffering from UVCP and undergoing ML procedure were reviewed. Eight of the 140 subjects underwent revised thyroplasty to improve their unsatisfactory voice. The time elapse from UVCP onset to first ML procedure and between first and second ML procedure was recorded and analyzed. Maximal phonation time (MPT) {{was used to evaluate}} the improvement of phonation ability. Result: Inappropriate size or location of the implant material were defined in two subjects, inappropriate management of the inner perichondrium of thyroid lamina (IPTL) were defined in 5, and cricoarytenoid joint (CAJ) fixation in one. MPT was increased from 3 s to 11 s in average after revised surgery. MPT more than 10 s was obtained in 7 subjects in their followup at mean 15 months.

40|$|Background:Obese {{people often}} have altered {{breathing}} patterns and therefore may experience difficulties in voice production. Aim: To verify {{the presence of}} vocal complaints and {{the correlation between the}} auditory-perceptual analysis of voice and vocal self-assessment of a group of women with morbid obesity before and after bariatric surgery. Methods: A longitudinal, exploratory, descriptive study of 21 morbidly obese women aged between 28 and 68 years, assessed before and after bariatric surgery, was performed. The women filled out a form containing identification data and type of vocal complaint. Perceptual evaluation of voice and vocal self-assessment were performed using a visual analog scale. For perceptual assessment of voice the women were asked to say three sentences from the Consensus Auditory-Perceptual Evaluation of Voice. Results: Of the 21 patients, 14 (66. 6 %) reported vocal complaints, of which 10 (71 %) vocal fatigue, eight (57. 14 %) voice failures and seven (50 %) vocal effort. All participants reported improvements in the <b>voice</b> after <b>surgery,</b> irrespective of having reported vocal complaints before surgery. There was no correlation between vocal self-assessment and auditory-perceptual assessment of the voice before or after the procedure. There was no correlation between vocal self-assessment and perceptual evaluation of the <b>voice</b> before <b>surgery.</b> Conclusion: Obesity interfered with voice production and influenced negative perception and therefore vocal complaints.

40|$|The {{human voice}} is an {{important}} indicator of a person's gender. For male-to-female transgender individuals (or transsexuals) the voice {{is one of the}} most difficult parts of the gender transition. Males have larger and heavier vocal apparatuses (larynx and vocal folds), which generally produce a lower sound. Transgender women can have <b>voice</b> <b>surgery,</b> but it can sometimes cause a Minnie Mouse-like falsetto or the complete loss of the voice. As a result, many transgendered women turn to specially trained voice therapists to learn how to speak more convincingly like women. The voice's pitch, although important, is not the only factor in creating a more female sound. Intonation, resonance, volume, speech patterns and formant frequencies also play significant roles in making a realistic feminine sound. There continue to be many unanswered questions about how listeners perceive the voices of transgender women and how best to blend the voices of transwomen into a comfortable range. Transgender women have many hurdles to face as they transition from male to female, and possessing an authentic voice is a way to smooth out the bumpy path they face. by Katharine Stoel Gammon.

30|$|A total {{laryngectomy}} is a surgical procedure which consists {{in a complete}} removal of the larynx {{for the treatment of}} a cancer for example. Thus, the patient loses his/her vocal cords that allowed him/her a laryngeal <b>voice.</b> After <b>surgery,</b> some patients may waive any oral communication attempt because of the physical and mental bouleversement caused by the surgical act. Indeed, the anatomical changes deprive temporarily the patient of his/her voice. Only the whispered voice allows communication in a postoperative life. An alternative speaking rehabilitation method allows him/her to get a new voice called esophageal speech (ES) generated without vocal folds. The air from the lungs, original source of all human speech, no longer passes through the cavities of the phonatory apparatus. It is released directly from the stomach through the esophagus. The features of esophageal speech such as the envelope of the waveform and the spectral components differ from the features extracted from natural speech. Furthermore, the esophageal speech is characterized by specific noises and low intelligibility; the fundamental frequency of this voice is less stable than that of laryngeal voice. All these aspects cause a production of a hoarse, creaky and unnatural voice, difficult to understand.|$|R

Two UK voice clinics. One hundred and forty-four patients referred for treatment of benign voice disorders, 90 undergoing voice therapy and 54 undergoing laryngeal microsurgery. Three measures of self-reported voice quality (the vocal performance questionnaire, the voice handicap index and the voice symptom scale), plus the short form 36 (SF 36) general health status measure and the hospital anxiety and depression score. Perceptual, observer-rated analysis of voice quality was performed using the grade–roughness–breathiness–asthenia–strain scale. We compared the effect sizes (i. e. responsiveness to change) of the principal subscales of all measures before and after voice therapy or phonosurgery. All three self-reported voice measures had large effect sizes following either <b>voice</b> therapy or <b>surgery.</b> Outcomes were similar in both treatment groups. The effect sizes for the observer-rated grade–roughness–breathiness–asthenia–strain scale scores were smaller, although still moderate.

50|$|Dysphonia can be {{categorized}} into two broad main types: organic and functional. The type of dysphonia {{is dependent on the}} cause of the pathology. While the causes of dysphonia can be divided into five basic categories, all of them result in an interruption of the ability of the vocal folds to vibrate normally during exhalation, which affects the voice. The assessment and diagnosis of dysphonia is done by a multidisciplinary team, and involves the use of a variety of subjective and objective measures, which look at both the quality of the voice as well as the physical state of the larynx. Multiple treatments have been developed to address organic and functional causes of dysphonia. Dysphonia can be targeted through direct therapy, indirect therapy, medical treatments, and surgery.

40|$|Invasion of {{laryngeal}} cartilage {{has long}} been considered as a contraindication to radiation treatment and to all types of conservation surgery. With the advent of axial imaging techniques clarification of the submucosal extent of disease became possible. However, controversies regarding diagnosis (preferred modality, accuracy of detection of cartilage invasion) and treatment of cartilage invasion (Is cartilage invasion really a contraindication for irradiation treatment?) arose. Based on currently accepted criteria, CT {{appears to be more}} specific in detecting neoplastic cartilage invasion than MRI, but tends to underestimate invasion and may therefore result in undertreatment. Magnetic resonance has a higher sensitivity than CT for detection of cartilage invasion. The superiority of MRI lies in its ability to detect intracartilaginous tumor spread. Unfortunately, MR findings suggesting neoplastic cartilage invasion may be false positive in a considerable number of instances. Two MRI-dependent parameters appear to be significant as a prognostic factor for success of radiation therapy: tumor volume and abnormal MR signal pattern in cartilage. Minimal abnormal MR signal patterns in cartilage in patients with small tumors (under 5 cc) {{does not appear to be}} a very ominous finding for tumor recurrence after radiation therapy. On the other hand, abnormal MR signal pattern in cartilage combined with large tumor volume (above 5 cc) appears to worsen the prognosis significantly. If <b>voice</b> conservation <b>surgery</b> is being considered, MR imaging is useful for assessing those structures (such as cartilages) whose involvement would contraindicate partial laryngectomy. Magnetic resonance imaging appears to be the optimal method of examination in cooperative patients. If MRI fails or if it is contra-indicated, CT may still be recommended.

ObjectivesTo compare the use of silastic implant with titanium vocal fold medializing implant (TVFMI®) in type I thyroplasty for unilateral vocal cord palsy with respect to subjective and objective improvement in voice, endoscopic changes in vocal cords, surgical time, and cost effectiveness. MethodologyThis was a prospective study conducted on 40 patients with unilateral vocal cord paralysis who underwent type I thyroplasty with either silastic implant or TVFMI®. Pre-operative and four-week post-operative assessment and statistical comparison were performed by videolaryngoscopy, stroboscopy, perceptual assessment (GRBAS), subjective (voice handicap index) analysis of voice, and computer-assisted acoustic and electroglottographic assessment. The duration of surgery and cost of implant were also recorded. ResultsAlthough both implants showed improvement in quality of voice following thyroplasty, TVFMI® presents slightly better results in objective <b>voice</b> analysis. The <b>surgery</b> time for TVFMI® insertion was shorter, but the costs were higher. ConclusionTVFMI® may be preferred for medialization thyroplasty as it presents better voice results and demands less surgical time; however, it is costlier than silastic implant. © 2014 Associação Brasileira de Otorrinolaringologia e Cirurgia Cérvico-Facial.

In 2004, the first endowed Chair in Laryngeal Surgery at Harvard Medical School was created for him while he re-established a Harvard Laryngeal Surgery service at the MGH, which had not been present since the 1920s. He {{has received more than}} 75 awards and honored lectureships for his achievements including the Casselberry Award, DeRoaldes Medal and the Newcomb Award from the American Laryngological Association (founded in 1879). Zeitels was the 4th surgeon in the organization's history to win all three awards. He has also received the Chevalier Jackson Award and the annual Broyles Maloney Award (3 times) from the American Broncho-Esophageal Association (founded in 1917), as well as the Distinguished Alumnus Award from the Boston University (BU) School of Medicine in 2007. Zeitels is also well known for performing complex microsurgery to restore the voices of performing vocalists and has done so on 15 Grammy award winning artists.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{conduct a}} {{prospective}} randomized controlled trial describing and investigating the efficacy {{and safety of}} radiosurgical excision of benign superficial vocal fold lesions. Materials and methods: Fifty patients with benign superficial vocal fold lesions (20 vocal nodules, 27 vocal polyps and three Reinke’s oedema) who failed conservative therapy {{were included in the}} study. They were equally randomized into cold knife or radiosurgical excision. Clinical and voice assessments were done pre-operatively and after <b>surgery.</b> <b>Voice</b> analysis included a subjective visual analogue scale (VAS) and a perceptual assessment with a simplified version of the GRBAS scale (GRB) consisting of G (grade), R (roughness), and B (breathiness). Acoustic voice evaluation included jitter and shimmer. Post-operative voice therapy was provided for all patients. Complications, smoothness of post-operative recovery, and administration of analgesia were reported. Results: Both groups experienced significant improvement in VAS, perceptual evaluation and acoustic analysis after surgery, with no evidence of significant differences between the cold knife and radiofrequency groups. The radiofrequency group showed a decrease of 17 per cent in the mean operative time when compared with the cold knife group, but this was not statistically significant. No evidence of a significant difference was noticed in the smoothness of post-operative recovery, administration of analgesia and complication rate. Conclusion: Radiophonosurgery opens a new therapeutic approach for patients with benign superficial vocal fold lesions. It combines the advantages of both cold knife and laser phonosurgery, being easy, safe, precise and effective, and having excellent tactile and haemostatic properties...|$|R
