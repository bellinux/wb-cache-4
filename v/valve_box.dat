50|$|The twenty {{locomotives}} {{incorporated a}} number of modifications to the original design. The boiler was raised by 2 in to 8 ft. The smokebox was extended by 4 in and the chimney moved forward to allow room for the Caprotti <b>valve</b> <b>box</b> and associated steam and exhaust pipes. The locomotives fitted with Timken bearings had large split cannon-type axleboxes between the frames. To allow room for the firebox between the middle and rear axleboxes the spacing between the driving and rear coupled wheels was increased from 8 ft to 8 ft. This gave a longer wheelbase of 27 ft as against the 27 ft of the standard locomotives. The locomotives with plain bearings also had the longer wheelbase. All locomotives had a modified cab and a lowered running plate, necessitating the use of splashers over the wheels. In service, the Caprotti Black Fives were slow in acceleration, but were powerful at high speeds, and coasted freely. The slow acceleration was caused by inefficiencies in the drive and valve events. These were addressed {{in the design of}} the last two Black Fives to be built, 44686-7, which emerged in 1951 with Caprotti valve gear driven by two external shafts on either side of the locomotives. Later BR built thirty of the closely related standard class 5 with Caprotti valve gear, and it was also employed on the standard class 8 71000 Duke of Gloucester.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: It is very {{important}} to process acid and fracturing treatment in oil field to improve permeability. The fracturing pump {{is one of the key}} equipment for Acid and fracturing treatment. The <b>valve</b> <b>box</b> of fracturing pump is fundamental, costly and wearing parts. Based on the data from domestic and abroad, the life of the <b>valve</b> <b>box</b> is short. Fatigue cracks caused by alternating stress and erosion account for the most invalidation of the <b>valve</b> <b>box.</b> Only increasing structural size and improving material property are not efficient to prolong service life. Related studies show that hydraulic self-enhancement technology is an effective method and it is used widely to improve service life of fracturing pump’s hydraulic parts. Here hydraulic self-enhancement process was simulated by finite element method and 600 Horse Power fracturing pump was studied. The optimal self-enhancement pressure and loading-unloading treatment method are suggested.

40|$|AbstractThe European Spallation Source is an accelerator-driven neutron {{scattering}} facility, currently {{under construction in}} Lund, Sweden. Its proton linac will include 43 superconducting cavity cryomodules. The nominal operating temperature for the cavities is 2 K, with 40 - 50 K thermal shielding. Required cooling powers will be provided by the accelerator cryoplant and delivered in 4. 5  K and 40 K temperature levels. The 2 K temperature level will be produced at each cryomodule. The cryomodules will be connected with the cryoplant by a dedicated cryogenic distribution system. The system will be composed of a cryogenic transfer line with a splitting box and a cryogenic distribution line with 43 <b>valve</b> <b>boxes</b> and an end box. A number of high-level requirements for the ESS linac impose a highly branched structure for the cryogenic distribution system and strongly influence specific choices related to the detailed designs of <b>valve</b> <b>boxes</b> and cryogenic lines. The design of the <b>valve</b> <b>boxes</b> must allow for warming up and cooling down {{of one or more}} cryomodules without affecting the others. This feature will help to meet a high availability requirement for the ESS accelerator by shortening the duration of some potential and unavoidable cryomodule repairs. This paper describes main functional and technical requirements for the cryogenic distribution system and presents the ESS in-house preliminary design. The paper also gives a few main points of the project execution plan, which points towards in- kind contribution from two different European institutions...|$|R

D-Zero's 2 Tesla superconducting solenoid was cooled down and operated for its second time since its installation into the D-Zero detector. This engineering note summarizes the cryogenic aspects of the test run and performance measurements made. The main purpose of this run was to do field mapping of the solenoid with different combinations of field polarity on the Solenoid and CF iron magnets. This was accomplished. A second purpose was to test the lower field joint repair that was done in January 1999. This field joint had a measurable voltage drop across the soldered bus splice. The repair was an undoing of the joint, extensive cleaning of the bus, and then welding the splice. The repair was successful, no voltage drop was measured and the magnet behaved nicely. A parasitic purpose was to get some operating time on the refrigerator, measure the refrigeration performance, and measure the heat leak in the VLPC lines mounted on the detector platform. Refrigerator performance was spot checked, and was found to be 60 watts (10 %) less than generic operating curves. At this level of performance, the operating margin for the full solenoid and VLPC system will be 75 watts (15 %) which is somewhat uncomfortable from an operational stand point.
