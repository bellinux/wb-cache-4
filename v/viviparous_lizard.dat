5|$|The {{common toad}} (Bufo bufo) {{and the common}} frog (Rana temporaria) are the only {{amphibians}} on the site. They use it in winter or during their migration. The <b>viviparous</b> <b>lizard</b> (Zootoca vivipara) likes the slate deposits and ballast of the track. It hunts in the herbaceous areas, very flowery in summer and high in insects. The common wall lizard (Podarcis muralis) has been seen in 2013. The slowworm reproduction (Anguis fragilis) is attested by the observation of young under rocks and other debris.|$|E
5|$|Manual {{removal of}} the Japanese {{knotweed}} has preserved heritage stations of common butterbur and hart's-tongue fern. Early hand pruning was conducive to orchids. The late mowing seems rather ineffective. The grubbing-up of the Canada golden-rod and American asters was successful. The bush clearing and selective logging have helped maintain the wood-fringe with narrow-leaved everlasting-pea and liquorice milkvetch. Common spotted orchid, zigzag clover and lesser butterfly-orchid, species non-adapted to open areas, benefited areas without clearing. The low dry-stone walls probably favored the installation of <b>viviparous</b> <b>lizard</b> or common wall lizard, observed in 2013, but also the consolidation of the hart's-tongue fern population.|$|E

2500|$|For instance, exploitative {{competition}} {{has been shown}} experimentally between juvenile wolf spiders (Schizocosa ocreata). Both increasing the density of young spiders and reducing the available food supply lowered the growth of individual spiders. Food is clearly a limiting resource for the wolf spiders {{but there was no}} direct competition between juveniles for food, just a reduction in fitness due to the increased population density. The negative density dependence in young wolf spiders is evident: as the population density increases further, growth rates continues to fall and could potentially reach zero (as predicted by the [...] ). This is also seen in <b>Viviparous</b> <b>lizard,</b> or Lacerta vivipara, where the existence of color morphs within a population depends on the density and intraspecific competition.|$|E
2500|$|The primary {{habitat of}} the uplands {{consists}} of heath and bog. The mountain blanket bogs formed around 4,000 {{years ago as}} a result of a combination of climate change and human activity. Prior to this, the mountains were cloaked with pine forest. A change in the climate to wetter and milder weather left the ground waterlogged and leached nutrients from the soil, leading to the formation of peat. Mountain blanket bog is found in areas above [...] in altitude and where there are more than 175 days rainfall a year. The most important builders of peat are the Sphagnum bog mosses. Carnivorous plants such as sundews and butterworts are specific to boglands and bog asphodel and bog cotton are also common. Bog water is important for the reproduction of dragonflies and damselflies and the Wicklow mountain bogs also support insects such as pond skaters, whirligig beetles, water boatmen and midges as well as the common frog and the <b>viviparous</b> <b>lizard.</b> Wading birds such as snipes, curlews and golden plover feed in the waterlogged bogland.|$|E

60|$|With {{many kinds}} of lizards, the sexes differ {{slightly}} in colour, the tints and stripes of the males being brighter and more distinctly defined than in the females.

In a Cordylus of the latter country, the male is either much redder or greener than the female. In the Indian Calotes nigrilabris there is a greater difference in colour between the sexes; the lips also of the male are black, whilst those of the female are green.

40|$|Aim: Evolutionary {{radiations}} into novel {{areas or}} niches require innovative adaptations. However, rapid subsequent changes in these novel conditions might demand rapid re-adaptations to secure population persistence and prevent extinction. We propose that reptilian viviparity (live birth) {{is consistent with}} such a scenario. Using the Liolaemus lizard radiation, we investigate the hypotheses that historical invasions of cold climates have been permitted by transitions to viviparity, and that this parity mode is irreversible. Then, we investigate whether these combined factors restrict <b>viviparous</b> <b>lizards</b> to cold climates, and hence, whether viviparous species are particularly threatened by climate change. Location: South America. Methods: We employ phylogenetic analyses to investigate evolutionary transitions in reproductive modes and their consequences for environmental restrictions in <b>viviparous</b> <b>lizards.</b> We then employ climatic projections to predict the impact of climate change on the future persistence of these organisms. Results: The oviparity-to-viviparity transition is consistently associated with colonization of cold climates, {{and appears to be}} irreversible. Since viviparity seems less viable (compared with oviparity) in warm climates, species that evolve viviparity in cold climates are likely to remain adaptively constrained to such environments. Therefore, upward-poleward advances of climate warming will cause severe shifts and contractions of viviparous species ranges, threatening major extinctions over the next half century. Main conclusions: Viviparity has been largely responsible for the successful radiation of Liolaemus into cold climates, but since this adaptation is predominantly viable in these environments and is unlikely to re-evolve into oviparity, viviparity may prove to be an evolutionary dead-end for lizards facing rapid climate change.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{discriminate}} kin from nonkin {{is critical for}} the evolution of kin-based sociality. Black rock skinks, Egernia saxatilis, are <b>viviparous</b> <b>lizards</b> that typically live in "nuclear families" consisting of an adult male, adult female, and one or more cohorts of juveniles. Laboratory trials showed that juvenile lizards can discriminate between the scent of adults from their own social group versus that of unfamiliar adults. Experiments in which we translocated individuals among family groups revealed that this discriminatory ability was based on familiarity with other individuals rather than genetic relatedness. For example, neither "fostered" juveniles nor their mothers displayed any scent-based kin discrimination when brought together after 2 months' separation. Thus, unlike the closely related (and also social) Egernia striolata, black rock skinks base kin discrimination on familiarity rather than genotypic similarity.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{maternal}} contributions to offspring fitness in <b>viviparous</b> <b>lizards.</b> Although parental effects may include both pre- and postpartum components, {{the majority of}} squamate reptile species exhibit no parental care: parental effects on offspring fitness can, therefore, be imposed only until the time of oviposition or parturition. In viviparous reptiles, offspring are retained in utero for the entire duration of embryogenesis, but in most species the majority of embryonic nutrition is supplied through the yolk with a small contribution by a simple placenta. In some reptilian species, viviparity has evolved further, resulting in a diverse range of placental arrangements and a complete spectrum of embryonic nutritional modes being displayed across {{a wide range of}} taxa. It has been suggested that facultative placentotrophy (the ability to supplement an adequate yolk supply) allows the introduction of flexibility into the timing of parturition by providing embryos with additional energy stores to utilise if parturition is delayed. My study species were two closely related <b>viviparous</b> <b>lizards</b> found in Tasmania, Australia. Previously, embryonic nutrition {{has been shown to be}} predominantly placentotrophic in Niveoscincus ocellatus; I have now determined that embryonic nutrition is predominantly lecithotrophic in N. microlepidotus, and that females may utilise facultative placentotrophy only in some years. My thesis investigated the major hypothesis that deferral of parturition after completion of embryonic development is a key strategy employed by females of <b>viviparous</b> <b>lizards</b> to maximise offspring fitness. The three interlinked papers on this theme that I have included in my thesis support my hypothesis. In N. ocellatus, deferring parturition in response to cold conditions had no effect on offspring phenotype at birth, dispersal distance or survivorship of offspring after release; however, there was a significant negative effect on offspring growth measured after release, which has profound implications for age and size at maturity. I found that females from a high elevation population were less able to defer birth under “long” periods (three weeks) of cold conditions than females of a low elevation population. I attribute the reduced ability of females from the high elevation population to defer parturition to selection for preventing births too close to winter. However, in the biennially reproducing N. microlepidotus, my results have identified that the naturally protracted deferral of parturition from autumn until spring represents a trade-off between offspring quality and offspring size. Finer scale variation in the timing of parturition also influences neonatal characteristics: I have shown that there is an effect of date of birth on several key offspring characteristics at birth in N. microlepidotus. Experimental manipulations of the maternal environment demonstrated that females are able to defer birth for an additional four weeks at the end of gestation, but with no significant effect on offspring characteristics. 	How is the timing of parturition determined if fully developed embryos may be held in utero for significant periods of time? I discovered that in N. microlepidotus the uteri are equally responsive to hormonal stimulation (arginine vasotocin (AVT) and prostaglandin (PGF 2 a) in autumn and spring. In both N. microlepidotus and N. ocellatus, females are more responsive to AVT than to PGF 2 a, and the response to AVT is decreased, but not prevented, by B-adrenergic stimulation. In N. ocellatus, temperature modulates the response to AVT in vivo, with the time to parturition increasing as temperature decreases. In these viviparous species, then, the endocrine cascade leading to parturition is modulated by the B-adrenergic system. 	The final component of the thesis investigated male reproductive success in a population of N. ocellatus. I determined the paternity of 65...|$|R

50|$|The {{frequency}} of multiple morphs occurring {{in a population}} varies {{with the level of}} population density and frequency-dependent environments. These factors cause the lizards to vary in terms of their fitness (clutch size, sex ratio, hatching success). In lower density populations, color polymorphism is more prevalent. This is because <b>viviparous</b> <b>lizards</b> thrive in environments where intraspecific competition is low. Increased competition among individuals results in lower survival rates of lizards. Additionally, female lizards disperse through habitats based on the {{frequency of}} color types that are already present in the population. Their reproductive abilities vary according to this frequency-dependent environment. The number of offspring that they produce correlates with the color morph: yellow females produce the fewest offspring, while orange females produce more than yellow, but fewer than mixed females, which produce the most offspring. The amount of offspring produced varies in regards to color frequencies in the population; for example, if yellow females have higher density within the population, the clutch size for orange lizards is usually lower.|$|R
