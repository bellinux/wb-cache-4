40|$|This Report {{is dealing}} with <b>virtual</b> <b>currencies</b> – their concept and applications. The report starts with the {{description}} {{of different types of}} <b>virtual</b> <b>currencies,</b> first Bitcoin, then some other types of crypto currencies, followed by description of <b>virtual</b> <b>currencies</b> that are created by conversion of real–world <b>currencies,</b> and finally, <b>virtual</b> <b>currencies</b> based on different types of non–financial assets. The common characteristic of all types of <b>virtual</b> <b>currencies</b> and applications based on them is support for various types of financial transactions. The analysis of the Bitcoin system includes its functional aspects, but also its weaknesses and problems. In addition to the Bitcoin and other popular systems using alternative <b>virtual</b> <b>currencies</b> for payment transactions, the Report also outlines some trends and current initiatives to use the concept of the public ledger – blockchain as support for validation and authorization of distributed, peer-to–peer financial transactions. Most of such current trends rely on use of the currently operational Bitcoin network and in that way they are directly vulnerable to the weaknesses and threats originating from that network. JRC.

40|$|AbstractMoney {{is perhaps}} the best {{recognized}} {{and at the same}} time less understood figure of economy. During the evolution of a monetary science starting from the eighteenth century and fundamental works on such questions as true nature and main functions of money, the approach and theories about monetary science have changed significantly up to date not reaching the final state. The twenty-first century can be characterized with a vast development of technologies and the increase use of the internet which significantly succeeded the development of monetary system introducing a new phenomenon - <b>virtual</b> <b>currencies.</b> While remaining rather illusive, <b>virtual</b> <b>currencies</b> have been broadly noted by both, legislative authorities and practitioners. Moreover, such prime authorities as Securities and Exchange Commission, S Treasury and European Central bank have also shared their concerns about this new type of currency. Due to the growing popularity of <b>virtual</b> <b>currencies,</b> especially cryptocurrencies the suggested topic deserves extra attention. Despite the diverse opportunities <b>virtual</b> <b>currencies</b> might offer it is rather hard to ignore the related risks - <b>virtual</b> <b>currencies,</b> representing a type of unregulated, digital money might support superior risks such as money laundering, financing illegal activities et cetera. In scope of this paper the overall analysis and estimation of risks related to possible development of <b>virtual</b> <b>currencies</b> and the insufficient, not unified regulation is discussed. The main findings of the paper suggest that <b>virtual</b> <b>currencies</b> have a strong potential for further development nevertheless, the development of global or at least regional legislative base should stand prior...|$|R

As drops of these costume elements are far more rare than in CS:GO, the gambling situation around them was not seen as egregious as CS:GO skin gambling, though does suffer from the same ethical and legal issues.

25|$|NBA 2K16 again, for {{the fourth}} time in the series, {{features}} MyTeam mode. MyTeam mode was first introduced in NBA 2K13, and is based around the idea of building the ultimate basketball team, and maintaining a virtual trading card collection. Players build their own custom team, selecting the players, current and past, jerseys, coach, court, and other basketball related things, and play with their team in basketball tournament-style competitions against other players' teams. Players collect cards that unlock players, playbooks, and other items {{that can be used in}} their team or sold. Players purchase card packs with <b>Virtual</b> <b>Currency</b> (VC) which gives the player random items. Cards have different levels that indicate how good the card is. A player will commonly receive Bronze cards if they purchase cheaper card packs. However, if the player purchases high priced packs, the chances of getting Gold cards are higher. There are also rare cards, such as Amethyst and Diamond cards, that are rarer and better than other cards. The level of a card isn't always the most important factor as the abilities of the actual player, and their rating indicating how good they are, is most often more important. Players can freely customize their team on the fly; players may change the coach, players, jerseys, and anything else at any time. Customization aspects were touted as being the major improvements for the mode.|$|E

Regulation {{of payment}} {{services}} {{plays a key}} role in this era driven by escalating digitalization. The aim of this Thesis is to depict current challenges that this area of financial law faces and to propose a basis for regulation that can be implemented in the Czech Republic. The main topic of this Thesis is <b>virtual</b> <b>currencies,</b> more specifically Bitcoins and their status within the system of payment services regulations. After a short introduction, the first chapter of this Thesis describes theoretical background of payment services regulation, especially general and specific aims of legislation in this area of financial law, by addressing it in full context of private and public law. Besides that, it also briefly illustrates the history of payment services and money. The next chapter deals with current regulation that has been adopted in the Czech Republic. Besides <b>virtual</b> <b>currencies,</b> electronic money is discussed in full detail due to its similar features with <b>virtual</b> <b>currencies.</b> Furthermore, foreign regulation of payment systems is briefly described in order to provide a comparison with the Czech Republic.
