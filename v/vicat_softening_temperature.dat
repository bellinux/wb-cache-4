The viscoelastic properties of the non-crosslinked, externally plasticized CA show typical temperature dependence, similar to conventional thermoplastics. A strong increase in storage modulus is observed with increasing crosslink density indicating that the crosslinked compounds exhibit predominately elastic response. The complex viscosity also increases considerably with increasing crosslink density and does not reach the typical Newtonian plateau at low radial frequencies any more. The viscoelastic properties correlate well with the data recorded online during reactive melt processing in the internal mixer.

The {{results indicated that}} the addition of MCC had led to the increase of the tensile strength, impact strength, and flexural strength of PP. PP-g-GMA modification was more conducive to the improvement in tensile strength, impact strength, and flexural strength. The three types of PP/MCC composites have higher thermal decomposition <b>temperatures,</b> <b>Vicat</b> <b>softening</b> <b>temperatures,</b> and dimensional stability.

Therefore, test samples of flexible composite pipes were prepared with high-temperature polythene (PE-RT) as the neck bush and aramid fiber as the reinforcement layer. Experimental study was conducted by using HPHT vessel and differential thermal scanner for different working conditions, different temperatures, whole-pipe pressure-bearing capacity and 1000  h viability. It is shown by the environmental compatibility test that high temperature has little effect on the weight, <b>Vicat</b> <b>softening</b> <b>temperature,</b> mechanical properties and structures of neck bush PE-RT, but exerts an obvious effect on the tensility and whole-pipe water pressure blasting of the reinforcement aramid fiber. Besides, the drop of whole-pipe pressure-bearing capacity is caused by deformation and breaking of aramid fibers when the reinforcement layer is under the force of internal pressure. Finally, disorientation and crystallization of molecular thermal motion occur with the rise of temperature, so amorphous orientation reduces, crystallinity factor and crystalline orientation factor increase gradually, thus, disorientation of macromolecular chains increases and tensile strength decreases. It is concluded that this type of flexible composite pipe can smoothly pass 1000  h viability test. And it is recommended that it be used in the situations with temperature not higher than 95  °C and internal pressure not higher than 4  MPa...|$|E
