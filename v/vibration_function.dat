25|$|In March 1999, Game Art's Japanese {{publisher}} ESP Software showcased a PlayStation {{version of}} Grandia at that year's Tokyo Game Show expo, along with confirmation {{that the game}} would be released in English {{for the first time}} in North America by Sony Computer Entertainment America. Working Designs, which had previously worked with Game Arts on bringing their Lunar games to the region, had expressed interest in publishing the game, but were ultimately unable to secure the rights. New features for the PlayStation version included support for the system's DualShock analog control sticks and <b>vibration</b> <b>function,</b> as well as compatibility with Sony's Japanese-only PocketStation peripheral, which allows players to download game data on a portable device for use in a special mini-game. Although the company had expressed interest in bringing the game to the PlayStation as early as 1998, technical problems originally prevented the title from being ported to the system. Game Arts was later able to release the game with a slight loss in frame rate and a marginal decrease in video effects the following June. The North American version was originally announced by Sony as a summer release during the 1999 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles, but was pushed back to the following October. Grandia was later released for the PlayStation in Europe in 2000 by Ubisoft.|$|E

40|$|Free {{vibration}} of beams with {{intermediate point}} supports is studied by the classical Ritz method {{within the context}} of Euler beam theory. For the Ritz method, the displacement of a beam is approximated by a set of admissible trial functions which must satisfy the kinematic conditions at the ends and intermediate supports of the beam. To this end, a polynomial is superimposed on the conventional single-span beam <b>vibration</b> <b>functions</b> to form continuous-span or modified beam <b>vibration</b> <b>functions.</b> These modified beam functions are taken as the admissible trial functions for subsequent formulation. Stiffness and mass matrices are formulated using the conventional procedure and the resulting linear eigen-equation can be solved easily.

40|$|This paper reports {{some initial}} {{findings}} {{in the attempt to}} develop a robust method to identify more than one moving force on multi-span non-uniform continuous bridges. To keep the number of unknowns in the moving force identification problem to a minimum, the modified beam <b>vibration</b> <b>functions</b> are chosen as the assumed modes of a multi-span bridge. These modified beam <b>vibration</b> <b>functions</b> satisfy the zero deflection conditions at all the intermediate supports as well as the boundary conditions at the two ends of the bridge. The least squares method is used to solve the inverse problem to get the closest approximation to the moving forces. The pseudo-inverse to obtain the solution to the inverse problem is obtained by singular value decomposition. Only acceleration measurements are used for the moving force identification. The results show that this method is applicable and robust. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIt is well {{established}} that the dynamic response {{of a number of}} nominally identical built-up structures are often different and the variability increases with increasing complexity of the structure.

50|$|The DualShock Analog Controller (SCPH-1200), a {{controller}} {{capable of}} providing vibration feedback, {{was based on the}} onscreen actions taking place in the game (if the game supports it), as well as analog input through two analog sticks.

The DualShock differs from the Nintendo 64's Rumble Pak in this respect as the Rumble Pak only uses a single motor.
