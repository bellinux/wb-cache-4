40|$|A {{research}} and testing facility {{has been developed}} at Simtars to allow the spontaneous combustion testing of coal on a large scale. In this adiabatic reactor, the coal particle sizing is closer to that which {{could be found in}} the goaf and therefore the reaction is more likely to simulate the underground situation. This allows aspects of the spontaneous combustion process and methods for detecting a heating to be investigated which cannot be done in an operational mine. Up to 18 tonnes of run of mine or crushed coal is loaded into the reactor and allowed to self-heat while the temperature and gas profiles within the coal pile are monitored. The gases evolved from the coal are analysed using a fixed gas monitor system and gas chromatography to determine which of the common <b>mine</b> <b>fire</b> <b>indicators</b> and ratios can be used to predict the onset and progress of coal heatings. Benchmarking of the inherent propensity of a coal to spontaneously combust at both the large- and laboratory-scale is also possible by comparing the sample against previously tested samples. It has been found that the coal particle size affects both the time it takes for the coal to react and the location of the developing heating. The heatings generate approximately one metre from the inlet but in the crushed coal case do not progress to an advanced heating stage until the ‘hot spot’ migrates towards the coal surface where there is an increased oxygen supply. Physical properties such as the compressive strength of the coal also affect the heating size and the time it takes for a heating to develop. Higher strength coals appear to oxidise more slowly and therefore take longer to self-heat as oxidation of the coal is the heat-generating step in the spontaneous combustion process. The best indicators {{of the state of the}} heating were found to be CO make and Graham’s ratio which are independent of air flow. Investigation of a potential spontaneous combustion should begin as soon as the CO make or Graham’s ratio exceed the background levels. The results from the tests undertaken on a number of Queensland and NSW coals are reported here together with the implications for the mining industry...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCoal <b>mine</b> <b>fires</b> are insidious, persistent, and as {{widespread}} as {{the occurrence}} of coal itself, yet their potential adverse human health impacts have been poorly characterised. We aimed to summarise the existing literature regarding the health harms associated with coal <b>mine</b> <b>fires</b> and other relevant environmental exposures. We searched the literature for studies of coal <b>mine</b> <b>fires,</b> their emissions, and any aspect of human health. In the absence of health evidence specific to coal <b>mine</b> <b>fires,</b> we included studies of domestic coal combustion and outdoor air pollution from forest fire smoke, for which emission profiles are broadly similar. Coal <b>mine</b> <b>fires</b> cause physical hazards and poor air quality. Proximity {{to the source of}} pollution and smouldering combustion typical of coal <b>mine</b> <b>fires</b> increase the risk of community exposure to high concentrations of known toxins such as aerosolised particles, and products of incomplete combustion. Coal <b>mine</b> <b>fire</b> smoke is likely to have short-term adverse respiratory impacts. Adverse cardiovascular outcomes and increased mortality are also plausible depending upon the magnitude of exposure and the number of people affected. There is insufficient evidence to determine the likelihood of other health outcomes. There are major gaps in the available evidence for health outcomes associated with exposure to poor air quality for time periods of weeks to months. The incomplete evidence base hampers actions to mitigate harms in a timely, scientifically-informed manner. The need to further understand the health impacts of coal <b>mine</b> <b>fires</b> is pressing, particularly as they disproportionately affect vulnerable and disadvantaged communities and are likely to become more frequent and severe as a consequence of climate change...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Mine</b> <b>fire</b> is a {{very complex}} {{physicochemical}} process. Once it happens, there are lots of poisonous and harmful gas ingredients while the oxygen density is greatly reduced. Such gas will cause poison, suffocation or death if it is inhaled. As we know, the main cause of great amount of person losses during <b>mine</b> <b>fire</b> is fume poison and suffocation. Additionally, the fume caused by the fire will block the vision and decrease the visibility, which will impede human evacuation and fire fighting. Moreover, due to the turbulent airflow of ventilation network during <b>mine</b> <b>fire</b> period, it is easy to cause the gas and coal dust explosion. So it is very important for the evacuation of miners and mining salvation to research the air flow control during <b>mine</b> <b>fire.</b> *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed...|$|R

30|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to investigate the influence of smoke movement during <b>mine</b> <b>fires</b> on miner evacuation behaviors. A three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics method was conducted to reconstruct the laneway conveyor belt fire scenes under two ventilating conditions. The parameters, including temperature–time histories, soot density, carbon monoxide and heat release rate, were simulated to characterize the <b>mine</b> <b>fires</b> at various ventilating speeds. A miner evacuation model affected by fire smoke movement was advanced to describe the miner evacuation behaviors, which {{can be divided into}} three stages. Based on the evacuation model coupled with the <b>mine</b> <b>fire</b> smoke movement, the available safety evacuation time for miners involved in coal <b>mine</b> <b>fire</b> located in different sites was estimated. Two evacuation patterns were advanced according to the ventilating speeds combined with the model of miner evacuation behaviors. The results show that the miners located between the inlet-air end and the air door in lane 1 should be evacuated to the inlet-air end and other miners involved in coal <b>mine</b> <b>fire</b> could choose the air door as the escaping destination, when the ventilation speed is greater than 3  m/s. Accordingly, the research can be used as references for the mine safety administration authorities to design the safety evacuation.|$|R
