It is not yet known exactly what compounds are responsible for maple syrup's distinctive flavour, however its primary flavour contributing compounds are maple furanone, strawberry furanone, and maltol.|$|E
5|$|Vanilla tahitensis (Tahitian vanilla), {{which is}} a cross-strain of Vanilla planifola (Mexican vanilla and Bourbon vanilla) and Vanilla odorata (Inflated Vanilla), is {{produced}} in French Polynesia, especially in Tahiti, and also Hawaii. Its pods have fewer seeds than Vanilla planifolia, {{which is not a}} direct competitor. Mexican vanilla is used almost exclusively as the base of vanilla extract, due to higher <b>vanillin</b> levels. Tahitian vanilla is used primarily in perfume because of its coumarin-like scent. Other Tahitian vanilla products include vanilla green tea, vanilla oil, vanilla powder, vanilla rum, and vinegar-based vanilla.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vanillin</b> {{has been}} used as a {{chemical}} intermediate in the production of pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and other fine chemicals. In 1970, more than half the world's <b>vanillin</b> production was used in the synthesis of other chemicals. As of 2016, <b>vanillin</b> uses have expanded to include perfumes, flavoring and aromatic masking in medicines, various consumer and cleaning products, and livestock foods.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vanillin</b> is a {{phenolic}} aldehyde {{most commonly}} associated with the vanilla notes in wines that have been aged in oak. Trace amounts of <b>vanillin</b> are found naturally in grapes, but they are most prominent in the lignin structure of oak barrels. Newer barrels will impart more <b>vanillin,</b> with the concentration present decreasing with each subsequent usage.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vanillin</b> is a {{phenolic}} aldehyde, {{which is}} an organic compound with the molecular formula C8H8O3. Its functional groups include aldehyde, hydroxyl, and ether. It is the primary component of the extract of the vanilla bean. Synthetic <b>vanillin</b> is now used more often than natural vanilla extract as a flavoring agent in foods, beverages, and pharmaceuticals.|$|E
25|$|Aging in oak barrels imparts <b>vanillin</b> to some wines, vinegar, and spirits.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, semisynthetic <b>vanillin</b> {{derived from the}} eugenol found in clove oil was commercially available.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vanillin</b> {{can trigger}} {{allergic}} reactions, {{as well as}} migraine headaches in {{a small fraction of}} the people who experience migraines.|$|E
25|$|A {{study found}} that Ef. surinamensis males have a marked {{preference}} for the compound <b>vanillin,</b> compared to 1.8 cineole and eugenol.|$|E
25|$|Extraction in {{particular}} results in whisky acquiring {{a number of}} compounds, including aldehydes and acids such as <b>vanillin,</b> vanillic acid, and syringaldehyde.|$|E
25|$|At lower concentrations, <b>vanillin</b> {{contributes}} to the flavor and aroma profiles of foodstuffs as diverse as olive oil, butter, raspberry, and lychee fruits.|$|E
25|$|Scolytus multistriatus, {{one of the}} vectors of the Dutch elm disease, uses <b>vanillin</b> as {{a signal}} to find a host tree during oviposition.|$|E
25|$|As harvested, {{the green}} seed pods contain <b>vanillin</b> {{in the form}} of its β-D-glucoside; the green pods do not have the flavor or odor of vanilla.|$|E
25|$|Oak barrel {{will add}} {{compounds}} such as <b>vanillin</b> and hydrolysable tannins (ellagitannins). The hydrolyzable tannins present in oak {{are derived from}} lignin structures in the wood. They help protect the wine from oxidation and reduction.|$|E
25|$|Lignin-based {{artificial}} vanilla flavoring {{is alleged}} to have a richer flavor profile than oil-based flavoring; the difference is due to the presence of acetovanillone, a minor component in the lignin-derived product that is not found in <b>vanillin</b> synthesized from guaiacol.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vanillin</b> is {{also used}} in the {{fragrance}} industry, in perfumes, and to mask unpleasant odors or tastes in medicines, livestock fodder, and cleaning products. It {{is also used}} in the flavor industry, as a very important key note for many different flavors, especially creamy profiles such as cream soda.|$|E
25|$|At present, {{the most}} {{significant}} {{of these is the}} two-step process practiced by Rhodia since the 1970s, in which guaiacol (1) reacts with glyoxylic acid by electrophilic aromatic substitution. The resulting vanillylmandelic acid (2) is then converted via 4-Hydroxy-3-methoxyphenylglyoxylic acid (3) to <b>vanillin</b> (4) by oxidative decarboxylation.|$|E
25|$|In France, {{both the}} Quercus robur (common oak) and Quercus petraea (white oak) are {{considered}} apt for wine making, however, {{the latter is}} considered far superior for its finer grain and richer contribution of aromatic components like <b>vanillin</b> and its derivates, methyl-octalactone and tannins, as well as phenols and volatile aldehydes.|$|E
25|$|Ancient {{texts and}} archaeological {{excavations}} show {{the use of}} perfumes {{in some of the}} earliest human civilizations. Modern perfumery began in the late 19th century with the commercial synthesis of aroma compounds such as <b>vanillin</b> or coumarin, which allowed for the composition of perfumes with smells previously unattainable solely from natural aromatics alone.|$|E
25|$|Norisoprenoids-Carotenoid derived {{aromatic}} {{compounds that}} includes megastigmatrienone which produces {{some of the}} spice notes associated with Chardonnay and zingerone responsible for the different spice notes associated with Syrah. Other norisoprenoids include raspberry ketone which produces some of the raspberry aromas associated with red wine, damascenone which produces some of the rose oil aromas associated with Pinot noir and <b>vanillin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Traces of many {{aldehydes}} {{are found}} in essential oils and often contribute to their favorable odors, e.g. cinnamaldehyde, cilantro, and <b>vanillin.</b> Possibly {{because of the high}} reactivity of the formyl group, aldehydes are not common in several of the natural building blocks: amino acids, nucleic acids, lipids. Most sugars, however, are derivatives of aldehydes. These aldoses exist as hemiacetals, a sort of masked form of the parent aldehyde. For example, in aqueous solution {{only a tiny fraction of}} glucose exists as the aldehyde.|$|E
2500|$|The {{demand for}} vanilla {{flavoring}} has long exceeded {{the supply of}} vanilla beans. , the annual demand for <b>vanillin</b> was 12,000 tons, but only 1,800 tons of natural <b>vanillin</b> were produced. The remainder was produced by chemical synthesis. <b>Vanillin</b> was first synthesized from eugenol (found in oil of clove) in 1874–75, less than 20 {{years after it was}} first identified and isolated. <b>Vanillin</b> was commercially produced from eugenol until the 1920s. Later it was synthesized from lignin-containing [...] "brown liquor", a byproduct of the sulfite process for making wood pulp. Counterintuitively, though it uses waste materials, the lignin process is no longer popular because of environmental concerns, and today most <b>vanillin</b> is produced from the petrochemical raw material guaiacol. Several routes exist for synthesizing <b>vanillin</b> from guaiacol.|$|E
2500|$|Synthetic <b>vanillin</b> became {{significantly}} more {{available in the}} 1930s, when production from clove oil was supplanted by production from the lignin-containing waste produced by the sulfite pulping process for preparing wood pulp for the paper industry. [...] By 1981, a single pulp and paper mill in Thorold, Ontario supplied 60% of the world market for synthetic <b>vanillin.</b> [...] However, subsequent developments in the wood pulp industry have made its lignin wastes less attractive as a raw material for <b>vanillin</b> synthesis. [...] While some <b>vanillin</b> is still made from lignin wastes, most synthetic <b>vanillin</b> is today synthesized in a two-step process from the petrochemical precursors guaiacol and glyoxylic acid.|$|E
2500|$|Natural [...] "vanilla extract" [...] is {{a mixture}} of several hundred {{different}} compounds in addition to <b>vanillin.</b> [...] Artificial vanilla flavoring is often a solution of pure <b>vanillin,</b> usually of synthetic origin. Because of the scarcity and expense of natural vanilla extract, [...] synthetic preparation of its predominant component has long been of interest. [...] The first commercial synthesis of <b>vanillin</b> began with the more readily available natural compound eugenol. [...] Today, artificial <b>vanillin</b> is made either from guaiacol or lignin.|$|E
2500|$|Raymond Rogers [...] {{argued in}} the {{scientific}} journal Thermochimica Acta {{that the presence of}} <b>vanillin</b> differed markedly between the unprovenanced threads he was looking at, which contained 37% of the original <b>vanillin,</b> while the body of the shroud contained 0% of the original <b>vanillin.</b> He stated that: [...] "The fact that <b>vanillin</b> cannot be detected in the lignin on shroud fibers, Dead Sea scrolls linen, and other very old linens indicate that the shroud is quite old. A determination of the kinetics of <b>vanillin</b> loss suggest the shroud is between 1300 and 3000 years old. Even allowing for errors in the measurements and assumptions about storage conditions, the cloth is unlikely to be as young as 840 years".|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in 2000, Rhodia began {{marketing}} biosynthetic <b>vanillin</b> {{prepared by}} the action of microorganisms on ferulic acid extracted from rice bran. [...] At $700/kg, this product, sold under the trademarked name Rhovanil Natural, is not cost-competitive with petrochemical <b>vanillin,</b> which sells for around $15/kg. However, unlike <b>vanillin</b> synthesized from lignin or guaiacol, it can be labeled as a natural flavoring.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the exact}} route of <b>vanillin</b> {{biosynthesis}} in V. planifolia is currently unknown, several pathways are proposed for its biosynthesis. <b>Vanillin</b> biosynthesis is generally {{agreed to be}} part of the phenylpropanoid pathway starting with L-phenylalanine, which is deaminated by phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) to form t-cinnamic acid. The para position of the ring is then hydroxylated by the cytochrome P450 enzyme cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H/P450) to create p-coumaric acid. Then, in the proposed ferulate pathway, 4-hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA ligase (4CL) attaches p-coumaric acid to coenzyme A (CoA) to create p-coumaroyl CoA. Hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (HCT) then converts p-coumaroyl CoA to 4-coumaroyl shikimate/quinate. This subsequently undergoes oxidation by the P450 enzyme coumaroyl ester 3’-hydroxylase (C3’H/P450) to give caffeoyl shikimate/quinate. HCT then exchanges the shikimate/quinate for CoA to create caffeoyl CoA, and 4CL removes CoA to afford caffeic acid. Caffeic acid then undergoes methylation by caffeic acid O-methyltransferase (COMT) to give ferulic acid. Finally, <b>vanillin</b> synthase hydratase/lyase (vp/VAN) catalyzes hydration of the double bond in ferulic acid followed by a retro-aldol elimination to afford <b>vanillin.</b> <b>Vanillin</b> can also be produced from vanilla glycoside with the additional final step of deglycosylation. In the past p-hydroxybenzaldehyde was speculated to be a precursor for <b>vanillin</b> biosynthesis. However, recently it was demonstrated by radiolabelled precursor studies that [...] p-hydroxybenzaldehyde do not synthesis <b>vanillin</b> or <b>vanillin</b> glucoside in the vanilla orchids.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Vanillin</b> {{was first}} {{isolated}} {{as a relatively}} pure substance in 1858 by Nicolas-Theodore Gobley, who obtained it by evaporating a vanilla extract to dryness, and recrystallizing the resulting solids from hot water. In 1874, the German scientists Ferdinand Tiemann and Wilhelm Haarmann deduced its chemical structure, {{at the same time}} finding a synthesis for <b>vanillin</b> from coniferin, a glucoside of isoeugenol found in pine bark. Tiemann and Haarmann founded a company, Haarmann and Reimer (now part of Symrise) and started the first industrial production of <b>vanillin</b> using their process in Holzminden, Germany. In 1876, [...] synthesized <b>vanillin</b> (2) from guaiacol (1).|$|E
2500|$|In other foods, heat {{treatment}} generates <b>vanillin</b> from other chemicals. [...] In this way, <b>vanillin</b> {{contributes to the}} flavor and aroma of coffee, maple syrup, and whole-grain products including corn tortillas and oatmeal.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Vanillin</b> and ethylvanillin {{are used}} by the food industry; [...] ethylvanillin is more expensive, but has a {{stronger}} note. It differs from <b>vanillin</b> by having an ethoxy group (–O–CH2CH3) instead of a methoxy group (–O–CH3).|$|E
2500|$|Natural <b>vanillin</b> is {{extracted}} from the seed pods of Vanilla planifolia, a vining orchid native to Mexico, but now grown in tropical areas around the globe. [...] Madagascar is presently the largest producer of natural <b>vanillin.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The largest use of <b>vanillin</b> is as a flavoring, {{usually in}} sweet foods. [...] The {{ice cream and}} {{chocolate}} industries together comprise 75% {{of the market for}} <b>vanillin</b> as a flavoring, with smaller amounts being used in confections and baked goods.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Vanillin</b> is most {{prominent}} {{as the principal}} flavor and aroma compound in vanilla. Cured vanilla pods contain about 2% by dry weight vanillin; on cured pods of high quality, relatively pure <b>vanillin</b> may be visible as a white dust or [...] "frost" [...] on {{the exterior of the}} pod.|$|E
2500|$|The solvent 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane {{has been}} used for {{extraction}} of natural products such as taxol, evening primrose oil, and <b>vanillin.</b> [...] 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol is an oxidation-resistant polar solvent.|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} stated that Roger’s vanillin-dating process is untested, and the {{validity}} thereof is suspect, as {{the deterioration of}} <b>vanillin</b> is heavily influenced by the temperature of its environment – heat strips away <b>vanillin</b> rapidly, and the shroud {{has been subjected to}} temperatures high enough to melt silver and scorch the cloth. Rogers' analysis is also questioned by skeptics such as Joe Nickell, who reasons that the conclusions of the author, Raymond Rogers, result from [...] "starting with the desired conclusion and working backward to the evidence".|$|E
2500|$|Additionally, <b>vanillin</b> {{can be used}} as a {{general-purpose}} stain {{for developing}} thin layer chromatography plates to aid in visualizing components of a reaction mixture. [...] This stain yields a range of colors for these different components.|$|E
