5|$|Major {{political}} parties in Sarawak {{can be divided into}} three categories: native non-Muslim, native Muslim, and non-native; parties, however, may also include members from more than one group. The first political party, the Sarawak United Peoples' Party (SUPP), was established in 1959, followed by the Parti Negara Sarawak (PANAS) in 1960 and the Sarawak National Party (SNAP) in 1961. Other major {{political parties}} such as Parti Pesaka Sarawak (PESAKA) appeared by 1962. These parties later joined the national coalition of the Alliance Party. The Alliance Party (later regrouped into Barisan Nasional) has ruled Sarawak since the formation of Malaysia. The opposition in Sarawak has consistently alleged that the ruling coalition uses various types of <b>vote-buying</b> tactics in order to win elections. Stephen Kalong Ningkan was the first Chief Minister of Sarawak from 1963 to 1966 following his landslide victory in local council elections. However, he was ousted in 1966 by Tawi Sli {{with the help of the}} Malaysian federal government, causing the 1966 Sarawak constitutional crisis.|$|E
25|$|Elections in Lithuania {{have been}} {{assessed}} as generally {{free and fair}} by domestic and international monitors, although voting irregularities and allegations of <b>vote-buying</b> have occurred, although OSCE highlight the overly broad interpretation of a definition of <b>vote-buying</b> as a possible explanation of the scale of allegations.|$|E
25|$|The IFE {{found some}} irregularities, but {{confirmed}} {{the results on}} 6 July. Obrador rejected this announcement, and on 12 July filed a complaint for invalidation of the election. He alleged <b>vote-buying,</b> spending in excess of election regulations, illegal fund raising, and vote fraud. But on 30 August, the Electoral Tribunal of the Federal Judiciary rejected Obrador's complaint.|$|E
25|$|In May 2004, actor-turned-politician Fernando Poe, Jr., {{whose family}} is from San Carlos City, Pangasinan, ran for President against {{incumbent}} Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo during the Philippine general election in 2004. The Pangasinan vote was almost evenly split {{by the two}} presidential candidates who both have Pangasinan roots. Arroyo was elected President, but her victory was tainted by charges of electoral fraud and <b>vote-buying.</b>|$|E
25|$|Party leaders {{apparently}} {{took advantage}} of Trollope's eagerness to stand, and of his willingness {{to spend money on}} a campaign. Beverley had a long history of <b>vote-buying</b> and of intimidation by employers and others. Every election since 1857 had been followed by a petition alleging corruption, and it was estimated that 300 of the 1100 voters in 1868 would sell their votes. The task of a Liberal candidate was not to win the election, but to give the Conservative candidates an opportunity to display overt corruption, which could then be used to disqualify them.|$|E
25|$|The {{fourth quarter}} of 2014 saw another flurry of {{officials}} detained for investigation. Criminal proceedings had also begun. On July 31, Wang Suyi was sentenced to fifteen {{years in prison for}} bribery. On August 5, Tong Mingqian was convicted of dereliction of duty in a <b>vote-buying</b> scandal and sentenced to five years in prison. In September 2014, the trial of former economic official Liu Tienan became the first high-profile televised trial of the campaign. On camera, a teary-eyed Liu recanted his crimes and lamented having ruined the future of his son, who was said to be complicit in his corrupt activities.|$|E
25|$|President Chen Shui-Bian {{suffered}} a large loss in popularity due to corruption allegations concerning his family. The KMT attempted {{to capitalize on}} Ma's public image {{as a man of}} integrity, which stemmed from his investigations into <b>vote-buying</b> within his own party while he served as Justice Minister in the early 90s. Ma resigned as Justice Minister in the mid-1990s and his political career was considered to be over due to what some thought was his zealous investigation of corruption. However, Ma Ying-Jeou was indicted on charges of misusing his Mayoral discretionary funds, which was intended for funding personal expenses related to official duties. Ma moved half of the funds into his personal accounts, and his defense was that this practice was standard among government officials. Ma maintained his innocence and stated that the indictment amounted to political prosecution and he would not give up his run for presidency even if found guilty.|$|E
25|$|In Japan, {{especially}} within conservative {{media outlets}} (the most vocal ones being Sankei Shimbun and Bungei Shunju), {{it is argued}} that countries which oppose commercial whaling altogether should not be in the IWC at all and allege that the anti-whaling side has subverted the purpose of the IWC by exploiting the (lack of) membership requirements. Moreover, they point out that the anti-whaling lobby within the IWC are also led by wealthy developed nations and are equally susceptible to accusations of <b>vote-buying</b> and influence-peddling. The anti-whaling side within IWC are accused of using conservation as a cover for their ideological opposition to whaling itself, which mirrors the accusation from the anti-whaling side that Japan's scientific whaling is a cover for commercial whaling. Since 2000, 29 new countries have joined the IWC, 18 of them pro-whaling, 11 anti. Japan notes that major anti-whaling nations such as the U.S. Australia, UK and New Zealand also donate aid to poor countries on the IWC and wield far more influence than Japan alone and thus they could easily be accused of the same tactics. Moreover, Japan is pushing to have secret ballot voting. Had the allegations of <b>vote-buying</b> been true, such proposal would run counter to its alleged objective because it is impossible to monitor so called client members' vote. From Japan's point of view, secret ballot voting {{is the only way to}} counter the influence pedling of anti whaling side which Japan see as having more powerful collective influence within the IWC. One of the new 2006 members, Israel, voted consistently with the anti-whaling bloc, was asked specifically to join by the US. Belize, a country previously accused of having their vote bought and paid for by Japan by a number of countries and NGO's, shifted side and consistently voted with the anti-whaling block at the 2006 IWC meeting. Anti-whaling nations oppose secret ballot voting on the grounds that it is without precedent in other international bodies and would have removed accountability and made behind-the-scenes deals between delegations more likely. St Kitts and Nevis Commissioner, Cedric Liburd, pointed out to various anti whaling counties during debate on the secret ballot vote on the first day of the 2006 meeting in St Kitts that it was extremely hypocritical of such countries to pontificate on the need for transparency within the IWC by open voting when such countries quite happily voted via secret ballot in CITES, a similar management body.|$|E
500|$|In {{common with}} Woodrow Wilson, Owen was a {{supporter}} of lowering tariffs. [...] He made an exception for the oil industry, where he argued that protection was needed for small independent producers, {{such as those in}} his state, against the ability of Standard Oil to import large volumes of cheap Mexican oil. Standard Oil was one of several trusts that Owen opposed during the course of his public career. He sought unsuccessfully to strengthen the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. [...] In 1916, he attacked what he described as the [...] "Lumber Trust," [...] which he said had bribed members of the Illinois legislature to elect William Lorimer to the Senate in 1909 (Lorimer's election had been overturned in 1912 due to evidence of [...] "corrupt methods" [...] including <b>vote-buying),</b> and had, Owen said, subsequently retaliated against Owen himself for his role in exposing the Lorimer scandal by funding efforts to defeat his own re-election. [...] Owen made several unsuccessful efforts to mandate effective disclosure of corporate campaign contributions in the interests of open government. [...] He was {{a supporter of}} the Sixteenth Amendment, passed by the Congress in 1909, which allowed the Congress to levy an income tax without apportioning it among the states or basing it on census results; a federal income tax was required inter alia {{to make up for the}} revenues lost to the federal government by reductions in tariff rates.|$|E
2500|$|Ultimately, however, Roemer {{defeated}} Leach in an all-Democratic [...] "general election" [...] under Louisiana law, held {{simultaneously with}} the Reagan-Carter presidential race. Wilson, despite the <b>vote-buying</b> allegations that had ruined his chances in 1978, hence failed {{to gain a}} spot in the general election.|$|E
2500|$|Parties and {{candidates}} {{have the right}} to appoint election observers to each polling district. Observers {{have the right to}} observe elections, monitor voting and demand adherence to the election laws. 15-20 thousand observers observe the elections. A citizen initiative [...] "white gloves" [...] (Lithuanian: [...] "baltosios pirštinės") was formed after the allegations of <b>vote-buying</b> in the 2012 election to Seimas and provide additional monitoring and reporting.|$|E
2500|$|This electoral {{exercise}} {{was marred by}} widespread reports of violence and tampering of election results, culminating in the walkout of 35 COMELEC computer technicians to protest the deliberate manipulation of the official election results to favor Ferdinand Marcos. [...] The walkout was considered {{as one of the}} early [...] "sparks" [...] of the People Power Revolution. The walkout also served as an affirmation to allegations of <b>vote-buying,</b> fraud, and tampering of election results by the KBL.|$|E
2500|$|In 1978, Roybal was {{involved}} in a <b>vote-buying</b> investigation known as the Koreagate scandal, in which he failed to properly report to the House Ethics Committee a gift of $1000 from a South Korean lobbyist, Tongsun Park. During the investigation by the Ethics Committee, Roybal mistakenly stated he had never met Park. [...] Park later testified that he had met Roybal four years earlier, for less than two minutes, and that he hardly remembered the man. In addition, Roybal voted against every bill that would have benefitted Park, thus discrediting allegations of a vote buying scheme.|$|E
2500|$|Japan has {{continued}} to face accusations of <b>vote-buying</b> within the IWC, as {{an increasing number of}} developing countries with little or no tradition of whaling join. [...] On March 8, 2008, Solomon Islands' Prime Minister Derek Sikua said that Japan had offered to pay for his country's delegates to attend the March 6, 2008 IWC meeting in London, and that he had refused the offer. [...] The whaling chief at Japan's Fisheries Agency denied the allegation. [...] A week before that IWC meeting, Japan hosted delegates from Angola, Cambodia, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ghana, Laos, Malawi, Palau, Tanzania and Vanuatu in Tokyo. [...] The delegates also visited the traditional whaling town of Taiji in western Japan.|$|E
2500|$|Having come so close, Wilson {{refused to}} accept defeat, and he {{continued}} to challenge Leach's victory. The Republicans supporting Wilson maintained that Leach won {{on the basis of}} votes bought by the Democrats in Vernon Parish, especially in the predominantly black section of Leesville known as [...] "The Crossing." [...] Wilson's challenge led to 22 persons pleading guilty to <b>vote-buying</b> on Leach's behalf in 1979 court litigation. Two others were convicted on similar charges. Leach himself was acquitted on November 3, 1979, by a federal district court in Lake Charles on bribery charges stemming from the 1978 general election. The U.S. Justice Department later dropped similar charges against Leach dealing with the 1978 primary.|$|E
2500|$|According to The Guardian, Peña Nieto's [...] "young, telegenic and impeccably smooth" [...] {{image has}} helped gloss over the PRI's {{reputation}} {{of corruption and}} authoritarianism. Such views are rare in Mexico City, where the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) holds strong support. Throughout the political campaigns, Peña Nieto poised to steer his party back into power and was, according to the polls, the favorite to win the elections. Some of his adversaries, however, said that the [...] "polls were manipulated" [...] and that the PRI was {{taking advantage of the}} poor to gain votes, instead of relying on informed voters. Allegations of <b>vote-buying</b> for Peña Nieto were widespread, but the PRI responded by claiming that its rivals were merely questioning the legitimacy of their victory.|$|E
2500|$|Jean-Claude Homawoo, an {{opposition}} representative on CENI, said that opposition supporters were totally disillusioned with the electoral process: [...] "So {{many times we}} went and voted in elections {{we knew we had}} won, only for the opposite result to be declared. So people have become tired. They don't believe their vote counts anymore." [...] Esso, the RPT Secretary-General, described the result as [...] "great victory that gives us a lot of satisfaction and wipes off any doubts about the process", while Bodjona dismissed the opposition as [...] "bad losers". For its part, the EU observer mission released a report that noted the accusations of <b>vote-buying</b> by the RPT, but also suggested there was no evidence to support opposition claims of outright fraud.|$|E
2500|$|Fabre {{alleged that}} the RPT had told his {{supporters}} that their fingerprints on the ballots could be traced {{and that they could}} therefore be hunted down and punished for their votes. He also repeated the accusations of <b>vote-buying</b> and [...] "massive" [...] fraud. Declaring that he was [...] "ready to die", Fabre led a group of UFC supporters in a protest on 7 March: [...] "We're going to make them exhaust their stock of tear gas. We cannot let this go on, otherwise they'll hang on to power for the next 200 years." [...] Although UFC supporters formed a protective cordon around Fabre, he was sprayed with tear gas and the protesters were forced to disperse, fleeing back to the UFC headquarters.|$|E
2500|$|The {{purpose of}} the IWC as {{specified}} in its constitution is [...] "in safeguarding for future generations the great natural resources represented by the whale stocks;" [...] and the original members consisted only of the 15 whale-hunting nations. However, since the late 1970s and early 1980s, many countries which have no previous history of whaling (some of which are landlocked such as Switzerland and Mongolia) have joined the IWC. This shift was first initiated by Sir Peter Scott, the then head of the World Wildlife Fund. Labelling the IWC a [...] "butchers' club", he mounted lobbying campaigns in developed countries {{with support from the}} green lobby and anti whaling block of IWC members to change the composition of the IWC's membership, which was instrumental in obtaining the necessary three-quarters majority vote to implement the moratorium on commercial whaling in 1986. This campaign triggered the first accusations of <b>vote-buying</b> in IWC. According to Scott's biographer, Elspeth Huxley, China's decision to join was influenced by a World Wildlife Fund promise to provide $1 million to fund a panda reserve. Dr. Michael Tillman, former IWC Commissioner of the United States, said in a radio interview that [...] "there was what we called 'common knowledge,' that a number of countries joined and that their dues and the travel support was reportedly due to conservation groups providing it. So that, in a sense, one could say that the conservation groups set out a strategy that the Japanese copied." ...|$|E
50|$|It was {{alleged that}} Dra. Rachel Santos Oca's Legal team have some proof of {{election}} <b>vote-buying</b> violations. Voters were allegedly required to wear yellow baller {{by the one}} who was the recipient of this <b>vote-buying</b> activity. Pandi is known for rampant <b>vote-buying</b> activities in the past elections but just like what the Honorable current COMELEC head said, not a single violator has been imprisoned yet in any of this democratic processes.|$|E

5000|$|The Comelec {{accredited}} Asian Network for Free Elections (Anfrel), through executive director, Thai Somsri Hananuntasuk, {{reported that}} in spite of automation, old problems of cheating and <b>vote-buying</b> still persisted. Minors were allowed to vote, poll officials influenced the voters or voted for them, and there were several instances of <b>vote-buying.</b> 22 of its foreign observers from 7countries in Southeast Asia—visited 443 precincts in the ARMM. The machines only prevented cheating in the counting and the canvassing, as it stopped [...] "dagdag-bawas" [...] or the vote padding and shaving of votes, but the machines failed to prevent the way voters are individually influenced—or even forced—to vote for particular candidates. The secrecy of the ballot was also violated since board of election inspectors often assisted voters, indicating their support for particular candidates, and <b>vote-buying</b> was rampant.|$|E

50|$|The Legal Network for Truthful Elections earlier {{noted the}} {{allegations}} of disenfranchisement and <b>vote-buying</b> during the election. While the commission said that {{those who were not}} in the voters list were either most likely had their registration deactivated for failing to vote in two consecutive elections, or were not registered in the first place, they will look into {{the allegations of}} <b>vote-buying.</b> Commissioner Christian Robert Lim said that they had no power to arrest those who were openly buying and selling votes without an arrest warrant.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{the day was}} {{marred by}} {{allegations}} of <b>vote-buying</b> against the BN made by the DAP. According to a DAP party worker, a tip-off was received by the party at around 12.00 pm that a vacant house was used to disburse <b>vote-buying</b> money. Voters were alleged to have received as much as RM200 (ca. US$58) from BN operatives. However, in an immediate reaction, MCA president Dato' Seri Ong Ka Ting brushed off the allegation, calling the DAP's allegations baseless and made for [...] "political mileage".|$|E

The EC chairman rejected the latter allegation, stating that such actions were legal and within the government's discretion. MCA president Ong also rejected the claims, saying it was common for the opposition to make such allegations after electoral defeats, and accused the DAP of being contradictory in first blaming the government for not developing Machap, but later saying the development was <b>vote-buying.</b>|$|E
