Pronounced tensile ductility of ∼ 13. 6 % and work-hardening ability are obtained for the composite with optimized microstructure. The effect of <b>remelting</b> <b>treatment</b> is attributed to the suppressed heterogeneous nucleation and growth of the crystalline phase from undercooled liquid, which may originate from the dissolution of oxides and nitrides {{as well as from}} the micro-scale homogenization of the melt...|$|R

In first step the phase compositions of coatings analyzed by XRD in initial condition and after remelting process. The morphology of the coatings top surface was described as well. All types of coatings were characterized by network of cracks on top surface of the coatings.

The microstructure of the melted zone and heat affected zone has been analyzed using an optical microscope. Then {{in view of the}} thermal physical parameters of material, latent heat and travelling heat sources, three-D FEA model of the transient temperature field during plasma arc remelting of the surface layer in EN-SGJ- 600 - 3 has been established based on ANSYS software. The APDL (ANSYS Parametric Design Language) has been used to describe the evolvement rules of the temperature field. The results show that the microstructure in the remelted zone is pearlite and ledeburite, whose microhardness reaches 1000 ~ 1060 HV. It is worth pointing out that the simulation results of remelted shape are in accordance with the experimental results. The temperature near the surface of the weld pool is the highest, which is up to 1794 ºC. This investigation will provide a guide for evaluating the validity of simulation studies...|$|R
40|$|Microstructures and {{properties}} of recycled composites ring parts containing cast tungsten carbide particles (CTCp) in a bainitic matrix fabricated from dead or waste composites roll rings by centrifugal casting after <b>remelting</b> <b>treatment,</b> {{have been tested}} using SEM, EDS and XRD analyses as well as mechanical property testers. The test {{results show that the}} CTCp surface were partially dissolved into the liquid iron at 1650 ºC during remelting. The undissolved CTCp in the Fe melt moved towards the outer region under the action of the centrifugal force during casting, which caused the formation of outer reinforced region and inner unreinforced region along the radial direction of the parts. SEM observation displays that the undissolved CTCp distribution in the outer region is even, and the volume fraction of them is increased with increasing rotational speed of the mold. Besides, mechanical tests of the parts show that the outer region exhibits superior hardness, and the inner region has sufficient impact toughness; the volume fraction of CTCP influences the mechanical properties. The dissolution-reprecipition of CTCP during centrifugal casting was also discussed...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the tribological behaviour of laser cladded aluminum bronze tool surfaces for dry metal forming. In a first part of this work a process window for cladding aluminum bronze on steel substrate was investigated to ensure a low dilution. Therefore, the cladding speed, the powder feed rate, the laser power and the distance between the process head and the substrate were varied. The target of the second part was to investigate the influence of different process parameters on the tribological behaviour of the cladded tracks. The laser claddings were carried out on both aluminum bronze and cold work tool steel as substrate materials. Two different particle sizes of the cladding powder material were used. The cladding speed was varied and a post-processing laser <b>remelting</b> <b>treatment</b> was applied. It is shown that the tribological behaviour of the surface in a dry oscillating ball-on-plate test is highly dependent on the substrate material.

In order to investigate the effect of applied laser treatments and used alloying powders on the microstructure and thermal fatigue resistance of processed surface layer of hot work tool steels, the microstructure evaluation by light microscopy, hardness test, and dedicated thermal fatigue resistance test were performed. The best results regarding fatigue cracks inhibition was obtained when the surface of hot work tool steels was alloyed with TiC and VC carbides at the laser beam power of 2. 0 and 2. 3 kW. The grain refinement effect of laser remelting has a lower impact on the thermal crack inhibition, than a strong strengthening effect of matrix saturation in alloying elements and precipitation of fine carbides in the steel matrix...|$|R

40|$|International audienceCellular Automaton (CA) - Finite Element (FE) {{modeling}} is {{an efficient}} way to simulate the nucleation and growth of solidification grain structures in the context of casting processes. The methodology is reported to reach predictions for competition between columnar and equiaxed grain structures [1], coupling with microsegregation due to diffusion of species [2], macrosegregation due to fluid flow [3] and solid transport [4]. Recent comparisons with in-situ and real time x-ray radiography observations of solidifying alloys have also reported the current limits of the model and the need for more systematic characterizations of benchmark experiments [5]. One of the limits currently faced is the possibility to predict grain structures for large cast parts. While CAFE simulations can deal with volume sizes that are typical of the investment casting process [6], it requires extensions for other processes. The present keynote will list the efforts recently made to overpass this difficulty. They are based on parallel computations and dynamic allocation strategies in order to focus the computation resources in the region of the mushy zone. While the above progresses were necessary, they did not permit to handle simulation of the grain structure during welding processes. This {{is due to the fact}} that the coupon contains an initial grain structure that must be known at all locations and at any time in order to compute its local melting and the epitaxial growth from partially melted grains, typical of the solidification of the weld pool. A solution is presented in the present paper that permits simulation of multiple passes in welding processes for large computational domains. This achievement allows for grain structure manufacturing in welding processes and <b>remelting</b> surface <b>treatments,</b> as show in the figure below...|$|R
40|$|The postcondensation of nylon 6 in {{the solid}} state was studied. The {{reactions}} {{were carried out}} on fine powder in a fluidized bed reactor in a stream of dry nitrogen in the temperature range 110 - 205 °C and during 1 - 24 h. The solid-state polymerization (SSP) did not follow melt kinetics, but {{was found to be}} limited by the diffusion of the autocatalyzing acid chain end group. Factors thought to influence SSP were studied, e. g., heat treatment, starting molecular weight, and <b>remelting.</b> Surprisningly, heat <b>treatment</b> had little effect, but the starting molecular weight had a strong effect on the reaction rate. The higher the starting molecular weight, the faster the reaction. This could be explained as a changing concentration distribution of the reactive groups in the solid state on SSP. The kinetics of the SSP had more than one region, and the rate of reaction for conversions of over 30 % could be expressed as - dc/dt = k(c/t), where k is a dimensionless constant independent of temperature with a value of 0. 28. The integrated form has the form - In(c/co) = k In(t/), where co is the acid end-group concentration at the start, t is the reaction time, and is the induction time. The value of is both dependent on the starting concentration co and the reaction temperature and has an activation energy of 105 kJ/mol...|$|R
40|$|A {{systematic}} {{research into the}} cladding of stellite 6 on stainless steel by pulsed Nd:YAG laser has been carried out. The effects of pulse energy, pulse frequency, powder mass flow rate and spot overlap on the clad layer height, dilution and heat-affected zone (HAZ) have been examined. It was found that both the clad height and penetration into the substrate increase with the pulse energy, spot overlap and pulse frequency, but {{the effects of these}} parameters on dilution are complex. The dilution reaches the lowest value (4 %) at the incident energy of 18 and 25 J/ pulse, spot overlap of 89 % and pulse frequency of 40 Hz. The powder mass flow rate of 22 g/min (for energy of 25 J/pulse and spot overlap of 83 %) produces thick clad layer with low dilution but results in the formation of defects. The hardness of the clad layer decreases linearly with increasing dilution. No cracks have been found in single-track clad layers at a spot overlap of 89 %, however, cracks occurred at lower spot overlap. These cracks were eliminated by the multi-track cladding when the track increment is less than 1 / 3 of the width of track, which is believed to be due to the <b>remelting</b> or heat <b>treatment</b> of the previous clad track by the subsequent track. The track bands in multi-track clad show coarser structure, higher element segregation and lower hardness...|$|R
40|$|One {{the most}} {{important}} limitations to the industrial use of hard coatings in severe conditions is associated with their limited adhesion to the substrate. A number of research works {{have been done in}} various directions in order to improve the adhesion by post treatments such as laser <b>remelting</b> or thermal <b>treatments.</b> The aim of this work is to evaluate the possibility of using the substrate itself as a carbon source, in order to create very adherent hard titanium carbide coatings by means of a diffusion/precipitation process. A film of pure titanium was prepared by magnetron sputtering on a high carbon content steel substrate. Coated samples were then annealed in vacuum for 1 h at temperature ranging from 500 to 1100 °C. It was observed that the film was totally, partially or not transformed into titanium carbide, depending on heat treatment temperature. The transformation of titanium layer in titanium carbide takes place firstly at the interface between the film and the substrate, then it expands through the whole film thickness, toward the outer surface, by diffusion of carbon coming from the substrate. As a result, complete conversion of the titanium film in titanium carbide is obtained when an annealing temperature of 1100 °C is used. A higher adhesion, measured by means of a scratch tester, is found for this coating if compared to the one obtained on samples treated at lower temperatures and to other literature data on coatings having similar thickness and composition...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCold Gas Dynamic Spray is an {{emerging}} coating technology {{based on the}} use of a supersonic gas jet to accelerate (up to 1000 m/s) and to impact a powder, with size ranging from 1 to 50 μm in diameter, on a substrate. Due to the high speed, during the impact, the powder undergoes a severe plastic deformation such that it adheres on the substrate. Thanks to this method, it is possible to produce up to fully dense metallic coatings on substrates of different materials. With this technology, different kinds of powder (metals, polymers, ceramics, composite materials and nanocrystalline powders) or their mixing can be deposited. Among the various possible powders that can be deposited by cold spray, titanium {{is one of the most}} attractive materials thanks to its potential applications. A titanium layer produced onto a softer materials (i. e. aluminium alloys) could improve both the corrosion resistance and the wear properties of the components. However, the coating made with this technique could be affected by several problems, such as porosity, high roughness and low mechanical properties. A possible solution for this issues is the use of laser <b>remelting</b> post-deposition <b>treatment.</b> The present investigation deals with the application of a continuous wave diode laser in order to change the coating properties and metallographic structure. With this aim, laser remelting of a titanium cold sprayed layer were carried out on samples of grade 2 titanium alloy, 5 mm thick, obtained by cold spray technique, by using a 220 W diode laser at different scan speed. In order to avoid the influence of the particular substrate, the laser remelting process was carried after the detachment of the coating from the substrate. After laser treatments, light and SEM microscopy were carried out to analyze the geometry of remelted zone and the evolution of its microstructure morphology. Moreover, micro-hardness measurements were made to evaluate the mechanical properties. Three different metallurgical structures corresponding to the remelted zone, the heat affected zone and base material were observed. The remelted zone showed an elliptical shape, with a depth up to 0. 7 mm and a martensitic microstructure. Furthermore, in this zone, hardness higher than the base material (more than threefold) was found. In conclusion, it is possible to affirm that the laser remelting is a promising technique to improve the superficial properties of titanium cold sprayed layers...|$|R
