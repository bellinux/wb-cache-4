50|$|Hekluskogar is a reforesting {{project in}} Iceland near the volcano Hekla. The main {{objective}} is to reclaim woodlands of native birch and willow to the slopes of Hekla starting with soil fertilisation and grass sowing. This would prevent <b>volcanic</b> ash from <b>blowing</b> over nearby areas after eruption in Hekla and help to reduce wind erosion. It is the largest reforestation of its type in Europe and is estimated to cover 1% of the area of Iceland.|$|R

He gloried in the Christmas-tide delicacies which Marilla and Mrs. Lynde vied with each other in preparing for Anne, and he was reading an enthralling tale, in a school library book, of a wonderful hero who seemed blessed with a miraculous faculty for getting into scrapes from which he was usually delivered by an earthquake or a <b>volcanic</b> explosion, which <b>blew</b> him high and dry out of his troubles, landed him in a fortune, and closed the story with proper ECLAT.|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{transmittance}} of Antarctic snow {{as a function}} of the thickness of snow layers, in the range between 350 and 900 nm. Samples were studied near Scott Base, Ross Island, and data are presented for measurements made in early December 1996. The transmittance followed the two flux theoretical expressions well, and scattering and absorption parameters were obtained by curve fitting. Scattering dominated the transmittance at shorter wavelengths. The absorption at shorter wavelengths varied from one site to another, being lowest for snow samples measured furthest away from Ross Island, suggesting the effects of <b>blown</b> <b>volcanic</b> dust. The snow albedo derived from the transmittance parameters is compared with those of other workers...|$|R
50|$|At 01:00 on 23 January 1973, a {{volcanic}} eruption {{of the mountain}} Eldfell began on Heimaey. The ground on Heimaey started to quake and fissures formed. The fissures grew to 1600 m in length, and lava began to erupt. Lava sprayed into the air from the fissures. <b>Volcanic</b> ash was <b>blown</b> to sea. Later, the situation deteriorated. When the fissures closed, the eruption converted to a concentrated lava flow that headed toward the harbour. The winds changed, and half a million cubic metres of ash blew on the town. During the night, the 5,000 inhabitants of the island were evacuated, mostly by fishing boats, as almost the entire fishing fleet was in dock.|$|R
60|$|We coasted up {{the shore}} of the lake in a north-westerly direction, {{sounding}} all the time. We found the lake deep and the bottom rocky and steeply shelving toward the center, and once when I moved straight out from shore to take other soundings we could find no bottom whatsoever. In open spaces along the shore we caught occasional glimpses of the distant cliffs, and here they appeared only a trifle less precipitous than those which bound Caprona on the seaward side. My theory is that in a far distant era Caprona was a mighty mountain--perhaps the world's mightiest <b>volcanic</b> action <b>blew</b> off the entire crest, blew thousands of feet of the mountain upward and outward and onto the surrounding continent, leaving a great crater; and then, possibly, the continent sank as ancient continents have been known to do, leaving only the summit of Caprona above the sea. The encircling walls, the central lake, the hot springs which feed the lake, all point to a conclusion, and the fauna and the flora bear indisputable evidence that Caprona was once part of some great land-mass.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} trends in {{and patterns of}} emergency department visits and hospitalizations for respiratory disease {{on the island of}} Hawaii from 1981 to 1991. We found that emergency department visit rates and hospitalization rates for both asthma and COPD for 1987 to 1991 increased in all regions of the island in comparison with such rates for 1981 to 1986. Rates of emergency department visits and hospitalizations for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD, but not asthma, were significantly higher in the high-exposure Kona side of the island than in the intermittent-exposure Hilo side of the island during 1983 and 1988 to 1990. We also found that during the weeks that winds were from the west, <b>blowing</b> <b>volcanic</b> air pollution toward Hilo, emergency department visits for asthma increased 15 %. Some of the results of our study support the hypothesis that volcanic air pollution affects respiratory health on the island of Hawaii, while other results do not. Any future studies should include measurements of air pollutant levels...|$|R
40|$|A newly {{designed}} apparatus for {{experimental studies of}} pyroclastic flows consists of a cylindrical conduit that is filled with samples of natural <b>volcanic</b> products (tephra). <b>Blowing</b> nozzles in the base plate of the conduit are connected to a volume of highly pressurized gas. Opening of fast solenoid valves results in impulse-like coupling of the released gas to the sample. The system was designed so that the range of mechanical energy transferred to the particle mass in the conduit reflects the mechanical energy observed and measured during fragmentation experiments with melts of similar composition. Depending on the specific mechanical energy (SME) of the system, which results from Delta PV/m, where Delta P is gas overpressure (i. e., pressure > atmospheric), V is gas volume, and m is sample mass, different behaviors are observed. If SME > 2. 6 kJ/kg, a dilute plume develops, and particles are sedimented by fallout exclusively. If SME 10 (6), implying that flows are fully turbulent and that particle coupling to gas turbulence of natural pyroclastic flows is replicated by the experiments. The measured shear current velocities are proportional to the impact mass flow rate, i. e., the product of mixture density and impact velocity. Experimental data and grain-size analysis of the produced particle deposits suggest that {{the scale of the}} experiment is large enough to reproduce the transport dynamics of natural pyroclastic flows...|$|R
40|$|In 1986 the {{eruption}} of Kilauea Volcano changed from the episodic fountaining of lava and gas at Pu`u O`o cone every few weeks to the continuous outpouring of lava from a new vent only 3 kilometers away. The volcano began releasing a large, steady supply of sulfur dioxide gas into the atmosphere. During the episodic activity, enough time had elapsed between fountaining episodes for the prevailing trade winds (brisk winds from the northeast of Hawai`i) to <b>blow</b> <b>volcanic</b> gas away from the island. When {{the eruption}} style changed, however, the daily release {{of as much as}} 2, 000 tons of sulfur dioxide gas led to a persistent air pollution problem downwind. The sulfur dioxide (SO 2) gas released reacts chemically with sunlight, oxygen, dust particles, and water in the air to form a mixture of sulfate (S 04 - 2) aerosols (tiny particles and droplets), sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4), and other oxidized sulfur species. Together, this gas and aerosol mixture produces a hazy atmospheric condition known as volcanic smog or "vog. " The condition is illustrated with 7 photographs, a shaded-relief map of the Island of Hawai`i showing the wind patterns, and a diagram of 1992 - 1997 SO 2 emissions rates from Kilauea Volcano's east rift zone.

40|$|Etihad Airways in the {{national}} airline of United Arab Emirates. From its formation in 2003 to 2011, Etihad has grown its fleet size to 62 aircraft that serve 72 destinations in 47 countries. Like all international airlines, Etihad {{is no stranger to}} unpredictable crises, and has had to deal with successive challenges arising from SARS pandemic in 2003; the global recession from 2008 to 2011; the H 1 N 1 pandemic in 2010; the Iceland volcanic eruption and resulting cloud in 2010; the extreme weather in the United Kingdom in ate 2010 and more recently the earthquake and tsunami affecting Japan in March 2011. The 9 / 11 attacks in the USA and SARS were estimated to have cost the airline industry over US$ 25 billion. According to former IATA Chief Executive the industry lost US $ 9. 4 billion in 2007 {{as a result of the}} global recession. Still more recetnly in 2010, the first three days of Eyjafjallajokull volcanic eruption in Iceland resulted in revenue losses of US $ 400 million each day for airlines. At one stage during the crisis it was estimated that 20 % of the global aviation and 1. 2 million passengers a day were affected by the airspace closure ordered by European governments. The entire event, which lasted over a week, led to over 100, 000 flights being grounded and caused an estimated loss of more than US$ 1. 7 billion for the aviation industry. The Iceland volcano took the aviation industry by surprise when the main eruption on 14 April 2010 sent pulverized volcanic rock, ash and glass shards as high as 11, 000 meters into the atmosphere. Iceland can be avoided on most glight paths but what complicated matters was that Eyjafjallajokull lay under a jet stream. A jet stream is a narrow stream of strong concentrated winds extending from 10, 000 to 40, 000 feet above the ground. This resulted in a plume of <b>volcanic</b> ash being <b>blown</b> towards Europe as strong speeds of about 400 km per hour expanding at a width of 50 to 100 kilometers. This scattered ash reduced visibility. Volcanic ash in the past was known to cause jet engines to stall and could affect sensitive electronics and scratch glass. This case documents how Etihad as an organisation successfully managed a crisis that took the whole aviation industry by surprise...|$|R
40|$|The studies {{described}} here base mainly on sedimentary material {{collected during the}} "Indian Ocean Expedition" of the German research vessel "Meteor" {{in the region of}} the Indian-Pakistan continental margin in February and March 1965. Moreover,samples {{from the mouth of the}} Indus-River were available, which were collected by the Pakistan fishing vessel "Machhera" in March 1965. Altogether, the following quantities of sedimentary material were collected: 59. 73 m piston cores. 54. 52 m gravity cores. 33 box grab samples. 68 bottom grab samples Component analyses of the coarse fraction were made of these samples and the sedimentary fabric was examined. Moreover, the CaCO 3 and Corg contents were discussed. From these investigations the following history of sedimentation can be derived: Recent sedimentation on the shelf is mainly characterized by hydrodynamic processes and terrigenous supply of material. In the shallow water wave action and currents running parallel to the coast, imply a repeated reworking which induces a sorting of the grains and layering of the sediments as well as a lack of bioturbation. The sedimentation rate is very high here. From the coast-line down to appr. 50 m the sediment becomes progressively finer, the conditions of deposition become less turbulent. On the outer shelf the sediment is again considerably coarser. It contains many relicts of planktonic organisms and it shows traces of burrowing. Indications for redeposition are nearly missing, a considerable part of the fine fraction of the sediments is, however, whirled up and carried away. In wide areas of the outer shelf this stirring has gained such a degree that recent deposits are nearly completely missing. Here, coarse relict sands rich in ooids are exposed, which were formed in very shallow stirred water during the time when the sea reached its lowest level, i. e. at the turn of the Pleistocene to the Holocene. Below the relict sand white, very fine-grained aragonite mud was found at one location (core 228). This aragonite mud was obviously deposited in very calm water of some greater depth, possibly behind a reef barrier. Biochemic carbonate precipitation played an important part in the formation of relict sands and aragonite muds. In postglacial times the relict sands were exposed for long periods to violent wave action and to areal erosion. In the present days they are gradually covered by recent sediments proceeding from the sides. On the continental margin beyond the shelf edge the distribution of the sediments is to a considerable extent determined by the morphology of the sea bottom. The material originating from the continent and/or the shelf, is less transported by action of the water than by the force of gravity. Within the range of the uppermost part of the continental slope recent sedimentation reaches its maximum. Here the fine material is deposited which has been whirled up in the zone of the relict sands. A laminated fine-grained sediment is formed here due to the very high sedimentation rate as well as to the extremely low O 2 -content in the bottom water, which prevents life on the bottom of the sea and impedes thus also bioturbation. The lamination probaly reflects annual variation in deposition and can be attributed to the rhythm of the monsoon with its effects on the water and the weather conditions. In the lower part of the upper continental slope sediments are to be found which show in varying intensity, intercalations of fine material (silt) from the shelf, in large sections of the core. These fine intercalations of allochthonous material are closely related to the autochthonous normal sediment, so that a great number of small individual depositional processes can be inferred. In general the intercalations are missing in the uppermost part of the cores; in the lower part they can be met in different quantities, and they reach their maximum frequency in the upper part of the lower core section. The depositions {{described here}} were designated as turbid layer sediments, since they get their material from turbid layers, which transport components to the continental slope which have been whirled up from the shelf. Turbidites are missing in this zone. Since the whole upper continental slope shows a low oxygen-content of the bottom water the structure of the turbid layer sediments is more or less preserved. The lenticular-phacoidal fine structure does, however, not reflect annual rhythms, but sporadic individual events, as e. g. tsunamis. At the lower part of the continental slope and on the continental rise the majority of turbidites was deposited, which, during glacial times and particularly at the beginning of the post-glacial period, transported material from the zone of relict sands. The Laccadive Ridge represented a natural obstacle for the transport of suspended sediments into the deep sea. Core SIC- 181 from the Arabian Basin shows some intercalations of turbidites; their material, however, does not originate from the Indian Shelf, but from the Laccadive Ridge. Within the range of the Indus Cone it is surprising that distinct turbidites are nearly completely missing; on the other hand, turbid layer sediments are to be found. The bottom of the sea is showing still a slight slope here, so that the turbidites funneled through the Canyon of the Swatch probably rush down to greater water depths. Due to the particularly large supply of suspended material by theIndus River the turbid layer sediments show farther extension than in other regions. In general the terrigenous components are concentrated on the Indus Cone. It is within the range of the lower continental slope that the only discovery of a sliding mass (core 186) has been located. It can be assumed that this was set in motion during the Holocene. During the period of time discussed here the following development of kind and intensity of the deposition of allochthonous material can be observed on the Indian-Pakistan continental margin: At the time of the lowest sea level the shelf was only very narrow, and the zone in which bottom currents were able to stir up material by oscillating motion, was considerably confined. The rivers flowed into the sea near to the edge of the shelf. For this reason the percentage of terrigenous material, quartz and mica is higher in the lower part of many cores (e. g. cores 210 and 219) than in the upper part. The transition from glacial to postglacial times caused a series of environmental changes. Among them the rise of the sea level (in the area of investigation appr. 150 m) had the most important influence on the sedimentation process. In connection with this event many river valleys became canyons, which sucked sedimentary material away from the shelf and transported it in form of turbidites into the deep sea. During the rise of the sea level a situation can be expected with a maximum area of the comparatively plane shelf being exposed to wave action. During this time the process of stirring up of sediments and formation of turbid layers will reach a maximum. Accordingly, the formation of turbidites and turbid layer sediments are most frequent at the same time. This happened in general in the older polstglacial period. The present day high water level results in a reduced supply of sediments into the canyons. The stirring up of sediments from the shelf by wave action is restricted to the finest material. The missing of shelf material in the uppermost core sections can thus be explained. The laminated muds reflect these calm sedimentation conditions as well. In the southwestern part of the area of investigation fine <b>volcanic</b> glass was <b>blown</b> in during the Pleistocene, probably from the southeast. It has thus become possible to correlate the cores 181, 182, 202. Eolian dust from the Indian subcontinent represents probably an important component of the deep sea sediments. The chemism of the bottom as well as of the pore water has a considerable influence on the development of the sediments. Of particular importance in this connection is a layer with a minimum content of oxygen in the sea water (200 - 1500 m), which today touches the upper part of the continental slope. Above and beyond this oxygen minimum layer somewhat higher O 2 -values are to be observed at the sea bottom. During the Pleistocene the oxygen minimum layer has obviously been locatedin greater depth as is indicated by the facies of laminated mud occuring in the lower part of core 219. The type of bioturbation is mainly determined by the chemism. Moreover, the chemism is responsible for a considerable selective dissolution, either complete or partial, of the sedimentary components. Within the range of the oxygen minimum layer an alkaline milieu is developed at the bottom. This causes a complete or partial dissolution of the siliceous organisms. Here, bioturbation is in general completely missing; sometimes small pyrite-filled burrowing racks are found. In the areas rich in O 2 high pH-values result in a partial dissolution of the calcareous shells. Large, non-pyritized burrowing tracks characterize the type of bioturbation in this environment. A study of the "lebensspuren" in the cores supports the assumption that, particularly within the region of the Laccadive Basin, the oxygen content in the bottom sediments was lower than during the Holocene. This may be attributed to a high sedimentation rate and to a lower O 2 -content of the bottom water. The composition of the allochthonous sedimentary components, detritus and/or volcanic glass may locally change the chemism to a considerable extent for a certain time; under such special circumstances the type of bioturbation and the state of preservation of the components may be different from those of the normal sediment...|$|R
