40|$|Low {{temperature}} {{alteration of}} oceanic basement rocks {{is characterized by}} net gain of sulfur, which commonly yields low d 34 S values, suggesting involvement of microbial sulfate reduction. In order to test whether secondary sulfide minerals are consistent with a biogenic source, we apply high precision multiple sulfur isotope analysis to bulk rock sulfide and pyrite isolates from two contrasting types of altered oceanic basement rocks, namely serpentinized peridotites and altered basalts. Samples from two peridotite sites (Iberian Margin and Hess Deep) and from a basalt site on the eastern flank of the Juan de Fuca Ridge yield overlapping d 34 S values ranging from 0 <b>per</b> <b>mil</b> to - 44 <b>per</b> <b>mil.</b> In contrast, sulfides in the basalt site are characterized by relatively low D 33 S values ranging from - 0. 06 <b>per</b> <b>mil</b> to 0. 04 <b>per</b> <b>mil,</b> compared to those from peridotite sites (0. 00 <b>per</b> <b>mil</b> to 0. 16 <b>per</b> <b>mil).</b> The observed D 33 S signal is significant considering the analytical precision of 0. 014 <b>per</b> <b>mil</b> (2 sigma). We present a batch reaction model that uses observed d 34 S and D 33 S relationships to quantify the effect of closed system processes and constrain the isotope enrichment factor intrinsic to sulfate reduction. The estimated enrichment factors as large as 61 <b>per</b> <b>mil</b> and 53 <b>per</b> <b>mil,</b> for peridotite and basalt sites respectively, suggest the involvement of microbial sulfate reduction. The relatively high D 33 S values in the peridotite sites are due to sulfate reduction in a closed system environment, whereas negative D 33 S values in the basalt site reflect open system sulfate reduction. A larger extent of sulfate reduction during alteration of peridotite to serpentinite is consistent with its higher H 2 production capacity compared to basalt alteration, and further supports in-situ microbial sulfate reduction coupled with H 2 production during serpentinization reactions...|$|R
40|$|Iron {{stable isotope}} {{signatures}} (d 56 Fe) in hemolymph (bivalve blood) of the Antarctic bivalve Laternula elliptica {{were analyzed by}} Multiple Collector-Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) to test whether the isotopic fingerprint can be tracked back to the predominant sources of the assimilated Fe. An earlier investigation of Fe concentrations in L. elliptica hemolymph suggested that an assimilation of reactive and bioavailable Fe (oxyhydr) oxide particles (i. e. ferrihydrite), precipitated from pore water Fe around the benthic boundary, {{is responsible for the}} high Fe concentration in L. elliptica (Poigner et al., 2013, doi: 10. 1016 /j. ecss. 2013. 10. 027). At two stations in Potter Cove (King George Island, Antarctica) bivalve hemolymph showed mean d 56 Fe values of - 1. 19 ± 0. 34 <b>per</b> <b>mil</b> and - 1. 04 ± 0. 39 <b>per</b> <b>mil,</b> respectively, which is between 0. 5 <b>per</b> <b>mil</b> and 0. 85 <b>per</b> <b>mil</b> lighter than the pool of easily reducible Fe (oxyhydr) oxides of the surface sediments (- 0. 3 <b>per</b> <b>mil</b> to - 0. 6 <b>per</b> <b>mil).</b> This is in agreement with the enrichment of lighter Fe isotopes at higher trophic levels, resulting from the preferential assimilation of light isotopes from nutrition. Nevertheless, d 56 Fe hemolymph values from both stations showed a high variability, ranging between - 0. 21 <b>per</b> <b>mil</b> (value close to unaltered/primary Fe(oxyhydr) oxide minerals) and - 1. 91 <b>per</b> <b>mil</b> (typical for pore water Fe or diagenetic Fe precipitates), which we interpret as a "mixed" d 56 Fe signature caused by Fe assimilation from different sources with varying Fe contents and d 56 Fe values. Furthermore, mass dependent Fe fractionation related to physiological processes within the bivalve cannot be ruled out. This is the first study addressing the potential of Fe isotopes for tracing back food sources of bivalves...|$|R

Concentrations of finely disseminated OM in the sediments were low (generally 0. 1 to 0. 5 wt%) and show organic d 13 C isotope values (generally - 22 <b>per</b> <b>mil</b> to - 24 <b>per</b> <b>mil)</b> indicative of marine to mixed marine and land-derived OM. The shipboard sedimentologists noted {{and the author}} collected seven samples of discrete centimeter-size chunks of organic carbon-rich material, such as fragments of wood, from cores from the five sites. The d 13 C values in these samples ranged from - 24 <b>per</b> <b>mil</b> to - 30 <b>per</b> <b>mil.</b> Humic material extracted from two wood/lignite samples and one plant fragment sample has nearly the same 13 C value as the bulk material. The 13 C values of humic extracts from the woody materials {{are different from those}} of marine materials, indicating that the extractable material is original, land-derived OM rather than absorbed/adsorbed OM from the marine environment. The d 13 C values (- 28 <b>per</b> <b>mil</b> to - 30 <b>per</b> <b>mil)</b> for the two plant fragment samples appear unusually light but are probably reasonable for nonwoody land-derived OM, which is rarely observed, preserved, or analyzed in deep-sea cores. Assuming carbon isotope values of - 20 <b>per</b> <b>mil</b> for "pure" marine and - 27 <b>per</b> <b>mil</b> for "pure" terrigenous OM, samples from Leg 184 generally preserve 40 %- 60 % marine and 40 %- 60 % terrigenous OM.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a study of the stable isotopic and chemical composition of secondary carbonate minerals precipitated within basalts at Ocean Drilling Program Sites 707 and 715. At Site 715, the secondary carbonates are all composed of calcite and display a narrow range of carbon and oxygen stable isotope ratios, with values ranging from - 2. 75 <b>per</b> <b>mil</b> to 1. 95 <b>per</b> <b>mil</b> PDB and - 0. 27 <b>per</b> <b>mil</b> to 2. 86 <b>per</b> <b>mil</b> PDB, respectively. Strontium, iron, and manganese values of the samples are generally low. The geochemistry of Site 715 samples indicates that they precipitated from seawater-domi- nated fluids, at low temperatures, as is typical of secondary carbonates from most Deep Sea Drilling Project sites. In contrast, at Site 707, aragonite, siderite, and manganese-rich calcite occur as secondary carbonates in addition to calcite. The carbon isotopes of the Site 707 carbonates of all rock types are depleted in 13 C. Values range from - 2. 79 <b>per</b> <b>mil</b> to - 16. 43 <b>per</b> <b>mil</b> PDB. Oxygen isotope values do not show a wide variation, ranging from - 1. 78 <b>per</b> <b>mil</b> to 1. 17 <b>per</b> <b>mil.</b> The strontium contents of the samples range from 5200 to 8100 ppm for aragonites, and from 145 to 862 ppm for calcites. Iron and manganese contents are high in calcites and siderites and low in aragonites. Site 707 carbonates precipitated at low temperatures in a fairly closed system, in which basalt-seawater interaction has greatly influenced the chemistry of the pore fluids. The reactions occurring within the system before and in conjunction with secondary carbonate precipita- tion include oxidation of isotopically light methane, derived from fluids circulating within the basalts, and reduction of substantial amounts of iron and manganese oxides from the basalts...|$|R

Concentrations and isotopic compositions of TOC are relatively uniform within the entire section, showing some minor perturbation within the décollement zone. In the uppermost 100 m, upsection increases in TN concentrations at constant TOC concentrations produce significant increases in atomic TOC/TN ratios from ~ 8 to ~ 18. Carbonate (calcite) contents in the wedge sediments are generally low (< 4 wt%), but the d 13 C and Vienna standard mean ocean water (VSMOW) d 18 OVSMOW values vary significantly from - 26. 1 <b>per</b> <b>mil</b> to + 4. 1 <b>per</b> <b>mil</b> and from + 30. 0 <b>per</b> <b>mil</b> to + 35. 3 <b>per</b> <b>mil,</b> respectively.

40|$|The basaltic {{rocks of}} Hole 794 D drilled during Leg 128 are {{strongly}} altered. Microprobe analyses and XRD spectra on small quantities of matter extracted from thin sections show that primary minerals and glassy zones of the groundmass are totally or partially replaced by clay minerals with chlorite/saponite mixed-layer composition whatever the rock sample considered. This mixed-layer was also identified in veins and vesicles where it crystallizes in spheroidal aggregates. The largest veins and vesicles are filled by a zoned deposit: the chlorite/saponite mixed-layer always occupies {{the central part}} and is rimmed by pure saponite. Calcite crystallizes in secondary fractures which crosscut the clayey veins and vesicles. Chemographic analysis based on the M+- 4 Si- 3 R 2 + projection shows that the chemical composition of the saponite component in the mixed-layer is identical {{to that of the}} free saponite. This indicates that the clay mineral crystallization was controlled by the chemical composition of the alteration fluids. From petrographic evidence, it is suggested that both chlorite/saponite mixed-layer and free saponite belong to the same hydrothermal event and are produced by a temperature decrease. This is supported by the stable isotopic data. The isotopic data show very little variation: d 18 O saponite ranges from 13. 1 <b>per</b> <b>mil</b> to 13. 5 <b>per</b> <b>mil,</b> and dD saponite from - 73. 6 <b>per</b> <b>mil</b> to - 70. 0 <b>per</b> <b>mil.</b> d 18 O calcite varies from + 19. 7 <b>per</b> <b>mil</b> to + 21. 9 <b>per</b> <b>mil</b> vs SMOW and d 13 C from - 3. 2 <b>per</b> <b>mil</b> to + 0. 4 <b>per</b> <b>mil</b> vs. PDB.

The rapid 1. 2 <b>per</b> <b>mil</b> oxygen isotope increase recorded by benthic foraminifers just above the Eocene/Oligocene boundary represents the ubiquitous early Oligocene d 18 O event. The shift here is unique, however, as it coincided with the sudden appearance of ice-rafted debris (IRD), providing the first direct link between Antarctic glacial activity and the earliest Oligocene d 18 O increase. The d 18 O increase caused by the ice-volume change in the early Oligocene is constrained by (1) related changes in the planktonic to benthic foraminifer d 18 O gradient at Site 748 and (2) comparisons of late Eocene and early Oligocene planktonic foraminifer d 18 Ovalues from various latitudes.

40|$|The Hellyer massive {{sulphide}} deposit {{lies within}} the Mount Read Volcanics province of western Tasmania. Before mining, it consisted largely of pyrite, sphalerite, galena, arsenopyrite and chalcopyrite, and was overlain by discontinuous barite–sulphide and/or silica–sulphide assemblages. It overlay a downward-tapering cone of hydrothermally altered rocks that shows concentric mineral zonation and contains steeply inclined veins containing sulphide and/or barite. New laser ablation and existing conventional sulphur isotopic compositions of sulphides from the massive sulphide ore range from - 5. 0 <b>per</b> <b>mil</b> to 12. 2 <b>per</b> <b>mil.</b> There {{is no significant}} spatial variation in sulphur isotopic composition in the sulphide ore, or evidence of {{significant change in the}} textural paragenesis, but there is considerable variation at millimetre scale within and between minerals. Apart from the few negative values, which may be of biogenic origin, the sulphur data can be explained by mixtures of sulphur reduced from seawater sulphate and that derived directly or indirectly from magma. The sulphur of the barite cap and the barite veins in the footwall (mostly 33. 5 – 46. 0 <b>per</b> <b>mil)</b> is probably also derived from seawater sulphate, and radiogenic 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values in the barite (0. 70989 – 0. 71144) suggest fluid circulation deep into the basement. delta 34 S values of disseminated sulphides in the footwall alteration cone are like those of overlying ore, the aqueous sulphur being totally reduced due to low fluid velocities and protracted rock interaction. However, unusually high delta 34 S sulphide values (up to 41. 4 <b>per</b> <b>mil)</b> are found in some of the footwall vein sulphides, probably because in these veins the fluid velocities are enhanced and rock interaction limited, so that pyrite supersaturation may occur before reduction of entrained seawater sulphate is complete. High delta 34 S sulphide values (up to 45. 6 <b>per</b> <b>mil)</b> also occur in ‘‘unaltered’’ volcanic rock outside the alteration cone and may be the product of local convection of seawater prior to, during, or (most probably) after massive sulphide mineralization. Fluid delta 18 O values calculated from isotopic analyses of quartz in footwall veins (8. 5 – 11. 8 <b>per</b> <b>mil)</b> and Th data range between 4. 4 <b>per</b> <b>mil</b> and 3. 1 <b>per</b> <b>mil.</b> Dolomite occurs with chlorite in the core of the footwall alteration cone immediately below the massive sulphide.
