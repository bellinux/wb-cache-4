The effect of carbamazepine was not significant. Of the antidepressants, amitriptyline may reduce depression, but mianserin, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and phenelzine sulfate showed no effect. Omega-3 fatty acid may ameliorate suicidality and improve depression.

40|$|Objective Adjunctive {{anticonvulsant}} medications {{may benefit}} some individuals with schizophrenia, however data on adjunct anticonvulsants in {{older adults with}} schizophrenia is limited. This prospective, 12 -week open label study evaluated adjunct extended-release <b>valproate</b> <b>semisodium</b> (divalproex) in 20 older adults with schizophrenia. Methods The study was conducted at an academic psychiatry clinic in the mid-western United States. Participants were self-referred from posted advertisements or referred by clinic practitioners. Extended-release <b>valproate</b> <b>semisodium</b> was added onto antipsychotic treatment. Individuals with active substance use disorders or active significant medical comorbidity were excluded. Primary outcome measures included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and Global Assessment Scale (GAS). Tolerability was evaluated via patient self-reported side effects, change from baseline in body weight and change on abnormal movement scales. Results Patients (mean age 61 years, range 49. 8 – 79. 2 years) had significant reductions in psychosis scores {{as measured by the}} Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) p [*]<[*] 0. 01, as well as in global functioning as measured by the Global Assessment Scale (GAS) p [*]<[*] 0. 01 and depression as measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) p [*]<[*] 0. 05. Mean dose of extended-release <b>valproate</b> <b>semisodium</b> was 587. 50 [*]mg/day SD[*]±[*] 247. 02. Extended-release <b>valproate</b> <b>semisodium</b> was well tolerated in this older adult population. The primary adverse effect was sedation, which appeared to be relatively dose and titration-speed dependent. Weight change was not significant. Conclusion While extended-release <b>valproate</b> <b>semisodium</b> appears efficacious and well tolerated in older adults with schizophrenia, data from larger, controlled trials is needed.

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} the clinical and cost-effectiveness of quetiapine, olanzapine and <b>valproate</b> <b>semisodium</b> {{in the treatment}} of mania associated with bipolar disorder. Data sources: Electronic databases; industry submissions made to the National Institute for Clinical Excellence. Review methods: Randomised trials and economic evaluations that evaluated the effectiveness of quetiapine, olanzapine or <b>valproate</b> <b>semisodium</b> {{in the treatment of}} mania associated with bipolar disorder were selected for inclusion. Data were extracted by one reviewer into a Microsoft Access database and checked for quality and accuracy by a second. The quality of the cost-effectiveness studies was assessed using a checklist updated from that developed by Drummond and colleagues. Relative risk and mean difference data were presented as Forest plots but only pooled where this made sense clinically and statistically. Studies were grouped by drug and, within each drug, by comparator used. chi(2) tests of heterogeneity were performed for the outcomes if pooling was indicated. A probabilistic model was developed to estimate costs {{from the perspective of the}} NHS, and health outcomes in terms of response rate, based on an improvement of at least 50 % in a patient's baseline manic symptoms derived from an interview-based mania assessment scale. The model evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the alternative drugs when used as part of treatment for the acute manic episode only. Results: Eighteen randomised trials met the inclusion criteria. Aspects of three of the quetiapine studies were commercial-in-confidence. The quality of the included trials was limited and overall, key methodological criteria were not met in most trials. Quetiapine, olanzapine and <b>valproate</b> <b>semisodium</b> appear superior to placebo in reducing manic symptoms, but may cause side-effects. There appears to be little difference between these treatments and lithium in terms of effectiveness, but quetiapine is associated with somnolence and weight gain, whereas lithium is associated with tremor. Olanzapine as adjunct therapy to mood stabilisers may be more effective than placebo in reducing mania and improving global health, but it is associated with more dry mouth, somnolence, weight gain, increased appetite, tremor and speech disorder. There was little difference between these treatments and haloperidol in reducing mania, but haloperidol was associated with more extrapyramidal side-effects and negative implications for health-related quality of life. Intramuscular olanzapine and lorazepam were equally effective and safe in one very short (24 hour) trial. <b>Valproate</b> <b>semisodium</b> and carbamazepine were equally effective and safe in one small trial in children. Olanzapine may be more effective than <b>valproate</b> <b>semisodium</b> in reducing mania, but was associated with more dry mouth, increased appetite, oedema, somnolence, speech disorder, Parkinson-like symptoms and weight gain. <b>Valproate</b> <b>semisodium</b> was associated with more nausea than olanzapine. The results from the base-case analysis demonstrate that choice of optimal strategy is dependent on the maximum that the health service is prepared to pay per additional responder. For a figure of less than pound 7179 per additional responder, haloperidol is the optimal decision; for a spend in excess of this, it would be olanzapine. Under the most favourable scenario in relation to the costs of responders and non-responders beyond the 3 -week period considered in the base-case analysis, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of olanzapine is reduced to pound 1236. Conclusions: In comparison with placebo, quetiapine, olanzapine and <b>valproate</b> <b>semisodium</b> appear superior in reducing manic symptoms, but all drugs are associated with adverse events. In comparison with lithium, no significant differences were found between the three drugs in terms of effectiveness, and all were associated with adverse events. Several limitations of the cost-effectiveness analysis exist, which inevitably means that the results should be treated with some caution. There remains a need for well-conducted, randomised, double-blind head-to-head comparisons of drugs used in the treatment of mania associated with bipolar disorder and their cost-effectiveness. Participant demographic, diagnostic characteristics, the treatment of mania in children, the use of adjunctive therapy and long-term safety issues in the elderly population, and acute and long-term treatment are also subjects for further study.

40|$|Background:? Bipolar {{disorder}} (BD) is {{a leading}} cause of disability. Systematic reviews of randomized trials for the treatment of the maintenance phase of BD are lacking. Objectives:? To determine the efficacy and tolerability of mood stabilizers and antipsychotics in the maintenance treatment of BD. Methods:? We systematically reviewed randomized controlled trials of licensed medications for the treatment of any phase of BD. We included randomized controlled trials comparing a medication to placebo or another medication. Comprehensive searches of electronic databases were conducted to March 2005. Outcomes investigated were relapse due to mania, depression or any mood episode, and withdrawal due to any reason or due to an adverse event. Data were combined through meta-analysis. Results:? Fourteen studies (n = 2, 526) met the inclusion criteria. Lithium, lamotrigine, olanzapine and <b>valproate</b> <b>semisodium</b> each demonstrated evidence to support long-term use. Compared with placebo, all medications were more effective at preventing relapse because of any mood episode. Hazard ratios (HR) were 0. 68 [95 % confidence interval (CI) = 0. 53 – 0. 86] for lithium, 0. 68 (95 % CI = 0. 55 – 0. 85) for lamotrigine, and 0. 82 (95 % CI = 0. 57 – 1. 20) for valproate semisodium; for olanzapine, the risk ratio (RR) was 0. 58 (95 % CI = 0. 49 – 0. 69). Lithium and olanzapine significantly reduced manic relapses (HR = 0. 53; 95 % CI = 0. 35 – 0. 79 and RR = 0. 37; 95 % CI = 0. 24 – 0. 57, respectively). Lamotrigine and <b>valproate</b> <b>semisodium</b> significantly reduced depressive relapses (HR = 0. 65; 95 % CI = 0. 46 – 0. 91 and RR = 0. 40; 95 % CI = 0. 20 – 0. 82, respectively). Lithium significantly reduced manic relapses compared with lamotrigine (HR = 0. 56; 95 % CI = 0. 34 – 0. 92) and olanzapine significantly reduced manic relapses compared with lithium (RR = 1. 69; 95 % CI = 1. 12 – 2. 55). Withdrawal due to an adverse event was approximately twice as likely with lithium compared with <b>valproate</b> <b>semisodium</b> (RR = 1. 81; 95 % CI = 1. 08 – 3. 03) and lamotrigine (RR = 2. 20; 95 % CI = 1. 31 – 3. 70). There were few data for carbamazepine or medications given as adjunct therapy. Conclusions:? Mood stabilizers have differing profiles of efficacy and tolerability, suggesting complementary roles in long-term maintenance treatment. <br/...|$|E

40|$|Background Lithium {{carbonate}} and <b>valproate</b> <b>semisodium</b> {{are both}} recommended as monotherapy for prevention of relapse in bipolar disorder, {{but are not}} individually fully eff ective in many patients. If combination therapy with both agents is better than monotherapy, many relapses and consequent disability could be avoided. We aimed to establish whether lithium plus valproate was better than monotherapy with either drug alone for relapse prevention in bipolar I disorder. Methods 330 patients aged 16 years and older with bipolar I disorder from 41 sites in the UK, France, USA, and Italy were randomly allocated to open-label lithium monotherapy (plasma concentration 0 · 4 – 1 · 0 mmol/L, n= 110), valproate monotherapy (750 – 1250 mg, n= 110), or both agents in combination (n= 110), after an active run-in of 4 – 8 weeks on the combination. Randomisation was by computer program, and investigators and participants were informed of treatment allocation. All outcome events were considered by the trial management team, who were masked to treatment assignment. Participants were followed up for up to 24 months.

40|$|Objectives: We {{conducted}} a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials in acute bipolar mania to summarize available data on drug treatment of mania. Methods: We included trials of medications licensed in the USA or UK {{for the treatment}} of any phase of bipolar disorder. Outcomes investigated were changes in mania scores, attrition, extrapyramidal effects and weight change. Data were combined through meta-analyses. Results: We included 13 studies (involving 3, 089 subjects) and identified 2 studies for each of the following medications: carbamazepine, haloperidol, lithium, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, <b>valproate</b> <b>semisodium</b> and aripiprazole. All drugs showed significant benefit compared with placebo for reduction in mania scores. Compared with placebo, for all antipsychotics pooled, response to treatment (? 50 % reduction in Young Mania Rating Scale scores) was increased more than 1. 7 times [relative risk (RR) = 1. 74, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1. 54, 1. 96]; for all mood stabilizers pooled, response to treatment was doubled (RR 2. 01, 95 % CI = 1. 66, 2. 43). Overall withdrawals were 34 % fewer (24 – 43 %) with antipsychotics, and 26 % fewer (10 – 39 %) with mood stabilizers. However, for carbamazepine, aripiprazole and lithium an increase in risk of withdrawal could not be excluded. Small but significant increases in extrapyramidal side effects occurred with risperidone and aripiprazole. Conclusions: Antipsychotics and mood stabilizers are significantly more effective than placebo {{for the treatment of}} acute mania. Their effect sizes are similar. Small differences between effect sizes may be due to differences in the patients included in the studies or to chance. Carbamazepine and lithium may be more poorly tolerated, and antipsychotics cause more extrapyramidal side effects. <br/...|$|E

The primary outcome was initiation of new intervention for an emergent mood episode, which was compared between groups by Cox regression. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered, number ISRCTN 55261332. 59 (54 %) of 110 people in the combination therapy group, 65 (59 %) of 110 in the lithium group, and 76 (69 %) of 110 in the valproate group had a primary outcome event during follow-up. Hazard ratios for the primary outcome were 0. 59 (95 % CI 0. 42 - 0. 83, p= 0. 0023) for combination therapy versus valproate, 0. 82 (0. 58 - 1. 17, p= 0. 27) for combination therapy versus lithium, and 0. 71 (0. 51 - 1. 00, p= 0. 0472) for lithium versus valproate. 16 participants had serious adverse events after randomisation: seven receiving valproate monotherapy (three deaths); five lithium monotherapy (two deaths); and four combination therapy (one death). For people with bipolar I disorder, for whom long-term therapy is clinically indicated, both combination therapy with lithium plus valproate and lithium monotherapy {{are more likely to}} prevent relapse than is valproate monotherapy. This benefit seems to be irrespective of baseline severity of illness and is maintained for up to 2 years. BALANCE could neither reliably confirm nor refute a benefit of combination therapy compared with lithium monotherapy. Stanley Medical Research Institute; Sanofi-Aventis...|$|E
