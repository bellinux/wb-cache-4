50|$|Recently Veitch {{wrote about}} the {{development}} of the <b>Veitch</b> <b>diagram</b> and its interpretation, These comments are summarized here.|$|E
5000|$|Veitch {{improved}} {{the notion of}} Venn diagrams by converting the circles to abutting squares, and Karnaugh simplified the <b>Veitch</b> <b>diagram</b> by converting the minterms, written in their literal-form (e.g. ~abc~d) into numbers. The method proceeds as follows: ...|$|E
50|$|This {{numbering}} {{comes about}} because as one {{moves down the}} table from row to row only one variable at a time changes its value. Gray code is derived from this notion. This notion can be extended to three and four-dimensional hypercubes called Hasse diagrams where each corner's variables change only {{one at a time}} as one moves {{around the edges of the}} cube. Hasse diagrams (hypercubes) flattened into two dimensions are either <b>Veitch</b> <b>diagrams</b> or Karnaugh maps (these are virtually the same thing).|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Both the <b>Veitch</b> and Karnaugh <b>diagrams</b> {{show all}} the minterms, but the Veitch is not {{particularly}} useful for reduction of formulas. Observe the strong resemblance between the Venn and Karnaugh diagrams; the colors and the variables x, y, and z are per Venn's example.|$|R
5000|$|The primary {{difference}} between the Veitch and Karnaugh versions is that the <b>Veitch</b> <b>diagram</b> presents the data in the binary sequence used in the truth table while the Karnaugh map interchanges {{the third and fourth}} rows and the third and fourth columns.|$|E
50|$|The general digital {{computer}} community chose the Karnaugh approach. Veitch accepted this decision, {{even though in}} early 1952, before his presentation, he had almost changed to that approach but decided against it. A few years later several textbooks described the K-map, {{a few of them}} designating it a <b>Veitch</b> <b>diagram.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The four {{variable}} <b>Veitch</b> <b>diagram</b> {{would then}} be four 2x2 sets in a larger square with a small space between each pair of sets. Thus a horizontal pair in the top left set can combine with a matching pair in the bottom left set or with the top right set or possibly with all four sets to make an eight cell group.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: [...] A {{truth table}} will contain 2n rows, where n {{is the number}} of {{variables}} (e.g. three variables [...] "p", [...] "d", [...] "c" [...] produce 23 rows). Each row represents a minterm. Each minterm {{can be found on the}} Hasse diagram, on the <b>Veitch</b> <b>diagram,</b> and on the Karnaugh map. (The evaluations of [...] "p" [...] shown in the truth table are not shown in the Hasse, Veitch and Karnaugh diagrams; these are shown in the Karnaugh map of the following section.) ...|$|E
40|$|In this journal, {{we present}} a method called “AI Game Playing Approach for Fast Processor Allocation in Hypercube Systems using <b>Veitch</b> <b>diagram</b> (AIPA) ” which {{achieves}} a fast and complete subcube recognition with a complexity that is far {{less than that of}} Gray Code (GC), Buddy, Modified Buddy, Modified Gray Code, Free List, Heuristic Processor Allocation (HPA), Tree Collapsing (TC) and other existing allocation policies. The crux of the strategy is to identify a free subcube that can fit the <b>Veitch</b> <b>diagram</b> (also called as the Karnaugh map or K-map). The cells in the <b>Veitch</b> <b>diagram</b> attribute the processors. An AI Game playing approach is applied to ensure optimality along with a graph coloring approach with a resultant penalty factor computation, for effective implementation of the strategy. The algorithm deals with cubic as well as non-cubic allocation and is not only statically optimal but also optimal in a dynamic environment. Extensive performance analysis has been carried out with outcomes discussed comparatively with other allocation strategies. It is shown that our approach supersedes many others in terms of allocation and deallocation costs. The algorithm is also efficient in memory utilization and minimization of system fragmentation. Moreover, the simulation results illustrate that the AIP...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1965 A {{systematic}} and rigorous derivation of the Boolean functions {{that represent the}} three operations of the ring of integers in the 1 - 2 - 4 - 5 code is developed from their corresponding tables. The same is done for numerical complementation of a number. The equations of the latter are combined with those for addition to illustrate a representative calculating section of a practical arithmetic unit. The addition equations are also combined with the subtraction equations to form a so-called adder-subtractor which is shown to be faster in operation than a corresponding so-called adder-complementor that uses numerical complementation for subtraction. The amount of physical devices for such a unit, judged from the equations, {{turns out to be}} significantly less than twice the amount required for just an adder. For the adder-subtractor Boolean functions to determine the eventual sign of a sum or of a difference of two integers of arbitrary signs are developed as well. The equations of the multiplier represent a scheme of multiplication suggested in "Synthesis of Electronic Computing and Control Circuits" (The Annals of the Computation Laboratory of Harvard University, v. 27, p. 198). When compared to those of the adder they indicate that the amount of physical devices that is required to mechanize them is comparable to that required by the adder. In reality these quantities depend on the number of digits these units are designed to process simultaneously. Simplifications of some of the derived equations are carried out by the <b>Veitch</b> <b>diagram</b> for six independent Boolean variables, by Samson and Mills' or Ouine's consensus and prime implicant scheme and by, what shall be called for the lack of an existing term, a judicious observation method...|$|E
