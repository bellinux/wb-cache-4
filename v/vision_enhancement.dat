40|$|Abstract—Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) such as {{a forward}} {{obstacle}} collision warning system (FOCWS) and a night <b>vision</b> <b>enhancement</b> system (NVES) aim to decrease driver’s mental workload and enhance vehicle safety by provision of useful information to support driver’s perception process and judgment process. On the other hand, the risk homeostasis theory (RHT) cautions that an enhanced safety and a reduced risk would cause a risk compensation behavior such as increasing the vehicle velocity. Therefore, the present paper performed the driving simulator experiments to discuss dependence on the NVES and emergence of the risk compensation behavior. Moreover, we verified the side-effects of spontaneous behavioral adaptation derived from {{the presentation of the}} fuel-consumption meter on the risk compensation behavior.

30|$|The natural visual {{world is}} complex, varying in {{presentation}} over innumerable {{factors such as}} sunlight, shading, reflectance, and composition. Given this complexity, our human visual system is not always equipped to efficiently interpret all aspects of our surroundings. For example, identifying features of a scene at night may be extremely difficult. But, during the day, one may see so many features of the same scene that simple tasks become hard to accomplish. To combat such limitations in real-world applications, multispectral imagery is utilized to enhance particular aspects of the environment such as with near-infrared (i.e., night vision) and long-wave infrared (i.e., thermal, heat-intensifying) spectral bands. These types of visual enhancements are particularly important in applications of critical decision making, such as in military and law enforcement fields. Determining the most appropriate and effective imagery in aiding human vision, however, can be tricky, especially given that an image taken in one individual spectral band can distort important information otherwise captured in another spectral band. To take advantage of multiple <b>vision</b> <b>enhancements,</b> researchers have employed image fusion, a systematic combining of multispectral imagery. With such a variety of image enhancements all aiming to improve human vision, {{it is important to}} understand if and how the human visual system takes advantage of multispectral and fusion techniques. This requires testing of the impacts on the visual system at its most basic level to understand how efficiently information is processed over changes to image presentation. Our current paper addresses these critical research questions.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{the last}} years, virtual reality {{technology}} {{has experienced a}} boost in affordability, and an increasingly number of applications have emerged proposing new immersive 360 degrees visual content. To make this content accessible for low vision people, one should adopt the same strategies as in traditional displays, i. e., use dedicated image enhancement methods to facilitate their interpretation. This work introduces a virtual reality application for mobile devices that implements real-time content enhancement. It is implemented as a visual search task {{in a set of}} static 360 degrees environments: the immersed user can manipulate the parameters of the enhancement algorithm in a intuitive way, using an external controller. In particular, we focus on the transform proposed by Peli et al (IOVS, 1991), which is based on an adaptive filter that controls the local contrast {{as a function of the}} local mean luminance of an image. Such a transform has been shown to improve recognition tasks in patients with moderate visual loss, central scotoma or cataracts. Our application is, to our knowledge, the first attempt to evaluate the impact of this image enhancement in an immersive virtual reality environment. In particular, our system allows the real time tuning of the transform, and provides all the quantitative data to analyse a posteriori users’ behavior and how parameters may impact their performance. Designed as a game, it is perceived as more enjoyable than traditional ophthalmologic experiments. More generally, this application could be a way for low vision people to adjust <b>vision</b> <b>enhancements</b> to their needs in everyday virtual reality applications, also for entertainment purposes...|$|R

40|$|At {{night or}} in bad weather, {{the task of}} driving is very complex since the amount of visual {{information}} available is severely reduced. <b>Vision</b> <b>Enhancement</b> Systems may compensate for parts of the missing information by supplying the driver {{with a picture of}} the world where warm objects are made visible. This thesis investigates the impact of <b>Vision</b> <b>Enhancement</b> System display types on cognitive capture and driving performance. 16 subjects were recruited for a simulator study. It was hypothesised that when the contrast of a transparent display is high enough for the driver to separate the picture from the background and make out enough details to interpret it, the risk of cognitive capture is higher than when using an opaque display with the same objects visible. The subjects’ driving performance and opinions about the driving experience were also investigated. No significant differences in driving performance or level of cognitive capture was found. However, questionnaire answers indicate that this question needs to be investigated further to find out whether one display type is preferable because of better and safer driving performance or if individual differences between drivers require the possibility to choose the display type of their personal preference...|$|E

40|$|Abstract As one of {{the most}} {{fundamental}} operations in computer graphics and computer <b>vision,</b> sharpness <b>enhancement</b> can enhance an image in respect of sharpness characteristics. Unfortunately, the prevalent methods often fail to eliminate image noise, unrealistic details, or incoherent enhancement. In this paper, we propose a new sharpness enhancement approach that can boost the sharpness characteristics of an image effectively with affinity-based edge preserving. Our approach includes three gradient-domain operations: sharpness saliency representation, affinity-based gradient transformation, and gradient-domain image reconstruction. Moreover, we also propose an evaluation method based on sharpness distribution for analyzing all sharpness enhancement approaches in respect of sharpness characteristics. By evaluating the sharpness distribution and comparing the visual appearance, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our sharpness enhancement approach.
