50|$|The flyback {{converter}} is an isolated power converter. The two prevailing control schemes are <b>voltage</b> <b>mode</b> <b>control</b> and current mode control (in {{the majority of}} cases current mode control needs to be dominant for stability during operation). Both require a signal related to the output voltage. There are three common ways to generate this voltage. The first is to use an optocoupler on the secondary circuitry to send a signal to the controller. The second is to wind a separate winding on the coil and rely on the cross regulation of the design. The third consists on sampling the voltage amplitude on the primary side, during the discharge, referenced to the standing primary DC voltage.|$|E

The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss a {{modeling}} and control of stand- alone photovoltaic system using <b>voltage</b> <b>mode</b> <b>control</b> maximum power point tracking (MPPT) method. The PV module was modeled based on the parameters obtained from a commercial PV data sheet while <b>voltage</b> <b>mode</b> <b>control</b> was modeled using simulink block model. A DC-DC boost converter was chosen to step-up and regulates the input DC voltage of the PV module. The <b>voltage</b> <b>mode</b> <b>control</b> (VMC) maximum power point tracking model was simulated and compared with perturb and observe (P&O) maximum power point tracker in order to validate the performance of output results. Results showed that the <b>voltage</b> <b>mode</b> <b>control</b> maximum power point tracking model yields the similar performance as produced by the photovoltaic system controlled by perturb and observe maximum power point tracking algorithm. The simulation is made to analyze the voltage, current and power generated under the changing irradiant and temperature condition.

40|$|In digital current <b>mode</b> <b>controlled</b> DC-DC converters, {{conventional}} current sensors might not provide isolation at a minimized price, power loss and size. Therefore, a current observer {{which can be}} realized based on the digital circuit itself, is a possible substitute.

Moreover, the divergence of the observed current will cause steady state errors in the output voltage. In this paper, an optimal current observer is proposed. It achieves the highest observation accuracy by compensating for all the known parasitic parameters. By employing the optimal current observer-based predictive current controller, a buck converter is implemented.

The current and common <b>mode</b> <b>voltage</b> (CMV) <b>controls</b> are done considering a finite set of control actions. The space vector model of a seven-phase voltage source inverter produces 27 = 128 space voltage vectors, with 126 active and two zero vectors.

To control the current and the common <b>mode</b> <b>voltage,</b> specific set of space vectors are chosen that minimizes {{the magnitude of the}} CMV and makes it a dc signal and simultaneously track the reference current.

40|$|Period {{doubling}} bifurcation {{leading to}} subharmonic oscillations are undesired phenomena in switching converters. In past studies, their prediction has been mainly tackled by explicitly deriving a discrete time model and then linearizing {{it in the}} vicinity of the operating point. However, the results obtained from such an approach cannot be applied for design purpose. Alternatively, in this paper, the subharmonic oscillations in <b>voltage</b> <b>mode</b> <b>controlled</b> DC-DC buck converters are predicted by using a formal symbolic approach. This approach is based on expressing the subharmonic oscillation conditions in the frequency domain and then converting the results to generalized hypergeometric functions. The obtained expressions depend explicitly on the system parameters and the operating duty cycle making the results directly applicable for design purpose. Under certain practical conditions concerning these parameters, the hypergeometric functions can be approximated by polylogarithm and standard functions. The new approach is demonstrated using an example of voltage-mode-controlled buck converters. It is found that the stability of the converter is strongly dependent upon a polynomial function of the duty cycle. Comment: Submitted to an IEEE 06 -Feb- 2011, rejected 08 -Jun- 2011.
