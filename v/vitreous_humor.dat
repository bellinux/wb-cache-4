30|$|Patients with uveitis of {{infectious}} and non-infectious etiologies often share similar clinical {{signs and symptoms}} at presentation, representing diagnostic challenges, especially when serology is unable to establish the diagnosis [8]. Having an early definitive laboratory-proven diagnosis is very advantageous in starting timely appropriate effective treatment. So, we investigated the diagnostic utility of real-time and nested PCR samples obtained from the ocular fluid in clinically suspected infectious uveitis. We analyzed the sensitivity, specificity and, predictive values of PCR to detect the etiological agent from aqueous and <b>vitreous</b> <b>humors</b> and compared with the diagnostic hypothesis.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE. Prostaglandin (PG) D synthase {{is present}} in neural tissues and {{cerebrospinal}} fluid (/ 3 -trace). This enzyme belongs to the lipocalin family which consists of transporter proteins for lipophilic substances in the extracellular space. PGD synthase is found in retinal pigment epithelium, from where it is secreted into the interphotoreceptor matrix. The authors have undertaken the localization of this unique enzyme within the tissues and spaces of the anterior segment of the eye. METHODS. Iris, ciliary body, lens, and aqueous and <b>vitreous</b> <b>humors</b> were collected from adult rats and mice. PGD synthase activity was determined, and the protein was quantified by Western blot analysis and localized immunohistochemically. Finally, in situ hybridization was performed to localize PGD synthase mRNA...|$|R

25|$|AAV {{is capable}} of transducing {{multiple}} cell types within the retina. AAV serotype 2, the most well-studied type of AAV, is commonly administered {{in one of two}} routes: intravitreal or subretinal. Using the intravitreal route, AAV is injected in the <b>vitreous</b> <b>humor</b> of the eye. Using the subretinal route, AAV is injected underneath the retina, taking advantage of the potential space between the photoreceptors and RPE layer, in a short surgical procedure. Although this is more invasive than the intravitreal route, the fluid is absorbed by the RPE and the retina flattens in less than 14 hours without complications. Intravitreal AAV targets retinal ganglion cells and a few Muller glial cells. Subretinal AAV efficiently targets photoreceptors and RPE cells.|$|E

25|$|The optical {{component}} {{is concerned with}} producing a reduced inverted image on the retina. The eye's optical system consists of not only two but four surfaces—two on the cornea, two on the lens. Rays are refracted toward the midline. Distant rays, due to their parallel nature, converge to a point on the retina. The cornea admits light at the greatest angle. The aqueous and <b>vitreous</b> <b>humors</b> both have a refractive index of 1.336-1.339, whereas the cornea has a refractive index of 1.376. Because the change in refractive index between cornea and aqueous humor is relatively small compared to the change at the air–cornea interface, it has a negligible refractive effect, typically -6 dioptres. The cornea {{is considered to be}} a positive meniscus lens.|$|R
40|$|Background: Manganese-enhanced {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MEMRI) for visual pathway imaging via topical administration requires further research. This study investigated the permeability of the corneal epithelium and corneal toxicity after topical administration of Mn 2 + to understand the applicability of MEMRI. Methods: Forty New Zealand rabbits were divided into 0. 05 mol/L, 0. 10 mol/L, and 0. 20 mol/L {{groups as well as}} a control group (n = 10 in each group). Each group was further subdivided into epithelium-removed and epithelium-intact subgroups (n = 5 in each subgroup). Rabbits were given 8 drops of MnCl 2 in 5 min intervals. The Mn 2 + concentrations in the aqueous and <b>vitreous</b> <b>humors</b> were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry at different time points. MEMRI scanning was carried out to image the visual pathway after 24 h. The corneal toxicity of Mn 2 + was evaluated with corneal imaging and pathology slices. Results: Between the aqueous and <b>vitreous</b> <b>humors,</b> there was a 10 h lag for the peak Mn 2 + concentration times. The intraocular Mn 2 + concentration increased with the concentration gradients of Mn 2 + and was higher in the epithelium-removed subgroup than that in the epithelium-intact subgroup. The enhancement of the visual pathway was achieved in the 0. 10 mol/L and 0. 20 mol/L epithelium-removed subgroups. The corresponding peak concentrations of Mn 2 + were 5087 ± 666 ng/ml, 22920 ± 1188 ng/ml in the aqueous humor and 884 ± 78 ng/ml, 2556 ± 492 ng/ml in the vitreous body, respectively. Corneal injury was evident in the epithelium-removed and 0. 20 mol/L epithelium-intact subgroups. Conclusions: The corneal epithelium is a barrier to Mn 2 +, and the iris and lens septum might be another intraocular barrier to the permeation of Mn 2 +. An elevated Mn 2 + concentration contributes to the increased permeation of Mn 2 +, higher MEMRI signal, and corneal toxicity. The enhancement of the visual pathway requires an effective Mn 2 + concentration in the vitreous body...|$|R

2500|$|Nearly {{every person}} who {{undergoes}} a vitrectomy—without ever having had cataract surgery—will experience progression of nuclear sclerosis after the operation. This may be because the native <b>vitreous</b> <b>humor</b> is different to the solutions used to replace the vitreous (vitreous substitutes), such as BSS Plus. This may also be because the native vitreous humour contains ascorbic acid which helps neutralize oxidative damage to the lens and because traditional vitreous substitutes do not contain ascorbic acid.

40|$|A 45 -year-old man, {{a case of}} {{acquired}} immunodeficiency syndrome, {{received a}} {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} at the outpatient service for 4 years without regular follow-up. He experienced progressively blurred vision for 6 months and a cutaneous zoster on his back 3 months ago. He was diagnosed with progressive outer retinal necrosis by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism using an aqueous humor sample, which revealed an existence of varicella zoster virus. He was given a combination of systemic, intravitreal antiviral and a highly active antiretroviral therapy. Occlusive vasculitis, an unusual finding for progressive outer retinal necrosis, developed in both eyes 1 week after the secondary intravitreal injection. Unfortunately, his vision deteriorated to no light perception in both eyes within 2 weeks. Progressive outer retinal necrosis is characterized clinically as showing minimal or no inflammation in the aqueous and <b>vitreous</b> <b>humors,</b> absence of retinal vasculitis, and patches of yellowish spots located deep in the retina.

40|$|Abstract. Despite the {{interest}} in developing improved formulas for intraocular lens power calculation, there are several sources of uncertainty that may well {{give rise to a}} significant residual refractive error. Those concerning the estimation of the corneal power are reviewed. In addition, we explore the possibility of introducing changes in some unconventional parameters of the eye to compensate for defocus and illustrate their effectiveness in two cases: a natural eye and an eye that has undergone previous surgical actions (anterior refractive surgery and cataract surgery with an intraocular lens implant). The results show that changes in the refractive index, thickness, or posterior radius of the cornea have relatively little effect on the overall refractive error. However, small changes in the refractive indexes of the aqueous or the <b>vitreous</b> <b>humors</b> are highly effective, much more so than a similar amount of change in the anterior curvature of the cornea. This fact opens new and attractive possibilities to compensate for refractive error through the introduction of changes in degrees of freedom so fa...|$|R

40|$|The lens is an {{avascular}} tissue, {{separated from}} the aqueous and <b>vitreous</b> <b>humors</b> by its own extracellular matrix, the lens capsule. Here we demonstrate that the lens capsule {{is a source of}} essential survival factors for lens epithelial cells. Primary and immortalized lens epithelial cells survive in low levels of serum and are resistant to staurosporine-induced apoptosis when they remain in contact with the lens capsule. Physical contact with the capsule is required for maximal resistance to stress. The lens capsule is also a source of soluble factors including fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF- 2) and perlecan, an extracellular matrix component that enhances FGF- 2 activity. Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP- 2) inhibition as well as MMP- 2 pretreatment of lens capsules greatly reduced the protective effect of the lens capsule, although this could be largely reversed by the addition of either conditioned medium or recombinant FGF- 2. These data suggest that FGF- 2 release from the lens capsule by MMP- 2 is essential to lens epithelial cell viability and survival...|$|R
40|$|Role of {{vascular}} endothelial {{growth factor}} in the regulation of angiogenesis. Compelling evidence indicates that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a fundamental regulator of normal and abnormal angiogenesis. The loss of a single VEGF allele results in defective vascularization and early embryonic lethality. VEGF plays also {{a critical role in}} kidney development, and its inactivation during early postnatal life results in the suppression of glomerular development and kidney failure. Recent evidence indicates that VEGF is also essential for angiogenesis in the female reproductive tract and for morphogenesis of the epiphyseal growth plate and endochondral bone formation. Substantial experimental evidence also implicates VEGF in pathological angiogenesis. Anti-VEGF monoclonal antibodies or other VEGF inhibitors block the growth of several human tumor cell lines in nude mice. Furthermore, the concentrations of VEGF are elevated in the aqueous and <b>vitreous</b> <b>humors</b> of patients with proliferative retinopathies such as the diabetic retinopathy. In addition, VEGF-induced angiogenesis results in a therapeutic benefit in several animal models of myocardial or limb ischemia. Currently, both therapeutic angiogenesis using recombinant VEGF or VEGF gene transfer and inhibition of VEGF-mediated pathological angiogenesis are being pursued clinically...|$|R
40|$|We {{determined}} the ocular kinetics of pefloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, when {{administered by the}} intramuscular route to albino and pigmented rabbits. In serum of albino rabbits, the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) for the experimental period was 31. 4 +/- 1. 07 micrograms. h/ml (mean +/- standard deviation); the AUCs in the aqueous and <b>vitreous</b> <b>humors</b> were high (10. 5 +/- 1. 90 and 12. 4 +/- 3. 79 micrograms. h/ml, respectively). Pefloxacin {{was found in the}} avascular ocular tissues (30. 15 +/- 3. 79 micrograms. h/ml in the cornea and 6. 98 +/- 1. 06 micrograms. h/ml in the lens). In the vascularized tissues, the penetration ratio, defined as tissue AUC/serum AUC, was more than 1. The good intraocular diffusion of pefloxacin might be related to its low molecular weight and to its strong lipophilicity and could explain its clinical efficacy in the treatment of endophthalmitis. In pigmented rabbits, pefloxacin levels were high in the iris (1525 +/- 328 micrograms. h/ml, versus 40. 2 +/- 5. 08 micrograms. h/ml in albino rabbits) and chorioretina (2600 +/- 422 micrograms. h/ml, versus 48. 3 +/- 7. 52 micrograms. h/ml in albino rabbits), suggesting that it binds to the pigmentary apparatus...|$|R

A total of 31 cattle, 18 dogs and 22 cats were selected from routine elective euthanasia submissions to a diagnostic laboratory. For all cases, a biochemical profile, including determinations for electrolytes, glucose, urea, creatinine, enzymes, cholesterol, bilirubin, protein and osmolality was performed on antemortem serum, and postmortem aqueous and <b>vitreous</b> <b>humors</b> at 0 and 24 h incubation periods. The association between serum and postmortem eyefluid chemistry values was examined using simple linear regression.

We concluded that an accurate estimate of antemortem serum urea or creatinine {{can be made from}} the analysis of aqueous or vitreous fluid at necropsy. An estimation of antemortem serum electrolytes (including calcium in cattle) cannot be made {{with a high degree of}} accuracy due to the amount of variability in the relationship between serum and eyefluid electrolyte values.

40|$|There is a {{good deal}} of {{evidence}} that the lens generates an internal micro circulatory system, which brings metabolites, like glucose, and antioxidants, like ascorbate, into the lens along the extracellular spaces between cells. Calcium also ought to be carried into the lens by this system. If so, the only path for Ca 2 + {{to get out of the}} lens is to move down its electrochemical gradient into fiber cells, and then move by electrodiffusion from cell to cell through gap junctions to surface cells, where Ca-ATPase activity and Na/Ca exchange can transport it back into the aqueous or <b>vitreous</b> <b>humors.</b> The purpose of the present study was to test this calcium circulation hypothesis by studying calcium homeostasis in connexin (Cx 46) knockout and (Cx 46 for Cx 50) knockin mouse lenses, which have different degrees of gap junction coupling. To measure intracellular calcium, FURA 2 was injected into fiber cells, and the gradient in calcium concentration from center to surface was mapped in each type of lens. In wild-type lenses the coupling conductance of the mature fibers was ∼ 0. 5 S/cm 2 of cell to cell contact, and the best fit to the calcium concentration data varied from 700 nM in the center to 300 nM at the surface. In the knockin lenses, the coupling conductance was ∼ 1. 0 S/cm 2 and calcium varied from ∼ 500 nM at the center to 300 nM at the surface. Thus, when the coupling conductance doubled, the concentration gradient halved, as predicted by the model. In knockout lenses, the coupling conductance was zero, hence the efflux path was knocked out and calcium accumulated to ∼ 2 μM in central fibers. Knockout lenses also had a dense central cataract that extended from the center to about half the radius. Others have previously shown that this cataract involves activation of a calcium-dependent protease, Lp 82. We can now expand on this finding to provide a hypothesis on each step that leads to cataract formation: knockout of Cx 46 causes loss of coupling of mature fiber cells; the efflux path for calcium is therefore blocked; calcium accumulates in the central cells; at concentrations above ∼ 1 μM (from the center to about half way out of a 3 -wk-old lens) Lp 82 is activated; Lp 82 cleaves cytoplasmic proteins (crystallins) in central cells; and the cleaved proteins aggregate and scatter light...|$|R
