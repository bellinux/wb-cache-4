40|$|The {{microbial}} {{content of}} dust collected from {{intake and exhaust}} air filters in six Norwegian nurseries was determined using 16 S rRNA pyrosequencing and plate count analyses. The concentration of endotoxins was also estimated. About 96 % of the sequences were classified as Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Cyanobacteria. At the genus level, about 30 % of sequences from the exhaust filter were classified as bacteria of probable human origin, such as Streptococcus and Corynebacterium species. These were close to absent in intake dust samples (< 1 %). This suggests that occupancy shapes the indoor microbiota, creating an environment relatively rich in genera of potential health significance. There were significantly greater counts of culturable bacteria and fungi in exhaust samples, indicating that passage of air through the nursery causes deterioration in the general air quality. Although there was more endotoxin in exhaust dust, the endotoxin levels per colony forming unit were similar in both samples. This study explores, for the first time, the bacterial composition of <b>ventilation</b> <b>filter</b> dust in Norwegian nurseries, and is important as it reveals what types of microorganisms nursery users are exposed to.

40|$|The {{potential}} for reactions among indoor pollutants to generate reactive and highly irritating products {{is a reason}} to maintain adequate ventilation rates and clean <b>ventilation</b> <b>filters.</b> Terpenoid (from recirculated air, a scenario common in the tropics) captured by <b>ventilation</b> <b>filters</b> can react relatively quickly with ozone which may lead to downstream air supply that contain oxidized terpenoid {{and this may be}} perceived to be less acceptable than outdoor air. The chemical composition (water solubility and chemical reactivity) of these particles strongly governs their toxicity. The composition determines either how the respiratory tract reacts or how the body responds. There are few studies examining the impact of ventilation rate and <b>ventilation</b> <b>filters</b> on indoor chemistry. Studies documenting the effect of <b>filters,</b> <b>ventilation</b> and recirculation rate on ozone initiated chemistry in buildings utilizing recirculation of conditioned air are lacking. Thus the need to stimulate research in this area to better understand the effect, recirculation of conditioned air phenomenon could have on indoor air quality serves as the motive for the quest for tropical research. The paper demonstrates that reaction between reactive gases to generate highly irritating products may even be more important in mechanical ventilation system that utilizes recirculation of conditioned air.

Filters were tested under both static and dynamic conditions. Under static conditions, the unbaked filter outgassed VOC (0. 50 ± 0. 18 μg) {{more than twice}} as much as the baked filter (0. 23 ± 0. 15 μg). 2 -Propanol and nonanal were the components outgassed from both baked and unbaked filters and 4 -piperidinol, 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethyl- was determined to be the main contaminant outgassed from the unbaked filters. Series of tunnel experiments were conducted by passing highly purified dry air through the filters and taking air samples upstream and downstream the filter. Under dynamic test conditions, the baked filter was not significantly distinguishable from the background with a downstream total VOC concentration increase only by 35. 3 %, which was almost 9 times lower than that of the unbaked filter (294 %). 3 -hydroxy- 4, 6 -di-t-butyl- 2 H-pyran- 2 -one was the main VOC outgassed from the unbaked filter. In addition, a general trend of decreasing VOC outgassing with time from baked and unbaked filters was observed in both static and dynamic tests. It also suggested that baked filter behaved like a sink for certain VOC and unbaked filters from different batches may outgas different VOC.

Many {{studies show that}} an ionizer operated upstream of a <b>ventilation</b> air <b>filter</b> could enhance the particle collection efficiency of the filter, without affecting the pressure drop. However, most of these studies are based on one single fiber material and does not develop any comparison among different <b>ventilation</b> <b>filters.</b> This study investigates {{the influence of the}} fiber material and filter class on the enhanced efficiency. The influence of ion concentration is also considered. The experiments were conducted in a full-scale filter test rig and a chamber with 100 % air re-circulation. Seven <b>ventilation</b> <b>filters</b> of class F 5 -F 9 (MERV 11 - 15), made of three types of fiber materials were tested in the filter test rig. A Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS) was utilized to count ultrafine and {{submicron particles}} in the upstream and downstream air flow. In the chamber test, a charged synthetic filter of class G 4 (MERV 8) was mounted in the air re-circulation system. A P-TRAK Ultrafine Particle Counter, a CI- 500 optical particle counter and a Dust-TRAK Aerosol Monitor were used to measure ultrafine and submicron particles. The results show, under the given experimental conditions, that ionization could substantially improve the filtration efficiency. For example, assisted by the ionizer, the coarse G 4 (MERV 8) filter showed a filtration efficiency that increased by about 30 to 40 %-units for submicron particles. For the same ion concentration, the enhanced efficiency of charged synthetic filters is higher than that of glass fiber filters, especially in the ultrafine particle size fraction. Similarly, with the same ion concentration, the charged synthetic filters of higher class showed higher enhanced efficiencies than the charged synthetic filters of lower class.

The utilization of in-duct <b>ventilation</b> <b>filters</b> is a promising technology in reducing the level of pollutants from indoor air.

The major goal {{of this study is}} to develop an experimental method to measure the performance and service-life of full-scale in-duct Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) <b>ventilation</b> <b>filters</b> for the removal of multiple Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). In this study, two sets of experiments were carried out. In the first set, the removal performance of four full-scale GAC filters with various media bed depths was measured for toluene removal. From obtained data, the applicability of the Wheeler-Jonas model in predicting the service life of full-scale GAC filters was studied and limitations were discussed. In the second set of experiments, a 5 cm-filter was tested with a mixture of representative VOCs consisting of toluene, p-xylene, n-hexane and 2 -butanone. The objective was to improve understanding of the behavior of full-scale GAC filters in the adsorption of multiple VOCs. The results showed the removal performance is influenced by the physical properties of VOCs. The filter showed the highest performance in removing the p-xylene followed by toluene, n-hexane and 2 -butanone. This ranking is positively correlated to the molecular weight of VOCs. VOCs competed for adsorption on the carbon surface where lighter VOCs were displaced by heavier compounds.

30|$|<b>Filter</b> <b>ventilation</b> shows {{flow rate}} dependency, {{typically}} decreasing when the flow rate through the filter increases (Lewis and Norman 1986; Mathis 1987). Puff flow rates produced by smokers {{tend to be}} higher than the 17.5  mL/s used to measure ventilation levels. For example, the US Surgeon General (Office of the Surgeon General 1988) reported a range of peak puff flow rates of 28 to 48  mL/s on the basis of data obtained from 5 studies (Gritz et al. 1983;Guillerm and Radziszewski; Nil et al. 1984, 1986; Medici et al. 1985). More recently, Hammond et al. (Hammond et al. 2006) reported a mean ‘average puff flow rate’ of 38.6  mL/s from 51 smokers of 9 – 15 -mg ISO tar yield Canadian cigarettes. As compared with the 17.5  mL/s average flow rate of the ISO smoking regime, the higher flow rates produced by smokers would reduce both the actual <b>filter</b> <b>ventilation</b> and <b>filter</b> efficiency and thereby increase the smoke yield from the cigarette. This physical phenomenon of ventilated cigarettes has been described as ‘elasticity’ by some researchers (Chaiton et al. 2005; Hammond et al. 2005).|$|R
40|$|Background : Several {{factors have}} {{potential}} {{to accommodate the}} spread and cause of malaria include environmental, physical, condition housing, and comunity behaviour. People in the working area of the Sarmi Municipal Public Health Service, Sarmi District, have high risk behavior of being exposed by malaria disease. In addition, physical condition of housings are still far below healthy standard. Slumps area and bushes around the environment under study have contributed to poor health condition. The presence of cattle cages nearby the houses have been considered to cause the vast growing malaria-bound mosquitos. Methode : This study aimed {{to find out the}} relationship between environmental conditions nearby the houses, physical conditions, housing comunity behaviors and malaria incidence in the working area of Sarmi Municipal Public Health Service, Sarmi District, Sarmi Regency, Papua Province. This observational study applied a restropective study with a case control approach, in which case group – those who suffered from malaria – were compared with control group. The case group consisted of 57 respondents, whereas the control group consisted of 57 respondents. Data were subject to univariate and bivariate analyses using a Chi-square technique. To calculate the risk factor, the study applied an odd ratio and to find out the simultaneous relationship meaning (p) between independent variables and the dependent variables the study applied a multivariate analysis. This analysis was then correlated with a logistic regression. Result : Results of the study showed the following outputs: 1) a relationship between water slumps and malaria (OR 5. 827); 2) a relationship between bushes and malaria (OR 3. 232); 3) a relationship between window <b>ventilation</b> <b>filters</b> and malaria (p value : 0. 014; OR 2. 773); and 4) a relationship between type of houses and malaria (OR 3. 714).

40|$|<b>Filter</b> <b>ventilation</b> is the {{dominant}} design feature of the modern cigarette that determines yields of tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide on smoking machine tests. The commercial use of <b>filter</b> <b>ventilation</b> was precipitated by the 1964 United States Surgeon‐General's report, further advanced by the adoption of an official Federal Trade Commission test in 1967, and still further advanced by {{the inclusion of a}} gas phase (carbon monoxide) measure in 1979. The first vented‐filter brand on the market in the United States (Carlton) in 1964 and the second major vented‐filter brand (True) in 1966 illustrate this. Ultimately, <b>filter</b> <b>ventilation</b> became a virtually required way to make very low tar cigarettes (less than 10  mg or, even more so, less than 5  mg tar). The key to the lower tar cigarette was not, in effect, the advanced selective filtration design characteristics or sophisticated tobacco selection or processing as envisioned by experts (although these techniques were and are used); the key to the very much lower tar cigarette was simply punching holes in the filter. We propose that the banning of filter vents, coupled with low maximum standard tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide yields, would contribute to making cigarettes much less palatable and foster smoking cessation or the use of clearly less hazardous nicotine delivery systems.

The flavor constituents in cigarette smoke condensate were separated by simultaneous distillation-extraction (SDE) and capillary gas chromatography (GC). The flavor constituents were identified and determined quantitatively by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and GC. The flavors studied were methylpyrazine, furaldehyde, 5 -methylfuraldehyde, benzaldehyde, 6 -methyl- 5 -hepten- 2 -one, trimethylpyrazine, 2 -acetylpyridine, phenylacetaldehyde, acetophenone, linalool, b-phenylethyl alcohol, isophorone, oxoisophorone, benzyl acetate, menthol, ethyl octanoate, b-damascenone, b-damascone, geranylacetone and b-ionone.

30|$|Cigarette smoking causes serious {{diseases}} through {{frequent and}} prolonged exposure to toxicants. Technologies {{are being developed}} to reduce smokers’ toxicant exposure, including filter adsorbents, tobacco treatments and substitutes. This study examined the effect of modifications to <b>filter</b> <b>ventilation,</b> variations in cigarette circumference and active charcoal filter length and loading, as well as combinations of these features in a reduced-toxicant prototype (RTP) cigarette, on the yields of toxicants in cigarette smoke. An air-dilution mechanism, called split-tipping, was developed in which a band of porous paper in {{the centre of the}} filter tipping functions to minimise the loss of effective <b>filter</b> <b>ventilation</b> that occurs at the high flow rates encountered during human-smoking, and to facilitate the diffusional loss of volatile toxicants. As compared with conventional <b>filter</b> <b>ventilation</b> cigarettes, split-tipping reduced tar and volatile smoke constituent emissions under high flow rate machine-smoking conditions, most notably for products with a 1 -mg ISO tar yield. Furthermore, mouth level exposure (MLE) to tar and nicotine was reduced among smokers of 1 -mg ISO tar cigarettes in comparison to smokers of cigarettes with traditional <b>filter</b> <b>ventilation.</b> For higher ISO tar level cigarettes, however, there were no significant reductions in MLE. Smaller cigarette circumferences reduced sidestream toxicant yields and modified the balance of mainstream smoke chemistry with reduced levels of aromatic amines and benzo[a]pyrene but increased yields of formaldehyde. Smaller circumference cigarettes also had lower mainstream yields of volatile toxicants. Longer cigarette filters containing increased levels of high-activity carbon (HAC) showed reduced machine-smoking yields of volatile toxicants: with up to 97 % removal for some volatile toxicants at higher HAC loadings. Split-tipping was combined with optimal filter length and cigarette circumference in an RTP cigarette that gave significantly lower mainstream (up to ~ 90 %) and sidestream (predominately 20 %– 60 %) smoke yields of numerous toxicants as compared with a commercial comparator cigarette under machine-smoking conditions. Significantly lower mainstream and sidestream smoke toxicant yields were observed for an RTP cigarette comprising several toxicant reducing technologies; these observations warrant further evaluation in clinical studies where real-world relevance can be tested using biomarkers of exposure and physiological effect.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES—The {{purpose was}} to {{determine}} <b>filter</b> <b>ventilation</b> and the nicotine content of tobacco and their contribution to machine-smoked yields of cigarettes from the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.  METHODS—Ninety-two brands of cigarettes (32  American, 23  Canadian, and 37  British brands) were purchased at retail outlets in State College, Pennsylvania, United States, Toronto, Canada, and London, United Kingdom. A FIDUS FDT <b>filter</b> <b>ventilation</b> tester measured the percentage air-dilution from filter vents. High-pressure, liquid chromatography {{was used to measure}} the nicotine content of tobacco. Regression techniques were used to examine the contributions of tobacco nicotine content and <b>filter</b> <b>ventilation</b> to machine-smoked yields of tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide (CO).  RESULTS—Ninety-four per cent of the American brands, 91 % of the Canadian brands, and 79 % of British brands were ventilated. The total nicotine content of tobacco and percent nicotine (by weight of tobacco) averaged 10. 2  mg (standard error of the mean (SEM) 0. 25, range: 7. 2  to 13. 4) and 1. 5 % (SEM 0. 03, range 1. 2  to 2) in the United States, 13. 5  mg (SEM 0. 49, range: 8. 0  to 18. 3) and 1. 8 % (SEM 0. 06, range: 1. 0  to 2. 4) in Canada, 12. 5  mg (SEM 0. 33, range: 9  to 17. 5) and 1. 7 % (SEM 0. 04, range: 1. 3  to 2. 4) in the United Kingdom. Multiple regression analyses showed that ventilation was by far the largest factor influencing machine-smoked yields of tar, nicotine, and CO.  CONCLUSION—Filter ventilation appears to be the predominant method for reducing machine-smoked yields of tar, nicotine, and CO in three countries. However, some brands contain about twice as much nicotine (total content or percent nicotine) as do others, indicating that tobacco types or blends and tobacco casings can be used to manipulate nicotine content and nicotine delivery of cigarettes.    Keywords: filter ventilation; nicotine content; cigarette...|$|R

The result is a revolution in building technology that couples the external and built environments to save energy and provide clean <b>ventilation</b> air, <b>filtered</b> to HEPA levels, to occupants 24 hours a day, 365 days a year for life. Instead of adding pollution, it is possible for buildings in future to clean-up their surrounding urban environments...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates by {{nonlinear}} constitutive equations {{the influence}} of tipping paper, cigarette paper, filter, and tobacco rod {{on the degree of}} <b>filter</b> <b>ventilation</b> and draw resistance. Starting from the laws of conservation, the path to the theory of fluid dynamics in porous media and Darcy's law is reviewed and, as an extension to Darcy's law, two different nonlinear pressure drop-flow relations are proposed. It is proven that these relations are valid constitutive equations and the partial differential equations for the stationary flow in an unlit cigarette covering anisotropic, inhomogeneous and nonlinear behaviour are derived. From these equations a system of ordinary differential equations for the one-dimensional flow in the cigarette is derived by averaging pressure and velocity over the cross section of the cigarette. By further integration, the concept of an electrical analog is reached and discussed in the light of nonlinear pressure drop-flow relations. By numerical calculations based on the system of ordinary differential equations, it is shown that {{the influence of}} nonlinearities cannot be neglected because variations in the degree of <b>filter</b> <b>ventilation</b> can reach up to 20 % of its nominal value...|$|R
40|$|Vent blocking, the {{covering}} of the <b>filter</b> <b>ventilation</b> zone on a cigarette during smoking, is a potentially {{important aspect of}} smoking behavior. Various techniques {{have been used to}} assess the incidence of vent blocking, and widely different views have been expressed on its importance. Studies relevant to filter vent blocking have been reviewed with two overall objectives: to examine critically the evidence on the occurrence of vent blocking and to assess the effects of vent blocking on the smoke yield to the smoker. The reviewed studies fall into four main categories: (1) measurements of the incidence of filter vent blocking among smokers; (2) the observed effects of vent blocking on cigarette ventilation and machine smoke yields; (3) the effect of experimentally blocking vents on human smoke yields; and (4) simultaneous determination of vent blocking and smoke yield under human smoking conditions. Direct observation indicates that only 4 % of smokers have their fingers in direct contact with the cigarette during puffing. Estimates of vent blocking incidence by lips during smoking range from 15 - 24 % (saliva-staining technique) to up to 50 % ('tar’ staining pattern technique) of smokers. For those smokers who do block the ventilation zone, a mean of 27 % of the vents are blocked, and a maximum of about 50 %. When the cigarettes are machine-smoked, the smoke yield increases in a highly non-linear manner as the blocked portion of the <b>filter</b> <b>ventilation</b> zone increases. This effect is also more pronounced at higher original <b>filter</b> <b>ventilation</b> levels. In contrast, smoking behavior monitoring techniques have shown that when the experimenter deliberately blocks the vent zone, the human smoker adjusts by taking smaller and fewer puffs. The blocked filter affects the yields of smoke components to the smoker less than it does smoking-machine measured yields. It is concluded that the incidence of vent zone blocking by fingers is quite low and relatively insignificant. The most reliable estimate for lip blocking is that up to 25 % of smokers may cover the vent zone during at least one puff and for most smokers the coverage is partial. Ventilation zone blocking as it occurs in practice has only a relatively minor effect on human smoke yields compared to other smoker behavior factors. When a human smoker inadvertently partially or completely blocks the <b>filter</b> <b>ventilation</b> zone during smoking, he/she adjusts by taking smaller and fewer puffs. Because of these changes in puffing behavior during human smoking, predictions of the effects of filter vent blocking on smoke yields based solely on smoking machine yields are deceptive...|$|R
