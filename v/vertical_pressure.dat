The higher temperatures also result in more efficient conversion to steam, and ultimately, electricity. WR-1 operated successfully for many years, and promised a significantly higher efficiency than water-cooled versions.|$|E

Now, it also happens, {{from its}} place in buildings, that the {{sectional}} roof over a narrow space {{will need to be}} considered before we come to the expanded roof over a broad one.

Three macrodetritivore species of Lake Albano (central Italy) were used: Proasellus coxalis, an isopod, and Planorbarius corneus and Bithynia tentaculata, two snails. They were stocked at the ratio of 32 : 160 : 164 individuals in each of 24 aquaria. The simplified guilds were governed by different <b>vertical</b> <b>pressures.</b> Three types of top-down (predation) pressures, viz. (i) absence of predators, (ii) high density of the predator Erpobdella octoculata, a leech, (iii) high density of Erpobdella and Gambusia affinis, a fish, and two types of bottom-up pressures, viz. high and low leaf-detritus availability, were employed. The effects of vertical forces were determined by the numerical variation in the survivors of each species and the ratio between the survivors of the three species of macrodetritivores. A quantitative index of the daily top-down force (TDF) was computed. The results showed that the three coexisting macrodetritivore species were sensitive to <b>vertical</b> <b>pressures.</b> When increasing the top-down pressure in aquaria with high detritus availability, the guild response was non-linear: (i) in absence of predators, the percentage of the survivors of the three macrodetritivore species was the highest; (ii) the presence of Erpobdella reduced the macrodetritivore abundance and (iii) the set of aquaria with coexisting Erpobdella and Gambusia significantly increased the number of survivors of the three macrodetritivore species when compared top aquaria with Erpobdella.

Methods Twenty patients (8 females, 12 males; mean age 10. 29  ±  0. 90  years) with CII/ 2 malocclusion were included in the study group, and 15 patients (5 females, 10 males; mean age 10. 56  ±  1. 06  years) with Class I malocclusion were included. The upper incisors were protruded with a utility arch (0. 016  ×  0. 022  in. blue elgiloy wire). Perioral pressure assessment was made with the Iowa Oral Pressure Instrument. Upper lip pressure, lower lip <b>pressure,</b> <b>vertical</b> lip <b>pressure,</b> left-right buccal pressures, swallowing, and maximum tongue pressures were measured. Repeated measure ANOVA was used to test the intragroup differences. Intergroup comparisons were made using two-way repeated measure ANOVA with Bonferroni correction.
