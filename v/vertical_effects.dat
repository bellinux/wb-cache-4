30|$|The {{vertical}} {{characterization of}} a reservoir (Tompang and Kelkar 1988) {{is one of}} the most important considerations in reservoir simulation. The most accurate way to consider <b>vertical</b> <b>effects</b> is to use a 3 D reservoir simulator; however, due to the computational constraints discussed above for 3 D simulation, the use of 2 D simulators is an attractive alternative. As pointed out by Hearn (1971), 2 D reservoir simulation implies uniform reservoir properties and fluid saturation throughout the reservoir thickness, an assumption that surely is not physically correct. Thus, the input data require tuning to approximate the <b>vertical</b> <b>effects</b> (Hearn 1971). Dynamic pseudofunctions such as (Jacks et al. 1973, Kyte and Berry, 1975 and Stone 1991), flux weighted and pore volume weighted could be used to upscale relative permeability; however, these methods need fine grid simulation results. History matching using and tuning relative permeability curve using genetic algorithm is another way to approximate the <b>vertical</b> <b>effects.</b> However, this approach needs many simulation runs to fine-tune the relative permeability (Fayazi et al. 2016).|$|E

METHOD: Twenty-six patients (11 boys; mean age = 8 years and 5 months) with maxillary deficiency and posterior crossbite were treated using a Hyrax appliance with an acrylic occlusal splint. Radiographs and cephalometric studies were performed before the beginning of the treatment (T 1) and after RME active time (T 2), at a mean interval of 7 months. Results were compared with normative values. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: At the end of treatment, there were no statistically significant changes, and measurements were similar to the normative values. Data showed that there were no significant effects on vertical growth, which suggests that appliances with occlusal splints may be used to correct transverse deficiencies regardless of the patient's growth pattern...|$|E

This allowed computation of the coordinates, variance and covariance matrixes, and horizontal and vertical velocities of the 36 permanent sites analyzed, together with the strain rates, and using different techniques. Interesting geodynamic phenomena are presented, including compressional, and deformational fields in the Tyrrhenian coastal sites of Calabria, extensional trends of the Ionian coastal sites, and sliding movement of the Crotone Basin. Conversely, on the northern Tyrrhenian side of the network near the Cilento Park area, the usual extensional tectonic perpendicular to the Apennine chain is observed.

40|$|Abstract — We {{investigate}} sonic cues for {{binaural sound}} localization within classrooms and present a structural {{model for the}} same. Two of the primary cues for localization, interaural time difference (ITD) and interaural level difference (ILD) created between the two ears by sounds from a particular point in space, are used. Although these cues do not lend any information about the elevation of a sound source, the torso, head, and outer ear carry out elevation dependent spectral filtering of sounds {{before they reach the}} inner ear. This effect is commonly captured in head related transfer function (HRTF) which aids in resolving the ambiguity from the ITDs and ILDs alone and helps localize sounds in free space. The proposed structural model of HRTF produces well controlled horizontal as well as <b>vertical</b> <b>effects.</b> The implemented HRTF is a signal processing model which tries to mimic the physical effects of the sounds interacting with different parts of the body. The effectiveness of the method is tested by synthesizing spatial audio, in MATLAB, for use in listening tests with human subjects and is found to yield satisfactory results in comparison with existing models...|$|E

The authors discuss the indexes available in the literature for the potential <b>vertical</b> <b>effect</b> (V), the loss due to horizontal fairness violations (H) and that due to re-rankings (R); they also introduce new indexes specifically conceived {{to take into account}} problems arising when groups of exact equals are substituted by groups of close equals.

Even looking for V maximization, we discuss a new criterion that yields a compromise between the contrasting needs of minimizing the effects of pre-tax within groups inequalities and the minimization of group average re-rankings. The criterion is then applied to evaluate the components of two decompositions: the former is the one suggested by Urban and Lambert (2005, 2008) as preferable, the latter is suggested by us on the basis of Urban and Lambert’s paving discussion. According to our simulation results, when comparing different income tax systems for a same population as well as adopting the “optimal” bandwidth, the new criterion seems to introduce lower approximation errors than the maximization of V.

40|$|Abstract INTRODUCTION: Class II, {{anterior}} open bite {{and/or a}} steep mandibular plane angle are frequently considered a contraindication {{to the use}} of surgically assisted rapid palatal expansion (SARPE). Nevertheless, few studies have investigated the maxillary and mandibular effects after SARPE on the sagittal and vertical planes, with dissimilar results and small samples of patients. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the sagittal and <b>vertical</b> <b>effects</b> after SARPE. METHODS: Twenty-one consecutive adult patients (7 males, 14 females; mean age, 25. 6 ± 6. 3 years) who required SARPE were included in this study. All patients were subjected to subtotal LeFort I osteotomy with pterygomaxillary disjunction. Lateral cephalometric radiographs were taken during the preoperative assessment (T 0) and 6 months {{after the end of the}} expansion (T 1). Cephalometric measurements were realized at T 0 and T 1 for all the patients. Independent-sample t test and analysis of variance were used. RESULTS: Statistically significant changes were observed only in upper incisor^NA (P = 0. 04). No skeletal sagittal or vertical variation was found after SARPE. CONCLUSIONS: Class II, anterior open bite and/or a steep mandibular plane angle cannot be considered an outright contraindication to its use.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the redistributive effect and progressivity {{associated with the}} current health care financing schemes in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, {{using data from the}} first Palestinian Household Health Expenditure Survey conducted in 2004. The paper goes beyond the commonly used "aggregate summary index approach" to apply a more detailed "disaggregate approach". Such an approach is borrowed from the general economic literature on taxation, and examines redistributive and <b>vertical</b> <b>effects</b> over specific parts of the income distribution, using the dominance criterion. In addition, the paper employs a bootstrap method to test for the statistical significance of the inequality measures. While both the aggregate and disaggregate approaches confirm the pro-rich and regressive character of out-of-pocket payments, the aggregate approach does not ascertain the potential progressive feature of any of the available insurance schemes. The disaggregate approach, however, significantly reveals a progressive aspect, for over half of the population, of the government health insurance scheme, and demonstrates that the regressivity of the out-of-pocket payments is most pronounced among the worst-off classes of the population. Recommendations are advanced to improve the performance of the government insurance schemes to enhance its capacity in limiting inequalities in health care financing in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.

40|$|Recently van De Van, Creedy and Lambert (2001) and Urban and Lambert (2008) have reconsidered the {{original}} Aronson, Johnson and Lambert (1994) decomposition of the redistributive effect {{in order to}} identify the optimal bandwidth that should be used in decomposing the redistributive effect when groups with close pre-tax incomes are considered. The methodology proposed by van De Van, Creedy and Lambert (2001) suggests choosing as the optimal bandwidth the one which maximizes the ratio between the potential effect V (which depends on the bandwidth) and the actual redistributive effect RE (which is invariant). Urban and Lambert (2008) discuss a set of further possible decompositions of the redistributive effect together with a decomposition of the Atkinson-Plotnick-Kakwani index into three terms. In this paper we want to throw some more light on the behavior of three of the main decompositions analyzed by Urban and Lambert (2008) in order to look for criteria to choose a bandwidth which allows the three different definitions of potential redistributive effect to be assumed as coherent as possible values and, in the meanwhile, to catch as much as possible of the potential vertical effect.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the short-and long-term treatment effects of rapid maxillary expansion (RME) on the soft tissue facial profile of subjects treated with a modified acrylic-hyrax device. The sample comprised 10 males and 10 females in the mixed dentition. Their average age was 9. 3 years +/- 10 months pre-treatment (T 1), with a narrow maxilla and posterior crossbite, treated with a modified fixed maxillary expander with an occlusal splint. Lateral cephalometric radiographs obtained at T 1, immediately post-expansion (T 2), and after retention (T 3) were used to determine possible changes in the soft tissue facial profile. The means and standard deviations for linear and angular cephalometric measurements were analysed statistically using analysis of variance and Tukey's test (alpha = 0. 05). The measurements at T 2 differed significantly from those at T 1 and T 3. However, RME did not produce any statistically significant alteration (P > 0. 05) in the soft tissue profile for any of the cephalometric landmarks evaluated when compared at T 1 and T 3. The use of a fixed expander associated with an occlusal splint did not cause significant alterations in the soft tissue facial profile at T 3.
