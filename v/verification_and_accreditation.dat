40|$|Joint Shipboard Helicopter Integration Process (JSHIP) is a Joint Test and Evaluation (JT&E) program {{sponsored}} by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD). Under the JSHDP program is a simulation effort {{referred to as the}} Dynamic Interface Modeling and Simulation System (DIMSS). The purpose of DIMSS is to develop and test the processes and mechanisms that facilitate ship-helicopter interface testing via man-in-the-loop ground-based flight simulators. Specifically, the DIMSS charter is to develop an accredited process for using a flight simulator to determine the wind-over-the-deck (WOD) launch and recovery flight envelope for the UH- 60 A ship/helicopter combination. DIMSS is a collaborative effort between the NASA Ames Research Center and OSD. OSD determines the T&E and warfighter training requirements, provides the programmatics and dynamic interface T&E experience, and conducts ship/aircraft interface tests for validating the simulation. NASA provides the research and development element, simulation facility, and simulation technical experience. This paper will highlight the benefits of the NASA/JSHIP collaboration and detail achievements of the project in terms of modeling and simulation. The Vertical Motion Simulator (VMS) at NASA Ames Research Center offers the capability to simulate a wide range of simulation cueing configurations, which include visual, aural, and body-force cueing devices. The system flexibility enables switching configurations io allow back-to-back evaluation and comparison of different levels of cueing fidelity in determining minimum training requirements. The investigation required development and integration of several major simulation system at the VMS. A new UH- 60 A BlackHawk interchangeable cab that provides an out-the-window (OTW) field-of-view (FOV) of 220 degrees in azimuth and 70 degrees in elevation was built. Modeling efforts involved integrating Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) generated data of an LHA ship airwake and integrating a real-time ship motion model developed based on a batch model from Naval Surface Warfare Center. Engineering development and integration of a three degrees-of-freedom (DOF) dynamic seat to simulate high frequency rotor-dynamics dependent motion cues for use in conjunction with the large motion system was accomplished. The development of an LHA visual model in several different levels of resolution and an aural cueing system in which three separate fidelity levels could be selected were developed. VMS also integrated a PC-based E&S simFUSION system to investigate cost effective IG alternatives. The DIMSS project consists of three phases that follow an approved Validation, <b>Verification</b> <b>and</b> <b>accreditation</b> (VV&A) process. The first phase will support the accreditation of the individual subsystems and models. The second will follow the verification and validation of the integrated subsystems and models, and will address fidelity requirements of the integrated models and subsystems. The third and final phase will allow the verification and validation of the full system integration. This VV&A process will address the utility of the simulated WOD launch and recovery envelope. Simulations supporting the first two stages have been completed and the data is currently being reviewed and analyzed...|$|E
