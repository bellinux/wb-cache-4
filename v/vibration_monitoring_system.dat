40|$|When {{designing}} vehicle <b>vibration</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>systems</b> for aerospace devices, it {{is common}} to use well-established models of vibration features to determine whether failures or defects exist. Most of the algorithms used for failure detection rely on these models to detect significant changes during a flight environment.

Research conducted at the NASA Ames Research Center has determined that a major reason for the high rates of false alarms and missed detections is the numerous sources of statistical variations that are not taken into account in the. modeling assumptions. In this paper, we address one such source of variations, namely, those caused during the design and manufacturing of rotating machinery components that make up aerospace systems.

However, despite of the innovative and scientific value of these advances, the adoption of SHM and associated technologies by industry has not occurred at the expected pace.

In {{line with}} its {{commitment}} to safe nuclear power generation, the Koeberg Nuclear Power Station (KNPS) replaced the outdated <b>vibration</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>system</b> with a modern on-line <b>vibration</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>system.</b> This will allow plant personnel to monitor components on a continuous basis which will provide faster response time in the scenario of excessive vibrations of the primary components. This study focuses on {{the analysis of the}} vibration of the primary components of the KNPS by analysing the frequency spectra of the vibration signals of the primary components and comparing these to reference signatures obtained during similar operating conditions. The condition of the vibration sensors will also be evaluated. In order to obtain {{a deeper understanding of the}} vibration behaviour and hence vibration signatures of the KNPS primary reactor components, a simplified mathematical model of the primary components is developed, based on the system of elasto-dynamic equations. The equations are solved numerically and used to simulate the KNPS <b>vibration</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>system.</b> The mechanical system is modelled. Time series are generated and Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) are calculated to simulate the new KNPS monitoring system. In the simulation mechanical degradation of the primary components as well as sensor degradation is simulated. The purpose of this study is to indicate whether mechanical degradation has occurred in the primary components of the plant and to validate the vibration signals. At the same time the study aims to lay a foundation for future monitoring and interpretation of vibration signatures by simulating the vibration and the monitoring signals. It was found that the primary components had not been affected by mechanical degradation as no deviations in resonances were detected in the frequency signatures. A small number of vibration sensors were found to have deteriorated; hence replacement / maintenance was proposed. The mechanical model and the simulation of the monitoring signals proved to be useful to understand and interpret the vibration of the KNPS primary components. Master...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Impact {{response}} due to sudden {{changes on}} the contact forces is an in-trinsic phenomenon at all stages of the bearing life. Even prior to the actual occur-rence of surface damage, short duration impacts occur {{in the case of}} insufficient lu-brication where asperities or particles interact with the surface of its mating element. As the surface condition deteriorates, the energy released by the impacts increases affecting structural modes. As soon as the system condition worsens, lower frequen-cies are excited and consequently increased vibration levels are displayed. The im-pulse response function reflects the modulation phenomena between contact forces, structural resonances and driving forces taking place in the bearing and the mechani-cal system that contains it. The characterization of the components of the impulse response becomes then a valuable tool for <b>vibration</b> <b>monitoring.</b> This article is framed within the research on development of advanced <b>vibration</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>systems,</b> for which the authors follow a systemic approach in the defini-tion of the monitoring requirements based on the function-failure analysis of the mon-itored object.
