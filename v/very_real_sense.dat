Leó Szilárd fled to London where he proposed, and in 1934 patented, the idea of a nuclear chain reaction via neutrons. The patent also introduced the term critical mass to describe the minimum amount of material required to sustain the chain reaction and its potential to cause an explosion. (British patent 630,726.) He subsequently assigned the patent to the British Admiralty so that it could be covered by the Official Secrets Act. In a <b>very</b> <b>real</b> <b>sense,</b> Szilárd was the father of the atomic bomb academically.|$|E
25|$|A {{remarkable}} tribal leader named Nurhaci (r. 1616–1626), {{starting with}} just a small tribe, rapidly gained control over all the Manchurian tribes. During the Imjin War he offered to lead his tribes {{in support of the}} Ming army. This offer was declined, but he was granted honorific Ming titles for his gesture. Recognizing the weakness in the Ming authority north of their border, he took control over all of the other unrelated tribes surrounding his homeland. In 1610 he broke relations with the Ming court; in 1618 he demanded the Ming pay tribute to him to redress the seven grievances which he documented and sent to the Ming court. This was, in a <b>very</b> <b>real</b> <b>sense,</b> a declaration of war as the Ming were not about to pay money to the Manchu.|$|E

In 1924, at Pound's request, she welcomed George Antheil into her social circle, procured artwork and books that were sent on to Dorothy and Ezra in Rapallo, and mediated in a dispute between Pound and Lewis. She was uninterested in Pound's politics and economic views and particularly disliked his later Cantos. After her husband's death, Olivia's income was sufficient to support a comfortable lifestyle. During the 1920s and 1930s she gradually increased Dorothy's income (which was also increased by various family bequests), and in the 1930s she made investments in Dorothy's name, sending the proceeds to Dorothy and Pound. In a <b>very</b> <b>real</b> <b>sense,</b> according to Harwood, Olivia Shakespear is the [...] "unsung heroine" [...] of the modernist period, {{because much of the}} money Ezra Pound generously used to support struggling writers such as T.S. Eliot and James Joyce came from her.|$|E

The KGB tried repeatedly to recruit him, but was never successful; Oppenheimer did not betray the United States. In addition, he had several persons removed from the Manhattan Project who had sympathies to the Soviet Union. Haynes, Klehr and Vassiliev also state Oppenheimer [...] "was, in fact, a concealed member of the CPUSA in the late 1930s".

Rolling Stone stated that [...] "Brick by Boring Brick" [...] was able to [...] "weave unexpected Smashing Pumpkins-style sonics into the mix." [...] The song received a positive review from Vicki Lutas of the BBC, who awarded the song 5 out of 5 stars. She said that the song is [...] "hair-raisingly BRILLIANT" [...] and said [...] "Listening to the lyrics is like entering a world where sandcastles aren't built, but buried, {{a world where the}} baddie is not the wolf, but reality... and in this world, things are dark, but they're <b>very</b> <b>real.</b> There's a <b>sense</b> of longing; longing for those fairy tales and longing for innocence, but it's coupled with a sense of realization that this will never happen." ...|$|R

2500|$|Rome's government, {{politics}} and religion {{were dominated by}} an educated, male, landowning military aristocracy. Approximately half Rome's population were slave or free non-citizens.

2500|$|Ford {{strongly}} {{felt that}} there were many positive aspects to rural life. [...] At the same time, he recognized that the promise of high wages was encouraging young people to discard the agrarian life of their parents and move to the cities. [...] The spreading of industrialization (due in part, Ford knew, to his very own factory system) was making farming less attractive and giving farmers less to do in the winter. [...] Ford developed the village industries program as a way to bring manufacturing jobs to the countryside, allowing residents to reap the economic advantages without giving up their agricultural heritage. [...] His village industries were intended to strengthen rural communities by providing jobs to unemployed and under-employed local residents, allowing farmers to work in the winter and return to farming in the summer. [...] It was also, in a <b>very</b> <b>real</b> <b>sense,</b> intended to maintain the bucolic settings and lifestyles that Ford remembered from his boyhood and idealized to some extent.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was with}} the advent of television, however, that George's {{character}} exploded into the biggest drawing card the industry had ever known. With the networks looking for cheap, effective programming to fill its time slots, pro wrestling's glorified action became a genuine hit with the viewing public, as it was the first program of any kind to draw a real profit. Consequently, it was Gorgeous George who brought the sport into the nation's living rooms, as his histrionics and melodramatic behavior made him a larger-than-life figure in American pop-culture. His first television appearance took place on November 11, 1947 (an event that was recently named among the top 100 televised acts of the 20th century by Entertainment Weekly) and he immediately became a national celebrity at the same level of Lucille Ball and Bob Hope (who personally donated hundreds of chic robes for George's collection) while changing the course of the industry forever. No longer was pro wrestling simply about the in-ring action, but George had created a new sense of theatrics and character performance that had not previously existed. Moreover, in a <b>very</b> <b>real</b> <b>sense,</b> it was Gorgeous George who single-handedly established television as a viable entertainment medium that could potentially reach millions of homes across the country. [...] It is said that George was probably responsible for selling as many television receivers as Milton Berle.|$|E

2500|$|Byrne joined Claremont {{beginning}} with The X-Men #108 (Dec. 1977). Their work together, along with inker Terry Austin, on such classic story arcs as [...] "Proteus", [...] "Dark Phoenix Saga", and [...] "Days of Future Past" [...] {{would make them}} both fan favorites. Byrne insisted that the title keep its Canadian character, Wolverine, and contributed a series of story elements to justify Wolverine's presence which eventually made the character {{among the most popular}} in Marvel's publishing history. With issue #114, Byrne began co-plotting the series as well as penciling. Claremont recounted that [...] "at that point in time John and I were, in a <b>very</b> <b>real</b> <b>sense,</b> true collaborators on the book. It was with very few exceptions, difficult, for me, anyway, to tell in the actual gestation of the book where one of us left off and the other began - because it involved one of us coming up with an idea and bouncing it off the other ..." [...] The [...] "Dark Phoenix Saga" [...] in 1980 {{is one of the most}} notable stories in the title's history. Comics writers and historians Roy Thomas and Peter Sanderson observed that [...] "'The Dark Phoenix Saga' is to Claremont and Byrne what the 'Galactus Trilogy' is to Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. It is a landmark in Marvel history, showcasing its creators' work at the height of their abilities." [...] Byrne has repeatedly compared his working relationship with Claremont to Gilbert and Sullivan, and has said that they were [...] "almost constantly at war over who the characters were." [...] Byrne created the characters Alpha Flight, Proteus, and Kitty Pryde/Shadowcat during his run on The X-Men. A new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, led by Mystique, was introduced in the [...] "Days of Future Past" [...] storyline (#141-142, Jan.-Feb. 1981) in which a time-travelling Kitty Pryde tried to avert a dystopian future caused by the Brotherhood assassinating Presidential candidate Senator Robert Kelly. Byrne plotted the story wanting to depict the Sentinels as a genuine threat to the existence of the mutant race. Byrne left The X-Men with #143 (March 1981). During his tenure on the series, The X-Men was promoted from a bimonthly to a monthly publication schedule, with a steady sales incline that continued long after Byrne left.|$|E
