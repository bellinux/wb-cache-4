40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{performance}} of a traffic responsive intersection controller which combines vehicle Global Positioning System (GPS) data and inductive loop information, to fixed-time, inductive loop, and GPS based controllers. The INRIX Global Traffic Scorecard reports that vehicles spent up to 42 % of their travel time in congested traffic in 2016. Inefficient signal timing choices by isolated intersection controllers contribute to traffic delays, causing severe negative impacts on the economy and environment. Signal timings can be improved using vehicles’ GPS information combined with vehicle flow information from inductive loops to overcome the control action deficit at isolated intersections. This proposed new signal control algorithm is beneficial for traffic engineers and governmental agencies, as optimised traffic flow can reduce fuel consumption and emissions. The proposed traffic responsive Hybrid <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Actuation</b> (HVA) algorithm uses position and heading data from vehicle status broadcasts, and inferred velocity information to determine vehicle queue lengths and detect vehicles passing through the intersection to actuate intersection signal timings. When vehicle broadcast data are unavailable, HVA uses inductive loop data. Microscopic simulations comparing HVA to fixed-time control, inductive Loop Based <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Actuation</b> (Loop-VA) and GPS Based <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Actuation</b> (GPS-VA) on four urban road networks were carried out to see how the proposed HVA algorithm performs compared to existing control strategies. The results show that HVA is an effective alternative to traditional intersection control strategies, offering delay reductions of up to 32 % over Loop-VA, for networks with 0 − 100 % connected vehicle presence...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{performance}} of signalised intersection control using vehicle GPS information compared to fixed-time and inductive loop based control. Traffic congestion forecasts estimate an increase of about 60 % in 2030. At present, poor choice of signal timings by isolated intersection controllers cause traffic delays that have enormous negative impacts on the economy and environment. Signal timings can be improved by using vehicles' GPS information to overcome the control action deficit at isolated intersections. This new signal control algorithm is beneficial for traffic engineers and governmental agencies, as traffic flow can be optimised and, hence, fuel consumption and emissions decreased. Under the open European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI) Cooperative Awareness Message (CAM) framework, a traffic responsive GPS based <b>vehicle</b> <b>actuation</b> algorithm (GPS-VA) is proposed. GPS-VA uses position and heading data from vehicle status broadcasts, and inferred velocity information to determine vehicle queue lengths and detect vehicles passing through the intersection. The gathered information is then used to actuate intersection signal timings. Microscopic simulations comparing GPS-VA to fixed-time control and inductive loop based <b>vehicle</b> <b>actuation</b> (Loop-VA) on four urban road networks were performed to see how the proposed GPS-VA algorithm performs compared to existing control strategies.

Based on <b>vehicle</b> <b>actuations</b> at the detector, the green time is extended till a pre-defined threshold gap-out occurs. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) proposed various guidelines for detec-tor layouts on low-speed and high-speed approaches.

The objective of the design is to guarantee that the vehicles in the platoon keep their desired relative position, while maintaining desirable platoon properties in terms of disturbance attenuation. To this end, a multi-layered control architecture is proposed. On the lower layer, a unidirectional CACC is employed, involving information exchange in upstream direction. On the upper layer, a coordination variable is exchanged from each vehicle towards its direct preceding vehicle, thus yielding downstream information exchange. As a result, the leading vehicle {{is aware of the}} capabilities of the following vehicles, and therefore, is able to adapt its motion, if needed. Consequently, cohesion of a heterogeneous platoon is guaranteed, even in the case of physical limitations, like engine power limits.

Simulated outcomes (i. e. average vehicle delays) generated under the enhanced strategies were compared with outcomes resulting from more “conventional VA control policies. 	Findings from this work suggest that substantial delay reduction generally occurs by exploiting VA strategies which seek to 1) facilitate {{the use of the}} clearance interval by discharging vehicles, 2) shorten the duration of the required clearance interval by only serving, to the extent possible, queued vehicles and 3) evaluate gaps in individual traffic streams.

Fixed time control shows good results in conditions {{where there is a}} little fluctuation in traffic demand, however in time-varying traffic fixed time control becomes inflexible and inefficient.

40|$|A {{decomposition}} algorithm {{has been}} developed for global reachability analysis on a space-time grid. By exploiting the upper block-triangular structure, the planning problem is decomposed into smaller subproblems, {{which is much more}} scalable than the original approach. Recent studies have proposed the use of a hot-air (Montgolfier) balloon for possible exploration of Titan and Venus because these bodies have thick haze or cloud layers that limit the science return from an orbiter, and the atmospheres would provide enough buoyancy for balloons. One of the important questions {{that needs to be addressed}} is what surface locations the balloon can reach from an initial location, and how long it would take. This is referred to as the global reachability problem, where the paths from starting locations to all possible target locations must be computed. The balloon could be driven with its own actuation, but its actuation capability is fairly limited. It would be more efficient to take advantage of the wind field and ride the wind that is much stronger than what the actuator could produce. It is possible to pose the path planning problem as a graph search problem on a directed graph by discretizing the spacetime world and the <b>vehicle</b> <b>actuation.</b> The decomposition algorithm provides reachability analysis of a time-varying graph. Because the balloon only moves in the positive direction in time, the adjacency matrix of the graph can be represented with an upper block-triangular matrix, and this upper block-triangular structure can be exploited to decompose a large graph search problem. The new approach consumes a much smaller amount of memory, which also helps speed up the overall computation when the computing resource has a limited physical memory compared to the problem size...|$|E
40|$|Bus {{priority}} {{in various forms}} has become an important application in towns and cities around the world, as Local Authorities seek to improve the efficiency and sustainability of their transport systems by promoting {{the use of public}} transport with its high passenger carrying capability. Segregating buses from general traffic, using busways, bus lanes, etc is increasingly being supplemented with priority at traffic signals, where signal timings respond to the approach of a bus to give it priority signalling through the junction. This was first trialled in UK on a significant scale in the 1980 ’s in an area of south east London containing isolated traffic signals operating under the UK’s ‘D-system’ of <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Actuation</b> (VA). There followed a period of some 20 years where equivalent priority strategies were developed, tested and implemented in the more difficult environment of Urban Traffic Control. These strategies have kept pace with the significant advances in technologies over this period, such as in detection, communications, processing and optimisation. However, this has not been the case with bus priority at isolated VA junctions, where strategies developed in London some 30 years ago still prevail – and even in large cities a significant number of signal controlled junctions operate in this way. This then suggested a research gap which has been taken up in this research – the exploration and development of new strategies for bus priority at isolated VA junctions. Taking existing strategies as the ‘base case’, their effectiveness was first explored through theoretical and mathematical analysis. This led to the first new output from this research – more comprehensive predictive equations for bus priority benefits (delay savings) than existed, covering a range of operational conditions. The limitations of the mathematical approach were identified, so research then progressed to the development of microscopic simulation modelling (VISSIM) for junction modelling and for exploring new strategies. This involved four variants of junction design and scenarios reflecting differences in levels of congestion, bus flows, signal timings, etc. New and improved strategies were then developed through modelling, including (i) re-optimising parameter values for the existing priority methods, (ii) improved bus detector locations taking advantage of new Automatic Vehicle Location technologies and (iii) new strategies for bus priority, including a ‘stronger’ strategy termed ‘always green bus’ and ‘differential priority’, where the level of priority given to a bus depended on its performance (eg regularity) at that time. Strategies were also developed to minimise the impacts on general traffic through various forms of compensation, with total person delay then being used as an evaluation criterion. The research has concluded with a series of recommendations for improved implementation of bus priority at isolated VA controlled junctions, taking advantage of the new technologies which are widely available and used within most bus fleets in the UK...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyzes two unsolved {{problems to}} fulfill {{the gap in the}} literature: (1). What is the vehicle delay and intersection capacity considering left-turn traffic at a pre-timed signal? (2). What are the mean and variance of delay to vehicles at a vehicle-actuated signal? The first part of this research evaluates the intersection performance in terms of capacity and delay at an isolated pre-timed signal intersection. Despite of a large body of literature on pre-timed signals, few work has examined the interactions be- tween left-turn and through vehicles. Usually a protected left-turn signal phase, before (leading) or after (lagging) through signal, is applied to a signalized inter- section when the traffic demand is relatively high. A common problem for leading left-turn operation is the blockage to left-turn vehicles by through traffic, particularly at an intersection with a short left-turn bay. During the peak hour, some vehicles on the through lane {{might not be able to}} depart at the end of a cycle, resulting in an increased probability of left-turn blockage. In turn, the blocked left-turn vehicles may also delay the through traffic to enter the intersection during the following cycle. Those problems may not exist for a lagging left-turn operation, since left-turn vehicles intend to spill out of the bay under heavy traffic. In this case, the through capacity is reduced, leading to an increase of total delay. All of these factors contribute to the difficulties of estimating the delay and capacity for an isolated intersection. In order to examine this missing part of study on the signalized intersection, two probabilistic models are proposed to deal with the left-turn bay blockage and queue spillback in a heuristic manner. Numerical case studies are also provided to test the proposed models. The second part of this research studies an isolated intersection with vehicle-actuated signal. Typically an advanced detector is located at a distance prior to the intersection such that an arriving vehicle triggers a green time extension in or- der to pass through without any stop. This extended time period actuated by the vehicle is called unit extension in this study. If no <b>vehicle</b> <b>actuation</b> occurs during a unit extension, the green phase would terminate in order to clear queues in other approaches. In this way, the actuated system dynamically allocates the green time among multiple approaches according to vehicle arrivals. And the unit extension is the only control parameter in this case. We develop a model to study the vehicle delay under a general arrival distribution with a given unit extension. Our model allows optimizing the intersection performance over the unit extension. The third part of this research applies graphical methods and diffusion approximations to the traffic signal problems. We reinterpret a graphical method which is originally proposed by Newell in order to directly measure the variance of the time for the queue clearance at a signalized intersection, which remains yet to be carefully examined in practice and would be rather challenging if only using the conventional queuing techniques. Our results demonstrate that graphical method explicitly presents both the deterministic and stochastic delay. We also illustrate that the theoretical background for the graphical methods in this particular application is inherently the diffusion approximation. Furthermore, we investigate the problems of disruptions occurred during a pre-timed traffic signal cycle. By diffusion approximation, we provide quantitative estimation on the duration that the effects of disruptions would dissipate...|$|E

40|$|Traffic {{detectors}} support most {{traffic management}} applications, {{so it is}} important that a detector performs as expected. This study evaluates the performance of four loop sensor models and the Remote Traffic Microwave Sensor (RTMS), adding to the body of sensor performance knowledge through the use of new analytical techniques. The study collected contact closure data from all five of the detectors and concurrent video data. Each loop sensor was deployed following Caltrans guidelines for at least 24 hours across dual loop detectors in each lane of I- 80, north of Oakland, CA. The research examined various distributions of the individual <b>vehicle</b> <b>actuations</b> from each of the detectors. This exercise found two loop sensor models locked up and not provide any data to the controller although they appeared fully functional from the front panel. The median on-time varied between the RTMS and the loop sensors, as well as from one loop sensor model to the next, which means the occupancy measurements will also change. The video was used to manually validate each vehicle passage over extended periods, preselected at random, with the errors classified by type (e. g., non-detected vehicle) and source (e. g., due to a lane change maneuver). The RTMS exhibited problems due to occlusion and reflections, while two of the loop sensors exhibited non-negligible problems. Then, the detector data are aggregated and used to evaluate the performance of each sensor under standard operation. Next, the results of two earlier evaluations of the RTMS are presented. The reports have not been formally published and to address the omission, this section recaps the relevant portions of those two studies {{in the context of the}} results presented above. This first effort considered the aggregated data reported by the RTMS using its internal controller emulation in comparison to dual loop detectors. The RTMS occupancy and flow measures are shown to be noisier than loops, though the velocity estimates are almost as good as those from single loops. The second study considers aggregate measurements from the contact closure data, comparing the RTMS against the dual loop detectors. For reference, the work also compared one loop against another in a dual loop detector, with the spacing between loops being greater than the spacing between the reference loops and the RTMS detection zone. As is illustrated in this study, the RTMS shows lane dependent results. ...|$|R

A new and promising use of networks is in the area of high performance control and automation, which is developing into attractive and widespread military applications such as autonomous unmanned vehicles and telerobotics. Some of the major concerns in using networks to perform remote network-based control are QoS issues such as time delay and bandwidth constraints. Disturbances and unanticipated events often happen to network-based applications. When anomalies happen, if the network cannot provide the required QoS, the application may have to lower its performance requirement and use the assigned QoS to do the best as it can to maintain the application availability.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design of}} an active safety framework that performs trajectory planning, threat assessment, and semi-autonomous control of passenger vehicles in hazard avoidance scenarios. The vehicle navigation task is formulated as a constrained optimal control problem with the constraints bounding a navigable region of the environment derived from forward -looking sensors. First, a constrained model predictive controller is designed to iteratively plan an optimal or "best-case" vehicle trajectory through the constrained corridor. This "best-case" scenario is then used to establish the minimum threat posed to the vehicle given its current state and driver inputs. Based on this threat assessment, the level of controller intervention required to prevent departure from the navigable corridor is calculated and driver/controller inputs are scaled accordingly. This approach minimizes controller intervention while ensuring that the vehicle does not depart from a navigable corridor. It also provides a unified architecture into which various <b>vehicle</b> models, <b>actuation</b> modes, trajectory-planning objectives, driver preferences, and levels of autonomy can be seamlessly integrated without changing the underlying controller structure. Simulated and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the framework's ability to incorporate multiple threat metrics and configurable intervention laws while sharing control with a human driver. Various maneuvers are tested, including lane-keeping, hazard avoidance, and multiple hazard avoidance and show that this framework capable of maintaining vehicle stability while semi-autonomously avoiding road hazards and conceding significant control to the human driver. by Sterling J.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. September 2008. Major: Civil Engineering. Advisor: Henry X. Liu. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xix, 154 pages. Performance monitoring for arterial traffic control and management system {{is an area}} of emerging focus in the United States. To properly study traffic flow at signalized intersections, both arrival/departure traffic flow data and associated signal status data are required. Although many existing signal control systems are capable of generating data to support performance assessment, most do not make it "easy" for the managing agencies to prioritize improvements and plan for future needs. Indeed, the 2005 Traffic Signal Operation Self Assessment Survey indicated that the majority of agencies involved in the operation and maintenance of traffic signal systems do not monitor or archive traffic system performance data in an effort to improve their operation. Therefore, despite studies having shown that the benefits of investments in improved signal timing outweigh the costs by 40 : 1 or more, signal retiming is often not repeated frequently enough to account for rapidly changing traffic patterns, largely due to the expense of manual data collection and performance measurements. The need to address the above problems inspired this research. The goal is to develop a real-time arterial performance measurement system, which can automatically collect and archive high-resolution traffic signal data, and build a rich list of performance measures. The objectives of this doctoral research are two-fold: (1) to develop a system for high-resolution traffic signal data collection, archival, and preprocessing; and (2) to develop a set of methodologies that can measure traffic signal performance, including queue length, delay and level of service (LOS) for individual intersections and travel time and number of stops for an arterial corridor. In this research, a system for high resolution traffic signal data collection is successfully built. The system, named as SMART-SIGNAL (Systematic Monitoring of Arterial Road Traffic and Signals), is an arterial data collection and performance measurement system, which simultaneously collects "event-based" high-resolution traffic data from multiple intersections and generates arterial performance measures in real time. In the SMART-SIGNAL system, a complete history of traffic signal control, including all signal events such as <b>vehicle</b> <b>actuations</b> on detectors and signal phase changes, is archived and stored. Using the collected "event" data, mathematical models are built to calculate intersection and arterial performance measures. A time-dependent queue length estimation model is proposed that can handle long queues under both under-saturated and over-saturated conditions. The model examines the changes in signal detector's occupancy profile within a cycle, and derives queue length by identifying traffic flow pattern changes during the queue discharging process. A turning movement proportion estimation model is also offered in this thesis. Detector counts from surrounding intersections are used to calculate right turning traffic for the subject intersection. An innovative algorithm is proposed in this research for arterial performance measurement by tracing virtual probe vehicles from origin to destination. One of three maneuvers: acceleration, deceleration or no-speed-change, is selected based on the current traffic states of the virtual probe. The step-by-step maneuver calculation stops until the virtual probe "arrives" at the destination, and various arterial performance measures, including travel time, can thus be estimated. An interesting property of the proposed model is that travel time estimation errors can be self-corrected with the signal status data, because the differences between a virtual probe vehicle and a real probe can be reduced when both of them meet the red signal phase. The virtual probe mimics regular travel behaviors of arterial drivers and thus can be treated as a representative vehicle traversing the arterial. The SMART-SIGNAL data collection system has been installed on an 11 -intersections arterial corridor along France Avenue in Hennepin County, Minnesota since February 2007. Event-based signal data are being collected in a 24 / 7 mode and then immediately archived in the SMART-SIGNAL system, thus yielding a tremendous amount of field data available for research. The field study shows that the proposed mathematical models can generate accurate time-dependent queue lengths, travel times, numbers of stops, and other performance measures under various traffic conditions...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{traffic signal}} control systems {{have not changed}} {{significantly}} in the past 40 - 50 years. The most widely applied traffic signal control systems are still time-of-day, coordinated-actuated system, since many existing advanced adaptive signal control systems are too complicated and fathomless for most of people. Recent advances in communications standards and technologies {{provide the basis for}} significant improvements in traffic signal control capabilities. In the United States, the IntelliDriveSM program (originally called Vehicle Infrastructure Integration - VII) has identified 5. 9 GHz Digital Short Range Communications (DSRC) as the primary communications mode for vehicle-to-vehicle (v 2 v) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (v 2 i) safety based applications, denoted as v 2 x. The ability for vehicles and the infrastructure to communication information is a significant advance over the current system capability of point presence and passage detection that is used in traffic control systems. Given enriched data from IntelliDriveSM, the problem of traffic control can be solved in an innovative data-driven and mathematical way to produce robust and optimal outputs. In this doctoral research, three different problems within a v 2 x environment- "enhanced pseudo-lane-level vehicle positioning", "robust coordinated-actuated multiple priority control", and "multimodal platoon-based arterial traffic signal control", are addressed with statistical techniques and mathematical programming. First, a pseudo-lane-level GPS positioning system is proposed based on an IntelliDriveSM v 2 x environment. GPS errors can be categorized into common-mode errors and noncommon-mode errors, where common-mode errors can be mitigated by differential GPS (DGPS) but noncommon-mode cannot. Common-mode GPS errors are cancelled using differential corrections broadcast from the road-side equipment (RSE). With v 2 i communication, a high fidelity roadway layout map (called MAP in the SAE J 2735 standard) and satellite pseudo-range corrections are broadcast by the RSE. To enhance and correct lane level positioning of a vehicle, a statistical process control approach is used to detect significant vehicle driving events such as turning at an intersection or lane-changing. Whenever a turn event is detected, a mathematical program is solved to estimate and update the GPS noncommon-mode errors. Overall the GPS errors are reduced by corrections to both common-mode and noncommon-mode errors. Second, an analytical mathematical model, a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), is developed to provide robust real-time multiple priority control, assuming penetration of IntelliDriveSM is limited to emergency vehicles and transit vehicles. This {{is believed to be the}} first mathematical formulation which accommodates advanced features of modern traffic controllers, such as green extension and <b>vehicle</b> <b>actuations,</b> to provide flexibility in implementation of optimal signal plans. Signal coordination between adjacent signals is addressed by virtual coordination requests which behave significantly different than the current coordination control in a coordinated-actuated controller. The proposed new coordination method can handle both priority and coordination together to reduce and balance delays for buses and automobiles with real-time optimized solutions. The robust multiple priority control problem was simplified as a polynomial cut problem with some reasonable assumptions and applied on a real-world intersection at Southern Ave. & 67 Ave. in Phoenix, AZ on February 22, 2010 and March 10, 2010. The roadside equipment (RSE) was installed in the traffic signal control cabinet and connected with a live traffic signal controller via Ethernet. With the support of Maricopa County's Regional Emergency Action Coordinating (REACT) team, three REACT vehicles were equipped with onboard equipments (OBE). Different priority scenarios were tested including concurrent requests, conflicting requests, and mixed requests. The experiments showed that the traffic controller was able to perform desirably under each scenario. Finally, a unified platoon-based mathematical formulation called PAMSCOD is presented to perform online arterial (network) traffic signal control while considering multiple travel modes in the IntelliDriveSM environment with high market penetration, including passenger vehicles. First, a hierarchical platoon recognition algorithm is proposed to identify platoons in real-time. This algorithm can output the number of platoons approaching each intersection. Second, a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) is solved to determine the future optimal signal plans based on the real-time platoon data (and the platoon request for service) and current traffic controller status. Deviating from the traditional common network cycle length, PAMSCOD aims to provide multi-modal dynamical progression (MDP) on the arterial based on the real-time platoon information. The integer feasible solution region is enhanced in order to reduce the solution times by assuming a first-come, first-serve discipline for the platoon requests on the same approach. Microscopic online simulation in VISSIM shows that PAMSCOD can easily handle two traffic modes including buses and automobiles jointly and significantly reduce delays for both modes, compared with SYNCHRO optimized plans...|$|R
40|$|Videos and VOS {{display of}} {{experimental}} tests with SuperDroid robot. The video shows the robot performing autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance. The VOS display shows {{a representation of}} some of the internal computation that is performed in order to build the velocity occupancy search space. Please see Chapter 4 for more details on experimental set-up. In order to autonomously navigate in an unknown environment, a robotic vehicle must be able to sense obstacles, determine their velocities, then select and execute a collision-free path that will lead quickly to a goal. However, the perceived location and motion of the obstacles will be uncertain due to the limited accuracy of the robot’s sensors. Thus, it is necessary to develop a system that can avoid moving obstacles using uncertain sensor data. The method proposed here is based on an occupancy grid —which has previously been used to avoid stationary obstacles in an uncertain environment—in conjunction with velocity obstacles—which allow a robot to avoid well-known moving obstacles. The combination of these techniques leads to velocity occupancy space (VOS) : a search space which allows the robot to avoid moving obstacles and navigate efficiently to a goal using uncertain sensor data. However, the basic VOS concept assumes holonomic robots that are capable of instantaneous and error free velocity changes¬ - capabilities that are not possessed by actual vehicles. Therefore, two extensions are derived by which VOS is adapted to work with actual robotic vehicles. The first extension to VOS is for an acceleration controlled, differential drive robot. Two different techniques by which the differentially drive robot may approximate the velocity of a holonomic robot are derived and evaluated. They are then combined in order to allow the robot to select the best method based on the robot’s current state. The second extension to the basic VOS algorithm is designed to explicitly account for the actuation error experienced in typical robotic vehicles. The velocity obstacles are augmented to account for both the error in the robot’s current position as well as the velocity error that will occur while the robot attempts to follow the command velocity so that these sources of error does not cause a collision. Numerous simulation trials have been used to validate the original VOS concept as well as the two extensions. Experimental trials, with a typical, differentially driven robotic <b>vehicle</b> with <b>actuation</b> error, have demonstrated the success of VOS under real world conditions...|$|R
5000|$|The biconic is a sphere-cone with an {{additional}} frustum attached. The biconic offers a significantly improved L/D ratio. A biconic designed for Mars aerocapture typically has an L/D of approximately 1.0 compared to an L/D of 0.368 for the Apollo-CM. The higher L/D makes a biconic shape better suited for transporting people to Mars due to the lower peak deceleration. Arguably, the most significant biconic ever flown was the Advanced Maneuverable Reentry Vehicle (AMaRV). Four AMaRVs {{were made by the}} McDonnell-Douglas Corp. and represented a significant leap in RV sophistication. Three AMaRVs were launched by Minuteman-1 ICBMs on 20 December 1979, 8 October 1980 and 4 October 1981. AMaRV had an entry mass of approximately 470 kg, a nose radius of 2.34 cm, a forward frustum half-angle of 10.4°, an inter-frustum radius of 14.6 cm, aft frustum half angle of 6°, and an axial length of 2.079 meters. No accurate diagram or picture of AMaRV has ever appeared in the open literature. However, a schematic sketch of an AMaRV-like vehicle along with trajectory plots showing hairpin turns has been published.AMaRV's attitude was controlled through a split body flap (also called a [...] "split-windward flap") along with two yaw flaps mounted on the <b>vehicle's</b> sides. Hydraulic <b>actuation</b> was used for controlling the flaps. AMaRV was guided by a fully autonomous navigation system designed for evading anti-ballistic missile (ABM) interception. The McDonnell Douglas DC-X (also a biconic) was essentially a scaled-up version of AMaRV. AMaRV and the DC-X also served as the basis for an unsuccessful proposal for what eventually became the Lockheed Martin X-33.|$|R
40|$|This report {{evaluates the}} option of using {{real-time}} optimization for the coordination of motion actuators in motion stability control of heavy vehicles. The general assumption is {{that the system is}} over actuated which means that there are more actuators than controlled motions. This is often the case for today’s heavy <b>vehicles.</b> With over <b>actuation</b> comes the possibility to perform the same type of motion control in several ways. When a specific motion is asked for, some sort of mapping is needed to actuator input. This mapping is known as control allocation. Roll-over accidents are far more common for heavy vehicles, than for passenger cars and therefore roll-over prevention is crucial to lower the rate of accidents. Roll-over occurs when the lateral forces are too high. A controller is therefore proposed to reduce the lateral forces under critical situations. Yaw instability, in the form of over- and understeer, is also critical for vehicles. Therefore a combined controller which accounts for roll as well as yaw stability simultaneously is proposed. The control allocation strategy used is a constrained weighted least square minimization criterion. Two algorithms for solving this criterion were studied, an Active Set method and a Primal-dual Interior Point method. In literature, the algorithms have been proposed suitable for fast real-time applications such as in automotive and aerospace control. The Active Set method has shown better results than the Primal-dual IP method with respect to convergence rate and computational load when the number of actuators is low. When the number of actuators is above 25 the same holds for the Primal-dual IP method. Furthermore the convergence pattern for Primal-dual IP method is smoother than that of the Active Set method, this makes it less sensitive if using a solution generated before convergence. The control system used shows performance similar to current systems in terms of vehicle stability. The proposed system can easily be reconfigured for varying numbers and types of actuators. Real-time performance benchmarking indicates that the system should be realizable in production vehicles in terms of execution time versus required sample rate. System robustness {{has been shown to be}} good in general...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{navigation}} and map data allows {{the realization of}} sophisticated functionality within a mobile control system, for example, {{as part of a}} driver assistance or vehicle guidance system. At the same time, handling it in real-time as part of a controller structure can become very complex and therefore challenging. The present thesis focuses on the creation and the use of a development environment that enables the implementation of such systems. The works aim at supporting a model-based development workflow and at providing a lean and compact foundation for navigation- and map-based control systems that, with reasonable efforts, can be transferred to different vehicles, different control hardware and different applications. Thereby, the intention is not only to provide a set of working and reusable software elements, but also a methodology describing how these elements can efficiently be tested, combined and implemented. A test platform {{in the form of a}} reduced-scale model vehicle is presented that serves as a demonstrator throughout the works described. With its simplified, car-like kinematics and the set of sensors and actuators it is equipped with, the vehicle's appearance is essentially reduced to the abstraction level of the dynamic models upon which the underlying software is built. It is suggested that control software developed and tested on the vehicle is generic enough to be, in principle, transferable to full-scale vehicles. Basic models of the vehicle dynamics, which are compatible to the ones commonly used in the area of vehicle dynamics, are provided. Furthermore, a Rapid Control Prototyping (RCP) workflow is proposed that makes use of various offline and online in-the-loop simulation methods to efficiently develop and test applications making use of the <b>vehicle's</b> sensing and <b>actuation</b> capabilities. Essential demands on GNSS-based control systems are introduced and a navigation filter implementation is presented. As a central element, a flexible Electronic Horizon (EH) provider is developed that allows the incorporation of data from digital road maps into real-time control systems. A versatile controller for lateral vehicle motion is developed and implemented in such a form that it can be suitably combined with the navigation filter and the real-time map data supplied by the EH provider. Thereby, the elements navigation filter, EH provider and lateral controller form a powerful set of tools that allow for realization of a number of interesting applications, both in an automotive and in a more general context. In order to prove the versatility of the proposed tools, various application examples are presented that have been enabled by them. These Applications are an Adaptive Front Lighting (AFL) system, an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system as well as a Virtual Track, Vehicle Platoon and a Heterogeneous Rendezvous application...|$|R
40|$|Urban {{vehicles}} {{are designed to}} deal with traffic problems, air pollution, energy consumption, and parking limitations in large cities. They are smaller and narrower than conventional vehicles, and thus more susceptible to rollover and stability issues. This thesis explores the unique dynamic behavior of narrow urban vehicles and different control <b>actuation</b> for <b>vehicle</b> stability to develop new reconfigurable and integrated control strategies for safe and reliable operations of urban vehicles. A novel reconfigurable vehicle model is introduced for the analysis and design of any urban vehicle configuration and also its stability control with any actuation arrangement. The proposed vehicle model provides modeling of four-wheeled (4 W) vehicles and three- wheeled (3 W) vehicles in Tadpole and Delta configurations in one set of equations. The vehicle model is also reconfigurable {{in the sense that}} different configurations of control actuation can be accommodated for controller design. To develop the reconfigurable vehicle model, two reconfiguration matrices are introduced; the corner and actuator reconfiguration matrices that are responsible for wheel and actuator configurations, respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed model properly matches the high-fidelity CarSim models for 3 W and 4 W vehicles. Rollover stability is particularly important for narrow urban vehicles. This thesis investigates the rollover stability of three-wheeled vehicles including the effects of road angles and road bumps. A new rollover index (RI) is introduced, which works for various road conditions including tripped and un-tripped rollovers on flat and sloped roads. The proposed RI is expressed in terms of measurable vehicle parameters and state variables. In addition to the effects of the lateral acceleration and roll angle, the proposed RI accounts for the effects of the longitudinal acceleration and the pitch angle, as well as the effects of road angles. Lateral and vertical road inputs are also considered since they can represent the effects of curbs, soft soil, and road bumps as the main causes of tripped rollovers. Sensitivity analysis is provided to evaluate and compare the effects of different vehicle parameters and state variables on rollover stability of 3 W vehicles. A high-fidelity CarSim model for a 3 W vehicle has been used for simulation and evaluation of the proposed RI accuracy. As a potentially useful mechanism for urban vehicles, wheel cambering is also investigated in this study to improve both lateral and rollover stability of narrow vehicles. A suspension system with active camber has an additional degree of freedom for changing the camber angle through which vehicle handling and stability can be improved. Conventionally, camber has been known for its ability to increase lateral forces. In this thesis, the benefits of cambering for rollover stability of narrow {{vehicles are}} also investigated and compared with a vehicle tilt mechanism. The simulation results indicate that active camber systems can improve vehicle lateral stability and rollover behavior. Furthermore, by utilizing more friction forces near the limits, the active camber system provides more improvement in maneuverability and lateral stability than the active front steering does. The proposed reconfigurable vehicle model leads us {{to the development of a}} general integrated reconfigurable control structure. The reconfigurable integrated controller can be used to meet different stability objectives of 4 W and 3 W vehicles with flexible combinations of control actuation. Employing the reconfigurable vehicle model, the proposed unified controller renders reconfigurability and can be easily adapted to Tadpole and Delta configurations of 3 W as well as 4 W vehicles without reformulating the problem. Different types and combinations of actuators can be selected for the control design including or combination of differential braking, torque vectoring, active front steering, active rear steering, and active camber system. The proposed structure provides integrated control of the main stability objectives including handling improvement, lateral stability, traction/braking control, and rollover prevention. The Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach is used to develop the reconfigurable controller. The performance of the introduced controller has been evaluated through CarSim simulations for different <b>vehicles</b> and control <b>actuation</b> configurations...|$|R
