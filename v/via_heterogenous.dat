40|$|BACKGROUND: Alveolar macrophages {{are thought}} to play an {{important}} part in regulating lung immune responses. While it is clear that human alveolar macrophages suppress T cell proliferation in vitro, the mechanisms by which this is achieved are not clear, nor is it known whether alveolar macrophages also inhibit other aspects of T cell function. METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with phytohaemagglutinin or house dust mite allergen, and cultured with variable numbers of autologous alveolar macrophages obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage from 20 normal subjects. RESULTS: Alveolar macrophages induced a reversible inhibition of T cell proliferation in response to both mitogen and allergen stimulation, with the latter being considerably more susceptible to inhibition. This was achieved <b>via</b> <b>heterogenous</b> mechanisms, involving both soluble factors derived from alveolar macrophages and cell-cell contact. Despite inhibiting proliferation, alveolar macrophages had little or no effect on T cell calcium flux, the characteristic changes in CD 3, CD 2, CD 28 and interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) receptor expression which accompany normal T cell activation, and IL- 2 and interferon gamma secretion. In contrast, alveolar macrophages inhibited the tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins which may be involved in IL- 2 receptor-associated signal transduction. CONCLUSIONS: The immunoregulatory properties of alveolar macrophages are relatively selective, allowing T cell activation and cytokine secretion while inhibiting T cell proliferation within the lung. ...|$|E
30|$|A new paradigm, called Cognitive Radio (CR), {{has emerged}} {{in the field of}} {{wireless}} communication, to alleviate the imbalance between spectrum allocation and its use [1, 2]. CR entails the temporary usage of unused portions of the spectrum (spectrum holes or white spaces), owned by the licensed users (Primary Users--PUs), to be accessed by unlicensed users (Secondary Users--SUs). Built on the platform of software-defined radio (SDR), a CR node is rendered reconfigurable: the SDR allows the operating parameters such as frequency range, modulation type or output power to be reconfigured in software, without making any alteration in the hardware [2]. It is anticipated that the Next-Generation (xG) communication networks will be based on CR [2]. These networks will provide high bandwidth to mobile users <b>via</b> <b>heterogenous</b> wireless architectures and dynamic spectrum access techniques. Besides the tasks of spectrum sensing, spectrum allocation, spectrum sharing and spectrum mobility, one of the key functions of CR nodes in spectrum-aware xG networks is spectrum utilization. The spectrum utilization function entails efficient Radio Resource Management (RRM), the aim of which is to evaluate the available resources (power, time slots, bandwidth, etc) and assign them to meet the QoS objectives of the SU, within some constraints on factors (typically interference) which limit the performance of the PU [3]. Furthermore, for optimum spectrum utilization it is necessary to be adaptive to, one or more, time-varying characteristics of the system, such as the wireless channel state, number of users, QoS requirements, etc.|$|E
40|$|The Scanning {{electrochemical}} microscopy (SECM) {{is used to}} selectively detect intervening mismatches and abasic sites within monolayers of ds-DNA self-assembled onto gold electrodes. The electrocatalytic cycle involving oxidation of leuco{{methylene blue}} (LB), an electrochemically reduced form of methylene blue intercalated within the ds-DNA monolayer self-assembled on gold electrode, by the SECM tip-generated Fe(CN) 63 - allows regeneration of LB <b>via</b> long-range <b>heterogenous</b> electron transfer mediated by the DNA π-stack. Monolayers featuring disruptions in the DNA π-stack via a single-base mismatch or abasic site exhibit strongly attenuated methylene blue electrochemistry within the DNA film leading to a disruption of the catalytic cycle, thereby diminishing the SECM tip current. The inherent differences in catalytic tip currents {{can be used to}} distinguish monolayer domains containing native ds-DNA versus ds-DNA containing π-stack lesions within the micron-level lateral spatial resolution of SECM. The analogous catalytic cycle between Ru(NH 3) 62 + attached to the ds-DNA via electrostatic interactions with backbone phosphates and SECM tip generated Fe(CN) 63 - is insensitive to the single-base mismatches or abasic sites indicating the crucial importance of π-stack mediated electrochemistry in the proposed detection scheme. The proposed approach, in conjunction with the spatial resolution of SECM and its ability to detect DNA hybridization opens new possibilities in the development of micro-array devices for DNA analysis...|$|R
