40|$|Abstract. A novel {{phase shift}} full bridge (PSFB) {{converter}} with <b>voltage-doubler</b> and decoupling integrated magnetics in photovoltaic (PV) systems is proposed. Considering the {{demand that the}} output voltage {{is higher than the}} input voltage in PV systems, the <b>voltage-doubler</b> is added to achieve higher voltage gain compared with the traditional PSFB. In order to avoid current oscillation caused by the <b>voltage-doubler</b> and obtain the wide zero voltage switching (ZVS) ranges, an external inductor is imposed on the circuit. Especially, to obtain much higher power density, the external inductor and transformer are integrated into one magnetic core. The operation and voltage gain of proposed converter are analyzed. Also, in order to reveal the effects the integrated magnetics gives to the converter, the decoupling condition and the expression of leakage inductor of integrated magnetics are obtained in detail. Finally a 100 W prototype converter is made and the experimental results are given to verify the analysis. Key words: integrated magnetics, <b>voltage-doubler,</b> PSFB converter, PV system. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a generalized approach to deriving single-phase {{power factor correction}} (PFC) circuits with bridgeless and <b>voltage-doubler</b> structures. The approach requires two dc/dc converters connected in a parallel-input series-output manner.

40|$|The {{three-phase}} two-level {{voltage source}} converter (VSC) is widely employed in power conversions between AC and DC for its four-quadrant operation and control flexibility. However, it {{suffers from the}} low output voltage range with a peak value of half DC-link per phase, which necessitates the use of either high DC-link voltage or bulky step-up transformer to enable the medium voltage operation. Additionally, the high common mode (CM) voltage between AC loads neutral points and ground may reduce the service life and reliability of electric machinery. In this paper, a three-phase AC side <b>voltage-doubling</b> VSC topology with intrinsic Buck-Boost cell is analyzed. By this configuration, the AC side voltage is doubled with the phase peak value equal to DC-link. That is, {{only half of the}} DC side capacitor bank is needed to generate the same output voltage. The proposed converter uses its buck-boost cell as a virtual voltage source to synthesize negative half of the output voltage by modulating its output AC phase voltage around the negative bus (which is the real zero when grounded). This permits the average CM voltage to be suppressed to zero, and loads connected to converter AC side not to withstand any DC voltage stress (reducing the insulation requirement). Modeling and control design for both rectifier and inverter modes of this converter in synchronous reference frame have been investigated to ensure a four-quadrant three-phase back-to-back system. Experimental results have verified the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed configuration and the designed control strategies...|$|R

40|$|A {{high-voltage}} gain two-switch quasi-Z-source isolated DC/DC converter {{has been}} presented in this study. It consists of a quasi-Z-source network at its input, a push-pull square-wave inverter at its middle, and a <b>voltage-doubler</b> rectifier at its output. When coordinated appropriately, the new converter uses less switches, a smaller common duty cycle and less turns for the transformer when compared with existing topologies. Its size and weight are therefore smaller, whereas its efficiency is higher.

40|$|Abstract—An {{adaptive}} energy-harvesting circuit {{with low}} power dissipation is presented and demonstrated, which {{is useful for}} efficient ac/dc voltage conversion of a piezoelectric micropower generator. The circuit operates stand-alone, and it extracts the piezoelectric strain energy {{independent of the load}} and piezoelec-tric parameters without using any external sensor. The circuit consists of a <b>voltage-doubler</b> rectifier, a step-down switching con-verter, and an analog controller operating with a single supply voltage in the range of 2. 5 – 15 V. The controller uses the piezo-electric voltage as a feedback and regulates the rectified voltage to adaptively improve the extracted power. The nonscalable power dissipation of the controller unit is less than 0. 05 mW, and the efficiency of the circuit is about 60 % for output power levels above 0. 5 mW. Experimental verifications of the circuit show the follow-ing: 1) the circuit notably increases the extracted power from a piezoelectric element compared to a simple full-bridge diode rectifier without control circuitry, and 2) the efficiency of the circuit is dominantly determined by its switching converter.

The simple boost converter with <b>voltage-doubler</b> output provides a digitally programmed output voltage of 25 V to 71 V from a 5 V supply. Ceramic filter capacitors and intentionally slowed MOSFET switching transitions provide a low noise output. The avalanche photodiode detector (APD) {{is used as a}} receiver in optical communications, as is the pin diode. The APD is more sensitive, but it must be biased properly to produce the appropriate electron flow for a given flux of photons. Figure 1 shows the schematic of a low-noise APD bias power supply. This circuit is based on a MAX 5026 low-noise, fixed frequency PWM boost converter operating in discontinuous inductor current mode. Figure 1. Low-noise APD bias power supply. Varying the control input voltage from 0 V to 2. 5 V results in output voltage change from 71 V to 24. 7 V. The switching time of this device has been intentionally slowed down to reduce the high-frequency spikes present in other similar devices. The internal switching frequency of the MAX 5026 is 500 kHz. The internal lateral DMOS switching device has an absolute maximum rating of 40 V, and along with the external voltage doubler network formed by C 3, D 2, D 3 and C 4, output voltages up to 71 V are possible.
