25|$|Most hysterectomies in the United States {{are done}} via {{laparotomy}} (abdominal incision, {{not to be}} confused with laparoscopy). A transverse (Pfannenstiel) incision is made through the abdominal wall, usually above the pubic bone, as close to the upper hair line of the individual's lower pelvis as possible, similar to the incision made for a caesarean section. This technique allows physicians the greatest access to the reproductive structures and is normally done for removal of the entire reproductive complex. The recovery time for an open hysterectomy is 4–6 weeks and sometimes longer due to the need to cut through the abdominal wall. Historically, the biggest problem with this technique was infections, but infection rates are well-controlled and not a major concern in modern medical practice. An open hysterectomy provides the most effective way to explore the abdominal cavity and perform complicated surgeries. Before the refinement of the vaginal and laparoscopic vaginal techniques it was also the only possibility to achieve subtotal hysterectomy, meanwhile <b>vaginal</b> <b>route</b> is the preferable technique in most circumstances.|$|E

Primary infection of mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract is associated with head pruritus, while lung infection results in chest pruritus. Vaginal infection of bovines, which regularly show pruritus of the hindquarters, has been found to be associated with a concurrent genital infection in swine on the same premises, and investigations have evidenced that the vaginal infection of cattle had been sexually transmitted by man from genitally infected sows (animal sodomy, zoophilia, bestiallity). Genital infection in swine herds has been closely correlated with the use of boars from boar centres for natural service of sows.|$|E

5000|$|Thiolated {{polymers}} or designated thiomers {{were first}} described by Andreas Bernkop-Schnürch et al. in 1999. One year later the same research group introduced the name thiomers. They are mucoadhesive polymers which display thiol group bearing side chains. In brief, low molecular mass thiol group bearing compounds are covalently bound to a polymeric backbone. This backbone consists of well-established and safe polymers such as chitosan or poly(acrylic acid). It {{has been demonstrated}} in various studies, that thiomers exhibit mucoadhesive, permeation enhancing, controlled release as well as enzyme and efflux pump inhibitory properties. These features make the thiomer technology highly interesting for non-invasive delivery routes, including in first instance the oral but also the nasal, buccal and <b>vaginal</b> <b>route.</b> Thiomers can be directly compressed to tablets or given as solutions. Furthermore thiomer based micro- and nanoparticles have already been developed.In 2012 a second generation of thiomers - so called preactivated or S-protected thiomers - were introduced.

40|$|Introduction. Endometrial cancer {{represents}} the fourth most frequent malignancy in women of any age, tending {{to become the}} most common gynaecological tumor in developed Countries. A retrospective analysis has been conducted on the prognostic factors of endometrial neoplasm during 15 -years experience (1977 - 1991). Material and Methods. 321 patients affected by stage I and II endometrial carcinoma have been treated surgically first hand. Surgical-pathological staging and prognostic factors were reviewed and related to follow-up and 5 -year survival rate. Results. The age-peak of patients was 50 - 70 years; prevalent histologic type was adenocarcinoma (95. 6 %); 269 patients were in stage I and 52 in stage II. In stage I disease overall 5 -year survival rate resulted to be 81. 4 %, while in stage TI it fell to 59. 6 %. Discussion. Myometrial involvement by adenocarcinomatous cells is probably the most important prognostic factor, considering its reliability and non-contradictory evaluation.

40|$|Group B streptococci (GBS) colonize {{the female}} genital and rectal tracts {{and can cause}} {{invasive}} infection in susceptible newborns. An optimally effective GBS vaccine should induce mucosal and systemic immunity. In this study, we investigate the local and systemic immune responses to GBS type III capsular polysaccharide (CPS) after mucosal vaccination of mice via intranasal, peroral, rectal, and <b>vaginal</b> <b>routes,</b> with GBS type III CPS conjugated with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit (GBS III CPS-rCTB). Cholera toxin (CT) was added as an adjuvant. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA antibodies to the CPS were tested in serum, lungs, and intestinal, rectal, and vaginal extracts by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The conjugated CPS administered by intranasal, peroral, rectal, and <b>vaginal</b> <b>routes</b> was much more effective at inducing both mucosal and systemic antibody responses to GBS III CPS than was unconjugated CPS. The CPS-specific immune responses in various organs were dependent on the route of immunization. Generally, {{the highest levels of}} IgA and IgG were generated in the regions or sites of the conjugate exposure. Thus, intranasal vaccination elicited the highest anti-CPS IgA and IgG antibody levels in the lungs, whereas peroral administration in the intestinal site and vaginal vaccination elicited the highest antibody levels in the vagina. Rectal vaccination was superior to the other routes in inducing high antibody levels in the rectum. The four routes of mucosal vaccination also induced distant antibody responses to CPS. Rectal vaccination induced high specific IgA levels in the vagina and intestine, and oral administration induced high specific IgA levels in the lungs and rectum. All four routes of vaccination with the conjugate elicited similarly high levels of anti-CPS IgG in serum. Intranasal vaccination with different doses of the conjugate (10, 30, and 80 μg of CPS) did not have a significant influence on the anti-CPS specific antibody responses. Intranasal immunization induced better antibody responses when one dose of the conjugate was divided and given on three consecutive days compared to administration of the full dose on one occasion. In conclusion, rectal and vaginal vaccination may be the best way of stimulating anti-CPS immune responses in the rectal and vaginal tracts, while high levels of anti-CPS antibodies in the lungs can be achieved after intranasal administration. The vaccination regimen thus might influence the mucosal immune response to CPS. This conjugate may serve as an effective mucosal vaccine for preventing mucosal colonization and invasive infection caused by GBS...|$|R

Women with bothersome prolapse may be offered pessary management or {{may choose to}} undergo corrective surgery. In choosing the most appropriate surgical procedure, there are many factors to consider. These may include the location(s) of anatomic defects, the severity of prolapse symptoms, the activity level of the woman, and concerns regarding the durability of the repair. In many instances, women and their surgeons are challenged to weigh {{the risks and benefits}} of native tissue versus mesh-augmented repairs. Though mesh-augmented repairs may offer better durability, they are also associated with unique complications, such as mesh erosion. Furthermore, newer surgical techniques of mesh placement via abdominal or <b>vaginal</b> <b>routes</b> may result in different outcomes compared to traditional techniques. Biologic grafts may also be considered to improve durability of a surgical repair, while avoiding potential complications of synthetic mesh.

40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that the {{transmission}} of HIV is most likely to occur via rectal or <b>vaginal</b> <b>routes,</b> and rarely through oral exposure. However, the mechanisms of virus entry at mucosal surfaces remain incompletely understood. Prophylactic strategies against HIV infection may be attainable once gaps in current knowledge are filled. To address these gaps, we evaluated essentially normal epithelial surfaces and mapped the periluminal distribution of CD 4 + HIV target cells, including T cells and antigen-presenting cells, and an HIV-binding molecule gp 340 that can be expressed by epithelial cells in secreted and cell-associated forms. Immunohistochemistry for CD 4, CD 16, CD 3, CD 1 a and gp 340 in human oral, rectal/sigmoid and cervical mucosal samples from HIV-negative subjects demonstrated that periluminal HIV target cells were more prevalent at rectal/sigmoid and endocervical surfaces lined by simple columnar epithelium, than at oral and ectocervical surfaces covered by multilayered stratified squamous epithelium (p< 0. 001). gp 340 expression patterns at these sites were also distinct and strong in oral minor salivary gland acini and ducts, including ductal saliva, in individual rectum/sigmoid and endocervix periluminar columnar cells, and in ectocervix squamous cells. Only weak expression was noted in the oral non-ductal squamous epithelium. We conclude that periluminal HIV target cells, together with periluminal epithelial cell-associated gp 340 appear to be most accessible for HIV transmission at rectal/sigmoid and endocervical surfaces.

A dominant Th 1 -type cytokine profile developed in mice given live MoPn via the intranasal, oral, and <b>vaginal</b> <b>routes</b> with ratios of gamma interferon-secreting cells to interleukin 4 -secreting cells greater than 10. In contrast, mice injected subcutaneously produced a Th 2 -type profile with a gamma interferon/interleukin 4 ratio of only 0. 7. These mice also had significantly higher anti-MoPn immunoglobulin G 1 serum titers, confirming a Th 2 -type cytokine profile. Exposure of mice to live MoPn, by any <b>route</b> prior to <b>vaginal</b> challenge, resulted in a shortened course of infection. However, the subcutaneous group resolved the vaginal infection more slowly, with 60 % (6 of 10 mice) of the mice still isolation positive 12 days after challenge compared with only 20 % of mice given live MoPn by other routes. Administration of UV-inactivated MoPn did not provide protection against a vaginal challenge. The decreased ability to clear infection was not associated with a shift in the cytokine profile, since intranasal and oral administration of UV-inactivated MoPn resulted in a predominant Th 1 -type response. Taken together, these data indicate that the initial route of MoPn administration can direct the type of response produced after a local MoPn infection and thus influence the ability of the immune response to protect against subsequent infection...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{identify}} {{and evaluate the}} shedding routes and patterns following experimentally-induced Brucella melitensis infection in dexamethasone-treated and transport-stressed goats. Materials and Methods: Twenty four healthy, adult goats were divided into 4 groups: A, B, C and D respectively. Group A was treated with dexamethasone for 8 days prior to inoculation with 10 (7) Colony Forming Units of B. melitensis via the intraocular route. Group B was transported for 3 hours prior to inoculation with a similar dose. Group C was inoculated with a similar dose without subjecting the animals to any prior treatment, and this group served as our positive control. Group D was not inoculated with the infective dose and served as our negative control. Blood samples along with nasal, ocular, and vaginal swabs were collected on days 0, 3, 7, 10, 14, and weekly thereafter until day 63 post inoculation (pi) and were analyzed by PCR, Rose Bengal Plate Test (RBPT), and indirect ELISAtechniques. Results: The nasal, ocular and vaginal swabs tested positive for Brucellosis with PCR from day 7, with nasal route being {{the first and most}} consistent route to reveal the positive results. Group B showed the earliest onset of shedding the bacterium (day 7) followed by group Awhich started from day 10 and shed relatively more positive of the bacterium via the routes examined. Blood samples tested positive with PCR from day 7 through 14 and the results were inconsistent subsequently.

We used 400  μg misoprostol rectally or sublingually 2  h before hysteroscopy based on the studies of pregnancy termination [14, 15]. The plasma concentration of misoprostol biologically active metabolite peaks less than 30  min after oral or sublingual administration and 1  h after the vaginal one, then it gradually decreases [16]. The systemic bioavailability of sublingually administered misoprostol is significantly better than oral or <b>vaginal</b> <b>routes</b> [16]. Rectally administered misoprostol {{is associated with a}} qualitatively similar absorption curve as that vaginally administered but with lower bioavailability [17]. Also, studies have found that higher doses of misoprostol did not provide greater cervical response than lower dosages [15]. Ngai et al. [18] studied the effect of 400  μg oral misoprostol on premenopausal women undergoing hysteroscopy for infertility and demonstrated that the cumulative forces required to dilate the cervix were 61 % lower in misoprostol group compared to placebo and the mean baseline cervical width was significantly greater in the misoprostol group. The same was also observed by Batukan et al. [19]. Similarly, Preutthipan and Herabutya [20] evaluated the effectiveness of 200  μg vaginal misoprostol on cervical dilatation in non-pregnant premenopausal women undergoing hysteroscopy and found that the mean baseline cervical width was significantly greater and the mean time of cervical dilatation to Hegar 9 was significantly shorter after misoprostol compared to placebo. They also mentioned more cervical tears in the control group. Similar results were reported by Singh et al. [12] and Choksuchat et al. [13]. Only a few studies evaluated the effectiveness of sublingual misoprostol for cervical ripening in non-pregnant premenopausal women undergoing hysteroscopy. In agreement, Mulayim et al. [21] compared the effectiveness of 200  μg sublingual misoprostol vs. placebo and found that less patients needed cervical dilatation in the misoprostol group whereas, the duration of dilatation was longer in the placebo group. Also, Lee et al. [22] compared sublingual to oral/vaginal misoprostol before hysteroscopic procedures in non-pregnant premenopausal women. They concluded that the preoperative cervical width and time to Hegar 10 were comparable among the three groups. In addition, the sublingual route was effective when compared with the vaginal and the oral routes for pregnancy termination [23, 24]. However, to our knowledge, there have been no published studies comparing sublingual to other routes (including rectal) in non-pregnant premenopausal women undergoing hysteroscopy.|$|R
