In particular, bands may be worn at Oxford only by high officers of the university and by doctors on certain occasions. Some women are required to wear bands with a black tie (in practice a black <b>velvet</b> <b>ribbon)</b> while others holding certain offices are permitted the alternative of a white bow tie with their bands. At Cambridge, there are only strict sub-fusc rules in Statutes and Ordinances for graduation ceremonies, at which the rules are enforced strictly by the proctors. [...] Persons who are incorrectly dressed may be prevented from graduating in person, and their Praelector or Presenter may be fined.|$|E

On this one, still today, the signs of the fire that burnt up the church in 1506 are visible; the ochre damask dress of Isabella Sforza of Aragon, with squared neckline and long silk ribbons to keep together the sleeves with the bodice. The skirt is 103 cm long and 480 cm large, with a grapevine decoration and a pleat that used to be stuffed with wool, so as to have a shapely waistline and match the fifteenth-century ideal of feminine beauty; the ivory satin suit of Peter of Aragon, with <b>velvet</b> <b>ribbons</b> and a gold velvet hat; the brown velvet suit attributed to Francesco Ferdinando D’Avalos (husband of the 16th century poet Vittoria Colonna); the ivory dress in taffeta and grosgrain of Maria of Aragon and the flax turban found on her head; different vestments and shoes of noble children who mainly died from the plague.|$|R

Some support was necessary, for she was very stout, and so compressed that the upper part of her body hung considerably in advance of her feet, which could only trip in tiny steps, owing to the tightness of the skirt round her ankles. The dress itself consisted of a small piece of shiny yellow satin, adorned here and there indiscriminately with round shields of blue and green beads made to imitate hues of a peacock's breast. On the summit of a frothy castle of hair a purple plume stood erect, while her short neck was encircled by a black <b>velvet</b> <b>ribbon</b> knobbed with gems, and golden bracelets were tightly wedged into the flesh of her fat gloved arms. She had the face of an impertinent but jolly little pig, mottled red under a dusting of powder.|$|E

50|$|After 1850 silk {{manufacture}} {{stopped in}} Stockport {{and in other}} towns, and Macclesfield became known as 'the silk town'. At the Great Exhibition in 1851 Macclesfield firms exhibited calgees, Bandanna handkerchiefs, <b>velvets,</b> satins <b>ribbons</b> and shawls. The industry contracted as fashion showed a preference for cottons and French silk. The workforce contracted to 5,000 in 1886. The prominent silk families were also prominent in civic and religious life. Most were keen non-conformists and built chapels for their workers. Silk paid {{for the education of}} the poor. Macclesfield Sunday School was founded in 1796 by non-conformists, and the large building that now houses the Heritage Centre was built in 1813-1815. Here 2,500 children each year received a formal education on their one-day off from work. The Anglicans built the National School on Duke Street as a response. It remained in use as a day school until 1960. The technical skills that an apprentice would need were provided by a Technical School, and there was a School of Art where designers were trained.|$|R

6000|$|He {{was back}} in his rooms in London two hours before he dared begin expecting her. Living alone there but for a {{caretaker}} who came every morning {{for an hour or}} two, made dust, and departed, he had no need for caution. And when he had procured flowers, and the fruits and cakes which they certainly would not eat--when he had arranged the tea-table, and made the grand tour at least twenty times, he placed himself with a book at the little round window, to watch for her approach. There, very still, he sat, not reading a word, continually moistening his dry lips and sighing, to relieve the tension of his heart. At last he saw her coming. She was walking close to the railings of the houses, looking neither to right nor left. She had on a lawn frock, and a hat of the palest coffee-coloured straw, with a narrow black <b>velvet</b> <b>ribbon.</b> She crossed the side street, stopped for a second, gave a swift look round, then came resolutely on. What was it made him love her so? What was the secret of her fascination? Certainly, no conscious enticements. Never did anyone try less to fascinate. He could not recall one single little thing that she had done to draw him to her. Was it, perhaps, her very passivity, her native pride that never offered or asked anything, a sort of soft stoicism in her fibre; that and some mysterious charm, as close and intimate as scent was to a flower? ...|$|E
6000|$|Mark Ambient called again, and Dolcino {{struggled}} in the maternal embrace, {{but he was}} too tightly held, and after two or three fruitless efforts he suddenly turned round and buried his head deep in his mother's lap. There was a certain awkwardness in the scene; I thought it rather odd that Mrs. Ambient should pay so little attention to her husband. But I would not for the world have betrayed my thought, and, to conceal it, I observed that it must be such a pleasant thing to have tea in the garden. [...] "Ah, she won't let him come!" [...] said Mark Ambient, with a sigh; and we went our way 'till we reached the two ladies. He mentioned my name to his wife, and I noticed that he addressed her as [...] "My dear," [...] very genially, without any trace of resentment at her detention of the child. The quickness of the transition made me vaguely ask myself whether he were henpecked,--a shocking conjecture, which I instantly dismissed. Mrs. Ambient was quite such a wife as I should have expected him to have; slim and fair, with a long neck and pretty eyes and an air of great refinement. She was a little cold, and a little shy; but she was very sweet, and she had a certain look of race, justified by my afterwards learning that she was [...] "connected" [...] with two or three great families. I have seen poets married to women of whom it was difficult to conceive that they should gratify the poetic fancy,--women with dull faces and glutinous minds, who were none the less, however, excellent wives. But there was no obvious incongruity in Mark Ambient's union. Mrs. Ambient, delicate and quiet, in a white dress, with her beautiful child at her side, was worthy of the author of a work so distinguished as Beltraffio. Bound her neck she wore a black <b>velvet</b> <b>ribbon,</b> of which the long ends, tied behind, hung down her back, and to which, in front, was attached a miniature portrait of her little boy. Her smooth, shining hair was confined in a net She gave me a very pleasant greeting, and Dolcino--I thought this little name of endearment delightful--took advantage of her getting up to slip away from her and go to his father, who said nothing to him, but simply seized him and held him high in his arms for a moment, kissing him several times.|$|E

40|$|The age {{of global}} {{exchange}} {{began in the}} 16 th century with the sea trade established by the Spanish and Portuguese as they navigated east and west. The Americas, with their wealth of natural resources that included silver, textile dyes and fibers, were both a supplier {{as well as a}} recipient of the goods carried along the trade routes. Archival records, ship manifests and other documents, as well as paintings from the period record the vital role that trade textiles played in this exchange, but few actual extant fabrics have been preserved. Some 34 sets of textile samples sent with official reports from the Vice royalties of New Spain, New Granada and Peru to the King of Spain during the 18 th century have been preserved in the Archivo General de las Indias, in Seville. Rarely published, and almost unstudied, they provide a glimpse into the types of textiles produced in the region under Spanish authority, and also record imports from Europe and Asian into the region. Samples include swatches of silk made in Mexico (with the Spanish-introduced sericulture), along with <b>velvets,</b> brocaded <b>ribbons,</b> and specialty fabrics with silk and metal threads demonstrating the high level of skill achieved by Mexican silk weavers. Cotton textiles are also included, both plain and printed, {{in the style of the}} Indianillas, the Mexican version of block-printed trade textiles from India. Other examples include whole sets of English woolens in brilliant colors from Colchester, England sent from the governor of Havana 1735, and other Spanish bayetas presumably to indicate what was available in the local markets. The paper will present these remarkable documents that provide a new source for understanding of the role of the Americas in global trade of the mid-Colonial era...|$|R
6000|$|He heard this, oddly, almost with relief. Was it {{the long}} walk alone, or being up there so high? Or simply {{that he was very}} hungry?

What was it that had taken away from him all his restless feeling, made him happy and content?... He did not know that the newest thing always fascinates the puppy in its gambols! ... He sat a long while after lunch, trying to draw the little cows, watching the sun on the cheek of that pretty maiden, trying to talk to her in German. And when at last he said: [...] "Adieu!" [...] and she murmured [...] "Kuss die Hand. Adieu!" [...] there was quite a little pang in his heart.... Wonderful and queer is the heart of a man!... For all that, as he neared home he hastened, till he was actually running. Why had he stayed so long up there? She would be back--she would expect to see him; and that young beast of a violinist would be with her, perhaps, instead! He reached the hotel just in time to rush up and dress, and rush down to dinner. Ah! They were tired, no doubt--were resting in their rooms. He sat through dinner as best he could; got away before dessert, and flew upstairs. For a minute he stood there doubtful; on which door should he knock? Then timidly he tapped on hers. No answer! He knocked loud on his tutor's door. No answer! They were not back, then. Not back? What could that mean? Or could it be that they were both asleep? Once more he knocked on her door; then desperately turned the handle, and took a flying glance. Empty, tidy, untouched! Not back! He turned and ran downstairs again. All the guests were streaming out from dinner, and he became entangled with a group of 'English Grundys' discussing a climbing accident which had occurred in Switzerland. He listened, feeling suddenly quite sick. One of them, the short grey-bearded Grundy with the rather whispering voice, said to him: [...] "All alone again to-night? The Stormers not back?"
