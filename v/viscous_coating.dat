This new procedure combines a method for removing the aqueous coating of the fibers and a technique that allows the accurate measurement of their cross sectional area. Comparison of the tensile behaviour of different samples indicates that naturally spun viscid lines show a large variability, {{comparable to that of}} other silks, such as major ampullate gland silk and silkworm silk. Nevertheless, application of a statistical analysis allowed identifying two independent parameters that underlie the variability and characterize the observed range of true stress-true strain curves.

The long-time dynamics of the system can be represented in terms of coupled equations for the masses and positions of the droplets. Analysis of the decrease of energy of the system shows that coarsening, decreasing the number of droplets with increasing time, is favored. Here we describe the two coarsening mechanisms present in dewetting films: (i) mass exchange leading to collapse of individual drops, and (ii) spatial motion leading to droplet collisions and merging events. Regimes where each of mechanisms are dominant are identified, and the statistics of the coarsening process are explained. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Pulsed-gradient spin−echo NMR and small-angle neutron scattering {{have been used to}} study the aqueous solution interaction of various model polymer therapeutics with mucin, the principle organic component within mucus. Nonionic polymers such as linear and star-branched poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and dextrin showed no appreciable interaction with mucin but suffered a moderate retardation in their rate of diffusion through the mucin solution. A strong interaction with mucin was observed for a series of polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers and hyperbranched poly(ethylene imine) (PEI), which displayed a characteristic pH-dependent profile and led to significant reductions in their rates of diffusion. These observations have implications for the design of optimized polymer therapeutic structures being adopted for the delivery of therapeutic moieties through mucin-rich environments.

The flow is driven by surface tension and gravity and the liquid is assumed to wet the cylinder perfectly. When the tube is horizontal, we use large-time simulations to describe the bifurcation structure of the capillary equilibria appearing at low Bond number. We identify a new film configuration in which an isolated dry patch appears {{at the top of the}} tube and demonstrate hysteresis in the transition between rivulets and annular collars as the tube length is varied. For a tube tilted to the vertical, we show how a long initially uniform rivulet can break up first into isolated drops and then annular collars, which subsequently merge. We also show that the speed at which a localized drop moves down the base of a tilted tube is non-monotonic in tilt angle...|$|R

30|$|The wall fouling {{layer in}} a water-lubricated {{pipeline}} {{can be considered as}} a stationary <b>coating</b> film of <b>viscous</b> oil adhered on the pipe wall. This is because the relative velocity of this layer is negligible compared to the average mixture velocity (Joseph et al. 1999; McKibben et al. 2000, 2016; Shook et al. 2002; Schaan et al. 2002; Vuong et al. 2009). This wall coating layer can produce a large equivalent hydrodynamic roughness value: The typical equivalent roughness of a commercial steel pipe is about 0.045  mm, while the hydrodynamic roughness (inferred from pressure loss measurements) of a pipeline with a viscous oil layer on the pipe wall can be greater than 1  mm (Brauer 1963; Shook et al. 2002). The roughness is produced primarily through contact between the <b>viscous</b> oil <b>coating</b> and the turbulent water layer that flows over the film while lubricating the oil core. The result is a rippled/rough wall that is associated with very large hydrodynamic roughness values (Brauer 1963; Picologlou et al. 1980; Shook et al. 2002). While the presence of the coating reduces somewhat the cross-sectional area available for flow, which also causes an increase in pressure loss for a given throughput, the increased hydrodynamic roughness plays a much more important role in this increase.|$|R
30|$|In water-lubricated {{pipeline}} transportation of heavy oil and bitumen, a thin oil film typically coats the pipe wall. A {{detailed study of}} the hydrodynamic effects of this fouling layer {{is critical to the}} design and operation of oil–water pipelines, as it can increase the pipeline pressure loss (and pumping power requirements) by 15 times or more. In this study, a parametric investigation of the hydrodynamic effects caused by the wall <b>coating</b> of <b>viscous</b> oil was conducted. A custom-built rectangular flow cell was used. A validated CFD-based procedure was used to determine the hydrodynamic roughness from the measured pressure losses. A similar procedure was followed for a set of pipe loop tests. The effects of the thickness of the oil coating layer, the oil viscosity, and water flow rate on the hydrodynamic roughness were evaluated. Oil viscosities from 3 to 21300  Pa s were tested. The results show that the equivalent hydrodynamic roughness produced by a wall <b>coating</b> layer of <b>viscous</b> oil is dependent on the coating thickness but essentially independent of oil viscosity. A new correlation was developed using these data to predict the hydrodynamic roughness for flow conditions in which a <b>viscous</b> oil <b>coating</b> is produced on the pipe wall.|$|R
40|$|We study a Newtonian <b>viscous</b> liquid <b>coating</b> a {{vertical}} rotating disk in the creeping flow regime. Experiments were performed at varying disk rotation speeds and liquid volumes, and the thickness profile at steady state was measured. While the maximum liquid {{supported by the}} rotating disk varied with rotation rate and liquid viscosity, the numerical value of a dimensionless number signifying the ratio of gravity to viscous forces was the same in all the cases, gamma = 0. 30. A lubrication analysis for the time evolution of the film thickness that accounted for gravity, surface tension, and viscous forces was solved numerically to steady state. The predicted thickness profiles are in quantitative agreement with those obtained experimentally. The lubrication equation at steady state was solved analytically {{in the absence of}} surface tension to obtain constant height contours that were circular and symmetric about the horizontal axis. However to obtain a complete solution, knowledge of the height variation across the contours is required, and this is controlled by the surface tension. On including this effect, we derived an asymptotic solution to predict thickness profiles that agree well with measurements for large values of viscosity or rotation rates. c 2009 [doi: 10. 1063 / 1. 3250858...|$|R
40|$|New {{mechanisms}} are discovered regarding {{the effects of}} inertia in the transient Moffatt–Pukhnachov problem (J. Méc., vol. 187, 1977, pp. 651 – 673) {{on the evolution of}} the free surface of a <b>viscous</b> film <b>coating</b> the exterior of a rotating horizontal cylinder. Assuming two-dimensional evolution of the film thickness (i. e. neglecting variation in the axial direction), a multiple-timescale procedure is used to obtain explicitly parameterized high-order asymptotic approximations of solutions of the spatio-temporal evolution equation. Novel, hitherto-unexplained transitions from stability to instability are observed as inertia is increased. In particular, a critical Reynolds number Rec is predicted at which occurs a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation in wave amplitude that is fully explained by the new asymptotic theory. For Re Rec, stable temporally periodic solutions with leading-order amplitudes proportional to. Re Rec/ 1 = 2 are found, i. e. in the régime in which previous related literature predicts exponentially divergent instability. For ReDRec, stable solutions are found that decay algebraically to a steady state. A model solution is proposed that not only captures qualitatively the interaction between fundamental and higher-order wave modes but also offers an explanation for the formation of the lobes observed in Moffatt’s original experiments. All asymptotic theory is convincingly corroborated by numerical integrations that are spectrally accurate in space and eighth/ninth-order accurate in time...|$|R

Suspension of cells in media deficient in calcium results in abortive encystment {{characterized by the}} release of <b>viscous</b> cyst <b>coat</b> material. Mature cysts rupture in ethylene glycol-bis-(beta-aminoethyl ether) -N,N'-tetraacetic acid, suggesting that calcium is a structural component of the cyst coat. Maximal stimulation of encystment by calcium ions occurs prior to {{the completion of the}} cyst exine or outer coat. The uronic acid composition of cyst components is dependent on calcium levels in the medium. Uronic acids account for 31. 7 percent of the intine (inner coat) and 13 percent of the exine dry weight, and only mannuronic and guluronic acids are present in these fractions. These can be extracted as homo- and heteropolymeric sequence "blocks" characteristic of alginic acids. The polyuronic acid fraction of both the cyst coats contain approximately equal amounts of heteropolymeric (mannuronic acid/guluronic acid) blocks. The exine, however, is richer in polyguluronic acid and the intine is richer in polymannuronic acid. As a result, the mannuronic acid/guluronic acid ratio of the exine is lower than that of the intine. Slimes that form in abortive encystment are rich in polymannuronic acid and have a high mannuronic acid/guluronic acid ratio.

When we compared the air entrainment speeds on both sides, we found a switch in behaviour at a critical viscosity. At viscosity lower than a critical value, the rough side entrained air at lower speeds than the smooth side. Above the critical viscosity the reverse was observed, the smooth side entraining air at lower speed than the rough side. Only substrates with significant roughness showed this behaviour. Below a critical roughness, the rough side always entrained air at lower speeds than the smooth side. These results have both fundamental and practical merits.

These forces form the fluid layer into an array of discrete droplets separated by an ultra thin layer. However, the droplet array is unstable, and the droplets will interact with one another. To determine the structure and properties of steady droplets, we use the Reynolds’ PDE in one dimension and phase-plane methods. We can then analyze the unstable droplet system by utilizing paired ODEs.

40|$|YesThis study {{examines}} experimentally {{and for the}} first time the effect of reduced air pressure on dynamic wetting. The purpose is to assess the role of air viscosity on dynamic wetting failure which hitherto has been speculated on but not measured. In this paper we used dip coating as the model experimental flow and report data on air entrainment velocity Vae we measured with a series of silicone oils in a range of viscosities in a vacuum chamber where the pressure can be reduced from atmospheric down to a few mbar when the mean molecular free path of air is large and air ceases to have a viscosity. To complement earlier work, we carried out the experiments with a range of substrates of varying roughness. The substrates were chosen so that for each one, their two sides differ in roughness. This enables simultaneous comparative observation of their wetting performance and reduces the experimental error in assessing the role of roughness. The data presented here capture the effects of viscosity, roughness and air pressure but the important result of this study is that Vae can be increased considerably (exponentially) when the pressure is reduced with the suggestion that Vae approaches infinity as pressure approaches zero. In other words, the role of the surrounding air viscosity is important in dynamic wetting. The data from this study have significant implication to the fundamental understanding of dynamic wetting. Indeed they form the missing data link to fully understand this phenomenon. The data presented in this work also confirm the complex role of roughness, in that it can increase or decrease the air entrainment speed depending on the value on the viscosity of the coating solution. The results presented in this paper are very useful in practice as they imply that if one chooses carefully roughness one can <b>coat</b> <b>viscous</b> formulation at unexpectedly very high speeds with a moderate vacuum (50 mbar typically) ...|$|R
