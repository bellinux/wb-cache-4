500|$|Kilburn's next project, {{known as}} Atlas, aimed {{to create a}} fast {{computer}} by making maximum use of existing and new technologies. The project was backed by Ferranti and a £300,000 grant from the National Research Development Corporation. It incorporated numerous technologies and techniques such as [...] "multiprogramming, job scheduling, spooling, interrupts, pipelining, interleaved storage, autonomous transfer units, <b>virtual</b> <b>storage</b> and paging – though none of these techniques had been invented when the project started in 1956." [...] Other innovations included read only memory and a compiler-compiler. The greatest innovation was virtual memory, which allowed the drum storage {{to be treated as}} if it were core. Three of them were built, and installed at Manchester University, the University of London and the Rutherford Laboratory.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} 1958 Ferranti {{agreed to}} {{collaborate}} with Manchester University on the project, and the computer was shortly afterwards renamed Atlas, with the joint venture {{under the control of}} Tom Kilburn. The first Atlas was officially commissioned on 7 December 1962, and was considered at that time to be the most powerful computer in the world, equivalent to four IBM 7094s. It was said that whenever Atlas went offline half of the UK's computer capacity was lost. Its fastest instructions took 1.59 microseconds to execute, and the machine's use of <b>virtual</b> <b>storage</b> and paging allowed each concurrent user to have up to one million words of storage space available. Atlas pioneered many hardware and software concepts still in common use today including the Atlas Supervisor, [...] "considered {{by many to be the}} first recognisable modern operating system".|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{traditional}} filesystems which reside on single {{devices and}} thus require a volume manager {{to use more}} than one device, ZFS filesystems are built on top of <b>virtual</b> <b>storage</b> pools called zpools. A zpool is constructed of virtual devices (vdevs), themselves constructed of block devices: Files, hard drive partitions, or entire drives, with the latter being the recommended usage. Block devices within a vdev may be configured in different ways, depending on needs and space available: non-redundantly (similar to RAID 0), as a mirror (RAID 1) {{of two or more}} devices, as a RAID-Z group of three or more devices, or as a RAID-Z2 (similar to RAID-6) group of four or more devices. In July 2009, triple-parity RAID-Z3 was added to OpenSolaris. [...] RAID-Z is a data-protection technology featured by ZFS {{in order to reduce the}} [...] block overhead in mirroring.|$|E

More precisely, the <b>virtual</b> server <b>storage</b> requirements in our scheme are reduced {{by a factor of}} more than 80 compared to the original scheme. Further, memory requirements for the mobile client are reduced by a factor of more than 130.

40|$|Many {{operating}} systems are endowed {{with the ability}} to access every byte of addressable memory in the processor complex. Unfortunately, a control program so designed creates an exposure of the following nature: It is possible for an errant section of operating system code to unwittingly modify (and perhaps destroy) either its own storage or the storage of others. This thesis addresses this problem and discusses the design and implementation of a control program in which many such attempts at destroying storage are detected and suppressed. This is accomplished by placing separate control program functions in separate <b>virtual</b> <b>storages.</b> The thesis also expounds upon the notions of protection and security within the operating system itself, and details a quasi capability mechanism that regulates the access to shared objects and ensures the invocation of one control program function by another is authorized...|$|R
