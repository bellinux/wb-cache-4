40|$|A common print quality {{problem in}} {{electrophotographic}} (EP) printing is ghosting. Ghosting {{refers to a}} <b>vestigial</b> <b>image</b> repeated at regular intervals {{down the length of}} a page and appearing as light or dark areas (negative or positive ghosting, respectively) relative to the surrounding field. There are many sources of ghosting, including most EP printer subsystems and many of their components. Subsystems from charging, development, photoreceptor, to fusing can all produce ghosting. The ghosts can be both positive and negative (darker and lighter). Having multiple ghosting sources can make the sources of ghosting difficult to determine, pointing to the need for reliable diagnostic tools. This paper demonstrates how a commercially-available image analysis system is used to quantify ghosting and diagnose its causes. The system utilizes test targets specifically designed to reveal ghosting problems and are optimized for automated inspection. The analysis method uses frequency domain techniques that make it possible to isolate ghosting from other print quality problems. The method can also correlate observed ghosting to the printer component or components causing it. In addition to its role in R&D, the method is suitable for production environments as a quantitative tool for setting acceptance limits and performing quality control prior to shipping the product...|$|E
40|$|Through {{discussion}} of {{my experience with}} Yuquí community members in Bolivia, I reflect upon a widespread phenomenon: when people with limited options resort to the sale of their culture for their economic survival. There is substantial literature that supports that indigenous peoples can influence the representations of themselves communicated through artisanry or touristic products {{in such a way}} that is self-asserting; however, the Yuquí case demonstrates that such representational control may not always be possible. The image that Yuquí crafts communicate is of an archaic, <b>vestigial</b> people, an <b>image</b> that the Yuquí do not esteem. Although it is an invalid and incomplete image of the Yuquí that the artisanry conveys, the Yuquí sell it out of economic necessity. Anthropology, with its long-standing study of remote, indigenous peoples, tends to authenticate this partial and exoticized image and in this way can be a discomfiting accomplice in its promotion and sale. By helping indigenous research consultants articulate more complete self-images through their cultural commodities [...] images that they can actually relate and identify with [...] perhaps anthropologists can help indigenous peoples participate in their cultural commodification in ways that return to them their human dignity...|$|R
