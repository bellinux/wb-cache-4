40|$|The authors {{present a}} new class of surface-enhanced Raman {{scattering}} (SERS) substrates based on lithographically-defined two-dimensional rectangular array of nanopillars. Two types of nanopillars within this class are discussed: <b>vertical</b> <b>pillars</b> and tapered <b>pillars.</b> For the <b>vertical</b> <b>pillars,</b> the gap between each pair of nanopillars is small enough (< 50 nm) such that highly confined plasmonic cavity resonances are supported between the pillars when light is incident upon them, and the anti-nodes of these resonances act as three-dimensional hotspots for SERS. For the tapered pillars, SERS enhancement arises from the nanofocusing effect due to the sharp tip on top. SERS experiments were carried out on these substrates using various concentrations of 1, 2 bis-(4 -pyridyl) -ethylene (BPE), benzenethiol (BT) monolayer and toluene vapor. The results show that SERS enhancement factor of over 0. 5 x 10 {sup 9 } can be achieved, and BPE can be detected down to femto-molar concentration level. The results also show promising potential for the use of these substrates in environmental monitoring of gases and vapors such as volatile organic compounds...|$|R

50|$|A light pillar, or sun pillar, {{appears as}} a <b>vertical</b> <b>pillar</b> or column of light rising from the sun near sunset or sunrise, though it can appear below the sun, {{particularly}} if the observer is at a high elevation or altitude.

40|$|We {{explore the}} thesis that tall {{structures}} can be protected by means of seismic metamaterials. Seismic metamaterials can be built as some elements are created over soil layer with different shapes, dimensions, patterns and from different materials. Resonances in these elements are acting as locally resonant metamaterials for Rayleigh surface waves in the geophysics context. Analytically we proved that if we put infinite chain of SDOF resonator over the soil layer as an elastic, homogeneous and isotropic material, vertical component of Rayleigh wave, longitudinal resonance of oscillators will couple with each other, they would create a Rayleigh bandgap frequency, and wave will experience attenuation before it reaches the structure. As {{it is impossible to}} use infinite chain of resonators over soil layer, we considered finite number of resonators throughout our simulations. Analytical work is interpreted using finite element simulations that demonstrates the observed attenuation is due to bandgaps when oscillators are arranged at sub-wavelength scale with respect to the incident Rayleigh wave. For wavelength less than 5 meters, the resulting bandgaps are remarkably large and strongly attenuating when impedance of oscillators matches impedance of soil. Since longitudinal resonance of SDOF resonator are proportional to its length inversely, a formed array of resonators that attenuates Rayleigh waves at frequency ≤ 10 Hz could be designed starting from <b>vertical</b> <b>pillars</b> coupled to the ground. Optimum number of <b>vertical</b> <b>pillars</b> and their interval spacing called effective area of resonators are investigated. For 10 pillars with effective area of 1 meter and resonance frequency of 4. 9 Hz, bandgap frequency causes attenuation and a sinusoidal impulsive force illustrate wave steering down phenomena.

40|$|Through-silicon via (TSV) {{is a high}} {{performance}} interconnect technology and a new facet of advanced memory packaging which seeks to vastly improve memory density and efficiency.
