40|$|The {{location}} of a body's center of mass, and its moments and products of inertia about various axes are important physical quantities needed for any type of dynamic simulation or physical based modeling. We present an algorithm for automatically computing these quantities for a general class of rigid bodies: those composed of uniform density polyhedra. The mass integrals may be converted into <b>volume</b> <b>integrals</b> under these assumptions, and {{the bulk of the}} paper is devoted to the computation of these <b>volume</b> <b>integrals.</b> Our algorithm is based on a three step reduction of the <b>volume</b> <b>integrals</b> to successively simpler integrals. The algorithm is designed to minimize the numerical errors that can result from poorly conditioned alignment of polyhedral faces. It is also designed for efficiency. All required <b>volume</b> <b>integrals</b> of a polyhedron are computed together during a single walk over the boundary of the polyhedron; exploiting common subexpressions reduces floating point operations.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} use of low-discrepancy {{sequences}} for computing <b>volume</b> <b>integrals</b> in geometric modelling. An introduction to low-discrepancy point sequences is presented which explains {{how they can be}} used to replace random points in Monte Carlo methods. The relative advantages of using low-discrepancy methods compared to random point sequences are discussed theoretically, and then practical results are given for a series of test objects which clearly demonstrate the superiority of the low-discrepancy method. Low-Discrepancy Sequences Monte Carlo methods of integration are used widely for calculating <b>volume</b> <b>integrals</b> in solid modelling. The Monte Carlo method uses randomly generated points inside a box enclosing an object of interest to calculate <b>volume</b> <b>integrals.</b> For example, the volume of the object can be estimated as the ratio of number of points that are contained within the object to the total number of points generated, multiplied by the volume of the box.

But for a planar aperture radiating into a lossless homogeneous medium it is shown that the only physically observable part of the <b>volume</b> <b>integrals</b> is twice that produced in the invisible region of the pattern space factor by those field components that vanish in the plane outside of the aperture. The inductive and capacitive reactive powers corresponding to the observable parts (W,) and (We), respectively, of the <b>volume</b> <b>integrals</b> {{are found to be}} given by the following integrals over the invisible region ky*+k 2 > k 2, for an arbitrary aperture consisting of holes in a conducting plane.

40|$|For non-homogeneous or {{non-linear}} problems, a major {{difficulty in}} applying the boundary element method (BEM) is {{the treatment of}} the <b>volume</b> <b>integrals</b> that arise. An accurate scheme that requires no volume discretization is highly desirable. In this paper, we describe an efficient approach, based on the precorrected-FFT technique, for the evaluation of <b>volume</b> <b>integrals</b> resulting from non-homogeneous linear problems. In this approach, the 3 -D uniform grid constructed initially to accelerate surface integration is used as the baseline mesh for the evaluation of <b>volume</b> <b>integrals.</b> As such, no volume discretization of the interior problem domain is necessary. Moreover, with the uniform 3 -D grid, the matrix sparsification techniques (such as the precorrected-FFT technique used in this work) can be extended to accelerate volume integration in addition to surface integration, thus greatly reducing the computational time. The accuracy and efficiency of our approach are demonstrated through several examples. A 3 -D accelerated BEM solver for Poisson equations has been developed and has been applied to a 3 -D multiply-connected problem with complex geometries. Good agreement between simulation results and analytical solutions has been obtained. Copyright � 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
