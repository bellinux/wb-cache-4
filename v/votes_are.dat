5|$|As 91 <b>votes</b> <b>are</b> {{needed to}} elect the Governor from the 180-member body and Democrats and Progressives held 112 seats, it was {{considered}} unlikely that Milne would win. Milne argued that legislators should decide the election in line with how their individual districts voted. Neal Goswami of the Vermont Press Bureau calculated that if each legislator voted according to the results in their district, the vote {{would result in a}} 90–90 tie. Milne disagreed with this calculation and claimed voting according to district outcome would result in his winning 93–87.|$|E
5|$|As a result, the Election Commission would {{review the}} postal voting system where EC {{chairman}} Tan Sri Abdul Aziz Mohd Yusof {{said they would}} study the proposal to call for an early voting session for army personnel, policemen and EC staff instead of posting votes.

As in all other states except Maine and neighboring Nebraska, South Dakota's electoral <b>votes</b> <b>are</b> granted in a winner-take-all system.|$|E
5|$|The Council is {{composed}} of twenty-eight national ministers (one per state). However the Council meets in various forms depending upon the topic. For example, if agriculture is being discussed, the Council will be composed of each national minister for agriculture. They represent their governments and are accountable to their national political systems. <b>Votes</b> <b>are</b> taken either by majority or unanimity with votes allocated according to population. In these various forms they share the legislative and budgetary power of the Parliament, and also lead the Common Foreign and Security Policy.|$|E

5|$|A Dainty Politician is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film focuses on corruption political activity during a political convention in which a corrupt politician is running for re-election to the United States Congress. The <b>votes</b> <b>are</b> tallied and the challenger ties with the corrupt Congressman Casey, but a third candidate holds the balance of power. Casey bribes the third candidate to retire in his favor, but the plot is uncovered and the two are ejected from the convention by a reporter {{who falls in love}} with challenger's daughter. The film was released on August 23, 1910, and saw a wide national release. Little is known of the actual production, but it received mixed reaction for the plausibility of its plot. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|Any Croatian citizen {{over age}} 18 {{may be a}} {{candidate}} in presidential, parliamentary or local government elections, provided that {{a sufficient number of}} endorsements by Croatian voters is obtained beforehand. Croatian elections are relatively well-regulated; regulations include spending limits, annual donation limits, a limitation on the number of endorsed candidates and election lists and regulations governing media coverage. Voting takes place in polling stations in Croatia and abroad, monitored by an electoral board and observers at each station. Ballots consist of an alphabetical list of candidates, or an election list with ordinal numbers (which are circled to indicate a vote). All <b>votes</b> <b>are</b> counted by hand. The State Electoral Commission publishes official results and handles complaints, supported by county, city and town electoral commissions during local elections. Decisions of the electoral commissions may be appealed at the Constitutional Court of Croatia.|$|E
50|$|Swailes's {{surplus of}} 89 <b>votes</b> <b>was</b> not transferred, {{as it was}} too low to change the {{relevant}} candidate order. Juba's surplus of 57 <b>votes</b> <b>was</b> also not transferred, for the same reason. Murphy was eliminated, and her 1,991 <b>votes</b> <b>were</b> distributed as follows: St. John 1309, Scott 205, Stubbs 163. 314 <b>votes</b> <b>were</b> non-transferable. St. John was declared elected to the third position.|$|R

The threshold for making the ballot is 15% and the party announced that Baker had thus received the nomination {{without the need for}} a primary election. However, Fisher argued that according to the Convention Rules, blank <b>votes</b> <b>are</b> not counted for the purposes of determining the winner and that he thus received 15.148%, enough to make the ballot. He sued the Massachusetts Republican State Committee and was certified for the primary ballot after a lengthy battle. In the primary election held on September 9, Baker defeated Fisher with 74% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{approval}} of the federal Elective Governor Act by President Harry S Truman in 1947, the governor has been elected through a democratic process every four years since 1948. Under this system, the governor {{is in charge of the}} island's executive branch. In these elections, every person must vote for one of several candidates, each one of which represents a political party (currently consisting of the New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico, Puerto Rican Independence Party, Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico and Puerto Ricans for Puerto Rico Party) following the elective process the <b>votes</b> <b>are</b> counted and the candidate who gathers the plurality (not majority) of votes is certified as governor-elect and takes office on January 2 of the following year in a public inaugural ceremony which may be preceded by a private oath-taking ceremony.|$|E

5|$|Should {{the office}} of {{governor}} become vacant, the lieutenant governor becomes governor, followed in order of succession by the Secretary of State and the Attorney General. Prior to the current constitution, {{the duties of the}} office would devolve upon the lieutenant governor, without that person actually becoming governor. The term begins at noon on January 1 of the year following the election. Prior to the 1963 constitution, the governor and lieutenant governor were elected through separate votes, allowing them to be from different parties. In 1963, this was changed, so that <b>votes</b> <b>are</b> cast jointly for a governor and lieutenant governor of the same party.|$|E
5|$|The {{colored people}} did not intrude {{themselves}} upon us; they were brought here in chains and held in communities {{where they are now}} chiefly bound by a cruel slave code...when and under what conditions is the black man to have a free ballot? When is he in fact to have those full civil rights which have so long been his in law? When is that quality of influence which our form of government was intended to secure to the electors to be restored? … in many parts of our country where the colored population is large the people of that race are by various devices deprived of any effective exercise of their political rights and of many of their civil rights. The wrong does not expend itself upon those whose <b>votes</b> <b>are</b> suppressed. Every constituency in the Union is wronged.|$|E
5|$|Elections {{are governed}} by the State Electoral Commission and electoral boards. Members of those bodies are {{required}} to have a university degree in law, {{and they may not}} be members of any political party. The State Electoral Commission prepares and manages elections in accordance with legislation, appoints lower-ranking election-commission and board members, issues directives to such bodies and supervises their work. The State Electoral Commission compiles and publishes candidate lists, supervises the legality of political campaigns and compiles and publishes election results. All members of election boards (or their legal deputies) must be present at assigned polling stations at all times while the polling station is open. The board verifies the identity of voters against the list of registered voters and records the turnout. The turnout number is later checked against number of votes cast; if the number of votes exceeds the turnout, the election at that polling station must be repeated. <b>Votes</b> <b>are</b> tallied by hand, and that information is forwarded (along with all other records kept at the polling station) to the State Electoral Commission.|$|E

5|$|Navarro stated, on 21 August 2010, {{that the}} case was stagnating because an {{official}} interpreter was unable to be found for the case in Peru. The Peruvian association of translators and interpreters and the Dutch embassy both separately stated {{at the time that}} they have been unable to locate one to officially translate Spanish into Dutch. Unlike Aruba and the United States, Peru does not guarantee the right to a speedy trial. On 6 September, a Peruvian appeals court voted 2 to 1 to reject Van der Sloot's motion that he is being unlawfully held. Because 3 <b>votes</b> <b>are</b> required for a decision, if a fourth judge voted in Van der Sloot's favor, a fifth judge would be required to break the tie. Peruvian statutes permit a suspect to be detained for up to 18 months for interrogation, though Navarro expressed skepticism that law enforcement officers would do so with his client.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} eight {{members of}} the parliament are elected from the twelfth constituency. It encompasses the entire country; candidates in this constituency are elected by voters belonging to 22 recognized minorities in Croatia: the Serb minority elects three MPs, the Hungarians and Italians elect one MP each, the Czech and Slovak minorities jointly elect one MP, and all other minorities elect the final two MPs. Minority MPs are elected by simple plurality system (candidates with the most number of <b>votes</b> <b>are</b> elected). The nationality of the voters is listed in the voter registry, which {{is provided by the}} registrar's office that maintains Croatia's vital records. Voter nationalities are normally officially declared by the parents at birth, but any citizen may declare or change that information later on at the registrar's office at least 14 days ahead of elections (not at the polling station). The voter's nationality need not be declared or may be declared as unknown. During elections, voters who have officially declared they belong to one of the recognized minorities in Croatia may choose to vote for either a territorially applicable list or a corresponding national minority list; a voter of unknown or non-declared nationality may vote for either a territorially applicable list or any minority list; a voter who has declared a nationality other than Croat or a recognized minority may vote only for a territorially applicable list (the same as someone who has declared themselves a Croat).|$|E
