5|$|Some older {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that statin therapy might reduce <b>vasospasm,</b> but a subsequent meta-analysis including further trials did not demonstrate benefit on either <b>vasospasm</b> or outcomes. While corticosteroids with mineralocorticoid activity may help prevent <b>vasospasm</b> their use does not appear to change outcomes.|$|E
5|$|Management {{involves}} {{general measures}} {{to stabilize the}} person while also using specific investigations and treatments. These include the prevention of rebleeding by obliterating the bleeding source, prevention of a phenomenon known as <b>vasospasm,</b> and prevention and treatment of complications.|$|E
5|$|The first {{surgical}} {{intervention was}} performed by Norman Dott, who was a pupil of Harvey Cushing then working in Edinburgh. He introduced the wrapping of aneurysms in the 1930s, and was an early pioneer {{in the use of}} angiograms. American neurosurgeon Dr Walter Dandy, working in Baltimore, was the first to introduce clips in 1938. Microsurgery was applied to aneurysm treatment in 1972 in order to further improve outcomes. The 1980s saw the introduction of triple H therapy as a treatment for delayed ischemia due to <b>vasospasm,</b> and trials with nimodipine in an attempt to prevent this complication. In 1983, the Russian neurosurgeon Zubkov and colleagues reported the first use of transluminal balloon angioplasty for <b>vasospasm</b> after aneurysmal SAH. The Italian neurosurgeon Dr. Guido Guglielmi introduced his endovascular coil treatment in 1991.|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose—Vasospasms of {{the spiral}} modiolar artery may cause an ischemic stroke {{of the inner}} ear that manifests itself by a sudden hearing loss. Previously we have shown that endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) induces <b>vasospasms</b> of the spiral modiolar artery. Here we tested the {{hypotheses}} that ET- 1 –induced <b>vasospasms</b> are (1) reversible by ETA receptor antagonists; (2) mediated by a Ca 2 sensitization of the contractile apparatus via a Rho-kinase–induced inhibition of myosin light chain phosphatase; and (3) reversible by the vasodilator calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP). Methods—The Ca 2 sensitivity of the contractile apparatus was evaluated by correlation between the smooth muscle cell Ca 2 concentration and the vascular diameter, which were measured by microfluorometry with the fluorescent dye fluo- 4 and videomicroscopy, respectively. Results—ET- 1 –induced <b>vasospasms</b> were prevented but not reversed by the ETA receptor antagonists BQ- 123 and BMS- 182874. The Ca 2 sensitivity of the contractile apparatus was increased by ET- 1 and by inhibition of myosin light chain phosphatase with calyculin A and was decreased by CGRP. ET- 1 –induced <b>vasospasms</b> and Ca 2 sensitization were prevented and reversed by the Rho-kinase antagonist Y- 27632 and by CGRP. Conclusions—ET- 1 induces <b>vasospasms</b> of the spiral modiolar artery via ETA receptor–mediated activation of Rho-kinase, inhibition of myosin light chain phosphatase, {{and an increase in}} Ca 2 sensitivity, which is reversed by CGRP.

40|$|<b>Vasospasms</b> of the {{intracranial}} arteries are {{a well-known}} complication of subarachnoid hemorrhage {{and are also}} frequently encountered in other disorders such as migraine, cerebral vasculitis or reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome. In contrast, recurrent spontaneous <b>vasospasms</b> of the extracranial circulation appear to be extremely rare and have most often been associated with migraine. We present a patient with recurrent strokes due to spontaneous transient vasospastic occlusions of the internal carotid artery (ICA) without migraine over a time period of at least 13 years. Initially, the patient had presented with a bilateral ICA occlusion and a cerebral infarct on the right side. While the right ICA remained occluded, a reopening of the left ICA could be detected 3 days after this initial event. In subsequent years, both duplex sonography and magnetic resonance angiography revealed recurrent occlusions of the left ICA, which resolved spontaneously within days. This case and other rare previous reports indicate that recurrent non-migrainous <b>vasospasms</b> of the extracranial carotid artery likely reflect a distinct entity which can cause ischemic strokes...|$|R
50|$|Endovascular Neurosurgery utilize {{endovascular}} image guided {{procedures for}} the treatment of aneurysms, AVMs, carotid stenosis, strokes, and spinal malformations, and <b>vasospasms.</b> Techniques such as angioplasty, stenting, clot retrieval, embolization, and diagnostic angiography are endovascular procedures.|$|R
5|$|Treatment is by prompt {{neurosurgery}} or radiologically guided interventions. Medications such as labetalol may {{be required}} to lower the blood pressure until repair can occur. Efforts to treat fevers are also recommended. Nimodipine, a calcium channel blocker, is frequently used to prevent <b>vasospasm.</b> Routine use medications to prevent further seizures is of unclear benefit. Nearly half of people with a SAH due to an underlying aneurysm die within 30 days and about a third who survive have ongoing problems. 10–15 percent die before reaching a hospital.|$|E
5|$|People {{with poor}} {{clinical}} grade on admission, acute neurologic deterioration, or progressive enlargement of ventricles on CT scan are, in general, indications for {{the placement of}} an external ventricular drain by a neurosurgeon. The external ventricular drain may be inserted at the bedside or in the operating room. In either case, strict aseptic technique must be maintained during insertion. In people with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage the EVD is used to remove cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and blood byproducts that increase intracranial pressure and may increase the risk for cerebral <b>vasospasm.</b>|$|E
5|$|The use {{of calcium}} channel blockers, {{thought to be}} able to prevent the spasm of blood vessels by {{preventing}} calcium from entering smooth muscle cells, has been proposed for prevention. The calcium channel blocker nimodipine when taken by mouth improves outcome if given between the fourth and twenty-first day after the bleeding, even if it does not reduce the amount of <b>vasospasm</b> detected on angiography. In traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, nimodipine does not affect long-term outcome, and is not recommended. Other calcium channel blockers and magnesium sulfate have been studied, but are not presently recommended; neither is there any evidence that shows benefit if nimodipine is given intravenously.|$|E
40|$|A b s t r a c t <b>Vasospasms</b> {{occur in}} 30 % of {{patients}} after subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). The most severe spasms are {{in patients with}} Hunt and Hess IV and V, who have usually much blood in the basal cisterns. According to some reports, hypothermia could decrease the incidence and severity of vasos-pasms in these patients. We have analysed 15 patients (HH IV and V) after SAH from a ruptured intracranial aneurysm. In 8 patients the aneurysm was embolised during the first 4 days, 3 patients were operated on because of intraparenchymal haematoma and their aneurysm was clipped, the other 4 patients were initially treated conservatively. In all patients mild hypothermia (34 °C for 72 hours) had been started imme-diately after their admission by means of cooling blankets. Monitoring of ICP (intraventricular), CPP and jugular bulb oxymetry was instituted and everyday TCD examination was performed. Results – ICP, CPP and jugular bulb oxymetry were maintained in the normal range in all patients. In 11 patients, however, severe <b>vasospasms</b> with infarctions on the CT scan occurred (during days 5 and 16 after SAH). TCD showed increased velocities only in 6 of these patients. Ten patients with <b>vasospasms</b> died within 6 months after SAH. One patient remained vegetative, 1 severely disabled, and 3 had a good outcome (2 of them had intraparenchymal haematoma). Hypothermia applied immediately after SAH {{does not seem to}} decrease either the incidence or the severity of <b>vasospasms</b> in HH IV and V patients after SAH. K e y w o r d...|$|R
5|$|If the {{symptoms}} of delayed ischemia do not improve with medical treatment, angiography may be attempted to identify the sites of <b>vasospasms</b> and administer vasodilator medication (drugs that relax the blood vessel wall) directly into the artery. Angioplasty (opening the constricted area with a balloon) may also be performed.|$|R
2500|$|If HG is inadequately treated, anemia, hyponatremia, Wernicke's encephalopathy, kidney failure, central pontine myelinolysis, coagulopathy, atrophy, Mallory-Weiss tears, hypoglycemia, jaundice, malnutrition, pneumomediastinum, rhabdomyolysis, deconditioning, deep vein thrombosis, {{pulmonary}} embolism, splenic avulsion, or <b>vasospasms</b> of cerebral arteries {{are possible}} consequences. Depression and PTSD [...] are common secondary complications of HG {{and emotional support}} can be beneficial.|$|R
5|$|Complications are {{distinct}} medical problems that may arise {{as a result}} of the TBI. The results of traumatic brain injury vary widely in type and duration; they include physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral complications. TBI can cause prolonged or permanent effects on consciousness, such as coma, brain death, persistent vegetative state (in which patients are unable to achieve a state of alertness to interact with their surroundings), and minimally conscious state (in which patients show minimal signs of being aware of self or environment). Lying still for long periods can cause complications including pressure sores, pneumonia or other infections, progressive multiple organ failure, and deep venous thrombosis, which can cause pulmonary embolism. Infections that can follow skull fractures and penetrating injuries include meningitis and abscesses. Complications involving the blood vessels include <b>vasospasm,</b> in which vessels constrict and restrict blood flow, the formation of aneurysms, in which the side of a vessel weakens and balloons out, and stroke.|$|E
5|$|SAH {{is often}} {{associated}} with a poor outcome. The death rate (mortality) for SAH is between 40 and 50 percent, but trends for survival are improving. Of those that survive hospitalization, more than a quarter have significant restrictions in their lifestyle, and less than a fifth have no residual symptoms whatsoever. Delay in diagnosis of minor SAH (mistaking the sudden headache for migraine) contributes to poor outcome. Factors found on admission that are associated with poorer outcome include poorer neurological grade; systolic hypertension; a previous diagnosis of heart attack or SAH; liver disease; more blood and larger aneurysm on the initial CT scan; location of an aneurysm in the posterior circulation; and higher age. Factors that carry a worse prognosis during the hospital stay include occurrence of delayed ischemia resulting from <b>vasospasm,</b> development of intracerebral hematoma, or intraventricular hemorrhage (bleeding into the ventricles of the brain) and presence of fever on the eighthday of admission.|$|E
25|$|<b>Vasospasm,</b> {{referring}} to blood vessel constriction, can occur secondary to subarachnoid hemorrhage following a ruptured aneurysm. This {{is most likely}} to occur within 21 days and is seen radiologically within 60% of such patients. The <b>vasospasm</b> is thought to be secondary to the apoptosis of inflammatory cells such as macrophages and neutrophils that become trapped in the subarachnoid space. These cells initially invade the subarachnoid space from the circulation in order to phagocytose the hemorrhaged red blood cells. Following apoptosis, it is thought there is a massive degranulation of vasoconstrictors, including endothelins and free radicals, that cause the <b>vasospasm.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The precise {{mechanism}} of acrocyanosis is not known. The current {{line of thinking}} goes that <b>vasospasms</b> in the cutaneous arteries and arterioles produce cyanotic discoloration, while compensatory dilatation in the postcapillary venules causes sweating. Arteriovenous subpapillary plexus shunting also occurs. [...] Persistent vasoconstriction at the precapillary sphincter creates a local hypoxic environment, thus releasing adenosine into the capillary bed. <b>Vasospasms</b> force adenosine to enter the capillary bed, where it vasodilates the postcapillary venules. Such differences in vessel tone create a countercurrent exchange system that attempts to retain heat. Profuse sweating would then be caused by an overwhelmed countercurrent exchange system. In addition to adenosine, other hormones may contribute to acrocyanosis such as increase blood levels of serotonin. This would seem to support case studies reporting acrocyanosis as an unusual side effect for pediatric patients taking tricyclic antidepressants, as these medications can inhibit the reuptake of serotonin and thus increase their blood concentrations. Acrocyanosis {{has been reported in}} association with many other medications and substances.|$|R

25|$|Rebleeding, {{hydrocephalus}} (the excessive {{accumulation of}} cerebrospinal fluid), <b>vasospasm</b> (spasm, or narrowing, {{of the blood}} vessels), or multiple aneurysms may also occur.

5000|$|For over 100 years <b>vasospasms</b> are known, {{particularly}} in the vessels supplying the retina of the eye with blood. These <b>vasospasms</b> are temporary narrowings of arteries or arterioles, which result in an insufficient supply of blood of the corresponding organs or parts of organs. Such spasms can occur at various locations in the human body; in this case medical terminology calls it [...] "vasospastic syndrome". Over the years, it has been established that these spasms are usually {{part of a general}} dysregulation of blood vessels. These dysregulations can occur in spasms as well as in excessive or insufficient dilation of arteries, veins, and capillaries. The blood vessels of individuals suffering from vasospastic syndrome respond to stimuli insufficiently. If an identifiable disease does not cause this, it is called a primary vascular dysregulation (PVD); in case of an underlying disease it is called secondary PVD. PVD is almost always associated with other vascular and non-vascular symptoms and signs. This entire complex (PVD and accompanying symptoms) is today called Flammer syndrome.|$|R

40|$|Background. Tacrolimus-associated {{encephalopathy}} (TAC-E) {{is usually}} described under {{the term of}} posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). However, {{a large amount of}} data has suggested that TAC-E is not a homogenous entity: indeed, TAC-E which is often presented with atypical and potentially misleading imaging characteristics does not always correspond to PRES. Objective. We aimed to identify the spectrum of brain MR imaging of TAC-E and discuss the underlying pathophysiological features. Methods. From September 2008 to October 2010, the neurological statuses of 45 patients, who underwent lung transplantation with TAC as posttransplantation immunosuppressive therapy, were regularly assessed in a prospective study. MRI was repeatedly performed, until recovery, in patients who developed central neurological symptoms. Results. Symptoms suggestive of encephalopathy occurred in five out of 45 patients (11. 1 %). According to our MRI study, two patients presented with reversible bilateral and relatively symmetric subcortical white matter edema with proximal <b>vasospasms</b> on MRA; however, three other patients were characterized by coexistence of two different lesions including laminar cortical infarcts with hemorrhagic transformation not typically found in PRES and reversible deep white matter edema, associated with distal <b>vasospasms</b> on MRA.

On arrival, her heart rate was 125 beats/min and her systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 70 mmHg. A repeated electrocardiogram displayed dynamic changes with ST-segment elevation in D 1 -aVL leads and ST-segment depression in infero-posterior leads.

500|$|<b>Vasospasm,</b> {{in which}} the blood vessels constrict and thus {{restrict}} blood flow, is a serious complication of SAH. It can cause ischemic brain injury (referred to as [...] "delayed ischemia") and permanent brain damage {{due to lack of}} oxygen in parts of the brain. It can be fatal if severe. Delayed ischemia is characterized by new neurological symptoms, and can be confirmed by transcranial Doppler or cerebral angiography. About one third of all people admitted with subarachnoid hemorrhage will have delayed ischemia, and half of those have permanent damage as a result. It is possible to screen for the development of <b>vasospasm</b> with transcranial Doppler every 24–48hours.

40|$|BackgroundThe right gastroepiploic artery {{is useful}} as an in situ {{arterial}} graft for {{coronary artery bypass}} grafting. However, the gastroepiploic artery {{is more likely to}} cause <b>vasospasms</b> compared with the internal thoracic artery. We hypothesized that the cause of the spasms is the stimulation of the periarterial sympathetic nerve, because the gastroepiploic artery is classified as a muscular artery. In this study, we examined whether the spasm is reduced by removing the periarterial sympathetic nerve. MethodsUnused parts of the gastroepiploic artery were obtained from patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting. The vessel was cut into 2 segments, and they were assigned to control (N+) and denervation (N−) groups. The periarterial nerve was microscopically removed from the vessels of the N− group. The vessels in both groups were investigated by hematoxylin–eosin or immunohistochemical staining, and they were stimulated by electrical field stimulation with serial frequency for isometric tension measurement. ResultsHistologic analyses revealed that periarterial connective tissues including neuropeptide Y were removed to expose the external elastic membrane in the N− vessel, whereas they were preserved in N+. The mean contraction by electrical field stimulation with serial frequency was consistently lower in N− than in N+ (P < . 05 at 20 and 50 Hz; n =  8 each). Endothelium-dependent relaxation and contractile function of the smooth muscle were similar in both groups. ConclusionsThe removal of the periarterial sympathetic nerve from the human gastroepiploic artery reduced vascular contraction, elicited by peripheral nerve stimulation, without disturbing endothelial and smooth muscle contractile functions.
