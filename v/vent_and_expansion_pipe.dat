40|$|Development of {{industries}} needs expansion {{of public transportation}} and, consequently, heavy transportation increases hazardous and dangerous transportation too. Therefore, {{we need to consider}} some strategies to reduce bad effects of transportation of hazardous materials such as road accidents. Strength, Weakness, Opportunity and Treats (SWOT) analysis is an applicable method for designing strategies in this area. However, SWOT analysis does not provide specific strategies and it does not consider the efficiency and performance of each strategy. Applying a hybrid method of analyzing the strategies and their performance evaluation help decision makers select the best strategies based on the current limitations. In this paper, different strategies for hazardous transportation risk reduction are designed and relative efficiencies of all alternatives are compared using DEA method. The proposed model of this paper uses three inputs including implementation costs, operation and maintenance cost and operational and four outputs including accident rate reduction, fuel consumption reduction, employment rate increment and deaths number reduction. The results of the implementation using seven different strategies have yielded two important strategies including continuous improvement of vehicle standards, driving skills, transportation system quality, and loading methods <b>and</b> <b>expansion</b> of petroleum <b>pipe</b> network...|$|R
40|$|Upon {{their initial}} discovery, {{hydrothermal}} <b>vents</b> <b>and</b> methane seeps {{were considered to}} be related but distinct ecosystems, with different distributions, geomorphology, temperatures, geochemical properties and mostly different species. However, subsequently discovered <b>vents</b> <b>and</b> seep systems have blurred this distinction. Here, we report on a composite, hydrothermal seep ecosystem at a subducting seamount on the convergent Costa Rica margin that represents an intermediate between <b>vent</b> <b>and</b> seep ecosystems. Diffuse flow of shimmering, warm fluids with high methane concentrations supports a mixture of microbes, animal species, assemblages and trophic pathways with <b>vent</b> <b>and</b> seep affinities.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{limitations}} to understanding the evolutionary history of hydrothermal <b>vents</b> <b>and</b> cold seep communities is the identification of tube fossils from ancient deposits. Tube-dwelling annelids {{are some of the}} most conspicuous inhabitants of modern <b>vent</b> <b>and</b> seep ecosystems, <b>and</b> ancient <b>vent</b> <b>and</b> seep tubular fossils are usually considered to have been made by annelids. However, the taxonomic affinities of many tube fossils from <b>vents</b> <b>and</b> seeps are contentious, or have remained largely undetermined due to difficulties in identification. In this study, we employ a detailed chemical (FTIR and pyrolysis gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry) and morphological assessment of modern annelid tubes from six families, and fossil tubes (seven tube types from the Cenozoic, 12 Mesozoic, and four Palaeozoic) from hydrothermal <b>vent</b> <b>and</b> cold seep environments. Characters identified from the above investigations were used to, for the first time, explore the systematics of ancient <b>vent</b> <b>and</b> seep tubes within a cladistic framework. Results reveal details of the compositions and ultrastructure of modern tubes, and also suggest that two types of tubes from ancient vent localities were made by the annelid family Siboglinidae which often dominates modern <b>vents</b> <b>and</b> seeps. Our results also highlight that many <b>vent</b> <b>and</b> seep tube fossils formerly thought to be annelids cannot be assigned an annelid affiliation with any certainty. The findings overall improve the level of quality control with regard to interpretations of fossil tubes, and most importantly, suggest that siboglinids likely occupied Mesozoic <b>vents</b> <b>and</b> seeps, greatly increasing the minimum age of the clade relative to earlier molecular estimates...|$|R
40|$|Problems {{with the}} {{identification}} of tubular fossils from ancient hydrothermal <b>vent</b> <b>and</b> cold seep deposits have hindered understanding of the evolutionary history of <b>vent</b> <b>and</b> seep communities. This thesis aims to (1) improve knowledge of lesser-studied tubicolous annelids occupying <b>vents</b> <b>and</b> seeps, (2) study the diversity of tubes at <b>vents</b> <b>and</b> seeps, (3) investigate the fossilisation of tubes within modern <b>vents</b> <b>and</b> seeps, (4) better interpret the fossil record, and (5) provide insights into the palaeoecology these environments. Results presented here on investigations of Sclerolinum contortum, a species belonging to a little- studied genus of the major vent/seep dwelling annelid family Siboglinidae, demonstrate that it exhibits tube morphological plasticity, wide habitat preferences and a global distribution spanning the Arctic to the Southern Ocean. These results also suggest that this species has dispersed throughout this range using chemosynthetic habitats as stepping stones. A detailed investigation of the full mineralisation process of Alvinella (Alvinellidae) tubes at modern hydrothermal vents shows that these tubes are fossilised by pyrite and silica that template organic tube layers, and that microorganisms living on tube surfaces are also exceptionally well-preserved alongside the tubes. No known ancient vent tube fossils resemble mineralised Alvinella tubes. A major morphological and compositional comparison of both modern and fossil tubes from <b>vents</b> <b>and</b> seeps revealed that two fossil tube types from the Mesozoic were likely made by vestimentiferans (Siboglinidae), suggesting that this major <b>vent</b> <b>and</b> seep annelid lineage has a longer history within <b>vents</b> <b>and</b> seeps than proposed by molecular clock age estimates. This analysis also demonstrates the need for greater caution in assigning affinities to fossil <b>vent</b> <b>and</b> seep tubes. Finally, this thesis reports the remarkable preservation of filamentous microorganisms {{on the walls of}} Silurian vent tube fossils, giving the first insights into ecological associations between microbes and metazoans within the oldest known hydrothermal vent community...|$|R
