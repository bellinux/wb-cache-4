The condensing flue gas heat recovery system, designed and manufactured by John Thurley Ltd., {{has been in}} operation at the Winnipeg Packinghouse Plant since the summer of 1982. It is capable of recovering about {{four times as much}} heat as conventional systems, such as economizers and combustion air preheaters. This is due to its ability to recover latent heat by condensing the flue gas water vapour, and to recover a greater portion of the sensible heat. As a result, the exit flue gas temperature is reduced to about 30 C. The heat recovery system is capable of heating water to about 60 C, thus it is ideally suited to operations which require large quantities of hot water, At Winnipeg the pre-heated water is used for processing, sanitation and boiler make-up. The rendering <b>vapour</b> heat <b>recovery</b> system, in operation at the Moose Jaw Packinghouse Plant since December 1982, recovers previously lost waste heat produced by four batch inedible rendering cookers. The vapour, which has the properties of atmospheric saturated steam, is used to preheat city water to about 65 C, by means of a spiral heat exchanger. The preheated water is heated to the process temperature using steam...|$|R

40|$|There is a {{need for}} simple, {{sensitive}} and stable electronic sensors suited for Volatile organic compound (VOC) detection in a wide spectrum of applications ranging from lab-on-a-chip to environmental monitoring, as opposed to the often employed expensive, bulky and complicated instrumental methods. The need for inexpensive, low-power, fast recovery and repeatable use sensors is fuelling the large increase of research in this area. Silicone rubber has better heat resistance, electric conductivity and chemical stability comparing to ordinary organic rubbers. These are properties why silicon rubber is promising matrix material for VOC sensors. Highly structured nanocarbon black has been used as nanofiller material. Homogenous composite mixture of nanofiller and silicone rubber was coated on crystalline glass-ceramic with aluminum electrodes by dip coating method. Composites were cross-linked in different condition by, changing pressure, temperature and atmosphere. Crosslinking time was maintained constant. During crosslinking the composite electrical resistance was measured as indicator of composite system electric network formation. After curing the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to evaluate chemical bond changes, which could approve that crosslinking reactions are completed. Relative electrical resistance change of silicon rubber composites was measured, when the composite samples were exposed to different concentrations of non-polar toluene <b>vapours.</b> Fast <b>recovery</b> of the composite electrical resistance has been noticed, when the composite is removed from exposure source...|$|R

Diesels do not require such a system because the fuel is not volatile, so the cdi was certified instead. Demand was initially heavy, with up to six-month waiting lists in major urban areas in the spring of 2005. 10,242 cdi cars were imported in model years 2005 and 2006.

50|$|Membrane {{separation}} processes operate without {{heating and}} therefore use less energy than conventional thermal separation {{processes such as}} distillation, sublimation or crystallization. The separation process is purely physical and both fractions (permeate and retentate) can be used. Cold separation using membrane technology is widely used in the food technology, biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. Furthermore, using membranes enables separations to take place that would be impossible using thermal separation methods. For example, {{it is impossible to}} separate the constituents of azeotropic liquids or solutes which form isomorphic crystals by distillation or recrystallization but such separations can be achieved using membrane technology. Depending on the type of membrane, the selective separation of certain individual substances or substance mixtures is possible. Important technical applications include the production of drinking water by reverse osmosis (worldwide approximately 7 million cubic metres annually), filtrations in the food industry, the recovery of organic vapours such as petro-chemical <b>vapour</b> <b>recovery</b> and the electrolysis for chlorine production.|$|E

Regulations have not been developed for the CHOPS method of oil sands production being used by Baytex. That is why Baytex is not technically violating any laws by open venting its bitumen processing tanks. Because emissions from these tanks are known to cause health effects and affect air quality other companies like Penn West Petroleum use fully closed <b>vapour</b> <b>recovery</b> systems. [...] Baytex has chosen not to expend the money installing these systems on the 86 super-heated oil sands processing tanks in the area despite reporting a record 200% {{rate of return on}} investment. A return rate that Baytex claims is one of the highest for any oil project in North America. The Alberta Government has expressed serious concerns about what Baytex is doing and has taken the unprecedented step of not only not allowing Baytex any new well licences in the area and but has also convened a public inquiry. Yet Baytex continues to produce in open vented tanks and several families remain out of their homes. There are broader concerns about what Baytex's actions may do to harm the reputation of Alberta's oil sands production {{at a time when the}} Canadian government is trying to reassure its trading partners that oil sands are produced in an environmentally safe and socially responsible manner.|$|E

HQ 50 and HQ 95 > 1 were obtained with benzene in the scenario for service station attendants and mechanics repairing petrol dispensing pumps indicating a possible health risk. The risk was minimized for service stations using <b>vapour</b> <b>recovery</b> systems which greatly reduced the benzene exposure levels. HQ 50 and HQ 95 < 1 were obtained for all other scenarios with benzene suggesting minimal risk {{for most of the}} exposed population.

40|$|An {{extensive}} {{search and}} screening of published articles {{was conducted to}} identify what outcomes have been observed in previously investigated occupational road safety initiatives. A search of six electronic bibliographic databases identified 181 non-duplicated titles relating to occupational road safety interventions. These titles were reviewed using pre-determined inclusion/exclusion criteria. This review process generated a total of 20 peer-reviewed relevant articles that collectively assessed the effectiveness of 19 occupational road safety initiatives. Initiatives found to be positively associated with occupational road safety during the intervention period were: policy development; a web-based risk management tool; awareness and information campaigns; goal setting; performance feedback; self-monitoring forms; signing safety pledge cards; alco lock devices; fatigue management technology devices; in-vehicle compensatory devices to target ability deficiencies of older commercial drivers; in-car data recorders; and gasoline <b>vapour</b> <b>recovery</b> devices. Only six initiatives {{were found to be}} positively associated with occupational road safety both during and after the intervention period. These were: a pay rise; driver training; group discussions; enlisting employees as community road safety change agents; safety reminders; and group and individual rewards. The findings from this paper will assist safety practitioners in making informed decisions when developing risk management strategies. The authors suggest that practitioners consider initiative effectiveness, cost and involvement level when selecting and designing interventions...|$|E

40|$|Measurements {{and model}} {{developments}} {{with the objective}} {{to improve the quality}} and resolution of estimations of anthropogenic emissions are described. Measurement results on a chassis dynamometer were used to determine VOC profiles for exhaust gas emissions of passenger cars for different vehicle and fuel types and different driving modes. Further measurements resulted in emission factors and VOC profiles for lignite burning in residential stoves. Using remote sensing techniques benzene emission factors of gas stations and the efficiency of gasoline <b>vapour</b> <b>recovery</b> systems were measured. To improve the quality and the spatial and temporal resolution of emission data, emission models were improved or modified. This was done by elaborating and applying new methods for important emission source categories (e. g., solvent use, road traffic, small combustion) as well as including new data sources in the calculation routines (e. g. emission statements, land use data, import/export indices of solvents). Simultaneously considerable progress was made improving temporal and spatial allocation functions and VOC profiles. With these improvements a large number of anthropogenic emission data sets for 14 different grid projections in Germany and Europe have been generated. An emission scenario for Germany for 2010 suggests that considering air quality directives from the EU and Germany which are in force or in pipeline, German emissions of VOC and NOx will decrease, but still exceed the national emission ceilings of the EU-NEC directive...|$|E
40|$|During refuelling, {{people may}} easily {{be exposed to}} {{extremely}} high levels of gasoline vapour for a short time, although such exposure takes on more importance {{in the case of}} service station attendants. The volume of gasoline sold in refuelling operations and the ambient temperature can significantly increase the environmental level of benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX) vapours and, subsequently, the occupational risk of service station attendants. This is especially true in the case of benzene, the most important component of gasoline vapours from a toxicological point of view. The European Directive 98 / 70 /EC, limiting the benzene composition of gasoline, and 94 / 63 /EC, concerning the use of <b>vapour</b> <b>recovery</b> systems in the delivery of gasoline to services stations, were applied in Spain from January 2000 and 2002, respectively. In addition, a new limit value for occupational exposure of 3. 25 mg/m 3 was fixed for benzene in Directive 97 / 42 /EC, applied from June 2003. However, recent years have seen the growing use of diesel as well as of unleaded and reformulated gasoline. In this study, we analyse the differences found between air concentration levels of BTXs in 2000 and 2003, analysing samples taken from the personal breathing-zone of occupationally exposed workers in service stations.

40|$|Abstract. A {{combined}} {{monitoring and}} dispersion modelling methodology {{was applied for}} assessing air quality related to concentration levels of benzene, toluene and xylenes (BTX) at three different levels of proximity to a petrol selected service Station: (I) next to the füel pumps, (II) in the surrounding environment, and (III) m the background. A Gaussian dispersion model (CALINE 4) was used for assessing the road traffic contribution to the local concentrarions under different meteorological conditions. It was established that Stage 2 <b>vapour</b> <b>recovery</b> reduces BTX concentrarions not only near the pumps but also in their surrounding environment. However, {{there is evidence that}} the efficiency of the System is wind speed dependent. The modelling Simulation of the worst case wind scenario revealed the significance of local traffic emissions. It was shown that the traffic contribution to the local BTX levels even from a single road {{in the vicinity of the}} Station can be, under certain conditions, higher than the contribution of the Station itself. Finally, after comparison with previous studies, the concentrations measured near the service Station (which was situated in a rural environment) appear to be lower than those observed in busy street canyons in city centres. It can be concluded that although Stage 2 recovery System effectively reduces working VOC losses in service stations, it will only have a limited positive impact on local air quality if the service Station is located in a heavily polluted area...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to design, construct, test and operate a novel circulating fluid bed fast pyrolysis reactor system for production of liquids from biomass. The novelty lies in incorporating an integral char combustor to provide autothermal operation. A reactor design methodology was devised which correlated input parameters to process variables, namely temperature, heat transfer and gas/vapour residence time, for both the char combustor and biomass pyrolyser. From this methodology a CFB reactor was designed with integral char combustion for 10 kg/h biomass throughput. A full-scale cold model of the CFB unit was constructed and tested to derive suitable hydrodynamic relationships and performance constraints. Early difficulties encountered with poor solids circulation and inefficient product recovery were overcome {{by a series of}} modifications. A total of 11 runs in a pyrolysis mode were carried out with a maximum total liquids yield of 61. 50 % wt on a maf biomass basis, obtained at 500 °C and with 0. 46 s gas/vapour residence time. This could be improved by improved <b>vapour</b> <b>recovery</b> by direct quenching up to an anticipated 75 % wt on a moisture-and-ash-free biomass basis. The reactor provides a very high specific throughput of 1. 12 - 1. 48 kg/hm 2 and the lowest gas-to-feed ratio of 1. 3 - 1. 9 kg gas/kg feed compared to other fast pyrolysis processes based on pneumatic reactors and has a good scale-up potential. These features should provide significant capital cost reduction. Results to date suggest that the process is limited by the extent of char combustion. Future work will address resizing of the char combustor to increase overall system capacity, improvement in solid separation and substantially better liquid recovery. Extended testing will provide better evaluation of steady state operation and provide data for process simulation and reactor modeling...|$|E
40|$|Petrol station attendants’ {{exposure}} to gasoline vapours while refuelling vehicles has raised health concerns, especially in tropical countries like Saudi Arabia. This {{is due to}} the increase of gasoline vaporisation by the high temperatures and related weather conditions. This represents an increase risk of inhaling more vapours than its counterpart temperate countries. Furthermore, exposure during extended working hours (12 hrs shifts), with no <b>vapour</b> <b>recovery</b> system and the handling of gasoline containing a high percentage of volumes of toxic substances (e. g. BTEXs) have not been adequately addressed previously in Saudi Arabia. Therefore, this study was designed and carried out to investigate the validity of this concern by assessing and quantifying full shift exposures to gasoline vapours during the petrol filling process. Different exposure assessment methodologies were employed and evaluated for their suitability. The study assessed the exposures of 41 attendants via passive, active, and direct reading methods at twelve petrol stations with both high and low sales in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. The study was conducted during the winter and summer months to test the seasonal variation of the pattern of exposure. The effects of the quantity of gasoline sold, the locations of the stations, weather variations (e. g. wind speed, temperature, and humidity) were tested. A purpose built mini-weather stations and modified thermometres were utilized to accurately monitor the prevailing weather conditions. Forward-looking infrared (FLIR) thermal image cameras were utilised to visualise the size and movement behaviour of the vapour plumes during petrol refuelling. Furthermore, analytical lab trials were carried out to characterise the gasoline vapour component under different temperatures. These were used to propose a new OEL. The geometric means of the personal passive results for BTEX and MTBE (0. 18 ppm, 0. 24 ppm, 0. 09 ppm, 0. 18 ppm, 1. 57 ppm, respectively) were found to be relatively higher than those reported previously for Europe and North America. These results are discussed {{in the context of the}} impact that such exposure will have on people involved in this industry in petrol stations in Saudi Arabia...|$|E
40|$|The European {{legislation}} {{concerning the}} abolition of polluting substances made it necessary for Italy {{to be compliant with}} other Countries standards. These other Countries have been much more organized and have had all the instruments and plans required to eliminate polluting substances created by man work. The analysis for a <b>vapour</b> <b>recovery</b> unit (VRU) is a clear example of how oil companies always try to have an economical feed back even when forced by the law to act in a certain way. Italy started facing the issue of recovering vapours only after the introduction, on the market, of lead-free petrol. This kind of petrol contains a wide variety of additives and aromatic substances among which is benzene, that coul all be potentially dangerous for human health. The issues of benzene and industrial pollution have been faced in a confusing and approssimate way. At first the approach was to impose very strict regulation and to apply it in a very short time, later on the approach changed. The law was meant to help different subjects to be compliant with the requirements and to tolerate possible delays. The Italian legislation should have followed the European guidelines in the subject, but never specified the approach that had to be taken and the deadlines that had to be respected. In this case we can talk both of a legislative confusion and of a general misunderstanding on the production level. The Italian oil industry has two very different and important aspects to it. On one hand there are small-medium sized producers that still aren’t compliant with the laws. Most of the times this producers are not really interested in respecting the directives or they try to postpone the expences necessary for being compliant. On the other hand, the big companies have earned experience {{with the same kind of}} plants located abroad. Relying on this experience big companies have provided with getting technically advanced and idoneous plants.
