5|$|The {{reason for}} the rise of polio in industrialised {{countries}} in the 20th century has never been fully explained. The disease {{is caused by a}} virus that is passed from person to person by the faecal-oral route, and naturally infects only humans. It is a paradox that it became a problem during times of improved sanitation and increasing affluence. Although the <b>virus</b> <b>was</b> discovered {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, its ubiquity was unrecognised until the 1950s. It is now known that fewer than two per cent of individuals who are infected develop the disease, and most infections are mild. During epidemics the <b>virus</b> <b>was</b> effectively everywhere, which explains why public health officials were unable to isolate a source.|$|E
5|$|A {{mammalian}} virus, {{the rabbit}} haemorrhagic disease <b>virus</b> <b>was</b> introduced to Australia {{to attempt to}} control the European rabbit populations there. It escaped from quarantine and spread across the country, killing large numbers of rabbits. Very young animals survived, passing immunity to their offspring in due course and eventually producing a virus-resistant population. Introduction into New Zealand in the 1990s was similarly successful at first, but a decade later, immunity had developed and populations had returned to pre-RHD levels.|$|E
5|$|Earlier {{hypotheses}} of the epidemic's origin have varied. Some hypothesized the flu {{originated in}} East Asia. Dr. C. Hannoun, leading expert of the 1918 flu for the Institut Pasteur, asserted the former <b>virus</b> <b>was</b> {{likely to have}} come from China, mutating in the United States near Boston and spreading to Brest, France, Europe's battlefields, Europe, and the world using Allied soldiers and sailors as main spreaders. He considered several other hypotheses of origin, such as Spain, Kansas, and Brest, as being possible, but not likely.|$|E
25|$|Plant <b>viruses</b> <b>are</b> <b>viruses</b> {{that affect}} plants. Like all other <b>viruses,</b> plant <b>viruses</b> <b>are</b> obligate {{intracellular}} parasites {{that do not}} have the molecular machinery to replicate without a host. Plant <b>viruses</b> <b>are</b> pathogenic to higher plants.|$|R
50|$|<b>Virus</b> <b>is</b> {{transmitted}} by arthropods, by insects {{of the order}} Hemiptera, family Aphididae; Aphis craccivora, Myzus persicae. The principal natural vector(s) <b>are</b> Myzus persicae. <b>Virus</b> <b>is</b> not {{transmitted by}} Aphis gossypii, Macrosiphum euphorbiae. <b>Virus</b> <b>is</b> transmitted in a non-persistent manner.|$|R
40|$|The {{immunological}} {{relationships among}} three hamster-specific sarcoma viruses and a non-sarcomagenic <b>virus</b> <b>were</b> d t rmined by neutralization a d interference tests. These <b>viruses</b> <b>were</b> all derived from hamster tumours induced originally by murine sarcoma <b>viruses</b> but <b>were</b> no longer capable of growth on mouse cells. The four viruses shared {{at least one}} envelope antigen responsible for neutralization reactions. Specific interference for the sarcoma <b>viruses</b> <b>was</b> obtained in cultures infected with the non-sarcomagenic v rus. In both assays these <b>viruses</b> <b>were</b> clearly distinguishable from murine C-type viruses...|$|R
5|$|In 1957 {{another new}} {{strain of the}} virus emerged and caused a {{pandemic}} of Asian flu; although the <b>virus</b> <b>was</b> not as virulent as the 1918 strain, over one million died worldwide. The next pandemic occurred when Hong Kong flu emerged in 1968, a new strain of the virus that replaced the 1957 strain. Affecting mainly the elderly, the 1968 pandemic was the least severe, but 33,800 {{were killed in the}} US. New strains of influenza virus often originate in East Asia; in rural China the concentration of ducks, pigs, and humans in close proximity is the highest in the world.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, it was {{determined}} that the rhesus monkey kidney cells used to prepare the poliovirus vaccines were infected with the SV40 virus (Simian Virus-40). SV40 was also discovered in 1960 and is a naturally occurring virus that infects monkeys. In 1961, SV40 was found to cause tumors in rodents. More recently, the <b>virus</b> <b>was</b> found in certain forms of cancer in humans, for instance brain and bone tumors, pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma, and some types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. However, it has not been determined that SV40 causes these cancers.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Eckard Wimmer's {{group at}} SUNY Stony Brook succeeded in synthesizing {{poliovirus}} from its chemical code, producing the world's first synthetic virus. Scientists first converted poliovirus's published RNA sequence, 7741 bases long, into a DNA sequence, as DNA {{was easier to}} synthesize. Short fragments of this DNA sequence were obtained by mail-order, and assembled. The complete viral genome was then assembled by a gene synthesis company. This whole painstaking process took two years. Nineteen markers were incorporated into the synthesized DNA, {{so that it could}} be distinguished from natural poliovirus. Enzymes were used to convert the DNA back into RNA, its natural state. Other enzymes were then used to translate the RNA into a polypeptide, producing functional viral particle. The newly minted synthetic <b>virus</b> <b>was</b> injected into PVR transgenic mice, to determine if the synthetic version was able to cause disease. The synthetic <b>virus</b> <b>was</b> able to replicate, infect, and cause paralysis or death in mice. However, the synthetic version was between 1/1,000th and 1/10,000th as lethal as the original virus.|$|E
50|$|Mosaic <b>viruses</b> <b>are</b> plant <b>viruses</b> {{that cause}} the leaves to have a {{speckled}} appearance. Mosaic <b>virus</b> <b>is</b> not a taxon.|$|R
40|$|A {{recombinant}} RNA <b>virus</b> <b>is</b> provided allowing encapsidation {{of genetically}} engineered viral sequences in heterologous, preferably rod-shaped coat, protein capsids. Since icosahedral <b>viruses</b> <b>are</b> limited {{in the amount of}} RNA they can carry, and rod-shaped <b>viruses</b> <b>are</b> expansible, this invention allows the size of recombinant virus RNA components to be increased (or decreased). Methods of making and using such recombinant <b>viruses</b> <b>are</b> also provided, specifically with respect to the transfection of plants to bring about genotypic and phenotypic changes...|$|R

5|$|Past {{academics}} of {{the university}} include, Patricia Broadfoot, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Gloucestershire, Nigel Thrift, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Warwick, and Wendy Larner, Provost of Victoria University of Wellington. Anthony Epstein, co-discoverer of the Epstein-Barr <b>virus,</b> <b>was</b> Professor of Pathology at the university from 1968â€“1982., Sir John Lennard-Jones, discoverer of the Lennard-Jones potential in physics and Alfred Marshall, one of the University College's principals and influential economist {{in the latter part}} of the 19th century. Mathematicians and philosophers Rohit Parikh and Brian Rotman lectured in the mathematics department, and philosopher of science Paul Feyerabend taught in the Department of Philosophy.|$|E
5|$|Playa de Oro <b>virus</b> <b>was</b> {{identified}} as a new species in 2008 and is most closely related to Bayou virus, Catacamas virus, Muleshoe virus, and Black Creek Canal virus, found in other species of Oryzomys and Sigmodon. Catacamas virus is found in a different population of Oryzomys couesi, {{and the presence of}} different viruses in these two species has been used as an argument for classifying the two populations of the host as separate species.|$|E
5|$|The first {{candidate}} polio vaccine, {{based on}} one serotype of a live but attenuated (weakened) <b>virus,</b> <b>was</b> developed by the virologist Hilary Koprowski. Koprowski's prototype vaccine was given to an eight-year-old boy on 27 February 1950. Koprowski continued {{to work on the}} vaccine throughout the 1950s, leading to large-scale trials in the then Belgian Congo and the vaccination of seven million children in Poland against serotypes PV1 and PV3 between 1958 and 1960.|$|E

5|$|The first {{images of}} viruses were {{obtained}} upon {{the invention of}} electron microscopy in 1931 by the German engineers Ernst Ruska and Max Knoll. In 1935, American biochemist and virologist Wendell Meredith Stanley examined the tobacco mosaic virus and found it was mostly made of protein. A short time later, this <b>virus</b> <b>was</b> separated into protein and RNA parts.|$|E
5|$|The {{tobacco mosaic}} <b>virus</b> <b>was</b> {{the first to}} be {{crystallised}} and its structure could therefore be elucidated in detail. The first X-ray diffraction pictures of the crystallised virus were obtained by Bernal and Fankuchen in 1941. On the basis of her pictures, Rosalind Franklin discovered the full structure of the virus in 1955. In the same year, Heinz Fraenkel-Conrat and Robley Williams showed that purified tobacco mosaic virus RNA and its protein coat can assemble by themselves to form functional viruses, suggesting that this simple mechanism was probably the means through which viruses were created within their host cells.|$|E
5|$|As {{the head}} of research, Kaspersky {{authored}} papers on viruses and went to conferences to promote the software. He was often quoted in the technology press as an antivirus expert. He helped establish the company's Global Research and Expert Analysis Team (GReAT), which helps corporations and governments investigate IT security threats. Initially he told his team not to discuss cyber-terrorism publicly, to avoid giving governments {{ideas on how to}} sabotage their political opponents. After the American film Live Free or Die Hard (AKA Die Hard 4.0) (2007) was released, Kaspersky said the idea was now public. He hired the researcher that identified the Stuxnet worm, which {{is believed to be the}} first instance of state-sponsored cyberweapon. Afterwards, the company exposed the Flame virus at the request of the International Telecommunication Union. The <b>virus</b> <b>was</b> believed to have been used for cyber-espionage in Middle-Eastern countries.|$|E

40|$|When mouse {{fibroblasts}} {{transformed by}} SV 40 <b>virus</b> <b>are</b> fused with African Green Monkey kidney cells about 5 % of the heterokaryons produce infective SV 40 virus. If the transformed mouse cells {{are treated with}} iododeoxyuridine before fusion, the percentage of heterokaryons producing SV 40 <b>virus</b> <b>is</b> increased to between 50 and 80 %; if the transformed cells are treated with 8 -azaguanine, the percentage of heterokaryons yielding <b>virus</b> <b>is</b> increased to between 59 % and 96 %. This shows that whether the SV 40 <b>virus</b> can <b>be</b> detected by cell fusion depends {{on the state of}} the transformed cells beforehand. A new method for titrating SV 40 <b>virus</b> <b>is</b> described...|$|R
5|$|EEHV1A (originally just {{known as}} EEHV1) {{was the first}} species/type identified, which causes an acute hemorrhagic disease with a very high {{mortality}} rate in Asian elephants. This form of the <b>virus</b> <b>was</b> originally believed to occur naturally in African elephants (occasionally producing skin nodules), and to be transmitted to Asian elephants within captivity, but more extensive studies have since largely disproved this concept because several other species/types of EEHV (e.g. EEHV2, EEHV3 and EEHV6) instead {{have been identified in}} African elephants. A second lethal subtype, EEHV1B, was identified in Asian elephants in 2001. EEHV3, EEHV4 and EEHV5 have also each been {{responsible for the deaths of}} at least one Asian elephant calf.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, {{historian}} Mark Humphries of Canada's Memorial University of Newfoundland {{stated that}} newly unearthed records confirmed {{that one of}} the side stories of the war, the mobilization of 96,000 Chinese laborers to work behind the British and French lines on World War I's western front, might have been the source of the pandemic. In the report, Humphries found archival evidence that a respiratory illness that struck northern China in November 1917 was identified a year later by Chinese health officials as identical to the Spanish flu. However, a report published in 2016 in the Journal of the Chinese Medical Association found no evidence that the 1918 <b>virus</b> <b>was</b> imported to Europe from Chinese and Southeast Asian soldiers and workers. In fact, it found evidence that the virus had been circulating in the European armies for months and potentially years before the 1918 pandemic.|$|E
5|$|In April 2004, Farmer {{announced}} {{the formation of}} a committee to study the effectiveness of state owned and operated farmer's markets. In June 2005, he was elected secretary of the Southern Association of State Departments of Agriculture; in 2007, he was elected president of the organization. Farmer also sought to prevent an outbreak of vesicular stomatitis virus in the state's horses and cattle by banning the import of animals from 20 western counties where the <b>virus</b> <b>was</b> known to have infected animals. On Farmer's advice, Governor Ernie Fletcher requested that the United States Department of Agriculture designate Kentucky as an agricultural disaster area after an April 2007 cold snap devastated the state's fruit and wheat crops; the designation made Kentucky farmers eligible for low-interest federal loans to help compensate for their lost crop revenue.|$|E
50|$|<b>Viruses</b> that <b>are</b> {{associated}} with Entebbe Bat <b>Virus</b> <b>are</b> Sokolul <b>Virus</b> and Yokose Virus. Both of those <b>viruses</b> <b>are</b> categorized underneath the Entebbe Virus. Moreover, those two viruses {{do not have}} an arthropod vector as most of the viruses in the family Flaviviridae do.|$|R

50|$|Enteroviruses {{commonly}} infect neonates and infants {{younger than}} 12 months. Coxsackie b <b>viruses</b> <b>are</b> usually spread to infants through perinatal transmission. However, more severe cases of coxsackie B <b>viruses</b> <b>are</b> spread through transplacental transmission. Common symptoms of neonatal coxsackie B virus infection in children include meningitis and/or encephalitis. Coxsackie B4 <b>virus</b> <b>is</b> able to infect {{the brain and}} spinal cord and cause inflammation.|$|R
5|$|Many viruses can be {{synthesised}} de novo ("from scratch") and {{the first}} synthetic <b>virus</b> <b>was</b> created in 2002. Although somewhat of a misconception, {{it is not the}} actual virus that is synthesised, but rather its DNA genome (in case of a DNA virus), or a cDNA copy of its genome (in case of RNA viruses). For many virus families the naked synthetic DNA or RNA (once enzymatically converted back from the synthetic cDNA) is infectious when introduced into a cell. That is, they contain all the necessary information to produce new viruses. This technology is now being used to investigate novel vaccine strategies. The ability to synthesise viruses has far-reaching consequences, since viruses can no longer be regarded as extinct, as long as the information of their genome sequence is known and permissive cells are available. , the full-length genome sequences of 3843 different viruses, including smallpox, are publicly available in an online database maintained by the National Institutes of Health.|$|E
5|$|The {{second half}} of the 20th century was the golden age of virus {{discovery}} and most of the over 2,000 recognised species of animal, plant, and bacterial viruses were discovered during these years. In 1957, equine arterivirus and the cause of Bovine virus diarrhoea (a pestivirus) were discovered. In 1963, the hepatitis B <b>virus</b> <b>was</b> discovered by Baruch Blumberg, and in 1965, Howard Temin described the first retrovirus. Reverse transcriptase, the enzyme that retroviruses use to make DNA copies of their RNA, was first described in 1970, independently by Howard Martin Temin and David Baltimore. In 1983 Luc Montagnier's team at the Pasteur Institute in France, first isolated the retrovirus now called HIV. In 1989 Michael Houghton's team at Chiron Corporation discovered Hepatitis C.|$|E

A short time later, this <b>virus</b> <b>was</b> separated into protein and RNA parts. A problem for early scientists was {{that they did not know}} how to grow viruses without using live animals. The breakthrough came in 1931, when the American pathologist Ernest William Goodpasture and Alice Miles Woodruff grew influenza and several other viruses in fertilised chickens' eggs. Some viruses could not be grown in chickens' eggs, but this problem was solved in 1949 when John Franklin Enders, Thomas Huckle Weller and Frederick Chapman Robbins grew polio virus in cultures of living animal cells. Over 5,000 species of virus have been discovered.|$|E
