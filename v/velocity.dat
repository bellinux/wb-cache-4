5|$|The {{thickness}} of the <b>velocity</b> boundary layer is normally defined as {{the distance from the}} solid body to {{the point at which the}} viscous flow <b>velocity</b> is 99% of the freestream <b>velocity</b> (the surface <b>velocity</b> of an inviscid flow). Displacement Thickness is an alternative definition stating that the boundary layer represents a deficit in mass flow compared to inviscid flow with slip at the wall. It is the distance by which the wall would have to be displaced in the inviscid case to give the same total mass flow as the viscous case. The no-slip condition requires the flow <b>velocity</b> at the surface of a solid object be zero and the fluid temperature be equal to the temperature of the surface.
