5|$|In January 2011, {{the actor}} {{screened}} his multimedia project entitled Three's Company The Drama, {{in which he}} merges video and art to update the former sitcom, at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival. Franco reunited with Milk director <b>Van</b> <b>Sant</b> to make Unfinished, a project that features two movies: Endless Idaho and My Own Private River. Endless Idaho showcases edited outtakes, deleted scenes and behind-the-scenes footage from the 1991 movie My Own Private Idaho, while My Own Private River focuses on the late actor River Phoenix. The idea for the exhibition was conceived after <b>Van</b> <b>Sant</b> introduced unused footage from the 1991 film to Franco, inspiring him {{to turn it into}} something more. Unfinished opened from February 26 to April 9 at the Gagosian Gallery in Beverly Hills.|$|E
5|$|In September 1992, Joe Pytka {{announced}} that Warner Bros. held {{the option to}} create a live action film adaptation of the 1960s Japanese anime and manga series Speed Racer, in development at Silver Pictures. In October 1994, singer Henry Rollins was offered the role of Racer X. In June 1995, Johnny Depp was cast into the lead role for Speed Racer, with production slated to begin the coming October, with filming {{to take place in}} California and Arizona. The following August, Depp requested time off to the studio for personal business, delaying production. However, due to an overly high budget, the same August, director Julien Temple left the project. Depp, without a director, also departed from the project. The studio considered director Gus <b>Van</b> <b>Sant</b> as a replacement for Temple, though it would not grant writing privileges to <b>Van</b> <b>Sant.</b> In December 1997, the studio briefly hired Alfonso Cuarón as director. In the various incarnations of the project, screenwriters Marc Levin, Jennifer Flackett, J. J. Abrams, and Patrick Read Johnson had been hired to write scripts.|$|E

5|$|Tom Peterson (February 23, 1930– July 25, 2016) was an American retailer, pitchman, and {{television}} personality from Portland, Oregon. Peterson opened his first store in 1964, which grew to a regional consumer electronics, home appliance, and furniture chain in the 1970s. His memorable television commercials and unusual promotions {{made him a}} widely recognized personality in the Portland area by the 1980s, leading to several cameo appearances in the films of Gus <b>Van</b> <b>Sant.</b>|$|E

25|$|<b>Van</b> <b>Sant</b> {{originally}} {{wrote the}} screenplay in the 1970s, but discarded it after reading John Rechy's 1963 novel City of Night and concluding that Rechy's {{treatment of the}} subject of street hustlers was better than his own. Over the years, <b>Van</b> <b>Sant</b> rewrote the script, which comprised two stories: that of Mike {{and the search for}} his mother, and Scott's story as a modern update of the Henry IV plays. <b>Van</b> <b>Sant</b> had difficulty getting Hollywood financing, and at one point considered making the film on a minuscule budget with a cast of actual street kids. After <b>Van</b> <b>Sant</b> sent copies of his script to Reeves and then Reeves showed it to Phoenix, both agreed to star in the film on each other's behalf.|$|E
25|$|The {{origins of}} My Own Private Idaho came from John Rechy's 1963 novel, City of Night, which {{featured}} characters who were street hustlers {{who did not}} admit to being gay. Van Sant's original screenplay {{was written in the}} 1970s, when he was living in Hollywood. After reading Rechy's book, <b>Van</b> <b>Sant</b> realized that it was considerably better than what he was writing, so he shelved the script for years. In 1988, while editing Mala Noche, <b>Van</b> <b>Sant</b> met a street kid named Michael Parker who became a source of inspiration for the character of Mike in what would later become My Own Private Idaho. Parker also had a friend named Scott, a street kid like himself. In the script, <b>Van</b> <b>Sant</b> adapted the Scott character to that of a rich kid. The character of Scott was also fashioned after people <b>Van</b> <b>Sant</b> had met in Portland who were street hustlers.|$|E

25|$|Gus <b>Van</b> <b>Sant</b> was {{planning}} {{a version of}} Warhol's life with River Phoenix in the lead role just before Phoenix's death in 1993.|$|E
25|$|<b>Van</b> <b>Sant</b> {{faced the}} problem of casting the two central roles. He decided to send the script to the agents of Keanu Reeves and River Phoenix, {{figuring}} that their agents would reject the script.|$|E
25|$|<b>Van</b> <b>Sant</b> got {{an offer}} of $2 million from an outside {{investor}} but when he put off production for nine months so that Phoenix could make Dogfight, the investor and his money disappeared. Producer Laurie Parker shopped the script around and, at the time, New Line Cinema {{was in the process}} of branching out into producing arthouse films and decided to back Van Sant's vision with a USD$2.5 million budget. In an interview in March 2012, Kiefer Sutherland said that he declined the offer by Gus <b>Van</b> <b>Sant</b> to star in the lead role because he wanted to go skiing, a decision he has said he regrets.|$|E

50|$|<b>Van</b> <b>Sants</b> 1995 film To Die For {{helped to}} restore his luster. An {{adaptation}} of Joyce Maynards novel, the black comedy starred Nicole Kidman as a murderously ambitious weather girl; it also stars Matt Dillon as her hapless husband and, the third Phoenix sibling {{in as many}} projects, Joaquin Phoenix, as her equally hapless lover (River had died from a drug overdose a year and half earlier). It was <b>Van</b> <b>Sants</b> first effort for a major studio (Columbia), and its success {{paved the way for}} further projects of the directors choosing. The same year, he served as executive producer for Larry Clarks Kids; it was a fitting assignment, due to both the films subject matter and the fact that Clarks photographs of junkies had served as reference points for <b>Van</b> <b>Sants</b> Drugstore Cowboy.|$|R

25|$|Reeves' {{agent was}} {{amenable}} to the project, but Phoenix's agent {{would not even}} show the screenplay to the young actor. Not to be deterred, <b>Van</b> <b>Sant</b> {{got the idea for}} Reeves to personally deliver the film's treatment to Phoenix at his home in Florida. Reeves did so over the Christmas holidays, riding his 1974 Norton Commando motorcycle from his family home in Canada to the Phoenix family ranch in Micanopy, Florida, outside Gainesville. Reeves was no stranger to River Phoenix or members of his family, having worked previously with River on Lawrence Kasdan's I Love You to Death and with his brother Joaquin and girlfriend Martha Plimpton on Ron Howard's Parenthood. After reading the treatment, Phoenix agreed {{to play the role of}} Scott. However, since <b>Van</b> <b>Sant</b> had already cast Reeves in the role, they had to convince River to take on the edgier role of drug-addicted hustler Mike Waters. The director promised not to make either actor do anything embarrassing.|$|E

50|$|On February 24, 2014, a mashup of Alfred Hitchcock and Gus <b>Van</b> <b>Sant's</b> {{versions}} of Psycho appeared on Steven Soderbergh's Extension 765 website. Retitled Psychos and featuring no explanatory text, the recut {{appears to be}} a fan edit of the two films by Soderbergh. Reaction to the mashup appears to reinforce the prejudice against the 1998 film. The opening credits intermingle names from both the 1960 and 1998 versions, and all color has been removed from <b>Van</b> <b>Sant's</b> scenes.|$|R
