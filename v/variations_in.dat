Each gene specifies a particular trait with different sequence of a gene (alleles) giving rise to different phenotypes. Most eukaryotic organisms (such as the pea plants Mendel worked on) have two alleles for each trait, one inherited from each parent.|$|E

40|$|In this {{working paper}} we examine <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> {{financial}} performance, both across organizational form and through time. Because <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> financial performance may {{be driven by}} <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> productivity,we also examine <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> productivity, again across organizational form and through time. The organizational forms we consider are Spanish commercial banks, savings banks and financial cooperatives,and the time period is 1993 - 2004. We decompose multilateral <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> profit into price variation and quantity variation. We then decompose multilateral quantity variation into margin variation and productivity variation. Finally we decompose multilateral productivity <b>variation</b> into <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> technology, <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> cost efficiency and <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> scale. We find <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> financial performance across the three organizational forms, some of which is attributable to <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> productivity, although the nature of therelationship is sensitive to the financial performance indicator used. We also find that deregulation and liberalization have acted to narrow performance gaps among organizational forms. However evidence that the mechanism through which convergence has occurred is increased competition is not compelling. Productivity, profit, organizational form. ...|$|R

When the callosal region showing this association is used as a seed for probabilistic tractography, inter-hemispheric pathways are generated to the supplementary motor area and caudal cingulate motor area.
