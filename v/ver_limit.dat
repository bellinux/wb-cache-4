Extending a previous article dealing with Japanese transplant auto factories in the US, the authors examine impacts of alternative responses to the VER on the micro and macro level.

Redundancy within a sensor network can be exploited to rv uce the communication cost incurv 1 in execution of such quer ies. Anyr eduction in communication cost wouldr esult in an e#cient use of the batter y ener gy, which is <b>ver</b> y <b>limited</b> in sensor s. One appr oach to r educe the communication cost of a quer y is to self-or ganize the networ# inr esponse to a quer, into a topology that involves only a small subset of the sensor s su#cient to pr ocess the quer y. The quer y is then executed using only the sensor in the constr ucted topology. In thisar icle, we design and analyze algor thms for such self-or"/ 0 zation of asensor networ tor educe enerP consumption. In par icular we develop {{the notion of a}} connected sensor cover and design a centr alized appr oximation algor thm that constr ucts a topology in ol ing anear optimal connected sensor co er. We pr o e that the size of the const rst ed topology is within an O(log n) factor ofthe optimal size, wher n is the networ size.

Finally, we evaluate the distributed algorithm using simulations and show that our approach results in significant communication cost reduction...|$|R
40|$|Displacement {{spectral}} densities {{and spatial}} attenuation of Lg waves from four earthquakes were studied in detail {{to determine the}} applicability of Nuttli's (1973) L 0 -magnitude formulas to northeastern North American earthquakes. It {{was found that the}} 1 -sec-period Lg wave from these vents was attenuated at a slightly greater rate than has been observed in the central United States. However, comparison of the A/T observations and the Lg spectral analysis results of the two regions demonstrated that it was permissible to use NuttlFs Lg-magnitude formulas for scaling northeastern earthquakes if the amplitude observations are restricted to within 20 * of the earthquake's epicenter. This result establishes the basis for a unified mb magnitude scale between Central and northeastern North America. INTRODI ~CTION. The {{purpose of this study was}} to check the applicability of Nuttli's (1973) Lg-magnitude formula when applied to earthquakes occurring in northeastern U ited States or southeastern Canada. Magnitude scales are empirical relations of the type Nuttli, 1972) M=B(T) +C(T,O) lOg loD+log loA/T • in which A is the measured amplitude, corrected for instrumerital response; T is the period, corresponding to the amplitude; and D is the epicentral distance. The coefficients B (a function of period) and C (a function of period and epicentral distance) are psuedo-constants. The coefficient B is dependent on the phase which is used for the magnitude determination a d its period. The coefficient C for a particular phase is obtained from a linear approximation f the observed attenuation <b>ver</b> a <b>limited</b> range of distances and is known to be dependent upon the path of wave propagation.

40|$|Experimental and {{clinical}} {{evidence indicates that}} estrogens have a relevant role in the pathogenesis of cancer of hormone-sensitive organs. Estrogen receptors (ERs) are present in liver cells. Normal liver expresses almost exclusively wild-type ERs derived from the full-length transcript of the gene. During progression of liver disease to hepatocellular carcinoma, variant forms of ERs have been demonstrated that greatly influence {{the course of the}} disease and the possibility of palliative treatment. Peritumoral cirrhotic tissue of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, especially males, expresses a variant form of ER (vER) with an exon 5 deletion. In hepatocellular carcinoma, vER largely predominates and sometimes becomes the only form expressed. That the occurrence of <b>vER</b> alone is <b>limited</b> almost exclusively to males suggests that it {{could be one of the}} molecular events that eventually lead to the preferential development of hepatocellular carcinoma in males. In addition, the presence of vER appears most frequently in patients infected with the hepatitis B virus. The growth rate of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with vER is also significantly higher than that in patients with tumors expressing wtER...|$|R

It was previously thought she would only be featured in the dance shot, similar to when Ishida Ayumi replaced Miyamoto in the dance shot for Ijiwaru Shinai de Dakishimete. It was revealed on an early leak of Yuugure wa Ameagari and the Hello Project! Station versions of both songs that Miyamoto had been given close up shots in the full Promotion Edit (YouTube, Television ver.) and Music Video (Original <b>ver.</b> on the <b>Limited</b> Edition DVDs) as well while Suzuki was notably absent entirely. Suzuki was, however, present in the Another Ver. of Seishun Kozou ga Naiteiru. On {{the day of the}} single release, solo member commercials for [...] "Seishun Kozou ga Naiteiru" [...] were aired on screens in Shibuya featuring close-up scenes from the music video. An edition featuring Suzuki Kanon also aired, which has since created rumours for a new edit of the music video.|$|R
