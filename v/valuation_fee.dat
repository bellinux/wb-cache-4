This is not a full survey so it may not identify all the defects that a house buyer needs to know about. Also, it does not usually form a contract between the surveyor and the buyer, so the buyer has no right to sue in contract if the survey fails to detect a major problem. For an extra fee, the surveyor can usually carry out a building survey or a (cheaper) [...] "homebuyers survey" [...] at the same time. However, the buyer may have a remedy against the surveyor in tort.|$|E

40|$|Hedge fund {{managers}} are compensated via management fees on the {{assets under management}} (AUM) and incentive fees indexed to the high-water mark (HWM). We {{study the effects of}} managerial skills (alpha) and compensation on dynamic leverage choices and the <b>valuation</b> of <b>fees</b> and investors' payoffs. Increasing the investment allocation to the alpha-generating strategy typically lowers the fund's risk-adjusted excess return due to frictions such as price pressure. When the manager is only paid via management fees, the manager optimally chooses time-invariant leverage to balance the size of allocation to the alpha-generating strategy against the negative impact of increasing size on the fund's alpha. When the manager is paid via both management and incentive fees, we show that (i) the high-powered incentive fees encourage excessive risk taking, while management fees have the opposite effect; (ii) conflicts of interest between the manager and investors have significant effects on dynamically changing leverage choices and the <b>valuation</b> of <b>fees</b> and investors' payoffs; (iii) the manager optimally increases leverage following strong fund performances; (iv) investors' options to liquidate the fund following sufficiently poor fund performances substantially curtail managerial risk-taking, provide strong incentives to de-leverage, and sometimes even give rise to strong precautionary motives to hoard cash (in long positions); and (v) managerial ownership concentration has incentive alignment effects. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} two {{alternative approaches}} to valuing {{the impact of}} creative financing on housing prices. The cash equivalence adjustment which is the generally accepted approach is compared to an approach known as the financed <b>fee</b> <b>valuation</b> adjustment which is argued to be theoretically superior. A sample of 45 matched pairs of condominium sales in {{which one of the}} units is creatively financed and the other is conventionally financed is employed to test which model is most effective at explaining the market adjustment for creative financing. The authors are unable to reject the hypothesis that the housing market being examined is efficient and that the financed <b>fee</b> <b>valuation</b> adjustment is a superior model for valuing the impact of creative financing.

The conclusion of this thesis is formed based on observed trends and correlation between partial outputs of the binomial pricing model and market analysis...|$|R
40|$|Performance {{fees for}} {{portfolio}} managers {{are designed to}} align the managers' goals {{with those of the}} investors and to motivate managers to aquire "superior" information and to make better investment decisions. A part of the literature analyzes performance fees on the basis of market valuation. In this article it is shown that market valuation faces a dilemma: on the one hand, the conditions which allow for market valuation imply that the portfolio manager perfectly hedges the performance fee. This in turn implies severe restrictions on the incentive effects of the performance fee. In particular, the fee does not motivate the manager to use superior information for investment decisions concerning the managed portfolio. On the other hand, better incentives can only be generated under conditions which exclude market valuation. In this case, the analysis has to be based on expected utility <b>valuation.</b> Keywords: performance <b>fees,</b> portfolio managers, "superior" information, market valuation, incentive effect...|$|R

South African National Parks generated scenarios of possible future cash flows for private lodges on the concession sites. Based on the discounted values of these cash flows, SANP identified what rental incomes they expected to receive from the different concessions. Following the public tender of the concessions, SANP found that they had grossly underestimated {{the value of the}} concession rights. The actual tender values of the winning bidders far exceeded SANP’s projections. Furthermore, the winning bids also exceeded the mean concession <b>fee</b> <b>valuations</b> for each of the concession. The findings of this research, through the use of random stochastic modelling and Monte Carlo simulation show that real option valuation does account for the positive difference between the winning bids and the mean concession fee values for each of the concessions investigate...|$|R
40|$|Real estate {{taxation}} {{has been}} intensely debated lately. The main issue concerns {{the formation of}} taxable values based on the current cadastral incomes. More specifically, the point is made against the iniquity that the current surveyed values generate in the fiscal system, thus the necessity of overcoming it. It is known that the iniquity depends on the failed revision of <b>valuation</b> <b>fees</b> (related to the two-year period 1988 - 1989) and on the classification (sometimes still related to the urban cadastral) {{as well as on}} the modalities used to calculate the taxable basis through the multipliers (the IMU ones, particularly). These are the expression of a conventional (and certainly distorting) rate of return procedure which have become tools for the income variation. During the last twenty years, the Government and the Parliament have found the solution to the problem of iniquity in the revision of the current cadastral incomes. Nevertheless, they never managed to start a veritable reform process. In fact, during these years, they have just managed to introduce temporary measures as for instance paragraph 335 e 336 of article 1 of Law 311 of December 30 th for the revision of the classification of some territorial backgrounds or of some real estate units, thus managing to control the most evident iniquities. Some other norms were approved in order to conduct remote surveys to identify properties which were never listed in the cadastre office. More than once, other possible suitable solutions have been discussed which could have been, with a fast implementation and low use of resources, a first step towards the recovery of an equity of real estate taxation. Unfortunately, these came out to be temporary measures all the same. Last in order and worth of mention is the Ministry of Economic and Finance document by the Finance and Economy Department (hereinafter MEF) named “Ipotesi di revisione del prelievo sugli immobili” (Revision of real estate taxation proposal, August 2013) in which there is a list of all the different kind of interventions on real estate taxation, together with quantitative and qualitative valuations among which the use of the databases of the Observatory of real estate market to update the taxable basis of the Imposta municipale unica (IMU, Municipal one-tax). The solution eventually adopted by the Parliament is an overall revision capable of reforming the entire current cadastral valuation system without resorting to intermediate solutions. In fact, it has recently approved the Enabling Law 23, of 11 th March, containing «Dispositions for a more equal, transparent and growth-oriented fiscal system» in which, in the article 2, a reform of the cadastral valuation system is taken into account. It is important to notice how any contrary vote has been expressed against the Enabling Law’s text while its first reading prior to the vote in the Chamber of Deputies on September 25 th 2013, as well as in the final vote which took place on February 27 th 2014. Only during the first reading and vote in the Senate (February 4 th 2014), 12 contrary votes were registered. These elements show how the awareness of the urgency to restore an equal real estate taxation system is largely spread and accepted. What emerges from the Parliamentary debate is that different political forces are fully aware of the necessity to restore an equal real estate taxation system as well as of the complexity of the reform and its long implementation process. The auspice is to have this system implemented as soon as possible, possibly before a five-year period. About this delicate issue, also the experts in the field and the scientific world of reference have participated in the debate about the necessity of a cadastral reform through several studies. On the one hand, they want to provide empirical proof of the taxation iniquity caused by the current system; on the other hand, they want to propose possible solutions to correct this situation. Among these studies, there is the recent paper by Rocco Curto, Elena Fregonara, Patrizia Semeraro (2014) “Come rendere più eque le rendite catastali in attesa della revisione degli estimi?”(How can land registry values be made fairer pending a review of valuations?) in which a rapid and simple methodology to vary the current real estate rent through corrective coefficients of location is proposed. In this way, the taxable basis on real estate fees is re-defined in order to reduce the current fiscal iniquity caused by the obsolescence of the incomes based on the current cadastre office. However, a temporary correction to implement while waiting for the reform of the entire cadastral system. In particular, in their paper, Curto et al. (2014) propose to multiply the value of the current income by a coefficient obtained as a ratio between the average prices of a given census microzone and a reference index that “the ratio between an index price which most accurately sums up property values in individual municipalities or aggregations of municipalities in the case of the smallest municipalities (determined on the basis of market observations constituting the entire statistical sample) and the corresponding price indices of the values of each Microzone, defined on the basis of market observations (sub-samples) ” (p. 62). In the remainder of the paper, the methodology underlying the hypothesis contained in the MEF’s “Revision of real estate taxation proposal”(August 2013) is explained. Secondly, the methodological differences of corrections of real estate incomes proposed in the cited document by the MEF and in Curto et al. (2014) ’s article are then compared. Subsequently, some empirical proof is supplied relating to the two taxable-basis equity recovery methods. Lastly, further consideration on the effective and generalized implementation of the proposed methods will be made...|$|R
