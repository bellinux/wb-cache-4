In order to ameliorate speech difficulties with ample guidance from speech therapists, a website has been developed that supports speech therapy and training for people with articulation disorders in the standard Thai language. This web-based program has the ability to record speech training exercises for each speech trainee. The records will be stored in a database for the speech therapist to investigate, evaluate, compare and keep track of all trainees ’ progress in detail. Speech trainees can request live discussions via <b>video</b> <b>conference</b> <b>call</b> when needed. Communication through this web-based program facilitates and reduces training time in comparison to walk-in training or appointments. This type of training also allows people with articulation disorders to practice speech lessons whenever or wherever is convenient for them, which can lead to a more regular training processes...|$|E
40|$|Following {{the rapid}} {{development}} of mobile infrastructure and hand-held user devices like smartphones and tablets, {{the way that}} mobile networks have been utilized has changed accordingly. Users are no longer using their phones just to talk to and message each other, but have migrated most of their multimedia consumption to these devices. The increased network strain and reduced profit margins that new services {{bring to the table}} might lead to future decoupling between revenues and expenses in the network. In order to avoid this scenario various different strategies have been proposed {{and one of them is}} introduction of QoS/QoE related resource allocation techniques. This thesis looks at Interruption Prediction scheduler which tries to predict and prevent audio or video interruptions experienced during <b>video</b> <b>conference</b> <b>call.</b> In order to test the performance of these schedulers, MATLAB simulator reusing some of the functions from RUNE toolbox has been used. Results of the newly presented algorithms are compared with a QoE/QoS agnostic scheduler. Unfortunately results of these schedulers in the case of video conference are not as promising as they were in the case of some other types of services. The research done shows that these modifications of the scheduling algorithms do not help to increase the network performance in terms of observed KPIs (Total Time of Interruptions, Frequency of Interruptions and network throughput) in most of the described scenarios.

40|$|Editorial: Biochemical {{toxicology}} for {{the coroner}} should encompass a wide ranging analytical screen for drugs and toxic compounds. A multidisciplinary case conference in appropriate complex cases must {{become the norm}} to furnish the coroner with expert advice where toxicology {{is a factor in}} the cause of death. A networked Institute of Forensic Services in Ireland should be formed to integrate toxicology, chemical pathology and histopathology in the provision of best quality scientific reports for coroners. In the Coroner's Act 1962 in Ireland, Section 33 sets the statutory arrangements for post-mortem and special examinations. For toxicology, "a coroner may request the minister to arrange - (b) a special examination by way of analysis, test or otherwise by a person appointed by the minister of particular parts or contents of the body or any other relevant substances or things,". In the Coroner's Act (Northern Ireland) 1959, Section 30 reads a "coroner who considers an analysis of any matter or thing of or concerning any dead body to be necessary may direct that such analysis be made by or under the supervision of a registered medical practitioner on the list mentioned in section twenty-six or by or {{under the supervision of the}} Director of the Northern Ireland Forensic Science Laboratory and it shall be the duty of such registered medical practitioner or Director (as the case may be) to submit a report of such analysis to the coroner”. In the Coroner's Bill 2007 in Ireland, Part 10 concerns post-mortem and special examinations. Section 74, (3) states "Where a registered medical practitioner conducts a post-mortem examination or arranges for the conduct of a special examination [...] . he or she shall do so under the direction of the coroner. " The Review of the Coroners Service, Report of the Working Party, Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform 2000, identified the long delays in biochemical toxicology analysis time and in the processing of tissue samples from autopsies as impeding the coronial process 1. The maintenance of a Centre of Excellence to serve the coronial system was recommended but no such centre exists currently. The problem with the State Laboratory service is its isolation from clinical practice and its role in proving services to many sectors including agriculture. University College Dublin houses the Medical Bureau of Road Safety which also provides analytical services in drug toxicology in relation to driving under the influence of intoxicants. Other than turn-around times for reports, nowhere in the Report are the substantive issues of delineating minimum standards of service provision, in the scale and breath of toxicological screening, clinical governance involving toxicologists, chemical pathologists and biochemists and analytical best practice, mentioned for services in the Republic. The Report of the Working Party recommended the establishment of a committee to devise coroners’ rules. The Rules Committee Report is inadequate in the biochemical toxicology sphere. Toxicology requires interpretative expertise with knowledge of toxicity, pharmacology and internal medicine. Factors which influence the biochemical result include the anatomical site of blood or other matrix sampling, the body storage temperature, the interval since death and movements and position of the body. There is in addition post-mortem redistribution of drugs and ante-mortem drug metabolism which must be considered to minimise interpretative errors 2, 3. Utilisation of appropriate expertise should be included in any set of coroners’ rules to reduce the likelihood of misinterpretation 4, 5. The degree of diversity of biochemical screening for toxins should be agreed nationally and remain constantly under review in response to local, national and international developments in substance abuse. A multidisciplinary conference involving toxicology input in relevant cases should be a standard best-practice procedure to advise on the interpretation of the post-mortem findings in complex cases prior to the autopsy pathologist reporting the conclusions to the coroner. Meetings could be arranged both by <b>video</b> <b>conference</b> <b>call</b> and in person. Standard templates for reporting common analytes should be agreed to limit the number of case conferences. This is an important safeguard for the scientific integrity of the coronial process. Because the lawyer coroner is not in a position to specify the extent of analytical screening, the role of the toxicology interpretative and analytical service must be explicitly recognised. The Coroners and Justice Act 2009 in England and Wales specifies that there are training requirements for Medical Examiners in their new system both before and during their period in office 6. The Medical Council in Ireland mandates audit as part of the Professional Competence programme in all areas which is a legal requirement since May 2011. These provide the templates for action. The Coronial Service for Northern Ireland, operating still under the 1959 Act, does not require the reporting pathologist to hold a multidisciplinary meeting when there are positive toxicology results. However, system reform should include a multidisciplinary reporting system. Clinical governance and accreditation of the process should be centred around academic departments in both Irish jurisdictions. A networked Institute of Forensic Toxicology Services is possible in Ireland within current resources. The now routine practice of multidisciplinary case conferences in appropriate cases in hospitals must be brought to the coronial system. This is the surest way to limit interpretative errors and underpin the scientific integrity of the coronial system.

40|$|We {{introduce}} FaceVR, a novel {{method for}} gaze-aware facial reenactment in the Virtual Reality (VR) context. The {{key component of}} FaceVR is a robust algorithm to perform real-time facial motion capture of an actor who is wearing a head-mounted display (HMD), {{as well as a}} new data-driven approach for eye tracking from monocular videos. In addition to these face reconstruction components, FaceVR incorporates photo-realistic re-rendering in real time, thus allowing artificial modifications of face and eye appearances. For instance, we can alter facial expressions, change gaze directions, or remove the VR goggles in realistic re-renderings. In a live setup with a source and a target actor, we apply these newly-introduced algorithmic components. We assume that the source actor is wearing a VR device, and we capture his facial expressions and eye movement in real-time. For the target video, we mimic a similar tracking process; however, we use the source input to drive the animations of the target video, thus enabling gaze-aware facial reenactment. To render the modified target video on a stereo display, we augment our capture and reconstruction process with stereo data. In the end, FaceVR produces compelling results for a variety of applications, such as gaze-aware facial reenactment, reenactment in virtual reality, removal of VR goggles, and re-targeting of somebody's gaze direction in a <b>video</b> <b>conferencing</b> <b>call...</b>|$|R
