40|$|The {{modified}} Blalock-Taussig (mB-T) shunt is {{an effective}} palliative surgical method {{in the treatment of}} cyanotic congenital heart diseases. It increases the pulmonary blood flow through an implanted shunt between systemic and pulmonary arteries. The surgical technique improved over the years. However, it is still a challenge to control appropriate distribution of blood flow through this shunt after this kind of procedure till now. Here, we report on the method of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for the hemodynamic studies of a patient-specific case after the mB-T shunt. The analysis system that we validated previously in the studies of the Norwood procedure was applied to predict the hemodynamic characteristics in the mB-T hunt area. The real-time velocities derived from Echocardiography measurements and the blood pressure wave reflections from peripheral vessels were utilized as boundary conditions to physiologically capture the blood flow information in the simulation. The local pressure, blood flow distribution and wall shear stress were calculated. The results suggest pressure decreases greatly through the shunt and around 40 % of blood flow is distributed from the systemic circulation to pulmonary arteries in one cardiac cycle. These indict computational hemodynamics may be applied in future studies of establishing quantitative standards to evaluate the outcomes of the mB-T shunt and to optimize the implantation of the mB-T shunt in <b>virtual</b> <b>surgeries.</b> 4 page(s...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Virtual</b> <b>surgery</b> as a {{means to}} {{simulate}} procedures and train surgeons grew out of the video game industry. Video games for entertainment {{has been one of the}} largest industries in the world for some time. [...] However, as early as the 1980s, companies such as Atari began working on ideas of how to use these video environments for training people in different tasks and different professions. Younger trainees in the medical field showed greater eye-hand coordination and quick thinking abilities over those who had never played. Although graphics were extremely limited, Atari began developing several types of simulators related to health care. This type of training met with strong skepticism until studies in the mid-1980s began to show that the concept had promise.|$|E
50|$|He {{taught himself}} {{mathematics}} and physics and developed his own lenses, {{including one for}} a microscope {{that was used to}} photograph the first images of human eggs in an in vitro fertilization program. Another lens was used for the endoscope that can photograph the fetus from outside the amniotic sac. The images resulting from this became cover stories for Life Magazine. In 1989 Mr. Tsiaras realized the potential of computer generated imaging and learned UNIX, then C and C++ to write his own programs transferring his knowledge of light moving through physical space to light moving through tissue in virtual space. He was offered an adjunct professorship at both Brown and Yale University Medical schools. Working with Yale he received funding from NASA to write algorithms for <b>virtual</b> <b>surgery,</b> so that astronauts could be cut in robotics pods for deep space flights.|$|E
50|$|However, {{the graphic}} and {{interactive}} limitations of video games hindered their development and usefulness until the 1990s, when {{companies such as}} Nintendo and Sony began to produce three dimensional polygon graphics to produce the concept of “virtual reality.” This improved more {{with the introduction of}} Wii systems what allowed more realistic manipulation of the virtual reality through motion sensors. Studies at this time showed that the new interaction method improved coordination and space perception. The advances also allowed the technology to move from “game” to “simulator.” DaVinci Surgical System programmed their first simulator for laparoscopic surgery in 2005, and its accuracy and design made it quickly accepted by surgeons. While most of this technology has been used for general surgical training, it has also been used to plan specific surgeries as well. The first <b>virtual</b> <b>surgery</b> (where actual surgery followed the virtual practice) was performed on 17 August 2009 when Dr. David Clarke in Halifax, Nova Scotia removed a brain tumour 24 hours after removing a simulated tumour. By 2010, numerous hospitals had some kind of simulation technology available for medical professionals, especially for the training of laparoscopic procedures.|$|E

40|$|Material {{and methods}} Seventeen {{computer-aided}} plans {{were used for}} virtual variation simulation of surgeries conducted on 17 human cadavers and 145 implants placed in the cadavers. For each <b>surgery,</b> 10, 000 <b>virtual</b> <b>surgeries</b> were performed, resulting in 1, 450, 000 implant placements. The results from the virtual variation simulations were statistically compared with {{the results from the}} actual surgeries. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the implant distributions (α=. 05). Results In the maxillae, the difference between the simulated average mean of the mean and the compared surgical average of the median was 0. 22 mm (apex) and − 0. 35 mm (hex), and for the mandible, the corresponding values were − 0. 19 mm (apex) and − 0. 69 mm (hex). The simulated average mean of the range compared to the mean range of the maximum deviation results from the surgeries of the maxillae was 2. 96 mm (apex) and 0. 44 mm (hex), and 2. 3 mm (apex) and 0. 26 mm (hex) for the mandible. The implant distributions between the simulations and the surgeries were significantly different at both the hex (P<. 001) and apex (P<. 001). Statement of problem CAD/CAM template-guided surgery has gained attention as a method of improving the predictability of dental implant placement. However, due to possible variations during the manufacturing process and in the robustness of the template design, a virtual prediction of the potential positioning of the implants is needed Purpose The {{purpose of this study was}} to perform virtual variation simulations on virtually planned implant placements and to compare them with corresponding results from actual surgeries performed on human cadavers in a previous study. Material and methods Seventeen computer-aided plans were used for virtual variation simulation of surgeries conducted on 17 human cadavers and 145 implants placed in the cadavers. For each <b>surgery,</b> 10, 000 <b>virtual</b> <b>surgeries</b> were performed, resulting in 1, 450, 000 implant placements. The results from the virtual variation simulations were statistically compared with the results from the actual surgeries.

The implant distributions between the simulations and the surgeries were significantly different at both the hex (P<. 001) and apex (P<. 001). Conclusions The implant distributions were neither static nor normally distributed. Thus, within the limitations of this study, the definitive geometrical variations of the implants were not static, as they depend on the individual anatomy of the jaws and the ability to place the CAD/CAM-guided surgical template in the proper position.

50|$|In June 2016, a {{multidisciplinary}} team of surgeons, physicians {{and other health}} professionals completed a near-total face transplant at Mayo Clinic’s Rochester campus. Patient Andrew Sandness, a 32-year-old from eastern Wyoming, had devastating facial injuries from a gunshot wound in 2006. The surgery, which spanned more than 50 hours, restored Sandness’ nose, upper and lower jaw, palate, teeth, cheeks, facial muscles, oral mucosa, some of the salivary glands and {{the skin of his}} face (from below the eyelids to the neck and from ear to ear). The care team lead by Samir Mardini, M.D., and Hatem Amer, M.D., the surgical director and medical director, respectively, for the Mayo Clinic Essam and Dalal Obaid Center for Reconstructive Transplant Surgery, devoted more than 50 Saturdays over 3½ years to rehearsing the surgery, using sets of cadaver heads to transplant the face of one to the other. They used 3-D imaging and <b>virtual</b> <b>surgery</b> to plot out the bony cuts so the donor's face would fit perfectly on the transplant recipient.

40|$|Background: Orthognathic surgery has {{traditionally}} been performed using stone model surgery. This involves translating desired clinical movements of the maxilla and mandible into stone models that are then cut and repositioned into class I occlusion from which a splint is generated. Model surgery is an accurate and reproducible method of surgical correction of the dentofacial skeleton in cleft and noncleft patients, albeit considerably time-consuming. With the advent of computed tomography scanning, 3 D imaging and virtual surgical planning (VSP) have gained a foothold in orthognathic surgery with VSP rapidly replacing traditional model surgery {{in many parts of}} the country and the world. What has yet to be determined is whether the application and feasibility of <b>virtual</b> model <b>surgery</b> is at a point where it will eliminate the need for traditional model surgery in both the private and academic setting. Methods: Traditional model surgery was compared with VSP splint fabrication to determine the feasibility of use and accuracy of application in orthognathic surgery within our institution. Results: VSP was found to generate acrylic splints of equal quality to model surgery splints in a fraction of the time. Drawbacks of VSP splint fabrication are the increased cost of production and certain limitations as it relates to complex craniofacial patients. Conclusions: It is our opinion that <b>virtual</b> model <b>surgery</b> will displace and replace traditional model surgery as it will become cost and time effective in both the private and academic setting for practitioners providing orthognathic surgical care in cleft and noncleft patients...|$|R
