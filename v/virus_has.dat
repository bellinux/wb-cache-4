5|$|A <b>virus</b> <b>has</b> {{either a}} DNA or an RNA genome and {{is called a}} DNA virus or an RNA virus, respectively. The vast {{majority}} of viruses have RNA genomes. Plant viruses tend to have single-stranded RNA genomes and bacteriophages tend to have double-stranded DNA genomes.|$|E
5|$|Assembly – Following the structure-mediated {{self-assembly}} of {{the virus}} particles, some modification of the proteins often occurs. In viruses such as HIV, this modification (sometimes called maturation) occurs after the <b>virus</b> <b>has</b> been released from the host cell.|$|E
5|$|A white {{cockatoo}} and a sulphur-crested cockatoo {{were found to}} be infected with the protozoon Haemoproteus and another sulphur-crested cockatoo had the malaria parasite Plasmodium on analysis of faecal samples at Almuñecar ornithological garden in Granada in Spain. Like amazon parrots and macaws, cockatoos frequently develop cloacal papillomas. The relationship with malignancy is unknown, as is the cause, although a parrot papilloma <b>virus</b> <b>has</b> been isolated from an African grey parrot with the condition.|$|E
50|$|Ten new {{circular}} <b>viruses</b> <b>have</b> {{been isolated}} from dragonfly larvae. The genomes range from 1628 to 2668 nucleotides in length. These dragonfly <b>viruses</b> <b>have</b> since {{been placed in}} the Gemycircularviridae.|$|R
50|$|Multipartite is a {{class of}} <b>virus</b> that <b>have</b> {{segmented}} nucleic acid genome. Only a few ssDNA <b>viruses</b> <b>have</b> multipartite genome, but a lot more RNA <b>viruses</b> <b>have</b> multipartite genome. An advantage of multipartite genome {{is its ability to}} synthesize multiple mRNA strands to avoid the cellular constraint of monocistronicity.|$|R
50|$|A {{certain type}} of latency could be {{ascribed}} to the endogenous retroviruses. These <b>viruses</b> <b>have</b> incorporated into the human genome in the distant past, and are now passed through reproduction. Generally these types of <b>viruses</b> <b>have</b> become highly evolved, and have lost the expression of many gene products. Some of the proteins expressed by these <b>viruses</b> <b>have</b> co-evolved with host cells to play important roles in normal processes.|$|R
5|$|An {{outbreak}} of a gastrointestinal illness in Spain which was causing mortalities in humans {{has been linked}} to western jackdaws. During a post-mortem on an affected bird, a polyomavirus was isolated from the spleen. The illness appeared to be a co-infection of this with Salmonella and the <b>virus</b> <b>has</b> been provisionally named the crow polyomavirus (CPyV). Segmented filamentous bacteria have been isolated from the small intestine of a western jackdaw, although their pathogenicity or role is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Baculoviruses are {{specific}} to individual insect host species and {{have been shown to}} be useful in biological pest control. For example, the Lymantria dispar multicapsid nuclear polyhedrosis <b>virus</b> <b>has</b> been used to spray large areas of forest in North America where larvae of the gypsy moth are causing serious defoliation. The moth larvae are killed by the virus they have eaten and die, the disintegrating cadavers leaving virus particles on the foliage to infect other larvae.|$|E
5|$|Bumblebees are {{parasitised}} by tracheal mites, Locustacarus buchneri; protozoans including Crithidia bombi and Apicystis bombi; and microsporidians including Nosema bombi and Nosema ceranae. The tree bumblebee B. hypnorum {{has spread}} into the United Kingdom despite hosting {{high levels of}} a nematode that normally interferes with queen bees' attempts to establish colonies. Deformed wing <b>virus</b> <b>has</b> been found to affect 11% of bumblebees in Great Britain.|$|E

The mosquito-borne <b>viruses</b> <b>had</b> electrophoretically similar small membrane polypeptides (V- 1); the tick-borne <b>viruses</b> <b>had</b> a V- 1 of significantly decreased mobility...|$|R
5|$|Dengue {{is spread}} by {{several species of}} {{mosquito}} of the Aedes type, principally A. aegypti. The <b>virus</b> <b>has</b> five different types; infection with one type usually gives lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term immunity to the others. Subsequent infection with a different type {{increases the risk of}} severe complications. A number of tests are available to confirm the diagnosis including detecting antibodies to the virus or its RNA.|$|E
5|$|The natural {{hosts of}} {{influenza}} viruses are pigs and birds, {{although it has}} probably infected humans since antiquity. The virus can cause mild to severe epizootics in wild and domesticated animals. Many species of wild birds migrate and this has spread influenza across the continents throughout the ages. The <b>virus</b> <b>has</b> evolved into numerous strains and continues to do so, posing an ever-present threat.|$|E
5|$|Viruses {{reproduce}} rapidly {{because they}} {{have only a few}} genes compared to humans who have 20,000–25,000. For example, influenza <b>virus</b> <b>has</b> only eight genes and rotavirus has eleven. These genes encode structural proteins that form the virus particle, or non-structural proteins, that are only found in cells infected by the virus.|$|E
50|$|In most cases, {{naturally}} occurring DNA molecules are double-stranded and RNA molecules are single-stranded. There are numerous exceptions, however—some <b>viruses</b> <b>have</b> genomes made of double-stranded RNA and other <b>viruses</b> <b>have</b> single-stranded DNA genomes, and, in some circumstances, nucleic acid structures {{with three or}} four strands can form.|$|R
40|$|In {{the course}} of the 2012 – 13 season, A(H 1 N 1) pdm 09, A(H 3 N 2) and B/Victoria- and B/Yamagata-lineage {{influenza}} <b>viruses</b> <b>have</b> co-circulated in ECDC-affiliated countries over what was an extended influenza season. The relative prevalences of each <b>virus</b> type/subtype <b>has</b> varied between countries. Type A and type B <b>viruses</b> <b>have</b> been detected in similar proportions but with type A peaking and declining slightly before type B. A(H 1 N 1) pdm 09 <b>viruses</b> <b>have</b> been detected at approximately twice the level of A(H 3 N 2) viruses. The vast majority of A(H 1 N 1) pdm 09 <b>viruses</b> <b>have</b> remained antigenically similar to the vaccine virus, A/California/ 07 / 2009, but continued to show genetic drift with an increasing prevalence of genetic group 6 viruses. The vast majority of A(H 3 N 2) <b>viruses</b> <b>have</b> been antigenically and genetically similar to cell-propagated A/Victoria/ 361 / 2011, a genetic group 3 C virus and the prototype vaccine virus for the 2012 – 13 influenza season; group 3 C <b>viruses</b> <b>have</b> circulated exclusively in recent months and the recommended vaccine virus for the 2013 – 14 season, A/Texas/ 50 / 2012, is in this genetic group. Viruses of the B/Yamagata-lineage have predominated over those of the B/Victoria-lineage. B/Victoria-lineage <b>viruses</b> <b>have</b> remained antigenically similar to cell-propagated reference viruses of the B/Brisbane/ 60 / 2008 genetic clade. B/Yamagata-lineage viruses formed two antigenically distinguishable genetic clades: clade 3 represented by B/Wisconsin/ 1 / 2010 (the recommended vaccine component for the 2012 – 13 influenza season) and, in increasing numbers, clade 2 represented by B/Massachusetts/ 2 / 2012 (the recommended vaccine component for the 2013 – 14 influenza season) ...|$|R

5|$|Although {{poliovirus}} transmission {{has been}} interrupted {{in much of}} the world, transmission of wild poliovirus does continue and creates an ongoing risk for the importation of wild poliovirus into previously polio-free regions. If importations of poliovirus occur, outbreaks of poliomyelitis may develop, especially in areas with low vaccination coverage and poor sanitation. As a result, high levels of vaccination coverage must be maintained. In November 2013, the World Health Organization announced a polio outbreak in Syria. In response, the Armenian government put out a notice asking Syrian Armenians under age 15 to get the polio vaccine. As of 2014, polio <b>virus</b> <b>has</b> spread out to ten countries mainly in Africa, Asia and the Middle East with Pakistan, Syria and Cameroon advising vaccinations to outbound travelers.|$|E
5|$|Archaea can be {{infected}} by double-stranded DNA viruses that are unrelated {{to any other}} form of virus and have a variety of unusual shapes, including bottles, hooked rods, or teardrops. These viruses have been studied in most detail in thermophilics, particularly the orders Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales. Two groups of single-stranded DNA viruses that infect archaea have been recently isolated. One group is exemplified by the Halorubrum pleomorphic virus 1 ("Pleolipoviridae") infecting halophilic archaea and the other one by the Aeropyrum coil-shaped virus ("Spiraviridae") infecting a hyperthermophilic (optimal growth at 90–95°C) host. Notably, the latter <b>virus</b> <b>has</b> the largest currently reported ssDNA genome. Defenses against these viruses may involve RNA interference from repetitive DNA sequences that are related to the genes of the viruses.|$|E
5|$|Because OROV occurs {{frequently}} in Oryzomys couesi, Chu and colleagues {{suggested that it}} is the primary host of the virus and that infections in Sigmodon mascotensis are the result of spillover between these two rodent species, which occur closely together. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, the disease caused by hantaviruses such as Sin Nombre <b>virus,</b> <b>has</b> never been reported in Mexico, but antibodies against hantaviruses have been found in human blood samples in Yucatán and various wild rodents are known to be reservoirs of hantavirus species. Thus, there is a potential risk of OROV infection in humans. Before the discovery of OROV, one hantavirus species had been identified in Mexico—El Moro Canyon virus from the small rodent Reithrodontomys megalotis.|$|E

5|$|They reunite {{with the}} other {{characters}} and exit the school along {{with the other}} students and faculty brought there by Mister One; however Ryouta, now thoroughly infected by the Charon virus, elects to stay behind in cryonic storage until a cure is found. The scenario ends with Sakuya vowing to come back for Ryouta, and Ryouta offering to recap the day's events to the protagonist's spirit as the door to the storage facility closes. If the extended epilogue is unlocked, it is revealed that Yuuya survived being poisoned long enough to receive an antidote, and the game's closing lines imply that with Shuu's cooperation, a cure for the Charon <b>virus</b> <b>has</b> been developed.|$|E
5|$|The group goes to IBF {{in search}} for a cure, but starts showing signs of Tief Blau. An {{exception}} is Tsugumi, as the Cure <b>virus</b> <b>has</b> made her immune; the group injects themselves with her antibodies. They get contact with the surface, and a rescue pod is sent down, but is only able {{to stay for a}} short period of time. Tsugumi disappears to find Chami, who has gone missing; Takeshi chases after her, and saves Sora's data onto a disk, to save her memories. Returning to IBF, they have missed the rescue vessel. They find a submarine and escape, but its batteries die; Takeshi exits it, giving it enough buoyancy to save Tsugumi, while he dies on the ocean floor. Coco dies in IBF, as she had been looking for Pipi, and the rescue team could not find her.|$|E
5|$|The poxviruses are large, complex {{viruses that}} have an unusual morphology. The viral genome is {{associated}} with proteins within a central disc structure known as a nucleoid. The nucleoid {{is surrounded by a}} membrane and two lateral bodies of unknown function. The <b>virus</b> <b>has</b> an outer envelope with a thick layer of protein studded over its surface. The whole virion is slightly pleiomorphic, ranging from ovoid to brick shape. Mimivirus {{is one of the largest}} characterised viruses, with a capsid diameter of 400nm. Protein filaments measuring 100nm project from the surface. The capsid appears hexagonal under an electron microscope, therefore the capsid is probably icosahedral. In 2011, researchers discovered the largest then known virus in samples of water collected from the ocean floor off the coast of Las Cruces, Chile. Provisionally named Megavirus chilensis, it can be seen with a basic optical microscope. In 2013, the Pandoravirus genus was discovered in Chile and Australia, and has genomes about twice as large as Megavirus and Mimivirus.|$|E

5|$|The <b>virus</b> <b>has</b> been {{identified}} in the pulmonary nodules of African elephants {{as far back as}} the 1970s. The first recognised fatal case of EEHV in an Asian elephant was identified at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., in 1995; testing on stored tissue samples was able to identify a number of earlier deaths as being due to the same virus. These cases have so far {{been identified}} as early as 1983. Since this date, there have been a total of 54 more cases in North America and Europe, nine of which were successfully treated. The May 2009 deaths of two calves at Whipsnade Zoo were not included in this calculation. This gives a fatality rate of over 80% among known symptomatic disease cases. In cases where antiviral medication was applied, treatment was effective in about one in three cases. As of 2005, there were twelve cases where famciclovir had been used, eight of which were fatal. As a fraction of the overall population, it has been calculated that of the 78 Asian elephants born in captivity in North America between 1978 and 2007, 19 are known to have died of EEHV, and five more were successfully treated with antiviral medication.|$|E
5|$|Epidemiology is used {{to break}} the chain of {{infection}} in populations during outbreaks of viral diseases. Control measures are used {{that are based on}} knowledge of how the virus is transmitted. It is important to find the source, or sources, of the outbreak and to identify the virus. Once the <b>virus</b> <b>has</b> been identified, the chain of transmission can sometimes be broken by vaccines. When vaccines are not available, sanitation and disinfection can be effective. Often, infected people are isolated {{from the rest of the}} community, and those that have been exposed to the virus are placed in quarantine. To control the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in cattle in Britain in 2001, thousands of cattle were slaughtered. Most viral infections of humans and other animals have incubation periods during which the infection causes no signs or symptoms. Incubation periods for viral diseases range from a few days to weeks, but are known for most infections. Somewhat overlapping, but mainly following the incubation period, there is a period of communicability — a time when an infected individual or animal is contagious and can infect another person or animal. This, too, is known for many viral infections, and knowledge of the length of both periods is important in the control of outbreaks. When outbreaks cause an unusually high proportion of cases in a population, community, or region, they are called epidemics. If outbreaks spread worldwide, they are called pandemics.|$|E
