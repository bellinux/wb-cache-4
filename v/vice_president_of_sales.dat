500|$|Sierra {{found that}} Williams tended to garner {{extremely}} favorable press, even as Phantasmagoria got negative press, so {{the company began}} having her discuss the game in person. In response to the backlash, Williams said she believed computer games were subject to harsher standards than films and television, which she said often have more violent content than Phantasmagoria, in part because computer games are often regarded as children's entertainment rather than for adults. Williams said Phantasmagoria was less excessively violent than games like Doom and Mortal Kombat, and that unlike those games, Phantasmagoria is [...] "the good guy ... not going around shooting up people". Sierra spokeswoman Rebecca Buxton and Dennis Cloutier, the company's <b>vice</b> <b>president</b> <b>of</b> <b>sales,</b> both expressed surprise at {{the reaction to the}} game because Sierra made strong efforts to warn viewers about the adult content in its marketing, box warnings and censoring options. Cloutier said the company was essentially [...] "censoring ourselves". Steven L.

So far in 2000 the best-selling game in America for any home console is Pokemon Stadium for [...] Nintendo 64, and the best-selling game for any handheld video game system is Pokemon [...] Yellow for Game Boy Color, but Pokemon [...] Gold and Silver will eclipse even those impressive sales totals.
