5|$|A {{permanent}} {{resolution of}} the capital location issue came in 1864. In 1860, the legislature put the question once again to a popular <b>vote.</b> <b>On</b> <b>a</b> vote in 1862, no city received the 50 percent minimum required by law. In an 1864 election, Salem received 79 percent and was declared the state capital. The Oregon Constitution lists the seat of state government in Article XIV as Marion County, of which Salem is the seat.|$|E

Aldermen applauded. Shiller again joined in unanimous support for Daley's 2001, 2002, and 2003 budgets. In the 2001 redistricting of Chicago wards, Daley tried to deprive Shiller {{of her most}} committed supporters, but failed when none of the aldermen in adjacent wards wanted to contend with Shiller's supporters. Shiller and Daley, however, reached an understanding: the mayor supported her in the 2003 elections and also pushed forward development of Wilson Yard, a Chicago Transit Authority facility destroyed by fire, into affordable housing and a Target store, using the Wilson Yard Tax Increment Financing District and the $26.5 million it generated. Subsequently, Shiller consistently voted {{in support of the}} mayor's agenda.|$|E

5|$|Oklahoma's {{judicial}} branch {{consists of}} the Oklahoma Supreme Court, the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, and 77 District Courts that each serve one county. The Oklahoma judiciary also contains two independent courts: a Court of Impeachment and the Oklahoma Court on the Judiciary. Oklahoma has two courts of last resort: the state Supreme Court hears civil cases, and the state Court of Criminal Appeals hears criminal cases (this split system exists only in Oklahoma and neighboring Texas). Judges of those two courts, {{as well as the}} Court of Civil Appeals are appointed by the Governor upon the recommendation of the state Judicial Nominating Commission, and are subject to a non-partisan retention <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> six-year rotating schedule.|$|E
5|$|On 22 March, {{the vote}} on the second reading {{attracted}} a record 608 members, including the non-voting Speaker (the previous record was 530 members). Despite the high attendance, the second reading was approved by only one vote, and further progress on the Reform Bill was difficult. During the committee stage, Isaac Gascoyne put forward a motion objecting to provisions of the bill that reduced {{the total number of}} seats in the House of Commons. This motion was carried, against the government's wishes, by 8 votes. Thereafter, the ministry lost a <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> procedural motion by 22 votes. As these divisions indicated that Parliament was against the Reform Bill, the ministry decided to request a dissolution and take its appeal to the people.|$|E

5|$|In 1990, Major League Baseball {{team owners}} met {{to demand that}} minor league owners improve their ballparks {{in order to meet}} their desired standards. Greer had already fallen behind other parks {{when it came to the}} quality of the field and clubhouse, and it also lacked a weight room and batting cages. Following his failed bid to secure an MLB team for Nashville in the 1993 Major League Baseball {{expansion}} process (Nashville was one of ten cities considered, but was eliminated from contention very early in the process; the two new franchises were eventually awarded to Denver and Miami), Schmittou focused on scaling-back his proposed MLB stadium into a new Triple-A facility for the Sounds. At a time when other Triple-A cities were building new, relatively luxurious ballparks, Schmittou was unable to convince mayor Phil Bredesen or the Metro Council to pay for such a new park. He considered moving the team to a surrounding county, and even tried, unsuccessfully, to get the Metro Council to pass a referendum to let taxpayers <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> temporary tax increase to pay off a proposed $40million stadium in three years. In the end, Schmittou elected to keep the Sounds at Greer but make significant improvements to the stadium.|$|E
5|$|With {{few options}} available, the Sounds signed a PDC with the Chicago White Sox {{who wanted to}} move their Triple-A farm club closer to home than their {{previous}} location in Vancouver. The White Sox presented Schmittou {{with a list of}} complaints about the relatively poor condition of Greer Stadium. Schmittou was unable to convince mayor Phil Bredesen or the Metro Council to pay for new stadium to replace Greer. He considered moving the team to a surrounding county, and explored sites in La Vergne, Cool Springs, and Mount Juliet. He even tried, unsuccessfully, to get the Metro Council to pass a referendum to let taxpayers <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> temporary tax increase to pay off a proposed $40million stadium in three years. In the end, Schmittou elected to keep the Sounds at Greer but make significant improvements to the stadium. One of those improvements was the addition of Greer's signature guitar-shaped scoreboard, which was installed in 1993.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, {{members of}} the Legislative Assembly held {{constitutional}} talks with the Colonial Office in London. The talks broke down as Marshall did not agree to the British Government's proposal for the casting <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> proposed Defence Council to be held by the British High Commissioner to Singapore, who would only exercise it in an emergency. Marshall resigned as Chief Minister in June 1956, {{and was replaced by}} Lim Yew Hock. The following year, Lim led another delegation to the UK for further talks on self-government. This time, agreement was reached on the composition of an Internal Security Council. Other constitutional arrangements were swiftly settled in 1958, and on 1 August the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed the State of Singapore Act 1958, granting the colony full internal self-government. Under Singapore's new constitution which came into force on 3 June 1959, the Governor was replaced by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara (Head of State), who had power to appoint as Prime Minister the person most likely to command the authority of the Legislative Assembly, and other Ministers of the Cabinet on the Prime Minister's advice. The Constitution also created the post of the British High Commissioner, who was entitled to receive the agenda of each Cabinet meeting and to see all Cabinet papers. In the 1959 general elections, the People's Action Party (PAP) swept to power with 43 out of the 51 seats in the Assembly, and Lee Kuan Yew became the first Prime Minister of Singapore. Nine other Ministers were appointed to the Cabinet.|$|E

5|$|Robinson {{was elected}} bishop by the New Hampshire diocese on June 7, 2003, at St. Paul's Church in Concord. Thirty-nine clergy votes and 83 lay votes were the {{threshold}} necessary {{to elect a}} bishop in the Diocese of New Hampshire at that time. The clergy voted 58 votes for Robinson and the laity voted 96 for Robinson on the second ballot. The Episcopal Church requires in its Canon 16 that the election procedure and the candidate who is elected be subjected to review and must be consented to by the national church. No objections were raised to the procedure of the election. If diocesan election occurred within 120 days (3 months) of a General Convention, canon law requires consent by the House of Deputies and then the House of Bishops at the General Convention itself. Consent to the election of Robinson was given in August at the 2003 General Convention. The General Convention of 2003 became the center for debate over Robinson's election, as conservatives and liberals within the Church argued over whether Robinson {{should be allowed to}} become bishop. Some conservative factions threatened a schism within both the Episcopal Church and the Anglican Communion should Robinson be elected. Before the House of Deputies can <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> resolution, a legislative committee must examine the piece of legislation first. The Committee on the Consecration of Bishops held a two-hour hearing on Robinson's election and supporters and opponents were allowed to speak. One of the speakers was Robinson's daughter, Ella, who read a letter from his ex-wife Boo in strong support of Robinson. The House of Deputies, which consists of laypersons and priests, voted in the affirmative: the laity voted 63 in favor, 32 opposed, and 13 divided; the clergy voted 65 in favor, 31 opposed, and 12 divided.|$|E
