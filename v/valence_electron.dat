5|$|Being {{the first}} period 8 element, ununennium is {{predicted}} to be an alkali metal, below lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium, and francium. Each of these elements has one <b>valence</b> <b>electron</b> in the outermost s-orbital (<b>valence</b> <b>electron</b> configuration ns1), which is easily lost in chemical reactions to form the +1 oxidation state: thus the alkali metals are very reactive elements. Ununennium is predicted to continue the trend and have a <b>valence</b> <b>electron</b> configuration of 8s1. It is therefore expected to behave much like its lighter congeners; however, it is also predicted to differ from the lighter alkali metals in some properties.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} alkali metals, lithium {{has a single}} <b>valence</b> <b>electron</b> that is easily given up to form a cation. Because of this, lithium is a good {{conductor}} of heat and electricity {{as well as a}} highly reactive element, though it is the least reactive of the alkali metals. Lithium's low reactivity is due to the proximity of its <b>valence</b> <b>electron</b> to its nucleus (the remaining two electrons are in the 1s orbital, much lower in energy, and do not participate in chemical bonds).|$|E
5|$|Being {{the second}} period 8 element, unbinilium is {{predicted}} to be an alkaline earth metal, below beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, and radium. Each of these elements has two valence electrons in the outermost s-orbital (<b>valence</b> <b>electron</b> configuration ns2), which is easily lost in chemical reactions to form the +2 oxidation state: thus the alkaline earth metals are rather reactive elements, {{with the exception of}} beryllium due to its small size. Unbinilium is predicted to continue the trend and have a <b>valence</b> <b>electron</b> configuration of 8s2. It is therefore expected to behave much like its lighter congeners; however, it is also predicted to differ from the lighter alkaline earth metals in some properties.|$|E

5000|$|An atom with {{a closed}} shell of <b>valence</b> <b>{{electron}}s</b> (corresponding to an electron configuration s2p6) {{tends to be}} chemically inert. Atoms {{with one or two}} more <b>valence</b> <b>electrons</b> than are needed for a [...] "closed" [...] shell are highly reactive due to the following reasons: 1) It requires relatively low energy (compared to the lattice enthalpy) to remove the extra <b>valence</b> <b>electrons</b> to form a positive ion.2) Because of their tendency either to gain the missing <b>valence</b> <b>electrons</b> (thereby forming a negative ion), or to share <b>valence</b> <b>electrons</b> (thereby forming a covalent bond).|$|R
50|$|Core {{electrons}} are {{the electrons}} in an atom {{that are not}} <b>valence</b> <b>electrons</b> and therefore {{do not participate in}} bonding. The number of <b>valence</b> <b>electrons</b> of an element can be determined by the periodic table group of the element. With the exception of the transition metals in groups 3-12 and the Lanthanide and Actinide series, the number of <b>valence</b> <b>electrons</b> ranges from 0-8 electrons. All the non-valence electrons for an atom of that element are considered core electrons.Core electrons are tightly bound to the nucleus. Therefore, unlike <b>valence</b> <b>electrons</b> the core electrons play a secondary role in chemical bonding and reactions by screening the positive charge of the atomic nucleus from the <b>valence</b> shell of <b>electrons.</b> In transition metals, the distinction between core and <b>valence</b> <b>electrons</b> is less distinct with electrons in the highest d-shell acting more like <b>valence</b> <b>electrons</b> than core electrons.|$|R
5|$|The {{noble gases}} have full <b>valence</b> <b>electron</b> shells. Valence {{electrons}} are the outermost electrons of an atom and are normally the only electrons that participate in chemical bonding. Atoms with full <b>valence</b> <b>electron</b> shells are extremely stable and therefore do not tend to form chemical bonds and have little tendency to gain or lose electrons. However, heavier noble gases such as radon are held less firmly together by electromagnetic force than lighter noble gases such as helium, {{making it easier}} to remove outer electrons from heavy noble gases.|$|E
5|$|As {{described}} in the mathematical derivation below, the X-ray scattering {{is determined by the}} density of electrons within the crystal. Since the energy of an X-ray is much greater than that of a <b>valence</b> <b>electron,</b> the scattering may be modeled as Thomson scattering, the interaction of an electromagnetic ray with a free electron. This model is generally adopted to describe the polarization of the scattered radiation.|$|E
5|$|Francium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolFr and atomic number87. It {{used to be}} known as eka-caesium and actinium K. It is the second-least electronegative element, behind only caesium, and is the second rarest naturally occurring element (after astatine). Francium is a highly radioactive metal that decays into astatine, radium, and radon. As an alkali metal, it has one <b>valence</b> <b>electron.</b>|$|E
5000|$|For example, when silicon (Si), having four <b>valence</b> <b>electrons,</b> {{needs to}} be doped as a n-type semiconductor, {{elements}} from group V like phosphorus (P) or arsenic (As) can be used because they have five <b>valence</b> <b>electrons.</b> A dopant with five <b>valence</b> <b>electrons</b> is also called a pentavalent impurity. [...] Other pentavalent dopants are antimony (Sb) and bismuth (Bi).|$|R
25|$|This method {{begins with}} {{locating}} the central atom on {{the periodic table}} and determining the number of its <b>valence</b> <b>electrons.</b> One counts <b>valence</b> <b>electrons</b> for main group elements differently from transition metals.|$|R
50|$|<b>Valence</b> <b>{{electrons}}</b> are {{the electrons}} in the outermost electron shell of an isolated atom of an element. Sometimes, {{it is also}} regarded {{as the basis of}} Modern Periodic Table. In a period, the number of <b>valence</b> <b>electrons</b> increases (mostly for light metal/elements) as we move from left to right side. However, in a group this periodic trend is constant, that is the number of <b>valence</b> <b>electrons</b> remains the same.|$|R
5|$|Hydrogen, {{like the}} alkali metals, has one <b>valence</b> <b>electron</b> and reacts easily with the halogens, but the {{similarities}} end {{there because of}} the small size of a bare proton H+ compared to the alkali metal cations. Its placement above lithium is primarily due to its electron configuration. It is sometimes placed above carbon due to their similar electronegativities or fluorine due to their similar chemical properties.|$|E
5|$|Although usually trivalent, {{ytterbium}} readily forms divalent compounds. This {{behavior is}} unusual for lanthanides, which almost exclusively form compounds with an oxidation state of +3. The +2 {{state has a}} <b>valence</b> <b>electron</b> configuration of 4f14 because the fully filled f-shell gives more stability. The yellow-green ytterbium(II) ion {{is a very strong}} reducing agent and decomposes water, releasing hydrogen gas, and thus only the colorless ytterbium(III) ion occurs in aqueous solution. Samarium and thulium also behave this way in the +2 state, but europium(II) is stable in aqueous solution. Ytterbium metal behaves similarly to europium metal and the alkaline earth metals, dissolving in ammonia to form blue electride salts.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{relativistic}} {{stabilization of}} flerovium's 7s27p <b>valence</b> <b>electron</b> configuration, the 0 oxidation state {{should also be}} more stable for flerovium than for lead, as the 7p1/2 electrons begin to also exhibit a mild inert pair effect: this stabilization of the neutral state may bring about some similarities between the behaviour of flerovium and the noble gas radon. Due to the expected relative inertness of flerovium, its diatomic compounds FlH and FlF should have lower energies of dissociation than the corresponding lead compounds PbH and PbF. Flerovium(IV) should be even more electronegative than lead(IV); lead(IV) has electronegativity 2.33 on the Pauling scale; the lead(II) value is only 1.87.|$|E
50|$|Fe has 8 <b>valence</b> <b>electrons.</b>|$|R
50|$|Most {{metal carbonyls}} have 18 <b>valence</b> <b>{{electrons}},</b> and Fe(CO)5 fits this pattern with 8 <b>valence</b> <b>electrons</b> on Fe and five pairs of electrons {{provided by the}} CO ligands. Reflecting its symmetrical structure and charge neutrality, Fe(CO)5 is volatile; {{it is one of}} the most frequently encountered liquid metal complexes.|$|R
50|$|A {{semiconductor}} has {{an electrical}} conductivity that is intermediate between {{that of a}} metal and that of a nonmetal; a semiconductor also differs from a metal in that a semiconductor's conductivity increases with temperature. The typical elemental semiconductors are silicon and germanium, each atom of which has four <b>valence</b> <b>electrons.</b> The properties of semiconductors are best explained using band theory, {{as a consequence of}} a small energy gap between a valence band (which contains the <b>valence</b> <b>electrons</b> at absolute zero) and a conduction band (to which <b>valence</b> <b>electrons</b> are excited by thermal energy).|$|R
5|$|Francium is an {{alkali metal}} whose {{chemical}} properties mostly {{resemble those of}} caesium. A heavy element with a single <b>valence</b> <b>electron,</b> it has the highest equivalent weight of any element. Liquid francium—if created—should have a surface tension of 0.05092N/m at its melting point. Francium's melting point was calculated to be around 27°C (80°F, 300K). The melting point is uncertain because of the element's extreme rarity and radioactivity. Thus, the estimated boiling point value of 677°C (1250°F, 950K) is also uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{predictions}} of the chemical properties of rutherfordium were based on calculations which indicated that the relativistic effects on the electron shell might be strong enough that the 7p orbitals would have a lower energy level than the 6d orbitals, giving it a <b>valence</b> <b>electron</b> configuration of 6d1 7s2 7p1 or even 7s2 7p2, therefore making the element behave more like lead than hafnium. With better calculation methods and experimental studies of the chemical properties of rutherfordium compounds it could be shown that this does not happen and that rutherfordium instead behaves {{like the rest of}} the group 4 elements.|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} and chemical properties of the alkali metals can be readily explained by their having an ns1 <b>valence</b> <b>electron</b> configuration, which results in weak metallic bonding. Hence, all the alkali metals are soft and have low densities, melting and boiling points, as well as heats of sublimation, vaporisation, and dissociation. They all crystallise in the body-centered cubic crystal structure, and have distinctive flame colours because their outer s electron is very easily excited. The ns1 configuration also results in the alkali metals having very large atomic and ionic radii, as well as very high thermal and electrical conductivity. Their chemistry is dominated by the loss of their lone <b>valence</b> <b>electron</b> in the outermost s-orbital to form the +1 oxidation state, due to the ease of ionising this electron and the very high second ionisation energy. Most of the chemistry has been observed only for the first five members of the group. The chemistry of francium is not well established due to its extreme radioactivity; thus, the presentation of its properties here is limited. What little is known about francium shows that it is very close in behaviour to caesium, as expected. The physical properties of francium are even sketchier because the bulk element has never been observed; hence any data that may be found in the literature are certainly speculative extrapolations.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{electrons}} in an electrically neutral atom increases with the atomic number. The electrons in the outermost shell, or <b>valence</b> <b>electrons,</b> {{tend to be}} responsible for an element's chemical behavior. Elements that contain the same number of <b>valence</b> <b>electrons</b> can be grouped together and display similar chemical properties.|$|R
50|$|For example, when silicon (Si), having four <b>valence</b> <b>electrons,</b> {{needs to}} be doped as a p-type semiconductor, {{elements}} from group III like boron (B) or aluminium (Al), having three <b>valence</b> <b>electrons,</b> can be used. The latter elements are also called trivalent impurities. Other trivalent dopants include indium (In) and gallium (Ga).|$|R

5|$|The {{position}} of unbiunium in {{the periodic table}} suggests {{that it would have}} similar properties to its lighter congeners, scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, and actinium; however, relativistic effects may cause some of its properties to differ from those expected from a straight application of periodic trends. For example, unbiunium is expected to have a s2p <b>valence</b> <b>electron</b> configuration instead of the s2d of its lighter congeners in group 3, but this is not expected to significantly affect its chemistry, which is predicted to be that of a normal group 3 element; it would on the other hand significantly lower its first ionisation energy beyond what would be expected from periodic trends.|$|E
5|$|Boron is {{a useful}} dopant for such {{semiconductors}} as silicon, germanium, and silicon carbide. Having one fewer <b>valence</b> <b>electron</b> than the host atom, it donates a hole resulting in p-type conductivity. Traditional method of introducing boron into semiconductors is via its atomic diffusion at high temperatures. This process uses either solid (B2O3), liquid (BBr3), or gaseous boron sources (B2H6 or BF3). However, after the 1970s, it was mostly replaced by ion implantation, which relies mostly on BF3 as a boron source. Boron trichloride gas {{is also an important}} chemical in semiconductor industry, however not for doping but rather for plasma etching of metals and their oxides. Triethylborane is also injected into vapor deposition reactors as a boron source. Examples are the plasma deposition of boron-containing hard carbon films, silicon nitride-boron nitride films, and for doping of diamond film with boron.|$|E
5|$|Like most lanthanides, {{praseodymium}} {{usually only}} uses three electrons as valence electrons, as afterwards the remaining 4f electrons are too strongly bound: {{this is because}} the 4f orbitals penetrate the most through the inert xenon core of electrons to the nucleus, followed by 5d and 6s, and this increases with higher ionic charge. Praseodymium nevertheless can continue losing a fourth and even occasionally a fifth <b>valence</b> <b>electron</b> because it comes very early in the lanthanide series, where the nuclear charge is still low enough and the 4f subshell energy high enough to allow the removal of further valence electrons. Thus, similarly to the other early trivalent lanthanides, praseodymium has a double hexagonal close-packed crystal structure at room temperature. At about 560°C, it transitions to a face-centered cubic structure, and a body-centered cubic structure appears shortly before the melting point of 935°C.|$|E
5000|$|Donor {{impurity}} atoms {{have more}} <b>valence</b> <b>electrons</b> than the atoms they replace in the intrinsic semiconductor lattice. Donor impurities [...] "donate" [...] their extra <b>valence</b> <b>electrons</b> to a semiconductor's conduction band, providing excess electrons to the intrinsic semiconductor. Excess electrons increase the electron carrier concentration (n0) of the semiconductor, making it n-type.|$|R

5|$|Synthetic diamond has {{potential}} uses as a semiconductor, {{because it can}} be doped with impurities like boron and phosphorus. Since these elements contain one more or one less <b>valence</b> <b>electron</b> than carbon, they turn synthetic diamond into p-type or n-type semiconductor. Making a p–n junction by sequential doping of synthetic diamond with boron and phosphorus produces light-emitting diodes (LEDs) producing UV light of 235nm. Another useful property of synthetic diamond for electronics is high carrier mobility, which reaches 4500cm2/(V·s) for electrons in single-crystal CVD diamond. High mobility is favourable for high-frequency operation and field-effect transistors made from diamond have already demonstrated promising high-frequency performance above 50GHz. The wide band gap of diamond (5.5 eV) gives it excellent dielectric properties. Combined with the high mechanical stability of diamond, those properties are being used in prototype high-power switches for power stations.|$|E
5|$|Cerium is {{the second}} element of the {{lanthanide}} series. In the periodic table, it appears between the lanthanides lanthanum to its left and praseodymium to its right, and above the actinide thorium. It is a ductile metal with a hardness {{similar to that of}} silver. Its 58 electrons are arranged in the configuration 4f15d16s2, of which the four outer electrons are valence electrons. Immediately after lanthanum, the 4f orbitals suddenly contract and are lowered in energy {{to the point that they}} participate readily in chemical reactions; however, this effect is not yet strong enough at cerium and thus the 5d subshell is still occupied. Most lanthanides can use only three electrons as valence electrons, as afterwards the remaining 4f electrons are too strongly bound: cerium is an exception because of the stability of the empty f-shell in Ce4+ and the fact that it comes very early in the lanthanide series, where the nuclear charge is still low enough until neodymium to allow the removal of the fourth <b>valence</b> <b>electron.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{francium}} is {{the heaviest}} alkali metal {{that has been}} discovered, {{there has been some}} theoretical work predicting the physical and chemical characteristics of the hypothetical heavier alkali metals. Being the first period 8 element, the undiscovered element ununennium (element 119) is predicted to be the next alkali metal after francium and behave much like their lighter congeners; however, it is also predicted to differ from the lighter alkali metals in some properties. Its chemistry is predicted to be closer to that of potassium or rubidium instead of caesium or francium. This is unusual as periodic trends, ignoring relativistic effects would predict ununennium to be even more reactive than caesium and francium. This lowered reactivity is due to the relativistic stabilisation of ununennium's <b>valence</b> <b>electron,</b> increasing ununennium's first ionisation energy and decreasing the metallic and ionic radii; this effect is already seen for francium. This assumes that ununennium will behave chemically as an alkali metal, which, although likely, may not be true due to relativistic effects. The relativistic stabilisation of the 8s orbital also increases ununennium's electron affinity far beyond that of caesium and francium; indeed, ununennium is expected to have an electron affinity higher than all the alkali metals lighter than it. Relativistic effects also cause a very large drop in the polarisability of ununennium. On the other hand, ununennium is predicted to continue the trend of melting points decreasing going down the group, being expected to have a melting point between 0°C and 30°C.|$|E
50|$|The many {{electron}} Schrödinger equation can be {{very much}} simplified if electrons are divided in two groups: <b>valence</b> <b>electrons</b> and inner core electrons. The electrons in the inner shells are strongly bound and do not {{play a significant role}} in the chemical binding of atoms; they also partially screen the nucleus, thus forming with the nucleus an almost inert core. Binding properties are almost completely due to the <b>valence</b> <b>electrons,</b> especially in metals and semiconductors.This separation suggests that inner electrons can be ignored in a large number of cases, thereby reducing the atom to an ionic core that interacts with the <b>valence</b> <b>electrons.</b> The use of an effective interaction, a pseudopotential, that approximates the potential felt by the <b>valence</b> <b>electrons,</b> was first proposed by Fermi in 1934 and Hellmann in 1935. In spite of the simplification pseudo-potentials introduce in calculations, they remained forgotten until the late 50s.|$|R
