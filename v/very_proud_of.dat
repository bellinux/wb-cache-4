5|$|Despite the {{circumstances}} of the separation, Holopainen's appreciation of Turunen as an artist remained.

She considers the remaining band members extremely talented and wishes all the best for them and their subsequent lead singer Anette Olzon.|$|E

5|$|After their 1908–12 trip, {{the couple}} stopped {{exploring}} {{and turned to}} writing and lecturing, {{primarily because of the}} onset of World War I in 1914. Fanny Workman became the first American woman to lecture at the Sorbonne in Paris. She {{was also one of the}} first women admitted as a member of the Royal Geographical Society, a distinction she earned because her publications included scientific reflections on glaciation and other phenomena. She also earned medals of honor from 10 European geographical societies and was eventually elected a member of the American Alpine Club, Royal Asiatic Society, Club Alpino Italiano, Deutscher und Österreichischer Alpenverein, and Club alpin français.

5|$|Writer Howard Gordon {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the episode while he was walking down the streets of New York and noticed several stone gargoyles on the corner staring at him.

The two worked on the script over the weekend to add more psychological aspects to the episode. Gordon claimed to be <b>very</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> the final product. Assistant Art Director Gary Allen drew the gargoyle sketches used in this episode.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{performs}} a one-man show on Broadway {{so that he}} can be considered for a Tony Award as part of his EGOT quest. His show receives positive reviews, and Tracy is convinced that he will win a Tony, but Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) tells him that in order for him to qualify for the award he must do his one-man show eight times, which worries Tracy, as he is unable to perform anything the same way twice. Despite initial reluctance to help him, Jenna eventually agrees to coach Tracy in the principles of acting, but this leads nowhere, resulting in the two arguing and Jenna telling him he can go on his show and read the phone book for all she cares. At the end of the episode, Tracy does read the phone book at his show, making Jenna <b>very</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> him, and inexplicably drawing high praise from the audience.|$|E

[...] "The King of all the Frogs was twice as big as any other Frog, and his tail was three times as long.

5|$|When he was {{fourteen}} {{he was sent}} to Winchester College, which was known as both the most academic of the main public schools and also for its discomfort. Schuster's time at St George's had prepared him for discomfort, however, and he was noted as being <b>very</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> attending the school. While at Winchester Schuster played Winchester College football and was occasionally involved in debates; he was not, however, noted as a particularly exceptional pupil. He matriculated at New College, Oxford in 1888 and graduated with a second-class degree in history in 1892; again he was not noted as a particularly outstanding student, which was attributed to the time he spent enjoying himself rather than studying. Despite his lack of academic brilliance he was invited to present the Romanes Lecture in 1949, an honour normally only given to the most eminent alumni of Oxford. After graduation, he applied to become a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford but was rejected.|$|E

50|$|Adams {{recalled}} 1964 as a <b>very</b> <b>proud</b> moment <b>of</b> her life. The Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) {{recognized that}} the convention wasn’t helping with their representation problems. The convention presented the MFDP with “meaningless” compromises at which Adams proudly didn’t accept. She also {{said that one of}} the most significant lessons learned from the 1964 convention was that when people are presented with the resources such as education, people are able to organize around an issue in order to create change.|$|R

[...] Gatting also reflected later that 'it wasn't a <b>very</b> <b>proud</b> moment <b>of</b> my career.' He also admitted that, whatever the official reason given, it was the real reason why he lost the England captaincy the following summer.

25|$|I am <b>very</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> the 19 wickets I took {{against the}} Rest of the World, even though, laughably, {{they have now}} been officially deducted from my Test playing record.

25|$|It sort of is {{a little}} puzzle and I guess it goes by - but they're all great things. 'I won't stop doing {{beautiful}} things and I won't do bad things.' It's very noble. I'm <b>very</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> that song because it's very much like {{out of the world}} of Excalibur. To me, it's like Sir Lancelot or something - very noble and chivalrous. That's my favorite song on the record - it's very ambitious.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; {{they gave}} that up, for my boy wouldn't wear a night-gown in public.

60|$|The urchin {{had found}} out that when once Cherry's crutch was out of her reach she could not get at him; and he had ridden off upon it so often, before {{committing}} any of his worst misdemeanours, that Cherry always lay down on it to secure it.

50|$|At Salamis {{the ashes}} of the {{deceased}} are also wrapped into a cloth and deposited into a bronze cauldron. Therefore, the Cypriots along with their extravagant display of wealth that bears many oriental features, do not forget their roots for which they must have been <b>very</b> <b>proud.</b> The circulation <b>of</b> the Homeric poems must have revived the interest in their ancestors whose system of government they never lost sight of.|$|R
5000|$|Che Copete: A stereotypical Argentine {{character}} who resembles an old-fashioned tango singer. He is <b>very</b> arrogant and <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> his country (and often tends {{to exaggerate the}} quality of it or himself), yet he is friendly and good-natured.
