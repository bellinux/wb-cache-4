25|$|Shiprock is {{composed}} of fractured volcanic breccia and black dikes of igneous rock called minette, or lamprophyre. It is the erosional remnant of the throat of a volcano, and the volcanic breccia formed in a diatreme. The rock probably was originally formed 2,500–3,000 feet (750–1,000 meters) below the Earth's surface, but it was exposed after {{millions of years of}} erosion. Wall-like sheets of minette, known as dikes, radiate away from the central formation. Radiometric age determinations of the minette establish that these volcanic rocks solidified about 27 million years ago. Shiprock is in the northeastern part of the Navajo Volcanic Field—a field that includes intrusions and flows of minette and other unusual igneous rocks that formed about 30 million years ago. Agathla (El Capitan) in Monument Valley is another prominent <b>volcanic</b> <b>neck</b> in this volcanic field.|$|E

5000|$|Cabezon Peak {{is a large}} {{volcanic}} plug that is a prominent feature in northwestern New Mexico. It rises to 7,785 feet in elevation. [...] Cabezon Peak is two {{miles south of the}} old ghost town of Cabezon and the Rio Puerco. This <b>volcanic</b> <b>neck</b> is formed of basalt and is part of the Mount Taylor volcanic field. A <b>volcanic</b> <b>neck</b> or plug is formed when magma from an existing volcano solidifies in the pipe or neck and the surrounding sediment is eroded away. Marine Cretaceous rocks of the Mancos Shale and Point Lookout Sandstone are exposed around the base of Cabezon Peak.|$|E

5000|$|Boars Tusk is an {{isolated}} remnant {{of a long}} extinct volcano associated with the Leucite Hills to the east. Heavily eroded, {{all that remains of}} the volcano is part of the erosion resistant <b>volcanic</b> <b>neck</b> which is composed of the uncommon volcanic rock lamproite. Rock samples from Boars Tusk provided an age of 2.5 MA.|$|E
50|$|The Neck {{gets its}} {{name for the}} type of {{volcanic}} feature it is called a volcanic plug or a <b>volcanic</b> <b>neck.</b> These volcanic landforms are created when magma hardens within a vent on an active volcano. If a plug is preserved, erosion may remove the surrounding rock while the erosion-resistant plug remains, producing a distinctive landform.|$|E
25|$|Sydney {{is made up}} {{of mostly}} Triassic rock with some recent igneous dykes and <b>volcanic</b> <b>necks.</b> The Sydney Basin was formed when the Earth's crust expanded, subsided, and filled with {{sediment}} in the early Triassic period. The sand that was to become the sandstone of today was washed from Broken Hill and laid down about 200 million years ago. The sandstone has shale lenses and fossil riverbeds.|$|R
50|$|The bedrock is {{composed}} of Triassic Buntsandstein, so-called because it {{is composed}} of a multitude of different-coloured sandstones. The rolling hills that are caused by the nearly even erosion of the sandstones, are punctuated by steep basaltic outcrops, which are the remains of Neogene (Miocene) <b>volcanic</b> <b>necks</b> (i.e. the cone of the volcano has been eroded which left behind the harder central region (neck) where the magma previously {{made its way to}} the surface).|$|R
50|$|The area is predominately {{generally}} horizontal sandstone beds {{with some}} shale sequences of late Cretaceous and early Cenozoic age. A few {{areas of the}} section also have abundant <b>volcanic</b> <b>necks</b> and buttes, but due to the arid weather and soft sandstone, many of the rock formations of the area have eroded to form distinctive features of long cuestas, shallow canyons and valleys, narrow fan terraces, undulating plateaus, isolated mesas, steep hills, and some shale badlands.|$|R
50|$|The castle {{was built}} on a hill which had once been an ancient volcano. To be precise, it is the petrified remains of the {{solidified}} molten interior, a <b>volcanic</b> <b>neck</b> of a large stratovolcano that probably became extinct two or so million years ago, like other similar hills in north-central Europe. The peak is at 482 meters above sea level. The ancient basalt of the hill was used to build the castle.|$|E
50|$|Kronotsky (Кроноцкая сопка, Kronotskaya Sopka) {{is a major}} {{stratovolcano}} on Kamchatka Peninsula, Russia. It {{is located}} in Kronotsky Nature Reserve {{to the east of}} Lake Kronotskoye. It has a particularly symmetrical conical shape, comparable to Mount Fuji in Japan and to Mayon Volcano in the Philippines. The summit crater is plugged by a <b>volcanic</b> <b>neck,</b> and the summit itself is ice-capped. It exhibits the classic radial drainage pattern, extending downward from its crater. Kronotsky is considered {{to be one of the}} most scenic volcanos in Kamchatka.|$|E
5000|$|Picacho Peak State Park is a {{state park}} {{surrounding}} Picacho Peak in Picacho, Arizona. The park is located between Casa Grande and Tucson near Interstate 10 in Pinal County. Its centerpiece spire is visible from downtown Tucson, a distance of 45 mi. The summit rises to 3374 ft above mean sea level. Though appearing to be the remnant of a <b>volcanic</b> <b>neck,</b> it is now {{believed to be a}} tilted and eroded piece of rock overlain by a lava flow. The place name is redundant: [...] "picacho" [...] means [...] "big peak" [...] in Spanish.|$|E
50|$|North of the fault, Devonian {{lava flows}} and {{pyroclastic}} deposits slope gently down, thinning towards the north. These are in part overlain by Old Red Sandstone rocks formed {{later in the}} Devonian period. Because the deposits thin towards the north, and there are few signs of <b>volcanic</b> <b>necks</b> within the Ochil Hills themselves, {{it is thought that}} the eruptive centres were south of the fault, however these are buried deep beneath the Carboniferous rocks including coal measures which are found beneath the low-lying carse lands to the south.|$|R
5000|$|The Western Cascades {{are made}} up almost entirely of {{slightly}} deformed and partly altered volcanic flows and pyroclastic rocks which {{range in age from}} late Eocene to late Miocene. These rocks have been heavily dissected by erosion and the only evidence remaining of the many volcanoes from which they were erupted are occasional remnants of <b>volcanic</b> <b>necks</b> or plugs which mark former vents. There are also minor Pliocene to Pleistocene intracanyon lavas derived from the High Cascades or rare local vents.

50|$|The {{principal}} {{structure of}} the southeastern Datil-Mogollon area is a large central-type volcano, Mount Taylor, that rises to 11389 ft. It is surrounded by numerous smaller volcanic centers and <b>volcanic</b> <b>necks</b> with extensive lava-covered mesas and valleys to the south. The largest mesa is 46 mi long and about 23 mi wide, with an upper elevation of 1900 ft above the surrounding plain, and is capped with about 300 ft of lava. The ancient lava flows extend southward into the Mexican Highlands section of the Basin and Range Province and consequently that border of the Colorado Plateau Province is ill-defined.|$|R
50|$|Lion Rock is {{a natural}} {{formation}} dividing North and South Piha beaches. It is an eroded 16-million-year-old <b>volcanic</b> <b>neck,</b> named for its similarity to a lying male lion when viewed from the rear (shore side), Lion Rock is immediately visible to visitors as they descend along the only access road. Lion Rock has become iconic not only of Piha, but of Auckland's West Coast in general. It was featured on stamps {{as well as an}} Auckland phone book. In December 1919 a memorial to local sawmillers who served in World War One was unveiled on Lion Rock.|$|E
5000|$|The name {{changed from}} Snake Hill to Laurel Hill in 1926, when Hudson County {{freeholder}} Katherine Whelan Brown {{said that it}} was the [...] "crowning Laurel of Hudson County" [...] because of its prominence in the low lying meadowlands. The high bluff has recently been called 'Fraternity Rock' (because of the greek letters painted on it presumably by local college fraternities), and 'Graffiti Rock'. The term 'Long Neck', originally used to describe the shape of the land land between Pinhorne (now Penhorn) Creek and the Hackensack River, has been adapted to refer to the <b>volcanic</b> <b>neck</b> of the ridge.|$|E
50|$|A {{volcanic}} plug, {{also called}} a <b>volcanic</b> <b>neck</b> or lava neck, is a volcanic object created when magma hardens within a vent on an active volcano. When present, a plug can cause an extreme build-up of pressure if rising volatile-charged magma is trapped beneath it, {{and this can}} sometimes lead to an explosive eruption. Glacial erosion can lead to exposure of the plug on one side, while a long slope of material remains on the opposite side. Such landforms are called crag and tail. If a plug is preserved, erosion may remove the surrounding rock while the erosion-resistant plug remains, producing a distinctive upstanding landform.|$|E
40|$|Abstract From {{the western}} to {{southern}} part of Pangkajene area, a number of rising topography are shown on plain morphology in the Walanae Depression. This topography anomaly in the surrouding plain morphology which composed of volcanic products is interpreted as lava domes. This study aims to identify morphology and lithology of the lava domes in Pangkajene caldera. Based on field data, and analyses of topographic map and SRTM image, it is defined that geomorphological units of the Pangkajene Paleovolcanic consist of: 1) Pyroclastic mountains, 2) Lava-flow hills, 3) Lava domes, and 4) Alluvial plain. The lava domes lining in form of cone-shape hills from northwest to southwest. Geomorphological process developed is denudation which indicated by the irregular surface of the domes. Lithology of the lava domes include andesitic lava (Bulu Loa) and trachytic lava (Bulu Allakuang, Bulu Batulappa and Bulu Watangpulu). In some places among the trachytic lava domes, <b>volcanic</b> <b>necks</b> are exposed which intrude ignimbrites such as at Bulu Tinebbang, Bulu Kunyi and Bulu Batualong. Petrographic analysis on trachyte indicates porphyritic and trachytic textures which consists of feldspar phenocrysts (oligoclase, orthoclase, sanidine) biotite and hornblende; and groundmass (glass and feldspar microlites). The formation of the lava domes is in the latest phase of the volcanic eruption in Pangkajene caldera. It is interpreted that {{after the collapse of}} the caldera, the <b>volcanic</b> <b>necks</b> then exposed, and eruption in the opening spaces subsequently formed the andesitic and trachytic lava domes...|$|R
50|$|The {{field is}} located in {{southern}} Siberia, between the East Sayan Mountains and the Todzha basin. There it covers a surface area of 2000 km2 west of Lake Baikal, {{at an altitude of}} 2000 m. Volcanic landforms include cones, lava fields, tuyas, and other volcanic structures including scoria cones, <b>volcanic</b> dykes, <b>volcanic</b> <b>necks</b> and <b>volcanic</b> vents. Other landforms are cirques and U-shaped valleys left by previous glaciations. The Bii Khem river, a tributary of the Yenisei River, crosses the field. Politically the field belongs to the Tuva Republic of Russia, and is in a remote area where access is difficult. The volcanoes have been described in the 1850-1900 years.|$|R
40|$|Anatolia lies at {{the gateway}} from Asia into Europe and has {{frequently}} been favoured as a route for Early Pleistocene hominin dispersal. Although early hominins {{are known to have}} occupied Turkey, with numerous finds of Lower Palaeolithic artefacts documented, the chronology of their dispersal has little reliable stratigraphical or geochronological constraint, sites are rare, and the region's hominin history remains poorly understood as a result. Here, we present a Palaeolithic artefact, a hard-hammer flake, from fluvial sediments associated with the Early Pleistocene Gediz River of Western Turkey. This previously documented buried river terrace sequence provides a clear stratigraphical context for the find and affords opportunities for independent age estimation using the numerous basaltic lava flows that emanated from nearby <b>volcanic</b> <b>necks</b> and aperiodically encroached onto the contemporary valley floors.

5000|$|The use of Prudential's symbol, the Rock of Gibraltar, {{began after}} an {{advertising}} agent passed Laurel Hill, a <b>volcanic</b> <b>neck,</b> in Secaucus, New Jersey, {{on a train}} in the 1890s. [...] The related slogans [...] "Get a Piece of the Rock" [...] and [...] "Strength of Gibraltar" [...] are also still quite widely associated with Prudential, though current advertising uses neither of these. Through the years, the symbol went through various versions, but in 1989, a simplified pictogram symbol of the Rock of Gibraltar was adopted. It has been used ever since. The logotype was updated with a proprietary font in 1996. The font, Prudential Roman, was designed by Doyald Young and John March, based on the Century font family.|$|E

50|$|The Austrian naturalist and {{explorer}} Andreas Reischek named a lake in Fiordland after Thomas in 1887. Following his death, the executors of {{his estate}} gifted 100 acres (42 hectares) of land at Piha to the Auckland City Council; this was supplemented in 1963 by {{the gift of}} Lion Rock (Te Piha), an eroded 16-million-year-old <b>volcanic</b> <b>neck,</b> that was acquired by two of his sons, Acland and Norman, from Te Kawerau in 1941. These gifts were commemorated in 2008 with the naming of {{a part of the}} gift as the Sir Algernon Thomas Green. In 1968, largely on the initiative of Sir Douglas Robb, chancellor of the University of Auckland, the university's new biological sciences building was named in his honour. Following the subdivision of his garden, a road formed through the property (primarily through what had been his 'cow paddock') was named Withiel Drive in his memory, as was a 0.7 hectare reserve created around a remnant of the Maungawhau lava field, Withiel Thomas Park.|$|E
30|$|Garnet Ridge is a northeast-southwest {{trending}} ridge {{composed of}} the Jurassic Summerville Formation and Bluff sandstone in northern Arizona in {{the central part of}} the Navajo volcanic field (Switzer 1975). The Navajo volcanic field is characterized by mid-Tertiary <b>volcanic</b> <b>necks,</b> dikes, lavas, and various intrusions of alkali-rich mafic and ultramafic rocks (Roden et al. 1979; Semken 2003). A xenolith-rich kimberlitic diatreme associated with the Navajo volcanisms erupted through Garnet Ridge at ca. 30  Ma (Smith et al. 2004). Discrete garnet crystals (without surrounding rock matrix), garnet megacrysts, garnet aggregates, and garnet-bearing xenoliths (e.g., lawsonite-eclogite) are scattered on the ridge and the ground of the Carmel Formation and the Entrada sandstone surrounding Garnet Ridge (Watson and Morton 1969; Helmstaedt and Schulze 1988; Usui et al. 2003, 2006, 2007). This study is based on analyses of the discrete garnet crystals.|$|R
50|$|The Central Skåne Volcanic Province was {{a site of}} {{volcanic}} activity in the Scania region of Sweden during the Mesozoic Era of the Earth's geological history. The volcanism began with a first and main phase in late Sinemurian-Toarcian times. Then volcanism continued sporadically for another 80 million years. More than one hundred <b>volcanic</b> <b>necks</b> of basaltic composition exist in Scania evidencing this volcanism. In central Scania, volcanism was {{in the form of}} a volcanic field of cinder cones that had strombolian eruption styles. These cones produced tuffite deposits made largely of lapilli with rare volcanic bombs. Pyroclastic materials were subsequently palagonitized or largely altered to clay minerals. While eruptions occurred on land the sea was likely very close to the area. Besides purely pyroclastic sediments, lahar deposits have also been identified around the remnants of the volcanoes.|$|R
40|$|Interpretations of Mariner 9 and Viking {{images of}} the mottled plains in Mare Acidalium are present and discussed. Although the {{boundaries}} between all the units are gradational, four subdivisions were recognized within the mottled plains region. One of these subdivisions was designated hummocky mottled plains. The unit is characterized by many small (1 km), irregularly spaced dark hills surrounded by brighter material. One very poor-quality, high-resolution Viking strip (528 B 01 - 04) indicates {{that some of these}} dark hills have circular summit depressions. Possible interpretations of origin of these hills include: cinder cones, volcanic domes, maar volcanoes, pseudocraters, impact craters, or pingos. The uncratered hills or knobs may be igneous plugs, <b>volcanic</b> <b>necks,</b> or the dark remnants of a hummocky, cratered surface protruding through a relatively bright eolian blanket. The presence, however, of the small dark hills on the flow of the large (130 km diameter) C(2) crater Lomonosov, suggests that similar dark hills elsewhere also may be secondary...|$|R
