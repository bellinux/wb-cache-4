40|$|Background/Aim. Transesophageal {{echocardiography}} (TEE) is {{a relatively}} new diagnostic method offering better resolution of cardiac anatomy than the conventional transthoracal two-dimensional echocardiography (TTE). Clinical indications for TEE have been expanding, thus the technique as a diagnostic procedure is used in numerous cardiac diseases such as endocarditis, congenital heart defect, aortic dissection, prosthetic valves dysfunction, as well as in calculation of aortic valve surface in aortic stenosis. The aim {{of the study was to}} prove TEE as a more precise method in determination of the level of seriousness of aortic valve stenosis. Methods. All the patients went through TTE and TEE. Evaluating of the aortic valve surface was performed by the use of Gorlin's formula in TTE while it was planimetric in TEE examination. Results. Comparative analysis of all parameters obtained by TTE and TEE showed a difference between them. All the parameters values except that for surface area of the aortic valve orifice confluence were higher in TEE than in TTE examination, but no difference was statistically significant (p > 0. 05; t-test for a dependant specimens). By the use of the TTE method, the size of aortic orifice stenosis was 1. 22 ± 0. 54 cm 2, and by the TEE method it was 1. 08 ± 0. 54 cm 2. Conclusion.

40|$|Bicuspid {{aortic valve}} (BAV) {{is the most}} common {{congenital}} <b>valvular</b> <b>defect</b> and is associated with ascending aortic dilation (AAD) in a quarter of patients. AAD has been ascribed both to the hemodynamic consequences of normally functioning and abnormal BAV morphology, and to the effect of rare and common genetic variation upon function of the ascending aortic media. AAD manifests in two overall and sometimes overlapping phenotypes: that of aortic root aneurysm, similar to the AAD of Marfan syndrome; and that of tubular AAD, similar to the AAD seen with tricuspid aortic valves (TAVs). These aortic phenotypes appear to be independent of BAV phenotype, have different embryologic origins and have unique etiologic factors, notably, regarding the role of hemodynamic changes inherent to the BAV phenotype. Further, in contrast to Marfan syndrome, the AAD seen with BAV is infrequently present as a strongly inherited syndromic phenotype; rather, {{it appears to be a}} less-penetrant, milder phenotype. Both reduced levels of normally functioning transcriptional proteins and structurally abnormal proteins have been observed in aneurysmal aortic media. We provide evidence that aortic root AAD has a stronger genetic etiology, sometimes related to identified common non-coding fibrillin- 1 (FBN 1) variants and other aortic wall protein variants in patients with BAV. In patients with BAV having tubular AAD, we propose a stronger hemodynamic influence, but with pathology still based on a functional deficit of the aortic media, of genetic or epigenetic etiology. Although it is an attractive hypothesis to ascribe common mechanisms to BAV and AAD, thus far the genetic etiologies of AAD have not been associated to the genetic etiologies of BAV, notably, not including BAV variants in NOTCH 1 and GATA 4...|$|E

40|$|Bicuspid {{aortic valve}} (BAV) {{is the most}} {{prevalent}} human congenital cardiac malformation. It may appear isolated, associated with other cardiovascular malformations, or forming part of syndromes. Cranial neural crest (NC) defects {{are supposed to be}} the cause of the spectrum of disorders associated with syndromic BAV. Experimental studies with an inbred hamster model of isolated BAV showed that alterations in the migration or differentiation of the cardiac NC cells in the embryonic cardiac outflow tract are most probably responsible for the development of this congenital <b>valvular</b> <b>defect.</b> We hypothesize that isolated BAV is not the result of local, but of early alterations in the behavior of the NC cells, thus also affecting other cranial NC-derived structures. Therefore, we tested whether morphological variation of the aortic valve is linked to phenotypic variation of the mandible and the thymus in the hamster model of isolated BAV, compared to a control strain. Our results show significant differences in {{the size and shape of}} the mandible as well as in the cellular composition of the thymus between the two strains, and in mandible shape regarding the morphology of the aortic valve. Given that both the mandible and the thymus are cranial NC derivatives, and that the cardiac NC belongs to the cephalic domain, we propose that the causal defect leading to isolated BAV during embryonic development is not restricted to local alterations of the cardiac NC cells in the cardiac outflow tract, but it is of pleiotropic or polytopic nature. Our results suggest that isolated BAV may be the forme fruste of a polytopic syndrome involving the cranial NC in the hamster model and in a proportion of affected patients...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Chronic {{heart failure}} is a {{worldwide}} cause of mortality and morbidity {{and is the}} final outcome {{of a number of}} different etiologies. This reflects both the complexity of the disease and our incomplete understanding of its underlying molecular mechanisms. One experimental approach to address this is to study subcellular organelles and how their functions are activated and synchronized under physiological and pathological conditions. In this review, we discuss the application of proteomic technologies to organelles and how this has deepened our perception of the cellular proteome and its alterations with heart failure. The use of proteomics to monitor protein quantity and posttranslational modifications has revealed a highly intricate and sophisticated level of protein regulation. Posttranslational modifications have the potential to regulate organelle function and interplay most likely by targeting both structural and signaling proteins throughout the cell, ultimately coordinating their responses. The potentials and limitations of existing proteomic technologies are also discussed emphasizing that the development of novel methods will enhance our ability to further investigate organelles and decode intracellular communication.

Several type I receptors (ALKs) for members of the TGF-β superfamily are expressed in the myocardium and endocardium of the developing heart, including the atrioventricular canal. However, analysis of their functional role during mammalian development has been significantly complicated by the fact that deletion of the type I receptors in mouse embryos often leads to early embryonal lethality. Here, we used the Cre/loxP system for endothelial-specific deletion of the type I receptor Alk 2 in mouse embryos. The endothelial-specific Alk 2 mutant mice display defects in atrioventricular septa and valves, which result from a failure of endocardial cells to appropriately transdifferentiate into the mesenchyme in the AV canal. Endocardial cells deficient in Alk 2 demonstrate decreased expression of Msx 1 and Snail, and reduced phosphorylation of BMP and TGF-β Smads. Moreover, we show that endocardial cells lacking Alk 2 fail to delaminate from AV canal explants. Collectively, these results indicate that the BMP type I receptor ALK 2 in endothelial cells plays a critical non-redundant role in early phases of endocardial cushion formation during cardiac morphogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Formation of {{the cardiac}} valves is an {{essential}} component of cardiovascular development. Consistent with the role of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway in cardiac valve formation, embryos that are deficient for the BMP regulator BMPER (BMP-binding endothelial regulator) display the cardiac valve anomaly mitral valve prolapse. However, how BMPER deficiency leads to this defect is unknown. Based on its expression pattern in the developing cardiac cushions, we hypothesized that BMPER regulates BMP 2 -mediated signaling, leading to fine-tuned epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and extracellular matrix deposition. In the BMPER-/- embryo, EMT is dysregulated in the atrioventricular and outflow tract cushions compared with their wild-type counterparts, as indicated by a significant increase of Sox 9 -positive cells during cushion formation. However, proliferation is not impaired in the developing BMPER-/- valves. In vitro data show that BMPER directly binds BMP 2. In cultured endothelial cells, BMPER blocks BMP 2 -induced Smad activation in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, BMP 2 increases the Sox 9 protein level, and this increase is inhibited by co-treatment with BMPER. Consistently, in the BMPER-/- embryos, semi-quantitative analysis of Smad activation shows that the canonical BMP pathway is significantly more active in the atrioventricular cushions during EMT. These results indicate that BMPER negatively regulates BMP-induced Smad and Sox 9 activity during valve development. Together, these results identify BMPER as a regulator of BMP 2 -induced cardiac valve development and will contribute to our understanding of <b>valvular</b> <b>defects...</b>|$|R

Several cardiac defects have also been reported, including ventricular/atrial septal defects, atresia, hypoplastic right heart syndrome, patent ductus arteriosus, and conotruncal or <b>valvular</b> cardiac <b>defects.</b> Tetrasomy X patients also appear to be more prone to seizure activity, although there is no documented abnormalities in brain function or structure when analyzed using an EEG or MRI.|$|R
40|$|Objective: {{to compare}} the {{efficiency}} of using the values of transpulmonary (PiCCO) and prepulmonary (Swan-Ganz catheter) thermodilution as guides to targeted therapy for hemodynamic disorders in the surgical correction of mixed cardiac <b>valvular</b> <b>defects.</b> Subjects and methods. The study enrolled 40 patients operated on for acquired cardiac diseases who were randomized to two matched groups. Hemodynamics was monitored {{by means of a}} Swan-Ganz catheter in Group 1 and by transpulmonary thermodilution in Group 2. Anesthesia was maintained with propofol and fentanyl. Infusion therapy was performed using crystalloid and colloid solutions. Continuous intravenous infusion of inotropic agents was used when heart failure was developed. Hemodynamic, clinical, and laboratory parameters were estimated intraoperatively and within 24 hours postoperatively. Results. The groups did not differ in the degree of baseline heart failure, the duration of an operation and myocardial ischemia, and the length of extracorporeal circulation. In the PiCCO group, postoperative infusion volume was 33 % higher than that in the Swan-Ganz group, which ensured increases in stroke volume and oxygen delivery in the early postoperative period (p< 0. 05). Respiratory support was 26 % shorter in the PiCCO group (p< 0. 04). Conclusion. After surgical interventions for mixed cardiac defects, the targeted therapy algorithm based on transpulmonary thermodilution provided more steady-state values of hemodynamics and oxygen transport, which was followed by the increased scope of infusion therapy and the shorter length of postoperative mechanical ventilation than that based on hemodynamics being corrected from the values of prepul-monary thermodilution.

40|$|Purpose: To {{identify}} dose-heart-volume {{constraints that}} correlate with {{the risk of}} developing asymptomatic <b>valvular</b> <b>defects</b> (VD) in Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) patients treated with three-dimensional radiotherapy (RT). Patients and methods: Fifty-six patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy (CHT) and involved-field radiation treatment for HL were retrospectively analyzed. Electro-echocardiography was performed before CHT, after CHT, and after RT. For the entire heart, for right and left ventricle (RV, LV), right and left atrium (RA, LA) percentage of volume exceeding 5 - 30 Gy in increment of 5 Gy (V x), and dosimetric parameters were calculated using 1. 6 Gy fraction as reference. To evaluate clinical and dosimetric factors possibly associated with VD, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. Results: At a median follow up of 70. 5 months, 32. 1 % of patients developed VD (regurgitation and/or stenosis) : 25. 0 % developed mitral, 5. 4 % developed aortic, and 14. 3 % tricuspid VD. In particular the percentage of LA exceeding 25 Gy (LA-V 25) and the percentage of LV exceeding 30 Gy (LV-V 30) correlated with mitral and aortic VD with an odds ratio (OR) of 5. 7 (LA-V 25 > 63. 0 % vs. LA-V 25 ≤ 63. 0 %) and OR of 4. 4 (LV-V 30 > 25 % vs. LV-V 30 ≤ 25 %), respectively. RV-V 30 correlated with tricuspid VD (OR = 7. 2, RV-V 30 > 65 % vs. RV-V 30 ≤ 65 %). Conclusion: LA-V 25, LV- and RV-V 30 prove to be predictors of asymptomatic alteration of valve functionality...|$|R
40|$|Cardiac {{surgery is}} the only radical method of {{treatment}} of <b>valvular</b> <b>defects</b> (congenital or acquired) : valve preservation procedures or prosthetics operations. 250 000 – 280 000 valve prostheses are implanted every year worldwide, {{while the number of}} prosthetic valves operation increases by an average of 5 – 7 % per year (biological prostheses – 8 – 11 %, mechanical prostheses – 3 – 5 %). Selection of biological or mechanical types of prosthesis, its location, the presence of associated risk factors for embolic events, such as atrial fibrillation, previous embolism, left ventricular dysfunction, hypercoagulable states determine patient management tactics. Particularly high risk of prosthetic thrombosis and thromboembolic complications can be seen in case of mechanical prosthesis implantation. Numerous prospective and retrospective clinical studies have proven high effectiveness of anticoagulants for reduction the risk of cardioembolic complications. The degree of anticoagulation (optimal international normalized ratio (INR)) is determined by risk factors for prosthetic thrombosis and thromboembolic complications in a patient, as well as thrombogenicity of the prosthesis by itself; INR may range from 2. 5 to 4. 0. International recommendations take into account the presence/absence of additional risk factors for thromboembolism, and based on warfarin administration with the achievement of target INR values combined with low-dose aspirin. Administration of novel direct oral anticoagulation remedies in patients with prosthetic heart valves has not been studied sufficiently up to date and is contraindicated. Thus, warfarin currently is a drug of choice for the prevention of thromboembolic complications in patients with prosthetic heart valves...|$|R
