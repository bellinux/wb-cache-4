50|$|Additional engine changes {{include a}} lighter {{camshaft}} sprocket and increased valve spring pressure (two springs per intake valve) which allow for higher revving. There are new piston rings that slide with less friction and increased internal engine oil flow. Redline is now 14,200 rpm, 700 rpm {{higher than the}} previous year's F4. To increase the bike's pulling capabilities at high speeds, 5th and 6th gears have been shortened slightly and the rear sprocket was enlarged from 45 teeth to 46.Also adding one clutch plate for greater durability to now making 8. The oiling holes in the camshafts have been enlarged by 0.5 mm (to 2.5 mm) and piston ring friction has been decreased to aid cooling at the higher rev ceiling. Spring pressures on the intake and exhaust valves have been increased to avoid valve float. Also, there are now two <b>valve</b> <b>springs</b> (<b>inner</b> and outer) on the intake side instead of the single item that resides on the exhaust side.|$|R

40|$|To recycle the {{vibration}} energy of vehicles over rough roads, a hydraulic-electricity energy regenerative suspension (HEERS) was {{designed in the}} present work, and simulations were performed with focus on its performance. On {{the basis of the}} system principle, the mathematical model of hydraulic-electrical energy regenerative absorber (HEERA) and two degrees of freedom (DOF) suspension dynamic model were constructed. Using the model of HEERA, simulations on force-displacement and force-velocity characteristics were performed with a 1. 67 Hz frequency and a sinusoidal input adopted. And then in combination with HEERA model and two DOF suspension models, simulations on the performance of HEERS also were carried out. Finally, the influences of charging pressure and volume of the accumulator, hydraulic motor displacement, orifice area of check <b>valve,</b> and <b>inner</b> diameter of hydraulic pipelines on the performance of HEERA and HEERS were investigated in depth. The simulation results indicated that (i) the damping characteristic of HEERA was coincident with the damping characteristics of traditional absorber; (ii) the most remarkable influencing factor on the performance of HEERS was the hydraulic motor displacement, followed by orifice area of check <b>valve,</b> <b>inner</b> diameter of pipelines, and charging pressure of accumulator, while the effects of charging volume of accumulator were quite limited...|$|R
