25|$|All {{sources of}} {{electrical}} power have {{some degree of}} variability, as do demand patterns which routinely drive large swings {{in the amount of}} electricity that suppliers feed into the grid. Wherever possible, grid operations procedures are designed to match supply with demand at high levels of reliability, and the tools to influence supply and demand are well-developed. The introduction of large amounts of highly <b>variable</b> <b>power</b> generation may require changes to existing procedures and additional investments.|$|E
25|$|A 1980 AMC Concord {{served as}} the test vehicle in s {{conceptual}} design study of the automotive Improved Gas Turbine (IGT) powertrain. Working under a NASA contract for U.S. DOE's Division of Automotive Technology Development, Williams Research performed the design and analysis on the gas turbine engine, while AMC's AM General subsidiary did the vehicle installation studies, supplied the vehicle, transmission, drivetrain, and the typical car accessories. The two-door sedan used a dual-rotor gas turbine with <b>variable</b> <b>power</b> turbine nozzle, and a 3-speed automatic transmission for conventional rear-wheel-drive. Williams Research conducted all the performance and fuel economy analysis, with the turbine powered Concord meeting expectations. The final report estimated that the IGT vehicle would have a 10% higher cost over the conventional piston engine, of which {{less than half of}} the cost penalty would be in the turbine engine, but the remainder would be the cost of adapting existing production of vehicles and systems. However, fuel economy improvements, as well as reduced maintenance and repairs, would result in an overall life-cycle cost saving of 9% for the IGT vehicle.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, <b>variable</b> {{frequency}} of <b>power</b> inverter is quite used in most application especially on solar power generation A variable-frequency power inverter controls the operating speed of an AC motor by controlling {{the frequency and}} voltage of the power supplied to the motor An inverter provides the controlled power based voltage and frequency. Recently, Digital Signal. Processing are used as advanced control technique which confirmed high quality control based on microcontroller and provide additional real time processing throughput in an inverter operation This study investigates the microcontroller of DSPTMS 320 F 2812 based <b>variable</b> frequency <b>power</b> inverter. The DSPTMS 320 F 2812 provides the variable frequency, signal that controls the applied voltage on the gate drive and less harmonics of the frequency at the output of power inverter.

500|$|In {{stand alone}} PV systems {{batteries}} are traditionally used to store excess electricity. With grid-connected photovoltaic power system, excess electricity {{can be sent}} to the electrical grid. Net metering and feed-in tariff programs give these systems a credit for the electricity they produce. This credit offsets electricity provided from the grid when the system cannot meet demand, effectively trading with the grid instead of storing excess electricity. [...] Credits are normally rolled over from month to month and any remaining surplus settled annually. When wind and solar are {{a small fraction of the}} grid power, other generation techniques can adjust their output appropriately, but as these forms of <b>variable</b> <b>power</b> grow, additional balance on the grid is needed. As prices are rapidly declining, PV systems increasingly use rechargeable batteries to store a surplus to be later used at night. Batteries used for grid-storage stabilize the electrical grid by leveling out peak loads usually for several minutes, and in rare cases for hours. In the future, less expensive batteries could play an important role on the electrical grid, as they can charge during periods when generation exceeds demand and feed their stored energy into the grid when demand is higher than generation.|$|E
500|$|Wind power gives <b>variable</b> <b>power</b> {{which is}} very {{consistent}} {{from year to year}} but which has significant variation over shorter time scales. It is therefore used in conjunction with other electric power sources to give a reliable supply. As the proportion of wind power in a region increases, a need to upgrade the grid, and a lowered ability to supplant conventional production can occur. Power management techniques such as having excess capacity, geographically distributed turbines, dispatchable backing sources, sufficient hydroelectric power, exporting and importing power to neighboring areas, or reducing demand when wind production is low, can in many cases overcome these problems. In addition, weather forecasting permits the electric power network to be readied for the predictable variations in production that occur. Blyth's [...] high, cloth-sailed wind turbine was installed in the garden of his holiday cottage at Marykirk in Kincardineshire and was used to charge accumulators developed by the Frenchman Camille Alphonse Faure, to power the lighting in the cottage, thus making it the first house in the world to have its electric power supplied by wind power. Blyth offered the surplus electric power to the people of Marykirk for lighting the main street, however, they turned down the offer as they thought electric power was [...] "the work of the devil." [...] Although he later built a wind turbine to supply emergency power to the local Lunatic Asylum, Infirmary and Dispensary of Montrose the invention never really caught on as the technology was not considered to be economically viable.|$|E

2500|$|An {{important}} {{limiting factor}} of wind power is <b>variable</b> <b>power</b> generated by wind farms. In most locations {{the wind blows}} {{only part of the}} time, which means {{that there has to be}} back-up capacity of conventional generating capacity to cover periods that the wind is not blowing. To address this issue it has been proposed to create a [...] "supergrid" [...] to connect national grids together across western Europe, ranging from Denmark across the southern North Sea to England and the Celtic Sea to Ireland, and further south to France and Spain especially in Higueruela which was considered for some time the biggest wind farm in the world. The idea is that by the time a low pressure area has moved away from Denmark to the Baltic Sea the next low appears off the coast of Ireland. Therefore, while it is true that the wind is not blowing everywhere all of the time, it will always be blowing somewhere.|$|E
2500|$|Flutter as a {{controlled}} aerodynamic instability phenomenon is used intentionally and positively in windmills for generating electricity {{and in other}} works like making musical tones on ground-mounted devices, {{as well as on}} musical kites. Flutter is not always a destructive force; recent {{progress has been made in}} windmills for underserved communities in developing countries, designed specifically to take advantage of this effect. The oscillating motion allows variable-stroke waterpumping to match the <b>variable</b> <b>power</b> in the wind. Semirotary binary flutter can also have an upper critical airspeed at which it stops, affording automatic high wind protection [...] The resulting Wing'd Pump has been designed to mount on the well it pumps or float on the pond it draws from. At its large scale the flutter is coupled by static gravity imbalance as well as dynamic imbalance. Further a gravity pendulum [...] achieves large amplitude elasticity most practically. The same annual output can be achieved with wing length equal to a multiblade rotary windpump's diameter, in half the windspeed regime. P. Sharp and J. Hare showed a toy linear generator run by two flutter wings.|$|E

30|$|The {{attainable}} {{system throughput}} of BB-OFDMA {{is sensitive to}} the selected interference threshold [15, 16]. In this paper, it is demonstrated how the interference threshold can be tuned to tradeoff system throughput to enhance cell-edge user throughput, thereby enhancing fairness. Moreover, by using a <b>variable</b> BB <b>power</b> {{that takes into account}} the quality of the intended link, a favourable tradeoff between system throughput and fairness is achieved. A <b>variable</b> BB <b>power</b> exhibits the further advantage that the sensitivity of the selected interference threshold on the performance is mitigated. Finally, BB-OFDMA with <b>variable</b> BB <b>power</b> is the basis for a novel receiver-driven link adaptation algorithm. System-level simulations demonstrate a significant improvement both in terms of fairness and total system throughput of BB-OFDMA, compared to the system with full-frequency reuse, where attempts to avoid interference are not made.|$|R
