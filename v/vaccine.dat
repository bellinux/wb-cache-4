5|$|Because {{the oral}} polio <b>vaccine</b> is inexpensive, easy to administer, and {{produces}} excellent immunity in the intestine (which helps prevent infection with wild virus {{in areas where}} it is endemic), {{it has been the}} <b>vaccine</b> of choice for controlling poliomyelitis in many countries. On very rare occasions (about one case per 750,000 <b>vaccine</b> recipients), the attenuated virus in the oral polio <b>vaccine</b> reverts into a form that can paralyze. Most industrialized countries have switched to inactivated polio <b>vaccine,</b> which cannot revert, either as the sole <b>vaccine</b> against poliomyelitis or in combination with oral polio <b>vaccine.</b>|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{there is}} no {{licensed}} <b>vaccine</b> for HIV or AIDS. The most effective <b>vaccine</b> trial to date, RV 144, was published in 2009 and found a partial reduction {{in the risk of}} transmission of roughly 30%, stimulating some hope in the research community of developing a truly effective <b>vaccine.</b> Further trials of the RV 144 <b>vaccine</b> are ongoing.|$|E
5|$|Subsequently, Albert Sabin {{developed}} another live, oral polio <b>vaccine.</b> It {{was produced}} by the repeated passage of the virus through nonhuman cells at subphysiological temperatures. The attenuated poliovirus in the Sabin <b>vaccine</b> replicates very efficiently in the gut, the primary site of wild poliovirus infection and replication, but the <b>vaccine</b> strain is unable to replicate efficiently within nervous system tissue. A single dose of Sabin's oral polio <b>vaccine</b> produces immunity to all three poliovirus serotypes in about 50 percent of recipients. Three doses of live-attenuated oral <b>vaccine</b> produce protective antibody to all three poliovirus types in more than 95 percent of recipients. Human trials of Sabin's <b>vaccine</b> began in 1957, and in 1958 it was selected, in competition with the live vaccines of Koprowski and other researchers, by the US National Institutes of Health. Licensed in 1962, it rapidly became the only polio <b>vaccine</b> used worldwide.|$|E

5|$|To {{encourage}} further discovery, {{researchers and}} policymakers are promoting new economic models of <b>vaccine</b> development, including prizes, tax incentives, and advance market commitments. A number of groups, including the Stop TB Partnership, the South African Tuberculosis <b>Vaccine</b> Initiative, and the Aeras Global TB <b>Vaccine</b> Foundation, {{are involved with}} research. Among these, the Aeras Global TB <b>Vaccine</b> Foundation received a gift of more than $280 million (US) from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to develop and license an improved <b>vaccine</b> against tuberculosis for use in high burden countries.|$|E
5|$|A global {{effort to}} {{eradicate}} polio, {{led by the}} World Health Organization, UNICEF, and The Rotary Foundation, began in 1988 and has relied largely on the oral polio <b>vaccine</b> developed by Albert Sabin and Mikhail Chumakov (Sabin-Chumakov <b>vaccine).</b>|$|E
5|$|An enhanced-potency IPV (inactivated polio <b>vaccine)</b> was {{licensed}} in the United States in November 1987, and {{is currently}} the <b>vaccine</b> of choice in the United States. The first dose of polio <b>vaccine</b> is given shortly after birth, usually between 1 and 2 months of age, a second dose is given at 4 months of age. The timing of the third dose depends on the <b>vaccine</b> formulation but should be given between 6 and 18 months of age. A booster vaccination is given at 4 to 6 years of age, {{for a total of}} four doses at or before school entry. In some countries, a fifth vaccination is given during adolescence. Routine vaccination of adults (18 years of age and older) in developed countries is neither necessary nor recommended because most adults are already immune and have a very small risk of exposure to wild poliovirus in their home countries. In 2002, a pentavalent (five-component) combination <b>vaccine</b> (called Pediarix) containing IPV was approved for use in the United States.|$|E
50|$|Currently {{administered}} human anthrax <b>vaccines</b> include acellular (USA, UK) {{and live}} spore (Russia) varieties.

5|$|At {{the same}} time that Salk was testing his <b>vaccine,</b> both Albert Sabin and Hilary Koprowski {{continued}} working on developing a <b>vaccine</b> using live virus. During a meeting in Stockholm to discuss polio vaccines in November 1955, Sabin presented results obtained on a group of 80 volunteers, while Koprowski read a paper detailing the findings of a trial enrolling 150 people. Sabin and Koprowski both eventually succeeded in developing vaccines. Because of the commitment to the Salk <b>vaccine</b> in America, Sabin and Koprowski both did their testing outside of the United States, Sabin in Mexico and then in the Soviet Union, and Koprowski in the Congo and Poland. In 1957, Sabin developed a trivalent <b>vaccine,</b> containing attenuated strains of all three types of poliovirus. In 1959, ten million children in the Soviet Union received the Sabin oral <b>vaccine.</b> For this work, Sabin was given the medal of the Order of Friendship Among Peoples, described as the Soviets' highest civilian honor, despite having become an American {{during the height of the}} cold war. Sabin's oral <b>vaccine</b> using live virus came into commercial use in 1961. Once Sabin’s oral <b>vaccine</b> became widely available, it supplanted Salk’s injected <b>vaccine</b> because it was cheaper to produce and easier to administer.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{both its}} {{effectiveness}} and safety, in 2009 the World Health Organization {{recommended that the}} rotavirus <b>vaccine</b> be offered to all children globally. Two commercial rotavirus vaccines exist and several more are in development. In Africa and Asia these vaccines reduced severe disease among infants and countries that have put in place national immunization programs have seen {{a decline in the}} rates and severity of disease. This <b>vaccine</b> may also prevent illness in non-vaccinated children by reducing the number of circulating infections. Since 2000, the implementation of a rotavirus vaccination program in the United States has substantially decreased the number of cases of diarrhea by as much as 80 percent. The first dose of <b>vaccine</b> should be given to infants between 6 and 15 weeks of age. The oral cholera <b>vaccine</b> {{has been found to be}} 50–60% effective over 2years.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, Maurice Brodie, a {{research}} assistant at New York University, attempted to produce a formaldehyde-killed polio <b>vaccine</b> from ground-up monkey spinal cords. His initial attempts were hampered by the difficulty of obtaining enough virus. Brodie first tested the <b>vaccine</b> on himself {{and several of his}} assistants. He then gave the <b>vaccine</b> to three thousand children. Many of these children developed allergic reactions, but none developed immunity to polio. Philadelphia pathologist John Kolmer also claimed to have developed a <b>vaccine</b> that same year, but it too produced no immunity and was blamed for causing cases of paralytic polio, nine of them fatal.|$|E

5|$|In 1961, type 1 and 2 {{monovalent}} oral poliovirus <b>vaccine</b> (MOPV) was licensed, and in 1962, type 3 MOPV was licensed. In 1963, trivalent OPV (TOPV) was licensed, {{and became}} the <b>vaccine</b> of choice in the United States and most other countries of the world, largely replacing the inactivated polio <b>vaccine.</b> A second wave of mass immunizations led to a further dramatic {{decline in the number}} of polio cases. Between 1962 and 1965 about 100 million Americans (roughly 56% of the population at that time) received the Sabin <b>vaccine.</b> The result was a substantial reduction in the number of poliomyelitis cases, even from the much reduced levels following the introduction of the Salk <b>vaccine.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1998, a {{rotavirus}} <b>vaccine</b> was licensed {{for use in}} the United States. Clinical {{trials in}} the United States, Finland, and Venezuela had found it to be 80 to 100% effective at preventing severe diarrhoea caused by rotavirus A, and researchers had detected no statistically significant serious adverse effects. The manufacturer, however, withdrew it from the market in 1999, after it was discovered that the <b>vaccine</b> may have contributed to an increased risk for intussusception, a type of bowel obstruction, in one of every 12,000 vaccinated infants. The experience provoked intense debate about the relative risks and benefits of a rotavirus <b>vaccine.</b>|$|E

40|$|Developing {{effective}} tuberculosis (TB) <b>vaccines</b> {{is a high}} priority. We use mathematical {{models to}} predict the potential public health impact of new TB <b>vaccines</b> in highincidence countries.

Postexposure <b>vaccines</b> would initially have a substantially greater impact, compared to preexposure <b>vaccines,</b> on reducing the number of new cases of disease. However, the effectiveness of postexposure <b>vaccines</b> would diminish over time, whereas the effectiveness of preexposure <b>vaccines</b> would increase. Thus, after 20 to 30 years, post- or preexposure vaccination campaigns would be almost equally effective in terms of cumulative TB cases prevented. Even widely deployed and highly effective (50 %– 90 % efficacy) pre- or postexposure <b>vaccines</b> would only be able {{to reduce the number of}} TB cases by one third.

5|$|Oral polio <b>vaccine</b> (OPV) is an {{attenuated}} <b>vaccine,</b> {{produced by}} {{the passage of the}} virus through non-human cells at a sub-physiological temperature, which produces spontaneous mutations in the viral genome. Oral polio vaccines were developed by several groups, one of which was led by Albert Sabin. Other groups, led by Hilary Koprowski and H.R. Cox, developed their own attenuated <b>vaccine</b> strains. In 1958, the National Institutes of Health created a special committee on live polio vaccines. The various vaccines were carefully evaluated for their ability to induce immunity to polio, while retaining a low incidence of neuropathogenicity in monkeys. Large-scale clinical trials performed in the Soviet Union in late 1950s to early 1960s by Mikhail Chumakov and his colleagues demonstrated safety and high efficacy of the <b>vaccine.</b> Based on these results, the Sabin strains were chosen for worldwide distribution.|$|E
