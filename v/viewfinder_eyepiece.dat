25|$|Like SLRs DSLRs {{typically}} use {{interchangeable lenses}} (1) with a proprietary lens mount. A movable mechanical mirror system (2) is switched down (exact 45-degree angle) to direct {{light from the}} lens over a matte focusing screen (5) via a condenser lens (6) and a pentaprism/pentamirror (7) to an optical <b>viewfinder</b> <b>eyepiece</b> (8). Most of the entry-level DSLRs use a pentamirror instead of the traditional pentaprism.|$|E
5000|$|The fixed {{eye-level}} pentaprism viewfinder has 100-percent {{vertical and}} horizontal coverage, has dioptric viewfinder adjustment from -3 to +1 diopter and has as a <b>viewfinder</b> <b>eyepiece</b> blind to block stray light when on a tripod.|$|E
50|$|The G-III camera made {{checking}} the battery easier {{by the addition}} of the battery check button {{on the side of the}} <b>viewfinder</b> <b>eyepiece.</b> A lamp on the camera would light when the battery was still good.|$|E
50|$|To get the {{advantage}} of both optical and electronic viewfinders some cameras have hybrid viewfinders. These display the image in an optical <b>eyepiece</b> <b>viewfinder,</b> or electronically on an LCD screen. Examples include the Fujifilm FinePix X100, X100S, X100T and X-Pro1.|$|R
50|$|The {{centrally}} positioned eyepiece {{is for the}} viewfinder. An external mechanism, {{hidden inside}} the protrusion at the left-hand side of the lens/shutter assembly, relays the front lens element extension to the rangefinder optics by sensing {{the height of a}} milled cam at the periphery of the lens barrel just behind the toothed rim. Both the separate <b>viewfinder</b> and rangefinder <b>eyepieces</b> and the lens coupling are {{in the style of the}} Leica camera. The difference is the way in which the lever operates on the lens barrel. Looking through the small rangefinder window at the left-hand side at the back reveals a clear view of a horizontally split image. The lower image part is shifted sideways by turning the focusing wheel at the front right-hand side of the lens. By aligning the vertical feature of any object in the motive that crosses the split in the rangefinder image may render it sharp on the film.|$|R
5000|$|... 1 - Minolta-35 (Model A)On {{entering}} the miniature camera business, Chiyoda Kogaku {{had decided to}} make the frame size 24×32mm, a logical proposition at the time since most photo copies were made on paper closer to this format. The already established international standard was 36 images of 24×36mm. By doing so, a standard length of film yielded four more exposures on a 36-exposure load. The Minolta-35 has a combined <b>viewfinder</b> and rangefinder <b>eyepiece,</b> negating the need to move the sight from one window to the other. It also features a self-timer and a hinged rear door to facilitate film loading. The camera came with a decent Super Rokkor 45mm f/2.8 standard optic comprising five elements in three groups, including the front group of three cemented elements designed to secure sharp images on the small negative. When the camera appeared all engravings on the lens and on the slow-speed dial were oriented to be read from the front side of the camera. Later, at about serial no. 4000, they were turned to be read as one holds the camera for picture taking. Accessory mounted in the shoe on top of the camera is secured by a spring-loaded ball that sometimes mistakenly is assumed to be a flash synchroniser contact, which it is not.|$|R

50|$|The T70 {{included}} two different through-the-lens metering methods; both used a silicon photocell housed above the <b>viewfinder</b> <b>eyepiece.</b> Center-weighted average metering was the standard metering method, averaging {{over the whole}} frame with a slight preference towards {{the center of the}} frame, where the main subject is most likely to be. With strongly backlit scenes, or ones where the subject is spotlit against a dark background, center-weighted averaging produces underexposure or overexposure, respectively. For such situations, the T70 also supported selective area metering, which metered only the center 11% of the frame. The metering mode was selected by a sliding switch on the top left-hand side of the camera (from the photographer's perspective). This switch also selected self-timer mode and had a Lock position.|$|E
5000|$|The camera's {{appearance}} was unique, as it lacked the ubiquitous SLR pentaprism [...] "hump". Instead, a Porro prism system was used; it fitted sideways within the camera, with a sideways-swinging mirror, and located the <b>viewfinder</b> <b>eyepiece</b> {{to the left}} (seen from behind) relative to the lens centerline. The body was largely of ABS plastic over a metal frame; the lens mount was metal, {{and there was a}} metal covered area on the left top of the camera. This area also contained the onboard flash, which popped up and forward {{at the touch of a}} button. The onboard flash popup mechanism is manual. In low light scenarios the flash will not pop up automatically but the photographer must press the button and pop it up before taking the photo.|$|E
5000|$|... 2006: Olympus Evolt E-330 (Japan): first {{live view}} digital SLR. Had a {{secondary}} CCD sensor {{to send a}} live video feed to a swiveling 2.5 in color LCD panel (normally used for camera function data) and allow its use as an auxiliary viewfinder when the photographer's eye cannot be at the SLR <b>viewfinder</b> <b>eyepiece.</b> A sharper live view mode was available that temporarily flipped aside the reflex mirror (blacking out the primary porro-mirror SLR viewfinder) and opened the shutter to send a live feed from the primary 2352×3136 pixel (7.5 MP) Four Thirds format MOS image sensor. Most new for 2008 digital SLRs had a live view mode. Although today live view has limitations (unintelligibility in bright sunlight, image lag with moving subjects, rapid battery drain, etc.), its perfection, plus an electronic shutter, would make the bulky and expensive precision mechanisms and optics of a focal-plane shutter, instant return mirror and pentaprism unnecessary and allow the camera to be a completely electronic device. (This has already occurred with snapshot cameras - {{the vast majority of}} point-and-shoot digital cameras lack an optical viewfinder.) In other words, the Micro Four Thirds format Panasonic LUMIX DMC-G1 (Japan, 2008) mirror-less non-SLR, interchangeable lens digital camera with high resolution electronic live view viewfinder and LCD might be the first of a new breed of camera with the potential to end the history of the single-lens reflex camera.|$|E
