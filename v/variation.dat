5|$|A population's genetic <b>variation</b> can {{be greatly}} reduced by a bottleneck, and even {{beneficial}} adaptations may be permanently eliminated. The loss of <b>variation</b> leaves the surviving population vulnerable to any new selection pressures such as disease, climate change or {{shift in the}} available food source, because adapting in response to environmental changes requires sufficient genetic <b>variation</b> in the population for natural selection to take place.|$|E
5|$|A {{portion of}} all genetic <b>variation</b> is {{functionally}} neutral, producing no phenotypic effect or {{significant difference in}} fitness. Motoo Kimura's neutral theory of molecular evolution by genetic drift proposes that this <b>variation</b> accounts for a large fraction of observed genetic diversity. Neutral events can radically reduce genetic <b>variation</b> through population bottlenecks. which among other things can cause the founder effect in initially small new populations. When genetic <b>variation</b> does not result in differences in fitness, selection cannot directly affect the frequency of such <b>variation.</b> As a result, the genetic <b>variation</b> at those sites is higher than at sites where <b>variation</b> does influence fitness. However, after a period with no new mutations, the genetic <b>variation</b> at these sites is eliminated due to genetic drift. Natural selection reduces genetic <b>variation</b> by eliminating maladapted individuals, and consequently the mutations that caused the maladaptation. At the same time, new mutations occur, resulting in a mutation–selection balance. The exact outcome of the two processes depends both on {{the rate at which}} new mutations occur and on the strength of the natural selection, which is a function of how unfavourable the mutation proves to be.|$|E
5|$|An {{individual}} organism's phenotype {{results from}} both its genotype {{and the influence}} from the environment it has lived in. A substantial part of the phenotypic <b>variation</b> in a population is caused by genotypic <b>variation.</b> The modern evolutionary synthesis defines evolution as the change over time in this genetic <b>variation.</b> The frequency of one particular allele will become more or less prevalent relative {{to other forms of}} that gene. <b>Variation</b> disappears when a new allele reaches the point of fixation—when it either disappears from the population or replaces the ancestral allele entirely.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the systematic intra-die <b>variations,</b> the intra-die threshold voltage and on-current <b>variations</b> are measured thanks to 4 -mm 4000 x 1 transistor arrays with 1 µm transistor-pitch in a 90 nm CMOS technology, achieving the widest spatial distribution range. The spatial frequency analysis of the <b>variations</b> indicates that both <b>variations</b> are random across 4 mm. The dependence of both <b>variations</b> on body bias is also measured and the relationships between threshold voltage <b>variations</b> and on-current <b>variations</b> are analyzed by using the alpha-power law model.

5|$|Between 1835 and 1837, the {{zoologist}} Edward Blyth {{worked on}} the area of <b>variation,</b> artificial selection, and how a similar process occurs in nature. Darwin acknowledged Blyth's ideas in the first chapter on <b>variation</b> of On the Origin of Species.|$|E
5|$|Changes that predate {{magnetic}} observatories {{are recorded}} in archaeological and geological materials. Such changes {{are referred to}} as paleomagnetic secular <b>variation</b> or paleosecular <b>variation</b> (PSV). The records typically include long periods of small change with occasional large changes reflecting geomagnetic excursions and reversals.|$|E
5|$|Domestication is {{also studied}} {{by using the}} genetic {{material}} of present-day horses and comparing it with the genetic material present in the bones and teeth of horse remains found in archaeological and palaeological excavations. The <b>variation</b> in the genetic material shows that very few wild stallions contributed to the domestic horse, while many mares were part of early domesticated herds. This {{is reflected in the}} difference in genetic <b>variation</b> between the DNA that is passed on along the paternal, or sire line (Y-chromosome) versus that passed on along the maternal, or dam line (mitochondrial DNA). There are very low levels of Y-chromosome variability, but a great deal of genetic <b>variation</b> in mitochondrial DNA. There is also regional <b>variation</b> in mitochondrial DNA due to the inclusion of wild mares in domestic herds. Another characteristic of domestication is an increase in coat color <b>variation.</b> In horses, this increased dramatically between 5000 and 3000 BC.|$|E

30|$|Process <b>variations</b> are {{subdivided}} into inter-die and intra-die <b>variations</b> (Segura et al. 2006; Nuyts et al. 2014; Weste and Harris 2011 c). In inter-die/global <b>variations,</b> each device {{within the same}} chip will be affected {{in the same manner}} as these <b>variations</b> result in an equal random shift in the average value of every device parameter. Process gradients over the wafer (Eisele et al. 1997), <b>variations</b> in the gate oxide thickness (Tox) and <b>variations</b> in the exposure time which cause <b>variations</b> in the length and width of transistors are examples of inter-die <b>variations</b> (Henzler 2010 a; Alioto et al. 2010). These three inter-die <b>variations</b> examples affect both transistor types, nMOS and pMOS transistors. However, other inter-die <b>variations</b> such as dose <b>variations</b> of ion implantation affect only nMOS or pMOS transistor (Henzler 2010 a; Nuyts et al. 2014). During design, these <b>variations</b> are modeled using the well-known process corners, namely, slow–slow (SS), slow–fast (SF), fast–slow (FS), and fast–fast (FF) as they simulate the speed at which CMOS transistors operate. The <b>variations</b> in transistor speed cause the delays for nMOS and pMOS transistors to be different, causing transient fluctuations at the output known as jitter. The jitter level should be taken into consideration as it directly affects delay resolution (Nuyts et al. 2014).|$|R

5|$|After 3.dxe5 Black can try the Fajarowicz <b>variation</b> 3...Ne4 which {{concentrates}} on the rapid development of pieces, but the most common move is 3...Ng4 with three main possibilities for White. The Adler <b>variation</b> 4.Nf3 sees White seeking a spatial advantage in the centre with his pieces, notably the important d5-square. The Alekhine <b>variation</b> 4.e4 gives White an important spatial advantage and a strong pawn centre. The Rubinstein <b>variation</b> 4.Bf4 leads to an important choice for White, after 4...Nc6 5.Nf3 Bb4+, between 6.Nbd2 and 6.Nc3. The reply 6.Nbd2 brings a positional game in which White enjoys the bishop pair and tries to break through on the queenside, while 6.Nc3 keeps the material advantage of a pawn {{at the cost of}} a weakening of the white pawn structure. Black usually looks to have an aggressive game (many lines can shock opponents that do not know the theory) or cripple White's pawn structure.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, {{selection}} can {{be divided}} according to its effect on genetic diversity. Purifying or negative selection acts to remove genetic <b>variation</b> from the population (and is opposed by de novo mutation, which introduces new <b>variation.</b> In contrast, balancing selection acts to maintain genetic <b>variation</b> in a population, {{even in the absence}} of de novo mutation, by negative frequency-dependent selection. One mechanism for this is heterozygote advantage, where individuals with two different alleles have a selective advantage over individuals with just one allele. The polymorphism at the human ABO blood group locus has been explained in this way.|$|E
