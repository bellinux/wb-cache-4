25|$|At 9:15am on 14 February 2007, a {{passenger}} train broke down {{when one of}} the voltage transformers mounted on the train (EMU SP1900) roof exploded. It was suspected that the overheated transformer caused its insulating oil to vaporise, thus causing the explosion. The train-borne circuit breaker, which was connected in parallel to the <b>voltage</b> <b>transformer</b> to the train pantograph, was not designed to isolate this kind of fault.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} primary types of voltage {{transformers}} (VT): electromagnetic, capacitor, and optical. The electromagnetic <b>voltage</b> <b>transformer</b> is a wire-wound transformer. The capacitor <b>voltage</b> <b>transformer</b> uses a capacitance potential divider {{and is used}} at higher voltages due to a lower cost than an electromagnetic VT. An optical <b>voltage</b> <b>transformer</b> exploits the electrical properties of optical materials. Measurement of high voltages is possible by the potential transformers.|$|E

40|$|Pongamia oil natural esters {{extracted}} from the seeds of Pongamia Pinnata tree and its derivatives are investigated in this study to assess their suitability for use in high <b>voltage</b> <b>transformers</b> as an insulator and coolant, so as to replace the presently used mineral oil. Higher viscosity of such natural esters poses challenges for the heat transfer and impulse voltage performances, which {{are thought to be}} the major drawbacks of their use in high <b>voltage</b> <b>transformers.</b> Reducing the viscosity by chemical methods lowers the fire resistance of these natural esters. In order to obtain natural esters having balanced performance i. e. both lower viscosity and higher fire resistance, blends of Pongamia oil and low viscous fatty acid methyl ester, derived from Pongamia oil by a chemical process called trans-esterification, are prepared and their impulse voltage performance assessed. Preliminary studies conducted on Pongamia oil and its derivatives show that they can be an environmentally friendly and economically viable replacement for mineral oil used in high <b>voltage</b> <b>transformers...</b>|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} Out-Of-Step {{conditions}} in a network, how {{to detect the}} events {{and how to make}} improvements on the protection devices that are being used today. Power systems and stability analysis are studied in general and Out-Of-Step conditions are reviewed in detail. Experiments with a one machine against an infinite bus are performed to connect theory with reality. The laboratory model is exposed to transient faults in the range 100 ms to 800 ms. A PMU is used to measure voltages and currents at the generator bus and at the infinite bus. The thesis includes the development of an algorithm that can detect power swings. The algorithm is programmed in MATLAB. This algorithm detects faults in the system and predicts loss of synchronism. The data collected with the PMU from the laboratory measurements are run in the program to be able to determine the capability of the algorithm. The thesis also includes design and assembly of two <b>voltage</b> <b>transformers.</b> The <b>voltage</b> <b>transformers</b> are needed to be able to connect the PMU to the laboratory model.
