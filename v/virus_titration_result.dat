Therefore, we analysed {{the ability of}} WNV to infect German Culex mosquitoes with special emphasis on field collected specimens of Culex torrentium and Culex pipiens biotype pipiens. We collected egg rafts of Culex mosquitoes over two subsequent seasons at two geographically distinct sampling areas in Germany and differentiated the samples by molecular methods. Adult females, reared from the various egg rafts, were challenged with WNV by feeding of artificial blood meals. WNV infection was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and <b>virus</b> <b>titration.</b> The <b>results</b> showed that field collected C. pipiens biotype pipiens and C. torrentium mosquitoes native to Germany are susceptible to WNV infection at 25  °C as well as 18  °C incubation temperature. C. torrentium mosquitoes, which have not been established as WNV vector so far, were the most permissive species tested with maximum infection rates of 96 % at 25  °C. Furthermore, a disseminating infection was found in up to 94 % of tested C. pipiens biotype pipiens and 100 % of C. torrentium. Considering geographical variation of susceptibility, C. pipiens biotype pipiens mosquitoes from Southern Germany were more susceptible to WNV infection than corresponding populations from Northern Germany. All in all, we observed high infection and dissemination rates even at a low average ambient temperature of 18  °C. The high susceptibility of German Culex populations for WNV indicates that an enzootic transmission cycle in Germany could be possible...|$|R

We compared infection by an epidemic VEEV strain to that by an enzootic strain using <b>virus</b> <b>titrations,</b> immunohistochemistry, and a virus expressing the green fluorescent protein. Ae. taeniorhynchus was more susceptible to the epidemic strain, which initially infected the posterior midgut and occasionally the anterior midgut and cardia. Once dissemination beyond the midgut occurred, virus was present in nearly all tissues. Transmission of the epidemic strain to mice was first detected 4 days after infection. In contrast, the enzootic strain did not efficiently infect midgut cells but replicated in muscles and nervous tissue on dissemination. Because VEEV emergence can depend on adaptation to epidemic vectors, these results show that epidemic/enzootic strain comparisons not only comprise a useful model system to study alphavirus transmission by mosquitoes, but also have important public health implications...|$|R
