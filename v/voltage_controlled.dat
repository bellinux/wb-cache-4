40|$|IEEE Xplore link: [URL] fully rated {{converter}} of type 4 {{wind turbines}} {{is capable of}} providing dynamic <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> during grid faults by injecting controlled reactive currents. This paper describes three different dynamic <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> options during unbalanced grid faults: 1) the positive sequence <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> with only a positive sequence reactive current injection and suppression of the negative sequence current; 2) the positive sequence <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> with limitation of the positive sequence reactive current injection and suppression of the negative sequence current; and 3) {{the positive and negative}} sequence <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> with both a positive and a negative sequence reactive current injection. These different control options are compared in simulations of a wind power plant connected to a meshed power system, including synchronous generators. It is shown that both the positive sequence <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> with limitation and the positive and negative sequence <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> can overcome the voltage rise and voltage distortion that can occur with pure positive sequence <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> without limitation. Both of these options have a distinct fault response, where the positive and negative sequence <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> results in a fault response that resembles the fault response of a synchronous generator with higher fault current contributions in the faulted phases. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Voltage {{regulation}} {{by means}} of coordinated <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> {{is one of the}} challenging aspects of distribution system operation. Integration of distributed generation (DG), which can also be operated in <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> mode, in distribution systems may introduce adverse effects including control interactions, operational conflicts and long term oscillations. The seamless operation of distribution systems embedded with DG for effective <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> is one of the challenging tasks, mainly because (a) DG may interact with the conventional <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> devices and (b) prioritised operation of different <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> devices depends on the network topology and real-time characteristics of the system. Coordinated operation involving multiple <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> devices (i. e., on-load tap changers and voltage regulators in addition to local capacitor banks) and DG units is one of the feasible technical solutions at medium voltage distribution system level. In most of the methods proposed in the literature, the <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> devices and DG units are tuned and coordinated online using Volt/VAR optimization strategies in accordance with the time-graded operation. However, there is no mechanism to operationally minimize the interactions between DG units and the <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> devices in real-time between any two consecutive control states. In such case, more generic approach needs to be developed for examining interactions between the DG units and the <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> devices. In this paper, interactions among multiple DG units and the <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> devices are identified using their simultaneous and non-simultaneous responses...|$|R

40|$|Evaluation of <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> {{methods for}} maximizing end-of-grid wind farm {{capacity}} uses the Kalbarri Wind Farm {{as a base}} study case. The weakness of end-of-grid feeders {{is that they have}} relatively high resistance and reactance, which lead to high real and reactive power losses and low power transfer capability. This thesis report provides summaries of the <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> algorithms from the simplest to the most complex algorithm. The parameters of the Kalbarri Wind Farm elements are based on the documents provided by Verve Energy. This thesis investigates the <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> algorithm including the use of a Static Synchronous Compensator (STATCOM) with the wind farm in order to stabilise the grid <b>voltage.</b> The <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> algorithm study cases are based on the Kalbarri Network Model, and its system simulations are carried out by using DIgSILENT PowerFactory software. The first <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> algorithm is a wind turbine with fixed power factor which is the simplest <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> algorithm. The second <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> algorithm is the wind turbine with fixed power factor combined with a STATCOM, with the STATCOM using the isochronous <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> method. The STATCOM size required for this <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> algorithm is so large that it makes the system uneconomic. In order to improve it, the third <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> algorithm uses a ± 1 MVAr STATCOM. At the same time, an upstream <b>voltage</b> regulator <b>controls</b> the STATCOM within a ± 0. 8 MVAr range. The upstream voltage regulator does the remote control, since there is communications between the upstream regulator and the STATCOM. The fourth <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> algorithm is built on the third algorithm with the STATCOM using the droop <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> method. The upstream regulator indirectly controls the Point of Connection (PoC) voltage by using the Line Drop Compensation (LDC) to keep STATCOM within a ± 0. 8 MVAr Range. In the fourth <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> algorithm, the LDC is used {{to take the place of}} the communications in the third algorithm. The ‘WindFREE’ wind turbine option is also considered in this thesis report, which means the wind turbine is equipped with the feature of providing reactive power under the ‘no wind’ conditions. The dynamic <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> algorithm with the STATCOM using a variable voltage setpoint, as used in Kalbarri is evaluated. Future works that could be a continuation of this topic are proposed and the thesis report includes a summary of case studies...|$|R

40|$|Voltage is an {{important}} parameter for the control of electrical power systems. The Distribution Network Operators (DNO) {{have the responsibility to}} regulate the voltage supplied to consumer within statutory limits. Traditionally, the On-Load Tap Changer (OLTC) transformer equipped with automatic <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> (AVC) relays is the most popular and effective <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> device. Connecting Distributed Generation (DG) to the network inherently affects the feeder voltage profiles and influences the <b>voltage</b> <b>control</b> in distribution systems.
