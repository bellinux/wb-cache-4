To increase added value of Indonesian vetiver oil, therefore it is need method with cheap production, simple and easy to operate. Multiglass plate system (MGS) is one method to increase added value of vetiver oil. The aim {{of this research is}} to improve the vetiver oil quality in terms of appearance, odor and the physicochemical properties by MGS method and also optimize the operation condition on the vetiver oil yield and total <b>vetiverol</b> contents. The process parameters used on this research are to optimize the flow rate, angular and amount of glass plate. As a result, was obtained the optimum condition in 0. 38 ml/sec of flow rate, 3 o of glass plate angular and 5 of glass plate to increase 15 % of total <b>vetiverol</b> contents, while the yields decreased until 5. 6 %. Refined vetiver oil by MGS are almost meet fulfill with Indonesia National Standard number 06 - 2386 - 2006 except total <b>vetiverol</b> contents and odor. Even though, the total <b>vetiverol</b> content increased and the odor became slightly smoky compare to raw material. Based on the results, MGS method can give higher purification of <b>vetiverol</b> of increase vetiver oil quality with easy to handle, low cost operation and also can moved to anywhere due to portable unit and mobile system...|$|E
40|$|Vetiver oil (Vetiveria zizanoides) {{has been}} used as perfume materials, cosmetics, {{fragrance}} soaps, anti-inflammation, repellent, and insecticidal agents. Organic vetiver oil has higher economical value than non-organic vetiver oil and it has been regarded to be able to compete in the global market. Therefore, studies have been carried out using 1 hectare of land and the first generation of organic vetiver oil has produced 0. 57 % of yield, greater than non-organic (0. 50 %). The quality of organic and non-organic vetiver oil was analyzed by Indonesian Standard (SNI) parameter, pesticide residue test, chemical composition by GC/MS, and the appearance of vetiver root. In general, the result of organic and non-organic vetiver oil has fulfilled the national standard; the quality of organic vetiver oil was better than non-organic one. Physically, the appearance of organic vetiver root was better than non-organic vetiver root; organic vetiver root was denser, more appealing, and did not have any black spots. The pesticide residue of organic vetiver oil was lower than non-organic vetiver oil. Based on SNI test, <b>vetiverol</b> (oxygen compounds) in organic vetiver oil was higher than non-organic vetiver oil...|$|E
