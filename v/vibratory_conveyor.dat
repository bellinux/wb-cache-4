This research paper examines a problem with fatigue in the support structure of {{a specific type of}} <b>vibratory</b> <b>conveyor.</b> It also reviews the theory behind <b>vibratory</b> <b>conveyor</b> technology and considerations that engineers who design them need to be aware of. The finite element method is used to replicate a fatigue problem in the support structure and various design configurations are then analyzed {{to reduce the risk of}} the conditions that caused the fatigue.

40|$|The <b>vibratory</b> <b>conveyor,</b> {{routinely}} {{employed for}} normal-gravity transport of granular materials, usually {{consists of a}} continuous open trough vibrated sinusoidally to induce axial movement of a granular material. Motivated {{in part by a}} hypothetical application in zero gravity, we propose a novel modification of the <b>vibratory</b> <b>conveyor</b> based on a closed 2 d trough operating in a "slide-conveying" mode, with the granular mass remaining permanently in contact with the trough walls. We present a detailed analysis of the mechanics of transport, based on a rigid-slab model for the granular mass with frictional (Coulomb) slip at the upper and lower walls. The form of the vibration cycle plays a crucial role, and the optimal conveying cycle is not the commonly assumed rectilinear sinusoidal motion. The conveying efficiency for the novel slide conveyor will be presented for several simple vibration cycles, including one believed to represent the theoretical optimum...|$|E
40|$|The {{suitability}} of the currently used vibratory transport {{models for the}} case of applying the <b>vibratory</b> <b>conveyors</b> in the metallurgical industry, was analysed in the hereby paper. It was found that these models, due to not taking into account an influence of the air flow through the feed layer, do not usually correspond with conditions occurring in this industry. The analysis of the productivity of <b>vibratory</b> <b>conveyors</b> applied in the metallurgical industry should include an influence of dusty and powdery fractions present in transported materials, since the air flow resistance can cause-in such cases-a significant decrease of the transport velocity. The mathematical and simulation model of the feed, {{taking into account the}} influence of the air flowing through the feed, was formulated in the study. Its compatibility with experimental investigations was also pointed out...|$|R

40|$|Granular flows due to {{simultaneous}} {{vertical and}} horizontal excitations of a flat-bottomed cylindrical pan are investigated using event-driven molecular dynamics simulations. In agreement with recent experimental results, we observe a transition from a solid-like state, to a fluidized state in which circulatory flow occurs simultaneously in the radial and tangential directions. By going beyond the range of conditions explored experimentally, we find {{that each of these}} circulations reverse their direction {{as a function of the}} control parameters of the motion. We numerically evaluate the dynamical phase diagram for this system and show, using a simple model, that the solid-fluid transition can be understood in terms of a critical value of the radial acceleration of the pan bottom; and that the circulation reversals are controlled by the phase shift relating the horizontal and vertical components of the vibrations. We also discuss the crucial role played by the geometry of the boundary conditions, and point out a relationship of the circulation observed here and the flows generated in <b>vibratory</b> <b>conveyors.</b> Comment: 10 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

One such product is a <b>vibratory</b> <b>conveyor</b> that has been developed largely through prototype iteration. The manufacturer has collaborated with Oregon State University to introduce model-based design into the development process. This research details a proposed framework for the reverse engineering of a mature product line. The framework is applied to a <b>vibratory</b> <b>conveyor</b> that is used in processing plants for corn and other raw foods. First, the project's origin and goals are described, followed by an explanation of the reverse engineering based framework used for guiding model selection. Next the selected dynamics model, built from the dynamic properties measured during reverse engineering, is applied and refined to accurately reflect the system's measured performance. Further modeling with finite element analysis, for improving performance and durability of specific components, is also described.

40|$|Abstract. Vibratory {{conveyors}} {{are used}} especially within serial productions for {{the transport of}} diverse materials and parts for assembling. The desired oscillating movement is accomplished by electromagnetic exciting forces. The exciting force of this dynamic system actuates between the carrying element and the inertial mass. The inertial mass is fixed to the ground by an elastic constraint using a relatively stiff rubber spring. This elastic constraint ensures the conveyor’s stability and defines its position towards the assembly line, but does not meet relevant effective vibration isolation demands. One possible solution would be a <b>vibratory</b> <b>conveyor</b> air suspension as is being introduced below...|$|E
40|$|Producing a {{noiseless}} and vibration free devices {{is a need}} of the day. The vibration causes rapid wear {{of machine}} parts such as bearings and gears. Unwanted vibrations may cause loosening of parts from the machine. Because of improper design or material distribution, the wheels of locomotive can leave the track due to excessive vibration which results in accident or heavy loss. Sometimes because of heavy vibrations proper readings of instrument cannot be taken. Vibration {{can be used for}} useful purposes such as vibration testing equipment's, <b>vibratory</b> <b>conveyors,</b> hoppers, and comparators. Vibration is found to be very fruitful in mechanical workshops such as improving the efficiency of machining, casting, forging and welding techniques. The transfer of noise can also be reduced by decoupling the components {{in such a way that}} the noise path is interrupted. This can be achieved by adding noise reducing treatments to the structure such as elastic elements, masses, local shielding or damping layers. In the present investigation, the use of viscoelastic damping layers as a noise reducing measure in rotating machinery is considered. Here in this investigation the result obtained will give frequency value in random manner and the use of t-test (testing hypothesis) will show us that vibrations are really reduced or not...|$|R
40|$|When {{granular}} material is shaken both in {{horizontal and vertical}} direction simultaneously, as commonly done in <b>vibratory</b> <b>conveyors</b> that are well established in routine industrial production for controlled transport of bulk solids, the transported goods can exhibit a surprisingly large variety of surface patterns. For example, if a monolayer of glass beads is vibrated in a circularly manner in a narrow annular channel, a coexistence of a solid‐like and a gas‐like domain can be observed. The solid fraction decreases with increasing acceleration and shows hysteresis. The sharp boundaries between the two regions travel around the channel faster than the particles are transported. By using a molecular dynamics simulation {{we were able to}} extract the local granular temperature and number density. It was found that the number density in the solid phase is several times that in the gas, while the temperature is orders of magnitude lower. If the number of particles is increased further, localized period‐doubling waves arise. These solitary wave packets are accompanied by a locally increased particle density. The width and velocity of the granular wave pulses are measured {{as a function of the}} bed height. A continuum model for the material distribution, based on the measured granular transport velocity as a function of the bed thickness, captures the essence of the experimental findings...|$|R
40|$|Vibratory feeders or <b>vibratory</b> <b>conveyors</b> {{have been}} widely used for the {{transport}} and orientation of individual parts and bulk materials in many branches of industrial activity. From the designer’s standpoint, the current endeavor is to conceive efficient vibratory feeders, satisfying constraints of power consumption, vibration transmission and noise emission. Moreover, the interest in the reduction of maintenance cost is always present. In this context, this paper investigates experimentally the concept of vibratory conveying based on the use of piezoelectric materials for motion generation. A small-size prototype of a linear conveyor, in which lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) patches are bonded to the resilient elements, is described. One of the main design goals is that the prototype is intended to be fed directly from the electric network, aiming at avoiding the use of electronic equipment for driving. To comply with this feature and, at the same time, enable to adjust the transport velocity, a mechanical device has been conceived {{in such a way that}} the first natural frequency of the conveyor can be changed. It is shown that the transport velocity is determined by the proximity between the excitation frequency and the first natural frequency of the conveyor. The experimental tests performed to characterize the dynamic behavior of the prototype are described and the range of transport velocities is determined...|$|R

The proposed method is based on the application of the control of the feed-forward controler, together with the events detection based on the generalised likelihood ratio (GLR) algorithm. Such approach leads to the controller intervention only when it is justified by the current process situation, (e. g. in case of an essential change of the feed mass) to enable the stable machine operations and to limit transient states.

40|$|A {{theoretical}} and experimental study {{was made of}} the conveying speed with which granular materials are transported by vibratory conveyors. The basic assumption made is that the layer of granular material can be considered as a point mass. The theory incorporates rest, slide, and flight phases of the material. Although the emphasis of this study is on the effect of the inclination (and declination) of the conveyor on the conveying speed, the effects of throw number, friction coefficient and vibration angle on the conveying speed are also shown. A useful method is presented for measuring the coefficient of friction between granular material and <b>vibratory</b> <b>conveyor.</b> Experiments were performed in order to verify the point mass theory. The agreement between theory and experiment is fairly good for slide conveyors but for throw conveyors larger deviations are observed. Some possibilities for improvement to the theory are briefly investigated...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—A {{mathematical}} model of two-mass vibratory con-veying system with electromagnetic vibratory actuator (EVA) and possible ways of their optimal control by using power converter {{is presented in}} this paper. <b>Vibratory</b> <b>conveyors</b> are commonly used in industry to carry {{a wide variety of}} particulate and granular materials. Application of electromagnetic vibratory drive com-bined with power converters provides flexibility during work. The use of a silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR) implies a phase angle control, which is very easy, but with many disadvantages (fixed frequency which is imposed by ac mains supply, poor power factor, mechanical retuning, etc.). Switching converters overcomes these disadvantages. Only then, driving for EVA does not depend on mains frequency. As well as amplitude and duration of excitation force tuning, it is also possible to tune its frequency. Consequently, complicated mechanical tuning is eliminated and seeking resonant frequency is provided. Previously mentioned facts motivated phase angle control and switch mode control behavior research for electromagnetic vibratory drives. Simulation and experimental results and their comparisons are exposed in this paper. The simulation model and results are given in the program package PSPICE. Experimental results are recorded on implemented control systems for SCR and transistor power converters. Partial results concerning the resonant frequency seeking process with transistor converter are also exposed.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Vibratory</b> <b>conveyors</b> {{are well}} {{established}} in routine industrial production for controlled transport of bulk solids. Because of the complicated {{interactions between the}} vibrating trough and the particles both glide and throw movements frequently appear within one oscillation cycle. Apart from the amplitude and frequency, {{the form of the}} trajectory of the conveyor’s motion also exerts an influence. The goal of our project is a systematic investigation of the dependence of the transport behavior on the three principle oscillation forms: linear, circular and elliptic. For circular oscillations of the shaking trough a non-monotonous dependence of the transport velocity on the normalized acceleration is observed. Two maxima are separated by a regime, where the granular flow is much slower and, in a certain driving range, even reverses its direction. In addition, standing waves oscillating at half the forcing frequency are observed within a certain range of the driving acceleration. The dominant wavelength of the pattern is measured for various forcing frequencies at constant amplitude. These waves are not stationary, but drift with a velocity equal to the transport velocity of the granular material, determined by means of a tracer particle. Finally, the fluidization of a monolayer of glass beads is studied. At peak forcing accelerations between 1. 1 g and 1. 5 g a solid-like and a gas-like domain coexist. It is found that the number density in the solid phase is several times that in the gas, while its granular temperature is orders of magnitude lower. ...|$|R

It is currently {{owned and operated}} by the fourth generation of the Dalton family. The company specializes in the production of pickles and condiment products and currently holds the title of # 1 retail brand of pickles in the state of Texas. In addition to the Best Maid label, products are also produced under the Del-Dixie label. The objective of this thesis is to analyze a potential capital project: a bucket line replacement. The analysis will be completed by using net present value to determine the cost and benefits of the project. The focus of the project will be the food service bucket line. The current line was designed and installed over 20 years ago. Currently, this line and supporting resources require a staff of 17 employees to operate. The process is looking to be improved through advances in technology including <b>vibratory</b> <b>conveyors,</b> more complex PLC programming, and increased accuracy of scaling equipment. Implementing these advancements has the potential to reduce the employee labor cost as well as decrease over-scaling.

40|$|The single-mass, crank-and-rod exciters {{vibrational}} conveyers have a trough {{supported on}} elastic stands which are rigidly {{fastened to the}} trough and a supporting frame. The trough is oscillated by a common crank drive. This vibration causes the load to move forward and upward. The moving loads jump periodically and move forward with relatively small vibration. The movement is strictly related to vibrational parameters. This is applicable in laboratory conditions in the industry which accommodate a few grams of loads, up to those that accommodate tons of loading capacity. In this study I explore the transitional behavior across resonance, during the starting of a single degree of freedom vibratory system excited by crank-and-rod. A loaded <b>vibratory</b> <b>conveyor</b> is more safe to start than an empty one.

40|$|A {{review of}} the {{previous}} work on the mechanics of vibratory conveying is given., It is found that several theoretical studies {{have been made in}} the past but the predictions of the theories and the comparisons of these' with experimental results have only been applicable to a very limited range of the relevant variables. In the present work, a theoretical analysis is described which enables the mean conveying velocity of a component on a conventional <b>vibratory</b> <b>conveyor</b> to be determined for'a wide range of the relevant variables. Since an alternative method of vibration is discussed, "conventional" refers' to vibratory conveyors which are commercially available. The results of this theory are compared with the results of experimental work conducted on apparatus specially designed for the purpose. Within practical limits, good agreement is obtained. From this work it is concluded that fundamental limitations eXist in conventional vibratory conveying, the most important of which are that the conveying velocity is very sensitive to changes in the coefficient of friction between the component and the track and for low coefficients of friction, the conveying velocity for steady conveying is inadequate. • A further analysis is then described which considers the mechanics of Vibratory conveying where a phase difference exists between the normal and parallel motions of the track, (known as "out of phase" conveying). Again, within certain limits, the new theory is in good agreement with experimental results. It is apparent from this work that with the correct phase relation$hip between the two components of vibration, definite practical advantages exist over conventional conveying. With "out of phase" conveying, the component velocity is virtually independent of the nature of the component and track materials and conveying velocities significantly higher than those obtainable on a conventional <b>vibratory</b> <b>conveyor</b> axe possible. Further, with this vibration system, components can be conveyed separately and without erratic motion up an inclined track. A practical method of obtaining an "out of phase" vibration on the track of a vibratory bowl feeder is suggested. The results of performance tests on two commercially available vibratory bowl feeders with conventional drives are presented and it is shown that in both cases their performance is very sensitive to changes in the bowl load. A method for reducing this effect by re-tuning the bowl spring support system is demonstrated. Some suggestions for improving the performance of conventional bowl feeders are discussed which include details of how the track angle, vibration. angle, track material and suspension spring stiffness should be determined...|$|E
