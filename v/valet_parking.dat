25|$|Parking lot attendants {{can include}} people who simply {{coordinate}} where to park {{and how much}} to pay or they may also include formal valets who will park a vehicle and keep track of the driver's keys while he or she is in the club.

The attendant will also attempt to keep the restroom area clean, assist with the washing of hands, and if available, provide by request an assortment of cologne, mints, and other disposable items.|$|E

500|$|Although bicycle centers {{were already}} common {{throughout}} Europe, Long Beach, California {{is credited with}} pioneering commuter-biking hubs offering <b>valet</b> <b>parking,</b> showers and repair services in the United States. As the concept grew, public agencies and private groups in other cities followed suit. The development of the Millennium Park Cycle Center {{was part of a}} reversal of bike disincentives stemming from Boub v. Township of Wayne—a 1998 Illinois Supreme Court ruling that bikes are [...] "permitted" [...] but not [...] "intended" [...] users of the roads, meaning that local governments have a limited responsibility to keep cyclists safe and that municipalities are immune from bicycle-injury lawsuits unless the street has been clearly marked as a bike route. The city has been actively accommodating cyclists since 1999 through the CDOT Bike Lane Project. [...] At the time of the July 2004 Cycle Center opening, Illinois Senate Bill 275, which would have removed the liability disincentive to add bike lanes, mark bike routes and give cyclists reasonable protection, was at issue. At the time, the city of Chicago had [...] of bike lanes (with an additional [...] forthcoming), in excess of 9,000 bike racks, and it had implemented a policy allowing bicycles on CTA trains (at all times excluding weekday morning and afternoon rush hours), CTA buses and Pace buses. In June 2005, Metra allowed a limited number of bicycles on trains during off-peak and weekend hours {{for the first time on}} a trial basis. [...] By 2006, the city had [...] of bike lanes. [...] The planning emphasis in Chicago uses what is known as transit-oriented development, which encourages developers to include bicycle parking.|$|E
