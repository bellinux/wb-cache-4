40|$|Background: Bacterial Vaginosis (BV) is an {{ecological}} change of vagina which {{is characterized by}} balance alteration of <b>vaginal</b> normal <b>flora.</b> Thus, it manifests the domination of Lactobacillus into anaerobic bacteria. BV prevalence is quite high in reproductively active age women {{and most of the}} cases are asymptomatic. Spiegel criteria that is based on direct bacterial counting is a method that highly accurate and objective, and has ability to illustrate alteration of ecological and <b>vaginal</b> micro <b>flora</b> composition. However, this method has not been regularly used in clinical practice. Moreover, the reliability of Spiegel criteria especially external reliability is rarely reported. Purposes: This research aimed to evaluate external reliability of vaginal smear examination using Spiegel criteria in diagnosing BV among pregnant women. Method: This research was a diagnostic test study. Samples were compiled from 83 pregnant women’s Gram stained vaginal smear which were scored by Spiegel criteria. Scoring was done blindly by two examiners in different time. Kappa test was performed to determine reliability between the results of those two examiners. Result: The examination of microbial scoring which included Lactobacillus, Gardnerella, and Mixed flora yielded kappa value 0, 343; 0, 245; 0, 156 respectively. Otherwise after using the simplification of Spiegel criteria kappa value was increased up to 0, 711.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Vagina {{like all}} other mucosal organs owns its especial bacterial/microbial flora. Though may be {{pathogen}} in other circumstances, members of <b>vaginal</b> normal <b>flora</b> do not cause disease on healthy vaginal mucosa. In this study, we tried to determine the relationship between microscopic findings on Methenamine silver stained cervicovaginal smears and clinical symptoms. &# 13; METHODS: A total of 389 cervicovaginal smears were examined cytologically from April to August 2005, among which 103 satisfactory smears of patients who were normally menstruating were subsequently selected. The originally Papanicolaou–stained smears were stained with Methenamine silver method. The cervicovaginal flora in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients was classified into four groups. The relationship between the type of genital flora {{and the presence of}} Candida or Actinomyces spp was also determined. Data were analyzed with SPSS software using Chi–square test. &# 13; RESULTS: In 103 evaluated patients, 46 (44. 7 %) were symptomatic and the rest were asymptomatic. The most prevalent genital microbial flora in both symptomatic (21. 7 %) and asymptomatic (37. 9 %) patients was type II (Lactobacilli). Microbial frequency differences were significant for types II (P = 0. 034) and III (P = 0. 039) in both groups. Coexistence of microbial flora of type I (P = 0. 02) and type IV (P = 0. 033) with Candida was statistically significant. Coexistence of all types of microbial flora with Actinomyces was not proved significant. &# 13; CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic women, except those with potential pathogens, tend to have Lactobacillus flora. Therefore, it is advisable that all Lactobacilli types be investigated through microbiological methods in symptomatic patients. In silver stained slides, there was a clear relationship between the type of <b>vaginal</b> microbial <b>flora</b> and the presence of Candida spp. &# 13; KEY WORDS: Microbial flora, cervicovaginal smears, methenamine silver, symptomatic, asymptomatic...|$|R

50|$|Toxic shock {{syndrome}} (TSS) is a potentially fatal bacterial illness. Scientists have recognized {{an association between}} TSS and tampon use, although the exact connection remains unclear. TSS caused by menstrual cup use appears to be very rare to virtually nonexistent. The probable {{reason for this is}} that menstrual cups are not absorbent, do not irritate the vaginal mucosal tissue, nor do they change the <b>vaginal</b> <b>flora</b> in any measurable amount. Conversely, vaginal dryness and abrasions may occur when women use tampons which are more absorbent than needed for the amount of their menstrual flow. Research has shown that the cup has no impact on the <b>vaginal</b> <b>flora,</b> which means there is no effect on the presence of S. aureus, the bacterium that can cause TSS.

50|$|Vaginal {{microbiota}} {{refers to}} those species and genera that colonize the lower reproductive tract of women. These organisms {{play an important}} role in protecting against infections and maintaining vaginal health. The most abundant vaginal microorganisms found in premenopausal women are from the genus Lactobacillus, which suppress pathogens by producing hydrogen peroxide and lactic acid. Bacterial species composition and ratios vary depending on the stage of the menstrual cycle. Ethnicity also influences <b>vaginal</b> <b>flora.</b> The occurrence of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli is lower in African American women and vaginal pH is higher. Other influential factors such as sexual intercourse and antibiotics have been linked to the loss of lactobacilli. Moreover, studies have found that sexual intercourse with a condom does appear to change lactobacilli levels, and does increase the level of Escherichia coli within the <b>vaginal</b> <b>flora.</b> Changes in the normal, healthy vaginal microbiota is an indication of infections, such as candidiasis or bacterial vaginosis. Candida albicans inhibits the growth of Lactobacillus species, while Lactobacillus species which produce hydrogen peroxide inhibit the growth and virulence of Candida albicans in both the vagina and the gut.|$|E
