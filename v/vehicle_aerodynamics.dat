In addition, the launch pad can supply existing Protons with common hypergolic fuels from single sources. The upper stages, in particular, are fed by common loading pipes running along the rocket.

A preliminary aerodynamics database existed for then current lifting body configurations, however, this database was developed without considering plume effects. A combined effort by the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and the Experimental Fluids Dynamics Branches was undertaken to determine first order effects of plume/external flow interactions on <b>vehicle</b> <b>aerodynamics</b> of this lifting body/linear aerospike configuration. Of interest were plume pumping/entrainment at low Mach numbers and plume induced separation of flow over the vehicle at higher altitudes. The CFD analysis included combinations of four Mach numbers, two angles of attack, and four throttle settings. The majority of the CFD was two dimensional centerline analysis of the lifting body/aerospike. Incremental plume effects were derived by comparing the power-on, power-off, and throttled cases and were extrapolated to the preliminary aerodynamic database.

25|$|The {{reduction}} of drag in road vehicles {{has led to}} increases in the top {{speed of the vehicle}} and the vehicle's fuel efficiency, as well as many other performance characteristics, such as handling and acceleration. The two main factors that impact drag are the frontal area of the vehicle and the drag coefficient. The drag coefficient is a unit-less value that denotes how much an object resists movement through a fluid such as water or air. A potential complication of altering a <b>vehicle's</b> <b>aerodynamics</b> is that it may cause the vehicle to get too much lift. Lift is an aerodynamic force that flows perpendicular to the airflow around the body of the vehicle. Too much lift can cause the vehicle to lose road traction which can be very unsafe. Lowering the drag coefficient comes from streamlining the exterior body of the vehicle. Streamlining the body requires assumptions about the surrounding airspeed and characteristic use of the vehicle.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} the present study is an {{investigation}} of a vehicle running stability from viewpoints of steady and unsteady flow characteristics, such as vortex structures and their motion, around the vehicle. For this purpose, a numerical method for unsteady <b>vehicle</b> <b>aerodynamics</b> using Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) is constructed and validated. Special focus is on a pitching stability, which relates to the passengers â€™ comfort and safety, and influences of the forced pitching motion on the <b>vehicle</b> <b>aerodynamics</b> are investigated. Two simplified vehicle models, which represent real passenger sedans with different running stability in past road tests, are adopted as the objects. First, the simplified models are tested in the stationary condition to see whether the same characteristic pressure fluctuations as observed in the real sedans are reproduced. Then, aerodynamic characteristics and its relationships with flow structures in quasi- and non-stationary conditions are investigated. Particular emphasis is on the aerodynamic forces acting on the trunk deck, which are expected to be strongly related to the stability of the pitch motion, and they are studied by relating to the steady and unsteady wake structures of the vehicle. The result indicates that consideration of the unsteady aerody...|$|E

The duct redirects the flow before it passes the control vanes, altering the aerodynamic forces and moment generated by the vanes as well as the vehicle.
