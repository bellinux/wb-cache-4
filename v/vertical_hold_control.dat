40|$|International audienceThis study {{investigated}} how environmental design shapes perceptual-motor exploration, when meta-stable regions of performance are created. Here, we examined how creating meta-stable regions of performance could destabilize pre-existing skills, favoring greater exploration of performance environments, exemplified {{in this study}} by climbing surfaces. In this investigation we manipulated hold orientations on an indoor climbing wall to examine how nine climbers explored, learned, and transferred various trunk-rolling motion patterns and hand grasping movements. The learning protocol consisted of four sessions, in which climbers randomly ascended three different routes, as fluently as possible. All three routes were 10. 3 m in height and composed of 20 hand-holds at the same locations on an artificial climbing wall; only hold orientations were altered: (i) a horizontal-edge route was designed to afford horizontal hold grasping, (ii) a vertical-edge route afforded <b>vertical</b> <b>hold</b> grasping, and (iii), a double-edge route was designed to afford both horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>hold</b> grasping. As a meta-stable condition of performance invite an individual to both exploit his pre-existing behavioral repertoire (i. e., horizontal hold grasping pattern and trunk face to the wall) and explore new behaviors (i. e., <b>vertical</b> <b>hold</b> grasping and trunk side to the wall), {{it was hypothesized that}} the double-edge route characterized a meta-stable region of performance. Data were collected from inertial measurement units located on the neck and hip of each climber, allowing us to compute rolling motion referenced to the artificial climbing wall. Information on ascent duration, the number of exploratory and performatory movements for locating hand-holds, and hip path was also observed in video footage from a frontal camera worn by participants. Climbing fluency was assessed by calculating geometric index of entropy. Results showed that the meta-stable condition of performance may have afforded utilization of more adaptive climbing behaviors (expressed in higher values for range and variability of trunk rolling motion and greater number of exploratory movements). Findings indicated how climbers learn to explore and, subsequently, use effective exploratory search strategies that can facilitate transfer of learning to performance in novel climbing environments...|$|R

40|$|Developing public {{transportation}} and giving priority to buses is a feasible solution {{for improving the}} level of {{public transportation}} service, which facilitates congestion alleviation and prevention, and contributes to urban development and city sustainability. This paper presents a novel bus operation control strategy including both <b>holding</b> <b>control</b> and speed control to improve the level of service of transit systems within a connected vehicle environment. Most previous work focuses on optimization of signal timing to decrease the bus signal delay by assuming that <b>holding</b> <b>control</b> is not applied; the speed of buses is given as a constant input and the acceleration and deceleration processes of buses can be neglected. This paper explores {{the benefits of a}} bus operation control strategy to minimize the total cost, which includes bus signal delay, bus holding delay, bus travel delay, acceleration cost due to frequent stops and intense driving. A set of formulations are developed to explicitly capture the interaction between bus <b>holding</b> <b>control</b> and speed control. Experimental analysisand simulation tests have shown that the proposed integrated operational model outperforms the traditional control, speed <b>control</b> only, or <b>holding</b> <b>control</b> only strategies in terms of reducing the total cost of buses. The sensitivity analysis has further demonstrated the potential effectiveness of the proposed approach to be applied in a real-time bus operation control system under different levels of traffic demand, bus stop locations, and speed limits...|$|R
