5|$|The {{species has}} a large and {{powerful}} foot with brown spots and markings towards the edge, but is white nearer to the <b>visceral</b> <b>hump</b> that stays inside the shell and accommodates internal organs. The base of the anterior end of the foot has a distinct groove, which contains {{the opening of the}} pedal gland. Attached to the posterior end of the foot for about one third of its length is the dark brown, corneous, sickle-shaped operculum, which is reinforced by a distinct central rib. The base of the posterior two-thirds of the animal's foot is rounded; only the anterior third touches the ground during locomotion. The columella, the central pillar within the shell, serves as the attachment point for the white columellar muscle. Contraction of this strong muscle allows the animal's soft parts to shelter in the shell in response to undesirable stimuli.|$|E
5|$|Most {{octopuses}} swim by expelling a jet {{of water}} from the mantle through the siphon into the sea. The physical principle behind this is that the force required to accelerate the water through the orifice produces a reaction that propels the octopus in the opposite direction. The direction of travel depends on the orientation of the siphon. When swimming, the head is at the front and the siphon is pointed backwards, but when jetting, the <b>visceral</b> <b>hump</b> leads, the siphon points towards the head and the arms trail behind, with the animal presenting a fusiform appearance. In an alternative method of swimming, some species flatten themselves dorso-ventrally, and swim with the arms held out sideways, and this may provide lift and be faster than normal swimming. Jetting is used to escape from danger, but is physiologically inefficient, requiring a mantle pressure so high as to stop the heart from beating, resulting in a progressive oxygen deficit.|$|E
25|$|The animal cannot {{withdraw}} {{itself into}} the shell, which contains the <b>visceral</b> <b>hump</b> only. The cephalic disc is large and slipper-shaped, feebly emarginate on the dorsal surface behind and with a narrow free margin.|$|E
50|$|The large, sac-like {{digestive}} gland {{is placed}} at {{the left side of}} the <b>visceral</b> <b>hump</b> flanking the ovotestis and extends almost up to the end of the <b>visceral</b> <b>hump.</b> The intestine is densely ciliated and short. The anus opens slightly anterior, but separate to the nephropore and ventrolaterally on the right side of the <b>visceral</b> <b>hump.</b>|$|E
50|$|External {{morphology}} and {{anatomy of}} Pseudunela marteli {{is the same}} as in Pseudunela viatoris with the following exceptions:Colour of digestive gland is greenish or orange-brownish. Eyes (30-35 µm) are pigmented and well visible externally.

The densely ciliated foot is as broad as the anterior head-foot complex and extends about {{one third of the}} elongated <b>visceral</b> <b>hump.</b> The heart bulb is visible externally in the anterior part of the <b>visceral</b> <b>hump</b> on the right body side. Subepidermal, needle-shaped calcareous s are sparsely distributed in the cephalic tentacles, the foot and the visceral hump; in the anterior part of the latter they are larger than in the posterior part. The body colour is whitish translucent, the digestive gland is brownish coloured (in specimens from Indonesia: orange-brownish shining through the epidermis). Epidermal glands are distributed particularly over the <b>visceral</b> <b>hump.</b> Whereas eyes are not visible externally in specimens from Fiji, eyes are weakly visible in some specimens from Indonesia.

50|$|Akera is a {{primitive}} genus. These sea hares {{do not fit}} completely in their external shell; it just covers their <b>visceral</b> <b>hump</b> which is positioned at the posterior end of their bodies. Their streamlined bodies are adapted for burrowing.|$|E
50|$|The {{circulatory system}} shows a large two-chambered heart {{consisting}} of an anterior ventricle and a smaller, posterior atrium. The thin-walled pericardium surrounding the heart {{could not be}} detected because of the very compressed tissue. The aorta arises anteriorly from the ventricle and leads to the head, where the aorta bifurcates approximately {{at the level of}} the eyes ending in blood sinuses. The renopericardioduct is a well-developed and heavily ciliated funnel. The kidney is a sinuously bent sac and extends over almost the half of the <b>visceral</b> <b>hump.</b> Internally it is divided into a narrow lumen bordered by tissue with small vacuoles, and a wide lumen limited by highly vacuolated tissue. Both lumina join in the posterior part of the kidney. The renopericardial duct is connected to the narrow lumen in the anterior part of the kidney. The connection between the kidney and the nephroduct is narrow and ciliated. The nephroduct is long and looped with a dorsal branch extending backward and a ventral branch forward. The ventral branch is looped dorsally in its distal part. The nephropore opens just posterior, but separate to the anus and ventrolaterally on the right side of the <b>visceral</b> <b>hump.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The broadly ovoid snail has {{a maximum}} {{recorded}} length of 20 mm. [...] It is cream-colored with about eight brown spots. The thin dorsal surface (notaeum) is smooth {{on top and}} on the sides, but wrinkled and vesiculate elsewhere. It envelops the transparent, thin, white internal shell. The shell shows some faint concentric lines of growth. This shell covers the top and the sides of a large <b>visceral</b> <b>hump,</b> suggesting in its form a Homeric helmet (Greek : korys), hence {{the name of the}} epithet corys. This hump is a smooth dome of purplish-yellow visceral mass, mainly consisting of the glands of the genital system.|$|E
50|$|The sac-like ovotestis extends {{over the}} half of {{the right side of}} the <b>visceral</b> <b>hump</b> and is not {{separated}} into follicles; oocytes are located more in the exterior part of the gonad and the spermatocytes are positioned more in the centre. Sperm heads are short. Approximately 10 yolky oocytes were noted in the examined specimen. Anterior to the ovotestis there is a small receptaculum seminis containing sperm cells oriented with their heads to the wall, as well as a sac-like ampulla filled with unoriented autosperm. Three nidamental glands can be distinguished: the albumen, membrane and mucus gland from proximal to distal, respectively. The tube-like albumen gland is characterized by cells containing dark blue stained vesicles and long cilia. The membrane gland is tube-like with long cilia as well. In the proximal part, vesicles are stained purple, in the distal part, lilac. The mucus gland is sac-like with short cilia. It shows the same histological staining properties as the distal membrane gland. The distal part of the mucus gland extends to {{the right side of the}} body wall where the hermaphroditic duct divides into the vas deferens and the oviduct. The oviduct widens to a cavity. At the distal end of the cavity a long, narrowly coiled bursa stalk branches off leading to the large bursa copulatrix. No spermatocytes can be detected inside the bursa, but an indeterminable mucous mass that might contain degenerated sperm. The distal oviduct extends to the female gonopore opening ventrolaterally on the right side of the <b>visceral</b> <b>hump</b> to the exterior. The female gonopore is situated considerably anterior to the anus and the nephropore.|$|E
50|$|An elongated, {{somewhat}} cylindrical gastropod, C. fulvipunctata has an internal, {{very thin}} shell. Its body {{is divided into}} a cephalic shield and a <b>visceral</b> <b>hump</b> which is, partly covered by a posterior mantle shield. The cephalic shield has its anterior edge wider than the posterior point and it is roughly divided. The eyes are situated {{on the front of}} the head and almost invisible as they are obscured by the dorsal surface. The mouth is flanked on either side by a mound which is covered in sensory bristles. The animal's foot is expanded into two lateral parapodia. The two long and symmetrical parapodia fold over and partially cover the dorsal surface. A pair of tapering lobes extend from the rear of the mantle shield, the left one is longer while the right lobe is much shorter.|$|E

5000|$|Paraganitus ellynnae {{is smaller}} than 5 mm and is {{externally}} symmetric. It has no shell in adults, and no operculum in adults. It has also no head shield and no posterior shield. [...] It is able to partially retract parts of its anterior body into a temporal visceral cavity. The visceral sac is largely separated {{from the rest of}} the body. The mantle is robust. The <b>visceral</b> <b>hump</b> is conical. The tail is short and pointed. The foot is narrow, the anterior foot edge is rounded and it can crawl on the whole foot. It has no mantle cavity. It has elongated/pointed rhinophores. Like all acochlidians, it has oral (= labial) tentacles. Paraganitus ellynnae has long and slightly recurved oral tentacles. Oral tentacle nerves have been present in all examined acochlidians to date, but those nerves were not examined in this species.|$|E

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the possible use of Biomphalaria alexandrina snail antigens in diagnosis of schistosomiasis mansoni using enzyme linked immunolectrotransfere blot (EITB). Methods: S. mansoni adult worm crude antigens (AWA), feet and visceral humps of B. alexandrina and Bulinus truncatus were used. Hyperimmune mice sera (HIS) versus each antigen were prepared for diagno­sis of S. mansoni using western blot (WB). Results: Snail foot antigens were more specific in antibodies detection than <b>visceral</b> <b>hump</b> antigens. Three of five polypeptides of B. alexandrina foot antigen identified by S. mansoni HIS showed specific positive reactivity. These polypeptides were at MW of 31 / 32 and 43 kDa. While, only one of the six polypeptides of B. alexandrina hepatopancrease antigen identified by S. mansoni HIS, at a MW of 43 kDa was specific. Similarly, 2 polypeptides at MW of 44 and 55 kDa were specific in detection of anti- S. haematobium antibodies. However, the antigenically active polypeptide of B. truncatus hepatopan­crease antigen had no specific reactivity towards anti-S. haematobium antibodies. Conclusion: B. alexandrina foot antigens were the most specific of the tested snail antigens in diagno­sis of schistosomiasis mansoni...|$|E
