5|$|A {{cervical}} mucus plug, called the operculum, forms inside the cervical canal during pregnancy. This provides a protective seal for the uterus against {{the entry of}} pathogens and against leakage of uterine fluids. The mucus plug is also known to have antibacterial properties. This plug is released as the cervix dilates, either during {{the first stage of}} childbirth or shortly before. It is <b>visible</b> <b>as</b> a blood-tinged mucous discharge.|$|E

5|$|From the 11th century, newly {{incorporated}} {{features were}} either {{based on the}} traditional dravida plan of the Badami Chalukyas, as found in the Virupaksha and Mallikarjuna Temples at Pattadakal, or were further elaborations of this articulation.

5|$|Neptune's {{dark spots}} {{are thought to}} occur in the {{troposphere}} at lower altitudes than the brighter cloud features, so they appear as holes in the upper cloud decks. As they are stable features that can persist for several months, they are thought to be vortex structures. Often associated with dark spots are brighter, persistent methane clouds that form around the tropopause layer. The persistence of companion clouds shows that some former dark spots may continue to exist as cyclones even though they are no longer <b>visible</b> <b>as</b> a dark feature. Dark spots may dissipate when they migrate too close to the equator or possibly through some other unknown mechanism.|$|E
5|$|Sunspots are <b>visible</b> <b>as</b> dark {{patches on}} the Sun's photosphere, and {{correspond}} to concentrations of magnetic field where the convective transport of heat is inhibited from the solar interior to the surface. As a result, sunspots are slightly cooler than the surrounding photosphere, and, so, they appear dark. At a typical solar minimum, few sunspots are visible, and occasionally none {{can be seen}} at all. Those that do appear are at high solar latitudes. As the solar cycle progresses towards its maximum, sunspots tend form closer to the solar equator, a phenomenon known as Spörer's law. The largest sunspots can be tens of thousands of kilometers across.|$|E

Finally, with Tiberius's withdrawal in AD26, Sejanus was left in charge of the entire state mechanism and the city of Rome.|$|E

5|$|The fort {{was linked}} to a jetty, Coalhouse Wharf, on the {{riverside}} a short distance to the south. A standard gauge railway track led from the fort's interior to the jetty and was used to bring guns and supplies from the wharf. The heaviest guns were transported to and from Coalhouse Fort (and other Thames forts) aboard two specialised gun barges called Gog and Magog, built in 1886 and 1900 respectively and used until the 1960s. The remains of the jetty are still <b>visible,</b> <b>as</b> are sections of the track within the fort's entrance.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve {{is derived from}} the first pair of occipital somites, collections of mesoderm that form next to the main axis of an embryo during development. The musculature it supplies develop as the hypoglossal cord from the myotomes of the first four pairs of occipital somites. The nerve is first <b>visible</b> <b>as</b> a series of roots in the fourth week of development, which have formed a single nerve and link to the tongue by the fifth week.|$|E
5|$|The {{planetary}} nebula NGC 5315 has a magnitude of 9.8 around a central star of magnitude 14.2, located 5.2degrees west-southwest of Alpha Circini. It is only <b>visible</b> <b>as</b> a disc at magnifications over 200-fold. Bernes 145 {{is a dark}} and reflection nebula first listed in the 1971 Bernes Catalog. The dark nebula component is easily visible in a large amateur telescope, and it measures 12by5arcminutes. The smaller reflection nebula component requires a larger instrument and averted vision to be seen.|$|E

5|$|The urine of many rodents (e.g. voles, degus, mice, rats) {{strongly}} reflects UV {{light and}} this may be used in communication by leaving <b>visible</b> <b>as</b> well as olfactory markings. However, the amount of UV that is reflected decreases with time, which in some circumstances can be disadvantageous; the common kestrel can distinguish between old and fresh rodent trails and has greater success hunting over more recently marked routes.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} reasons for showing Oscar's head and {{shoulders}} within the frame during the flashback scenes, rather than letting the camera be the character's eyes. The first was {{that this is the}} way Noé usually sees himself in dreams and when recalling past events. He also thought it would be easier for the viewer to care about a character who is <b>visible,</b> <b>as</b> many point-of-view films, in his opinion, look unintentionally funny.|$|E

5|$|Circuses {{were the}} largest {{structure}} regularly {{built in the}} Roman world, though the Greeks had their own architectural traditions for the similarly purposed hippodrome. The Flavian Amphitheatre, {{better known as the}} Colosseum, became the regular arena for blood sports in Rome after it opened in 80 AD. The circus races continued to be held more frequently. The Circus Maximus could seat around 150,000 spectators, and the Colosseum about 50,000 with standing room for about 10,000 more. Many Roman amphitheatres, circuses and theatres built in cities outside Italy are <b>visible</b> <b>as</b> ruins today. The local ruling elite were responsible for sponsoring spectacles and arena events, which both enhanced their status and drained their resources.|$|E
5|$|In Schenectady County, Schoharie Creek {{breaks from}} NY30A {{and returns to}} the {{vicinity}} of NY30 as it intersects U.S. Route20 (US20) in Esperance. From Esperance northward, the creek becomes roughly equidistant from both NY30 and NY30A as all three entities cross into Montgomery County. Near the northeastern corner of the county, NY30 enters the city of Amsterdam. The route meets the New York State Thruway (I-90) and NY5S via separate interchanges before heading downhill as a four-lane divided highway approaching the Mohawk River (here part of the Erie Canal). Historically, the bridge over the river was a straight line to Market Street, which is <b>visible</b> <b>as</b> one approaches northbound. Segments of downtown Market Street remain in use today. With the 1977 creation of the Amsterdam Mall, NY30, together with NY5 and NY67, were re-routed onto splits. After the splits rejoin, NY30 continues on Market Street and leaves the city and, for all purposes, the county.|$|E
5|$|The {{clitoral}} glans doubles {{in diameter}} upon arousal, and, upon further stimulation, it becomes less <b>visible</b> <b>as</b> it {{is covered by}} the swelling of tissues of the clitoral hood. The swelling protects the glans from direct contact, as direct contact at this stage can be more irritating than pleasurable. Vasocongestion eventually triggers a muscular reflex, which expels the blood that was trapped in surrounding tissues, and leads to an orgasm. A short time after stimulation has stopped, especially if orgasm has been achieved, the glans becomes visible again and returns to its normal state, with a few seconds (usually 5–10) to return to its normal position and 5–10 minutes to return to its original size. If orgasm is not achieved, the clitoris may remain engorged for a few hours, which women often find uncomfortable. Additionally, the clitoris is very sensitive after orgasm, making further stimulation initially painful for some women. Masters and Johnson documented the sexual response cycle, which has four phases and is still the clinically accepted definition of the human orgasm.|$|E

40|$|In {{his account}} of visual perception, Thomas Reid {{describes}} <b>visible</b> figure <b>as</b> both ‘real and external’ to the eye and as the ‘immediate object of sight’. These claims appear to conflict with Reid’s direct realism, since if the ‘immediate’ object of vision is also its direct object, then sight would be perceptually indirect due {{to the role of}} <b>visible</b> figure <b>as</b> a perceptual intermediary. I argue that this apparent threat to Reid’s direct realism may be resolved by understanding <b>visible</b> figure <b>as</b> the set of geometrical properties that holds between an object’s visible surfaces and some particular perspective or point of view. On this relational interpretation of visible figure, and once an ambiguity over {{the use of the term}} ‘object’ is resolved, Reid’s account of vision is both epistemically and perceptually direct, as well as consistent with {{his account of}} the other senses and doctrine of signs...|$|R
