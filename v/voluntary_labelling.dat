Satyarthi has highlighted child labor as a human rights issue as well as a welfare matter and charitable cause. He has argued that it perpetuates poverty, unemployment, illiteracy, population growth, and other social problems, and his claims have been supported by several studies.

If there are two labels, one for GM products and one for non-GM products, mandatory and <b>voluntary</b> <b>labeling</b> schemes generate a similar degree of uncertainty about the quality of products that do not carry a label.

Attention is focused on the vertical coordination effects of introducing <b>voluntary</b> <b>labelling</b> along the beef chain and on the interest the Italian consumer shows in labelled information on meat products. Two surveys were conducted: one addressing Italian meat organizations that signed <b>voluntary</b> <b>labelling</b> agreements and the other a sample of 1, 025 Italian consumers.

40|$|In many countries, {{including}} those in the European Union, Japan, Australia, and China, labeling is required for foods that contain genetically modified material. Other countries, including the United States, do not require mandatory labeling of GM foods. The United States, however, does allow firms to voluntarily label their products as non-GM. This {{raises the question of}} whether a mandatory <b>labeling</b> or <b>voluntary</b> <b>labeling</b> policy is more efficient. Proponents of <b>voluntary</b> <b>labeling</b> policies say they are less expensive, because only the firms that wish to label their products must incur the labeling costs. In a mandatory labeling regime, all firms would need to incur additional costs, whether the costs are due to product testing, label design, segregation, mistakes in labeling, etc. Many proponents of mandatory labeling of GM foods say that consumers have a "right to know" what they are eating and proponents claim that governments should mandate labels for foods made through genetic modification. This paper presents empirical evidence on consumers' value for foods with positive (i. e. this food is made with genetic engineering) labels versus and for foods with negative (i. e. this food is made without genetic engineering) labels. The positive label is likely to occur under a mandatory labeling system, while the negative label is likely to occur in a voluntary system. Thus, we present evidence on the consumer value of different labeling policies. We estimate values using a laboratory auction experiment performed on 142 randomly chosen adult consumers in the Des Moines, IA, and Saint Paul, MN, areas, grouped in 8 experimental units. They participated in a random nth-price auction experiment, in which they bid on three familiar neutral food items (an oil, a processed food, and a fresh food) that may be genetically modified. Experimental units are randomly assigned to the labeling treatment (i. e., food items with accurate GM food labels versus no food labels). Using statistical design and econometric analysis, this paper will estimate the average value of food label regimes to consumers. This will be measured as the difference in the auction price of a particular food item with and without a GM food label. We present evidence that shows that a <b>voluntary</b> <b>labeling</b> system elicits the same consumer reaction as a mandatory labeling system. Because a <b>voluntary</b> <b>labeling</b> policy would be less expensive to implement, this paper provides evidence that the United States should not abandon the current <b>voluntary</b> <b>labeling</b> system for a mandatory one. This information could be useful to U. S. public policy makers who must decide on GM food labeling legislation. Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety,...|$|R

40|$|This paper studies how {{information}} disclosed by <b>voluntary</b> environmental <b>labels</b> creates incentives for firms {{to invest in}} environmentally-friendly production technologies. I develop a model with differentiated products and imperfectly-informed consumers. Consumers care about the environmental characteristics of goods (for example, how they were produced), but cannot directly observe these product characteristics. Firms differ in their abilities to develop "clean" technologies, but have no incentive to do so absent government regulation or a policy that provides information to consumers. A scheme of <b>voluntary</b> <b>labels,</b> awarded to firms that achieve some chosen level of environmental friendliness, gives some firms enough incentive to develop clean technologies, while others choose to produce "dirty" goods. Each consumer is individually ineffective in reducing aggregate environmental damage but consumers purchase products according to how they privately value environmental quality. I parameterize {{the relationship between the}} environmental quality consumers experience privately from their own consumption of a product and the intensity of its environmental damage. I use the model to explain how <b>voluntary</b> <b>labels</b> improve consumer welfare and characterize the welfare maximizing labeling standard.
