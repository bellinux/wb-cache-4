5|$|At least 17,000metrictons of {{fluorine}} {{are produced}} each year. It costs only $5–8 per kilogram as uranium or sulfur hexafluoride, but many times {{more as an}} element because of handling challenges. Most processes using free fluorine in large amounts employ in situ generation under <b>vertical</b> <b>integration.</b>|$|E
5|$|Grid parity, {{the point}} at which the cost of {{photovoltaic}} electricity is equal to or cheaper than the price of grid power, is more easily achieved in areas with abundant sun and high costs for electricity such as in California and Japan. In 2008, The levelized cost of electricity for solar PV was $0.25/kWh or less in most of the OECD countries. By late 2011, the fully loaded cost was predicted to fall below $0.15/kWh for most of the OECD and to reach $0.10/kWh in sunnier regions. These cost levels are driving three emerging trends: <b>vertical</b> <b>integration</b> of the supply chain, origination of power purchase agreements (PPAs) by solar power companies, and unexpected risk for traditional power generation companies, grid operators and wind turbine manufacturers.|$|E
25|$|Tesla's {{production}} strategy {{includes a}} high degree of <b>vertical</b> <b>integration</b> (80% in 2016 according), which includes component production and proprietary charging infrastructure. The company operates enormous factories to capture economies of scale. Tesla builds electric powertrain components for vehicles from other automakers, including the Smart ED2 ForTwo electric drive (the lowest-priced car from Daimler AG), the Toyota RAV4 EV, and Freightliner's Custom Chassis Electric Van. <b>Vertical</b> <b>integration</b> is rare in the automotive industry, where companies typically outsource 80% of components to suppliers, and focus on engine manufacturing and final assembly.|$|E
30|$|Economies of scope: the {{combination}} of complementary skills {{can result in a}} more efficient way of producing. Economies of scope arise whenever the total cost of producing two different goods or services jointly is lower than producing each of the goods separately (<b>vertical</b> <b>integrations).</b> Within a logistics context, investing MNE can specialize {{while at the same time}} broadening their services through <b>vertical</b> <b>integrations</b> (Table  2); they can offer better quality of service at lower costs (e.g. in terms of speed, frequency of deliveries, geographical coverage, reliability of delivery times etc.) [6, 9].|$|R

25|$|Banks {{also earned}} revenue by securitizing debt, {{particularly}} mortgage debt {{prior to the}} financial crisis. Investment banks have become concerned that lenders are securitizing in-house, driving the investment banks to pursue <b>vertical</b> <b>integration</b> by becoming lenders, which is allowed in the United States since {{the repeal of the}} Glass–Steagall Act in 1999.|$|E
25|$|Oil {{companies}} {{including the}} supermajors {{have begun to}} fund research into alternative fuel. BP has invested {{half a billion dollars}} for research over the next several years. The motivations behind such moves are to acquire the patent rights as well as understanding the technology so <b>vertical</b> <b>integration</b> of the future industry could be achieved.|$|E
30|$|It {{results that}} inward {{logistics}} FDI are mainly horizontal, that is they {{operate in the}} same parent company’s sub-industry, and are mainly driven by market power’ and economies of scale’ increase. <b>Vertical</b> <b>integrations,</b> which are in a logistics sub-industry differing from the MNE’s one, are driven by competitive considerations, {{by the need to}} reach economies of scope and reduce transaction costs. The conglomerate integrations, which are mainly undertaken by financial and real estate investors and manufacturing firms, are motivated by the need to achieve economies of scale and reduce transaction costs.|$|R
40|$|Suppose {{consumers}} buy {{complementary goods}} sequentially from several monopolists. If prices cannot be contracted on, {{there may be}} no sale in a one-shot game due to the holdup problem. Dynamic interaction of agents attenuates the problem. In equilibrium, the first and the last monopolist capture the entire monopoly profit while the other monopolists break even. <b>Vertical</b> <b>integrations</b> that exclude the last monopolist neither lower the price nor increase social welfare. On the other hand, partial integrations that include the last monopoly can reduce the combined profit and hence may never occur despite the welfare-improving potential. ...|$|R

Thus, instead of alleviating the balance of payments problems, import substitution increased them dramatically.|$|E
40|$|This article {{analyzes}} the structural antecedents {{of the corporate}} name strategy in approximately 300 large mergers and acquisitions completed between 2001 and 2006. Six propositions are formulated drawing on previous empirical work. We define brand strategies as conservative when the new entity adopts the acquirer's or the target's corporate name. In turn, brand strategies are innovative {{in the case of}} a mixed or new name. Probit regressions show that divisional acquisitions, <b>vertical</b> <b>integrations,</b> diversifications and the sectors involved do not affect the probability of the strategy being innovative. On the other hand, innovative brand strategies are more probable in the case of mergers (as opposed to acquisitions), horizontal M&As and financial investments...|$|R
40|$|Submillimeter wave {{heterodyne}} radiometry {{has been}} applied to the detection and sounding of upper atmospheric constituents. The use of room-temperature Schottky-diode mixers for the receivers has yielded measurements of 70, 000 K noise temperature. Coupling losses into the diode and matching of the IF output limit are observed to limit noise temperature. The technique is evaluated by calculating spectra with assumed temperature and constituent profiles. <b>Vertical</b> <b>integrations</b> are made with a multilayer atmosphere and the direct summation of absorption coefficients for the individual spectral lines is used.

25|$|The {{benefits}} of high market share naturally {{led to an}} interest in growth strategies. The relative advantages of horizontal integration, <b>vertical</b> <b>integration,</b> diversification, franchises, mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures and organic growth were discussed. Other research indicated that a low market share strategy could still be very profitable. Schumacher (1973), Woo and Cooper (1982), Levenson (1984), and later Traverso (2002) showed how smaller niche players obtained very high returns.|$|E

40|$|Sustainable {{development}} {{needs to}} be tackled at all governmental levels. Moreover, policies need to be integrated, horizontally and vertically. This article studies the efforts of subnational governments and their strategies towards <b>vertical</b> policy <b>integration.</b> Four cases are compared: Quebec (Canada), Flanders (Belgium), North Rhine-Westphalia (Germany) and North Holland (the Netherlands). The assumption is that their approach is determined by their degree of autonomy, which involves their competences within their own borders (self-rule), and their influence on national decision making (shared rule). The findings, however, show that degree of autonomy does not shape the subnational governments’ stance towards <b>vertical</b> policy <b>integration</b> for sustainable development. Rather, it is influenced by other factors, such as political dynamics. The analysis also puts forward {{that the degree of}} self-rule of subnational governments has a large influence on the content of sustainable development policies, not only at the subnational, but also at the national level. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|Often, large {{multinational}} corporations exhibit <b>vertical</b> <b>integration,</b> {{participating in a}} broad range of drug discovery and development, manufacturing and quality control, marketing, sales, and distribution. Smaller organizations, on the other hand, often focus on a specific aspect such as discovering drug candidates or developing formulations. Often, collaborative agreements between research organizations and large pharmaceutical companies are formed to explore the potential of new drug substances. More recently, multi-nationals are increasingly relying on contract research organizations to manage drug development.|$|E
25|$|The {{electricity}} Law in El Salvador affords a {{high degree}} of liberty to market agents. Article 8 explicitly authorizes <b>vertical</b> <b>integration</b> in generation, transmission, distribution and supply. The only limitation consists of prohibiting generation, distribution and supply companies from owning shares in Etesal (Empresa Transmisora de El Salvador, S.A. de C.V.), the transmission company that resulted from the restructuring of CEL. Such an allowance, together with the organization of a price-based spot market, is surprising in a small system with few operators.|$|E
