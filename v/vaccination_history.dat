50|$|While the Haemophilus influenzae {{bacteria}} {{is unable}} to survive in any environment outside of the human body, humans can carry the bacteria within their bodies without developing any symptoms of the disease. It spreads through the air when an individual carrying the bacteria coughs or sneezes. The risk of developing Haemophilus meningitis is most directly related to an individual's <b>vaccination</b> <b>history,</b> {{as well as the}} <b>vaccination</b> <b>history</b> of the general public. Herd immunity, or the protection that unvaccinated individuals experience when the majority of others in their proximity are vaccinated, does help in the reduction of meningitis cases, but it does not guarantee protection from the disease. Contact with other individuals with the disease also vastly increases the risk of infection. A child in the presence of family members sick with Haemophilus meningitis or carrying the bacteria is 585 times more likely to catch Haemophilus meningitis. Additionally, siblings of individuals with the Haemophilus influenzae meningitis receive reduced benefits from certain types of immunization. Similarly, children under two years of age have a greater risk of contracting the disease when attending day care, especially in their first month of attendance, due to the maintained contact with other children who might be asymptomatic carriers of the Hib bacteria.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The National Immunization Survey (NIS) uses {{two phases}} of data {{collection}} to obtain vaccination information from a sample of young children: a random-digit-dialing (RDD) survey for identifying households with children 19 - 35 months of age, followed by a mail survey for obtaining provider-reported <b>vaccination</b> <b>histories</b> about these children. Provider-reported <b>vaccination</b> <b>histories</b> are used to estimate vaccination coverage rates. In 1998, provider-reported <b>vaccination</b> <b>histories</b> were not obtained for 32. 9 % of children with a completed RDD interview. This report describes the statistical methods adopted in 1998 to reduce the bias in vaccination coverage estimates that could result from "vaccination history nonresponse," that is, differences between children for whom provider data was obtained and those for whom it was not obtained. METHODS: In the methods adopted in 1998, children with completed NIS RDD interviews are grouped into adjustment cells defined by their propensity to have adequate provider data. Sampling weights of children with adequate provider data are divided by the cell-specific weighted response rate to allow these children to represent all children in the cell. RESULTS: Using an "optimal" number of cells, the overall extent of bias reduction was 0. 5 %, suggesting that provider nonresponse bias was small. Authoritative literature suggests using five cells. No statistically significant differences were observed in vaccination coverage estimates when comparing estimates based on the "optimal" number of cells with five cells. Thus, five adjustment cells are used to reduce provider nonresponse bias in the NIS vaccination coverage estimates. No substantively important differences were observed between estimates based on the methodology used prior to 1998 and the methodology adopted in 1998. Philip J. Smith,. N. K. Rao, Michael P.

50|$|Here {{there is}} a {{difference}} in US and UK guidelines; in the US testers are told to ignore the possibility of false positive due to the BCG vaccine, as the BCG is seen as having waning efficacy over time. Therefore, the CDC urges that individuals be treated based on risk stratification regardless of BCG <b>vaccination</b> <b>history,</b> and if an individual receives a negative and then a positive TST they will be assessed for full TB treatment beginning with X-ray to confirm TB is not active and proceeding from there. Conversely, the UK guidelines acknowledge the potential effect of the BCG vaccination, as it is mandatory and therefore a prevalent concern - though the UK shares the procedure of administering two tests, one week apart, and accepting the second one as the accurate result, they also assume that a second positive is indicative of an old infection (and therefore certainly LTBI) or the BCG itself. In the case of BCG vaccinations confusing the results, Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) tests may be used as they will not be affected by the BCG.|$|E

5000|$|In Germany, the Standing Vaccination Committee (STIKO) is {{the federal}} {{commission}} responsible for recommending an immunization schedule. The Robert Koch Institute in Berlin (RKI) compiles data of immunization status upon the entry of children at school, and measures vaccine coverage of Germany at a national level. Founded in 1972, the STIKO is composed of 12-18 volunteers, appointed members by the Federal Ministry for Health for 3-year terms. Members include experts from many scientific disciplines and public health fields and professionals with extensive experience on vaccination. The independent advisory group meets biannually to address issues pertaining to preventable infectious diseases. Although the STIKO makes recommendations, immunization in Germany is voluntary {{and there are no}} official government recommendations. German Federal States typically follow the Standing Vaccination Committee's recommendations minimally, although each state can make recommendations for their geographic jurisdiction that extends beyond the recommended list. In addition to the proposed immunization schedule for children and adults, the STIKO recommends vaccinations for occupational groups, police, travelers, and other at risk groups. Vaccinations recommendations that are issued must be in accordance with the Protection Against Infection Act (Infektionsschutzgesetz), which regulates the prevention of infectious diseases in humans. If a vaccination is recommended because of occupational risks, it must adhere to the Occupational Safety and Health Act involving Biological Agents. Criteria for the recommendation include disease burden, efficacy and effectiveness, safety, feasibility of program implementation, cost-effectiveness evaluation, clinical trial results, and equity in access to the vaccine. In the event of vaccination related injuries, federal states are responsible for monetary compensation. [...] Germany's central government does not finance childhood immunizations, so 90% of vaccines are administered in a private physician's office and paid for through insurance. The other 10% of vaccines are provided by the states in public health clinics, schools, or day care centers by local immunization programs. Physician responsibilities concerning immunization include beginning infancy vaccination, administering booster vaccinations, maintaining medical and <b>vaccination</b> <b>history,</b> and giving information and recommendations concerning vaccines.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Since 1994 the National Immunization Survey (NIS) has {{monitored}} {{progress toward}} the Healthy People 2000 and 2010 vaccination goals. The NIS collects data in two phases: first, a random-digit-dialing (RDD) telephone survey to identify households with children 19 - 35 months old and, second, a mail survey to vaccination providers to obtain <b>vaccination</b> <b>histories</b> used to estimate vaccination coverage rates. This report reviews the methodologies used in the 1994 - 2002 NIS to obtain official estimates of vaccination coverage and describes the methodology used {{for the first three}} topical modules of the NIS. METHODS: From 1994 to 1997 the NIS used a variation of a two-phase estimator to compensate for missing provider-reported <b>vaccination</b> <b>histories.</b> Between 1998 and 2001 a weighting-class estimator was used. In 2002 and thereafter the weighting-class approach was refined to account for households that do not have telephones and for unvaccinated children. To collect data on immunization-related topics, the NIS sample was randomized among three topical modules: health insurance and ability to pay for vaccinations (HIM); parental knowledge and experiences about vaccinations (PKM); and daycare attendance, breastfeeding practices, and participation in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (DCM). RESULTS: In 2001 among children with completed RDD interviews, 0. 3 percent were entirely unvaccinated. Together, the new nontelephone adjustment and the refinement for unvaccinated children yielded revised estimates that were within 1. 5 percentage points of the original estimates obtained using the 1998 - 2001 methodology. Over the six quarters during which the first three topical modules were fielded (from mid- 2001 through 2002), 21, 163 children were randomized to the HIM, 3576 to the PKM, and 3511 to the DCM.

40|$|INTRODUCTION In 1994 a pilot-study of the {{so-called}} PIENTER-project was carried out. The aim of this project {{is to establish a}} serum bank of a representative sample of the Dutch population. The serum bank will be used to estimate age-specific immunity of the general population against childhood diseases of the Netherlands Immunisation Programme, the incidence of infectious diseases with a frequent subclinical course and the prevalence of serum-derterminants of other illnesses. The questionnaire used in the pilot-study was evaluated in order to develop a questionnaire for the nation-wide data collection. AIM Evaluation of the questionnaire used for data collection in a pilot of a cross-sectional population-based study in the province of Utrecht. METHODS A sample of four municipalities weighted by the number of inhabitants was taken out of the municipalities in the Province of Utrecht. 510 persons in the age strata 0, 1 - 4, 5 - 9 to 75 - 79 years were randomly selected from the populations registers of these four municipalities. The participants have been asked to give some blood and to fill in a questionnaire. They have been requested to bring their vaccination certificates of the Dutch immunisation programme, of vaccination on the occasion travelling to the tropics and of military service. These vaccination data were registered on a study form. The opinion of the participants on the length and clarity of the questionnaire and the frequency of missing values for all questions were described. The population proportions weighted by age for self-reported <b>vaccination</b> <b>history</b> and the relation with religion were given. Self-reported <b>vaccination</b> <b>history</b> for diphteria, pertussis, tetanus, poliomyelitis and mumps, measles and rubella was compared with information on the <b>vaccination</b> <b>history</b> derived from the vaccination certificate of the Dutch immunisation programme. The proportions weighted by age for self-perception of health status, nationality and level of education were compared with the figures of the Netherlands Central Bureau of Statistics for the Dutch general population. The expected number of persons in subgroups for level of education, religion, nationality, ethnicity and participation on the Dutch immunisation programme in the nation-wide study were calculated on the basis of results of the pilot. In order to calculate the expected precision of the estimates of the seroprevalence in these subgroups to be reached in the nation-wide study, the serological results for hepatitis A in the pilot were used. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS The results confirm a difference in <b>vaccination</b> <b>history</b> and attitude of persons who belong to specific religious groups who reject vaccination. These persons reported more frequent that they were not (completely) vaccinated and adhere more often the opinion that vaccination was not necessary. They also reported more frequently principal refusal as the reason for incomplete vaccination. However, most persons who belong to a religion from which it is known that vaccination is refused, reported that vaccination was completed. As religion and <b>vaccination</b> <b>history</b> are correlated, {{it is important for the}} analysis of seroprevalence data to collect data on religion. The self-reported <b>vaccination</b> <b>history</b> for diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, poliomyelitis, mumps, measles and rubella did not agree with the vaccination certificates of the Dutch immunisation programme. Participants frequently reported that the questions on <b>vaccination</b> <b>history</b> were not clear to them. Therefore in the nation-wide study questions on <b>vaccination</b> <b>history</b> will be limited. Information on <b>vaccination</b> <b>history</b> registered in the vaccination certificates of the Dutch immunisation programme will be collected. In comparison with the figures from the Central Bureau of Statistics persons without the Dutch nationality were underrepresented in the pilot of the Pienter-project. The participants of the Pienter-project might have been not representative for the level of education. The self-perception of health status were comparable with the Central Bureau of Statistics. The precision of seroprevalence to be expected in the nation-wide data collection seems reliable for subgroups of sex, level of education and persons who report to have participated in the Dutch immunisation programme. In contrast no subgroup analysis (unless special actions are taken to increase the response) will be possible for persons with a non-Dutch nationality or ethnicity. For reliable seroprevalence estimates for persons (younger than 40 year) who have not participated in the Dutch Immunisation Programme and persons who belong to a religion from which it is known that vaccination is refused research has to be carried out in municipalities with a low vaccin coverage such that the number of persons in these subgroups will increase...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Identification of {{pregnant}} women susceptible to rubella is important as vaccination can be given postpartum to prevent future risks of congenital rubella syndrome. However, in Malaysia, rubella antibody screening is not offered routinely to pregnant women in public funded health clinics due to cost constraint. Instead, a history of rubella vaccination is asked to be provided to establish the women’s risk for rubella infection. The usefulness of this history, however, is not established. Thus, this paper aimed to determine the usefulness {{of a history of}} rubella vaccination in determining rubella susceptibility in pregnant women. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on 500 pregnant women attending a public funded health clinic.

40|$|Since 1991, 6 {{years after}} the {{recommendation}} of universal childhood triple vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella (M + M + R), Switzerland has been confronted with {{an increasing number of}} mumps cases affecting both vaccinated and unvaccinated children. The M + M + R vaccine mainly used in the Swiss population after 1986 contains the highly attenuated Rubini strain of mumps virus. We analysed an outbreak of 102 suspected mumps cases by virus isolation, determination of IgM antibodies to mumps virus in 27 acute phase sera, and verification of <b>vaccination</b> <b>histories.</b> Mumps was confirmed by virus isolation in 88 patients, of whom 72 had previously received the Rubini vaccine strain. IgM antibodies to mumps virus were detected in 24 / 27 acute phase serum samples. A group of 92 subjects from the same geographic area without signs of mumps virus infection served as controls. IgG antibodies to mumps virus and vaccination status were assessed in these children. The vaccination rate in these controls was 61 %, with equal seropositivity for unvaccinated and Rubini-vaccinated subjects. These data support other recent reports which indicate an insufficient protective efficacy of current mumps vaccines...|$|R
40|$|Serum {{neutralizing}} {{antibodies to}} polioviruses were titrated in serum samples from 182 police cadets aged 16 - 18 years before and, in 168 of the cadets, 6 weeks after vaccination {{with a single}} dose of oral polio vaccine (OPV). Faecal excretion of poliovirus was also followed. <b>Vaccination</b> <b>histories</b> were obtained and confirmed whenever possible. Pre-vaccination antibody could not be detected against type 1 in 9 - 3 % cadets, against type 2 in 2 - 7 % and against type 3 in 7 - 7 %. Absence of antibody {{to at least one}} virus type was found in 14 - 3 % of the cadets. In 93 cadets in whom <b>vaccination</b> <b>histories</b> could be confirmed 40 had received only inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) previously; of these 23 % lacked antibody to at least one virus type, and they had less intestinal immunity to a challenge dose of OPV than those previously given OPV. Only two of the cadets known to have had OPV were non-immune - both had received a single dose following full courses of IPV. However, cadets who had received OPV had their last dose of vaccine more recently (average 4 - 6 years) than those who had received only IPV (all 12 years or more). The serum antibody response to a single booster dose of OPV, and the faecal excretion of each type of virus after vaccination, showed an inverse relation to the corresponding pre-vaccination antibody concentration. A single dose of OPV did not reliably boost the immunity of those who possessed adequate immunity, and a failure to respond was also observed in a proportion of the cadets with no detectable antibody, mostly in the case of type 3 antibody and particularly if antibody to types 1 or 2 virus was also absent. No evidence was obtained that intestinal immunity could be expected in the absence of detectable circulating antibody. The reasons for the absence of a serological response to OPV in some subjects are discussed and consideration is given to the practical significance of the findings. It is suggested that reinforcement of polio immunity at school-leaving is important, particularly at the present time when many of those aged 16 - 18 years will have been vaccinated only with IPV. A single dose of OPV is not ideal for this purpose, not only because a small proportion of persons are liable to be left unprotected, but also because failure to produce a reliable boost in persons with adequate immunity at the time of vaccination gives rise to the possibility that they may become susceptible later in adult life...|$|R
40|$|Canine {{distemper}} virus (CDV) -specific {{immune response}} {{was measured in}} different dog populations. Three groups of vaccinated or wild-type virus exposed dogs were tested: dogs with a known <b>vaccination</b> <b>history,</b> dogs without a known <b>vaccination</b> <b>history</b> (shelter dogs), and dogs with potential exposure to wild-type CDV. The use of a T-cell proliferation assay demonstrated a detectable CDV-specific T-cell response from both spleen and blood lymphocytes of dogs. Qualitatively, antibody assays [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and neutralization assay] predicted {{the presence of a}} T-cell response well, although quantitatively neither antibody assays nor the T-cell assay correlated well with each other. An interesting finding from our study was that half of the dogs in shelters were not vaccinated (potentially posing a public veterinary health problem) and that antibody levels in dogs living in an environment with endemic CDV were lower than in vaccinated animals...|$|E

40|$|A mass {{immunization}} {{campaign with}} a Urabe-containing measles-mumps-rubella vaccine {{was carried out}} in 1997 in the city of Salvador, northeastern Brazil, with a target population of children aged 1 – 11 years. There was an outbreak of aseptic meningitis following the mass campaign. Cases of aseptic meningitis were ascertained through data collected from the records of children admitted to the local referral hospital for infectious diseases between March and October of 1997, using previously defined eligibility criteria. <b>Vaccination</b> <b>histories</b> were obtained through home visits of telephone calls. Eighty-seven cases fulfilled the study criteria. Of those, 58 cases were diagnosed after the vaccination campaign. An elevated risk of aseptic meningitis was observed 3 weeks after Brazil's national vaccination day compared with the risk in the prevaccination period (relative risk = 14. 3; 95 % confidence interval: 7. 9, 25. 7). This result was confirmed by a case series analysis (relative risk = 30. 4; 95 % confidence interval: 11. 5, 80. 8). The estimated risk of aseptic meningitis was 1 in 14, 000 doses. This study confirms a link between measles-mumps-rubella vaccination and aseptic meningitis. The authors discuss the implications of this for the organization and planning of mass immunization campaigns...|$|R
40|$|Influenza viruses undergo {{frequent}} antigenic changes. As a result, {{the viruses}} circulating change {{within and between}} seasons, and {{the composition of the}} influenza vaccine is updated annually. Thus, estimation of the vaccine's effectiveness is not constant across seasons. In order to provide annual estimates of the influenza vaccine's effectiveness, health departments have increasingly adopted the "test-negative design," using enhanced data from routine surveillance systems. In this design, patients presenting to participating general practitioners with influenza-like illness are swabbed for laboratory testing; those testing positive for influenza virus are defined as cases, and those testing negative form the comparison group. Data on patients' <b>vaccination</b> <b>histories</b> and confounder profiles are also collected. Vaccine effectiveness is estimated from the odds ratio comparing the odds of testing positive for influenza among vaccinated patients and unvaccinated patients, adjusting for confounders. The test-negative design is purported to reduce bias associated with confounding by health-care-seeking behavior and misclassification of cases. In this paper, we use directed acyclic graphs to characterize potential biases in studies of influenza vaccine effectiveness using the test-negative design. We show how studies using this design can avoid or minimize bias and where bias may be introduced with particular study design variations. Sheena G. Sullivan, Eric J. Tchetgen Tchetgen, Benjamin J.

40|$|Background. Influenza {{vaccines}} may be reformulated annually {{because of}} antigenic drift in influenza viruses. However, {{the relationship between}} antigenic characteristics of circulating viruses and vaccine effectiveness (VE) is not well understood. We conducted {{an assessment of the}} effectiveness of US influenza vaccines during the 2010 – 2011 season. Methods. We performed a case–control study comparing <b>vaccination</b> <b>histories</b> between subjects with acute respiratory illness with positive real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for influenza and influ-enza test-negative controls. Subjects with acute respiratory illness of ≤ 7 days duration were enrolled in hospitals, emergency departments, or outpatient clinics in communities in 4 states. History of immunization with the 2010 – 2011 vaccine was ascertained from vaccine registries or medical records. Vaccine effectiveness was estimated in logistic regression models adjusted for study community, age, race, insurance status, enrollment site, and presence of a high-risk medical condition. Results. A total of 1040 influenza-positive cases and 3717 influenza-negative controls were included from the influenza season, including 373 cases of influenza A(H 1 N 1), 334 cases of influenza A(H 3 N 2), and 333 cases of influenza B. Overall adjusted VE was 60 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 53 %– 66 %). Age-specific VE estimate...|$|R
