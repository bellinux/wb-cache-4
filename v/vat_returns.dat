5000|$|Bilta (UK) Ltd ("Bilta"), {{a company}} {{incorporated}} in England, seeks through its joint liquidators, Mr Hellard and Mr Ingram, to recover damages or equitable compensation {{in respect of}} its alleged loss. As against the directors, Bilta claims damages for conspiracy or equitable compensation for breach of fiduciary duty. The conspiracy {{is alleged to have}} been an unlawful means conspiracy, and the unlawful means are the directors' alleged breach of their fiduciary duties. As against Jetivia and Mr Brunschweiler, Bilta claims damages for conspiracy or compensation for dishonest assistance in the directors' breach of their fiduciary duties. Since the matter comes before the court on Jetivia's and Mr Brunschweiler's application for the claims against them to be summarily struck out or dismissed, it is to be assumed for present purposes that the factual allegations made in Bilta's amended particulars of claim are capable of proof, and {{there is no need to}} repeat the word [...] "alleged" [...] whenever referring to the defendants' conduct. The liquidators also pursue a separate claim for fraudulent trading under section 213 of IA 1986. Jetivia is a Swiss company and Mr Brunschweiler, who is resident in France, is its sole director.Bilta had two directors, Mr Nazir and Mr Chopra ("the directors"), who are the first and second defendants. Mr Chopra owned all the issued shares. Bilta was registered for the purposes of VAT. Its only trading activity, which took place between 22 April and 21 July 2009, was trading in European Emissions Trading Scheme Allowances ("EUAs"), which are commonly known as carbon credits. EUAs were treated as taxable supplies under the VAT Act 1994 until 31 July 2009. Since then they have been zero-rated. The VAT status of supplies of the EUAs at the relevant time explains Bilta's activities.In short, Bilta bought large numbers of EUAs from overseas suppliers, including Jetivia, free of VAT, and sold them in the UK with VAT to companies described as [...] "first line buffers", which immediately sold them on. The price for which Bilta sold the EUAs was lower before VAT than the price at which it bought, and Bilta was therefore never going to be in a position to meet its liabilities to HM Revenue and Customs ("HMRC"). Bilta had minimal capital and was insolvent virtually from the outset. The money payable to Bilta, including the VAT due to HMRC, was either paid to Bilta and paid on by it to its overseas supplier, or was paid by the first line buffer (or a later company in the chain) directly to Bilta's supplier, or was otherwise paid to offshore accounts. At the end of the chain the EUAs would be resold to a company outside the UK, generating a right to a VAT refund. It is a familiar kind of carousel or missing trader fraud.Bilta was insolvent throughout the period of its trading in EUAs. In that three-month period, Bilta sold more than 5.7m EUAs for about £294m. Its liability for VAT on those transactions amounts to £38,733,444. It did not submit any <b>VAT</b> <b>returns</b> to HMRC. On the application of HMRC Mr Hellard and Mr Ingram were appointed provisional liquidators of Bilta on 29 September 2009. They commenced the company's claim against the defendants who were its directors and other parties, including the appellants. The company was compulsorily wound up on 25 November 2009. The proceedings were amended on 13 October 2011 to include the liquidators' claims under section 213 of IA 1986.|$|E

In order to increase tax revenue, the government did tax reform. First, the government changed the system of taxation Official Assessment System (OAS) into a Self Assessment System (SAS) however, these efforts have not been optimal because SAS instead increases tax compliance costs. In the next tax reform, the government build a modern tax administration system one of which is the e-invoice. A tax invoice online application maker to lower the cost of VAT compliance. The {{purpose of this study was}} to: 1) find changes in tax compliance costs component based on descriptions of voting procedures to reporting <b>VAT</b> <b>return</b> period before and after e-invoicing; 2) describe the role of e-invoice in changing compliance costs suffered by the taxpayer; 3) know the amount difference of VAT tax compliance costs before and after e-invoice.

After importing, the fraudster sells the goods to another trader charging the price of the goods plus VAT, but doesn't pass on the VAT to the Government. He becomes a [...] "missing trader". The buyer which has paid the VAT to the fraudster, can deduct the same VAT amount on his <b>VAT</b> <b>return.</b> Afterwards, the same goods will be zero-rated for export. This way, the Government has lost the entire VAT that should be paid on the goods, rather than the fraction of it that would be paid for just one stage of the production process.

40|$|I present three {{essays in}} this thesis. The first essay investigates the {{decision}} of small businesses with respect to an optional Flat Rate Scheme (FRS) in the UK. FRS replaces VAT with a turnover tax providing some traders with a tax saving opportunity. Using the universe of <b>VAT</b> <b>returns</b> between 2004 - 05 and 2010 - 11, I find 26 percent of eligible traders have non-negative tax gains from FRS. I show gains are highly persistent and not so small, yet only 3 percent of gainers join the scheme after one year. Temporal and spatial correlations point to information frictions and learning as potential explanatory factors. Results show traders registering after introduction of FRS and those registering in high FRS density areas {{are more likely to}} join the scheme. The second essay estimates stimulus effect of the temporary reduction in the standard VAT rate in the UK. From 1 December 2008 to 31 December 2009, the standard-rate was reduced from 17. 5 to 15 percent. I use the universe of <b>VAT</b> <b>returns</b> submitted to HMRC between 2002 and 2010 q 1 q 4 and compare changes in sales growth of standard-rated traders during the cut to that of zero-rated traders (difference-in-differences). To control for heterogeneous recession effects, I first rely solely on post-recession observations and utilize the fact that the cut and the recession don't fully overlap. Second, I allow for sector specific recession impacts. Both strategies show a small insignificant impact on gross sales and purchases which suggest a proportionate increase in quantity demanded in response to the tax induced price cut. The third essay estimates the impact of Iran Iraq war on educational attainment of children. I use a two percent sample of 2006 Iran Population Census, and compare exposed cohorts in war provinces to unexposed cohorts (difference-indifferences). The estimates suggest probability of finishing high school is respectively reduced by 4. 8 and 1. 9 percentage points for cohorts exposed to war in early childhood and those exposed during schooling (former significant at 10 percent, latter insignificant). Interestingly, the war impact on early childhood cohorts is robust to controlling for differential linear trends while the impact on school cohorts is not...|$|E
