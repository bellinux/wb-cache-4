5|$|Given these risks, as {{smallpox}} became effectively eradicated and {{the number}} of naturally occurring cases fell below the number of vaccine-induced illnesses and deaths, routine childhood <b>vaccination</b> was discontinued in the United States in 1972, and was abandoned in most European countries in the early 1970s. Routine <b>vaccination</b> of health care workers was discontinued in the U.S. in 1976, and among military recruits in 1990 (although military personnel deploying to the Middle East and Korea still receive the <b>vaccination).</b> By 1986, routine <b>vaccination</b> had ceased in all countries. It is now primarily recommended for laboratory workers at risk for occupational exposure.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1880s, Wallace was {{drawn into the}} debate over {{mandatory}} smallpox <b>vaccination.</b> Wallace originally saw the issue {{as a matter of}} personal liberty; but, after studying some of the statistics provided by anti-vaccination activists, he began to question the efficacy of <b>vaccination.</b> At the time, the germ theory of disease was very new and far from universally accepted. Moreover, no one knew enough about the human immune system to understand why <b>vaccination</b> worked. When Wallace did some research, he discovered instances where supporters of <b>vaccination</b> had used questionable, in a few cases completely phony, statistics to support their arguments. Always suspicious of authority, Wallace suspected that physicians had a vested interest in promoting <b>vaccination,</b> and became convinced that reductions in the incidence of smallpox that had been attributed to <b>vaccination</b> were, in fact, due to better hygiene and improvements in public sanitation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} whether paediatricians have appropriate knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours regarding <b>vaccinations</b> for infants in Italy. Methods A random sample of 500 paediatricians received a self-administered anonymous questionnaire covering demographic and professional characteristics; knowledge about the mandatory, recommended, and not indicated <b>vaccinations</b> for infants; attitudes about <b>vaccinations</b> for infants; behaviour regarding current administration or willingness to administer mandatory or recommended <b>vaccinations</b> for infants and immunization education programs of the parents. Results Only 42. 3 % paediatricians knew all recommended <b>vaccinations</b> for infants and this knowledge was significantly higher in females, in those who worked a higher number of hours for week, and in those who use guidelines for immunization practice. Only 10. 3 % had a very favourable attitude towards the utility of the recommended <b>vaccinations</b> for infants and this was significantly higher in those who administered recommended <b>vaccinations</b> for infants. A large proportion (82. 7 %) of paediatricians routinely informed the parents about the recommended <b>vaccinations</b> for infants and this appropriate behaviour was significantly higher among younger, in those with a higher number of years in practice, and in those who administered the recommended <b>vaccinations</b> for infants. Conclusion Training and educational interventions are needed in order to improve knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours regarding <b>vaccinations</b> for infants among paediatricians. </p...|$|R
5|$|Long-term active {{memory is}} {{acquired}} following infection by activation of B and T cells. Active immunity {{can also be}} generated artificially, through <b>vaccination.</b> The principle behind <b>vaccination</b> (also called immunization) is to introduce an antigen from a pathogen in order to stimulate {{the immune system and}} develop specific immunity against that particular pathogen without causing disease associated with that organism. This deliberate induction of an immune response is successful because it exploits the natural specificity of the immune system, as well as its inducibility. With infectious disease remaining one of the leading causes of death in the human population, <b>vaccination</b> represents the most effective manipulation of the immune system mankind has developed.|$|E
5|$|Smallpox <b>vaccination</b> {{within three}} days of {{exposure}} will prevent or significantly lessen the severity of smallpox symptoms {{in the vast majority}} of people. <b>Vaccination</b> four to seven days after exposure can offer some protection from disease or may modify the severity of disease. Other than <b>vaccination,</b> treatment of smallpox is primarily supportive, such as wound care and infection control, fluid therapy, and possible ventilator assistance. Flat and hemorrhagic types of smallpox are treated with the same therapies used to treat shock, such as fluid resuscitation. People with semi-confluent and confluent types of smallpox may have therapeutic issues similar to patients with extensive skin burns.|$|E
5|$|Some {{cases may}} be {{triggered}} by the influenza virus and potentially influenza vaccine. An increased incidence of Guillain–Barré syndrome followed influenza immunization that followed the 1976 swine flu outbreak (H1N1A/NJ/76); 8.8 cases per million recipients developed the complication. Since then, close monitoring of cases attributable to <b>vaccination</b> has demonstrated that influenza itself can induce GBS. Small increases in incidence have been observed in subsequent <b>vaccination</b> campaigns, {{but not to the}} same extent. The 2009 flu pandemic vaccine (against pandemic swine flu virus H1N1/PDM09) did not cause a significant increase in cases. It is considered that the benefits of <b>vaccination</b> in preventing influenza outweigh the small risks of GBS after <b>vaccination.</b> Even those who have previously experienced Guillain–Barré syndrome are considered safe to receive the vaccine in the future. Other vaccines, such as those against poliomyelitis, tetanus or measles, have not been associated with a risk of GBS.|$|E
40|$|Even {{women who}} are {{vigilant}} about their children’s <b>vaccinations</b> tend to neglect their own <b>vaccinations</b> or simply are not aware {{that the need for}} certain <b>vaccinations</b> continues throughout adulthood. <b>Vaccinations</b> are an important component of overall health, and healthcare providers should be sure their patients know this. Women, typically their family’s gatekeepers to healthcare, particularly need to understand the impor-tance of staying current with <b>vaccinations.</b> There are 2 new vaccines to incorporate into women’s routine immunization schedule: the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, indicated for girls and younger women, and the herpes zoster vac-cine, indicated for older adults. Educating patients about these new vaccines is crucial to promoting their acceptance and also gives providers the opportunity to offer other needed <b>vaccinations...</b>|$|R

5|$|Although {{poliovirus}} transmission {{has been}} interrupted {{in much of}} the world, transmission of wild poliovirus does continue and creates an ongoing risk for the importation of wild poliovirus into previously polio-free regions. If importations of poliovirus occur, outbreaks of poliomyelitis may develop, especially in areas with low <b>vaccination</b> coverage and poor sanitation. As a result, high levels of <b>vaccination</b> coverage must be maintained. In November 2013, the World Health Organization announced a polio outbreak in Syria. In response, the Armenian government put out a notice asking Syrian Armenians under age 15 to get the polio vaccine. As of 2014, polio virus has spread out to ten countries mainly in Africa, Asia and the Middle East with Pakistan, Syria and Cameroon advising vaccinations to outbound travelers.|$|E

5|$|An enhanced-potency IPV (inactivated polio vaccine) was {{licensed}} in the United States in November 1987, and {{is currently}} the vaccine of choice in the United States. The first dose of polio vaccine is given shortly after birth, usually between 1 and 2 months of age, a second dose is given at 4 months of age. The timing of the third dose depends on the vaccine formulation but should be given between 6 and 18 months of age. A booster <b>vaccination</b> is given at 4 to 6 years of age, {{for a total of}} four doses at or before school entry. In some countries, a fifth <b>vaccination</b> is given during adolescence. Routine <b>vaccination</b> of adults (18 years of age and older) in developed countries is neither necessary nor recommended because most adults are already immune and have a very small risk of exposure to wild poliovirus in their home countries. In 2002, a pentavalent (five-component) combination vaccine (called Pediarix) containing IPV was approved for use in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor in}} Wallace's {{thinking}} was his belief that, {{because of the}} action of natural selection, organisms were {{in a state of}} balance with their environment, and that everything in nature, even disease-causing organisms, served a useful purpose in the natural order of things; he feared <b>vaccination</b> might upset that natural balance with unfortunate results. Wallace and other anti-vaccinationists pointed out that <b>vaccination,</b> which at the time was often done in a sloppy and unsanitary manner, could be dangerous.|$|E

5|$|The {{infection}} {{has been}} preventable by <b>vaccination</b> since 1982. <b>Vaccination</b> is {{recommended by the}} World Health Organization in {{the first day of}} life if possible. Two or three more doses are required at a later time for full effect. This vaccine works about 95% of the time. About 180 countries gave the vaccine as part of national programs as of 2006. It is also recommended that all blood be tested for hepatitis B before transfusion and condoms be used to prevent infection. During an initial infection, care is based on the symptoms that a person has. In those who develop chronic disease, antiviral medication such as tenofovir or interferon may be useful; however, these drugs are expensive. Liver transplantation is sometimes used for cirrhosis.|$|E
