5|$|Lead is {{the most}} {{prevalent}} heavy metal contaminant. Levels in the aquatic environments of industrialised societies have been estimated to be {{two to three times}} those of pre-industrial levels. As a component of tetraethyl lead, , it was used extensively in gasoline during the 1930s–1970s. Although the use of leaded gasoline was largely phased out in North America by 1996, soils next to roads built before this time retain high lead concentrations. Later research demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between the usage rate of leaded gasoline and violent crime in the United States; taking into account a 22-year time lag (for the average age of <b>violent</b> <b>criminals),</b> the violent crime curve virtually tracked the lead exposure curve.|$|E

40|$|The aim {{of current}} {{research}} {{was to investigate the}} role of prisonization, personality traits, and criminal social identity in predicting violent offending within a sample of recidivistic inmates from high security prison. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that a higher frequency of imprisonments, higher levels of extraversion, higher levels of cognitive centrality and lower levels of in-group affect all predict a greater probability of committing a <b>violent</b> <b>criminal</b> act. These results provide a substantial contribution to the criminal psychology literature by further elucidating the intricate role of extraversion in the understanding of criminal behaviour, empirically demonstrating the importance of criminal social identity in the prediction of <b>violent</b> <b>criminal</b> behaviour, and providing additional support for the possible role of prisonization effects in the emergence of <b>violent</b> <b>criminal</b> behaviour...|$|R
25|$|The often light {{treatment}} of <b>violent</b> <b>criminals</b> {{has been a}} continuous source of local controversy.

25|$|The {{origins of}} neurocriminology {{go back to}} {{one of the founders of}} modern criminology, 19th-century Italian {{psychiatrist}} and prison doctor Cesare Lombroso, whose beliefs that the crime originated from brain abnormalities were partly based on phrenological theories about the shape and size of the human head. Lombroso conducted a postmortem on a serial killer and rapist, who had an unusual indentation at the base of the skull. Lombroso discovered a hollow part in the killer’s brain where the cerebellum would be. Lombroso’s theory was that crime originated in part from abnormal brain physiology and that <b>violent</b> <b>criminals</b> where throwbacks to less evolved human types identifiable by ape-like physical characteristics. Criminals, he believed, could be identified by physical traits, such as a large jaw and sloping forehead. The contemporary neuroscientists further developed his idea that physiology and traits of the brain underlie all crime. The term “neurocriminology” was first introduced by James Hilborn (Cognitive Centre of Canada) and adopted by the leading researcher in the field, Dr. Adrian Raine, the chair of the Criminology Department at University of Pennsylvania. He was the first to conduct brain imaging study on <b>violent</b> <b>criminals.</b>|$|E
25|$|With the {{exception}} of traffic police in some local departments, all police officers carry small firearms and batons. A criticism that has emerged {{in recent years is}} that police officers generally do not carry any nonlethal weapons aside from batons such as tasers or pepper spray, limiting their options when dealing with <b>violent</b> <b>criminals.</b> Police in Taiwan have sometimes been known to fire warning shots or at the legs of fleeing suspects, though this practice has reportedly decreased in recent years.|$|E

The Commission instead implemented an 18-1 ratio. Michael Mukasey, in the Attorney General's capacity, vehemently opposed and testified against this change, warning that thousands of <b>violent</b> <b>criminals</b> may be released under the guidelines and endanger the community. Mukasey's move was criticized by advocates of elimination of crack-powder disparity.|$|E
25|$|Since its inception, the HRT {{has been}} {{involved}} in many of the FBI's most high-profile cases, executing numerous operations involving domestic militant groups, terrorists, and <b>violent</b> <b>criminals.</b> The first test of the team’s capabilities came in the summer of 1984, when the team deployed to Los Angeles as part of the security buildup prior to the 1984 Summer Olympic Games. Some cases have brought the HRT a lot of attention. The HRT came under increased public and Congressional scrutiny, along with federal law enforcement in general, due to what some saw as heavy-handed tactics used at Waco and Ruby Ridge.|$|E
25|$|Testosterone is {{significantly}} correlated with aggression and competitive behaviour and is directly facilitated by the latter. There are two theories {{on the role of}} testosterone in aggression and competition. The first one is the challenge hypothesis which states that testosterone would increase during puberty thus facilitating reproductive and competitive behaviour which would include aggression. Thus it is the challenge of competition among males of the species that facilitates aggression and violence. Studies conducted have found direct correlation between testosterone and dominance especially among the most <b>violent</b> <b>criminals</b> in prison who had the highest testosterone levels. The same research also found fathers (those outside competitive environments) had the lowest testosterone levels compared to other males.|$|E

Most of the Judges seem to view them like a well-loved dim cat, stupid, greedy but with an unseen value that's worth protecting with everything they have.

Some Judges openly view them as a nuisance to be removed, or like Judge Manners, as a sub-human race to be used and abused as the Judges see fit.|$|E
500|$|Streep {{appeared}} with Jeremy Irons, Glenn Close and Winona Ryder in The House of the Spirits (1993), set during the military dictatorship of Chile. The film {{was not well}} received by critics. Anthony Lane of The New Yorker wrote: [...] "This is really quite an achievement. It brings together Jeremy Irons, Meryl Streep, Winona Ryder, Antonio Banderas, and Vanessa Redgrave and insures that, without exception, they all give their worst performances ever". The following year, Streep featured in The River Wild, {{as the mother of}} children on a whitewater rafting trip who encounter two <b>violent</b> <b>criminals</b> (Kevin Bacon and John C.

40|$|Objective: Aggression is a {{particular}} problem commonly observed in personality disorders, especially in antisocial personality disorder (APD). It {{is well known that}} APD is closely related to substance use disorder (SUD). Individuals with higher aggression levels have also been suggested to have higher rates of SUD. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate aggression levels and substance use characteristics of APD subjects with and without <b>violent</b> <b>criminal</b> behavior. Method: A total of 124 male subjects with APD consecutively admitted to the Forensic Psychiatry Department of GATA Haydarpasa Training Hospital were involved in the study. All subjects were evaluated with an assessment battery using a semistructured interview for socio-demographic, APD, and substance use characteristics, APD section of SCID-II, SCID-I, and Aggression Questionnaire. The sample was divided into 2 groups in terms of having a history of <b>violent</b> <b>criminal</b> behavior and compared correspondingly. Results: Of the APD subjects, 90. 3 % reported a lifetime history of substance abuse and 75. 8 % had a current co-diagnosis of SUD. APD subjects with <b>violent</b> <b>criminal</b> behavior were more likely to be diagnosed with SUD as compared to those with out violent crimes. Moreover, APD subjects with SUD had higher aggression levels than those without SUD. Conclusion: Our results indicate that substance use may mediate the association between APD and aggression. Therefore, the treatment of substance abuse in APD subjects is an important target particularly for prevention of <b>violent</b> <b>criminal</b> behaviors...|$|R
