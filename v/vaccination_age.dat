Rural pharmacies are defined in all Arizona pharmacies in counties other than Pima or Maricopa, urban pharmacies are defined as all pharmacies within the Tucson city limits. Methods: Pharmacies were called for a phone interview asking what the minimum age someone needs to be to receive an influenza vaccination from their store is. Pharmacies were called during their operating hours during a 4 -week period {{at the end of}} January and early February. Results: 269 pharmacies were included in the study. Pharmacies consisted of 153 rural pharmacies and 116 urban pharmacies. The median minimum <b>vaccination</b> <b>age</b> for both rural and urban pharmacies was 8.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} from observational studies and randomized trials in low-income countries that vaccinations have non-specific effects. Administration of live vaccines reduces overall child morbidity and mortality, presumably due to protection against non-targeted infections. In Denmark, the live vaccine against smallpox was phased {{out in the}} 1970 s due to the eradication of smallpox. We used the phasing-out period to investigate the effect of smallpox vaccination on the risk of hospitalization for infections. METHODS: From the Copenhagen School Health Records Register, a cohort of 4048 individuals was sampled, of whom 3559 had information about receiving or not receiving smallpox vaccination. Infectious disease hospitalizations were identified in the Danish National Patient Register. RESULTS: During 87 228 person-years of follow-up, 1440 infectious disease hospitalizations occurred. Smallpox-vaccinated individuals had a reduced risk of all-cause infectious disease hospitalization compared with smallpox-unvaccinated individuals [hazard ratio (HR) 0. 84; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 72 - 0. 98]. The reduced risk of hospitalizations was seen for most subgroups of infectious diseases. The effect may have been most pronounced after early smallpox vaccination (<b>vaccination</b> <b>age</b> < 3. 5 years: HR 0. 81; 95 % CI 0. 69 - 0. 95; <b>vaccination</b> <b>age</b> ≥ 3. 5 years: HR 0. 91 95 % CI 0. 76 - 1. 10). Among the smallpox-vaccinated, the risk of infectious disease hospitalization increased 6 % with each 1 -year increase in <b>vaccination</b> <b>age</b> (HR 1. 06; 95 % CI 1. 02 - 1. 10). CONCLUSION: Smallpox vaccination {{is associated with a}} reduced risk of infectious disease hospitalization in a high-income setting...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we study a {{mathematical}} model to analyse the optimal <b>vaccination</b> <b>age</b> against Dengue in Brazil. Data from Brazil are used to estimate the basic reproduction numbers {{for each of the}} four Dengue serotypes and then the optimal <b>vaccination</b> <b>age</b> is calculated using a method due to Hethcote [1]. The vaccine has different efficacies against each serotype. Vaccination that is too early is inffective as individuals are protected by maternal antibodies but leaving vaccination until later may allow the disease to spread. First of all the optimal vaccination ages are calculated where there is just one serotype in circulation and then when there are multiple serotypes. The calculations are done using data both assuming constant vaccine efficacy and age-dependent vaccine efficacy against a given serotype. The multiple serotype calculations are repeated assuming that the rst infection is a risky infection and that it is not (to model Dengue Antibody Enhancement). The calculations are then repeated when any third or fourth Dengue infections are asymptomatic, so that two Dengue infections with different serotypes provide effective permanent immunity. The calculations are also repeated when the age-dependent risk function (fitted to Brazilian data) is hospitalisation from Dengue and when it is mortality due to Dengue. We find a wide variety of optimal vaccination ages depending on both the serotypes in circulation and the assumptions of the model...|$|E

40|$|Background: Each year a {{substantial}} number of Dutch elderly suffers from herpes zoster (HZ), caused by the reactivation of the varicella zoster virus (VZV). A potential complication of HZ is postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) which results in a prolonged loss of quality of life. A large randomized clinical trial, labelled the Shingles Prevention study (SPS), demonstrated that a live attenuated VZV vaccine can reduce the incidence of HZ and PHN. Objective: We aimed to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of vaccination of the elderly against HZ versus no such vaccination in The Netherlands. Methods: A cohort model was developed to compare the costs and effects in a vaccinated and a non-vaccinated age- and gender-stratified cohort of immune-competent elderly. <b>Vaccination</b> <b>age</b> was varied from 60 to 75 years. Data from published literature such as the SPS were used for transition probabilities. The study was performed from the societal as well as the health care payer's perspective and results were expressed in euros per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Results: In the base case, we estimated that vaccination of a cohort of 100, 000 60 -year-olds would prevent 4136 cases of HZ, 305 cases of PHN resulting in a QALY-gain of 209. From the societal perspective, a total of (sic) 1. 9 million was saved and the ICER was (sic) 35, 555 per QALY gained when a vaccine price of (sic) 87 was used. Vaccination of women resulted in a lower ICER than vaccination of men ((sic) 33, 258 vs. (sic) 40, 984 per QALY gained). The <b>vaccination</b> <b>age</b> with the most favourable ICER was 70 years ((sic) 29, 664 per QALY gained). Parameters with a major impact on the ICER were the vaccine price and HZ incidence rates. In addition, the model was sensitive to utility of mild pain, vaccine efficacy at the moment of uptake and the duration of protection induced by the vaccine. Conclusion: Vaccination against HZ might be cost-effective for ages ranging from 60 to 75 when a threshold of (sic) 50, 000 per QALY gained would be used, at (sic) 20, 000 per QALY this might not be the case. Additional information on the duration of vaccine-protection is needed to further optimize cost-effectiveness estimations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. ...|$|E

40|$|Background. Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) vaccines are ideally administered before HPV exposure; therefore, catch-up {{programs for}} girls past adolescence {{have not been}} readily funded. We evaluated the benefits and cost-effectiveness of a delayed, 1 -year female catch-up vaccination program in Norway. Methods. We calibrated a dynamic HPV transmission model to Norwegian data and projected {{the costs and benefits}} associated with 8 HPV-related conditions while varying the upper <b>vaccination</b> <b>age</b> limit to 20, 22, 24, or 26 years. We explored the impact of vaccine protection in women with prior vaccine-targeted HPV infections, vac-cine cost, coverage, and natural- and vaccine-induced immunity. Results. The incremental benefits and cost-effectiveness decreased as the upper age limit for catch-up increased. Assuming a vaccine cost of $ 150 /dose, vaccination up to age 20 years remained below Norway’s willingness-to-pay threshold (approximately $ 83 000 /quality-adjusted life year gained); extension to age 22 years was cost-effective at a lower cost per dose ($ 50 –$ 75).

The consensus statement underlines the need to establish, strengthen, and harmonize European policies that continue routine vaccinations to adulthood and that will include older populations. Improved vaccination rates will promote healthy aging by reducing the burden of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases in older populations, a population that is rapidly increasing in Europe...|$|R

40|$|AbstractInfluenza {{infection}} after allogeneic {{hematopoietic cell}} transplantation (allo-HCT) {{can result in}} severe complications. The effectiveness of the annual vaccine depends on age, immune competence, and the antigenic potential of the 3 strains included. We hypothesized that a second vaccine dose, the standard of care for vaccine-naïve children, might improve post hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) immune responses. Patients > 60 days post-HCT were randomized to receive either 1 (n = 33) or 2 (n = 32) influenza vaccine doses separated by 1 month. The primary endpoint was whether 2 vaccinations induced superior immunity; however, we found no difference. Secondary endpoints were to identify variables associated with responses. Both hemagglutination inhibition (HI; P <. 005) and ELISpot responses (P =. 03) were greater for patients vaccinated ≥ 1 year posttransplantation. Umbilical cord blood (UCB) recipients showed less IFN-γ responses (P <. 001). Interestingly, there was {{a positive correlation between}} the total number of CD 19 + cells before vaccination and seroconversion (P =. 01) and an inverse correlation for IFN-γ responses (P =. 05). Variables not associated with vaccine responses included prevaccine CD 4 + cell counts (total, naïve, or memory), steroid usage at <b>vaccination,</b> <b>age,</b> or conditioning intensity. Time from transplantation to vaccination and absolute CD 19 + cell counts were the strongest predictors of vaccine responses. Methods to improve influenza vaccine responses after allo-HCT are needed...|$|E
40|$|See the {{editorial}} commentary by Chesson and Markowitz on pages 172 – 4.) Background. Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines are ideally administered before HPV exposure; therefore, catch-up programs for girls past adolescence {{have not been}} readily funded. We evaluated the benefits and cost-effectiveness of a delayed, 1 -year female catch-up vaccination program in Norway. Methods. We calibrated a dynamic HPV transmission model to Norwegian data and projected {{the costs and benefits}} associated with 8 HPV-related conditions while varying the upper <b>vaccination</b> <b>age</b> limit to 20, 22, 24, or 26 years. We explored the impact of vaccine protection in women with prior vaccine-targeted HPV infections, vac-cine cost, coverage, and natural- and vaccine-induced immunity. Results. The incremental benefits and cost-effectiveness decreased as the upper age limit for catch-up increased. Assuming a vaccine cost of $ 150 /dose, vaccination up to age 20 years remained below Norway’s willingness-to-pay threshold (approximately $ 83 000 /quality-adjusted life year gained); extension to age 22 years was cost-effective at a lower cost per dose ($ 50 –$ 75). At high levels of vaccine protection in women with prior HPV exposure, vaccinating up to age 26 years was cost-effective. Results were stable with lower coverage. Conclusions. HPV vaccination catch-up programs, 5 years after routine implementation, may be warranted; how-ever, even at low vaccine cost per dose, the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating beyond age 22 years remains uncertain...|$|E
40|$|Background: Passively {{acquired}} maternal antibodies {{are necessary}} to protect infants against circulating measles virus until they reach the eligible age of vaccination. Likewise, high levels of population immunity must be achieved and maintained to reduce measles virus transmission. This study was undertaken to (1) assess the presence of maternally acquired measles-specific IgG antibodies among infants less than 9 months of age in Bangui, Central African Republic and (2) determine the immune status of vaccination-age children and the concordance with reported vaccination status. A secondary objective was to describe the presence of rubellaspecific IgG antibody in the study population. Methods: Vaccination history and blood samples were collected from 395 children using blotting paper. Samples were analyzed {{for the presence of}} measles-specific IgG antibodies using commercial ELISA kits. Results: Measles-specific IgG antibodies were detected in 51. 3 % of vaccinated children and 27. 6 % of nonvaccinated children. Maternally derived measles IgG antibodies were present in only 14. 8 % of infants aged 0 - 3 months and were absent in all infants aged 4 - 8 months.

40|$|The {{disease burden}} of {{seasonal}} influenza {{in young children}} is substantial. And yet only the USA, Canada, Finland and one state in Australia currently have a routine influenza vaccine policy in place for young children. Few countries seem keen to follow their lead. This paper reviews the evidence required to inform a policy of universal paediatric vaccination; key features include protective effect, economic impacts {{and the safety of}} influenza <b>vaccination</b> in this <b>age</b> group. We found that i. there is insufficient data on the protective effect of vaccinating infants aged 6 - 23 months, ii. there are very few economic evaluations and most of the current published economic evaluations involve modelling and were performed using data {{from a variety of sources}} which are not setting specific, and iii. safety data have not been specifically addressed by an in-depth separate systematic review. To better inform relevant policy making, we suggest that interdisciplinary research, (combining epidemiology and health economics at least), is required to fully examine the protective effect, economic impacts and safety of influenza <b>vaccination</b> in children <b>aged</b> 6 - 59 months. We also suggest that the safety data on influenza <b>vaccination</b> in this <b>age</b> group should be assessed specifically by an in-depth separate systematic review, using published and grey literature...|$|R
40|$|AIM—To {{evaluate}} {{the risk factors}} for breakthrough varicella in a follow up study of a cohort of 181 healthy children immunised when aged 9 - 24 months with a reformulated Oka strain varicella vaccine (SmithKline Beecham Biologicals/Oka).  DESIGN—The children were randomised in a double blind manner into one of four groups to receive one of two production lot vaccine batches, at two different titres (high titre, 103. 9 and 104. 0 plaque forming units (pfu); low titre (heat exposed), 102. 7 and 102. 8 pfu). The overall seroconversion rate after immunisation was 99 %.  RESULTS—One hundred and sixty eight patients were available for review after a mean (SD) follow up of 35 (9) months after vaccination. Multivariate analysis indicated that risk factors for breakthrough varicella were household contact with varicella (adjusted odds ratio (OR), 19. 89; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 18. 39 to 21. 39), <b>vaccination</b> <b>age</b> of ⩽ 14 months (adjusted OR, 2. 30; 95 % CI, 1. 69 to 2. 90), and receiving low titre (102. 7 pfu) vaccine (adjusted OR, 2. 13; 95 % CI, 1. 54 to 2. 73). All children who developed breakthrough varicella, had a modified varicella illness, except for three, {{all of whom had}} received low titre vaccine.  CONCLUSION—The identification of young immunisation age (⩽ 14 months) and low titre vaccine as risk factors for breakthrough varicella have important implications for the implementation of varicella vaccination programmes in healthy children. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{interference}} of low or high maternal antibodies titers on the attenuated {{infectious bursal disease}} (IBD) virus (IBDV) vaccine {{infection and}} its effects on the performance of broilers vaccinated at the 18 th day of incubation (in ovo), at one day of age (subcutaneously-SC), or at 15 days of age (drinking water-DW) were investigated. After a series of three live vaccinations, breeders were given or not an IBD oil emulsion vaccine (IBD-OEV) prior to sexual maturity. At day 18 of incubation (in ovo), a commercial vaccine containing HVT and an intermediate IBDV strain or the single HVT vaccine was given. An intermediate IBDV vaccine was given SC at one day of age, or at 15 days of age via DW. The progeny of unvaccinated breeders presented higher neutralizing IBDV-specific antibody (IBDVab) titers at 25 and 40 days of age than those of the progeny of IBD-OEV breeders (p< 0. 05) at any broilers <b>vaccination</b> <b>age</b> and route. The lower IBDV RNA detection by RT-PCR in the bursa of Fabricius (BF) and the lower IBDV antibody titers in the serum of the groups vaccinated at one and 15 days of age derived from IBD-OEV breeders may indicate antibody-mediated IBDV neutralization. The in-ovo and one-day vaccinations did not interfere with performance, both in low and high antibody-titered progenies. The in-ovo vaccination against IBD is considered convenient and safe for industrial chickens, irrespective their maternal antibody levels...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Resurgence or {{outbreak}} of measles recently occurred in both {{developed and developing}} countries despite long-standing widespread use of measles vaccine. Measles incidence in China has increased since 2002, particularly in infants and in persons ≥ 15 years of age. It is speculated that infants may acquire fewer measles IgG from their mothers, resulting in the reduced duration of protection during their early months of life. This study aimed to clarify the reason of increased susceptibility to measles in young infants in China. Measles IgG in 24 measles infants ≤ 9 months of age and their vaccinated mothers was quantitatively measured. The mean measles neutralizing titer in the vaccinated mothers and in 13 age-match women with the histories of clinical measles were compared. Results All the mothers were confirmed to be vaccinated successfully {{by the presence of}} measles IgG. Six vaccinated mothers were positive for measles IgM and had high concentrations of measles IgG and the neutralizing antibody, indicating underwent natural boosting. The mean measles neutralizing titer in 18 vaccinated mothers without natural boosting were significantly lower than that in 13 age-match women with the histories of clinical measles (1 : 37 vs 1 : 182, P Conclusions Our results suggest that infants born to mothers who acquired immunity to measles by vaccination may get a relatively small amount of measles antibody, resulting in loss of the immunity to measles before the <b>vaccination</b> <b>age.</b> Measures to improve the immunity in young infants not eligible for measles vaccination would be critical to interrupt the measles transmission in China. </p...|$|E
