5|$|The {{procedure}} requested, for {{an investigation}} into the hemodynamic changes in a patient with chronic <b>venous</b> <b>insufficiency,</b> which results in chronic venous disease, is quite different from an examination request made for suspected deep vein thrombosis. For a DVT investigation {{there is a need for}} guidance as to what to look for and to the intended treatment. An investigation performed with the intention of treating the patient by vein stripping or laser therapy for example is very different from the examination performed with the intention of executing a CHIVA. This French originated procedure is also spelt out as conservative hemodynamic treatment for chronic <b>venous</b> <b>insufficiency.</b> A CHIVA is an ultrasound guided, minimally invasive surgery strategic for the treatment of varicose veins, performed under local anaesthetic.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{arterial}} ultrasound study, {{when the}} sonographer studies <b>venous</b> <b>insufficiency,</b> the vein wall itself has no relevance and attention will {{be focused on}} the direction of blood flow. The objective of the examination is to see how the veins drain. In this way, venous ultrasonography has at times become a hemodynamic examination which is reserved for experienced sonographers who have completed hemodynamic studies and training and have acquired a deep knowledge of this subject.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPurpose : The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a {{physiologic}} method to measure outflow and inflow from the lower extremities and thus to quantify the degree of <b>venous</b> valvular <b>insufficiency</b> and <b>venous</b> obstructive disease. Methods : Calibrated photoplethysmography was used in combination with passive changes in hydrostatic pressure, by leg elevation followed by repositioning of the leg to the original sitting position. With the principle of venous occlusion plethysmography, timed volume changes were then used to calculate the outflow and inflow. The inflow and outflow units were the percentage of optical reflectance (%OR) per minute. The respective resistances were calculated by identifying the hydrostatic pressure distance from the third intercostal space to the probe site that is inducing these site changes. The resistance units were millimeters of Mercury × minutes per %OR. Results : Four groups of subjects were examined: normal individuals, patients with <b>venous</b> valvular <b>insufficiency,</b> deep <b>venous</b> thrombosis, and a combination of both. The most significant differences in outflow values were found between the control group (81. 77 % OR/min) and the deep venous thrombosis group (28. 47 % OR/min). In contrast, the most significant differences in inflow values were found between the control group (9. 67 % OR/min) and the <b>venous</b> valvular <b>insufficiency</b> group (108. 61 % OR/min). The resistances changed correspondingly. Conclusion : The application of calibrated photoplethysmography in conjunction with induced changes in leg hydrostatic pressure proved to be an effective physiologic method to noninvasively quantify venous hemodynamics in normal control subjects, patients with <b>venous</b> valvular <b>insufficiency,</b> <b>venous</b> obstructive disease, or both.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} and compare the elastomeric performance and comfort-related attributes of knitted fabrics used in garments for scar management and <b>venous</b> <b>insufficiencies.</b> Pressure garments used for scar management and <b>venous</b> <b>insufficiencies</b> need to provide sustainable pressure to the underlying limb from the time the garment is donned by the wearer to assist in recovery. In addition, fabrics used in the construction of pressure garments must be able to transport heat, vapour and moisture from the human body to the environment, leaving the wearer dry and comfortable. By adding a fabric assembly (two separate pieces of fabric layered on top of one another) to the pressure garment, pressure generating and comfort properties of the garment are expected to be enhanced. Six commercial knitted fabric samples were studied. Their selection was based on a representative sample of fabrics currently used for pressure garments, for scar management and venous diseases. Pressure garments have been comprehensively studied for their material composition, construction, pressure delivery and physiological benefits as single layers in the past, while the amount of research carried out on fabric assemblies is limited. All fabrics were tested in both single layers and as fabric assemblies to compare their elastic performance and comfort attributes. Fabrics&rsquo; physical parameters and structural properties were analysed for mass per unit area, thickness, stitch density, optical porosity and air permeability. The elastic characteristics of the six fabrics were tested at 25 %, 40 % and 60 % strain to determine their properties relevant to pressure generation. In addition, the fabrics were tested for tension decay. The fabrics were also assessed for thermal resistance (Rct) and water vapour resistance (Ret). Additionally, selected fabrics were tested for moisture management properties. It was found that fabric assemblies influenced and enhanced the overall elastic and comfort properties of the single layer fabrics. For elastic characteristics it was found that the most powerful fabrics are the powernet fabrics in both warp and weft direction as single layers. The powernet fabrics are able to generate the most pressure on the underlying limb of the patient wearing a garment made from these, in comparison with the lining fabrics. When a second fabric was introduced as a second layer in a fabric assembly, the power also increased in the warp and weft direction for powernets. For moisture management capabilities, single layer brushed-back powernet had better moisture management characteristics. However, as a fabric assembly the non-brushed powernet paired with the lining fabrics had better moisture management capabilities. Also, a fabric assembly, lining on the inside next to skin, facilitates the removal of sweat from the skin and the evaporation into the environment better compared with powernet when next to skin. For thermal and water vapour resistance non-brushed powernet had the lowest thermal and water-vapour resistance as the next to skin side of the fabric is not brushed and doesn&rsquo;t entrap air which acts as an insulator. Also, as a fabric assembly, the non-brushed powernet next to skin has the lowest thermal and water vapour resistance compared with the lining next to skin and powernet outside. For thermal and water vapour resistance in garment form different segments of the body had different thermal and water vapour resistance, which have to be taken into account at all stages of garment design and engineering...|$|R

500|$|Ultrasonography of leg veins is a risk-free, {{non-invasive}} procedure that uses ultrasound technology to give {{information about the}} anatomy, physiology and pathology of both the superficial and the deep venous systems, (SVS) and (DVS).

The normal physiological blood flow is anterograde, flowing from the periphery towards the heart, so that the evidence of an opposite, retrograde flow might indicate a pathology. The presence of a reflux is likewise of note; a reflux when not isolated in a vein (as simply retrograde), means that the blood flow is bi-directional where once the flow had been only anterograde.|$|E

500|$|In 2008, {{vascular}} surgeon Paolo Zamboni suggested that MS involves a vascular process {{he referred to}} as chronic cerebrospinal <b>venous</b> <b>insufficiency</b> (CCSVI), in which veins from the brain are constricted.

This theory received important attention {{in the media and}} among MS patients, specially in Canada. Concern has been raised with Zamboni's research as it was neither blinded nor controlled, and additionally its assumptions about the pathophisiology of the disease may not be backed by known data. Also further studies have either not found a relationship or found a much less strong one. This has raised serious objections to the hypothesis of CCSVI originating MS. The [...] "liberation procedure" [...] has been criticized for possibly resulting in serious complications and deaths while its benefits have not been proven.

500|$|Venous {{ultrasonography}} of {{the lower}} limbs is the most demanding of the medical complementary examinations. It {{is dependent on the}} examiner's expertise and training, and the interpretation of the results is subjective and reliant on an understanding of venous hemodynamics. [...] (A mapping does help the reproducibility and the inter-observer agreement of this examination). The examination is made even more difficult because there can be dilated veins without insufficiency, (by hyper-debit), and non dilated [...] but incompetent veins. Moreover, veins can be discretely incompetent in summer but then be normal in winter. Also, by definition of insufficiency, (insufficient blood flow) blood may be seen to flow freely in both directions, anterograde and retrograde between two valves. Another problem when dealing with the superficial venous system, is that venous anatomy is not constant; the position of veins can vary in different patients; also in the same patient the right lower limb is not identical to the left lower limb. As a further complication to the examination, where <b>venous</b> <b>insufficiency</b> is evidenced, the examination needs to be done with the probe in the transversal position but the mapping must be done showing the veins in their longitudinal aspect. This demands a rapid extrapolation by the physician from the transversal images seen to the longitudinal drawing needed. The dynamic maneuvers also need to be well executed. The need of a specialized training is mandatory which is a huge problem for many countries today.|$|E
