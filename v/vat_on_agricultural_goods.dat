40|$|Trade in {{agricultural}} products between Mexico and the EU only counts {{for a small}} percentage of total trade between them. With the entry into force of the EU-Mexico FTA in 2000, the tariffs on a number of agriculture commodities between the two parties was eliminated or reduced. This will lead to an opening in the trade of agricultural products between the two markets, something that could affect the welfare of the Mexican people positively, if new trade is created. The elimination and reduction of tariffs <b>on</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>goods</b> could also lead to positive consumption effects as prices on these goods could be lowered. Lower prices <b>on</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>goods</b> could help a large number of people, especially the poor people of Mexico. In this thesis, using theories on preferential trade, I aim to examine the effects on the Mexican people due to the elimination of traiffs <b>on</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>goods</b> between Mexico and the EU consequential to the EU-Mexico Free Trade Agreement. The investigation was carried out for the first two years after integration between the two parties, focusing <b>on</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>goods</b> in particular.

We show that it is possible to combine export tariffs with public investments such that deforestation decreases, while agricultural production levels and food prices remain constant...|$|R
5000|$|Prima facie, the EU {{seems to}} promote free trade. However, on closer examination, the {{evidence}} indicates that its high tariffs and NTBs <b>on</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>goods</b> (see Common <b>Agricultural</b> Policy) and manufactured goods protect the single market from external competition. [...] Examples include the EU's willingness to drop trade barriers on unprocessed coffee beans (which cannot be produced in the EU), but erect barriers on roasted coffee. [...] This protects the inefficient EU coffee roasting industry from competition in the developing world, which makes coffee more expensive for EU consumers and limits industrial development in Africa, Asia and South America (coffee producing economies). Another example is the automobile industry. Germany is renowned for its automobile production, but it protects this industry from competition with more efficient South Korean and Japanese producers with high tariffs and subsidies, which is why EU car manufacturers have consistently lobbied against free trade with Japan.|$|R
40|$|Agricultural trade {{liberalization}} negotiations are currently at a crossroads. Progress {{was made to}} eliminate export subsidies, but small open economiesâ€™ demand for lower domestic support and tariffs <b>on</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>goods</b> do not find much support among large policy active countries. Many non-tariff barriers still also impede agricultural trade. This paper presents the theoretical foundations of a gravity model to explain trade flows of both primary agricultural commodities and processed foods. At the consumer level, commodities are differentiated according to {{their country of origin}} while primary <b>agricultural</b> <b>goods</b> are homogenous from the buyersâ€™ perspective. However, primary goods can not be substituted costlessly across destinations from the sellersâ€™ perspective due to differences in technical and sanitary regulations between countries. These assumptions yield well-behaved import demand functions at the consumer level and export supply functions at the producer level. Imperfect substitutability at the consumption and production levels is summarized in two important structural parameters. The role of these parameters in explaining bilateral trade patterns is illustrated for a three-country world market using a numerical example. The simulation investigates whether it is more important for a small open economy that large policy active countries reduce agricultural tariffs or domestic support. It also addresses the implications of tariff escalation on trade flows. ...|$|R

40|$|Assessing {{climate change}} impact on {{agriculture}} {{is a complex}} task involving {{a wide range of}} economical and physical processes, leading to significant uncertainties. At European scale, climate change impacts <b>on</b> <b>agricultural</b> supply have been appraised to be of relatively less important driver by the end of century compared to other global drivers. However these diagnoses are incomplete due to a limited representation of both spatial heterogeneity in important determinants of agricultural supply (soil, management practices and producer typology) and fine scale processes such as farm scale autonomous adaptation. We propose a complementary approach based on a modeling framework including a spatially explicit representation of productivity and producer behavior with regard to heterogeneity in soil, climate, and producer socio-economic context to appraise climate change impacts including autonomous farm-scale adaptations of EU 15 agricultural supply to climate change. Our results suggest that without accounting for autonomous adaptation European agricultural supply may have interesting resilience properties at an aggregated scale despite significant heterogeneity at smaller resolution. Accounting for autonomous adaptations result in significant yield gains, and may lead to (i) {{a significant increase in the}} relative profitability of crops compared to other land-covers, thus possibly increasing its agricultural land-use share over other land covers, and (ii) an increase in total European production which may have impacts <b>on</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>goods</b> markets, thus highlighting the need for integrating fine scale processes such as autonomous adaptation.

40|$|Etudes & documentsWhat is {{the best}} pro-poor {{value-added}} tax (VAT) design to increase public revenue in developing countries: A perfect uniform tax, a multiple-rate system, or a tighter tax base with a high rate? This debate remains relevant, even though many studies have analyzed {{the economic impact of}} VAT reforms. Most of these studies have considered VAT as a consumption tax when analyzing the social impact of VAT reforms. However, if VAT exemptions are implemented or if the tax administration is inefficient in issuing refunds for VAT credits, then VAT increases producerâ€™s tax burden and viewing the VAT only as a consumption tax becomes inaccurate. In order to take into account these complexities we built the first micro-macro computable general equilibrium model of Nigerâ€™s economy in order to shed some light on the best pro-poor VAT design. The main result of the model reveals that broadening the tax base while maintaining a high VAT rate will lead to an important increase in poverty. Lowering the rate or maintaining exemptions <b>on</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>goods</b> have the least impact on poverty. However, the social impact of exemptions depends on the net effect of the additional tax burden supported by producers and the increase in domestic demand...|$|R

In order to capture intertemporal effects brought about by trade liberalisation on the Jordanian economy, a multisectoral dynamic CGE model is specified and calibrated.
