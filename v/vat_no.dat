40|$|Value added tax (VAT) {{is often}} {{described}} as a regressive tax because it taxes consumption, and the propensity to consume tends to decrease as income rises. Countries that maintain progressive tax systems take several measures to remove the regressivity of VAT. These measures include (i) exempting food and social necessities and (ii) taxing luxuries at high rates and necessities at low rates. VAT of the subtraction type has two main variants, namely the tax credit method and the subtraction method. These two types of VAT have theoretically the same effects on a firm’s liability for VAT and a firm’s decision on price in cases where there is only one rate and there are no exemptions. However, in cases where multiple rates and exemptions 3 are implemented, these two types of <b>VAT</b> <b>no</b> longer have the same effects on a firm’s liability for VAT and a firm’s decision on price. In the European Union, multiple rates are used to mitigate the regressivity of VAT in several countries. 4 In a recent EU Directive, the EU proposed a dual-rate structure, namely a standard rate of at least 15 per cent and a minimum rate of at least 5 per cent. Also proposed was the abolition of internal border controls by switching from the destination principle to the origin principle. This means that each Member State can set its own VAT rates to mitigate regressivity and to secure its revenue. 5...|$|E

40|$|Background: It was {{suggested}} that body fat distribution differs across ethnic groups, {{and this may}} be important when considering risk of disease. Previous studies have not adequately investigated differences in discrete regions of abdominal adiposity across ethnic groups. Objective: We compared the relation between abdominal adipose tissue and total body fat between persons living in Canada of Ab-original, Chinese, and South Asian origin with persons of European origin. Design: Healthy Aboriginal, Chinese, European, and South Asian participants (n 822) aged between 30 and 65 y were matched by sex, ethnicity, and body mass index (BMI; in kg/m 2) range. Total abdominal adipose tissue (TAT), subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue (SAT), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), total body fat mass, lifestyle, and demographics were assessed. Relations between BMI and total body fat, TAT, SAT, and VAT and between total body fat and TAT, SAT, and VAT were investigated. Results: BMI significantly underestimated VAT in all non-European groups. Throughout a range of total body fat mass, VAT was not significantly different between the Aboriginals and the Eu-ropeans. With total body fat 9. 1 kg, Chinese participants had increasingly greater amounts of VAT than did the Europeans (P for interaction 0. 008). South Asians had less VAT with total body fat 37. 4 kg but more VAT below that amount than did Europeans (P for interaction 0. 001). Conclusion: Compared with Europeans, the Chinese and South Asian cohorts had a relatively greater amount of abdominal adipose tissue, and this difference was more pronounced with <b>VAT.</b> <b>No</b> significant differences were observed between the Aboriginals an...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBackground: Recent {{studies have}} shown that a high breast volume predicts visceral adipose tissue and risk for type 2 {{diabetes}} independently of BMI and waist circumference. Objective: To investigate the relationships between breast adipose tissue (BrAT), body fat distribution and cardiometabolic risk factors. Methods: 97 healthy females (age 19 - 46 years, BMI 16. 8 - 46. 8 kg/m 2) were examined cross-sectionally. A subgroup of 57 overweight and obese women (BMI 34. 7 ± 4. 5 kg/m 2) was investigated before and after diet-induced weight-loss (- 8. 3 ± 4 kg). Fat mass (FM) was measured by air-displacement-plethysmography (ADP). Volumes of BrAT, visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous AT (SAT) of the trunk and extremeties were assessed by whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Cardiometabolic risk was assessed by lipid profile, fasting glucose, insulin, adiponectin and leptin levels. Results: A high proportion of BrAT was associated with higher truncal and lower leg SAT. Weight-loss induced decline in BrAT as a percentage of total AT was correlated with decreases in SATtrunk and inversely with SATlegs and <b>VAT.</b> <b>No</b> relationships were found between BrAT and cardiometabolic risk factors. By contrast, SATtrunk and VAT showed positive and SATlegs inverse associations with cardiometabolic risk factors in cross-sectional as well as longitudinal analysis. The association between BrAT and VAT was lost after adjusting for %FM and truncal SAT. Conclusions: Our results indicate that high BrAT reflects a phenotype with increased SATtrunk and low SATlegs. BrAT showed no independent relationships with VAT and cardiometabolic risk factors...|$|E
40|$|Visceral {{adipose tissue}} (VAT) is an {{important}} risk factor for obesity-related metabolic disorders. Therefore, a reduction in VAT has become a key goal in obesity management. However, VAT is correlated with intrahepatic triglyceride (IHTG) content, so {{it is possible that}} IHTG, not VAT, is a better marker of metabolic disease. We determined the independent association of IHTG and VAT to metabolic function, by evaluating groups of obese subjects, who differed in IHTG content (high or normal) but matched on VAT volume or differed in VAT volume (high or low) but matched on IHTG content. Stable isotope tracer techniques and the euglycemic–hyperinsulinemic clamp procedure were used to assess insulin sensitivity and very-low-density lipoprotein–triglyceride (VLDL-TG) secretion rate. Tissue biopsies were obtained to evaluate cellular factors involved in ectopic triglyceride accumulation. Hepatic, adipose tissue and muscle insulin sensitivity were 41, 13, and 36 % lower (P < 0. 01), whereas VLDL-triglyceride secretion rate was almost double (P < 0. 001), in subjects with higher than normal IHTG content, matched on <b>VAT.</b> <b>No</b> differences in insulin sensitivity or VLDL-TG secretion were observed between subjects with different VAT volumes, matched on IHTG content. Adipose tissue CD 36 expression was lower (P < 0. 05), whereas skeletal muscle CD 36 expression was higher (P < 0. 05), in subjects with higher than normal IHTG. These data demonstrate that IHTG, not VAT, is a better marker of the metabolic derangements associated with obesity. Furthermore, alterations in tissue fatty acid transport could be involved in the pathogenesis of ectopic triglyceride accumulation by redirecting plasma fatty acid uptake from adipose tissue toward other tissues...|$|E
