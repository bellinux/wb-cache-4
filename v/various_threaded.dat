5000|$|A {{downside}} of SIMT execution {{is the fact}} that thread-specific control-flow is performed using [...] "masking", leading to poor utilization where a processor's threads follow different control-flow paths. For instance, to handle an IF-ELSE block where <b>various</b> <b>threads</b> of a processor execute different paths, all threads must actually process both paths (as all threads of a processor always execute in lock-step), but masking is used to disable and enable the <b>various</b> <b>threads</b> as appropriate. Masking is avoided when control flow is coherent for the threads of a processor, i.e. they all follow the same path of execution. The masking strategy is what distinguishes SIMT from ordinary SIMD, and has the benefit of inexpensive synchronization between the threads of a processor.|$|R

To have faster execution of such operations is very essential to reduce overall computation time. Today’s Graphics processing units (GPUs) have high computation power and low price.

We studied different parallel algorithms for Breadth first search, all pairs shortest path that are carried out on GPU using CUDA and make their comparative study with respect to execution time, data structure used, input data etc. In the paper, we presented overview of various parallel methods carried out on GPU using its multithreaded architecture for BFS, APSP by various authors...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{the context}} of {{processing}} data lists in parallel in a multicore, <b>various</b> <b>threads</b> share a workload, each using a list to get and insert the data items to be processed; and when a list becomes empty, the owner thread steals data items from another list — thus balancing the workload according to the processing capacity of each thread transparently to the programmer. The first algorithm we designed to synchronise work stealing in such context addressed various important issues such as cache locality and memory consumption. This paper presents a new low-synchronisation algorithm for work stealing in the above context which improves performance and also tends to make performance more predictible. We present experimental results comparing both algorithms using various applications with different granularities and access patterns...|$|R

The proposed solution (RePP-C) selects a given hardware configuration for each active core to ensure that the performance-power demands are satisfied while using the scheduling schema (FACTS) for mapping threads-to-cores.
