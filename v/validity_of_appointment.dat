40|$|The issue <b>of</b> the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> {{judicial}} mediators {{has once}} again been raised – this time by the Victorian Attorney-General. But is the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> judicial mediators necessary {{at a time when}} managerial judging through active case management and lawyer led settlements are leading to the efficient disposition of cases in the civil courts? Part I of this article appeared in the previous edition of this Journal and dealt with defining judicial mediation, after which it discussed why the judicial promotion of settlement is vital to the functioning of the judicial system. It then detailed {{the first phase of the}} argument about the constitutional <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> judicial mediators and the legal and philosophical arguments that stem from that discussion. In Part II, the discussion on the Constitutional <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> judicial mediators is concluded together with a discussion of the positives and negatives <b>of</b> the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> judicial mediators. Finally, the conclusion will raise the issue of whether we need judicial mediators? 11 page(s...|$|R

Stanley de Smith argues that the real reason for the dissolution was because Mohammad objected to the constitution which the Assembly was about to adopt. [...] The President of the Constituent Assembly, Maulvi Tamizuddin, appealed to the Chief Court of Sind at Karachi to restrain the new Council of Ministers from implementing the dissolution and to determine the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> the new Council under Section 223-A of the constitution.|$|R

His insistence on appointing Matthias Bodkin, an eminent journalist and a staunch political ally, to a County Court judgeship, was a rash move: although Bodkin was a qualified barrister, legitimate doubts had been raised by Walker's political opponents {{as to whether he}} had the necessary years of practice to qualify for appointment to the Bench. The result was an action for quo warranto challenging the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> Bodkin's <b>appointment,</b> which gravely embarrassed the Government, although no harm ultimately came of it: the case was resolved amicably and Bodkin, by general agreement, proved to be an excellent judge.|$|R

40|$|This Note {{surveys the}} current {{landscape}} <b>of</b> the Recess <b>Appointments</b> Clause. With the recent recess <b>appointments</b> <b>of</b> Richard Cordray {{to direct the}} Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and three other individuals to join the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), came an influx of old—and new—controversy over the President’s recess appointment authority. This Note explores interpretational issues that have surrounded the Clause since its inception, as well as novel issues that have arisen with the Congress’s use of pro forma sessions {{in an attempt to}} block recess appointments and derail the executive’s agenda. The conflict over control <b>of</b> the <b>appointments</b> process is at its peak, as exemplified by the current litigation seeking to invalidate President Obama’s most recent recess appointments. This Note examines the varied interpretations of the Clause, the current litigation and potential dispositions, the increasing congressional trend <b>of</b> using the <b>appointments</b> process as an obstructionist device, and the possible state of both the CFPB and the Recess Appointments Clause after litigation. Ultimately, this piece proposes a modified functionalist standard by which the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> recess <b>appointments</b> should be judged. That is, if the Senate is in a truly functional recess for a period of longer than three days, then the President should {{be able to make a}} valid recess appointment. Additionally, this three-day rule can be broken in the event of an emergency that renders the Senate unable to advise and consent to a nominee at a time when a recess appointment is necessary for the uninterrupted functioning of the government...|$|R

The Minister for Law, Arun Jaitley asked for her resignation. Later she left her office as Governor of the state under controversial circumstances of her accepting of Jayalalithaa's of assembly majority after the elections and over the arrest of Karunanidhi, who pitched for her appointment four years ago. Jayalalitha defended the state Governor's decision to invite her to form the government. She said [...] "She is a former supreme court judge. She herself is a legal expert. Nobody need teach her about law or the constitution.

6000|$|The {{attack in}} {{parliament}} was, as such attacks almost always are, much overdone. Mr. Gladstone, it appeared, was {{far worse than}} Oliver Cromwell and the parliament of the great rebellion; for though those bad men forced three professors upon Oxford between 1648 and 1660, still they took care that the intruders should all be men trained at Oxford and graduates of Oxford. Who could {{be sure that the}} prime minister would not next appoint an ultramontane divine from Bologna, or a Greek from Corfu? Such extravagances did as little harm as the false stories about Mr. Harvey being jobbed into the living because he had been at Eton with Mr. Gladstone and was his political supporter. As it happened he was a conservative, and Mr. Gladstone knew nothing of him except that a number of most competent persons had praised his learning. In spite of all this, however, and <b>of</b> the technical <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>appointment,</b> we may wish that the rector’s doubts had not been overruled. A worthy member regaled the House by a story of a gentleman staying in the mansion of a friend; one morning he heard great noise and confusion in the yard; looking out he saw a kitchen-maid being put on a horse, and so carried round and round the yard. When he went downstairs he asked what was the matter, and the groom said, “Oh, sir, ’tis only that we’re going to take the animal to the fair to sell, and we want to say he has carried a lady.” The apologue was not delicate, but it conveyed a common impression. “Gladstone spoke,” says Mr. Bruce (March 9, 1872), “with great vigour and eloquence on the Ewelme case; but I think that, with the best possible intentions, he had placed himself in a wrong position.” ...|$|R
