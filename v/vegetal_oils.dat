5000|$|Other {{vegetable}} oils - such as soy bean oil, peanut oil, and canola oil - contain carbon-carbon double bonds, but no hydroxyl groups. There are several processes used to introduce hydroxyl groups onto the carbon chain of the fatty acids, {{and most of}} these involve oxidation of the C-C double bond. Treatment of the <b>vegetal</b> <b>oils</b> with ozone cleaves the double bond, and esters or alcohols can be made, depending on the conditions used to process the ozonolysis product. The example below shows the reaction of triolein with ozone and ethylene glycol.Air oxidation, (autoxidation), the chemistry involved in the [...] "drying" [...] of drying oils, gives increased molecular weight and introduces hydroxyl groups. The radical reactions involved in autoxidation can produce a complex mixture of crosslinked and oxidized triglycerides. Treatment of {{vegetable oils}} with peroxy acids gives epoxides which can be reacted with nucleophiles to give hydroxyl groups. This can be done as a one-step process. Note that in the example shown below only one of the three fatty acid chains is drawn fully, {{the other part of the}} molecule is represented by [...] "R1" [...] and the nucleophile is unspecified. Earlier examples also include acid catalyzed ring opening of epoxidized soybean oil to make oleochemical polyols for polyurethane foams [...] and acid catalyzed ring opening of soy fatty acid methyl esters with multifunctional polyols to form new polyols for casting resins.|$|E

40|$|Introduction DMG, {{which is}} a {{modified}} aminoacid that is in small amounts ubiquitously present in organic material, is reputed {{to be involved in}} a variety of biological roles. The current large-scale study intended to evaluate effects of dietary DMG in broiler rations, with either <b>vegetal</b> <b>oil</b> or animal fat as main fat source, on production and slaughter performance. Materials 1500 one-day-old broilers (Cobb- 500) were housed in 50 pens of 30 birds each until day 42. The study comprised a complete block design in which 5 doses of DMG (0, 100, 200, 500 and 1000 ppm) were added to rations with either animal fat (chicken fat) or <b>vegetal</b> <b>oil</b> (soy oil) as main fat source. Following performance traits were calculated: feed conversion ratio (FCR), weight gain, mortality and production value (PV). Next, {{at the end of the}} trial, one bird per pen was euthanized and systematically dissected. Results In general, weight gains were quite high (2760 g after 42 days) and FCR was very good (1. 634), further the average mortality rate was relatively low (4. 5 %). Yet, numerically, weight gain and FCR generally improved with increasing DMG level when fed the <b>vegetal</b> <b>oil</b> diet and showed optimal values at 500 ppm when fed the animal fat diet. Moreover, a significant positive linear effect was found between DMG level and PV as final economical response value, when fed the <b>vegetal</b> <b>oil</b> diet (P< 0. 05). Next, significant quadratric and linear effects on slaughter characteristics were all in favour of the tested feed supplement. Finally, DMG showed a significant, negative linear effect on TBARS when fed the <b>vegetal</b> <b>oil</b> diet. Discussion This trial demonstrates several, beneficial effects of DMG in spite of the limited margin for improvement of technical performance due to the overall highly efficient growth in this trial. Further, these data indicate that the nature and magnitude of effects as well as optimal dose of DMG depend on the main fat source of the diet...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA {{selective}} supercritical CO(2) {{extraction process}} has been developed in order to extract selectively the <b>vegetal</b> <b>oil</b> and the essential oil from coriander seeds in a consecutive way by tuning experimental conditions. A 4 -step {{process has been}} set up: (i) seeds preparation by grinding and sieving, (ii) extraction by supercritical CO(2) and (iii; iv) selective separation in two separators with different pressure levels. The {{first part of this}} study consisted in studying the effects of the operating conditions (T, P, CO(2) density, flow rate and particle size distribution of ground seeds) on the yield of extraction. The results showed that the global performance of the process depends mainly on the pressure level of extraction, on the CO(2) flow rate and {{on the size of the}} ground seeds. An optimization of the parameters led to an extraction ratio of 90 %. The second part of this study dealt with the effects of the operating conditions on the quality of extracts, and more precisely on their composition in <b>vegetal</b> <b>oil</b> and essential oil. It was observed that the supercritical extraction had no major effect on the fatty acid composition of the <b>vegetal</b> <b>oil</b> compared to classical extraction techniques, while essential oil is enriched in components such as linalool and that a previous drying of the seeds is deleterious. Finally, we propose a procedure in order to extract separately each oil by adjusting CO(2) density and separation conditions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
