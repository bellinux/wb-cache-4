25|$|Multiple light {{scattering}} coupled with <b>vertical</b> <b>scanning</b> {{is the most}} widely used technique to monitor the dispersion state of a product, hence identifying and quantifying destabilisation phenomena. It works on concentrated dispersions without dilution. When light is sent through the sample, it is backscattered by the particles / droplets. The backscattering intensity is directly proportional to the size and volume fraction of the dispersed phase. Therefore, local changes in concentration (e.g.Creaming and Sedimentation) and global changes in size (e.g. flocculation, coalescence) are detected and monitored.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} common {{industrial}} applications of optical interferometry is as a versatile measurement tool for the high precision examination of surface topography. Popular interferometric measurement techniques include Phase Shifting Interferometry (PSI), and <b>Vertical</b> <b>Scanning</b> Interferometry(VSI), also known as scanning white light interferometry (SWLI) or by the ISO term Coherence Scanning Interferometry (CSI), CSI exploits coherence to extend the range of capabilities for interference microscopy. These techniques are widely used in micro-electronic and micro-optic fabrication. PSI uses monochromatic light and provides very precise measurements; however it is only usable for surfaces that are very smooth. CSI often uses white light and high numerical apertures, and rather than looking at the phase of the fringes, as does PSI, looks for best position of maximum fringe contrast or some other feature of the overall fringe pattern. [...] In its simplest form, CSI provides less precise measurements than PSI but can be used on rough surfaces. Some configurations of CSI, variously known as Enhanced VSI (EVSI), high-resolution SWLI or Frequency Domain Analysis (FDA), use coherence effects in combination with interference phase to enhance precision.|$|E

50|$|With EHB palette switching, it is {{possible}} to produce yet more colors in a single image; this can be achieved by splitting the image into multiple horizontal blocks (slices), between which the color registers are modified during the <b>vertical</b> <b>scan.</b> This is not an official graphics mode, but a software technique made possible by the hardware.

40|$|Abstract. Atmospheric {{profiles}} {{retrieved from}} GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) radio occultation (RO) measurements are increasingly used to validate other mea-surement data. For this purpose {{it is important}} to be aware of the characteristics of RO measurements. RO data are fre-quently compared with vertical reference profiles, but the RO method does not provide <b>vertical</b> <b>scans</b> through the at-mosphere. The average elevation angle of the tangent point trajectory (which would be 90 ◦ for a <b>vertical</b> <b>scan)</b> is about 40 ◦ at altitudes above 70 km, decreasing to about 25 ◦ at 20 km and to less than 5 ◦ below 3 km. In an atmosphere with high horizontal variability we can thus expect noticeable representativeness errors if the retrieved profiles are com-pared with vertical reference profiles.

It works on any concentrated dispersions without dilution, including foams. When light is sent through the sample, it is backscattered by the bubbles.

Therefore, local changes in concentration (drainage, syneresis) and global changes in size (ripening, coalescence) are detected and monitored.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{important}} to remember that when the [...] "refresh rate" [...] setting in a computer operating system is increased, both the horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>scan</b> rates increase together.

50|$|In {{a flying}} spot scanner (FSS) or {{cathode-ray}} tube (CRT) telecine, a pixel-sized light beam is projected through exposed and developed motion picture film (either negative or positive) and collected by a special type of photo-electric cell known as a photomultiplier which converts the light into an electrical signal. The beam of light “scans” across the film image {{from left to right}} to record the horizontal frame information. <b>Vertical</b> <b>scanning</b> of the frame is then accomplished by moving the film past the CRT beam. In a colour telecine the light from the CRT passes through the film and is separated by dichroic mirrors and filters into red, green and blue bands. Photomultiplier tubes or avalanche photodiodes convert the light into separate red, green and blue electrical signals for further electronic processing. This can be accomplished in “real time”, 24 frames per second (or in some cases faster). Rank Precision-Cintel introduced the “Mark” series of FSS telecines. During this time advances were also made in CRTs, with increased light output producing a better signal-to-noise ratio and so allowing negative film to be used.|$|E

50|$|During the 1930s and 1940s, Field-sequential color {{systems were}} {{developed}} which used synchronized motor-driven color-filter disks at the camera's image tube {{and at the}} television receiver. Each disk consisted of red, blue, and green transparent color filters. In the camera, the disk was in the optical path, and in the receiver, it {{was in front of}} the CRT. Disk rotation was synchronized with <b>vertical</b> <b>scanning</b> so that each vertical scan in sequence was for a different primary color. This method allowed regular black-and-white image tubes and CRTs to generate and display color images. A field-sequential system developed by Peter Goldmark for CBS was demonstrated to the press on September 4, 1940, and was first shown to the general public on January 12, 1950. Guillermo González Camarena independently developed a field-sequential color disk system in Mexico in the early 1940s, for which he requested a patent in Mexico on August 19 of 1940 and in the USA in 1941. Gonzalez Camarena produced his color television system in his laboratory Gon-Cam for the Mexican market and exported it to the Columbia College of Chicago, who regarded it as the best system in the world.|$|E
