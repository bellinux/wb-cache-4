5|$|Hillsboro's Civic Center is {{a modern}} glass {{building}} with a stone base and brick highlights. There are two main buildings, the Civic Center housing government offices and the Plaza Building housing retail space. The plazas surrounding the structures contain an inlaid quartzite river, basalt planters, and <b>Victorian</b> <b>style</b> benches. Additionally, it was designed with large windows facing the north in order to reflect the giant sequoia trees located {{across the street at}} the Washington County Courthouse, with the trees dating back to the 1880s.|$|E

5|$|The western wing is {{dominated}} by a square tower of stone-dressed brick which rises two storeys above the roof and is capped by an ogee spirelet surrounded by four corner chimneys. Designed by Barry in the High <b>Victorian</b> <b>style,</b> it was added after the fire. A slender bell tower also rises from the west wing. At the rear is a loggia with a vaulted ceiling supported by Tuscan columns. The western end of this wing is a single-storey extension by Thomas Bower dating from 1896.|$|E
5|$|A small chapel lies to {{the north}} of the central hall. Originally rather austere, it was lavishly {{decorated}} by Barry in the High <b>Victorian</b> <b>style.</b> There is much elaborate wood carving, with the altar rail featuring angels and the benches poppyheads. The marble apse has alabaster carved heads of the prophets and evangelists by J. Birnie Philip, and the wall panelling features bronze medallions depicting biblical characters by the same artist. The ornate choir gallery, reached from the central hall's mezzanine gallery, contains the family pew. The stained glass and wall murals are by Clayton and Bell, and the painting and stencilling are by J. G. Crace.|$|E
5|$|Douglas's {{influences}} {{were not}} from England alone. Although he never travelled abroad, he incorporated Gothic styles from continental countries, especially Germany and France. This combination of Gothic styles contributed {{to what has}} come to be known as the High <b>Victorian</b> <b>style.</b> Its features include a sense of massiveness, steep roofs which are frequently hipped, round turrets with conical roofs, pinnacles, heavy corbel tables, and the use of polychromism. Many of Douglas's works, especially his earlier ones, are High Victorian in style, or incorporate High Victorian features. One characteristic feature of Douglas's work is the inclusion of dormer windows rising through the eaves and surmounted by hipped roofs.|$|E

New Division, constructed between 1904 and 1907, continues the façade alignment of the main block. Service buildings were converted into the separate Women's Prison. Fremantle Prison is surrounded by limestone perimeter walls, while a two storey limestone gatehouse, with a central clock, presents an imposing entrance. North {{and south of the}} gatehouse, on The Terrace, are several cottages and houses – three of which are built in <b>Victorian</b> <b>style</b> in contrast to the Georgian style of the others.|$|E
5|$|Nineteenth-century {{interiors}} could {{often be}} lavish and eclectic. The origins of this style were in Scott's Abbotsford, where the author began {{the incorporation of}} actual old architectural fragments and pieces of furniture on a lavish scale (the effective beginning of 'antique' collecting in Scotland). He also initiated the treatment of new surfaces so as to resemble old ones, with new wood darkened to resemble old oak. The Adam solution of a castellated exterior with a neo-classical interior was abandoned and in Baronial revival houses this change was extended to create a synthesised <b>Victorian</b> <b>style</b> that combined elements of the Renaissance, such as plastered or rubble walls, unpainted stone fireplaces and pitch pine timberwork, with seventeenth-century style plaster ceilings. To this were added symbols of landed power and national affiliation, including displays of tartan, weaponry and stuffed animals' heads. Integrated into these traditional materials and styles were modern fittings such as sprung upholstery, gaslighting and water-closets.|$|E
50|$|Philip William May (22 April 1864 - 5 August 1903) was an English caricaturist who, {{with his}} {{vigorous}} economy of line, {{played an important}} role in moving away from <b>Victorian</b> <b>styles</b> of illustration towards the creation of the modern humorous cartoon.|$|R

5|$|North of the gatehouse, {{located at}} 2, 4, and 6 The Terrace, are cottages built in <b>Victorian</b> <b>style,</b> in {{contrast}} to the Georgian style of the other houses. Number 10 is a double-storey house, initially built in 1853 for the chaplain, but taken over by the superintendent in 1878 and later used by the prison administration. An adjoining single-storey at number 12, finished in 1854, was the home of the gatekeeper, located {{on the north side of}} the gatehouse. Number 16 The Terrace, south of the gatehouse, is a double-storey house that accommodated first the superintendent, and later the resident magistrate. It remained in use as housing for prison officers until the 1970s. Number 18, the southernmost house on The Terrace, and number 8, the northernmost of the initial buildings, both featured two sitting rooms, three bedrooms, and two dressing rooms, as well as a kitchen, water closet and shed, but with mirrored layouts. Number 18 was expanded with additions built in the 1890s.|$|E
5|$|In about 1879–81 Douglas built {{a terrace}} of houses {{on his own}} land in Chester, 6–11 Grosvenor Park Road, the road leading to the main {{entrance}} to Grosvenor Park, in High <b>Victorian</b> <b>style.</b> About 1883 he designed Barrowmore Hall (or Barrow Court) at Great Barrow (since demolished) {{which was one of}} his largest houses. Also around this time he designed buildings on the Eaton Hall estate, including Eccleston Hill (1881–82), a large house for the Duke's secretary, the Stud Lodge, a smaller building of the same dates, Eccleston Hill Lodge (1881), a three-storey gatehouse at the main entrance to the park, with a high hipped roof and turrets, and The Paddocks (1882–83), another large house, this time for the Duke's land agent. In Chester city centre his designs included the Grosvenor Club and North and South Wales Bank (1881–83) in Eastgate Street, built in stone and brick, with a turret and a stepped gable, and 142 Foregate Street for the Cheshire County Constabulary (1884), with a shaped gable in Flemish style.|$|E
5|$|After the Reformation, and the {{departure}} of the Scottish court in 1603, artists and artisans looked to secular patronage and estate houses became repositories of art and of elaborate furnishings. Estate houses were adorned with paintings, wood carvings and plasterwork. The Grand Tour encouraged the collection of classical art and the adoption of classical styles for new works that were incorporated into the Adam Style. The Baronial revival resulted a synthesised <b>Victorian</b> <b>style</b> that combined elements of the Renaissance, symbols of landed power and national affiliation with modern fittings. From the late sixteenth century, many estate houses were surrounded by gardens influenced by Italian Renaissance gardens. From the late seventeenth century the formal gardens at Versailles and Dutch gardens were important models. In the eighteenth century less formal and symmetrical layouts became common with the development of the jardin anglais. In the nineteenth century there was a return of the formal garden near to the house. The development of the Palladian country house in the seventeenth century separated the family of the householder from the servants. Gentry families spent much of their time visiting family, friends or neighbours and hospitality was an important part of life. Major activities included hunting, cards, chess and music. Large and sumptuous meals were an important part of social life. In the eighteenth century, estate houses were designed as centres of public display, but in the nineteenth century they became increasingly private and developed distinct male areas.|$|E
