40|$|<b>Voglibose</b> is an {{alpha-glucosidase}} inhibitor {{used for}} lowering post-prandial blood glucose levels {{in patients with}} diabetes mellitus. <b>Voglibose</b> {{is known for its}} ability to increase glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) secretion in humans. Our recent study demonstrated new mechanisms by which <b>voglibose</b> increases plasma active GLP- 1 levels in diabetic ob/ob mice. As expected, the stimulatory effects of <b>voglibose</b> on GLP- 1 secretion resulted in increased active GLP- 1 levels in plasma in the 1 -day dosing study. Unexpectedly, chronic but not 1 -day treatment with <b>voglibose</b> decreased plasma dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 (DPP- 4) activity by reducing its circulating protein levels. We have also revealed that chronic dosing of <b>voglibose</b> increased Neurod 1 and Glucagon gene expression, and GLP- 1 content in the lower gut. Active GLP- 1 levels in plasma achieved by chronic treatment with <b>voglibose</b> were higher than those achieved by 1 -day treatment. In the present overview, by using acarbose, another alpha-glucosidase inhibitor with different selectivity, as a comparator, we demonstrated that inhibition of alpha-glucosidase induces a decrease in plasma DPP- 4 activity in ob/ob mice. Notably, compared to acarbose, <b>voglibose</b> has demonstrated more favorable effects on DPP- 4 activity, GLP- 1 secretion and gut GLP- 1 content, when glucose levels were equally improved, leading to higher plasma active GLP- 1 levels. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism underlying the increases in active GLP- 1 circulation by <b>voglibose...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{increased}} {{prevalence of}} {{type 2 diabetes}} mellitus {{is a major concern}} for the health providers. We have done an observation study in the diagnosed IGT patient who received and # 945;-glucosidase inhibitor (<b>voglibose),</b> which could prevent the development of type 2 diabetes in high-risk individuals. Methods: This study was an observational study comprising of <b>voglibose</b> and placebo in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance. 66 eligible patients were on the standard diet and taking regular exercise with impaired glucose tolerance were randomly assigned to oral <b>voglibose</b> 0. 2 mg three times a day (n= 66) or placebo (n= 60) in this study. Treatment was continued until participants developed type 2 diabetes (primary endpoint) or normoglycaemia (secondary endpoint). In the final analysis, 66 registered individuals fulfilled the inclusion criteria: 36 were randomly assigned to receive <b>voglibose</b> and 30 placebos (two participants in the placebo group did not take their medication and were excluded). Results: The mean duration of treatment was 48. 3 weeks (SD: 36. 4), i. e., 45. 4 weeks (34. 7) for <b>voglibose</b> and 51. 7 weeks (37. 4) for placebo. <b>Voglibose</b> was better than placebo (p= 0. 0024) in individuals treated for an average of 48. 3 weeks (SD 36. 4). Patients treated with <b>voglibose</b> had a lower risk of progression to type 2 diabetes than did those on placebo. More people in the <b>voglibose</b> group achieved normoglycaemia than did those in the placebo group. Conclusion: <b>Voglibose,</b> in addition to lifestyle modification, can reduce the development of type 2 diabetes in high risk individuals with impaired glucose tolerance.

40|$|Background: Type 2 Diabetes {{mellitus}} (DM) is {{a heterogeneous}} group of disorders associated with both microvascular and macrovascular complications. Due to progressive nature of type 2 DM, dual / triple drug therapy produce additive effects, less {{side effects and}} allows the use of submaximal doses of individual agents. Therefore, {{the present study was}} designed to study the effect of <b>voglibose</b> in comparison to pioglitazone on glycaemic and lipid profile as an add-on drug in patients with DM whose glycaemic status was uncontrolled with glimepiride and metformin. Methods: The present study was open, randomized parallel group comparison of two active treatment groups over a six months period. Sixty patients of either sex in the age group of 30 - 75 years, suffering from type 2 DM, with FBG> 126 mg/dl and HbA 1 c between 7 - 10 % were selected at random. The effect of <b>voglibose</b> and pioglitazone were observed on various parameters i. e. FBG, PPBG, HbA 1 c and lipid profile (Total cholesterol, TG, LDL, VLDL). Results: At the end of 6 months it was observed that though both pioglitazone and <b>voglibose</b> reduced FBG, PPBG and HbA 1 C significantly but pioglitazone caused a significantly greater percentage change in FBG as well as in PPBG whereas the difference in mean percentage change in HbA 1 C was not significant. Also, fall in total cholesterol, TG, LDL and VLDL was significantly greater with pioglitazone than <b>voglibose.</b> Few side effects were observed with <b>voglibose</b> and not with pioglitazone. Conclusions: Though pioglitazone and <b>voglibose</b> were equally effective in lowering HbA 1 C levels yet pioglitazone showed better results in improving FBG, PPBG and lipid profile as compared to <b>voglibose.</b> Pioglitazone had minimal side effects as compared to <b>voglibose.</b> [Int J Basic Clin Pharmacol 2012; 1 (3. 000) : 160 - 167...|$|E

World J Gastroenterol, 2001; 7 (2) : 270 - 274 AIM To determine whether diabetic care {{can be improved}} by combination of <b>voglibose</b> and gymnemic acid (GA), we compared the combinative and individual effects of <b>voglibose</b> and GA on maltose absorption in small intestine. METHODS The small intestine 30 cm long from 2 cm caudal ward Treitz’s ligament of Wistar rat {{was used as an}} in situ loop, which was randomly perfused in recircular mode with maltose (10 mmol/L) with or without different dosages of <b>voglibose</b> and/or GA for an hour. To compare the time course, perfusion of 10 mmol/L maltose was repeated four times. Each time continued for 1 hour and separated by 30 minutes rinse. In the first time, lower dosages of GA (0. 5 g/L) and/or <b>voglibose</b> (2 µmol/L) were contained except control. RESULTS Absorptive rate of maltose was the lowest in combinative group (P< 0. 05, ANOVA), for example, the inhibition rate was about 37 % during the first hour when 0. 5 g/L-GA and 2 µmol/L <b>voglibose</b> with 10 mmol/L maltose were perfused in the loop. The onset time was shortened to 30 minutes and the effective duration was prolonged to 4 hours with the combination; therefore the total amount of maltose absorption during the effective duration was inhibited more significantly than that in the individual administration (P< 0. 05, U test of Mann Whitney). The effect of GA on absorptive barriers of the intestine {{played an important role in}} the combinative effects. CONCLUSION There are augmented effects of <b>voglibose</b> and GA.

40|$|Background: The {{progressive}} {{nature of}} {{type 2 diabetes}} usually requires a combination {{of two or more}} oral agents in long term. Studies have been done to support its relevance. This study was made to observe the possible additive or supra-additive effect of the co-administration of <b>voglibose</b> and vildagliptin expecting it to be beneficial by enhancing the peptide GLP- 1 activity which in turn increases insulin secretion while decreasing that of glucagon in response to rise in plasma glucose. Methods: Healthy male wistar rats weighing 150 - 250 grams were taken for this study. The animals were divided into five groups, six animals in each group. These groups were normal control, diabetic control, vildagliptin treated, <b>voglibose</b> treated and by vildagliptin and <b>voglibose</b> (co-administered) treated group diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced by freshly prepared nicotinamide followed by streptozotocin intraperitoneal injection. The fasting blood samples were determined by glucose oxidase method. One way ANOVA test was used to compare the effect of drugs on different group. Results: Fasting blood glucose in normal control was found static. Diabetic rats fasting blood glucose level subsequently increased in different weeks. The animal treated by vildagliptin and <b>voglibose</b> orally has a better control of FBS in comparison to diabetic control group. The animal treated by co-administration of vildagliptin and <b>voglibose</b> had a better effect than vildagliptin treated group and <b>voglibose</b> treated animal.

40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} the dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 (DPP- 4) inhibitor, linagliptin, alone and in {{combination}} with <b>voglibose</b> or exendin- 4, on glycaemic control and body weight were assessed in an animal model of type 2 diabetes. <b>Voglibose</b> is an α-glucosidase inhibitor but also increases glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP- 1). Exendin- 4 is a GLP- 1 receptor agonist. Male Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats were dosed for 3 days, fasted overnight and a sucrose/glucose tolerance test was performed. Linagliptin (1 mg/kg po) improved glucose tolerance by increasing plasma GLP- 1 (active) and insulin secretion, whilst having no effect on body weight. <b>Voglibose</b> (1 and 10 mg/kg po) reduced body weight, improved glycaemic control, reduced plasma insulin and increased total but not active GLP- 1. The combination of linagliptin and <b>voglibose</b> significantly reduced body weight, improved glycaemic control and reduced plasma insulin compared to linagliptin alone. Furthermore, linagliptin plus <b>voglibose</b> produced a marked increase in GLP- 1 (active) at 5 min post-sucrose, compared to linagliptin, possibly because linagliptin prevented the degradation of GLP- 1 secreted in response to <b>voglibose.</b> Exendin- 4 (10 μg/kg sc) significantly reduced body weight, improved glucose tolerance but reduced GLP- 1 (active). The combination of linagliptin and exendin- 4 significantly reduced body weight and improved glycaemic control but {{had no effect on}} plasma GLP- 1. Overall it did not markedly improve glycaemic control compared to the individual drugs. The improved glucose control, reduced body weight and markedly increased plasma GLP- 1 levels in animals given linagliptin with <b>voglibose,</b> suggests that this combination may be particularly beneficial in the treatment of type 2 diabetes...|$|E

Substantiation of {{necessity}} of pathogenetic {{approach to the}} choice of method for type 2 diabetes mellitus prevention {{on the basis of}} studying clinical efficiency and tolerability of <b>voglibose</b> in persons with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Methods. We have observed 25 persons with IGT in age from 35 to 55 years. Clinical examination included measuring of height, body mass, body mass index (BMІ), waist circumference (WC), blood pressure, heart rate, glucose tolerance test, determination of glycated haemoglobin level, parameters of blood lipids, random level of immunoreactive insulin with evaluation of insulin resistance (IR) index after НОМА-IR equation and total cardiovascular risk after SCORE scale. Persons with IGT received <b>voglibose</b> (Voksid, produced by Kusum Pharm LLC, Ukraine) in a dose of 0. 2 mg before breakfast, dinner and supper during three months. In 3 months we have carried out reexamination with the assessment of metabolic effects of preparation and study of total cardiovascular risk dynamics. Results. Antihyperglycemic therapy with <b>voglibose</b> in a dose 0. 6 mg/day lead to the reliable decline of all basic parameters of carbohydrate metabolism, body mass, BMI and WC parameters, total cholesterol, triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.

Accordingly, ursodeoxycholic acid and ezetimibe therapy was started and continued until the performance of a liver needle biopsy to define the diagnosis. However, no improvement in liver function was observed. In addition, pathological findings indicated that the patient had NASH. The patient was finally diagnosed as having NASH. Therefore, <b>voglibose</b> was added to the ursodeoxycholic acid and ezetimibe therapy, and this addition of <b>voglibose</b> actually took effect. The patient’s serum aspartate transaminase and alanine aminotransferase levels decreased dramatically.

40|$|Renal {{renin-angiotensin system}} (RAS) {{activation}} {{is one of}} the important pathogenic mechanisms in the development of diabetic nephropathy in type 2 diabetes. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT- 2) inhibitor, dapagliflozin, on renal RAS in an animal model with type 2 diabetes. Dapagliflozin (1. 0 mg/kg, OL-DA) or <b>voglibose</b> (0. 6 mg/kg, OL-VO, diabetic control) (n = 10 each) was administered to Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats for 12 weeks. We used <b>voglibose,</b> an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, as a comparable counterpart to SGLT 2 inhibitor because of its postprandial glucose-lowering effect without proven renoprotective effects. Control Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LT) and OLETF (OL-C) rats received saline (n = 10, each). Changes in blood glucose, urine albumin, creatinine clearance, and oxidative stress were measured. Inflammatory cell infiltration, mesangial widening, and interstitial fibrosis in the kidney were evaluated by histological analysis. The effects of dapagliflozin on renal expression of the RAS components were evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR in renal tissue. After treatment, hyperglycemia and urine microalbumin levels were attenuated in both OL-DA and OL-VO rather than in the OL-C group (P < 0. 05). The urine angiotensin II (Ang II) and angiotensinogen levels were significantly decreased following treatment with dapagliflozin or <b>voglibose,</b> but suppression of urine Ang II level was more prominent in the OL-DA than the OL-VO group (P < 0. 05). The expressions of angiotensin type 1 receptor and tissue oxidative stress markers were markedly increased in OL-C rats, which were reversed by dapagliflozin or <b>voglibose</b> (P < 0. 05, both). Inflammatory cell infiltration, mesangial widening, interstitial fibrosis, and total collagen content were significantly increased in OL-C rats, which were attenuated in OL-DA group (P < 0. 05). Dapagliflozin treatment showed beneficial effects on diabetic nephropathy, which might be via suppression of renal RAS component expression, oxidative stress and interstitial fibrosis in OLETF rats. We suggest that, in addition to control of hyperglycemia, partial suppression of renal RAS with an SGLT 2 inhibitor would be a promising strategy for the prevention of treatment of diabetic nephropathy...|$|E

40|$|Background-—Endothelial {{dysfunction}} is {{an independent}} predictor for cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes (T 2 DM). Glucagon like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1) reportedly exerts vasodilatory actions, and inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 (DPP- 4), an enzyme-degrading GLP- 1, are widely used to treat T 2 DM. We therefore hypothesized that DPP- 4 inhibitors (DPP- 4 Is) improve endothelial function in T 2 DM patients and performed 2 prospective, randomized crossover trials to compare the DPP- 4 I sitagliptin and an a-glucosidase inhibitor, <b>voglibose</b> (in study 1) and the DPP- 4 Is sitagliptin and alogliptin (in study 2). Methods and Results-—In study 1, 24 men with T 2 DM (465 years) were randomized to sitagliptin or <b>voglibose</b> for 6 weeks without washout periods. Surprisingly, sitagliptin significantly reduced flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMD; 51 % compared with baseline, P< 0. 05) of the brachial artery despite improved diabetic status. In contrast, <b>voglibose</b> did not affect FMD. To confirm this result and determine {{whether it is a}} class effect, we conducted another trial (study 2) to compare sitagliptin and alogliptin in 42 T 2 DM patients (668 years) for 6 weeks with 4 -week washout periods. Both DPP- 4 Is improved glycemic control but significantly attenuated FMD (7. 2 / 4. 3 %, P< 0. 001, before/after sitagliptin; 7. 0 / 4. 8 %, P< 0. 001, before/after alogliptin, respectively). Interestingly, FMD reduction was less evident in subjects who were on statins or whose LDL cholesterol levels were reduced by them, but this was not correlated with parameters including DPP- 4 activity and GLP- 1 levels or diabetic parameters. Conclusions-—Our 2 independent trials demonstrated that DPP- 4 inhibition attenuated endothelial function as evaluated by FMD i...|$|E
40|$|New {{therapeutic}} {{options to}} control diabetes mellitus (DM) emerged {{with the discovery}} of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors which slow the absorption of carbohydrates in the small intestine. The objective of the study — to investigate the effect of <b>voglibose</b> administration on parameters of glycemic control, lipid metabolism and tolerability in patients with DM type 1. Materials and Methods. Criteria for inclusion in the study: DM type 1, age from 26 to 48 years, the level of glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c) from 8 to 9 %. 19 patients were examined (7 men and 12 women, mean age 37. 2 ± ±  3. 9 years, DM duration 8. 5 ± 1. 4 years. Results. During the follow-up period (12 weeks), the level of HbA 1 c significantly decreased from 9. 4 ± 0. 6 % to 7. 8 ± 0. 4 % (p < 0. 05). On the background of additional administration of <b>voglibose,</b> we observed a significant reduction in fasting glucose level from 10. 37 ± 0. 36 mmol/l to 7. 39  ± 0. 28 mmol/l (p < 0. 01) and postprandial — from 12. 29  ± 1. 42 mmol/l to 8. 46 ± 0. 64 mmol/l (p < 0. 01). At that, we have noted a significant reduction of total cholesterol (from 5. 83 ± 0. 11 mmol/l to 5. 38 ± 0. 08 mmol/l, p < 0. 05), triglycerides (from 1. 82 ± 0. 03 mmol/l to 1. 46 ± 0. 03 mmol/l, p < 0. 05) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (from 3. 41 ± 0. 05 mmol/l to 3. 37 ± ± 0. 04 mmol/l, p < 0. 05). There were no significant changes in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol parameters. In two surveyed persons, we have detected adverse effects (bloating), which did not require discontinuation of therapy. Conclusion. Additional administration of <b>voglibose</b> at a dose of 0. 9 mg/day on a background of insulin therapy helps to improve glycemic control and lipid metabolism, to reduce the daily dose of exogenous insulin and hypoglycemic reactions incidence in patients with DM type 1...|$|E
40|$|The Author(s) 2014. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Background and Objectives In {{this study we}} {{examined the effects of}} switching a-glucosidase inhibitors (a-GI) from acarbose or <b>voglibose</b> to miglitol on glucose fluctu-ations and circulating concentrations of cardiovascular disease risk factors, such as soluble adhesion molecules (sE-selectin, sICAM- 1 and sVCAM- 1), a chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP) - 1, plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1, and fatty acid-binding protein 4, in type 2 diabetic patients for 3 months. Methods We enrolled 47 Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes, with HbA 1 c levels with 7. 26 ± 0. 5 % (mean ± standard deviation), and who were treated with the highest approved dose of acarbose (100 mg/meal) or <b>voglibose</b> (0. 3 mg/meal) in combination with insulin or sulfonylurea. Patients ’ prior a-GIs were switched to a medium dose of miglitol (50 mg/meal), and the new treatments were main-tained for 3 months. Thirty-five patients who completed the 3 -month study and provided serum samples were analyzed. Results The switch to miglitol for 3 months did not affect HbA 1 c, fasting glucose, triglycerides, total-cholesterol or C-reactive protein levels, or result in any adverse events. Glucose fluctuations were significantly improved by the change in treatment (M-value: 10. 54 ± 4. 32 to 8. 36 ± 2. 54), while serum protein concentrations of MCP- 1 (525. 04 ± 288. 06 – 428. 11 ± 163. 78 pg/mL) and sE-selectin (18. 65 ± 9. 77 – 14. 50 ± 6. 26 ng/mL) were suppressed. Conclusion Our results suggest that switching from acarbose or <b>voglibose</b> to miglitol for 3 months suppressed glucose fluctuations and serum protein levels of MCP- 1 and sE-selectin in type 2 diabetic Japanese patients, with fewer adverse effects. Key Points Switching a-glucosidase inhibitors to miglitol reduced glucose fluctuations and circulating cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in type 2 diabetic Japanese patients Reducing glucose fluctuations may reduce the development of CVD in type 2 diabetic patients...|$|E

Chromatographic separation was performed on aluminium plates precoated with silica gel 60 F 254 as the stationary phase. A dual run technique was adopted for better resolution amongst all three drugs with solvent system initially toluene-methanol-ethyl acetate-formic acid (3 : 4 : 3 : 0. 5, v/v/v/v) for separation of metformin. The plates were dried and developed again using another mobile phase system consisting of toluene-ethyl acetate-formic acid (5 : 5 : 1, v/v/v) for glimepiride and <b>voglibose.</b> Densitometric scanning {{was carried out in}} the absorbance mode at 254 nm. The linear regression data for calibration plots showed good linear relationship in the concentration range of 200 - 1200 ng/band for MET, 20 - 120 ng/band for GLI and VOG. The method was validated for precision, accuracy, robustness and recovery as per ICH guidelines and applied for quantification in their available combined pharmaceutical dosage form.

40|$|A 69 -year-old man was {{diagnosed}} as having myasthenia gravis (MG) in September 2004, and treated with thymectomy and prednisolone. He was then diagnosed as having steroid-induced diabetes mellitus, and received sulfonylurea (SU) therapy in May 2005. An alpha- glucosidase inhibitor (αGI) was added in March 2006, resulting in good glycemic control. He experienced symptoms of abdominal distention, increased flatus, and constipation in October 2007, and was admitted into our hospital in late November with hematochezia. Plain abdominal radiography revealed small linear radiolucent clusters in {{the wall of the}} colon. Computed tomography (CT) showed intramural air in the sigmoid colon. Colonoscopy revealed multiple smooth surfaced hemispherical protrusions in the sigmoid colon. The diagnosis of pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis (PCI) was {{made on the basis of}} these findings. As the αGI <b>voglibose</b> was suspected as the cause of this patient’s PCI, treatment was conservative, ceasing <b>voglibose,</b> with fasting and fluid supplementation. The patient progressed well, and was discharged 2 wk later. Recently, several reports of PCI associated with αGI therapy have been published, predominantly in Japan where αGIs are commonly used. If the use of αGIs becomes more widespread, we can expect more reports of this condition on a global scale. The possibility of PCI should be considered in diabetic patients complaining of gastrointestinal symptoms, and the gastrointestinal tract should be thoroughly investigated in these patients...|$|E

Key features of the film formulation were achieved utilizing several ratios of excipients, including polyvinyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, hyaluronic acid, xylitol, and alginate. The scaffold film showed superior encapsulation capability and swelling properties, with various potential applications, eg, the treatment of diabetes-associated complications. Structural and light scattering characterization confirmed a spherical shape and a mean particle size distribution of 41. 3 nm for nanoparticles in the scaffold film. Spectroscopy revealed a stable polymer structure before and after encapsulation. The thermoresponsive swelling properties of the film were evaluated according to temperature and pH. Scaffold films incorporating dual drug-loaded nanoparticles showed remarkably high thermoresponsivity, cell compatibility, and ex vivo drug-release behavior. In addition, the hybrid film formulation showed enhanced cell adhesion and proliferation.
