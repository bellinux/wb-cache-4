5|$|Following {{the example}} of Mozambique, the Zambian and Botswana governments {{permitted}} guerrillas to establish bases from which they could threaten and infiltrate Rhodesia. Van der Byl told a newspaper reporter that {{this had to be}} expected.

5|$|London's vast {{urban area}} is often {{described}} using a set of district names, such as Bloomsbury, Mayfair, Wembley and Whitechapel. These are either informal designations, reflect the names of <b>villages</b> <b>that</b> have been absorbed by sprawl, or are superseded administrative units such as parishes or former boroughs.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the less}} populous of the former <b>villages</b> <b>that</b> {{comprise}} the metropolitan borough, Carr Hill {{has a long history}} and was first developed by the Romans. During the Industrial Revolution it became the centre of pottery making in Tyneside, and numerous stone quarries, glass makers and windmills were set up. It also had a large reservoir providing water to several areas of Gateshead and Newcastle upon Tyne.|$|E
5|$|The Sinhalese Nampota dated in {{its present}} form to the 14th or 15th century CE {{suggests}} that the whole of the Tamil Kingdom, including parts of the modern Trincomalee District, was recognised as a Tamil region by the name Demala-pattanama (Tamil city). In this work, a number of <b>villages</b> <b>that</b> are now situated in the Jaffna, Mullaitivu and Trincomalee districts are mentioned as places in Demala-pattanama.|$|E

5|$|Traffic {{through the}} village has been so heavy on {{weekends}} during summer and peak leaf peeping weekends in early autumn that many residents have proposed making Main Street one-way, carrying traffic only to the west, while diverting eastbound traffic onto either of two parallel streets. Other <b>villages</b> <b>that</b> have made such changes found making streets one-way decreased business at their retailers.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the storm, the Guam National Weather Service {{issued a}} typhoon watch for Agrihan, Pagan, and Alamagan, {{as well as}} a high surf {{advisory}} for Guam. The watch was later upgraded to a warning, and was canceled after the typhoon exited the region. Flights were delayed or canceled to the region due to the storm and problems with the local aircraft communication system. During the storm, there were minor power outages on Saipan in two <b>villages</b> <b>that</b> were quickly restored. On Alamagan where the storm struck, six people rode out the storm in a concrete bunker.|$|E
5|$|As {{with local}} Tamils, the {{preferred}} marriage pattern {{is based on}} cross cousin preference. Parallel cousins are considered {{brothers and sisters and}} are ineligible as partners. As most marriages take place between first and second cousins, clan endogamy even it is present is of no value. Within a village, most of the residents are related and this carries on over to <b>villages</b> <b>that</b> are three to five miles away as well. The longer the distance the more distantly are the villagers related to each other. Related lineages also maintain places of worship that are the private property of the family group.|$|E

5|$|In 1927, viticultural {{boundaries}} of Champagne were legally defined and split into five wine producing districts- The Aube, Côte des Blancs, Côte de Sézanne, Montagne de Reims, and Vallée de la Marne. This area covers 33,500 hectares (76,000 acres) of vineyards around 319 <b>villages</b> <b>that</b> {{are home to}} 5,000 growers who make their own wine and 14,000 growers who only sell grapes. The region is set to expand to include 359 villages in the near future.|$|E
5|$|In {{the small}} town of Champaner (in the state of Gujarat, western India) {{during the height of the}} British empire in India in 1893, Captain Andrew Russell (Paul Blackthorne), the {{commanding}} officer of the Champaner cantonment, has imposed high taxes ("Lagaan") on people from the local <b>villages</b> <b>that</b> they are unable to pay due to a prolonged drought. Led by Bhuvan (Aamir Khan), the villagers beg Raja Puran Singh (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) to help them. He tells them that, much to his regret, he is bound by British law.|$|E
5|$|The {{villages in}} the {{mountains}} to the south, west, and north of the Salmas Plain were generally smaller, and accounted for about half {{of the total number of}} <b>villages</b> <b>that</b> were lost. The foreshock was not felt at Borusliqalan (the westernmost village that was destroyed) and the losses were high. The foreshock was also not strongly felt to the east of Lake Urmia (and to the southwest of Tabriz) where the village of Mamaqan was completely destroyed and 85 people were killed. Other nearby villages went almost unscathed, with the differing amounts of damage being attributed to soil type.|$|E

5|$|Though {{supported}} by many politicians and businesses in Alaska, {{the project was}} canceled after objections were raised. Native Alaskans in the area protested the threatened loss of nine <b>villages</b> <b>that</b> would be flooded by the dam. Conservation groups abhorred the threatened flooding of the Yukon Flats, a large area of wetlands that provides a critical breeding ground for millions of waterfowl. Fiscal conservatives opposed the dam {{on the grounds of}} its large cost and limited benefit to Americans outside Alaska.|$|E
5|$|Udall imposed {{the freeze}} on any {{projects}} involving land claimed by Alaska Natives {{in hopes that}} an overarching Native claims settlement would result. In the fall of 1969, the Department of the Interior and TAPS set about bypassing the land freeze by obtaining waivers from the various native <b>villages</b> <b>that</b> had claims to {{a portion of the}} proposed right of way. By the end of September, all the relevant villages had waived their right-of-way claims, and Secretary of the Interior Wally Hickel asked Congress to lift the land freeze for the entire TAPS project. After several months of questioning by the House and Senate committees with oversight of the project, Hickel was given the authority to lift the land freeze and give the go-ahead to TAPS.|$|E
5|$|An {{epidemic}} of dysentery broke {{out on the}} Kokoda Track that threatened the entire force. Some 1,200 casualties, mostly dysentery, reached Ilolo in September. Simple hygiene procedures involving the disposal of rubbish and excrement were required, but were neglected {{in the early stages}} of the campaign. Lieutenant Colonel Edward Ford arranged for supplies of a new drug, sulphaguanidine, to be shipped from Australia. The widespread use of a scarce drug was a gamble, as it used up all the stocks in Australia, but one that paid off; it arrested the epidemic, and allowed sick men to travel, thereby saving lives. When the Australians advanced on Kokoda in October, special details constructed latrines, buried the dead, and, in extreme cases, burned <b>villages</b> <b>that</b> the Japanese had fouled beyond redemption.|$|E

5|$|During its {{involvement}} in the battle, the 61st Battalion suffered 19 killed and 27 wounded. They remained at Milne Bay until March 1943, however, when they were withdrawn to Donadabu, near Port Moresby where the battalion undertook training exercises and carried out patrols around the <b>villages</b> <b>that</b> were scattered around {{the start of the}} Kokoda Track. As the battalion was brought back up to full establishment, they were warned out for combat on a number of occasions, however, eventually it was decided to withdraw the 7th Brigade back to Australia in November 1943. For his leadership of the battalion during this time, the 61st Battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Meldrum, was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). Captain Charles Bicks, who had commanded 'B' Company during the fighting around Milne Bay, also received a DSO.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, Nhu {{began work}} on the ambitious Strategic Hamlet Program, an attempt to build {{fortified}} <b>villages</b> <b>that</b> would be secure zones for rural Vietnamese. The objective was to lock the Vietcong out {{so that they could}} not operate among the villagers. Thảo supervised these efforts, and when told that the peasants resented being forcibly removed from their ancestral lands and put into forts that they were forced to build, he advised Nhu and Tuyến that it was imperative to build as many hamlets as fast as possible. This pleased the Vietcong, who felt that Thảo's efforts were turning the rural populace against Saigon. Thảo specifically had villages built in areas that he knew had a strong Vietcong presence. This increased the number of communist sympathisers who were placed inside the hamlets and given identification cards. As a result, the Vietcong were able to more effectively penetrate the villages to access supplies and personnel.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 17th century, the three <b>villages</b> <b>that</b> predated Calcutta were {{ruled by the}} Nawab of Bengal under Mughal suzerainty. After the Nawab granted the East India Company a trading licence in 1690, the area was {{developed}} by the Company into an increasingly fortified trading post. Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah occupied Calcutta in 1756, and the East India Company retook it the following year. In 1793 the East India company was strong enough to abolish Nizamat (local rule), and assumed full sovereignty of the region. Under the company rule, and later under the British Raj, Calcutta served as the capital of British-held territories in India until 1911, when its perceived geographical disadvantages, combined with growing nationalism in Bengal, led to a shift of the capital to New Delhi. Calcutta was the centre for the Indian independence movement; it remains a hotbed of contemporary state politics. Following Indian independence in 1947, Kolkata, which was once the centre of modern Indian education, science, culture, and politics, suffered several decades of economic stagnation.|$|E
