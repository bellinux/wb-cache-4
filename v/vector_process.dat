40|$|A new {{approach}} to provide a complete characterization of normal multivariate stochastic <b>vector</b> <b>processes</b> is presented in this paper. Such proposed method {{is based on the}} evaluation of the complex spectral moments of the processes. These quantities are strictly related to the Mellin transform and they are the generalization of the integer-order spectral moments introduced by Vanmarcke. The knowledge of the complex spectral moments permits to obtain the power spectral densities and their cross counterpart by a complex series expansions. Moreover, with just the aid of some mathematical properties the complex fractional moments permit to obtain also the correlation and cross-correlation functions, providing a complete characterization of the multivariate stochastic <b>vector</b> <b>processes.</b> Some numerical applications are reported in order to show the capabilities of this method.
