40|$|AbstractThe {{fracture}} {{system of}} fractured-vuggy reservoir {{is dominated by}} orthogonal fracture, and the vug system develops along the fracture. In view of this characteristic, two different kinds of models were made in this paper: the fracture medium model and the fractured-vuggy medium model. A series of two-phase fluid flow experiments were conducted to obtain the relative permeability curves. The {{results show that the}} oil and water relative permeability curves have a regular alternative relation of growing and declining, while the percolation resistance changes little, which indicates that there is no Jamin action that caused by the complexity of pore structure. Fracture aperture, fracture network structure, vug density and <b>vug</b> <b>porosity</b> have different influence on the relative permeability characteristic of fractured-vuggy medium, and the influence shows a obvious regularity...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 46 - 48). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Flow units in the Oxfordian Smackover Formation at Vocation and Appleton Fields were identified, mapped, and ranked as part of an integrated reservoir characterization project. Pore categories by origin, pore and pore throat geometries, pore-scale diagenetic history, and core-scale depositional attributes were logged with conventional petrographic and lithological methods. Resulting data were combined with core descriptions, mercury-injection capillary pressure data, and wireline log data to produce flow unit maps at field scale. Appleton and Vocation Fields produce from grainstone buildups and microbial reefs. Classification of microbial fabrics within reefs was found to have significant influence on pore facies and flow unit quality rankings and ultimately on reservoir quality in these fields in particular and in southwest Alabama in general. Microbial reefs are composed of five fabric categories and growth forms that reflect variations in water energy, sedimentation rate and substrate. They include Type I layered thrombolite with characteristic mm/cm-scale crypts, Type II reticulate and "chaotic" thrombolite, Type III dendroidal thrombolites, Type IV isolated stromatolitic crusts, and Type V oncoidal packstone/grainstones that grew on soft to firm substrates in high-energy conditions. Types I, II, and III buildups are the most productive reservoirs. Of these, Type III buildups contain the highest quality reservoir rocks, which consist of extensively dolomitized reticulate and dendritic fabrics that have well-connected intercrystalline and vuggy porosity. Types IV and V microbialites are poor reservoir rocks because Type IV reefs are rarely in communication with the bulk of the reservoir and Type V oncoids exhibit separate <b>vug</b> <b>porosity</b> with low to moderate permeability. Results of this work have improved our understanding of complex grainstone and microbial reef reservoirs. In so doing, the results have improved our ability to characterize and model complex reservoir architecture, pore systems and flow unit quality from pore to core to field scale. This study should enable more accurate and economical development of these fields and of others like them...|$|E
40|$|Sonic {{velocities}} of Pleistocene travertines {{were measured}} under variable confining pressures. Combined with petrographical characteristics and petrophysical data, i. e. porosity, permeability and density, {{it was determined}} that travertine porosity, pore types and cementation control compressional-wave (V p) and shear-wave velocity (V s). At 40  MPa confining pressures, V p ranges between 3695 and 6097  m/s and V s between 2037 and 3140  m/s. Velocity variations in travertines are, as with all carbonates, primarily linked to sample heterogeneity, i. e. differences in fabric, texture and porosity. They thus not necessarily emanate from changes in mineralogy or composition. Body wave velocities have a positive correlation with sample density and an inverse correlation with porosity. The travertines, sampled in extensional settings with normal faulting activity, define a specific compressional-wave velocity (y -axis) versus porosity (x -axis) equation, i. e. (log(y)  = − 0. 0048 x  +  3. 7844) that differs from the V p -porosity paths defined by marine carbonates. Acoustic wave velocities are higher for travertines than for marine carbonates. Travertine precipitates form rigid rock frames, often called framestone, with large primary pores. Marine carbonates on the other hand often consist of (cemented) transported sediments, resulting in a rock frame that permits slower wave propagation when compared to the continental limestones. Acoustic velocity variations are linked to variations in pore types. Mouldic pores (macropores) show faster wave propagation than expected from their total porosities. Microporosity, interlaminar and interpeloidal porosity result in slower acoustic velocities. Framework pores and micro-moulds are associated with lowered acoustic velocities, while <b>vug</b> <b>porosity</b> is found above, on and below the general velocity-porosity trend. Not only the pore type, but also pore shapes exert control on body wave velocities. Cuboid-and rod-like pore shapes increase the velocity, while plate-and blade-like pore shapes {{have a negative effect on}} the velocity. The study demonstrates how seismic sections in travertine systems can contain seismic reflections that are not caused by non-carbonate intercalations, but relate to geobody boundaries, in which the seismic expression is function of porosity, pore types and shapes. This study provides and relates petrophysical data, i. e. porosity, permeability and acoustic velocities of travertines and is of importance for the interpretation of seismic reflection data in subsurface continental carbonate reservoirs...|$|E
30|$|There {{are three}} reasons in the {{difficulty}} of facies modeling and prediction from well logs as follows: (1) the complexity of carbonate facies structures, (2) strong diagenetic overprinting, and (3) challenging log analysis due to presence of vugs and fractures (Tang et al. 2009). Using the general method described by Hurley, Vug fraction was quantified from the core slabs (Hurley et al. 1998). Visual descriptions of core showed dimensions of individual vugs vary ranging from 2 – 3  mm to 2  cm (Pinous et al. 2007). In 1962, Towle considered some assumed pore geometries as well as tortuosity, and noticed {{a variation in the}} porosity exponent m in Archie’s equation ranging from 2.67 to 7.3 + for vuggy reservoirs, and values much smaller than two for fractured reservoirs. Matrix porosity of Towle’s models is considered as zero (Towle 1962). The previous studies on detecting vuggy porosities include: a study by Aguilera and Aguilera on carbonate reservoirs by triple porosity model which are composed of mainly matrix, fractures and non-connected vugs using petrophysical evaluation (Aguilera and Aguilera 2004) developing an expression for the formation resistivity factor of vuggy fractured media in terms of fracture and <b>vug</b> <b>porosities</b> (Perez-Rosales et al. 2002).|$|R

Porosity that is not considered [...] "effective porosity" [...] includes water bound to clay particles (known as bound water) and isolated [...] "vuggy" [...] <b>porosity</b> (<b>vugs</b> not connected to other pores).

40|$|Because {{of their}} {{economic}} importance as hydrocarbon reservoirs, the Upper Devonian dolomitized carbonate reefs in southwest Alberta {{have been the subject}} of several studies. Still, there is no consensus on the process of matrix dolomitization and furthermore, the process of vug development is not often addressed. The studied outcrops show features of an early diagenetic matrix-selective dolomitization by a Late Devonian seawater-derived fluid. Seepage reflux dolomitization combined with latent reflux is proposed, which best explains most chemical characteristics. The cements in the vugs are precipitated from warm saline, Sr- 87 -enriched fluids and testify to thermogenic sulphate reduction based on the presence of sulphur, CO 2 and H 2 S in inclusions, relatively high homogenization temperatures and depleted delta C- 13 values, which sets constraints on the timing of <b>vug</b> formation.

30|$|To {{study the}} flow pattern more intuitively, {{numerous}} physical {{models have been}} built and related experiments have been performed. Two types of models were constructed to obtain the relative permeability curves; {{the results showed that}} fracture aperture, fracture network structure, vug density, and <b>vug</b> <b>porosity</b> had different effects on relative permeability, and that the influence effect exhibited evident regularity (Lv et al. 2011). Zeng et al. (2011) considered that the single-phase oil–water flow in ultra-low-permeability cores was inconsistent with Darcy’s law. A typical flow curve is a combination of a straight line and a concave curve. When the permeability of the core is low, the nonlinearity of the concave curve is strong. Lian and Cheng (2012) conducted experiments on the oil–water relative permeability of carbonate cores from the Kenkiyak oil field and compared the differences in relative permeability curves between the natural matrix cores and the artificial fracture cores. Their study showed that water injection should be implemented when reservoir pressure was relatively higher to maintain formation pressure during water flooding and reduce the effect of stress sensitivity. Dong et al. (2013) studied the influencing factors of the relative permeability of oil and water in a single fracture. The result showed that relative permeability decreases with increasing water–oil viscosity ratio, decreasing fracture aperture, and increasing displacement velocity. Karimaie and Torsæter (2007) assumed that the oil production rate increased with increasing initial water saturation, and breakthrough oil recovery was higher when the water injection rate was low. Hou et al. (2014) performed a macroscopic 3 D physical study of the water breakthrough pattern of fracture–vuggy reservoirs. The result showed the water breakthrough time was controlled by the connectivity of the well to the bottom water. Tong et al. (2015) believed that intermittent injection could optimize the function of oil–water gravity segregation, thereby reducing water cut and significantly improving the production rate of the initial stages compared with continuous injection. The distribution law of the remaining oil in the fracture-cavity reservoir was studied based on full diameter cores (Wang et al. 2012, 2014). The result showed the remaining oil after primary water flooding, which includes “attic oil,” “occlusion oil,” “oil film,” “corner oil,” and “blind cavity oil.” These researchers believed that the remaining oil could be recovered via secondary water flooding, gas injection, chemical flooding, fracturing, and other stimulation measures.|$|E
40|$|Repetitive {{sequences}} of carbonate deposits, occurrence {{include in the}} lower part of the Paleogene Carbonate Unit (northeast border of the Madrid Basin), have been studied, defining regressive lacustrine sequences and early diagenetic processes. Binocular microscopic examination, scanning electron microscopic/energy dispersive X-ray observations, and X-ray diffraction analyses joint to isotopic studies (d 18 O and d 13 C) have been used to characterise the facies and environments. The sequences consist of a lower uncemented carbonate mud unit, calcitic or dolomitic in composition, and an upper carbonate unit (arenites, bioclastic limestones, and microbial laminated limestones with cherts). Visual features (vertical prismatic structures, fissures, massive nodulization, rhizoliths, brecciation) and microscopic features (micrite micronodules, <b>vug</b> <b>porosity,</b> circumgranular cementation, gypsum lenticular crystals) outline pedogenic processes. These features, found locally in bioclastic and microbial laminated limestones or in dolomite uncemented muds, define, respectively, palustrine limestones or dolocretes. Facies analysis allows us to define several lacustrine sub-environments (basinal, littoral, eulittoral and supralittoral) and characterises different types of shallowing upward lacustrine sequences, either with or without subaerial exposure. The isotopic values of the bioclastic and microbial laminated limestone (from 5. 77 xto 6. 78 xfor d 13 C, and from 5. 25 xto 5. 53 xfor d 18 O) and those of uncemented calcitic muds (from 5. 80 xto 7. 01 xfor d 13 C, and from 4. 98 xto 5. 58 xfor d 18 O) establish that both types of carbonates precipitated in equilibrium with meteoric waters. In the palustrine carbonate deposits, the d 13 C values suggest a strong organic contribution. The dolomitization that only affected the uncemented carbonate muds is early interpreted because of the structural and compositional characteristics of the dolomite (micro-rhombic dolomicrite, nearly stoichiometric and poorly ordered), and because the calculated average D 18 O dol–cal for calcitic and dolomitic uncemented muds is about 6 x. The d 18 O isotopic values indicate that the dolomite precipitated from water that was slightly more enriched in heavy isotopes than the calcite, because of an increase in evaporation rates. Nodules and nodular levels of cherts occur in the upper units of littoral and eulittoral sequences, probably as a consequence of the existence of microbial mats that could include the silica source. According to their mineralogy (Opal CT and quartz/moganite) and structures (double nodules, lamination and bioturbation), three types of chert are described (TB, MB and WO). These types define three general stages of silicification during the early diagenesis, from the recently buried to the postcompactation of carbonate deposits. The d 18 O values of quartz show that the silicification and ageing of opaline phases occurred from meteoric waters, which were lighter than the calcite or dolomite precipitating waters. The cherts included in palustrine limestones show d 18 O values of quartz that record more evaporated waters than those of the general stages of silicification...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 126 - 129). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Three distinct lower Mississippian (Kinderhookian) carbonate buildups are found at the mouth of Swimming Woman Canyon, located on the southern flank of the Big Snowy Mountains, in central Montana. These buildups are composed of Lodgepole Limestone, which was deposited during a marine transgression. These buildups are similar to massive "Waulsortian'' mud mounds recognized worldwide, named after the original buildups discovered in Waulsort, Belgium. The Lodgepole buildups resemble subsurface mounds located in Dickinson Field, North Dakota. Mounds in Dickinson Field have similar depositional features, mound facies, and diagenetic histories compared with the mounds outcropping at Swimming Woman Canyon. In addition, the Dickinson mound facies are good hydrocarbon reservoirs. Initial production of a Lodgepole well is expected to be water-free and at a rate of 1000 BOPD or greater. Porosity in the mounds averages 5 %, oil columns in the mounds average 180 feet, and the mound rock varies between 250 to 320 feet thick (Young et al., 1998). Both sets of mounds are composed primarily of early depositional submarine cements, clotted lime mud, and stromatactoid vugs. These <b>vugs</b> created depositional <b>porosity</b> while the mounds were forming, and contribute greatly to the total reservoir porosity in the subsurface Dickinson Field mounds. In addition, the biota from both localities is quite diverse, composed of macro and microorganisms found globally in Waulsortian fossil assemblages. Diagenetic features of the mounds - most notably the pore-filling blocky calcite cements are saddle dolomite cements- are seen in the Montana and North Dakota mounds. Early rim cements and replacement chalcedony are also present. Cathodoluminescence and isotope analysis also show correlation between the Mississippian mounds of Montana and North Dakota suggesting that both areas formed in related paleoenvironmental conditions and underwent similar diagenetic histories...|$|R
40|$|The Sulaiman Range {{is located}} on the {{northwest}} margin of the Indian Plate. It forms the middle part of the Indus basin, and has been termed the Sulaiman sub-basin. The Indus basin is filled with a thick sequence of Mesozoic and Cenozoic sediments. The Dungan Formation is Palaeocene in age and comprises a 98 m thick predominantly carbonate sequence which extends about 200 km from north to south along the Sulaiman Range. The Formation is characterised by different microfacies. Petrographic studies revealed the following microfacies; peritidal carbonate, inner lagoon, oolitic, outer lagoon, rhodolith platform, nummulitic, larger foraminiferal, and planktonic foraminiferal. All these facies can be interpreted broadly within a homoclinal, windward carbonate ramp model. The cementation history has been investigated by petrography of stained thin sections, cathodoluminescence microscopy, XRD, electron microprobe, SEM (in back scattered mode), XRF, and carbon and oxygen stable isotope analysis to reveal trace element contents and their variation in the diagenetic cements. The diagenesis of the formation starts from the marine phreatic environment, characterised by micritization and peloidal cements. These cements are of high Mg-calcite, and low in Fe and Mn. They do not show luminescence. The active fresh water phreatic zone may involve leaching in the zone of solution, neomorphism, isopachous bladed cement around the oolites and foraminifera, syntaxial overgrowth cement on echinoderm fragments, and interlocking crystals of equant calcite that coarsen towards the pore centres (drusy cement). The neomorphic spars having irregular boundaries and are cloudy and patchy. They are also low in Fe and Mn, and non-luminescent. The isopachous bladed cements are low in Mg and high in Fe and Mn and show orange luminescence. The syntaxial overgrowth cements are low Mg-calcite. They show bright zoned luminescence, indicating different zones of Fe and Mn concentration. The drusy cement is also low Mg-calcite, and shows dull to orange luminescence indicating the high concentrations of Fe and Mn as compared to marine cement. The oxygen isotopic values of this cement type are low when compared to the whole rock. <b>Vug</b> and mould <b>porosities</b> are developed in the freshwater vadose zone, which are filled by sparry calcite cement. The shallow burial environment is marked by compaction of skeletal grains, stylolites and fractures. The fractures show two generations. The early fracture fills cements are non ferroan and show bright zoned luminescence. The later fracture fills cements are ferroan and non-luminescent. The oxygen isotope values of non-ferroan cement filling fractures are more negative when compared with that of ferroan cement filling fractures, which may be formed in shallow burial environments by formation water...|$|R
40|$|The Penedes half-graben {{represents}} a natural field laboratory {{for the study}} of the link between tectonics and palaeofluids because it exposes numerous outcrops that allow a global and complete diagenetic study of the basin from Mesozoic to present times. The Penedes half-graben is located in the central part of the Catalan Coastal Ranges (CCR) and results from the superposition of three main tectonic events: (1) the Mesozoic extensional phase which is divided into two Mesozoic rift episodes: the first, Late Permian to Triassic in age and the second, latest Oxfordian to Aptian in age; (2) the Paleocene to middle Oligocene compressional phase which includes the emplacement of ENE-to-NE-trending thick-skinned thrust sheets bounded by SE dipping thrusts with a limited left-lateral strike-slip motion; (3) the late Oligocene?- Neogene extensional phase which split the CCR into a set of ENE-WSW blocks mainly tilted toward the NW, constituting the actual horst-and-graben systems now present at the northwestern Mediterranean. Samples were taken in 19 different outcrop areas located within three main structural domains: the Gaia-Montmell domain, which represents the footwall block of the SE-dipping major normal faults that bound the north-western margin of the basin, the Central Penedes domain, which comprises the central Miocene syn- and post-rift deposits and the Garraf domain, which comprises a group of small syn-depositional tectonic horsts and half-grabens developed in the Garraf horst during its Neogene evolution. Based on the macro and microstructural analysis combined with geochemical results from host rocks, fault rocks and fracture cements, the following diagenetic events have been identified: (1) Very early stages characterized by micritization, early irregular micro-fractures resulting from opening in poorly-lithified sediments and early calcite cement precipitations; (2) Progressive burial stages characterized by brecciation, stylolization and dolomitization; (3) Fracturing and cementations characterized by ninth major deformation stages with their related cements, breccias and stylolites, and (4) four karstification events with associated collapse breccias, sediments and cements filling the fracture, <b>vug</b> and cavern <b>porosities.</b> A depositional control of the δ(18) O values of the syn-rift Mesozoic sediments (Valanginian, Barremian and Aptian) related to the position of the different outcrops with respect to the Mesozoic normal faults is inferred from the values reported in this study. The isotopic values of the Miocene marine facies, depleted in δ(18) O and δ(13) C respect to the expected values for the Miocene seawater, together with the chalky appearance of these limestones, indicate that the Miocene marine limestones were re-balanced under the meteoric diagenetic environment. The meteoric fluid precipitating the calcite cement in the conglomerates of the lower continental complexes was responsible for diagenetically altering the marine host limestone. A different meteoric fluid, more influenced by soil-derived CO 2, precipitated the calcite cement present within the upper continental complexes. The fluids circulating through the fractures attributed to the second stage of the Mesozoic rifting were precipitated from formation waters during the progressive burial of the sediment, in a closed palaeohydrological system. From the Paleocene to the mid-Oligocene the fluids circulating through the compressional fractures had a meteoric origin. Due to the Paleogene compression, Mesozoic rocks were uplifted, subaerially exposed and extensively karstified. Different types of sediments and cements were deposited filling the karstic cavities under the meteoric diagenetic environment. Related to the syn- and early post-rift stage, the fractures were sealed by meteoric fluids under both, phreatic and vadose zones. The normal faults attributed to the late post-rift stage favoured the upflowing of marine fluids expelled from the compaction of the late Burdigalian to the early Serravallian marine sediments producing the dolomitization of the host rocks and the precipitation of dolomite cements within the fractures. During the late post-rift and related to latest tensional fractures occurrence different types of meteoric fluids circulated through the fractures. These fluids were precipitated from phreatic to vadose cements, agreeing with the uplift of the entire basin and/or with the falling-down of the meteoric water table related to a generalized sea level fall in the Mediterranean area during the Messinian. La formació de la conca del Penedès està associada a un període extensiu d’edat neògena que provocà l’obertura del Solc de València. El marge nord-oest del Solc de València està constituït per una sèrie de grabens (Penedès, Vallès, Barcelona [...] .) i horsts (Garraf, Gaià-Montmell, Montnegre [...] .), el conjunt dels quals formen la Serralada Costanera Catalana. Aquesta serralada resulta de la superposició de tres esdeveniments tectònics principals: (1) l’extensió Mesozoica, compresa entre el Pèrmic i el Cretàcic inferior, (2) la compressió Paleògena, la qual produí la inversió de les principals conques extensives Mesozoiques i (3) l’extensió neògena, compresa entre l’Oligocè tardà i el Miocè mig, la qual generà l’actual sistema de rift de la Mediterrània occidental. S’han estudiat 19 afloraments localitzats tant en els alts estructurals, Garraf i Gaià-Montmell, com en el sector central de la conca del Penedès. A partir de les dades macro I microestructurals, juntament amb els resultats geoquímics de les roques encaixants, roques de falla i els ciments que reomplen les fractures, s’han identificat els següents estadis diagenètics: i. un primer estadi diagenètic temprà caracteritzat per la formació de microfractures de morfologies irregulars, formades en un sediment poc litificat i per la precipitació d’un ciment de calcita poc interaccionat amb la roca de caixa. ii. un segon estadi d’enterrament caracteritzat per la bretxificació i dolomitització de la roca encaixant i la generació d’estilòlits sub-paral•lels a l’estratificació. iii. nou etapes de deformació amb diferents tipus de rebliments associats a les fractures. iv. quatre estadis de carstificació caracteritzats per diferents tipus de bretxes de col•lapse, sediments i ciments que reomplen les porositats tipus fractura i vug, generades a partir de la dissolució. Els fluids relacionats amb l’extensió Mesozoica són característics d’aigües de formació, en canvi, els fluids que circularen al llarg de les fractures compressives paleògenes, són coherents amb fluids d’origen meteòric altament interaccionats amb la roca de caixa. L’extensió Neògena es caracteritza per una circulació predominant de fluids meteòrics no interaccionats amb la roca de caixa. És en l’estadi de post-rift on s’ha definit una dolomitització parcial de l’encaixant produïda per la barreja d’aigües marines i meteòriques.
