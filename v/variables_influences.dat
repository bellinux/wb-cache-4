40|$|Covariance {{matrices}} {{which can}} be arranged in tridiagonal form are called covariance chains. They are used to clarify some issues of parameter equivalence and of independence equivalence for linear models in which a set of latent <b>variables</b> <b>influences</b> a set of observed variables. For this purpose, orthogonal decompositions for covariance chains are derived first in explicit form. Covariance chains are also contrasted to concentration chains, for which estimation is explicit and simple. For this purpose, maximum-likelihood equations are derived first for exponential families when some parameters satisfy zero value constraints. From these equations explicit estimates are obtained, which are asymptotically efficient, and they are applied to covariance chains. Simulation results confirm the satisfactory behaviour of the explicit covariance chain estimates also in moderate-size sample...|$|E

We analyzed procedures according to three variables: motivational conditions, supplemental stimulation, and consequences. Individuals with severely limited verbal repertoires provide unique opportunities to study how each of these three variables influence the acquisition of requests. Our analysis indicated that several different procedures were effective in teaching requests, however the degree of supplemental stimulation for the requests varied greatly.

The findings show that dominant firms with bigger market shares are actively involved in granting technology licenses. It was also found that company's prior involvement in licensing, the concentration and the market size of its primary industry, and the propensity to receive patents (i. e. strength of the intellectual property protection) in that industry are important determinants of the propensity to transfer technology through licensing agreements. Results suggest that transaction costs, strategic considerations, and knowledge appropriability weigh in heavily in explaining firms' licensing behaviour. ...|$|E
