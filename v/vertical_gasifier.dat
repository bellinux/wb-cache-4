40|$|Fluid flow {{inside the}} <b>vertical</b> <b>gasifier</b> shaft having the {{granular}} porous phase has been numerically analyzed. The {{effect of the}} tilt angle of lances for air injection on the fluid flow has been studied. The distributions of the temperature, particles volume fraction and trajectory of particles motion inside the gasifier shaft have been obtained. The results clearly show an essential effect of the tilt angle of lances on fluid flow and heat transfer...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of temperature and heating rate on the yield and properties of biochar derived from pyrolysis of solid olive mill waste (pomace) was investigated. Three pyrolysis temperatures (430 ± 10 °C, 480 ± 10 °C and 530 ± 10 °C) and 3 heating rates (25 °C min− 1, 35 °C min− 1 and 45 °C min− 1) were studied. The biochar production {{was carried out}} using a <b>vertical</b> downdraft <b>gasifier.</b> Increasing the pyrolysis temperature, and/or the heating rate, the biochar yield lowered, the C content and biochar aromaticity increased and the surface functional groups were reduced. The highest biochar yield was obtained by low pyrolysis temperature (430 ± 10 °C) and low heating rate (25 °C min− 1). This biochar {{is characterized by a}} high heating value (31 MJ/kg) that makes it a possible fuel candidate and, in the meantime, due to its high concentration in C (70. 2 %– 84. 1 %), low electrical conductivity (0. 28 dS m− 1 – 0. 47 dS m− 1) and the lack of phytotoxicity it is suitable for amendment in agricultural soils and for long term carbon sequestration...|$|R
40|$|Soot {{concentration}} {{measurements were}} performed using diode-laser extinction in an atmospheric air-blown entrained flow <b>gasifier</b> at two <b>vertical</b> levels. The <b>gasifier</b> was operated at different air-fuel equivalence ratios and with variations in fuel and burner configurations. Two fuels were investigated: wood powder and peat powder. These were burned using two burner configurations, one giving a rotating flow inside the gasifier (swirl), and {{one where the}} fuel and air were injected parallel with the gasifier axis (jet). The diode-laser measurements were performed at the wavelength 808 nm from which the soot concentrations were estimated, and additionally at 450 nm {{in order to gain}} insight into the spectral dependence of the extinction to estimate measurement quality. Additional diagnostic techniques were used, such as an electrical low-pressure impactor (ELPI) for soot size distributions and gas chromatography for species concentration measurements. The results show that wood powder produces higher soot concentrations than peat powder, especially at lower air-fuel equivalence ratios. Furthermore, the burner configuration had in general much less impact than the choice of fuel on the soot concentration...|$|R
40|$|The role {{of biomass}} in {{energy and fuel}} {{production}} {{as an alternative to}} fossil fuel is vitally important considering carbon dioxide production vs. secure energy. Sustainable, renewable and reliable resources of domestically produced biomass together with wind and solar energy are sensible options to support a small-scale power generation to meet local electricity demand plus provide heat for rural development. The present work focuses on: 1. Design, build and operate a <b>vertical</b> downdraft biomass <b>gasifier</b> with tar removal 2. Establishing the optimum operating methodology and parameters to maximize syngas production in biomass gasification through process testing. The one ton per day biomass gasification process unit designed in this work included a downdraft biomass thermochemical conversion gasifier, gas transportation line with tar removal and an enclosed combustion chamber. The reactor used internal heat transfer surfaces to enhance intra-bed heat and mass transfer inside the reactor. Three different woody biomass feedstock including pellets, picks and flakes were examined in this work. Specific results described in this paper include identifying and characterizing the key operating factors (i. e., temperature profile, feed stock carbon/hydrogen mass ratio, and air flow rate) required to optimize reactor yield. To achieve the maximum syngas production yield, experiments carried out using classical experimental design methodology...|$|R
