40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} by computed tomography (CT) whether asbestosis, diffuse pleural thickening and/or <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> are statistically associated. We also tried to find criteria to differentiate between diffuse and circumscribed pleural thickening. From 231 exposed workers, only those subjects whose radiograph showed neither bilateral calcified <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> nor small pulmonary opacities higher than 1 / 1 grade according to the 1980 International Labour Office (ILO) Classification were considered. Scans were assessed for the presence of subpleural curvilinear lines, septal and intralobular lines, parenchymal bands, honeycombing, rounded atelectasis, <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> and diffuse <b>pleural</b> thickening. CT scans revealed pleural and/or lung abnormalities in 99 workers. <b>Pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> were unilateral in one-third of cases with <b>plaques.</b> Diffuse <b>pleural</b> thickening, parenchymal bands and rounded atelectasis were unilateral in, respectively, 62 and 69 and 75 % of cases with the abnormality. Septal and intralobular lines, and honeycombing were always bilateral. CT signs could be grouped into three patterns: 1) septal and intralobular lines, and honeycombing corresponding to pulmonary fibrosis; 2) <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> corresponding to parietal pleural fibrosis; and 3) diffuse pleural thickening, rounded atelectasis and parenchymal bands corresponding to <b>visceral</b> <b>pleural</b> fibrosis.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveVisceral pleural {{invasion}} {{caused by}} non–small cell lung {{cancer is a}} factor in the poor prognosis of patients with that disease. We investigated the relationship between the diagnosis of <b>visceral</b> <b>pleural</b> invasion by using a jet stream of saline solution, which was previously reported as a new cytologic method to more accurately detect the presence of <b>visceral</b> <b>pleural</b> invasion, and prognosis. MethodsFrom January 1992 through December 1998, 143 consecutive patients with peripheral non–small cell lung cancer that appeared to reach the visceral pleura underwent a surgical resection at the Department of Thoracic Oncology, National Kyushu Cancer Center. The surface of the visceral pleura in patients undergoing lung cancer resection was irrigated with a jet stream of saline solution. The diagnosis of <b>visceral</b> <b>pleural</b> invasion was determined by means of either a pathologic examination or by means of a jet stream of saline solution. In addition, a cytologic examination of the pleural lavage fluid obtained immediately after a thoracotomy was evaluated. ResultsForty-nine (34 %) resected tumors were identified as having <b>visceral</b> <b>pleural</b> invasion. The diagnosis of <b>visceral</b> <b>pleural</b> invasion in 31, 6, and 12 patients was determined by using a jet stream of saline solution alone, pathologic examination alone, or both, respectively. The <b>visceral</b> <b>pleural</b> invasion and positive findings of intrapleural lavage cytology were linked. Although {{there was no significant difference}} between the incidence of distant metastases in the patients with <b>visceral</b> <b>pleural</b> invasion and those without <b>visceral</b> <b>pleural</b> invasion, the incidence of local recurrence, especially regarding carcinomatous pleuritis (malignant pleural effusion, pleural dissemination, or both), in the patients with <b>visceral</b> <b>pleural</b> invasion was significantly higher than in those without <b>visceral</b> <b>pleural</b> invasion. The recurrence-free survival of patients with <b>visceral</b> <b>pleural</b> invasion was significantly shorter than that of patients without <b>visceral</b> <b>pleural</b> invasion (P =. 004), even patients with stage I disease (P =. 02). There was also a significant difference between the patients with or without <b>visceral</b> <b>pleural</b> invasion in the overall survival (P =. 02). <b>Visceral</b> <b>pleural</b> invasion was independently associated with a poor recurrence-free survival on the basis of multivariate analyses (P =. 03), as were sex (P =. 03), age (P = 002), and the stage of the disease (P <. 0001).

40|$|Lungs {{from seven}} cases of diffuse pleural {{fibrosis}} with known asbestos exposure were studied {{to determine the}} gross and microscopic pathological features and relate these to the analysed mineral fibre content of the lung. All seven individuals had had substantial exposure, ranging from two to 25 years, and chronic chest problems and at necropsy all cases met the criteria for compensatable disease. Macroscopically, all had extensive <b>visceral</b> <b>pleural</b> fibrosis and extensive areas of adhesions, and four also had discrete parietal <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques.</b> The histological features were similar in all the cases [...] most strikingly the basket weave pattern of the thickened pleura and a dense subpleural parenchymal interstitial fibrosis with fine honeycombing, extending up to 1 cm into the underlying lung. The similar histological appearances raise the possibility that diffuse pleural fibrosis and <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> have a similar pathogenesis. Amphibole asbestos (crocidolite and amosite) counts were high in six of the seven cases and chrysotile counts in four; four cases had high mullite counts, but {{the importance of this}} is not known. It is concluded that diffuse pleural fibrosis is a specific asbestos associated entity, of uncertain pathogenesis, with mineral fibre counts falling between those found with plaques and those in minimal asbestosis...|$|R
40|$|IntroductionMalignant pleural {{mesothelioma}} (MPM) is an aggressive malignancy arising from mesothelial cells lining the pleura. Most commonly, it presents as a unilateral pleural effusion. MPM usually develops on the parietal pleural surface and later spreads to the <b>visceral</b> pleura. <b>Visceral</b> <b>pleural</b> involvement entails {{a more advanced}} disease stage and is therefore an important prognostic factor. Pleural fluid (PF) cytology is often the first diagnostic test, but the sensitivity in the literature varies from 4 to 77 %. However, no data are available for the diagnostic yield of cytological PF analysis {{with regard to the}} <b>visceral</b> <b>pleural</b> involvement. The aim {{of this study is to}} assess whether PF cytological yield is related to the extent and pattern of <b>visceral</b> <b>pleural</b> invasion, as assessed by thoracoscopy. MethodsMedical records of all patients who underwent thoracoscopy for suspicion of malignant pleural effusion from two hospitals were reviewed. Patients were selected if they initially underwent a diagnostic thoracentesis before thoracoscopy, if <b>visceral</b> <b>pleural</b> appearance during thoracoscopy was clearly documented, and MPM confirmed on pleural tissue biopsy. ResultsSeventy-five patients were selected. Forty-five patients had a positive PF cytology on thoracentesis, while 30 had a negative PF cytology. Thoracoscopy showed parietal pleural invasion in all subjects. Interestingly, 82 % of patients with positive PF cytology on thoracentesis had <b>visceral</b> <b>pleural</b> involvement, whereas only 30 % of those with negative PF cytology had <b>visceral</b> <b>pleural</b> invasion. The pattern of <b>visceral</b> <b>pleural</b> invasion consisted of pleural masses, nodules, or pleural thickening. A multivariate regression identified <b>visceral</b> <b>pleural</b> invasion (p < 0. 001) as the only independent factor predicting the positivity of cytology on pleural effusion.

40|$|ObjectiveAlthough <b>visceral</b> <b>pleural</b> {{invasion}} by {{non-small cell lung cancer}} {{is considered a}} poor-prognostic factor, further information is lacking, especially in relation to other clinicopathologic prognostic factors. We assessed the relationship between <b>visceral</b> <b>pleural</b> invasion and other clinicopathologic characteristics and evaluated its significance as a prognostic factor. MethodsWe reviewed 1074 patients with surgically resected T 1 / 2 non-small cell lung cancer for their clinicopathologic characteristics and prognoses. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to <b>visceral</b> <b>pleural</b> invasion status (<b>visceral</b> <b>pleural</b> invasion group and non-visceral pleural invasion group). Both groups were compared with regard to age, sex, histology, tumor size, tumor differentiation, lymph node involvement, lymphatic invasion, vascular invasion, scar grade, nuclear atypia, mitotic index, serum carcinoembryonic antigen level, and survival. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted. ResultsVisceral pleural invasion was identified in 288 (26. 8 %) of the resected specimens. Survival was 76. 0 % at 5 years and 53. 2 % at 10 years in the non-visceral pleural invasion group and was 49. 8 % at 5 years and 37. 0 % at 10 years in the <b>visceral</b> <b>pleural</b> invasion group. The difference between groups was highly significant (P <. 0001). <b>Visceral</b> <b>pleural</b> invasion was also significantly associated with a higher frequency of lymph node involvement. However, regardless of N status (N 0 or N 1 / 2), {{there was a significant difference}} in survival when the visceral pleura was invaded. <b>Visceral</b> <b>pleural</b> invasion was observed significantly more frequently in tumors with factors indicative of tumor aggressiveness/invasiveness: moderate/poor differentiation, lymphatic invasion, vascular invasion, high scar grade, high nuclear atypia grade, high mitotic index, and high serum carcinoembryonic antigen level. By multivariate analysis, <b>visceral</b> <b>pleural</b> invasion proved to be a significant independent predictor of poor prognosis in non-small-cell lung cancer patients with or without lymph node involvement.

50|$|No {{treatment}} is required since <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> are benign. However, {{studies have demonstrated}} that <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> are an independent risk factor for developing bronchogenic carcinoma and/or mesothelioma.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> are {{the most}} common manifestation of {{asbestos}} exposure, affecting up to 58% of asbestos-exposed workers. The prevalence among the general population exposed environmentally ranges from 0.53 to 8%. <b>Pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> are discrete circumscribed areas of hyaline fibrosis (patches of thickening) of the parietal pleura and rarely the visceral pleura that develop 20 to 40 years after first exposure. Over time, usually more than 30 years, they often become partly calcified. They consist of mature collagen fibers arranged in an open basket-weave pattern and are covered by flattened or cuboidal mesothelial cells. They have a white or pale yellow shaggy appearance and are typically distributed on the posterolateral chest wall, diaphragm, and mediastinal pleura. The number and size varies. <b>Pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> are typically asymptomatic, however, there is still some controversy on this topic. An association between <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> and chest pain has been reported, but this has not been confirmed in more recent studies. Similarly, an association between <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> and a restrictive impairment with diminished diffusing capacity on pulmonary function testing has been described. This has not been a consistent finding and it has been postulated that this might be related to undetected early fibrosis. The pathogenesis of <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> remains uncertain. The most likely explanation is that asbestos fibres reach the parietal pleura by passage through lymphatic channels where they excite an inflammatory reaction. The chest X-ray is the usual tool for diagnosing <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> but chest CT scan is more sensitive and specific in this regard. <b>Pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> are evidence of past asbestos exposure and indicate an increased risk for the future development of other asbestos-related diseases. <b>Pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> in themselves are not pre-malignant. Individuals with <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> are usually not compensated in most compensation systems.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To assess airflow {{limitation}} in workers exposed long term to metal dust, {{the prevalence of}} <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> in those workers exposed {{in the past to}} asbestos, the influence of <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> on lung function, and the possible association with airway disease caused by asbestos. METHODS [...] A cross sectional and longitudinal (seven year) survey of 494 long term (mean (SEM) 21 (1) years) workers in a copper refinery was carried out from medical questionnaires, chest radiographs, and forced spirometry. RESULTS [...] The prevalence of lifetime non-smokers was 19 %, current smokers 39 %, and ex-smokers 42 %. The prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD) (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) 0. 05). In the smokers and ex-smokers with COPD, the loss of FEV 1 was 53 (10) (P < 0. 02). The prevalence of <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> was 11 % (P < 0. 0001); <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> were found in older workers with known exposure to asbestos. The <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> were circumscribed and associated with a non-significant 196 ml reduction in forced vital capacity (FVC) and non-significant reduction of FVC over time. The <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> were not associated with COPD or SAD. The cumulative smoking index obtained by a technician did not differ from that by a chest physician. CONCLUSIONS [...] Despite exposures to asbestos that produced <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> and exposures to metal dusts and foundry fumes the long term workers of this plant did not have excessive prevalence of COPD or SAD. The data suggest that low level long term exposure to metal dusts, gases, and foundry fumes do not necessarily cause respiratory dysfunction, circumscribed <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> with low grades of width and extent do not reduce FVC significantly, and exposure to asbestos dust that produced <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> does not necessarily produce airway dysfunction...|$|R

Few reports have evaluated {{the correlation between}} N 1 disease and tumor recurrence or which subgroup of patients would most benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. MethodsFrom 1997 through 2002, all patients with pathologic T 1 - 4 N 1 M 0 non–small cell lung cancer who had a complete resection with systematic mediastinal lymphadenectomy were retrospectively analyzed and evaluated for factors associated with recurrence and long-term survival. ResultsOne hundred eighty patients with N 1 disease were evaluated. Sixty-six (37 %) patients had either locoregional recurrence (n = 39 [22 %]), distant metastasis (n = 41 [23 %]), or both during follow-up. Univariate analysis demonstrated that <b>visceral</b> <b>pleural</b> invasion and age were associated with locoregional recurrence, whereas <b>visceral</b> <b>pleural</b> invasion, distinct N 1 metastasis (as opposed to direct N 1 invasion by the primary tumor), and multistation lymph node involvement were associated with distant metastasis (P <. 05). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that <b>visceral</b> <b>pleural</b> invasion, multistation N 1 involvement, and distinct N 1 metastasis were the only independent predisposing factors for locoregional recurrence and distant metastasis. Overall 5 -year survival was 42. 5 %.

The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate the significance of the extent of pleural involvement as a prognostic factor and to propose a refined TNM classification on the basis of <b>visceral</b> <b>pleural</b> invasion. MethodsWe reviewed 1653 consecutive patients with T 1, T 2, and T 3 surgically resected non–small cell lung cancer for their clinicopathologic characteristics and prognoses. <b>Visceral</b> <b>pleural</b> invasion was classified by using the Japan Lung Cancer Society criteria: p 0, tumor with no pleural involvement beyond its elastic layer; p 1, tumor extension beyond the elastic layer but no exposure on the pleural surface; and p 2, tumor exposure on the pleural surface.

Patients with p 1 or p 2 tumors of greater than 3 cm and patients with T 3 cancers had essentially identical survivals. ConclusionsVisceral pleural invasion should be defined as tumor extension beyond the elastic layer of the visceral pleura, regardless of its exposure on the pleural surface.

Objective: We conducted a systematic review to evaluate whether there is an association between <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> and lung function and ascertain whether results were dependent on the method used to identify plaques. Methods: Using the PubMed database, we identified studies that evaluated <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> and lung function. We assessed each study for quality, then integrated evidence and assessed associations based on the Bradford Hill guidelines. We also compared the results of HRCT studies to those of X-ray studies. Results: We identified 16 HRCT and 36 X-ray studies. We rated six HRCT and 16 X-ray studies as higher quality based on a risk-of-bias analysis. Half of the higher quality studies reported small but statistically significant mean lung function decrements associated with plaques. None of the differences were clinically significant. Many studies had limitations, such as inappropriate controls and/or insufficient adjustment for confounders. There was little consistency in the direction of effect for the most commonly reported measurements.

40|$|Endemic <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> are {{reported}} from {{many parts of}} the world. In Central Europe and in Finland no connection with malignant mesotheliomas has been found, whereas this tumour is often encountered in areas in Turkey where endemic plaques also occur. There seem, however, to be differences in the radiological appearances found in these areas. In the present study chest radiographs of 317 persons with <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> from the endemic area of Finland were scrutinized. It was found that 4. 7 % showed a blunted costophrenic angle unilaterally and 0. 9 % bilaterally. The prevalence of sequelae of pleurisy is statistically very highly significantly lower than in people with <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> in Turkey. As the risk of mesothelioma appears to be low in Finland, the results are in accordance with the hypothesis that the risk of mesothelioma in a given population is higher if in that population there is a high incidence of benign asbestos pleurisy...|$|R
40|$|Four {{patients}} with asbestos-related diseases and with unusual exposures underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for mineralogical analysis. Asbestos bodies (AB) were counted by light microscopy and analyzed by {{transmission electron microscopy}} and X-ray energy spectrometry. AB's were found in all cases, after a mean delay {{from the end of}} exposure of 27. 7 years. Analysis of the core fibers indicated the type of alveolar asbestos burden and was compared with the previous exposures: <b>Pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> due to household exposure to amosite and crocidolite. <b>Pleural</b> <b>plaques</b> due to occult occupational exposure to crocidolite in a coal miner. Asbestosis due to environmental exposure to tremolite in Turkey. Asbestosis, <b>pleural</b> <b>plaques,</b> and peritoneal mesothelioma due to a short, intense exposure to crocidolite. AB counting in BAL and identification of the central fibers by analytical electron microscopy is a useful, non-invasive and reliable method to evaluate the alveolar retention of bio-persistent fibers and to relate them to specific exposures.
