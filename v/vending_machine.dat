40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{evaluated}} {{the usefulness of}} <b>vending</b> <b>machines</b> in providing injection drug users with access to sterile syringes in Marseille, France. METHODS: Self-administered questionnaires were offered to 485 injection drug users obtaining syringes from 32 pharmacies, 4 needle exchange programs, and 3 <b>vending</b> <b>machines.</b> RESULTS: Of the 343 respondents (response rate = 70. 7 %), 21. 3 % used the <b>vending</b> <b>machines</b> as their primary source of syringes. Primary users of <b>vending</b> <b>machines</b> {{were more likely than}} primary users of other sources to be younger than 30 years, to report no history of drug maintenance treatment, and to report no sharing of needles or injection paraphernalia. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Vending</b> <b>machines</b> may be an appropriate strategy for providing access to syringes for younger injection drug users, who have typically avoided needle exchange programs and pharmacies...|$|R

5|$|In September 2015 at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, {{students}} and entrepreneurs presented a fully automatic, prototype <b>vending</b> <b>machine</b> that cooks frozen potato strips by deep frying them.
