To cater {{to the needs of}} thousands who watched the Indian channels with regularity, programmes were broadcast to match the Indian content. Seeing this as an opportunity, bands returned on the music scene and started producing videos with a much richer content. In 2002-03, Ghazanfar Ali, producer and CEO of the Indus Media Group started his very first venture into the music industry with Indus Music, a channel dedicated to music {{following the}} formats used by Western Music Channels. The channel started {{as a part of the}} Indus <b>Vision</b> <b>channel</b> and was later started as separate channel in 2003. With nothing much to watch than a few Pakistani channels, the youngsters in the country would settle in for Indus Music and would become interested in music once again. In 2006 Indus TV Network in an agreement with MTV Intn;l converted Indus Music into MTV Pakistan which continued till 2011 to again become Indus Music.|$|E

40|$|Stereo image {{matching}} is {{the central}} issue in stereo vision, and is the most robust and domain-independent way of reconstructing object surfaces from perspective images among various <b>vision</b> <b>channels</b> such as shape from shading, texture, contours, focus etc. Disparity discontinuity and occlusions are the major causes of difficulties in stereo image matching. We use the fact that Gabor phase is a stable feature of a signal, and it is ubiquitous and thus {{can be used as}} the basis for uniform matching through scale space. The use of Gabor-like complex wavelets facilitates the transformation of images to Gabor-phase-based feature pyramids. Through perspective geometry, we show that occlusions are the direct cause of the discontinuity of disparity field, and bidirectional matching is required to detect disparity discontinuities and occlusions in both views. A global objective function is established under the maximum a posteriori probability criterion and equivalently transformed into minimum des [...] ...|$|R
