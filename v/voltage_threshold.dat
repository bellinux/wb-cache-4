40|$|Abstract — A system level {{approach}} for a memory power reduction is proposed in this paper. The basic idea is allocatingfrequently executed object codes {{into a small}} subprogram memory and optimizing supply <b>voltage</b> and <b>threshold</b> <b>voltage</b> of the subprogram memory. Since large scale memory contains a lot of direct paths from power supply to ground, power dissipation caused by subthreshold leakage current is more serious than dynamic power dissipation. Our approach optimizes the size of subprogram memory, supply <b>voltage,</b> and <b>threshold</b> <b>voltage</b> so as to minimize memory power dissipation includingstatic power dissipation caused by leakage current. A heuristic algorithm which determines code allocation, supply <b>voltage,</b> and <b>threshold</b> <b>voltage</b> simultaneously so as to minimize power dissipation of memories is proposed as well.

In future CMOS technology generations, supply and <b>threshold</b> <b>voltages</b> will have to continually scale to sustain performance increase, limit energy consumption, control power dissipation, and maintain reliability. These continual scaling requirements on supply and <b>threshold</b> <b>voltages</b> pose several technology and circuit design challenges. One such challenge is the expected increase in <b>threshold</b> <b>voltage</b> variation due to worsening short channel effect. This thesis will address three specific circuit design challenges arising from increased <b>threshold</b> <b>voltage</b> variation and present prospective solutions.
