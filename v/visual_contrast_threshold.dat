40|$|It {{is known}} that {{transcranial}} magnetic stimulation (TMS) administered over the occipital pole suppresses recognition of visual objects. Our aim was to ascertain whether this suppression {{can be interpreted as}} a change in <b>visual</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>threshold.</b> Four subjects detected the orientation of an U- shaped hook flashed for 21 ms. Under control conditions, mean contrast threshold was found at 0. 88 log units Weber contrast. Thresholds were raised if TMS was applied 40 - 200 ms after the visual stimulus. Maximum elevation was 1. 67 log units under TMS at 120 ms stimulus onset asynchrony. This phenomenon can be interpreted as a reduction in signal-to-noise ratio of the visual stimuli by TMS, which can be compensated for by increasing the contrast of the stimuli.

Binocular visual {{thresholds}} for {{targets of}} several sizes and occupying various {{positions in the}} visual field have been measured at photopic adaptation luminance. Circular targets of positive contrast were presented for 0. 33 second, chosen as a duration typical of the dwell times used in normal visual search procedures. Four young male observers with normal vision were used as subjects for the experiment.

40|$|Current {{models of}} attention, {{typically}} claim that vision and audition {{are limited by}} a common attentional resource which means that visual performance should be adversely affected by a concurrent auditory task and vice versa. Here, we test this implication by measuring auditory (pitch) and <b>visual</b> (<b>contrast)</b> <b>thresholds</b> in conjunction with cross-modal secondary tasks and find that no such interference occurs. <b>Visual</b> <b>contrast</b> discrimination <b>thresholds</b> were unaffected by a concurrent chord or pitch discrimination, and pitchdiscrimination thresholds were virtually unaffected by a concurrent <b>visual</b> search or <b>contrast</b> discrimination task. However, if the dual tasks were presented within the same modality, thresholds were raised {{by a factor of}} between two (for visual discrimination) and four (for auditory discrimination). These results suggest that at least for low-level tasks such as discriminations of pitch and contrast, each sensory modality is under separate attentional control, rather than being limited by a supramodal attentional resource. This has implications for current theories of attention {{as well as for the}} use of multi-sensory media for efficient informational transmission. 1...|$|R

40|$|Learning new {{information}} requires practice. The degree of learning can {{be influenced by}} the amount of practice and whether subjects sleep between sessions. Over-practice, however, can lead to performance deterioration. The interaction between practice-dependent deterioration and sleep-dependent learning needs more study. We examine whether the amount of practice before sleep alters learning, and whether prior sleep protects against deterioration. Two groups (N � 33) were tested three times across two days on an orientation discrimination task. The High practice group was tested twice before a night of sleep and once after, at 9 a. m., 7 p. m., and 9 a. m. The Low practice group was tested once before a night of sleep and twice after, at 7 p. m., 9 a. m., and 7 p. m. Overall, both groups showed (1) deterioration with repeated, within-day testing, (2) performance improvement only after a night of sleep, (3) similar amounts of sleep-dependent learning and practice-dependent deterioration. In summary, we found that sleep resets <b>visual</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>thresholds</b> to a lower baseline (i. e., produces learning), but does not prevent over-practice deterioration effects. Likewise, over-practice deterioration does not influence the magnitude of overnight learning on this task...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} a transient complete ischemia on the function of cat retina and to determine whether nerve growth factor (NGF), which was previously shown to enhance retinal ganglion cell (RGC) survival after optic nerve section in the adult rat, can promote recovery of retinal neurons after the ischemic insult. Methods. Function of distal and proximal retina was assessed by recording the electroretinogram in response to both homogenous flickering light (FERG) and contrast reversing gratings (PERG), respectively, 30 days after the induction of a 60 -minute episode of ischemia. Visual evoked potentials in response to contrast reversing gratings were also recorded to evaluate <b>visual</b> acuity and <b>contrast</b> <b>thresholds.</b> Cell survival after ischemia was assessed in retinal wholemounts stained with cresyl violet.

40|$|An {{influential}} {{theory of}} dyslexia {{is based on}} the premise that individuals with the disorder have impaired sensitivity to rapidly changing stimuli in the visual and auditory modalities, due to a dysfunction in the magnocellular channel of the visual system and its analogue in the auditory pathway. The deficit in the auditory system is thought to cause difficulties in the segmentation of speech and the formation of accurate phonological representations, leading to problems in making the grapheme-phoneme correspondences necessary for reading. In a sample of 13 adults with a history of severe reading difficulty and 18 controls, <b>visual</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>thresholds</b> were measured in response to an 8 -Hz flickering Gaussian blob as well as a slowly modulated 8 cycles/deg Gaussian windowed grating. Auditory thresholds were measured in response to a 4 -s burst of white noise, the 2 nd or 3 rd second of which was amplitude modulated at 100 Hz or 1 Hz. The adult reading difficulty group exhibited normal thresholds to rapidly changing stimuli in both modalities and to the slowly modulated visual stimulus, but some showed reduced sensitivity to the 1 -Hz amplitude-modulated auditory stimulus. Sensitivity to amplitude modulation at slower rates has been shown to be important for segmentation of the speech stream and so may be implicated in the reading difficulty of the affected individuals. A magnocellular deficit cannot explain this impaired sensitivity, which may be the result of a reduced echoic memory span. 15 page(s...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the relationship between}} psychometrically-defined schizotypy {{and the ability to}} detect a visual target pattern. Target detection is typically impaired by a surrounding pattern (context) with an orientation that is parallel to the target, relative to a surrounding pattern with an orientation that is orthogonal to the target (orientation-dependent contextual modulation). Based on reports that this effect is reduced in those with schizophrenia, we hypothesised {{that there would be a}} negative relationship between the relative score on psychometrically-defined schizotypy and the relative effect of orientation-dependent contextual modulation. We measured <b>visual</b> <b>contrast</b> detection <b>thresholds</b> and scores on the Oxford-Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experiences (O-LIFE) from a non-clinical sample (N = 100). Contrary to our hypothesis, we find an absence of a monotonic relationship between the relative magnitude of orientation-dependent contextual modulation of <b>visual</b> <b>contrast</b> detection and the relative score on any of the subscales of the O-LIFE. The apparent difference of this result with previous reports on those with schizophrenia suggests that orientation-dependent contextual modulation may be an informative condition in which schizophrenia and psychometrically-defined schizotypy are dissociated. However, further research is also required to clarify the strength of orientation-dependent contextual modulation in those with schizophrenia...|$|R

However, {{a description of the}} basic properties of the visual performance of the wild type mouse is still lacking. To characterize the visual physiology of the wild type (C 57 BL/ 6 J) mouse we recorded Visual Evoked Potentials (VEPs) from the primary visual cortex. As compared to behavioral methods, VEPs may have the advantage that different aspects of vision can be screened readily and simultaneously in the same animals, including those with poor visual behavior due to motor or learning deficits. Local VEP responses to patterned visual stimuli have been recorded from the binocular visual cortex of anesthetized mice. Spatial (<b>visual</b> acuity, <b>contrast</b> <b>threshold)</b> and temporal (temporal function, response latency, motion sensitivity) aspects of VEPs were evaluated. The mouse VEP acuity was 0. 6 c/deg, which is comparable to the behavioral visual acuity. The VEP peak <b>contrast</b> <b>threshold</b> was 5 % (no behavioral data are available). Cortical representation of visual coordinates and cortical magnification factor corresponded to those previously reported using single cell recordings. Laminar analysis of VEPs indicated a dipole source in the supragranular layers of the visual cortex as a major response generator. VEPs showed contribution from both eyes, although biased strongly towards the eye contralateral to the recorded cortex.

A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) applied to the linear <b>contrast</b> <b>threshold</b> showed signifcant differences between groups (F[3, 188] = 14. 829; p <. 05).

The largest difference between groups was in the lowest spatial frequency. Therefore, epilepsy may cause more damage to the neural pathways that process low spatial frequencies.

40|$|Background: We {{develop the}} logic for a {{stimulus}} that can evaluate cone-dependent spatial summation and detail the modelling {{and interpretation of}} thresholds obtained with this stimulus. Methods: Fifteen observers participated, including two young normals tested extensively in control experiments, and a clinical trial based on four observers with age related macular degeneration (AMD), four age-similar controls and five young observers. Monocular spatial summation functions were measured with contrast-modulated Gabor targets that approximated the optimal <b>visual</b> <b>contrast</b> detector. <b>Thresholds</b> were returned from a yes/no adaptive psychophysical algorithm. By fine titration along the size domain it was demonstrated that the spatial summation of normal observers can be adequately described by a two-component model. A reduced set of variables are proposed for clinical applications and the model was applied to data derived using these variables in persons with AMD and age-similar controls. Results: We do not find a significant age-related loss of contrast sensitivity in our normal group.

Summation curves were similar across different spatial meridians, but the extent of spatial summation increased with retinal eccentricity consistent with previous reports. The size of the stimulus was also shown to affect <b>contrast</b> detection <b>thresholds</b> in the periphery. In particular, <b>contrast</b> detection <b>thresholds</b> decreased more rapidly with increasing eccentricity for a smaller target than a larger one. This difference in performance is accounted for by the accompanying change in Ac with eccentricity. In Experiment 2, we show that spatial uncertainty affected contrast detection, particularly at eccentric locations greater than 5 °, such that cueing the location of the stimulus improved <b>contrast</b> <b>thresholds.</b> Spatial uncertainty improved overall performance but did not affect the estimates of the critical areas of summation. The results of the present study indicate that, due to spatial summation, detection performance is highly dependent on the size of the stimulus, its eccentric location, and spatial uncertainty.

These studies, and a critical review of published reports, suggest that in clinical practice antimalarial drugs can be administered safely to patients with rheumatoid arthritis without the need for repetitive routine examination by an ophthalmologist or the use of complicated physiological tests.

40|$|Processing natural scenes {{requires}} the visual system to integrate local features into global object descriptions. To achieve coherent representations, {{the human brain}} uses statistical dependencies to guide weighting of local feature conjunctions. Pairwise interactions among feature detectors in early visual areas may form the early substrate of these local feature bindings. To investigate local interaction structures in visual cortex, we combined psychophysical experiments with computational modeling and natural scene analysis. We first measured <b>contrast</b> <b>thresholds</b> for 2 x 2 grating patch arrangements (plaids), which differed in spatial frequency composition (low, high or mixed), number of grating patch co-alignments (0, 1 or 2), and inter-patch distances (1 ° and 2 ° of <b>visual</b> angle). <b>Contrast</b> <b>thresholds</b> for the different configurations were compared {{to the prediction of}} probability summation (PS) among detector families tuned to the four retinal positions. For 1 ° distance the thresholds for all configurations were larger than predicted by PS, indicating inhibitory interactions. For 2 ° distance, thresholds were significantly lower compared to PS when the plaids were homogeneous in spatial frequency and orientation, but not when spatial frequencies were mixed or there was at least one misalignment. Next, we constructed a neural population model with horizontal laminar structure, which reproduced the detection thresholds after adaptation of connection weights. Consistent with prior work, contextual interactions were medium-range inhibition and long-range, orientation-specific excitation. However, inclusion of orientation-specific, inhibitory interactions between populations with different spatial frequency preferences were crucial for explaining detection thresholds. Finally, for all plaid configurations we computed their likelihood of occurrence in natural images. The likelihoods turned out to be inversely related to the detection thresholds obtained at larger inter-patch distances. However, likelihoods were almost independent of inter-patch distance, implying that natural image statistics could not explain the crowding-like results at short distances. This failure of natural image statistics to resolve the patch distance modulation of plaid visibility remains a challenge to the approach...|$|R

Extending an earlier work (Ooi & He, 2001) that measured global SED within the central 6 °, {{the current study}} measured SED locally at 17 locations within the central 8 ° of the binocular visual field. The eccentricities (radius) chosen for this, “binocular perimetry”, study were 0 ° (fovea), 2 ° and 4 °. At each eccentricity, eight concentric locations (polar angle: 0 °, 45 °, 90 °, 135 °, 180 °, 225 °, 270 °, and 315 °) were tested. The outcome, an SED map, sets up comparison between local SED and other <b>visual</b> functions [monocular <b>contrast</b> <b>threshold,</b> binocular disparity threshold, reaction time to detect depth, the dynamics of binocular rivalry and motor eye dominance]. Our analysis shows that an observer’s SED varies gradually across the binocular visual field both in its sign and magnitude. The strong eye channel revealed in the SED measurement does not always have a lower monocular <b>contrast</b> <b>threshold,</b> and {{does not need to}} be the motor dominant eye. There exists significant correlation between SED and binocular disparity threshold, and between SED and the response time to detect depth of a random-dot stereogram. A significant correlation is also found between SED and the eye that predominates when viewing an extended duration binocular rivalry stimulus. While it is difficult to attribute casual factors based on correlation analyses, these observations agree with the notion that an imbalance of interocular inhibition, which is largely revealed as SED, is a significant factor impeding binocular visual perception...|$|R

The hypothesis is that the parameters chosen will have an impact on the measured <b>visual</b> acuity, <b>contrast</b> <b>threshold</b> and on the number of viable sVEP plots. Methods: The Power Diva software, Version 1. 9 was used for this study. Five gold cup active electrodes, one reference electrode and one ground electrode were used to measure the Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Six adult participants (aged 17 to 35 years), with corrected to normal visual acuity and no history of ocular disease took part in each experiment, except for the repeatability experiment in which 3 subjects participated. Four criteria for regression line fitting were compared. Psychophysical thresholds were used to validate the sVEP measures for the different criterion and repeatability of sVEP was estimated for 10 sessions. The effect of luminance (25 cd/m 2, 50 cd/m 2, 100 cd/m 2), electrode placement (Power Diva and ISCEV), temporal frequency (6 Hz, 7. 5 Hz, 10 Hz), sweep direction, fixation target and stimulus area were investigated. A repeated measure ANOVA statistical method was used to analyze the average threshold and the number of viable plots out of five active channels for all subjects. Results: Criterion 2 and 3 gave better <b>visual</b> acuity, higher <b>contrast</b> sensitivity, better repeatability and gave results that were closer to the psychophysical threshold than criterion 0 and 1. Luminance of 25 cd/m 2 gave significantly fewer viable readings than 50 and 100 cd/m 2 while measuring visual acuity (F = 5. 11, df = 2, p = 0. 0295). Temporal frequency of 7. 5 Hz gave significantly more viable readings than 6 and 10 Hz while measuring visual acuity (F = 50. 53, df = 2, p 1; C 3 – similar to criterion 2, but the threshold should be within sweep range used), luminance of 50 or 100 cd/m 2, either Power Diva (PD) or International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision (ISCEV) electrode placement, temporal frequency of 7. 5 Hz, either sweep direction, measurement with the central fixation target, larger stimulus area...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background There is a {{considerable}} body of literature which indicates that <b>contrast</b> <b>thresholds</b> {{for the detection of}} sinusoidal grating patterns are abnormally high in glaucoma, though just how these elevations are related to the location of visual field loss remains unknown. Our aim, therefore, has been to determine the relationship between <b>contrast</b> <b>threshold</b> elevation and <b>visual</b> field loss in corresponding regions of the peripheral visual field in glaucoma patients. Methods <b>Contrast</b> <b>thresholds</b> were measured in arcuate regions of the superior, inferior, nasal and temporal visual field in response to laser interference fringes presented in the Maxwellian view. The display consisted of vertical green stationary laser interference fringes of spatial frequency 1. 0 c deg - 1 which appeared in a rotatable viewing area {{in the form of a}} truncated quadrant extending from 10 to 20 ° from fixation which was marked with a central fixation light. Results were obtained from 36 normal control subjects in order to provide a normal reference for 21 glaucoma patients and 5 OHT (ocular hypertensive) patients for whom full clinical data, including Friedmann visual fields, had been obtained. Results Abnormally high <b>contrast</b> <b>thresholds</b> were identified in 20 out of 21 glaucoma patients and in 2 out of 5 OHT patients when compared with the 95 % upper prediction limit for normal values from one eye of the 36 normal age-matched control subjects. Additionally, inter-ocular differences in <b>contrast</b> <b>threshold</b> were also abnormally high in 18 out of 20 glaucoma patients who had vision in both eyes compared with the 95 % upper prediction limit. Correspondence between abnormally high <b>contrast</b> <b>thresholds</b> and <b>visual</b> field loss in the truncated quadrants was significant in 5 patients, borderline in 4 patients and absent in 9 patients. Conclusion While the glaucoma patients tested in our study invariably had abnormally high <b>contrast</b> <b>thresholds</b> in one or more of the truncated quadrants in at least one eye, reasonable correspondence with the location of the visual field loss only occurred in half the patients studied. Hence, while <b>contrast</b> <b>threshold</b> elevations are indicative of glaucomatous damage to vision, they are providing a different assessment of visual function from conventional visual field tests. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Stochastic {{resonance}} is a nonlinear phenomenon {{whereby the}} addition of noise can improve the detection of weak stimuli. An optimal amount of added noise results in the maximum enhancement, whereas further increases in noise intensity only degrade detection or information content. The phenomenon does not occur in linear systems, where {{the addition of}} noise to either the system or the stimulus only degrades the signal quality. Stochastic Resonance (SR) has been extensively studied in different physical systems. It has been extended to human sensory systems {{where it can be}} classified as unimodal, central, behavioral and recently crossmodal. However what has not been explored is the extension of this crossmodal SR in humans. For instance, if under the same auditory noise conditions the crossmodal SR persists among different sensory systems. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using physiological and psychophysical techniques we demonstrate that the same auditory noise can enhance the sensitivity of tactile, visual and propioceptive system responses to weak signals. Specifically, we show that the effective auditory noise significantly increased tactile sensations of the finger, decreased luminance and <b>contrast</b> <b>visual</b> <b>thresholds</b> and significantly changed EMG recordings of the leg muscles during posture maintenance. Conclusions/Significance: We conclude that crossmodal SR is a ubiquitous phenomenon in humans that can be interpreted within an energy and frequency model of multisensory neurons spontaneous activity.

Contrast sensitivity is the reciprocal of contrast threshold; higher sensitivity is better. Poor overall contrast sensitivity would increase a client’s problems with glare, and decrease reading performance with low contrast materials like newspapers, or currency. Very poor overall contrast sensitivity would slow reading of even the highest contrast magnified print and indicate {{the need for a}} CCTV or non-visual devices. We have reviewed 4 experiments that related contrast sensitivity to reading performance in normally sighted and low vision observers. Our conclusions are that 1) letter contrast sensitivity charts are easier to administer and more predictive of reading performance than grating charts. Letter size may be varied by varying chart distance. 2) Letter contrast less than 10 times <b>contrast</b> <b>threshold</b> will reduce reading rate: Letter contrast less than 4 times <b>contrast</b> <b>threshold</b> will significantly impair reading rate and accuracy.

40|$|Purpose: There {{is little}} {{agreement}} on {{the age at which}} visual acuity (VA) and contrast sensitivity (CS) become adult-like. The ultimate purpose of this thesis was to determine whether VA and CS are adult-like at the age of 6 - 8 or 9 - 12 years by using both objective and subjective methods in the same individuals. The objective method (sweep visually evoked potentials [sVEP]) has many parameters that may affect the measurement of VA or CS and previously these had not been studied systematically, especially in children. Therefore, a second purpose was to study the effects of these parameters on VA and <b>contrast</b> <b>thresholds</b> and to determine the parameters that give the most repeatable measurements and the greatest number of viable readings in children, to be compared to previous data obtained in adults. Methods: The effect of five criteria (C 0 -C 4) for choosing the endpoint for the regression line fitting and three luminance levels (25, 50, and 100 cd/m 2) on the sVEP VA and <b>contrast</b> <b>thresholds</b> (at 1 and 8 cpd) was investigated in six 6 - 8 year old children. Additionally, the effect of these parameters on the number of viable readings obtained from five active electrodes was investigated. C 0 was derived from the sVEP software (PowerDiva), C 1 used the best fit by eye to determine the range over which the regression line was fitted, C 2 used the data point between signal peak and the last data point with an SNR ≥ 1, C 3 was similar to C 2 but was defined so that the threshold should be within the sweep range, and C 4 was similar to C 2 except that the SNR should not fall below one at any point within the range used for the regression line fitting. The effects of two electrode placements, three temporal frequencies (6, 7. 5, and 10 Hz), sweep direction (low to high and high to low), presence or absence of a fixation target, three stimulus areas (6, 4, and 2 ° for VA and 15, 10, and 6 ° for <b>contrast</b> <b>thresholds)</b> and three sweep durations (10, 15, and 20 sec) on VA and <b>contrast</b> <b>thresholds</b> (at 1, 4, or 8 cpd) measured with sVEP were also investigated in six 6 - 8 year-old children and six adults with normal vision. Additionally, the effect of these parameters on the number of viable readings obtained from five active electrodes was investigated. The sVEP parameters that were found to give the best threshold measurements were employed in a cross sectional study of the development of VA and CS. In this study the objective sVEP technique and two psychophysical techniques were used. The psychophysical techniques were comprised of a two-alternative forced choice (2 AFC) staircase for measuring VA and <b>contrast</b> <b>thresholds</b> and signal detection theory (SDT) for measuring <b>contrast</b> <b>threshold.</b> Crowded and uncrowded logMAR VA were also measured with a Bailey-Lovie logMAR chart. The study included three age groups (6 - 8, 9 - 12 year olds and adults). The criterion employed by each age group as indicated by the SDT was compared. Results: There was a significant effect of the criterion for choosing the endpoint for the regression line fitting (p < 0. 05) on all the measures and a significant effect of luminance (p = 0. 036) on <b>contrast</b> <b>threshold</b> at 1 cpd. Criterion C 2 (in which the range for the regression line fit was defined to include all the data between the signal peak and the last data point [furthest from the peak] with an SNR ≥ 1) consistently gave more viable readings and better thresholds (i. e. higher VA and lower <b>contrast</b> <b>thresholds)</b> than the other criteria. Also C 2 was the best criterion in terms of repeatability in children, and repeatability and validity in adults (Yadav et al., 2009). The luminance of 25 cd/m 2 gave higher <b>contrast</b> <b>thresholds</b> than 50 or 100 cd/m 2. There was a significant effect of temporal frequency on the number of viable readings for VA (p < 0. 0001) and for <b>contrast</b> <b>thresholds</b> (p = 0. 0001), with more viable readings at 7. 5 Hz than at either 6 or 10 Hz. The adults gave more readings with the fixation target than without it (p = 0. 04) for <b>contrast</b> <b>threshold</b> at 1 cpd. The smallest stimulus area used gave rise to fewer viable readings in both adults and children (p = 0. 022 for VA and 0. 0001 for <b>contrast</b> <b>threshold).</b> The other parameters (electrode placement, sweep direction and sweep duration) did not result in significant differences. There was a significant effect of age on crowded (p = 0. 0001) and uncrowded (p < 0. 0001) VA. The 6 - 8 year olds gave poorer VA than the 9 - 12 year olds or adults for both crowded and uncrowded VA. For the grating VA (sVEP and 2 AFC staircase) there was a significant effect of age (p = 0. 002). The 6 - 8 year olds had poorer VA than the 9 - 12 year olds or adults. For <b>contrast</b> <b>threshold</b> at 1 cpd, a significant effect of age was found for the 2 AFC (p = 0. 008) and SDT (p = 0. 0003). The 6 - 8 year olds gave poorer <b>contrast</b> <b>thresholds</b> than adults with each procedure. For <b>contrast</b> <b>thresholds</b> at 8 cpd, there was a significant effect of age with the 2 AFC staircase (p = 0. 036). The 6 - 8 year olds gave poorer <b>contrast</b> <b>thresholds</b> than the 9 - 12 year olds. For SDT, there was a significant effect of age on criterion (p < 0. 05), with adults being more likely to say “no” in the yes-no SDT procedure than both the 6 - 8 year olds and the 9 - 12 year olds for <b>contrast</b> <b>threshold</b> at 1 cpd. Adults {{were also more likely to}} say “no” than the 9 - 12 year olds for <b>contrast</b> <b>thresholds</b> at 8 cpd. Conclusions: This thesis has shown that VA and CS are not adult-like until the age of 9 - 12 years by these measures and that children do show differences in criterion compared to adults in psychophysical testing. This difference in criterion indicates the use of SDT or force-choice procedures to avoid this problem in any psychophysical developmental study. It has also shown that criterion for choosing the endpoint for the regression line fitting in the sVEP technique has the greatest effect on VA and <b>contrast</b> <b>thresholds</b> measurements and viable readings, while the other sVEP parameters have little effect on the thresholds...|$|R
