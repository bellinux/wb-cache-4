50|$|At {{the core}} of <b>visual</b> <b>testing</b> {{is the idea that}} showing someone a problem (or a test failure), rather than just {{describing}} it, greatly increases clarity and understanding. <b>Visual</b> <b>testing</b> therefore requires the recording of the entire test process - capturing everything that occurs on the test system in video format. Output videos are supplemented by real-time tester input via picture-in-a-picture webcam and audio commentary from microphones.|$|E
50|$|<b>Visual</b> <b>testing</b> is {{gathering}} recognition in customer acceptance and usability testing, because the test {{can be used}} by many individuals involved in the development process.

This complex is used for screening purposes to detect potential problems in the patient’s health. Altogether screening complex has 14 measurement modules that measure the status of 12 body subsystems. This paper addresses the development of one of these modules – a <b>visual</b> <b>test.</b> Vision test software consists of two parts – <b>visual</b> acuity <b>test</b> and colour <b>test.</b> <b>Visual</b> acuity <b>test</b> is done using a computer screen for displaying test symbols and using remote control for patient response input. Colour vision test is carried out similarly by displaying pictures of coloured numbers on coloured background and requiring a patient to input those numbers using a keyboard or a mouse.

40|$|Eye therapy such as eye massages, {{has been}} {{designed}} to reduce eye problems and improve blood circulation of the eyes. When reading, the signs and symptoms of visual exhaustion are related to visual stress and people may make use of eye therapy to reduce this visual stress. It is well-known that a relaxed mind can be analysed via the study of an electroencephalogram signal. In this paper, we investigated the effect of eye therapy on visual stress by analysing brain signals (EEG) in frequency domain. Ten subjects participated. In the control task, subjects were asked to relax while EEG data were captured for two minutes. The next part was a <b>visual</b> <b>test</b> task, where the subjects were asked to search for a specific word in a text displayed on a computer screen while their EEG data were recorded. One <b>visual</b> <b>test</b> was performed without prior eye therapy, while the other three <b>visual</b> <b>test</b> tasks were performed following different eye therapy routines. The <b>visual</b> <b>test</b> task was completed fastest when subjects received eye drops and eye massages prior to the <b>visual</b> <b>test.</b> The difference between the <b>visual</b> <b>test</b> with and without prior eye therapy can be observed in the high-gamma frequency band, where with eye therapy, the high-gamma frequency band significantly increases in the frontal, temporal and occipital areas, and the word search performance was improved, with a shorter time needed to complete the task. In conclusion, the high-gamma frequency band may be an indicator to study visual stress, while specific eye-therapy routines may contribute to better eye and brain performance in word searching in a text displayed on a computer scree...|$|R

50|$|Nondestructive testing or {{non-destructive}} testing (NDT) {{is a wide}} group of analysis techniques used {{in science and technology}} industry to evaluate the properties of a material, component or system without causing damage.The terms nondestructive examination (NDE), nondestructive inspection (NDI), and nondestructive evaluation (NDE) are also commonly used to describe this technology.Because NDT does not permanently alter the article being inspected, it is a highly valuable technique that can save both money and time in product evaluation, troubleshooting, and research. The six most frequently used NDT methods are eddy-current, magnetic-particle, liquid penetrant, radiographic, ultrasonic, and <b>visual</b> <b>testing.</b> NDT is commonly used in forensic engineering, mechanical engineering, petroleum engineering, electrical engineering, civil engineering, systems engineering, aeronautical engineering, medicine, and art.

5000|$|One patient, {{referred}} to as WI for privacy reasons, was diagnosed with Cotard delusion after experiencing significant traumatic brain damage. Damage to the cerebral hemisphere, frontal lobe, and the ventricular system was apparent to WI's doctors after examining magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans. In January 1990, WI was discharged to outpatient care. Although his family had made arrangements for him to travel abroad, he continued to experience significant persistent visual difficulties, which provoked a referral for ophthalmological assessment. Formal <b>visual</b> <b>testing</b> then led {{to the discovery of}} further damage. For several months after the initial trauma, WI continued to experience difficulty recognizing familiar faces, places, and objects. He also was convinced that he was dead and experienced feelings of derealization. Later in 1990, after being discharged from the hospital, WI was convinced that he had been taken to hell after dying of either AIDS or septicaemia. When WI finally sought out neurological testing in May 1990, he was no longer fully convinced that he was dead, although he still suspected it. Further testing revealed that WI was able to distinguish between dead and alive individuals with the exception of himself. When WI was treated for depression, his delusions of his own death diminished in a month.|$|E
40|$|Software {{development}} {{is prone to}} time-consuming and expensive errors. Finding and correcting errors in a program (debugging) is usually done by executing the program with different inputs and examining its intermediate and/or final results (testing). The tools that are currently available for debugging (debuggers) do not fully make use of potentially useful visualisation and interaction techniques. This thesis presents a new interactive graphical software testing methodology called <b>visual</b> <b>testing.</b> A programmer can use a <b>visual</b> <b>testing</b> tool to examine and manipulate a running program and its data structures. Systems with techniques applicable to <b>visual</b> <b>testing</b> in the related domains of debugging, software visualisation and algorithm animation are surveyed. Techniques that are potentially useful to <b>visual</b> <b>testing</b> are described, examined and evaluated, and a design for a <b>visual</b> <b>testing</b> tool based on these techniques is presented. The tool combines aspects of user-controlled algorithm simulation, high-level data visualisation and visual debugging, and allows easier testing, debugging and understanding of software. A prototype <b>visual</b> <b>testing</b> tool is presented and evaluated here as a proof of concept {{for some of the}} aspects of <b>visual</b> <b>testing.</b> Finally, some suggestions for future research in <b>visual</b> <b>testing</b> are presented...|$|E

This paper presents a new approach to GUI testing using computer vision for testers to automate their tasks.

Testers can also generate <b>visual</b> <b>test</b> scripts by demonstration. By recording both input events and screen images, it is possible to extract the images of components interacted with and the visual feedback seen by the demonstrator, and generate a <b>visual</b> <b>test</b> script automatically. We show that a variety of GUI behavior can be tested using this approach. Also, we show how this approach can facilitate good testing practices such as unit testing, regression testing, and test-driven development.

A {{battery of}} three verbal and three <b>visual</b> <b>tests</b> was {{developed}} to meet a need for a test of memory functions for use with patients from different racial, cultural, and socioeconomic backgrounds. The test performance of 35 patients with diagnoses implying disorders of the limbic system was compared with that of 35 normal controls matched for race, age, intelligence and sex. Discriminant analysis of the verbal and <b>visual</b> <b>test</b> scores achieved 100 % correct classification of the 27 patients with bilateral damage, but 3 % of the normal controls were misclassified. There was a clear trend for the performance of the 3 patients with left temporal lobe damage to be impaired on the verbal tests, and the performance of the 5 patients with right temporal lobe damage to be impaired on the <b>visual</b> <b>tests.</b> Race, which tends to be correlated with socioeconomic and education levels, had no significant effect on the test scores of the 34 White, 28 Coloured, and 8 African subjects.

40|$|Visual learning, in the {{broadest}} sense, is about acquiring knowledge in a learning environment with visual representations. Examples of this are educational situations in which the learner acquires knowledge {{of the characteristics of}} a concrete study object through observation, such as dissection practicums. Case in point: the practicum “Rat anatomy”. During this practicum, a mammal is carefully dissected layer by layer, whereby observation and identification of the various anatomical structures are the primary means of learning. The assessment of knowledge acquired through visual learning appears to be done best with visual representations, the so-called <b>visual</b> <b>testing</b> (Braden, 1996; Dwyer & Moore, 1994). It is thought to be more sensible to use the same modality for the <b>visual</b> <b>testing</b> as was used for the visual instruction, but this is not feasible for the practicum “Rat anatomy”. Instead, for this educational situation, the students’ knowledge of the subject is assessed based on the drawings made by them during the learning process. However, this <b>visual</b> <b>testing</b> methodology is undesirable for various reasons, beginning with the assumption that the created drawings are proof of the person’s knowledge of the study object. Two other points of concern are the objectivity of the assessment, as it is done manually and with multiple assessors, and the long period of time between instruction and assessment, which subsequently leads to feedback with little effect. The research was started to address these problems by developing a visual CBT test that is in alignment with the learning process, is objective, and provides feedback in {{a relatively short period of}} time. Upon closer examination of these problems, it became apparent that solely developing a test was insufficient due to a lack of knowledge of the precise education objectives – the to be learned construct – relative to visual learning and <b>visual</b> <b>testing.</b> Therefore, the research was broadened in scope by taking a design oriented approach in studying the educational situation as a whole, based on the interaction between instruction and assessment, and with the research question: What is an effective and efficient combination of instruction and assessment for achieving education objectives that are linked to learning through observation of concrete biological material...|$|E

At 5 months of age all the infants had their visual function assessed using the Atkinson Battery of Child Development for Examining Functional Vision, which includes the assessments of optokinetic nystagmus (OKN), acuity, visual fields, fixation shift and phase and orientation reversal visual evoked potentials. At 2 years of age the children had a structured neurological evaluation and a Griffiths developmental assessment.  RESULTS—There was good correlation between the extent of the early detected visual impairment and both neuromotor and global development. Children with more than three out of five abnormal <b>visual</b> <b>tests</b> at 5 months of age tended to have abnormal neurological examination results and abnormal developmental quotients. Children with three or fewer abnormalities tended to have developmental quotients in the normal range; the level of their performance, however, was still related to the number of <b>visual</b> <b>tests</b> passed.  CONCLUSIONS—Individual <b>visual</b> <b>tests</b> can provide important prognostic information. While abnormal OKN and acuity were always associated with abnormal outcome, normal results on visual evoked potentials and fixation shift tended to be associated with normal outcome. ...|$|R
