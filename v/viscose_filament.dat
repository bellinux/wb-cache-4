5000|$|Little {{expansion}} occurred {{until the}} Industrial Revolution when {{in common with}} other Lancashire settlements in the 19th century, Tottington saw a large industrial presence develop, largely {{under the influence of}} John Gorton. Nine mills were listed in an 1891 directory producing calico, cotton cloth and yarn. In 1884 Hilaire de Chardonnet, a French chemist, came to the area to work on a cellulose-based fabric that became known as 'Chardonnay silk'. A forerunner of rayon it was an attractive cloth, Chardonnet displayed it in the Paris Exhibition of 1889. However, like celluloid it was very flammable, following several publicly reported accidents, it was discontinued. The site on Royds Street South reverted to typical Lancashire textile production until 1925, when the Kirklees Rayon Company began producing <b>viscose</b> continuous <b>filament</b> yarn at the mill. This continued until 1955 when viscose production ceased. Courtaulds took over the mill in 1962 and converted it into a dye-house, this work continued until 1980. The site is now occupied by the housing estate centred on Kirklees Street. Tottington Mill printworks was the subject of the 1921 sketch [...] "Mill Yard, Tottington" [...] by LS Lowry.|$|R

40|$|There is {{need for}} the bio‐based {{materials}} which could fully or partly replace the synthetic materials in automotive components. Several studies have been suggested to incorporate natural fiber based materials into automotives, and regenerated cellulose fibers could have a great potential several automotive applications. In the paper we will describe ongoing research where we study non‐woven viscose and Lyocell as well as uniaxial continuous <b>viscose</b> <b>filament</b> reinforcements for the use in structural composites. Hybrid reinforcements based on regenerated cellulose fibers and glass fibers have also been studied, with the intention to optimize the reinforcement durability. The uniaxial <b>viscose</b> <b>filament</b> reinforcements were prepared by a winding technique, and we have also combined the <b>viscose</b> <b>filament</b> with continuous hemp yarns as well as different thermoplastic yarns. Both thermoset and thermoplastic composites were then produced by compression moulding with a pressure of 40 bar and at the temperature between 160 ‐ 170 °C for 5 minutes. The resulting composites have been characterized regarding mechanical and thermal properties...|$|E
40|$|Key words: Jade nylon-based fibers; blend yarn; twist ratio; wearing {{characteristics}} Abstract. In {{order to}} develop a Jade nylon-based fibers knitting blend yarn which has reasonable price, good wearing characteristics, and can highlight the function of Jade fiber, we selected 1. 27 dtex Jade nylon-based fibers and 1. 67 dex <b>viscose</b> <b>filament</b> to blend，twisted them into a yarn, and designed four kinds of blending ratio and three kinds of twist ratio. By testing cool degree and wearing characteristics of indexes of the fabric which was knitted by the flat knitting machine with them, combined with mathematical fuzzy evaluation theory to evaluate these indexes, and taking the wearing characteristics, price, reflection of Jade fiber the three aspects into account, {{we come to the}} conclusion that jade nylon-based fibers blended knitting yarn, blend ratio of 35 : 65, twist of 800 twists / m are for the best...|$|E

Design: A multicentre, prospective, observer-blinded, parallel group, randomised controlled trial, with three arms. Setting: Established expert multidisciplinary clinics for the management of diabetic foot ulcers across the UK. Participants: Patients over age 18 with type 1 or type 2 diabetes with a chronic (present for at least 6 weeks) full-thickness foot ulcer (on or below the malleoli) not penetrating to tendon, periosteum or bone, and with a cross-sectional area between 25 and 2500 mm 2. Interventions: Participants were randomised 1 : 1 : 1 to treatment with one of N-A (a non-adherent, knitted, <b>viscose</b> <b>filament</b> gauze), Inadine (an iodine-impregnated dressing), both traditional dressings, or Aquacel, a newer product. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome measure was the number of ulcers healed in each group at week 24. Secondary measures included time to healing, new ulcerations, major and minor amputations, and episodes of secondary infection. Results: A total of 317 patients were randomised. After 88 withdrawals, 229 remained evaluable. A greater proportion of smaller (25 – 100 mm 2 ulcers healed within the specified time (48. 3...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This article mainly expounds the knitting, {{bleaching}} and {{dyeing process}} of baud silk knitted fabric, {{and has done}} a series performance test for baud silk knitted fabric after finishing. The baud silk namely the cocoon protein <b>viscose</b> <b>filament,</b> {{is a kind of}} renewable protein fiber with the characteristics of silk, conforming to the trend of green environmental protection. By comprehensive employment of high modified polymer technology, the bio-engineering, the chemical engineering and the chemical fiber patent (the Chinese original creation), silkworm chrysalis is firstly taken to make cocoon casein, then to cocoon protein spinning liquid, which then blends with the original viscose spinning fluid and is made into protein textile with skin core structure by using the aqueous spinning method and hydroformylation treatment. It is just like skin cream applying to the skin which can effectively promote metabolism, prevent skin aging, and has the functions of relieving itching, resisting solar radiation, blocking and reducing the harm of ultraviolet ray in the sunshine to human body. It is an exclusive wonderful work in the development of new man-made fibers in our country [1 - 3]. In order to have a systematic understanding to the properties of baud silk, we did a series of experiments...|$|E
