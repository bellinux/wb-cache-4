50|$|The male <b>village</b> <b>indigobird</b> is territorial, {{and he has}} an {{elaborate}} courtship flight display. The song is given from a high perch, and consists of rapid sputtering and churring intermingled with mimicry of red-billed firefinch's song, especially the characteristic chick-pea-pea-pea.|$|E
50|$|Many of the indigobirds {{are very}} similar in appearance, with the males {{difficult}} to separate in the field, and the young and females near impossible. Helpful pointers with the <b>village</b> <b>indigobird</b> are the association with its host species, the red-billed firefinch, and its presence near human habitation.|$|E
50|$|The {{red-billed firefinch}} {{is a small}} gregarious bird which feeds mainly on grain and other seeds. It frequents open {{grassland}} and cultivation. The nest is a large domed grass structure with a side entrance, built low in a bush, wall or thatch into which three to six white eggs are laid. The nest of this species is parasitised by the <b>village</b> <b>indigobird.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Brood-parasitic <b>village</b> <b>indigobirds,</b> Vidua chalybeata, were bred {{in captivity}} and foster-reared by their normal host, red-billed firefinch, Lagonosticta senegala, or by an {{experimental}} foster species, Bengalese finch, Lonchura striata. Male indigobirds reared by Bengalese finches developed {{the songs of}} Bengalese finches, and males reared by firefinches developed songs of firefinches. Males copied their foster father only when they had lived with him long after independence (45 days post-fledging), while males separated normally at independence (22 – 24 days post-fledging) copied songs of other individuals and not songs of their foster father. Males reared by Bengalese finches showed no preference to learn firefinch song over songs of the experimental foster species or other control finch species even when they had lived with firefinches as companions {{from the time of}} fledging to independence. Males copied several song themes, acquired the same number of mimicry songs, and acquired their songs at the same age, whether reared by Bengalese finches or by firefinches. When they lived with other indigobirds, the male indigobirds copied mimicry songs of male indigobirds that mimicked the same foster species. We predicted mimicry-song specificity and repertoire size in experimental indigobirds from a hypothesis of an early developmental period when young indigobirds focus their attention on their foster parents, and a later period when they direct their attention to other birds with similar songs. The predictions, base...|$|R
50|$|The <b>village</b> <b>indigobird</b> is 11-12 cm in length. The {{adult male}} is entirely greenish-black or bluish-black {{except for his}} orange-red legs and conical white bill. The female resembles a female house sparrow, with {{streaked}} brown upperparts, buff underparts, a whitish supercilium and a yellowish bill, although she also has red legs. Immature birds are like the female but plainer and without a supercilium.|$|E
50|$|The <b>village</b> <b>indigobird</b> or steelblue widowfinch (Vidua chalybeata) {{is a small}} {{songbird}} {{belonging to}} the family Viduidae. It is distinguishable from other indigobird species by bill and leg colours, the colour tinge of the male's breeding plumage, song, and to lesser extent, the nestling's plumage and mouth pattern. The bill colour can be red or white depending on the population, {{and there is some}} regional variation in the colour tone of the male's plumage.|$|E
5000|$|All are obligate brood parasites, {{which lay}} their eggs in the nests of estrildid finch species; most indigobirds use firefinches as hosts, whereas the paradise whydahs chose pytilias. Unlike the cuckoos and honeyguides, the indigobirds and whydahs do not destroy the host's eggs. Typically, they lay 2 - 4 eggs in with those already present. The eggs of both the host and the victim are white, {{although}} the indigobird's are slightly larger. Many of the indigo-plumaged species named [...] "indigobirds" [...] are very similar in appearance, with the males difficult to separate in the field, and the young and females near impossible. The best guide is often the estrildid finch {{with which they are}} associating, since each indigobird parasitises a different host species. For example, the <b>village</b> <b>indigobird</b> is usually found with red-billed firefinches. Indigobirds and whydahs imitate their host's song, which the males learn in the nest. Although females do not sing, they also learn to recognise the song, and choose males with the same song, thus perpetuating the link between each species of indigobird and firefinch. The nestling indigobirds mimic the unique gape pattern of the fledglings of the host species.|$|E
40|$|Tropical African birds, {{especially}} in the non-forested regions, are characteristically seasonal in their breeding and moult (Moreau 1950, Morel & Morel 1962, Fry 1970, Benson et d. 1971, Sinclair 1978). Several species also are known to make seasonal move-ments, usually related to seasonal aspects of rainfall (Moreau 1966, Ward 1971, Elgood, Fry & Dowsett 1973). Such migrations may be local or cover {{hundreds or thousands of}} kilometree (Elgood, Fry & Dowsett 1973). Most studies of ringed populations have been localized, with the result that seasonal breeding and moult have been readily discernible but the nature of seasonal movements has been less clear (Morel 1973, Woodall 1975, Skead 1975, Greig-Smith 1978). Red-billed Firefinches Lugonostictu senegala are usually considered sedentary and seasonal breeders. They have been studied most intensively in Senegal (Morel 1973). Although in most parts of their range they occur year round, in some they are seasonal in occurrence (Jones &Ward 1977). During a study of the population structure and song dialects of the <b>Village</b> <b>Indigobird</b> Vidua chulybeatu, the brood parasite of Red-billed Firehches (Payne & Payne 1977, Payne, in press), firefinches at Lochinvar National Park, Zambia, were trapped and ringed, and seasonal activity among them was monitored closely for 18 months and in less detail for another 2. 5 years. STUDY AREA AND METHODS Lochinvar National Park lies along the southern bank of the Ka€ue River flood plains in Zambia, and extends several kilometres into open woodland. The central part of the study area was at 15 " 57 ' 5, 27 " 15 'E. The habitat has been described elsewhere (Sheppe &...|$|E
