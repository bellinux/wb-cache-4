2500|$|The {{camshaft}} [...] "lift" [...] is {{the resultant}} net {{rise of the}} valve from its seat. [...] The farther the valve rises from its seat the more airflow can be provided, which is generally more beneficial. [...] Greater lift has some limitations. [...] Firstly, lift {{is limited by the}} increased proximity of the <b>valve</b> <b>head</b> to the piston crown and secondly, greater effort is required to move the valve springs to a higher state of compression. Increased lift can also be limited by lobe clearance in the cylinder head casting. Higher valve lift can have the same effect as increased duration where valve overlap is less desirable.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the flight}} the {{loosened}} nut caused increasingly excessive valve clearance eventually allowing collision of the <b>valve</b> <b>head</b> {{with the rising}} piston fracturing the valve stem, which then allowed the inlet valve to drop open, resulting in the ignition by the spark plug of the pressurised fuel/air mixture within the inlet manifold and, eventually, the pumping of the ignited fuel outboard of the rocker cover and along {{the outside of the}} engine, leading to an extensive fire in the engine nacelle. Due to the fire [...] originating in the induction system, where the supercharged fuel/air mixture was at higher pressure than atmospheric, the heart of the fire was much hotter burning and intense than would be the case in a simple fuel fire.|$|E
2500|$|Valve lift can be {{expressed}} as an actual dimension in decimal inches or mm. It can also be specified as a ratio between a characteristic diameter and the lift L/D. Most often used is the <b>valve</b> <b>head</b> diameter. Normally engines have an L/D ratio from 0 up {{to a maximum of}} [...]35. For example, a [...] valve would be lifted a maximum of 0.350inch. During flow testing the valve would be set at L/D [...]05 [...]1 [...]15 [...]2 [...]25 [...]3 and readings taken successively. This allows the comparison of efficiencies of ports with other valve sizes, as the valve lift is proportional rather than absolute. For comparison with tests by others the characteristic diameter used to determine lift must be the same.|$|E
50|$|Also in June 1971, {{the first}} Ducati 750 GT models {{came out of}} the factory, {{distinguished}} by silver frames, metal-flake paint, fibreglass fuel tanks, 30 mm Amal carburettors, and twin leading shoe rear brakes. Taglioni experimented with four <b>valve</b> <b>heads</b> at this time, but failed to produce better power figures than his two <b>valve</b> <b>heads,</b> so the two valve racers continued. He continued to experiment with four <b>valve</b> <b>heads</b> right up to 1973.|$|R
50|$|The Trofimoff valve {{comprises}} the valve spindle, the piston <b>valve</b> <b>heads</b> slotted onto {{them and the}} two supporting plates (Stützplatten). When the engine is running under load the <b>valve</b> <b>heads</b> are forced by steam pressure onto the support plates and work like standard pistons (Regelkolbenschieber). If steam admission ceases or, on a steam locomotive, the regulator is closed, the pressure drops, the <b>valve</b> <b>heads</b> remain in the inside dead centre position near {{the centre of the}} cylinder due to the tension of the piston rings. The valve spindle continues to move backwards and forwards with the support plates attached to it, without disturbing the <b>valve</b> <b>heads.</b> In this way, perfect pressure balance is achieved, thus ensuring excellent light-running conditions for the steam engine or locomotive.|$|R
50|$|Taglioni {{experimented with}} four <b>valve</b> <b>heads</b> at this time, {{but failed to}} produce better power figures than his two <b>valve</b> <b>heads,</b> so the two valve racers {{continued}}. He continued to experiment with four <b>valve</b> <b>heads</b> right up to 1973. In 1971 race results were spoilt by a run of gearbox and ignition problems. Phil Read's second to Agostini in the San Remo Grand Prix, and a fourth, also by Read, at Monza in the Grand Prix delle Nazione were {{the highlights of the}} season.|$|R
2500|$|Valve/port {{coefficient}} is non dimensional and {{is derived}} by multiplying a characteristic physical {{area of the}} port and by the bulk flow figures and comparing the result to an ideal orifice of the same area. It is here that air flow bench norms differ from fluid dynamics or aerodynamics at large. The coefficient may {{be based on the}} inner valve seat diameter, the outer <b>valve</b> <b>head</b> diameter, the port throat area or the valve open curtain area. Each of these methods are valid for some purpose but none of them represents the true minimum area for the valve/port in question and each results in a different flow coefficient. The great difficulty of measuring the actual minimum area at all the various valve lifts precludes using this as a characteristic measurement. This is due to the minimum area changing shape and location throughout the lift cycle. Because of this non standardization, port flow coefficients are not [...] "true" [...] flow coefficients, which would be based on the actual minimum area in the flow path. Which method to choose depends on what use is intended for the data. Engine simulation applications each require their own specification. If the result is to be compared to the work of others then the same method would have to be selected.|$|E

50|$|In {{later years}} {{motorsport}} regulations were changed {{so that the}} use of four <b>valve</b> <b>heads</b> was only possible when the homologation cars had four <b>valve</b> <b>heads.</b> Therefore, the homologation series of the Fiat 131 Rally Abarth came with a two-litre version of the four valve engine.|$|R

5000|$|Originally {{developed}} as a racing prototype, the production model was essentially a race replica. Various modifications and improvements were made over the ten years of production. Early models had a 'pent roof' four <b>valve</b> <b>head,</b> with two pairs of valves operating on parallel slopes like a 'pitched roof', which was replaced in 1932 with a radial four <b>valve</b> <b>head</b> and an option of a foot operated gear change. This foot pedal operated both {{the front and rear}} brakes, with a hand lever also operating the front brake. With a top speed of over , the Rudge Ulster was advertised as [...] "probably the fastest 500cc motorcycle in production".|$|E
50|$|It {{was quite}} {{advanced}} in some ways, using hydraulic disc brakes {{both at the}} front and back as well as a 6 <b>valve</b> <b>head.</b> In other ways, however, it was harking back to the late '70s with its retro styling, semi automatic camchain tensioner and balancer system.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine is}} {{essentially}} the four-cylinder engine of the preceding 25 hp car which chief engineer C E King had modified adding an overhead <b>valve</b> <b>head</b> and, because such largish engines now usually had six-cylinders for smoothness, the harmonic balancer invented by Dr F W Lanchester at the centre of its crankshaft.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the start}} of the 1970s two <b>valve</b> per {{cylinder}} <b>heads</b> were ubiquitous, {{by the end of the}} decade four <b>valve</b> <b>heads</b> were available on the high end bikes. The similarity of the designs across brands and years led to the coining of the term [...] "UJM" [...] for Universal Japanese Motorcycle, which began with Honda's CB-750 of 1969.|$|R
50|$|The {{basic design}} is a revised 3VZ-E iron-block engine, mated with {{aluminum}} DOHC 24 <b>valve</b> <b>heads.</b> It has a forged steel crankshaft and cast connecting rods. The upper intake plenum {{is of the}} split-chamber design with Toyota's ACIS variable-intake system feeding three sets of runners for both heads.|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of valveflow area is highlighted and {{the advantages of}} the four <b>valve</b> cylinder <b>head</b> mentioned. A simple method of making a preliminary assessment of multi-valve schemes, based upon relative effective flow areas, is outlined. The method is demon-strated with reference to eight and less valves for odd and even numbers. The 37 per cent increase in valve area for the four valve case is demonstrated and the promising possibilities for the three, j i v e and seven <b>valve</b> <b>heads</b> are presented. Key words: flow area, poppet valves, multiple valve...|$|R
50|$|The bike {{was fitted}} with an advanced, four-stroke, single-cylinder engine, {{sometimes}} {{described as a}} shrunken half of an RC145. The engine was inclined at 35°, and fitted with a spur gear driven double overhead camshaft, a four <b>valve</b> <b>head</b> and five speed gearbox. The engine was said to produce 9.5 bhp at 14,000 rpm.|$|E
5000|$|To induce better {{swirling}} of the {{air-fuel mixture}} in the GR650 engine, Suzuki used a [...] "sub-intake port," [...] which ran a tube from the carburetor throat to the intake port {{just above the}} <b>valve</b> <b>head.</b> Suzuki claimed that this allows the GR650 to run with a leaner mixture than usual, which improves economy.|$|E
50|$|Following BMW's typical {{construction}} techniques at the time, {{the motor}} incorporates a cast-iron block and aluminium head. Weight-saving measures include aluminium chain cases, oil sump, motor mount arms, accessory mounts and a cartridge-style oil filter housing. Closely {{related to the}} SOHC M40, the M42's DOHC 16 <b>valve</b> <b>head</b> and chain-driven cams provided increased power {{in comparison to the}} M40.|$|E
50|$|Brightray is a {{nickel-chromium}} alloy that {{is noted}} for its resistance to erosion by gas flow at high temperatures. It was used for hard-facing the exhaust <b>valve</b> <b>heads</b> and seats of petrol engines, particularly aircraft engines from the 1930s onwards. It was developed by Henry Wiggin and Co at Birmingham.|$|R
50|$|They {{eventually}} {{determined that}} exhaust valves could run cooler when a hollow core filled with sodium is used — the sodium liquefies and considerably increases the heat transfer from the <b>valve's</b> <b>head</b> to its stem {{and then to}} the relatively cooler cylinder head where the liquid coolant picks it up.|$|R
50|$|Someron Voima (abbreviated SoVo) is {{a sports}} club from Somero in Finland. The club {{was formed in}} 1932 and their home ground is at the Someron urheilukenttä. The men's {{football}} first team currently plays in the Kakkonen (Second Division). The Chairman of SoVo is Timo Rannikko and Ismo <b>Valve</b> <b>heads</b> the Football Section.|$|R
50|$|The Triumph Ricardo was a British single-cylinder {{motorcycle}} {{manufactured by}} the Triumph Engineering Co Ltd between 1921 and 1928. Named after engine designer Sir Harry Ricardo it featured an innovative four <b>valve</b> <b>head</b> design and {{was capable of}} over 70 mph, set three world speed records and {{won a gold medal}} in the 1923 International Six Day Trial.|$|E
50|$|Instruments {{are usually}} a basic set given {{the size of}} the panel. It {{consists}} of variometer, altimeter, speed indicator in the top line and two smaller engine instruments below (revolution counter and <b>valve</b> <b>head</b> temperature indicator). Custom upgrades can be of different kind usually providing communication radios, different GPS devices, integrated engine instruments, Hobbs meter, ELT or turn indicators.|$|E
50|$|For the 1962 and 1963 {{car model}} years, the <b>valve</b> <b>head</b> diameters {{remained}} {{the same as the}} 221, but for the 1964 car model year, they were enlarged to 1.67 in (42.4 mm) (intake) and 1.45 in (36.8 mm) (exhaust) - this was an economy measure so that both 260 and 289 engines could use the same valves. Rated power was not changed.|$|E
50|$|The Trofimoff {{piston valve}} {{consisted}} of two fixed discs secured to the valve spindle, and two junk rings, each carrying a bull ring and four valve rings and both free to move longitudinally on the spindle. When the regulator is opened, steam forces the loose valve bodies against their respective fixed discs and they then act as units, similar to ordinary piston valves. When steam is shut off, the loose <b>valve</b> <b>heads</b> become detached from their respective discs and remain in their idle positions near {{the centre of the}} steam chest, while the valve spindle and fixed disks continue their reciprocating motion with the spindle sliding freely through the now stationary loose <b>valve</b> <b>heads,</b> and with the steam and exhaust ports now in communi&shy;ca&shy;tion. With both ends of the cylinders now in communication, the use of ordinary by-bass or snifting valves became unnecessary.|$|R
2500|$|The head {{used during}} this time was the {{so-called}} [...] "rectangle port", named after its exhaust port shape. The 290 <b>heads</b> use smaller <b>valves,</b> [...] intake and [...] exhaust, {{in order to prevent}} problems with the small bore. The 343 and the AMX 390 use the same larger <b>valve</b> <b>heads,</b> [...] intake and [...] exhaust.|$|R
2500|$|In 1995, the {{introduction}} of the next generation R-259 or oilhead engine signalled BMW's entry into modern adventure models, with a succession of larger displacement models including the R850GS, R1100GS, R1150GS and the R1200GS. Later models have electronic engine management, ABS braking, twin spark plugs, and more power than airhead models, {{due in part to the}} use of four <b>valve</b> <b>heads.</b>|$|R
50|$|Forced {{to raise}} their asking prices to {{counteract}} the effects of wartime inflation, National {{ended up in a}} higher price range in which they could not compete. For 1920, National dropped their Highway Sixes and Twelves and issued a new model - the Sextet. The Sextet used a Continental side-valve six-cylinder, modified by National engineers with an overhead <b>valve</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
50|$|Engine {{differences}} {{from the previous}} Model A included a single cam wheel with two cams replacing separate cam wheels for the inlet and exhaust valve, and new design of cylinder casting. <b>Valve</b> <b>head</b> diameter was enlarged and the valves were spaced further apart. The Model H was fitted with a Sturmey-Archer three-speed countershaft gearbox operated by a hand gear change lever.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} {{benefit of}} the sidevalve design is that, if a valve should seize in its guide (remain partially open), only limited damage to that individual cylinder would occur, and an engine can often operate safely on its other cylinders with a seized valve. If a <b>valve</b> <b>head</b> breaks off, it may become lodged between the piston and the head causing severe damage.|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} {{investigation was}} carried out {{with a view to}} determining the feasibility of internal cooling as applied to internal combustion engines. By internal cooling,is meant the injection of water into the cylinder, by means of a mechanically operated valve or nozzle, the several jets striking the cylinder walls, <b>valves,</b> <b>head</b> and piston, and absorbing heat from them.

50|$|The {{cast-iron}} {{heads were}} designed with hemispherical combustion chambers {{and a single}} overhead camshaft over each head, operating shaft-mounted roller rocker arms. The valvetrain consisted of valves larger than those on Ford wedge head engines, made out of stainless steel and with sodium-filled exhaust valves to prevent the <b>valve</b> <b>heads</b> from burning, and dual valve springs. This design allowed for high volumetric efficiency at high engine speed.|$|R
