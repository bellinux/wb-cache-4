The {{effect of}} {{variation}} in autoclave pressure, cure temperature, and vacuum-application time on porosity, hot/wet (H/W) and room temperature/dry (RT/D) short beam shear (SBS) strengths, and failure mechanisms of IM 7 / 977 - 2 unidirectional prepreg was investigated. The stacking sequence for all panels was [00 / 902 / 0] 4 s. Fourteen cure cycles were designed to study {{a wide range of}} cure pressures, cure temperatures, and two different vacuum-application durations, including vacuum vent at recommended pressure and <b>vacuum</b> <b>hold</b> throughout the cure cycle. It was found that for panels cured at different temperatures and for panels cured at different pressures with a vacuum vent at recommended pressure, SBS strength did not vary significantly over a relatively wide range of cure temperatures and pressures. However, after a certain point, a decreasing trend in the average SBS strength for both H/W and RT/D was observed by reducing the cure temperature as well as the cure pressure. Panels with the same cure pressure and dissimilar vacuum-application durations showed different SBS strength, with higher properties associated with panels in which the vacuum was vented at the recommended pressure. For panels cured at various cure pressures and the <b>vacuum</b> <b>hold</b> throughout the cure cycles, C-scan results showed a cross-shaped high-porosity {{in the middle of the}} panels, which became larger as the cure pressure decreased. This defect is believed to cause higher variability of the SBS strength as the cure pressure is reduced. SBS strength was found to decrease with increasing void content in the test specimens. Theoretical models were compared to the experimental data of SBS strength vs. void content. Investigation of the failure mode for each panel revealed a change in both H/W and RT/D failure mechanism by lowering the cure temperature and cure pressure. However, the change was more dominant when the cure temperature was varied...|$|E
40|$|An {{aircraft}} demonstrator was manufactured using out-of-autoclave prepreg and vacuum-bag-only processing techniques. The demonstrator featured flat, double-curvature, joggles, abrupt geometry changes, and honeycomb inserts. The {{scientific literature}} {{was used to}} assess and mitigate the processing risks for this demonstrator. Low through-thickness gas permeability and ply-bridging in small radii corners were thought to be the most significant risks. The through-thickness permeability of the target material was undetectable, therefore spiking was used to increase gas evacuation. Unfortunately, the available mould had small radii that could not be increased, as a result ply bridging was observed in these corners. Miniature pressure sensors were successfully embedded in the demonstrator to monitor the honeycomb core pressure throughout the lay-up, including intermittent de-bulking, the pre-cure <b>vacuum</b> <b>hold,</b> and the elevated temperature cure. The sensors identified two insightful process phenomena: 1) gas evacuation increased with additional plies, and 2) non-uniform pressure response was observed in the part during cure. Visible part quality was acceptable, excluding small radii geometrical features. Internal part quality (voidage) was estimated using pulsed infrared thermography non-destructive-evaluation. While void contents are not exact, the thermography revealed local voidage can vary significantly over the part. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|BlackGEM (BG) is {{an array}} of telescopes, {{currently}} under development at the Radboud University Nijmegen and at NOVA. It targets the detection of the optical counterparts of gravitational waves. The first 3 BG telescopes are planned to be installed in 2018 at the La Silla observatory. A single prototype telescope, named MeerLICHT, will already be commissioned early 2017 in Sutherland to provide an optical complement for the MeerKAT radio array. The BG array consists of, initially, a set of 3 robotic 65 -cm wide-field telescopes. Each telescope {{is equipped with a}} single STA 1600 CCD detector with 10. 5 k x 10. 5 k 9 -mum pixels that covers a 2. 7 square degrees field of view. The cryostats for housing these detectors are developed and built at the KU Leuven University. The operational model of BG requires long periods of reliable ands-off operation. Therefore, we designed the cryostats for long <b>vacuum</b> <b>hold</b> time and we make use of a closed-cycle cooling system, based on Polycold PCC Joule-Thomson coolers. A single programmable logic controller (PLC) controls the cryogenic systems of several BG telescopes simultaneously, resulting in a highly reliable, cost-efficient and maintenance-friendly system. PLC-based cryostat control offers some distinct advantages, especially for a robotic facility. Apart of temperature monitoring and control, the PLC also monitors the vacuum quality, the power supply and the status of the PCC coolers (compressor power consumption and temperature, pressure in the gas lines, etc.). Furthermore, it provides an alarming system and safe and reproducible procedures for automatic cool down and warm up. The communication between PLC and higher-level software takes place via the OPC-UA protocol, offering a simple to implement, yet very powerful interface. Finally, a touch-panel display on the PLC provides the operator with a user-friendly and robust technical interface.

40|$|Various RO {{membrane}} integrity monitoring {{methods are}} currently being evaluated during pilot testing at the North City Water Reclamation Plant (NCWRP) located in San Diego, CA. The main purpose of the testing is to assess both direct and indirect monitoring techniques currently available to measure the integrity and reliability of RO membranes during water reclamation. Specific methods being evaluated include <b>vacuum</b> <b>hold</b> testing, conductivity probing, online conductivity/sulfate monitoring and soluble dye testing. In addition, the testing {{program is designed to}} assess the integrity of new generation RO membranes being offered for water reuse applications. The specific membrane suppliers participating in this study include Koch, Saehan, Hydranautics and Toray. Field evaluations are being conducted in three distinct phases. Phase I testing was conducted between August – April 2005. During this time period, the integrity of RO membranes from each of the participating suppliers was assessed using the various test methods during operation on tertiary wastewater from the NCWRP. Phase I pilot testing was performed using single stage RO systems operating at feed water recovery of 50 %. Results from Phase I showed each of the methods tested correlated well to virus rejection but varied in sensitivity and ease of implementation. In addition, the degree of virus rejection observed from the membranes varied among suppliers. The purpose of Phase II testing, currently underway, is {{to assess the impact of}} staging on the sensitivity of each of the integrity monitoring techniques tested during Phase I. Accordingly, the RO membrane, which showed the highest level of rejection during Phase I testing, is currently being operated in a two-stage system at feed water recovery of 75 %.

40|$|Usually it is {{supposed}} that Majorana neutrino produced in the superposition state χ_L = ν_L + (ν_L) ^c and then follows the neutrinoless double beta decay. But since weak interactions are chiral invariant then the neutrino at production has definite helicity (i. e., ν_L and (ν_L) ^c neutrinos are separately produced and then neutrino {{is not in the}} superposition state). This helicity cannot change after production without any external interactions. Thus we see that for unsuitable helicity the neutrinoless double β decay is not possible even if neutrino is a Majorana particle. Also transition of Majorana neutrino into antineutrino at their oscillations is forbidden since helicity in <b>vacuum</b> <b>holds.</b> Then only possibility to prove that neutrino is a Dirac but not Majorana particle is detection transition of ν_L neutrino into (sterile) antineutrino ν̅_R (i. e., ν_L →ν̅_R) at neutrino oscillations. Transition Majora neutrino ν_L into (ν_R) ^c (i. e., ν_L → (ν_R) ^c) at oscillations is unobserved since it {{is supposed}} that mass of (ν_R) ^c is very big. Comment: 12 pages, no figure...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} we suggest, without {{detailed}} mathematical analysis, a hypothesis {{on the physical}} meaning of cosmological constant. It is primarily based on a conceptual analogy with energy characteristics of the crystal lattice structure, i. e. energy zones theory in solid state physics. Namely, according to some theories (holographic principle, emergent gravity etc.) it is supposed that empty space, i. e. quantum <b>vacuum</b> <b>holds</b> a structure like to crystal lattice. It implies a possibility {{of the existence of}} totally occupied zones consisting of many levels of the negative energies as well as at least one negative energy forbidden zone, i. e. negative energy gap without any (occupied or empty) level of the negative energy. We suppose that given negative energy forbidden zone in the quantum vacuum represents effectively a positive energy zone without quantum particles that corresponds to cosmological constant. Also we suggest some other (less extravagant) model of the cosmological constant. Here cosmological constant is usually considered as the effect of the quantum vacuum fluctuations where problem of the cut-off can be solved quite simply since here integration over unlimited domain of the quasi-momentums must be changed by integration over one, finite "Brillouin zone".

50|$|The {{interference}} fringes typically only form {{once the}} optical flat begins to wring to the testing surface. If the surfaces are clean and very flat, they {{will begin to}} wring almost immediately after the first contact. After wringing begins, as air is slowly forced out from between the surfaces, an optical wedge forms between the surfaces. The interference fringes form perpendicular to this wedge. As the air is forced out, the fringes will appear {{to move toward the}} thickest gap, spreading out and becoming wider but fewer. As the air is forced out, the <b>vacuum</b> <b>holding</b> the surfaces together becomes stronger. The optical flat should usually never be allowed to fully wring to the surface, otherwise it can be scratched or even broken when separating them. In some cases, if left for many hours, a block of wood may be needed to knock them loose. Testing flatness with an optical flat is typically done as soon a viable interference pattern develops, and then the surfaces are separated before they can fully wring. Because the angle of the wedge is extremely shallow and the gap extremely small, wringing may take a few hours to complete. Sliding the flat in relation to the surface can speed up wringing, but trying to press the air out will have little effect.|$|R

2500|$|Physics {{currently}} lacks a full {{theoretical model}} for understanding zero-point energy, {{in particular the}} discrepancy between theorized and observed vacuum energy {{is a source of}} major contention. Physicists Richard Feynman and John Wheeler calculated the zero-point radiation of the vacuum to be an order of magnitude greater than nuclear energy, with one teacup containing enough energy to boil all the world's oceans. Yet according to Einstein's theory of general relativity any such energy would gravitate and the experimental evidence from both the expansion of the universe, dark energy and the Casimir effect show any such energy to be exceptionally weak. A popular proposal that attempts to address this issue is to say that the fermion field has a negative zero-point energy while the boson field has positive zero-point energy and thus these energies somehow cancel each other out. This idea would be true if supersymmetry were an exact symmetry of nature. However, the LHC at CERN has so far found no evidence to support supersymmetry. Moreover, it is known that if supersymmetry is valid at all, it is at most a broken symmetry, only true at very high energies, and no one has been able to show a theory where zero-point cancellations occur in the low energy universe we observe today. This discrepancy is known as the cosmological constant problem and {{it is one of the}} greatest unsolved mysteries in physics.

50|$|In the {{traditional}} tokamak design, the confinement magnets are normally arranged outside a toroidal <b>vacuum</b> chamber <b>holding</b> the plasma.

In a production design, another layer, the blanket, sits between the first wall and magnets. The blanket serves two purposes, one is to protect the magnets from the high energy neutrons, which will damage them, and the other is to use those neutrons to breed tritium from lithium, producing more fuel for the reactor. However, this arrangement means there is considerable distance between the magnets and plasma, in most designs {{something on the order of}} a meter or more.
