50|$|The University College Dublin (UCD) James Joyce Library {{built up}} the first Irish library in Second Life. University College Dublin set up its library in Second Life in March 2007 {{as a part of}} ALS's Cybrary City project. This virtual library has several {{features}} and services, including user surveys, e-mail services, e-books, presentations, comment box, virtual PC, notecard giver, trampoline, dance machine and <b>visitor</b> <b>counter.</b> A work group was established for services, technology, staffing and marketing.|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{proposes a}} <b>visitor</b> <b>counter</b> system which {{is capable of}} {{counting}} single & multiple object visitors using fuzzy measure theory for tracking and Boosting method for classification. Besides fuzzy measure theory, the paper also uses Euclidean distance to track a visitor based on his movement between each frame, while fuzzy measure theory tracks a visitor based on trust degree. Both system performances are compared for their visitor tracking accuracy and their computational speed. Experimental results show that Euclidean distance and Fuzzy measure have similar accuracy for tracking visitor. However, Euclidean distance is faster than those of fuzzy measure theory in the computational speed. The proposed <b>visitor</b> <b>counter</b> system can be further developed for real-time visitor counting in shopping mall, station, and other places...|$|E
40|$|The library <b>visitors</b> <b>counter</b> system using barcode and MySQL based with Borland Delphi 7. 0 {{has been}} done for ease in {{counting}} the visitors in a library and data to be displayed more accurate and comprehensive. Bar code which printed on visitors card is aimed at barcode scanner to read the code of the identity of visitors who will enter the library. At Borland Delphi 7. 0 uses the pascal programming language that is integrated with the input of barcode and database MySQL able to display the time visitors enter the library. From this research {{it was found that}} Borland Delphi 7. 0 software can read the records in the MySQL database and display properly on a monitor in accordance with the data stored on the visitors database...|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{methods used}} in the {{planning}} and management of human-landscape interactions fall {{far short of the}} needs of today’s land management professionals. Monitoring, Simulation, and Management of Visitor Landscapes presents a growing body of applied research that provides decision makers with tools to maintain the ecological integrity of public places by evaluating the impacts of humans in various landscapes across space and time. This timely volume, available in both print and electronic editions, presents the latest research in this field, specifically focusing on the intersection of research and applied techniques. The contributors examine environmental management from around the world, including river traffic analysis in Melbourne, Australia; wilderness solitude and land use in the backcountry recreation areas of North America; the spatial modeling of visitor behavior at recreational areas near Vienna, Austria; the application of visibility studies and data from automatic <b>visitor</b> <b>counters</b> to simulation models in Denmark; and the integration of recreation and biodiversity in high-use environments in the Netherlands. This invaluable reference will help land managers and policy makers construct strategies for evaluating interactions between humans and the environment and expand the model of land management to include social and geographic, as well as environmental, factors.

50|$|The {{simplest}} form of counter is a single, horizontal {{infrared beam}} across an entrance which is typically {{linked to a}} small LCD display unit {{at the side of}} the doorway. Such a beam counts a 'tick' when the beam is broken, therefore it is normal to divide the 'ticks' by two to get <b>visitor</b> numbers. Beam <b>counters</b> usually require a receiver or a reflector mounted opposite the unit with a typical range from 2.5 m to 6 m. Despite the limitations, infrared counters are still widely used due to the low cost and simplicity of installation.|$|R
40|$|The {{implementation}} of a Microcontroller based automatic door control with <b>visitor</b> <b>counter</b> will lead to vast improvement on electronic security designs. Nevertheless, for a system with large volume of movement {{with little or no}} security consciousness, a door system to fit the system without unnecessary delay in the free flow of movement usually tends to pose a problem. Usually, in this kind of scenario, an automatic door system with a means of detecting incoming traffic so as to open the door as required, thus the design and operational principles of a microcontroller based automatic door with <b>visitor</b> <b>counter.</b> The design is made of sensors that detect human presence, a dynamic display unit that displays different messages at specific time, the H-bridge driver IC controls the movement of the motor attached to the door. The whole system is controlled by an 8051 microcontroller (89 s 51) ...|$|E
40|$|The idea of {{this group}} Project Proposal is to design a web site {{describing}} the history, theory and applications of the Hopfield neural network, together with a simple demonstrator which {{as far as possible}} can be controlled by the remote user. The resulting project is limited only by time and imagination. Desirable features are a pleasant design, a web <b>visitor</b> <b>counter,</b> good graphics and well laid out and presented text. No actual programming is required but a simple simulator design should be included together with recommendations for implementation platforms. General description of the model. The Hopfield network [Hopfield 1982] is a simple model of an associative memory. The network consists of n nodes (neurons) that each have a very simple function. The nodes are connected together via links from node j to node i. When each node updates it produces an output which is 0 or 1. The links convey the outputs from each node to the other nodes. Each link has a...|$|E
50|$|After {{entering}} the building {{they would pay}} an attendant for their sulphur water. The water was traditionally served in glasses from a wooden <b>counter.</b> <b>Visitors</b> to the pump room were charged for drinking its water inside the building. Hollins' Handbook for Harrogate stated that an Act of Parliament governed {{the price of the}} water from the Pump Room. For an individual it would cost 1 shilling to drink sulphur water at the Pump Room for a week. A family could drink the waters at the Pump Room for the same duration at a cost of 4 shillings.However, legislation from as early as 1841 stated that Strong Sulphur Water was to be made available for free to those who could not afford it.|$|R
40|$|Library is {{the heart}} of campus life and the entry gate of science. The number of {{visitors}} to the library is an indicator {{of the quality of the}} academic atmosphere in the university. Visitors during this data collection is done manually have limitations in terms of data accuracy and data processing electronics to follow up. Data has advantages in data accuracy and process. In this research aims to design tool <b>Counters</b> <b>Visitors</b> to the library with AT 89 S 51 Microcontroller with LCD Viewer. This tool will automatically calculate how many students get in the library. So by knowing the number of student activities at the college library will be easy to determine the next steps to improve the quality of services at the library...|$|R
