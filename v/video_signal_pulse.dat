40|$|A novel amplifications {{scheme for}} 20 - 30 -fs laser pulses has been demonstrated. The <b>signal</b> <b>pulses</b> are amplified in a plasma by few {{picosecond}} long, counterpropagating pump <b>pulses.</b> The <b>signal</b> and pump <b>pulses</b> arrange the plasma electrons to a density grating reflecting the pump light {{back into the}} <b>signal</b> <b>pulse.</b> In the superradiant regime, the plasma electrons scatter the pump pulse coherently. By an intrinsic mechanism a further shortening of the <b>signal</b> <b>pulse</b> to less than 10 fs is possible. The experiment was set up at the "Max-Planck-Institut für Quantenoptik", using the ATLAS laser system as source for the pump and input <b>signal</b> <b>pulses.</b> Both a regime with pump and <b>signal</b> <b>pulse</b> at the same initial wavelength and with a input signal shifted towards longer wavelengths {{with respect to the}} pump pulse were investigated. The unshifted <b>signal</b> <b>pulse</b> showed some initial amplification but further amplification was frustrated by the onset of Brillouin scattering. The superradiant regime was observed for the red-shifted input <b>signal</b> <b>pulse.</b> It is proven by 20 times energy amplification, the spectral broadening indicating the pulse shortening, and the breakup of the 80 -fs long <b>signal</b> <b>pulse</b> caused by the very mechanism responsible also for the pulse shortening.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The work described in this thesis proposes and investigates further use of scrambling in industrial analogue and digital monochrome video systems. This scrambling inevitably entails some signal modification. Providing the receiver is able {{to distinguish between the}} original and the scrambled signal, regardless of which one was transmitted, more efficient signal exploitation is possible. This more efficient signal exploitation is performed {{at the expense of the}} inherent redundancy present in the analogue and di ital <b>signals.</b> Analogue <b>video</b> <b>signals</b> are usually of a highly correlative nature and, this characteristic is exploited, in this thesis, by enabling them to be unwitting data carriers. The <b>video</b> <b>signal</b> is made the data carrier while the data gets a free ride. Each scan-line of the <b>video</b> <b>signal</b> is sampled, and blocks of pels are scrambled or not by modulo masking, depending on whether the data necessary for transmission is a logical 1 11 or 1 01 respectively. Prior to transmission the combined data and video sequence is converted into a continuous signal with a bandwidth that is no greater than that of the original <b>video</b> <b>signal.</b> From the knowledge of the original and the modified signal statistics, the receiver is able to perform the inverse operation of the transmitter, recovering the <b>video</b> <b>signal</b> and the data. Three novel systems are proposed for embedding data into analogue pictures. Two of these systems are capable of supporting an average of 17430 and 8713 bits per (256 x 256) image LV respectively, with excellent recovered picture quality. The third system produced a constant number of bits per image, with a slight degradation in the recovered picture quality but, with a capability of conveying up to about 0. 5 mega bits/sec of data. The idea and technique of embedding data into analogue signals was then carried on to the digital method of coding <b>video</b> <b>signals</b> using differential <b>pulse</b> code modulation. However, the scrambling technique here was used to obtain a novel switched quantization scheme, with forward estimation, without the necessity of sending any side information. Scrambling was performed on the quantizer output levels by inversion. Initially, experiments were carried out using fixed length code words with one and two dimensional predictors. Blocks of quantizer output levels are scrambled, or not, depending on which quantizer was used in encoding the <b>video</b> <b>signal.</b> Hence the switching information was carried by the quantized block of error signals. This type of set-up produced only modest improvements. The quantizers were then altered by using a different number of levels and the switching information was carried one block of quantized error signals in advance. As a result, the average bit rate was reduced to about 2. 7 bits/pel using a one dimensional predictor with exceptionally good subjective picture quality. When used with a two dimensional predictor, the scheme produced an average bit rate of about 1. 7 bits/pel with excellent subjective picture quality...|$|R

5000|$|Video {{modulation}} is {{a strategy}} of transmitting <b>video</b> <b>signal</b> {{in the field of}} radio modulation and television technology. This strategy enables the <b>video</b> <b>signal</b> to be transmitted more efficiently through long distances. In general, video modulation means that a higher frequency carrier wave is modified according to the original <b>video</b> <b>signal.</b> In this way, carrier wave contains the information in the <b>video</b> <b>signal.</b> Then, the carrier will [...] "carry" [...] the information in the form of radio frequency (RF) signal.

The novel amplification scheme has the potential to create multi-PW, two-cycle light pulses thus surpassing the limits of current laser technology. At intensities of 10 15 W/cm 2 - 10 18 W/cm 2, a short <b>signal</b> <b>pulse</b> of 20 - 40 fs duration is directly amplified in a plasma by a counter-propagating, picosecond-long, blue-shifted pump pulse.

The electrons start oscillating along the propagation axis and are quickly arranged to a transient density grating. The grating reflects a part of the pump pulse coherently back into the <b>signal</b> <b>pulse.</b> The ongoing oscillations of the electrons destroy the grating again, which leads to a further shortening of the <b>signal</b> <b>pulse.</b> In the framework of this thesis, the complete experiment including the diagnostics has been set up at the MPI für Quantenoptik using the Advanced Ti:Sapphire Laser (ATLAS) as a source for the pump and <b>signal</b> <b>pulses.</b> Each of the pulses is focused from opposite directions into a hydrogen gas jet, which is quickly ionized by the pedestal of the pump pulse.
