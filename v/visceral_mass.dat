40|$|Bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), potent {{inducers}} of inflammation, {{have been}} associated with chronic metabolic disturbances. Obesity is linked to dyslipidemia, increased body adiposity, and endotoxemia. We investigated the cross-sectional relationships between serum LPS activity and body adiposity as well as inflammation in 242 subjects with type 1 diabetes. Body fat distribution was measured by DXA and serum LPS activity by the limulus amebocyte lysate end-point assay. Since no interaction between <b>visceral</b> fat <b>mass</b> and sex was observed, data were pooled for the subsequent analyses. LPS was independently associated with <b>visceral</b> fat <b>mass,</b> when adjusted for traditional risk factors (age, sex, kidney status, hsCRP, insulin sensitivity). In the multivariate analysis, serum LPS activity and triglyceride concentrations had a joint effect on <b>visceral</b> fat <b>mass,</b> independent of these factors alone. A combination of high LPS and high hsCRP concentrations was also observed in those with the largest <b>visceral</b> fat <b>mass.</b> In conclusion, high serum LPS activity levels were associated with <b>visceral</b> fat <b>mass</b> in subjects with type 1 diabetes strengthening its {{role in the development of}} central obesity, inflammation and insulin resistance...|$|R

Method: Twenty-five female Wistar rats, were divided into the following groups (n =  5 rats each) : control (untreated) group (C); depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) group; DMPA group received vitamin C (at dose 0. 2  mg/g; 0. 4  mg/g; 0. 8  mg/g) and vitamin E (0. 04  IU/g). The treatment with combined vitamin C and E was performed for four weeks. Analysis of leptin serum level was done by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technically. <b>Visceral</b> fat <b>mass</b> was measured by Ohauss scales. Analysis of malondialdehyde (MDA) level in visceral fat was done by spectrophotometer. Results: The level of serum leptin and <b>visceral</b> fat <b>mass</b> was not significantly different between groups (P >  0. 05).

40|$|Patients with {{inflammatory}} bowel disease show a lower lean {{body mass}} and an increased body fat mass compared to healthy controls. Additionally, studies demonstrated an increased <b>visceral</b> fat <b>mass</b> in patients with Crohn's disease (CD). This phenomenon, in which the inflamed intestine is surrounded by an increased amount of visceral fat, was first described in 1932 by B. Crohn. Causes, mechanisms and clinical significance of these findings {{have not yet been}} recognized sufficiently in research. Recent studies postulated, that adipocytes in hypertrophic mesenteric fat secrete cyto-kines, which could be actively involved in the pathogenesis of CD. The accumulation of visceral adipose tissue is discussed even as a primary event in CD. Currently, it remains unclear whether the hypertrophy of mesenteric adipose tissue is cause or consequence of intestinal inflammation. From a clinical perspective, these publications raise several questions: Is disease-activity of CD-patients associated with <b>visceral</b> fat <b>mass?</b> Does <b>visceral</b> fat <b>mass</b> correlate with the disease-course or relapse-rates? Which factors impact <b>visceral</b> fat <b>mass</b> during therapy? Can <b>visceral</b> fat <b>mass</b> be quantified by ultrasound? Objective of this study was to: (I) 	 investigate differences in body composition between CD-patients and healthy sub-jects as well as between CD-patients with different duration of remission. (II) 	 investigate the association between body composition and disease activity, pheno-type, medication and disease-course in CD-patients. (III) 	 investigate whether <b>visceral</b> fat <b>mass</b> can be quantified using ultrasound. Methods: 32 CD-patients in remission and 20 healthy controls matched for sex, age and BMI were examined on body composition by Air-Dysplacement-Plethysmography and MRI. In all participants, three ultrasound-markers of <b>visceral</b> fat <b>mass</b> were meas-ured. Disease-activity was measured by CDAI, Harvey-Bradshaw-index and laboratory-markers of inflammation. Medication, future disease-activity and recurrences were as-sessed by evaluating patient-records and telephone follow-up. Results and Conclusion: CD-patients showed central fat accumulation compared to controls, which was particularly pronounced in CD-patients with short-term remission. The proportion of visceral fat and total body fat of CD-patients correlated with laboratory activity-markers and was increased in CD-patients with ileocolonic CD and in CD-patients on anti-TNF-therapy compared to CD-patients with colonic CD or without anti-TNF-therapy. The proportion of visceral fat and total body fat is possibly associated with disease-activity after 6 months.

As a result of this, understanding the determinants of left ventricular mass {{in the setting of}} obesity has both therapeutic and prognostic implications. Using cardiovascular magnetic resonance our goal was to elucidate the main predictors of left ventricular mass in severely obese subjects free of additional cardiovascular risk factors. METHODS: 38 obese (BMI 37. 8 +/- 6. 9 kg/m 2) and 16 normal weight controls subjects, (BMI 21. 7 +/- 1. 8 kg/m 2), all without cardiovascular risk factors, underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging to assess left ventricular mass, left ventricular volumes and <b>visceral</b> fat <b>mass.</b> Left ventricular mass was then compared to serum and anthropometric markers of obesity linked to left ventricular mass, i. e. height, age, blood pressure, total fat <b>mass,</b> <b>visceral</b> fat <b>mass,</b> lean mass, serum leptin and fasting insulin level. RESULTS: As expected, obesity was associated with significantly increased left ventricular mass (126 +/- 27 vs 90 +/- 20 g; p < 0. 001). Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that over 75 % of the cross sectional variation in left ventricular mass can be explained by lean body mass (beta = 0. 51, p < 0. 001), LV stroke volume (beta = 0. 31 p = 0. 001) and abdominal <b>visceral</b> fat <b>mass</b> (beta = 0. 20, p = 0. 02), all of which showed highly significant independent associations with left ventricular mass (overall R 2 = 0. 77). CONCLUSION: The left ventricular hypertrophic response to obesity in the absence of additional cardiovascular risk factors is mainly attributable to increases in lean body mass, LV stroke volume and <b>visceral</b> fat <b>mass.</b> In view of the well documented link between obesity, left ventricular hypertrophy and mortality, these findings have potentially important prognostic and therapeutic implications for primary and secondary prevention...|$|R

40|$|Objective: to {{test the}} {{hypotheses}} that decreased insulin-mediated glucose disposal in muscle {{is associated with a}} reduced muscle microvascular exchange capacity (Kf) and that 6 months of high-dose statin therapy would improve microvascular function in people with central obesity. Research design and methods: we assessed skeletal muscle microvascular function, <b>visceral</b> fat <b>mass,</b> physical activity levels, fitness, and insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle in 22 female and 17 male volunteers with central obesity whose age (mean ± SD) was 51 ± 9 years. We tested the effect of atorvastatin (40 mg daily) on muscle microvascular function in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial lasting 6 months. Results: Kf was negatively associated with a measure of glycemia (A 1 C; r = ? 0. 44, P = 0. 006) and positively associated with insulin sensitivity (the ratio of insulin-stimulated glucose effectiveness, or M value, to the mean insulin concentration, or I value; r = 0. 39, P = 0. 02). In regression modeling, A 1 C, <b>visceral</b> fat <b>mass,</b> and M:I explained 38 % of the variance in Kf (in a linear regression model with Kf as the outcome [R 2 = 0. 38, P = 0. 005]). M:I was associated with Kf independently of <b>visceral</b> fat <b>mass</b> (B coefficient 3. 13 [95 % CI 0. 22 – 6. 02], P = 0. 036).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} effects of aging and {{physical}} activity on distribution patterns in subcutaneous and visceral fat. METHODS: Distributions of subcutaneous rat mass at six segments (face and neck, forearm, upper arm, trunk, thigh, and lower leg) were determined by adipose tissue thickness measurements by B mode ultrasonogram and body surface areas. <b>Visceral</b> fat <b>mass</b> was calculated by subtracting subcutaneous fat mass from the total fat mass determined hydrodensitometrically. Measurements were made on young and middle aged, trained and sedentary women (four groups). RESULTS: Per cent body fat was lower in trained than in sedentary individuals, both in the young and the middle aged subjects. The distribution of subcutaneous fat mass differed between sedentary and trained women. Trained young women had a reduced subcutaneous fat mass compared to sedentary young subjects in all segments except face and neck; the disparity between middle aged sedentary and trained women was limited to upper arm and trunk (P < 0. 01 each), with no significant difference in face and neck, forearm, and lower limb segments. Differences in <b>visceral</b> fat <b>mass</b> between sedentary and trained subjects were similar for young and middle aged women (young, 2. 5 v 3. 7 kg; middle aged, 4. 0 v 6. 5 kg).

5000|$|Torsion is a {{gastropod}} synapomorphy {{which occurs}} in all gastropods during larval development. Torsion is {{the rotation of}} the <b>visceral</b> <b>mass,</b> mantle, and shell 180˚ with respect to the head and foot of the gastropod. This brings the mantle cavity and anus to an anterior position above the head.|$|E
50|$|There are two {{different}} developmental stages which cause torsion. The first stage {{is caused by the}} development of the asymmetrical velar/foot muscle which has one end attached to {{the left side of the}} shell and the other end has fibres attached to the left side of the foot and head. At a certain point in larval development this muscle contracts, causing an anticlockwise rotation of the <b>visceral</b> <b>mass</b> and mantle of roughly 90˚. This process is very rapid, taking from a few minutes to a few hours. After this transformation the second stage of torsion development is achieved by differential tissue growth of the left hand side of the organism compared to the right hand side. This second stage is much slower and rotates the <b>visceral</b> <b>mass</b> and mantle a further 90˚. Detorsion is brought about by reversal of the above phases.|$|E

Differences between males and females in the association of MDD with obesity may contribute to inconsistent results. Thus, {{this study was designed to}} determine whether sex has a differential effect on the relationship between MDD and obesity, and to explore the potential mechanisms. MethodsAll participants were diagnosed with MDD, and depression severity was measured using the 17 -item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Body weight and height were measured to calculate body mass index (BMI). Body composition, including total fat, trunk fat, android fat, and <b>visceral</b> fat <b>mass,</b> was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Subjects provided blood samples, and serum was extracted for measuring the inflammatory factors using human immunoassay kits. ResultsAmong all obesity measures, depressed women had greater BMI and total body fat. By contrast, depressed men had greater <b>visceral</b> fat <b>mass.</b> However, only in depressed women was depression correlated with several measures of obesity, including BMI, total body fat, and <b>visceral</b> fat <b>mass.</b> A stepwise multiple regression analysis was conducted, and only visceral fat entered the regression model and was most predictive of depression in women (β[*]=[*] 0. 60, p[*]=[*] 0. 007). Moreover, compared with depressed men, depressed women had higher leptin levels after controlling for BMI, total body fat, and visceral fat. ConclusionThese results highlight gender differences in determining the association between obesity and depression, and elevated leptin level is a potential mechanism linking MDD to obesity in depressed women.
