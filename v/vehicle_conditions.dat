Lotus Cars developed several prototypes, from 1982 onwards, and introduced them to F1, where they have been fairly effective, but have now been banned. Nissan introduced a low bandwidth {{active suspension}} in circa 1990 as an option that added an extra 20% to the price of luxury models. Citroën has also developed several active suspension models (see hydractive). A recently publicised fully active system from Bose Corporation uses linear electric motors (i.e., solenoids) in place of hydraulic or pneumatic actuators that have generally been used up until recently. Mercedes introduced an active suspension system called Active Body Control in its top-of-the-line Mercedes-Benz CL-Class in 1999.|$|E
40|$|Dynamic {{behaviors}} of the steel lining of curved tunnels with various curvatures are throughly examined to see the effect of wind loads due to consecutively passing vehicles. The wind pressure upon the lining is simplified into the pressure and suction while the vehicles are passing the specific positions. Results from cases of sole driving and consecutive driving conditions for both curved and straight tunnels are compared. It is found that the maximum displacements occur at middle location of the tunnel, and that the responses from consecutive passing vehicles increase compared to those from the single <b>vehicle</b> <b>conditions</b> for all tunnels. It is {{also found that the}} responses increase at the higher speed of passing vehicles while the responses decrease as the curvatures increase.

40|$|Drivers ’ hip {{locations}} (HLs) and eye locations (ELs) {{have been}} used as reference data to design an ergonomic automobile interior. Although many prediction models of a driver’s HL and EL have been developed, the developed models have limitations in terms of prediction accuracy and stability. The objectives of the present study are (1) development of statistical geometric models (SGMs) of a driver’s HL and EL, and (2) evaluation of the accuracy of the SGMs. Forty drivers ’ preferred driving postures were measured by a motion capture system in 3 different <b>vehicle</b> <b>conditions</b> (coupe, sedan, and SUV). The SGMs were developed by incorporating the geometric relationships between HL, EL, anthropometric dimensions, and driving postures and the statistical relationships between body link lengths and surface landmark lengths. The SGMs were evaluated quantitatively by comparing the Reed et al. (2002) ’s models in terms of prediction accuracy. As a result, the average adj. R 2 of SGMs is 1. 1 ~ 3. 7 times higher than Reed et al. ’s models and root mean squared error (RMSE) of the SGMs is 1. 7 ~ 1. 8 times smaller than the Reed et al. ’s models. Moreover, RMSE of the SGMs in three <b>vehicle</b> <b>conditions</b> are 1. 7 ~ 4. 3 times smaller than the Reed et al. ’s models. These results indicate that the accuracy of the SGMs are more accurate and stable than the Reed et al. ’s models in all three <b>vehicle</b> <b>conditions.</b> The developed SGMs have high applicability to the ergonomic design of automobile interiors such as the seat adjustment range and windshield height...|$|E
