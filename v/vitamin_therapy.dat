40|$|ABSTRACT. Records of 103 {{consecutive}} admissions to {{a general}} medical ward over 4 months in a Veterans Administra-tion Medical Center were reviewed. Assessment was made of nutritional status and potential need for supplemental <b>vitamin</b> <b>therapy</b> based upon predetermined criteria. Thirty-five of the 103 patients received one or more vitamin supplements. No patient received unnecessary vitamins as defined by our crite-ria. However, 48 patients had indications for vitamin supple-mentation, but did not receive any. Analysis of data by indi-cation for <b>vitamin</b> <b>therapy</b> revealed 125 indications for <b>vitamin</b> <b>therapy</b> in 83 patients. Of the 125 indications 54 were treated appropriately, {{but there were no}} vitamin prescriptions in 71 indicated instances.

40|$|OBJECTIVE — Antioxidant {{trials have}} not {{demonstrated}} efficacy in slowing cardiovascular dis-ease {{but could not}} rule out benefit for specific patient subgroups. Antioxidant therapy reduces LDL oxidizability in haptoglobin 1 allele homozygotes (Hp 1 - 1), but not in individuals with the hapto-globin 2 allele (Hp 2 - 1 or Hp 2 - 2). We therefore hypothesized that haptoglobin type would be predictive {{of the effect of}} <b>vitamin</b> <b>therapy</b> on coronary atherosclerosis as assessed by angiography. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — We tested this hypothesis in the Women’s Angiographic Vitamin and Estrogen (WAVE) trial, a prospective angiographic study of vitamins C and E with or without hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in postmenopausal women. Haptoglobin type was determined in 299 women who underwent baseline and follow-up an-giography.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Clinical and {{demographic}} variables are poor predictors of treatment adherence. This study therefore examined {{the relationships between}} the patients' perception of their cystic fibrosis and their reported adherence to physiotherapy, exercise, pancreatic enzyme and <b>vitamin</b> <b>therapies.</b> METHODS: Sixty adults with cystic fibrosis completed the Health Perception Scale, Health Locus of Control Scale, and the Manchester Adult Cystic Fibrosis Compliance Questionnaire. RESULTS: Reported adherence to physiotherapy, exercise, pancreatic enzyme and <b>vitamin</b> <b>therapies</b> was not influenced by patients' perceptions of their past, current and future disease severity, or their perceived susceptibility to recurrent infections. The greater their level of worry regarding their disease, the more likely they were to adhere to their physiotherapy (p < 0. 002), pancreatic enzyme (p < 0. 001) and vitamin (p < 0. 001) regimens. No difference between the exercise adherent and non-adherent groups emerged regarding their level of worry. Compared with patients who believed that they were in control of their health, those who believed that their cystic fibrosis was controlled by others (family and health professionals) reported greater levels of adherence to their physiotherapy (p < 0. 001), pancreatic enzyme (p < 0. 001) and vitamin (p < 0. 001) therapies. In contrast, patients who adhered to their exercise regimen believed that they were in control of their disease {{to a greater extent than}} those who did not (p < 0. 003).

40|$|A copious {{amount of}} {{scientific}} scrutiny has been dedicated to documenting typical and atypical human ageing, with a substantial {{body of work}} focusing upon the impact of lifestyle choices. One such lifestyle choice is that of diet and, in particular, micronutrient ingestion. Epidemiological studies have reported positive associations between B vitamin status and cognitive function, including negative associations between biological markers (i. e., homocysteine) of dysregulated one-carbon metabolism and cognitive function. This {{has led to a}} surge of randomised control trials (RCTs) investigations into B <b>vitamin</b> <b>therapy.</b> However, results have continuingly failed to show beneficial behavioural effects.

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESFirst, {{we sought}} to {{study the effects of}} short- and {{long-term}} <b>vitamin</b> C <b>therapy</b> on oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction in chronic heart failure (CHF), and second, {{we sought to}} investigate the role of neutrophils as a cause of oxidative stress in CHF. BACKGROUNDOxidative stress may contribute to endothelial dysfunction in CHF. Vitamin C ameliorates endothelial dysfunction in CHF, presumably by reducing oxidative stress, but this is unproven. METHODSWe studied 55 patients with CHF (ischemic and nonischemic etiologies) and 15 control subjects. Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) in the brachial artery was measured by ultrasound wall-tracking, neutrophil superoxide anion (O 2 −) generation by lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence and oxidative stress by measurement of free radicals (FRs) in venous blood using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and plasma thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). Measurements were performed at baseline in all subjects. The effects of short-term (intravenous) and long-term (oral) <b>vitamin</b> C <b>therapy</b> versus placebo were tested in patients with nonischemic CHF. RESULTSAt baseline, FRs were higher in patients with CHF than in control subjects (p < 0. 01), TBARS were greater (p < 0. 005), neutrophil O 2 −-generating capacity was enhanced (p < 0. 005) and FMD was lower (p < 0. 0001). Compared with placebo, short-term <b>vitamin</b> C <b>therapy</b> reduced FR levels (p < 0. 05), tended to reduce TBARS and increased FMD (p < 0. 05), but did not affect neutrophil O 2 −-generating capacity. Long-term <b>vitamin</b> C <b>therapy</b> reduced FR levels (p < 0. 05), reduced TBARS (p < 0. 05) and improved FMD (p < 0. 05), but also reduced neutrophil O 2 −-generating capacity (p < 0. 05). Endothelial dysfunction was not related to oxidative stress, and improvements in FMD with <b>vitamin</b> C <b>therapy</b> did not relate to reductions in oxidative stress. CONCLUSIONSOxidative stress is increased in ischemic and nonischemic CHF, and neutrophils may be an important cause. Vitamin C reduces oxidative stress, increases FMD and, when given long term, decreases neutrophil O 2 − generation, but the lack of a correlation between changes in endothelial function and oxidative stress with vitamin C implies possible additional non-antioxidant benefits of vitamin C...|$|R
40|$|Early {{clinical}} {{studies showed that}} high-dose vitamin C, given by intravenous and oral routes, may improve symptoms and prolong life in patients with terminal cancer. Double-blind placebo-controlled studies of oral <b>vitamin</b> C <b>therapy</b> showed no benefit. Recent evidence shows that oral administration of the maximum tolerated dose of vitamin C (18 g/d) produces peak plasma concentrations of only 220 μmol/L, whereas intravenous administration of the same dose produces plasma concentrations about 25 -fold higher. Larger doses (50 – 100 g) given intravenously may result in plasma concentrations of about 14 000 μmol/L. At concentrations above 1000 μmol/L, vitamin C is toxic to some cancer cells but not to normal cells in vitro. We found 3 well-documented cases of advanced cancers, confirmed by histopathologic review, where patients had unexpectedly long survival times after receiving high-dose intravenous <b>vitamin</b> C <b>therapy.</b> We examined clinical details of each case in accordance with National Cancer Institute (NCI) Best Case Series guidelines.

40|$|Background—Hyperlipidemia is {{associated}} with endothelial dysfunction, an early event in atherosclerosis and predictor of risk for future coronary artery disease. Epidemiological studies suggest that increased dietary intake of antioxidants {{reduces the risk of}} coronary artery disease. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether antioxidant <b>vitamin</b> <b>therapy</b> improves endothelial function and affects surrogate biomarkers for oxidative stress and inflammation in hyperlipidemic children. Methods and Results—In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the effects of antioxidant vitamins C (500 mg/d) and E (400 IU/d) for 6 weeks and the National Cholesterol Education Program Step II (NCEP-II) diet for 6 months on endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery were examined in 15 children with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) or the phenotype of familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCH). Antioxidant <b>vitamin</b> <b>therapy</b> improved FMD of the brachial artery compared with baseline (P 0. 001) without an effect on biomarkers for oxidative stress (autoantibodies to epitopes of oxidized LDL, F 2 -isoprostanes, 8 -hydroxy- 2 -deoxyguanosine), inflam-mation (C-reactive protein), or levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine, an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide. Conclusions—Antioxidant therapy with vitamins C and E restores endothelial function in hyperlipidemic children.
