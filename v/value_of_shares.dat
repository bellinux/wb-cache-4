40|$|Abstract The price <b>of</b> equity <b>shares</b> {{depends on}} the two basic factors, demand and supply. Price fluctuates with the {{phenomenon}} of buying and selling. Prices usually move up with buying and go down with selling <b>of</b> equity <b>shares.</b> Many accounting variables affect market <b>value</b> <b>of</b> equity <b>share</b> and Earnings Per <b>Share</b> is one <b>of</b> them. The purpose {{of this research is}} to find out the effect <b>of</b> Earning Per <b>Share</b> (EPS) on the Market <b>Value</b> <b>of</b> <b>Share</b> (MVS) and their mutual relationship. The targeted population was the Pakistani Cement industries that were listed in the Stock Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP). The thirteen Cement industries were selected for the analysis and secondary data was used for this purpose. The data was analyzed through SPSS software and represented in the form of tables and graphs. The finding shows that Earning Per Share (EPS) significantly impact the Market <b>Value</b> <b>of</b> <b>Share.</b> This study improves the understanding <b>of</b> <b>share</b> prices in broadening the base <b>of</b> market <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>share,</b> which may assist in creating a better investment culture in country that translates economy into a robust economy.

Most companies undertake an IPO with the assistance of an investment banking firm acting in the capacity of an underwriter. Underwriters provide several services, including help with correctly assessing the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> (share price) and establishing a public market for shares (initial sale). Alternative methods such as the dutch auction have also been explored. In terms of size and public participation, the two most notable examples of this method is the Google IPO and Snapchat's parent company Snap Inc. China has recently emerged as a major IPO market, with several of the largest IPOs taking place in that country.|$|E

One method, used by Yerkes to raise £7million, was [...] "profit-sharing secured notes", a form of bond which was secured against the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares.</b> They were sold at a 4 per cent discount, paid 5 per cent interest and were due for repayment in 1908.

2500|$|The Stock Market Crash of 1929 {{is often}} cited as the {{beginning}} of the Great Depression. It began on October 24, 1929, and was the most devastating stock market crash {{in the history of the}} United States. Much of the stock market crash can be attributed to exuberance and false expectations. In the years leading up to 1929, the rising stock market prices had created vast sums of wealth for those invested, in turn encouraging borrowing to further buy more stock. However, on October 24 (Black Thursday), share prices began to fall and panic selling caused prices to fall sharply. On October 29 (Black Tuesday), share prices fell by $14 billion in a single day, more than $30 billion in the week. [...] The value that evaporated the week was 10x more than the entire federal budget and more than all of what the U.S. spent on World War I. By 1930 the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> had fallen by 90%.|$|E
2500|$|Management {{must also}} choose {{the form of}} the {{dividend}} distribution, generally as cash dividends or via a share buyback. Various factors may be taken into consideration: where shareholders must pay tax on dividends, firms may elect to retain earnings or to perform a stock buyback, in both cases increasing the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> outstanding. Alternatively, some companies will pay [...] "dividends" [...] from stock rather than in cash; see Corporate action. [...] Financial theory suggests that the dividend policy should be set based upon the type of company and what management determines is the best use of those dividend resources for the firm to its shareholders. [...] As a general rule, shareholders of growth companies would prefer managers to retain earnings and pay no dividends (use excess cash to reinvest into the company's operations), whereas shareholders of value or secondary stocks would prefer the management of these companies to payout surplus earnings in the form of cash dividends when a positive return cannot be earned through the reinvestment of undistributed earnings. [...] A share buyback program may be accepted when the value of the stock is greater than the returns to be realized from the reinvestment of undistributed profits. [...] In all instances, the appropriate dividend policy is usually directed by that which maximizes long-term shareholder value.|$|E

60|$|It was {{generally}} {{said at the}} clubs that Mr Alf had written this article himself. Old Splinter, {{who was one of}} a body of men possessing an excellent cellar of wine and calling themselves Paides Pallados, and who had written for the heavy quarterlies any time this last forty years, professed that he saw through the article. The 'Evening Pulpit' had been, he explained, desirous of going as far as it could in denouncing Mr Melmotte without incurring the danger of an action for libel. Mr Splinter thought that the thing was clever but mean. These new publications generally were mean. Mr Splinter was constant in that opinion; but, putting the meanness aside, he thought that the article was well done. According to his view it was intended to expose Mr Melmotte and the railway. But the Paides Pallados generally did not agree with him. Under such an interpretation, what had been the meaning of that paragraph in which the writer had declared that the work of joining one ocean to another was worthy of the nearest approach to divinity that had been granted to men? Old Splinter chuckled and gabbled as he heard this, and declared that there was not wit enough left now even among the Paides Pallados to understand a shaft of irony. There could be no doubt, however, at the time, that the world did not go with old Splinter, and that the article served to enhance the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> in the great railway enterprise.|$|E
