25|$|On September 30, 2014, Microsoft {{announced}} Windows 10 as {{the successor}} to Windows 8.1. It was released on July 29, 2015, and addresses shortcomings in the user interface first introduced with Windows 8. Changes include {{the return of the}} Start Menu, a <b>virtual</b> <b>desktop</b> system, and the ability to run Windows Store apps within windows on the desktop rather than in full-screen mode. Windows 10 is said to be available to update from qualified Windows 7 with SP1 and Windows 8.1 computers from the Get Windows 10 Application (for Windows 7, Windows 8.1) or Windows Update (Windows 7).|$|E
25|$|All system icons are {{scalable}} up to 512×512 pixels as of version 10.5 {{to accommodate}} various {{places where they}} appear in larger size, including for example the Cover Flow view, a three-dimensional graphical user interface included with iTunes, the Finder, and other Apple products for visually skimming through files and digital media libraries via cover artwork. That version also introduced Spaces, a <b>virtual</b> <b>desktop</b> implementation which enables the user {{to have more than}} one desktop and display them in an Exposé-like interface; an automatic backup technology called Time Machine, which provides the ability to view and restore previous versions of files and application data; and Screen Sharing was built in for the first time.|$|E

50|$|Previous to the {{availability}} of ZUI toolkits, the <b>virtual</b> <b>desktops</b> feature of many window managers provided some of the organizational benefits of ZUIs. <b>Virtual</b> <b>desktops</b> differ from ZUIs in that they don't provide a physical metaphor of continuous zooming but a collection of separate, fixed size <b>desktop</b> containers. <b>Virtual</b> <b>desktops</b> functions are available by default in KDE, GNOME and Mac OS X Leopard, and through an add-on in Microsoft Windows XP.|$|R
50|$|Although Spaces was a {{new feature}} for Mac OS 10.5, <b>virtual</b> <b>desktops</b> existed {{for quite some time}} on other platforms, such as Linux, Solaris, AIX and BeOS. <b>Virtual</b> <b>desktops</b> also existed for Windows and for the Mac OS via third party software., and it has been a {{standard}} feature on Linux desktops for a number of years. The first platform to implement multiple desktop display as a hardware feature was the Amiga 1000, released in 1985. <b>Virtual</b> <b>Desktops</b> were finally added to the Windows platform with Windows 10 in 2015.|$|R
500|$|Screenshots of a Windows build which {{purported to}} be Threshold were leaked in July 2014, showing the {{previously}} presented Start menu and windowed Windows Store apps followed by a further screenshot in September 2014 of a build identifying itself as [...] "Windows Technical Preview", numbered 9834, showing a new <b>virtual</b> <b>desktop</b> system, a notification center, and a new File Explorer icon.|$|E
500|$|A notable {{multimedia}} {{software program}} produced by Delrina was Echo Lake, an early form of scrapbook software {{that came out}} in June 1995. During development it was touted internally as a [...] "cross [...] Quark Xpress and Myst". It featured an immersive 3D environment where a user could manipulate objects within a <b>virtual</b> <b>desktop</b> in a virtual office and assemble video and audio clips along with images, and then send them as either a virtual book other users of the program could then access, or its content could be printed. It was an innovative product for its time, and ultimately was hampered by the inability of many users to easily input or playback their own multimedia content into a computer from that period.|$|E
500|$|Windows 10 {{introduces}} what Microsoft {{described as}} [...] "universal apps"; expanding on Metro-style apps, these apps {{can be designed}} to run across multiple Microsoft product families with nearly identical codeincluding PCs, tablets, smartphones, embedded systems, Xbox One, Surface Hub and Mixed Reality. The Windows user interface was revised to handle transitions between a mouse-oriented interface and a touchscreen-optimized interface based on available input devicesparticularly on 2-in-1 PCs; both interfaces include an updated Start menu which incorporates elements of Windows 7's traditional Start menu with the tiles of Windows 8. The first release of Windows 10 also introduces a <b>virtual</b> <b>desktop</b> system, a window and desktop management feature called Task View, the Microsoft Edge web browser, support for fingerprint and face recognition login, new security features for enterprise environments, and DirectX 12 and WDDM 2.0 to improve the operating system's graphics capabilities for games.|$|E

500|$|A new {{iteration}} of the Start menu {{is used on}} the Windows 10 desktop, with a list {{of places}} and other options on the left side, and tiles representing applications on the right. The menu can be resized, and expanded into a full-screen display, which is the default option in Tablet mode. A new <b>virtual</b> <b>desktop</b> system was added. A feature known as Task View displays all open windows and allows users to switch between them, or switch between multiple workspaces. Windows Store apps, which previously could be used only in full screen mode, can now be used in self-contained windows similarly to other programs. Program windows can now be snapped to quadrants of the screen by dragging them to the corner. When a window is snapped {{to one side of the}} screen, Task View appears and the user is prompted to choose a second window to fill the unused side of the screen (called [...] "Snap Assist"). Windows' system icons were also changed.|$|E
2500|$|Although RDS is shipped {{with most}} editions of all {{versions}} of Windows NT since Windows 2000, its functionality differs in each version. Windows XP Home Edition {{does not accept}} any RDC connections at all, reserving RDS for Fast User Switching and Remote Assistance only. Other client versions of Windows only allow a maximum of one remote user to connect to the system {{at the cost of}} the user who has logged onto the console being disconnected. Windows Server allows two users to connect at the same time. This licensing scheme, called [...] "Remote Desktop for Administration", facilitates administration of unattended or headless computers. Only by acquiring additional licenses (in addition to that of Windows) can a computer running Windows Server service multiple remote users at one time and achieve <b>virtual</b> <b>desktop</b> infrastructure.|$|E
