40|$|A concept on {{integration}} of 3 D visual and auditory rendering is proposed in this paper. By the auditory rendering we mean the computer acoustical simulation with direct sound outputs {{that is based}} on the physical model simulation. The so-called visual rendering means the computer generation of 3 D visual and auditory rendering we mean while computer generates a 3 D image of physical model of real world, it generates the sound based on the phusical model displayed if there is a reverberation-free sound source. Based on some kinds of similarity between the progagation nature of light and sound, a modified radiosity algorithm has been proposed for integration implementation. The algorithm is suitable for both visual and room auditory rendering. It means for a biven enclosure, once the form factors are calculated, they can be applied for calculating both the light radiosities and sound radiosities simultaneously. The features of the algorithm are indicated. The implementation techniques are given in detail. The {{integration of}} visual and auditory rendering is a big <b>scientific</b> <b>computing</b> (ViSC) to <b>visualization</b> and audiobilization <b>in</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>computing</b> (VAiSC).

40|$|INTRODUCTION Scientific {{visualization}} is {{a domain}} of computer science whose {{goal is to}} promote visual conceptualization {{in the process of}} scientific investigation. As a National Science Foundation report on <b>Visualization</b> <b>in</b> <b>Scientific</b> <b>Computing</b> states: The ability of scientists to visualize complex computations and simulations is absolutely essential to insure the integrity of analyses, to provoke insights and to communicate those insights with others (McCormick, et al. (1987)). Interactivity is fundamental to scientific visualization. The scientific method is by nature an interactive and iterative process, and thus requires interactive graphics environments which interfere as little as possible with the scientist's explorations. Researchers from diverse fields including fluid dynamics (Helman and Hesselink (1989)), medical research (Fuchs, et al. (1989)), and the earth sciences (Hibbard and Santek (1989)) have remarked upon the importance of the ability to in...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} survey of multidimensional multivariate (mdmv) {{visualization}} techniques developed {{during the last three}} decades. This subfield of scientific visualization deals with the analysis of data with multiple parameters or factors, and the key relationships among them.

Recently developed techniques are explored with examples. 1 Introduction Multidimensional multivariate visualization is an important subfield of scientific visualization. It was studied separately by statisticians and psychologists long before computer science was deemed a discipline. The appearance of low-priced personal computers and workstations during the 1980 's breathed new life into graphical analysis of mdmv data.

40|$|We {{present a}} method for the {{definition}} of multiple views in 3 D interfaces for computational steering. The method uses {{the concept of a}} point-based parametrizable camera object. This concept enables a user to create and configure multiple views on his custom 3 D interface in an intuitive graphical manner. Each view can be coupled to objects present in the interface, parametrized to (simulation) data, or adjusted through direct manipulation or user defined camera controls. Although our focus is on 3 D interfaces for computational steering, we think that the concept is valuable for many other 3 D graphics applications as well. 1991 Computing Reviews Classification System: I. 3. 2, I. 3. 4, I. 6. 6, I. 6. 7 Keywords and Phrases: scientific visualization, viewing, interactive 3 D computer graphics.

40|$|Typically, {{discussions of}} data {{visualization}} extol the wonderful {{powers of the}} human eye. Apparently instantaneous perception of structures in visual displays of data is contrasted to the unintelligibility of masses of numbers in traditional computer outputs. Period. Little is said about what the powers of that eye might actually be, or—more importantly—about the limits on those powers. If the full potential of our investments in visualization is to be realized, {{we need to understand}} much more both about the perceptual characteristics of the human visual system and about the integration of the perception of data displays into complex scientific thought processes. This paper outlines some of the research issues and questions that must be addressed to gain that improved understanding. To a psychologist, such as myself, who has studied human sensitivity to various kinds of visual structure (Chipman, 1977, Chipman & Mendelson, 1979), it is striking that the illustrations of visual power almost always show strong symmetry or approximate symmetry. Consider the cover illustration of the NSF report on the <b>Visualization</b> <b>in</b> <b>Scientific</b> <b>Computing</b> (McCormick, DeFanti, & Brown, 1987). Human vision is extremely sensitive to symmetry. There is a large psychological literature demonstrating the impact of symmetry on almost any visual task—fro...|$|E

The significance of <b>visualization</b> <b>in</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>computing</b> is to increase data processing speed significantly, make the information from mass of data discovery and display to be better and make abstract data much easier to understand.

40|$|Visualization or <b>Visualization</b> <b>in</b> <b>Scientific</b> <b>Computing</b> is {{a rapidly}} growing area in {{computer}} science. Visualization is the process and result of viewing data and numbers as a diagram or drawing. Arie Kaufman sums up visualization by stating: ``It encompasses and unifies the fields of Computer Graphics, image processing, computer vision, signal processing, computer aided design, and human-machine interaction. Visualization is a method of extracting meaningful information from complex or voluminous datasets {{through the use of}} interactive graphics and imaging. It provides processes for steering the dataset and seeing the unseen, thereby enriching existing scientific methods'', (Arie Kaufman, Preface, Visualization ' 90). Over the past few years visualization has spread into multiple disciplines and many diverse visualization systems and environments have been designed. This thesis describes many aspects of visualization, focusing on Abstractional visualization. An abstraction in terms of computer graphics and visualization is an image that has been transformed from an original form; often the abstraction is created by losing one or more features from the original instance. For example, the London Underground map is an abstraction of the geographical map (itself in turn an abstraction of the `real' landmarks). The design of the underground map loses the exact positioning information of each of the stations; the connectivity of the railway tracks remains however and the map can be said to be clearer and easier to understand than the original geographical map [...] it has been simplified. This thesis describes aspects of visualization using this abstraction idea...|$|E
40|$|Advances in {{computer}} graphics {{in the recent}} twenty years have stimulated different schemes to classify research directions and systems. In the early days, graphics systems were identified to be vector or raster graphics in terms of technology. Sutherland's Sketchpad system was the first example that allowed to distinguish between passive and interactive computer graphics. Dimensions of the geometric data model classified systems to be a 2 D or 3 D system. This scheme was used by standardization activities {{in computer}} graphics during the last decade. However, the approaches of standard committees to develop a reference model for computer graphics have shown very clearly that the variety of systems and the complexity within one graphics system prevents from {{the establishment of an}} easy-to-understand model. Taxonomies in scientific visualization (MzCo- 87) focussed on the integration of different disciplines like computer graphics and computer vision, and the use of available, mostly heterog eneous system components and peripherals. At least, scientific visualization has shown very clearly that computer graphics today is very different from drawing and image processing. Our understanding (Felg- 90) of scientific visualization comprises outstanding system requirements like: massive amounts of complex and multidimensional data to be processed, peripheral and algorithmic means for interactive data exploration, manifold alternative (physical and logical) visual (but also non-visual) data presentation techniques, and computational models for physical phenomena. Consequently, scientific visualization requires a correspondence between the human perception and the abstract computer-internal representation of the physical world. <b>Visualization</b> <b>in</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>computing</b> needs this correspondence, virtual reality even requires more!
