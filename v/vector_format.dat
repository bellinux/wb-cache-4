25|$|In 2004 {{two more}} storm chaser tools emerged. The first, WxWorx, {{was a new}} XM Satellite Radio based system {{utilizing}} a special receiver and Baron Services weather software. Unlike preexisting cellular based services there was no risk of dead spots, and that meant {{that even in the}} most remote areas storm chasers still had a live data feed. The second tool was a new piece of software called GRLevel3. GRLevel3 utilized both free and subscription based raw radar files, displaying the data in a true <b>vector</b> <b>format</b> with GIS layering abilities. Since 2006 a growing number of chasers are using Spotter Network (SN), which uses GPS data to plot real time position of participating spotters and chasers, and allows observers to report significant weather as well as GIS layering for navigation maps, weather products, and the like.|$|E
50|$|Vectorization is {{also used}} to recover {{information}} that was originally in a <b>vector</b> <b>format</b> but has been lost or has become unavailable. A company may have commissioned a logo from a graphic arts firm. Although the graphics firm used a <b>vector</b> <b>format,</b> the client company may not have received a copy of that format. The company may then acquire a <b>vector</b> <b>format</b> by scanning and vectorizing a paper copy of the logo.|$|E

50|$|In {{this case}} the {{directory}} entry uses 1 bit {{for a group of}} processors for each cache line. For the same example as Full Bit <b>Vector</b> <b>format</b> if we consider 1 bit for 8 processors as a group, then the storage overhead will be 128/(32×8)=50%.

50|$|The coarse bit <b>vector</b> <b>format</b> has {{a similar}} {{structure}} to the full bit <b>vector</b> <b>format,</b> though rather than tracking one bit per processor for every cache line, the directory groups several processors into nodes, storing whether a cache line is stored in a node rather than a line. This improves size requirements {{at the expense of}} bus traffic saving (processors per node)×(total lines) bits of space. Thus the ratio overhead is the same, just replacing number of processors with number of processor groups. When a bus request is made for a cache line that one processor in the group has, the directory broadcasts the signal into every processor in the node rather than just the caches that contain it, leading to unnecessary traffic to nodes that don't have the data cached.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>vector</b> <b>formats</b> implicitly support {{transparency}} {{because they}} simply avoid putting any objects {{at a given}} point. This includes EPS and WMF. Forvector graphics this may not strictly be seen as transparency, but it requiresmuch of the same careful programming as transparency in raster formats.|$|R

5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the grid format of bitmap images, <b>Vector</b> graphics file <b>formats</b> use geometric modeling to describe an image {{as a series of}} points, lines, curves, and polygons. Because the image is described using geometric data instead of fixed pixels, the image can be scaled to any size while retaining [...] "resolution independence", meaning that the image can be printed at the highest resolution a printer supports, resulting in a clear, crisp image. <b>Vector</b> file <b>formats</b> are usually superior in resolution and ease of editing as compared to bitmap file formats, but are not as widely supported by software and are not well-suited for storing pixel-specific data such as scanned photographs. In the early years of electronic clip art, vector illustrations were limited to simple line art representations. However, by the early 2000s, vector illustration tools could produce virtually the same illustrations as bitmap illustration tools, while still providing all of the advantages of <b>vector</b> file <b>formats.</b> The most common <b>vector</b> file <b>format</b> is Adobe's EPS (Encapsulated PostScript) file format. Microsoft has a much simpler, less sophisticated <b>vector</b> file <b>format</b> called WMF (Windows Metafile). The World Wide Web Consortium has developed a new, XML-based <b>vector</b> file <b>format</b> called SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) and all major modern web browsers - including Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer 9, Google Chrome, Opera, and Safari have at least some degree of support for SVG and can render the markup directly. For those with image-editing experience or interest to work with <b>vector</b> file <b>formats,</b> <b>vector</b> clip art provides the most flexible, highest quality images.|$|R
