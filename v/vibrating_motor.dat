40|$|Abstract Many {{companies}} {{have tried to}} develop the horizontally <b>vibrating</b> linear <b>motor,</b> for sliming the smart phone. Mathematical modeling and analysis is one of method to simulate the dynamic performance of the horizonatally <b>vibrating</b> linear <b>motor.</b> However, the horizontally <b>vibrating</b> linear <b>motor</b> <b>vibrates</b> in twisting mode because {{there are two kinds}} of force acting on the vibrating part. One is are the horizontal force by Lorentz force. The other is the vertical force by attraction force between magnet of vibrating part and bracket and the gravity force of vibrating part. However, those are very difficult to be included in mathematical modeling which generate the simulation errors. In this paper, we perform MFBD (multi flexible body dynamics) simulation using commercial dynamic analysis program "DAFUL". In our new model, the force effects those are neglected in mathematical model, are included. For the verification, the simulation results are compared with the experiment results with manufactured prototype...|$|R

5000|$|In the 1950s, Houghtaling {{was still}} working as a salesman, this time selling {{vibrating}} beds in which the <b>vibrating</b> <b>motor</b> and bed were sold as a single unit that was clumsy, expensive, and prone to failure. At a service call for a broken unit, Houghtaling realized that the <b>vibrating</b> <b>motor</b> was the essential component, not the bed, and that a unit could be developed that would attach to any bed, not just the combination vibrating bed units he was selling. Houghtaling worked {{in the basement of}} his Glen Rock, New Jersey, home and tested hundreds of motors before finding one that weighed relatively little, could be attached to the box springs of an existing bed, and would provide the right level of vibration. Once a quarter was inserted into the attached coin meter, the motor would vibrate the bed for 15 minutes. The coin mechanisms were modeled on similar devices that had been attached to radios and televisions in hotels. [...] The devices were sold through franchisees who installed the units in hotels based on an arrangement in which revenues would be split, with $1 million in annual sales of the units. There were 250,000 Magic Fingers units installed nationwide at their peak of popularity in the 1960s, with each unit averaging eight quarters per week, bringing in $2 million in monthly gross revenue.|$|E
50|$|There is no Rumble Pak for the Game Boy line. There {{are several}} games for Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance that support rumble. Since the Game Boy Color {{hardware}} {{does not include}} native force feedback and has no extra slot for a separate peripheral, all games supporting this feature had it built into the game cartridge itself. These games that have this feature require an extra AAA battery (in addition to the two AA batteries required to power to the Game Boy Color) that is inserted into the cartridge to power the <b>vibrating</b> <b>motor.</b>|$|E
50|$|Earlier designs used a {{rubberized}} idler-wheel drive system. However, {{wear and}} decomposition of the wheel, {{as well as}} the direct mechanical coupling to a <b>vibrating</b> <b>motor,</b> introduced low-frequency noise ("rumble") and speed variations ("wow and flutter") into the sound. These systems generally used a synchronous motor which ran at a speed synchronized to the frequency of the AC power supply. Portable record players typically used an inexpensive shaded-pole motor. At the end of the motor shaft there was a stepped driving capstan; to obtain different speeds, the rubber idler wheel was moved to contact different steps of this capstan. The idler was pinched against the bottom or inside edge of the platter to drive it.|$|E

In our experiment, a 2 D array of <b>vibrating</b> <b>motors</b> presents a stimulus to the palm. Subjects indi-cate stimulus’s position under varying visual scales and presence or lack of visual reinforcement. To model apparent systematic errors, we define a radial expansion metric, roughly the radial difference between stimulus and response.

40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the problem of {{maintaining}} a precise frequency in <b>vibrating</b> <b>motors</b> for use as vibrotactile cueing devices. Our solution utilizes a piezoelectric film sensor that measures the motor frequency and uses a feedback-loop circuit to dynamically adjust the motor power to maintain the target frequency. We confirmed the accuracy of the film with a laser sensor and tested the ability of the feedback system to match a target frequency by changing the physical load placed on the motor. A user study showed that subjects perceived a difference in vibration intensity under loaded conditions with and without our compensation system, indicating the usefulness of such a feedback system on influencing perception. The results can help designers create better interfaces when vibrotactile cues are employed...|$|R

This uses some intelligent rule-based machine fault detection algorithms developed by experts of such machine systems. Given this, the RVS machine diagnosis system involves the utilization of sensors such as thermocouples, strain gauges, accelerometers, oil level sensors and smart bolt wireless sensors to measure in real-time the temperature at which the <b>vibrating</b> <b>motor</b> powering the RVS machine is running. The sensors must measure the real-time stress and deformation that the RVS subsystems such as screen panels, screen deck frame, side plates, side liner plates, back plates, torsion bar, torsion bar brackets and M- 16 bolts e.t.c. of the machine are subjected to. They must ascertain real-time vibrations generated by the <b>vibrating</b> <b>motor.</b> They must monitor the lubricating oil level of the oil compartment of <b>vibrating</b> <b>motor.</b> The oil is responsible for the lubrication of shaft and bearing powering the <b>vibrating</b> <b>motor.</b> The measured values obtained from these sensors are then compared with the rule-based RVS subsystems performance algorithms developed by RVS machine manufacturer.
