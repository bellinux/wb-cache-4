Annakin and Davies devised a quip on the spot, having him read out: [...] "No. 1. Sit down." [...] Although a comedy, elements of Annakin's documentary background were evident with authentic sets, props and costumes.

2500|$|A {{crash test}} dummy is a {{full-scale}} anthropomorphic test device that simulates the dimensions, weight proportions and articulation of the human body, and is usually instrumented to record data about the dynamic behavior of the ATD in simulated vehicle impacts. Using human and animal cadaver research from earlier studies, the first artificial {{crash test dummy}} was an anthropomorphic dummy named [...] "Sierra Sam". It was invented in 1949 by Samuel W. Alderson at his Alderson Research Labs (ARL) And Sierra Engineering Co. for the United States Air Force while conducting tests on aircraft ejection seats, pilot restraint harnesses, and aviation helmets. Alderson's early dummies and those of his competitors were fairly primitive, with no pelvic structure and little spinal articulation. With American automakers interested in durable crash test dummies that could be tested and retested while yielding back {{a broad spectrum of}} data during simulated automobile crashes, the first crash test dummy used for automative testing was again invented by Samuel Alderson in 1968. It was called the V.I.P.
