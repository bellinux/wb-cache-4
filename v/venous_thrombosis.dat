5|$|The {{most common}} symptom of HIT is {{enlargement}} or extension of a previously diagnosed blood clot, or {{the development of}} a new blood clot elsewhere in the body. This may take the form of clots either in arteries or veins, causing arterial or <b>venous</b> <b>thrombosis,</b> respectively. Examples of arterial thrombosis are stroke, myocardial infarction ("heart attack"), and acute leg ischemia. <b>Venous</b> <b>thrombosis</b> may occur in the leg or arm in the form of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and in the lung in the form of a pulmonary embolism (PE); the latter usually originate in the leg but migrate to the lung.|$|E
5|$|In 1856, German {{physician}} and pathologist Rudolf Virchow published what {{is referred to}} as Virchow's triad, the three major causes of thrombosis.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:Brain CT {{is widely}} used to exclude or confirm acute {{cerebral}} <b>venous</b> sinus <b>thrombosis.</b> The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the value of attenuation measurement and the H:H ratio on unenhanced brain CT scans in the diagnosis of acute cerebral <b>venous</b> sinus <b>thrombosis.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS:This retrospective study evaluated 20 patients with acute cerebral <b>venous</b> sinus <b>thrombosis</b> and 20 age- and sex-matched control participants without thrombosis. Three experienced observers independently evaluated the unenhanced brain CT scan for the presence of cerebral <b>venous</b> sinus <b>thrombosis</b> and measured the attenuation in the dural sinuses. Interreader differences were examined, as well as densities and H:H ratio between patients with acute cerebral <b>venous</b> sinus <b>thrombosis</b> and control participants. RESULTS:A significant difference in the average sinus attenuation was found between patients with acute cerebral <b>venous</b> sinus <b>thrombosis</b> (73. 9 ± 9. 2 HU) and the control group (52. 8 ± 6. 7 HU; P <. 0001). A similar difference was found for the H:H ratio (1. 91 ± 0. 32 vs 1. 33 ± 0. 12 in patients with and without cerebral <b>venous</b> sinus <b>thrombosis,</b> respectively; P <. 0001). Optimal thresholds of 62 HU and 1. 52 lead to accuracies of 95 % for average sinus attenuation and 97. 5 % for the H:H ratio, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:Hyperattenuation and the H:H ratio in the dural sinuses on unenhanced brain CT scans have a high accuracy in the detection of acute cerebral <b>venous</b> sinus <b>thrombosis.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|The {{mechanism}} behind arterial thrombosis, such as {{with heart}} attacks, is more established than {{the steps that}} cause <b>venous</b> <b>thrombosis.</b> With arterial thrombosis, blood vessel wall damage is required, as it initiates coagulation, but clotting in the veins mostly occurs without any such damage. The beginning of <b>venous</b> <b>thrombosis</b> {{is thought to be}} caused by tissue factor, which leads to conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, followed by fibrin deposition. Red blood cells and fibrin are the main components of venous thrombi, and the fibrin appears to attach to the blood vessel wall lining (endothelium), a surface that normally acts to prevent clotting. Platelets and white blood cells are also components. Platelets are not as prominent in venous clots as they are in arterial ones, but they may play a role. Inflammation is associated with VTE, and white blood cells {{play a role in the}} formation and resolution of venous clots.|$|E
5|$|<b>Venous</b> <b>{{thrombosis}}</b> {{may also}} occur in more unusual places: in the veins of the brain, liver (portal vein thrombosis and hepatic vein thrombosis), mesenteric vein, kidney (renal vein thrombosis) and the veins of the arms. Whether thrombophilia also {{increases the risk}} of arterial thrombosis (which is the underlying cause of heart attacks and strokes) is less well established.|$|E
5|$|The female hormone estrogen, {{when used}} in the {{combined}} oral contraceptive pill and in perimenopausal hormone replacement therapy, {{has been associated with}} a two- to sixfold increased risk of <b>venous</b> <b>thrombosis.</b> The risk depends on the type of hormones used, the dose of estrogen, and the presence of other thrombophilic risk factors.

40|$|SummaryColorectal {{cancer is}} seldom {{accompanied}} by <b>venous</b> tumor <b>thrombosis,</b> and {{little is known}} about the features of <b>venous</b> tumor <b>thrombosis</b> in colorectal cancer. However, some reports show that colorectal cancer patients can develop <b>venous</b> tumor <b>thrombosis</b> and warn clinicians not to overlook this complication. In this report, we perform a review of 43 previously reported cases and investigate the characteristics of colorectal cancer accompanied by <b>venous</b> tumor <b>thrombosis.</b> The histological type of more than half of the cases was moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, which is known to be aggressive. Among 41 cases with available data on liver metastasis, eight patients had synchronous liver metastasis, and liver metastatic recurrence after surgical resection was indicated in 10 patients. This liver metastatic rate was high compared to general colorectal cancer. However, 11 of 43 patients with <b>venous</b> tumor <b>thrombosis</b> could survive for more than 2  years after the diagnosis, although five of the 11 patients had liver metastasis. A long survival can be anticipated for patients following complete tumor resection and adjuvant chemotherapy. A greater accumulation of cases will help elucidate the characteristics of colorectal cancer with <b>venous</b> tumor <b>thrombosis</b> and improve the treatment strategy...|$|R

5|$|After initial {{reports that}} {{warfarin}} could reduce bone mineral density, {{several studies have}} demonstrated a link between warfarin use and osteoporosis-related fracture. A 1999 study in 572 women taking warfarin for deep <b>venous</b> <b>thrombosis,</b> risk of vertebral fracture and rib fracture was increased; other fracture types did not occur more commonly. A 2002 study looking at a randomly selected selection of 1523 patients with osteoporotic fracture found no increased exposure to anticoagulants compared to controls, and neither did stratification of the duration of anticoagulation reveal a trend towards fracture.|$|E
5|$|Deep vein thrombosis, or deep <b>venous</b> <b>thrombosis</b> (DVT), is the {{formation}} of a blood clot (thrombus) within a deep vein, most commonly the legs. Nonspecific signs may include pain, swelling, redness, warmness, and engorged superficial veins. Pulmonary embolism, a potentially life-threatening complication, is caused by the detachment (embolization) of a clot that travels to the lungs. Together, DVT and pulmonary embolism constitute a single disease process known as venous thromboembolism. Post-thrombotic syndrome, another complication, significantly contributes to the health-care cost of DVT.|$|E

5|$|The first {{description}} of thrombosis of the cerebral veins and sinuses {{is attributed to}} the French physician Ribes, who in 1825 observed thrombosis of the saggital sinus and cerebral veins in {{a man who had}} suffered from seizures and delirium. Until {{the second half of the}} 20th century it remained a diagnosis generally made after death. In the 1940s, reports by Dr Charles Symonds and others allowed for the clinical diagnosis of cerebral <b>venous</b> <b>thrombosis,</b> using characteristic signs and symptoms and results of lumbar puncture.|$|E
5|$|<b>Venous</b> <b>thrombosis,</b> the {{formation}} of a blood clot in a vein, is a common cause of death in breast cancer patients; patients with recurrent disease are typically maintained on anticoagulants for their lifetimes. A research study has suggested that extracts from P.impudicus can reduce the risk of this condition by reducing the incidence of platelet aggregation, and may have potential as a supportive preventative nutrition. It was used in medieval times as a cure for gout and as a love potion.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{acquired}} conditions augment {{the risk of}} thrombosis. A prominent example is antiphospholipid syndrome, which is caused by antibodies against constituents of the cell membrane, particularly lupus anticoagulant (first found in people with the disease systemic lupus erythematosus but often detected in people without the disease), anti-cardiolipin antibodies, and anti-β2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies; it is therefore regarded as an autoimmune disease. In some cases antiphospholipid syndrome can cause arterial as well as <b>venous</b> <b>thrombosis.</b> It is also more strongly associated with miscarriage, and can cause {{a number of other}} symptoms (such as livedo reticularis of the skin and migraine).|$|E

40|$|Cerebral <b>venous</b> sinus <b>thrombosis</b> {{is a rare}} form {{of stroke}} caused by <b>thrombosis</b> in <b>venous</b> sinuses of the brain. In this study, we {{reported}} on a patient with <b>venous</b> sinus <b>thrombosis</b> and brucellosis who presented with uncontrolled seizure despite being treated with anti-epileptic drugs at high doses. The case was a 33 -year-old woman {{with a history of}} controlled complex partial seizure who presented with headache, asthenia, and uncontrolled seizure for one month.

5|$|A {{very small}} {{proportion}} (those affected by SMAD4 (MADH4) mutations, see below) have multiple benign polyps {{in the large}} intestine, which may bleed or transform into colorectal cancer. A similarly small proportion experiences pulmonary hypertension, a state in which the pressure in the lung arteries is increased, exerting pressure {{on the right side}} of the heart and causing peripheral edema (swelling of the legs), fainting and attacks of chest pain. It has been observed that the risk of thrombosis (particularly <b>venous</b> <b>thrombosis,</b> in the form of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) may be increased. There is a suspicion that those with HHT may have a mild immunodeficiency and are therefore at a slightly increased risk from infections.|$|E
5|$|Obesity {{has long}} been {{regarded}} as {{a risk factor for}} <b>venous</b> <b>thrombosis.</b> It more than doubles the risk in numerous studies, particularly in combination with the use of oral contraceptives or in the period after surgery. Various coagulation abnormalities have been described in the obese. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, an inhibitor of fibrinolysis, is present in higher levels in people with obesity. Obese people also have larger numbers of circulating microvesicles (fragments of damaged cells) that bear tissue factor. Platelet aggregation may be increased, and there are higher levels of coagulation proteins such as von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, factor VII and factor VIII. Obesity also increases the risk of recurrence after an initial episode of thrombosis.|$|E
5|$|Warfarin is {{best suited}} for anticoagulation (clot {{formation}} inhibition) in areas of slowly running blood (such as in veins and the pooled blood behind artificial and natural valves) and in blood pooled in dysfunctional cardiac atria. Thus, common clinical indications for warfarin use are atrial fibrillation, the presence of artificial heart valves, deep <b>venous</b> <b>thrombosis,</b> and pulmonary embolism (where the embolized clots first form in veins). Warfarin is also used in antiphospholipid syndrome. It has been used occasionally after heart attacks (myocardial infarctions), but is far less effective at preventing new thromboses in coronary arteries. Prevention of clotting in arteries is usually undertaken with antiplatelet drugs, which act by a different mechanism from warfarin (which normally {{has no effect on}} platelet function).|$|E
