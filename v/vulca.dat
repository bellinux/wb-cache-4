25|$|It {{was widely}} {{assumed that the}} Capitoline Wolf was the very {{sculpture}} described by Cicero, due {{to the presence of}} damage to the sculpture's paw, which was believed to correspond to the lightning strike of 65 BC. The 18th-century German art historian Johann Joachim Winckelmann attributed the statue to an Etruscan maker in the 5th century BC, based on how the wolf's fur was depicted. It was first attributed to the Veiian artist <b>Vulca,</b> who decorated the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, and then re-attributed to an unknown Etruscan artist of approximately 480–470 BC. Winckelmann correctly identified a Renaissance origin for the twins; they were probably added in 1471 or later.|$|E

Other toluene-containing substances have also been subject to abuse, most notably the <b>Vulca</b> Seal brand of roof sealants. Bostik Philippines, which currently owns the Rugby and <b>Vulca</b> Seal brands, has since responded to the issue by adding bitterants such as mustard oil to their Rugby line, as well as reformulating it by replacing toluene with xylene. Several other manufacturers have also followed suit.|$|E

50|$|The art of {{sculpture}} in the Italian peninsula {{has its roots}} in ancient times. In the archaic period, when Etruscan cities dominated central Italy and the adjacent sea, Etruscan sculpture flourished. The name of an individual artist, <b>Vulca,</b> who worked at Veii, has been identified. He has left a terracotta Apollo and other figures, and can perhaps claim the distinction of being the most ancient master in the long history of Italian art.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Vulca</b> was an Etruscan artist {{from the}} town of Veii. The only Etruscan artist {{mentioned}} by ancient writers, he worked for the last of the Roman kings, Tarquinius Superbus. He is responsible for creating a terracotta statue of Jupiter that was inside the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the Capitoline Hill, and possibly the Apollo of Veii. His statue of Jupiter, which being made of terracotta had a red face, was so famous that victorious Roman generals would paint their faces red during their triumphal marches through Rome. Pliny the Elder wrote that his works were [...] "the finest images of deities of that era...more admired than gold." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} temple {{may have}} measured almost 60 × 60 m, though this estimate is hotly disputed by some specialists. [...] It was certainly {{considered the most}} important religious temple of the whole state of Rome. Each deity of the Triad had a separate cella, with Juno Regina on the left, Minerva on the right, and Jupiter Optimus Maximus in the middle. The first temple was decorated with many terra cotta sculptures. The most famous of these was of Jupiter driving a quadriga, a chariot drawn by four horses, which {{was on top of}} the roof as an acroterion. This sculpture, as well as the cult statue of Jupiter in the main cella, was said to have been the work of Etruscan artisan <b>Vulca</b> of Veii. An image of Summanus, a thunder god, was among the pedimental statues. The original temple decoration was discovered in 2014.The findings allowed the archaeologists to reconstruct {{for the first time the}} real appearance of the temple in the earliest phase. The wooden elements of the roof and lintels were lined with terracotta revetment plaques and other elements of exceptional size and richly decorated with painted reliefs, following the so-called Second Phase model (referring to the decorative systems of Etruscan and Latin temples), that had its first expression precisely with the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus. The temple, which immediately rose to fame, established a new model for sacred architecture that was adopted in the terracotta decorations of many temples in Italy up to the 2nd century BC. The original elements were partially replaced with other elements in different style in the early 4th century BC and anew at the end of 3rd - beginning 2nd century BC. The removed material was dumped into the layers forming the square in front of the temple, the so-called Area Capitolina, in the middle years the 2nd century BC.|$|E

It’s clear that they do exist as a special feaure in some DTP packages, and that they are used out of a desire for a much misunderstood ‘symmetry. I still think they are an unnecessary and pointless device, but like the misplaced apostrophe, probably impossible to stop. When I become dictator of the planet I’ll be able to act on this: 1 until then I trust in your judgment to point out the evils of reversed quotes to anyone who uses them. <b>Vulca...</b>|$|E
