25|$|Toxicants {{may also}} cause {{endocrine}} disruption through {{interacting with the}} estrogen receptor. This mechanism has been well-studied with PCBs. These chemicals {{have been used as}} coolants and lubricants in transformers and other electrical equipment due to their insulating properties. A purely anthropogenic substance, PCBs are no longer in production in the United States due to the adverse health effects associated with exposure, but they are highly persistent and are still widespread in the environment. PCBs are a xenoestrogen, which elicit an enhancing (rather than inhibiting) response, and are mediated by the estrogen receptor. These are often referred to as estrogen mimics because they mimic the effects of estrogen. PCBs often build up in sediments and bioaccumulate in organisms. These chemicals diffuse into the nucleus and bind to the estrogen receptor. The estrogen receptor is kept in an inactive conformation through interactions with proteins such as heat shock proteins 59, 70, and 90. After the toxicant binding occurs, the estrogen receptor is activated and forms a homodimer complex which seeks out estrogen response elements in the DNA. The binding of the complex to these elements causes a rearrangement of the chromatin and transcription of the gene, resulting in production of a specific protein. In doing this, PCBs elicit an estrogenic response which can affect numerous functions within the organism. These effects are observed in various aquatic species. The levels of PCBs in marine mammals are often very high as a result of bioaccumulation. Studies have demonstrated that PCBs are responsible for reproductive impairment in the harbor seal (Phoca vitulina). Similar effects have been found in the grey seal (Halichoerus grypus), the ringed seal (Pusa hispida) and the California sea lion (Zalophys californinus). In the grey seals and ringed seals, uterine occlusions and stenosis were found which led to sterility. If exposed to a xenoestrogen such as PCBs, male fish have also been seen to produce <b>vitellogenin.</b> <b>Vitellogenin</b> is an egg protein female fish normally produce but is not usually present in males except at very low concentrations. This is often used as a biomarker for EDCs.|$|E
50|$|The <b>vitellogenin</b> {{expression}} {{is part of}} a regulatory feedback loop that enables <b>vitellogenin</b> and juvenile hormone to mutually suppress each other. <b>Vitellogenin</b> and juvenile hormone likely work antagonistically in the honey bee to regulate the honey bees development and behavior.

5000|$|Honey bees deposit <b>vitellogenin</b> {{molecules}} in fat bodies in their abdomen and heads. The fat bodies apparently {{act as a}} food storage reservoir. The glycolipoprotein <b>vitellogenin</b> has additional functionality as it acts as an antioxidant to prolong Queen bee and forager lifespan {{as well as a}} hormone that affects future foraging behavior. [...] The health of a honey bee colony is dependent upon the <b>vitellogenin</b> reserves of the nurse bees - the foragers having low levels of <b>vitellogenin.</b> As expendable laborers, the foragers are fed just enough protein to keep them working their risky task of collecting nectar and pollen. <b>Vitellogenin</b> levels are important during the nest stage and thus influence honey bee worker division of labor.|$|E
40|$|In Drosophila, <b>vitellogenins</b> (yolk protein precursors) are {{synthesized}} by {{the female}} fat body, secreted into the hemolymph and subsequently {{taken up by}} the developing oocytes. The male fat body, on the other hand, does not do this even when immature ovaries are transplanted into the body cavity and grow. Thus, the hemolymph <b>vitellogenins</b> serve as an easily detectable sexually dimorphic biochemical marker. ——We have examined hemolymph <b>vitellogenins</b> by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in flies carrying various sex-transformation mutants (dsx, tra, tra- 2 and tra- 2 OTF) singly and in all possible combinations. Chromosomal females homozygous for tra or tra- 2 have no detectable hemolymph <b>vitellogenins,</b> while those homozygous for tra- 2 OTF exhibit appreciable levels of these proteins. Flies homozygous for dsx, both X/X and X/Y, have hemolymph <b>vitellogenins,</b> although the amount is consistently smaller in the latter. Indeed, X/Y; dsx/dsx is the only genotype in which hemolymph <b>vitellogenins</b> are detected in the X/Y flies. A clear hierarchy of epistasis exists among these sex-transformation mutants when they are examined in various combinations: dsx > tra, tra- 2 > tra- 2 OTF. Moreover, an interaction between tra- 2 OTF and tra was seen in these experiments: X/X; tra- 2 OTF/tra- 2 OTF flies show the presence of only a trace of hemolymph <b>vitellogenins</b> when they are made heterozygous for tra.

40|$|Coagulation in {{crayfish}} {{blood is}} based on the transglutaminase-mediated crosslinking of a specific plasma clotting protein. Here we report the cloning of the subunit of this clotting protein from a crayfish hepatopancreas cDNA library. The ORF encodes a protein of 1, 721 amino acids, including a signal peptide of 15 amino acids. Sequence analysis reveals that the clotting protein is homologous to <b>vitellogenins,</b> which are proteins found in vitellogenic females of egg-laying animals. The clotting protein and <b>vitellogenins</b> are all lipoproteins and share a limited sequence similarity to certain other lipoproteins (e. g., mammalian apolipoprotein B and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein) and contain a stretch with similarity to the D domain of mammalian von Willebrand factor. The crayfish clotting protein is present in both sexes, unlike the female-specific <b>vitellogenins.</b> Electron microscopy was used to visualize individual clotting protein molecules and to study the transglutaminase-mediated clotting reaction.

40|$|<b>Vitellogenins,</b> cyclorraphan yolk {{proteins}} and lepidopteran minor yolk proteins are three classes of female-specific proteins {{that serve as}} an embryonic nutritional store.

In this study, we cloned five additional yolk proteins from the grey fleshfly Neobellieria bullata, formerly known as Sarcophaga bullata. We used this sequence data, combined with sequence data retrieved from the NCBI protein database to evaluate the yolk protein-lipase and the yolk protein-minor yolk protein relationship. We found no similarity between yolk proteins and minor yolk proteins, but we showed that yolk proteins are related to a family of lipases containing vertebrate hepatic and pancreatic lipases while minor yolk proteins are related to a family of lipases containing vertebrate gastric and lingual lipases. The fact that three different classes of yolk storage proteins show similarity to three different classes of vertebrate lipid-binding proteins strongly suggests that this lipid-binding feature is important for insect yolk storage proteins. status: publishe...|$|R

Usually, <b>vitellogenin</b> is only produced by female fish, because it is estrogen-dependent. Nevertheless, the synthesis of this protein in males and young fish can also occur, as xenoestrogens can also affect the hepatic receptors and activate it. Hence, a frequently used biomarker of exposure to estrogen active substances in the environment is the measurement of <b>vitellogenin</b> levels in male and juvenile trout.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA 106 -residue {{region of}} high {{similarity}} between lipoprotein/pancreatic/hepatic lipases and Drosophila <b>vitellogenins</b> encompasses four β-strands with all residues but one strictly conserved or conservatively replaced between the structures, and enclosing the putative active site Ser- 152.

No residue within this loop is conserved through all lipases, but adjacent segments exhibit 60 – 70 % residue identity, Hepatic and lipoprotein lipases probably hydrolyze both soluble and emulsified substrates at the same site. They lack residues corresponding to a second active site postulated in pancreatic lipase to account for hydrolysis of soluble substrates.

40|$|Four genes {{encoding}} {{the major}} egg yolk polypeptides of the Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata, <b>vitellogenins</b> 1 and 2 (VG 1 and VG 2), were cloned, characterized and partially sequenced. The genes {{are located on}} the same region of chromosome 5 and are organized in pairs, each encoding the two polypeptides on opposite DNA strands. Restriction and nucleotide sequence analysis indicate that the gene pairs have arisen from an ancestral pair by a relatively recent duplication event. The transcribed part {{is very similar to}} that of the Drosophila melanogaster yolk protein genes Yp 1, Yp 2 and Yp 3. The Vg 1 genes have two introns at the same positions as those in D. melanogaster Yp 3; the Vg 2 genes have only one of the introns, as do D. melanogaster Yp 1 and Yp 2. Comparison of the five polypeptide sequences shows extensive homology, with 27 % of the residues being invariable. The sequence similarity of the processed proteins extends in two regions separated by a nonconserved region of varying size. Secondary structure predictions suggest a highly conserved secondary structure pattern in the two regions, which probably correspond to structural and functional domains. The carboxy-end domain of the C. capitata proteins shows the same sequence similarities with triacylglycerol lipases that have been reported previously for the D. melanogaster yolk proteins.

40|$|The salmon louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis Krøyer {{affects a}} variety of wild salmonoid hosts, but is also an {{important}} pest in aquaculture, which is a globally important and rapidly growing industry. Salmon lice have large reproductive outputs, and knowledge of reproductive processes may be crucial for the control of this parasite. Here, we report on the characterisation of 2 <b>vitellogenins</b> (LsVit 1 and LsVit 2), which are the precursors of salmon-louse egg-yolk glycoprotein. The structure of LsVit 1 and LsVit 2 was examined and compared to that in other oviparous animals. Phylogenetic analysis of LsVit 1 and LsVit 2 confirmed the view that crustaceans are a polyphyletic group. Transcriptional and translational analysis demonstrated production of LsVit 1 and LsVit 2 in the subcuticular tissue of the adult female lice. LsVit 1 and LsVit 2 could also be found in maturing oocytes and developing embryos and early larval stages. LsVit 2 was found to be processed into 2 smaller fragments, whereas LsVit 1 was found to be full length when deposited into the oocytes. Degradation of LsVit 1 and LsVit 2 was characterised through embryogenesis and the early non-feeding larval stages. Finally, protein content and the level of free amino acids were analysed in embryos and larval stages and their role in nutrition and osmoregulation discussed.

Decrease in protein turnover was consistent for {{only a minority of}} functionally related protein subsets, including tubulins and <b>vitellogenins,</b> whereas randomly diverging turnover patterns with age were the norm. Our data suggests increased heterogeneity of protein turnover of the translation machinery, whereas protein turnover of ubiquitin-proteasome and antioxidant systems are well-preserved over time.

50|$|Nonylphenol is {{considered}} to be an endocrine disruptor due to its ability to mimic estrogen and in turn disrupt the natural balance of hormones in affected organisms. The effect is weak because nonylphenols are not very close structural mimics of estradiol, but the levels of nonylphenol can be sufficiently high to compensate.The effects of nonylphenol in the environment are most applicable to aquatic species. Nonylphenol can cause endocrine disruption in fish by interacting with estrogen receptors and androgen receptors. Studies report that nonylphenol competitively displaces estrogen from its receptor site in rainbow trout. It has a stronger affinity to the E2 receptor than estrogen. Nonylphenol causes the feminization of aquatic organisms, decreases male fertility, and decreases survival in young fish. Studies show that male fish exposed to nonylphenol have lower testicular weight. Nonylphenol can disrupt steroidogenesis in the liver. One function of endogenous estrogen in fish is to stimulate the liver to make <b>vitellogenin,</b> which is a phospholipoprotein. <b>Vitellogenin</b> is released by the maturing female and sequestered by developing oocytes to produce the egg yolk. Males do not normally produce <b>vitellogenin,</b> but when exposed to nonylphenol they produce similar levels of <b>vitellogenin</b> to females. The concentration needed to induce <b>vitellogenin</b> production in fish is 10 ug/L for NP in water. Nonylphenol can also interfere with the level of FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) being released from the pituitary gland. Concentrations of NP that inhibit reproductive development and function in fish also damages kidneys, decreases body weight, and induces stressed behavior.|$|E

40|$|The {{unfolded}} protein response (UPR) is {{a stress}} response pathway that is activated upon increased unfolded and/or misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and enhanced ER stress response prolongs life span and improves immunity. However, the {{mechanism by which}} ER stress affects immunity remains poorly understood. Using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, we show that mutations in the lipoproteins <b>vitellogenins,</b> which are homologs of human apolipoprotein B- 100, resulted in upregulation of the UPR. Lipoprotein accumulation in the intestine adversely affects the immune response and {{the life span of}} the organism, suggesting that it could be a contributing factor to immunosenescence. We show that lipoprotein accumulation inhibited the expression of several immune genes encoding proteins secreted by the intestinal cells in an IRE- 1 -independent manner.

40|$|<b>Vitellogenins</b> (Vtg) are ancient lipid {{transport}} and storage proteins {{and members of the}} large lipid transfer protein (LLTP) gene family, which includes insect apolipophorin II/I, apolipoprotein B (apoB), and the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP). Lipidation of Vtg occurs at its site of synthesis in vertebrate liver, insect fat body, and nematode intestine; however, the mechanism of Vtg lipid acquisition is unknown. To explore whether Vtg biogenesis requires the apoB cofactor and LLTP family member, MTP, Vtg was expressed in COS cells with and without coexpression of the 97 -kDa subunit of human MTP. Expression of Vtg alone gave rise to a approximately 220 -kDa apoprotein, which was predominantly confined to an intracellular location. Coexpression of Vtg with human MTP enhanced Vtg secretion by 5 -fold, without dramatically affecting its intracellular stability. A comparison of wild type and a triglyceride transfer-defective form of MTP revealed that both were capable of promoting Vtg secretion, whereas only wild type MTP could promote the secretion of apoB 41 (amino-terminal 41 % of apoB).
