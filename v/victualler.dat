50|$|Though {{nominally}} {{under the}} direction of the Navy Board (which had its headquarters nearby on Tower Hill), the <b>Victualling</b> Board was effectively independent. The <b>Victualling</b> Board took over certain functions, including medical services, from the Transport Board on its dissolution in 1817. The <b>Victualling</b> Board itself was abolished in the Admiralty reforms of 1832, <b>victualling</b> then became the responsibility of the Comptroller of <b>Victualling</b> and Transports, who was superintended by the Fourth Sea Lord. In 1862 transport duties passed to a separate Transport Department and in 1869 the office of Comptroller of <b>Victualling</b> was abolished. His former duties were divided between the newly formed Contract and Purchase Department, under the Parliamentary and Financial Secretary, which became responsible for purchasing, management of the <b>victualling</b> stores facilities were under the control of the Superintendent of <b>Victualling</b> and the <b>Victualling</b> Department under the control of the Director of <b>Victualling.</b>|$|R

25|$|Cornelius Coward (27 January 1838 – 15 July 1903) was an English cricketer. A talented fielder and {{right-handed}} batsman, {{popularly known}} as Kerr, Coward played 49 first-class matches for Lancashire County Cricket Club between 1865 and 1876. He scored 1,210 runs in the middle order for Lancashire, before retiring to play club cricket for his home town of Preston – who he also coached – as well as becoming a cricket umpire for 98 matches, a licensed <b>victualler</b> and {{a teacher at the}} Roman Catholic institutions of Stonyhurst College in Lancashire and Clongowes Wood College in Ireland.|$|E
25|$|In 1881, a local census {{recorded}} Coward {{living at}} Riverside Bowling Green Inn, Preston, {{with his wife}} Ellen, aged 41. He had two domestic servants and, at age 43, was a licensed <b>victualler.</b> The 1901 census listed him as a professional cricketer, however his wife had by then died, and Coward was shown to live at 204 South Meadow Road, Preston with one servant. In his last years he continued to play club cricket for Preston, and spent some time at Stonyhurst College, Lancashire and at Clongowes Wood College, in Ireland. He died in July 1903, {{in the town of}} his birth, Preston.|$|E

In London, they met Mrs Elizabeth Mary King (née Davis), wife of Edward John 'Ted' King, a licensed <b>victualler,</b> and mother of four children, Edward, Leon, Vivian and Liese. Mrs King had stage ambitions for her sons. In 1891, Maud taught the boys how to shoot, but then later returned to the USA alone. Evidence suggests that by the autumn of 1891, Maud was unable to perform with her husband because of injury, morphine addiction, the onset of schizophrenia, or a combination of these ills.|$|E
25|$|The {{attempt was}} now {{scheduled}} for 4.00 am on Tuesday 7 May and by two hours past daylight the English were defeated. Although {{there were two}} breaches, {{the damage to the}} walls was insufficient. None of the flanking batteries were disabled, and the scaling ladders were too short. The result was heavy losses estimated at 1000 to 1500 Scots and English. A report by Peter Carew estimated a third of the dead were Scottish. However, Carew's total of six-score dead, which was followed by George Buchanan, is roughly a tenth of the other reports. The accountant and <b>victualler</b> of Berwick, Sir Valentine Browne noted there were 1,688 men unable to serve, still on the payroll, hurt at the assault or at various other times, and now sick or dead. The author of the Diurnal of Occurents put the total number slain at 400. Humfrey Barwick was told the French collected the top-coats of the English who had reached and died on the walls, and 448 were counted. The French journal claims only 15 defenders were killed. John Knox and the French journal attributed some of the casualties to the women of Leith throwing stones from the ramparts.|$|E
500|$|Upnor Castle was {{commissioned}} in 1559 {{by order of}} Queen Elizabeth and her Privy Council. Six [...] "indifferent persons" [...] chose a site opposite St Mary's Creek in Chatham, on [...] of land belonging to a Thomas Devinisshe of Frindsbury. It was acquired by the Crown – possibly compulsorily purchased – for the sum of £25. Military engineer Sir Richard Lee was given the task of designing the new fortification, but {{he appears to have}} been fully occupied with working on the defences of Berwick-upon-Tweed, and the project was carried out by others to his designs. His deputy Humphrey Locke took the role of overseer, surveyor, and chief carpenter, while Richard Watts, the former Rochester mayor and <b>victualler</b> to the navy, managed the project on a day-to-day basis and handled the accounting.|$|E
25|$|Dockyard {{facilities}} {{were also used}} to resupply and <b>victual</b> the navy's warships; Deptford's <b>Victualling</b> Yard was founded upstream of the main dockyard: the <b>Victualling</b> Board leased the Red House estate in 1743 and established its main depot at Deptford, embarking {{on the construction of}} stores and mills. In time, the two yards became physically merged as the dockyard expanded in the <b>victualling</b> yard, both being enclosed by a wall. Deptford's proximity to the food markets of London made it especially convenient for <b>victualling,</b> and it served the requirements not only of its own neighbouring Dockyard, but those of Woolwich, Sheerness and Chatham as well. In 1858 it was renamed the Royal Victoria <b>Victualling</b> Yard, following similar re-brandings in Plymouth, Portsmouth and Ireland.|$|R

500|$|Mr Justice Abbott {{addressed}} the court: [...] He {{then went on}} to direct the jury at length, commenting at one point that these disturbances [...] "seem to have been the necessity of an advance in the wages of husbandry; but the circumstances of some among the offenders do not correspond with the supposition of such an object". He was probably referring to John Dennis, licensed <b>victualler</b> of Littleport. He outlined the three capital offences that would be presented, namely burglary, robbery from the person and stealing in a dwelling house. He defined burglary as breaking into a house at night with intent, robbery from the person as extortion by violence or threat thereof, and stealing in a dwelling house as an actual act of stealing, not just the threat. He reminded the jury that when offences are carried out by a mob, it is the whole mob that is guilty, not just the person doing the deed. He closed: The court adjourned until the following day.|$|E
500|$|The Parrett was {{established}} as {{the border between}} the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex and the Brythonic kingdom of Dumnonia in 658, following the Dumnonians' defeat at the Battle of Peonnum that year. This natural border endured for almost a century until further fighting between the Anglo-Saxons and Britons in the mid-8th century, when the border shifted west to its current location between the modern ceremonial counties of Somerset and Devon. It is thought a ford, usable only at low tide, crossed the river near its mouth, between Combwich and Pawlett (east bank). This crossing, at the western end of the Polden Hills, was known since Roman times and lay on the route of a Saxon herepath. It was here, or in the immediate vicinity, that Hubba, the Danish raider, was defeated and killed by Odda in 878. In the Domesday Book Combwich was known as Comich, which means [...] "the settlement by the water", from the Old English cumb and wic. The ford was later replaced by a ferry, one of which was in operation from at least the 13th century. In the 15th century the ferry was regarded as part of the King's Highway, and both passengers and cattle were carried in the 16th and 17th centuries. Records of the joint Manorial ownership and costs of the ferry exist for 1589 and 1810. The White House Inn, a licensed <b>victualler</b> and part-owner of the ferry, traded on the Pawlett bank from 1655 to 1897; the building was retained as a farm dwelling for another 20years. The Combwich river crossing, which was a main route until the 18th century, fell out of use due to turnpike trusts improving what were to become the A38 and A39 roads, and traffic went via Bridgwater; the former inn was demolished c.1930.|$|E
