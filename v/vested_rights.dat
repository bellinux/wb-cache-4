60|$|The Barnacle {{family had}} {{for some time}} helped to {{administer}} the Circumlocution Office. The Tite Barnacle Branch, indeed, considered themselves {{in a general way}} as having <b>vested</b> <b>rights</b> in that direction, and took it ill if any other family had much to say to it. The Barnacles were a very high family, and a very large family. They were dispersed all over the public offices, and held all sorts of public places. Either the nation was under a load of obligation to the Barnacles, or the Barnacles were under a load of obligation to the nation. It was not quite unanimously settled which; the Barnacles having their opinion, the nation theirs.|$|E
60|$|At {{that instant}} the Judge {{caught a glimpse}} of the figures of Elizabeth and Louisa, who were slowly {{descending}} the mountain, short distance before him. He put spurs to his horse, and riding up to them, dismounted, and drove his steed along the narrow path. While the agitated parent was listening to the vivid description that his daughter gave of her recent danger, and her unexpected escape, all thoughts of mines, <b>vested</b> <b>rights,</b> and examinations were absorbed in emotion; and when the image of Natty again crossed his recollection, it was not as a law Less and depredating squatter, but as the preserver of his child.|$|E
6000|$|His {{physical}} organization, obviously {{intended for}} locomotion, becomes a fixture; for where the calm leaves him, there he remains. Even his undoubted <b>vested</b> <b>rights,</b> comprised in his glorious liberty of volition, become as naught. For of what use?

It is more hopeless than a bad marriage in a land where there is no Doctors' Commons. He has taken the ship to wife, for better or for worse, for calm or for gale; and she is not to be shuffled off. With yards akimbo, she says unto him scornfully, as the old beldam said to the little dwarf:--"Help yourself" ...|$|E

5000|$|A <b>vested</b> <b>right</b> is [...] "an {{absolute}} right; when a plan {{is fully}} vested, the employee has an absolute {{right to the}} entire {{amount of money in}} the account".

50|$|The {{rights of}} the other person {{concerned}} in each case in these dispositions, the residuary owner and the fideicommissary respectively, naturally differ very considerably. In {{the case of a}} usufruct, the owner of the property has a <b>vested</b> <b>right,</b> although the ownerâ€™s enjoyment is postponed, whereas the right of a fideicommissary is not vested, but rather contingent upon fulfilment of the fideicommissary condition.|$|R
6000|$|Less generous men, with {{a selfish}} {{interest}} in established privileges; timid men, who looked with terror upon any prospect of change; older and wiser men, who better understood {{the foundations of}} social order {{and the nature of}} man--all these looked with distrust upon the revolutionary idealism that was spreading from France through the younger generation of Englishmen. The new notions of liberty, it was felt, threatened not only the <b>vested</b> <b>rights</b> of property and the prescriptions of rank, but the Church, too, and religion. Some of the would-be reformers were avowed atheists; some (Coleridge and his friends, for instance, in the Pantisocracy period) were communists. In general, they ascribed all the evils of society to [...] "institutions," [...] and wanted them abolished.|$|E
60|$|Previous {{knowledge}} or intelligence scarcely existed, {{and then was}} not due to Dame Dearlove's tuition. Mr. Henderson pronounced an authorised school a necessity. My father had scruples as to <b>vested</b> <b>rights,</b> for the old woman was the last survivor of a family who had had recourse to primer and hornbook after their ejection on 'black Bartholomew's Day;' and when the meeting-house was built after the Revolution, had combined preaching with teaching. Monopoly had promoted degeneracy, and this last of the race was an unfavourable specimen in all save outward picturesqueness. However, much against Henderson's liking, an accommodation was proposed, by which books were to be supplied to her, and the Church Catechism be taught in her school, {{with the assistance of}} the curate and Miss Winslow.|$|E

6000|$|She {{knew this}} was final for the moment, and stole away, leaving him still looking at the pipe-joint. She wandered into the fruit-garden, among the {{raspberry}} and currant bushes, without impetus to pick and eat. Two months ago--she was light-hearted! Even two days ago--light-hearted, before Prosper Profond told her. Now she felt tangled in a web--of passions, <b>vested</b> <b>rights,</b> oppressions and revolts, the ties of love and hate. At this dark moment of discouragement there seemed, even to her hold-fast nature, no way out. How deal with it--how sway and bend things to her will, and get her heart's desire? And, suddenly, round {{the corner of the}} high box hedge, she came plump on her mother, walking swiftly, with an open letter in her hand. Her bosom was heaving, her eyes dilated, her cheeks flushed. Instantly Fleur thought: [...] "The yacht! Poor Mother!" ...|$|E
6000|$|At length, the demagogues {{thought they}} had made {{sufficient}} progress to spring their mine. The journal {{came out with a}} proposal to call a convention, to alter and improve the fundamental law. That law contained a clause already pointing out the mode by which amendments were {{to be made in the}} constitution; but this mode required the consent of the governor, of the council, and finally, of the people. It was a slow, deliberative process, too, one by which men had time to reflect on what they were doing, and so far protected <b>vested</b> <b>rights</b> as to render it certain that no very great revolution could be effected under its shadow. Now, the disaffected aimed at revolution--at carrying out, completely the game of [...] "puss in the corner," [...] and it became necessary to set up some new principle by which they could circumvent the old fundamental law.|$|E
6000|$|At {{those words}} such a turmoil began {{taking place in}} Jolyon that he could barely sit still in the cab.

Here beside him in the cab was the very embodiment, the corporeal sum as it were, of the possessive instinct--his own kinsman, too! It was uncanny and intolerable! 'But there's something more in it than that!' he thought with a sick feeling. 'The dog, they say, returns to his vomit! The sight of her has reawakened something. Beauty! The devil's in it!' ...|$|E
50|$|In law, vesting {{is to give}} an {{immediately}} secured {{right of}} present or future deployment. One has a <b>vested</b> <b>right</b> to an asset that cannot be taken away by any third party, even though one may not yet possess the asset.

60|$|Close to the cataract, exactly at {{the spot}} from whence in former days the Table Rock used to project from the land over the boiling caldron below, {{there is now a}} shaft, down which you will descend {{to the level of the}} river, and pass between the rock and the torrent. This Table Rock broke away from the cliff and fell, as up the whole course of the river the seceding rocks have split and fallen from time to time through countless years, and will {{continue}} to do till the bed of the upper lake is reached.

60|$|Miss Eversleigh did NOT know, {{but there}} was enough sincerity and real feeling in the young fellow's voice and eyes to make her color {{slightly}} and hurry him away to a locality less fraught with emotions. In a few moments they entered the park, and the old Hall rose before them. It was a great Tudor house of mullioned windows, traceries, and battlements; of stately towers, moss-grown balustrades, and statues darkening with the fog that was already hiding the angles and wings of its huge bulk. A peacock spread its ostentatious tail on the broad stone steps before the portal; a flight of rooks from the leafless elms rose above its stacked and twisted chimneys. After all, how little had this stately incarnation of the <b>vested</b> <b>rights</b> and sacred tenures {{of the past in}} common with the laughing rover he had left in London that morning! And thinking of the destinies that the captain held so lightly in his hand, and perhaps not a little of the absurdity of his own position to the confiding young girl beside him, for a moment he half hated him.|$|E
6000|$|The plea of the godly that Mary should {{ratify the}} Book of Discipline was countered by the scoffs of Lethington. He and his {{brothers}} ever tormented Knox by persiflage. Still the preachers must be supported, and to that end, by a singular compromise, the Crown assumed dominion over {{the property of the}} old Church, a proceeding which Mary, if a good Catholic, could not have sanctioned. The higher clergy retained two-thirds of their benefices, and the other third was to be divided between the preachers and the Queen. <b>Vested</b> <b>rights,</b> those of the prelates, and the interests of the nobles to whom, in the troubles, they had feued parts of their property, were thus secured; while the preachers were put off with a humble portion. Among the abbeys, that of St. Andrews, held by the good Lord James, was one of the richest. He appears to have retained all the wealth, for, as Bishop Keith says, [...] "the grand gulf that swallowed up the whole extent of the thirds were pensions given gratis by the Queen to those about the Court [...] . of which last the Earl of Moray was always sure to obtain the thirds of his priories of St. Andrews and Pittenweem." [...] In all, the whole reformed clergy received annually (but not in 1565-66) 24,231 pounds, 17s. 7d. Scots, while Knox and four superintendents got a few chalders of wheat and [...] "bear." [...] In 1568, when Mary had fallen, a gift of 333 pounds, 6s. 8d. was made to Knox from the fund, about a seventh of the money revenue of the Abbey of St. Andrews. {210} Nobody can accuse Knox of enriching himself by the Revolution. [...] "In the stool of Edinburgh," [...] he declared that two parts were being given to the devil, [...] "and the third must be divided between God and the devil," [...] between the preachers and the Queen, and the Earl of Moray, among others. The eminently godly Laird of Pitarro had the office of paying the preachers, in which he was so niggardly that the proverb ran, [...] "The good Laird of Pitarro was an earnest professor of Christ, but the great devil receive the Comptroller." ...|$|E
