5|$|Friedman {{was best}} known for {{reviving}} interest in the money supply as a determinant of the nominal <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>output,</b> that is, the quantity theory of money. Monetarism is the set of views associated with modern quantity theory. Its origins {{can be traced back}} to the 16th-century School of Salamanca or even further; however, Friedman's contribution is largely responsible for its modern popularization. He co-authored, with Anna Schwartz, A Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960 (1963), which was an examination of the role of the money supply and economic activity in the U.S. history. A striking conclusion of their research regarded the way in which money supply fluctuations contribute to economic fluctuations. Several regression studies with David Meiselman during the 1960s suggested the primacy of the money supply over investment and government spending in determining consumption and output. These challenged a prevailing, but largely untested, view on their relative importance. Friedman's empirical research and some theory supported the conclusion that the short-run effect of a change of the money supply was primarily on output but that the longer-run effect was primarily on the price level.|$|E

50|$|Output rose {{so rapidly}} that by 1985 the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> {{production}} generated in sidelines exceeded the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> principal crop and livestock production. To make the gross <b>value</b> <b>of</b> agricultural <b>output</b> more realistically represent agricultural production, statisticians in 1985 limited sideline production to hunting and fishing, collecting wild herbs, and producing family handicrafts. After 1985, therefore, {{there were at least}} three aggregate measures of economic performance: gross <b>value</b> <b>of</b> output; gross <b>value</b> <b>of</b> agricultural <b>output</b> (crops, livestock, forestry, aquatic, and sideline); and gross <b>value</b> <b>of</b> rural society, which included the gross <b>value</b> <b>of</b> agricultural <b>output</b> plus the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> rural industrial, transportation, construction, and other output.|$|R

The aim is not to measure income actually received by workers, but the value which labour contributes to net output along with other factors of production.The underlying {{idea is that the}} <b>value</b> <b>of</b> net <b>output</b> equals the factor incomes that generate it. For this reason, some types of remuneration received by employees are either included or excluded, because they are regarded as either related or unrelated to production or to the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> new <b>output.</b>|$|R

25|$|The gain of a tube is {{typically}} measured {{using one of}} two units. The most common (SI) unit is cd·m−2·lx−1, i.e. candelas per meter squared per lux. The older convention is Fl/Fc (foot-lamberts per foot-candle). This creates issues with comparative gain measurements since neither is a pure ratio, although both are measured as a <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>output</b> intensity over input intensity. This creates ambiguity in the marketing of night vision devices as {{the difference between the}} two measurements is effectively pi or approximately 3.14159 times. This means that a gain of 10,000cd/m²/lx is the same as 31.4159 Fl/Fc.|$|E
25|$|The Service sector {{dominates the}} economy of Maharashtra, {{accounting}} for 61.4% of the value addition and 69.3% of the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>output</b> in the country. The state's per-capita income is 40% higher than the all-India average. The gross state domestic product (GSDP) at current prices for 2011–12 is estimated at 11,995.48billion and contributes about 14.4% of the GDP. The agriculture and allied activities sector contributes 12.9% to the state's income. Net State Domestic Product (State Income), as per the first revised estimates was 10,827.51billion and Per Capita State Income was 95,339 during 2011–12. The percentage of fiscal deficit to GSDP was 1.7 per cent and debt stock to GSDP was 18.4 per cent during 2012–13, well within Consolidated Fiscal Reform Path stipulated by the Thirteenth Finance Commission. In 2012, Maharashtra reported a revenue surplus of 1524.9million (US$24million), with a total revenue of 1,367,117million (US$22billion) and a spending of 1,365,592.1million (US$22billion). Maharashtra ranks first in FDI equity and percentage share of total FDI inflows is 32.28%. Total FDI inflows into Maharashtra are US$53.48billion. Top countries that invested FDI equity in Maharashtra (from January 2000 to December 2011) were Mauritius (39%), Singapore (10%), United Kingdom (10%), United States (7%) and Netherlands (5%).|$|E

5000|$|The net <b>output</b> <b>of</b> a {{particular}} industry should not however {{be confused with}} the total <b>value</b> <b>of</b> its <b>outputs,</b> since in reality that total value includes the value-added by production plus the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> inputs used up (i.e. intermediate consumption) in producing the total <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>outputs.</b> For example, in making a car, a car factory adds value to the materials and components used to make the car. But the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the finished car doesn't just include that value-added in production, but also the materials and ancillary operating costs used to make the car. Thus, if we want to know the total sale <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the <b>output</b> <b>of</b> the car factory, the relevant measure is not the [...] "net output" [...] (the value-added), but rather the gross output. If, for example, we wanted to calculate a [...] "unit labour-cost" [...] for the <b>output</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the cars, the appropriate ratio is between labour costs and the gross <b>output</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the cars. It follows that the total new net <b>output</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> a whole country, after deducting the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> goods and services used up from the gross expenditure or gross sales revenue, is a different concept from the net <b>output</b> <b>of</b> {{a particular}} industry.|$|R
5000|$|Second, {{according}} to the Bortkiewiczian interpretation <b>of</b> Marx's <b>value</b> theory, values and prices constitute two distinct and independent [...] "systems." [...] With respect to relative magnitudes, prices do not depend on values, and values do not depend on prices. Prices <b>of</b> <b>outputs</b> depend on the prices of the inputs used to produce them, while <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>outputs</b> depend on the <b>values</b> <b>of</b> the inputs used to produce them. In contrast, the TSSI is a [...] "single-system" [...] interpretation since it holds that, in Marx's theory, (a) prices <b>of</b> <b>outputs</b> depend in the aggregate on the so-called [...] "value rate of profit" [...] (the ratio of surplus-value to capital invested), while (b) businesses' investments <b>of</b> capital <b>value,</b> and thus the <b>values</b> <b>of</b> the <b>outputs</b> produced, depend partly on the prices of the inputs acquired by means <b>of</b> these investments. <b>Value</b> and price are therefore determined interdependently, though they remain distinct.|$|R
