25|$|Each new {{regeneration}} {{was also}} {{radically different from}} the previous one, even {{in terms of the}} visual effects used to represent the moment of regeneration. The very first regeneration was devised and executed by <b>vision</b> <b>mixer</b> Shirley Coward, who had rather unexpectedly come up with a method of achieving the effect electronically. The original plan of the production team was simply that William Hartnell would fall to the floor at the end of The Tenth Planet and pull his cape over his face. Troughton would then appear at the top of The Power of the Daleks, retracting the cloak. Coward's then-innovative vision mix necessitated that Troughton be hastily contracted for The Tenth Planet, part four. The series' first regeneration sequence was then duly recorded on 8 October 1966, with the cliffhanger resolution filmed two weeks later on 22 October. (REF: The Second Doctor Handbook) Older portrayals of regenerations were either a simple fade between two incarnations, a glowing effect that revealed the next incarnation, or one incarnation morphing into the next.|$|E
2500|$|The {{regeneration}} [...] "effect" [...] {{was accomplished}} during the series' original run from 1963–1989 primarily {{through the use}} of video mixing. Originally, the plan was to have Hartnell collapse at the end of The Tenth Planet with his cloak over his face, which would then be pulled back to reveal Troughton in the next serial. However, <b>vision</b> <b>mixer</b> Shirley Coward discovered and took advantage of a malfunction in the mixing desk which allowed Hartnell's image to be overexposed to the point of almost whiting out the screen, then fading back in to reveal Troughton's face. This also meant that the regeneration scene could take place with both actors at the conclusion of The Tenth Planet, and Troughton was accordingly signed up to participate.|$|E
50|$|A {{software}} <b>vision</b> <b>mixer</b> is a {{piece of}} software which is able to switch between various video sources. In some cases, this software is also able to composite (combine) video from various sources. It essentially acts as a software version of a hardware <b>vision</b> <b>mixer.</b>|$|E

50|$|Besides hard cuts (switching {{directly}} {{between two}} input signals), mixers can also generate {{a variety of}} transitions, from simple dissolves to pattern wipes. Additionally, most <b>vision</b> <b>mixers</b> can perform keying operations and generate color signals (called mattes in this context). Most <b>vision</b> <b>mixers</b> are targeted at the professional market, with newer analog models having component video connections and digital ones using Serial Digital Interface (SDI). They are used in live television with video tape recording (VTR) and video servers for linear video editing, even though the use of <b>vision</b> <b>mixers</b> in video editing has been largely supplanted by computer based Non-linear editing systems (NLE).|$|R

5000|$|Digital video effects, or DVE, for {{manipulation}} of video sources. In newer <b>vision</b> <b>mixers,</b> the DVE is {{integrated into the}} vision mixer; older models without built-in DVE's can often control external DVE devices, or an external DVE can be manually run by an operator.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, {{the company}} {{acquired}} {{the assets of}} Da Vinci Systems, a former company that had won Emmy Awards for film colouring and restoration equipment.

50|$|In {{contrast}} to a hardware <b>vision</b> <b>mixer,</b> a software <b>vision</b> <b>mixer</b> allows for {{a larger number of}} channels, connection types, and transition effects, and allows for greater flexibility of computer-based content integration, text and graphics overlay, and media programming. Another difference between software and hardware vision mixers is that software mixers are limited by the computer's performance. Software vision mixers are generally less expensive than hardware vision mixers.|$|E

Mixers are often equipped with effects memory registers, which can store a snapshot of any part of a complex mixer configuration and then recall the setup with one button press.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two main}} choices for field {{dominance}}: odd or even. With odd field dominance the edit or switch occurs {{at the start of}} the odd field. With even field dominance the edit or switch occurs {{at the start of the}} even field (some equipment, such as <b>vision</b> <b>mixers</b> or switchers allow the field dominance to be set to 'none' which means the switch will occur on the next field boundary after the switch has been pressed).|$|R

The TLC is still viewed today as the de facto standard edit control interface between telecines, color correctors, VTRs and DDRs. TLC (Time Logic Controller) is an edit controller for telecines, <b>vision</b> <b>mixers</b> (switchers), and VTRs. It provides accurate 2:3 editing when transferring 24fps film in a 30fps video environment. TLC 1 was originally made in Moorpark, CA (started in Redondo Beach, then Simi Valley). The TLC 2 was released later that year under the da Vinci brand.|$|R
5000|$|Centralcasting is {{multi-channel}} playout {{that generally}} uses broadcast automation systems with broadcast programming applications.

This provides deterministic control, enabling frame accurate playback, Instant replay or video switching. Many systems consist of a front end operator interface on a separate platform to the controllers - e.g. a Windows GUI will present a friendly easy to use method of editing a playlist, but actually control would be done on a platform with a [...] "real time" [...] operating system such that any large scale playlist amendments do not cause any delays to device control.|$|R
