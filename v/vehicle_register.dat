25|$|The Motor Car Act 1903, {{which came}} into force on 1 January 1904, {{required}} all motor vehicles to be entered on an official <b>vehicle</b> <b>register,</b> and to carry alphanumeric plates. The Act {{was passed in}} order that vehicles could be easily traced {{in the event of}} an accident or contravention of the law. Vehicle registration alphanumeric plates in the UK are rectangular or square in shape, with the exact permitted dimensions of the plate and its lettering set down in law. Front plates are white, whereas back plates are yellow.|$|E

50|$|The <b>vehicle</b> <b>register</b> held by DVLA {{is used in}} many ways. For example, by the DVLA {{itself to}} {{identify}} untaxed vehicles, and by outside agencies to identify keepers of cars entering central London who have not paid the congestion charge, or who exceed speed limits on a road that has speed cameras by matching the cars to their keepers utilising the DVLA database. The current DVLA <b>vehicle</b> <b>register</b> was built by EDS under a £5 million contract signed in 1996, with a planned implementation date on October 1998, though actual implementation was delayed by a year. It uses a client-server architecture and uses the vehicle identification number, rather than the registration plate, as the primary key to track vehicles, eliminating the possibility of having multiple registrations for a single vehicle.|$|E
