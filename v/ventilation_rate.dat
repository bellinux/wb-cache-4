25|$|Dilution {{of indoor}} {{pollutants}} with outdoor air is effective {{to the extent}} that outdoor air is free of harmful pollutants. Ozone in outdoor air occurs indoors at reduced concentrations because ozone is highly reactive with many chemicals found indoors. The products of the reactions between ozone and many common indoor pollutants include organic compounds that may be more odorous, irritating, or toxic than those from which they are formed. These products of ozone chemistry include formaldehyde, higher molecular weight aldehydes, acidic aerosols, and fine and ultrafine particles, among others. The higher the outdoor <b>ventilation</b> <b>rate,</b> the higher the indoor ozone concentration and the more likely the reactions will occur, but even at low levels, the reactions will take place. This suggests that ozone should be removed from ventilation air, especially in areas where outdoor ozone levels are frequently high. Recent research has shown that mortality and morbidity increase in the general population during periods of higher outdoor ozone and that the threshold for this effect is around 20 parts per billion (ppb).|$|E
25|$|Houseplants {{together}} with the medium {{in which they are}} grown can reduce components of indoor air pollution, particularly volatile organic compounds (VOC) such as benzene, toluene, and xylene. Plants remove CO2 and release oxygen and water, although the quantitative impact for house plants is small. Most of the effect is attributed to the growing medium alone, but even this effect has finite limits associated with the type and quantity of medium and the flow of air through the medium. The effect of house plants on VOC concentrations was investigated in one study, done in a static chamber, by NASA for possible use in space colonies. The results showed that the removal of the challenge chemicals was roughly equivalent to that provided by the ventilation that occurred in a very energy efficient dwelling with a very low <b>ventilation</b> <b>rate,</b> an air exchange rate of about 1/10 per hour. Therefore, air leakage in most homes, and in non-residential buildings too, will generally remove the chemicals faster than the researchers reported for the plants tested by NASA. The most effective household plants reportedly included aloe vera, English ivy, and Boston fern for removing chemicals and biological compounds.|$|E

40|$|Objective of {{this paper}} is to examine whether the {{available}} epidemiological evidence provides information on the link between outdoor air <b>ventilation</b> <b>rates</b> and health, and whether it can be used for regulatory purposes when setting ventilation requirements for non-industrial built environments. Effects on health were seen for a wide range of outdoor <b>ventilation</b> <b>rates</b> from 6 - 7 L/s per person, which were the lowest <b>ventilation</b> <b>rates</b> at which no effects on any health outcomes were observed in field studies, up to 25 - 40 L/s per person, which were in some studies the lowest outdoor <b>ventilation</b> <b>rates</b> at which no effects on health outcomes were seen. These data show that, in general, higher <b>ventilation</b> <b>rates</b> in many cases will reduce health outcomes, and that there are the minimum rates, at which some health outcomes can be avoided. But these data have many limitations, such as crude estimation of outdoor <b>ventilation</b> <b>rates,</b> diversity and variability of <b>ventilation</b> <b>rates</b> at which effects were seen, a diversity of outcomes. Among other limitations there are incomplete data on the strength of pollution sources and exposures as well as a wide range of sensibility of the exposed populations. The available data do not provide a sound basis for determining specific outdoor air <b>ventilation</b> <b>rates</b> that can be universally applicable in different public and residential buildings to protect against health risks. They cannot be used for regulative purposes, unless the required <b>ventilation</b> <b>rates</b> are related to actual exposures and are prescribed only when full advantage of other methods for controlling exposures has been taken.

40|$|Abstract. A {{study of}} the {{environmental}} control practices and problems for poultry was conducted in Riyadh area of Saudi Arabia. Information was obtained on the building size, labor, material of construction, cooling and heating systems, and automatic control for fifteen commercial poultry buildings. <b>Ventilation</b> <b>rates</b> to control temperature, moisture and ammonia were estimated and evaluated for every building. Also, supplemental heat capacities to maintain the desired indoor temperature were determined. The {{results showed that the}} floor space for chickens ranged from 0. 052 to 0. 061 m 2 /bird. Walls and roofs were constructed with metal panels, concrete blocks and insulating materials. Cooling was accomplished by fan and pad evaporative cooling systems. The result obtained from this study indicated that summer <b>ventilation</b> <b>rates</b> were between 0. 80 - 1. 51 air exchanges per minute, and between 0. 31 - 0. 46 air exchanges per minute for winter. It was predicted that <b>ventilation</b> <b>rates</b> during summer could control moisture and ammonia in all farms, while could not control temperature in 33 % of farms. The results indicated that ventilation was necessary during winter to control temperature, moisture and ammonia. During winter days, estimated <b>ventilation</b> <b>rates</b> for temperature control were higher than those required for ammonia and moisture control. However, during winter nights, predicted <b>ventilation</b> <b>rates</b> for ammonia control were higher than those required for temperature and moisture control. Therefore, <b>ventilation</b> <b>rates</b> for ammonia control were considered to be minimum <b>ventilation</b> <b>rates,</b> and to be continuous during night. In such a condition, supplemental heat was required to maintain the building at the desired air temperature. Winter <b>ventilation</b> <b>rates</b> were much higher than those required for moisture and ammonia control. This increased mixing of cold outside air with warm inside air. Therefore, indoor temperature could not be maintained at the desired level during winter season even though thermal outputs for heaters were higher than the predicted supplemental heat capacity. Heat was distributed in the building by discharging hot air directly or through perforated polyethylene duct. Some major problems of environment control were salt precipitation and dust accumulation in the cooling pad, non-uniform temperature in the building, and low efficiency of cooling and heating systems. Some recommendations to improve the performance of the environmental control systems for poultry buildings in Saudi Arabia were presented...|$|R
