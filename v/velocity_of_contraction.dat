5000|$|Cardiac myocytes {{contract}} {{through a}} cross-bridge cycle between the myofilaments, actin and myosin. Chemical {{energy in the}} form of ATP is converted into mechanical energy which allows myosin to strongly bind to actin and produce a power stroke resulting in sarcomere shortening/contraction. Omecamtiv mecarbil specifically targets and activates myocardial ATPase and improves energy utilization. This enhances effective myosin cross-bridge formation and duration, while the <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> <b>contraction</b> remains the same. It also increases the rate of phosphate release from myosin, thereby accelerating the rate-determining step of the cross-bridge cycle, which is the transition of the actin-myosin complex from the weakly bound to the strongly bound state. [...] The overall result of omecamtiv mecarbil is an increase in left ventricular systolic ejection time, sarcomere shortening and stroke volume, while the systolic pressure remains the same. [...] This causes a decrease in heart rate while myocardial oxygen consumption is unaffected. The increased cardiac output is independent of intracellular calcium and cAMP levels. [...] Thus omecamtiv mecarbil improves systolic function by increasing the systolic ejection duration/stroke volume, without consuming more ATP energy, oxygen or altering intracellular calcium levels causing an overall improvement in cardiac efficiency.|$|E
40|$|Air {{muscles are}} simple {{pneumatic}} devices that have high {{potential to be}} used as robotic manipulators, as they have a behavior similar to biological motors or muscles. Hence, they have a wide range of potential applications in areas such as robotics, bio-robotics, biomechanics, and artificial limb replacements. In addition to the similarity to biological muscle, air muscles have the advantages of good power-to-weight ratio, being compliant, and low cost. This thesis primarily quantifies the relationship between <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> <b>contraction</b> of air muscles and the force applied on it, which is a key characteristic of biological skeletal muscle. First, an experimental test rig was used to measure the <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> <b>contraction</b> of air muscles as a function of applied force, supply pressure, and supply volumetric flow rate. Second, a theoretical model is proposed to quantify the relationship between the <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> <b>contraction</b> and force applied on it and to explain the experimental results. Three air muscles having different lengths and diameters were tested for loads ranging from 0 to 6 kg at 20 psi, 40 psi and 60 psi at two different flow rates. All three air muscles were made up of latex tubing sheathed with the Techflex, FlexoPet braided sleeve. The primary air muscle was 5 inches long, with the diameter of the inner tube measuring 3 / 4 of an inch. The second muscle had half the length (2. 5 inches) and was the same diameter as the primary air muscle. The third air muscle was the same length as the first (5 inches long), but half of the diameter (3 / 8 of an inch). The velocity of the contraction was measured {{with the help of the}} linear potentiometer. Both the theoretical model and the experimental results found that as the force applied on the air muscles is increased, maximum length of contraction and <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> <b>contraction</b> decrease. Both model and experiment showed that the <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> <b>contraction</b> increases as a function of both pressure and volume flow rate...|$|E

40|$|The esophageal primary motor {{disorders}} like achalasia, diffuse esophageal spasm or the nutcracker {{can involve}} the upper esophageal sphincter, the esophageal body, the lower esophageal sphincter {{or a combination}} of them. This article will focus on the esophageal body and abnormal peristalsis. A normal esophageal peristaltic contraction occurs after a latency period following a swallow and requires a minimum amplitude to be propulsive. Abnormal latencies may generate simultaneous contractions whereas low amplitude contractions may be inefficient i. e. GERD and high amplitude contractions my provoke chest pain or dysfagia i. e. diffuse spasm. The latency period between deglutition and contraction is due to a muscle inhibition immediately after the swallow. This inhibition is due to release of NO by an inhibitory neurone located in the myenteric plexus. At the end of the inhibition, the contraction occurs due to release of acetyl choline by an excitatory cholinergic neurone. The exact interplay between these two neurones will determine the > or propagation velocity and the amplitude <b>of</b> esophageal <b>contractions.</b> Patients with achalasia have a predominant loss of inhibitory neurones (VIP and NOS) with a relative preservation of excitatory cholinergic neurones. The histophatologic and immunohistochemical status in patients with esophageal primary motor disorders other than achalasia is poorly characterised Examples of deglutitive inhibition in the esophagus can be observed during the relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter or when a subject swallows very frequently. In order to quantify deglutitive inhibition we developed a method that induces an artificial high pressure zone in the mid esophageal body. During the latency period after a swallow, the high pressure zone relaxes (is inhibited). With this method, we could measure the magnitude and duration of the inhibitory phenomenon. There is a very good correlation between the degree of deglutitive inhibition and propagation <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> esophageal <b>contractions.</b> The less inhibition, the faster the propagation <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> <b>contractions.</b> Simultaneous contractions are the consequence of absent inhibition. Patients with esophageal primary motor disorders may have very fast propagating contractions and a small percentage <b>of</b> simultaneous <b>contractions</b> or up to 100 % <b>of</b> simultaneous <b>contractions.</b> The correlation between the degree of inhibition and propagation <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> <b>contractions</b> suggests that the different primary motor disorders are the expression of a progressive failure in esophageal inhibition. status: publishe...|$|R

30|$|Their are two muscle contraction-related {{issues that}} {{potentially}} influence energy demand and RE; <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> <b>contraction</b> and balance between concentric and eccentric contractions.

The proposed mechanism {{for this is that}} muscle contractions are primarily isometric, adjusting the stiffness of the muscle-tendon unit during the eccentric phase to produce simultaneous deceleration and elastic stretch, then producing a nearly isometric impulse that initiates ballistic concentric acceleration. This proposed mechanism would promote optimization by exploitation ‘free’ elastic energy, and minimizing metabolic requirements. Such optimization would obviously demand precise timing, and integration and refinement of the temporal, kinetic and kinematic patterns, which would require considerable practice and training.|$|E

40|$|Unlike {{in adult}} heart, {{embryonic}} myocardium works at low PO 2 and depends preferentially on glucose. Therefore, {{activity of the}} embryonic heart during anoxia and reoxygenation should be particularly affected by changes in glucose availability. Hearts excised from 4 -d-old chick embryos were submitted in vitro to strictly controlled anoxia-reoxygenation transitions at glucose concentrations varying from 0 to 20 mmol/L. Spontaneous and regular heart contractions were detected optically as movements of the ventricle wall and instantaneous heart rate, amplitude <b>of</b> <b>contraction,</b> and <b>velocities</b> <b>of</b> <b>contraction</b> and relaxation were determined. Anoxia induced transient tachycardia and rapidly depressed contractile activity, whereas reoxygenation provoked a temporary and complete cardioplegia (oxygen paradox). In the presence of glucose, atrial rhythm became irregular during anoxia and chaotic-periodic during reoxygenation. The incidence of these arrhythmias depended on duration of anoxia, and no ventricular ectopic beats were observed. Removal of glucose or blockade of glycolysis suppressed arrhythmias. These results show similarities but also differences {{with respect to the}} adult heart. Indeed, glucose 1) delayed and anoxic contractile failure, shortened the reoxygenation-induced cardiac arrest, and improved the recovery of contractile activity; 2) attenuated stunning at 20 mmol/L but worsened it at 8 mmol/L; and 3) paradoxically, was arrhythmogenic during anoxia and reoxygenation, especially when present at the physiologic concentration of 8 mmol/L.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To define {{properly}} {{the consequences}} of oxygen deprivation and readmission for {{the functioning of the}} developing heart. METHODS: Spontaneously beating hearts excised from three-day-old chick embryos were loaded with a drop of viscous nontoxic silicone oil and cultured in a special chamber in which variations of PO 2 at the tissue level could be strictly controlled. All parts of the hearts were simultaneously submitted to identical changes in PO 2. Instantaneous heart rate, myocardial shortening, <b>velocities</b> <b>of</b> <b>contraction</b> and relaxation, and mechanical propagation along the heart tube were determined photometrically. RESULTS: The hearts, submitted to a PO 2 ramp (0 to 9. 3 kPa) or absolute anoxia, reacted rapidly, reversibly and reproducibly. Under sustained anoxia, ventricular activity stopped after 3. 8 ± 0. 7 mins (n= 4) and then resumed intermittently in the form of tachycardic bursts. Brief anoxia (1 min) provoked tachycardia followed by bradycardia, induced contracture, depressed contractility and retarded atrioventricular propagation. Upon reoxygenation, ventricular contractions ceased suddently for 20 ± 11 s (n= 5), whereas a residual atrial activity could persist. The duration of this arrest and the rate of recovery depended on duration of the preceding anoxia. Such a dysfunction constitutes the embryonic analogue of the oxygen paradox observed in adult hearts. Initial impulses, including arrhythmic activity, originated exclusively from the atrium, and no ventricular ectopic beats were detected whatever the conditions of oxygenation.

All except the patient receiving propranolol had normal left ventricular function in systole with normal measurements of fractional fibre shortening (% delta S, EF) and normal measurements relating to the <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> ventricular <b>contraction</b> (mean Vcf, mean <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> posterior wall motion). Stroke volume and cardiac output were normal in some patients but were increased in patients with fluid overload. Early diastolic compliance of the left ventricle seemed to be normal except in the patient with recurrent cardiac failure. The study provided no evidence for the existence of a specific uraemic cardiomyopathy...|$|R
40|$|Selective {{breeding}} {{for performance}} has resulted in distinct breeds of horse, such as the Quarter Horse (bred for acceleration) and the Arab (bred for endurance). Rapid acceleration, seen during Quarter Horse racing, requires fast powerful muscular contraction and the generation of large joint torques, particularly by the hind limb muscles. This study compared hind limb moment arm lengths in the Quarter Horse and Arab. We hypothesized that Quarter Horse hind limb extensor muscles would have longer moment arms {{when compared to the}} Arab, conferring a greater potential for torque generation at the hip, stifle and tarsus during limb extension. Six Quarter Horse and six Arab hind limbs were dissected to determine muscle moment arm lengths for the following muscles: gluteus medius, biceps femoris, semitendinosus, vastus lateralis, gastrocnemius (medialis and lateralis) and tibialis cranialis. The moment arms of biceps femoris (acting at the hip) and gastrocnemius lateralis (acting at the stifle) were significantly longer in the Quarter Horse, although the length of the remaining muscle moment arms were similar in both breeds of horse. All the Quarter Horse muscles were capable of generating greater muscle moments owing to their greater physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) and therefore greater isometric force potential, which suggests that PCSA is a better determinant of muscle torque than moment arm length in these two breeds of horse. With the exception of gastrocnemius and tibialis cranialis, the observed muscle fascicle length to moment arm ratio (MFL : MA ratio) was greater for the Arab horse muscles. It appears that the Arab muscles have the potential to operate at slower <b>velocities</b> <b>of</b> <b>contraction</b> and hence generate greater force outputs when compared to the Quarter Horse muscles working over a similar range of joint motion; this would indicate that Arab hind limb muscles are optimized to function at maximum economy rather than maximum power output...|$|R
