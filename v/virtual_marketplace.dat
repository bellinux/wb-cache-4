And, thus, Annadurai explained that to change this situation, a separate Dravida Nadu must be demanded.

50|$|It {{has been}} argued that the Internet modifies the supply chain due to market transparency. Disintermediation has {{acquired}} a new meaning {{with the advent of the}} <b>virtual</b> <b>marketplace.</b> The <b>virtual</b> <b>marketplace</b> sellers like Amazon are edging out the middlemen. Direct sellers and buyers connect with each other because of the platform created by the <b>virtual</b> <b>marketplace</b> vendor. There is quid pro quo for the vendor for the use of the platform, else it would make no business sense to create such a platform. If the buyer, having connected with the seller, circumvents the platform and talks to the buyer and does her deal directly with the buyer, then the platform owner is unlikely to get her revenue share. This may be considered a new form of disintermediation.|$|E

We have developed a multi-agent architecture for a virtual sales assistant. Agents use high level abstractions for representing, reasoning and planning human-like dialogs. These include mental abstractions such as belief, desire and intention as well as social abstractions such as role relationships and commitments. We design interactions through the development of protocols which specify conventions of behaviour and endow agents with social awareness.

In large and small environments translational body-based information significantly improved the accuracy of participants' cognitive maps, measured using estimates of direction and relative straight line distance but, on its own, rotational body-based information had no effect. In environments of small extent, full body-based information also improved participants' navigational performance. The experiments show that locomotion devices such as linear treadmills would bring substantial benefits to virtual environment applications where large spaces are navigated, and theories of human navigation need to reconsider the contribution made by body-based information, and distinguish between environmental scale and extent...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – The {{purpose of}} marketplaces in an {{economic}} sense is the offering of a venue for selling and buying goods. On the internet, <b>virtual</b> <b>marketplaces</b> for trading goods have also been known since the 1990 s. More recently, the marketplace idea has been extended towards the exchange of highly-specialised, custom services which are technically implemented as redistributable web services. As opposed to tradable goods which are sold at a discrete point in time, the service marketplace retains its functionality beyond the purchase through continuous contracting and management of services. This additional activity increases the amount of required resources. For a scalable exchange between thousands of users, the underlying system and middleware thus needs to adhere to scalability principles known from service-oriented architectures. This paper confirms the idea of representing the middleware {{as a set of}} distribute...|$|R
40|$|Market {{design is}} {{becoming}} a very important research topic {{in the context of}} the electronic economy. Two factors explain this trend: (1) the creation of new markets to facilitate deregulation (telecommunication frequencies, electric power, etc.) and (2) the emergence of strategic analysis and of experimental economics. E-commerce tools will contribute to the emergence of more structured marketplaces. Private service providers will begin offering pricediscovery and demand-and-supply equilibrating mechanisms. Market design issues are therefore becoming important for private e-commerce service providers. The TEM (Towards Electronic Marketplaces) project investigates issues related to the design of <b>virtual</b> <b>marketplaces,</b> whether these marketplaces are centralised or decentralised. In this paper, we present the global objectives of the TEM project, along with its specific goals, and current results.

Indeed, ICT has led to the creation of virtual trading areas where products, services, and information are sold [27]. Furthermore, due to the on-demand availability of large computing power, high-capacity storage as a service from the cloud, and application service provisioning, completely new categories of goods have emerged, most notably data. Data in various forms (raw, aggregated, processed in various forms, etc.) can nowadays be traded just like any other good, and platforms supporting this resemble marketplaces for traditional goods.|$|R

40|$|New services, like {{fabrication}} spaces, 3 D printer rentals and <b>virtual</b> <b>marketplaces,</b> {{have made}} it easier for empowered consumers to co-create innovative products without almost any involvement of traditional companies. Adopting a consumer-grounded view, this work takes a step forward from the existing service literature by investigating the link between psychological motives and happiness in co-creation. Specifically, the study measures how community affiliation, personal growth, and utilitarian motives are predictors of subjective well-being. The results illustrate that community affiliation and personal growth motives predict high scores of subjective well-being, while utilitarian motives do not. In addition, empowered consumers who co-create with others are happier than consumers who create alone. This indicates that direct interactions are not only a powerful platform for service co-creation, but are also predictors of subjective well-being. We discuss the implications for traditional companies and for decision makers regarding the benefits offered by digital fabrication services...|$|R
