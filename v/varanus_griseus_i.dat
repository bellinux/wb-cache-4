50|$|Amblyomma gervaisi is a hard-bodied tick of {{the genus}} Amblyomma. The tick is a {{parasite}} of snakes, such as Naja naja, Python molurus species and monitor species such as Varanus ocellatus, Varanus yemenensis, <b>Varanus</b> benghalensis, <b>Varanus</b> <b>griseus</b> and many other Varanus speciesin southeastern Asia and Asia-minor. They exhibit sexual dimorphism. They {{can be found in}} Sri Lanka, India, Yemen, Saudi Arabia. It is a potential vector for Coxiella burnetii.|$|R
50|$|Repetek Biosphere State Reserve, often {{referred}} to as Repetek Nature or Desert Reserve, (Repetek goraghanasy) is a desert nature reserve (zapovednik) of Turkmenistan, located in Lebap Province, East Karakum Desert, near Amu Darya. It is located approximately 70 km south from Türkmenabat and is known for its zemzen (desert monitor which is <b>Varanus</b> <b>griseus).</b> Established in 1928 for the study and preservation of a sand-desert ecosystem, it covers an area of 346 km2.|$|R
25|$|Reptile and {{amphibian}} fauna is {{poor in the}} Tibesti range. There are gecko populations, {{including the}} Algerian sand gecko (Tropiocolotes steudneri), northern sand gecko (Tropiocolotes tripolitanus), Ragazzi's fan-footed gecko (Ptyodactylus ragazzii), ringed wall gecko (Tarentola annularis) and yellow fan-fingered gecko (Ptyodactylus hasselquistii). Snake species include the braid snake (Coluber rhodorachis), horseshoe whip snake (Hemorrhois hippocrepis), long-nosed worm snake (Leptotyphlops macrorhynchus), and the Saharan horn viper (Cerastes cerastes). Among the lizards are Bell's dabb lizard (Uromastyx acanthinura), Bibron's agama (Agama impalearis), the desert monitor (<b>Varanus</b> <b>griseus),</b> red spotted lizzard (Mesalina rubropunctata), and the sandfish (Scincus scincus).|$|R
50|$|Like {{most members}} of the genus <b>Varanus,</b> V. <b>griseus</b> is a carnivore. The {{preferred}} prey of the species is mice, eggs, or fish, but it will also prey on smaller mammals, reptiles, birds, amphibians, insects, or other invertebrates, if the opportunity presents itself.|$|R
40|$|Ten monitors, <b>Varanus</b> <b>griseus</b> {{collected}} from various localities in Egypt were examined for protozoan blood parasites. A {{new species of}} the genus Haemogregarina senso lato is reported from six of these monitors. Blood forms of Haemogregarina roshdyi n. sp. are described. These forms produce changes to the shape and structure of infected cells including stretching and slight dehaemoglobization of infected cells and displacement of the nuclei. Despite of the low parasitaemia observed in the blood, schizogonic stages have been observed in the lungs and liver. The new species is compared with other species of haemogregarines described previously from varanids. يصف الباحثون نوعاً جديداً من الهيموجريجارنيات في دم الورل الصحراوي من مصر ، ويشتمل البحث على وصف تفصيلي لمختلف مراحل الطفيلي التي تصيب خلايا الدم الحمراء ، وتؤدي إلى حدوث بعض التغيرات في تلك الخلايا وإزاحة أنويتها ، كما تم وصف مراحل نمو تلك الطفيليات في الرئتين والكبد ، فضلا عن مقارنة النوع الجديد بالأنواع الأخرى التي سبق وصفها من زواحف الورل في أفريقيا...|$|R
40|$|Remains of a varanid lizard {{from the}} middle Pleistocene of the Tourkobounia 5 {{locality}} near Athens, Greece are described. The new material comprises cranial elements only (one maxilla, one dentary, and one tooth) and is attributed to Varanus, the genus to which all European Neogene varanid occurrences have been assigned. Previously, the youngest undisputed varanid from Europe had been recovered from upper Pliocene sediments. The new Greek fossils therefore constitute the youngest records of this clade from the continent. Despite being fragmentary, this new material enhances {{our understanding of the}} cranial anatomy of the last European monitor lizards and is clearly not referable to the extant <b>Varanus</b> <b>griseus</b> or <b>Varanus</b> niloticus, the only species that could be taken into consideration on a present-day geographic basis. However, these fossils could represent a survivor of the monitor lizards of Asian origin that inhabited Europe during the Neogene. This work was supported by [...] .

40|$|We have updated {{the list}} of the lizard species present in Qatar and {{produced}} the first distribution maps based on two field surveys in 2012 and 2013. We used the QND 95 /Qatar National Grid with a grid of 10 × 10 km squares for mapping. Our results show the occurrence of 21 lizard species in Qatar, from the 15 species indicated in the last biodiversity report conducted in 2004. The most abundant family found in Qatar is Gekkonidae with nine species (Bunopus tuberculatus, Cyrtopodion scabrum, Hemidactylus robustus, H. flaviviridis, H. persicus, Stenodactylus arabicus, S. slevini, S. doriae, Pseudoceramodactylus khobarensis), followed by Lacertidae with four species (Acanthodactylus schmidti, A. opheodurus, Mesalina brevirostris, M. adramitana), Agamidae with three species (Trapelus flavimaculatus, Uromastyx aegyptia, Phrynocephalus arabicus), Scincidae with two species (Scincus mitranus, Trachylepis septemtaeniata), and Varanidae (<b>Varanus</b> <b>griseus),</b> Sphaerodactylidae (Pristurus rupestris) and Trogonophiidae (Diplometopon zarudnyi) with one species each. The species richness fluctuated largely across Qatar between one and eleven species per grid square. We believe that the lizard fauna records in Qatar are still incomplete and that additional studies are required. However, our study here fills a gap concerning lizard biodiversity knowledge in the Gulf Region...|$|R
50|$|A {{major threat}} to this species is habitat loss and disturbance. Human {{activity}} such as tourists walking through protected areas, pollution, unsustainable harvesting and urbanisation can destroy nesting sites. Plover populations can also be affected by rural human activity, for example fishermen walking through protected plover breeding sites, bringing large amounts of dogs with them- a known predator of plover eggs. Natural predators are also a problem, {{as many of these}} predators appear to thrive unnaturally well in the presence of plover breeding grounds, such as the brown-necked raven (Corvus ruficollis) in Maio, Cape Verde, the White-tailed Mongoose (Ichneumia albicauda) in Saudi Arabia, and the Grey Monitors (<b>Varanus</b> <b>griseus)</b> in Al Wathba Wetland Reserve. It is thought that the high amount of prey available to these predators attracts them into the breeding grounds- an effect named the ‘honey pot’, Global warming and climate change also plays a role in the decline of areas available for plovers to breed and reside in. It is known that the Kentish plover prefers to build its nests on low-elevated land close to water, and a study untaken in Saudi Arabia discovered that 11% of nests in the study site were in fact below sea level, therefore rising sea levels are predicted to have disastrous consequences for these low-sitting nests,.|$|R
50|$|<b>Varanus</b> <b>griseus</b> {{monitor lizards}} {{normally}} display {{a variety of}} body coloration from light brown and yellow to grey. They average about one meter in length, but can reach total body lengths of almost two meters. These lizards can also have horizontal bands on either their backs or tails, along with yellow spots across their backs. Their young are normally a brightly colored orange and have distinctive bands across their backs which may be lost as they mature. Their nostrils are slits located farther back on their snouts (closer to the eyes than the nose), and their overall body size {{is dependent on the}} available food supply, the time of year, environmental climate, and reproductive state. Males are generally larger and more robust than females, but females have a more gentle look about them. Those differences allow males to be distinguished from females from a distance without careful inspection. Adult monitor lizards also go through periods of molting in which they shed their outer layer of skin to expand their overall body size. This process can take several months and happens around three times per year. Their skin is adapted to the desert environment where they live, and they are excellent swimmers and divers and have been known to enter the water occasionally to hunt for food.|$|R
