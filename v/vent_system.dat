The first cruise, on the ship R/V Melville and exploiting the submersible JASON2, lasted from September 22 to October 9. These cruises study {{the large number of}} Fe-oxidizing bacteria that have colonized Lōʻihi. Lōʻihi's extensive <b>vent</b> <b>system</b> is characterized by a high concentration of CO2 and Iron, while being low in sulfide. These characteristics make a perfect environment for iron-oxidizing bacteria, called FeOB, to thrive in.|$|E

50|$|Emissions from {{fossil fuel}} fired water heaters are {{expelled}} {{using a variety}} of venting technologies. Atmospheric <b>vented</b> <b>systems</b> use room air as combustion air and exhaust air. The exhaust air is expelled through the exhaust flue by buoyancy forces resulting from the combustion. Power vent models operate similarly to atmospheric <b>vent</b> <b>systems,</b> but an exhaust fan is added to aid in the expulsion of combustion gases. Direct <b>vent</b> <b>systems</b> do not use room air for combustion; instead, buoyancy forces air from the outside through the water heater combustion system and finally exhausts the combustion gases to the outside. Powered direct-vent systems include an exhaust fan to aid in the expulsion of combustion gasses.|$|R
40|$|Soil vapour {{intrusion}} of subsurface {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) into indoor air of buildings is a significant potential concern at existing sites where chemical releases occur, or at new buildings at Brownfield sites with residual chemical impacts. While soil vapour intrusion mitigation systems are increasingly being implemented, there are limited published data on mitigation performance for VOCs particularly for industrial or commercial buildings or high density residential buildings with below ground parking garages. Data gaps include the effectiveness of passive and active <b>venting</b> <b>systems</b> and reduction in vapour intrusion {{that can be achieved}} relative to unmitigated buildings. Because of lack of knowledge and standardization, design practices and post-mitigation monitoring requirements vary widely and are, in some cases, over-conservative. To address these gaps, a comprehensive empirical review of data on the performance of active and passive <b>venting</b> <b>systems</b> and a study using the Modified Johnson and Ettinger Model was completed. The empirical data indicate performance of passive <b>venting</b> <b>systems</b> are variable in terms of venting air flow rates and pressures. The results of modelling for passive venting indicate a wide range of predicted reduction factors, defined as the vapour attenuation factor for a baseline unmitigated building divided by the attenuation factor for the mitigated case. Because of the potential for depressurized buildings and/or reverse vent stack effect, for passive <b>venting</b> <b>systems</b> a continuous leak free barrier that reduces the potential for soil gas diffusion and advection is essential. The performance of active <b>venting</b> <b>systems</b> can be more readily controlled and quantified based on design principles as supported by the results of modelling, which indicated higher reduction factors than for passive <b>venting</b> <b>systems.</b> For both passive and active <b>venting</b> <b>systems,</b> improved efficiency in venting can be achieved through aerated subfloors. A monitoring framework that is robust but efficient and sustainable is presented that incorporates the concept of a concentration exceedance factor and the type of mitigation system...|$|R
