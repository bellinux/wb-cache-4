Using measures of allocative, technical, and overall efficiency as indicators of a latent "performance" variable, this study specifies and estimates a multiple-indicator, multiple-cause (MIMIC) model of Alberta dairy production. Variables thought to "cause" performance include herd size, milk yield, breeding and <b>veterinary</b> <b>expense,</b> capital-to-labour ratio, concentrate-to-forage ratio, and operator experience. The results show that gains in performance may be made through increased capital intensity, greater spending on breeding and herd health, and, albeit marginally, through increased milk yields.

40|$|Trichomoniasis is a {{venereal disease}} of cattle {{that has caused}} {{significant}} economic losses in American cattle herds for many years. Its return to prominence in South Dakota in 2004 - 2005 is contrasted by the long-standing more endemic nature of the disease in other western states. The rate of diagnosis of trichomoniasis in the region has increased in recent years; whether {{this is due to}} an actual increase in numbers of affected herds or simply heightened awareness of the disease is not clear. Few detailed studies have been conducted to determine the actual prevalence of trichomoniasis in U. S. herds, but a 1990 survey of California beef herds revealed that 15. 8 % of herds had at least one affected bull, with a total of 4. 0 % of all bulls testing positive. In a survey of Nevada samples in the mid- 1980 ’s, 26. 7 - 44. 1 % of ranches that submitted samples had a positive bull.

40|$|Mastitis is a frustrating, costly, {{and complex}} infection. A good, workable, {{effective}} preventive control program {{is presented in}} this NebGuide. Mastitis is an inflammation of the mammary gland usually caused by bacterial infection of udder tissues. Except for rare injuries, infectious bacteria or other pathogens, e. g. yeast, fungi, etc., enter the udder through the teat end. Mastitis in both clinical (obvious abnormality, visible to naked eye) and subclinical stages (unseen signs of abnormality, invisible to naked eye) is a frustrating, costly and complex disease that reduces {{the quality and quantity}} of milk. Mastitis results from a complex interrelationship between the environment, the cow, and a host of bacterial or other pathogenic organisms. Mastitis severity is defined as clinical or subclinical in individual cases. The disease exists at different levels in all herds. The level can be measured by somatic cell count interpretation. The benefits of a good mastitis control program are well documented. Failure to use an effective control program is costly. Losses include reduced milk production, elevated culling losses, added <b>veterinary</b> <b>expense,</b> milk discarded due to drug residues, and extra labor to handle or treat infected cows.

40|$|When in the 1970 s {{and later}} many governments of ACP {{countries}} had to reform their economies and {{cut back on}} public <b>expenses,</b> <b>veterinary</b> services were not spared the suffering. One reaction was for commercial enterprises to jump into this service gap. Privately-run artificial insemination, pest control programmes and clinical services {{are but a few}} examples of this. At the same time, the idea that rural communities had to develop self reliance in many ways started to gain ground. This do-it-your-self thinking also applied to animal health care services for farm animals and community-based animal health care (CBAHC) was born. In two well-documented publications, the Intermediate Technology Development Group East Africa (ITDG-EA) have laid down their experiences in years of supporting and setting up community based services in this field. Community-based animal health care in East Africa describes the history of CBAHC services in Kenya and gives a step-by-step overview on how to set up a CBAHC service and how to operate it, evaluate it and consequently re-direct it. The book offers advice on training requirements for CBAHC workers and trainers, and presents 13 case studies of Kenyan CBAHC services. The role of community-based animal health care in rural development builds on the previous book and can be considered more as a handbook on CBAHC and is a reference book for rural development workers throughout East Africa.

Cost/benefit analysis model was applied to two different situations: in the first situation, a baseline scenario, field survey data without intervention using 1, 280 newborn calves was used in first calving season. In the second situation, the intervention scenario (improved management), 665 newborn calves were used in second calving season during the following year. Calving seasons extended for 7 months from September to March. Calf performance studies were conducted from birth to weaning. Economic model was constructed on Microsoft Excel and used to evaluate the impact of calf mortality on calf enterprise. Results showed that gross margins increased from 13 to 35 % as a result of implementation of intervention measures during the second calving season over baseline scenario. A significant correlation between increased <b>veterinary</b> <b>expenses</b> and an increase in revenues (r 2 = 0. 65, P< 0. 05) was observed.

40|$|Clients {{considerations}} regarding introducing an equine {{health and wellness}} program in veterinary practice. Introduction Equine veterinarians {{spend a lot of}} their time on the road, travelling from one patient to another. Many of them feel they have no control over their agenda and are driven by customer demand. This often results in an inefficiently run practice with not enough working hours accounted for. The introduction of an equine health and wellness program could be a good tool for better time management in equine practice since more convenient timetables and routes can be made in advance. This study tries to gauge client interest in an equine health and wellness program. Material and Method A questionnaire was send to 960 horse owners of a private equine practice in the Netherlands. The questionnaire consisted of questions regarding equine veterinary services provided and <b>veterinary</b> <b>expenses.</b> Also their interest in different templates of equine health and wellness programs was gauged. Results Twenty-six percent of the horse owners returned the questionnaire. Equine veterinary costs average € 246,- (STDEV € 343,-). According to the clients most performed skills by the equine veterinarians are: vaccinations, dental care, parasite control and lameness examination. Seventy-seven percent of the horse owners would like to participate in an equine health and wellness program or is considering it. This program should include vaccinations, dental care, parasite control and lameness checkups, but also blood sampling, nutritional advice and routine clinical check-ups. Owners want access to all of these findings in a digital or paper file and are willing to spend € 123,- (STDEV € 120,-) for a simple version up to € 198,- (STDEV € 110,-) for an extended program. Conclusion Owners of this equine clinic are very much interested in an equine health and wellness program.

40|$|Poisonous {{plants are}} one of the most {{important}} causes of economic losses in the livestock industry throughout the world, especially in those areas where rangeland and pasture grazing are practiced. In the livestock industry in South Africa, total annual costs of plant and fungal poisoning (mycotoxicosis) are conservatively estimated to be R 104 506 077, 8 % of which is due to D. cymosum poisoning. There is no antidote for D. cymosum poisoning of livestock and wide scale eradication by conventional control methods are labour intensive, expensive and often impractical. In South Africa, the communal or emerging farming sectors are the most affected. This is mainly due to the high costs associated with control measures such as fencing, supplementary feeding and <b>veterinary</b> <b>expenses,</b> and / or lack of grazing management with livestock numbers exceeding the biological carrying capacity of the rangeland due to lack of grazing lands. Proper rangeland management is the surest and most economical means of reducing plant poisoning of livestock. Focused research on the ecology of these poisonous plants in rangeland communities to improve rangeland management would assist in the development of these strategies. This study investigated D. cymosum infested savanna communities, focusing on understanding how negative (inter- and intraspecific competition) interactions influence community structure, dynamics and productivity and how plants in D. cymosum communities avoid these negative interactions by investigating their seasonal phenological patterns. Dichapetalum cymosum coexists with trees, such as Burkea africana, Ochna pulchra and Terminalia serecia, as well as shrubs species, such as Pygmaeothamnus zeyheri and Perinari capensis, in well drained, nutrient poor soils. Some plant ecologists contend that in an environment where water is limited, competition is inevitable amongst plants occupying the same above-ground stratum and the same soil horizon. Others contend that plants avoid competition with each other by sharing resources spatially and temporarily. Field experiments were conducted to investigate how the above species interact and coexist with each other in two South African savanna communities. Fourteen (100 m x 100 m) D. cymosum infested sites were identified in each community. Disperal analysis using nearest neighbour distance was used to investigate competition among species, and above ground flowering phenology along niche axes to determine temporal and spatial sharing of resources. The dispersal analysis revealed aggregated populations among species when intraspecific and combined (all individuals independent of species) analyses were conducted. However, in all instances, aggregation among species was not significant. No interspecific competition was observed among species when correlation analysis was performed between nearest neighbour distance and combined canopy cover of the nearest neighbour pair. Intraspecific competition was, however, observed for tree species T. sericea (n = 128; r = 0. 3952; P < 0. 0001) and B. africana (n = 166; r = 0. 49926; P < 0. 0001) and a shrub species, D. cymosum (n = 391; r = 0. 39788; P < 0. 0001). Segregation was found between O. pulchra and both B. africana (S = 0. 999, χ² = 102. 7588, P < 0. 0001) and T. sericea (S = 0. 999, χ² = 57. 8571, P < 0. 0001). Shrub species were also segregated, all with interspecific nearest neighbour pairs occurring less often than expected. The vegetative phenology of all experimental plant species followed the rainfall gradient. Differences in reproductive phenologies were observed between O. pulchra and both B. africana and T. sericea. Dichapetalum cymosum also differed from P. capensis and P. zeyheri in their reproductive phenologies. The differences in the reproductive strategies of at least one of the species in each growth form account for the observed spatial distribution amongst species in these communities. The observed growth patterns shown by the vegetative phenologies, however, suggest that lengthy retention of nutrients is a strategy to avoid competition for nutrient uptake with other species in these communities. Segregation between species and positive correlation iii between nearest neighbour distance and combined canopy cover of the nearest neighbour pairs suggest that intraspecific competition and interspecific facilitation determine D. cymosum woody plant community structure. This study had limited application to rangeland management. However, it can be concluded that grazing of D. cymosum communities should take place during mid-summer, when enough grazing material is available to allow animals to vary their diet. The introduction of animals in poor condition or naïve animals into these lands should be avoided in winter and spring as they will graze non-selectively resulting in D. cymosum poisoning. To utilize these areas as grazing lands, supplements need to be provided to assist in the detoxifications of toxins once ingested.
