5|$|In March 1997, Michigan and the Big Ten {{released}} {{the results of}} an investigation of Martin's relationship with the school. The investigation determined that Martin had nurtured a relationship that involved some minor <b>violations.</b> The <b>violations</b> that were published were that Martin was present at a recruit's home during a visit by head coach Fisher; and he'd given a U-M player a birthday cake. Fisher prevented Martin from committing serious additional <b>violations</b> by keeping him from placing a deposit on an apartment for a player. He also stopped Martin from buying airplane tickets for another player's family. A second October 1997 private investigation also failed to reveal any large <b>violations.</b>|$|E

5|$|Criminologists analyse the nature, causes, {{and control}} of {{criminal}} activity, drawing upon methods across sociology, psychology, and the behavioural sciences.

It is the remit of sociologists to study why these norms exist; how they change over time; {{and how they are}} enforced. The concept of social disorganization is when the broader social systems leads to <b>violations</b> of norms. For instance, Robert K.

40|$|Safe data abstractions {{are widely}} used for {{verification}} purposes. Positive verification results can be transferred from the abstract to the concrete system. When a property is violated in the abstract system, one still has to check whether a concrete <b>violation</b> scenario exists. However, even when the <b>violation</b> scenario is not reproducible in the concrete system (a false negative), it may still contain information on possible sources of bugs. Here, we propose a bug hunting framework based on abstract <b>violation</b> scenarios. We first extract a <b>violation</b> pattern from one abstract <b>violation</b> scenario. The <b>violation</b> pattern represents multiple abstract <b>violation</b> scenarios, increasing the chance that a corresponding concrete <b>violation</b> exists. Then, we look for a concrete <b>violation</b> that corresponds to the <b>violation</b> pattern by using constraint solving techniques. Finally, we define the class of counterexamples that we can handle and argue correctness of the proposed framework. Our method combines two formal techniques, model checking and constraint solving. Through an analysis of contracting and precise abstractions, {{we are able to}} integrate overapproximation by abstraction with concrete counterexample generation...|$|R
