40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} new method for {{planning}} the optimal next view for a probabilistic visual object tracking task. Our method uses a variable number of cameras, can plan an action sequence several time {{steps into the}} future, and allows for real-time usage due to a computation time which is linear both {{in the number of}} cameras and the number of time steps. The algorithm can also handle object loss in one, more or all cameras, interdependencies in the camera’s information contribution, and <b>variable</b> <b>action</b> costs. We evaluate our method by comparing it to previous approaches with a prere-corded sequence of real world images. From K.

First part {{of the program}} theory is the action theory, hypothesising that the GOES treatment positively influences the mediating variables (self-efficacy, social support, pain-coping). The second part, the conceptual theory, hypothesis a positive relationship between these variables and the outcome variables (ADL functioning, physical activity behaviour, quality of life). Methods: Patients were randomly assigned to the GOES or control groups. Questionnaires were used to assess mediating and outcome variables in 103 patients (50 GOES, 53 controls) pre-operatively, and 6 and 26 weeks post-operatively. Results: No difference was seen between the two groups in terms of changes between pre-operative and post-operative mediating <b>variables</b> (<b>action</b> theory). Moderate-to-large correlations explaining reasonable amount of variance (22 %, 25 %, 56 %) were found between the mediating and outcome variables (conceptual theory). Conclusion: The conceptual theory is supported; however, as the treatment did not influence the mediating <b>variables</b> (<b>action</b> theory), it has no added value in its current form. Practice implications: The treatment needs to be adjusted; it is discussed that individualised treatment could be more effective. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Research {{demonstrates}} that within-category visual variability facilitates noun learning; however, {{the effect of}} visual variability on verb learning is unknown. We habituated 24 -month-old children to a novel verb paired with an animated star-shaped actor. Across multiple trials, children saw either a single action from an action category (identical actions condition, for example, travelling while repeatedly changing into a circle shape) or multiple actions from that <b>action</b> category (<b>variable</b> <b>actions</b> condition, for example, travelling while changing into a circle shape, then a square shape, then a triangle shape). Four test trials followed habituation. One paired the habituated verb with a new action from the habituated category (e. g., ‘dacking’ + pentagon shape) and one with a completely novel action (e. g., ‘dacking’ + leg movement). The others paired a new verb with a new same-category action (e. g., ‘keefing’ + pentagon shape), or a completely novel category action (e. g., ‘keefing’ + leg movement). Although all children discriminated novel verb/action pairs, children in the identical actions condition discriminated trials that included the completely novel verb, while children in the <b>variable</b> <b>actions</b> condition discriminated the out-of-category action. These data suggest that – as in noun learning – visual variability affects verb learning and children's ability to form action categories...|$|R

The specific task is essentially a disjunctive scheduling problem complicated by three interdependent factors, (1) multiple capacity resources, (2) action overlap and (3) <b>variable</b> <b>action</b> duration.

40|$|SummaryThe thuggacins are {{macrolide}} antibiotics {{that are}} active against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis. Distinct variants of these structures {{are produced by}} the myxobacteria Sorangium cellulosum So ce 895 and Chondromyces crocatus Cm c 5, which differ in side chain structure and modification by hydroxylation. We report here a comparative analysis of the biosynthetic gene clusters in these strains, which reveals the mechanistic basis for this architectural diversity. Although the polyketide-nonribosomal peptide cores of the molecules are highly similar, the underlying biosynthetic machineries exhibit an unexpected degree of divergence. Furthermore, the S. cellulosum gene cluster contains a crotonyl-CoA reductase (CCR) homolog not present in C. crocatus, which likely participates in assembling the unusual hexyl side chain of the So ce 895 thuggacins, whereas the distinct hydroxylation pattern may result from <b>variable</b> <b>action</b> of a conserved FMN-dependent monooxygenase. Indeed, inactivation of the monooxygenase gene in C. crocatus resulted in production of both mono- and di-deshydroxy thuggacin derivatives, providing direct evidence {{for the role of}} this enzyme in the pathway.

40|$|Background: Although the {{literature}} suggests that reflection has {{a positive impact on}} learning, there is a paucity of evidence to support this notion. Aim: We investigated feedback and reflection in relation to the likelihood that feedback will be used to inform action plans. We hypothesised that feedback and reflection present a cumulative sequence (i. e. trainers only pay attention to trainees' reflections when they provided specific feedback) and we hypothesised a supplementary effect of reflection. Method: We analysed copies of assessment forms containing trainees' reflections and trainers' feedback on observed clinical performance. We determined whether the response patterns revealed cumulative sequences in line with the Guttman scale. We further examined the relationship between reflection, feedback and the mean number of specific comments related to an action plan (ANOVA) and we calculated two effect sizes. Results: Both hypotheses were confirmed by the results. The response pattern found showed an almost perfect fit with the Guttman scale (0. 99) and reflection seems to have supplementary effect on the <b>variable</b> <b>action</b> plan. Conclusions: Reflection only occurs when a trainer has provided specific feedback; trainees who reflect on their performance are more likely to make use of feedback.

40|$|Existing civil {{infrastructure}} {{represents a}} large economic value. Within the actions {{applied to the}} bridges, the traffic load is, in general, the most significant <b>variable</b> <b>action</b> to be considered when the ultimate limit states are under investigation. Consequently, the traffic load models {{play an important role}} in the design of new bridges but also in the reliability assessment of existing structures. This article evaluates the safety of an existing highway bridge in the Netherlands. In order to determine whether the structure can be safely used up to the moment of renovation, a probabilistic assessment of the bridge was performed. Important part of that study was a measurement program in order to determine the distribution of the stresses in the main load bearing structure due to the traffic load. From these measurements the design stresses were extrapolated using a technique for fitting an extreme value distribution to the measured data. Design stresses should be derived such that they provide a sufficient safety level of the bridge. After the semi-probabilistic analysis for all the bridge elements, for one bolted connection in the bottom flange of a main girder, a probabilistic calculation is performed in order to establish the safety level, avoiding all schematizations and possible conservatisms in the calculation rules. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group...|$|E
