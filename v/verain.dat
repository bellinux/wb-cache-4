50|$|Despite the Hoverspeed {{passenger}} service, {{a conventional}} passenger-vehicle freight service was desired for the Dieppe - Newhaven route. Compiled of public bodies, including the General Council of Seine-Maritime, {{the towns of}} Dieppe and Fécamp as well as three Chambers of Commerce, Transmanche Ferries re-opened the route early in 2001 with the chartered Sardinia <b>Vera.In</b> 2006, the Seine-Maritime ran a concession to find a tender to run the Transmanche Services and in December 2006, LD Lines won the tender to run the service and LD Lines then consequently took over the services with the Transmanche Ferries brand which was eventually dissolved into LD Lines although the two newbuilds, Cote D'Albatre and Seven Sisters remained in their original Transmanche Ferries livery even up until this day when they run their services with the Transmanche livery instead of a different livery.In 2012 shortly after SeaFrance went into liquidation, LD Lines and DFDS started a joint service between Dover and Calais which was soon to be brought {{under the name of}} New Channel Company A/S or known as DFDS Seaways France which included the Newhaven-Dieppe, Portsmouth-Le Havre, Dover-Calais and the Dover-Dunkerque which was then all transferred over to DFDS even up to this day.By the end of 2014, DFDS and Seine-Maritime reached an agreement to continue running the service into 2015 with 2 vessels once the Seven Sisters is released from the Le Havre service in Late 2014. This will enable a third daily crossing in each direction during the summer months.|$|E
