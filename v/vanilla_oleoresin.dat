40|$|<b>Vanilla</b> <b>oleoresin</b> is {{a widely}} used natural product, mainly used as flavor. In this work, the {{extraction}} of <b>vanilla</b> <b>oleoresin</b> using supercritical CO 2 is evaluated. The main extraction parameters on the oleoresin yield and composition was determined, namely: pressure, temperature, particle size, and contact time. Results indicate that lower particle size favors mass transfer and oleoresin yield. High pressure and temperature also provide higher yields of <b>vanilla</b> <b>oleoresin.</b> Extreme conditions of pressure and temperature decrease the quality of vanillin possibly because of the degradation of some compounds. The maximum concentration of vanillin (97. 35 % w/w) is found at 408 bars and 40 oC, with a mass yield of 5. 82 % after 40 minutes of dynamic extraction. The extraction of <b>vanilla</b> <b>oleoresin</b> with supercritical CO 2 is possible, and optimizing the operational conditions may provide higher oleoresin yield with good vanillin concentration; an economic analysis {{would be needed to}} determine the best extraction time...|$|E
50|$|The {{resinoids}} {{described above}} should {{be distinguished from}} prepared oleoresins (e.g., pepper, ginger, <b>vanilla</b> <b>oleoresins),</b> which are concentrates prepared from spices by solvent extraction. The solvent that is used depends on the spice; currently, these products are often obtained by extraction with supercritical carbon dioxide. Pepper and ginger oleoresins contain not only volatile aroma compounds, but also substances responsible for pungency.|$|R
