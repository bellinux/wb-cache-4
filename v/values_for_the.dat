5|$|After the {{resolution}} of all disputes, sixteen parties received at least one seat in the People's Representative Council, while eight received none. The inconsistency {{in the order of}} parties according to votes received and seats allocated arose due to a special rule created to address uneven population distribution between Java and other islands. This rule stipulates that the Hare quota <b>values</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> provinces in Java were on average higher than those for the outer islands. A party require fewer votes to automatically secure a seat outside of Java. For example, the National Awakening Party (PKB) received more votes than the National Mandate Party (PAN) but received nearly the same amount of seats. More than half of PKB seats were received in the party's stronghold of East Java, where the quota value was higher. In contrast, only four of PAN seats were automatically secured.|$|E

5|$|Consuming 75% of production, {{the primary}} use for {{strontium}} is in glass for colour television cathode ray tubes, where it prevents X-ray emission. This application for strontium is declining because CRTs are {{being replaced by}} other display methods. This decline has a significant influence on the mining and refining of strontium. All parts of the CRT must absorb X-rays. In the neck and the funnel of the tube, lead glass is used for this purpose, but this type of glass shows a browning effect due to {{the interaction of the}} X-rays with the glass. Therefore, the front panel is made from a different glass mixture with strontium and barium to absorb the X-rays.

5|$|The {{computor}} cabinet {{included only}} four main controls.

Additional windows provided output <b>values</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> indicated airspeed, course, and bombing angle (or range angle). Clips in the upper right held a card with levelling data, as well as notes about the sight or the bombs being dropped. The computor was also connected to several external sources. Compressed air was supplied from the engines to drive the mechanism, and an exhaust allowed the less dense used air to escape. Tubes were also connected to the pitot tube and static air source, which allowed the accurate measurement of airspeed. A separate electrical connection input the direction measured on the distant reading compass, using a selsyn.|$|E

40|$|Background: Maternal {{deprivation}} (MD) in rodents is {{an important}} neurodevelopmental model for studying a variety of behavioral changes which closely resemble the symptoms of schizophrenia in humans. Subjects and methods: To determine whether early-life stress leads {{to changes in the}} limbic system structures: the amygdala and the nucleus accumbens, 9 -day-old Wistar rats were exposed to 24 hour MD. On P 60 the rats were sacrificed for morphometric analysis and their brains were compared to the control group. Results: Results show that MD affected important limbic system structures: the amygdala and the nucleus accumbens, whose volume was decreased (17 % of <b>the</b> control <b>value</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> amygdala and 9 % of <b>the</b> control <b>value</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> nucleus accumbens), as well as the number of neurons (41 % of <b>the</b> control <b>value</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> amygdala and 43 % of <b>the</b> control <b>value</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> nucleus accumbens) and the size of their cells soma (12 % of <b>the</b> control <b>value</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> amygdala and 33 % of <b>the</b> control <b>value</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> nucleus accumbens). Conclusion: This study indicates that early stress in life leads to changes in the morphology of the limbic areas of the brain, most probably due to the loss of neurons during postnatal development, and it further contributes {{to our understanding of the}} effects of maternal deprivation on brain development...|$|R

The melting and boiling points of iron, along with its enthalpy of atomization, are {{lower than those of}} the earlier 3d elements from scandium to chromium, showing the lessened contribution of the 3d electrons to metallic bonding as they are attracted more and more into the inert core by the nucleus; however, they are higher than the <b>values</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> previous element manganese because that element has a half-filled 3d subshell and consequently its d-electrons are not easily delocalized.
