5000|$|The {{crushed stone}} {{materials}} are conveyed to crushing plant by belt conveyor for secondary crushing {{before they are}} sent to <b>vibrating</b> <b>screen</b> to be separated.|$|E
50|$|However more {{material}} can be screened at once for a <b>vibrating</b> <b>screen</b> {{compared to a}} trommel screen. This is because {{only one part of}} the screen area of the trommel screen is utilised during the screening process whilst the entire screen is used for a <b>vibrating</b> <b>screen.</b> Trommel screens are also more susceptible to plugging and blinding, especially when different sized screen apertures are in series. Plugging is when material larger than the aperture may become stuck or wedged into the apertures and then may be forced through which is undesirable. Blinding is when wet material clump up and stick {{to the surface of the}} screen. The vibrations in the vibrating screens reduce the chance of plugging and blinding.|$|E
50|$|Trommel screens {{are cheaper}} to produce than <b>vibrating</b> <b>screens.</b> They are {{vibration}} free which causes less noise than <b>vibrating</b> <b>screens.</b> Trommel screens are more mechanically robust than <b>vibrating</b> <b>screens</b> {{allowing it to}} last longer under mechanical stress.|$|R
50|$|<b>Vibrating</b> <b>screens</b> {{are used}} to {{separate}} bulk materials {{in a mixture of}} different sized particles. For example, sand, gravel, river rock and crushed rock, and other aggregates are often separated by size using <b>vibrating</b> <b>screens.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1996, NIAflow {{development}} began {{under the}} name “NIAexpert” as software for sizing and selection of <b>vibrating</b> <b>screens.</b> Its further development began in 2007 as “NIAproject1” which included a mathematical model to simulate a close-to-reality <b>screening</b> process on <b>vibrating</b> <b>screens.</b> It also offered multi-machine calculations and product forecasts.|$|R
5000|$|The {{purpose of}} the <b>vibrating</b> <b>screen</b> is that {{particles}} are introduced to the gaps in the screens repeatedly. The frequency of the screen must be high enough so that it prevents the particles from blocking the apertures and the maximum height of the particle trajectory should occur when the screen surface is at its lowest point. Based on the principle, there is an optimum frequency and amplitude of vibration [...] Transmission refers to the fraction of desired particle that passes through the apertures in the screen. At low frequency, screening efficiency is high but blinding is severe. Blinding will decrease as frequency increases but the particles will have difficulty going through the apertures. When designing a high frequency <b>vibrating</b> <b>screen,</b> an optimum point of frequency and amplitude must be chosen, depending on the specific applications.|$|E
5000|$|The {{asphalt plant}} is mainly {{composed}} of cold aggregate supply system, drum dryer, coal burner, coal feeder, dust collector, hot aggregate elevator, <b>vibrating</b> <b>screen,</b> filler supply system, weighing and mixing system, asphalt storage, bitumen supply system. All these components have characteristics that impact {{not only the}} overall quality of the asphalt but also the effect on the environment.|$|E
5000|$|A four-bearing <b>vibrating</b> <b>screen</b> (F- Class) was {{developed}} [...] to meet demands especially for iron ore, phosphate and limestone production industries. F-Class features a HUCK-bolted screen body is connected for extra strength and rigidity and carbon steel {{is used for}} the side plates to give high strength. The shaft is strengthened with a reinforcing plate, which attaches to the slide plate and screen panels.|$|E

50|$|Circle-throw <b>vibrating</b> <b>screens</b> {{operate on}} an {{inclined}} surface. A deck moves in a circle. It operates with a continuous feed {{rather than in}} batches, leading to much greater output. The incline allows the feed {{to move through the}} device.|$|R
50|$|Combined raking and sifting technologydiffers from pure sifters {{in that it}} uses {{rotating}} tines {{to scoop}} sand and debris onto a <b>vibrating</b> <b>screen</b> instead of relying simply on the pick-up blade. The tines' position can be adjusted to more effectively guide different-sized materials onto the screen. Once on the screen, combined raking and sifting machines use the same technology as normal sifters to remove unwanted debris from the sand.|$|E
50|$|Production {{procedures}} {{follow a}} multiphase process in an off-site facility. First, production plans {{are created by}} CAD designers from architectural blueprints. Forms are prepared with steel rebar and styrofoam. The concrete mix is created at 5,000 psi and bonds directly to the foam insulation. The panels are then finished with {{the application of a}} <b>vibrating</b> <b>screen</b> to assist flow and fill potential voids, while creating greater surface consistency.|$|E
5000|$|A circle-throw <b>vibrating</b> <b>screen</b> with a {{shaft and}} bearing system {{requires}} {{consideration of the}} loading the unit will undergo. The extra loading to the screen box created by the centrifugal force, due to the circular motion of the load as it passes through the unit is also a factor. Bearings must be designed to accommodate the extra stress. Bearing load due to screen box centrifugal force (Fr) is ...|$|E
50|$|Most {{processes}} {{have employed}} two-bearing screens. Two- bearing circular <b>vibrating</b> <b>screens</b> with a screen box weight of 35 kN {{and speed of}} 1200 RPM were common. The centroid axis of the screen box and unbalanced load does not change during rotation.|$|R
5000|$|On a {{crushing}} and screening plant, punch plates or perforated plates are mostly used on scalper <b>vibrating</b> <b>screens,</b> after raw products pass on grizzly bars. [...] Most likely installed on a tensioned deck, punch plates offer excellent wear life for high-impact and high material flow applications.|$|R
50|$|Trommel screens {{can be used}} in {{a variety}} of {{applications}} such as classification of solid waste and recovery of valuable minerals from raw materials. Trommels come in many designs such as concentric screens, series or parallel arrangement and each component has a few configurations. However depending on the application required, trommels have several advantages and limitations over other screening processes such as <b>vibrating</b> <b>screens,</b> grizzly screens, roller screens, curved screens and gyratory screen separators.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} novel DCD {{products}} was a colour projection TV system based on multiple laser beams (for red, green, and blue light). The system boasted (for the time) impressive brightness / image size, and also, due to the coherent nature of laser light, did not require focussing.However, the coherent laser beam {{gave rise to a}} Speckle pattern in the projected image. This was ameliorated by using a rapidly <b>vibrating</b> <b>screen.</b>|$|E
50|$|Another {{problem that}} is often {{encountered}} is that the particles clump together due to the moist. This {{will result in the}} undesired particle size that is not allowed to pass through the apertures into the product stream. It is recommended that screening at less than around 5mm aperture size is normally performed on perfectly dry materials. A heated screen deck may be used to evaporate the moist in the feed. It will also break the surface tension between the screen wire and the particles. An alternative is to run the feed through a dryer before entering the high frequency <b>vibrating</b> <b>screen.</b>|$|E
50|$|They {{are widely}} used for {{screening}} quarry stone stock and classifying products in mining, sand, gold, energy and chemical industrial processes. The targeted substance is predominantly finer particles, which can then be directed into a separation unit, such as a hydrocyclone or are materials that can be removed and used. Removed materials are often formed intentionally and are classified by their shape, size and physical properties. For example, construction wastes are sorted and sieved by a circular <b>vibrating</b> <b>screen</b> into coarse and fine particles. The particles are taken to make concrete, architectural bricks and road base materials.|$|E
50|$|High {{frequency}} <b>vibrating</b> <b>screens</b> {{are widely}} used in many industrial process, thus there will be high quantity of waste product released into the environment. It is important that these waste streams are treated, since the untreated waste will cause damage to the environment over a sustained period of time.|$|R

This removes deposited byproducts and protects bag fibers from damaging forces. Because filter bags represent 20 to 40 % of any industrial filtering investment, {{this method of}} extending bag life should {{be of interest to}} those responsible for plant maintenance...|$|R
50|$|Screens in {{screening}} plant {{are used to}} group process particles into ranges by size. These size ranges are also called grades. Dewatering screens are used to remove water from the product. Screens can be static, or mechanically <b>vibrated.</b> <b>Screen</b> decks {{can be made from}} different materials such as high tensile steel, stainless steel, or polyethylene.|$|R
50|$|In {{exploring}} ways {{to properly}} attach a transformer to a <b>vibrating</b> <b>screen,</b> Hanco International (http://www.hanco.com) pioneered the Flux-Power Screen Heating System http://www.hanco.com/HancoScreenHeating.html. The invention {{came to be}} in 1961, created by Thomas W. Hannon (http://patimg2.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=03154757&homeurl=http%3A%2F%2Fpatft1.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO1%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526d%3DPALL%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsrchnum.htm%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526s1%3D3,154,757.PN.%2526OS%3DPN%2F3,154,757%2526RS%3DPN%2F3,154,757&PageNum=&Rtype=&SectionNum=&idkey=NONE&Input=View+first+page), and it was unlike anything of its time. The design eliminated the use of physical connections as seen in earlier screen heating systems. Omitting the mechanical connection also deletes the possibility of primary winding failures that come with short circuits on the secondary of the transformer while eliminating wear and fatigue on the screen, itself. This design also allowed for the transformer to be encapsulated and protected from the elements and dust.|$|E
50|$|The {{screening}} process performance {{can be affected}} heavily by many factors, such as intensity of vibration, size fraction of the feed and feed rate. The process performance can be assessed by screening efficiency. It also refers to product yield. Screening efficiency {{is defined as the}} comparison of the undersized materials brought on the screening and discharged oversized product in contrast to the original amount of undersized materials in the feed stream. Tumbler screening technique allows separation efficiency to be as high as 99% due to the circular screening assembly’s three-dimensional oscillations,. which will increase the effective screening area four times greater than normal <b>vibrating</b> <b>screen.</b>|$|E
50|$|High {{frequency}} {{vibrating screens}} {{are the most}} important screening machines primarily utilised in the mineral processing industry. They are used to separate feeds containing solid and crushed ores down to approximately 200μm in size, and are applicable to both perfectly wetted and dried feed. The frequency of the screen is mainly controlled by an electromagnetic vibrator which is mounted above and directly connected to the screening surface. Its high frequency characteristics differentiates it from a normal <b>vibrating</b> <b>screen.</b> The high frequency vibrating screens usually operates at an inclined angle, traditionally varying between 0 and 25 degrees and can go up to a maximum of 45 degrees. Besides, it should operate at a low stroke and has a frequency ranging from 1500 - 7200 RPM.|$|E
50|$|The high {{frequency}} <b>vibrating</b> <b>screens</b> will often {{be used as}} a secondary screener as its purpose is to separate the finer minerals. This not only ensures good separation efficiency, it will also help to maintain the life-time of the screen. Blinding can occur significantly if particle sizes are not within the screens’ designed criteria.|$|R
5000|$|The final {{screening}} plant {{was in a}} two-storey building attached {{to the west of}} the intermediate chalk crusher to which it is connected by two high-level conveyor belts. The upper floor housed two sets of [...] "Niagara" [...] <b>vibrating</b> <b>screens</b> to sort the crushed chalk. The {{screening plant}} discharged into road transport or into a storage building alongside.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A concept, {{coupling}} screening, {{has been}} put forward and the method of the coupling screening is proposed based on the analysis of solo particle kinematics on flat <b>vibrating</b> <b>screening</b> and rotary screening. The kinematics model of coupling screening about solo particle has been constructed. The structure design of coupling screening machine has been done too. Eventually, with analysis of influence factors on relative geometric feature of material is carried out...|$|R
50|$|The circular-throw <b>vibrating</b> <b>screen</b> {{generates a}} {{rotating}} acceleration vector {{and the screen}} must maintain a steep throwing angle to prevent transportation along the screen deck. The deck is commonly constructed to have an angle {{within the range of}} 10° to 18°, in order to develop adequate particle movement. An Increase of deck angle speeds particle motion with proportional relationship to particle size. This decreases residence time and size stratification along the mesh screen. However, if the angle is greater than 20°, efficiency decreases due to reduction of effective mesh area. Effect of deck angle on efficiency is also influenced by particle density. In mining the optimal inclination angle is about 15°. Exceptions are the dewatering screens at 3° to 5° and steep screens at 20° to 40°.|$|E
50|$|An {{alternative}} to the high frequency vibrating screens is the rotary sifter. A rotary sifter uses a screen which rotates in a circular motion and the finer particles are sifted through the apertures. It is also generally used for finger separations; between 12mm to 45μm particle size. The rotary sifter will usually be chosen based {{on the nature of}} the substance being separated; whey, yeast bread mix, cheese powder, fertilizers. The rotary sifter is often preferred in the non-metallurgical industry and operates in a way to achieve a dust and noise free environment. The limitation for the rotary sifter is that it cannot handle a high capacity compared to the high frequency <b>vibrating</b> <b>screen.</b> Both equipment, however, achieve a high screening efficiency.|$|E
50|$|Conventional {{and general}} {{design for a}} high {{frequency}} <b>vibrating</b> <b>screen</b> consists of mainframe, screen web, eccentric bock, electric motor, rub spring and coupler. The two most common types of vibrators which induce the high frequency vibrations are hydraulic or electric vibrators, these electric vibrators are either electric motors or solenoids. Common designs for screening decks are either single or double deck. In addition, another feature of high frequency vibrating screens are the static side plates which provide benefits such as smaller support structure, less noise, longer life, and hence less maintenance. In industry, the screens are operated at a tiled angle up till 40 º. The high frequency (1500 - 7200 rpm) and low amplitude (1.2 - 2.0 mm) characteristics leads to the vertical-elliptical movement that rapidly transports oversized particles down the screen. Creating a thin bed of particles, this improves the efficiency and capacity of the screen.|$|E
40|$|A-weighted {{sound levels}} around <b>vibrating</b> <b>screens</b> in coal {{preparation}} plants often exceed 90 dB(A). The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is actively developing noise controls to reduce noise generated by horizontal <b>vibrating</b> <b>screens.</b> A 121 -microphone, 3. 5 -meter-diameter array {{was used to}} perform beamforming to determine locations of significant noise radiation on the screen. Below about 1 kHz, the screen body {{was found to be}} the most significant noise source. The beamforming contour maps showed several key locations {{on the sides of the}} screen and the feedbox are the most significant contributors. Operating deflection shape (ODS) analysis was used to examine the screen behavior under actual operating conditions. This information is helpful in determining how to modify the screen body to reduce the noise radiated by the screen below 1 kHz. The analysis showed modal vibration patterns on the sides and feed box were the main contributors to noise. The results show several areas on the screen sides and feedbox that can be modified to reduce noise...|$|R

50|$|Sifting technologyis practiced on {{dry sand}} and soft surfaces. The sand and waste are {{collected}} via the pick-up blade {{of the vehicle}} onto a <b>vibrating</b> <b>screening</b> belt, which leaves the sand behind. The waste is gathered in a collecting tray which is often situated {{at the back of}} the vehicle. Because sand and waste are lifted onto the screening belt, sifters must allow time for the sand to sift through the screen and back onto the beach. The size of the materials removed is governed by the size of the holes in the installed screen.|$|R
