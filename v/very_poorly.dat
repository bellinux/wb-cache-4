5|$|Burial PNT-003 was interred at {{the same}} time as Burial PNT-002. The {{deceased}} was an adult male aged between 36 and 55 years old; he was lying face down with a northwest-southeast orientation. The remains were <b>very</b> <b>poorly</b> preserved but the upper canines were both decorated with pyrite incrustations. The deceased was not accompanied by jewellery or funerary offerings.|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum has {{no known}} {{biological}} role in humans. The element is <b>very</b> <b>poorly</b> absorbed after oral administration and when injected its elimination is very slow. Lanthanum carbonate (Fosrenol) was approved as a phosphate binder to absorb excess phosphate {{in cases of}} end stage renal disease.|$|E
5|$|Pyramid B6 {{enclosed}} {{the southern}} {{portion of the}} west side of the Group B plaza. It is <b>very</b> <b>poorly</b> preserved and the top of the pyramid has collapsed, leaving only the lower walls. Archaeological investigation revealed that the final version of the pyramid had been built over a preceding version.|$|E
5000|$|It was {{established}} in Ford County, Illinois, in 1929. Drummer Soil was named for Drummer Creek in Drummer Township. It consists of <b>very</b> deep, <b>poorly</b> drained soils that formed in 40 to 60 in of loess or other silty material and in the underlying stratified, loamy glacial drift. These soils formed under prairie vegetation.|$|R
50|$|Pneumococcal septicemia, or whole-body {{infection}} {{caused by}} the Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria, {{has been reported to}} cause autosplenectomy but is a <b>very</b> rare and <b>poorly</b> understood complication of the infection.|$|R
25|$|Eventually the {{unofficial}} or manufacturer specific scale standards became more established and were adopted by various model railway standardization bodies such as NMRA and MOROP. However, despite of existing scale and gauge standards they were <b>very</b> often <b>poorly</b> implemented {{in design and}} manufacturing processes with commercial manufacturers before the World War II. The conformity to scale standards grew strongly in the 1950s and 1960s when many new model railway accessories manufacturers were born and to whom the standard conformity was vital.|$|R
5|$|The West Pyramid of the E-Group {{produced}} ceramic evidence dating the Late Preclassic, Early Classic and Late Classic. Although {{the limestone}} blocks used for its construction are <b>very</b> <b>poorly</b> preserved, the West Pyramid {{is believed to}} have been a radial pyramid dating to the Late Preclassic Period.|$|E
5|$|An initial UN counteroffensive out of Masan proved {{ineffective}} in stopping the North Koreans from advancing. In the subsequent fight, the 35th Infantry {{was able to}} repel the North Koreans at the Battle of Nam River and were highly regarded for these actions. However, the 24th Infantry performed <b>very</b> <b>poorly</b> at the battles of Blue Mountain and Haman, forcing the 25th Division to muster reserves to counter the North Korean gains against the 24th.|$|E
5|$|Before modern whaling {{began in}} the late 19th century, blue whales were obscure and <b>very</b> <b>poorly</b> understood. They, along with other large whales were mythologized and indistinguishable from sea monsters. Even after the first {{specimens}} were described, the blue whale went by many names and scientists often described their specimens as new species. Descriptions and illustrations were inaccurate. The taxonomy was eventually resolved, but many mysteries remained.|$|E
60|$|He was <b>very</b> plainly, even <b>poorly</b> clad, {{and looked}} a dark figure even amongst these soberly appareled gentry. The grass {{beneath his feet}} had deadened {{the sound of his}} {{footsteps}} but Sir Marmaduke had apparently perceived him, for he beckoned to him to approach.|$|R
50|$|The scented flowers, are 7 - 10 cm in diameter. They come {{in shades}} of blue, from sky-blue, mid-blue, grey-blue, lilac-blue, lavender, to blue-purple, or lilac violet.There is {{occasionally}} a white, or very pale blue form. But they are not <b>very</b> vigorous and <b>poorly</b> lived.|$|R
30|$|The study {{reported}} in the present paper explored the epidemiology of TS in a defined population within Merseyside, using a well-defined case definition. These results are of interest to a broad audience and offer {{some insight into the}} epidemiology and aetiology of this <b>very</b> common but <b>poorly</b> understood disease.|$|R
5|$|Daniel Craig was a late auditionee for {{the role}} of Geordie. At the audition, he {{performed}} the Geordie accent <b>very</b> <b>poorly,</b> however, he won the part and it came to be regarded as his breakthrough role. Mark Strong worked on the Geordie accent by studying episodes of the 1980s comedy series Auf Wiedersehen, Pet, which featured lead characters from Newcastle. Strong later claimed that Christopher Eccleston took a dislike to him, and outside of their scenes together, the pair did not speak for the entire period that Our Friends in the North was filming.|$|E
5|$|Maya {{textiles}} are <b>very</b> <b>poorly</b> {{represented in}} the archaeological record, although by comparison with other pre-Columbian cultures, such as the Aztecs and the Andean region, {{it is likely that}} they were high-value items. A few scraps of textile have been recovered by archaeologists, but the best evidence for textile art is where they are represented in other media, such as painted murals or ceramics. Such secondary representations show the elite of the Maya court adorned with sumptuous cloths, generally these would have been cotton, but jaguar pelts and deer hides are also shown.|$|E
5|$|Platform A4 {{divides the}} Group A plaza in two. It was a later {{addition}} to Group A during the reorganisation {{of the group}} that involved the destruction of the earlier building under Platform A5. When excavated it was <b>very</b> <b>poorly</b> reserved but was able to be reliably restored. There was no earlier version of the structure; it consists of a platform with two levels that faces east towards the principal architecture of Group A. The upper level is topped with a cornice and access was via two stairways flanked by balustrades.|$|E
5000|$|The twins' magical {{abilities}} are initially <b>very</b> primal and <b>poorly</b> controlled. It is not until they meet Giovanne (approximately {{halfway through the}} series) that they learn that their magic manifests itself in [...] "seven powers", which can be summoned at any time, {{so long as the}} twins can physically touch hands.|$|R
60|$|It {{was between}} nine and ten o'clock when, strolling in a melancholy manner through the town, I stopped at Mr. Omer's door. Mr. Omer {{had taken it}} so much to heart, his {{daughter}} told me, {{that he had been}} <b>very</b> low and <b>poorly</b> all day, and had gone to bed without his pipe.|$|R
40|$|The {{behaviour}} of finite {{covers of}} 3 -manifolds is a <b>very</b> important, but <b>poorly</b> understood, topic. There are three, increasingly strong, conjectures {{in the field}} that have remained open for over twenty years – the virtually Haken conjecture, the positive virtual b 1 conjecture and the virtually fibred conjecture. Any of thes...|$|R
5|$|Stelae became closely {{associated}} with the concept of divine kingship and declined {{at the same time as}} this institution. The production of stelae by the Maya had its origin around 400BC and continued through to the end of the Classic Period, around 900, although some monuments were reused in the Postclassic (c. 900–1521). The major city of Calakmul in Mexico raised the greatest number of stelae known from any Maya city, at least 166, although they are <b>very</b> <b>poorly</b> preserved.|$|E
5|$|By the 1970s and 1980s, the New York City Subway was at {{an all-time}} low. Ridership had dropped to 1910s levels, and {{graffiti}} and crime were rampant on the subway; in general, the subway was <b>very</b> <b>poorly</b> maintained during that time, and delays and track problems were common. Still, the NYCTA managed to open six new subway stations in the 1980s, make the current fleet of subway cars graffiti-free, as well as order 1,775 new subway cars. By the early 1990s, conditions had improved significantly, although maintenance backlogs accumulated during those 20 years are still being fixed today.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} round of the NCAA Tournament, Georgetown faced Wyoming and won 5143. The Hoyas then beat the Fresno State Bulldogs by eighteen, after leading by five at halftime, to advance to the {{regional}} finals. Georgetown faced off against Oregon State in the regional final. In the game, the Hoyas shot very well from the field, setting the tournament record for field goal percentage in a game, 77.4%, en route to the 69–45 victory. In the national semifinal against Louisville, both teams shot <b>very</b> <b>poorly.</b> The two teams traded the lead several times throughout the first half, but after three minutes into the second half, Georgetown gained the lead and never relinquished it. The Hoyas used defense to maintain their lead and set the pace of the game, which they won 5046.|$|E
5000|$|Inspired by the American and French Revolutions, Mexican insurgents saw an {{opportunity}} in 1808 as the king abdicated in Madrid and Spain was overwhelmed by war and occupation. The rebellion began as an idealistic peasants' and miners' movement led by a local priest Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla who issued [...] "The Cry of Dolores" [...] on 16 September 1810; the day is celebrated as Independence Day. Shouting [...] "Independence and death to the Spaniards!" [...] they marched on the capital with a <b>very</b> large, <b>poorly</b> organized army. It was routed by the Spanish and Hidalgo was executed.|$|R
50|$|Spawning in the {{aquarium}} {{is known to}} be challenging. These fish spawn in a cave, often in a leaf, and the male guards them for 3 to 4 days before they become free swimming. The fry are well known for being <b>very</b> cannibalistic when <b>poorly</b> fed and are even more sensitive to sub par water quality than the parents.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} associated with the maintenance of existing software systems is their lack of documentation. This can make <b>very</b> large, <b>poorly</b> structured programs <b>very</b> difficult to maintain. Nearly all traditional documentation tools are either designed for use in the development stage of the software lifecycle or are report generators such as cross reference generators. The problems of lack of documentation are compounded when applied to third party software maintenance as the staffs are often initially unfamiliar with the code they are maintaining. This thesis describes these problems in detail and evaluates the feasibility of a tool to help with redocumentation based on current hypertext technology...|$|R
5|$|Nearly 4,000 {{species of}} fungi, {{including}} lichen-forming {{species have been}} recorded from Malaysia. Of the two fungal groups with {{the largest number of}} species in Malaysia, the Ascomycota and their asexual states have been surveyed in some habitats (decaying wood, marine and freshwater ecosystems, as parasites of some plants, and as agents of biodegradation), but have not been or have been only poorly surveyed in other habitats (as endobionts, in soils, on dung, as human and animal pathogens); the Basidiomycota are only partly surveyed: bracket fungi, and mushrooms and toadstools have been studied, but Malaysian rust and smut fungi remain <b>very</b> <b>poorly</b> known. Without doubt, many more fungal species in Malaysia have not yet been recorded, and it is likely that many of those, when found, will be new to science.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after his}} marriage, Carrouges {{revealed}} another {{motive for the}} union. The valuable estate of Arnou-le-Faucon, given to his rival Jacques Le Gris two years earlier, had been formerly owned by Carrouges' father-in-law and had been bought by Count Pierre for 8,000 French livres in 1377. Carrouges immediately began a lawsuit to recover the land based on an assumed prior claim to it. The case dragged on for some months until ultimately Count Pierre was forced to visit his cousin King Charles VI to officially confirm his ownership {{of the land and}} his right to give it to whomever of his followers he chose. Despite losing the case, the lawsuit reflected <b>very</b> <b>poorly</b> on Carrouges at the court in Argentan and resulted in his further estrangement from Count Pierre's circle.|$|E
5|$|The {{ecological}} {{conservation of}} seamounts is {{hurt by the}} simple lack of information available. Seamounts are <b>very</b> <b>poorly</b> studied, with only 350 of the estimated 100,000 seamounts in the world having received sampling, and fewer than 100 in depth. Much of this lack of information {{can be attributed to}} a lack of technology, and to the daunting task of reaching these underwater structures; the technology to fully explore them has only been around the last few decades. Before consistent conservation efforts can begin, the seamounts of the world must first be mapped, a task that is still in progress.|$|E
40|$|Pleural {{effusion}} {{in patients}} with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is <b>very</b> rare and <b>poorly</b> understood. We report here a 26 -year-old male patient having CML and presenting with pleural effusion as the first clinical sign. The possible mechanism of pleural effusion in CML, the cytological interpretive problem and the clinical significance of finding immature leucocytes in pleural fluid are also briefly discussed...|$|R
30|$|The {{dolomite}} pervasively {{replaces the}} grains of all facies, whereas the matrix is normally only partially affected. Pervasive {{replacement of the}} calcite by <b>very</b> fine, <b>poorly</b> ordered crystalline structures (Fig.  6 d) has been documented in numerous examples in the literature and is most often attributed to early diagenesis. In addition, some {{studies have shown that}} the dull red luminescence observed in dolomites (Fig.  6 a, b) is commonly associated with early formed dolomites (Machel and Burton 1991). The crystal shape of dolomites is regulated only by the growth kinetics. At low temperatures, crystals grow by a layer-by-layer addition of atoms (Fig.  6 e, f), resulting in faceted crystal sides (Sibley and Gregg 1987).|$|R
50|$|The {{conditions}} were very poor in this concentration camp, and many diseases were prevalent. The guards would bring around petroleum baths {{to combat the}} infestations of fleas and lice. Efforts to encourage the refugees to return to Spain were common. The concentration camps were <b>very</b> large and <b>poorly</b> run. People died of hypothermia, disease, or despair. It was common to see dead bodies piled up and left in the open in areas throughout the camp.|$|R
5|$|Webster {{herself was}} characterised as malicious, {{reckless}} and wilfully evil. Commentators saw her crime as both gruesome and scandalous. Servants {{were expected to}} be deferential; her act of extreme violence towards her employer was deeply disquieting. At the time, about 40% of the female labour force was employed as domestic servants for a very wide range of society, from the wealthiest to respectable working-class families. Servants and employers lived and worked in close proximity, and the honesty and orderliness of servants was a constant cause of concern. Servants were <b>very</b> <b>poorly</b> paid and larceny was an ever-present temptation. Had Webster succeeded in completing the deal with John Church to sell Thomas' furniture, she stood to gain the equivalent of two to three years' worth of wages.|$|E
5|$|While a few critics praised {{elements}} of its composition and execution, The Dawn of Love was <b>very</b> <b>poorly</b> received when first exhibited. Etty {{had developed a}} reputation for painting realistic figures, and his stylised Venus was thought unduly influenced by foreign artists such as Rubens {{as well as being}} overly voluptuous and unrealistically coloured, while the painting as a whole was considered tasteless and obscene. The Dawn of Love was not among the 133 paintings exhibited in the major 1849 retrospective exhibition of Etty's works, and its exhibition in Glasgow in 1899 drew complaints for its supposed obscenity. In 1889 it was bought by Sir Merton Russell-Cotes, and has remained {{in the collection of the}} Russell-Cotes Art Gallery & Museum ever since.|$|E
5|$|In {{its early}} stages, the {{depression}} moved west-northwestward between {{the islands of}} St. Vincent and St. Lucia {{under the influence of}} a strong ridge to its north. Compared to its appearance 24hours before forming, the depression exhibited improved outflow and more distinct convection, although its lower circulation remained <b>very</b> <b>poorly</b> organized. This was confirmed by a Hurricane Hunters flight into the system, which failed to report a closed circulation despite the depression's well-organized appearance on satellite imagery. At 21:00UTC on October5, they reported a strengthening circulation with flight-level winds of 74mph (119km/h), corresponding to a surface wind intensity of 60mph (95km/h). Based on these data, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Iris, situated about 155mi (250km) south of the southern coast of Puerto Rico. In post-season analysis, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) estimated that Iris had attained tropical storm status about nine hours earlier.|$|E
2500|$|The Russian {{economy was}} far too {{backward}} to sustain a major war, and conditions deteriorated rapidly, despite financial aid from Britain. [...] By late 1915 there was a severe shortage of artillery shells. The <b>very</b> large but <b>poorly</b> equipped Russian army fought tenaciously and desperately despite its poor organisation and lack of munitions. Casualties were enormous. By 1915, many soldiers {{were sent to the}} front unarmed, and told to pick up whatever weapons they could from the battlefield.|$|R
40|$|Bortezomib (Velcad) is a {{proteasome}} inhibitor {{recently developed}} and mainly {{used for the}} treatment of multiple myeloma. Bortezomib represents a novel class of drugs functioning as proteasome inhibitors. Skin complications of bortezomib treatment are <b>very</b> frequent but <b>poorly</b> characterized. We describe the case of a patient who developed erythematous and edematous plaques after treatment with bortezomib. This case illustrates one of the potential reactions associated with bortezomib administration and underlines the need to recognize and report cutaneous side effects of this new drug...|$|R
