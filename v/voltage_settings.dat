40|$|Abstract—Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) {{has been}} widely adopted in {{multicore}} SoCs for reducing dynamic power con-sumption. Despite its benefits, the use of DVS increases test time because high product quality can only be ensured by testing every core at multiple supported voltage settings; hence the repetitive application of the same or different tests at multiple <b>voltage</b> <b>settings</b> becomes necessary. In addition, testing at lower supply <b>voltage</b> <b>settings</b> increases considerably the length of each test because lower scan frequencies must be used for shifting test data using scan chains. Standard scheduling techniques fail to reduce the test time for DVS-based SoCs since they do not model testing at multiple <b>voltage</b> <b>settings.</b> In addition, they do not consider the practical aspects of tester overhead and the dependencies between core <b>voltage</b> <b>settings</b> due {{to the use of}} voltage islands. To alleviate the detrimental impact of DVS on test application time, we propose a time-division multiplexing (TDM) method and an integer linear programming-based test scheduling technique, which exploit high automatic test equipment (ATE) frequencies even when low shift frequencies must be used at low <b>voltage</b> <b>settings.</b> Experimental results on two industrial SoCs highlight the effectiveness of TDM and the associated scheduling method.

The {{turbines}} used in such farms are variable speed wind turbines, either doubly-fed induction generators or syn-chronous generators with full size converter.

Modern onshore and offshore wind farms must provide reactive power or voltage control at the point of common coupling (PCC) on demand of the system op-erators.

40|$|Power {{system voltage}} control has {{traditionally}} been the responsibility of transmission-connected reactive power resources. Accordingly, high penetration levels of distributed generation present new challenges for reactive power management. Simply stipulating voltage control operation for distributed generators will not generally deliver voltage-responsive reactive power flows at the transmission system level, due mainly to the voltage-isolating effects of tap-changing bulk supply transformers. Additionally, the resistance of distribution system conductors establishes an unhelpful interaction between active power flows and voltage magnitudes. This work uses optimal power flow techniques to explore two ways to overcome these challenges. Most innovatively, a methodology is presented to optimally select static <b>voltage</b> control <b>settings</b> for distributed generators and transformers, such that they will provide an autonomous voltage-responsive behavior without supervisory control systems. In this scheme, distributed generators are exposed to transmission voltage fluctuations as far as is feasible, by blocking the tapping of the bulk supply transformer when operating within an optimally-determined range of transmission voltages. Comparatively, an active control scheme is presented, where reactive power and tap positions are dispatched period-to-period to support the transmission system voltage. Comparing these approaches suggests the level of smart-grids investment required to effectively harness the reactive power available from distributed generation...|$|R
