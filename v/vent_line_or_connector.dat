40|$|Shielding {{calculations}} for penetrations in the SNS accelerator {{environment are}} presented based on hybrid Monte Carlo and discrete ordinates particle transport methods. This methodology relies on coupling tools that map boundary surface leakage {{information from the}} Monte Carlo calculations to boundary sources for one-, two-, and three-dimensional discrete ordinates calculations. I. BACKGROUND Evaluating bulk shielding in accelerator environments is generally an easy task compared to analyzing the radiation transport through complex shield penetrations like mazes, ventilation shafts and <b>vent</b> <b>lines,</b> <b>or</b> egresses. Although there exist a couple of simple hand calculation formula 1, 2 developed over the years from the expertise gained at accelerator facilities, these are limited to simple duct arrangements through shields. Monte Carlo transport codes, on the other hand, are able to model radiation fields in complex geometry. However, they consume significant amounts of resources, even with today’s computers, and may give solutions with poor statistics even when variance reduction methods are heavily applied.

5000|$|Lophosoria quadripinnata is a {{vascular}} plant with two alternating generations, a sporophyte and a gametophyte, multicellular and independent; with spores {{as a means}} of dispersion and survival. The gametophyte is a [...] "thallus" [...] (undifferentiated tissue), and the sporophyte is a [...] "corm" [...] (with roots, shoots, and a vascular system). Due to these characteristics it is usually classified as a [...] "pteridophyte". They have sporophytes with megaphylls or [...] "fronds" [...] (Euphyllophytina). [...] The rhizome is massive, with hairs, not growing a trunk (not arborescent), and with radial symmetry instead of horizontal; a characteristic apparently originating in the ancestor of the tree ferns. The fronds are large in size, 2-3 pinnations, with hairs on the under side of the petioles, and they are high on its abaxial part, all common characteristics of the Cyatheales order (the tree ferns clade). Also present are the pneumathodes (discrete <b>vent</b> <b>lines,</b> <b>or</b> patches, present on the rachis, petiole and rhizome, whose function is facilitating gas exchange in the dense tissue), which are characteristic of the tree fern clade.|$|R
40|$|Following the Challenger tragedy, an {{evaluation}} of the integrated main propulsion system flight data revealed a premature decay in the hydrogen external tank ullage pressure. A reconstruction of predicted ullage pressure versus time indicated an inconsistency between predicted and measured ullage pressure starting at approximately 65. 5 seconds into the flight and reaching a maximum value between 72 and 72. 9 seconds. This discrepancy could have been caused by a hydrogen gas leak or by a liquied hydrogen leak that occurred either in the pressurization system or in the external tank. The corresponding leak rates over the time interval from 65. 5 to 72. 9 seconds were estimated to range from 0. 28 kg/s (0. 62 lbm/s) + or - 41 percent to between 0. 43 and 0. 51 kg/s (0. 94 and 1. 12 lbs/s) + or - 1 percent for a gas leak and from 72. 9 kg/s (160. 5 lbs/s) + or - 41 percent to between 111. 6 and 133. 2 kg/s (245. 8 and 293. 3 lbs/s) + or - 1 percent for a liquid leak. No speculation is made to ascertain whether the leak is liquid or gas, as this cannot be determined from the analysis performed. Four structural failures in the hydrogen external tank were considered to explain the leak rates. A break in the 5 -cm (2 in) pressurization line, in the 13 -cm (5 in) <b>vent</b> <b>line,</b> <b>or</b> in the 43 -cm (17 in) feedline is not likely. A break in the 10 -cm (4 in) recirculation line with a larger structural failure occurring in the 72 to 73 -second time period, the time of the visibly identified premature pressure decay, does seem plausible and the most likely of the four modes considered. These modes are not all-inclusive and do not preclude the possibility of a leak elsewhere in the tank...|$|R

40|$|Industrial {{rupture disk}} <b>vent</b> <b>line</b> areas for {{two-phase}} flow are currently overestimated. As a consequence, the dischargeable {{mass flow rate}} is partially much higher than necessary often leading to malfunctions in downstream retention systems and increased environmental loads. For two-phase gas/liquid flow there is no standardized sizing procedure available. Hence, the homogeneous non-equilibrium model HNE-DS is transferred from sizing safety valves to a procedure for sizing rupture disk <b>vent</b> <b>lines.</b> Thermodynamic non-equilibrium effects like boiling delay are considered. The extend method is called HNE-CSE method. Characteristic numbers of rupture disk <b>vent</b> <b>lines</b> like the resistance coefficient K-g are typically measured under laboratory, subcritical conditions with incompressible fluids, i. e. liquids or gases at very low velocities. In contrast, the flow typically encountered in an industrial rupture disk <b>vent</b> <b>line</b> is a compressible gas or two-phase gas/liquid flow under critical flow conditions. The sizing of a rupture disk <b>vent</b> <b>line</b> based on characteristics for incompressible fluids is therefore a challenge.

The Dewar consists of a vacuum vessel enclosing a superinsulated tank. The space between the vacuum vessel and the liquid tank is considered a common vacuum space. In the event that the vacuum is lost, the heat transfers to the dewar and the pressure inside the dewar increases rapidly, resulting in rupture of the dewar due to excessive pressure. Therefore, an emergency <b>vent</b> <b>line</b> is required for release of helium to prevent the dewar from rupturing. The study describes a numerical model for blow-down analysis in an emergency.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{two methods}} {{to cancel the}} effect of two kinds of leakage signals which may be presented when an antenna is measured in a planar near-field range. One method tries to reduce leakage bias errors from the receiver¿s quadrature detector and {{it is based on}} estimating the bias constant added to every near-field data sample. Then, that constant is subtracted from the data, removing its undesired effect on the far-field pattern. The estimation is performed by back-propagating the field from the scan plane to the antenna under test plane (AUT) and averaging all the data located outside the AUT aperture. The second method is able to cancel the effect of the leakage from faulty transmission <b>lines,</b> <b>connectors</b> <b>or</b> rotary joints. The basis of this method is also a reconstruction process to determine the field distribution on the AUT plane. Once this distribution is known, a spatial filtering is applied to cancel the contribution due to those faulty elements.

The table also shows that the four remaining lines are roughly of the same stiffness. This follows closely {{with the experience of}} installing the U-tubes in the assembly hall. The <b>vent</b> <b>line</b> was by far the stiffest, while the other lines are comparitively more flexible. However, the value for the LAr line is misleading. It is as flexible as the other 1 1 / 2 x 3 lines. Using this as a basis, the collision hall connections should be slightly more stiff, but not appreciably. The <b>vent</b> <b>line</b> represents the only anticipated 'difficulty'. Provided that the building piping is constructed to reasonable tolerances, there should be no need to modify the existing U-tubes for use in the Collision hall. The analysis makes many assumptions which are not completely valid. For example, the inner line is much more flexible than the table indicates. Thus the analysis should not be taken as an absolute measure of the amount of force necessary to deflect the lines. The analysis does provide a means of comparison between individual lines and between the assembly hall and collision hall. The last column in tables 1 and 2 indicate which lines are the stiffest comparatively. In addition, by comparing the stiffness of each line in the collision hall with the corresponding line in the assembly hall, a qualitative assesment can be made as to whether the lines in the collision hall are flexible enough...|$|R
