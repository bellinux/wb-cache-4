25|$|However, in cities, {{where the}} {{population}} {{tends to be}} much higher, informal interactions between ethnic groups might {{not be sufficient to}} prevent violence. This is because you need many more links to connect everyone and therefore it is much more difficult to form and strengthen inter-ethnic ties. In cities, formal inter-ethnic associations like trade unions, business associations and professional organizations are more effective in encouraging inter-ethnic interactions that could prevent ethnic violence in the future. These organizations force ethnic groups to come together based on shared economic interests that overcomes any pre-existing ethnic differences. For example, inter-ethnic business organizations serve to connect the business interests of different ethnic groups which would increase their desire to maintain ethnic harmony. Any ethnic tension or outbreak of <b>violence</b> <b>will</b> go against their economic interests and therefore, over time, the salience of ethnic identity diminishes.|$|E

500|$|In Joe Macbeth (1955), {{the first}} film to {{transpose}} Macbeth into a gang and Mafia-like setting, Fleance {{is replaced by a}} character named Lenny. Lenny's father, Banky, is killed, but Lenny escapes, and gathers a group of angry mobsters to overthrow Macbeth, who has, through a series of murders, made himself the kingpin gangster in the area. Lenny is successful in killing Macbeth in the end, but only after Macbeth has murdered most of his family. In another gangster adaptation, Men of Respect (1991), Fleance is replaced by a character named Phil, who similarly helps overthrow Mike (Macbeth) after his father, Bankie (Banquo), is murdered. Phil is inducted into the gang {{at the end of the}} film, when Mal (Malcolm) has taken over, suggesting that the violent gang culture will continue through generations. This sentiment echoes into the final scenes of Penny Woolcock's Macbeth on the Estate. Macduff shoots Macbeth and takes a ring (representing his high status) off Macbeth's finger. Entering a bar, he flips it to Malcolm, saying, [...] "Hail, king." [...] Malcolm puts it on with some show and elbows his way to the front of the bar. One of the characters he elbows is Fleance (a skinhead), who makes a mock gun out of his fingers and [...] "shoots" [...] at the back of the darker-skinned Malcolm's skull. Again this makes it clear that the <b>violence</b> <b>will</b> not end with the new generation.|$|E
