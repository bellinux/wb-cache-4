50|$|For most {{commercial}} uses, yeast of {{any form}} is packaged in bulk (blocks or freezer bags for fresh yeast; <b>vacuum-packed</b> brick bags for dry or instant); however, yeast {{for home use}} is often packaged in pre-measured doses, either small squares for compressed yeast or sealed packets for dry or instant. For active dry and instant yeast, in general a single dose (reckoned for the average bread recipe of between 500 g and 1000 g of dough) is about 2.5 tsp (~12 mL) or about 7 g, though comparatively lesser amounts are used when the yeast is used in a pre-ferment. In general, a yeast flavor in the baked bread is not noticeable when the bakers' percent of added yeast is less than 2.5%.|$|E
50|$|The MicVac {{method is}} a {{pasteurization}} method {{for the food}} processing industry producing ready meals. Food ingredients are inserted into a package, which is sealed. The food is then cooked and pasteurized in the sealed package. During the heating process a valve on the package opens and releases steam and oxygen. The process time is short since the food is pasteurized with microwaves. When the microwave heating process stops the valve closes. Remaining steam condenses and causes an underpressure in the package. The final result is a cooked, pasteurized and <b>vacuum-packed</b> product. The short cooking time {{in combination with the}} absence of oxygen in the pack is unique for the method and has many advantages. The method has been used in the food industry since 2005.|$|E
50|$|Extending {{the shelf}} life of roasted coffee relies on {{maintaining}} an optimum environment {{to protect it}} from exposure to heat, oxygen, and light. Roasted coffee has an optimal typical shelf life of two weeks, and ground coffee about 15 minutes. Without some sort of preservation method, coffee becomes stale. The first large-scale preservation technique was vacuum packing in cans. However, because coffee emits CO2 after roasting, coffee to be <b>vacuum-packed</b> must be allowed to de-gas for several days before it is sealed. To allow more immediate packaging, pressurized canisters or foil-lined bags with pressure-relief valves can be used. Refrigeration and freezing retards the staling process. Roasted whole beans can be considered fresh for up to one month if kept cool. Once coffee is ground it is best used immediately.|$|E

50|$|Lucas was {{included}} in the 1988 group exhibition Freeze along with contemporaries including Angus Fairhurst, Damien Hirst, and Gary Hume. In 1990, Lucas co-organized the East Country Yard Show with Henry Bond, in which she also exhibited. Her first two solo exhibitions in 1992 were titled The Whole Joke and Penis Nailed to a Board. It was in the early 1990s when Lucas began using furniture as a substitute for the human body, usually with crude genital punning. Created for a show organised by fellow artist Georg Herold at Portikus, Au Naturel (1994) is an assemblage of objects—a mattress, a bucket, a pair of melons, oranges and a cucumber—that suggest male and female body parts. For six months in 1993, Lucas and fellow artist Tracey Emin rented a retail space in east London, The Shop, where they made artworks, ranging from printed mugs to T-shirts with slogans, and put them on sale. In works such as Bitch (table, T-shirt, melons, and <b>vacuum-packed</b> smoked fish, 1995), she merges tabloid culture with the economy of the ready-made. In earlier work, she had displayed enlarged pages from the Sunday Sport newspaper. Through her career, Lucas has continued to appropriate everyday materials (including, for example, freshly made fried eggs) to make works that use humour, visual puns and sexual metaphors of sex, death, Englishness and gender.|$|E
5000|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic {{recognized}} that she [...] "sounds impassioned and invested in these numbers, selling {{every one of}} the skyscraper hooks, but better still she sounds relatable, pulling listeners into a song instead of keeping them at a distance," [...] observing that [...] "while it's not perfect, largely due to those dreary Tedder tunes, much of All I Ever Wanted does justice to Clarkson's considerable skills." [...] Elle J Small of BBC Music declared that the album [...] "won't disappoint hardcore fans but is unlikely to garner new listeners," [...] a sentiment echoed by Vibe Claire Lobenfeld, who wrote that it [...] "will be a hit with Clarkson die-hards, but is unlikely to influence any Top 40 outsiders." [...] Evan Sawdey of PopMatters noticed that [...] "though All I Ever Wanted is not a classic pop album by any means, it’s most assuredly a fun one—flaws and all. It might be a bit quirky at times, but therein lies the charm: no one could’ve filled up such a deliberately commercial album with so much personality aside from Kelly Clarkson, and for that, we should all be a bit thankful." [...] In a more mixed review, Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone admitted that [...] "Clarkson's sense of grievance, inflated to gargantuan size by her huge voice, can be wearying over 14 songs, particularly when the music sags." [...] Michaelangelo Matos of The A.V. Club called it [...] "a likeable but ultimately hackneyed album that presents her as the über-everygirl", while Michael Cragg of musicOMH was more critical, writing that [...] "as an album, the whole thing feels precision tooled, <b>vacuum-packed</b> and strangely lifeless." [...] Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine analyzed the album in his review, declaring: [...] "Taken in isolation and out of the context of the album as a whole—say, on the radio—nearly all of these songs work well enough, despite the production choices that don't always play to Clarkson's strengths and which draw too much attention to themselves. And if all Clarkson ever wanted was a major commercial comeback, then this album should undoubtedly give it to her. But whatever her army of producers and legion of co-writers may have brought to the project in terms of radio-ready pop hooks, there's just too much tone and subtext to her performances here—and hell, even consider the record's title—that betrays Clarkson's ironic take on the whole affair." ...|$|E
40|$|Aims: To {{determine}} {{the utility of}} <b>vacuum-packed</b> polythene bags as a convenient, flexible and cost-effective alternative to fixed volume glass vessels for lab-scale silage studies. Methods and Results: Using perennial ryegrass or red clover forage, similar fermentations (as assessed by pH measurement) occurred in glass tube and <b>vacuum-packed</b> silos over a 35 -day period. As vacuum-packing devices allow modification of initial packing density, the effect of four different settings (initial packing densities of 0 Æ 397, 0 Æ 435, 0 Æ 492 and 0 Æ 534 g cm) 3) on the silage fermentation over 16 days was examined. Significant differences in pH decline and lactate accumulation were observed at different vacuum settings. Gas accumulation was apparent within all bags and changes in bag volume with time was observed to vary according to initial packing density. Conclusions: <b>Vacuum-packed</b> silos do provide a realistic model system for lab-scale silage fermentations. Significance and Impact of the Study: Use of <b>vacuum-packed</b> silos holds potential for lab-scale evaluations of silage fermentations, allowing higher throughput of samples, more consistent packing {{as well as the}} possibility of investigating the effects of different initial packing densities and use of different wrapping materials...|$|E
