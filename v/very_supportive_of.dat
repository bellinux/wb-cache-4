5|$|Since the {{favourite}} {{sport for}} the people of Calcutta was the game of football, Ganguly was initially attracted to the game. However, academics came in-between his love for sports and Nirupa was not <b>very</b> <b>supportive</b> <b>of</b> Ganguly taking up cricket or any other sport as a career. By then, his elder brother Snehasish was already an established cricketer for the Bengal cricket team. He supported Ganguly's dream to be a cricketer and asked their father to get Ganguly enrolled in a cricket coaching camp during his summer holidays. Ganguly was studying in tenth grade at that time.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally a pro-market {{economy and}} pro-EU centre-right party, the NCP were the largest {{party in the}} {{parliament}} {{for the first time}} in its history, though losing seats since the 2007 election. Although leading in the opinion polls for several years, it started to see some loss of support after the rise of the True Finns. Despite being founded as a primarily conservative party, an analysis on the party's programmes made by an NCP-affiliated think tank concluded that in the 2000s the liberal wing had gained the upper hand and had started to change the party's political ideology. At the party conference in 2010, the NCP delegates voted in favour of legalising same-sex marriage. The party's supporters are also generally <b>very</b> <b>supportive</b> <b>of</b> market economy, nuclear power and Finland's admission to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.|$|E

Rob Hayter makes a cameo appearance as Bob, Agent of Hydra, a recurring character in the comics alongside Deadpool. The rights for Bob are owned by Marvel Studios, who did not give permission {{for him to be}} used in the film, so his comic history and connections to the organization Hydra are not referenced in the film.

25|$|Fools and Worthless Liars is {{the second}} album from English band Deaf Havana and the first since the {{departure}} of founding member Ryan Mellor. The album marks {{a departure from the}} band's earlier post-hardcore style of music in favour of a song orientated power pop approach heavily influenced by bands such as Jimmy Eat World as well as the modern British wave of pop punk, largely due to the band's decision not to replace Mellor, who was a screamer.

Medusa is monarchy; She-Hulk is democracy. Medusa is the right of queens and She-Hulk is the rule of law. She-Hulk is much more balanced than Medusa. It's the two of them playing off of their strengths and sometime playing off of each other for both necessary good and necessary evil.|$|E
25|$|The {{campaign}} received varied response. A {{survey conducted}} by The Sunday Times found {{that a majority of}} the citizens were not convinced that frozen pork was as delectable as fresh pork, and opined that the difference in price was negligible. A small percentage of those interviewed were indifferent. According to the Singapore Pork Merchants' Association, about seventy percent of the pork-consuming population preferred fresh to frozen pork at the time of the campaign. The Frozen Pork Hotline was deemed a failed project, with virtually nobody calling it. On the other hand, foreign pork merchants from countries including Australia, New Zealand and the United States were <b>very</b> <b>supportive</b> <b>of</b> the campaign as it would help boost their pork sales.|$|E

25|$|Eraserhead {{was finally}} {{finished}} in 1976, {{after five years}} of production. Lynch subsequently tried to get the film entered into the Cannes Film Festival, but while some reviewers liked it, others felt that it was awful, and so it was not selected for screening. Similarly, reviewers from the New York Film Festival also rejected it, though it was screened at the Los Angeles Film Festival, where Ben Barenholtz, the distributor of the Elgin Theater, heard about it. He was <b>very</b> <b>supportive</b> <b>of</b> the movie, helping to distribute it around the United States in 1977, and Eraserhead subsequently became popular on the midnight movie underground circuit, and was later described {{as one of the most}} important midnight movies of the seventies along with El Topo, Pink Flamingos, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, The Harder They Come and Night of the Living Dead. The acclaimed film maker Stanley Kubrick said that it was one of his all-time favorite films.|$|E
25|$|Andrew Kooman is {{an author}} and playwright. All of Kooman's {{writings}} focus on justice {{and many of the}} issues he writes about are gender-based. Kooman's first literary reaction to human trafficking was to write some short stories. Eventually, he also started writing the play that became She Has a Name in order to bring attention to the issue of human trafficking, specifically in its connections to sexual exploitation. In 2009, the script of She Has a Name was given the Scripts At Work/Alberta Playwrights Network Award. By February 2012, Kooman was working on a screenplay version of She Has a Name in order to expose it to a larger audience. Some Americans expressed an interest in staging She Has a Name in the United States. After starting to write this play, Kooman read about the Ranong human-trafficking incident in a Canadian newspaper and also heard about it through a friend of his who was working at an aftercare centre in Bangkok, Thailand to restore the dignity of former sex workers. Knowing that many of the impoverished girls who are smuggled in this manner become enslaved in brothels as child prostitutes, Kooman used the incident in the backstory of the play. There was a tour of She Has a Name in 2012, and the final performances were held in Red Deer. Kooman was glad to have the tour conclude in his hometown because the people of Central Alberta were <b>very</b> <b>supportive</b> <b>of</b> the play. During the tour, Kooman was awarded the Outstanding Alumnus Provincial Award Celebrating Excellence (PACE) by the Alberta Association of Colleges & Technical Institutes (AACTI) and the Alberta Ministry of Enterprise. In conjunction with this award, a $5000 scholarship was set up in Kooman's name, which he chose to have awarded to students who evince creativity, leadership, and a commitment to those who are in need. The PACE Award ceremony is biennial, and took place on June 13 in Edmonton at the AACTI Board of Governors Conference.|$|E

500|$|The {{photograph}} {{was one of}} several taken by Leibovitz of seven-months pregnant 28-year-old Moore, then carrying the couple's second daughter, Scout LaRue. The photographs ranged from Moore in lacy underwear and spiked high heels, to a revealing peignoir. The final selection had Moore wearing only a diamond ring. [...] Joanne Gair worked on make-up for the shoot. Samuel Irving Newhouse, Jr., chairman of Conde Nast Publications, was <b>very</b> <b>supportive</b> <b>of</b> the chosen cover despite the potential for lost sales. Tina Brown, Vanity Fair editor, quickly realized that there would be harsh backlash for regular distribution of the magazine; the issue had to be wrapped in a white envelope with only Moore's eyes visible. Some editions had a brown wrapper that implied naughtiness. [...] However, Brown viewed the image as a chance to make a statement about the decade of the 1990s after a decade dominated by power suits. Approximately 100 million people saw the cover.|$|E
