2500|$|Flintshire - A {{subsidiary}} of a German company, the British Glanzstoff Manufacturing Company started an artificial silk factory in Flint in 1907. During World War I the factory closed down but {{was taken over}} by Courtaulds in 1917. In 1913, the company had started making the synthetic fibre <b>viscose</b> <b>rayon,</b> made from cellulose derived from imported wood pulp or cotton waste. Courtaulds in September 1919 bought the old Muspratt Alkali factory in Flint from United Alkali Co Ltd and called it Castle Works, where after conversion they started production in 1922 of manufactured <b>viscose</b> <b>rayon</b> yarn. Courtaulds also in December 1927 bought the Holywell Textile Mill in Flint which they called Deeside Mill and after reconstruction and alterations was used for yarn processing. At its height Courtaulds employed over 10,000 people at four sites. At Greenfield, some [...] further down the Dee estuary, two additional large rayon production facilities existed from 1936 onwards, named Number 1 and Number 2. These mills employed over 3,000 people. Textile production declined from 1950, and Aber works shut initially in 1957, opened for rayon in 1966, and pulled down in 1984. Castle works closed in 1977 and Deeside Mill in 1989. The number 1 facility at Greenfield was mothballed in 1978, and the entire site was decommissioned in the mid 1980s.|$|E
2500|$|Grimsby - The Grimsby 'Fibro' {{plant was}} built {{on the bank of the}} Humber West of Grimsby between 1952 and 1957 to produce <b>viscose</b> <b>rayon</b> staple fibre, known as Fibro. [...] In 1959 a new 'Courtelle' factory was {{constructed}} to make a proprietary acrylic fibre. [...] Both factories were substantially expanded in the 1960s and 1970s. Later the advanced form of rayon known as Tencel fibre was manufactured using a more environmentally friendly process. [...] Acrylic dope for 'Grafil' carbon fibre was also manufactured. [...] The site was sold in 1998 to Accordis UK Ltd; the Tencel plant sold to the Lenzing Group, whilst the acrylic fibre plant went through a number of administrations in the 2000s, with production ceasing 2013.|$|E

50|$|The {{durability}} and appearance retention of regular <b>viscose</b> <b>rayon</b> are low, especially when wet; also, rayon {{has the lowest}} elastic recovery of any fiber.

50|$|Devoré {{techniques}} use blended fabrics which combine protein-based fibres such as silk with cellulose-based fibres such as <b>viscose,</b> cotton, or <b>rayon.</b> In {{order to}} create the 'burnout' pattern, a chemical gel containing sodium hydrogen sulphate {{is applied to the}} fabric in patterns, dissolving away the cellulose-based fibres and leaving behind the protein-based fibres, which are not affected by the chemical. The chemical gel may be applied either by printing or by hand painting on the fabric.|$|R
5000|$|Ghost {{became known}} for its {{distinctive}} use of <b>rayon</b> (<b>viscose)</b> fabrics, which if shrunk and dyed, developed a crinkled texture similar to vintage crepe. Not only could the fabrics be made in various weights and sizes, the clinging garments made from them were easy to wear, easy to care for, and could be worn by {{women of all ages}} and shapes. Ghost became {{known for its}} strongly vintage-influenced designs, and by 2006, was a globally recognised brand name. In 1996, the department store Liberty gave Ghost more floor space than any other designer due to the popularity and saleability of the clothes. The clothes were also praised by industry insiders such as Nicola Jeal from Elle, who described them as products akin to Levi's jeans or Gap, and Grace Coddington, who described them as [...] "clothes that women like to wear." [...] Ghost clothing was designed as a range of versatile and interchangeable separates which could be worn from one year to the next without looking out of date. Although seemingly delicate, Ghost clothes were hard wearing enough to survive being screwed up in a rucksack without needing ironing, which made them very attractive to tourists and travellers.|$|R

5000|$|Petersham ribbon, {{also called}} Petersham facing or simply Petersham, is a thick, stiff, {{flexible}} corded ribbon usually {{made out of}} either cotton, <b>rayon,</b> <b>viscose,</b> or a cotton/ <b>rayon</b> or <b>viscose</b> blend of fibers and used as facing by milliners and tailors. Petersham is frequently watered {{on both sides and}} comes with a scalloped edge. It is woven so that once steamed, it will take on and support a particular curve of fabric. This makes it useful for obtaining a smooth edge on the brim of a hat, for example, without forming puckers or wrinkles which would result from the use of traditional flat ribbon or other flat fabric. [...] It is also useful as an alternative to bias tape for making fabric conform closely to the shape of the body wearing it— in a corset, for example, or along the waistline of a pair of trousers or a skirt. Petersham is very similar to grosgrain ribbon in appearance: both have closely spaced horizontal ridges, but Petersham has a flexible picot edge allowing it to be shaped with an iron, whereas grosgrain cannot be shaped this way.|$|R

50|$|In 1884 Hilaire de Chardonnet {{started the}} first {{artificial}} fiber plant based on regenerated cellulose, or <b>viscose</b> <b>rayon,</b> {{as a substitute}} for silk, but it was very flammable. In 1907 Leo Baekeland invented the first synthetic polymer, a thermosetting phenol-formaldehyde resin called Bakelite. Around the same time, Hermann Leuchs reported the synthesis of amino acid N-carboxyanhydrides and their high molecular weight products upon reaction with nucleophiles, but stopped short of referring to these as polymers, possibly due to the strong views espoused by Emil Fischer, his direct supervisor, denying the possibility of any covalent molecule exceeding 6,000 daltons. Cellophane was invented in 1908 by Jocques Brandenberger who squirted sheets of <b>viscose</b> <b>rayon</b> into an acid bath.|$|E
