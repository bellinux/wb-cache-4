5|$|Viral {{epidemiology}} is {{the branch}} of medical science that deals with the transmission and control of virus infections in humans. Transmission of viruses can be vertical, which means from mother to child, or horizontal, which means from person to person. Examples of vertical transmission include hepatitis B virus and HIV, where the baby is born already infected with the virus. Another, more rare, example is the <b>varicella</b> <b>zoster</b> <b>virus,</b> which, although causing relatively mild infections in humans, can be fatal to the foetus and newborn baby.|$|E
5|$|Viruses have {{different}} {{mechanisms by which}} they produce disease in an organism, which depends largely on the viral species. Mechanisms at the cellular level primarily include cell lysis, the breaking open and subsequent death of the cell. In multicellular organisms, if enough cells die, the whole organism will start to suffer the effects. Although viruses cause disruption of healthy homeostasis, resulting in disease, they may exist relatively harmlessly within an organism. An example would include {{the ability of the}} herpes simplex virus, which causes cold sores, to remain in a dormant state within the human body. This is called latency and is a characteristic of the herpes viruses, including Epstein–Barr virus, which causes glandular fever, and <b>varicella</b> <b>zoster</b> <b>virus,</b> which causes chickenpox and shingles. Most people have been infected with {{at least one of these}} types of herpes virus. However, these latent viruses might sometimes be beneficial, as the presence of the virus can increase immunity against bacterial pathogens, such as Yersinia pestis.|$|E

METHODS: We assessed the intrathecal antibody response to poliovirus and intrathecal production of interleukin- 2 and soluble interleukin- 2 receptors in 36 patients with the post-polio syndrome and 67 controls (including 13 who had had poliomyelitis but had no new symptoms and 18 with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} review was {{increasing}} number of opportunistic infections with use of newer immunosuppression and difficulty in diagnosis and management of such patients. For this review, MEDLINE database was searched from 2000 to 2006 with the keywords of opportunistic infections in renal transplantation. Opportunistic infection is a serious clinical complication in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy after kidney transplantation. The two major factors for successful renal transplantation are better control of rejection and better prevention and treatment of infection. In renal allograft recipient, immunosuppressive drug therapy is the major cause of immunocompromised status and occurrence of infections, which arise most commonly {{as a result of}} invasion by endogenous opportunists. The opportunistic infections with <b>varicella</b> <b>zoster</b> <b>viruses,</b> parvovirus B- 19, polyomavirus, nocardia and mucormycosis in immunosuppressed patients were present with severe complications that are reviewed in this article. As a result of use of strong immunosuppressive drugs like tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetyl (MMF) and antirejection therapy with antithymocyte globulins (ATG), these infections are now seen frequently, so they should always be included in differential diagnostic consideration. New diagnostic procedures and new treatment strategies are required to allow early detection and successful treatment of opportunistic infections in kidney transplant recipients...|$|R

25|$|The {{first time}} a patient {{experiences}} KLS, it usually occurs along with symptoms {{that are similar to}} those of the flu or encephalitis. In at least 75 percent of cases, symptoms occur after an airway infection or a fever. Viruses observed before the development of the condition include Epstein-Barr virus, <b>varicella</b> <b>zoster</b> <b>virus,</b> herpes zoster virus, Influenza A virus subtypes, and adenovirus. Several days after symptoms first occur, patients become very tired. In cases that occur after an infection, KLS usually starts within three to five days for teenagers and fewer for children. In other cases, alcohol consumption, head injury, or international travel precede symptoms. Lifestyle habits, such as stress, alcohol abuse and lack of sleep and stress, have also been proposed as possible triggers. First episodes of KLS are preceded by a clear event in about 90 percent of cases. Recurrences generally do not have clear triggers; only about 15 percent have a precipitating event.|$|E
25|$|Some {{antiviral}} drugs, such as acyclovir (ATC: J05AB01) and ganciclovir (ATC: J05AB06) as well {{as other}} nucleoside analogs make use of the substrate specificity of viral thymidine kinase, as opposed to human thymidine kinases. These drugs act as prodrugs, which in themselves are not toxic, but are converted to toxic drugs by phosphorylation by viral thymidine kinase. Cells infected with the virus therefore produce highly toxic triphosphates that lead to cell death. Human thymidine kinase, in contrast, with its more narrow specificity, is unable to phosphorylate and activate the prodrug. In this way, only cells infected by the virus are susceptible to the drug. Such drugs are effective only against viruses from the herpes group with their specific thymidine kinase. In patients treated with this type of drugs, the development of antiviral drug resistance is frequently observed. Sequencing the thymidine kinase gene in Herpes simplex virus and <b>Varicella</b> <b>zoster</b> <b>virus</b> shows the rapid genetic variability and may facilitate the diagnosis of antiviral drug resistance.|$|E

Patients with MS had significantly lower serum antibody titres than controls against many naturally occurring antigens-namely, diptheria and tetanus toxoids, adenovirus, and mumps viruses. Raised serum antibody titres were found against measles and <b>varicella</b> <b>zoster</b> <b>viruses</b> while no difference was found towards other antigens. The delayed hypersensitivity reaction and the immunological memory of patients with MS were also greatly reduced against the mumps skin test antigens. There were normal amounts of circulating T and B lymphocytes, and the phytohaemagglutinin, concanavallin A, pokeweed mitogen, and encephalitogens lymphocyte transformation was not different from that in controls. These results indicated that patients with MS have more infectious problems than normal people and that both their T and B cell systems cannot mount a fully normal immunological response to some viral and bacterial antigens, while they give an increased response to others...|$|R

40|$|The first {{reported}} case of tickborne encephalitis (TBE) in Norway occurred in 1997. From 1997 to 2003, {{from zero to}} two cases of human TBE have been diagnosed per year in Norway, {{for a total of}} eight cases. Clinical TBE cases in dogs are not reported in Norway. In Scandinavia, tickborne encephalitis (TBE) is endemic in the coastal areas along the Baltic Sea.

Since then, eight cases of human TBE have been reported, and five cases have been published in a Norwegian journal (1, 2). In a study of serum samples from dogs in Aust-Agder County, immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies to TBE virus (TBEV) were detected in 16. 4 % of the samples (3). Clinical TBE cases in dogs are not reported in Norway, but the disease is probably underdiagnosed because antibody testing is not usually done.

40|$|A {{strain of}} rhesus-monkey thyroid cells that {{maintained}} its diploid karyotype {{through at least}} 20 passages was found to support the growth of varicella-zoster (V-Z) virus. V-Z virus was serially propagated in these cultures by passage of infected cells or cell-free virus.

Human embryonic-lung fibroblast (HELF) cul-tures have been the preferred host for the propa-gation of <b>varicella</b> <b>zoster</b> (V-Z) <b>virus.</b> This sys-tem is far from satisfactory, however, {{because of the difficulty}} in obtaining cell-free infectious virus for neutralization tests or for characteriza-tion of V-Z virus [1].

To explore this possi-bility, we developed cell strains from a variety of tissues which were obtained from a rhesus fetus. It was found that V-Z virus produced cyto-pathic changes in cells derived from thyroid, thymus, and liver but not in cells derived from lung. Since serial passage of cell-free V-Z virus could be accomplished only in thyroid cultures, this system was studied in detail. The results of these studies and their implications are discussed. Materials and Methods Cell cultures. Tissues were obtained from a rhesus fetus that was near term. After mincing Received for publication October 14, 1971, and in revised form January 27, 1972...|$|R

An adult male presented with <b>varicella</b> <b>zoster</b> complicated by pneumonitis and thrombosis, leading to a below-knee amputation. Thrombosis with <b>varicella</b> <b>zoster</b> has been associated with vasculitis and free protein S deficiency. Other microthrombotic complications, such as purpura fulminans, are more common in children. Current treatment recommendations include acetaminophen (paracetamol) and lotions for symptomatic treatment. Intravenous acyclovir is recommended in the treatment of complicated <b>varicella</b> <b>zoster,</b> although it has not been shown to reduce the {{incidence of}} complications...|$|R
