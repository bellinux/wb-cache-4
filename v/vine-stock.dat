40|$|Hasan Özdemir's article, entitled, "Şarabi{dotless}n İcadi{dotless} ve Dört Vasfi{dotless}" (The Invention of Wine and Its Four Characteristics) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{interesting}} applications of Historic-Geographic Theory. In this article, Özdemir carries out a thorough piece of research on "the tales of the invention of wine" which spread different regions of the world. He also tries to find an "ur-form" of them. In these tales, Noah decided to plant a vineyard and Satan came to see him and then Satan took a peacock, a monkey, a lion and a pig, slit their throats and sprinkled the <b>vine-stock</b> with their blood. For this reason, people who drink wine begin to resemble to those animals in proportion to their amount of drinking. In other words, as long as a person drinks a wine, he/she will resemble to a peacock, a monkey, a lion, a pig, respectively. Özdemir claims that these tales are formed in The Near East and then they are transmitted to Europe. On the other hand, they can also be analyzed by using Structuralist Theory. The theory depends on some "binary oppositions" such as "syntagm/paradigm or metonymy/metaphor" and each dichotomy includes two fundamentals of language. Claude Lévi-Strauss, who is regarded as one of the foremost structuralist anthropologists, generally reduces "myths" to binary oppositions. Lévi-Strauss asserts that myths have a meaning which is supposed to be conveyed to the new generations, but, according to Strauss, the meaning is always embedded in dichotomies like "syntagm/paradigm or metonymy/metaphor" which can be inferred by using the elements of the myths. Tales of the invention of wine have also a universal binary opposition: good/bad. The dichotomy, in these tales, is reproduced as Noah/Satan. While Noah tries to make beneficial things like grape-juice or grape molasses, Satan wants to make harmful things like wine. If a scholar wants to extend these kinds of binary oppositions to the animal world which is mentioned in these tales, he/she would discover another interesting dichotomy: peacock/pig. Since the pig is close to human beings in terms of genus, people become anxious when they look like pigs, however, the peacock is not close to a human being in terms of genus; therefore people do not care about resembling to peacocks. The closeness between pig and human being makes the difference between humans and animals blurred and this creates anxiety that human beings resemble pigs when they drink too much...|$|E

Helmetsfrom the ancient Narona were found in the early 2 Oth cenlury in the present-day village of Vid, near Metković, under the local {{cemetery}} church. One of them has 4 ribs,. the other one 6, with a ridge in the middle, shaped like a letter T tumed ups ide down. The surface segments be/Ween the ribs are made of iron and, similar to other Beldenheim type helmets, covered with thin copper or silver sheels. On top of the helmet calotte there is a circlet. On the 6 -rib helmet it protrudes. All parts of the helmets are mutually connected with markedly protruding round rivets. ln the lilerature there are many texts on these helmets, however not on the contemplativeness of the applications that decorate their surfaces. lt may be proposed with great certainty that complexity of contents of the decorative nwtifs directly relates to the Old-Testament and New-Testament mystic comprehension of supernatural phenomena. On the Narona l helmet (T. l), the motifs of the Tent and the Atonement Cover, qualities of the Old Testament sacral interpreters, also include, in a contemplative way, supernatural qualities of the mystic Tree, raised {{to the level of the}} salvation theology, and of the Cross, quality of the tree of life, realising the NewTestament spiritual universality. Christ is also present in the light radiating from antlers, as well as in grains in the birds 2 ̆ 7 bills, glorifying in a particular way his death and resurrection. He will establish the Holly Spirit, as a protective relation, to give it to the Church. The miniature images at the frontal band of the Narona l helmet are of the Old-Testament spirit, depicting details from the lives of the prophets David and Eliseus, the patriarchs Jacob and Abraham, and other details of importance. The Narona 2 and Salona helmets are of the New-Testament spiritual atmosphere. The decorative motifs of vine and <b>vine-stock</b> at the Narona 2 helmet (T. 2) make re-figuration of Christ; wine makes the eucharistic blood. The fish and bird motifs applied to the Salona helmet (T. 3) make syntagm of the Word, that is. Christ who is the Lord. All that is discussed ahave reflects The Origen 2 ̆ 7 s perception of the "helmet reflecting the flash of the hope of salvation ", Translated by: D. Kečkeme...|$|E

40|$|During {{the course}} of research, the extractability of various {{phenolic}} compounds were analysed in ‘Blaufraenkisch’ berry skins and wines produced by six types of vine load. A sample of the berry skin was detached from the harvested crop and following the extraction with hydrochloric acid-methanol {{the composition of the}} extractive and the wines prepared by microvinification was analysed. During {{the course of}} the tests, the total polyphenolic-, anthocyanin-, leucoanthocyanin- and catechin content of the samples were measured by the application of the spectrophotometric method. Based on the measured data, the extraction coefficients (EC %) were calculated for each vine load, and then through the application of statistical methods, the data of three vintages were evaluated. The results revealed that extractability does not necessarily depend on the method of cultivation or the vine load. No significant differences were found pertaining to either the extractability of the total polyphenolic-, leucoanthocyanin- or catechin content. However, the extraction coefficient of the anthocyanins in crops produced by cluster selection and cane-based cultivation was significantly lower than in the cluster-selected crops of <b>vine-stocks</b> with less bud load...|$|R
5000|$|The Ka-26 {{was used}} by some Warsaw Pact armies in the light desant or {{airborne}} role, but its slow (150 km/h) cruise speed compared with the Mil-2 (220 km/h) limits its military use but its shorter length (7,75m) compared with the Mil Mi-2 (11,9m) was an advantage when operating in an urban area, also a smaller rotor (13m) than the Mil-2 (14,6m) is an advantage, it has a longer range than the Mil-2 as well. It is, however, eminently useful for cropdusting. The coaxial main rotor configuration, which makes the Ka-26 small and agile, also results in a delicate airflow pattern under the helicopter, providing a thorough yet mild distribution of chemicals onto the plants. The Ka-26 {{is often used to}} spray grape farms in Hungary, where conventional [...] "main rotor and tail rotor" [...] layout helicopters would damage or up-root the <b>vine-stocks</b> with their powerful airflow. Hungarian Kamov operators claim that coaxial rotors of the Ka-26 creates an airflow which allows pesticides to settle underneath, rather than on top of, the leaves, this means a much more effective distribution of pesticides, as most pests and parasites do not live on the top side of foliage. Additionally, the coaxial vortex system is symmetrical, allowing the distribution of the pesticide to be more uniform.|$|R
30|$|From an {{economical}} {{point of}} view, ligoncellulosic rich agricultural residues {{can be employed}} for producing useful biomolecules such as biosurfactants. There have been some reports of some forms of ligoncellulosic wastes for production of biosurfactant. (Moldes and coworkers 2001) have reported use of ligoncellulosic materials as substrates for production of lactic acid using lactobacilli strains (Bustos 2005; Moldes et al. 2001; Sreenath et al. 2001). Apart from this there are reports on production of biosurfactants by Lactobacilli on synthetic medium (Rodrigues et al. 2006 c; Velraeds et al. 1996). (Portilla-Rivera et al. 2007 a) {{were the first to}} look in to the capability of Lactobacillus sp to use hemicellulosic hydrolyzates from various agricultural residues for simultaneous production of biosurfactants and lactic acid. Such dual production strategy makes biosurfactant more economical viable in market and reduce the effects of waste burning on environment. In their efforts they achieved reduced surface tension and biosurfactant yield of 0.71 g/g of biomass, when hemicellulosic hydrolyzates form trimming vine shoots was used (Portilla-Rivera et al. 2007 a). This study is important considering the large amount of pruning wastes of <b>vine-stocks</b> generated worldwide and the resulting constitutive monomeric sugar solutions, which are potential renewable sources for the other biomolecules like lactic acid. They concluded that hemicellulosic sugars from the agricultural residues are interesting substrates for the competitive cost production of biosurfactants.|$|R

Nodal segments from greenhouse growing <b>vine-stocks</b> were used as explants. Different medium compositions were tested and the explants could be initiated on MS and MS ½ media supplemented with 1. 1 mg L- 1 BA. Subsequent cultures were carried out by growing the shoots on MS with 1. 1 or 0. 55 mg L- 1 BA; BA was shown to affect positively the shoot length when applied at the lowest concentration tested. MS media, supplemented with 0. 5 or 1. 0 mg L- 1 IBA, with and without activated charcoal (AC), were used for adventitious root induction. Shoots of 'Lambrusco salamino', 'Malbo gentile' and 'Trebbiano modenese' rooted in all conditions with some qualitative differences. Rooting appeared to be greatly stimulated by 1 mg L- 1 IBA plus AC in 'Lambrusco Marani', and without AC in 'Ancellotta'. In 'Lambrusco di Sorbara', a cultivar recalcitrant to rooting, we managed to stimulate the root formation on MS ½ supplemented with 1 mg L- 1 IBA and deprived of AC. Genetic stability, evaluated at the third subculture, and analyses of nine microsatellite loci showed an unvaried genetic profile between micropropagated shoots and adult trees from which explants were taken...|$|R
