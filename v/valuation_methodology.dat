25|$|Since {{hedge funds}} are private {{entities}} and have few public disclosure requirements, this is sometimes {{perceived as a}} lack of transparency. Another common perception of hedge funds is that their managers are not subject to as much regulatory oversight and/or registration requirements as other financial investment managers, and more prone to manager-specific idiosyncratic risks such as style drifts, faulty operations, or fraud. New regulations introduced in the US and the EU as of 2010 require hedge fund managers to report more information, leading to greater transparency. In addition, investors, particularly institutional investors, are encouraging further developments in hedge fund risk management, both through internal practices and external regulatory requirements. The increasing influence of institutional investors has led to greater transparency: hedge funds increasingly provide information to investors including <b>valuation</b> <b>methodology,</b> positions and leverage exposure.|$|E

40|$|The {{goal of this}} Thesis is to {{evaluate}} Vestas Wind Systems A. For this purpose, the current <b>valuation</b> <b>methodologies</b> were discussed. The conclusion was to use three <b>valuation</b> <b>methodologies.</b> Firstly, the Discounted Cash Flow methodology was performed due to its acceptability both among researchers and professionals. Three scenarios were created {{to account for the}} uncertainty tied with the cyclicality of the business, and probabilities were assigned based on the economical reasonability of each. A final price of kr. 300, 51 was reached, implying that the firm is undervalued (market prices kr. 250). Secondly the Economic Value Added approach was conducted, providing insight on the periods in which the company is able to generate economic profit. The three scenarios were also used. The final price of kr. 356, 62 was reached yielding a buy opportunity. Thirdly the multiples valuation was performed in order to better understand the industry and the company’s peers. A forward looking enterprise value to EBIT multiple was used and a final price of kr. 302, 01, also implying that the company is undervalued. In addition a Value at Risk analysis was performed to access the risk of our recommendation. Finally our valuation target price (from 300 to 360) was compared with the valuation from Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, and reached the conclusion that although results are similar, methods and business assumptions differs...|$|R
