50|$|Land {{was subject}} to feudal tenure and could be held in allod or fief, the latter coming in two {{distinct}} forms—either free socage (seigneurie) or <b>villein</b> <b>socage</b> (roture). Free socage was considered 'noble' (but the owner {{did not have to}} be a member of the nobility) and the latter 'peasant'.|$|E
50|$|Under feudal tenure, a fief {{could not}} be owned {{outright}} but was instead divided into competing interests known as estates in land; thus, a single tract of land could be held both in <b>villein</b> <b>socage</b> by a tenant and in free socage by {{the lord of the}} manor. <b>Villein</b> <b>socage</b> was subject to a number of real burdens and feudal incidents owed to the manorial landlord. For example, the Custom provided for the payment of an annual feu-duty (the cens) by villein socagers to the landlord as both revenue and as a token of submission. The entry fine (lods et ventes) was another mandatory payment, a conveyance fee for villein socages and amounting to a twelfth of the sales price, and derived from the feu-duty, as were other fees and the right of laudatio (retrait lignager).|$|E
50|$|The {{other half}} would be split evenly among the {{surviving}} children. Children {{were entitled to}} a legitime, whether they were male or female, and could access their inheritances at 25, the legal age of majority. They could not be disinherited. Estates in free socage (seigneuries) were subject to different rules of inheritance, and estates in <b>villein</b> <b>socage</b> had to be partitioned equally. A free socage was inherited unequally with half going to the eldest son and the rest being divided equally among his siblings.|$|E
50|$|Estates in {{free socage}} {{were the most}} macro-level of land {{division}} in New France but, within them, there existed several tenurial subdivisions. Immediately {{below the level of}} free socage was that of the villeinage (roture). Throughout New France, there came to exist several thousand estates in villeinage. Furthermore, these villein tenancies were remarkably uniform in terms of size. Barring extreme cases, it is estimated that around 95% of all villein estates were between 40 and 200 square arpents, or (7,680' ft and 38,400' ft) in size, though most were likely 120 arpents or less. Estates of less than 40 square arpents were considered to be of little value by villein socagers.To maximize simplicity when surveying, estates in <b>villein</b> <b>socage</b> were almost invariably distributed in rectangular plots following a rowed system wherein the first row bordered the river, and was the first to be filled, followed by the second behind it and so on. Typically, the proportions of such rectangles coincided with the ratio of 1:10 for width and length, respectively. However, extremes {{all the way up to}} 1:100 are known to have occurred. This method of land division confers obvious advantages in terms of easy access to transportation and cheap surveying, but also allowed socagers to live remarkably close to families on neighboring plots—often within a few hundred yards—creating something of a proto-neighborhood.|$|E
