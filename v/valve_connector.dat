(Leuven, BE) Objectives: To {{determine whether the}} introduction of a needleless positive-pressure mechanical <b>valve</b> <b>connector</b> in adult and paediatric hematology-oncology units influenced the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections (BSI) and the type of causative micro-organisms. Methods: A mechanical valve (MV) connector system (CLC 2000 ®, ICU Medical) was introduced in November 2005 and replaced miscellaneous conventional open systems (COS) with a standard Luer-Lock removable cap. The main objective of this change was to reduce the use of heparin flushes in long-term tunnelled catheters (Hickman®, CR Bard). The retrospective analysis included all patients with new Hickman catheters, inserted during two different study periods. The catheter-related BSI rate was observed during 6 months for each system and reported as number of BSI per 1000 catheter days. The results with COS (January through June 2005) were compared with a similar period with MV-use (September 2006 through February 2007). Microbiological characteristics of bacteraemias occurring during each period were also compared. The hospital policy for care of Hickman catheters did not change over both study periods. Results: During the COS-period, 39 Hickman catheters were inserted in 15 children and 24 adults with a total dwell time of 1544 and 1899 catheter days respectively. During the MV-period 60 Hickman catheters were placed in 13 children and 47 adults with a total dwell time of 1181 and 3223 catheter days respectively. Both in the paediatric and adult population, the rate of catheter-related BSI during the MV period was significantly higher than during the COS-period: resp. 11 vs 1. 29 infections per 1000 catheter days (p =. 009) and 12. 4 vs 6. 32 infections per 1000 catheter days (p = 0. 019). During the MV-period, the percentage of polymicrobial BSIs increased from 0 to 84. 6 % in children and from 8. 3 % to 21 % in adult patients. Conclusion: A significant increase in the rate of BSI was found among hematology and oncology patients with newly inserted Hickman catheters concomitantly with a change from a conventional open system to a mechanical <b>valve</b> <b>connector,</b> despite additional educational sessions regarding proper use of the device. The risk and type of BSI are clearly associated with the catheter cap design which promotes microbial contamination. The observed effects are more pronounced in childrenstatus: publishe...|$|E

As CO is excreted solely by the lung, a simple technique {{for measuring the}} end tidal {{carbon monoxide}} (ETCO) level was assessed as a method for screening for haemolytic disease in children. Methods: Two end expiratory breath samples were collected from normal children and from children with haemolytic disease using a one way <b>valve</b> <b>connector</b> between a mouth piece and an anaesthetic bag. The samples were analysed by gas chromatography for CO and carbon for dioxide (CO 2). The CO 2 value was used to normalise the CO value to an alveolar concentration. Carboxyhaemoglobin (HbCO) also was measured in the patient group for correlation analysis with ETCO. Results: A total of 21 children with β thalassaemia major, 15 children with other haemolytic diseases (hereditary spherocytosis n= 8, haemoglobin H disease n= 3 and thalassaemia intermedia n= 4) and 23 normal children were studied. The mean ETCO concentrations in the three groups were 3. 21 p. p. m., 7. 41 p. p. m. and 0. 69 p. p. m., respectively, which were significantly {{different from each other}} (P< 0. 0001). There was a significant correlation between ETCO and HbCO in the patient groups (r= 0. 85; P < 0. 0001).

A typical case is of biomaterials made of NiTi, in which the main drawback is the Ni out-diffusion, an issue that has been satisfactorily addressed by plasma based ion implantation (PBII). Even though PBII can tailor selective surface properties of diverse materials, usually, only thin modified layers are attained. When NiTi alloys are to be used in the harsh space environment, as is the case of devices designed to remotely release the solar panels and antenna arrays of satellites, e. g., superior mechanical and tribological properties are demanded. For this case the thickness of the modified layer must be larger than the one commonly achieved by conventional PBII.

30|$|Many needleless {{intravascular}} <b>connector</b> <b>valves</b> {{have been}} introduced into clinical practice {{to minimize the risk}} of needlestick injury. After disinfection of the connections, microbial contamination of these systems is lower compared with three-way stopcocks with caps [47]. However, in cohort studies, needleless systems often were still contaminated after the widely used procedure of alcoholic disinfection for 3 - 5 sec, which is clearly inadequate. Moreover, most needleless systems are opaque, making it impossible to verify that they were properly flushed. These points explain why needleless systems have been repeatedly associated with BSI outbreaks [48 – 50].

40|$|One of the {{challenges}} with thermal insulation design in subsea equipment is to minimize the heat loss through cold spots during production shut down. Cold spots are system components where insulation is difficult to implement, resulting in an insulation discontinuity which creates by nature a thermal bridge. It is difficult to avoid cold spots or thermal bridges in items like sensors, <b>valves,</b> <b>connectors</b> and supporting structures. These areas of reduced or no insulation {{are referred to as}} cold spots. Heat is drained faster through these spots, resulting in an increased local fluid density resulting in an internal fluid flow due to gravity and accelerated cooldown. This natural convection flow is important for both heat loss and internal distribution of the temperature. This thesis is presenting both experimental work and modelling work. A series of cool down tests and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of these tests are presented. These tests and simulations were carried out {{in order to understand the}} flow physics involved in heat exchange processes caused by free convection flow in pipe exposed to cooling. Inclination of the pipe relative to the direction of gravity and temperature difference between cooling water and internal pipe water are the two main parameters investigated in this study. The experimental heat removal and temperature field is discussed and further interpreted by means of computational fluid dynamics. For prediction of the evolvement of the local temperature and heat flow, selection of an appropriate turbulence model is critical. Hence, different models and wall functions are investigated. The predicted temperature profiles and heat extraction rates are compared to the experiments for the selected turbulence models. Our main conclusions, supported by our experimental and CFD results, include: (i) Heat transfer from a localized cold spot in an inclined pipe is most efficient when the pipe orientation is close to horizontal. As the pipe becomes more and more inclined the heat transfer (heat extraction) is reduced and the flow becomes more unstable. The results indicate that heat transfer from cold surfaces, where surface normal vector being normal to the gravity vector or surface normal vector facing down, is very efficient, and if possible, both should be avoided in order to minimize local formation of wax or hydrates (crystals) which may take place and could create flow blockage during start-up. (ii) The flow in the selected geometry is complex. In the present work, large eddy simulation (LES) and RANS (Standard k __) turbulence model are compared to our measurements. Consistent with experimental observation, strong unsteadiness was clearly observed in the results of both models; however, the LES model achieved significantly better agreement with temperature and heat transfer measurements than the k __ turbulence model. Based on the results obtained in this work, further application of LES to flows of industrial complexity is recommended. (iii) On the cold spot, developing boundary layers are not in equilibrium with the outer flow, making it difficult to use wall functions.

40|$|Background/Purpose The use of needleless {{positive}} pressure <b>connector</b> <b>valves</b> (PPVs) on venous access devices (VADs) {{has been}} shown to have possible benefits in decreasing VAD occlusion rates. Catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) rates, however, have been variable. With this potential for improving patient outcomes, decreasing costs, and facilitating nursing care and catheter management, the use of PPV devices becomes both advantageous and desirable. Methodology This was a randomized, prospective, parallel clinical study of 160 medical and surgical step-down unit patients requiring parenteral therapies. Patients were equally randomized to two study groups to assess the impact on occlusion and CRBSI rates, using a PPV versus a standard cap without PPV. VADs included both peripherally inserted catheters (PICCs) and midlines. Results Seven VAD occlusions occurred; six in the experimental group, one in the control group (p = 0. 43). Also, two CRBSIs occurred in the experimental group, with none in the control group (p = 0. 497). All incidents occurred in doublelumen PICCs. The lack of statistical {{difference between the two groups}} for occlusions and CRBSIs indicates that the use of PPVs had no impact in preventing such outcomes. However, it was observed that the number of double-lumen PICCs and their dwelling time in the experimental group was significantly higher (p = 0. 003). Conclusion There was no difference in the rate of catheter occlusions or CRBSIs when using PPVs or standard caps. We consider that the study outcomes may be due to the study's small sample size, and we speculate that longer dwell time of double lumen catheters may have contributed to these outcomes. These observations deserve further investigation. However, the use of PPVs may still be advantageous from a nursing process perspective. The use of peripherally inserted venous access devices (VADs) such as midlines and peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) for intravenous infusions has become common practice in the hospital, as well as in the home-care setting. The main advantages of using these types of VADs include the ease of insertion, cost reduction, and lower complication rates. However, occlusion and infectious complications are not uncommon. Historically, clinicians have used a variety of techniques to prevent VAD occlusion. These include vigorous flushing, coordinated flushing and clamping, and pulsatile flow technique. Despite these methods, it has been estimated that 25 % of central VADs become occluded. This leads to interruptions and delays in therapy administration and to the need for VAD replacement, associated with increased risk of complications to the patient and increased costs (Stephens, Haire, & Kotulak, 1995; Hoch, 1997). Therefore, prevention of VAD occlusion is essential. Needleless positive pressure <b>connector</b> <b>valves</b> (PPVs) prevent the reflux of blood into the VAD lumen by activating an antegrade flow of fluid through the VAD as the flush syringe is disconnected from the device. These types of devices have been shown to significantly decrease VAD occlusion rates by 8. 2 %, when compared to a standard connector device (Jacobs et al., 2004). However, there have been reports that PPVs increase the risk of catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) (Rupp et al., 2007; Maragakis et al., 2006). One theory behind the increase in CRBSI rates is the possible design flaws in the PPV cap, causing microorganisms to collect in ridges and making it difficult to adequately disinfect the top of the cap prior to its use. Since these reports were published, the technology of PPVs has improved, to promote adequate cleansing prior to use. Potential benefits of using PPVs on VADs include decreased VAD-related complications, improved patient outcomes, and cost savings. Additionally, significant cost savings with PPV use were reportedly attributed to decreased use of thrombolytics to maintain VAD patency (Rummel, Donnelly, & Fortenbaugh, 2001). The purpose of this study was to determine if the use of one of the newer generation PPVs on VADs would prevent or reduce the incidence of VAD occlusion or increase the rate of CRBSI.

40|$|For self-reconfiguring modular robots the {{function}} to autonomously form and break connections between neighboring modules is a defining trait. Connectors must be strong, reversible, transmit power and signal, consume little power, {{and should be}} small and light enough for several to fit into each robot module. To make the modular robot system as versatile as possible, the connector should also be genderless, rotation agnostic, and tolerant to misalignment and positioning errors. Traditionally, connectors add significant mechanical complexity to each module. This thesis introduces two hardware components that implement {{different aspects of the}} modular robot connection process in small lightweight packages that contain no moving parts: The thermorheological valve is a device for directing fluid flow in order to selectively attract robot modules in a stochastic fluidic self-assembly system. Suitable thermorheological fluids are identified, the mechanical and thermal design of the valve is optimized, and demonstrations of mesoscale thermorheological valves are presented. The soldering connector is a connection mechanism for modular self-reconfiguring robots that forms solder joints by heating a low melting point alloy. The connector is mechanically strong, reversible, electrically conductive, only requires power when connecting and disconnecting, and supports ten to hundreds of connection cycles. Compared to other connection methods for modular robots the soldering connector, which is contained on a single printed circuit board, is very low in complexity, weight, size, and cost. Several designs of the connector are presented and evaluated and general guide- lines for application specific connector designs are provided. The thermorheological <b>valve</b> and soldering <b>connector</b> are then applied in the design of two modular robotic systems. The first proposed application is a fluidic self-assembly system of one-inch-sized, cube shaped modules that rely on stochastic external actuation to form predefined target shapes. Module prototypes and proof-of-concept experiments for this system are presented. A second application implements a system of 40 cube shaped modules that uses the self-soldering connector for self-reconfiguration. Several demonstrations of interactions that mimic the flow of matter through an ecosystem are shown in experiments and simulation, including growth and self-refinement. 2019 - 05 - 2...|$|R
