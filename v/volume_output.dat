Users report that in the sixth-generation iPod, the maximum <b>volume</b> <b>output</b> level is limited to 100dB in EU markets. Apple previously had to remove iPods from shelves in France for exceeding this legal limit. However, users who have bought a new sixth-generation iPod in late 2013 have reported a new option {{that allowed them to}} disable the EU volume limit. It has been said that these new iPods came with an updated software that allowed this change. Older sixth-generation iPods, however, are unable to update to this software version.|$|E
