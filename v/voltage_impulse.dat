50|$|Conceptually, a {{quasi-peak}} detector for EMC testing {{works like a}} peak detector followed by a lossy integrator.A <b>voltage</b> <b>impulse</b> entering a narrow-band receiver produces a short-duration burst oscillating at the receiver center frequency. The peak detector is a rectifier followed by a low-pass filter to extract a baseband signal consisting of the slowly (relative to the receiver center frequency) time-varying amplitude of the impulsive oscillation. The following lossy integrator has a rapid rise time and longer fall time, so the measured output for a sequence of impulses is higher when the pulse repetition rate is higher. The {{quasi-peak detector}} is calibrated to produce the same output level as a peak-power detector when the input is a continuous wave tone.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{compares the}} swept {{frequency}} (SFM) and low <b>voltage</b> <b>impulse</b> methods (LVI) for making frequency response analysis measurements. The principles of these measurements are explained. Practical {{examples of the}} application to a 30 MVA transformer with simulated mechanical and electrical faults are presented. For mechanical faults neither method is very successful, but this probably because the simulated fault was not severe enough. For electrical faults the swept frequency method gives better results {{because it has a}} finer resolution at low frequencies. In a final comparison of the two methods the swept frequency method is found to be superior in most respects, but the low <b>voltage</b> <b>impulse</b> method is found to have some important advantages. 1...|$|E

40|$|Partial {{discharge}} (PD) {{measurement and}} its pattern recognition {{are vital to}} fault diagnosis of transformers, especially to those traction substation transformers undergoing repetitive traction load shocks. This paper presents the primary factors induced by traction load shocks including high total harmonics distortion (THD), transient <b>voltage</b> <b>impulse</b> and high-temperature rise, and their effects on the feature parameters of PD. Experimental tests are conducted on six artificial PD models with these factors introduced one by one. Results reveal that the maximum PD quantity and the PD repetitive rate are favorable to be enlarged when the oil temperature exceeds 80 °C or the THD is higher than 16 % with certain orders of harmonic. The decline in PD inception voltage can mainly {{be attributed to the}} transient <b>voltage</b> <b>impulse.</b> The variation in central frequency of the fast Fourier transformation (FFT) spectra transformed from ultra-high frequency signals can mainly be attributed to high THD, especially when it exceeds 20 %. The temperature rise has no significant influence on the FFT spectra; the transient <b>voltage</b> <b>impulse,</b> however, can result in a central frequency shift of the floating particle discharge. With the rapid development of high-speed railways, the study presented in this paper will be helpful for field PD detection and recognition of traction substation transformers in the future...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{preliminary results}} of {{an investigation into the}} detection of partial discharges on the rise of impulse voltages from a point-to-plane gap in SF 6. A parallel RC detection impedance is placed in the earth path of a point. Computer simulations are done to determine the values of R and C that will result in the smallest impulse voltage signal and the largest discharge signal across the detection impedance. These simulations and the experimental work show that the impulse voltage signal can not be sufficiently attenuated during the rise time of the applied <b>voltage</b> <b>impulse</b> using the RC detection impedance alone. An alternative discharge detection method is proposed in which a resonant partial discharge coupler is used. Elimination of noise and the impulse voltage signal can be achieved by shorting the coupler plate to the ground plane {{in the middle of the}} disk. However, due to the bandwidth of the measuring equipment and noise from the impulse generator it was not possible to detect discharges on the rising edge of a 1. 5 s <b>voltage</b> <b>impulse</b> using a coupler shorted in the middle. It was found that for this particular coupler, with no shorting points, and if the rising edge of the <b>voltage</b> <b>impulse</b> is longer than 5 us, ( 10 us) PD activity can be detected on the rising edge...|$|E
