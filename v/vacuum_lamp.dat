40|$|Stern-Gerlach {{experiment}} by {{free electron}} {{is very important}} experiment because it answered some questions that remain unanswered for almost a century.

40|$|Methods are {{described}} {{for measuring the}} light emitted by an emulsion of luminous bacteria of given thickness, and calculating the light emitted by a single bacterium, measuring 1. 1 x 2. 2 micra, provided there is no absorption {{of light in the}} emulsion. At the same time, the oxygen consumed by a single bacterium was measured by recording the time for the bacteria to use up. 9 of the oxygen dissolved in sea water from air (20 per cent oxygen). The luminescence intensity does not diminish until the oxygen concentration falls below 2 per cent, when the luminescence diminishes rapidly. Above 2 per cent oxygen (when the oxygen dissolving in sea water from pure oxygen at 760 mm. Hg pressure = 100 per cent) the bacteria use equal amounts of oxygen in equal times, while below 2 per cent oxygen it seems very likely that rate of oxygen absorption is proportional to oxygen concentration. By measuring the time for a tube of luminous bacteria of known concentration saturated with air (20 per cent oxygen) to begin to darken (2 per cent oxygen) we can calculate the oxygen absorbed by one bacterium per second. The bacteria per cc. are counted on a blood counting slide or by a centrifugal method, after measuring the volume of a single bacterium (1. 695 x 10 – 12 cc.). Both methods gave results in good agreement with each other. The maximum value for the light from a single bacterium was 24 x 10 – 14 lumens or 1. 9 x 10 – 14 candles. The maximum value for lumen-seconds per mg. of oxygen absorbed was 14. The average value for lumen-seconds per mg. O 2 was 9. 25. The maximum values were selected in calculating the efficiency of light production, since some of the bacteria counted may not be producing light, although they may still be using oxygen. The "diet" of the bacteria was 60 per cent glycerol and 40 per cent peptone. To oxidize this mixture each mg. of oxygen would yield 3. 38 gm. calories or 14. 1 watts per second. 1 lumen per watt is therefore produced by a normal bacterium which emits 14 lumen-seconds per mg. O 2 absorbed. Since the maximum lumens per watt are 640, representing 100 per cent efficiency, the total luminous efficiency if. 00156. As some of the oxygen is used in respiratory oxidation which may {{have nothing to do with}} luminescence, the luminescence efficiency must be higher than 1 lumen per watt. Experiments with KCN show that this substance may reduce the oxygen consumption to 1 / 20 of its former value while reducing the luminescence intensity only ¼. A partial separation of respiratory from luminescence oxidations is therefore effected by KCN, and our efficiency becomes 5 lumens per watt, or. 0078. This is an over-all efficiency, based on the energy value of the "fuel" of the bacteria, regarded as a power plant for producing light. It compares very favorably with the 1. 6 lumens per watt of a tungsten <b>vacuum</b> <b>lamp</b> or the 3. 9 lumens per watt of a tungsten nitrogen lamp, if we correct the usual values for these illuminants, based on watts at the lamp terminals, for a 20 per cent efficiency of the power plant converting the energy of coal fuel into electric current. The specific luminous emission of the bacteria is 3. 14 x 10 – 6 lumens per cm 2. One bacterium absorbs 215, 000 molecules of oxygen per second and emits 1, 280 quanta of light at λmax = 510 µµ. If we suppose that a molecule of oxygen uniting with luminous material gives rise to the emission of 1 quantum of light energy, only 1 / 168 of the oxygen absorbed is used in luminescence. On this basis the efficiency becomes 168 lumens per watt or 26. 2 per cent...|$|E

The obtained results show that a flow of pho-toproducts into the gas phase is considerably lower than pre-sumed in the recent study by Murray and Plane (2005). The experiments indicate that almost all photoproducts remain in the solid phase, and the principal chemical reaction between them is the recombination reaction H + OH→H 2 O which is evidently very fast.

Cıva içeren floresan lambalar ve cıva içermeyen lambalar (akkor lambalar) olmak üzere iki çeşit lamba vardır. Floresan lambalar akkor lambalar ile kıyaslanırsa; Verimliliği 3 - 6 kat daha fazladır. Lamba Ömrü 4 - 15 kat daha fazladır ve enerji tüketimi 80 daha azdır. Bir floresan lamba temel olarak içi fosfor tozları ile kaplanmış cam bir tüpten oluşur. Fosfor tozları % 1 - 2 antimon ve mangan içeren kalsiyum halofosfat “[Ca 5 (F,Cl) (PO 4) 3 :Sb, Mn] karışımından oluşur. Bu küçük bileşenlerin miktarı değişebilir, bu da lambanın rengini etkiler. Cam tüp; düşük basınçta (0, 003 atm) argon, neon, kripton veya ksenon gibi inert bir gazla ve düşük basınçta cıva buharı ile doldurulur. Tungsten veya paslanmaz çelikten yapılan katot, lambaların ucunda bulunur. Floresan lambanın içindeki cıva buharı tek başına görünür bölgede ışık üretemediği için; cıva fosfor tozlara çarparak görünür bölgede ışıma yapmayı sağlar. Bu tozun türü; lambanın verimini, rengini, renksel geri verimini etkiler. Tozun saflığı ve kristal boyutu da oldukça önemlidir. Floresan lambalar içinde bulunan yüksek miktarda cıva yüzünden önemli derecede çevresel sorunlara sebep olmaktadır. Çünkü; cıva toksik bir metaldir. Cıva doldurulmuş lambalar kırıldığında; cıva; suya, toprağa, bitkilere ve hayvanlara bulaşır. Senelerce floresan lambaların kullanımından doğan bu sorundan dolayı lambaları uygun bir şekilde bertaraf etme yolları aranmaktadır ve kısıtlama getirilmiştir. Avrupa Topluluğu’nun floresan lambalarda cıva miktarı için koyduğu limit lamba başına 5 mg’dır. Bu çalışmada; çeşitli markaların kullanılmış ve kullanılmamış floresan lambalarında cıva miktarının kriterlere uyup uymadığına bakılmıştır. Kriterlere uygun olduğu saptanmıştır. Kullanılmış ve kullanılmamış floresan lambalarda hidrür oluşturmalı atomik absorpsiyon spektrofotometresi ile cıva tayini yapılmıştır. Bu sistem ile cıva gibi ağır metallerin eser miktarda analizi yapılabilmektir. Hidrür oluşturma tekniğinin iki önemli avantajı vardır; Tayin elementi numune ortamından ayrılır. Bu da olası girişimleri azaltır. Gözlenebilme sınırı, &# 956;g/L veya daha düşük düzeylere getirilmiştir. Çünkü 1 - 50 mL numunedeki tayin elementinin tamamı birkaç saniyede atomlaştırıcıya gaz olarak gönderilir. It is {{well known}} that mercury {{is one of the most}} toxic heavy metals in the environment. Different forms of mercury can be accumulatedin animals and plants. Mercury can damage central nevre by {{entering}} into human body. Mercury is a global pollutant which requires a great attention due to its bioaccumulation properties and reactivity. It is highly toxic even in low concentrations and its dispersion in the environment is due to natural emissions or anthropogenic activities. The main indirect source of human contamination of Hg is through the consumption of fish products (fish, crustaceans). The presence of Hg in fish, thermometers, dental amalgams, vaccine preservatives, electrical substances and in the atmosphere has made this particular toxic metal an increasing focus of health authorities and interest groups. Several mercury diseases have occured up to now. The most important disease is Minamata Disease. The National Institute for Minamata Disease was established in 1978 to carry out medical studies on Minamata Disease. The institute s Department of Clinical Medicine engages in clinical research to study Minamata Disease and treatments, carrying out medical examinations as necessary. The purpose of this research is to find the determinant properties of mercury compounds in given organisms, the flux of the compounds in organisms leading subsequently to their movement in the environment and chemical repercussions in an organic mechanism (in particular, the characteristics of damage caused by organic mercury and potential detoxification mechanisms). The Department of Epidemiology investigates and researches into Minamata Disease from an epidemiological perspective. The work done at the institute since its establishment is highly regarded by the scientific world and in 1986, the institute was designated as a WHO Collaborating Centre. A large part of the electrical energy consumed in public, commercial, residential, and service sectors is utilized in lighting. There are two main types of lamps – those that contain mercury (fluorescent lamps with mercury vapor, mercury–sodium vapor, and with other mixed metallic vapors) and those without mercury (incandescent lamps and halogen/dichroiclamps). Compared to incandescent lamps, the luminous efficiency of mercury-containing lamps is three to six fold as high, life time is from 4 to 15 times as long, and energy consumption is 80 % smaller. A fluorescent lamp is basically constituted of a glass tube internally coated with phosphorescent powders composed of “calciumhalophosphate with 1 – 2 % antimony and manganese “[Ca 5 (F,Cl) (PO 4) 3 :Sb, Mn]”. The quantity of the seminor components may change slightly, depending on the color of the lamp. An alumina pre-coating may be found between the glass tube and the luminescent powder. The tube is filled with an inert gas (argon, neon, krypton, and/or xenon) at low pressure (0. 003 atm) and mercury vapor at low partial pressure. Cathodes made of either tungsten or stainless steel are assembled on theends of thelamps. The tube is under partial <b>vacuum.</b> Fluorescent <b>lamps</b> rely on mercury as the source of ultraviolet radiation for the production of visible light. Fluorescent lamps raise important environmental concerns because of their high content of mercury. When the lamps are discarded, mercury may contaminate soil, plants, animals, and water. Fluorescent lamps’s extensive use over the years has caused growing concerns over their proper disposal. Therefore; the limit allowed by the European Community that is 5 mg per compact fluorescent lamp. Antimony, arsenic, bismuth, germanium, selenium, tellerium and tin, are forming gaseous hydrides in acid solution upon the additon of NaBH 4. These hydrides can be purged from solution using an inert gas (usually argon) and transported to a heated quartz tube, where they are atomized. The tube may be heated electrically or by a flame. The advantage of the electrical heating is the lower running cost and the better temperature control. The relatively simple hydride generation technique makes possible detection limits that are comparable to or better than those of GF AAS. The atomization of hydrides at temperatures of 800 0 C- 1000 0 C is a complex procedure that involves hydrogen radicals, which will not be discussed in detail here. Spectral interferences are very unlikely with this technique as only a few elements are volatilized under the conditions used here. Gas phase interferences are unlikely as well, except when other hydride-forming elements are present in the sample at high concentration. The only interference that can cause major problems is the hindrance of hydride generation and liberation from solution caused by some transition metals. Among the analytical techniques used for the determination of Hg, cold vapor atomic absorption spectrometry (CV-AAS) is widely applied since it is a low cost technique. Mercury is reduced to the metal under the conditions used for hydride generation and can be purged directly with an inert gas from solution as atomic vapor and measured in an unhealted absorption cell by AAS. This technique results in the best detection limits for mercury. There are two system at this tecnique: Batch and Flow system. The great advantage of flow systems is the easy automation. The addition of the solution for measurement, the transport of reagents and the separation of the gaseous hydride can all be managed automatically. It is characteristic for flow systems that sensitivity increases with decreasing flow rate. In this study; spent and new fluorescent lamp different marks was characterized to determine the distribution of mercury. It was determined optimum conditions such as shaking time, variety of solubility (microwave or normal beater). Concentrations of mercury is not over the limit per lamp. Mercury was determined from the phosphor powders that kind of them affects efficiency of lamp. As a technique; hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry was used. Advantages of this technique; &# 61656; Limit of detection is lowered degree of ppb (&# 956;g/L). &# 61656; The special advantage of the hydride generation technique is its very high sensitivity combined with an effiecent separation of the analyte from the matrix. In addition this technique offers the possibility of a separate determination of the various oxidation states of the analytes. In this study high-resolution continuum source atomic absorption spectrometer (HR-CS AAS) was used as a machine. Components of HR-CS AAS are the radiation source, the atomizer, the optical system and the detector. In HR-CS AAS one single radition source is used for all elements and wavelengths, a xenon short-arc lamp. However, these commercially lamps don’t have enough energy in the far UV range, where most of analytical lines of AAS are located. It was therefore necessary to re-design this lamp type for ues in AAS. The emission intensity of this lamp is at least a factor of 10 higher than that of conventional xenon short-arc lamps and more tan a factor of 100 higher in the far UV range. The emmission intensity of this lamp is in average a factor of 100 higher than that of conventional HCL over the entire spectral range. One of the big advantages of HR-CS AAS is for sure that only a single radition source is required for all elements and all wavelengths over the entire spectral range from (190 - 900 nm). Another advantage results from the significantly higher emission intensity of this lamp. Although the radiation intensity has no influence on sensitivity in AAS, it has an influence on the signal-to-noise ratio. As a result of this, detection limits are in average about a factor of 5 better in HR-CS AAS, compared to line source AAS. In HR-CS AAS the same atomizers are used as in classical line source AAS. The optical system in HR-CS AAS is fundamentally different from that in AAS, although similar components are used. The use of a continuum radiation source requires a high resolution monochromator. Classical monochromators of this type, as they were used in optical emmision reqiure a lot of space and have a tendency to exhibit wavelength drift. Both of these characteristics are unacceptable. in HR-CS AAS. This problem was solved with the design of a compact double monochromator with active wavelength stabilization. In HR-CS AAS a linear CCD array with typically 512 pixels is used as the detector, 200 of which are used for analytical purposes. All the 200 pixels are illuminated and read out simultaneously. As only three pixels are used in most cases to measure atomic absorption, the others may be used for correction purposes. This results in an extremely stable system with low noise level and significantly improved signal-to-noise ratios. DoktoraPh...|$|R
40|$|Natural {{organic matter}} (NOM), {{ubiquitous}} in natural water sources, {{is generated by}} biogeochemical processes in both the water body and in the surrounding watershed, {{as well as from}} the contribution of organic compounds that enter the water as a result of human activity. NOM significantly affects the properties of the water source, including the ability to transport metals, influence the aggregation kinetics of colloidal particles, serve as a food source for microorganisms and act as a precursor in the formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs), as well as imparting a brown colour to the water. The reactivity of NOM is closely tied to its physicochemical properties, such as aromaticity, elemental composition, functional group content and molecular weight (MW) distribution. The MW distribution is an important consideration from a water treatment perspective for several reasons. For example, low MW NOM decreases the efficiency of treatment with activated carbon, and this fraction is thought to be the portion most difficult to remove using coagulation. The efficiency of membranes in the treatment of drinking water is also influenced by the MW distribution of NOM, while some studies have shown that the low MW fraction contributes disproportionately to the formation of bioavailable organic matter, therefore promoting the formation of biofilms in the distribution system. For these reasons, understanding the MW distribution of NOM is important for the treatment of natural waters for use as drinking waters. Optimisation of a high pressure size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) method for analysis of the MW distribution of NOM in natural waters is described (Chapter 2). Several parameters influencing the performance of HPSEC are tested and an optimised set of conditions illustrated. These parameters included eluent composition, ionic strength of the sample, flow rate and injection volume. Firstly, it was found that increasing the ionic strength of the HPSEC eluent resulted in less exclusion of NOM from the stationary phase. Stationary phases used in HPSEC contain a residual negative charge that can repel the negatively charged regions of NOM, effectively reducing the accessible pore volume. By increasing the ionic strength, interactions between the stationary phase and eluent enabled a larger effective pore size for the NOM analytes. However, increasing ionic strength of the eluent also resulted in a loss of peak resolution for the NOM portion able to access the pore volume of the stationary phase. Determining the ideal eluent composition required the balancing of these two outcomes. Matching of the ionic strength of the sample with the eluent was also an important consideration. Retention times were slightly lower when the sample ionic strength was not matched with the eluent, especially for the lowest MW material, although the effect on chromatography was minimal. Flow rate had no effect on the resolution of the HPSEC chromatogram for the portion of material able to permeate the pore space of the stationary phase. Changes in the volume of sample injected had a marked effect on the elution profile of the NOM sample. Besides the obvious limitation of detection limit, only minor changes in elution profile were obtained up to an injection volume of 100 µL. Volumes above this value, however, resulted in significant peak broadening issues, as well as an undesirable effect on the low MW portion of detected DOC. In Chapter 3, high pressure size exclusion chromatography with UV 254 [subscript] and on-line detection of organic carbon (HPSEC-UV 254 [subscript]-OCD) was used to compare the removal of different apparent MW fractions of DOC by two process streams operating in parallel at the local Wanneroo groundwater treatment plant (GWTP). One of these two process streams included alum coagulation (operating in an enhanced coagulation mode (EC) for increased DOC removal) and the other stream included a magnetic ion exchange (MIEX®) process followed by alum coagulation (MIEX®-C). The MIEX® process is based on a micro-sized, macroporous, strong base anion exchange resin with magnetic properties, which has been designed to remove NOM through ion exchange of the anionic sites in NOM. Water was sampled from five key locations within these process streams, and the DOC at each location was characterised in terms of its MW distribution. HPSEC was carried out using three different on-line detector systems, namely OCD, UV absorbance detection at 254 nm, and fluorescence detection (λex[subscript]= 282 nm; λim[subscript] = 353 nm). This approach provided significant information on the chemical nature of the DOC in the various MW fractions. The MIEX®-C process was found to outperform the EC process: these two processes removed similar amounts of high and low MW DOC, but the MIEX®-C process showed greater removal of DOC from the intermediate MW fractions. The two coagulation processes (EC and coagulation following MIEX®) showed good removal of the fractions of highest MW, while the MIEX® process alone was found to remove DOC across all MW fractions. These results seem to indicate that anionic groups, particularly susceptible to removal with MIEX® treatment, are well distributed across all MW fractions of NOM. In agreement with previous studies, MIEX®-C outperformed EC in the overall removal of DOC (MIEX®-C removed 25 % more DOC than EC). However, 70 % of the additional DOC removed by MIEX®-C was comprised of a surprisingly narrow range of medium-high MW fractions. The development of a novel online organic carbon detector (OCD) for use with HPSEC for determining the MW distribution of NOM is described in Chapter 4. With UV absorbance detection, the magnitude of the signal is based on the extinction coefficient of the chromophores in the analytes being investigated; whereas the signal from an OCD is proportional to the actual organic carbon concentrations, providing significantly more information. The development of an online OCD involved the separation of analytes using HPSEC, removal of inorganic carbon species which may interfere with organic carbon determination, oxidation of the organic carbon to carbon dioxide, separation of the produced carbon dioxide from the aqueous phase and subsequent detection of the gaseous carbon dioxide. In the new instrument, following separation of components by HPSEC, the sample stream was acidified with orthophosphoric acid to a concentration of 20 mmol L- 1 [superscript], resulting in a pH of ≤ 2, in order to convert inorganic carbon to carbon dioxide. This acid dose was found to remove greater than 99 % of inorganic carbon once the acidified sample was passed through a hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane allowing the passage of dissolved gases (under negative pressure from a vacuum pump) but restricting the flow of the mobile phase. Several factors influenced the oxidation of the organic carbon in the next step, including the dose of persulfate, the type and intensity of UV radiation and the composition of the capillary through which the sample stream passes. Through optimisation of this process, it was found that a persulfate dose of 0. 84 mmol L- 1 [superscript] in the sample stream was required for optimum oxidation efficiency. A medium pressure UV lamp was compared to a <b>vacuum</b> UV <b>lamp</b> for its efficiency in oxidation of organic carbon to carbon dioxide. While the medium pressure lamp produced a far smaller percentage of its total radiation at the optimum wavelength for oxidation of organic compounds, the greater overall intensity of the medium pressure lamp was shown to be superior for this application. The composition of the capillary was shown to have a considerable effect on the oxidation efficiency. A quartz capillary, internal diameter 0. 6 mm, was compared with a PTFE capillary, internal diameter 0. 5 mm, for the oxidation of organic carbon by external UV treatment. While peak width, an important consideration in chromatographic resolution, was greater for the larger internal diameter quartz capillary, the lower UV transparency of PTFE combined with the shorter contact time, due to the reduced internal diameter of the capillary, resulted in a less efficient oxidation step using the PTFE capillary. The quartz capillary was therefore chosen for use in the UV/persulfate oxidation step for oxidation of organic carbon to carbon dioxide. Separation of the produced carbon dioxide from the sample stream was achieved by sparging with nitrogen and contacting the gas/liquid mixture with a hydrophobic PTFE membrane, restricting the passage of the liquid while allowing the nitrogen and carbon dioxide gases to pass to the detection system. The only factor influencing this separation was the flow of the nitrogen sparge gas, with a flow of 2 mL min- 1 [superscript] found to be optimum. Detection of produced carbon dioxide was via a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer with a Iightpipe accessory. The Iightpipe accessory was designed for use as a detector for gas chromatography and the small size of the detector cell was ideal for use with this application. Using the new system described, concentrations of a single peak could be determined with a detection limit of 31 ng and a determination limit of 68 ng. The development of the new OCD allowed characterisation of NOM in terms of its MW distribution and the UV and fluorescence spectral properties of each MW fraction. Further characterisation of MW fractions of NOM from a local groundwater bore was carried out by separation of the fractions by preparative HPSEC, followed by off-line analysis. Preparative HPSEC involved the injection of a pre-concentrated groundwater sample multiple times, using a large scale HPSEC column, then collecting and combining material of identical MW. This allowed each MW fraction of the sample to be further characterised as described in Chapter 5. Preparative HPSEC has only previously been applied to a small|$|R
