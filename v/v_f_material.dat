40|$|Objective: The JAK 2 <b>V</b> 617 <b>F</b> {{mutation}} {{is present}} in the majority of patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). The impact of this mutation on disease phenotype in ET and PMF is still a matter of discussion. This study aims to determine whether there are differences in clinical presentation and disease outcome between ET and PMF patients with and without the JAK 2 <b>V</b> 617 <b>F</b> mutation. <b>Materials</b> and Methods: In this single-center study, a total of 184 consecutive Philadelphia-negative chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms, 107 cases of ET and 77 cases of PMF, were genotyped for JAK 2 <b>V</b> 617 <b>F</b> mutation using the JAK 2 Ipsogen MutaScreen assay, which involves allele-specific polymerase chain reaction. Results: ET patients positive for JAK 2 <b>V</b> 617 <b>F</b> mutation had higher hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct) levels, lower platelet counts, and more prevalent splenomegaly at diagnosis compared to patients negative for the JAK 2 <b>V</b> 617 <b>F</b> mutation, but rates of major thrombotic events, arterial thrombosis, and venous thrombosis were comparable between the groups. At presentation, PMF patients with JAK 2 <b>V</b> 617 <b>F</b> mutation had significantly higher Hb and Hct levels and leukocyte counts than patients without the mutation. Similar to the findings of ET patients, thromboembolic rates were similar in PMF patients with and without theJAK 2 <b>V</b> 617 <b>F</b> mutation. For ET and PMF patients, no difference was observed in rates of death with respect to JAK 2 <b>V</b> 617 <b>F</b> mutational status. Moreover, leukemic transformation rate was not different in our PMF patients with and without JAK 2 <b>V</b> 617 <b>F</b> mutation. Conclusion: We conclude that JAK 2 V 617 F-mutated ET patients express a polycythemia vera-like phenotype and JAK 2 <b>V</b> 617 <b>F</b> mutation in PMF patients is associated with a more pronounced myeloproliferative phenotype...|$|R
40|$|Myelofibrosis with myeloid {{metaplasia}} is chronic mieloproliferative {{disease with}} ineffective erythropoiesis, dysplastic-megakaryocyte hyperplasia, {{and an increase}} in the ratio of immature granulocytes to total granulocytes. The incidence rate is 3. 7 – 5. 7 per 100, 000 and the median survival is estimated to be between three and six years. The pathogenesis of myelofibrosis might be explained, in part, by a somatic point mutation on exon 14 (<b>V</b> 617 <b>F)</b> of the JAK 2 kinase gene that is located on chromosome 9 p 24. However, mechanisms of regulation of microenvironment in bone marrow fibrosis are not clear. Considered that main producents of pro-fibrotic factors are the megakaryocytes and the macrophages. In this study we investigated influence of platelet factors on the cellular characteristics of the macrophages with oncogenic mutation JAK 2 <b>V</b> 617 <b>F.</b> <b>Materials</b> and Methods: THP- 1 cell line was modified by lentiviral modification. Two cell lines established: one with expression of JAK 2 with oncogenic mutation JAK 2 <b>V</b> 617 <b>F,</b> another wild type JAK 2. Cells were cultured in RPMI- 1640 containing 0. 1 % gentamicin, 1 % l-glutamine and 10 % fetal bovine serum (FBS) or 5 %, 10 % and 15 % platelet lysate (PL). Cell lines were differentiated into the macrophages using 50  ng/ml phorbolmyristate acetate (PMA). Level of expression transforming growth factor β (TGFβ), galectin- 3, matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) 2, 9, 12, 13 and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP) accessed by specific RT-qPCR. Results: We observed increased expression level of galectin- 3, MMP- 2, MMP- 13 and TIMP- 3 in JAK 2 <b>V</b> 617 <b>F</b> expressing macrophages cultured with 10 % FBS compare to ones with WT JAK 2. Also macrophages containing mutation JAK 2 <b>V</b> 617 <b>F</b> has increased level of expression of MMP- 2, TIMP- 3 and TIMP- 4 when cultured with 10 % platelet lysate. Also, cell line containing mutation JAK 2 <b>V</b> 617 <b>F</b> has increased levels of expression of MMP- 12 for cells cultured with 15 % PL. We did not observe any significant difference in expression of TGFβ, MMP- 9, TIMP- 1 and - 2. Conclusion: Increased levels of expression of galectin- 3, MMP- 12 and - 13 suggest that platelet factors induce macrophages with JAK 2 <b>V</b> 617 <b>F</b> mutation to release of profibrotic factors. On the other hand, increase of antifibrotic MMP- 2 and TIMP- 3 revealing complex nature of melofibrosis development and need to be analyzed further.

The inheritance of <b>V</b> <b>f</b> was examined in six progenies by testing linked molecular markers. Three progenies showed distorted segregations that could be explained by three sub-lethal genes (sl 1, sl 2 and sl 3), of which sl 1, sl 2 were closely linked to <b>V</b> <b>f.</b> The s 11 gene was located at about 14 cM from <b>V</b> <b>f</b> and expressed itself only in the presence of another independently segregating sub-lethal gene sl 3.

A real valued function f defined on M is called an affine function if its D-hessian vanishes identically. This means that the covariant derivative D(df) of df vanishes iden-tically.

40|$|Cell {{adhesion}} is {{an intricate}} process involving adhesion promoting ligands such as laminin and fibronectin, surface receptors for these ligands and a complex interplay of metabolic and cytoskeletal events (Geiger, BBA 737 : 305, 1983). Although considerable {{effort has been}} directed towards studying adhesion molecules such as fibronectin (Fn), very {{little is known about}} the mechanisms regulating the complex process of adhesion. ^ I chose to use a CHO adhesion variant clone called AD(2 ̆ 7 <b>v)</b> <b>F</b> 11 as a tool to study the various steps which may be involved in adhesion. AD(2 ̆ 7 <b>v)</b> <b>F</b> 11 cells unlike wild type (WT), do not adhere to Fn-coated substrata, but will adhere to substrata coated with other extracellular components (Harper and Juliano, J Cell Biol. 91 : 647, 1981). I have found that although AD(2 ̆ 7 <b>v)</b> <b>F</b> 11 cells can bind Fn-coated latex beads to the same extent as WT cells, AD(2 ̆ 7 <b>v)</b> <b>F</b> 11 cells also differed from WT cells in that they did not aggregate in the presence of Fn-beads nor internalize Fn-beads. The defect in bead induced cell aggregation and internalization seem to be specific to Fn since lectin coated beads could aggregate AD(2 ̆ 7 <b>v)</b> <b>F</b> 11 cells as well as WT cells, and AD(2 ̆ 7 <b>v)</b> <b>F</b> 11 cells can also readily internalize lectins. These observations suggest that the defect associated with AD(2 ̆ 7 <b>v)</b> <b>F</b> 11 cells is distal to the initial binding to Fn to its cell surface receptor. To further investigate the biochemical defect associated with AD(2 ̆ 7 <b>v)</b> <b>F</b> 11 cells, a panel of compounds were examined for their ability to correct the non-adhesive phenotype of AD(2 ̆ 7 <b>v)</b> <b>F</b> 11 cells. Among the compounds tested, only those known to increase intracellular cAMP levels were found to be effective in correcting the adhesion defect of F 11 CA 11 cells, a subclone of AD(2 ̆ 7 <b>v)</b> <b>F</b> 11 cells. ^ Since cAMP effects in eukaryotic cells are mediated through phosphorylation events by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAdPK) system, the phosphorylation pattern and cAdPK system of the F 11 CA 11 cells were analyzed. Comparison between the phosphorylation pattern of intact untreated F 11 CA 11 and WT cells, revealed the presence of a 50 kd phosphoprotein(s) in WT cells but not in F 11 CA 11 cells. Results presented in this dissertation strongly indicate that the adhesion defect in F 11 CA 11 is associated to an altered type I cAdPK that can be corrected by raising intracellular cAMP levels.
