As humans evolved anthropologically, the bacteria evolved biologically. It is widely accepted that the advent of agriculture in early human populations provided the conditions S. mutans needed to evolve into the <b>virulent</b> <b>bacteria</b> it is today. Agriculture introduced fermented foods, as well as more carbohydrate rich foods, into the diets of historic human populations.

Also, consuming more carbohydrates increased the amount of sugars available to S. mutans for metabolism and lowered the pH of the oral cavity. This new acidic habitat would select for those bacteria that could survive and reproduce at a lower pH.|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} studiesdescribed {{in this report}} support the ideas that {{virulence}} of Vibrio vulnificus is associated, at least in part, with resistance to phagocytosis and that {{the ability of the}} bacterium to resist phagocytosis results from its possession of an an-tiphagocytic surface antigen. Theseconclusions are based on the observations that (1) human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) exhibited a significantly weaker chemiluminescent response and phagocytic response when interacting with a virulent strain of the bacterium than when challenged with a weakly virulent strain of the bacterium; (2) rabbit antiserumto the virulentbacterium, but not normal rabbit serum, significantly enhanced the chemiluminescent response of PMNLs challenged with the <b>virulent</b> <b>bacterium</b> and significantly enhanced ingestion of the bacterium by the PMNLs; and (3) the opsonicactivity of the antiserumwasremoved by adsorption witha formalin-killed, whole cell preparation of the <b>virulent</b> <b>bacterium.</b> The halophilic bacterium Vibrio vulnificus, also called "lactose-positive Vibrio species " and Beneckea vulnifica [1], is a recently recognized pathogen which causes wound infections, septice-mia, meningitis, pneumonia, and keratitis [1 - 5]. Various conditions which deleteriously affect host defense mechanisms, such as diabetes, congestive heart disease, and hepatic disease, are known to predispose humans to life-threatening infection by V. vulnificus [3]; however, very little is known concerning the bacterial components or products that may be important in the pathogenesis of disease caused by the bacterium.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activity of a cardiovascular drug dobutamine hydrochloride. METHODS: The {{minimum inhibitory concentration}} (MIC) of dobutamine was determined both by agar and broth dilution methods against 331 strains of bacteria from three gram positive and 13 gram negative genera. The antibacterial action of dobutamine was further tested in animal models. RESULTS: Dobutamine was seen to possess powerful inhibitory action (5 - 200 mg/mL) against most test bacteria in in vitro studies. It was bacteriostatic in nature. In vivo studies showed that the drug offered significant protection (p< 0. 001) to mice challenged with a <b>virulent</b> <b>bacterium.</b> CONCLUSION: Dobutamine showed remarkable antibacterial property against several pathogenic bacteria.

A gene cluster responsible for secretion of the polysaccharide capsule has been identified and shown to inhibit the antibiotic effect of complement when grown on ascites fluid. A decrease in killing associated with loss of capsule production was then demonstrated using a rat virulence model.|$|E

40|$|A new {{generation}} of whooping-cough vaccines contain P. 69 pertactin, a surface-exposed domain of an outer membrane protein expressed by the <b>virulent</b> <b>bacterium</b> Bordetella pertussis. This protein is a virulence factor that mediates adhesion to target mammalian cells, a reaction that is in part mediated by an RGD sequence. The X-ray crystal structure of P. 69 pertactin has been determined to 2. 5 A. The protein fold consists of a 16 -stranded parallel beta-helix with a V-shaped cross-section, and is the largest beta-helix known to date. Several between-strand weakly conserved amino-acid repeats form internal and external ladders. The structure appears as a helix from which several loops protrude, which contain sequence motifs associated with the biological activity of the protein. One particular (GGXXP) 5 sequence is located directly after the RGD motif, and may mediate interaction with epithelial cells.

40|$|When large {{foreign bodies}} such as erythrocytes, {{polystyrene}} particles, or microorganisms have been ingested by cultured mouse macrophages, they are enclosed within endocytic vacuoles or phagosomes.

The case of microorganisms, {{some of which are}} well-adapted intracellular parasites, poses particular and interesting problems. For a bacterium that is rapidly inactivated in macrophages, lysosomal fusion followed by digestion is a common and effective means of disposal, as it is in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (5, 6).

This approach constructs ordered restriction maps from randomly sheared individual DNA molecules directly extracted from cells. The two maps served different purposes; the XhoI map facilitated sequence assembly by providing a scaffold for high-resolution alignment, while the PvuII map verified genome sequence assembly. Our results show that such maps facilitated the closure of sequence gaps and, most importantly, provided a purely independent means for sequence validation. Given the recent advancements to the optical mapping system, increased resolution and throughput are enabling such maps to guide sequence assembly at a very early stage of a microbial sequencing project...|$|R

50|$|The healing corneal wounds {{consist of}} newly {{abutting}} corneal stroma, fibroblastic cells, and irregular fibrous connective tissue. Closer to the wound surface lies the epithelial plug, {{a bed of}} the cells that form the normal corneal epithelium which have fallen into the wound. Often this plug is {{three to four times}} as deep as the normal corneal epithelium layer. As the cells migrate from the depth of the plug up to the surface, some die before reaching it, forming breaches in the otherwise healthy epithelial layer. This, consequently, leaves the cornea more susceptible to infections. The risk is estimated to be between 0.25% and 0.7% Healing of the RK incisions is very slow and unpredictable, often incomplete even years after surgery. Similarly, infection of these chronic wounds can also occur years after surgery, with 53% of ocular infections being late in onset.

40|$|It {{is poorly}} {{understood}} why a particular plant species is {{resistant to the}} vast majority of potential pathogens that infect other plant species, a phenomenon referred to as “nonhost” resistance. Here, we show that Arabidopsis NHO 1, encoding a glycerol kinase, is required for resistance to and induced by Pseudomonas syringae isolates from bean and tobacco. NHO 1 is also required for resistance to the fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea, indicating that NHO 1 is not limited to bacterial resistance. Strikingly, P. s. pv. tomato DC 3000, an isolate fully virulent on Arabidopsis, actively suppressed the NHO 1 expression. This suppression is abolished in coi 1 plants, indicating that DC 3000 required an intact jasmonic acid signaling pathway in the plant to suppress NHO 1 expression. Constitutive overexpression of NHO 1 led to enhanced resistance to this otherwise <b>virulent</b> <b>bacterium.</b> The presence of avrB in DC 3000, which activates a cultivar-specific “gene-for-gene” resistance in Arabidopsis, restored the induction of NHO 1 expression.
