25|$|Locking pliers, Mole grips or Vise-Grips are pliers {{that can}} be locked into position, using an {{over-center}} action. One side of the handle includes a bolt {{that is used to}} adjust the spacing of the jaws, {{the other side of the}} handle, especially in larger models, often includes a lever to push the two sides of the handles apart to unlock the pliers. William Petersen of DeWitt, Nebraska, invented and patented a primitive version of a wrench in 1921. However, it wasn't until 1924 that the first locking pliers with a locking handle that Petersen called the <b>Vise-Grip</b> was patented.|$|E

After approximately 45 seconds, he became disturbed at [...] "the look in her eyes" [...] {{and ran to the}} front of the van, vomiting. Bittaker then manually strangled Schaefer until she collapsed to the ground and began convulsing. He then twisted a wire coat hanger around her neck with <b>vise-grip</b> pliers until Schaefer's convulsions ceased.

50|$|In 1924, another blacksmith, Danish {{immigrant}} William Petersen of DeWitt, Nebraska, {{invented the}} first locking pliers and named them <b>Vise-Grips.</b> In 1934, Petersen formed the Petersen Manufacturing Company to produce them. In 1957, Petersen added an easy-release trigger to the design, creating the modern locking pliers design.|$|R

50|$|The first locking pliers, named <b>Vise-Grips,</b> {{were invented}} by William S. Peterson in De Witt, Nebraska in 1924. Mole grips were {{developed}} by Thomas Coughtrie (1917-2008) in 1955, then managing director of M. K. Mole and Son.Mole Grips were manufactured in Newport South Wales just off the M4 by the Brynglas Tunnels; travelling west, the Mole sign was visible immediately before entering the tunnel.|$|R

5000|$|Tools {{are also}} {{often used to}} {{substitute}} for many mechanical apparatuses, especially in older mechanical devices. In many cases a cheap tool {{could be used to}} occupy the place of a missing mechanical part. A window roller in a car could easily be replaced with a pair of <b>vise-grips</b> or regular pliers. A transmission shifter or ignition switch would be able to be replaced with a screw-driver. Again, these would be considered tools that are being used for their unintended purposes, substitution as makeshift. Tools such as a rotary tool would be considered the substitution [...] "by-design", or [...] "multi-purpose". This class of tools allows the use of one tool that has at least two different capabilities. [...] "Multi-purpose" [...] tools are basically multiple tools in one device/tool. Tools such as this are often power tools that come with many different attachments like a rotary tool does, so you could say that a power drill is a [...] "multi-purpose" [...] tool because you can do more than just one thing with a power drill.|$|R
5000|$|In 2008, Irwin {{announced}} {{the closing of}} its DeWitt, Nebraska plant, ending 80 years of American production for Vise-Grips, citing a necessity to move production to China [...] "to keep the <b>Vise-Grip</b> name competitive." ...|$|E

5000|$|A popular tool, {{called the}} <b>Vise-Grip,</b> was first {{manufactured}} in De Witt. The <b>Vise-Grip</b> was originally manufactured in De Witt by Petersen Manufacturing, founded by Danish immigrant William Petersen. Petersen, a blacksmith by trade, invented the first locking pliers and began selling {{them from the}} trunk of his car to farmers and people in surrounding towns. In 1985 American Tool Companies Inc. was formed by the Petersen family, and it in turn acquired Petersen Manufacturing. In 1993 American Tool acquired Irwin Industrial. The company operated under the Irwin Industrial name beginning in 2002 when it was purchased by Newell Rubbermaid.http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26531610/ On October 31, 2008 the plant was closed and 330 jobs were lost when manufacturing of Vise-Grips and other tools moved to China. http://www.1011now.com/home/headlines/33646769.html ...|$|E

5000|$|Silas {{successfully}} claimed self-defense in gunning down Frank Michelle Jr. who, on January 19, 1969, at George's behest, {{was attempting}} to replace the battery of a malfunctioning tracking device on his car. Michelle was shot nine times, and with three different weapons: an M1 carbine and [...]22- and [...]38-caliber pistols. Silas reportedly boasted of crushing the man's testicles, using <b>vise-grip</b> pliers.|$|E
50|$|Before the flight, Denver and the {{mechanic}} {{had attempted to}} extend {{the reach of the}} handle, using a pair of <b>Vise-Grip</b> pliers. However, this did not solve the problem, and the pilot still could not reach the handle while strapped into his seat. NTSB investigators' post-accident investigation showed that because of the positioning of the fuel selector valves, switching fuel tanks required the pilot to turn his body 90 degrees to reach the valve. This created a natural tendency to extend one's right foot against the right rudder pedal to support oneself while turning in the seat, which caused the aircraft to yaw (Nose right) and pitch up.|$|E

40|$|Backgrounds/Aims: We {{investigated}} the clinical application of extended distal pancreatectomy {{in patients with}} pancre-atic neck cancer accompanied by distal pancreatic atrophy. In this study, we have emphasized on {{the technical aspects of}} using the linear stapling device for a bulky target organ. Methods: From March 2010 to September 2013, 46 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, who underwent pancreatic resection with radical intent at our institute, were reviewed retrospectively. Among them, three patients (6. 5 %) underwent extended distal pancreatectomy. A linear stapling device and <b>vise-grip</b> locking pliers were used for en bloc resection of the distal pancreas, first duodenal portion, and distal common bile duct. The results were compared with those after standard pancreatectomy. Results: All three patients presented with jaundice, and the ratio of pancreatic duct to parenchymal thickness of the pancreatic body was greater than 0. 5. Grade A pancreatic fistula developed in all of the cases, but none of these fistulae were lethal. Pathological staging was T 3 N 1 M 0 in all of the patients. The postoperative daily serum glucose fluctuations and insulin requirements were comparable to those in patients who received pancreaticoduodenectomy or distal pancreatectomy. At the last follow-up, two patients were alive with liver metastasis at 4 and 10 months postoperatively, respectively, and one patient died of liver metastasis at 5 months postoperatively. Conclusions: While the prognosis of advanced pancreatic neck adenocarcinoma is still dismal, extended distal pancreatectomy is a valid treatment option, especially when there is atrophy of the distal pancreas. Also, the procedure is technically feasible, and further refinement is necessary to im...|$|E
