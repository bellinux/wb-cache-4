5|$|After {{his success}} at Zaragoza, {{the team was}} in need of money, as a result, Villa made his big move to one of Spanish football's heavyweights, as a new look <b>Valencia</b> under Quique Sánchez Flores parted with €12million to secure his {{services}} in the summer of 2005. During his first game in a <b>Valencia</b> shirt, an Intertoto Cup match against Belgian outfit Gent, Villa scored the first goal in a game which <b>Valencia</b> won 2–0. He made his league debut for <b>Valencia</b> coming on as a substitute against Real Betis in a 1–0 win on 27 August 2005. The next match would see his previous team, Zaragoza, leading 2–1 {{for the majority of the}} match; however, on the 81st minute, Villa came on as a late substitute for Rubén Baraja and scored the equalizer within the space of a minute, earning <b>Valencia</b> a point in a 2–2 draw.|$|E

5|$|In the 2009 close season, {{there were}} rumours linking Žigić with moves to clubs {{including}} Sunderland, Monaco, and Bordeaux, but the player insisted his intention was and {{always had been}} to be successful with <b>Valencia.</b> He made 26 appearances for the club in 2009–10 in all competitions, {{more than in the}} previous two seasons combined, but only 5 were league starts. Within four minutes of replacing the injured David Villa in the league match against Racing in October, he took advantage of a defensive error to score the only goal of the game; out of respect for his former club, he did not celebrate. On 2 January 2010, his 93rd-minute header against Espanyol took <b>Valencia</b> third in the table, and his double against Deportivo La Coruña in the 2009–10 Copa del Rey put <b>Valencia</b> 2–0 up at half-time; the game finished 2–2 and <b>Valencia</b> lost 4–3 on aggregate. With four minutes left of the Europa League quarter-final second leg, <b>Valencia</b> were denied a penalty when an Atlético Madrid defender pulled Žigić to the ground so forcefully that a large hole was torn in the front of his shirt, apparently unnoticed by referee or goalline official; the tie ended goalless, so Atlético progressed on away goals from the first leg and {{went on to win the}} competition. Away to Espanyol on 1 May, again as a substitute for Villa, he scored both goals in a 2–0 win that secured <b>Valencia</b> a place in the next season's Champions League.|$|E
5|$|That season, Villa {{once again}} saw himself playing Champions League football. He scored the only goal in a 1–0 win against Schalke 04 {{and went on}} to put <b>Valencia</b> 1–0 up against Chelsea, {{although}} goals from Joe Cole and Didier Drogba saw <b>Valencia</b> lose 2–1. <b>Valencia</b> finished bottom of the group and were knocked out. On his 100th league appearance for <b>Valencia,</b> Villa scored a hat-trick against Levante; his 54th, 55th and 56th league goals for the club. Another two goals {{on the final day of}} the season against Atlético Madrid completed his tally of 18 goals that season.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{sustaining}} {{a serious}} injury as a child, Villa started his professional career with Sporting de Gijón. He moved to Real Zaragoza after two seasons, {{where he made}} his La Liga debut, winning the Copa del Rey and Supercopa de España. He joined <b>Valencia</b> CF in 2005 for a transfer fee of €12million and {{was part of the}} <b>Valencia</b> team that won the Copa del Rey in the 2007–08 season. Villa hit his La Liga goalscoring peak while at <b>Valencia,</b> scoring 28 league goals in the 200809 season. In 2010, he moved to FC Barcelona for €40million, where he won his first La Liga and UEFA Champions League titles. He was one of the goalscorers in the 2011 final of the Champions League as Barcelona defeated Manchester United, 31. After a €5.1 million transfer, he spent the 201314 season at Atlético Madrid, winning another La Liga title before leaving to play for New York City.|$|E

5|$|Hitting a {{consistent}} goalscoring form during mid-season, Villa scored against Deportivo La Coruña, {{although he was}} sent off during the match after his second yellow card, received due to a foul on Daniel Aranzubia; as a result, he missed Valencia's next match against Real Valladolid, a game <b>Valencia</b> lost 2–1 at home. Ready to return from suspension, Villa suffered from an inflammation in the joint in his left knee due to a partial dislocation and would be ruled out for the next 15 days, missing games against Numancia, Recreativo de Huelva and Racing de Santander. When he finally returned from injury on 5 April 2009, he had no trouble recovering form, netting a brace in a match against Getafe which <b>Valencia</b> won 4–1. On 12 April, Villa was set to return to El Molinón, the home ground of Sporting de Gijón where he started his career. He admitted that the encounter would be very emotional for him but went on to score the second <b>Valencia</b> goal in a 3–2 win and kept a pre-match promise by not celebrating the goal. His goal against Villarreal brought his tally to 26, and he then scored another two against Athletic Bilbao, finishing with 28 goals after the last game of the season, thus equalling records set by the Argentinian Mario Kempes and the Montenegrin Predrag Mijatović, who also scored 28 goals in a <b>Valencia</b> shirt in 1978 and 1996, respectively. Kempes reached his tally of 28 goals in 34 games while Mijatović achieved it in 40, ultimately seeing Villa beat their percentages, as he achieved the 28 goals in 33 games, recording a goal ratio of 0.84 goals per game. That season saw Villa's best goal-scoring season at <b>Valencia.</b>|$|E
