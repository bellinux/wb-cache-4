40|$|The {{importance}} of crop genetic improvement research {{is demonstrated by}} the Green Revolution, {{which led to a}} rapid increase in food production in Asia. Those productivity gains contributed to a reduction in poverty directly through increased farm-household income and indirectly through a long-term decline in the prices of food grains, which account for a large share of poor consumers’ expenditure. The success of crop genetic improvement research that {{led to the development of}} improved varieties of food crops is well documented (Evenson and Gollin, 2003; Bantilan et al., 2013). Despite the rapid progress made in the past, poverty is still concentrated in South Asia with around 571 million or one-third of the world’s poor, estimated at about 1. 29 billion in 2011 (World Bank, 2012). Substantial scope exists for further reducing poverty through crop genetic improvement by increasing or stabilizing the yield of major food crops, particularly the dryland crops in South Asia. Modern <b>varietal</b> <b>change</b> by itself may not lift large numbers of people out of poverty, but greater dynamism in this area can go a long way toward moving poor people closer to that threshold.

40|$|Since its {{founding}} in 1971, CIP has invested considerable resources in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) genetic improvement. CIP’s contribution to varieties released by national programs and to varieties grown by farmers was as-sessed from survey data in 30 countries that account for 85 % of developing-country production. In the 1990 s, about 40 % of national releases were directly related to CIP’s activities. However, by 1997, CIP–related releases only accounted for about 6 % of potato–growing area. CIP-related materials have had wider acceptance in smaller national programs with less area planted to potatoes than in stronger national agricultural research system (NARS). Moreover, CIP–related varieties are still relatively young because <b>varietal</b> <b>change</b> is substantially slower in potatoes than in cereals and in most other major field crops.

40|$|Realising {{productivity}} gains in agriculture {{is an important}} challenge for Pakistan. With a fast-growing population (3. 1 percent per year), {{it is difficult for}} the economy to meet domestic food requirements. Like most less developed countries, yields of most crops in Pakistan are lower than the yields realised by researchers in on-farm experiments conducted in the farmers’ fields. The average yield gap between the farmers’ current yields and what would be profitable and feasible, given existing technology, is reported to be 30 to 40 percent [Byerlee (1987) ]. Byerlee (1987), however, suggests that there is a potential for increasing productivity in most of the irrigated areas of Pakistan through the use of new inputs and a more efficient use of the existing inputs to exploit the genetic potential of the existing varieties. He argues that the wide array of new inputs vastly increases the complexity of crop management. The technical skills required to use the new inputs efficiently are much greater than the simple skills needed to adopt <b>varietal</b> <b>changes.</b> Hence, with more complex technological options and a more dynamic environment, the potential for economic inefficiency (both technical and allocative) is substantially increased. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to measure farm-specific allocative efficiency and the effect of management variables on allocative efficiency of wheat producers in an irrigated area in northern Pakistan. This will assist researchers, extension agents, and policy-makers to identify the ways and means to increase wheat productivity in Pakistan. ...|$|R
40|$|To {{enhance their}} {{standing}} in the market place the New Zealand Apple and Pear Marketing Board (NZAPMB) must maintain a balanced 'portfolio of products' (NZAPMB, 1990). This portfolio includes substantial volumes of traditionally traded varieties. Recent changes in the NZAPMB price mechanism have meant that orchardists are now paid closer to true market returns. There is now increasing financial pressure on orchardists to <b>change</b> their <b>varietal</b> mix to new 'preferred' and more profitable apple varieties. These <b>varietal</b> <b>changes</b> {{are expected to have}} serious consequences on the volume of traditional varieties supplied to the NZAPMB. New Zealand apple orchardists are expected to be profit maximising. Orchardists are expected to adapt to varietal price movements by renovating their orchards to a more profitable varietal mix. In the short run orchardists can reduce their varietal supply through tree removal. However, the apple production function dictates the speed at which orchardists can increase supply. Consequently, supply expansion to the NZAPMB can only occur some time after a price signal, while supply contraction can occur instantly. The French and Matthews (1971) supply response model provided a theoretical framework for this study. However, it is often limited by its exhaustive data requirement. The derivation of models within the French and Matthews framework was again restricted by data limitations. Simple models explaining varietal supply expansion and supply contraction were developed. The models showed that price significantly influenced supply contraction and supply expansion. The NZAPMB forecast supply expansion through monitoring varietal plantings and then applying yield functions. Supply expansion can be forecasted with reasonable accuracy. A robust econometric model which forecasts short run supply contraction would be of immediate use to the NZAPMB. This study identified the data required and the potential of a model to be developed for this purpose...|$|R
40|$|This report, {{prepared}} by Nepal's Center for Environmental and Agricultural Policy Research, Extension and Development (CEAPRED), provides {{a summary of}} the main results of a household baseline survey carried out in early 2011 in 7 villages, with 137 households, in the Rupandehi CCAFS site in Nepal. The survey was carried out using the standardized CCAFS household baseline tool. The results show that most households in Rupandehi produce a multitude of crops. The rice-wheat cropping pattern predominates in this area and many farmers integrate livestock such as cows and buffaloes with crops. Agricultural work on their own farms is shared by multiple members of the households, while men are more responsible for off-farm work. There are varied sources of income within the site, although almost one fifth of households do not have an off-farm source of cash. Many of the surveyed households in Rupandehi reported adopting new crops or varieties in the last 10 years and making cropping and soil related <b>changes.</b> <b>Varietal</b> <b>changes</b> could be observed mainly in rice and wheat, two very important crops for almost all farmers in this area. Changes in regards to livestock keeping practices, however, were not widespread. In terms of food security, many households in Rupandehi are food secure throughout the entire year. On-farm production provides the majority of the diet. Some households need to procure food from off-farm sources, particularly during the months of July, August and September. The area possesses highly productive soils for rice and wheat and it is considered a production bowl for Nepal, supplying large amounts of rice and wheat to the neighbouring districts. Land holdings in the site are small; almost 50 % of the surveyed households were marginal farmers (< 1 ha) followed by smallholders (1 - 2 ha) and medium holder farmers (2 - 5 ha). The area is characterized by having irrigation facilities in a substantial number of farm households (93 %). Use of agricultural inputs was universal, with many households using more than one type of fertilizer on their crops. Households also place great value on their livestock and purchase veterinary medicines when necessary. The survey shows that radio, TV, bicycle and cell phones are very common assets in this area. A majority of households receive electricity from a grid. Based on the index we constructed, more than three quarters of the surveyed households fall in the high level of asset ownership...|$|R

40|$|Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) regimes {{for plant}} {{breeding}} are generally justified {{on the basis}} that they encourage innovation. Introduction of IPR regimes for plant varieties in the United States has led to increased concentration, but it is less clear whether IPRs have promoted useful innovation, as measured by productivity of available corn hybrids. There are difficulties in finding a satisfactory measure of innovation in plant breeding, and in this paper we propose a procedure. Results from the annual corn hybrid trials conducted by 11 US universities over the 20 years from 1990 to 2009, at 365 separate locations in the 11 states, have been collated. This set of unbalanced panel data for grain corn hybrid trials has been used in a fixed effects model to estimate a production function for corn and the contribution to yield of the genetic characteristics of the corn hybrids. The Hausman Taylor estimator is then used to separate out the contribution of GM traits. Because the data are experimental, the production function can be interpreted as representing the technological frontier. The cross section is made up of the corn hybrids that were submitted for trial over the period. The fixed or unobserved time invariant effects represent the part of production which {{can be attributed to the}} characteristics of a particular hybrid. This is taken to be the contribution of the "genetics" of each hybrid to yield, and the maximum fixed or unobserved effect in any one year can be considered to represent the "frontier" of genetic contribution to increased yield. hybrid seed corn, GM traits, <b>varietal</b> <b>change,</b> fixed effects, random effects, Crop Production/Industries, Research and Development/Tech Change/Emerging Technologies, O 33, O 34,...|$|E
40|$|Historically, few {{articles}} {{have addressed the}} use of district level mill production data for analysing the effect of <b>varietal</b> <b>change</b> on sugarcane productivity trends. This appears {{to be due to}} lack of compiled district data sets and appropriate methods by which to analyse these data. Recently, varietal data on tonnes of sugarcane per hectare (TCH), sugar content (CCS), and their product, tonnes of sugar content per hectare (TSH) on a district basis, have been compiled. This study was conducted to develop a methodology for regular analysis of such data from mill districts to assess productivity trends over time, accounting for variety and variety x environment interaction effects for 3 mill districts (Mulgrave, Babinda, and Tully) from 1958 to 1995. Restricted maximum likelihood methodology was used to analyse the district level data and best linear unbiased predictors for random effects, and best linear unbiased estimates for fixed effects were computed in a mixed model analysis. In the combined analysis over districts, Q 124 was the top ranking variety for TCH, and Q 120 was top ranking for both CCS and TSH. Overall production for TCH increased over the 38 -year period investigated. Some of this increase can be attributed to varietal improvement, although the predictors for TCH have shown little progress since the introduction of Q 99 in 1976. Although smaller gains have been made in varietal improvement for CCS, overall production for CCS decreased over the 38 years due to non-varietal factors. Varietal improvement in TSH appears to have peaked in the mid- 1980 s. Overall production for TSH remained stable over time due to the varietal increase in TCH and the non-varietal decrease in CCS...|$|E

The choice of varieties to enrich, and their diffusion patterns, will influence the productivity and efficiency of wheat production. This analysis seeks to (1) compare the relative productivity and efficiency of farmers currently growing the most widely diffused wheat varieties, and (2) update our understanding of factors that influence productivity and efficiency of wheat production. We estimate a stochastic production function model with data from a survey of wheat farmers conducted in Punjab, Pakistan, in 2011. We find no differences in technical inefficiency effects associated with farmers growing the top four varieties, either alone or in combination with other varieties. With respect to human capital, older farmers tend to be more technically inefficient than younger farmers, but education has no statistical significance. Wheat farmers with access to extension advice are more efficient. Smaller-scale farmers and those in the mixed production zone tend to be more technically inefficient. Later adopters were not less efficient than earlier adopters, but time to <b>varietal</b> <b>change</b> is negatively related to the efficiency of wheat production.

In some areas like Muranga County, the decline {{was up to}} fivefold and coffee is now replaced by food crops in lower altitudes due to erratic rainfall and increased temperature. Projected mean temperature increase between 3 ºC and 4 ºC may result in yield losses of 8 - 22 percent by 2050 unless climate smart adaptation practices are undertaken. Adaptation depends on farmers noticing climate change has indeed affected them and perceiving the need for, and benefits from new production strategies. However, there is marked {{difference in the way}} scientists and farmers perceive climate change and how it affects agriculture. Therefore, this study aims to: 1) explore how cropping systems are changing; 2) analyse how scientists and farmers respectively perceive climate change; 3) present farm-level adaptation strategies and how climate smart strategies strengthen adaptive capacity of farmers. The study is based on interview of 120 farmers and collection of meteorological data. The data were analyzed in four directions: (1) farmers' perceptions about climate change, (2) trends for temperature and rainfall over 30 years, (3) relations between farmers' perception and climate data, (4) identification of adaptation strategies and adaptive capacity based on livelihood adaptation frameworks. The results revealed 1) 91 percent of the farmers perceived climate has changed, observing extended warmer seasons, changes in onset and cessation of rainfall which is indeed supported by meteorological data. 2) Only 54 percent of farmers are responding to the perceived changes, introducing climate smart practices such as <b>varietal</b> <b>change,</b> intercropping, irrigation and crop-livestock mixed farming. 3) Access to finance, human capacity building and information on weather are vital to strengthen farmers' adaptive capacity.

40|$|We {{undertook}} a historical review of wheat varietal improvements in South Africa from 1891 to 2013, thus extending {{the period of}} previous analyses. We identified popular wheat varieties, particularly those that {{form the basis for}} varietal improvements, and attempted to understand how policy changes in the wheat sector have affected wheat varietal improvements in the country over time. The empirical analysis is based on the critical review of information from policies, the varieties bred and their breeders, the years in which those varieties were bred, and pedigree information gathered from the journal Farming in South Africa, sourced mainly from the National Library of South Africa and the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) database. A database of the sources and uses of wheat varietal innovations in South Africa was developed using information from the above sources. The data, analysed using trend and graphical analysis, indicate that, from the 1800 s, wheat varietal improvements in the country focused on adaptability to the production area, yield potential and stability and agronomic characteristics (e. g. tolerance to diseases, pests and aluminium toxicity). An analysis of the sources of wheat varietal improvements during the different periods indicates that wheat breeding was driven initially by individual breeders and agricultural colleges. The current main sources of wheat varietal improvements in South Africa are Sensako, the Agricultural Research Council’s Small Grain Institute (ARC–SGI) and Pannar. The structural changes in the agricultural sector, particularly the establishment of the ARC–SGI and the deregulation of the wheat sector, have helped to harness the previously fragmented efforts in terms of wheat breeding. The most popular varieties identified for further analysis of cost attribution and the benefits of wheat varietal improvements were Gariep, Elands and Duzi.

40|$|In {{view of the}} {{changing}} climatic conditions mainly related to greenhouse effect, this study was focused on determining the responses of two differentially heat tolerant maize varieties to glasshouse condition. The parameters studies included growth, water relations, gas exchange, photosynthetic pigments, oxidative damage and gene expression. Results revealed that prevailing glasshouse conditions {{played a crucial role}} in affecting the maize growth across winter and summer seasons. Despite differences in the growing seasons and varieties glasshouse conditions were adverse for the photosynthetic systems in maize. Major yardsticks of sensitivity were loss of chlorophyll and carotenoids in the light reactions, while reductions in the net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance in the glasshouse grown maize. Prevailing glasshouse conditions were greatly effective in hampering the leaf water relation particularly those of winter sown crop. The glasshouse conditions in winter crop produced oxidative stress on the plants, which was explicit from the increased synthesis of H 2 O 2, MDA and increased permeability to the ion leakage. Greater free proline accumulation in the tolerant variety not only presented itself as a major amino acid accumulated in environmental stress tolerance but also indicated it as a reliable indicator of tolerance to glasshouse condition in maize. With great <b>varietal</b> difference, <b>changes</b> of temperature and relative humidity inside the glasshouse across the seasons were mainly responsible for the observed changes in mineral nutrients. More distinct changes were evident in K, Ca and nitrate nutrition, which were given greater credence in view of their closer association to the seasonal changes in the environmental conditions inside the glasshouse. Maize seedlings showed sensitivity to high temperature stress, which was recorded from morphological (reduction in shoot fresh weight, dry weight of shoot and root and a reduction in fresh-to-dry weight ratio) and gene expression patterns. The molecular studies suggested that the maize sensitivity to high temperature was mainly due to enhanced coexpression of sag and dhn 2 and failure to express hsp 70 and sgr 2 during relatively long term exposure to high temperature...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Correlation of {{sandstones}} u ing {{heavy minerals}} {{is dependent on}} the recognition and quantification of provenance-sensitive parameters. Suitable criteria include ratios of minerals that have similar hydraulic and diagenetic behaviour, and properties of populations of individual mineral species. Sandstones of the Statfjord Formation in the Snorre Field display marked variations in their heavy mineral assemblages. Although hydraulic and diagenetic processes have played some part in generating these variations, major changes {{in the nature of the}} source material can be detected on the basis of heavy mineral ratio and <b>varietal</b> data. These <b>changes</b> in sand provenance an be used to produce a detailed stratigraphic breakdown of the sequence and to correlate from well to well. Eleven heavy mineral zones have been recognized on the basis of variations in monazite/zircon, garnet/zircon a d rutile/zircon ratios, on the incoming of chloritoid, and on the composition of garnet populations. The marked changes in provenance result from the proximity of the depositional location to the hinterland and it is considered unlikely that the detailed correlation made in the Snorre Field area applies to Statfjord sandstones in other parts of the northern North Sea.

40|$|A {{study was}} made of the changes from 1965 to 1997 in wheat {{varieties}} grown in selected shires representing farming systems across NSW. The eight shires examined were Wagga, Temora, Cowra, Carrathool, Lachlan, Coonabarabran, Gunnedah and Narrabri. In each shire, approximately 8 - 10 varieties were grown each year. Generally, three of those varieties were grown on a substantial proportion of the area; the minor varieties were either new varieties {{in the process of being}} built up to their peak adoption or older varieties in the stage of being replaced. In southern shires, there has been a tendency to reduce the number of varieties grown, while in the northern shires the number of varieties grown has increased since 1965. The progress of breeders in developing both higher-yielding and higher-quality varieties has been notable over the past 30 years. Wheat yields increased markedly in all shires since 1965, at an average of 2. 2 % per year, with the rates of yield improvement broadly the same in the southern shires as in the north. Of the 2. 2 % per year increase in shire yields since the late 1960 s, 1. 2 % is attributable to <b>varietal</b> <b>change</b> and 1. 0 % per year is due to other factors such as management and agronomic practices. At the same time, the bread-making quality of the varieties grown in NSW has also increased. In some northern shires, where Prime Hard wheats were already being produced in the 1960 s, there has been little change in the overall bread-making quality of the varieties grown. In other shires, especially in the south and central west, there has been rapid growth in the bread-making quality of the varieties grown. Farmers have generally grown the varieties on NSW Agriculture's list of recommended or approved varieties for each region, with an average of 81 % of the area sown to such varieties each year. In addition, most of the varieties grown in each shire have been released by local breeding programs. As well, breeders have brought about a change in the morphological characteristics of the varieties that farmers grow. Over the period since 1965, varieties have generally become shorter, with stronger straw, a lighter coloured grain and more awned. There has also been a significant concentration on mid-maturing varieties since the 1970 s. In summary, wheat growers in NSW have adopted the higher-yielding and higher-quality varieties from a range of breeding programs, while relying strongly on Departmental advice on which varieties to grow. Together these changes have led to substantial benefits for NSW wheat growers. If farmers had continued using varieties with yields similar to those grown in 1965, their income would have been, on average across the eight shires analysed, $ 103 per hectare lower in 1997. However, in some areas, the concentration on a smaller number of varieties in recent years has raised some concerns that the genetic base of the varieties grown is becoming narrow and more vulnerable to pests and diseases.
