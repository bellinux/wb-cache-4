40|$|Abstract: It is {{well known}} that a water jet, which after passing through an air layer plunges into a water pool, entrains into this an {{important}} amount of air and forms a submerged two-phase region of considerable interfacial area. Therefore, oxygen transfer occurs between bubble dispersion and the pool water. Reviewing existing studies on water jets, most of these works were carried out in circular nozzles. Earlier researchers indicated that the factors affecting the air entrainment characteristics of a water jet were nozzle diameter, water jet velocity, jet length, and jet angle. However, it is insufficient to investigate or discuss the characteristics of a water jet only by these four factors. An important factor that cannot be overlooked is the difference in nozzle shape. This paper investigates oxygen transfer efficiencies of vertical plunging water jets from different typed nozzles such as venturi and circular nozzles with and without air holes. A negative pressure occurred at the air holes of the venturi and the circular nozzles and this phenomenon affected the water jet expansion, the water jet shape, the bubble penetration depth and hence the oxygen transfer efficiency. It was demonstrated that the <b>venturi</b> <b>nozzle</b> with air holes had the higher oxygen transfer efficiencies than the other nozzles tested. Thus, using a simple <b>venturi</b> <b>nozzle</b> with air holes could lead to significantly increased oxygen transfer efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Nonuniform {{temperature}} fields in steam cracking furnaces caused by geometry {{factors such as}} burner positions, shadow effects, and asymmetry of the reactor coil layout are detrimental for product yields and run lengths. The techniques of adjusting burner firing (zone firing) and feedstock mass flow rate (pass balancing) have been practiced industrially to mitigate these effects but could only reduce the nonuniformities between the so-called modules (a group of many coils). An extension of the pass balancing methodology is presented to further minimize the intra-module nonuniformities, that is, variation between the coils within a module, in floor fired furnaces. Coupled furnace-reactor computational fluid dynamics-based simulations of an industrial ultraselective conversion (USC) furnace were performed to evaluate four different feedstock flow distribution schemes, realizing equal values for coil outlet temperature, propene/ethene mass ratio, maximum coking rate and maximum tube metal temperature (TMT), respectively, over all the reactor coils. It is shown that feedstock flow distribution creates a larger operating window and extends the run length. Out of the four cases, the coking rate as criterion leads to the highest yearly production capacity for ethene and propene. Uniform maximum coking rates boost the annual production capacity of the USC furnace with a nameplate ethene capacity of 130 103 metric tons per year with 1000 metric tons for ethene and 730 metric tons for propene. For industrial application, achieving uniform maximum TMT is more practical due to its measurability by advanced laser-based techniques.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Mechanical and Nuclear EngineeringMohammad HosniA typical {{refrigeration}} loop {{is composed}} of an evaporator, compressor, condenser, and an expansion valve. There are many possible refrigerants that can be used, but the physical properties of water make it ineffective in the traditional refrigeration loop. But if water could be used it would have many advantages as it is abundant, cheap, and is safe for the environment. This research focuses on {{a different kind of}} refrigeration loop using water. This new refrigeration loop utilizes water flowing through a nozzle, initiating cavitation. Cavitation is generally defined as creating vapor from liquid, not through adding heat, but by decreasing the pressure. In a converging/ diverging nozzle, as the cross sectional area is constricted, the velocity of the flow will increase, decreasing the pressure. Therefore, by flowing water through the nozzle it will cavitate. Transforming liquid into gas requires a certain amount of energy, defined as the latent heat. When a liquid is turned to vapor by an increase in the temperature, the latent heat is provided by the heat transfer to the system. As no energy is being added to the nozzle to cause the cavitation, the energy transfer to create the vapor comes from the remaining liquid, effectively causing a temperature drop. This research focused on the flow visualization of water cavitating as it travelled through a converging/ diverging nozzle. Under different flow conditions and different nozzle geometries, the cavitation manifested itself in different formations. When gasses were entrained in the water they formed bubbles, which acted as nucleation sites as they moved through the nozzle. This was called travelling bubble cavitation. In <b>venturi</b> <b>nozzles</b> the cavitation nucleated off of the wall, forming attached wall cavitation. When water flowed out of an orifice, a turbulent mixture of liquid and vapor, orifice jet, was formed which caused vapor to form around it. This was known as shear cavitation. When the water was rotated prior to the throat of an orifice, the orifice jet expanded radially and formed swirl cavitation. In addition to studying how the cavitation was formed, the void fraction and velocity were measured for attached wall cavitation...|$|R

In this work the possibility of using a device based on a <b>Venturi</b> <b>nozzle</b> for industrial multiphase mass flowrate measurements has been investigated. In case of multiphase systems, the relationship between the overall mass flowrate and the pressure drop in a <b>Venturi</b> <b>nozzle</b> is not unique and includes also the flow quality, so that measurements of quality or holdup have to be included. An experimental facility for the study of any combination of oil, air and water flow has been built and operated. It consists of a vertical perspex pipe of 50 mm internal diameter and about 7 m length. The facility can be operated at atmospheric pressure and at the present makes use of air, water and diesel-fuel oil. The Venturi meter has been tested in air-water and air-oil-water flow; the superficial velocities ranged up to 1. 8 m/s for oil and water and up to 20 m/s for air. Conductance probes, made of two stainless steel rings mounted flush to the pipe wall and placed at different positions in the pipe and in the Venturi throat allowed the measurement of the local liquid holdup for the case of air- water flow. Conventional measurements included pressure drop and absolute pressures.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Previous {{research}} {{has sought to}} adopt the use of drift-reducing technologies (DRTs) for use in field trials to control diamondback moth (DBM) Plutella xylostella (L.) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) in canola (Brassica napus L.). Previous studies observed no difference in canopy penetration from fine to coarse sprays, but the coverage was higher for fine sprays. DBM has a strong propensity to avoid sprayed plant material, putting further pressure on selecting technologies that maximise coverage, but often this is {{at the expense of}} a greater drift potential. This study aims to examine the addition of a DRT oil that is labelled for control of DBM as well and its effect on the drift potential of the spray solution. The objectives of the study are to quantify the droplet size spectrum and spray drift potential of each nozzle type to select technologies that reduce spray drift, to examine the effect of the insecticide tank mix at both (50 and 100 L ha) application rates on droplet size and spray drift potential across tested nozzle type and to compare the droplet size results of each nozzle by tank mix against the drift potential of each nozzle. RESULTS: The nozzle type affected the drift potential the most, but the spray solution also affected drift potential. The fine spray quality (TCP) resulted in the greatest drift potential (7. 2 %), whereas the coarse spray quality (AIXR) resulted in the lowest (1. 3 %), across all spray solutions. The spray solutions mixed at the 100 L ha application volume rate resulted in a higher drift potential than the same products mixed at the 50 L ha mix rate. The addition of the paraffinic DRT oil was significant in reducing the drift potential of Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstkai (Bt) -only treatments across all tested nozzle types. The reduction in drift potential from the fine spray quality to the coarse spray quality was up to 85 %. CONCLUSION: The addition of a DRT oil is an effective way to reduce the spray solution drift potential across all nozzle types and tank mixes evaluated in this study. The greatest reduction in drift potential can be achieved by changing nozzle type, which can reduce the losses of the spray to the surrounding environment. <b>Venturi</b> <b>nozzles</b> greatly reduce the drift potential compared with standard nozzles by as much as 85 % across all three insecticide spray solutions. Results suggest that a significant reduction in drift potential can be achieved by changing the nozzle type, and can be achieved without a loss in control of DBM...|$|R
40|$|A {{versatile}} mobile telerobot, denoted the magnetically attached multifunction maintenance rover (MAGMER), {{has been}} proposed {{for use in the}} inspection and maintenance of the surfaces of ships, tanks containing petrochemicals, and other large ferromagnetic structures. As its name suggests, this robot would utilize magnetic attraction to adhere to a structure. As it moved along the surface of the structure, the MAGMER would perform tasks that could include close-up visual inspection by use of video cameras, various sensors, and/or removal of paint by water-jet blasting, laser heating, or induction heating. The water-jet nozzles would be mounted coaxially within compressed-air-powered <b>venturi</b> <b>nozzles</b> that would collect the paint debris dislodged by the jets. The MAGMER would be deployed, powered, and controlled from a truck, to which it would be connected by hoses for water, compressed air, and collection of debris and by cables for electric power and communication (see Figure 1). The operation of the MAGMER on a typical large structure would necessitate the use of long cables and hoses, which can be heavy. To reduce the load of the hoses and cables on the MAGMER and thereby ensure its ability to adhere to vertical and overhanging surfaces, the hoses and cables would be paid out through telescopic booms that would be parts of a MAGMER support system. The MAGMER would move by use of four motorized, steerable wheels, each of which would be mounted in an assembly that would include permanent magnets and four pole pieces (see Figure 2). The wheels would protrude from between the pole pieces by only about 3 mm, so that the gap between the pole pieces and the ferromagnetic surface would be just large enough to permit motion along the surface but not so large as to reduce the magnetic attraction excessively. In addition to the wheel assemblies, the MAGMER would include magnetic adherence enhancement fixtures, which would comprise arrays of permanent magnets and pole pieces that could be adjusted to maximize or minimize the overall attractive magnetic force. Even with a paint thickness of 2 mm, a preliminary design provides a safety factor of 5 in the magnetic force in the upside- down, water-jets-operating condition, in which the total load (including the weight of the MAGMER and cables and the water-jet force) would be about 260 lb (the weight of 118 kg).

In most industry, the average flow velocity of any fluid is required, as accurate as possible, to obtain flow rate. Devices such as <b>nozzles,</b> <b>venturi</b> tube, etc. {{have been used for}} this purpose. Recently, there has been a velocity-head sensor known as the Annubar primary sensor which measures the average velocity of flow directly. It has been used by some industry due to its simplicity in installation. The present report is an attempt to study the characteristics of the Annubar flow sensor by way of experimentation. As the design of the Annubar employs the same principle as the pitot tube, a state-of-the-art in the measurement of fluid flow by pitot tube and the related pipe flow theory are given...|$|R
