5000|$|Dubbing into {{a foreign}} {{language}} does not always entail the deletion of the original language. In some countries, a performer may read the translated dialogue as a <b>voice-over.</b> <b>This</b> often occurs in Russia and Poland, where [...] "lektories" [...] or [...] "lektors" [...] read the translated dialogue into Russian and Polish. In Poland, one announcer read all text. However, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> done almost exclusively for the television and home video markets, while theatrical releases are usually subtitled. Recently, however, the number of high-quality, fully dubbed films has increased, especially for children's movies. If a quality dubbed version exists for a film, it is shown in theaters. However, some films, such as Harry Potter or Star Wars, are shown in both dubbed and subtitled versions, varying with {{the time of the}} show. Such films are also shown on TV (although some channels drop them and do standard one-narrator translation) and VHS/DVD. In other countries, like Vietnam, the voice-over technique is also used for theatrical releases.|$|R
2500|$|Daniel [...] "Danny" [...] McCoy (Josh Duhamel) is {{initially}} Ed Deline's apprentice, surrogate son, and good friend, who is later promoted to head of security. The series' pilot episode is told largely from his perspective and features Danny doing <b>voice-over</b> narration. <b>This</b> convention <b>was</b> quickly dropped, although he remained the show's main character throughout its five-year run. After Ed's resignation in season three, Danny is made {{vice president of}} operations of the Montecito Resort and Casino for a brief period. However, following Ed's return, Danny is officially reinstated as head of security in season three. He {{was born and raised in}} Las Vegas. Towards the end of season two, his father Larry McCoy (John Terry) dies in an accident and Danny inherits his father's construction company, McCoy Construction, and house. Danny sells his father's house and uses the money to pay for a condo. Danny is a former U.S. Marine, with guerrilla training and counterintelligence training. [...] He is recalled into military service in Iraq at the end of season one. In season two, he is awarded the Silver Star after he calls in an air strike over his unit and himself when they are ambushed and overrun. Only he survives the air strike. [...] He is involved in an on-and-off relationship with Ed Deline's daughter, Delinda, in season one. Danny and Mary have known each other since childhood, and have had a confusing on-and-off relationship. Danny proposes to Mary, but Mary calls off the engagement because she feels that Danny had a lot of things to sort out for himself. He ultimately begins living with his girlfriend, Delinda, who is pregnant with their first child.|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} alterity is always related to identity, {{and based on}} ones self-perception: the Self {{influences}} what we perceive as the Other. Following this idea, the present article explores the hidden Self of French cultural identity in French newsreels, Les Actualités Françaises, from 1968. It examines the construction and representation of alterity in the {{news coverage of the}} Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. s assassination, and, consequently, what that reveals about French national self-perception. <b>This</b> event <b>is</b> notable for two reasons: first, Dr. Kings death is an event of extraordinary international importance; second, the news coverage not only presents alterity, but also the handling of alterity by another culture. Therefore, in this example, the concept of alterity operates on multiple levels. The objective of <b>this</b> article <b>is</b> to analyze the interaction of image, music, text, and <b>voice-over</b> in <b>this</b> newsreel; the newsreels effect on the French viewers; and the French national self-perception that is mirrored in the newsreels representation. The argument will show that deep-rooted French values, existing since the French Revolution, have a strong influence on the perception and evaluation of the events in the US, and therefore on the handling of otherness...|$|R
40|$|Many of Sokurov’s films, {{features}} {{as well as}} documentaries, are characterised by scant or subdued dialogue and/or <b>voice-over</b> narration. <b>This</b> aesthetic style of the predominance of visual over verbal expression is understood as a direct expression of Sokurov’s concern with mortality and death. The argument proceeds from a semiotic distinction between language as basically discrete and moving pictures as basically indiscrete. By subduing the discrete semantics of language, Sokurov gives precedence to the potential of moving images to pursue the indiscrete flow of human life as it moves inevitably towards the moment of death, to the vanishing point of human existence. Six films are examined: The Lonely Voice of Man (Odinokij golos čeloveka); Whispering Pages (Tichie stranicy) and Spiritual Voices (Duchovnye golosa); Moloch, Taurus (Telec) and The Sun.

50|$|The opening {{cinematic}} {{takes place}} in a gritty, war-torn future depicting a final battle between the world's greatest heroes and villains. A future version of Lex Luthor provides <b>voice-over</b> narration. <b>This</b> battle {{takes place in}} the ruins of Metropolis. Lex Luthor, wearing a heavy mech armor, commands an army of super-villains that includes Joker, Harley Quinn, Circe, Deathstroke, Black Adam, Giganta and Metallo. A scarred, armored Batman commands the heroes, which includes Robin, Cyborg, Flash, Green Lantern, and Wonder Woman. The battle culminates with the death of Wonder Woman at the hands of Lex Luthor, at which point an unshaven, weary Superman hears her dying screams from orbit and flies to Earth to confront Lex. As Superman cradles Wonder Woman's dead body, he collapses to the ground and it is revealed that Lex hid Kryptonite pellets in her mouth as a trap. Lex impales Superman with a kryptonite-tipped spear, and stands back to proclaim his victory only to see Brainiac's war fleet fill the skies.|$|R
2500|$|A prologue {{was added}} to the {{beginning}} of all the fourth-series episodes for the American transmissions. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> to clarify some initial confusion audiences had regarding the characters and their mission. In the opener, a waiter holding a champagne bottle falls dead onto a human-sized chessboard; a dagger protruding from a target on his back. Steed and Mrs. Peel (dressed in her trademark leather catsuit) walk up to the body as the voice-over explains: [...] "Extraordinary crimes against the people, and the state, have to be avenged by agents extraordinary. Two such people are John Steed, top professional, and his partner Emma Peel, talented amateur. Otherwise known as The Avengers." [...] During <b>this</b> <b>voice-over,</b> Steed pours two drinks from the wine bottle and Mrs Peel replaces her gun in her boot. They clink glasses and depart together.

40|$|Student Number : 8238599 - MA {{dissertation}} - School of Social Sciences - Faculty of HumanitiesThe {{story of}} the Jewish community in South Africa is a long and colourful one. The population is based entirely on immigrants who first began arriving in the late 1860 s. Their presence {{in the country is}} characterised by a disproportionate visibility and as being distinct from other “Diaspora” communities. The community has shrunk by a third in the last thirty years, in a mirror image of the initial waves of immigrants to the country a century before. This sense of movement spanning {{a long period of time}} in the context of the historical phenomenon that is South African Jewry suggests itself to a documentary film. A cinematic treatment of the phenomenon of waves of Jewish immigration to and from South Africa requires approaching the subject matter from a number of directions simultaneously. The film genre “historical documentary” requires equal emphasis on the techniques of cinema as well as an historical approach. This document addresses each in turn, with Section 1 dealing with the historical framework underlying the film. Section 2 addresses the theory and practice of documentary film inasmuch as it pertains to the proposed film. This section also contains a review of existing film documentary approaches to the subject matter. Section 3 contains a scene by scene breakdown of the film. The appendix contains a literature review and supplemental notes. Overall Aim The starting point for the construction of the film is an attempt to develop an approach that deliberately eschews the conventional documentary technique used in the making of similar films. By ignoring the fact that film is a predominantly visual medium, films often fall into a trap of “over-textualising” i. e. their visual or metaphorical essence becomes subordinate to the text of the film. Since the text drives the narrative, this can result in a sapping of visual interest in favour of what is often a tedious <b>voice-over.</b> <b>This</b> film wishes to take advantage of film as a rich visual and symbolic medium. I aim to show that this approach need not lead to a loss of overall transmitted content, historical or otherwise. The maxim “less is more”, though seemingly cliché, applies in large part to the making of a historical documentary...|$|R

5000|$|On November 30, 2006, it was {{reported}} that George Clooney was set to star in a newly green-lit film adaptation of the novel for Warner Independent Pictures. Clooney was also on board as producer along with his Smoke House partner Grant Heslov. The film was to be written by Matthew Michael Carnahan and directed by his brother Joe Carnahan. Both Jason Bateman and Peter Berg had signed on to appear in the film. The script changes the Armenian Kafesjian family in the novel to the Mexican Magdalena family. Joe Carnahan said this of his brother's script, [...] "It’s, to me, what that book always was - the point of departure from the Eisenhower '50s to the psychedelic freakshow, Manson '60s. It’s a total combination of the two with a heavy, heavy <b>voice-over</b> narration, <b>this</b> kind of classic noir." [...] Carnahan had also confirmed that the characters of Ed Exley and Dudley Smith would not be in the film version despite their presence in the book, as Regency Productions has its own plans for a sequel to L.A. Confidential and asked the director to remove Exley from his screenplay as they own the rights to the character. Instead, the Carnahans had constructed a [...] "doppelganger" [...] for Exley, [...] "giving him all of his traits and speech patterns." ...|$|R
40|$|Within the {{relatively}} {{new field of}} audiovisual translation studies, voice-over has been given very little attention and very little credit, even in Poland, where it is used extensively in TV translation of motion pictures. Similarly, the science-fiction film genre – especially its television form – is usually treated with some contempt and considered not worthy of serious research, except for sociological reasons. The two main issues discussed in this paper are: firstly, the ontological status of the s-f film, the specificity and function of its language and the general problems of its translation; secondly, the weaknesses and strengths of Polish voice-over practice, illustrated by the analysis of various Star Trek translations and compared with its dubbed and subtitled versions. The examination of the film material leads to the conclusion that, {{in spite of the}} negative evaluation of <b>voice-over</b> by scholars, <b>this</b> translation practice has some potential. If fully exploited, it could offer a valid alternative to dubbing and subtitling techniques...|$|R
5000|$|The {{song was}} {{released}} under three titles: [...] "I'm Easy", [...] "I'm Easy (Cooler Version)", and [...] "Easy". The title varies {{depending upon the}} region of release {{or whether it was}} the single or part of the album Angel Dust. As a single, in most countries apart from the United States, Australia and Japan, releases had the title [...] "I'm Easy". In the aforementioned countries, the title was simply [...] "Easy" [...] with the German special edition using [...] "I'm Easy (Cooler Version)". There are at least two different mixes in circulation, all of which originate from the same studio recording of the song. The first mix has a voice-over by Mike Patton during the first few seconds of the song: [...] "Turn the lights out, baby. This one's for the ladies in the house". It also has fewer guitar overdubs, a slightly different bass line before the guitar solo, and more reverb on the entire track. The second version, sometimes listed as the [...] "Cooler Version" [...] as titled on the German special edition of the single, lacks <b>this</b> <b>voice-over</b> but features a background string-synth arrangement throughout the song as well as the [...] "missing" [...] guitar parts not found in the other mix.|$|R
