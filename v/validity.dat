40|$|Research {{into the}} dynamicity of job {{performance}} criteria has found evidence suggesting {{the presence of}} rank-order changes to job performance scores across {{time as well as}} intraindividual trajectories in job performance scores across time. These findings have influenced a large body of research into (a) the dynamicity of <b>validities</b> of individual differences predictors of job performance and (b) the relationship between individual differences predictors of job performance and intraindividual trajectories of job performance. In the present dissertation, I addressed these issues {{within the context of the}} Five Factor Model of personality. The Five Factor Model is arranged hierarchically, with five broad higher-order factors subsuming a number of more narrowly tailored personality facets. Research has debated the relative merits of broad versus narrow traits for predicting job performance, but the entire body of research has addressed the issue from a static perspective [...] by examining the relative magnitude of <b>validities</b> of global factors versus their facets. While research along these lines has been enlightening, theoretical perspectives suggest that the <b>validities</b> of global factors versus their facets may differ in their stability across time. Thus, research is needed to not only compare the relative magnitude of <b>validities</b> of global factors versus their facets at a single point in time, but also to compare the relative stability of <b>validities</b> of global factors versus their facets across time. Also necessary to advance cumulative knowledge concerning intraindividual performance trajectories is research into broad vs. narrow traits for predicting such trajectories. In the present dissertation, I addressed these issues using a four-year longitudinal design. The results indicated that the <b>validities</b> of global conscientiousness were stable across time, while the <b>validities</b> of conscientiousness facets were more likely to fluctuate. However, the <b>validities</b> of emotional stability and extraversion facets were no more likely to fluctuate across time than those of the factors. Finally, while some personality factors and facets predicted performance intercepts (i. e., performance at the first measurement occasion), my results failed to indicate a significant effect of any personality variable on performance growth. Implications for research and practice are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{approaches}} to detecting {{the presence of}} moderators in meta-analyses involve inferences drawn from the residual variance in criterion-related <b>validities</b> (a) after correctingfor sampling error and statistical artifacts. James, Demaree, Mulaik, and Ladd (1992) argued that these residualized interpretations of meta-analytic results may be spurious when statistical artifacts covary with true moderators. We extend their model to suggest that situational moderators might also covary with sample size and content (i. e., nonrandom sample selection error), causing meta-analysis to be uninterpretable and a significant correlation between criterion-related <b>validities</b> and ni. We investigate this possibility on studies examining criterion-related <b>validities</b> ofpeer nominations originally reported by Kane and Lawler (1978). Application of residualized meta-analysis suggests the presence of moderator effects, but a significant correlation between ri and ni precludes interpretation of the moderator process behind these effects...|$|R

40|$|One {{challenge}} {{that has to}} be addressed by the fast and frugal heuristics program is how people manage to select, from the abundance of cues that exist in the environment, those to rely on when making decisions. We hypothesize that causal knowledge helps people target particular cues and estimate their <b>validities.</b> This hypothesis was tested in three experiments. Results show that when causal information about some cues was available (Experiment 1), participants preferred to search for these cues first and to base their decisions on them. When allowed to learn cue <b>validities</b> in addition to causal information (Experiment 2), participants also became more frugal (i. e., they searched fewer of the available cues), made more accurate decisions, and were more precise in estimating cue <b>validities</b> than was a control group that did not receive causal information. These results {{can be attributed to the}} causal relation between the cues and the criterion, rather than to greater saliency of the causal cues (Experiment 3). Overall, our results support the hypothesis that causal knowledge aids in the learning of cue <b>validities</b> and is treated as a meta-cue for identifying highly valid cues...|$|R

The definition can be extended, however, to sentences in first-order logic (see Enderton (2002, p. 114) and Kleene (1967 secs. 17-18)). These sentences may contain quantifiers, unlike sentences of propositional logic. In the context of first-order logic, a distinction is maintained between logical <b>validities,</b> sentences that are true in every model, and tautologies, which are a proper subset of the first-order logical <b>validities.</b> In the context of propositional logic, these two terms coincide.|$|R

40|$|The {{notion of}} {{ecological}} rationality {{implies that the}} accuracy of a decision strategy depends on features of the information environment {{in which it is}} tested. We demonstrate that the performance of a group may be strongly affected by the decision strategies used by its individual members and specify how this effect is moderated by environmental features. Specifically, in a set of simulation studies, we systematically compared four decision strategies used by the individual group members: two linear, compensatory decision strategies and two simple, noncompensatory heuristics. Individual decisions were aggregated by using a majority rule. To assess the ecological rationality of the strategies, we varied (a) the distribution of cue <b>validities,</b> (b) the quantity, and (c) the quality of shared information. Group performance strongly depended on the distribution of cue <b>validities.</b> When <b>validities</b> were linearly distributed, groups using a compensatory strategy achieved the highest accuracy. Conversely, when cue <b>validities</b> followed a J-shaped distribution, groups using a simple lexicographic heuristic performed best. While these effects were robust across different quantities of shared information, the quality of shared information exerted stronger effects on group performance.

40|$|When {{probabilistic}} inferences have to {{be drawn}} based on cue values stored in long term memory, participants appear to use {{a number of different}} heuristics. These heuristics vary in the amount of available cue information that is retrieved and integrated, and in the degree to which cue <b>validities</b> are considered. One factor that is assumed to affect strategy selection is the representational format of cue information: Holistic, image-based representations should induce the parallel retrieval of cue values and thus foster the use of compensatory strategies that take into account multiple cue dimensions. In contrast, verbal representations should favor non-compensatory strategies that draw inferences based on a single cue dimension. We tested this hypothesis in an experiment and explored how the learning procedure modulates the use of cue <b>validities.</b> The results suggest that the acquisition of cue knowledge from holistic images increases the use of a compensatory prototype matching strategy that neglects cue <b>validities.</b> Keywords: Multi-attribute decision making, Probabilistic inference, Bounded rationality, Take-the-best heuristic...|$|R

25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} forms of <b>validity.</b> Criterion-related <b>validity</b> can be assessed by correlating a measure with a criterion measure theoretically expected to be related.
