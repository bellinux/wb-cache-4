5|$|A typical {{structure}} {{would have}} {{four or more}} central posts planted {{in the ground and}} connected at the top by cross beams. The smoke hole would be left open in the center. Around the central structure there was a larger ring of shorter posts, also connected by cross beams. Rafters radiated from the central cross beams to the outside cross beams, and then split planks or beams formed the slanting or <b>vertical</b> <b>side</b> walls.|$|E
500|$|The {{location}} of the star's five points is determined by an imaginary disk centered on the star's center, its diameter equal to roughly 15% {{the length of the}} flag. The points of the star are equidistant from each other, and one of the points is located on the horizontal median of the flag {{to the left of the}} center of the imaginary disk. The star is surrounded on its left by a red crescent made by the intersection of two arcs, an outer arc whose diameter is equal to one-fourth of the length of the flag, and an internal arc with a diameter equal to one-fifth of the flag's length. In addition, at the top of the flag used by the President of the Republic, the words [...] "for the nation" [...] (...) are written in gold. The three outer edges of the flag are lined with golden yellow fringe and a red ribbon, with golden fringe on the right <b>vertical</b> <b>side</b> and a white disk with a star and crescent near the fringe, is attached to the flag pole above the flag.|$|E

40|$|A tank {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} on a 1 / 8 -size powered dynamic model of the Grumman JRF- 5 airplane equipped with twin hydro-skis. The results of tests using two types of skis are presented: one had <b>vertical</b> <b>sides</b> joining the top surface to the chine; the other had the top surface faired to the chine to eliminate the <b>vertical</b> <b>sides.</b> Both configurations had satisfactory longitudinal stability although the model had a slightly greater stable elevator range available when the skis without the <b>vertical</b> <b>sides</b> were attached. Free model tests indicated no instability present when one ski emerged before the other. Considerable excess thrust was available at all speeds with either type of skis. A hump gross load-resistance ratio of 3. 37 was obtained with the skis with the <b>vertical</b> <b>sides</b> and 3. 53 with the other skis. Landing behavior in smooth water with yaw up to 15 deg and roll up to 15 deg in opposite directions was satisfactory with either type of skis...|$|R

2500|$|The Castelgrande hill {{includes}} a nearly <b>vertical</b> <b>side</b> {{on the north}} and a steep southern side, but is nearly flat and 150-200m in diameter. [...] The natural shape of the hill has encouraged every man-made fortification to follow the same contours. [...] While the Roman fort is not visible the Roman foundations were used by the High Middle Ages castle which followed. [...] Of the High Middle Ages castle the only visible parts are {{a few pieces of}} wall that are still standing. [...] Much of the visible castle dates from 1250–1500 with extensive renovations and some expansion in the last two centuries. [...] Most of the area inside the castle walls is now flat, open space.|$|E

2500|$|In side profile, turret deck ships resembled other {{merchant}} vessels with flush decks or {{with small}} forecastles and poop decks. In cross-section {{the differences between}} turret deck vessels and more conventional ships are apparent. There was no gunwale; the <b>vertical</b> <b>side</b> of a turret ship curves inward above the load line to a horizontal plane. This flat area {{was known as the}} harbour deck. Further inboard, this [...] "deck" [...] arced to the vertical again by a reverse curve. That vertical plane then joined the weather deck atop the turret at a right angle. Structurally these elements were part of the hull, not of the superstructure, and the cargo holds of the ship extended up to the true weather deck atop the turret.|$|E

2500|$|Historically, the Lancaster County covered bridges {{were painted}} with red sides and all-white portals. [...] Today {{most of the}} bridges retain this pattern, however, some of the portals are painted red with white trim (such as on the Zook's Mill Covered Bridge) or all-red (such as on the Pool Forge Covered Bridge). [...] A number of these bridges also have the side panels painted red {{on the inside of}} the bridge while leaving the trusses unpainted. [...] The Keller's Mill Covered Bridge is painted all-white, the only one of its kind in the county. [...] Three of the bridges, Buck Hill Covered Bridge, Schenck's Mill Covered Bridge, and Shearer's Covered Bridge, have {{horizontal}} side boards. [...] The rest of the bridges have <b>vertical</b> <b>side</b> boards.|$|E
2500|$|In 1954 Buick Roadmaster and Super {{shared with}} Cadillac and Oldsmobile 98 the new General Motors C-body, {{adopting}} the new [...] "ponton" [...] appearance, {{and the addition}} of [...] "Dagmar bumpers" [...] to the front. These were large, roomy cars, as much as five and a half inches longer in wheelbase and more than nine inches (229mm) [...] longer overall than in 1953. Roadmaster script was found on the rear quarters and within the deck ornament. Rear fenders had a blunted fin at the rear edge, with dual [...] "bullet" [...] taillamps below. A new panoramic windshield with <b>vertical</b> <b>side</b> pillars was used. Seats had chrome bands on 2-door models and rear seats had an armrest on 4-door models. The front suspension was refined and Roadmaster's horsepower was increased to 200. The pillared coupe and the Estate wagon were no longer offered as body styles. Overall sales dropped to 50,600.|$|E
2500|$|Streamliners {{used the}} larger B-body and, {{except for the}} station wagons, used {{fastback}} styling. The 1941 Super models with folding center armrest were known as Chieftains in 1942. All Pontiacs looked lower, heavier and wider. Extension caps on the front doors lengthened the forward fender lines. The hood extended {{back to the front}} doors, eliminating the cowl. The grille, bumper and hood were widened and headlamps were further apart. Long horizontal parking lamps sat just above the <b>vertical</b> <b>side</b> grilles. The horseshoe shaped center grille had horizontal bars and a circular emblem {{in the middle of the}} upper main surround molding. The word Pontiac appeared on the hood side molding of six-cylinder models, while the moldings of the eight-cylinder cars said Pontiac Eight. After December 15, 1941, wartime [...] "blackout" [...] trim was used. All parts previously chrome plated were finished in Duco Gun Metal Grey.|$|E
