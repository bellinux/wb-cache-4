40|$|The growing {{interest}} {{in the management of}} <b>voluntary</b> <b>organizations</b> is an important development. Management theorists and others argue that <b>voluntary</b> <b>organizations</b> are poorly managed and that improved management will help to resolve some of their basic problems. A notable aspect of their position is the recent rapid shift of attention from micro-organizational issues (e. g., selection, motivation, leadership styles) to the managerially much more significant macro issues of planning, policy, and strategy. Wortman (1981) has focused this shift by calling for, and predicting, the adoption of strategic management by <b>voluntary</b> <b>organizations.</b> As Wortman (1981) suggests, such a shift would involve a &dquo;radical&dquo; re-orientation of the operation of <b>voluntary</b> <b>organizations.</b> Given the paucity of theory and research on strategic management in <b>voluntary</b> <b>organizations,</b> Wortman (1979 : 327) earlier suggested that examination of the strategic management concept for <b>voluntary</b> <b>organizations</b> &dquo;should start at the beginning with simple conceptual and theoretical papers&dquo; which suggest directions for research.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{innovative}} capacity of <b>voluntary</b> <b>organizations</b> {{in the field}} of the personal social services. It commences with a full literature review, which concludes that the wealth of research upon innovation in the organization studies field has not addressed this topic, whilst the specialist literatures upon <b>voluntary</b> <b>organizations</b> and upon the personal social services have neglected the study of innovation. The research contained in this thesis is intended to right this neglect and to integrate lessons from both fields. It combines a survey of the innovative activity of <b>voluntary</b> <b>organizations</b> in three localities with cross-sectional case studies of innovative, developmental and traditional organizations. The research concludes that innovation is an important, but not integral, characteristic of <b>voluntary</b> <b>organizations.</b> It develops a contingent model of this innovative capacity of <b>voluntary</b> <b>organizations,</b> which stresses the role of external environmental and institutional forces in shaping and releasing this capacity. It concludes by considering the contribution of this model both to organization studies and to the study of <b>voluntary</b> <b>organizations...</b>|$|R

25|$|The Program {{received}} a mixed reception {{both within the}} Church and outside it. The National Catholic War Council was a <b>voluntary</b> <b>organization</b> with no canonical status.

Many bishops threw their support behind the Program, but some, including Bishop William Turner of Buffalo and William Henry O'Connell of Boston, opposed it. O'Connell believed {{some aspects of the}} plan smacked too much of socialism. Response outside the Church was also divided: labor organizations backed it, for example, and business groups criticized it.|$|E

The systems for dissemination of information and the evacuation of inhabitants, and countermeasures of the <b>voluntary</b> <b>organizations</b> for disaster prevention are discussed. The new systems for dissemination of information and the evacuation of inhabitants are rated high by the <b>voluntary</b> <b>organizations</b> for disaster prevention.

40|$|Recent {{governmental}} {{responses to}} domestic disasters {{have emphasized the}} important role played by a sometimes extensive network of decentralized, <b>voluntary</b> <b>organizations</b> in emergency response. While we {{are just beginning to}} grasp the extent to which volunteers and <b>voluntary</b> <b>organizations</b> react to disasters in concert with local governments, we still understand very little about how local governments proactively plan to work with these private organizations. This article uses a national survey of county-level emergency planning agencies to describe the role of <b>voluntary</b> <b>organizations</b> in local disaster planning. Network and collaborative theories provide frameworks for understanding the role of joint planning, volunteers and other resources in predicting emergency preparedness. Findings of note include the strong contributions made by private <b>voluntary</b> <b>organizations</b> to perceptions of government managers that their counties are prepared for emergencies and disasters.

25|$|In Canada, {{there came}} into being {{the idea of a}} select corps of teenaged youths, who would devote some of their spare time to prepare for the day when they would take their places in the ranks of the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). In 1940, Air Minister Power, who was very much aware of the need for this type of Air Cadet training, called in a group of {{influential}} civilians and asked them to set up a national <b>voluntary</b> <b>organization</b> to sponsor and develop this movement. The response was immediate, and a civilian organization was soon created to work on a partnership basis with the RCAF. As it later developed, this partnership was to be the main reason for the striking success of the Air Cadet Movement in Canada.|$|E

[...] Judge Juan Guerrero Burciaga of New Mexico was then appointed to hear the case. [...] During the trial, the NCAA claimed {{that it was a}} <b>voluntary</b> <b>organization</b> and if the plaintiffs or other schools did not wish to abide by the NCAA rules, they were free to terminate their membership. [...] It was shown that the amount of money paid by ABC to teams appearing on television was established by Thomas C. Hansen, the NCAA Television Program Director. [...] Universities were not allowed to negotiate their own terms. Burciaga pointed out an example of the control and price fixing by noting that in 1981, Oklahoma and the University of Southern California (both then ranked in the top 5 of the AP Poll and the Coaches' Poll) appeared on 200 stations in a regional broadcast.

2500|$|The {{field of}} health {{advocacy}} also has deeper {{roots in the}} <b>voluntary</b> <b>organization</b> sector of society, where the early health advocates were more typically advocating for a cause, not for an individual. [...] These health advocates preceded hospital-based patient advocates and {{are part of a}} long history of American involvement in social organizations. [...] They were activists in social movements and voluntary associations including civic organizations, women's associations and labor organizations, and in the early disease-specific non-profits like the American Cancer Society (founded as the American Society for the Control of Cancer in 1913) or the March of Dimes (founded as the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis in 1938). [...] In {{the early part of the}} 20th century these advocates came to their work through other professional routes, often as social workers, attorneys, public health nurses or doctors. [...] They were the Progressive era [...] "new women" [...] of Hull House and the Children's Bureau, the American Association for Labor Legislation leaders of the movement in 1919 for national health insurance, the nurses who worked with Lillian Wald to advocate for indigent health care through Visiting Nurse Services (1893), or with the Maternity Center Association (1918) to advocate for maternal and infant care for poor immigrants. [...] They obtained their professional education in other disciplines and then applied it to health.|$|E
60|$|What, then, {{is to be}} done? For the present, unfortunately, little except {{propagating}} {{the conception}} of Children's Rights. Only the achievement of economic equality through Socialism can {{make it possible to}} deal thoroughly with the question {{from the point of view}} of the total interest of the community, which must always consist of grown-up children. Yet economic equality, like all simple and obvious arrangements, seems impossible to people brought up as children are now. Still, something can be done even within class limits. Large communities of children of the same class are possible today; and <b>voluntary</b> <b>organization</b> of outdoor life for children has already begun in Boy Scouting and excursions of one kind or another. The discovery that anything, even school life, is better for the child than home life, will become an over-ridden hobby; and we shall presently be told by our faddists that anything, even camp life, is better than school life. Some blundering beginnings of this are already perceptible. There is a movement for making our British children into priggish little barefooted vagabonds, all talking like that born fool George Borrow, and supposed to be splendidly healthy because they would die if they slept in rooms with the windows shut, or perhaps even with a roof over their heads. Still, this is a fairly healthy folly; and it may do something to establish Mr Harold Cox's claim of a Right to Roam as the basis of a much needed law compelling proprietors of land to provide plenty of gates in their fences, and to leave them unlocked when there are no growing crops to be damaged nor bulls to be encountered, instead of, as at present, imprisoning the human race in dusty or muddy thoroughfares between walls of barbed wire.|$|E
