25|$|Allen {{wrote the}} novel Just Tell Me What You Want! in 1969, {{with the idea}} of turning it into a screenplay. After having trouble getting {{together}} a production, Allen sent it to Sidney Lumet, who surprisingly wanted to do it. In her opinion, Lumet was a wonderful structuralist but has his most difficult time with humorous dialogue; he hadn't found a way to shoot humorous dialogue as brilliantly as he shot everything else. Some of the humor was lost in Just Tell Me What You Want when Sidney gave the <b>voice-over</b> <b>to</b> Ali MacGraw instead of Myrna Loy as was originally intended. But the collaboration worked wonderfully; unbeknownst to each other they both had wanted to cast Alan King. This synchronicity in casting preference continued with all three Lumet/Allen movies.|$|E
500|$|Kubrick {{originally}} planned a <b>voice-over</b> <b>to</b> {{reveal that the}} satellites seen after the prologue are nuclear weapons, and that the Star Child would detonate the weapons {{at the end of}} the film. However, he decided this would create associations with his previous film Dr. Strangelove, and decided not to make it so obvious that they were [...] "war machines". A few weeks before the release of the film, the U.S. and Soviet governments had agreed not to put any nuclear weapons into outer space.|$|E

500|$|Hawley's {{first thought}} when [...] "looking at the genre {{is if we}} remove the genre, is there a {{compelling}} show {{you want to watch}} there?" [...] He decided to center the series on the [...] "idea of this epic love story and then putting the genre back into it" [...] and layering elements such as mental illness and special abilities on that foundation Hawley's initial script for Legion was described by Donner as [...] "less fractured", [...] "cohesive [...] much more regular." [...] However, he quickly reconceived the series [...] "and decided more Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Terrence Malick, more whimsy, more impressionistic and went in that direction." [...] This was in part due to Hawley's desire to depict a [...] "more existential exploration" [...] and a [...] "surreal or dreamlike quality where it's not just about running and kicking." [...] He was inspired by the works of David Lynch to have the series' structure reflect the content of the story. Explaining, Hawley noted that the series' protagonist [...] "doesn't know what's real and what’s not real, [...] the audience should have the same experience". Hawley added that [...] "there is this Alice in Wonderland quality to it, of a story within a story." [...] To acclimatize audiences to the different style of the series, taking into consideration that the show was given a late airtime and so [...] "it’s on {{at the end of their}} very long day", Hawley had several of the early episodes begin with a [...] "hypnotic quality ... often [...] a little ethereal <b>voice-over,</b> <b>to</b> give the sense that we are not rooted in a physical time and place." [...] The intent was to put audiences [...] "in the state of mind to watch Legion." ...|$|E
2500|$|The film's {{character}} designer David Krentz said, [...] "Although {{the production}} veered {{away from being}} very realistic, the animation still plays independently. The powers that be decided to add narration and <b>voice-over</b> <b>to</b> reach a wider audience and the characters became slightly anthropomorphized {{to make them more}} attractive to younger kids." [...] Palaeontologist Steve Brusatte responded to The Scotsmans prompt about the [...] "danger of anthropomorphising" [...] the dinosaurs, [...] "The voiceovers are a bit of a compromise; the dinosaurs' lips aren't moving, they are not smiling and having human-like facial expressions or anything like that... They are only anthropomorphised to a small degree and that is necessary for a film like this." ...|$|E
2500|$|Zach Braff portrays John Michael [...] "J.D." [...] Dorian (seasons 1–9), the show's protagonist and narrator. J.D. {{is a young}} {{attending}} physician, who {{begins the}} series as a staff intern. His <b>voice-over</b> <b>to</b> the series comes from his internal thoughts and often features surreal fantasies. J.D. {{describes himself as a}} [...] "sensi", enjoying acoustic alternative music and being a lover of hugs.

These films were tele-cined at Bournemouth Film School and copied to VHS tapes. Steve Wade (director), Phil Wade, his son (sound), and Steve Wagstaff (camera) with Brian Mathews (production manager), shot new links in the shed.

5000|$|... "Mad Toy" [...] {{was adapted}} for cinema twice: by José María Paolantonio in 1984 and by Javier Torre in 1998.
