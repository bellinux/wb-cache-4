The vehicle was ultimately targeted to contain a velocity-field measurement system in underwater conditions, which should confirm stationary buoyancy during measurement.

40|$|A novel sling {{design for}} the support of {{horizontal}} pressure vessels is modelled by finite element methods. Each component is initially considered some distance apart and then brought together by using three-dimensional contact surfaces. Thereafter, external loads, such as self-weight, liquid fill and internal surcharge pressure, are applied to the combined model. Several numerical difficulties arising because of the different flexibilities of the <b>vessel</b> <b>shell</b> and the sling support, which has the form of a cloth material, are overcome. The vessel strains and contact interface pressures are evaluated and plotted and show good agreement with experimental work. The magnitude of the strains at the location of the traditional saddle horn is significantly reduced.

40|$|As part of {{the first}} stage of an Australian Welding Research Association {{co-operative}} research project, acoustic emission monitoring has been applied to a steam receiver vessel withdrawn from service owing to severe weld cracking. This technique is used to check acceptance standards for defects in nozzle welds and to apply modern methods of assessing the integrity of pressurised plant. Acoustic emission monitoring has been used, together with strain gauge measurements and ultrasonic scanning, to detect the occurrence of any significant defect growth during cyclic pressurisation of the vessel. During this first stage, no significant defect growth has been produced by 1000 cycles of pressure up to 24. 1 MPa (3500 psi), subsequent pressurisation up to 35. 8 MPa (5200 psi), or 97 per cent of the expected yield stress of the <b>vessel</b> <b>shell.</b> The small amount of acoustic emission detected was consistent with this result...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} heat {{recovery}} from pressurized entrained and fixed bed coal gasifiers for steam generation. High temperature waste heat, from slagging entrained flow coal gasifier, can be recovered effectively {{in a series}} of radiant and convection waste heat boilers.

An economic analysis for the steam generation and process heat exchanger is presented.

Low level heat recovered by process heat exchangers is used to heat product gas or support the energy requirement of the gasification plant.

40|$|A {{specific}} process of manufacturing of <b>vessel</b> <b>shell</b> tabs, namely {{the method of}} cold stamping is studied in this paper. Recommendations are proposed to gain the proper technology of manufacturing spherical vessels with a volume above 600 cubic meters with regard to labor saving of tabs stamping on hydraulic press. The necessity of having proper technology of stamping is motivated by the large quantity of manual operations, having a direct influence on the conversion costs of a spherical vessel as a whole. The importance {{of this research is}} connected with the necessity of multiple shape control of tabs being manufactured during stamping and time-consuming point-by-point shaping-up. The reduction of material costs is supported by using finite-element simulation. Problems are solved with specific modules of the computer aided engineering-system ABAQUS.

40|$|Welds, " dated November 12, 1999. The {{purpose of}} this letter is to provide {{supplemental}} information regarding the BWRVIP analyses of BWR reactor pressure <b>vessel</b> axial <b>shell</b> welds. The letter referenced above provided a BWRVIP response to NRC comments on analyses of BWR reactor pressure <b>vessel</b> axial <b>shell</b> welds. The analyses provided to the NRC in the referenced letter utilized vessel material data available to the BWRVIP from industry databases. However, while the values utilized by the BWRVIP in initially preparing our submittal were conservative, we have concluded that in one case the analysis is too conservative. For example, the analysis performed {{for one of the}} plants utilized an initial RT 1,yrr value of 0 *F. The NRC reactor vessel integrity database (RVID) contains a value of initial RTNryr for that plant of- 48 *F. Therefore, the BWRVIP analysis using 00 F is conservative relative to the RVID value of- 480 F. Use of the RVID value will result in a more realistic analysis and is more appropriate for use in the probabilistic fracture mechanics analysis for predicting BWR reactor <b>vessel</b> axial <b>shell</b> weld failure probability.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effects of}} neutron {{irradiation}} on the steel reactor vessel for the modular high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (MHTGR) are being investigated, primarily because the operating temperatures are low [121 to 288 °C (250 - 550 °F) ] {{compared to those}} for commercial light-water reactors (LWRs) [~ 288 °C (550 °F) ]. The need for design data on the reference temperature (RTNDT) shift necessitated the irradiation at different temperatures of A 533 grade B class 1 plates, A 508 class 3 forging, and welds used for the <b>vessel</b> <b>shell,</b> vessel closure head, and vessel flange. This paper presents regular- and mini-tensile, Automated Ball Indentation (ABI) and Charpy V-notch (CVN) impact test results from five irradiation capsules of this program. The first four capsules were irradiated in the University of Buffalo Reactor (UBR) to an effective fast fluence of 1. 1 × 1018 neutrons/cm 2 [0. 7 × 1018 neutrons/cm 2 (> 1 MeV) ] at temperatures of 288, 204...|$|E

Each vessel "time to failure" calculated by this approach for the specific fire scenario of concern was compared to a reference time required for effective mitigation actions and related to the escalation probability. The failure probability of each vessel was correlated to the probability of scenarios involving multiple vessel failure {{as a consequence of the}} primary fire, thus allowing a comprehensive assessment of domino scenarios triggered by fire. The application of the methodology to the analysis of several case-studies allowed the estimation of the quantitative contribution of escalation events triggered by fire to the overall individual and societal risk indexes. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
