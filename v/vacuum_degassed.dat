50|$|RTV {{silicone}} rubbers are, however, generally expensive--especially platinum-cure. They {{are also}} sensitive to substances (sulfur-containing modelling clay such as Plastilina, for example) that may prevent the silicone from curing (referred to as cure inhibition). Silicones are usually very thick (high viscosity), {{and must be}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>degassed</b> prior to pouring, to minimize bubble entrapment. If making a brush-on rubber mold, the curing time factor between coats is long (longer than urethanes or polysulfides, shorter than latex). Silicone components (A+B) must be mixed accurately by weight (scale required) or they do not work. Tin catalyst silicones shrink somewhat, {{and do not have}} a long shelf life. Certain types of RTV release acetic acid during the curing process, and this can attack solder joints, causing the solder to detach from the copper wire.|$|E
50|$|The ores {{are treated}} by a sulfatizing roast in a {{fluidized}} bed furnace to convert copper and cobalt sulfides into soluble oxides and iron into insoluble hematite. The calcine is subsequently leached with sulfuric acid from the spent copper recovery electrolyte. Oxide concentrates are introduced at this leaching step {{to maintain the}} acid balance in the circuit. Iron and aluminum are removed from the leach solution {{by the addition of}} lime, and copper is electrowon on copper cathodes. A part of the spent electrolyte enters the cobalt recovery circuit and is purified by the removal of iron, copper, nickel, and zinc prior to the precipitation of cobalt as its hydroxide. This is accomplished by the addition of more lime to raise the pH until the remaining copper precipitates. This copper is sent back to the copper circuit. As more lime is then added, a copper-cobaltite precipitates and is fed back to the leaching process. Sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) is added (along with some metallic cobalt as a catalyst) to precipitate nickel sulfide (NiS). Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) are then added to precipitate zinc sulfide (ZnS). Lime is then added to saturation to precipitate cobalt(II) hydroxide (Co(OH)2). In the final stages, this cobalt hydroxide is redissolved and the metal is refined by electrolysis. The resulting cobalt cathodes are crushed and <b>vacuum</b> <b>degassed</b> to obtain a pure cobalt metal.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} improve soft {{magnetic}} properties of <b>vacuum</b> <b>degassed</b> NO steels, an adjusted temper rolling process for development of particular textures { 100 } was used. The main idea here relies on a deformation-induced grain growth, which promotes preferable formation of the grains with desired orientation. Two <b>vacuum</b> <b>degassed</b> NO steels were chosen as an experimental material. In both cases, a coarse or columnar grained microstructure, with pronounced intensity of cube and Goss texture components, was achieved during a continuous final annealing. The obtained microstructure leads to a significant decrease of coercivity, measured in DC magnetic field. The coercivity of steel with silicon content 2. 4 wt. % decreased from 42 A/m to 17 A/m.

40|$|Steel {{cleanliness}} as {{a function}} of stirring practice during <b>vacuum</b> <b>degassing</b> treatment have been investigated in industrial studies at the steel plants of SSAB Special Steels in Oxelösund and Uddeholm AB in Hagfors. The cleanliness was examined with regards to the contents of sulphur, nitrogen and large inclusions (> 10 µm). The stirring practice during the <b>vacuum</b> <b>degassing</b> treatment has been studied with respect to time, namely by shortening the <b>vacuum</b> <b>degassing</b> treatment time from 24 to 15 minutes. Furthermore, the effect of the stirring intensity was studied by measuring the open eye zone using camera recordings. The focus has been to study the effect of a shortened <b>vacuum</b> <b>degassing</b> time as well as a controlled stirring intensity on the steel cleanliness. Moreover, study the effect of subsequent induction stirring, after <b>vacuum</b> <b>degassing,</b> on the amount of inclusions. By taking steel and slag samples taken before and after the <b>vacuum</b> <b>degassing</b> treatment, the different stirring practices could be investigated. It should be noted that all heats reached the desired composition regardless of the treatment time and stirring practice. The results from the trials at SSAB Special Steels showed that the stirring practice during <b>vacuum</b> <b>degassing</b> {{have an effect on the}} total number of inclusions. The strong argon stirring during <b>vacuum</b> <b>degassing</b> with visible open eyes resulted in an average increase of 400 % of the total amount of inclusions > 10 µm. However, no difference between a <b>vacuum</b> <b>degassing</b> time of 24 or 15 minutes was seen with respect to the increased amount of inclusions, denitrogenization or desulphurization. During the subsequent induction stirring, which was softer with no open eyes, the effect of the stirring practice was unclear due to overlapping confidence intervals. An average decrease of 65 % of the total amount of inclusions > 10 µm was seen for the heats  with non-overlapping confidence intervals. Based on these results it can be suggested that the use of a soft induction stirring after the <b>vacuum</b> <b>degassing</b> treatment as a possible process change to reach lower amounts of large inclusions. The stirring intensity during the <b>vacuum</b> <b>degassing</b> treatment was measured as the average ladle eye size during the trials at Uddeholm AB. This, due to that stronger stirring results in larger ladle eye zone. The results show that the amount of smaller inclusions ( 22. 4 μm). Moreover, the denitrogenization and desulphurization was not affected by the changed stirring intensity during <b>vacuum</b> <b>degassing.</b> It was also found that the average ladle eye size did not correlate to the logged average argon flow.   QC 20150522 </p...|$|R

A dielectric spectrometer {{was used for the}} frequency range 10 - 4 to 10 - 2 Hz. A bespoke noise-free power supply was constructed and used to measure the dc conductivity and, using a Fourier transform technique, it was also used to measure the very low dielectric tanδ losses encountered at frequencies of 1 to 100 Hz. Tanδ measurements of <; 10 - 5 were found in this frequency range and attributed to a β-mode dielectric relaxation lying above 100 Hz due to motion of chain segments in the amorphous region and an β-mode relaxation lying below 1 Hz window due to twists of chains in the crystal lamellae. The dc conductivity measurements were consistent with those of the dielectric spectrometer and indicate lower dc conductivities in <b>vacuum</b> <b>degassed</b> cables than have been previously reported for XLPE (less than 10 - 17 S. m- 1). The conduction process is thermally activated with an activation energy of approximately 1. 1 eV. Higher conductivities were found for non-degassed cables. A transformer ratio bridge was used for measurements in the range 1 to 10 kHz; loss in this region was shown to be due to the series resistance of the semicon layers.

40|$|The present thesis was {{to study}} {{non-metallic}} inclusions during <b>vacuum</b> <b>degassing</b> in ladle treatment. Emphasize was mostly given to liquid CaO-Al 2 O 3 inclusions. A series of industrial experiments {{were carried out}} at Uddeholm Tooling AB, Hagfors, Sweden. To gain an insight into the industrial findings, laboratory investigations were also performed. Large number of steel samples were collected and examined. Liquid calcium aluminate inclusions with low SiO 2 and high SiO 2 were often found with spinel inclusions before <b>vacuum</b> <b>degassing.</b> Laboratory experiments showed that spinel would react with the dissolved Ca in the liquid steel forming calcium aluminate inclusions. This laboratory results agreed with the industrial observation that spinel phase was quite often found {{in the center of}} the calcium aluminate phase. After <b>vacuum</b> <b>degassing,</b> most of the inclusions were calcium aluminate liquid inclusions. When dissolved Al level was low, 2 types of liquid calcium aluminate inclusions with considerably different SiO 2 contents were found to coexist even at the end of the process. In view of the lack of the thermodynamic data for SiO 2 activities in the low silica region, thermodynamic measurements were conducted in the CaO-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 -MgO system. The experimental results could reasonably explain the coexistence of the two types of the liquid oxide inclusions. While the total number of inclusions decreased during <b>vacuum</b> <b>degassing,</b> the number of bigger inclusions (> 11. 3 μm) increased generally in used ladles. This finding was in accordance with the previous studies, wherein, ladle glaze was found to be responsible for the supply of bigger inclusions. The behaviors of several types of inclusions in liquid steel were examined using a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM). While alumina inclusions tended to impact on each other, agglomerate and grow very quickly, none of the other types of inclusions, such as spinel and calcium aluminate was observed to agglomerate. The results of LSCM study agreed well with the industrial observation. Examination on a huge number of inclusions did not show any indication of impact and physical growth of the inclusions, except the alumina inclusions. The removal of inclusions around open-eye in a gas-stirred ladle was experimentally studied by a cold model with oil and water. Most of the simulated inclusions were brought up to the oil phase by gas-water plume. Inclusion removal into oil layer took place when the inclusions passed through the sphere-bed of the oil layer around the open-eye. A calculation showed that the contribution of metal-gas plume in inclusion removal was much larger than that of buoyancy mechanism. The results of the industrial experiments revealed that the inclusions distribution strongly depended on stirring condition.

Four lollipop samples from four different heats were used for the experiment and all the samples were after <b>vacuum</b> (AV) <b>degassing.</b> In this study four different types of inclusions were found and they are classified as type 1, 2, 3 and 4. Of them type 1 inclusion was the major one with mostly spherical shaped. This study shows that among the three parameters, induction stirring has the biggest effect for the total number of inclusions per volume in the sample than the other two parameters Heat 4 A showed the lowest number of inclusions per volume comparing with the other heats. The main reason behind this can be said that the induction stirring was the lowest comparing with the other heats with moderate argon flow and ladle age of 12. Extreme value analysis was used in this study to predict the probability of getting largest size inclusions in a certain volume of the metal. For the prediction of the largest inclusion size, both the electrolytic extraction (3 D) and cross-sectional (2 D) method was used. Later in this study comparison was done to determine the accuracy of both the methods and it is concluded that for the type 1 inclusions electrolytic extraction method shows almost similar trend with cross-sectional method and electrolytic extraction method shows better accuracy for the prediction of largest size inclusions than the cross-sectional method. Electrolytic Extraction method is also applicable for the prediction of largest size inclusions for multiple types of inclusions...|$|R
