50|$|Vulcanization or <b>vulcanisation</b> is a {{chemical}} process for converting natural rubber or related polymers into more durable materials {{by the addition}} of sulfur or other equivalent curatives or accelerators. These additives modify the polymer by forming cross-links (bridges) between individual polymer chains. Vulcanized materials are less sticky and have superior mechanical properties. The term vulcanized fiber refers to cellulose that has been treated in a zinc chloride solution to cross-link the cellulose fibers.|$|E

50|$|First {{developed}} in 1952 {{under the name}} Pirelli Cintura, taking the name Cinturato in 1963, the tyre was composed {{of two or three}} carcass plies of cords laid at an angle of 90 degrees to the beads, and a belt of several plies laid circumferentially under the tread. Without a belt, the 90-degree plies would produce a casing which would greatly increase its sectional height on inflation. The belt, being inextensible, prevented the casing increasing in height when inflated, and the inflated tyre maintained almost the same dimensions as in the mould in which it went through <b>vulcanisation.</b> The belt was kept under tension, and the tread retained its flatter profile even when the tyre was inflated.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{has been}} devoted to a great many {{different}} possibilities to reduce the level of ZnO in rubber compounds, with emphasis on {{the development of a new}} type of activator. It must be realised that <b>vulcanisation</b> is a complex process, whereby many ingredients and parameters play an important role. ZnO and zinc-containing species are considered indispensable for the <b>vulcanisation</b> process and certainly difficult to substitute. Long-term solutions for the reduction of emissions of zinc into the environment should be focused on the development of new and effective concepts for completely new zinc-free <b>vulcanisation</b> systems. Short-term strategies will be mainly concentrated on reduced dosages of zinc and a higher chemical activity, combined with an increased solubilisation. In this respect progress has been made by the development of the ZnClay. In summary, the research described in this thesis combines a pragmatic in-rubber investigation and a fundamental study of the chemistry all through the <b>vulcanisation</b> reactions cascade. It has contributed to a better understanding of the role of the activator in the sulphur <b>vulcanisation</b> process...|$|E

The effect of the ionic liquids on the <b>vulcanisation</b> kinetics of the rubber compounds, crosslink density and mechanical properties of the vulcanisates and their resistance to thermo-oxidative and UV ageing was studied. The use of ionic liquids allowed for a homogeneous dispersion of nanoparticles in the elastomer without detrimental effects on the <b>vulcanisation</b> process. The physical properties and the thermal stability of the obtained vulcanisates were significantly improved.

Thirty compounds of 150 newly synthesised accelerators showed very similar <b>vulcanisation</b> characteristics to those of industrial standard already in use.
