Of particular note, Fitzgerald indicates that while Wain's art took on a more abstract nature as he grew older, his technique and skill as a painter did not diminish, {{as one would expect}} from a person with schizophrenia. Moreover, elements of <b>visual</b> <b>agnosia</b> are demonstrated in his painting. If Wain had <b>visual</b> <b>agnosia,</b> it might have manifested itself merely as an extreme attention to detail.|$|E

50|$|Apperceptive agnosia is {{failure in}} {{recognition}} that {{is due to}} a failure of perception. In contrast, associative agnosia is a type of agnosia where perception occurs but recognition still does not occur. When referring to apperceptive <b>agnosia,</b> <b>visual</b> and object <b>agnosia</b> are most commonly discussed; This occurs because apperceptive agnosia is most likely to present visual impairments. However, in addition to <b>visual</b> apperceptive <b>agnosia</b> there are also cases of apperceptive agnosia in other sensory areas.|$|R
40|$|Introduction There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} that face processing in the brain is localized. The double dissociation between prosopagnosia, a face recognition deficit occurring after brain damage, and <b>visual</b> object <b>agnosia,</b> difficulty recognizing other kinds of complex objects, indicates that face and non-face object recognition may be served by partially independent neural mechanisms. In this chapter, we use computational models {{to show how the}} face processing specialization apparently underlying prosopagnosia and <b>visual</b> object <b>agnosia</b> could be attributed to 1) a relatively simple competitive selection mechanism that, during development, devotes neural resources to the tasks they are best at performing, 2) the developing infant's need to perform subordinate classification (identification) of faces early on, and 3) the infant's low visual acuity at birth. Prosopagnosia and <b>visual</b> object <b>agnosia</b> together form a classic neuropsychological double dissociation. This might be taken as ev...|$|R
2500|$|In contrast, {{individuals}} with associative <b>visual</b> <b>agnosia</b> experience difficulty {{when asked to}} name objects. Associative agnosia is associated with damage to both {{the right and left}} hemispheres at the occipitotemporal border. [...] A specific form of associative <b>visual</b> <b>agnosia</b> is known as prosopagnosia. [...] Prosopagnosia is the inability to recognize faces. [...] For example, these individuals have difficulty recognizing friends, family and coworkers. However, {{individuals with}} prosopagnosia can recognize all other types of visual stimuli.|$|E
2500|$|Agnosias are sensory {{modality}} specific, usually {{classified as}} visual, auditory, or tactile. [...] Associative <b>visual</b> <b>agnosia</b> {{refers to a}} subtype of <b>visual</b> <b>agnosia,</b> which was labeled by Lissauer (1890), as an inability to connect the visual percept (mental representation of something being perceived through the senses) with its related semantic information stored in memory, such as, its name, use, and description. This is distinguished from the visual apperceptive form of <b>visual</b> <b>agnosia,</b> apperceptive <b>visual</b> <b>agnosia,</b> which is an inability to produce a complete percept, and {{is associated with a}} failure in higher order perceptual processing where feature integration is impaired, though individual features can be distinguished. [...] In reality, patients often fall between both distinctions, with some degree of perceptual disturbances exhibited in most cases, and in some cases, patients may be labeled as integrative agnostics when they fit the criteria for both forms. [...] Associative visual agnosias are often category-specific, where recognition of particular categories of items are differentially impaired, which can affect selective classes of stimuli, larger generalized groups or multiple intersecting categories. [...] For example, deficits in recognizing stimuli can be as specific as familiar human faces or as diffuse as living things or non-living things.|$|E
2500|$|Associative <b>visual</b> <b>agnosia</b> {{is a form}} of <b>visual</b> <b>agnosia.</b> It is an {{impairment}} in recognition or assigning meaning to a stimulus that is accurately perceived and not associated with a generalized deficit in intelligence, memory, language or attention. [...] The disorder appears to be very uncommon in a [...] "pure" [...] or uncomplicated form and is usually accompanied by other complex neuropsychological problems {{due to the nature of}} the etiology. [...] Afflicted individuals can accurately distinguish the object, as demonstrated by the ability to draw a picture of it or categorize accurately, yet they are unable to identify the object, its features or its functions.|$|E
5000|$|Loss {{of object}} {{recognition}} is called <b>visual</b> object <b>agnosia.</b> There are two broad categories of visual object agnosia: apperceptive and associative. When object agnosia occurs from a lesion {{in the dominant}} hemisphere, {{there is often a}} profound associated language disturbance, including loss of word meaning.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} tested {{the idea that}} the visuomotor systems {{mediating}} prehension do not have independent access to pictorial cues processed by perceptual mechanisms. Individuals with <b>visual</b> form <b>agnosia,</b> whose perceptual systems are compromised but who have intact visuomotor control, were examined to determine whether they could use pictorial scene cues to calibrate manual prehension when binocular information was removed. The removal of binocular cues produced considerable disruptions in size-constancy of grip aperture, which, combined with earlier observations in normal subjects, suggests that binocular cues are of primary importance in calibration of grasping. In the absence of binocular vision, normal subjects can use pictorial information, information that is severely compromised in individuals with <b>visual</b> form <b>agnosia,</b> to compute the distance (and thus the size) of the goal object. Thus, individuals with <b>visual</b> form <b>agnosia</b> must rely on a retinal image that remains uncalibrated, leading to inaccurate calibrations of grip aperture. The fact that these individuals scaled their grasp much less accurately under the monocular viewing condition, despite showing normal binocular grasping, suggests that pictorial cues to depth, which are presumably processed by mechanisms mediating our perception of objects and events in the world, can be accessed by visuomotor mechanisms only indirectly. These results, together with others, suggest that the visuomotor system ‘prefers’ to use binocular information and uses pictorial cues only as a last resort...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} new case of <b>visual</b> {{associative}} <b>agnosia.</b> Our patient (DJ) was impaired in several tasks assessing visual processing of real objects, colour pictures, and line drawings. The deficit was present both with naming and gesturing responses. Object processing in other modalities (verbal, auditory nonverbal, and tactile) was intact. Semantic processing was impaired {{in the visual}} {{but not in the}} verbal modality. Picture-word matching was better than single picture identification. DJ's visual perceptual processing, was intact in several tasks such as visual attributes discrimination, shape discrimination, illusory contours perception, segmentation, embedded figures processing and matching objects under different viewpoints. Most importantly, we show that there was no impairment of stored structural descriptions and that the patient was able to build new visual representations. These results are considered in the context of Farah's (1990, 1991) proposals about <b>visual</b> associative <b>agnosia.</b> info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
2500|$|Organizational {{strategies}} may be extremely helpful {{for an individual}} with <b>visual</b> <b>agnosia.</b> [...] For example, organizing clothes according to different hangers provides tactile cues for the individual, {{making it easier to}} identify certain forms of clothing as opposed to relying solely on visual cues.|$|E
2500|$|Damage to {{the left}} {{hemisphere}} of the brain has been explicitly implicated in the associative form of <b>visual</b> <b>agnosia.</b> [...] Goldberg suggested that the associative visual form of agnosia results from damage to the ventral stream of the brain, the occipito-temporal stream, which {{plays a key role}} in object recognition as the so-called [...] "what" [...] region of the brain, as opposed to the [...] "where," [...] dorsal stream.|$|E
2500|$|Moreover, recent neuropsychological {{research}} has questioned {{the validity of}} the dissociation of the two streams that has provided the cornerstone of evidence for the model. [...] The dissociation between <b>visual</b> <b>agnosia</b> and optic ataxia has been challenged by several researchers as not as strong as originally portrayed; Hesse and colleagues demonstrated dorsal stream impairments in patient DF; Himmelbach and colleagues reassessed DF's abilities and applied more rigorous statistical analysis demonstrating that the dissociation wasn't as strong as first thought.|$|E

5000|$|Tactile apperceptive agnosia {{result in}} the {{inability}} of shape representations specific to tactile modality. The impairment is restricted to the hands even though sensation is not impaired. This is similar to <b>visual</b> apperceptive <b>agnosia</b> {{in that it is}} basic level processing that is impaired.

40|$|Loss {{of shape}} {{recognition}} in <b>visual</b> form <b>agnosia</b> occurs without equivalent {{losses in the}} use of vision to guide actions, providing support for the hypothesis of two visual systems (for “perception” and “action”). The human individual DF received a toxic exposure to carbon monoxide some years ago, which resulted a persisting <b>visual</b> form <b>agnosia</b> that has been extensively characterized at the behavioral level. We conducted a detailed high-resolution MRI study of DF’s cortex, combining structural and functional measurements. We present the first accurate quantification of the changes in thickness across DF’s occipital cortex, finding the most substantial loss in the lateral occipital cortex LOC. There are reduced white matter connections between LOC and other areas. Functional measures show pockets of activity that survive within structurally damaged areas. The topographic mapping of visual areas showed that ordered retinotopic maps were evident for DF in the ventral portions of V 1, V 2, V 3 and hV 4. Although V 1 shows evidence of topographic order in its dorsal portion, such maps could not be found in the dorsal parts of V 2 and V 3. We conclude that {{it is not possible to}} understand fully the deficits in object perception in <b>visual</b> form <b>agnosia</b> without the exploitation of both structural and functional measurements. Our results also highlight for DF the cortical routes through which visual information is able to pass to support her well-documented abilities to use visual information to guide actions...|$|R
2500|$|In some of {{his other}} books, he {{describes}} cases of Tourette syndrome and various effects of Parkinson's disease. The title article of The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat is about a man with <b>visual</b> <b>agnosia</b> and {{was the subject of}} a 1986 opera by Michael Nyman. The title article of his book, An Anthropologist on Mars, which won a Polk Award for magazine reporting, is about Temple Grandin, an autistic professor. He writes in the book's preface that neurological conditions such as autism [...] "can play a paradoxical role, by bringing out latent powers, developments, evolutions, forms of life that might never be seen, or even be imaginable, in their absence."

2500|$|Another {{clinical}} {{case that}} would a priori suggest a module for modularity in visual processing is <b>visual</b> <b>agnosia.</b> The well studied patient DF {{is unable to}} recognize or discriminate objects owing to damage {{in areas of the}} lateral occipital cortex although she can see scenes without problem – she can literally see the forest but not the trees. Neuroimaging of intact individuals reveals strong occipito-temporal activation during object presentation and greater activation still for object recognition. Of course, such activation could be due to other processes, such as visual attention. However, other evidence that shows a tight coupling of perceptual and physiological changes suggests activation in this area does underpin object recognition. Within these regions are more specialized areas for face or fine grained analysis, place perception and human body perception. Perhaps some of the strongest evidence for the modular nature of these processing systems is the double dissociation between object- and face (prosop-) agnosia. However, as with color and motion, early areas (see [...] for a comprehensive review) are implicated too, lending support {{to the idea of a}} multistage stream terminating in the inferotemporal cortex rather than an isolated module.|$|E

50|$|All these {{arguments}} notwithstanding, {{there is a}} major concordance between the locations of items in object space and their correlates in visual space. It is adequately veridical for us to navigate very effectively in the world, deviations from such a situation are sufficiently notable to warrant special consideration. <b>visual</b> space <b>agnosia</b> is a recognized neurological condition, and the many common distortions, called geometrical-optical illusions, are widely demonstrated but of minor consequence.|$|R

Inspired by de Schonen and Mancini's (1998) arguments that factors like these could bias the visual system to develop a specialized face processor, and Jacobs and Kosslyn's (1994) experiments in the mixtures of experts (ME) modeling paradigm, we provide a preliminary computational demonstration of how this theory accounts for the double dissociation between face and object processing. We present two feed-forward computational models of visual processing. In both models, the selection mechanism is a gating network that mediates a competition between modules attempting to classify input stimuli.

40|$|The human {{nervous system}} {{constructs}} a Euclidean representation of near (personal) space by combining multiple {{sources of information}} (cues). We investigated the cues used for the representation of personal space in a patient with <b>visual</b> form <b>agnosia</b> (DF). Our results indicated that DF relies predominantly on binocular vergence information when determining the distance of a target {{despite the presence of}} other (retinal) cues. Notably, DF was able to construct an Euclidean representation of personal space from vergence alone. This finding supports previous assertions that vergence provides the nervous system with veridical information for the construction of personal space. The results from the current study, together with those of others, suggest that: (i) the ventral stream is responsible for extracting depth and distance information from "monocular" retinal cues (i. e. from shading, texture, perspective) and (ii) the dorsal stream has access to binocular information (from horizontal image disparities and vergence). These results also indicate that DF was not able to use size information to gauge target distance, suggesting that intact temporal cortex is necessary for "learned size" to influence distance processing. Our findings further suggest that in neurologically intact humans, object information extracted in the ventral pathway is combined with the products of dorsal stream processing for guiding prehension. Finally, we studied the "size-distance paradox" in <b>visual</b> form <b>agnosia</b> in order to explore the cognitive use of size information. The results of this experiment were consistent with a previous suggestion that the paradox is a cognitive phenomenon. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{everyday}} life our reaching behaviour {{has to be}} guided {{not only by the}} location and properties of the target object, but also by the presence of potential obstacles in the workspace. Recent evidence from neglect and optic ataxia patients has suggested that this automatic obstacle avoidance is mediated by the dorsal, rather than the ventral, stream of visual processing. We tested this idea in two studies involving patients with <b>visual</b> form <b>agnosia</b> resulting from bilateral ventral-stream damage. In the first study, we asked patient DF to reach out and pick up a target object in the presence of obstacles placed at varying distances to the left or right of the target. We found that both DF and controls shifted their trajectories away from the potential obstacles and adjusted their grip aperture {{in such a way as}} to minimize risk of collision. In a second study, we asked DF and a second patient, SB, to either reach between, or to bisect the space between, two cylinders presented at varying locations. We found that both patients adjusted their reach trajectories to account for shifts in cylinder location in the reaching task, despite showing significantly worse performance than control subjects when asked to make a bisection judgement. Taken together, these data indicate that automatic obstacle avoidance behaviour is spared in our patients with <b>visual</b> form <b>agnosia.</b> We attribute their ability to the functional intactness of the dorsal stream of visual processing, and argue that the ventral stream plays no important role in automatic obstacle avoidance. ...|$|R
