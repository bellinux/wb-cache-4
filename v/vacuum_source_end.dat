40|$|The Rapid Cycle Amine (RCA) {{system is}} a low power {{assembly}} capable of simultaneously removing carbon dioxide (CO 2) and humidity from an influent air steam and subsequent regeneration when exposed to a <b>vacuum</b> <b>source.</b> Two solid amine sorbent beds are alternated between an uptake mode and a regeneration mode. During the uptake mode, the sorbent is exposed to an air steam (ventilation loop) to adsorb CO 2 and water vapor, while during the regeneration mode, the sorbent rejects the adsorbed CO 2 and water vapor to a <b>vacuum</b> <b>source.</b> The two beds operate such that while one bed is in the uptake mode, the other is in the regeneration mode, thus continuously providing an on-service sorbent bed by which CO 2 and humidity may be removed. A novel valve assembly provides a simple means of diverting the process air flow through the uptake bed while simultaneously directing the <b>vacuum</b> <b>source</b> to the regeneration bed. Additionally, the valve assembly is designed to allow for switching between uptake and regeneration modes with only one moving part while minimizing gas volume losses to the <b>vacuum</b> <b>source</b> {{by means of an}} internal pressure equalization step during actuation. The process can be controlled by a compact, low power controller design with several modes of operation available to the user. Together with NASA, United Technologies Corporation Aerospace Systems has been developing RCA 2. 0 based on performance and design feedback on several sorbent bed test articles and valve design concepts.

40|$|Quantum vacuum {{fluctuations}} impose strict {{limits on}} precision displacement measurements, those of interferometric gravitational-wave detectors among them. Introducing squeezed states into an interferometer's readout port {{can improve the}} sensitivity of the instrument, leading to richer astrophysical observations. In recent years, this technique has been used to improve {{the sensitivity of the}} GEO 600 [1011 and the Initial LIGO detector at Hanford, WA [102]. Squeezed states could be employed in advanced gravitational-wave detectors, such as Advanced LIGO, to further push the limits of the observable gravitational wave universe. To maximize the benefit from squeezing, environmentally induced disturbances such as back scattering and angular jitter need to be mitigated. Also, optomechanical interactions dictate that the quadrature of the squeezed vacuum state must rotate by 900 at around 50 Hz in order to achieve a broadband sensitivity improvement for Advanced LIGO. In this thesis we describe a series of experiments that lead to a ultra-high vacuum (UHV) compatible, low phase noise, and frequency-dependent squeezed <b>vacuum</b> <b>source</b> required for Advanced LIGO and future gravitational-wave detectors. In order to develop the required technology, two proof-of-principal experiments were conducted. In the first experiment, we built a UHV compatible squeezed <b>vacuum</b> <b>source</b> and homodyne readout and operated them in UHV conditions. We also commissioned a control scheme that achieved a record low 1. 30 - 7 mrad of phase noise. This is a nearly tenfold improvement over previously reported measurements with audio-band squeezed <b>vacuum</b> <b>sources.</b> In the second experiment we used a 2 -m-long, high-finesse optical resonator to produce frequency-dependent squeezed quadrature rotation around 1. 2 kHz. This demonstration of audio-band frequency-dependent squeezing uses technology and methods that are scalable to the required rotation frequency for Advance LIGO, firmly establishing the viability of this technique for application in current and future gravitational-wave detectors. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of these results for squeezing enhancement in Advanced LIGO and beyond. by Eric Oelker. Thesis: Ph.
