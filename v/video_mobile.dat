This made Three the UK's first commercial <b>video</b> <b>mobile</b> network. On 9 December 2004, Three {{announced that it was}} the first network to meet its regulatory requirement of 80% population coverage in the UK. Three's UK division is owned entirely by Hutchison Whampoa. Three operates 3G and 4G services, and maintains a national roaming agreement with Orange to provide 2G services where 3G is unavailable. Until 2006, Three partnered with O2 for 2G services. The 2G fallback coverage provided by Orange has since greatly diminished. While still available, it is being removed in some areas as Three believe 3G technology is now enough for mass adoption, and as a result, many (often at the cheaper end) phones that support only 2G networks are not compatible with the Three network.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Mobile {{video is}} {{becoming}} extremely popular {{these days and}} P 2 P <b>mobile</b> <b>video</b> platforms are considered for large deployment in this context. However, mobile networks have some peculiar characteristics {{that have to be}} considered for the design and deployment of realistic P 2 P <b>mobile</b> <b>video</b> system over a real mobile network. In this article, we take the viewpoint of a large-scale commercial P 2 P <b>mobile</b> <b>video</b> provider system, PPTV, and describe the challenges to implement a P 2 P <b>mobile</b> <b>video</b> system over 3 G. Our analysis is backed by real measurement and experience from PPTV. We extract from these measurements the characteristics of <b>mobile</b> <b>videos</b> and analyze their impacts on P 2 P video systems. We also discuss other encountered practical problems in the design of a mobile P 2 P system for PPTV. Index Terms—P 2 P, <b>mobile</b> <b>video,</b> PPTV. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for <b>mobile</b> <b>video</b> has {{attracted much attention}} from both industry and researchers. To satisfy users and to facilitate the usage of <b>mobile</b> <b>video,</b> providing optimal quality to the users is necessary. As a result, quality of experience (QoE) becomes an important focus in measuring the overall quality perceived by the end-users, from the aspects of both objective system performance and subjective experience. However, due {{to the complexity of}} user experience and diversity of resources (such as <b>videos,</b> networks and <b>mobile</b> devices), it is still challenging to develop QoE models for <b>mobile</b> <b>video</b> that can represent how user-perceived value varies with changing conditions. Previous QoE modelling research has two main limitations: aspects influencing QoE are insufficiently considered; and acceptability as the user value is seldom studied. Focusing on the QoE modelling issues, two aims are defined in this thesis: (i) investigating the key influencing factors of <b>mobile</b> <b>video</b> QoE; and (ii) establishing QoE prediction models based on the relationships between user acceptability and the influencing factors, in order to help provide optimal <b>mobile</b> <b>video</b> quality. To achieve the first goal, a comprehensive user study was conducted. It investigated the main impacts on user acceptance: video encoding parameters such as quantization parameter, spatial resolution, frame rate, and encoding bitrate; <b>video</b> content type; <b>mobile</b> device display resolution; and user profiles including gender, preference for video content, and prior viewing experience. Results from both quantitative and qualitative analysis revealed the significance of these factors, as well as how and why they influenced user acceptance of <b>mobile</b> <b>video</b> quality. Based on the results of the user study, statistical techniques were used to generate a set of QoE models that predict the subjective acceptability of <b>mobile</b> <b>video</b> quality by using a group of the measurable influencing factors, including encoding parameters and bitrate, content type, and mobile device display resolution. Applying the proposed QoE models into a <b>mobile</b> <b>video</b> delivery system, optimal decisions can be made for determining proper video coding parameters and for delivering most suitable quality to users. This would lead to consistent user experience on different <b>mobile</b> <b>video</b> content and efficient resource allocation. The findings in this research enhance the understanding of user experience in the field of <b>mobile</b> <b>video,</b> which will benefit <b>mobile</b> <b>video</b> design and research. This thesis presents a way of modelling QoE by emphasising user acceptability of <b>mobile</b> <b>video</b> quality, which provides a strong connection between technical parameters and user-desired quality. Managing QoE based on acceptability promises the potential for adapting to the resource limitations and achieving an optimal QoE in the provision of <b>mobile</b> <b>video</b> content...|$|R
