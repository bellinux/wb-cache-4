25|$|Calcium oxalate is {{the most}} common {{component}} of kidney stones. Early investigators isolated oxalic acid from wood-sorrel (Oxalis). Members of the spinach family and the brassicas (cabbage, broccoli, brussels sprouts) are high in oxalates, as are sorrel and umbellifers like parsley. Rhubarb leaves contain about 0.5% oxalic acid, and jack-in-the-pulpit (Arisaema triphyllum) contains calcium oxalate crystals. Similarly, the <b>Virginia</b> <b>creeper,</b> a common decorative vine, produces oxalic acid in its berries as well as oxalite crystals in the sap, in the form of raphides. Bacteria produce oxalates from oxidation of carbohydrates.|$|E

60|$|He {{bent down}} to regard a lean file of {{spearmint}} growing by the wall. Make a summerhouse here.

Loam, what is this that is? The hens in the next garden: their droppings are very good top dressing. Best of all though are the cattle, especially when they are fed on those oilcakes. Mulch of dung. Best thing to clean ladies' kid gloves. Dirty cleans. Ashes too. Reclaim the whole place. Grow peas in that corner there. Lettuce. Always have fresh greens then. Still gardens have their drawbacks.

60|$|Twenty-one {{years and}} six months do not pass without setting a mark even upon durable stone and triple brass; upon {{humanity}} such a period works nothing less than transformation. In Barnet's old birthplace vivacious young children with bones like india-rubber had grown up to be stable men and women, men and women had dried in the skin, stiffened, withered, and sunk into decrepitude; while selections from every class had been consigned to the outlying cemetery. Of inorganic differences the greatest was that a railway had invaded the town, tying it on to a main line at a junction a dozen miles off. Barnet's house on the harbour-road, once so insistently new, had acquired a respectable mellowness, with ivy, <b>Virginia</b> <b>creepers,</b> lichens, damp patches, and even constitutional infirmities of its own like its elder fellows. Its architecture, once so very improved and modern, had already become stale in style, without having reached the dignity of being old-fashioned. Trees about the harbour-road had increased in circumference or disappeared under the saw; while the church had had such a tremendous practical joke played upon it by some facetious restorer or other as to be scarce recognizable by its dearest old friends.|$|R

60|$|FOUR {{girls were}} {{together}} in a pleasant cottage room with a large window, over which fluttered some dry sticks, which would in due time bear clematis and <b>Virginia</b> <b>creeper</b> leaves.|$|E
60|$|When I {{had dressed}} I {{went downstairs to}} the front door, {{and sat on the}} {{sandstone}} steps under the arch of the <b>Virginia</b> <b>creeper.</b> I was all alone, for Mary Sloane had gone to Avonlea.|$|E
6000|$|Lawrence {{arrived at}} his cottage in the morning; and early in the {{afternoon}} of the same day he rode over to Midbranch. He found the country a good deal changed, and he did not like the changes. His road, which ran for much of its distance through the woods, was covered with leaves, some green, and some red and yellow, and he did not fancy the peculiar smell of these leaves, which reminded him, in some way, of that gathering together of the characters in old-fashioned comedies shortly before the fall of the curtain. In many places where {{there used to be a}} thick shade, the foliage was now quite thin, and through it he could see a good deal of the sky. The <b>Virginia</b> <b>creepers,</b> or [...] "poison oaks," [...] whichever they were, were growing red upon the trunks of the trees as if they had been at table too long and showed it, and when he rode out of the woods he saw that the fields, which he remembered as wide, swelling slopes of green, with cattle and colts feeding here and there, were now being ploughed into corrugated stretches of monotonous drab and brown. If he had been there through all the gradual changes of the season, he, probably, would have enjoyed them as much as people ordinarily do; but coming back in this way, the altered landscape slightly shocked him.|$|R
6000|$|... “The man is mad!” exclaimed Adela tragically. A {{moment later}} it was Adela herself who {{appeared}} to go mad. The ox had finished the vase-flowers and the cover of “Israel Kalisch,” {{and appeared to be}} thinking of leaving its rather restricted quarters. Eshley noticed its restlessness and promptly flung it some bunches of <b>Virginia</b> <b>creeper</b> leaves as an inducement to continue the sitting.|$|E
60|$|This {{afternoon}} {{they had}} rambled through the woods, where the hard, smooth road wound picturesquely through the places {{in which it}} had been easiest to make a road, and where the great trunks of the trees were partly covered by clinging vines, which Miss Roberta knew to be either <b>Virginia</b> <b>creeper</b> or poison oak, although she did not remember which of these had clusters of five leaves, and which of three.|$|E
6000|$|... 'There's a {{great deal}} to be said, Le Breton, in favour of October term,' he observed, in his soft, musical voice, as he gazed pensively across the central grass-plot to the crimson drapery of the Founder's Tower. 'Just look at that {{magnificent}} <b>Virginia</b> <b>creeper</b> over there, now; just look at the way the red on it melts imperceptibly into Tyrian purple and cloth of gold! Isn't that in itself argument enough to fling at Hartmann's head, if he ventured to come here sprinkling about his heresies, with his affected little spray-shooter, {{in the midst of a}} drowsy Oxford autumn? The Cardinal never saw <b>Virginia</b> <b>creeper,</b> I suppose; a man of his taste wouldn't have been guilty of committing such a gross practical anachronism as that, any more than he would have smoked a cigarette before tobacco was invented; but if only he could have seen the October effect on that tower yonder, he'd have acknowledged that his own hat and robe were positively nowhere in the running, for colour, wouldn't he?' ...|$|E
60|$|That {{night on}} the piazza, where the hammock hangs {{in the shadow of}} the <b>Virginia</b> <b>creeper,</b> he did it. By sheer good luck the judge had gone indoors to the library, and by a piece of rare good fortune Mrs. Pepperleigh had gone indoors to the sewing room, and by a happy trick of {{coincidence}} the servant was out and the dog was tied up--in fact, no such chain of circumstances was ever offered in favour of mortal man before.|$|E
60|$|The {{carriage}} {{turned into}} a street arched by old elms, and flanked by the houses of the most prosperous townspeople. Some of these were of the old-fashioned, classic type, and others new examples of a national architecture seeking to find itself,--white and yellow colonial, roughcast modifications of the Shakespearian period, and nondescript mixtures of cobblestones and shingles. Each was surrounded by trim lawns and shrubbery. The church itself was set back from the street. It was of bluish stone, and half covered with <b>Virginia</b> <b>creeper.</b>|$|E
60|$|If Anne had tumbled off {{the roof}} on the side up which she had ascended Diana would {{probably}} have fallen heir to the pearl bead ring then and there. Fortunately she fell on the other side, where the roof extended down over the porch so nearly to the ground that a fall therefrom was a much less serious thing. Nevertheless, when Diana and the other girls had rushed frantically around the house--except Ruby Gillis, who remained as if rooted {{to the ground and}} went into hysterics--they found Anne lying all white and limp among the wreck and ruin of the <b>Virginia</b> <b>creeper.</b>|$|E
60|$|Anne {{climbed the}} ladder amid breathless silence, gained the ridgepole, {{balanced}} herself uprightly on that precarious footing, {{and started to}} walk along it, dizzily conscious that she was uncomfortably {{high up in the}} world and that walking ridgepoles was not a thing in which your imagination helped you out much. Nevertheless, she managed to take several steps before the catastrophe came. Then she swayed, lost her balance, stumbled, staggered, and fell, sliding down over the sun-baked roof and crashing off it through the tangle of <b>Virginia</b> <b>creeper</b> beneath--all before the dismayed circle below could give a simultaneous, terrified shriek.|$|E
6000|$|One Saturday {{afternoon}} Agatha and Miriam were upstairs dressing. Their {{bedroom was}} over the stable. It was a low room, not very large, and bare. Miriam had nailed on the wall a reproduction of Veronese's [...] "St. Catherine". She loved the woman who sat in the window, dreaming. Her own windows were too small to sit in. But the front one was dripped over with honeysuckle and <b>virginia</b> <b>creeper,</b> and looked upon the tree-tops of the oak-wood across the yard, while the little back window, {{no bigger than a}} handkerchief, was a loophole to the east, to the dawn beating up against the beloved round hills.|$|E
60|$|Lancaster {{came out}} and dropped fifteen cents into Olive's hand. He could not help {{regarding}} with interest the occupants of the carriage, and Mrs. Easterfield looked hard at him. Suddenly Olive turned in her seat; {{she looked at the}} house, she looked at the garden, she looked at the little piazza {{by the side of the}} tollhouse. Yes, it was really the same place. For an instant she thought she might have been mistaken, but there was her window with the <b>Virginia</b> <b>creeper</b> under the sill where she had trained it herself. Then she made a motion to her companion, who immediately drove on.|$|E
60|$|Lisle {{paused to}} look back {{when he reached the}} end of the terrace, from which a path that would save him a short walk led through a shrubbery. One wing of the {{building}} was covered with <b>Virginia</b> <b>creeper</b> that glowed with the gorgeous hues of a fading maple leaf, the sunlight lay on the grass, and the feeling of tranquillity that hung about the place grew stronger. He thought that he could understand how the desire to possess it would stir an Englishman reared in such surroundings, and yet he was now convinced that this was not the impulse which had driven Gladwyne into deserting his starving cousin. The man had merely yielded to craven fear.|$|E
60|$|Philip {{would have}} liked {{a few days to}} himself; but he had seen the Athelnys the night before (he had gone at once to take them his good news) and there was really no reason why he should not start immediately. He had little luggage to pack. Soon after seven that evening {{he got out of the}} station at Farnley and took a cab to Doctor South's. It was a broad low stucco house, with a <b>Virginia</b> <b>creeper</b> growing over it. He was shown into the consulting-room. An old man was writing at a desk. He looked up as the maid ushered Philip in. He did not get up, and he did not speak; he merely stared at Philip. Philip was taken aback.|$|E
60|$|It is a garden--a remarkably {{small garden}} to be sure, {{but one that}} is {{arranged}} {{with a degree of}} taste and a display of fancy that betokens the gardener a genius. Among roses and mignonette, heliotrope, clematis and wallflower, chrysanthemums, verbenas and sweet-peas are intertwined, on rustic trellis-work, the rich green leaves of the ivy and the graceful <b>Virginia</b> <b>creeper</b> in such a manner that the surroundings of the miniature garden are completely hidden from view, and nothing but the bright blue sky is visible, save where one little opening in the foliage reveals the prospect of a grand glittering river, where leviathans of the deep and small fry of the shallows, of every shape and size, disport themselves in the blaze of a summer sun.|$|E
6000|$|... "When I {{reached the}} house I did not exactly {{comprehend}} what I saw; {{it was the}} same house, and yet it was entirely different. It seemed to have grown fifty years older than it was when I first saw it. Its color was that of wood beautifully stained by age. There was a low piazza I had not noticed, which was covered with vines. Bright-colored old-fashioned flowers were growing in beds close to the house, and there was a pathway, bordered by box bushes, which led from the front door to a gateway in a stone wall which partly surrounded the green little yard. I had not noticed before the gateway or the stone wall, on which grew bitter-sweet vines and <b>Virginia</b> <b>creeper.</b>|$|E
60|$|There was {{a driving}} drizzle of rain, like a dirty curtain before the landscape. The {{nasturtium}} leaves by the garden walk had gone rotten in a frost, and the gay green discs had given {{place to the}} first black flags of winter, hung on flaccid stalks, pinched at the neck. The grass plot was strewn with fallen leaves, wet and brilliant: scarlet splashes of <b>Virginia</b> <b>creeper,</b> golden drift from the limes, ruddy brown shawls under the beeches, and away back in the corner, the black mat of maple leaves, heavy soddened; {{they ought to have}} been a vivid lemon colour. Occasionally one of these great black leaves would loose its hold, and zigzag down, staggering in the dance of death.|$|E
