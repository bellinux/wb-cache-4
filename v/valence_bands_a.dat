40|$|We {{investigate}} the spin-dependent thermoelectric effects in magnetic graphene in both diffusive and ballistic regimes. Employing the Boltzmann and Landauer formalisms we calculate the spin and charge Seebeck coefficients (thermopower) in magnetic graphene varying the spin splitting, temperature, and doping of the junction. It is {{found that while}} in normal graphene the temperature gradient drive a charge current, {{in the case of}} magnetic graphene a significant spin current is also established. In particular we show that in the undoped magnetic graphene in which different spin carriers belong to conduction and <b>valence</b> <b>bands,</b> <b>a</b> pure spin current is driven by the temperature gradient. In addition it is revealed that profound thermoelectric effects can be achieved at intermediate easily accessible temperatures when the thermal energy is comparable with Fermi energy k_BT≲μ. By further investigation of the spin-dependent Seebeck effect and a significantly large figure of merit for spin thermopower Z_ spT, we suggest magnetic graphene as a promising material for spin-caloritronics studies and applications.

40|$|We {{show that}} in AB stacked bilayer {{graphene}} low energy excitations around the semimetallic points are described by massless, four dimensional Dirac fermions. There is an effective reconstruction of the 4 dimensional spacetime, including in particular the dimension perpendicular to the sheet, that arises dynamically from the physical graphene sheet and the interactions experienced by the carriers. The effective spacetime is the Eisenhart-Duval lift of the dynamics experienced by Galilei invariant Lévy-Leblond spin 1 / 2 particles near the Dirac points. We find that changing the intrinsic curvature of the bilayer sheet induces {{a change in the}} energy level of the electronic bands, switching from a conducting regime for negative curvature to an insulating one when curvature is positive. In particular, curving graphene bilayers allows opening or closing the energy gap between conduction and <b>valence</b> <b>bands,</b> <b>a</b> key effect for electronic devices.

40|$|InAs/GaSb heterojunctions {{offer the}} unique {{situation}} in a semiconductor of overlapping conduction and <b>valence</b> <b>bands.</b> <b>A</b> wavevector dependent minigap occurs due to the anticrossing of the electron and hole dispersion relations. As a result the resistivity increases strongly in very pure intrinsic structures due to {{the reduction in the}} electron group velocity. Applying a magnetic field parallel to the layers shifts the conduction and valence band relative to each other in k-space and the structure turns back to an indirect semimetal. As a result we can observe a giant negative magnetoresistance. Interband absorption is observed across the minigap, and this can also be removed by the parallel field which transforms the system to an indirect band gap alignment. In high perpendicular magnetic fields strong oscillations occur in the Hall coefficient, and at low temperatures a series of zero Hall resistance states are found in which a divergence of the diagonal resistivity occurs at the same point as a zero in the Hall resistance.

40|$|The {{electronic}} structure and transmission coefficients of Si nanowires are calculated in a 3 5 model. The effect of wire thickness on the bandgap, conduction valley splitting, hole band splitting, effective masses, and transmission is demonstrated.

The one-dimensional Brillouin zone of a Si nanowire is direct gap. The conduction band minimum can split into a quartet of energies although often two of the energies are degenerate.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of PhysicsJingyu LinTime-resolved deep {{ultraviolet}} (DUV) Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy {{system has been}} employed to systematically monitor crystalline quality, identify the defects and impurities, and investigate the light emission mechanism in III-nitride semiconducting materials and photonic structures. A time correlated single photon counting system and streak camera with corresponding time resolutions of 20 and 2 ps, respectively, were utilized to study the carrier excitation and recombination dynamics. A closed cycle He-flow cryogenic system was employed for temperature dependent measurements. This system is able to handle sample temperatures {{in a wide range}} (from 10 to 900 K). Structural, electrical, and morphological properties of the material were monitored by x-ray diffraction (XRD), Hall-effect measurement, and atomic force microscopy (AFM), respectively. Most of the samples studied here were synthesized in our laboratory by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). Some samples were bulk AlN synthesized by our collaborators, which were also employed as substrates for homoepilayer growth. High quality AlN epilayers with (0002) XRD linewidth as narrow as 50 arcsec and screw type dislocation density as low as 5 x 10 [superscript] 6 cm[superscript]- 2 were grown on sapphire substrates. Free exciton transitions related to all <b>valence</b> <b>bands</b> (<b>A,</b> B, and C) were observed in AlN directly by PL, which allowed the evaluation of crystal field (Δ[subscript]CF) and spin-orbit (Δ[subscript]SO) splitting parameters exerimentally. Large negative Δ[subscript]CF and, consequently, the difficulties of light extraction from AlN and Al-rich AlGaN based emitters due to their unique optical polarization properties have been further confirmed with these new experimental data. Due to the ionic nature of III-nitrides, exciton-LO phonon Frohlich interaction is strong in these materials, which is manifested by the appearance of phonon replicas accompanying the excitonic emission lines in their PL spectra. The strength of the exciton-phonon interactions in AlN has been investigated by measuring the Huang-Rhys factor. It compares the intensity of the zero phonon (exciton emission) line relative to its phonon replica. AlN bulk single crystals, being promising native substrate for growing nitride based high quality device structures with much lower dislocation densities (< 10 [superscript] 4 cm[superscript]- 2), are also expected to be transparent in visible to UV region. However, available bulk AlN crystals always appear with an undesirable yellow or dark color. The mechanism of such undesired coloration has been investigated. MOCVD was utilized to deposit ~ 0. 5 μm thick AlN layer on top of bulk crystal. The band gap of strain free AlN homoepilayers was 6. 100 eV, which is ~ 30 meV lower compared to hetero-epitaxial layers on sapphire possessing compressive strain. Impurity incorporation was much lower in non-polar m-plane growth mode and the detected PL signal at 10 K was about an order of magnitude higher from a-plane homo-epilayers compared to that from polar c-plane epilayers. The feasibility of using Be as an alternate p-type dopant in AlN has been studied. Preliminary studies indicate that the Be acceptor level in AlN is ~ 330 meV, which is about 200 meV shallower than the Mg level in AlN. Understanding the optical and electronic properties of native point defects is the key to achieving good quality material and improving overall device performance. A more complete picture of optical transitions in AlN and GaN has been reported, which supplements the understanding of impurity transitions in AlGaN alloys described in previous reports...|$|E
