40|$|The {{feasibility}} {{of a proposed}} exhaust-gas reforming process, as applied to hydrocarbon and alcohol spark-ignition engine fuels, has been studied. In the first instance, a theoretical approach is reported. Complex chemical equilibria and energy balance software has been developed, and used to simulate exhaust-gas reforming reactions for n-heptane and methanol feedstocks. Engine combustion of reformed fuel compositions thus predicted has then been modelled by means of in-house developed cycle analysis software. An important preliminary part of the cycle simulation exercise was the calculation of reformed fuel laminar flame speed, and hence heat-release duration and commencement values. The results of the simulations have enabled comparisons of predicted engine thermal efficiency and pollutant emission levels for reformed and conventional fuelling strategies. Conclusions of the theoretical studies were sufficiently encouraging to warrant a practical investigation, and hence the design, construction and commissioning of a prototype reforming reactor and test rig are described. A test programme was then conducted, in order {{that the effect of}} various relevant parameters on reformer performance could be established. The findings of this study were encouraging in terms of the fuel compositions which could be produced, {{and in the case of}} an n-heptane feedstock, results were found to correlate well with those of the earlier predictive work. Major limitations highlighted by the practical work, however, relate to high reformer temperature requirements, and low reformed fuel generation rates.

40|$|Underhood Thermal Management {{has become}} an {{important}} topic {{for the majority of}} automotive OEM’s. To keep combustion engines cool and manage waste heat efficiently is an important part in the design of vehicles with low fuel consumption. To be able to predict cooling performance and underhood airflow with good precision within a virtual design process, it is of utmost importance to model and simulate the cooling fan efficiently and accurately, and this {{has turned out to be}} challenging. Simulating the cooling fan in a <b>vehicle</b> <b>installation</b> involves capturing complex fluid dynamic interaction between rotating blades and stationary objects in the vicinity of the fan. This interaction is a function of fan rotation rate, fan blade profile, upstream and downstream installation components. The flow is usually highly turbulent and small geometry details, like the distance between the blade tip and the fan shroud, have strong impact on the fan performance characteristics. Fan installations therefore have a large influence on cooling performance which the fan data from the supplier cannot capture. Improved simulation capabilities in this area are critical for optimizing the design of energy efficient vehicles since the performance of these fans, which provide airflow to the heat exchangers used for engine cooling and HVAC system operation, have a big impact on the vehicles' overall energy efficiency. This paper presents a comparison of two methodologies for simulating fan air flows. Multiple Reference Frame (MRF) and Sliding Mesh (SM) techniques are applied for a typical heavy duty truck fan. Simulation results are compared to experimental data obtained in a fan test rig with representation of a typical truck fan installation, including fan shroud, ring, seal and an engine silhouette downstream. Results of MRF simulations are known to be sensitive to the MRF domain, which is highly constrained in tight fan installations. For typical truck installations, SM provides a more robust alternative, and better accuracy than MRF in the transitional and radial regime of the fan curve...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} {{seventeen}} instrumented thermal sensor plugs, eight pressure transducers, two heat flux sensors, and one radiometer are {{planned to be}} utilized on the Mars 2020 missions thermal protection system (TPS) {{as part of the}} Mars Entry, Descent, and Landing Instrumentation II (MEDLI 2) project. Of the MEDLI 2 instrumentation, eleven instrumented thermal plugs and seven pressure transducers will be installed on the heatshield of the Mars 2020 vehicle while the rest will be installed on the backshell. The goal of the MEDLI 2 instrumentation is to directly inform the large performance uncertainties that contribute to the design and validation of a Mars entry system. A better understanding of the entry environment and TPS performance could lead to reduced design margins enabling a greater payload mass-fraction and smaller landing ellipses. To prove that the MEDLI 2 system will not degrade the performance of the Mars 2020 TPS, an Aerothermal Do No Harm (DNH) test series was designed and conducted. Like Mars 2020 s predecessor, Mars Science Laboratory (MSL), the heatshield material will be Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator (PICA); the Mars 2020 entry conditions are enveloped by the MSL design environments, therefore the development and qualification testing performed during MEDLI is sufficient to show that the similar MEDLI 2 heatshield instrumentation will not degrade PICA performance. However, given that MEDLI did not include any backshell instrumentation, the MEDLI 2 team was required to design and execute a DNH test series utilizing the backshell TPS material (SLA- 561 V) with the intended flight sensor suite. To meet the requirements handed down from Mars 2020, the MEDLI 2 DNH test series emphasized the interaction between the MEDLI 2 sensors and sensing locations with the surrounding backshell TPS and substrucutre. These interactions were characterized by performing environmental testing of four 12 by 12 test panels, which mimicked the construction of the backshell TPS and the integration of the MEDLI 2 sensors as seen in Figure 1. The testing included thermal vacuumcycling, random vibration, shock, and arc jet testing. The test panels were fabricated by Lockheed Martin, establishing techniques that will be utilized during the Mars 2020 <b>vehicle</b> <b>installation.</b> Each test panel included one thermal sensor plug (two embedded thermocouples), one heat flux sensor, and multiple pressure port holes for evaluation.

40|$|In todays {{automotive}} industry {{there is an}} apparent need and demand for low fuel consuming vehicles. This is a fact every automotive OEM is aware of and the heavy duty truck industry is no exception. With a cooling fan in today’s trucks that typically consumes {{of the order of}} magnitude 50 bHp fully engaged - reducing this loss is very important. Adding to this is increasingly heavy emissions legislation where a lot of the new exhaust gas aftertreatment systems requires more cooling. To fulfill this demand for cooling, increasing the ventilation and airflow through the engine bay serves as a cost effective way of at least partially reach this goal. Most easily is this done by a more powerful fan, however new legislations requires quieter fans, so today there is an apparent need for fans with higher efficiency. To design fans with a higher efficiency in complex environtments, CFD offers today a great opportunity and potential. However, computer power is still limited for solving the complete problem without any simplifying models, and this leaves the end-user heavily depending on the performance of these models. This is what is addressed in this thesis - an investigation of different fan modeling strategies and how these interact with other common CFD modeling strategies, such as turbulence models, mesh size and end-user working procedure. Main focus is kept on modeling the fan with the stationary MRF (Multiple Reference Frames) model or the transient Rigid Body Rotation model. These models are then compared to eachother on the basis of performance over time consumption. In the work comprised by this thesis it was found that {{it is very difficult to}} get the fan MRF model to perform well in a complete <b>vehicle</b> <b>installation.</b> This result was independent of choice in turbulence modeling and mesh size. The lack of performance in this model was found to be due to a limited space for fitting a valid rotational domain for the fan. It was also found that the choice of rotational domain played a major role in the behavior of this model. The MRF model was however found to be a consistent fan model in the sense that the classical fan laws still applies, hence from this conclusion it was proposed to correct the deficiency of this model with a simple speed correction. It was shown that a fan rotational speed increase of 14 % was suitable for this type of simulations with a consistent choice of rotational domain. These 14 % were tested and shown to apply to fans of different types, speeds and diameters. The fully transient (URANS) Rigid Body Rotation model performed well, even for small case sizes. It was found in this work that a small case of 3 million cells sliding mesh performed superior to a case of 16 million polyhedral cells with MRF, noteworthy is that the latter consumed twice as any CPU-hours for converging...|$|E

With {{a cooling fan}} in today’s trucks that typically consumes {{of the order of}} magnitude 50 bHp fully engaged – reducing this loss is very important. In addition a lot of the new after treatment systems requires a higher airflow through the engine bay, and new legislations requires quieter fans, i. e. today {{there is a need for}} fans with higher efficiency. To reach these needs CFD offers great potential. However since computer power is still limited for resolving transient Navier-Stokes equations without any turbulence models and in a mesh-independent domain - one relies heavily on the performance of simplified assumptions and models. This is also what is addressed in this paper – an investigation of different fan modelling strategies and how these interfere with turbulence models and mesh-size. Main focus is on modelling the fan with MRF (Multiple Reference Frames, stationary) and its behaviour compared to resolving the fan rotation in a rigid body rotation (transient). The turbulence models investigated is a number of the standard two equation models. In the work comprised by this paper it was found that it is very difficult to get the fan MRF model to perform well in a complete <b>vehicle</b> <b>installation,</b> this due to a limited space for fitting a valid rotational domain for the fan – independent of choice of turbulence model and mesh size. Fully transient (URANS) sliding mesh approach performs well, even for small case sizes. It was found that a small transient case could outperform a well resolved stationary simulation, still consuming less CPU hours then the stationary. Referring to the context of this work, the authors do not claim to deliver the final answer to fan modelling techniques. For the sliding mesh runs, a 2 % discrepancy of measured pressure for a fixed air-flow was achieved in working points close to the fan’s design point. This would typically convert to a 1 % error in mass flow in a case where the flow is not fixed by the boundary conditions,. i. e in a typical full vehicle under hood environment. In the fan stalling and fan transition regions, though, discrepancy was larger. However these areas are, to the authors’ knowledge and experience, hard to measure with good repetition, so a numerical issue in these regions is to be expected as well. More effort needs still to be made on producing more elaborate experimental data, not just measured for the system, but also component data such as radiator coefficients, larger meshes and more turbulence models should be evaluated in transient mode in order to predict these regions better. In conclusion, though, this paper gives a clear hint on what type of fan modelling strategy can be worth considering for UTM simulations in the upcoming future...|$|E
