5|$|Aerophones, {{which produce}} a sound with a <b>vibrating</b> column of air; they {{are sorted into}} free aerophones such as a bullroarer or whip, which move freely through the air; flutes, which cause the air to pass over a sharp edge; reed instruments, which use a <b>vibrating</b> reed; and lip-vibrated aerophones such as trumpets, for which the lips {{themselves}} function as <b>vibrating</b> reeds.|$|E
5|$|Andre Schaeffner, {{a curator}} at the Musée de l'Homme, {{disagreed}} with the Hornbostel-Sachs system and developed his own system in 1932. Schaeffner believed that the pure physics of a musical instrument, rather than its specific construction or playing method, should always determine its classification. (Hornbostel-Sachs, for example, divide aerophones {{on the basis of}} sound production, but membranophones {{on the basis of the}} shape of the instrument). His system divided instruments into two categories: instruments with solid, <b>vibrating</b> bodies and instruments containing <b>vibrating</b> air.|$|E
5|$|Idiophones, {{which produce}} sound by <b>vibrating</b> the primary {{body of the}} {{instrument}} itself; they are sorted into concussion, percussion, shaken, scraped, split, and plucked idiophones, such as claves, xylophone, guiro, slit drum, mbira, and rattle.|$|E

A relay connector is available for connecting standard consumer cables to the automotive type.|$|E
5|$|Membranophones, {{which produce}} sound by a <b>vibrating</b> a {{stretched}} membrane; {{they may be}} drums (further sorted by {{the shape of the}} shell), which are struck by hand, with a stick, or rubbed, but kazoos and other instruments that use a stretched membrane for the primary sound (not simply to modify sound produced in another way) are also considered membranophones.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Swinton O. Scott III. In the opening shot of the episode, the bus that the children travel in to the field trip had to vibrate up and down {{to give the impression}} that it did not have bumpers and that it was falling apart. Scott said it was difficult to animate the scene because of the <b>vibrating</b> and the backgrounds panning. Milhouse's tutor in the episode is based on the American actor Tony Randall.|$|E

5|$|Z.sexpunctatus males exhibit ritualized agonistic {{behavior}} when encountering other {{males of}} the same species. This behavior may include many {{of the same}} elements as courtship, such as raising and spreading the first pair of legs and <b>vibrating</b> the abdomen. During agonistic display, males will also extend their pedipalps and fangs. Lethal attacks between males appear to be rare, however.|$|E
5|$|After scrutinizing {{the effects}} of light and color on forms, the Impressionists {{concluded}} that local color—an object's true color in white light— becomes modified {{by the quality of}} the light shining on it, by reflections from other objects, and by the effects juxtaposed colors produce. Shadows do not appear gray or black, as many earlier painters thought, but are composed of colors modified by reflections or other conditions. Using various colors and short choppy brush strokes, Monet was able to catch accurately the <b>vibrating</b> quality of light.|$|E
5|$|Chordophones, {{which produce}} sound by <b>vibrating</b> {{one or more}} strings; they are sorted into {{according}} {{to the relationship between}} the string(s) and the sounding board or chamber. For example, if the strings are laid out parallel to the sounding board and there is no neck, the instrument is a zither whether it is plucked like an autoharp or struck with hammers like a piano. If the instrument has strings parallel to the sounding board or chamber and the strings extend past the board with a neck, then the instrument is a lute, whether the sound chamber is constructed of wood like a guitar or uses a membrane like a banjo.|$|E
50|$|Relief, or profile, {{refers to}} the amount of {{curvature}} in the fingerboard of a guitar or other similar stringed instrument. When the strings of a guitar <b>vibrate,</b> they <b>vibrate</b> in an elliptical shape. Thus, providing the best possible action requires that the guitar fingerboard have a slight curve to allow the strings to <b>vibrate</b> freely. Incorrect relief may cause fret buzz.|$|R

50|$|In {{the bass}} register, a second factor {{affecting}} the inharmonicity is the resonance {{caused by the}} acoustic impedance of the piano sounding board. These resonances exhibit positive feedback on the inharmonic effect: if a string <b>vibrates</b> at a frequency just below that of a resonance, the impedance makes it <b>vibrate</b> even lower, and if it <b>vibrates</b> just above a resonance, the impedance makes it <b>vibrate</b> higher. The sounding board has multiple resonant frequencies that are unique to any particular piano. This contributes to the greater variance in the empirically measured Railsback curve in the lower octaves.|$|R

Some games {{attempted to}} incorporate elements of first person shooter or survival horror games {{through the use of}} less restricted character movement and exploration, with varying degrees of success. Others, however, unashamedly paid homage to 1990s arcade gameplay, even embracing a somewhat parodic style. Light guns are not compatible with modern high-definition televisions, leading developers to experiment with hybrid controllers, particularly with the Wii Remote for the Wii, as well as the PlayStation 3's GunCon 3 peripheral used with Time Crisis 4. Others have used the PlayStation Move motion control system.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, while {{orbiting}} the Earth during a routine space mission with his crew, Colonel John Jameson and his ship are {{hit by a}} meteor shower. John struggles to get the ship back safely on Earth but eventually succeeds in landing it at Cape Canaveral. The next day, Jonah learns that the Globes cover story on the Goblin's rampage—featuring Peter's photos—is outselling the Bugles story on John's heroic space journey. An infuriated Jameson decides {{to meet with the}} public's demand by publishing a new cover story questioning if Spider-Man is a hero or a menace. Meanwhile, John is interviewed at the shuttle hangar when he spots a mysterious, <b>vibrating</b> black goo {{on the bottom of the}} shuttle.|$|E
5|$|Spoken {{language}} {{relies on}} human physical {{ability to produce}} sound, which is a longitudinal wave propagated through the air at a frequency capable of <b>vibrating</b> the ear drum. This ability depends on the physiology of the human speech organs. These organs consist of the lungs, the voice box (larynx), and the upper vocal tract– the throat, the mouth, and the nose. By controlling the {{different parts of the}} speech apparatus, the airstream can be manipulated to produce different speech sounds.|$|E

5|$|To attract mates, some teleosts produce sounds, {{either by}} stridulation or by <b>vibrating</b> the swim bladder. In the Sciaenidae, the muscles that {{attached}} to the swim blabber cause it to oscillate rapidly, creating drumming sounds. Marine catfishes, sea horses and grunts stridulate by rubbing together skeletal parts, teeth or spines. In these fish, the swim bladder may act as a resonator. Stridulation sounds are predominantly from 1000–4000 Hz, though sounds modified by the swim bladder have frequencies lower than 1000Hz.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 The Scientific World Journal {{published}} research {{in which women}} with long-term problems achieving orgasm were instructed using documentation from Betty Dodson. They said the Magic Wand's large head effectively created a <b>vibrating</b> sensation {{in the area of}} the clitoris and vulva without superficial discomfort. Their research showed that more than 93% of a group of 500 chronically anorgasmic women could reach orgasm using Magic Wand and the Betty Dodson Method. The Scientific World Journal research was subsequently discussed in a literature review published in 2010 by The Journal of Sexual Medicine. Bat Sheva Marcus published a 2011 article in The Journal of Sexual Medicine after introducing women to the Magic Wand as a way to increase her subjects' levels of sexual experience and assess changes in their sexual expectations.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the first}} welding process, forge welding, some modern welding methods {{do not involve}} the melting of the {{materials}} being joined. One of the most popular, ultrasonic welding, is used to connect thin sheets or wires made of metal or thermoplastic by <b>vibrating</b> them at high frequency and under high pressure. The equipment and methods involved are {{similar to that of}} resistance welding, but instead of electric current, vibration provides energy input. Welding metals with this process does not involve melting the materials; instead, the weld is formed by introducing mechanical vibrations horizontally under pressure. When welding plastics, the materials should have similar melting temperatures, and the vibrations are introduced vertically. Ultrasonic welding is commonly used for making electrical connections out of aluminum or copper, and it is also a very common polymer welding process.|$|E

50|$|Tissot, a Swiss luxury watchmaker, {{makes the}} Silen-T {{wristwatch}} with a touch-sensitive face that <b>vibrates</b> {{to help the}} user to tell time eyes-free. The bezel of the watch features raised bumps at each hour mark; after briefly touching {{the face of the}} watch, the wearer runs a finger around the bezel clockwise. When the finger reaches the bump indicating the hour, the watch <b>vibrates</b> continuously, and when the finger reaches the bump indicating the minute, the watch <b>vibrates</b> intermittently.|$|R
5|$|Once {{the athlete}} has taken flight, {{characteristics}} {{similar to that}} of a glider come into force. Ski flyers are able to cover such tremendous distances and land safely primarily due to the skis they use, which are substantially wider and longer than their cross-country or Alpine skiing counterparts. Each ski is first attached securely {{at the front of the}} boot, which has an exaggerated forward slant; the heel is then attached to a wedge on the ski using a hinged binding peg or strap with a maximum length of , allowing the athlete to lean forward into their preferred aerodynamic position and spread the skis wide apart. Much like aircraft wings, the skis are flexible to an extent, resulting in them bending and <b>vibrating</b> significantly upon takeoff. Maintaining stability in the air is paramount: a loss of balance, or a differential pressure under the skis, can lead to disaster (see list of ski flying accidents). A few athletes have a natural tendency to drift over to one side of the hill, invariably shortening their jump distance.|$|E
5|$|String {{theory is}} a {{theoretical}} framework that attempts to reconcile gravity and quantum mechanics. In string theory, the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. String theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other. In a given version of string theory, {{there is only one}} kind of string, which may look like a small loop or segment of ordinary string, and it can vibrate in different ways. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string will look just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. In this way, all of the different elementary particles may be viewed as <b>vibrating</b> strings. One of the vibrational states of a string gives rise to the graviton, a quantum mechanical particle that carries gravitational force.|$|E
5|$|The player flies {{around in}} a fighter with a first-person, in-cockpit view with a fully {{customizable}} fixed head-up display (HUD) as the visual interface. The HUD displays video communications and relevant data on the ship's status and performance, weapons, objectives, and targets. It can also warn players from which direction missiles are locking onto them from, thus becoming an aide for launching countermeasures or taking evasive maneuvers. Players have to maneuver into position and shoot through both shields and hull to destroy enemy ships. While hull damage is unrecoverable, shields recharge over time. With the game supporting force feedback technology, joystick players will find their controllers <b>vibrating</b> or putting up resistance when they engage the afterburners or collide with objects. Similarly, certain events, such as engaging afterburners and firing powerful weapons, will shake the screen {{as a form of}} visual feedback.|$|E
50|$|Isaac Newton had {{associated}} {{the seven}} solfège syllables with the seven colours {{of the rainbow}} and surmised that each colour <b>vibrated</b> accordingly (a concept possibly related to the modern view of chromesthesia). Thus, red has {{the least amount of}} vibration while violet <b>vibrates</b> the most.|$|R
50|$|In a {{phenomenon}} called sympathetic vibration, a string seems to <b>vibrate</b> by itself. This happens when sound waves strike the string at a frequency {{close to the}} string's fundamental pitch or one of its overtones. The string is connected to this similar sound wave through the air, which picks up the vibrations of the sound waves at the same frequency, and in turn causes the string to <b>vibrate</b> on its own. When an outside source applies forced vibration that matches a string's natural frequency, the string <b>vibrates.</b>|$|R
