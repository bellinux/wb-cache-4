40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present data from a novel vertical flow mine water treatment system, demonstrate how these data can be used to generate sizing formulae for this technology, and present a comparison between the size of system based on these formulae and those of conventionally designed passive systems. The paper focuses on passive treatment of circum-neutral ferruginous mine waters bearing up to 50 mg l− 1 of iron in either ferrous or ferric form. The Vertical Flow Reactor (<b>VFR)</b> <b>operates</b> by passing mine water down through an accreting bed of ochre, the ochre bed being responsible for the intensification of iron removal by self-filtration and/or autocatalytic iron oxidation and precipitation. Key to the design and operation of the VFR system is the decrease in permeability in this ochre bed over time. The paper demonstrates that the VFR system can remove iron at many times the 10 g/m 2 /day removal rate – an often employed figure for the sizing of aerobic settling ponds and wetlands. The paper demonstrates that VFRs are viable and novel passive treatment system for mine waters with a smaller footprint than conventional systems...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the methodology and results of research undertaken into the rates and mechanisms of iron oxidation both in field and laboratory environments. The field based {{aspects of the}} research entailed the collection and analysis of hydrological, hydrogeochemical, and mineralogical data from two parallel treatment systems. Both systems were treating identical ferruginous, circum-neutral, coal-mine drainage, from the Taff Merthyr site, South Wales. During this study a novel pilot scale passive Vertical Flow Reactor (VFR) was trialled against a conventional settlement lagoon {{and the performance of}} both systems was compared. The second research aspect focuses on the determination of heterogeneous Fe(II) oxidation rates under laboratory conditions. Experiments were carried out under varying pH, and catalytic surface concentration and type. An analytical method was developed which allowed for the determination of both dissolved and sorbed Fe(II). The results of the field study have shown that the VFR system is capable of removing Fe at a rate greatly in excess of a conventional settlement lagoon. This therefore drastically reduces the treatment area required. In addition, due to the heterogeneous method by which the <b>VFR</b> <b>operates</b> (passing mine- water down through a bed of ochre solid), highly efficient manganese removal was also achieved. The laboratory study has shown that significant catalysis of Fe(II) oxidation can be achieved under mildly acidic pH conditions making Fe(II) oxidation (and therefore passive mine-water treatment) feasible under these conditions. Evidence is also presented for the adsorption of non-oxidisable Fe(II) onto Fe(III) (hydroxy) oxides under mildly-acidic pH conditions. A comparison was then made between field and laboratory results and a conceptual model was produced to describe the observed adsorption and oxidation characteristics.

50|$|It is {{important}} not to confuse IFR with IMC. A significant amount of IFR flying is conducted in Visual Meteorological Conditions (VMC). Anytime a flight is operating in VMC and in a volume of airspace in which <b>VFR</b> traffic can <b>operate,</b> the crew is responsible for seeing and avoiding VFR traffic; however, because the flight is conducted under Instrument Flight Rules, ATC still provides separation services from other IFR traffic, and can in many cases also advise the crew of the location of VFR traffic near the flight path.|$|R

40|$|This is an Accepted Manuscript of {{an article}} {{published}} by Taylor & Francis in Tribology Transactions on 4 th April 2016, available online: [URL] are a very few studies of bidirectional gas seals particularly those with certain profiles used in the industry. Parametric study of performance of bidirectional dry gas seals under a set of operating conditions is presented. The expounded approaches uses solution of 3 D Navier-Stokes momentum and continuity equations for various forms of grooved gas seals, particular for the trapezoidal shape variety for which {{there has been a}} particular dearth of in-depth analysis. It is shown that such groove geometries enhance the load carrying capacity of the seal through increased hydrodynamic lift. This is as the result of enhanced localised wedge flow particularly with a reduced seal gap. Therefore, there is the opportunity of gap minimisation, whilst reducing leakage rate and power loss. For given operating loading, kinematic and thermal conditions as well as seal geometry and topography, the <b>operating</b> <b>minimum</b> film thickness may be considered as the main design parameter...|$|R
