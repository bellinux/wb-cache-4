50|$|This main {{principle}} {{is illustrated in}} the figure of the rolling cylinders. If two equal cylinders are pressed together then the contact surface is flat. In the absence of surface friction, contact stresses are normal (i.e. perpendicular) to the contact surface. Consider a particle that enters the contact area at the right side, travels through the contact patch and leaves at the left side. Initially its <b>vertical</b> <b>deformation</b> is increasing, which is resisted by the hysteresis effect. Therefore, an additional pressure is generated to avoid interpenetration of the two surfaces. Later its <b>vertical</b> <b>deformation</b> is decreasing. This is again resisted by the hysteresis effect. In this case this decreases the pressure that is needed to keep the two bodies separate.|$|E
30|$|We then {{estimated}} the seasonal deformations due to poroelastic deformations of the aquifers below 190 m from the equivalent GPS/SM time series. As shown in Fig. 3, the estimated poroelastic deformations have a peak-to-peak amplitude of about 1 cm. Originally, the vertical coordinate time series of surface GPS stations in Tsukuba show seasonal <b>vertical</b> <b>deformations</b> with a peak-to-peak amplitude of about 2 cm (Munekane et al., 2004) and, accordingly, {{the observation of}} 06 S 061 will contain {{only half of the}} entire seasonal <b>vertical</b> <b>deformations</b> caused by groundwater extraction.|$|R
30|$|Unfortunately, the {{coordinate}} {{time series}} of 06 S 061 {{is too short}} to extract seasonal poroelastic deformations of aquifers. Alternatively, we combined different types of observations to yield equivalent vertical coordinate time series of the <b>vertical</b> <b>deformations</b> caused by aquifers below 190 m; we subtracted the <b>vertical</b> <b>deformations</b> of 06 S 061, measured by the subsidence meter, which are the thickness changes of the top soil up {{to a depth of}} 190 m, from those of a nearby GPS station, TSKB. Hereafter, we refer to the obtained time series as the “GPS/Subsidence Meter” (GPS/SM) time series.|$|R

50|$|Frontogenesis is a {{meteorological}} {{process of}} tightening of horizontal temperature gradients to produce fronts. In the end, {{two types of}} fronts form: cold fronts and warm fronts. A cold front is a narrow line where temperature decreases rapidly. A warm front is a narrow line of warmer temperatures and essentially {{where much of the}} precipitation occurs. Frontogenesis occurs {{as a result of a}} developing baroclinic wave. According to Hoskins & Bretherton (1972, p. 11), there are eight mechanisms that influence temperature gradients: horizontal deformation, horizontal shearing, <b>vertical</b> <b>deformation,</b> differential vertical motion, latent heat release, surface friction, turbulence and mixing, and radiation. Semigeostrophic frontogenesis theory focuses on the role of horizontal deformation and shear.|$|E
50|$|The EPGFZ shares {{approximately}} half of the relative motion between the North American and Caribbean tectonic plates with the Septentrional-Oriente fault zone which runs along the northern side of Hispaniola. Both faults merge into the Cayman Trench to the west. The fault accommodates about 20.6±1.66 millimeters of lateral motion per year (mm/yr). Additionally, a component of compression is present as the North American Plate pushes toward the southwest. This results in <b>vertical</b> <b>deformation</b> manifest in the mountainous terrain of Hispaniola. Some researchers believe that the EPGFZ and the Septentrional-Orient fault zone bound a microplate, dubbed the Gonâve Microplate, a 190000 km2 area of the northern Caribbean Plate that {{is in the process of}} shearing off the Caribbean Plate and accreting to the North America Plate.|$|E

Density, moisture content, and sieve analysis tests were carried out before and after the experiment. Deflections and <b>vertical</b> <b>deformations</b> were measured frequently after specified intervals of loading.

30|$|We {{expect that}} 06 S 061 is less {{affected}} by seasonal poroelastic deformations of aquifers {{since it is}} fixed in the soil {{at a depth of}} 190 m. However, it may still be affected, if at all, by the poroelastic deformations of aquifers below 190 m. Hence, we should evaluate the magnitude of seasonal <b>vertical</b> <b>deformations</b> caused by such deformations.|$|R

30|$|We first {{evaluated}} the observation quality of GPS station 06 S 061, which was installed {{to reduce the}} effect of seasonal <b>vertical</b> <b>deformations</b> associated with groundwater extraction. We compared the GPS-derived <b>vertical</b> <b>deformations</b> between 06 S 061 and the surrounding GPS stations with those measured by independent observations. As shown in Table 1, these are in good agreement; the RMS and maximum amplitude {{of the differences between}} GPS solutions and independent observations of the vertical movements of surrounding GPS stations relative to 06 S 061 have the same magnitude as the deviations in the GPS-derived vertical displacements between 92110 and 960627. Therefore, we conclude that the refurbishment of 06 S 061 to overcome multipath from the roof and water droplets formed inside the radome (Munekane et al., 2009) worked as expected and that the observation quality of 06 S 061 has become comparable to that of standard GPS stations. The remaining differences between GPS solutions and independent observations of the short baselines might be due to multipath or phase center model errors at either stations. Further study to quantitatively evaluate these errors (e.g. King and Williams, 2009) will help improve the observation quality of the GPS stations.|$|R

This indicates that the four trackbeds with asphalt layer could decrease the maximum <b>vertical</b> <b>deformation</b> at subgrade surface, and the deformation of T 3 was slightly greater than the other three structures. During the calculation period, the maximum vertical deformations of T 1, T 2, T 3, and T 4 were 2.055, 2.049, 2.105  mm (max), and 2.038  mm, respectively. At {{the end of the}} calculation, the vertical deformations were 0.661, 0.706, 0.786, and 0.792  mm (max), which shows that T 1 and T 2 are more appropriate for railway asphalt trackbeds than the other two in terms of <b>vertical</b> <b>deformation.</b>|$|E

In ESISTEM approach, both surrounding InSAR and GPS measurements {{can be used as}} constraints in deriving surface displacements; while only surrounding GPS measurements are used in SISTEM approach.

40|$|Useful {{prediction}} of catastrophic eruption {{needs to be}} available on a time scale of hours to days. Applications of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to volcanological problems, especially those related to hazard prediction have concentrated on <b>vertical</b> <b>deformations</b> of the earth's surface (e. g., Massonnet and Sigmundsson, 2000; Zebker et al., 2000). When <b>vertical</b> <b>deformations</b> are related to near-surface dyke intrusion, as at Reunion in 1998 (Sigmundsson et al., 1999) or Fernandina in 1995 (Zebker et al., 2000), the time scale to eruption can reach into the range of days, or even less. But this type of deformation usually is related to movement of magma at deeper levels and provides only a general warning that eruption may occur {{over a period of}} months or even years. However, some types of violent volcanic eruptions, such as Mount St, Helens in 1980 (Lipman and Mullineaux, 1981) and Bezymianni in 1956, are more characterized by horizontal deformation prior to eruption. Siebert (1987) has estimated that this type of collapse occurs about four times per century world-wide.
