40|$|Abstract: The {{rapid growth}} in demand for {{cellular}} telephony coupled to the limited bandwidth allocated to the air interface, has encouraged researchers to find technological solutions {{to increase the number}} of usable channels. The various techniques developed invariably involve installation of new infrastructure. While such strategies enable the networks to meet peak-hour demand, they inevitably leave the network resources idle in off-peak hours. In this context dynamic pricing (the <b>variation</b> <b>of</b> <b>price</b> according to system utilisation) could potentially offer a “soft edge ” scheme for achieving a more efficient use of available resources. This article presents predicted (GSM) network behaviour under a dynamic pricing regime. Simulation results indicate a strong correlation between the shape of the price function, the number of blocked calls in the system and the expected revenue. These suggest that dynamic pricing could be used very effectively to regulate demand whilst offering a sensible means for revenue optimisation. 1. Introduction...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} theory of {{sharecropping}} {{on the basis of}} price behavior in agriculture and imperfectly competitive nature of rural product markets. We consider a contractual setting between one landlord and one tenant with seasonal <b>variation</b> <b>of</b> <b>price,</b> where the tenant receives a low price for his output while the landlord can sell his output at a higher price by incurring a cost of storage. We consider two different classes of contracts: (i) tenancy contracts and (ii) crop-buying contracts. It is shown that sharecropping is the optimal form within tenancy contracts and it also dominates crop-buying contracts provided the price variation is not too large. Then we consider interlinked contracts that have both tenancy and crop-buying elements and show that there are multiple optimal interlinked contracts. Finally, proposing an equilibrium refinement that incorporates imperfect competition in the rural product market, it is shown that the unique contract that is robust to this refinement results in sharecropping. ...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to develop {{predictions}} regarding market consequences of peer effects in higher education and to offer empirical evidence about the extent to which those predictions are borne out in the data. We develop a model in which colleges seek to maximize the quality of the educational experience provided to their students. From this model we deduce predictions about the hierarchy of schools that emerges in equilibrium, the allocation of students by income and ability among schools, and about the pricing policies that schools adopt. In the empirical analysis, we use both university-level data provided primarily by Petersons and student-level data from the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study obtained from the NCES. The findings of this paper suggest that there is a hierarchy of school qualities which is characterized by substantial stratification by income and ability. The evidence on pricing by ability is supportive of positive peer effects in educational achievement from high ability at the college level. However, the evidence on pricing also suggests that more highly ranked schools exercise some degree of market power. This is reflected in the substantial <b>variation</b> <b>of</b> <b>price</b> with income coupled with discounts to more able students that are modest at best. ...|$|E

40|$|Flexibility {{in prices}} is {{generally}} {{assumed to be}} a key factor in gaining competitive advantage in sectors like the supermarket grocery stores. However, changing prices frequently is a costly exercise for retailers. The degree of price rigidity is therefore determined by this need to respond to changing market conditions as well as the inherent costs of changing prices. This tension makes the degree of price rigidity of great empirical importance to marketers and economists. To this end, this thesis empirically explores price rigidity in the supermarket grocery sector. It investigates price rigidity using observational price data over a period of 52 weeks, across 11 categories including almost one hundred SKUs, and from three different stores in a Montreal area. Price rigidity is estimated both in temporary (sales price) as well as more permanent price changes (regular price). It also investigates asymmetries in price rigidities. The general results show a surprisingly high degree of price rigidity with a higher rigidity in permanent price changes being complemented by a compensatory flexibility in sales prices. Prices remain unchanged for more than 9 weeks on the average for sales price, and more than 14 weeks on average for regular prices. We also find some evidence of asymmetric price rigidity, although limited and not statistically significant within the constraint of the limited dataset. The patterns suggest that both store and category level factors could be important sources of <b>variation</b> <b>of</b> <b>price</b> rigidity. This calls for more research into their respective roles...|$|E
40|$|Tools and {{industrial}} moulds {{are used by}} industries such as the metal stamping, die-casting and plastics moulding industries to give the final form to the products they manufacture. Manufacturing of tools and moulds influences the entire production {{of a large number}} of components, subassemblies and assemblies in many sectors, like motor vehicles, electronics, appliances, packaging. Short lead times, continuous changes in quantity and quality of orders and absence of correct work methods may cause fluctuations up to 40 percent between the pre and post calculation cost (and consequently <b>variation</b> <b>of</b> <b>price).</b> In the lapse of time between customer offer and mould production costs could vary up to 30 %; thus time dynamic costs, such as material cost and labor cost must be expected to reach a correct estimation of final price. A possible solution of the problem of miscalculation depending on disregarding time-dynamic costs is the integration of stock-market related pricing methods in the tool and mould manufacturing industry. Based on the described problems, the focus of this thesis is to establish a method to integrate time-dynamics costs, such as material costs or external labor, in the price estimation of the tool and mould manufacturing industries, to reduce price fluctuations. To forecast time-dynamic costs, furthermore, a method to integrate stock-market related pricing mechanisms in the tool and mould manufacturing industry will be developed. These objectives are based on the idea that the price estimation process could be optimized with the integration of time-dynamics costs and their prediction based on stock-market related mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{sheds light}} onto the {{integration}} of renewable energy generation into electricity markets based on five articles. The first article {{is concerned with the}} optimal strategies of renewable producers selling electricity in sequential markets. A model is developed in which renewable generators trade their production in two sequential markets, which can be regarded as the day-ahead and intraday markets. Trading in the first market takes place under uncertainty about the final production level of renewable generation. The results show that it might be optimal for renewable producers to sell less than the expected quantity in the day-ahead market. The second article focuses on the high variability in production from renewable electricity and its effect on prices. A model for the allocation of hourly and quarter-hourly electricity generation is developed, assuming that the participation in the market for quarter-hourly products is restricted. Restricted participation in the market for quarter-hourly products may have caused welfare losses of about EUR 96 million in 2015. In the third article, the hourly price elasticity of demand for electricity in the German day-ahead market is empirically estimated. The results indicate a high level of <b>variation</b> <b>of</b> <b>price</b> elasticity of demand throughout the day ranging from - 0. 02 to - 0. 13 depending on the time of the day in the German day-ahead market in 2015. The fourth article is concerned with the tariff design in retail markets for electricity. It focuses on the inefficiency from time-invariant pricing in combination with an increasing share of renewable energies. The last article finally takes {{a closer look at the}} balancing power market and the impact of different market designs on efficiency and competition. Based on a developed model, it shows that shorter tender frequencies could lower the costs of balancing power procurement by up to 15 %. While market concentration decreases in many markets with shorter provision duration, there are also cases in the model where shorter time spans lead to higher concentration...|$|E

However, theoretical version made sufficiently a rough out line for the function of economic activities. From the economic fitness of some rapid hypotheses of each type of economic environment, background, period, etc., this would transform the economic model as a theoretical basis to a concrete one. For the analysis of price determination in case of a small open economy, the external price plays a key role as one exogenous variable in this determination, given the exchange rate. This paper had concentrated on the transmission of the variation of external price or the external inflation, as one of exogenous shocks, to the analysis of domestic inflation. Under the hypotheses of different degree of dependence on international economy for each sector in the economy and passive economic policy, it was possible to analyze this transmission through the <b>variation</b> <b>of</b> <b>price</b> of sector which received mainly and directly the influence of external price. Lately, the price of rest sector in the economy gets also the influence but through the cost adjustment. As an economy composed only of these two sectors, the determination of domestic inflation depends as weighted average on the inflation of these two sectors, given the constant participation of each sector in the entire economy. Tradicionalmente, um estudo sobre inflação se associa mais aos papéis de excesso da demanda agregada e/ou de contraição do mercado. Todavia, após a variação dos preços externos existe muita dúvida quanto a análise dos fatores principais á inflação doméstica, principalmente na economia dependente. Obviamente a economia com maior grau de dependência recebe mais influência das variações externas tais como choques externos, em comparação com a economia que tem um grau menor. Nesse ponto, a característica de economia aberta e pequena é uma alternativa eficiente a ser considerada no estudo sobre influência externa na inflação doméstica. Nesse ramo ê possível concluir que há, pelo menos, três fatores que determinam inflação interna - choques externos, estruturais e políticos. Os dois últimos são fatores que explicam como a inflação interna se desvia da externa...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Copper Ni-Ti (CuNiTi) wires have {{indications}} of specific clinical use and should therefore express the mechanical and thermodynamic characteristics reported by manufacturers. With {{the fall of}} the production patent, several companies began to manufacture these wires with great <b>variation</b> <b>of</b> <b>price,</b> process of manufacture and possibly of quality. Objectives: In order to verify the properties of these wires, this work aims to characterize mechanically, thermodynamically and chemically CuNiTi commercial wires. Materials and Methods: The sample consisted of 40 precontoured, thermodynamic arches with addition of copper, dimensions of 0. 017 "x 0. 025 " with Af temperature of 35 °C, from 5 manufacturers, American Orthodontics® (G 1), Eurodonto® (G 2), Morelli® (G 3), Ormco® (G 4) e Orthometric® (G 5), 8 wires of each one. The wires underwent a standardization test of their dimensions, tensile tests, MEV-EDS and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) test. Due to the small variability inherent of the mechanical tests in wires, parametric tests (ANOVA OneWay and Tukey post test) were used, considering a significance level of 5 %. Results: All wires presented standardized dimensions of 0. 017 "x 0. 025 ". In the tensile test, all presented superelastic behavior with SE rate higher than 8 and the following means of force plateau - G 1 36, 49 N; G 2 27, 34 N; G 3 19, 24 N; G 4 37, 54 N; e G 5 17, 87 N. In the DSC assay, the means of Af for G 1 (29. 40 °C), G 2 (29. 13 °C) and G 3 (31. 43 °C), had p> 0. 05 relative to each other. G 4 (32. 77 °C) and G 5 (35. 17 °C) presented statistically significant differences between themselves and among the other groups, with p 0, 05 entre si. G 4 (32, 77 °C) e G 5 (35, 17 °C) apresentaram diferenças estatisticamente significativas entre si e entre os outros grupos, com p< 0, 05.

40|$|In Krugman (1991), {{agglomeration}} {{is driven}} by consumption externalities related to differences in the average price across locations. Variety plays a central role here: the price index is lower in larger cities because more varieties are produced there, but all products are available everywhere, {{so there are no}} direct consumption gains from variety. Chapter 1 extends this model to allow for these variety differences across cities via an extensive margin of intercity trade. In this model, scale economies yield more production variety in larger cities so that, with positive trade costs, consumers in these locations can benefit from two consumption advantages - lower average prices and more varieties of products. This model sets the stage for the empirical chapters that measure the impact of these consumption benefits on consumer utility. The urban economics literature has paid relatively little attention to these consumption externalities for two reasons. First, the fact that wages are higher in larger cities indicates, {{in the context of a}} spatial equilibrium model, that purchasing power must be lower in these locations, which is inconsistent with the NEG theoretical predictions that price indexes are lower in larger cities. Second, there are reasons to believe that intranational trade frictions are much smaller than those across international borders. While there is a large body of work documenting that these frictions yield significant variation in the prices charged and varieties offered across different countries, we know relatively little about the spatial <b>variation</b> <b>of</b> <b>price</b> and variety in a domestic context. Chapter 2, co-authored with David E. Weinstein, addresses both of these issues. We first show that, controlling for purchaser demographics and store amenities, the prices of tradable products do, in fact, vary across cities as predicted by Krugman (1991). Additionally, we find that there are significant differences in the variety of products offered in large as opposed to small cities. We finally measure the extent to which this variation in prices and variety lowers price indexes for tradable products in large cities relative to small cities. This low price index over tradables in large cities is consistent with nominal wages being higher there, as long as there are congestion costs that equalize real income across locations. A major assumption in the work described above is that the consumption benefits of cities do not vary systematically across consumer types. The final chapter of my dissertation considers how systematic differences in prices and variety across space might impact different individuals differently. Previous research has tested whether firms vary prices and product offerings in order to cater local tastes in a market. I extend this analysis to structurally estimate how this behavior of individual firms differentially affects the price indexes faced by consumers with systematically heterogeneous tastes. I allow for tastes to vary with income and find that poor consumers face lower costs in low-income cities, while the opposite holds for wealthy consumers, whose tastes are better-suited to the variety of products available in high-income cities. In conclusion, this dissertation finds that there is significant variation in prices and variety across U. S. cities. In particular, the spatial distributions of prices, variety, and consumers in the U. S. are correlated in a manner consistent with there being consumption externalities. Consumers in larger cities have access to more varieties of products at a lower average price and, conditional on city size, consumers have access to varieties better-suited to the tastes of they share with their income group in cities with per capita incomes closer to their own. These patterns are reflected in the variation in the tradables price indexes that consumers face across large and small and across wealthy and poor cities. This evidence on the existence of the pecuniary consumption externalities hypothesized in early NEG papers supports a growing literature exploring the role of consmption externalities in generating the aggregate and skill-biased agglomeration patterns that the more recent NEG literature associates with production externalities...|$|E
