30|$|Forty {{photographs}} {{of male and}} female professional black models were collected. Observers were asked to assign a score from 1 to 10 (1 = not <b>very</b> <b>attractive,</b> 10 = <b>very</b> <b>attractive).</b> A total of 287 responses were analysed for grading behaviour according to various demographic factors by two groups of observers. The best graded photographs were compared with the least well-graded photographs to identify any differences in their facial ratios. The models’ facial ratios were calculated and compared with the golden proportion.|$|R

40|$|In {{many cases}} {{at school and}} at {{universities}} most of the learners consider the topic of algorithms as hard and not <b>very</b> <b>attractive.</b> <b>Very</b> often the focus of traditional courses is on learning specific algorithms that are considered as important in education or in practice. Often these algorithms are sequential algorithms. We show in contrast to these courses a way of learning principles and concepts of algorithms that {{is much easier to}} comprehend by the learners and makes them more fun. The idea is that we do involve as many students as possible in playing algorithms that are moreover usually proposed by them. The task of the teacher is to give proper problem statements and to ask proper questions to keep the students thinking to create working algorithms that solve these problems. The teacher also motivates the students to improve their algorithms to find more efficient solutions. Compared to a theatre play the students have the roles of the actors and the idea deliverers and the teacher has the role of the stage manager. We give two examples: The first example is the calculation of a maximal value of a set of values, where each student represents a value. Parallel activities may improve the efficiency of th...|$|R

40|$|The core {{advantage}} of sort last rendering is the theoretical nearly linear scalability {{in the number}} of rendering nodes, which makes it <b>very</b> <b>attractive</b> for <b>very</b> large polygonal and volumetric models. The dis{{advantage of}} sort last rendering is that a final image composition step is necessary in which a huge amount of data has to be transferred between the rendering nodes. Even with gigabit or faster networks the image composition introduces an overhead that makes it impractical to use sort last parallel rendering for interactive applications on large clusters. This paper describes the Sorted Pipeline Composition algorithm that reduces the amount of data that needs to be transferred by an order of magnitude and results in a frame rate that is at least twice as high as the widely used binary swap image composition algorithm...|$|R
