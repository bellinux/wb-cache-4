50|$|The {{original}} {{cars were}} a Ferrari and a Cooper and used an electromagnetic {{ratchet and pawl}} system and a contact breaker, rather than the more traditional wound electric motors. This first motor could be run on 16v AC or 12v DC current, with AC current providing slightly more power. Power was either 'on' or 'off' and cars would freewheel around corners, needing a totally different driving technique to variable speed motors. Cars could only run {{for a short time}} as they were rather prone to overheating, and performances varied wildly, according to contact and brush settings. Later developments moved on to more traditional DC motors with a <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> <b>control,</b> and the addition of Vanwall, Maserati, BRM and Porsche to the rather limited range.|$|E

50|$|Historically, AC motors {{were used}} for single or double speed {{elevator}} machines {{on the grounds of}} cost and lower usage applications where car speed and passenger comfort were less of an issue, but for higher speed, larger capacity elevators, the need for infinitely <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> over the traction machine becomes an issue. Therefore, DC machines powered by an AC/DC motor generator were the preferred solution. The MG set also typically powered the relay controller of the elevator, which has the added advantage of electrically isolating the elevators from the rest of a building's electrical system, thus eliminating the transient power spikes in the building's electrical supply caused by the motors starting and stopping (causing lighting to dim every time the elevators are used for example), as well as interference to other electrical equipment caused by the arcing of the relay contactors in the control system.|$|E

Therefore in the competitive markets of today where reducing costs {{is an important part}} of surviving, any methods of reducing the amount of power used in the processes that industry performs will be advantageous.

25|$|There are {{a variety}} of router styles, some are plunge, some are D handled, some are double knob handled. Different {{manufacturers}} produce the routers for different wood works, as Plunge Routers, Fixed Base Wood Routers, Combo Routers, <b>Variable</b> <b>speed</b> Routers, Laminate Trimmer, CNC Wood Routers. Nowadays, most better quality routers have <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> <b>controls</b> and will have plunge bases that can also be locked in place so the router can also be used as a fixed base router. Some have a soft-start feature, meaning they build up speed gradually. This feature is particularly desirable for routers with a large cutter. Holding a 3 horse-power router and turning it on without a soft-start is potentially dangerous, due to the torque of the motor. Holding it with two hands is a must. For routers with a toggle type on / off switch it is important to check to verify the switch is in the off position, prior to plugging it in. For safety, larger router cutters can usually only be used in a router that is mounted in a router table, this makes the tool even more versatile and stable.|$|R

5000|$|Artificial double {{tracking}} (ADT) {{was invented}} by Ken Townsend in 1966, during the recording of Revolver. With the advent of four-track recordings, it became possible to double track vocals whereby the performer sings along {{with his or her}} own previously recorded vocal. Phil McDonald, a member of the studio staff, recalled that Lennon did not really like singing a song twice - it was obviously important to sing exactly the same words with the same phrasing - and after a particularly trying evening of double tracking vocals, Townsend [...] "had an idea" [...] while driving home one evening hearing the sound of the car in front. ADT works by taking the original recording of a vocal part and duplicating it onto a second tape machine which has a <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> <b>control.</b> The manipulation of the speed of the second machine during playback introduces a delay between the original vocal and the second recording of it, giving the effect of double tracking without having to sing the part twice.|$|E
50|$|Vibratory feeders, {{commonly}} known as a bowl feeder, are self-contained devices, consisting of a specially shaped bowl designed to orient the parts to a specific orientation. A vibrating drive unit, upon which the bowl is mounted and a variable-amplitude control box controls the bowl feeder. Usually included is an out feed accumulation track (linear or gravity) to convey parts along and discharge into the assembly machine comes in many shapes and sizes. The drive unit, available in both electromagnetic and pneumatic drives, vibrates the bowl, forcing the parts to move up a circular, inclined track. The tooling (hand made) is designed to sort and orient the parts in to a consistent, repeatable position. The track length, width, and depth are carefully chosen to suit each application, component shape and size. Special bowl and track coatings are applied according to shape size and material of the component which aids traction, damage to the product and lower acoustic levels. A <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> <b>control</b> box is used for controlling the vibration speed of the bowl feeder, and can control the flow of parts to the out feed track via sensors.|$|E

Our experimental {{results show that the}} proposed fan control scheme is stable under the non-ideal temperature measurement system (10 sec in time lag and 1 ◦C in quantization figures). Furthermore, the global control scheme enables to run multiple local controllers in a stable manner while reducing the performance degradation up to 19. 2 % compared to conventional coordination schemes with 19. 1 % savings in power consumption.

The operator is provided with a lever in the cab that allows for the control of the hydraulic motor's ability to use the energy provided by the pump.

If the swash plate is set to neutral, the pistons do not move in their bores and no rotation is allowed, thus the machine does not move. By moving the lever, the swash plate moves its attached pistons forward, thus allowing them to move within the bore and causing the motor to turn.
