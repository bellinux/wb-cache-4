40|$|World-wide, Optometry is {{expanding}} its scope of practice in many jurisdictions. The campaign to use therapeutic pharmaceutical agents (TPAs) is on-going {{in most countries}} and optometrists are increasingly becoming involved in co-managing glaucoma and the ocular complications of diabetes, interfacing with systemic and ophthalmic specialists. Optometrists continue to define their role {{as members of the}} healthcare team by serving as post-operative care specialists following refractive and cataract surgeries. In addition, Optometry continues to be a leader in pediatric eye care and pediatric eye research, including working with children with learning disabilities and children with special needs (multiple-challenges). While low vision, contact lenses and orthoptics (vision training/binocular vision) remain staples of the traditional domain, they should not be ignored at the expense of new growth. Even as we struggle, some ask, “is the time ripe for Optometry to begin to recognize its own subspecialties?” Although all optometrists graduate as primary eye care providers, as the profession expands special interest practitioners have laid claim to areas of expertise such as sports <b>vision</b> specialist, <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>vision</b> specialist, neurooptometric specialty and so on.

40|$|The {{concept of}} a private {{practice}} residency in optometric <b>vision</b> therapy and <b>rehabilitation</b> was first advocated by Dr. W. C. Maples in {{an editorial in the}} Journal of Behavioral Optometry. 1 Dr. Maples noted that although optomet-ric residencies in this area of care have been available since the 1970 s, a vari-ety of factors have constrained accessibility to behavioral vision care in private practice. The principal focus of this paper is on the challenges faced by a private practice residency program and the goals of the program relative to the outcome for the resident, the residency site and delivery of vision therapy and rehabili-tation services. Our perspective is that private practice residencies can benefit from the track record of institutional residencies, but present a unique set of attributes and considerations. Our primary purpose in presenting this informa-tion is to increase awareness in the academic and clinical communities about a new Southern College of Optometry-affiliated residency in <b>vision</b> therapy and <b>rehabilitation</b> as an option for post-graduates...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on the project "Reading skills, reading {{training}} and technology for the visually handicapped - Prospects for the 1990 s," carried out at the Department of Educational Research of the Stockholm Institute of Education 1988 - 1993. All data were collected in connection with this project. Quantitative and qualitative methods and objective and subjective measures were used. The overall aim of the thesis is to evaluate short- and long-term outcomes of reading rehabilitation of elderly low vision patients, as reflected in the practice of low vision clinics. Other aims are to introduce a Three-stage model for training reading skills at different levels, to find possible interactions of cognitive capacity, age and visual deficits with influence on restoring reading ability, to evaluate the impact of low <b>vision</b> reading <b>rehabilitation</b> on life satisfaction, and to describe the outcome of intensive and extended reading training. The theoretical framework for the thesis is an interactive model of the reading process. Visual acuity was the strongest determinant of reading achievements with optical devices. Visual acuity was also a good predictor of outcome as measured by the reading performance index. A polarization of reading proficiency was found over a three-year period. Patients using optical devices as their reading media had decreased, but patients who adhered to optical devices had further improved their reading skills. Changes in visual ability did not explain the alterations. Other factors, especially aging and its consequences, were more influential. Results supported the theory of other researchers that predictors of successful outcome of low <b>vision</b> reading <b>rehabilitation</b> {{are to be found in}} interactive effects of cognitive capacity and visual deficits. Low vision clinics measured outcomes mainly at the sensory level which is not enough. Low vision affected elderly patients differently compared to other ages. The more the visual/reading ability was reduced, the greater the risk for patients to become passive. Patients with the best reading skills were found to be the most active media consumers. Restored reading ability was a clear contributor to an independent life and a promoter of retained or improved quality of life. The overall conclusion is that prescription of optical reading devices must always be accompanied by a strong educational support, i. e. low vision reading training, specifically for elderly patients with the most reduced visual ability. Training with clear objectives related to the patients' interests and high motivation are indicators of a positive outcome. Attention should be paid to patients' cognitive capacity and comprehension training. Low reading rates are not an obstacle for patients' appreciation of the training. Criteria of acceptable results should be set differently for different categories of patients. A limited and modest progress could make the difference between dependence/dissatisfaction and independence/satisfaction. A high prioritized area for future research should be studies on measuring short- and long-term outcomes in order to define reliable predictors of successful low <b>vision</b> (reading) <b>rehabilitation...</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Vision</b> <b>{{rehabilitation}}</b> (often called vision rehab) is a {{term for}} a medical rehabilitation to improve vision or low vision. In other words, it {{is the process of}} restoring functional ability and improving quality of life and independence in an individual who has lost visual function through illness or injury. Most visual rehabilitation services are focused on low vision, which is a visual impairment that cannot be fully corrected by regular eyeglasses, contact lenses, medication, or surgery. Low vision interferes with the ability to perform everyday activities. Visual impairment is caused by factors including brain damage, vision loss, and others. Of the <b>vision</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> techniques available, most center on neurological and physical approaches.|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} depression and quantitative measures of visual function, we recruited 18 subjects with central scotomas from macular degeneration who were enrolled in a reading rehabilitation program. Psychological batteries and reading assessments were administered prior to rehabilitation; reading assessments and a measure of adaptation to vision loss were administered following rehabilitation. We investigated relationships between reported levels of depressive symptoms and reading and adaptation outcome measures by using Pearson product moment correlation analysis. Results revealed {{a significant relationship between}} depression levels and reading acuity difference scores (r(16) = 0. 54, p = 0. 02) and changes in adaptation to vision loss levels (r(16) = 0. 62, p = 0. 01), suggesting that those who reported greater depressive symptoms did not respond as well functionally to reading rehabilitation but reported greater improvement in levels of adaptation to <b>vision</b> loss following <b>rehabilitation.</b> Future research should focus on defining standard methods to assess and remediate depression as part of the rehabilitation process...|$|R
40|$|Objectives Fatigue is {{an often}} {{mentioned}} symptom by patients with irreversible visual impairment. This study explored the patient perspective of fatigue in visually impaired adults {{with a focus}} on symptoms of fatigue, causes, consequences and coping strategies. Setting Two large Dutch low <b>vision</b> multidisciplinary <b>rehabilitation</b> organisations. Participants 16 visually impaired adults with severe symptoms of fatigue selected by purposive sampling. Methods A qualitative study involving semistructured interviews. A total of four first-level codes were top-down predetermined in correspondence with the topics of the research question. Verbatim transcribed interviews were analysed with a combination of a deductive and inductive approach using open and axial coding. Results Participants often described the symptoms of fatigue as a mental, daily and physical experience. The most often mentioned causes of fatigue were a high cognitive load, the intensity and amount of activities, the high effort necessary to establish visual perception, difficulty with light intensity and negative cognitions. Fatigue had the greatest impact on the ability to carry out social roles and participation, emotional functioning and cognitive functioning. The most common coping strategies were relaxation, external support, socialising and physical exercise and the acceptance of fatigue. Conclusions Our results indicate that low vision-related fatigue is mainly caused by population specific determinants that seem different from the fatigue experience described in studies with other patient populations. Fatigue may be central to the way patients react, adapt and compensate to the consequences of vision loss. These findings indicate a need for future research aimed at interventions specifically tailored to the unique aspects of fatigue related to vision los...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: This study {{aimed to}} {{estimate}} the magnitude and causes of low vision disability (severe visual impairment [SVI] and moderate visual impairment [MVI]) among students at Al-Noor Institute for the Blind (NIB) in Al-Hassa, Saudi Arabia in 2006. Methods: An optometrist conducted refraction of 122 eyes of the 61 students (27 boys and 34 girls) with MVI (vision < 6 / 18 to 6 / 60) and SVI (vision < 6 / 60 to 3 / 60). Ophthalmologists examined the anterior and posterior segments, and analysed the outcomes of additional investigations to finalise the diagnosis. The results were categorised as ‘preventable’, ‘treatable’ and ‘not amenable to treatment’. The low vision care was also reviewed. Results: In 12 (9. 8 %) eyes, visual acuity was ≥ 6 / 18 and in 28 (23 %) eyes, it was < 3 / 60. MVI and SVI were found in 82 eyes (67. 2 %). Hereditary retinal disorders were found in 68 (55. 7 %) eyes. Although refractive errors were found in 112 (91. 8 %) eyes, isolated refractive error was found in only 9 students. Congenital glaucoma and cataract were responsible for visual impairment in 16 (13. 1 %) and 9 (7. 4 %) eyes. These students were prescribed optical and non-optical low vision aids. Conclusion: Retinal disease was {{the main cause of}} SVI and MVI in our series. Some students at Al-Noor Institute for the Blind have curable low <b>vision</b> conditions. <b>Rehabilitation</b> of low <b>vision</b> disability should be different from that offered to the absolutely blind...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{investigate}} the simultaneous association of several psychophysical measures with reading ability {{in patients with}} mild and moderate low <b>vision</b> attending <b>rehabilitation</b> services. METHODS. Standard measurements of reading ability (Minnesota Reading [MNREAD] charts), visual acuity (Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study [ETDRS] charts), contrast sensitivity (Pelli-Robson charts), reading contrast threshold (Reading Explorer [REX] charts), retinal sensitivity, and fixation stability and localization (Micro Perimeter 1 [MP 1] fundus perimetry) were obtained in 160 low vision patients with better eye visual acuity ranging from 0. 3 to 1. 0 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution and affected by either age-related macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy. RESULTS. All variables were moderately associated with reading performance measures (MNREAD reading speed and reading acuity and REX reading contrast threshold), as well as among each other. In a structural equation model, REX reading contrast threshold was highly associated with MNREAD reading speed (standardized coefficient, 0. 63) and moderately associated with reading acuity (standardized coefficient, - 0. 30). REX test also mediated the effects of Pelli-Robson contrast sensitivity (standardized coefficient, 0. 44), MP 1 fixation eccentricity (standardized coefficient, 0. 19), and the mean retinal sensitivity (standardized coefficient, 0. 23) on reading performance. The MP 1 fixation stability was associated with both MNREAD reading acuity (standardized coefficient, - 0. 24) and MNREAD reading speed (standardized coefficient, 0. 23), while ETDRS visual acuity only affected reading acuity (standardized coefficient, 0. 44). CONCLUSIONS. Fixation instability and contrast sensitivity loss are key factors limiting reading performance of patients with mild or moderate low vision.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the short-term effects of the <b>vision</b> trainer <b>rehabilitation</b> technique on retinal and post-retinal function in young amblyopic patients outside the critical visual developmental period. Methods: Twenty-one patients (mean age 12. 2 ± 2. 7 years, ranging from 9. 1 to 18 years) affected by unilateral anisometropic amblyopia were studied, providing 21 amblyopic eyes (AE) and 21 sound eyes (SE). Thirty eyes from 15 age-similar normal subjects served as controls. All subjects underwent extensive ophthalmologic characterization to exclude any disease not related to amblyopia. All AE were subjected to rehabilitation sessions performed by the Retimax vision trainer (VT) program. The protocol consisted of 2 sessions per week, each lasting 10 min, for 10 consecutive weeks. Before and after the rehabilitation, electrophysiological [pattern electroretinogram (PERG) and visual evoked potential (VEP) ] and psychophysical [best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and microperimetry] data were collected from AE and SE. Results: When comparing baseline data with those collected at the end of the study, PERG P 50 -N 95 amplitude and BCVA values from AE had improved significantly by the end of the study (p < 0. 05). Our electrophysiological findings also showed some abnormalities in SE when the data were compared to control eyes. We found a significant correlation (p < 0. 05) between PERG amplitude and VEP implicit time in SE after visual rehabilitation. Conclusions: Short-term visual rehabilitation performed by the VT program ameliorated the electrofunctional and psychophysical parameters of vision in children outside the critical developmental period, thus indicating that VT might be a potential adjuvant therapy of traditional patching treatment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Given the {{prevalence}} of sensory impairment in older adults, the relationship of sensory impairment to everyday competence among older adults is gaining attention. Dual impairment, or concurrent impairments of vision and hearing, affects anywhere from 5 % to 21 % of older adults. Using Longi-tudinal Study on Aging data, we examined the longitudinal associations of self-reported dual sensory impairment with everyday competence in self-reported {{activities of daily living}} among adults aged 70 and older (N = 5, 151). Self-reported dual sensory impairment was associated with higher levels of self-reported functional disability at baseline and at the 2 -year fol-low-up interview, but the effect gradually diminished over time. However, self-reported dual sensory impairment was not asso-ciated with greater levels of self-reported disability as compared with self-reported visual impairment alone. Findings highlight the importance of <b>vision</b> and aural <b>rehabilitation</b> programs for older adults to mitigate the loss of competence in later life due to sensory impairment.

40|$|Purpose: This study {{examined}} the relation of dual and single sensory impairments, {{within the context of}} cog-nitive function, by using the framework of everyday competence in terms of the probability of difficulty with specific personal and instrumental activities of daily living (ADLs and IADLs, respectively). Design and Methods: The Longitudinal Study on Aging, composed of individuals aged 70 and older in 1984 (N = 5, 151), provided data for the present analyses. In each IADL and ADL domain, binary logistic regressions assessed the probability of difficulty associated with sensory impairment and cognitive status after sociodemographic and physical health covariates were controlled for. Results: One fifth of older adults reported dual sensory impairment, which was associated with greater IADL than ADL task difficulty compared with single sensory loss. Further, high levels of dual impairment were shown to increase the risk of difficulty in three of six IADL tasks (preparing meals, shopping, and using the telephone) over vision impairment alone. Overall, cognitive status {{was a significant predictor of}} both ADL and IADL difficulties, which was not expected from the everyday competence framework. Implications: Findings highlight the importance of sensory resour-ces for everyday competence and suggest the need for effective <b>vision</b> and hearing <b>rehabilitation</b> to assist older adults in improving or maintaining their functional independence...|$|R
40|$|Non-invasive brain current {{stimulation}} (NIBS) is {{a promising}} and versatile tool for inducing neuroplasticity, protection and functional rehabilitation of damaged neuronal systems. It is technically simple, requires no surgery, and has significant beneficial effects. However, {{there are various}} technical approaches for NIBS which influence neuronal networks in significantly different ways. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), alternating current stimulation (ACS) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) all have been applied to modulate brain activity in animal experiments under normal and pathological conditions. Also clinical trials have shown that tDCS, rTMS and ACS induce significant behavioural effects and can – depending on the parameters chosen – enhance or decrease brain excitability and influence performance and learning as well as rehabilitation and protective mechanisms. The diverse phaenomena and partially opposing effects of NIBS are not yet fully understood and mechanisms of action need to be explored further in order to select appropriate parameters for a given task, such as current type and strength, timing, distribution of current densities and electrode position. In this review, we will discuss the various parameters which {{need to be considered}} when designing a NIBS protocol and will put them into context with the envisaged applications in experimental neurobiology and medicine such as <b>vision</b> restoration, motor <b>rehabilitation</b> and cognitive enhancement...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroduction: the oculocutaneous {{albinism}} is a {{group of}} autosomic recessive disorders related to the failure in the melanin biosynthesis characterized by a generalized reduction in pigmentation of hair, skin and eyes. This article summarizes visual and ocular <b>vision</b> alterations and <b>rehabilitation</b> principles in these patients. Methods: a systematic review was made in PUBMED with MeSH Terms "oculocutaneous albinism", "refractive error", "visual and ocular alterations", "low vision" y "retina". 41 articles were selected by their coherence with thepurpose of the article. Results: four types of Albinism have been identified, with an approximate general prevalence of 1 : 17. 000. The visual and ocular alterations are: reduced visual acuteness, photophobia, nistagmus, strabismus, high refractive error, lack of pigmentation or iris translucency, photophobia, fovea hypoplasia of variable degree, misrouting of the optical nerve fibers and low stereopsis among others. The visual managementfor the albino patients implies the correction of refractive error, the decrease of the photophobia and dazzle and the professional adjustment of low vision aids, taking into account the needs and expectations of the patient. Conclusions: it is very important for the optometrist {{to be aware of the}} appropriate handling and timely referral of these patients, given the visual and ocular anomalies related to albinism...|$|R
