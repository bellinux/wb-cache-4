The heat stored in the host rock heated by the <b>volcanic</b> <b>magma</b> <b>chamber</b> from the time of chamber origination to the present is estimated, taking variable chamber dimensions during the process of evolution into account. The geological-geophysical prerequisites for using the thermal energy of the heated rock which surrounds the magma chamber to supply heat and power to Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskii are analyzed. The creation of an underground geothermal circulation system (fracture heat exchanger) using deep boreholes is proposed...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{displacements}} and edifice deformations at active volcanoes {{can occur}} when magma reservoirs begin to inflate as new magma enters them. Volcanoes are also {{subjected to a}} variety of external lithospheric stresses that are thought to be responsible for triggering volcanic unrest or modifying ongoing activity. However, despite many observations, it is uncertain whether these phenomena can actually interfere with magma chamber dynamics since it is not clear why some volcanoes are more subjected to these interactions than others. In order to determine whether external stresses interfere with volcanic activity, a viscoelastic 3 D Finite Element Mogi-based model of Kīlauea volcano's magma chamber was implemented. First, the model was used to replicate an inflation cycle without external stresses. Its results were then compared with the ones obtained if the same model was subjected to tidal stress modulation and a strong (Mw = 7. 7) tectonic earthquake. The model showed that tidally-induced pressurization is not sufficiently large to modify the pressure in a 5 km deep <b>volcanic</b> <b>magma</b> <b>chamber,</b> but it suggested how the magma chamber pressure build-up rate can be influenced by tidal pressurization and thus why some volcanoes seem to experience tidal interferences more than others. Furthermore, the model's results suggested why magma chambers are about the same size as calderas both on the Earth and on other Solar System silicate planets. System. Finally, it was used to propose an explanation of why a short-lived eruption at Kīlauea volcano, Hawai’i, began 30 min after the 1975 magnitude 7. 7 (Mw) Kalapana earthquake...|$|E

5000|$|The driving density {{difference}} between fluids that produces intrusion motion could simply {{be due to}} chemical composition. However variations can also be caused by differences in respective fluid temperatures, dissolved matter concentrations and by particulate matter suspended in flows.Examples of particulate suspension intrusions include sediment laden river outflows within oceans, ‘short-circuit’ sewage sedimentation tank intrusions [...] and turbidity current flows over hypersaline Mediterranean pools. Examples also exist of particulate intrusions caused by the lateral spread of thermals or plumes along planes of neutral buoyancy; such as intrusions containing metalliferous sediments formed from deep ocean hydrothermal vents.

40|$|The {{results of}} {{detailed}} seismic investigations {{during the period}} 1961 to 1964 are described. Accurate data of focus location for Kamchatka and the Commander Islands are cited. The majority of earthquakes {{are located in the}} Pacific focal zone and the others are found in such remarkable tectonic regions as the east Kamchatka ranges, the continental slope of the Commander Islands, etc. The focal zone seismic activity decreases with increasing depth. The seismic activity at a depth of 250 km is 100 times less than the activity at a depth of 0 – 20 km. Kamchatka earthquake locations in relation to the Kuril-Kamchatka Island arc and deep water trench are approximately the same as those of the south Kuril Island earthquakes. The Kamchatka active volcano belt coincides with the region of earthquakes having focal depths of 100 – 200 km, especially between 125 and 175 km. S-wave screening in the <b>magma</b> <b>chambers</b> under the volcanoes is observed. The Avacha <b>volcanic</b> cluster <b>magma</b> <b>chamber</b> at a depth of 20 – 80 km has the form of a column, 25 km in diameter. P-wave velocity in the upper mantle under the Pacific Ocean and between the Aleutian trench and the Kuril-Kamchatka trench is about 8. 2 km/sec, and under Kamchatka 7. 7 km/sec.

30|$|After imaging shallow {{volcanic}} reservoirs and pathways beneath Aso caldera, we {{confirm the}} agreement with other studies and further understand {{the structure of the}} volcano. Low-Vs anomalies are predominant under the post-caldera central cones, which act as <b>volcanic</b> conduits connect <b>magma</b> <b>chambers</b> located at depths of 5 – 6  km with shallow hydrothermal reservoirs located at depths of 1 – 2.5  km. By contrast, high Vs anomalies characterize the first kilometer of the crust beneath post-caldera central cones, i.e., above the shallow hydrothermal reservoirs. When volcanic activity increases and energy cannot be released immediately, this could result in gradual accumulation of pressure and occasionally occurrence of phreatic or phreatomagmatic eruptions. Besides, our Vs structures are generally comparable with electrical resistivity and gravity studies. That is, low velocities correspond to rocks with low density and resistivity as hydrothermal reservoirs or pathways containing volcanic fluids; instead, high velocities correspond to rocks with high density and resistivity as consolidated igneous rock. Further investigations might be needed to understand the lateral velocity variation {{in the northern part of}} the caldera.|$|R
50|$|A {{volcanic}} crater is {{a roughly}} circular {{depression in the}} ground caused by volcanic activity. It is typically a bowl-shaped feature within which occurs a vent or vents. During <b>volcanic</b> eruptions, molten <b>magma</b> and <b>volcanic</b> gases rise from an underground <b>magma</b> <b>chamber,</b> through a tube-shaped conduit, until they reach the crater's vent, from where the gases escape into the atmosphere and the magma is erupted as lava. A volcanic crater can be of large dimensions, and sometimes of great depth. During certain types of explosive eruptions, a volcano's <b>magma</b> <b>chamber</b> may empty enough for an area above it to subside, forming a type of larger crater known as a caldera.|$|R
50|$|The {{composition}} {{data indicate that}} Ollagüe was underpinned by a large <b>magma</b> <b>chamber</b> that {{was the source of}} the main edifice building andesite magmas. In this main <b>magma</b> <b>chamber,</b> differentiation processes generated the andesitic and dacitic magmas from basaltic andesite. The chamber itself was chemically zoned. Episodically, new mafic magmas were injected into the <b>magma</b> <b>chamber</b> from below. Subsidiary <b>magma</b> <b>chambers</b> which developed beneath the northwestern and southeastern flank gave rise to the La Celosa and Ch'aska Urqu volcanic centres, respectively. These subsidiary pathways also allowed basaltic andesite magmas to ascend to the surface; the main <b>magma</b> <b>chamber</b> would have intercepted any mafic magmas ascending into the central vent as such mafic magmas are denser. The walls of the <b>magma</b> <b>chamber</b> were also affected by strong hydrothermal alteration processes, with weaker alteration also occurring in the walls of the subsidiary <b>magma</b> <b>chambers.</b> La Poruñita was probably formed by magmas from the floor of the main <b>magma</b> <b>chamber,</b> or from the magma that enters the <b>magma</b> <b>chamber</b> from below; it had already undergone some crustal contamination {{in the depths of the}} crust when it erupted.|$|R

40|$|The Cambro-Ordovician {{period has}} yielded the major {{development}} of volcanic-hosted massive sulfide (VHMS) deposits in Australia, resulting in about 12 {{million metric tons}} of contained metal (copper, lead, and zinc), concentrated in the Mount Read Volcanics (Tasmania) and the Mount Windsor Volcanics (Queensland), The Archean (4 million metric tons of metal) and the Silurian (3. 5 million metric tons of metal) constitute the next important episodes while the Devonian and Permian have produced isolated deposits. The deposits range from Cu type to Zn-Cu type to Zn-Pb-Cu type. The Zn-Cu-type deposits are restricted to the Archean and Silurian, whereas the Cu type and Zn-Pb-Cu type occur sporadically throughout the time span from early Archean to Permian. In general terms, the major VHMS-bearing districts are calc-alkaline in character and display a thick basal pile of rhyolitic volcanics (1 - 3 km thick) including lavas, epiclastics, and subvolcanic intrusions which is overlain by a polymodal sequence containing various proportions of rhyolite,dacite, andesite, basalt, and sediments. The major deposits are commonly located at the top contact of the rhyolite pile or within {{the lower part of}} the overlying polymodal sequence. There is a wide range in variability of styles of Australian VHMS deposits including mounds, pipes, sheets, layered deposits, stacked deposits, stockwork and disseminated deposits, distal reworked deposits, and cyclic layered deposits. Although these various styles show a range of features, there is a consistent theme across the spectrum of metal zonation, alteration mineralogy, alteration chemistry, sulfur isotopes, macrotextures, microtextures, and host volcanic relationships which strongly suggests that they all belong to the one genetic group of ore deposit. The classic mound-style deposits, such as Hellyer, have a series of key features, subsets of which are represented in the other deposit styles. The mound deposits are considered to form from deposition of metal sulfides on the sea floor immediately around the hydrothermal vent. Growth of the mound occurs by upward replacement of sulfide assemblages stable at higher fluid temperatures, leading to zone refining and lead-zinc-silver-gold enrichment in the outer and upper parts of the mound, Departure from the classic mound style of deposit is related principally to three key factors: the chemistry of the ore fluid (salinity, temperature,f 02, and aH 2 S), the nature (permeability and chemistry) of the volcanic pile, and the sea-Hoor environment (sea-Hoor topography and [...] seawater depth). These factors control the aspect ratio of the deposit, the extent of stringer zone development, the degree of subsea-floor replacement mineralization, the nature and spatial development of footwall alteration, and the development and style of related distal mineralization. Sulfur isotope studies of Australian VHMS deposits indicate that reduced seawater sulfate is a major source of sulfur in the deposit, whereas lead and strontium isotope results are compatible with the metals being derived by seawater convection and leaching from the volcanic pile and basement rocks. This conclusion is supported by the application of various leaching models which demonstrate the availability of an adequate source of both base and precious metals in the footwall volcanic sequences. The input of metals directly from <b>volcanic</b> <b>magma</b> <b>chambers</b> is not precluded by the available data, and one likely scenario involves the contribution of gold and copper from a magmatic vapor plume, rising to mix with convective seawater fluids which contribute lead, zinc, silver, and gold leached from the footwall volcanics and basement rocks. The relative importance of the magmatic input compared with the seawater convective input may help to explain the spectrum of deposit styles arid their spatial relationship to volcanic centers or adjacent sedimentary basins...|$|R
30|$|As {{revealed}} {{in our previous}} study (Ozawa and Fujita 2013) and other studies (Takada and Fukushima 2013; Pritchard et al. 2013), local deformation associated with large earthquake was detected around volcanoes. We expected that such deformation might have found above the <b>magma</b> <b>chamber</b> in residual distributions, but such local deformation was not detected in this analysis (Fig.  4). We suspect that its reason is related {{to the size of the}} affected <b>magma</b> <b>chamber.</b> In the case that the size of <b>magma</b> <b>chamber</b> is small, surface deformation due to deformation of the <b>magma</b> <b>chamber</b> is small. Provably, larger <b>magma</b> <b>chamber</b> will exist in deeper area. However, rupture in this earthquake occurred in shallow depth and typical fault dislocation was lateral slip. Therefore, crustal deformation around the deep large <b>magma</b> <b>chamber</b> must have been small. From this reason, we suspect that crustal deformation due to deformation of the <b>magma</b> <b>chamber</b> might have not been detected.|$|R
40|$|Orientation of the {{eruption}} fissures {{and composition of}} the lavas of the Miyakejima volcano indicate tectonic influence of a shallow <b>magma</b> <b>chamber</b> {{on the distribution of}} eruption fissures. We examined the distributions and magmatic compositions of 23 fissures that formed within the last 2800 years, based on a field survey and a new dataset of 14 C ages. The dominant orientation of {{the eruption}} fissures in the central portion of the volcano was found to be NE-SW, which is perpendicular to the direction of regional maximum horizontal compressive stress (σHmax). Magmas that show evidences of magma mixing between basaltic and andesitic magmas erupted mainly from the eruption fissures with a higher offset angle from the regional σHmax direction. The presence of a shallow dike-shaped <b>magma</b> <b>chamber</b> controls the distribution of the eruption fissures. The injection of basaltic magma into the shallow andesitic <b>magma</b> <b>chamber</b> caused the temporal rise of internal magmatic pressure in the shallow <b>magma</b> <b>chamber.</b> Dikes extending from the andesitic <b>magma</b> <b>chamber</b> intrude along the local compressive stress field which is generated by the internal excess pressure of the andesitic <b>magma</b> <b>chamber.</b> As the result, the eruption fissures trend parallel to the elongation direction of the shallow <b>magma</b> <b>chamber.</b> Injection of basaltic magma into the shallow andesitic <b>magma</b> <b>chamber</b> caused the <b>magma</b> mixing. Some basaltic dikes from the deep-seated <b>magma</b> <b>chamber</b> reach the ground surface without intersection with the andesitic <b>magma</b> <b>chamber.</b> The patterns of the eruption fissures can be modified in the future as was observed {{in the case of the}} destruction of the shallow <b>magma</b> <b>chamber</b> during the 2000 AD eruption...|$|R
50|$|Collapse calderas form {{due to the}} {{emptying}} of a <b>magma</b> <b>chamber.</b> Effusive eruptions {{that take}} place on the flanks of the associated volcano and a fissure system that direct magma away from the chamber are both mechanisms that can empty a <b>magma</b> <b>chamber.</b> As pressure in the <b>magma</b> <b>chamber</b> changes, an increase in tensile stresses create tension fractures at the surface of the volcano.
