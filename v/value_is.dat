5|$|If {{the target}} <b>value</b> <b>is</b> {{greater than the}} {{greatest}} value in the array, and the last index of the array is the maximum representable value of L, the value of L will eventually become too large and overflow. A similar problem will occur if the target <b>value</b> <b>is</b> smaller than the least value in the array and the first index of the array is the smallest representable value of R. In particular, this means that R must not be an unsigned type if the array starts with index 0.|$|E
5|$|Predecessor and {{successor}} queries can {{be performed}} with rank queries. Once the rank of the target <b>value</b> <b>is</b> known, its predecessor is the element at the position given by its rank (as {{it is the largest}} element that is smaller than the target value). Its successor is the element after it (if it is present in the array) or at the next position after the predecessor (otherwise). The nearest neighbor of the target <b>value</b> <b>is</b> either its predecessor or successor, whichever is closer.|$|E
5|$|Rank queries can be {{performed}} using {{a modified version of}} binary search. By returning m on a successful search, and L on an unsuccessful search, the number of elements less than the target <b>value</b> <b>is</b> returned instead.|$|E
50|$|Pascal {{routines}} that {{return a}} <b>value</b> <b>are</b> called functions; routines that don't return a <b>value</b> <b>are</b> called procedures. All routines in C are called functions; C functions {{that do not}} return a <b>value</b> <b>are</b> declared with a return type of void.|$|R

50|$|In the 2013 study, West Branch Tinklepaugh Creek {{ranged from}} {{slightly}} acidic to slightly alkaline. The minimum pH {{of the creek}} was 6.38, the average was 7.25 and the 7.95.

The concentration of dissolved oxygen ranged from 83.06 percent to 172.40 percent, {{with an average of}} 133.70 percent. The minimum <b>value</b> <b>was</b> within the ideal range, but the other two <b>values</b> <b>were</b> outside of it. The concentration of salinity was once measured to be 10.00 parts per million.

5|$|Any nonrational {{power of}} a complex number has an {{infinite}} number of possible values because of the multi-valued nature of the complex logarithm. The principal <b>value</b> <b>is</b> a single value chosen from these by a rule which, amongst its other properties, ensures powers of complex numbers with a positive real part and zero imaginary part give the same value as does the rule defined above for the corresponding real base.|$|E
5|$|As {{discussed}} above, in the PostgreSQL {{implementation of}} SQL, Null {{is used to}} represent all UNKNOWN results, including the UNKNOWN BOOLEAN. PostgreSQL does not implement the UNKNOWN literal (although it does implement the IS UNKNOWN operator, which is an orthogonal feature.) Most other major vendors {{do not support the}} Boolean type (as defined in T031) as of 2012. The procedural part of Oracle's PL/SQL supports BOOLEAN however variables; these can also be assigned NULL and the <b>value</b> <b>is</b> considered the same as UNKNOWN.|$|E
5|$|Binary search {{works on}} sorted arrays. Binary search begins by {{comparing}} the middle element of the array with the target value. If the target value matches the middle element, {{its position in the}} array is returned. If the target <b>value</b> <b>is</b> less than or greater than the middle element, the search continues in the lower or upper half of the array, respectively, eliminating the other half from consideration.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel procedure {{for determining the}} standard value of acquisition distortion of the fingerprint images. Knowledge about the standard value of acquisition distortion of the fingerprint images {{is very important in}} determining the method for improving image quality. In this paper, we propose a model to determine the standard value of acquisition distortion of the fingerprint images {{that can be used in}} classifying the type of distortion of the fingerprint images based on the image quality. The results shown that the standard value of acquisition distortion of the fingerprint images based on the image quality have values of a local clarity score (LCS) are as follows: dry parameter <b>values</b> <b>is</b> 0. 0127 - 0. 0149, neutral parameter <b>values</b> <b>is</b> less than 0. 0127, and oily parameter <b>values</b> <b>is</b> greater than 0. 0149; a global clarity score (GCS) are as follows: dry parameter <b>values</b> <b>is</b> 0. 0117 - 0. 0120, neutral parameter <b>values</b> <b>is</b> less than 0. 0117, and oily parameter <b>values</b> <b>is</b> greater than 0. 0120; and ridge-valley thickness ratio (RVTR) are as follows: dry parameter <b>values</b> <b>is</b> less than 7. 7546 E- 05, neutral parameter <b>values</b> <b>is</b> 7. 7546 E- 05 - 5. 9366 E- 05, and oily parameter <b>values</b> <b>is</b> greater than 5. 9366 E- 05...|$|R

The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.05mg/m3, time-weighted average.

5|$|Enceladus {{is losing}} mass {{at a rate}} of 200kg/second. If mass loss at this rate {{continued}} for 4.5 Gyr, the satellite would have lost approximately 30% of its initial mass. A similar <b>value</b> <b>is</b> obtained by assuming that the initial densities of Enceladus and Mimas were equal. It suggests that tectonics in the south polar region is probably mainly related to subsidence and associated subduction caused by the process of mass loss.|$|E

5|$|Fourier {{series are}} used to solve {{boundary}} value problems in partial differential equations. In 1822, Fourier first used this technique to solve the heat equation.
