40|$|The need to {{minimise}} the pre-entry drag of supersonic intakes demands {{an understanding}} of the link between the shock pattern in the region of the cowl lip, and aerodynamic instability consequent on shear planes or zones generated in the supersonic compression field entering the subsonic diffuser. The present Report aims to illuminate this link. It describes flow instabilities observed in tests with a range of model <b>variable</b> <b>ramp</b> intakes, and by invoking observations made during earlier experiments develops a consistent picture of instability in <b>variable</b> <b>ramp</b> intakes at Mach numbers of about 2. In general two forms of instability were observed in the tests described. These, of similar frequency but appreciably different amplitude, are termed 'big ' and 'little ' buzz. Experimental observations suggest that the latter involves a flow separation from the internal surface of the cowl, whilst 'big ' buzz is thought to be associated with separation of the ramp boundary layer. Flow instability in the Concorde intake is discussed in the light of these results. Although, because of the complexity of the phenomena investigated much work remains to be done, a design technique is suggested which offers the prospect of achievin...|$|E

40|$|Air inlets in {{some form}} are used on all {{commercial}} airliners today. The type of air inlet investigated in this report is a NACA inlet submerged into a surface. This surface is within this thesis a test section wall of a wind tunnel. The considered wind tunnel is TWG in Göttingen (Germany) that operates in transonic speeds. Submerged inlets have the main advantage of low aeroynamic drag from the inlet itself. The importance of reducing drag, and the attention given to this subject is increasing as fuel prices rise as well as public awareness of environmental impact by all of us. The outcome of this thesis contributes to the government-funded project ECOCENTS which deals with the design of innovative new aircraft cooling systems and the detailed flow analysis of these systems. This thesis was carried out at the company Airbus in Bremen, Germany. The main objective of this report was {{the evaluation of the}} ram pressure efficiency of four different ramp angles of a NACA inlet and the estimation of the drag caused by these geometries with the use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The flow solver used was TAU, a Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solver developed by the German Aerospace Center (DLR). The inlet consisted of one ramp section where the ramp angle was fixed at 7 degrees, and a second <b>variable</b> <b>ramp</b> section. The following different angles were investigated: 4, 7, 10 and 15 degrees. These configurations were evaluated at a velocity of Mach 0. 8 and a Reynolds number of 10 * 10 ^ 6. The ramp angle of 7 degrees was evaluated at two additional velocities (Mach 0. 73 and Mach 0. 87) and at two additional Reynolds numbers (5 * 10 ^ 6 and 15 * 10 ^ 6) at Mach 0. 8. The inlet efficiency outcome of this study was located between two other investigations. The results of this RANS computation predicted a higher total pressure at the inlet throat plane compared to a previous CFD investigation where a different RANS solver at the same geometry was used. In comparison to an estimation method mainly based on experimental data (ESDU method), the recent study showed a lower total pressure at the inlet throat plane. The aerodynamic drag that arised by the presence of the inlet system was calculated within this thesis to be higher than the outcome of the experimental data based (ESDU) method. The advantage of using a NACA type inlet was observed to be highly related to the ramp angle. Vortices are originated and develop along the edges of the intake ramp walls. These two vortices help to transport higher energy flow from the free stream into the inlet and therefore reduce the boundary layer thickness in the inlet region. For lower mass flows (0. 10 - 0. 20 kg/s) a ramp angle of 7 degrees was seen to be prefered in view of ram pressure efficiency. At a higher mass flow (0. 25 kg/s) the 10 degrees ramp angle was prefered, followed by the 15 degrees ramp angle at the highest investigated mass flows (0. 30 - 0. 35 kg/s). In view of drag, the lowest ramp angle possible for a given mass flow was seen to be most advantagous. Future work on this subject will include simulation of an inlet in combination with a heat exchanger and a ram air outlet. This arrengement will be the same as in the investigation at the TWG test campaign and therefore comparable. The difference in outcome of the separate CFD analysis was discussed within this investigation but could not be completely cleared...|$|E

However, early compressor stages suffered from fatigue due to rotating stall at low RPM and various fixes, such as lacing wire, were incorporated. Curtiss-Wright introduced <b>variable</b> <b>ramps</b> on the Wright J65 at the entry to the compressor to prevent the stalling and blade excitation.

The {{space between the}} engines generates lift, thereby reducing effective wing loading, hence improving maneuverability. The engines are fed through intake ramps fitted under the leading-edge extensions (LERXs), which have <b>variable</b> <b>ramps</b> to allow high-Mach speeds. As an adaptation to rough-field operations, the main air inlet can be closed completely and the auxiliary air inlet on the upper fuselage {{can be used for}} takeoff, landing and low-altitude flying, preventing ingestion of ground debris. Thereby the engines receive air through louvers on the LERXs which open automatically when intakes are closed. However the latest variant of the family, the MiG-35, eliminated these dorsal louvers, and adopted the mesh screens design in the main intakes, similar to those fitted to the Su-27.|$|R

Because the Su-24 is used almost exclusively for low-level missions, the actuators for the variable intakes were deleted to reduce weight and maintenance. This {{has no effect}} on low-level performance, but absolute maximum speed and altitude are cut to Mach 1.35 and 11000 m. The earliest Su-24 had a box-like rear fuselage, which was soon changed in production to a rear exhaust shroud more closely shaped around the engines in order to reduce drag. The revised aircraft also gained three side-by-side antenna fairings in the nose, a repositioned braking chute, and a new ram-air inlet {{at the base of the}} tail fin. The revised aircraft were dubbed [...] "Fencer-B" [...] by NATO, but did not merit a new Soviet designation.The Su-24's fixed armament is a single fast-firing GSh-6-23 cannon with 500 rounds of ammunition, mounted in the fuselage underside.

40|$|Here {{we review}} recent {{findings}} related to postnatal spinogenesis, dendritic and axon growth, pruning and electrophysiology of neocortical pyramidal {{cells in the}} developing primate brain. Pyramidal cells in sensory, association and executive cortex grow dendrites, spines and axons at different rates, and vary {{in the degree of}} pruning. Of particular note is the fact that pyramidal cells in primary visual area (V 1) prune more spines than they grow during postnatal development, whereas those in inferotemporal (TEO and TE) and granular prefrontal cortex (gPFC; Brodmann’s area 12) grow more than they prune. Moreover, pyramidal cells in TEO, TE and the gPFC continue to grow larger dendritic territories from birth into adulthood, replete with spines, whereas those in V 1 become smaller during this time. The developmental profile of intrinsic axons also varies between cortical areas: those in V 1, for example, undergo an early proliferation followed by pruning and local consolidation into adulthood, whereas those in area TE tend to establish their territory and consolidate it into adulthood with little pruning. We correlate the anatomical findings with the electrophysiological properties of cells in the different cortical areas, including membrane time constant, depolarizing sag, duration of individual action potentials, and spike-frequency adaptation. All of the electrophysiological <b>variables</b> <b>ramped</b> up before 7 months of age in V 1, but continued to ramp up over a protracted period of time in area TE. These data suggest that the anatomical and electrophysiological profiles of pyramidal cells vary among cortical areas at birth, and continue to diverge into adulthood.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to combine computational flow modelling, flow visualization and point measurements of mean flow and turbulence properties to obtain a better, more detailed, understandýing {{of the effects of}} alternative throttling devices on mixture preparation and turbulence generation in spark ignition engines. In so doing, it also seeks to assess the wider diagnostic potential of flow field computational techniques in internal combustion engine designs. Full-scale models, comprising simplified representations of the induction tract, throttling device, inlet valve and cylinder, have been manufactured in Perspex for steady-state water analogy tests. The resulting photographs of flow tracers in a variety of viewing planes provide a clear, but qualitative, picture of the princi - pal features of the flow in the models under study. The essentially qualitative data obtained from water analogy tests are complemented by limited hot wire velocity measurements at particular stations in the Perspex models, with air replacing the water as the flow medium. These data, supplemented by information in the literature, provide the framework for comparisons with an extensive computational simulation of induction flows which are performed using the general purpose PHOENICS code developed by CHAM. These studies include both transient and steady state predictions. The statistically stationary turbulent flow field through alternative induction system throttling devices -a conventional butterfly valve and a <b>variable</b> geometry <b>ramp</b> restriction- are modelled computationally and compared with water analogy flow visualization. The principal flow field characteristics are satisfactorily reproduced, including in particular the extent of the recirculation zone in the lee of the throttle and the relative persistence of the turbulence generated downstream for varying throat apertures. That generated by the two-dimensional <b>variable</b> geometry <b>ramp</b> is predicted to be both higher and persist beyond the inlet valve into the cylinder producing discernible swirl at high throttle settings. The limited quantitative comparisons with hot wire velocity measurements lend further support to the more detailed aspects of the computational predictions. Finally, comparisons are made between PHOENICS predictions and Laser-Doppler measurements of velocity for transient flow inside an axisymmetric motored piston-cylinder assembly, for different valve seat angles, reported in the literature.
