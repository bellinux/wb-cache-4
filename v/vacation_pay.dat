25|$|On December 5, 2008, {{members of}} UE Local 1110 at Republic Windows and Doors in Chicago, when the plant closed {{with only three}} days notice to the employees, {{occupied}} the plant in protest of the closing and company's failure to pay employees their accrued <b>vacation</b> <b>pay,</b> and payments required under the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act. The WARN Act requires 60 days notice of a plant closing, or 60 days pay if timely notice is not given. The workers' action drew extensive media coverage and attracted wide support, including from US President-elect Barack Obama, and Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich banned state business with Bank of America, because the bank's cancellation of the company's line of credit had prompted the shutdown. Protest demonstrations at Bank of America branches took place in dozens of US cities during the sit-in.
