50|$|Volcanoes {{were active}} during the {{retreating}} {{phase of the}} ice age. Some geologists postulate that Lake Todos los Santos and Llanquihue were just one lake in which the Osorno volcano built up until the two water bodies were separated. From then on, lake Todos los Santos had its surface level lifted as successive lava flows from the Osorno blocked the outlet of the lake. At the Petrohue waterfalls, one sees the river flow over such a constraining andesite lava flow. The steep left {{bank of the river}} is granodiorite. These volcanoes expel large quantities of loose cinder that in depositing give the rounded conic shape. These cinders are easily washed away by rain and surface water flow, so that the Puntiagudo, an elder brother of the Osorno, is denuded to the hard core of lava frozen inside the <b>volcanic</b> <b>chimney.</b>|$|E
50|$|This {{municipality}} {{belongs to}} two morphologic regions of level 1.000 towards the north, to the declivity of the Gulf of México {{and the same}} level towards the south and to the North mountain range. The North mountain range or mountain range of Puebla is formed by more or less individual, parallel mountain ranges, compressed a con the others and that usually forms great or small high plateaus intermountains that frequently appear stepped towards the coast; whereas the declivity of the gulf is the northern one of the North mountain range towards the coastal plain of the Gulf of Mexico, it characterizes by his numerous <b>volcanic</b> <b>chimneys</b> and isolated hills.|$|R
500|$|Darwin eagerly {{looked forward}} to seeing newly formed {{volcanic}} islands, and took every opportunity to go ashore while the Beagle was methodically moved round to chart the coast. He found broken black rocky volcanic lava scorching under the hot sun, and made detailed geological notes of features including <b>volcanic</b> cones like <b>chimneys</b> which {{reminded him of the}} iron foundries of industrial Staffordshire. He was disappointed that he did not see active volcanoes or find strata showing uplift as he had hoped, though one of the officers found broken oyster-shells high above the sea on one of the islands. Abundant giant Galápagos tortoises appeared to him almost antediluvian, and large black marine iguanas seemed [...] "most disgusting, clumsy Lizards" [...] well suited to their habitat – he noted that someone had called them [...] "imps of darkness". Darwin had learnt from Henslow about studying the geographical distribution of species, and particularly of linked species on oceanic islands and on nearby continents, so he endeavoured to collect plants in flower. He found widespread [...] "wretched-looking" [...] thin scrub thickets of only ten species, and very few insects. Birds were remarkably unafraid of humans, and in his first field note he recorded that a mockingbird was similar to those he had seen on the continent.|$|R
50|$|The {{travellers}} {{continue to}} explore the coastline, and find a passageway marked by Saknussemm as the way ahead. However, it is blocked by {{what appears to be}} a recent cave-in and two of the three, Hans and the Professor, despair at being unable to hack their way through the granite wall. The adventurers plan to blast the rock with gun cotton and paddle out to sea to escape the blast. Upon executing the plan, however, they discover that behind the rockfall was a seemingly bottomless pit, not a passage to the center of the earth. The travellers are swept away as the sea rushes into the large open gap in the ground. After spending hours being swept along at lightning speeds by the water, the raft ends up inside a large <b>volcanic</b> <b>chimney</b> filling with water and magma. Terrified, the three are rushed upwards, through stifling heat, and are ejected onto the surface from a side-vent of a stratovolcano. When they regain consciousness, they discover that they have been ejected from Stromboli, a volcanic island located in southern Italy. They return to Hamburg to great acclaimProfessor Lidenbrock is hailed as one of the great scientists of history, Axel marries his sweetheart Gräuben, and Hans eventually returns to his peaceful life in Iceland. The Professor has some regret that their journey was cut short.|$|E
5000|$|... "The {{eruption}} at Capelinhos {{started on}} 27 September {{with a small}} boiling of water at sea some 1 km west of the lighthouse. On 29 September, the intensity increased and became highly explosive. The ejecti of ash (sand and powder) reached frequently 800 m and another time reached more than 1200 m. The column of water vapor reached 3 or 4 km in heght and exceptionally even more. The violence of the eruption continued for a month. The quantity of ash emitted {{was so great that}} it formed a small island with 800 m diameter and 100 m height (above sea level) in an area that where the profundity was 70 m. There fell, near the lighthouse of Capelinhos and Port of Comprido, a few rocks that were about 30 kg. The cloud was blown by the wind and because of that ash fell some 20 km from the <b>volcanic</b> <b>chimney.</b> This was the aspect more harmful of the eruption. The quantity of ash fell on land dependent on the direction of the wind. When the wind blew strong from the west, on the 6 and 7 October, there was a panic in the settlements of Canto and Norte Pequeno (civil parish of Capelo) which lie about 3 km from the volcano. The populations were evacuated. In virtue of the dust scattered in the air (which increased greatly the condensation of the water droplets) the rainfall in the region increased by more the twice the normal, passing from 70 mm to more than 700 mm per month. The torrential rainfall that fell was another disastrous factor in the region. On 29 October the small island became submerged and it appeared that the activity had terminated. But within the following days it continued, it is unclear whether the activity will return and attain the anterior violence...The rocks expelled by the volcano fell on the buildings of the lighthouse of Capelinhos, puncturing the tile and pavements and breaking glass, sanitary wares and some furniture. The lighthouse had to be closed during the eruption and the personnel evacuated. The work that was in course was, therefore, suspended. The ash and rainfall seaped into the holes in the roof and windows and accumulated in almost all the rooms, damaging the interior floors and paintings. The exterior courtyard was, also, littered with more than 1 m of sand." [...] This description was also accompanied by a photographic journal with regists, captions and dated, to illustrate the more important moments of the event between September and November 1957.|$|E
40|$|The Chalcolithic {{fortified}} {{settlement of}} Moita da Ladra {{is located on}} the top of a high <b>volcanic</b> <b>chimney</b> that dominates the Tagus estuary. The archaeological site was entirely excavated due to the exploitation prosecution of a basalt quarry. The identified archaeological structures are both defensive and residential. The remains of an ellipsoidal wall with 80 m length and 44 m width including two massive towers and an entrance facing the Tagus estuary on the southern side. This settlement’s builders wanted it to be easily seen from the river and at a long distance. Besides its defensive function this archaeological site is intended to be a landmark in this landscape. The implantation of this Chalcolithic settlement is related with the access control of the large inner basin of Loures lowland, related with Sizandro river basin flux in which Zambujal fortified settlement is located. The site has only one occupation phase with few but diversified archaeological remains characterized with both decorated ceramics of “folha de acacia/crucífera” group and bell beakers ceramics represented by maritime vases and vases with geometric decoration. Radiocarbon dating points out to the occupation of this site during the second half of the 3 rd millennium BC, the same of other high fortified settlements of this region, such as Penha Verde (Sintra) or Leceia (Oeiras). The coexistence of both bell beakers ceramics and non beaker’s ceramics of “folha de acacia/crucífera” group has an important cultural meaning that is valued in this article...|$|E
