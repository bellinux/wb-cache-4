25|$|In {{the tale}} sung by the bard {{in the hall}} of Alcinous, the Sun-god Helios once spied Ares and Aphrodite enjoying each other {{secretly}} {{in the hall of}} Hephaestus, her husband. He reported the incident to Hephaestus. Contriving to catch the illicit couple in the act, Hephaestus fashioned a finely-knitted and nearly invisible net with which to snare them.

25|$|However, in some communities, the ketubah {{is either}} {{displayed}} in a <b>very</b> <b>private</b> section of the home or is not displayed at all. Various reasons given for this include {{the fact that the}} details specify personal details, prominent display may invite jealousy or fears of the evil eye. Historically, the ketubah specified whether the bride was a virgin. In Sephardic communities, it still specifies the actual contributions of the family to the new household and the divorce settlement; Ashkenazi communities have adopted the custom of having set amounts for all weddings.|$|E

She also provided an audio commentary track about her documentary for its DVD release. It appears even on pre-2007 editions of The Shining on DVD, although most DVDs of Kubrick films before then were devoid of documentaries or audio commentaries. It has some candid interviews and <b>very</b> <b>private</b> moments caught on set, such as arguments with cast and director, moments of a no-nonsense Kubrick directing his actors, Scatman Crothers being overwhelmed with emotion during his interview, Shelley Duvall collapsing from exhaustion on the set, and Jack Nicholson enjoying playing {{up to the}} behind-the-scenes camera.|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s Gryce reinvented {{himself as}} a public school teacher in New York. He was {{somewhat}} interested in education throughout his life, and {{was said to be}} an excellent music instructor. He received a master's degree in education from Fordham University in 1978 and developed an incredible passion for teaching. He left a lasting legacy at Elementary School No. 53 in the Bronx, which was renamed in his honor after his death. Students, colleagues, and parents who encountered Gryce during this time knew him as a <b>very</b> <b>private,</b> serious, passionate, and caring man. Believing that music aided literacy, Gryce was a strict but caring teacher, and {{went out of his way}} to aid students at educational risk, working at an under-resourced mostly black and Hispanic school.|$|E
25|$|A similar defense {{comes from}} Australian philosopher Frank Jackson (born 1943) who revived {{the theory of}} epiphenomenalism which argues that mental states do not {{play a role in}} {{physical}} states. Jackson argues that {{there are two kinds of}} dualism. The first is substance dualism that assumes there is second, non-corporeal form of reality. In this form, body and soul are two different substances. The second form is property dualism that says that body and soul are different properties of the same body. He claims that functions of the mind/soul are internal, <b>very</b> <b>private</b> experiences that are not accessible to observation by others, and therefore not accessible by science (at least not yet). We can know everything, for example, about a bat's facility for echolocation, but we will never know how the bat experiences that phenomenon.|$|E

25|$|The de Gaulle {{family were}} <b>very</b> <b>private.</b> De Gaulle was deeply {{focussed}} on {{his career at}} this time. There {{is no evidence that}} he was tempted by fascism, and there is little evidence of his views either on domestic upheavals in 1934 and 1936 or the many foreign policy crises of the decade. He approved of the rearmament drive which the Popular Front government began in 1936-7, although French military doctrine remained that tanks should be used in penny packets for infantry support. A rare insight into de Gaulle's political views is a letter to his mother warning her that war with Germany was sooner or later inevitable and reassuring her that Pierre Laval’s pact with the USSR in 1935 was for the best, likening it to Francois I’s alliance with the Turks against the Emperor Charles V.|$|E

5000|$|Private Companies - most 18XX {{games have}} private {{companies}} which are entirely owned by one player, {{and represent the}} earliest companies in the game or provide special abilities. [...] "Privates", as they are called, generally do little other than provide revenue, but in some games they control access to or enhance the revenue of certain hexes on the map. Some games have <b>very</b> similar <b>private</b> companies, some have <b>very</b> different <b>private</b> companies, and some dispense with having private companies at all. Some titles (e.g., 1835 and 1861) also have Minor Companies, which are again owned entirely by one player but play a more dynamic role than Privates.|$|R
60|$|When the Parliament had got the King {{into their}} hands, they became {{very anxious to}} get rid of their army, in which Oliver Cromwell had begun to acquire great power; not only because of his courage and high abilities, but because he professed to be very sincere in the Scottish sort of Puritan {{religion}} that was then exceedingly popular among the soldiers.

500|$|Before meeting Lyadov personally, Tchaikovsky {{may have}} been {{softening}} this stance. He decided to present the young composer {{a copy of the}} score of his Manfred Symphony, and once he had actually met the person whom Tchaikovsky authority David Brown called [...] "indolent, fastidious, <b>very</b> <b>private</b> yet very engaging", his attitude toward Lyadov took a sharp turn for the better.
