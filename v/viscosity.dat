5|$|For ships, unlike aircraft, one {{deals with}} {{incompressible}} flows, where change in water density is negligible (a pressure rise close to 1000kPa {{leads to a}} change of only 2–3 kg/m3). This field of fluid dynamics is called hydrodynamics. A ship engineer designs for hydrodynamics first, and for strength only later. The boundary layer development, breakdown, and separation become critical because the high <b>viscosity</b> of water produces high shear stresses. Another consequence of high <b>viscosity</b> is the slip stream effect, in which the ship moves like a spear tearing through a sponge at high velocity.|$|E
5|$|HeliumII is a superfluid, {{a quantum}} {{mechanical}} state (see: macroscopic quantum phenomena) of matter with strange properties. For example, when it flows through capillaries {{as thin as}} 10−7 to 10−8m it has no measurable <b>viscosity.</b> However, when measurements were done between two moving discs, a <b>viscosity</b> {{comparable to that of}} gaseous helium was observed. Current theory explains this using the two-fluid model for helium II. In this model, liquid helium below the lambda point is viewed as containing a proportion of helium atoms in a ground state, which are superfluid and flow with exactly zero <b>viscosity,</b> and a proportion of helium atoms in an excited state, which behave more like an ordinary fluid.|$|E

However, if it is too low, the glass will form droplets instead of being drawn out into a fiber.|$|E
30|$|A {{recent study}} {{has shown that}} NADESs {{physical}} properties can be tailored by adding water as a tertiary component.

The principle of coherence was successfully used to define a number of units of measure based on the centimetre–gram–second system of units (CGS), including the erg for energy, the dyne for force, the barye for pressure, the poise for dynamic <b>viscosity</b> and the stokes for kinematic <b>viscosity.</b>|$|E

The mathematics of artificial <b>viscosity</b> smoothed the shock transition without sacrificing basic physics. Other contributions to fluid dynamics included the classic flow solution to blast waves, and the co-discovery of the ZND detonation model of explosives.

40|$|Abstract Excess {{molar volume}} and <b>viscosities</b> {{are one of}} the {{important}} fundamental data for the design and optimization of chemical process. In this study, excess molar volume and <b>viscosities</b> of 1, 4 Dioxane with two hydrocarbons Bromobenzene and Ethyl benzene have been measured over the entire range of composition at (303. 15, 308. 15, and 313. 15) K.

The calculated excess volumes, VE and deviations in <b>viscosities,</b> Δη exhibited positive and negative values respectively over the whole range of composition in both binary systems. The Redlich-Kister Model was used to correlate excess volumes, VE, and deviations in <b>viscosities,</b> Δη, to derive the binary coefficients and standard deviations of these systems. The fitted outcomes and the calculated data clearly indicated that weak interactions present in two mixtures. It is mainly because of number and position of methyl groups exist in these aromatic hydrocarbons.

25|$|Vibrating viscometers {{can also}} be used to measure <b>viscosity.</b> Resonant, or {{vibrational}} viscometers work by creating shear waves within the liquid. In this method, the sensor is submerged in the fluid and is made to resonate at a specific frequency.
