5|$|One day I chanced {{to see a}} {{performance}} of the Bunraku puppet theater and was <b>very</b> <b>surprised</b> by it. It was in the tone quality, the timbre, of the futazao shamisen, the wide-necked shamisen used in Bunraku, that I first recognized the splendor of traditional Japanese music. I was very moved by it and I wondered why my attention had never been captured before by this Japanese music.|$|E
5|$|Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) and Monica (Courteney Cox) {{organize}} a surprise party for Rachel one month {{ahead of her}} birthday, but Monica's insistence to take responsibility over everything leaves Phoebe with cup and ice duties. However Phoebe vows {{to get back at}} Monica. At the party, the apartment is overflowing with decorations and made of cups, and everyone is enjoying the snow cones Phoebe has made with the ice, meaning all of Monica's food is ignored. Rachel arrives home and is <b>very</b> <b>surprised</b> to find the party, given that Chandler's (Matthew Perry) birthday is before hers.|$|E
25|$|Before long, {{they receive}} a {{transmission}} from the commercial council of Magrathea, informing {{them that the}} planet is closed for business and asking them to leave. They ignore this and later receive another message, noting that nuclear missiles have been sent at the ship. Attempts to evade the missiles fail, and Arthur uses the ship's infinite improbability drive, which ends up turning the missiles into a <b>very</b> <b>surprised</b> looking whale {{and a bowl of}} petunias. Trillian discovers that during the chaos, her mice escaped.|$|E

25|$|Despite the above, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea {{certified}} the Grenfell {{tower building}} work as allegedly conforming to “the relevant provisions”. Council building inspectors visited the site 16 times from August 2014 to July 2016. Kooltherm, a phenolic insulation, {{was also used}} on Grenfell. Kooltherm was never tested with polyethylene core aluminium panels according to the manufacturer. The manufacturer, Kingspan, “would be <b>very</b> <b>surprised</b> if such a system … would ever pass the appropriate British Standard 8414 large-scale test”. Kooltherm’s LABC certificate states phenolic products, “do not meet the limited combustibility requirements” of building regulations.|$|E
25|$|The Eighth Ecumenical Council {{was inaugurated}} on 5 October 869. Besides {{the representatives of}} Rome and Constantinople, the event was {{attended}} by envoys of the Eastern Patriarchs of Jerusalem, Alexandria and Antioch. The Papal legates were unaware of the secret negotiations between Bulgaria and Byzantium and {{did not expect to}} discuss the status of the Bulgarian Church on the council. As a result they were <b>very</b> <b>surprised</b> too see high-ranking Bulgarian envoys attending the official closure of the Council on 28 February 870: the ichirgu-boil Stazis, khan-bagatur Sondoke, khan-tarkan Iliya, sampsis Persiyan and sampsis Alexius Hunol.|$|E
25|$|Young {{was born}} at 55 Chamberlayne Road, Eastleigh, Hampshire, the third of four {{children}} of Edwin Young (18781936), a builder and contractor, and his wife Gertrude Mary (née Brown; 18801945); both of his elder siblings died in childhood. He attended Mayville Preparatory School, Southsea from 1912 to 1915 and then Portsmouth Grammar School from 1915 to 1924, where he showed no particular academic aptitude but very much enjoyed the Officers' Training Corps; when in later life he returned to present prizes, he told the pupils that his parents would have been <b>very</b> <b>surprised</b> {{to see him in}} the hall on speech day because he had never come close to winning any school award.|$|E

25|$|In 200, Xu Chu {{followed}} Cao Cao to the Battle of Guandu {{against the}} northern warlord Yuan Shao. During the battle, Xu Ta (徐他) and some conspirators plotted to assassinate Cao Cao. They feared Xu Chu so they {{waited until he}} went to rest before they entered Cao Cao's tent with swords hidden under their clothes. Xu Chu felt uneasy earlier on, so he had returned to Cao Cao's tent to protect his lord. When Xu Ta and the others showed up in Cao Cao's tent, they were <b>very</b> <b>surprised</b> to see Xu Chu there and could not contain their astonishment. Xu Chu sensed their intentions and killed them. After this incident, Cao Cao trusted Xu Chu even more and would go nowhere without Xu by his side. Xu Chu participated in the Battle of Ye in 204 and received {{the title of a}} Secondary Marquis (關內侯) as a reward for his efforts.|$|E
25|$|Those who are {{suffering}} most keenly, and who have lost most, either of their children by death or their possessions by fire and sword, such as those reconcentrated women in the camps, have the most conspicuous patience, and never express a wish that their men should {{be the ones to}} give way. It must be fought out now, they think, to the bitter end. It is a very costly business upon which England has embarked, and even at such a cost hardly the barest necessities can be provided, and no comforts. It is so strange to think that every tent contains a family, and every family is in trouble–loss behind, poverty in front, sickness, privation and death in the present. But they are very good, and say they have agreed to be cheerful and {{make the best of it}} all. The Mafeking camp folk were <b>very</b> <b>surprised</b> to hear that English women cared a rap about them or their suffering. It has done them a lot of good to hear that real sympathy is felt for them at home, and so I am glad I fought my way here, if only for that reason.|$|E
25|$|Chen Biao {{requested}} {{to serve in}} the military just like his father before him, and was placed in command of 500 troops. He was eager to win the hearts of his soldiers so he treated them well and they were willing to die for him. Once, there was an incident of grand theft and the suspect was Shi Ming (施明), a soldier from the Wunan (無難) camp. Shi Ming had been arrested and interrogated, but he remained fierce, refused to reveal the truth, and even expressed his willingness to die. The Minister of Justice (廷尉) was unable to do anything to him. Sun Quan heard that Chen Biao understood a soldier's mentality well so he ordered Chen to take up Shi Ming's case. Chen Biao had Shi Ming released from his shackles and allowed him to take a bath and have a change of clothes, and treated him to a feast. Shi Ming was so touched by Chen Biao's generous treatment that he confessed to the crime and named his accomplices. Sun Quan was <b>very</b> <b>surprised</b> and impressed with Chen Biao, so he granted a special pardon to Shi Ming to protect Chen's reputation – because Chen would be labelled as a hypocrite if Shi were to be executed after confessing under Chen's kind treatment. Shi Ming's accomplices, on the other hand, were not so lucky as they were all executed. Shi Ming mended his ways and gradually rose through the ranks to become a general in Eastern Wu.|$|E

500|$|Despite being literate, {{giving him}} a chance to become a scholar, young Yue Fei chose the {{military}} path because there had never been any tradition of full-fledged Confucian civil service in his family history. He would stay up all night reading military strategy books and idolized such great historical heroes as Guan Yu. However, the Yue family was much too poor to afford military lessons for their son, so, Yao Dewang, the boy's maternal grandfather, hired Chen Guang (陈广) to teach the eleven-year-old how to wield the Chinese spear. Yao was <b>very</b> <b>surprised</b> when his grandson quickly mastered the spear by the age of thirteen. Zhou was then brought in to continue Yue's military training in archery. Dr. Kaplan describes Zhou as the [...] "most important" [...] of the two teachers.|$|E

500|$|Director Peter Berg said {{prior to}} Hancocks release {{that if the}} film pulls in as much {{business}} as predicted, a sequel, Hancock 2, would likely follow.

[...] In August 2009, Columbia Pictures hired screenwriters Adam Fierro and Glen Mazzara to write the sequel, and the studio plans to bring back the producing team from the original film. [...] Charlize Theron confirmed that she would reprise her role, and Berg said to expect a third actor to star as another figure with powers like Smith's and Theron's characters.|$|E

500|$|Speculation {{surfaced}} that Coolio {{had actually}} given permission but later changed his mind, or that Yankovic's record label {{had lied to}} Yankovic {{in the hopes that}} the song would become popular. Yankovic later stated on VH1's Behind the Music that he had written a sincere letter of apology to Coolio which was never returned, and that Coolio never complained when he received his royalty check from proceeds of the song. A series of photos taken at the XM Satellite Radio booth at the 2006 Consumer Electronics Show, and a post on the [...] "Ask Al" [...] feature on Yankovic's website suggested that Yankovic and Coolio made amends. According to Yankovic, he was <b>very</b> <b>surprised</b> when Coolio came over to chat.

500|$|On 1 January 2013, Higginbotham {{signed for}} Sheffield United on a six-month contract, {{and made his}} debut for the club against their South Yorkshire rivals Doncaster Rovers the same day.

I was <b>very</b> <b>surprised</b> and very happy when I got a phone call on Sunday to say that something could be happening here ...

500|$|During the {{subsequent}} media coverage, {{the game was}} removed from shelves by some vendors, including both UK and international branches of Game and Dixons. Rockstar responded to this move by stating, [...] "we have always appreciated Dixons as a retail partner, and we fully respect their actions. We are naturally <b>very</b> <b>surprised</b> and disappointed that any retailer would choose to pull any game ... We reject any suggestion or association between the tragic events and the sale of Manhunt." [...] Rockstar also reiterated that the game was intended for adults only; [...] "Rockstar Games is a leading publisher of interactive entertainment geared towards mature audiences, and [...] markets its games responsibly, targeting advertising and marketing only to adult consumers ages 18 and older." [...] As the media speculated that the game could be banned completely, there was a [...] "significantly increased" [...] demand for it both from retailers and on Internet auction sites. Giselle Pakeerah responded to this by saying [...] "it doesn't really come as surprise, they say no publicity is bad publicity. But I must say I'm saddened and disappointed. The content of this game is contemptible. It's a societal hazard and my concern is to get it off the shelves as there's enough violence in society already." ...|$|E
500|$|Publishers such as Ubisoft, Electronic Arts, Capcom, and Majesco Entertainment {{continued}} to release exclusive titles for the console, but the Wii's strongest titles remained within its first-party line-up. Analysts speculated {{that this would}} change in time as the Wii's growing popularity persuaded third-party publishers to focus on it; however, some third party developers expressed frustration at low software sales. Goichi Suda, developer of No More Heroes for the Wii, noted that [...] "only Nintendo titles are doing well. This isn't {{just because of the}} current situation in Japan, as this is happening outside Japan. I am <b>very</b> <b>surprised</b> about the reality about Wii, because before I was making this game, I wasn't expecting that Wii would be a console targeted only for non-gamers. I expected more games for hardcore gamers. The reality is different to what I expected." [...] Conversely, the PAL publisher of No More Heroes Rising Star Games were greatly impressed with the game's sales. Goichi Suda later retracted his comment, saying his [...] "point was that No More Heroes, unlike a lot of Nintendo Wii titles currently available is the kind of product that will attract a different kind of consumer to the hardware, i.e. gamers who are looking for a different genre to the products that have been successful on this platform thus far." ...|$|E
