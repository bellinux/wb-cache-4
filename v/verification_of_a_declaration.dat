40|$|The Nuclear Safeguards Unit JRC-IPSC {{started in}} 2000 <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> {{projects}} {{with the aim}} of developing methodologies and tools to support the <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> declarations {{in the context of the}} Additional Protocol. GIS-support systems are now available for nuclear site verification (SIT-V) and declaration (SIT-D). The tool to support on-site inspection (SIT-I) is under development. The <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> country <b>declaration</b> is also based on open source information. To this purpose the NUMAS project started in 2003. NUMAS, Nuclear Fuel Cycle Mapping System, has been designed {{with the aim of}}: • Mapping Nuclear Fuel Cycle (NFC) facilities; • Facilitating the access to, and the selection of, open source relevant documents; • Supporting satellite image interpretation and analysis; • Accessing external databases with complementary relevant information; • Supporting the editing of in-house synthesis documents (e. g. country profiles). NUMAS is <b>a</b> geodatabase <b>of</b> nuclear sites and facilities in the World. The original content of NUMAS comes from open source databases (IAEA-NFCIS, WANO, INSC and other Web sites). As a GIS, NUMAS allows performing spatial queries and spatial analysis on georeferenced data stored into its database. It is essential that sites be referenced at their exact geographical location. A work under way aims to identify the exact geographical co-ordinates of sites through the analysis of open source information. With NUMAS the user can link any number of documents of various types, e. g. satellite images, maps, photos, video clips, to any geographical object of the country and site maps. NUMAS is based on the ESRI ArcView GIS software. NUMAS is also used as a front-end interface to the open source document repository about non-proliferation, managed by the VERITY Information Server. Any time a new document is considered, dealing with a new site, the site is inserted on the country map at its exact location. Documents can be easily be retrieved by clicking on a map. A query is automatically generated using the plant attributes as keywords, which is then sent to VERITY for documents retrieval. Such keywords can also trigger a VERITY topic tree, i. e. a more complex query to identify the documents of interest. The returned documents can be browsed and their source can be displayed on the map. Statistics about documents, e. g. distribution vs. country, year of publication and category are displayed. In the future NUMAS will be equipped with the SIT-V module to support the satellite image interpretation and basic analysis e. g. rectification, change detection, classification. Image interpretation will be supported by the on-line technical information about the nuclear fuel cycle, including how to identify nuclear sites and plants from space (signatures). The paper describes the characteristics of the NUMAS database and in particular its use as a front end to the document repository, showing the advantages <b>of</b> querying <b>a</b> large amount <b>of</b> documents from <b>a</b> GIS.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{reports on}} a method to handle the <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> various {{security}} properties of imperative source code embedded on smart cards. The idea is to combine two program verification approaches: the functional verification at the source code level and the <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> high level properties on a formal model built from the program and its specification. The method presented uses the Caduceus tool, built {{on top of the}} Why tool. Caduceus enables the <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> annotated C program and provides a validation process that we used to generate a high level formal model of the C source code.

40|$|Formal {{verification}} techniques need to {{deal with}} the complexity of the systems being verified. Most often, this problem is solved by taking <b>an</b> abstract model <b>of</b> the system and aiming at <b>a</b> complete <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> approximation <b>of</b> the system. This paper proposes a complementary verification approach, in which the approximation is introduced into the <b>verification</b> algorithm, instead <b>of</b> the system model: we achieve <b>an</b> approximate <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fairly complete and detailed system model. The proposed technique relies on coupling a Genetic Algorithm with <b>a</b> simulator <b>of</b> the system under verification, and is especially suited for verifying performance-related aspects. To prove the effectiveness of our approach, we applied it to the quantitative <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> network protocol: the TCP protocol operating on a given network. A Genetic Algorithm is able to find <b>a</b> configuration <b>of</b> the traffic over the network that sensitizes a critical problem in the TCP protocol that would be difficult to find both with exact techniques and stochastic one...|$|R
