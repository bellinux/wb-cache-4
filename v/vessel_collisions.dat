Canada’s Pacific waters host high cetacean densities and intense maritime traffic, {{and the issue of}} <b>vessel</b> <b>collisions</b> has taken on a high priority in British Columbia (BC) recently due to several major industrial development applications. Spatially-explicit statistical modelling and Geographic Information System (GIS) visualisation techniques identified areas of overlap between shipping activity and waters used by humpback, fin and killer whales. Areas of highest risk were far removed from areas with highest concentrations of people, suggesting that many beach-cast carcasses could go undetected. With few exceptions, high-risk areas were found in geographic bottlenecks, such as narrow straits and passageways. Port expansion and a proposed pipeline for carrying oil from Alberta to BC’s north coast (with associated oil tanker traffic) would increase ship strike risk for all three species. The risk assessments illustrate where ship strikes are most likely to occur, but cannot estimate how many strikes occur. Propeller wounds on live killer whales are common in the region, and fatal collisions have been reported in BC for all three species. Procedures were used to estimate potential mortality limits in accordance {{with a wide range of}} quantitative management objectives from jurisdictions around the world.

This study aims to investigate the failure modes and reliability of bridge systems subjected to <b>vessel</b> <b>collision</b> by centrifuge modeling and numerical modeling. A centrifuge model study into the Jiujiang Bridge accident was conducted. Static numerical analysis was conducted to refine {{the design of the}} impact load for centrifuge tests. Completely Decomposed Granite was used to simulate the riverbed soils; cement-sand mortar with different water mix proportions was used to simulate the bed rock, the model piles and the columns of the model bridge. Model bows were designed to mount in front of the model vessels. Two series of tests with different riverbed soil conditions were conducted. In each series of tests, three aluminium model barges were released to hit one bridge pier at different specified speeds, and the impact energy was increased gradually till the failure of the bridge system. The impact loads resulted from the centrifuge tests were compared with those computed according to the AASHTO provisions. The load patterns included touching, chasing touch and pile back hitting. The characteristics of impact loads such as the impact durations, peak impact loads and various influence factors were investigated. Several aspects of the responses of the bridge system to the <b>vessel</b> <b>collision</b> were studied: the displacements and accelerations of the piers, the bending moments and internal shear forces in the piles, the pore water pressures in the soil, the observed frequencies of the system, the energy dissipation in the collision process, and the failure mode of the model bridge. It was found that three factors; namely, the pile embedment depth, the vessel velocity and vessel tonnage affected both the impact loads and the bridge system response. The failure of the bridge started from the piles under collision, which were subjected to large complex bending and shear forces. The drag forces in the bridge decks led Pier No. 24 to fail in the same direction with Pier No. 23, and Pier No. 25 failed in the opposite direction.

Under the provisions of the MSR, all ships > 300 gross tons are required to report their location, speed, and destination to a shore-based station when entering two key right whale habitats: one in waters off New England and one off coastal Georgia and Florida. In return, reporting ships receive an automatically-generated message, delivered directly to the ship’s bridge, that provides information about right whale vulnerability to <b>vessel</b> <b>collisions</b> and actions mariners can take to avoid collisions. The MSR has been in operation continuously from July 1999 to the present. Archived incoming reports provided a 15 -plus year history of ship operations in these two locations. We analyzed a total of 26, 772 incoming MSR messages logged between July 1999 and December 2013. Most ships that were required to report did so, and compliance rates were generally constant throughout the study period. Self-reported vessel speeds when entering the systems indicated that most ships travelled between 10 and 16 (range = 5 – 20 +) knots. Ship speeds generally decreased in 2009 to 2013 following implementation of vessel speed restrictions. The number of reports into the southern system remained relatively constant following a steady increase through 2007, but numbers in the northern system decreased annually beginning in 2008. If reporting is indicative of long-term patterns in shipping operations, it reflects noteworthy changes in marine transportation. Observed declines in ship traffic are likely attributable to the 2008 – 2009 economic recession, the containerized shipping industry making increased use of larger ships that made fewer trips, and diminished oil/gas US imports as previously inaccessible domestic deposits were exploited.

The proportion of turtles that fled to avoid the vessel decreased significantly as vessel speed increased, and turtles that fled from moderate and fast approaches did so at significantly shorter distances from the vessel than turtles that fled from slow approaches.

The recent development of the UK fishing fleet and the pattern of losses from all causes is investigated for the period 1975 to 1994.

The objective of the paper is to analytically model the AIS Self-Organized Time Division Multiple Access (SOTDMA) traffic pattern at the satellite and to investigate the realistic behavior of SOTDMA via simulations. In the paper we demonstrate that SOTDMA can be seen as a slotted random access protocol at the satellite which noteworthy simplifies the analysis of the protocol performance. Exploiting this connection, an optimization on the frequency of AIS packets generation is derived here, which maximizes the vessel tracking frequency...|$|R
