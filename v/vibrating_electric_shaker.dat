40|$|The {{effect of}} loading density, {{transport}} duration, water temperature, and salinity on survival of young rabbitfish (Siganus guttatus Bloch) under simulated transport conditions was investigated. The rocking motion of transport was simulated by an <b>electric</b> <b>shaker.</b> At ambient temperature and salinity (28 Â°C/ 32 â€°S) increasing loadin density and transport duration resulted in decreasin fish survival rates. When both temperature ant salinity (20 Â°C/ 20 â€°S) were lowered survival improved sinificantly. Dissolved oxygen, water temperature, and salinity were critical factors affecting survivaf of young rabbitfish during simulated transport. Based on the results, a density of 100 fish/L can be packed for 8 hours of transport and 300 fish/L for 2 hours at 28 Â°C and 32 â€°, and about 200 fish/L for 4 hours at 20 Â°C and 20 â€°S...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] In {{this paper}} the {{transverse}} vibration of a fixedfixed end beam attached with dynamic vibration absorbers (DVA) has been analyzed experimentally. The DVA {{is composed of}} a flexible beam with two masses symmetrically mounted at its both sides. The fixed end beam was clamped to a static frame structure where the DVAs were then being attached onto it. One side of end of the beam is harmonically excited in transversal direction by an <b>electric</b> <b>shaker.</b> An accelerometer {{was attached to the}} beam centre to measure its vibration response amplitudes and natural frequencies. The dynamic vibration absorbers were tested in four different conditions according to its location of placement. The beam amplitudes before and after the absorbers attachment were compared and discussed. The experimental results proved that the DVA has significantly absorbed the beam vibration hence reduced the vibration amplitude of the beam structure. The knowledge and result obtained from this study can help engineers control the vibration level of beam structure.

40|$|When a {{magnetic}} ion vibrates in a metal, it inevitably introduces a new channel of hybridization with conduction electrons and in general, the <b>vibrating</b> ion induces <b>electric</b> dipole moment. In such a situation, {{we find that}} magnetic and non-magnetic Kondo effects alternatively occur due to the screening of spin moment and electric dipole moment of vibrating ion. In particular, electric dipolar two-channel Kondo effect is found to occur for weak Coulomb interaction. We also show that magnetically robust heavy-electron state appears near the fixed point of electric dipolar two-channel Kondo effect. We believe that the vibrating magnetic ion opens a new door in the Kondo physics. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

The form now in use with the 8 -foot tunnel at the Navy Yard is considered here. Details of the design and operation of the automatic control system are given. Leads from a Pitot tube are joined to an inverted cup manometer located above a rheostat. When the sliding weight of this instrument is set to a given notch, say for 40 m. p. h, the beam tip <b>vibrates</b> between two <b>electric</b> contacts that feed the little motor. Thus, when the wind is too strong or too weak, the motor automatically throws the rheostat slide forward and backward.

40|$|The use of {{portable}} shakers in olives harvesting is becoming increasingly, especially in Sicily, both {{to reduce the}} costs of production and to assure the oil quality. Nevertheless, it’s well known {{that the use of}} such tools may involve risk of exposure to hand-transmitted vibration. Such exposure to vibrations is a potential cause of muscular/skeletal pains in hand–arm system, and specific pathologies such as Vibration-Induced White Finger (VWF) and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS), Hand–Arm Vibration Syndrome (HAVS). The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the level of exposure to hand-arm vibration of the operators during the use {{of portable}} shakers for olives harvesting. Two different commonly used types of machineries were evaluated performing both laboratory and field tests. The first one was the portable shaker mod. Cifarelli SC 800, provided with an internal combustion engine, consisting of a bar ending with a hook which transmits the vibrations induced by the machine to the branch. The second one was the <b>electric</b> portable <b>shaker</b> mod. Pellenc Olivion P 230, consisting of a bar ending with some teeth representing the harvesting head. Accelerations were measured by using the portable vibrometer HD 2070 (Delta OHM, Italy). The daily action value established by the European Directive 2002 / 44 /EC (5. 0 m/s 2) was exceeded by the two shakers for both hands both in the laboratory and in the filed tests. The shaker which reported the lowest levels of acceleration is the electric comb by Pellenc (shaker B) with A(8) values of about half compared to the hook type (shaker A) ...|$|R

40|$|This book chapter was {{published}} in the book NHV Analysis Techniques for Design and Optimization of Hybrid and <b>Electric</b> Vehicles [© <b>Shaker</b> Verlag] and appears here with the permission of the publisher. In the current framework, hybrid and electric vehicles have the advantage of polluting the environment less than other conventional technology-based vehicles, nevertheless one issue of concern has been the noise impact that they generate. The main objective of this proposal is to improve the acoustic perception of the driver in the cabin. This is the reason why Transfer Path Analysis and Operational Path Analysis methods were performed in an electric vehicle. A comparison between both methods taking into account the structure-borne paths from the motor and the suspension points to the cabin has been performed. One of the aims {{of this study is to}} check the versatility of these methods, commonly used in petrol engine cars. This assessment includes the analysis of the noise contribution of each path depending on the frequency and vehicle speed range and moreover, the path noise impact for harmonic excitation due to the physical components of the electric vehicle...|$|R
40|$|The present {{paper is}} {{split into two}} parts: {{in the first part}} the {{different}} dynamic damage indicators are defined and applied to beam and slab structures under laboratory conditions, whereas the present second part deals with experiments carried out on two real post-tensioned bridges. The damage indicators defined in part one are based on swept sine excitation and esveal the drop of the eigenfrequencies, the changes in damping, the varying dependency range of the first eigenfrequency on excitation force amplitude and the occurrence of higher harmonics, which changed the Total Harmonic Distorsion (THD) and a special transfer-function called TF or FRFsmall. In the first part it was proved that the amount of nonlinearities varies with damage and that harmonic excitation is favorable for good test conditions. In the laboratory this can easily be done using an <b>electric</b> or hydraulic <b>shaker,</b> but on real bridges this kind of excitation becomes more complicated due to the higher forces and the necessity to provide counter bearing for any shaker system. That is why two machines were designed and used to excite big structures harmonically, e. g. real bridges in this part. The different indicators are applied to assess the state of two post-tensioned bridges, which had been in good order and condition before artificial damage in multiple steps was caused. It turns out that the decrease in the eigenfrequencies is the most important damage indicator, provided temperature and mass dependant effects can be eliminated. All other indicators may be used as supplements to give correct tendencies, but no strict limits...|$|R
40|$|Optimum packing {{conditions}} for the transport of hatchery-reared and wild grouper larvae were investigated under simulated condition or actual air transport. Simulation of transport motion was done {{through the use of}} an <b>electric</b> orbit <b>shaker</b> to identify the best packing {{conditions for}} the transport of grouper larvae at various ages. Simulated transport was conducted in hatchery-reared grouper larvae at day 35 (mean TL= 14. 73 mm), 45 (mean TL= 15. 23 mm) and 60 (mean TL= 28. 16 mm) at packing densities of 50, 100 and 200 larvae l âˆ’ 1 and at high (28 Â°C) or low (23 Â°C) temperatures. Packing density of 50 larvae l âˆ’ 1 was best for 45 - and 60 -day-old larvae 8 h transport at low temperature. However, packing density could be increased to a maximum of 100 larvae l âˆ’ 1 8 h transport at 23 Â°C with mortality rates ranging from 2. 3 % to 5. 3 %. The increase in total NH 3 level was dependent on temperature, packing density and size of larvae. High packing density (100 â€“ 200 larvae l âˆ’ 1) and temperature (28 Â°C) resulted in increased NH 3 level and mortality rates during transport. In addition, regardless of the temperature, NH 3 levels were consistently higher for 60 -day-old larvae. Day- 60 grouper larvae displayed strong resistance to handling/mechanical stress compared to 35 -day-old larvae probably because most are already fully metamorphosed at this stage. Based on these results, a packing density of 50 larvae l âˆ’ 1, a temperature of 23 Â°C and larval age of 60 days were considered as the best transport conditions for hatchery-reared grouper larvae. When these transport conditions were used in experiment 2, for 26 -day-old hormone-metamorphosed, 60 -day-old naturally metamorphosed or 60 -day-old pre-metamorphosing hatchery-reared grouper larvae, a 100 % survival rate was attained in all treatments. Seven days of hormone (T 3) treatment did not accelerate metamorphosis of wild-caught transparent grouper larvae (tinies) significantly. Survival rates of hormone-treated transparent tinies (H-tinies), untreated black tinies (B-tinies) and untreated transparent tinies (T-tinies) were also similar after 8 â€“ 9 h air transport (experiment 3). The results of the current study suggest that T 3 treatment did not affect the performance of hatchery-reared and wild-caught transparent tinies/larvae during transport. In addition, mass mortalities of these transported tinies during the nursery phase were associated with nutritional aspect and the sudden confinement of these undomesticated wild-caught grouper to small space rather than transport or hormone treatment effects...|$|R
