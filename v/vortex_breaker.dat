50|$|A <b>vortex</b> <b>breaker</b> is {{a device}} used in {{engineering}} {{to stop the}} formation of a vortex when a fluid (liquid or gas) is drained from a vessel such as a tank or vapor-liquid separator. The formation of vortices can entrain vapor in the liquid stream, leading to poor separation in process steps such as distillation or excessive pressure drop, or causing cavitation of downstream pumps. Vortices can also re-entrain solid particles previously separated from a gas stream in a solid-gas separation device such as a cyclone.|$|E

There are different types of morning glory spillway: Stepped and Smooth types, These spillways (Stepped spillways) pass more flow discharges through themselves in comparison to smooth spillways. Therefore, awareness of flow behavior of these Spillways, help using better and more efficiently. Moreover, using <b>vortex</b> <b>breaker</b> has great effect on passing Flow through morning glory Spillway. To using more efficiently, the risk of flow pressure decrease to less than fluid vapor pressure called cavitations should be prevented as far as possible. At this research, it has been tried to study Hydraulic Behavior of Smooth morning Glory Spillway and compare its result with one type stepped spillway with and without Vortex breakers. From the view point {{of the effects of}} flow regime changes on spillway, changes of step dimensions and the change of number <b>vortex</b> <b>breaker</b> will Studied Effectively. Therefore, two spillway models (one smooth spillway and one stepped spillways) with 5 different <b>Vortex</b> <b>breaker</b> and Three arrangement have been used to assess the Hydraulic Characteristics of flow and cavitations risk.

40|$|Um modelo em acrílico de uma panela (315 toneladas, ArcelorMittal Tubarão), escala 1 : 7, foi utilizado para simular as condições de vazamento do aço, e avaliar as condições de surgimento do vórtice. O momento da inserção do vórtice no canal de vazamento foi determinado através de sensores foto-elétricos e o {{material}} residual foi pesado de modo a se avaliar o rendimento metálico. A influência do tipo de fluxo residual imposto pelas rotas normais de processamento, tais como RH e IRUT, da vazão de drenagem, além de dispositivos antivórtice foi avaliada. O fluxo residual devido ao processamento em RH e IRUT, bem como o nível inicial de aço na panela não afetaram os resultados. O Volume Residual se mostrou função apenas da vazão. Verificou-se que o fluxo de aço era interrompido pela capacidade de abastecimento radial do canal de saída. Como tal, a utilização de quebradores de vórtice se mostrou contra producente. Simulações realizadas induzindo um fluxo rotacional no fluido de forma a aumentar a propensão ao vórtice permitiram confirmar que a injeção de gás pelo fundo da panela e a utilização de barreiras próximas à região de vazamento contribuem para aumentar o rendimento. ____________________________________________________________________________________________________Abstract: A 1 : 7 scale plexiglas {{model of}} a steelmaking ladle (315 tons, ArcelorMittalTubarão) was built {{in order to assess}} the conditions of vortex formation during the final stages of draining. The vortex was detected by a photo-electric sensor and the mass of residual liquid inside the ladle was evaluated after weighing. The influence of the type of residual flow, as dictated by routes of processing such as: RH degasser, IRUT reactor, as well as the drainage flow rate, in addition to anti-vortex devices, was assessed Residual flow due to RH or IRUT processing as well as the initial level of liquid did not affect the results. The mass of residual liquid at vortex onset was influenced by the flow rate only. At the final stages of drainage, the liquid surface collapse was dictated by the bottom ladle capacity of supplying liquid in the radial direction to the outlet. As a consequence <b>vortex</b> <b>breakers</b> were found deleterious under these set of conditions. A rotational flow was induced in order to increase the likelyhood of vortex formation. In this case gas injection through the pouring nozzle, <b>vortex</b> <b>breakers,</b> slopped bottoms have been found effective...|$|R

Submerged triangular-shaped obstacles representing bars and reefs were installed on a 1 / 30 concrete slope to cause wave breaking. Seaward and shoreward slopes of the obstacles were varied, as was the deepwater wave steepness Ho/Lo, which resulted in 108 monochromatic wave tests and 12 irregular wave tests. Empirical expressions were determined for the wave properties investigated, which includedbreaker type, height, and depth; plunge, splash, and penetration distance; <b>breaker</b> <b>vortex</b> area; wave decay; wave reflection; and wave runup. Additionally, data acquired from other studies involving plane slopes were reanalyzed to determine breaker indices and plunge distance. Differences were found between wave properties on plane slopes and barred profiles. Plunging and collapsing breakers were predominate for regular waves breaking over bars and reefs, whereas spilling breakers occurred on the plane slope. The strength of return flow (Continued...|$|R

40|$|Wind {{power has}} the {{potential}} to provide access to electricity to areas lacking the resources to create industrial power plants, as well as supplement residential energy supplies. The low resource investment and ease of installation make it ideal for these scenarios; however, it is limited by the availability of a stable power source. Only 13 % of the world’s land area experiences wind speeds high enough to be usable by current technology. To improve this percentage, the use of wind concentrators has been suggested. A turbine within a concentrator would experience a higher wind speed than the surrounding body of air, reducing the ambient wind speed requirement to generate electricity. In this thesis, several concentrator designs were tested. In this thesis, several designs of the following concentrator components were tested: a flow straightener, <b>vortex</b> <b>breaker,</b> and pressure relief slits. Fluent 12. 1, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program, was used to model air flow patterns through a prototype wind concentrator and optimize its performance. Through this method, it was determined that a concentrator with a trumpet shaped entrance and exit is effective at concentrating wind energy. A long, thin center cone was most effective at accelerating a wind stream, while vortex breakers were ineffective. Maximum velocities were obtained with the addition of pressure-relief slits in the inlet portion. With an ambient inlet air stream of 2 m/s, CFD results predicted the concentrator would accelerate the air velocity to 5. 17 m/s. The concentrator also predicted similar accelerations at higher inlet velocities. This data was validated by results provided by WEST Wind Power Inc. Their prototype, built from the optimized model’s blueprints, observed wind speeds in the device throat within 8 % of the predicted values...|$|E
40|$|When {{designing}} slim {{structures such as}} {{columns and}} chimneys, their dynamic behaviour {{has to be taken}} into account in calculating their dimensions. When exposed to wind, steel structures are particularly susceptible to vibrations because of their low damping. Various kinds of stimuli can initiate vibrations in a slim structure. Vortex excitation occurs when the frequency of the vortex coincides with the natural frequency of the structure. In addition to high amplitudes ovalling of cylindrical shells can also occur at low pressures. The vortex-induced amplitudes may be reduced by means of aerodynamic devices (<b>vortex</b> <b>breakers)</b> or damping devices applied to the structure. Aeroelastic instabilities and interference effects may also cause damage to such structures. One form of this instability is so-called galloping. Galloping is a self-induced vibration of a flexible structure in transverse bending mode. If such structures are arranged in groups, they can affect one another mutually. This phenomenon is known as „interference galloping“. These effects depend principally on the ration between the distance and the diameter of the structures in question. In the case of high amplitudes, special steps have to be taken to reduce the resulting stresses. As a rule poor structural damping is the reason for strong movements caused by wind. By increasing the damping, it is possible to construct very tall slim buildings with a high degree of safety. The article outlines the various means of damping and their technical implementation. A concept for passive vibration damping by means of fluid dampers is proposed using a 125 -metre high chimney as an example...|$|R
