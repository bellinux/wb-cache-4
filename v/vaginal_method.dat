30|$|Since {{the end of}} the 1950 s two {{different}} standard methods for surgical management of genital prolapse have competed with each other: the vaginal approach for fascia repair, reinforcing the structures using autologous tissues; and the abdominal method, whether endoscopic or not, reinforcing the fascia and using prostheses for suspension. The surgical goals are simple and identical: to correct each element contributing to the prolapse and any associated urinary problems [1, 2], but the multiplicity of techniques available is in itself proof of how difficult the question is [3, 4, 5, 6]. In addition to differences between schools, the less aggressive <b>vaginal</b> <b>method,</b> despite its high rate of recurrence, was more indicated for elderly, less active patients who are more fragile with respect to anaesthesia and major surgery.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Season {{of birth}} {{is one of}} the {{environmental}} factors that may affect birth weight. The aimof this study was to assess the relationship between seasonal patterns and birth weight in an educationalcenter in Iran, 2010. Materials and Methods: In this cross sectional study, the check list was used for checking of 3076 women that delivered on <b>vaginal</b> <b>method</b> (NVD). Exclusion criteria included twin delivery, intrauterinefetal death (IUFD), abortion in current pregnancy and delivery by caesarean. Results: 81. 2 % women were primiparous and 53. 3 percent of newborns were boys. The gestational ageof 7. 4, and 92. 6 percent women was preterm and term, respectivly. Average neonatal birth weight was 3248. 18 ± 458 and women mean age was 25. 33 ± 5. 7 years. There was a significant relationship betweenseasonal changes and the mean birth weight (P= 0. 018) as the highest weight was in spring and lowest insummer. The highest average birth weight term was the 21 March to 20 April and the lowest month was the 23 August to 22 September (P = 0. 064). Conclusion: Although birth weight can be different with seasonal changes, the role of otherenvironmental factors should not be ignored...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Emerging {{evidence}} {{from a recent}} pilot universal newborn hearing screening (UNHS) programme suggests that the burden of obstetric complications associated with mode of delivery {{is not limited to}} maternal and perinatal mortality but may also include outcomes that undermine optimal early childhood development of the surviving newborns. However, the potential pathways for this association have not been reported particularly {{in the context of a}} resource-poor setting. This study therefore set out to establish the pattern of delivery and the associated neonatal outcomes under a UNHS programme. Methods A cross-sectional study in which all consenting mothers who delivered in an inner-city tertiary maternity hospital in Lagos, Nigeria from May 2005 to December 2007 were enrolled during the UNHS programme. Socio-demographic, obstetric and neonatal factors independently associated with vaginal, elective and emergency caesarean deliveries were determined using multinomial logistic regression analyses. Results Of the 4615 mothers enrolled, 2584 (56. 0 %) deliveries were vaginal, 1590 (34. 4 %) emergency caesarean and 441 (9. 6 %) elective caesarean section. Maternal age, parity, social class and all obstetric factors including lack of antenatal care, maternal HIV and multiple gestations were associated with increased risk of emergency caesarean delivery compared with vaginal delivery. Only parity, lack of antenatal care and prolonged/obstructed labour were associated with increased risk of emergency compared with elective caesarean delivery. Infants delivered by <b>vaginal</b> <b>method</b> or by emergency caesarean section were more likely to be associated with the risk of sensorineural hearing loss but less likely to be associated with hyperbilirubinaemia compared with infants delivered by elective caesarean section. Emergency caesarean delivery was also associated with male gender, low five-minute Apgar scores and admission into special care baby unit compared with vaginal or elective caesarean delivery. Conclusions The vast majority of caesarean delivery in this population occur as emergencies and are associated with socio-demographic factors as well as several obstetric complications. Mode of delivery is also associated with the risk of sensorineural hearing loss and other adverse birth outcomes that lie on the causal pathways for potential developmental deficits. </p...|$|E

40|$|Objective: We {{previously}} described an endoscopic-assisted transvaginal mesh excision technique. This study compares surgical outcomes after transvaginal mesh excision vs endoscopic-assisted transvaginal mesh excision. In addition, we reviewed our postoperative outcomes with excision via laparotomy. Study Design This was an inclusive retrospective analysis of patients presenting to our institution from 1997 to 2006 for surgical management of vaginal erosion of permanent mesh after sacrocolpopexy. Three techniques were utilized: transvaginal, endoscopic-assisted transvaginal, and laparotomy. For the patients undergoing transvaginal excision, data recorded included number {{and type of}} excisions performed, number of prior excisions performed at outside facilities, intraoperative and postoperative complications (including blood transfusions, pelvic abscess, or bowel complications), use of postoperative antibiotics, persistent symptoms of vaginal bleeding and discharge at follow-up, and demographic characteristics. The intraoperative and postoperative complications and the postoperative symptoms were recorded for the laparotomy cases. Results: Thirty-one patients underwent transvaginal mesh excision during this time period: 17 endoscopic-assisted transvaginal and 14 transvaginal without endoscope assistance. In addition, a total of 7 patients underwent abdominal excision via laparotomy. Comparison of the 2 vaginal methods revealed {{no difference in the}} demographics or success rate, with success defined as no symptoms at follow-up. Endoscopic-assisted transvaginal excision was successful in 7 of 17 patients and transvaginal without endoscopic assistance in 9 of 13 patients (1 patient excluded for lack of follow-up data) for a total vaginal success rate of 53. 3 %. No intraoperative and only minor postoperative complications occurred with either <b>vaginal</b> <b>method.</b> Three patients underwent 3 vaginal attempts to achieve complete symptom resolution. The average follow-up time for the entire vaginal group was 14 months. Seven patients ultimately required abdominal excision and all had symptom resolution, however, not without complications. Two patients had bowel injury during lysis of adhesions requiring bowel resection in 1 case and repair in another, 1 had a postoperative wound infection with breakdown, 1 was readmitted for postoperative fever requiring antibiotics, and 1 had an acute coronary syndrome requiring transfer to the cardiology service. Conclusion: Transvaginal excision of mesh with or without endoscopy appears to be a safe and less invasive method for excision of eroded vaginal mesh after prior abdominal sacrocolpopexy. Up to 3 vaginal excision attempts may be necessary to achieve symptom resolution, and complete removal of mesh will likely improve outcomes with the transvaginal technique. Although abdominal excision can be considered the gold standard for excision of eroded mesh, it is not without potentially increased morbidity...|$|E
40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the issue of the communication of a midwife with a woman during childbirth and in the puerperium. The theoretical part is divided into two chapters. The first chapter specifies in detail the concept and process of communication, the way communication is perceived and its importance; it also defines the factors influencing the communication process. The second chapter describes the verbal, paralinguistic and non-verbal elements of communication used during childbirth and in the puerperium. The chapter describes in detail the communication in the first, second, third and fourth stage of childbirth, after childbirth communication, and also focuses on the specifics of communication with a client with changes mental state (puerperium blues, puerperium depression and puerperium psychosis). The purpose of the work was to identify how clients perceive the communication of midwives in the labour ward and during the puerperium. The first research question addresses the women 's satisfaction with midwifes´ communication in the labour wards. The second research question addresses the women 's satisfaction with midwives´ communication during the puerperium stage. For implementation of the empirical part of the thesis qualitative research survey was used. The technique for collecting data created an individualized semi-structured interview where the main objective was to obtain detailed information in the researched field. The conversation was recorded on a dictaphone and then transferred into electronic version and text analysis was performed. Clients' answers are distinguished in italics. Verbal consent to the interview was always provided by the clients voluntarily, the clients were informed {{about the fact that the}} interview is anonymous and the results of the research would be used only for the purposes of the bachelor thesis. The research group consisted of nine clients from 5 days to 2 months after delivery. While six clients had spontaneous vaginal delivery, for one client an instrumental <b>vaginal</b> <b>method</b> VEX had to be used, and then for two clients the pregnancies were terminated surgically by caesarean section. The interview was conducted on the basis of two meetings, with a time span (1 week) between the interviews. The interview was conducted using 11 previously prepared questions for each area of research (the labour ward, the puerperium) and the clients were always also asked additional questions. The first three were identification questions; the other questions already dealt with communication in specific stages (labour ward, puerperium). The survey was conducted between May and June 2017 including. The research was, for its clarity, divided into two parts; to communication with the client in the labour ward and to communication with the client during the puerperium, following that the research was elaborated into categories and charts, which contain essential information and the results of the research. By analysing the results of the qualitative research, some conclusions and answers to research questions have been reached. The first research question addressed the satisfaction of clients with communication in the labour ward. A research survey found that patients were provided with information on the course of labor, methods of pain management. In addition, clients were informed about procedures during childbirth. The clients evaluated the approach of midwives positively on the basis of the support provided to them during delivery, and they were largely satisfied with the communication. The research also revealed that only four clients were adequately and fully informed about pain management methods. The second research question was whether the clients were satisfied with the communication at the post-mortem station. From the research, it was found that clients were provided with too much information within a short period of time. The midwife's approach was evaluated positively...|$|E

The values on individual days in the oestrous period in Groups 1, 2 and 3 were also significantly different from Group 4 (P< 0 - 01). The findings are discussed in relation to the mode of action of methallibure and to the <b>vaginal</b> biopsy <b>method</b> of pregnancy diagnosis in pigs...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Newborns {{should be}} {{evaluated}} immediately after birth and the traditional way of assessing {{is to use the}} Apgar score. The aim {{of this study was to}} estimate the Apgar score and evaluate the first 24 hour- clinical outcome of babies born at Yazd hospitals. Methods: In a descriptive cross-sectional study, Apgar score was assessed for 462 newborns at the 4 centers of Afshar, Madar, Kargar and Bahman of Yazd. 262 out of 462 babies were born by vaginal delivery and the other 200 babies were delivered by cesarean section. The data was analyzed by using both parametric and non parametric tests. Apgar score of 7 and less was considered as abnormal. Results: In this study, the type of delivery (cesarean section or <b>vaginal</b> delivery), <b>method</b> of anesthesia (epidural or general) and gender of newborn had no impact on Apgar score, but prematurity, low birth weight, premature rupture of membranes, inadequate prenatal care and the level of maternal education had influence on reduction of the Apgar score. Those babies who were in good condition and were kept beside their mothers had the highest Apgar score. Conclusion: Apgar score is a useful measure to assess the general condition of the newborns at birth and for the prediction of their morbidity, mortality and neurologic impairment...|$|R
40|$|This {{proof of}} {{principle}} study aimed {{to define a}} new and simple strategy for detection of endometrial cancer using epigenetic markers. We investigated DNA iso-lated from vaginal secretion collected from tampon for aberrant methylation of five genes (CDH 13, HSPA 2, MLH 1, RASSF 1 A, and SOCS 2) using MethyLight in 15 patients with endometrial cancer and 109 patients without endometrial cancer. All endometrial cancer patients revealed three or more methylated genes, whereas 91 % (99 of 109) of the patients without endo-metrial cancer had no or fewer than three genes methylated in their <b>vaginal</b> secretion. The <b>methods</b> developed in this study {{provide the basis for}} a prospective clinical trial to screen asymptomatic women who are at high risk for endometrial cancer.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{mechanisms}} for {{the association between}} birth by cesarean section and atopy and asthma are largely unknown. Objective To examine whether cesarean section results in neonatal secretion of cytokines {{that are associated with}} increased risk of atopy and/or asthma in childhood. To examine whether the association between mode of delivery and neonatal immune responses is explained by exposure to the maternal gut flora (a marker of the <b>vaginal</b> flora). <b>Methods</b> CBMCs were isolated from 37 neonates at delivery, and secretion of IL- 13, IFN-γ, and IL- 10 (at baseline and after stimulation with antigens [dust mite and cat dander allergens, phytohemagglutinin, and lipopolysaccharide]) was quantified by ELISA. Total and specific microbes were quantified in maternal stool. The relation between mode of delivery and cord blood cytokines was examined by linear regression. The relation between maternal stool microbes and cord blood cytokines was examined by Spearman's correlation coefficients. Results Cesarean section was associated with increased levels of IL- 13 and IFN-γ. In multivariate analyses, cesarean section was associated with an increment of 79. 4 pg/ml in secretion of IL- 13 by CBMCs after stimulation with dust mite allergen (P Conclusion Cesarean section is associated with increased levels of IL- 13 and IFN-γ, perhaps because of lack of labor and/or reduced exposure to specific microbes (e. g., gram-positive anaerobes) at birth. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. This study aims {{to analyze}} the cesarean section (CS) rates and vaginal {{delivery}} rates in tertiary hospitals of China, explore the costs of two different deliveries, and examine the relative influencing factors of the costs in both CS and <b>vaginal</b> deliveries. <b>Methods.</b> 30, 168 anonymized obstetric medical cases were selected from three sample tertiary hospitals in Chongqing Municipality from 2011 to 2013. Chi-square {{test was used to}} compare the distributions of CS and vaginal deliveries under different indicators. Mann–Whitney test and Kruskal-Wallis test were adopted {{to analyze the}} differences under different items. Multiple linear regression was used to determine the influencing factors of the costs of different delivery modes. Results. (1) The rates of CS were 69 %, 65. 5 %, and 59. 2 % in the three sample tertiary hospitals in Chongqing from 2011 to 2013. (2) The costs and the length of stay of CS were greater than those of vaginal delivery, which had significant differences (P< 0. 005). (3) The areas, length of stay, age, medical insurance, and modes of delivery were the influencing factors of both CS and vaginal delivery costs. Discussion. The high CS rates in China must be paid significant attention. The indicators of two modes of delivery should be regulated strictly. CS rate reduction and saving medical resources will be the benefits if vaginal delivery is chosen by pregnant women...|$|R
40|$|Objective. Vulvar and vaginal {{reconstruction}} can {{be challenging}} for the reconstructive surgeon. The reconstructive goal is to provide wound healing, adequate function, and acceptable appearance. In the present study, we introduce a new design called the ""angel wing"" flap, which is a modification of a transposition flap {{and is based on}} the perforator concept for vulvar and <b>vaginal</b> reconstruction. <b>Methods.</b> From January 2002 to becember 2013, 23 women underwent reconstruction of vulvar and vaginal defects. Causative factors were vulvar cancer in 14 patients, extramammary Paget&# 39;s disease in 2, vulvar dysplasia in 5, and combined vulvar and vaginal cancer in 2 patients. Results. A total of 41 flaps were applied. All patients underwent surgical reconstruction in a single step using the ""angel wing"" flap. Flap size ranged from 4 x 7 to 13 x 6 cm(2) and the operative duration for reconstructive surgery ranged from 30 to 100 min. All the flaps survived with good coverage of the defect. Mean follow-up time after the procedure was 16. 1 months (range, 6 - 30 months). Conclusion. In this article, we introduce a simple and easy reconstructive procedure of the ""angel wing"" flap. For restoring function, as well as for esthetic purposes, the flap was designed in accordance with the defect since the natural contour of the vulva and vagina is three-dimensional.

40|$|Objective To {{assess whether}} {{the risk of}} severe blood loss is {{increased}} in semi-sitting and sitting position, and if so, to which extent blood loss from perineal damage is responsible for this finding. Design Secondary analysis of data from a large trial. Setting Primary care midwifery practices in the Netherlands. Population About 1646 low-risk women who had a spontaneous <b>vaginal</b> delivery. <b>Methods</b> Blood loss was measured using a weighing scale and measuring jug. Logistic regression {{analysis was used to}} examine the net effects of birthing position and perineal damage on blood loss greater than 500 ml. Main outcome measures Mean total blood loss and incidence of blood loss greater than 500 ml and 1000 ml. Results Mean total blood loss and the incidence of blood loss greater than 500 ml and 1000 ml were increased in semi-sitting and sitting position. In logistic regression analysis, the interaction between birthing position and perineal damage was almost significantly associated with an increased risk of blood loss greater than 500 ml. Semi-sitting and sitting position were only significant risk factors among women with perineal damage (OR 1. 30, 95 % CI 1. 00 – 1. 69 and OR 2. 25, 95 % CI 1. 37 – 3. 71, respectively). Among women with intact perineum, no association was found. Conclusions Semi-sitting and sitting birthing positions only lead to increased blood loss among women with perineal damage. ...|$|R
