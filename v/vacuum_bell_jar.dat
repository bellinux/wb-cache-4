50|$|The {{lower edge}} of a <b>vacuum</b> <b>bell</b> <b>jar</b> forms a flange of heavy glass, ground smooth on the bottom for better contact. The base of the jar is equally heavy and flattened. A smear of vacuum grease is usually applied between them. As the vacuum forms inside, it creates a {{considerable}} compression force, {{so there is no}} need to clamp the seal. For this reason, a bell jar cannot be used to contain pressures above atmospheric, only below.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a flexible large strain sensor made from ethylenedioxythiophene deposited on silicone rubber (Ecoflex® 00 - 30) via vacuum assisted vapor phase polymerization (VPP) process. EDOT was used {{due to its}} stability when exposed to the atmosphere. VPP is a very simple process requiring only a <b>vacuum</b> <b>bell</b> <b>jar</b> and a vacuum pump. Ferrite chloride (FeCl 3) dissolved in tethrahydrofuran was used as the oxidant to make the resulting poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) conductive. THF was used because it swells Ecoflex® for better infusion of oxidant and PEDOT adherence. The sensor performs reliably up to 80 % strain with a gauge factor of ~ 2. 4 and small hysteresis...|$|E
40|$|Kapton {{polyimide}} wiring insulation {{was found}} to be vulnerable to pyrolization, arc tracking, and flashover when momentary short-circuit arcs have occurred on aircraft power systems. Short-circuit arcs between wire pairs can pyrolize the polyimide resulting in a conductive char between conductors that may sustain the arc (arc tracking). Furthermore, the arc tracking may spread (flashover) to other wire pairs within a wire bundle. Polyimide Kapton will also be used as the insulating material for the flexible current carrier (FCC) of Space Station Freedom (SSF). The FCC, with conductors in a planar type geometric layout as opposed to bundles, is known to sustain arc tracking at proposed SSF power levels. Tests were conducted in a <b>vacuum</b> <b>bell</b> <b>jar</b> that was designed to conduct polyimide pyrolysis, arc tracking, and flashover studies on samples of SSF's FCC. Test results will be reported concerning the minimal power level needed to sustain arc tracking and the FCC susceptibility to flashover. Results of the FCC arc tracking tests indicate that only 22 volt amps were necessary to sustain arc tracking (proposed SSF power level is 400 watts). FCC flashover studies indicate that the flashover event is highly unlikely...|$|E
40|$|A short {{description}} of the program Stardust whose goal is to study the formation and properties of high temperature particles and gases, including silicate and carbonaceous materials, that are of interest in astrophysics and planetary science, is given. The international program {{was carried out in}} microgravity conditions in parabolic flight. A {{description of the}} laboratory equipment, conceived to perform experimental tests in reduced gravity conditions, and which is based on the gas evaporation technique, is given. The gas evaporation technique utilizes one or more heated crucible to vaporize solids materials (SiO, Mg) in a low pressure of inert or reactive gas inside of a <b>vacuum</b> <b>bell</b> <b>jar.</b> The vapor pressures of the materials are controlled by the temperature of the crucibles. The temperature and pressure of inert gas are also controlled. By varying the vapor pressure relative to the gas temperature and pressure, the conditions for substantial grain condensation can be controlled and grain formation measured using light scattering techniques. Thus the partial pressure for grain condensation, can be measured as a function of temperature. The gas evaporation technique has the advantage that complex chemical systems can be studied by using multiple crucibles each containing solid source material. Experimental results and future trends are addressed...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Bell</b> <b>Jar</b> Orchestra {{focuses on}} aesthetising the {{materiality}} of sound. It brings a heightened visibility to the physicality {{of sound and}} explores the construction of meaning {{in relation to the}} medium through which sound travels. The instruments draw reference to the historicity of science and in particular the beginnings of modern science in the 17 th century. The 17 th century gave rise to the empirical laboratory, a place for the observation and measurement of physical phenomena. This period questioned the value of speculative rationalism and proposed a methodology for empirical enquiry through demonstrable and repeatable laboratorial experiments. It gave rise to a set fundamental laws which established the cornerstones of modern science. One such law, Boyle’s Law, by Irishman Robert Boyle, describes the inverse relationship between air pressure and volume. The apparatus of Robert Boyle’s laboratory was typical of a 17 th century natural philosopher; air pumps, <b>bell</b> <b>jars,</b> test tubes, thermometers and barometers, devices to carry out experiments with air pressure, heat, vacuums etc. One aspect of the research project is to allow for a deepened investigation and appropriation of the methodologies of 17 th century science and to employ the apparatus, techniques and scientific laws of the 17 th century to manipulate and structure sonic material into musical form. This research works toward the construction of a series of compositions for a <b>bell</b> <b>jar</b> orchestra. Inside each <b>bell</b> <b>jar</b> will be an automated mechanical hammer striking a tuned bell. The volume of sound emitting from each <b>bell</b> <b>jar</b> is contingent upon the air pressure inside the <b>bell</b> <b>jar.</b> The air pressure inside the <b>bell</b> <b>jar</b> is controlled by air pumps. When the <b>bell</b> <b>jar</b> is a <b>vacuum</b> no sound is heard, when the <b>bell</b> <b>jar</b> is filled with air, the sound will be at its loudest. By dynamically controlling the flow of air through the <b>bell</b> <b>jars,</b> the loudness and softness of the sound can be controlled, producing a rich, dynamically changing interlacing of sonic material across all 8 <b>bell</b> <b>jars.</b> The ebb and flow of musical loudness and softness is a function of air pressure inside the <b>bell</b> <b>jars.</b> The research recontextualises the intellectual heritage of the 17 th century scientific enlightenment and aestheticises the scientific methodologies, apparatus and laws which stem from the 17 th century...|$|R

40|$|The {{specific}} {{thermal capacity}} and heat dissipation rate for lithium ion cells containing LiNiO 2 and mixed oxide (75 %LiCoO 2 + 25 %LiNiO 2) as cathode materials are compared. The experimental measurements were made using a radiative calorimeter {{consisting of a}} copper chamber maintained at - 168 C by circulating liquid nitrogen and enclosed in a <b>vacuum</b> <b>bell</b> <b>jar.</b> The specific thermal capacity was determined based on warm-up and cool-down transients. The heat dissipation rate was calculated from the values measured for heat radiated and stored, and the resulting values were corrected for conductive heat dissipation through the leads. The specific heat was 1. 117 J/ C-g for the LiNiO 2 cell and 0. 946 J/ C-g for the 75 %LiCoO 2, 25 %LiNiO 2 cell. Endothermic cooling {{at the beginning of}} charge was very apparent for the cell containing 75 %LiCoO 2, 25 %LiNiO 2 as the cathode. Exothermic heating began at a higher state of charge for the cell with the 75 %LiCoO 2, 25 %LiNiO 2 cathode compared to the LiNiO 2 cathode cell. During discharge, the rate of heat dissipation increased with increase in the discharge current for both types of cells. The maximum heat dissipated at C/ 5 discharge was 0. 065 W and 0. 04 W for the LiNiO 2 and 75 %LiCoO 2, 25 %LiNiO 2 cells, respectively, The thermoneutral potential showed variability toward the end of discharge. The plateau region of the curves was used to calculate average thermoneutral potentials of 3. 698 V and 3. 837 V for the LiNiO 2 cell and the 75 %LiCoO 2, 25 %LiNiO 2 cell, respectively...|$|E
