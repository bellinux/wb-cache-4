The tumor was large polypoid and ulcerated one. Histologically, the tumor consisted of the following three elements: giant cell sarcomatoid carcinoma (70 % in area), squamous cell carcinoma (20 % in area), and papillary urothelial transitional cell carcinoma (10 % in area). The former two elements were invasive into the peribladder fat tissue, while the latter one element invaded into the submucosa. There were gradual merges between the giant <b>cell</b> sarcomatoid <b>element</b> and squamous <b>cell</b> carcinoma <b>element.</b> Apparent transitions were not seen between the transitional <b>cell</b> carcinoma <b>element</b> and the giant <b>cell</b> sarcomatoid <b>element</b> or the squamous <b>cell</b> carcinoma <b>element.</b> Immunohistochemically, the giant <b>cell</b> sarcomatoid <b>element</b> was positive for various kinds of cytokeratins and vimentin while the squamous and transitional <b>cell</b> carcinoma <b>elements</b> were positive for various kinds of cytokeratins and negative for vimentin.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{focuses on}} the {{structural}} design of the microscopic architecture of a lattice material with regular octet-truss cell topology and on the multiscale design of an axially loaded member manufactured {{of this type of}} cellular solid. The rationale followed here hinges on the coincidence of the failure modes of a stretching dominated lattice material, which experiences two types of microscopic failure modes, namely, elastic buckling and plastic yielding. A lattice material that fails by the elastic buckling of its <b>cell</b> <b>elements</b> without reaching the plastic yielding is far from optimum. To avoid this event and improve the material strength, we first start to tailor the structural efficiencies of the <b>cell</b> <b>elements.</b> We show that by shaping the <b>cell</b> <b>element</b> cross-sections, the lattice material buckling resistance can increase until it equals the <b>cell</b> <b>element</b> yield strength, thereby exploiting fully the lattice material strength. The coincidence of these two failure modes is the structural criterion used to develop selection charts for the micro-structural design of the octet-truss lattice material. In {{the second part of the}} paper, we examine the design of a structural column manufactured by regular octet-truss lattice material. We show that to maximize the structural failure resistance at both the structural and the material levels, the global buckling and the yielding failure of the column must occur simultaneously with the microscopic failure modes of the lattice material, namely the local buckling and the yielding of its microscopic <b>cell</b> <b>elements.</b> The paper concludes by illustrating how the micro-truss geometry and the column cross-section can be simultaneously designed to fully exploit the strength of the material and the overall macrostructure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract During normal kidney function, {{there are}} {{routinely}} wide swings in proximal tubule fluid flow and proportional changes in Na + reabsorption across tubule epithelial cells. This “glomerulotubular balance ” {{occurs in the}} absence of any substantial change in <b>cell</b> <b>volume,</b> and is thus a challenge to coordinate luminal membrane solute entry with peritubular membrane solute exit. In this work, linear optimal control theory is applied to generate a configuration of regulated transporters that could achieve this result. A previously developed model of rat proximal tubule epithelium is linearized about a physiologic reference condition; the approximate linear system is recast as a dynamical system; and a Riccati equation is solved to yield the optimal linear feedback that stabilizes Na + flux, <b>cell</b> <b>volume,</b> and <b>cell</b> pH. The first observation is that optimal feedback control is largely consigned to three physiologic variables, <b>cell</b> <b>volume,</b> <b>cell</b> electrical potential, and lateral intercellular hydrostatic pressure. Parameter modulation by <b>cell</b> <b>volume</b> stabilizes <b>cell</b> volume; parameter modulation by electrical potential or interspace pressure act to stabilize Na + flux and cell pH.
