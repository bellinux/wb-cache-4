25|$|It is {{well known}} that strict churches are strong and growing in the {{contemporary}} United States, whereas liberal ones are declining. For Iannaccone's religious experience is a jointly produced collective good. Thus members of a church face a collective action problem. Strict churches, which often impose costly and esoteric requirements on their members, are able to solve this problem by weeding out potential free riders, since only the <b>very</b> <b>committed</b> would join the church {{in the face of such}} requirements. Consistent with the notion that religious experience is a collective good, Iannaccone et al. show that churches that extract more resources from their members (in the form of time and money) tend to grow in membership.|$|E

The KGB tried repeatedly to recruit him, but was never successful; Oppenheimer did not betray the United States. In addition, he had several persons removed from the Manhattan Project who had sympathies to the Soviet Union. Haynes, Klehr and Vassiliev also state Oppenheimer [...] "was, in fact, a concealed member of the CPUSA in the late 1930s". According to biographer Ray Monk: [...] "He was, in a very practical and real sense, {{a supporter of the}} Communist Party.

His first start since 22 August 2009 came in a 2–2 home draw with Cambridge United on 22 September to fill in for Alex Lawless. This was the first of five consecutive matches to be started by Mackin before he had a six-match spell on the substitutes' bench. This came to an end when he started in the 1–0 victory away to AFC Wimbledon on 21 November 2009 and his performance drew praise from Foyle.|$|E

2500|$|Satoshi Kanazawa {{said that}} part of the success of eHarmony can be {{explained}} by the high cost of entry in terms of the amount of time required to answer the initial questionnaire—over 18 hours, although other sources put the time to complete the relationship questionnaire at approximately one hour. Using Laurence Iannaccone's original idea that success of fundamentalist churches is explained by the high demands imposed on their members, Kanazawa hypothesizes that a similar self-selection mechanism is at work with eHarmony: [...] "they select their members very carefully, and only admit those who are <b>very</b> <b>committed</b> (or desperate; if anyone who chooses to join eHarmony is truly desperate to get married, then it can potentially and partially explain why it produces such a high proportion of all marriages in the US)." [...] Another factor suggested by Dan Ariely is the limited choice of partners offered, which may make the decision easier for some.|$|E

Although Bandslam was commercially unsuccessful, Hudgens's performance received praise from critics. David Waddington of the North Wales Pioneer noted that Hudgens [...] "outshines the rest of the cast, failing to fit in with the outcast narrative and making the inevitable climactic ending all the more expected", and Philip French of The Guardian compared her acting to Thandie Newton and Dorothy Parker. Hudgens made a return to theater productions and starred in the musical Rent as Mimi. The stage production ran from August6–8, 2010 at the Hollywood Bowl. Her involvement in the production drew negative comments, but director Neil Patrick Harris defended his decision with casting Hudgens by saying, [...] "Vanessa [...] is awesome. She's a friend.

2500|$|In early September, it was {{reported}} that Kat would confess the affair to Alfie, but would refuse to name the man involved.

He opined that Alfie believes Kat would not lie to him after having affairs in the past, but does not believe her excuses when she receives flowers from her lover. This leads to Kat confessing. Richie said that Alfie's [...] "heart [...] break in two". Richie went on to describe the Moons' marriage as [...] "a bit staid" [...] because Alfie is [...] "set in his ways" [...] while Kat is [...] "out looking for a bit of fun." [...] He explained that Alfie is <b>very</b> <b>committed</b> to Kat, and is [...] "in this marriage for the long run." [...] He said that viewers may not want to see Kat and Alfie totally happy, describing them as [...] "like Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor [...] They can't be with each other and they can't be without each other." [...] He then promised that [...] "what happens to Alfie next is absolutely great!" [...] When asked what Alfie might do when he finds out who Kat is having the affair with, Richie said that he would get revenge, as [...] "everyone forgets Alfie's been in jail. Marriage has taken off his edge, but if he finds out his wife has been with one of his closest friends, well, any bloke would want to cut the other blokes knackers [...] off, wouldn't he?" [...] Richie added that the cast were [...] "thrilled" [...] with the storyline, saying that everyone involved is enjoying it. It was confirmed that viewers would not find out who Kat was having the affair with at this time, and that suspects would still be eliminated one at a time. Inside Soap then reported that a second suspect would be eliminated [...] "very soon". Michael was then eliminated in the episode broadcast on 14 September.|$|E
