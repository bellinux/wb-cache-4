5|$|Continuously <b>variable</b> <b>phase</b> control {{circuits}} {{are common in}} subwoofer amplifiers, and {{may be found in}} crossovers and as do-it-yourself electronics projects. Phase controls allow the listener to change the arrival time of the subwoofer sound waves relative to the same frequencies from the main speakers (i.e., at and around the crossover point to the subwoofer). A similar effect can be achieved with the delay control on many home theater receivers. The subwoofer phase control found on many subwoofer amplifiers is actually a polarity inversion switch. It allows users to reverse the polarity of the subwoofer relative to the audio signal it is being given. This type of control allows the subwoofer to either be in phase with the source signal, or 180 degrees out of phase.|$|E

40|$|An {{apparent}} {{paradox is}} resolved that concerns {{the existence of}} time operators which have been derived for the quantum harmonic oscillator. There is an apparent paradox because, although a time operator is canonically conjugate to the Hamiltonian, it has been asserted that no operator exists that is canonically conjugate to the Hamiltonian. In order to resolve the apparent paradox, we work in a representation where the phase operator is diagonal. The boundary condition on wave functions is such that they be periodic in the <b>phase</b> <b>variable,</b> which {{is related to the}} (continuous) eigenvalue of the time operator. Matrix elements of the commutator of the time operator with the Hamiltonian involve the <b>phase</b> <b>variable</b> itself in addition to periodic functions of the <b>phase</b> <b>variable.</b> The Hamiltonian is not hermitian when operating in space that includes the <b>phase</b> <b>variable</b> itself.
