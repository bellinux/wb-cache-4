40|$|ABSTRACT: Application of the {{three-dimensional}} digital image correlation technique (3 D DIC) to the accurate measurement of full-field surface {{profile of a}} 730 mm-diameter carbon fibre composite <b>satellite</b> <b>antenna</b> is investigated in this article.

40|$|We {{examine the}} design of a {{communication}} link involving the data transfer from a <b>small,</b> low-orbit <b>satellite</b> to a ground station, but through a geostationary satellite. The advantage of this approach is that a single ground station, which tracks only the geostationary satellite, may be shared by a multiplicity of <b>small</b> <b>satellites.</b> Our goal is to select certain <b>small</b> <b>satellite</b> parameters [...] signaling rate, <b>small</b> <b>satellite</b> <b>antenna</b> beamwidth, modulation scheme, and coding scheme [...] which maximize the data throughput in bits per day.
