40|$|International audienceWe {{present an}} {{automatic}} method {{to build a}} layered <b>vector</b> <b>graphics</b> <b>structure</b> ready for animation from a clean-line vector drawing of an organic, smooth shape. Inspiring from 3 D segmentation methods, we introduce a new metric computed on the medial axis of a region to identify and quantify the visual salience of a sub-region relative to the rest. This enables us to recursively separate each region into two closed sub-regions {{at the location of}} the most salient junction. The resulting structure, layered in depth, can be used to pose and animate the drawing using a regular 2 D skeleton...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a method for the {{detection}} of salient non-local <b>structures</b> in <b>vector</b> <b>graphics.</b> Non-local <b>structures</b> may consist of similar graphical objects—the constituents of a vector graphics—or of objects which are orderly arranged. They may be perceived immediately, but they are not explicitly represented in the internal description of a graphics. Information on such cognitive relevant structures may serve as additional indices to the graphics data base of a graphics retrieval system or may guide higher scene interpretation routines. Nonlocal structures emerge as a result of grouping processes of visual perception. The method used to detect non-local structures is the simulation of models of organizing phenomena of human visual perception. In particular, we use Treisman’s feature map model and Palmer’s transformational approach to human visual perception. ...|$|R
50|$|ODA {{defines a}} {{compound}} document format that can contain raw text, raster images and <b>vector</b> <b>graphics.</b> In the original release {{the difference between}} this standard {{and others like it}} is that the <b>graphics</b> <b>structures</b> were exclusively defined as CCITT raster image and Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM - ISO 8632). This was to limit the problem of having word processor and desktop publisher software be required to interpret all known graphics formats.|$|R

50|$|One of {{the first}} uses of <b>vector</b> <b>graphic</b> {{displays}} was the US SAGE air defense system. <b>Vector</b> <b>graphics</b> systems were retired from U.S. en route air traffic control in 1999, and are likely still in use in military and specialised systems. <b>Vector</b> <b>graphics</b> were also used on the TX-2 at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory by computer graphics pioneer Ivan Sutherland to run his program Sketchpad in 1963.|$|R
50|$|Common {{widely used}} format for <b>vector</b> <b>graphics</b> in Amiga are EPS and IFF DR2D. It {{originated}} {{from the fact}} that Amiga was the first platform on which ran Ghostscript natively, and also IFF DR2D was the original standard for <b>vector</b> <b>graphics</b> generated by Amiga ProVector and later adopted by other applications such as Art Expression and Professional Draw. Foremost used Amiga drawing and <b>vector</b> <b>graphics</b> utilities are Aegis Draw, ProDraw (Professional Draw) from Gold Disk Inc., DrawStudio, Art Expression, ProVector, and for some basic <b>vector</b> <b>graphics,</b> also the tools of Professional Page and PageStream are useful. The most modern <b>vector</b> <b>graphics</b> programs on Amiga are actually MindSpace 1.1, which is aimed mainly at design flowcharts, mindtables, UML and diagrams, and Steam Draw a 2D simple vector paint program available for MorphOS.|$|R

50|$|The {{first product}} was a memory card for the S-100 bus. A full {{microcomputer}} using the Z80 microprocessor, the Vector 1, {{was introduced in}} 1977. There were several <b>Vector</b> <b>Graphic</b> models produced. The Vector 1+ had a floppy disk drive. The <b>Vector</b> <b>Graphic</b> 3 had a fixed keyboard housed anchoring a combined screen terminal and CPU case. The <b>Vector</b> <b>Graphic</b> 4 was a transitional 8-bit and 16-bit hybrid model.|$|R

50|$|<b>Vector</b> <b>graphics</b> {{are ideal}} for simple or {{composite}} drawings {{that need to be}} device-independent, or do not need to achieve photo-realism. For example, the PostScript and PDF page description languages use a <b>vector</b> <b>graphics</b> model.|$|R
40|$|Flash, a {{proprietary}} format, {{is the most}} widely used <b>vector</b> <b>graphics</b> format on the Internet (Probets et al, 2001). Scalable <b>Vector</b> <b>Graphics</b> (SVG) is an XML namespace and a W 3 C recommended open standard for describing two-dimensional <b>vector</b> <b>graphics.</b> The current specification (SVG 1. 1) released in January 2003 supports interactivity, dynamic content and mobile devices. SVG is data driven, that is it consists of code (in plain text) to be rendered by an application, {{in the same way as}} HTML is rendered by a browser, this means that sophisticated <b>vector</b> <b>graphics</b> can be displayed using less bandwidth than equivalent raster based formats (JPEG, PNG or GIF), making it attractive for Internet use. The project undertook a literature review of <b>vector</b> <b>graphics</b> on the Internet, evaluated SVG technology and reviewed current trends in the use of SVG. A primary finding is the very limited extent that SVG is used for developing interactive games. Near identical interactive multimedia games were developed in both formats, the SV...|$|R
