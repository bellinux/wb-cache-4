Although the mechanism of injury is still poorly understood, mitochondrial toxicity has been proposed as a cause; linezolid is toxic to mitochondria, probably because of the similarity between mitochondrial and bacterial ribosomes. Lactic acidosis, a potentially life-threatening buildup of lactic acid in the body, may also occur due to mitochondrial toxicity. Because of these long-term effects, the manufacturer recommends weekly complete blood counts during linezolid therapy to monitor for possible bone marrow suppression, and recommends that treatment last no more than 28 days. A more extensive monitoring protocol for early detection of toxicity in seriously ill patients receiving linezolid has been developed and proposed {{by a team of}} researchers in Melbourne, Australia. The protocol includes twice-weekly blood tests and liver function tests; measurement of serum lactate levels, for early detection of lactic acidosis; a review of all medications taken by the patient, interrupting the use of those that may interact with linezolid; and periodic eye and neurological exams in patients set to receive linezolid for longer than four weeks.|$|E

25|$|Anti-microtubule {{agents are}} plant-derived {{chemicals}} that block cell division by preventing microtubule function. Microtubules {{are an important}} cellular structure composed of two proteins; α-tubulin and β-tubulin. They are hollow rod shaped structures that are required for cell division, among other cellular functions. Microtubules are dynamic structures, {{which means that they}} are permanently in a state of assembly and disassembly. <b>Vinca</b> <b>alkaloids</b> and taxanes are the two main groups of anti-microtubule agents, and although both of these groups of drugs cause microtubule dysfunction, their mechanisms of action are completely opposite. The <b>vinca</b> <b>alkaloids</b> prevent the formation of the microtubules, whereas the taxanes prevent the microtubule disassembly. By doing so, they prevent the cancer cells from completing mitosis. Following this, cell cycle arrest occurs, which induces programmed cell death (apoptosis).

The {{aim was to}} conduct a meta-analysis to compare the efficacy and safety of docetaxel and pemetrexed or docetaxel and <b>vinca</b> <b>alkaloid</b> for non-small-cell lung cancer. Methods: This meta-analysis of Phase III randomized controlled trials was performed after searching PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and the ISI Web of Knowledge for randomized controlled trials. Outcome analyses were overall survival, progression-free survival, and overall response rate with 95 % confidence intervals and major grade 3 / 4 toxicity. Results: Seven eligible trials involving 2, 080 patients were retrieved for analysis. Docetaxel enhanced progression-free survival and overall response rate compared with <b>vinca</b> <b>alkaloid</b> as first-line treatment (P 0. 05). With regard to the grade 3 / 4 toxicity, compared with pemetrexed, docetaxel led to higher neutropenia and febrile neutropenia (P 0. 05). Docetaxel led to a lower rate of anemia as first-line treatment (P< 0. 05). Moreover, docetaxel caused less grade 3 / 4 hematological and non-hematological toxicity compared with <b>vinca</b> <b>alkaloid.</b> Conclusion: Docetaxel leads to a better result than <b>vinca</b> <b>alkaloid</b> in effectiveness and safety on patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer as first-line therapy. Docetaxel also causes lower toxicity as second-line therapy compared with <b>vinca</b> <b>alkaloid.</b> However, the differences in efficacy and safety between docetaxel and pemetrexed are not obvious.
