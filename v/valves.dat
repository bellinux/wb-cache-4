5|$|To {{control the}} engine's output, the MEC {{operates}} five hydraulically actuated propellant <b>valves</b> on each engine; the oxidizer preburner oxidizer, fuel preburner oxidizer, main oxidizer, main fuel, and chamber coolant <b>valves.</b> In an emergency, the <b>valves</b> can be fully closed {{by using the}} engine's helium supply system as a backup actuation system.|$|E
5|$|When the {{atrioventricular}} <b>valves</b> (tricuspid and mitral) are open, during {{blood flow}} to the ventricles, the aortic and pulmonary <b>valves</b> are closed to prevent backflow into the ventricles. When the ventricular pressure is greater than the atrial pressure the tricuspid and mitral <b>valves</b> will shut. When the ventricles contract the pressure forces the aortic and pulmonary <b>valves</b> open. As the ventricles relax, the aortic and pulmonary <b>valves</b> will close in response to decreased pressure.|$|E
5|$|Adaptors are {{available}} to allow connection of DIN regulators to yoke cylinder <b>valves</b> (A-clamp or yoke adaptor), and to connect yoke regulators to DIN cylinder <b>valves.</b> (plug adaptors and block adaptors) Plug adaptors are rated for 232/240 bar, and can only be used with <b>valves</b> which are designed to accept them. Block adaptors are generally rated for 200 bar, {{and can be used}} with almost any 200 bar DIN valve.|$|E

5|$|Some {{cylinder}} valve models have axial spindles - {{in line with}} the cylinder axis, and are not handed. Standard side-spindle <b>valves</b> have the valve knob on the diver's right side when back-mounted. Side-spindle <b>valves</b> used with manifolds must be a handed pair - one with the knob to the right and the other with the knob to the left, but in all cases the valve is opened by turning the knob anticlockwise, and closed by turning it clockwise.

40|$|The {{method is}} used to {{manufacture}} a pump body with an inlet opening having an inlet <b>valve</b> (106) and an outlet opening having an outlet <b>valve</b> (108). The method involves structuring a first main surface of each of a first and second semiconductor disc (200). The structuring defines a <b>valve</b> leaflet structure (202) of the inlet <b>valve</b> and a <b>valve</b> seat structure (204) of the outlet <b>valve</b> in the first disc. It also defines a <b>valve</b> leaflet structure of the outlet <b>valve</b> and a <b>valve</b> seat structure of the inlet <b>valve</b> in the second disk. A <b>valve</b> leaflet recess structure and a <b>valve</b> opening recess structure are formed in predetermined relationship to the <b>valve</b> leaflet and <b>valve</b> seat structures in a second main surface {{of each of the}} disks. The first surfaces of the first and second disks are connected such that each <b>valve</b> leaflet structure has a predetermined relationship to a respective <b>valve</b> seat structure.

5|$|The {{speed of}} the HPOTP and HPFTP {{turbines}} depends on {{the position of the}} corresponding oxidizer and fuel preburner oxidizer <b>valves.</b> These <b>valves</b> are positioned by the engine controller, which uses them to throttle the flow of liquid oxygen to the preburners and, thus, control engine thrust. The oxidizer and fuel preburner oxidizer <b>valves</b> increase or decrease the liquid oxygen flow, thus increasing or decreasing preburner chamber pressure, HPOTP and HPFTP turbine speed, and liquid oxygen and gaseous hydrogen flow into the main combustion chamber, which increases or decreases engine thrust. The oxidizer and fuel preburner <b>valves</b> operate together to throttle the engine and maintain a constant 6.03:1 propellant mixture ratio.|$|E
5|$|The two <b>valves</b> of the bivalve shell {{are held}} {{together}} at the hinge by a ligament composed of two keratinised proteins, tensilium and resilium. In different groups of bivalves, the ligament may be internal or external in position. The main function of the ligament (as well as joining the <b>valves</b> together) is to passively cause the shell to open. The shell is actively closed using the adductor muscle or muscles which {{are attached to the}} inner surface of both <b>valves.</b> The position of the muscles is often clearly visible on the inside of empty <b>valves</b> as circular or oval muscle scars. Along the hinge line of the shell are, in most cases, a number of hinge teeth which prevent the <b>valves</b> from moving laterally relative to one another. The arrangement of these teeth is often important in identifying bivalves.|$|E
5|$|Venous {{insufficiency}} {{results when}} the vein dilates secondary to a vein wall disease or when normal {{functioning of the}} <b>valves,</b> which serve to keep blood flowing to the heart and to prevent reflux, become damaged and/or incompetent (the dilation of a vein will prevent <b>valves</b> to close properly).

5|$|Bivalve fossils {{are formed}} when the {{sediment}} {{in which the}} shells are buried hardens into rock. Often, the impression made by the <b>valves</b> remains as the fossil rather than the <b>valves.</b> During the Early Ordovician, a great increase in the diversity of bivalve species occurred, and the dysodont, heterodont, and taxodont dentitions evolved. By the early Silurian, the gills were becoming adapted for filter feeding, and during the Devonian and Carboniferous periods, siphons first appeared, which, with the newly developed muscular foot, allowed the animals to bury themselves deep in the sediment.|$|E
5|$|Both {{groups have}} a shell {{consisting}} of two <b>valves,</b> but {{the organization of the}} shell is quite different in the two groups. In brachiopods, the two <b>valves</b> are positioned on the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the body, while in bivalves, the <b>valves</b> are on the left and right sides of the body, and are, in most cases, mirror images of one other. Brachiopods have a lophophore, a coiled, rigid cartilaginous internal apparatus adapted for filter feeding, a feature shared with two other major groups of marine invertebrates, the bryozoans and the phoronids. Brachiopod shells are often made of calcium phosphate as well as calcium carbonate, whereas bivalve shells are composed entirely of calcium carbonate.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveWe {{sought to}} {{identify}} predictors of structural <b>valve</b> deterioration after pulmonary <b>valve</b> replacement {{in patients with}} tetralogy of Fallot. MethodsA retrospective review of 227 patients with tetralogy of Fallot who underwent stented bioprosthetic pulmonary <b>valve</b> replacement at Children’s Hospital Boston between 1994 and 2009 was performed. Patient and <b>valve</b> characteristics were assessed as potential predictors of structural <b>valve</b> deterioration by using univariate and multivariable analysis. Freedom from pulmonary <b>valve</b> reintervention and structural <b>valve</b> deterioration were determined by using Kaplan–Meier analysis. ResultsTwo hundred twenty-nine pulmonary <b>valve</b> replacement operations were performed, with no early mortalities. Freedom from reintervention and structural <b>valve</b> deterioration were 94 % (95 % confidence interval, 87 %– 100 %) and 74 % (95 % confidence interval, 63 %– 85 %) at 5 years, respectively, and median time to reintervention was 6. 4 years (range, 2 – 10. 1 years). Younger age and higher indexed <b>valve</b> internal diameter were predictors of reduced time to structural <b>valve</b> deterioration. Among patients aged less than 20 years {{at the time of}} pulmonary <b>valve</b> replacement, indexed <b>valve</b> internal diameter {{was a significant predictor of}} increased risk of structural <b>valve</b> deterioration. <b>Valve</b> manufacturer was not a significant predictor of structural <b>valve</b> deterioration. ConclusionsYounger age at the time of pulmonary <b>valve</b> replacement and <b>valve</b> oversizing in patients less than 20 years of age at the time of pulmonary <b>valve</b> replacement were significant predictors of structural <b>valve</b> deterioration and could potentially affect the timing of pulmonary <b>valve</b> replacement and the extent of <b>valve</b> oversizing in small children.

40|$|A {{fast-acting}} <b>valve</b> {{includes an}} annular <b>valve</b> seat that defines an annular <b>valve</b> orifice between {{the edges of}} the annular <b>valve</b> seat, an annular <b>valve</b> plug sized to cover the <b>valve</b> orifice when the <b>valve</b> is closed, and a valve-plug holder for moving the annular <b>valve</b> plug on and off the annular <b>valve</b> seat.

Rather than this distance being equal to the diameter of the orifice, as it is for a conventional circular orifice, the characteristic distance equals the distance between the inner and outer radii (for a circular annulus).
