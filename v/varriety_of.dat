40|$|Nowadays {{there is}} a great variety of sensors for {{temperature}} measurements. The Pt 100 is well {{known as one of the}} transducers with excellent precision and linearity. The only problem is the need of a high gain precision instrumentation amplifier which greatly increases the cost of the system. A large <b>varriety</b> <b>of</b> simple microcontrollers are developed to use with a lot of type of senzor which made the first translate of a nonelectric parameter in the electric form like pulse width or frequency or analogue voltage amplitude. After the signal was converted it can be transmited to an upper level to proces them...|$|E
