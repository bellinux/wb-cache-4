30|$|An {{important}} {{discovery was}} made by Ojeda and Iglesia. They reported that the activity of a gold catalyst supported over Al 2 O 3 was much {{higher than that of}} Pt, likely due {{to the size of the}} gold domains. In this work, they have also investigated the mechanism of reaction on the Au/Al 2 O 3 and Pt/Al 2 O 3 using kinetic isotope effect (KIE). This kinetic test consists in the use of different deuterium substituted substrates, such as HCOOD, DCOOH, and DCOOD, to distinguish between different reaction pathways. The exclusive formation of HD using both HCOOD and DCOOH indicates that the absorbed H atoms from –OH to –CH bond recombine together, and desorption is an irreversible step. KIE values (r H/r D) for HCOOD were 1.1 and 1.6 for Pt and Au, respectively, where for DCOOH, KIE values were 1.7 and 2.5, and finally, for DCOOD, KIE were 2.1 and 4.7. These <b>values</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>the</b> dissociation of O–H as the first step, almost thermodynamic in the case of Pt.
