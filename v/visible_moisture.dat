The survey “Prevetion of atopy among children in Trondheim ” includes both self-reported information about housing, and inspections and measurements from 205 homes.

Total 50, 200 children from 427 elementary schools were randomly selected according to residential areas (metropolitan, provincial, rural, and industrial areas) by the cluster sampling method. The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaires were used to measure the prevalence of wheeze. Among 31, 026 respondents, 25, 322 were analyzed.

It is designed {{to serve as a}} lower boundary in a mesoscale atmospheric model and is intended to be used to study the influence of the land surface on regional atmospheric circulations and climate: The land surface model contains one vegetation layer, a soil skin layer, and four subsurface soil layers. The shortwave and longwave radiation schemes are based on the two-stream theory. Turbulent transfer is treated in a very simple manner, by considering canopy-air and ground-air exchanges separately. Plant water flow is governed by differences in water potential between the soil and the leaves. The stomatal resistance formulation uses the effective leaf area index and the leaf water potential as key variables. it is shown that the resulting transpiration scheme implicitly accounts for the influence of <b>visible</b> radiation, soil <b>moisture,</b> atmospheric saturation deficit, and leaf temperature.

40|$|There is {{currently}} a lack of reference values for indoor air fungal concentrations {{to allow for the}} interpretation of measurement results in subtropical school settings. Analysis of the results of this work established that, in the majority of properly maintained subtropical school buildings, without any major affecting events such as floods or <b>visible</b> mould or <b>moisture</b> contamination, indoor culturable fungi levels were driven by outdoor concentration. The results also allowed us to benchmark the “baseline range” concentrations for total culturable fungi, Penicillium spp., Cladosporium spp. and Aspergillus spp. in such school settings. The measured concentration of total culturable fungi and three individual fungal genera were estimated using Bayesian hierarchical modelling. Pooling of these estimates provided a predictive distribution for concentrations at an unobserved school. The results indicated that “baseline” indoor concentration levels for indoor total fungi, Penicillium spp., Cladosporium spp. and Aspergillus spp. in such school settings were generally ≤ 1450, ≤ 680, ≤ 480 and ≤ 90 cfu/m 3, respectively, and elevated levels would indicate mould damage in building structures.

40|$|Graduation date: 1984 Presentation date: 1984 - 03 - 09 The {{relationships}} between spectral reflectance in the Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) bands and grass canopy variables were evaluated using in situ remote sensing techniques. Reflectance {{data were collected}} from experimental plots of annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) and tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) using a Barnes Modular Multiband Radiometer (MMR). The canopy variables used were canopy height, canopy cover, total wet biomass, total dry biomass, aboveground plant water, and leaf area index. Statistically significant relationships were found between the spectral bands and the canopy variables. Inverse relationships in the visible (TM 1, TM 2, TM 3) and middle infrared (TM 5, TM 7) regions were related to spectral absorption by plant pigments (<b>visible)</b> and <b>moisture</b> within plant tissue (middle infrared). Direct relationships in the near infrared (TM 4, MMR 5) were attributed to enhanced reflectance resulting from spectral scattering. Overall, no one spectral band was found to be superior in all situations, but TM 5 consistently showed the lowest correlations with the canopy variables. Data sets were collected during three annual ryegrass phenological stages: early stem extension (June), anthesis (July), and senescence (August). The most significant correlations between reflectance and the canopy variables were found for the June data. High levels of biomass in July and plant senescence in August adversely affected the spectral reflectance/canopy relationships. Data from the tall fescue plots were obtained {{from a wide range of}} total wet biomass levels (16. 5 - 1677. 9 g/m²). The asymptotic limits, or the biomass range for which the reflectance could be used to predict changes in the canopy variables, were studied. The reflection asymptotes were nearly twice as high for the near infrared (TM 4) as for the visible and middle infrared bands (TM 1, TM 2, TM 3, TM 7). The use of band ratios and normalized difference transformations did not consistantly increase correlations of spectral reflectance with the grass canopy variables. Logarithmic transformations of both the spectral bands and the canopy variables were successfully used to linearize the spectral reflectance/canopy regression functions. Redundancy was found among the absorption bands (TM 1, TM 2, TM 3, TM 7) and between the near infrared bands (TM 4, MMR 5). Principal component transformations were utilized to eliminate these spectral band redundancies. The seven spectral bands were reduced to two principal components, while maintaining nearly all of the variability found in the original bands...|$|R

Icing can lead to loss of engine power and, if not corrected, total shutdown of the engine. A carburetor heat control {{is used to}} supply heated air to the carburetor; this can prevent or cure icing, but also causes a reduction in engine power output because hot air is less dense, enriching the fuel-air mixture. The carburetor heat control is a simple plunger-type control mounted on the center console near the collective pitch control lever. Pulling the control up slides a gate valve near the carburetor that admits warm air from a scoop on the exhaust system. The R22 employs a carburetor air temperature gauge, marked to indicate temperatures conducive to icing. The Beta II version of the R22 also includes a [...] "carburetor heat assist" [...] which automatically applies carburetor heat when the collective is lowered below a certain point. When icing conditions are present, carburetor heat is required to prevent icing around the butterfly valve from the pressure drop at that point. As the carburetor air temperature (CAT) indicator does not read correctly below 18 in of intake manifold air pressure, icing conditions require applying full carburetor heat below 18 in of manifold pressure. A placard indicating this requirement is located on the CAT indicator and in the Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH).|$|R
40|$|With pork {{representing}} {{more than}} 70 % of meat consumption in Vietnam pig production is growing fast and {{plays an important}} role in the livestock production. Especially smallholder farms contribute substantial to the pork supply (approximately 80 %) because of consumer preferences, subsistence and commercial purposes. Despite of this considerable market share the overwhelming majority of smallholder pig farms lack of technologies, biosecurity and control measures in terms of diseases, hygiene and environment conditions. As being part of a wider research on improving smallholder pig value chains in Vietnam a longitudinal survey was conducted with the objectives to assess biosecurity practices and related farm management which will be used to identify suitable options for improved disease control. The survey was carried between March and December 2014 in the Hung Yen and Nghe An provinces of Vietnam. Thirty farms were selected randomly in each provinces as a sub-sample from a larger sampling frame (N= 416) and visited in fortnightly intervals. On farm data by using a checklist and observations included information on farm management, biosecurity measures, working and feed storage conditions as well as diseases events. In general diseases control measures were found insufficient. The majority of farmers allowed visitors to access the farm without any restrictions (69. 7 %) throughout the entire observation period. Disinfection mattresses were installed only in 42. 7 % of visits, and even applied, often not maintained. The use of protective clothes and boots by workers was the exception (81. 2 %). Pre-weaning piglets were usually not provided with litter (88. 9 %) and/or heat sources (74. 1 %), the latter being a particular constraint during the cold season.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} single-column model (SCM) {{simulations of}} a tropical squall-line case observed during the Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere Response Experiment of the Tropical Ocean/Global Atmosphere Programme. This case-study {{was part of}} an international model intercomparison project organized by Working Group 4 ‘Precipitating Convective Cloud Systems’ of the GEWEX (Global Energy and Water-cycle Experiment) Cloud System Study. Eight SCM groups using different deep-convection parametrizations participated in this project. The SCMs were forced by temperature and moisture tendencies that had been computed from a reference cloud-resolving model (CRM) simulation using open boundary conditions. The comparison of the SCM results with the reference CRM simulation provided insight into the ability of current convection and cloud schemes to represent organized convection. The CRM results enabled a detailed evaluation of the SCMs in terms of the thermodynamic structure and the convective mass flux of the system, the latter being closely related to the surface convective precipitation. It is shown that the SCMs could reproduce reasonably well the time evolution of the surface convective and stratiform precipitation, the convective mass flux, and the thermodynamic structure of the squall-line system. The thermodynamic structure simulated by the SCMs depended on how the models partitioned the precipitation between convective and stratiform. However, structural differences persisted in the thermodynamic profiles simulated by the SCMs and the CRM. These differences could be attributed {{to the fact that the}} total mass flux used to compute the SCM forcing differed from the convective mass flux. The SCMs could not adequately represent these organized mesoscale circulations and the microphysicallradiative forcing associated with the stratiform region. This issue is generally known as the ‘scale-interaction’ problem that can only be properly addressed in fully three-dimensional simulations. Sensitivity simulations run by several groups showed that the time evolution of the surface convective precipitation was considerably smoothed when the convective closure was based on convective available potential energy instead of moisture convergence. Finally, additional SCM simulations without using a convection parametrization indicated that the impact of a convection parametrization in forced SCM runs was more <b>visible</b> in the <b>moisture</b> profiles than in the temperature profiles because convective transport was particularly important in the moisture budget...|$|R
40|$|Magister Scientiae Dentium - MSc(Dent) Resin filled dental {{composite}} materials {{has been introduced}} into dental practice since mid- 1960 s as an aesthetic restorative material for anterior teeth (Bowen, 1962 cited in Peutzfeldt, 1997). Since then, they have undergone several developments {{in order to enhance}} the longevity and performance of these materials. Resin filled dental composites consist of three main components namely, organic resin matrix which consists of a monomer, an initiator system and a stabilizer system, inorganic filler such as quartz, silica, etc. and coupling agent such as organo-silane coupling agent that chemically bonds the inorganic fillers to the organic resin matrix (Phillips, 1973). The properties and the performance of the resin filled dental composites are basically dependent upon the components of the materials. Some properties are related to the resin matrix, whereas others are related to the inorganic fillers and coupling agent. Furthermore, properties such as polymerization shrinkage and water sorption are dependent on both the inorganic fillers and the organic resin matrix (Asmussen, 1975; Hashinger and Fairhust, 1984; Munksgaard et al., 1987). Aim and objectives: The aim and the objectives {{of this study was to}} compare the water sorption and solubility of four bulk-fill dental resin {{composite materials}} namely, two conventional viscosity bulk-fill (Surefil bulk fill composite and Tetric N Ceram Bulk Fill) and two low viscosity bulk-fill flowable dental composite materials (Filtek Bulk Fill flowable restorative and Surefil SDR Flow). Materials and methods: Four types of bulk-fill composite restorative materials (2 bulk-fill conventional viscosity (Surefil bulk fill composite and Tetric N Ceram Bulk Fill) and 2 bulk-fill flowable low viscosity (Filtek Bulk Fill flowable restorative and Surefil SDR Flow) were used to analyse the water sorption and solubility for each resin composite type. Thirty specimens for each type of material were prepared, giving the total number of specimens to be 120 (n= 120). To standardize this study Vita shade A 2 was used for all the material types. All specimens were prepared in a Teflon mould with internal diameter of 15 ± 1 mm and thickness of 1 ± 0. 1 mm in accordance with ISO 4049. The light curing unit used for all specimens was Elipar™ S 10, (3 M ESPE, Germany) at an output of 1200 mW/cm 2 and used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Prior to curing, the intensity of the light was checked using Cure Rite visible curing light meter (Caulk, USA) to ensure light output consistency between specimens and was found to be 1200 mW/cm 2. All the specimens were first removed from the Teflon mould as prepared and described previously and placed in an oven at 37 ºC until their weights were constant and these weights were recorded as m 1 by using an analytic balance (OHAUS, TS 400 D, USA). Ten specimens of each type of resin filled composite were then immersed individually in glass containers filled with 10 ml distilled water and placed in the oven at 37 ± 1 ºC for 24 hours, 7 days, 14 days respectively. The specimens were removed; surface water was blotted with tissue paper until free from <b>visible</b> <b>moisture</b> and weighed using the analytic balance (OHAUS, TS 400 D, USA). The resultant weights were recorded as m 2. The specimens were then placed in a desiccator containing silica gel (Associated Chemical Enterprises, ZA) and freshly dried for two hours in an oven at 58 ºC and then weighted to obtain m 3. According to Oysaed and Ruyter formula (Oysaed and Ruyter, 1986), the water sorption and solubility was calculated using the following equation: i. Water sorption (SP) = m 2 -m 3 / v., ii. Water solubility (SI) = m 1 -m 3 / v - where v is the volume of the specimen. For monomer leakage high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to identify monomers. The water that contained stored specimens was transferred to a refrigerator immediately after the specimens were removed until HPLC analysis was carried out to determine the amount of monomers that leached out of the cured composite specimens. Results: A significant difference between the materials (p 0. 05 two way ANOVA test). The amounts of eluted monomers from bulk-fill conventional viscosity materials (Surefil bulk fill and Tetric N Ceram Bulk Fill) were higher than bulk-fill flowable materials (Surefil SDR Flow and Filtek Bulk Fill flowable restorative). Of all the monomers tested UDMA eluted more than Bis-GMA and TEGDMA. Overall UDMA monomer eluted the most, followed by Bis-GMA and the TEGDMA. Conclusion: Within the limitation of this study, the results of this study did not support the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference in the water sorption. The bulk-fill low viscosity flowables showed lower water sorption than the conventional viscosity bulk-fills. Surefil SDR Flow was significantly lower than the other materials followed by Filtek Bulk Fill flowable restorative and Tetric N-Ceram Bulk Fill and the highest overall means were recorded for Surefil bulk fill. For water solubility the overall means for the flowables of Filtek and SDR were smaller than Surefil and Tetric N-Ceram. For monomer elution three monomers were detected of which UDMA monomer eluted the most, followed by Bis-GMA and the TEGDMA. With regards to the elution of monomers, it was found that 3 monomers named UDMA eluted more than Bis-GMA and TEGDMA...|$|E

The total amount of irrigation water during vegetation were as follows: the variant with optimal levels of irrigation (O) had 131 [*]mm in 2009 and 123 [*]mm in 2011; the variant with reduced levels of irrigation (S) : 58 [*]mm in 2009 and 63 [*]mm in 2011 Three variants were in both (O and S) conditions: A – no application of 24 -epibrassinolide, B – 1 × 24 -epibrassinolide application immediately after planting, and C – application of 24 -epibrassinolide 2 x (immediately after planting and then after 14 days after 1 st application). Concentration of 24 -epibrassinolide was 10 − 6. Following parameters of head lettuce were set after harvesting (10. – 12. 10. 2009 and 14. – 15. 10. 2011) : weight of single heads, marketable heads, marketable yield (in pcs/ha and t/ha) and ascorbic acid and nitrate contents. Influence of 24 -epibrassinolide on single lettuce head weight was not significant, decrease of head weight was evident after 24 -epibrassinolide application in some variants. Significant increase of marketable heads number and their percentages were noted after 24 -epibrassinolide application in optimal moisture conditions – in variant B of 12   261 heads/ha (11. 1 [*]%) and in variant C of 16   279 heads/ha (14. 7 [*]%) compared with non treated variant A.

40|$|Metrics of culturable {{airborne}} microorganisms {{for either}} total organisms or suspected harmful subgroups have generally not {{been associated with}} symptoms among building occupants. However, the <b>visible</b> presence of <b>moisture</b> damage or mold in residences and other buildings has consistently been associated with respiratory symptoms and other health effects. This relationship is presumably caused by adverse but uncharacterized exposures to moisture-related microbiological growth. In order to assess this hypothesis, we studied relationships in U. S. office buildings between the prevalence of respiratory and irritant symptoms, the concentrations of airborne microorganisms that require moist surfaces on which to grow, {{and the presence of}} visible water damage. For these analyses we used data on buildings, indoor environments, and occupants collected from a representative sample of 100 U. S. office buildings in the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency's Building Assessment Survey and Evaluation (EPA BASE) study. We created 19 alternate metrics, using scales ranging from 3 - 10 units, that summarized the concentrations of airborne moisture-indicating microorganisms (AMIMOs) as indicators of moisture in buildings. Two were constructed to resemble a metric previously reported to be associated with lung function changes in building occupants; the others were based on another metric from the same group of Finnish researchers, concentration cutpoints from other studies, and professional judgment. We assessed three types of associations: between AMIMO metrics and symptoms in office workers, between evidence of water damage and symptoms, and between water damage and AMIMO metrics. We estimated (as odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % confidence intervals) the unadjusted and adjusted associations between the 19 metrics and two types of weekly, work-related symptoms [...] lower respiratory and mucous membrane [...] using logistic regression models. Analyses used the original AMIMO metrics and were repeated with simplified dichotomized metrics. The multivariate models adjusted for other potential confounding variables associated with respondents, occupied spaces, buildings, or ventilation systems. Models excluded covariates for moisture-related risks hypothesized to increase AMIMO levels. We also estimated the association of water damage (using variables for specific locations in the study space or building, or summary variables) with the two symptom outcomes. Finally, using selected AMIMO metrics as outcomes, we constructed logistic regression models with observations at the building level to estimate unadjusted and adjusted associations of evident water damage with AMIMO metrics. All original AMIMO metrics showed little overall pattern of unadjusted or adjusted association with either symptom outcome. The 3 -category metric resembling that previously used by others, which of all constructed metrics had the largest number of buildings in its top category, was not associated with symptoms in these buildings. However, most metrics with few buildings in their highest category showed increased risk for both symptoms in that category, especially metrics using cutpoints of > 100 but < 500 colony-forming units (CFU) /m{sup 3 } for concentration of total culturable fungi. With AMIMO metrics dichotomized to compare the highest category with all lower categories combined, four metrics had unadjusted ORs between 1. 4 and 1. 6 for both symptom outcomes. The same four metrics had adjusted ORs of 1. 7 - 2. 1 for both symptom outcomes. In models of water damage and symptoms, several specific locations of past water damage had significant associations with outcomes, with ORs ranging from 1. 4 - 1. 6. In bivariate models of water damage and selected AMIMO metrics, a number of specific types of water damage and several summary variables for water damage were very strongly associated with AMIMO metrics (significant ORs ranging above 15). Multivariate modeling with the dichotomous AMIMO metrics was not possible due to limited numbers of observations...|$|R
