50|$|SRiMech - Many robots are {{incapable}} of running inverted, due to their shape, weaponry, or both. A SRiMech (self-righting mechanism) is an Active Design element that returns an inverted robot to mobility in the upright state. The SRiMech is typically an electric or pneumatic arm or extension on the upper surface of the robot which pushes against the arena floor to roll or flip the robot upright. Most flippers, some lifters, and even some carefully-designed axes can double as SRiMechs. Even a vertical spinning weapon {{may be used as}} a crude self-righting device. Team Nightmare's lightweight <b>vertical</b> <b>spinner</b> Backlash was designed such that when flipped it would hit the ground with the spinning disc and kick back upright. The first successful unaided use of a SRiMech in competition was at the 1997 U.S. Robot Wars when the immobilized Vlad the Impaler used a dedicated pneumatic device to pop back upright in a match against Biohazard.|$|E
50|$|Spinner - Spinners are {{generally}} larger and heavier than saw blades, and spin {{at a lower}} RPM. Rather than cutting through the opponent, spinners use a heavy bar, studded disc, or toothed cylinder (drum/eggbeater) to strike the opponent with the kinetic energy stored in the rotating mass. The mass may spin on either a horizontal or vertical axis, although <b>vertical</b> <b>spinners</b> may have maneuverability problems due to the gyroscopic action of the weapon. The destructive potential of a well-designed spinning weapon requires robust arena containment to prevent shrapnel being thrown into the audience. Three-time BattleBots middleweight champion Hazard was a horizontal bar spinner, while Robot Wars Series 3 runner-up Hypno-Disc was a flywheel spinner.|$|R
