40|$|The Paradox No. 3 mine, Atolia, California, was mapped {{and thin}} {{sections}} of the vein minerals and wall rock were examined. Veins containing quartz, scheelite and carbonate occur along faults and fractures in Atolia quartz monzonite (Upper Jurassic ?), which is an orthoclase-biotite tonalite in the mine area. The mineralization occurs along three principle veins, named for convenience the main vein, north vein and west vein. Both the main and north veins occupy steeply dipping, northwest trending faults and fractures which dip 50 to 60 degrees southward from the surface and upper levels, but the main vein changes dip to the north near the 100 level, and the north vein changes dip to the north near the 200 level. Upward branching and changes in dip of the veins are common and {{are believed to be}} the result of nearly equal pressures on the different fracture surfaces at the time of mineralization. The west vein occupies a west to northwest trending thrust fault, which dips northward at 30 to 45 degrees, and an east trending strike-slip fault. The forces causing the faulting and fracturing are believed to be local vertical forces followed by regional compression oriented north to northeast. Localization of ore seems to occur at the junction of the thrust and strike-slip faults and at and above changes in dip of the north and main veins. The <b>vein</b> <b>matter</b> consists of coarse grained scheelite, quartz, and calcite, deposited in that order as open space filling in the fractures. Crustification, comb textures and small filled cavities are common. Wall rock alteration in the quartz monzonite resulted in pervasive alteration of biotite to chlorite and, feldspar to white mica, carbonate and clays. Adjacent to the veins the wall rock consists of illite, calcite, quartz and minor clays, chlorite, pyrite and locally albite. The deformation and mineralization are believed to have occurred during Miocene times at shallow depths. The ore forming fluids were probably hot carbonated aqueous solutions carrying minor quantities of sulphur and tungsten and possibly silica and potash. Suggested sites for exploration for ore are on the north vein at the 100 and 150 levels end the main vein at the east end of the 100 level...|$|E

The injury of the portal <b>vein</b> <b>matters</b> because of the difficulty on the diagnosis and the approach surgery. Objective: To set the standard on the transverse section of the pancreas looking for a safer surgical access to repair the portal vein injuries. Methods: A quantitative analysis was performed to characterize the anatomical relationship between the portal vein and their tributaries relating them to the pancreas. On these corpses, the measurements of a anatomical triangle were studied. It base was the upper limit of the superior mesenteric vein and the initial portion of the portal vein; the apex, a point located on the upper limit of the confluence of the splenic vein and superior mesenteric vein, situated at the middle line of the superior mesenteric vein. Results: The portal vein is formed 3. 24 cm from the internal border of the duodenal arc at a distance of 1. 61 cm and 1. 07 from the inferior and superior pancreas borders, respectively. Conclusion: The present study allow us to conclude that, to have access to the origin of the portal vein, in case of trauma of this vessel, one should proceed a transverse section of the neck of the pancreas next to the superior mesenteric vein, because its confluence with splenic vein occur, on average, 1. 07 cm and 1. 61 cm from the superior and inferior border of the gland, respectively...|$|R

40|$|While BOLD {{contrast}} reflects haemodynamic {{changes within}} capillaries serving neural tissue, {{it also has}} a venous component. Studies that have determined the relation of large blood vessels to the activation map indicate that veins are the source of the largest response, and the most delayed in time. It would be informative if the location of these large veins could be extracted from the properties of the functional responses, since vessels are not visible in BOLD contrast images. The present study describes a method for investigating whether measures taken from the functional response can reliably predict vein location, or at least be useful in down-weighting the venous contribution to the activation response, and illustrates this method using data from one subject. We combined fMRI at 3 Tesla with high-resolution anatomical imaging and MR venography to test whether the intrinsic properties of activation time courses corresponded to tissue type. Measures were taken from a gamma fit to the functional response. Mean magnitude showed a significant effect of tissue type (P <b>veins</b> ≈ grey <b>matter</b> > white matter. Mean delays displayed the same ranking across tissue types (P grey matter. However, measures for all tissue types were distributed across an overlapping range. A logistic regression model correctly discriminated 72 % of the <b>veins</b> from grey <b>matter</b> in the absence of independent information of macroscopic vessels (ROC= 0. 72). Whilst tissue classification was not perfect for this subject, weighting the T contrast by the predicted probabilities materially reduced the venous component to the activation map...|$|R
40|$|The orogenic wedge {{evolution}} {{is a topic}} of great importance in tectonic studies. Acquisition of thermo-baric data, widely used in basin analysis, is now a strong support to unravel times and modes of burial/exhumation history in mountain belts. A multidisciplinary approach for thermo-baric data acquisition is here proposed along the Calabria-Lucanian border (Southern Appennines, Italy), a crucial area to understand the geodynamics of western-central Mediterranean. Different stratigraphic, structural and geodynamics models have been proposed for this area though time. Recently Iannace et al. (2005) suggested a new structuralstratigraphic synthesis, grouping the outcropping Meso-Cenozoic succession into two tectonic units: the Lungro-Verbicaro Unit (LVU) and the tectonically underlying Pollino-Ciagola Unit (PCU). These units comprise respectively HP-LT and nonmetamorphic rocks of the paleo-African continental marging. They are overlain by ophiolite bearing units. Our study is focussed on the thermo-baric characterization of the different lithological units belonging to the LVU and PCU. Preliminary available data come from fluid inclusion micro-thermometry (on syn-tectonic quartz/calcite <b>veins),</b> organic <b>matter</b> maturity, clay mineralogy and apatite fission tracks analysis.

Introdução: No trauma abdominal, o comprometimento dos grandes vasos constitui uma situação de grande complexidade com altos índices de complicações e mortalidade. Nestes pacientes, a lesão da veia porta-hepática tem interesse em razão da dificuldade no diagnóstico e na abordagem cirúrgica. Objetivo: Padronizar o plano de transecção do pâncreas visando o acesso cirúrgico mais seguro para os reparos das lesões da veia porta-hepática. Métodos: Procedeu-se à uma análise quantitativa para caracterizar a relação anatômica da veia porta-hepática e suas tributárias relacionando-as com o pâncreas. Nestes cadáveres, estudou-se as medidas de um triângulo anatômico que tem como base o limite superior da veia mesentérica superior e porção inicial da veia porta; como ápice, um ponto localizado no limite superior da confluência das veias esplênica e mesentérica superior, situado na linha média da veia mesentérica superior. Resultados: A veia porta-hepática é formada a 3. 24 cm da borda interna do arco duodenal numa localização que dista 1. 61 cm e 1. 07 das bordas inferior e superior do pâncreas, respectivamente.

Gracie and Auney send mixed signals by choosing “high heels over moccasins, blue eyes over black eyes” (58). They alter their looks to seem less Cherokee but claim to be Cherokee. The women are also mixed bloods (Scotch and Cherokee). Because of the mixed signals from her relatives, Lucie struggles with the notion of whether she is Cherokee or not because she knows she too is of mixed blood and she has conflicting identities. To complicate things even further, she hears Reverend Tom Cottonmouth say, “if youse got Cherokee blood a-running through your <b>veins,</b> no <b>matter</b> how distant, no matter how pre-e-e posterous, no matter how recent, the Cherokee loves y’all”(57).

And wait Indian brothers and sisters, ifn ya do that ‘fore midnight tonight, we’ll send ya a genuine rock from the Cherokee nation”(57). Reverend Cottonmouth’s claim is so ridiculous that it makes being Cherokee seem accessible for everyone. It’s like the ultimate slap on the face for true Cherokee who suffered through the Indian Removal. This leaves Lucie confused because there is nothing she can relate to.|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{formation}} of arachidonic acid-derived prostanoids was investi-gated in saphenous veins of varicosed and nonvaricosed patients, all undergoing saphenectomy respectively for varicosis or {{in preparation for}} coronary bypass operation. Venous production of prostacyclin (PGI 2), thromboxane A 2 (TXA 2) and prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) was assessed by bioassay and/or radioimmunologic assays as appropriate. Fragments of saphenous veins from varicosed patients produced significantly less PGI 2 and more TXA 2 and PGE 2 than those from the control patients. Addition of arachidonic acid to incubation mixtures dose de-pendently increased release of these prostanoids, but the levels of PGI 2 pro-duced were consistently lower in veins from varicosed patients. No {{differences were found in}} varicosed patients between various segments of the same <b>vein,</b> no <b>matter</b> whether macroscopically affected or unaffected. These results demon-strate that the cyclooxygenase pathway in the venous wall of subjects with vari-cosis is shifted toward lesser {{formation of}} PGI 2 and higher production of proaggregatory and proinflammatory prostanoids such as PGE 2 and TXA 2.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to measure the {{regional}} change of magnetic susceptibility in human brain upon inhalation of 100 % oxygen by MRI quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM). Fourteen healthy volunteers were scanned in a 3 [*]T MR scanner with a 3 D multi-gradient-echo sequence while breathing medical air (normoxia) and pure oxygen (hyperoxia). QSM images and R 2 * maps were calculated. Mean susceptibility differences versus white matter were measured in regions of interest covering <b>veins,</b> gray <b>matter</b> (GM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) under both conditions. Hyperoxia resulted in a strong susceptibility decrease in large veins (- 154. 4 [*]±[*] 65. 9 [*]ppb, p[*]<[*] 10 (- 6)), in a smaller reduction in GM (- 1. 3 [*]±[*] 1 [*]ppb, p[*]<[*] 0. 001), and in a susceptibility increase in ventricular CSF (3. 8 [*]±[*] 1. 8 [*]ppb, p[*]<[*] 10 (- 5)). The susceptibility decrease in veins implied an increase of venous oxygen saturation (SvO 2) by 10. 1 [*]±[*] 4. 0 %. Compared with QSM, R 2 * was more seriously affected by long-distance effects not related to local tissue oxygenation and increased in cerebral frontal regions (3 [*]±[*] 2 [*]s(- 1), p[*]<[*] 0. 0004) due to paramagnetic molecular oxygen in cavities. The results highlight the potential of QSM to yield region-specific quantitative oxygenation information, and, thus, for applications such as oxygen-therapy monitoring or identification of hypoxic tumor tissue during radiotherapy planning.

40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is {{the most}} common neurological disease in young Canadians, yet its etiology remains obscure. Two possibly related findings in MS are brain iron deposition and the presence of small <b>veins</b> in white <b>matter</b> lesions. This thesis concerns the development and application of 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging tools to image iron and veins in early multiple sclerosis. To facilitate measurements of iron concentration as well as production of cerebral venograms, we first optimized multi-echo susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI), using numerical simulations and input from physicians. We validated measurements of R 2 *, an MRI parameter that scales linearly with iron concentration. Subsequently, we proposed quantification of the caliber of the internal jugular veins (IJVs) from magnetic resonance venograms. IJVs are implicated in the chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency model of MS, an increasingly disputed theory that attributes iron deposition in MS to venous abnormalities. We report that the coefficient of variation of measurements of average cross-sectional area of the IJVs is on the order of 7...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Hypernatremia {{resulting}} in neurologic symptoms ranging from lethargy to coma, and with un-derlying lesions of cerebral hemorrhage and thrombosis, {{has been reported}} in human beings. Herein we report two cases of cerebral infarction with venous thrombosis in cynomolgus monkeys. Both animals were severely hypernatremic because of water deprivation, with serum sodium levels of 185 and 193 meq/liter, respectively. At necropsy, there were bilateral multiple hemorrhagic and malacic areas visible {{on the surface of the}} cerebrum and extending into the parenchyma, primarily involving the occipital lobes. These lesions were interpreted microscopically as infarcts because, in addition to hemorrhage and necrosis, multiple thrombi were present in small and medium-sized <b>veins</b> of gray <b>matter</b> and meninges. The pathogenesis of hypernatremia-induced cerebral lesions is believed to involve cellular dehydration that caused shrinkage of the brain. Because the vasculature of the brain is tightly adherent to the skull, this shrinkage results in tearing of blood vessels, with consequent hemorrhage and thrombosis.

Veins were segregated into pre kinematic, pre-syn kinematic and post kinematic groups based on their relationship to host rock fabrics. Crush-leach halogen data indicates the presence of two main fluid types, one with Cl/Br &# 60; seawater, indicative of a fluid derived from residual evaporated seawater which dominate the pre and pre-syn kinematic samples, and one with Cl/Br &# 62; seawater, characteristic of a fluid containing a component derived from dissolved evaporites which dominated the post-kinematic vein generation. Halogen data suggests fluids were ultimately derived from strong evaporation of seawater beyond the carnalite saturation point. Cation data suggests significant water-rock interaction consistent with hydrothermal alteration assemblages. delta Cl- 37 of fluid leachate is close to 0 for all samples, suggesting an ultimate seawater source of chlorine. delta O- 18 (fluid) is variable between similar to - 3 and + 11, probably reflecting different amounts of water-rock equilibration and different residence times.

60|$|At {{the mouth}} of the Cap Rouge river there is a high point, now called Redclyffe. On this Cartier {{constructed}} a second fort, which commanded the fortification and the ships below. A little spring supplied fresh water, and the natural situation afforded a protection against attack by water or by land. While the French laboured in building the stockades and in hauling provisions and equipments from the ships to the forts, they made other discoveries that impressed them more than the forest wealth of this new land. Close beside the upper fort they found in the soil a good store of stones which they 'esteemed to be diamonds.' At the foot of the slope along the St Lawrence lay iron deposits, and the sand of the shore needed only, Cartier said, to be put into the furnace to get the iron from it. At the water's edge they found 'certain leaves of fine gold as thick as a man's nail,' and in the slabs of black slate-stone which ribbed the open glades of the wood there were <b>veins</b> of mineral <b>matter</b> which shone like gold and silver. Cartier's mineral discoveries have unfortunately not resulted in anything. We know now that his diamonds, still to be seen about Cap Rouge, are rock crystals. The gold which he later on showed to Roberval, and which was tested, proved genuine enough, but the quantity of such deposits in the region has proved insignificant. It is very likely that Cartier would make the most of his mineral discoveries as the readiest means of exciting his master's interest.|$|R

This will include the current view {{on the influence of}} physiological parameters (CBF, CBV and CMRO 2) on the BOLD signal, the link to neuronal activation and its temporal profile. Furthermore, this chapter describes relevant vascular and anatomical features of the brain with an emphasis on the venous side and how these anatomical and physiological properties influence the MR signal. We describe how a fast, high resolution SWI sequence can be used to perform BOLD-based fMRI (= functional SWI) in order {{to learn more about the}} contributions of different tissue compartments (gray <b>matter,</b> <b>veins)</b> to the fMRI signal. As the SWI sequence is able to resolve small venous structures the magnitude and phase behavior of veins can be visualized, quantified and veins can be removed from the functional data based on this information. We then describe the phase changes in the (f) MR signal from magnetic field changes in and around vessels quantitatively and use it to detect veins in a standard (i. e. lower spatial resolution) fMRI setup. This is being used in the statistical modeling of complex-valued voxel fMRI measurements in terms of magnitude and phase along with detection of statistically significant changes. We present the results of applying the complex constant phase model to reduce fMRI activation in voxels that have task related phase changes...|$|R
