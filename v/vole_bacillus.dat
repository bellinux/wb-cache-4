40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for counting viable units of Mycobacterium microti (<b>vole</b> <b>bacillus)</b> suspensions after 21 days of culture on an oleic-albumin agar medium containing 5 % defibrinated horse blood, {{with a tight}} seal to maintain humidity. This method is important because <b>vole</b> <b>bacillus</b> is an alternative to BCG {{in the prevention of}} tuberculosis...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} 15 -year {{results of a}} {{controlled}} clinical trial of BCG and <b>vole</b> <b>bacillus</b> vaccines {{in the prevention of}} TB. Among 54 239 participants, 583 cases of TB developed, of which 70 % were of pulmonary TB and 15 % of tuberculous pleural effusion without evidence of pulmonary TB. The annual incidence (per 1 000) of TB was 0. 28 among the 13 598 BCG-vaccinated participants and 1. 28 among the tuberculin-negative unvaccinated participants admitted concurrently (a 78 % reduction); for <b>vole</b> <b>bacillus</b> vaccine (5 817 participants) the figures were 0. 29 and 1. 50 (an 81 % reduction). Protection extended to all forms of TB (in particular, 10 cases of tuberculous meningitis or miliary pulmonary TB developed in unvaccinated, and none in vaccinated, participants) and was similar in the two sexes. It decreased gradually during the period but was still substantial (59 % for BCG vaccine and 73 % for <b>vole</b> <b>bacillus</b> vaccine) 10 - 15 years after vaccination; no definite conclusion can yet be reached on the level of protection after 15 years. The annual incidence of TB in those with strong positive reactions to tuberculin on entry was particularly high (3. 75) in the first 2. 5 years, reflecting active infections acquired before entry; those with weaker positive reactions on entry had a lower incidence throughout than the tuberculin-negative unvaccinated group, indicating that a degree of naturally acquired immunity (though less than that conferred by vaccination) was associated with the low-grade tuberculin sensitivity. The incidence of every form of TB decreased steeply during the 15 years, except for genito-urinary TB of which there were 3, 5, and 14 cases in successive 5 -year periods, principally among initially tuberculin-positive participants. This report also presents the findings with respect to nontuberculous diseases, discusses the place of <b>vole</b> <b>bacillus</b> vaccination, and describes a method for assessing the applicability of mass BCG vaccination in a given epidemiological situation...|$|E
40|$|African mine workers {{exposed to}} {{siliceous}} {{dust in the}} metalliferous mines of Northern Rhodesia were tuberculin tested; of 17, 697 tested, 13, 667 were tuberculin positive and 4, 030 negative. The negative reactors were divided at random into two approximately equal groups and 1, 984 were vaccinated with <b>vole</b> <b>bacillus</b> vaccine and 2, 046 were left unvaccinated. These two groups were subsequently followed up and their original radiological categories {{at the time of}} tuberculin testing and vaccination were compared with their radiological categories after varying periods of further dust exposure. The object of the investigation was to ascertain whether or not vaccination with <b>vole</b> <b>bacillus</b> vaccine introduced an acclerating factor in the rate of radiological change in pneumoconiosis. The results of the investigation showed that radiological changes in the two groups were minimal and that there was virtually no difference between them. No accelerated changes were recorded in the negative vaccinated group. This is regarded as evidence that anti-tuberculosis vaccine does not introduce an accelerating factor in pneumoconiosis...|$|E
40|$|Besides {{using the}} {{attenuated}} human or bovine tubercle bacilli to produce immunity against tuberculosis, some {{attempts have been}} made, using mycobacteria isolated from various animal species and also some saprophytic mycobacteria. Thus {{the use of the}} <b>vole</b> <b>bacillus,</b> occurring naturally in the voles (Wells 1937), the acid-fast organisms occurring in the turtle (Friedmann 1903, 1904), the use of Mycobac-terium marinum occurring in the fish and garter snakes (Aronson 1929) and the use of Mycobacterium phlei (Bloch and Segal 1955) have been reported in literature. Very recently, the use of Mycobacterium ulcerans and Mycobacterium balnei for developing immunity against mycobacterium infections in mice has been reported by Fenner (Fenner 1957). The authors have also attempted to produce immunity in mice against tuberculosis using a naturally occurring saprophytic mycobacteria, Mycobacterium lacticola, isolated from the intestines of the Indian earthworm. This paper summarises some of the salient aspects of the study, in brief...|$|E
40|$|The Medical Research Council's {{trial of}} BCG and <b>vole</b> <b>bacillus</b> {{vaccines}} {{in the prevention}} of tuberculosis in Great Britain has ended after 20 years' follow-up of the 54 239 participants, who were aged 14 to 15 years when the entered the trial in 1950 - 2. Participants who were tuberculin positive on entry were left unvaccinated; those who were tuberculin negative were allocated at random to an unvaccinated or to a vaccinated group. The protective efficacy of each of the two vaccines, among those initially tuberculin negative, was 84 % during the first five years, and gradually decreased, averaging 77 % for each vaccine over the whole period. The incidence of tuberculosis decreased substantially in all groups during the trial, however, and of the total of 610 cases of tuberculosis only 27 developed between 15 and 20 years. Thus we cannot make a reliable assessment of efficacy during this final period. The prevalence and incidence of tuberculosis in Great Britain have decreased radically since this trial began. The expected benefit from large-scale BCG-vaccination of children is now far less, and may decrease further if the incidence of tuberculosis continues to decline...|$|E
