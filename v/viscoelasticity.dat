25|$|Oil {{may account}} for 75% {{or more of the}} total volume. This means that the oil {{droplets}} become distorted from their normal, spherical shape. The close packing of the droplets also allow them to interact very strongly with one another. A combination of these factors gives traditional mayonnaise its high viscosity. The <b>viscoelasticity</b> of mayonnaise made with egg yolk reaches a maximum very quickly after preparation.|$|E
25|$|Using CAE programs, a {{mechanical}} design team can quickly and cheaply iterate {{the design process}} to develop a product that better meets cost, performance, and other constraints. No physical prototype need be created until the design nears completion, allowing {{hundreds or thousands of}} designs to be evaluated, instead of a relative few. In addition, CAE analysis programs can model complicated physical phenomena which cannot be solved by hand, such as <b>viscoelasticity,</b> complex contact between mating parts, or non-Newtonian flows.|$|E
25|$|Young's modulus quantifies the {{elasticity}} of the polymer. It is defined, for small strains, as {{the ratio of}} rate of change of stress to strain. Like tensile strength, this is highly relevant in polymer applications involving the physical properties of polymers, such as rubber bands. The modulus {{is strongly dependent on}} temperature. <b>Viscoelasticity</b> describes a complex time-dependent elastic response, which will exhibit hysteresis in the stress-strain curve when the load is removed. Dynamic mechanical analysis or DMA measures this complex modulus by oscillating the load and measuring the resulting strain as a function of time.|$|E
25|$|Viscoelastic creep {{data can}} be {{presented}} {{in one of two}} ways. Total strain can be plotted as a function of time for a given temperature or temperatures. Below a critical value of applied stress, a material may exhibit linear <b>viscoelasticity.</b> Above this critical stress, the creep rate grows disproportionately faster. The second way of graphically presenting viscoelastic creep in a material is by plotting the creep modulus (constant applied stress divided by total strain at a particular time) as a function of time. Below its critical stress, the viscoelastic creep modulus is independent of stress applied. A family of curves describing strain versus time response to various applied stress may be represented by a single viscoelastic creep modulus versus time curve if the applied stresses are below the material's critical stress value.|$|E
2500|$|A polymer ( [...] ; Greek , [...] "many" [...] + , [...] "parts") {{is a large}} molecule, or macromolecule, {{composed}} of many repeated subunits. Because of their broad range of properties, both synthetic and natural polymers play essential and ubiquitous roles in everyday life. Polymers range from familiar synthetic plastics such as polystyrene to natural biopolymers such as DNA and proteins that are fundamental to biological structure and function. Polymers, both natural and synthetic, are created via polymerization of many small molecules, known as monomers. Their consequently large molecular mass relative to small molecule compounds produces unique physical properties, including toughness, <b>viscoelasticity,</b> and a tendency to form glasses and semicrystalline structures rather than crystals.|$|E

50|$|These methods {{worked to}} {{characterize}} the deformability of the red blood cell {{in terms of the}} shear, bending, area expansion moduli, and relaxation times. However, they were not able to explore the viscoelastic properties. Other techniques have been implemented such as photoacoustic measurements. This technique uses a single-pulse laser beam to generate a photoacoustic signal in tissues and the decay time for the signal is measured. According to the theory of linear <b>viscoelasticity,</b> the decay time is equal to the viscosity-elasticity ratio and therefore the <b>viscoelasticity</b> characteristics of the red blood cells could be obtained.|$|E
50|$|Though {{there are}} many {{instruments}} that test the mechanical and viscoelastic response of materials, broadband viscoelastic spectroscopy (BVS) and resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) are more commonly used to test viscoelastic behavior {{because they can be}} used above and below ambient temperatures and are more specific to testing <b>viscoelasticity.</b> These two instruments employ a damping mechanism at various frequencies and time ranges with no appeal to time-temperature superposition.

Tensile geometry {{is the most}} common for creep measurements. A small force is initially imparted to keep the specimen aligned and straight. The selected stress is applied rapidly and held constant for the required time; this may be 1 h or more. During application of force the elastic property is observed as an immediate elongation or strain.

Frank Leslie attended Harris Academy and University College, Dundee where {{he was awarded the}} B.Sc. in 1957. With a scholarship from the legacy of James Key Caird, he entered the University of Manchester for graduate study. Leslie’s gifts for communication were soon appreciated as he became assistant lecturer in 1959. The mathematics department at University of Manchester was led by James Lighthill who had pioneered an understanding of thermosyphons. Leslie extended the work with his thesis [...] "Problems of flow in the open thermosyphon and <b>viscoelasticity</b> of liquids" [...] (1961). The external examiner was James G.
