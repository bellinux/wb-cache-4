On 12th, the prime minister closed the port of Sihanoukville to the North <b>Vietnamese</b> <b>and</b> issued an impossible ultimatum to them. All PAVN/Viet Cong forces were to withdraw from Cambodian soil within 72 hours (on 15 March) or face military action.|$|E

5|$|The {{fight at}} Phou Pha Thi, which {{was part of}} a larger {{military}} campaign waged by the North <b>Vietnamese</b> <b>and</b> their Pathet Lao allies, marked the beginning of the Communist dry-season offensive against Laotian Government forces in northeastern Laos.

Against such heavy odds, General Vang Pao insisted on recapturing Phou Pha Thi, which the U.S. Embassy believed unnecessary. On 1November1968, Pao launched Operation Pig Fat in attempt to retake Phou Pha Thi, but the operation quickly turned into a rout of the Royal Laos Army and the Hmong guerrillas and Phou Pha Thi was never retaken.|$|E

5|$|By 1972 FANK was decimated, {{the road}} and rail {{networks}} were smashed, and inflation was rampant. The rice harvest plunged from 3.8million tons in 1969 to 493,000 tons in 1973. Popular {{support for the war}} against the North <b>Vietnamese</b> <b>and</b> the insurgents had completely evaporated. The Americans, negotiating with the North Vietnamese, had proposed an Indochina-wide cease fire as part of the final settlement of the conflict in South Vietnam. By that time, however, Hanoi could make no commitment on behalf of its Cambodian allies.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} few months of 1967, the Viet Cong absorbed heavy losses as a result of {{large-scale}} search and destroy missions conducted by the United States Army, and it prompted North Vietnamese leaders to review their war strategy in South Vietnam. In light of the setbacks which North <b>Vietnamese</b> <b>and</b> Viet Cong forces had experienced early in 1967, North Vietnamese General Trần Văn Trà suggested that North <b>Vietnamese</b> <b>and</b> Viet Cong forces could still be victorious if they inflicted as many casualties as possible on U.S. military units, hoping that the Americans would conclude that the war was too costly and withdraw from Vietnam. Thus, towards mid-1967, the Viet Cong 7th and 9th Divisions returned to the battlefield again, with the objective of inflicting casualties on U.S. military formations in III Corps Tactical Zone. On June 12, the U.S. 1st Infantry Division launched Operation Billings to destroy elements of the Viet Cong 9th Division, which had built-up strength around northern Phuoc Vinh.|$|E
