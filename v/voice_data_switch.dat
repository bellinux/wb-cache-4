40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 26 - 29, 1992 / Town and Country Hotel and Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaThe Edwards Digital Switch (EDS) is {{a digital}} {{communication}} system that provides advanced voice networking capabilities to the Edwards Test Range. The EDS {{is a member}} of a new family of all-digital switching systems that internally handle data in digital form. To accommodate analog <b>voice</b> and <b>data</b> circuits, conversions between analog and digital formats occur at the system interfaces. The EDS consists of six groups of configuration items: System-level control and monitoring is centralized in the Control and Display Subsystem. Workstations provide subsystem-level control and monitoring. The Central Switching Subsystem, as the primary interface with the range environment, provides system connectivity to radios, telephone circuits, and communications links to other facilities. It integrates the EDS with links to the Control Room Switching Subsystems. Each Control Room Switching Subsystem connects individual user stations within a Mission Control Room or other localized area. The user equipment element consists of a Subscriber Terminal Unit, Channel Expander, and interface panels for headsets, foot switches, and speakers. The Remote Radio Control Unit optimizes usage of available frequencies, allowing control of tunable radios from the Control and Display Subsystem. *The original name, Edwards Communication Switching System (ECSS) was changed to Edwards Digital Switch (EDS) in 1990. The Site Selection Unit facilitates the handover of voice communications between receiver sites when a long-range test is monitored. The system architecture is based on a central system-level control element, a central switch, multiple subsystem-level control elements, multiple subsystem switches, and end-equipment items that are interconnected through the switch network. The EDS combines multiple voice communications applications in a single system. The system is being expanded to integrate <b>voice</b> and <b>data</b> <b>switching.</b> Its major function is support of multiparty networked voice communications within Mission Control Rooms and between other test participants. Other voice functions are an intercom capability including both Direct Access (hot line) and Indirect Access (dial-up), subscriber loop connections to the base-level telephone exchange, and the Public Switched Network System. Digital interfaces allow integration of ciphertext data and Time Space Position Information <b>data</b> <b>switching</b> functions. A system based on the EDS design has also been installed by the Air Force at Eglin AFB. Engineering studies for systems that make use of the EDS design are currently underway by the Navy at China Lake and the Army at White Sands Missile Range. The EDS project office has actively pursued promising program management concepts such as: specifying nondevelopmental items, requiring industry standard interconnectivity and interoperability, and using a multiyear fixed-price requirements-type contract to encourage multiservice participation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a framework for understanding competition and industry structure {{in the context of}} Fiber to the Home (FTTH). We present engineering cost models, which indicate that FTTH is a decreasing cost industry, thereby making facilities based competition an unlikely outcome. Non-facilities based competition (or service level competition) in FTTH can happen in data-link layer (or transport) services via unbundled dark fiber (i. e. unbundled network elements) and in higher layer (<b>voice,</b> video and <b>data)</b> services via logical layer unbundling (or open access). FTTH architectures differ in {{the extent to which they}} support unbundling and therefore the extent of non-facilities based competition in FTTH depends on the architecture of the shared network over which multiple service providers offer service. Among the four different FTTH architectures considered, the curbside single-wavelength Passive Optical Network architecture (PON) that has isolated pole-mounted splitters has the most economical fiber plant but permits unbundling only at the logical layer. Consequently, though a PON supports ‘open access’ based competition in higher layer services like <b>voice,</b> <b>data</b> and <b>switched</b> digital video, it does not facilitate competition in data-link layer services or in the provision of analog broadcast video services. In complete contrast, the Home Run architecture has the highest initial (fiber related) capital cost, but permits unbundling of both the physical plant and at the logical layer. The Home Run architecture therefore supports a per subscriber choice of data-link layer services (via UNE based competition) as well as competition in higher layer <b>voice,</b> video and <b>data</b> services (via open access). This work further identifies deployment strategies, which can facilitate physical plant unbundling at costs much lower than the Home Run architecture. Physical plant unbundling is made possible by establishing Optimal Fiber Aggregation Points (OFAPs) that aggregate multiple distribution fibers (or homes). Unbundling is achieved at the cost of longer distribution loop lengths (vis-à-vis a curbside PON). Ideally, both passive splitters and active electronics can be deployed at an OFAP. OFAP architectures further lead to higher utilization of splitter and Optical Line Termination (OLT) ports in markets that have less than 100 % penetration thereby providing the service provider with a real option to (i) defer investment in OLT ports (ii) deploy multiple data-link layer technologies and (iii) effectively phase in new technologies - under both monopoly and competition...|$|R
40|$|For the {{transmission}} of voice traffic in IP networks, the commonly used protocol suite for realtime data transfer in IP networks leads to a large protocol overhead for <b>voice</b> <b>data</b> and a poor utilization of the bandwidth for user data. Multiplexing several flows on the same route into one IP packet overcomes this problem. In the future UMTS, realtime traffic like <b>voice</b> and circuit <b>switched</b> <b>data</b> are transported over the same network in the wireline part of the UMTS terrestrial access network. The following investigation shows the performance tradeoffs of multiplexing in {{two different types of}} quality of service enhanced IP networks.

In this research, <b>voice</b> <b>data</b> was used to estimate HR, because it can easily be recorded using a common device such as smartphone. To evaluate the feasibility of HR estimation using recorded voice, experiments were conducted with two subjects. In the experiment, 60 sets of HRs and <b>voice</b> <b>data</b> were measured per subject. A correlation between HR and the vocal frequency was observed, and the feasibility of HR estimation using <b>voice</b> <b>data</b> was confirmed.

Moreover exchanging cryptographic keys to encrypt the media stream in the Session Initiation Protocol has proven to be quite difficult task. There is a need for stronger key management protocols which will secure the <b>voice</b> <b>data</b> from all types of attack and which also provides a feasible key exchange mechanism.

40|$|Abstract—Determining how to {{transport}} delay-sensitive <b>voice</b> <b>data</b> {{has long been}} a problem in multimedia networking. The difficulty arises because <b>voice</b> and best-effort <b>data</b> are different by nature. It would not be fair to give priority to voice traffic and starve its best-effort counterpart; however, the <b>voice</b> <b>data</b> delivered might not be perceptible if each voice call is limited to the rate of an average TCP flow. To address the problem, we approach it from a user-centric perspective by tuning the <b>voice</b> <b>data</b> rate based on user satisfaction. Our contribution in this work is threefold. First, we investigate how Skype, the largest and fastest growing VoIP service on the Internet, adapts its <b>voice</b> <b>data</b> rate (i. e., the redundancy ratio) to network conditions. Second, by exploiting implementations of public domain codecs, we discover that Skype’s mechanism is not really geared to user satisfaction. Third, based on a set of systematic experiments that quantify user satisfaction under different levels of packet loss and burstiness, we derive a concise model that allows user-centric redundancy control. The model can be easily incorporated into general VoIP services (not only Skype) to ensure consistent user satisfaction...|$|R
