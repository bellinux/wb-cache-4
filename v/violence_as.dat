5|$|All Hands on the Bad One is {{the fifth}} studio album by the American rock band Sleater-Kinney, {{released}} on May 2, 2000, by Kill Rock Stars. The album was produced by John Goodmanson and recorded from December 1999 to January 2000 at Jackpot! Studio in Portland, Oregon and John & Stu's Place in Seattle, Washington. The music on the record ranges from soft melodies to fast punk rock guitar work, while the lyrics address multiple media issues, such as the image of women in rock, music journalism, and <b>violence</b> <b>as</b> entertainment, among others.|$|E

5|$|In his {{theoretical}} writings, particularly Imperialism, Lenin discussed what {{he regarded}} as developments in capitalism since Marx's death; in his view, it {{had reached a}} new stage, state monopoly capitalism. He also believed that although Russia's economy was dominated by the peasantry, that monopoly capitalism existed in Russia meant {{that the country was}} sufficiently materially developed to move to socialism. Leninism adopted a more absolutist and doctrinaire perspective than other variants of Marxism, and distinguished itself by the emotional intensity of its liberationist vision. It also stood out by emphasising the role of a vanguard who could lead the proletariat to revolution, and elevated the role of <b>violence</b> <b>as</b> a revolutionary instrument.|$|E

In Turkey, the media portrayed Galatasaray fans as acting in self-defence, with criticism directed at the British fans for allegedly attacking members of the press. However, there were conflicting reports, with claims that some Galatasaray fans were instigating some of the violence. Later on, British media blame also transferred towards Galatasaray fans.|$|E
5|$|The Hòa Hảo {{initially}} {{engaged in}} large-scale clashes with the Việt Minh in 1945, but by mid-1946 {{the two groups}} had agreed to stop fighting each other and fight the French instead. However, in June 1946, Sổ became estranged from his military leaders and started the Dân Xã (Social Democratic Party). Because of his charisma, the Việt Minh saw Sổ as a threat and assassinated him, leaving the Hòa Hảo leaderless and causing Sổ's military leaders to go their separate ways. The split caused an increase in <b>violence</b> <b>as</b> the various Hòa Hảo factions engaged in conflicts among themselves.|$|E
5|$|The episode, first {{aired on}} Channel 4 on 18 February 2013, was watched by 1.2 million viewers {{and was very}} well {{received}} by critics, particularly for its writing and Middleton's performance. The story draws parallels with real murder cases, primarily the 1960s Moors murders, where five children were killed. Its horror aspects are reminiscent of the 1970s film The Wicker Man and the video game Manhunt, while some similarities with The Twilight Zone have also been noted. This dystopian episode reflects upon several aspects of contemporary society, such as media coverage of murders, technology's effects on people's empathy, desensitization, <b>violence</b> <b>as</b> entertainment, vigilantism, the concept of justice and punishment, {{and the nature of}} reality.|$|E

5|$|The main {{goals of}} the terror was to destroy the power {{structure}} of the enemy, clear and secure the areas governed and occupied by the armies. Another goal was to create shock and fear among the civil population and the enemy soldiers. In the Finnish case, the common troopers' paramilitary nature and lack of combat skills, led to use political <b>violence</b> <b>as</b> a military weapon. The terror achieved some of the objectives, but also gave additional motivation to fight against an enemy perceived to be inhuman and cruel. The Red and White propaganda utilized the acts of the opponent effectively, which increased the local killings and the spiral of revenge.|$|E
5|$|A primary {{theme of}} the defense was that the CPUSA sought to convert the US to {{socialism}} by education, not by force. The defense claimed {{that most of the}} prosecution's documentary evidence came from older texts that pre-dated the 1935 Seventh World Congress of the Comintern, after which the CPUSA rejected <b>violence</b> <b>as</b> a means of change. Starobin, p 207. The defense attempted to introduce documents into evidence which represented the CPUSA's advocacy of peace, claiming that these policies superseded the older texts that the prosecution had introduced which emphasized violence. Medina excluded most of the material proposed by the defense because it did not directly pertain to the specific documents the prosecution had produced. As a result, the defense complained that they were unable to portray the totality of their belief system to the jury.|$|E
5|$|Disaster {{strikes at}} the press event. The craft {{apparently}} draws power from the broadcasting equipment, and its influence is magnified. The streets of London erupt into <b>violence</b> <b>as</b> those affected go on a rampage. Breen becomes drawn towards the craft and is killed. Quatermass falls under the alien control as well, but is snapped out of it by Roney, who is unaffected. The two men realise that {{a small portion of}} the population are immune. The psychic energy becomes stronger, ripping up streets and buildings, and the spectral image of a Martian towers above the city, centred on Hobbs End. Recalling stories about how the Devil could be defeated with iron and water, Roney theorises the Martian energy could be discharged into the earth. Roney climbs to the top of a building crane and swings it into the spectre. The crane bursts into flames as it discharges the energy, killing Roney, but the image disappears.|$|E

5|$|Dredd was {{released}} on 7 September 2012 in the United Kingdom and on 21 September worldwide. Critics were generally positive about the film's visual effects, casting and action, while criticism focused on excessive <b>violence</b> <b>as</b> well as a perceived lack of the satirical elements that {{are found in the}} source comic. Despite the positive critical response, the film earned just over $41 million at the box office on an estimated budget of $30–45 million. Dredd saw greater success following its home release, and has since been recognised as a cult film. The theatrical gross made a sequel unlikely, but home media sales and fan efforts endorsed by 2000 ADs publisher Rebellion Developments have maintained the possibility of a second film.|$|E
5|$|Federal {{prosecutors}} {{launched an}} investigation {{to determine if}} he had acted out of hatred for Obama. Writings by Ortega-Hernandez and testimonies from {{those who knew him}} revealed that he believed that he was Jesus, and that President Obama was the Antichrist and the devil. Ortega-Hernandez was not found to be affiliated with any extremist groups. In September 2013, Ortega-Hernandez pled guilty to two of the nineteen charges against him: one count of destruction of property and one count of discharging a firearm during a crime of <b>violence.</b> <b>As</b> part of his plea bargain, the remaining charges were dropped, including the charge of attempting to assassinate the President, which carried a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. On March 31, 2014, Ortega-Hernandez was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment by Judge Rosemary M. Collyer. His lawyers had asked for a 10-year sentence, stating Ortega-Hernandez was suffering from depression and stress. Prosecutors had asked for the maximum sentence of 27½ years. He is serving his sentence at United States Penitentiary, Beaumont, with a release date of October 24, 2033.|$|E
5|$|On 27 February 2002, a train {{carrying}} Hindu pilgrims {{was burned}} {{outside the town}} of Godhra, killing 59 people. The incident {{was seen as an}} attack upon Hindus, and sparked off massive anti-Muslim violence across the state of Gujarat that lasted several weeks. The death toll estimated was as high as 2000, while 150,000 were displaced. Rape, mutilation, and torture were also widespread. The then-Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi and several high-ranking government officials were accused of initiating and condoning the <b>violence,</b> <b>as</b> were police officers who allegedly directed the rioters and gave them lists of Muslim-owned properties. In April 2009, a Special Investigation Team (SIT) was appointed by the Supreme Court to investigate and expedite the Gujarat riots cases. In 2012, Modi was cleared of complicity in the violence by the SIT and BJP MLA Maya Kodnani, who later held a cabinet portfolio in the Modi government, was convicted of having orchestrated one of the riots and sentenced to 28 years imprisonment. Scholars such as Paul Brass, Martha Nussbaum and Dipankar Gupta have said that there was a high level of state complicity in the incidents.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the course}} of the late Republic, {{formerly}} authoritative institutions lost their credibility and authority. For example, the Sullan reforms to the Senate strongly split the aristocratic class between those who stayed in the city and those who rose to high office abroad, further increasing class divides between Romans, even at the highest levels. Furthermore, the dominance of the military in the late Republic, along with stronger ties between a general and his troops, caused by their longer terms of service together and the troops' reliance on that general to provide for their retirements, along with an obstructionist central government, meant a huge number of malcontent soldiers willing to take up arms against the state. Adding in the institutionalisation of <b>violence</b> <b>as</b> a means to obstruct or force political change (e.g. the deaths of the Gracchi and Sulla's dictatorship, respectively), the Republic was caught in an ever more violent and anarchic struggle between the Senate, assemblies at Rome, and the promagistrates. It would only be resolved by civil war, a war which the promagistrate governors and their troops would win, and in doing so, collapse the Republic.|$|E
5|$|Scholars have {{discussed}} Not in Front of the Children in academic journal articles, and characterized it {{as a work}} which balances education policy against {{the negative consequences of}} censorship. In an article for Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy, Middlebury College women's studies professor Deborah Grant compared the book to Harmful to Minors by Judith Levine. Grant characterized both books as significant works emphasizing the importance of allowing youths access to informative educational resources. She classed Heins' monograph as a thorough and important survey of the chronology of censorship. Perry L. Glanzer wrote in English Journal that Heins had a valid viewpoint to engage students on controversial topics in literature classes, and he added it was necessary to teach them all perspectives of a debate. Ellen P. Goodman wrote for Berkeley Technology Law Journal that Heins was critical of prior articles which attempted to show negative impact from <b>violence</b> <b>as</b> portrayed on television programs.|$|E
5|$|Society in {{the urban}} {{settlements}} of the burghs was headed by wealthier merchants, who often held local office as a burgess, alderman, bailies, or {{as a member of}} the burgh council. Below them were craftsmen and workers that made up the majority of the urban population. Both merchants and craftsmen often served a long apprenticeship, acquiring skills and status, before they became freemen of a burgh, and could enjoy certain rights and privileges. Major sources of trade included the export of wool, fish, coal, salt and cattle. Imports included wine, sugar and other luxury goods. Important crafts included metal working, carpentry, leather working, pottery and later brewing and wig-making. There were frequent disputes between the burgesses and craftsmen over rights and political control of the burgh, occasionally bursting into <b>violence,</b> <b>as</b> occurred at Perth in the first half of the sixteenth century.|$|E
