5|$|A {{number of}} {{programme}} evaluations {{have found that}} many resettled refugees have been the victims of <b>verbal</b> <b>or</b> physical attacks in the UK. The Home Office's 2009 evaluation notes that between one-quarter and half of each of four groups of Liberian and Congolese refugees resettled under the programme had suffered <b>verbal</b> <b>or</b> physical harassment. An evaluation undertaken by academics at Sheffield Hallam University for the Home Office in 2011 found that one-fifth of the refugees surveyed for the evaluation (who {{had been in the}} UK for a year) had been the victims of <b>verbal</b> <b>or</b> physical attacks in their first six months in the UK, and just over a fifth had been attacked in the second six months of their resettlement. Many of the victims of this abuse had not reported it to the authorities, and the authors of the evaluation suggest that this is a reason why there was a gap between the perceptions of refugee and service providers, who generally suggested that community relations were good. Verbal and physical attacks against refugees were also noted in the 2013 Motherwell evaluation.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{informal}} rules governing fighting in ice hockey that players rarely discuss but take quite seriously. The {{most important aspect}} of this etiquette is that opposing enforcers must agree to a fight, usually via a <b>verbal</b> <b>or</b> physical exchange on the ice. This agreement helps both players avoid being given an instigator penalty, and helps keep unwilling participants out of fights.|$|E
5|$|Joint {{attention}} or shared attention is the shared focus of two individuals on an object. It is achieved when one individual alerts another to an object {{by means of}} eye-gazing, pointing or other <b>verbal</b> <b>or</b> non-verbal indications. An individual gazes at another individual, points to an object and then returns their gaze to the individual. Scaife and Bruner were the first researchers to present a cross-sectional description of children's ability to follow eye gaze in 1975. They found that most eight- to ten-month-old children followed a line of regard, and that all 11- to 14-month-old children did so. This early research showed {{it was possible for}} an adult to bring certain objects in the environment to an infant's attention using eye gaze.|$|E

25|$|In many cases, {{only the}} verbal aspects {{are taken into}} consideration. This is usually {{referred}} to as <b>verbal</b> intelligence <b>or</b> <b>verbal</b> fluency, and is commonly a reflection of an individual's overall linguistic intelligence.|$|R
5|$|Till {{was born}} and raised in Chicago and in August 1955, was visiting {{relatives}} near Money, in the Mississippi Delta region. He spoke to 21-year-old Carolyn Bryant, the white married proprietor of a small grocery store there. Although what happened at the store is a matter of dispute, Till was accused of flirting with or whistling at Bryant. Decades later, Bryant disclosed that, in 1955, she had fabricated testimony that Till made <b>verbal</b> <b>or</b> physical advances towards her in the store. Till's reported behavior, perhaps unwittingly, violated the strictures of conduct for an African American male interacting with a white woman in the Jim Crow-era South. Several nights after the store incident, Bryant's husband Roy and his half-brother J. W. Milam went armed to Till's great-uncle's house and abducted the boy. They took him away and beat and mutilated him before shooting him in the head and sinking his body in the Tallahatchie River. Three days later, Till's body was discovered and retrieved from the river.|$|E

25|$|Admission of guilt: if a {{declarant}} makes a statement, <b>verbal</b> <b>or</b> otherwise, as {{an admission}} of guilt of the matter at hand, that statement is admissible. Unlike other cases of declarations against interest, the declarant in this situation need not be unavailable.|$|E
25|$|These touches {{serve to}} lighten an interaction.

25|$|Abuse {{of parents}} by their {{children}} is a common but under-reported and under-researched subject. Parents are quite often subject to levels of childhood aggression, typically {{in the form of}} <b>verbal</b> <b>or</b> physical abuse, in excess of normal childhood aggressive outbursts. Parents feel a sense of shame and humiliation to have that problem, so they rarely seek help; nor is much help available today.|$|E
25|$|In none of {{the papers}} is there any {{suggestion}} there was <b>verbal</b> <b>or</b> physical violence {{on the part of}} Sergeant Woodard. It's quite unclear what really happened. What did happen with certainty is the next morning when the sun came up, Sergeant Isaac Woodard was blind for life.During the course of the night in jail, Shull beat and blinded Woodard. Woodard also suffered partial amnesia {{as a result of his}} injuries.|$|E
25|$|Through much {{of modern}} South Korean history, the {{military}} was largely cushioned from public scrutiny, resulting in decades of abuse and inhumane treatment among military personnel. Since 1993, the public has vocally deplored the human rights violations taking place within the military, such as extreme hazing. In 1997, the government enacted legislation protecting the legal and human rights of soldiers {{serving in the military}} by approving a bill that bans physical, <b>verbal,</b> <b>or</b> sexual abuse among soldiers.|$|E

50|$|The {{entrance}} {{criteria for}} IQ societies vary considerably across {{both kinds of}} tests accepted (for example, whether the tests tap primarily numerical, spatial, <b>or</b> <b>verbal</b> abilities, <b>or</b> whether the tests have adequate test security or not) and how high one must score in order to acquire membership.|$|R
25|$|The {{inability}} to communicate, verbally or non-verbally, is a core deficit in Autism. Children with Autism are often engaged in repetitive activity or other behaviors because they cannot convey their intent any other way. They {{do not know}} how to communicate their ideas to caregivers or others. Helping a child with Autism learn to communicate their needs and ideas is absolutely core to any intervention. Communication can either be <b>verbal</b> <b>or</b> non-verbal. Children with Autism require intensive intervention to learn how to communicate their intent.|$|E
25|$|TWU workers {{also raised}} {{complaints}} about working conditions, including hazards such as smoke, dangerous chemicals and extreme temperatures, abuse from supervisors, <b>verbal</b> <b>or</b> physical threat from passengers, and inability to access restroom facilities {{on the bus}} and subway. Just before the contract ended, the MTA offered a 3.5% per year raise and no change in the retirement age, with the caveat that new transit workers pay 6% of their wages into the pension fund, up from the 2% that current workers pay. The offer was rejected, and a strike declared.|$|E
25|$|After {{determining}} {{that the subject}} is cooperative, the reader will make a number of probing statements or questions, typically using variations of the methods noted below. The subject will then reveal further information with their replies (whether <b>verbal</b> <b>or</b> non-verbal) and the cold reader can continue from there, pursuing promising lines of inquiry and quickly abandoning or avoiding unproductive ones. In general, while revelations seem {{to come from the}} reader, most of the facts and statements come from the subject, which are then refined and restated by the reader so as to reinforce the idea that the reader got something correct.|$|E
