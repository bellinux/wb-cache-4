5|$|Although Ravel {{wrote for}} mixed choirs and male solo voices, he is chiefly associated, in his songs, with the soprano and {{mezzo-soprano}} voices. Even when setting lyrics clearly narrated by a man, he often favoured a female voice, {{and he seems}} to have preferred his best-known cycle, Shéhérazade, to be sung by a woman, although a tenor <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> permitted alternative in the score.|$|E

It was initiated as a result of publicity surrounding the Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal. The Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) jointly produced this report.

25|$|Windows Media Audio Voice (WMA <b>Voice)</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> lossy {{audio codec}} that competes with Speex (used in Microsoft's own Xbox Live online service), ACELP, and other codecs. Designed for low-bandwidth, voice {{playback}} applications, it employs low-pass and high-pass filtering of sound outside the human speech frequency range to achieve higher compression efficiency than WMA. It can automatically detect sections of an audio track containing both voice {{and music and}} use the standard WMA compression algorithm instead. WMA Voice supports up to 22.05kHz for a single channel (mono) only. Encoding is limited to constant bit rate (CBR) and up to 20kbit/s. The first and only version of the codec is WMA 9 Voice.|$|E
25|$|The {{actors who}} voiced the {{characters}} would later reprise {{their roles in}} The Simpsons. Dan Castellaneta performed the voices of Homer Simpson, Abraham Simpson, and Krusty the Clown. Homer's voice sounds different in the shorts compared to most episodes of the half-hour show. In the shorts, his <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> loose impression of Walter Matthau, whereas it is more robust and humorous on the half-hour show, allowing Homer to cover a fuller range of emotions. Voices were needed for the shorts, so the producers decided to ask Castellaneta as well as Julie Kavner to voice Homer and Marge, rather than hire more actors. Nancy Cartwright and Yeardley Smith performed the voices of Bart Simpson and Lisa Simpson respectively.|$|E
25|$|This glossy all-black crow has a {{heavy black}} bill with an arching culmen (upper {{edge of the}} mandible) and has a fine tip. The {{feathers}} have a purple gloss throughout. The tail of the Indian jungle crow is rounded and the legs and feet are stout. The Himalayan japonensis (in this sense including western intermedius and eastern tibetosinensis) has a slightly wedge-shaped tail and a <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> guttural and grating graak (intermedius) or a hoarse kyarrh (tibetosinensis). The calls of the Indian jungle crow are not unlike that of the house crow but are harsher. In Sri Lanka, the house crow lacks the light grey neck but the neck is slimmer than in the jungle crow. The sexes are indistinguishable.|$|E

25|$|Multimodal {{stimulation}} and music: By combining music, such as lullabies, and multimodal stimulation, premature infants were {{discharged from}} the NICU sooner, than those infants who did not receive therapy. Multimodal stimulation (MMS) includes the applications of auditory, tactile, vestibular, and visual stimulation that helps aid in premature infant development. The combination of music and MMS helps premature infants sleep and conserve vital energy required to gain weight more rapidly. Studies have shown that girls respond more positively than boys during multimodal stimulation. While the <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> popular choice for parents looking to bond with their premature infants, other effective instruments include the Remo Ocean Disk and the Gato Box. Both are used to stimulate {{the sounds of the}} womb. The Remo Ocean Disk, a round musical instrument that mimics the fluid sounds of the womb, has been shown to benefit decreased heart rate after therapeutic uses, as well as promoting healthy sleep patterns, lower respiratory rates and improve sucking behavior.|$|E

The story, written by Djojopranoto, follows two young men who compete for the affections of a woman before learning that they are long-lost brothers.|$|E
500|$|Although Marge is {{her most}} famous character, Kavner's {{favorite}} characters to voice are her sisters Patty and Selma Bouvier because [...] "they're really funny and sad {{at the same}} time". Series creator Matt Groening instructed Kavner to voice the duo as characters who [...] "suck {{the life out of}} everything". Both have similar raspy voices, but Patty's voice is more masculine and has a lower register, while Selma's <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> little sweeter. Kavner also provides the voices of every other female member of the Bouvier family, including Marge's mother Jacqueline, Great-Aunt Gladys (a dead relative who was introduced on season four's [...] "Selma's Choice"), and an unnamed grandmother seen on the season six episode [...] "Fear of Flying".|$|E

500|$|Initially, {{a version}} of the song {{featuring}} the vocals of Romanian singer Alessia was released in early 2009, and drew comparisons to Inna's [...] "Hot" [...] (2008) at that time. The track was further credited to Bogdan Croitoru, also known as Fizz, which opted for the pseudonym of Bob Taylor. However, following a dispute over compensation, the artists decided to quit their collaboration and Alessia demanded her vocals to be replaced with others, although [...] "Déjà Vu" [...] had already experienced commercial success in Romania and had been heavily played in night clubs. Particularly, the track was handed to Inna to re-record. According to Alessia, whose <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> semi-tone higher than Inna's, the latter had a disadvantage when re-recording the song as it was not in her tonality, and this could not be changed because the track was already finished.|$|E
500|$|Scholars {{argue that}} Lee's {{approach}} to class and race was more complex [...] "than ascribing racial prejudice primarily to 'poor white trash'... Lee demonstrates how issues {{of gender and}} class intensify prejudice, silence the voices that might challenge the existing order, and greatly complicate many Americans' conception {{of the causes of}} racism and segregation." [...] Lee's use of the middle-class narrative <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> literary device that allows an intimacy with the reader, regardless of class or cultural background, and fosters a sense of nostalgia. [...] Sharing Scout and Jem's perspective, the reader is allowed to engage in relationships with the conservative antebellum Mrs. Dubose; the lower-class Ewells, and the Cunninghams who are equally poor but behave in vastly different ways; the wealthy but ostracized Mr. Dolphus Raymond; and Calpurnia {{and other members of the}} black community. [...] The children internalize Atticus' admonition not to judge someone until they have walked around in that person's skin, gaining a greater understanding of people's motives and behavior.|$|E
500|$|Costa's singing <b>voice</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{combination}} of classical and pop singing. Aurora's songs were recorded {{within the first}} year of production. Costa would practice her songs live with the orchestra before recording them. After working on the film for three years, Costa finally finished recording in 1955, long before the film was completed; it would take the animators another several years to complete the footage to accompany Costa's vocals and dialogue. Costa would often return to the studio to re-record lines as the story changed and evolved, which she described as a [...] "painstaking" [...] process. However, with only 18 spoken lines, Aurora speaks less than any other main character in a full-length Disney animated feature – aside from Dumbo, who is completely silent – and has absolutely no dialogue once she is awoken from her deep sleep. The character's lack of dialogue is attributed to the fact that she remains asleep {{for the majority of the}} film. Ultimately, Costa's performance in Sleeping Beauty – and Walt Disney himself – inspired her to pursue a full-time career as a professional opera singer. Costa's salary was $250 per week.|$|E
