50|$|After {{the witness}} {{notified}} the Tennessee Highway Patrol, two {{law enforcement officers}} performed a preliminary search of the area around 7 pm, but they found nothing. By 11:30 pm, a search party was organized consisting of the Highway Patrol, Civil Defense, and local officers who searched the area throughout the night. At 6:10 am on March 6, the wreckage was discovered. A three-foot hole indicated the area of initial impact and debris was scattered over an area 166 ft long and 130 ft wide.

5000|$|On 7 December 2009, an Airlink Embraer ERJ 135 (registration:ZS-SJW) on {{scheduled}} flight SA 8625, overshot the runway {{when trying to}} land in wet weather at George Airport; no fatalities were reported. The flight from Cape Town to George was cleared for an instrument landing (ILS) approach and prevailing weather conditions {{at the time were}} overcast, with light rain. The landing appeared normal, however the aircraft did not vacate the runway but instead veered to the right and collided with approach lights before it burst through the airport's perimeter fence, coming to rest <b>in</b> a <b>nose-down</b> <b>attitude</b> on a public road. The aircraft was damaged beyond economical repair. Probable cause: The crew were unable to decelerate the aircraft to a safe stop due to ineffective braking of the aircraft on a wet runway surface, resulting in an overrun. Two months before the accident the runway was resurfaced with a fog spray sealant. The George area was experiencing a drought at the time and {{on the day of the}} accident it was the first rain they had received since the resurfacing. The fog sprayed surface caused a degradation of the surface friction and promoted the formation of pooling on the surface. After touch down the aircraft started aquaplaning. The crew veered to the right to prevent a collision with the localiser antenna. The runway was found non-compliant with ICAO annex 14 and was subsequently resurfaced. Airlink's insurers took legal action against the state-owned Airports Company of South Africa.|$|R

2500|$|All {{wreckage}} {{was found}} along a 209 metre long, 50 metre wide {{section of the}} seabed {{at a depth of}} 78 metres. Investigators found no evidence of structural failure inflight. The damage to the aircraft was roughly symmetrical left-to-right, indicating the aircraft was close to wings-level flight on impact. The separation of the left landing gear leg compared to the bending of the right leg suggested to investigators that impact with the water happened with the left wing slightly lower than the right, as the left gear was the more damaged, and therefore subject to more force against the water. When the left wingtip contacted the water, investigators conclude that the aircraft cartwheeled, bringing the right wing down into the water with great force, which they report as being consistent with the nose gear being bent to the right as well as aft.

5000|$|By March 1936, Algerian and Swiss {{authorities}} had banned the flying of HM.14s, and the French Air Ministry {{stepped up its}} actions from cautionary notices to flight testing by the French Air Force, that resulted in an inconclusive published report. In June 1936, the French Minister for Air stopped all Flea flights in France, pending full-size wind tunnel tests at Chalais-Meudon. In July 1936, the published report described how pitch-up control could be lost <b>in</b> a shallow <b>nose-down</b> <b>attitude,</b> because the pivoting front wing reduced the separation from the rear wing (the [...] "slot effect"), so that the aircraft could not be recovered from a dive into the ground. The effect was worsened if the centre of gravity had not been correctly calculated and adjusted. Mignet responded with several design changes, such as pivoting rear wing, different aerofoil contours on both wings, elimination of the overlap between the wings, and an adjustable fore-and-aft wing pivot location relative to the fuselage. In late 1936, those features, together with rigid wing control struts ("push-rods"), were embodied in an updated edition of his book Le Sport de l'Air. In August 1936, the Royal Aircraft Establishment started full-size wind tunnel tests using HM.14 G-AEFV. In October 1936, the report was published, confirming the French test findings. The Air Ministry then stopped renewing the Authorisation to Fly documents of all HM.14-related aircraft that had not received approved modifications. After World War II, no HM.14s were granted UK Authorisations to Fly, although several further examples were built.|$|R

25|$|Lloyd {{selected}} the Armstrong Siddeley Tiger IX radial engine {{to power the}} Whitley, which was capable of generating 795 horsepower. One of the more innovative features of the Whitley's design was {{the adoption of a}} three-bladed two-position variable-pitch propeller built by de Havilland; the Whitley was the first aircraft to fly with such an arrangement. As Lloyd was unfamiliar with the use of flaps on a large heavy monoplane, they were initially omitted from the design. To compensate, the mid-set wings were set at a high angle of incidence (8.5°) to confer good take-off and landing performance. Although flaps were included late in the design stage, the wing remained unaltered; as a result, the Whitley flew with a pronounced <b>nose-down</b> <b>attitude</b> when flown with the wings in the cruising position, resulting in considerable drag.|$|R

The dangers attending improper execution and the importance of such factors as air speed fuselage attitude, glide-path angle, and control manipulation, upon all of which a pilot bases his judgement, are emphasized. Of most importance in connection with the use of flaps are: the maintenance of a sufficient margin of speed above the stall; a decisive use of the controls at the proper time; more cautious use of power during the approach glide; and, above all, the willingness to accept the steep <b>nose-down</b> <b>attitude</b> necessary <b>in</b> the glide resulting from the use of flaps...|$|R
40|$|The free wing/free trimmer {{concept was}} {{analytically}} studied in order to: (1) compare the {{fore and aft}} trimmer configurations {{on the basis of}} equal lift capability, rather than equal area; (2) assess the influence of tip mounted aft trimmers, both free and fixed, on the lateral directional modes and turbulence responses; (3) examine the feasibility of using differential tip mounted trimmer deflection for lateral control; (4) determine the effects of independent fuselage attitude on the lateral directional behavior; and (5) estimate the influence of wing sweep on dynamic behavior and structural weight. Results indicate that the forward trimmer concept is feasible with the reduced size examined, but it remains inferior to the aft trimmer in every respect except structural weight.

In this accident, the glider broke up in flight during the recovery phase after a departure from controlled flight while maneuvering in thermal lift conditions. Airborne witnesses in other gliders who saw the beginning of the accident sequence said the glider was in a tight turn, as if climbing in a thermal, when it entered a spiral. With a 45-degree <b>nose-down</b> <b>attitude,</b> the speed quickly built up as the glider completed two full rotations. The rotation then stopped, the flight stabilized on a northeasterly heading, and the nose pitched further down to a near-vertical attitude (this is consistent with the spin recovery technique specified in the Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM)). The glider was observed to level its attitude, with the wings bending upward and the wing tips coning higher, when the outboard wing tip panels separated from the glider, the wings disintegrated, and the fuselage dived into the ground. Several witnesses estimated that the wing deflection reached 45 degrees or more before the wings failed.
