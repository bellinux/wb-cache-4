Conclusions about whether the model {{is consistent with the}} bans from the various regimes depend on assumptions about market structure, demand elasticities, and discount factors.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} unique {{disaggregated data}} for three U. S. automakers and three Japanese {{to assess how}} changes in exchange rates, factor costs, and <b>voluntary</b> export <b>restraints</b> have affected recent price competitiveness in the U. S. passenger car market. We find support for several familiar relationships. The support provided by {{the experience of the}} late 1970 s is straightforward. The dollar's foreign- exchange value fell below its historical trend, in both nominal and cost- adjusted (real) terms, relative to the major suppliers of U. S. auto imports. U. S. price competitiveness tracked U. S. cost competitiveness quite closely, as average prices of U. S. automakers rose more slowly than those of their principal rival firms (all Japanese). "Misalignment" of the dollar toward weakness by historical norms was reflected in competitive relative pricing by U. S. auto firms, again with respect to a historical norm. The support provided by the experience of the years 1980 - 1985 is more complex and interesting. Strong offsetting forces appear to have been at work. Relative to major auto suppliers, the effective nominal dollar rose gradually toward its level of the mid- 1970 s, but the effective real "auto dollar" rose much faster, increasing to a level well above its historical norm by early 1985. U. S. cost competitiveness deteriorated not so much because of exchange rates, but because unit labor costs in manufacturing rose in the U. S. relative to those in major auto suppliers. U. S. auto price competitiveness began to deteriorate correspondingly, but soon stopped, and instead improved gradually between 1982 and 1985, ending up at about the same level in 1985 as in 1980. The <b>Voluntary</b> <b>Restraint</b> <b>Arrangements</b> (VRAs) with Japan, which began in 1981, seem to be the explanation for why the negative effects of exchange rates and costs on U. S. auto price competitiveness were offset. The VRAs are also a reason why average prices of U. S. automakers rose faster than other U. S. prices as measured by the consumer price index, and why in Japan, average prices on auto sales to the U. S. rose much faster than other Japanese prices. In sum, "misalignment" of the dollar toward strength by historical norms and deteriorating labor cost competitiveness, which tended to undermine the competitiveness of U. S. auto firms, were offset by the Japanese VRAs, which buttressed it. The VRAs, however, undermined the inter-sectoral competitiveness of autos. ...|$|R

This quota was originally intended to expire after three years, in April 1984. However, with a growing deficit in trade with Japan, and under pressure from domestic manufacturers, the US government extended the quotas for an additional year.

40|$|The {{realization}} of a multifaceted self {{is an ideal}} one strives to realize. One realizes such a self in large part through interaction with others in various social roles. Such realization requires a significant degree of informational privacy. Informational privacy {{is the ability to}} determine for yourself when others may collect and how they may use your information. The {{realization of}} multifaceted selves requires informational privacy in public. There is no contradiction here: informational privacy is a matter of control, and you can have such control in public. Current information processing practices greatly reduce privacy in public thereby threatening the realization of multifaceted selves. To understand way this is happening and {{to figure out how to}} respond, we analyze the foundations of privacy in public. Privacy in public consists in privacy by obscurity and privacy by <b>voluntary</b> <b>restraint.</b> Privacy by obscurity is essentially a matter of getting lost in the crowd. Privacy by <b>voluntary</b> <b>restraint</b> was perhaps first explicitly discussed by the great nineteen century sociologist, Georg Simmel. He was impressed by the fact that people voluntary limit their knowledge of each other as interact in various social roles. Merchants and customers, students and teachers, restaurant customers and waiters, for example, typically exchange only the information necessary to their interaction in those roles and voluntarily refrain from requesting, disclosing, or otherwise discovering more. Advances in information processing have greatly reduced both privacy by obscurity and privacy by <b>voluntary</b> <b>restraint.</b> We focus on the latter. One reason is that, as privacy by obscurity declines, the need for privacy in public by <b>voluntary</b> <b>restraint</b> increases. We confine our attention to the private sector; however, given the current corporate-government surveillance partnership, constraining private information processing is an essential part of constraining governmental processing. Unlike privacy by obscurity, you need the cooperation of others to realize privacy by <b>voluntary</b> <b>restraint.</b> We explain the cooperation by appeal to informational norms, norms that define contextually varying permissions and restrictions on the collection, use, and distribution of information. Norm-implemented coordination is essential to privacy in public (in the form of <b>voluntary</b> <b>restraint),</b> and it is this coordination that advances in information processing and related business practices undermined. This happens in two ways. First, businesses exploit existing norms to create a debased form of “coordination” that serves their interests while eroding privacy in public. Second, technology-driven business innovation has created new forms of interaction not governed by relevant information norms. This lack of norms means the lack the coordination essential to privacy in public. As privacy in public disappears, multifaceted selves face the threat of disappearing—literally—from the scene. The solution is to establish norms that ensure sufficient privacy in public. We conclude by considering the prospects for doing so. Our results are highly relevant to the proper legal approach to privacy. A critical task for legal regulation, as well as public policy generally, is the creation of appropriate informational norms. One of our primary motives is to reorient privacy regulation toward that task...|$|R
