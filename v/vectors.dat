A horizontal force pointing northeast can therefore be split into two forces, one pointing north, and one pointing east. Summing these component forces using vector addition yields the original force. Resolving force <b>vectors</b> into components of a set of basis <b>vectors</b> is often a more mathematically clean way to describe forces than using magnitudes and directions. This is because, for orthogonal components, the components of the vector sum are uniquely determined by the scalar addition of the components of the individual <b>vectors.</b> Orthogonal components are independent of each other because forces acting at ninety degrees to each other have no effect on the magnitude or direction of the other. Choosing a set of orthogonal basis <b>vectors</b> is often done by considering what set of basis <b>vectors</b> will make the mathematics most convenient. Choosing a basis vector that is {{in the same direction as}} one of the forces is desirable, since that force would then have only one non-zero component.
