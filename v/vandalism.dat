5|$|By {{the late}} 20th century, Michigan's harsh winters {{had taken a}} toll on the terra cotta statue, as had <b>vandalism</b> by fans of MSU's rival school, the University of Michigan. While annual repair work helped stem {{the damage done by}} precipitation, extreme cold, and <b>vandalism,</b> the statue needed more {{intensive}} repair.|$|E
5|$|Lawrence Hill is {{considered}} a blackspot for railway trespass and <b>vandalism.</b>|$|E
5|$|We {{all wanted}} {{peaceful}} protests, and our slogan was no to <b>vandalism.</b>|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1990s, the park {{experienced}} {{a surge in}} <b>vandalism,</b> littering, and wildfires caused by off-roading, and Roxy Ann Road became nearly impassable {{because of lack of}} maintenance. Medford police officers had to devote much of their time to patrolling the mountain, made difficult by the park's remote location. To alleviate these problems, the city regraded Roxy Ann Road in 1998, and installed two gates near the park entrance two years later. By 2006, <b>vandalism</b> had decreased by 70 percent.|$|E
5|$|On December 6, 2016, Whitlock's Moonachie, New Jersey {{home was}} subject to <b>vandalism</b> with racially charged graffiti. The {{perpetrator}} broke into his home, graffiti-ed several racial slurs and swastikas on his walls, and stole jewelry and electronics.|$|E
5|$|Security {{concerns}} {{were brought up}} by the public when two incidents of <b>vandalism</b> at train depots occurred within two years. In both incidents, graffiti on the affected trains were discovered after they entered revenue service.|$|E
5|$|Although both Pi Vell and Pi Jove are officially protected, {{they are}} easily {{accessible}} {{in an isolated}} wooded area, and therefore vulnerable to <b>vandalism</b> as well as natural hazards such as lightning and wildfire. Several proposals have been made {{over the years to}} improve the site.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, Halloween had turned into a night of <b>vandalism,</b> with {{destruction}} of property and cruelty to animals and people. Around 1912, the BSA, Boys Clubs and other neighborhood organizations came together to encourage a safe celebration that would end the destruction that had become so common on this night.|$|E
5|$|By the 1980s the {{sculpture}} was crumbling; cracks had developed, {{details of the}} figures had worn away, and moisture had eroded the internal structure. In wintertime the fountain had to be protected by a tarp. Weather, air pollution, and <b>vandalism</b> meant that {{hundreds of thousands of}} dollars were now needed for restoration.|$|E
5|$|Covina, California. A {{replica of}} San Lorenzo Head 5 was donated to Covina in 1989, {{originally}} intended {{to be placed in}} Jalapa Park. Due to concerns over potential <b>vandalism</b> it was instead installed outside the police station. It was removed in 2011 and relocated to Jobe's Glen, Jalapa Park in June 2012.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, {{a series of}} letters between Eldon {{businessmen}} and Carl E. Smith, the newly-inherited owner of the house, revealed differing opinions on continued use of the house: Smith wanted to renovate the house and protect it from <b>vandalism</b> only; the Eldon leaders were more in favor of making the house a historic site. The house was abandoned {{for much of the}} 1970s—a bullet was fired in an upstairs bedroom; weather and <b>vandalism</b> took their toll as well. Only in the late 1980s did the owner of the property consider turning the house over to the state. Indeed, many southern Iowans were conflicted on the issue—the owner wanted to keep the house only because he believed the current renters would have nowhere else to go if they were forced to leave.|$|E
5|$|Máximo Sexy won the {{championship}} on January 30, 2015, by defeating El Terrible. On May 22, 2017, then-reigning champion Máximo Sexy {{was fired by}} CMLL for his involvement {{in an act of}} <b>vandalism</b> and {{the championship}} was vacated. On June 6, 2017 Marco Corleone won a 10-man torneo cibernetico elimination match to become the new CMLL World Heavyweight Champion.|$|E
5|$|Reactions to the {{disclosure}} were diverse, encompassing commentary and {{articles in the}} electronic, print, and broadcast media; the Wikipedia community researched Essjay's article edits to check for errors and debated proposals to improve the project's handling of personal identification. In his editorial activities Jordan spent less time editing the content of articles and more time addressing <b>vandalism</b> and resolving editorial disputes.|$|E
5|$|Social {{media was}} blamed for {{bringing}} unwanted {{visitors to the}} site and not {{pointing out that the}} area is off-limits to the public. Following these acts of <b>vandalism,</b> the state of Hawaii asked for the removal of directions to Kaniakapūpū on many social media websites and tourism blogs, and encouraged those who knew the direction to the ruins to come with respect.|$|E
5|$|The crane {{fell into}} disuse in 1980s, {{and in the}} {{intervening}} period of neglect, the crane suffered <b>vandalism</b> to the wheelhouse and corrosion to the structure. In 1988 the crane was recognised as a Category A Listed historical structure.|$|E
5|$|The restorations {{completed}} in 1971 made the structure {{wind and water}} tight, added extra windows and installed fresh glazing, but {{as it was then}} abandoned again, weather elements exacerbated by <b>vandalism</b> led to further structural deterioration. The castle was in a ruinous condition in 2013 and unfit for habitation.|$|E
5|$|UNESCO {{identified}} three {{specific areas of}} concern under {{the present state of}} conservation: (i) <b>vandalism</b> by visitors; (ii) soil erosion in the south-eastern part of the site; and (iii) analysis and restoration of missing elements. The soft soil, the numerous earthquakes and heavy rains lead to the destabilization of the structure. Earthquakes are by far the most important contributing factors, since not only do stones fall down and arches crumble, but the earth itself can move in waves, further destroying the structure. The increasing popularity of the stupa brings in many visitors, most of whom are from Indonesia. Despite warning signs on all levels not to touch anything, the regular transmission of warnings over loudspeakers and the presence of guards, <b>vandalism</b> on reliefs and statues is a common occurrence and problem, leading to further deterioration. As of 2009, there is no system in place {{to limit the number of}} visitors allowed per day or to introduce mandatory guided tours only.|$|E
5|$|After being decommissioned, Coalhouse Fort was leased {{and used}} as a storage {{facility}} by Bata Shoes, which operated the nearby Bata shoe factory in East Tilbury. It was also used for a while for emergency housing for demobilised servicemen and their families. In 1959, the parade ground {{was used as a}} coal store during a miners' strike. Thurrock Urban District Council (now Thurrock Council) purchased the fort in 1962 and still own it. The council turned the area around the fort into a riverside park but the building itself decayed badly through neglect and <b>vandalism.</b>|$|E
5|$|After their arrest, law {{enforcement}} officials investigated whether Adolf, Gartrell and Johnson were linked to <b>vandalism</b> shootings that targeted at least two federal buildings in Denver two weeks prior to their arrest. Windows were shot at the U.S. Custom House and the U.S. Military Entrance Processing Station in Denver's downtown Federal District. Authorities were also studying whether a bullet recovered from a Hertz rental car shot on August 15 could have matched the guns seized from the men.|$|E
5|$|Although {{some work}} was done to {{strengthen}} the structure in the 1960s, the complex was allowed to fall into disrepair. Also during the 1960s, some sections of the complex began to be left unoccupied and others burned down including an engine block. During this period, parts of the complex were used for light industrial use before they too fell into disuse. In the 1990s, the buildings fell victim to <b>vandalism</b> and arson that threatened to destroy {{what remained of the}} site.|$|E
5|$|Among other factors, {{the growth}} of {{low-cost}} airline flights to Bratislava, led by Ryanair, has led to conspicuous stag parties, primarily from the UK. While these are a boom to the city's tourism industry, cultural differences and <b>vandalism</b> have led to concern by local officials. Reflecting the popularity of rowdy parties in Bratislava {{in the early to}} mid-2000s, the city was a setting in the 2004 comedy film Eurotrip, which was actually filmed in the city and suburbs of Prague, the Czech Republic.|$|E
5|$|Anarchist writer Bob Black, {{a former}} member, has criticized the Church, {{alleging that the}} group {{has come to be}} {{characterized}} by conformism and submission to authority. He believes that although it initially served to satirize cults, it later took on some of their aspects. In 1992, allegations of cult-like behavior also appeared in the newspaper Bedfordshire on Sunday after a spate of SubGenius-themed <b>vandalism</b> struck the English town of Bedford.|$|E
5|$|At Springfield Elementary School, Bart is busted for <b>vandalism</b> by Principal Skinner, who {{has been}} {{informed}} by class genius Martin Prince. Faced {{with the prospect of}} failing an intelligence test, Bart surreptitiously switches exams with Martin. When the school psychologist, Dr. Pryor, studies the results, he identifies Bart as a genius, to the delight of Homer and Marge, who enroll him in a new school. However, Lisa is not fooled by his supposed genius and still believes Bart to be a moron; Skinner shares her belief, but takes advantage of Bart's departure from the school.|$|E
5|$|But {{in recent}} years, many {{businessmen}} have shifted their operations {{away from the}} town centre to other suburbs due to a large presence of illegal immigrants from Mindanao islands in the Philippines which has caused trouble, mostly crime such as theft and <b>vandalism</b> on public facility and also solid waste pollution in marine and coastal areas. But later in January 2003, an urban renewal project, was launched to revive the town centre as a commercial hub in Sandakan and since 2013, the Government of Malaysia has launched a major crackdown on illegal immigrants.|$|E
5|$|Cemeteries, {{including}} those of war dead, are targets for <b>vandalism.</b> The gravestones, cemeteries and buildings of the Commission are no exception. The Commission believes that graffiti and damage to stonework are usually the work of young people, noting the number of incidents increases when schoolchildren are on school holidays. Metal theft is also a problem: determined thieves target the bronze swords from the Cross of Sacrifice, which are now replaced with replicas made of fibreglass.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{widespread}} <b>vandalism</b> and violence, only twenty arrests {{were made on}} the day. The strikers intimidated the police, {{and only a few}} were willing to arrest vandals. Chief Hyland and many officers were sympathetic to the strike, but the local judicial magistrates were not. According to one union report, union members who were arrested faced fines up to $50, while the arrested strikebreakers were immediately acquitted by a local judge.|$|E
5|$|Ernest C. Wong of Site Design Group {{designed}} the park. Having designed landscape along Chinatown's Cermak Avenue, Wong {{was familiar with}} the community and invited the public to voice their opinions and ideas for the future park. The park's original design called for walled plazas inspired by traditional Chinese gardens in Suzhou, China. This design was scrapped, however, because of security and <b>vandalism</b> concerns. Instead, a system of pathways was created to link defined spaces and mimic courtyards.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the most}} serious {{deliberate}} damage happened during the night of 12/13 May 2014, when the tallest trunk was sawn off at its base with a chainsaw, by unknown perpetrators. Following the <b>vandalism,</b> the severed trunk was stored, and it was eventually decided to re-attach it with artificial supports, several steel straps connecting the trunk to the base; this work {{was carried out in}} early July 2015 at a cost of €35,000, shared by the Catalan government and the Barcelona provincial administration.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to proximity and competitiveness, the rivalry {{was fueled by}} controversial incidents {{both on and off}} the field. Maryland supporters long held that Navy players used unnecessary roughness during play, a charge counter-accused by the Academy after the 1963 game. Some Midshipmen would travel to College Park to meet female students, which served to aggravate the ill feelings. Pranks and <b>vandalism</b> were commonplace on both campuses and exacerbated the already tense situation between Maryland and Navy.|$|E
5|$|Ministers of {{the church}} {{reported}} that {{the site of a}} newly constructed temple in Silao was subject to harassment of its members, <b>vandalism,</b> and physical threats because of religious intolerance, which caused them to request increased police protection. In February 2012, seventy ministers of La Luz del Mundo from different nations appeared before Mexican authorities in Guadalajara to denounce the lack of police protection for the church's residents in the city after a series of attacks left several members hospitalized.|$|E
5|$|On June 8, 1999, a {{tractor-trailer}} {{carrying a}} backhoe that exceeded the maximum height requirement struck a pedestrian footbridge over the Baltimore Beltway just {{northwest of the}} I-95 junction near Arbutus. The footbridge collapsed onto the inner loop of the Beltway. One driver was killed when his SUV struck the collapsed bridge; six others were injured, three critically. The incident occurred during the afternoon rush hour. The footbridge had been closed to pedestrians since November 1996 due to complaints about <b>vandalism</b> and crime.|$|E
5|$|SBASE, {{along with}} the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Police, have adopted a zero {{tolerance}} policy on graffiti in the Buenos Aires Underground, imposing fines ranging from AR$400–6000 and up to 30 days community service, the culprits often being made to clean the cars they vandalised. Increased vigilance from over 500 police officers, as well as close to 300 CCTV cameras, have aided in decreasing new acts of <b>vandalism</b> by 85% in 2014, with a further decrease of 50% in 2015 after security was intensified.|$|E
5|$|Service was {{introduced}} on 11 June 2006, with a contract lasting ten years. Along {{with the change}} of operator and stock, the Norwegian National Rail Administration, who owns the stations and tracks, did an overhaul of maintenance {{on many of the}} stations, in particular removing years of <b>vandalism.</b> In August, the company did a minor upgrade to the trains. The quiet sections were doubled from one to two sections, and new window shades for NOK 650,000 were purchased. By August, the ridership on the Gjøvik Line had increased by 8%, compared to the previous year.|$|E
5|$|The Tunnel Railway reopened for the 1946 {{season as}} usual. The {{illuminated}} tableaux {{had been removed}} during the war but were replaced, but this time they were illuminated by floodlights fitted {{to the sides of}} the trains rather than being self illuminated. The line {{was not included in the}} 1948 nationalisation of the railways and so remained in the hands of Ramsgate Olympia (later Pleasurama). The tableaux were removed around 1955 due to increasing <b>vandalism,</b> and the station signage changed from World Scenic Railway to Tunnel Railway.|$|E
5|$|The bank {{building}} was bought in 1944 by D. L. King of Rogers, who remodeled it {{and made it}} home to his Atlas Manufacturing Company which produced poultry equipment. However, King moved the business back to Rogers the next year. The building then stood idle, becoming victim to <b>vandalism.</b> All of its windows were smashed and it became covered in graffiti. Eventually, it {{was nothing more than}} an empty, roofless, concrete shell.|$|E
5|$|The {{monument}} underwent {{an extensive}} restoration project between 1998 and 2001. During {{this time it}} was completely covered in scaffolding designed by the American architect Michael Graves (who was also responsible for the interior changes). The project included cleaning, repairing and repointing the monument's exterior and interior stonework. The stone in publicly accessible interior spaces was encased in glass to prevent <b>vandalism,</b> while new windows with narrower frames were installed (to increase the viewing space). New exhibits celebrating the life of George Washington, and the monument's place in history, were also added.|$|E
