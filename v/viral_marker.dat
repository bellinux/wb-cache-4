40|$|Viruses {{may very}} well be the most {{abundant}} biological entities on the planet. Yet neither metagenomic studies nor classical phage isolation techniques have shed much light on the identity of the hosts of most viruses. We used a microfluidic digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach to physically link single bacterial cells harvested from a natural environment with a <b>viral</b> <b>marker</b> gene. When we implemented this technique on the microbial community residing in the termite hindgut, we found genus-wide infection patterns displaying remarkable intragenus selectivity. <b>Viral</b> <b>marker</b> allelic diversity revealed restricted mixing of alleles between hosts, indicating limited lateral gene transfer of these alleles despite host proximity.

However, waterborne viral outbreaks have occurred in drinking water systems despite negative bacterial results. Using <b>viral</b> <b>markers</b> may therefore provide more accurate health risk assessment data. In this study, fecal, wastewater, stormwater, surface water (fresh and salt), groundwater, and drinking water samples were analyzed for the presence or concentration of traditional indicators, innovative indicators and <b>viral</b> <b>markers.</b> Samples were obtained in the United States, Italy, and Australia and results compared to those reported for studies conducted in Asia and South America as well. Indicators included total coliforms, Escherichia coli, enterococci, male-specific coliphages, somatic coliphages and microviradae. <b>Viral</b> <b>markers</b> included adenovirus, polyomavirus, and a potential new surrogate, Torque teno virus (TTV). TTV was more frequently found in wastewaters (38 - 100 %) and waters influenced by waste discharges (25 %) than in surface waters used as drinking water sources (5 %). TTV was also specific to human rather than animal feces. While TTV numbers were strongly correlated to other <b>viral</b> <b>markers</b> in wastewaters, suggesting its utility as a fecal contamination marker, data limitations and TTV presence in treated drinking waters demonstrates that {{additional research is needed}} on this potential viral indicator...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: A {{waterborne}} {{outbreak of}} viral hepatitis {{occurred in the}} old city of Hyderabad from March through August 2005. An {{attempt was made to}} study the outbreak clinically, serologically, and etiologically. Methods: Five hundred and forty-six clinically and biochemically documented cases were screened for the hepatotropic <b>viral</b> <b>markers,</b> hepatitis A, B, C, and E by the ELISA method. Their demographic characteristics and outcomes were analyzed. Point source contamination of the water supply with sewerage was identified. Result: Our data confirms hepatitis E as the major cause of the outbreak (78. 57 &#x 0025;). Occasionally, mixed infection of HEV-HAV (5. 31 &#x 0025;) or HEV-HBV (0. 91 &#x 0025;) was detected in the present series of acute viral hepatitis. Conclusions: HEV was confirmed as the major etiological agent in this outbreak that was transmitted by contaminated drinking water.

40|$|Despite advancements in the {{management}} of cirrhosis, the prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is on the rise [1]. The prevalence of HCC varies geographically and currently HCC is the fifth most common cancer representing almost 6 % of all newly diagnosed cancers globally [2].

40|$|Background: Chronic {{infection}} with hepatitis C virus (HCV) {{is a risk}} factor for liver diseases such as fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV genetic heterogeneity was hypothesized to be associated with severity of liver disease. However, no reliable <b>viral</b> <b>markers</b> predicting disease severity have been identified. Here, we report the utility of sequences from 3 HCV 1 b genomic regions, Core, NS 3 and NS 5 b, to identify <b>viral</b> genetic <b>markers</b> associated with fast and slow rate of fibrosis progression (RFP) among patients with and without liver transplantation (n = 42). Methods: A correlation-based feature selection (CFS) method was used to detect and identify RFP-relevant <b>viral</b> <b>markers.</b> Machine-learning techniques, linear projection (LP) and Bayesian Networks (BN), were used to assess and identify associations between the HCV sequences and RFP. Results: Both clustering of HCV sequences in LP graphs using physicochemical properties of nucleotides and BN analysis using polymorphic sites showed similarities among HCV variants sampled from patients with a similar RFP, while distinct HCV genetic properties were found associated with fast or slow RFP. Several RFP-relevant HCV sites were identified.

40|$|For insects, the {{prevalence}} of numerous vertically transmitted viruses can be high in their host populations. These viruses often have few, if any, pathological effects on their hosts, and consequently, many of them can remain unnoticed for long periods, despite their potential role {{in the evolution of}} the host phenotype. Some females of Leptopilina boulardi, a solitary parasitoid of Drosophila larvae, are infected by an inherited virus (LbFV) that manipulates the behavior of the wasp by increasing its tendency to lay eggs in a host that is already parasitized (superparasitism). This behavioral alteration allows horizontal transmission of the virus within superparasitized Drosophila larvae. Using suppressive subtractive hybridization with infected and uninfected lines, we identified one putative viral sequence. Based on this sequence, we developed a simple PCR test. We tested the correlation between the superparasitism phenotype and PCR amplification of the putative <b>viral</b> <b>marker</b> using several experimental conditions (including horizontal transfers) and several parasitoid geno...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{occurrence}} of tuberculosis (TB), {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV), and viral hepatitis infections in the same patient poses unique clinical and public health challenges, because medications to treat TB and HIV are hepatotoxic. We conducted an observational study to evaluate risk factors for HBsAg and/or anti-HCV reactivity and to assess differences in adverse events and TB treatment outcomes among HIV-infected TB patients. Methods Patients were evaluated at the beginning, during, {{and at the end}} of TB treatment. Blood samples were tested for aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin (BR), complete blood count, and CD 4 + T lymphocyte cell count. TB treatment outcomes were assessed at the end of TB treatment according to international guidelines. Results Of 769 enrolled patients, 752 (98 %) had serologic testing performed for viral hepatitis: 70 (9 %) were reactive for HBsAg, 237 (31 %) for anti-HCV, and 472 (63 %) non-reactive for both markers. At the beginning of TB treatment, 18 (26 %) patients with HBsAg reactivity had elevated liver function tests compared with 69 (15 %) patients non-reactive to any <b>viral</b> <b>marker</b> (p = 0. 02). At the end of TB treatment, 493 (64 %) were successfully treated. Factors independently associated with HBsAg reactivity included being a man who had sex with men (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2. 1; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 1 – 4. 3) and having low TB knowledge (AOR, 1. 8; CI, 1. 0 – 3. 0). Factors most strongly associated with anti-HCV reactivity were having injection drug use history (AOR, 12. 8; CI, 7. 0 – 23. 2) and living in Bangkok (AOR, 15. 8; CI, 9. 4 – 26. 5). The rate of clinical hepatitis and death during TB treatment was similar in patients HBsAg reactive, anti-HCV reactive, both HBsAg and anti-HCV reactive, and non-reactive to any <b>viral</b> <b>marker.</b> Conclusion Among HIV-infected TB patients living in Thailand, markers of viral hepatitis infection, particularly hepatitis C virus infection, were common and strongly associated with known behavioral risk factors.

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{understanding of}} trafficking pathways in mature oligodendrocytes {{is essential for}} addressing issues aimed at controlling (re) myelination by modulating myelin-directed transport. Previously, we have shown that <b>viral</b> <b>marker</b> proteins HA and VSV G, on reaching the apical and basolateral surfaces of polarized epithelial cells, respectively, are primarily transported to the plasma membrane and myelin sheet, respectively, in oligodendrocytes (OLGs). In the present study, we demonstrated that in OLGs basolateral sorting signals {{similar to those in}} epithelial cells may target proteins to the myelin sheet, emphasizing the basolateral- and apical-like nature of the myelin sheet and plasma membrane, respectively. Thus, substitution of essential amino acids reverses the direction of targeting of these proteins, whereas elimination of apical targeting of HA coincides with its dissipation from detergent-resistant microdomains. Furthermore, protein kinase C activation negatively regulated transport of the OLG resident transmembrane protein PLP to the myelin sheet, like that of VSV G as shown previously, but did not affect the localization of the membrane-associated myelin-specific proteins MBP and CNP These data imply that several distinctly regulated pathways operate in myelin sheet directed-transport that at least partly rely on a cognate basolateral sorting signal.

DESIGN: All HCWs who reported an occupational exposure to blood-borne infection joined the surveillance program. Both HCWs and patients were tested for <b>viral</b> <b>markers</b> (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg], antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen [anti-HBs], antibody to hepatitis B core antigen [anti-HBc], antibody to hepatitis C virus [anti-HCV], HCV RNA, and antibody to human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]) and had these markers plus transaminases assayed at 3, 6, and 12 months and then yearly thereafter. Moreover, a program of hepatitis B virus (HBV) prophylaxis was offered to those whose anti-HBs levels were less than 10 IU/mL. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred forty-five HCWs (156 women and 89 men) {{with a mean age of}} 37 (+/- 10) years who reported occupational exposure during the 5 -year period. RESULTS: At the time of exposure, 1 HCW was positive for HBsAg (0. 4 %) and 2 were positive for HCV RNA (0. 8 %).

A cross-sectional study on the level of transaminases as a representation of liver damage in drug users was done in privated hospital in Jakarta. Exclusion criteria were fever, serious illness or the multiple use of addictive drugs based on a urinary test. The hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was examined using reverse passive hemaglutination assay (RPHA) and the antibody of hepatitis C virus core-protein (anti- HCV) with dipstick anti-HCV.

40|$|Summary Membrane {{cofactor}} protein (MCP, CD 46) {{is one of}} the complement regulatory proteins, and {{is widely}} distributed in human organs and protects cells from complement-mediated cytotoxicity. We analysed the distribution and the intensities of MCP in liver diseases and evaluated the role of MCP during hepatocarcinogenesis. Western blot analysis revealed that relative densities (density of the sample/density of the standard sample) of MCP in 27 HCC, 18 liver cirrhosis, nine chronic hepatitis and 12 normal liver were 0. 63 ± 0. 23, 0. 21 ± 0. 07, 0. 25 ± 0. 10 and 0. 11 ± 0. 03 (mean ± s. d.) respectively. MCP expression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was significantly higher than that in both liver cirrhosis and chronic hepatitis (P < 0. 01). The difference in the tumour sizes, the grades of differentiation and <b>viral</b> <b>marker</b> status did not affect the expression. Immunohistological analysis revealed that MCP was distributed mainly in the basolateral membrane of the hepatic cord in non-cancerous liver, along with endothelial cells and bile duct cells. In HCC, the protein was observed on the membrane in a non-polarized fashion. These data suggest that HCC cells acquire the increased MCP expression in a development of HCC and may escape from tumour-specific complement-mediated cytotoxicity...|$|E
40|$|Hepatitis B <b>viral</b> <b>markers</b> may {{be useful}} for {{predicting}} outcomes such as liver-related deaths or development of hepatocellular carcinoma. We determined the frequency of these markers in different clinical stages of chronic hepatitis B infection. We compared baseline hepatitis B <b>viral</b> <b>markers</b> in 317 patients who were enrolled in a prospective study and identified the frequency of these tests in immune-tolerant (IT) patients, in inactive carriers, and in patients with either hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) -positive or HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis. IT patients were youngest (median age 27  years) and HBeAg-negative patients with cirrhosis were oldest (median age 58  years) (p =  0. 03 to < 0. 0001). The male to female ratio was similar both in IT patients and in inactive carriers, {{but there was a}} male preponderance both in patients with chronic hepatitis and in patients with cirrhosis (p <  0. 0001). The A 1896 precore mutants were most prevalent in inactive carriers (36. 4 %) and HBeAg-negative patients with chronic hepatitis (38. 8 %; p <  0. 0001), and the T 1762 /A 1764 basal core promoter mutants were most often detected in HBeAg-negative patients with cirrhosis (65. 1 %; p =  0. 02). Genotype A was detected only in 5. 3 % of IT patients, and genotype B was least often detected in both HBeAg-Positive patients with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis (p =  0. 03). The hepatitis B viral DNA levels were lowest in inactive carriers (2. 69  log 10  IU/mL) and highest in IT patients (6. 80  log 10  IU/mL; p =  0. 02 to < 0. 0001). At follow-up, HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients with cirrhosis accounted for 57 of 64 (89. 1 %) liver-related deaths (p <  0. 0001). Differences in baseline hepatitis B <b>viral</b> <b>markers</b> were detected in patients in various clinical stages of hepatitis B virus infection. HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients with cirrhosis accounted {{for the majority of the}} liver-related fatalities...|$|R
40|$|A 57 {{year old}} female {{presented}} with generalized erythematous scay plaques of 11 / 2 months duration and jaundice since 1 month. She was on leflunomide since 3 months for chronic rheumatoid arthritis. Investigations revealed positive ANA, rheumatoid factor and negative anti-DsDNA. Bilirubin and liver enzymes were markedly raised. <b>Viral</b> <b>markers</b> were negative. Direct immunoflourescence {{did not show}} lupus band. A diagnosis of drug induced hepatitis and skin rash was made. She was treated with cholestyramine but she died after ten days of hospitalization...|$|R
40|$|Polymyositis as a paraneoplastic {{syndrome}} associated with hepatocellular carcinoma is quite rare; {{only a few}} cases have been reported. We report {{a case of a}} 50 -year-old female who presented with subacute quadriparesis, neck muscle weakness, elevated creatinine phosphokinase, a myogenic pattern on the EMG and was diagnosed as having polymyositis, a {{paraneoplastic syndrome}} associated with hepatocellular carcinoma with negative hepatic <b>viral</b> <b>markers</b> and a positive ANA. Improvement in patient symptoms and areduction in creatinine phosphokinase, which occurred after lobectomy, supports this rare association...|$|R
