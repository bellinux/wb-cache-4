50|$|Pachyosteosclerosis is a {{combination}} of thickening (pachyostosis) and densification (osteosclerosis) of bones. It makes bones more heavy, but also more fragile. The condition often occurs in aquatic vertebrates, especially those living in shallow waters, creating ballast as an adaptation for maintaining neutral buoyancy and horizontal trim. It is in no way pathological. To resist roll, it frequently is found especially in <b>ventral</b> <b>bones,</b> whereas concentration near the lungs helps in maintaining trim.Examples of animals showing pachyosteosclerosis are seacows (dugongs and manatees), the extinct Plesiosauria and Mesosauria and extinct aquatic sloths.|$|E

40|$|Priscochelys hegnabrunnensis, a fragmentary {{piece of}} armour shell from the Muschelkalk of Germany (Upper Triassic) with few {{diagnostic}} morphological features, was recently proposed {{to represent the}} oldest known stem turtle. As such, the specimen is of high importance because it shifts {{the date of the}} first appearance of turtles back about 20 Ma, which equals about 10 % of the total stratigraphic range of the group. In this paper, I present new morphologic, histologic and neutron tomographic (NT) data that relate to the microstructure of the bone of the specimen itself. In opposition to the previous morphologic descriptions, P. hegnabrunnensis was found to share several distinctive features (i. e. bone sutures congruent with scute sulci, absence of a diploe structure with interior cancellous bone, thin vascular canals radiating outwards from distinct centres in each field and rugose <b>ventral</b> <b>bone</b> surface texture consisting of mineralised fibre bundles) with cyamodontoid placodonts (Diapsida: Sauropterygia) and fewer with stem turtles (i. e. depth of sulci). Two aspects that were previously thought to be relevant for the assignment to the turtle stem (conical scutes and presence of foramina) are argued to be of dubious value. P. hegnabrunnensis is proposed to represent a fragmentary piece of cyamodontoid armour consisting of fused conical plates herein. The specimen is {{not a part of the}} turtle stem and thus does not represent the oldest turtle. Accordingly, P. hegnabrunnensis does not shorten the ghost lineage to the potential sister group of turtles...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{hypothesis}} uniting Acipenser stellatus and Pseudoscaphirhynchus as sister {{groups has}} recently been proposed based on analysis of DNA sequences. In this paper I compare specimens of A. stellatus and P. kaufmanni, and show that they share several putatively derived similarities {{in the structure of}} their skulls, including: the presence of large spines on the dermal bones of skull; lateral extrascapular bones that enclose the confluence of the posttemporal, supratemporal, and otic sensory canals; elongate dorsal rostral bones; border rostral bones distinct in shape from dorsal rostral bones; greatly enlarged jugal that lacks a median flange; rostral canal bones that loop posteriorly at the anterior commissure of the rostral sensory canals; and the presence of an elongate, flat, and broad posterior <b>ventral</b> rostral <b>bone.</b> These similarities support a close relationship between A. stellatus and Pseudoscaphirhynchus, but still remain to be critically tested...|$|R

40|$|Bella", a {{four year}} old intact female English Bulldog {{presented}} to the Neurology Service at the Cornell University Hospital for Animals with severe acute onset back pain and difficulty walking. Neurologic examination revealed pain in the thoracolumbar spine and decreased proprioception in the pelvic limbs. On survey radiography, no obvious lesions were detected. However, several vertebral malformations {{were present in the}} spine. MRI was performed and revealed prominent contrast enhancement surrounding thoracic vertebrae 5 - 6. The presumptive diagnosis was diskospondylitis with focal cellulitis and meningitis. Historically, survey radiography is established as a cornerstone for imaging of vertebral lesions. Spinal radiographs typically reveal characteristic lesions such as: lysis of vertebral endplates adjacent to the affected disk, collapse of the intervertebral disk space, varying degrees of endplate sclerosis, and <b>ventral</b> new <b>bone</b> formation. However, these lesions may not be detectable until 3 - 4 weeks post-infection. This report will include a case summary and discussion of canine vertebral infections.

50|$|The neural tube {{patterns}} {{along the}} dorsal-ventral axis to establish defined compartments of neural progenitor cells {{that lead to}} distinct classes of neurons. This patterning occurs early in development and results from the activity of several secreted signaling molecules. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is {{a key player in}} patterning the <b>ventral</b> axis, while <b>bone</b> morphogenic proteins (BMPs) and Wnt family members {{play an important role in}} patterning the dorsal axis. Other factors shown to provide positional information to the neural progenitor cells include fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and retinoic acid. Retinoic acid is required ventrally along with Shh to induce Pax6 and Olig2 during differentiation of motor neurons.|$|R
40|$|Limb {{elements}} in birds have been characterized as exhibiting {{a reduction in}} trabecular bone, thinner cortices and decreased bending strength when pneumatized, yet it is unclear if these characteristics generalize to the axial skeleton. Thin section techniques, the traditional gold standard for bone structure studies, have most commonly been applied {{to the study of}} avian bone. This destructive technique, however, makes it subsequently impossible to use the same samples in experimental testing systems that allow researchers to correlate structure with the mechanical properties of the bone. Micro-computed tomography (µCT), a non-destructive X-ray imaging technique, can be used to assess the effect of pneumatization on vertebral cortical and trabecular bone through virtual extraction and structural quantification of each tissue type. We conducted a preliminary investigation of the application of µCT methods to the study of cortical and trabecular bone structure in a small sample of pneumatic and apneumatic thoracic vertebrae. The sample consisted of two similar-sized anatids, Aix sponsa (n = 7) and Oxyura jamaicensis (n = 5). Volumes of interest were created that contoured (outlined) the boundaries of the <b>ventral</b> cortical <b>bone</b> shell, the trabecular compartment and the whole centrum (cortical bone + trabecular bone), and allowed independent structural analysis of each volume of interest. Results indicated that bone volume fraction of the whole centrum was significantly higher in the apneumatic O. jamaicensis than in the pneumatized A. sponsa (A. sponsa = 36 %, O. jamaicensis = 48 %, P < 0. 05). In contrast, trabecular bone volume fraction was similar between the two species. The <b>ventral</b> cortical <b>bone</b> shell was approximately 23 % thinner (P < 0. 05) in A. sponsa (0. 133 mm) compared with apneumatic O. jamaicensis (0. 172 mm). This case study demonstrates that µCT is a powerful non-destructive imaging technique that may be applied to the three-dimensional study of avian bone. The preliminary results suggest that pneumatic and apneumatic vertebrae of comparably sized avian species differ in relative bone volume, with the largest difference apparent {{at the level of the}} cortex, and not within trabecular bone. The presence of relatively thin cortices in pneumatic vertebrae is consistent with previous studies contrasting diaphyseal cortical bone between pneumatic and apneumatic long bones. Methodological issues related to this and any comparative µCT study of bone structure are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Aspiration of equine sternal {{bone marrow}} is {{required}} for the cultivation of bone marrow-derived multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) for regenerative therapies. For bone marrow aspiration as well as for MSC cultivation, {{there is a need to}} optimize techniques and protocols to enhance MSC harvest at minimized culture times. In a comparative study bone marrow aspirates from sternebra 4 and 5 were collected at two different positions within the sternebrae, either from 10  mm or from 30  mm dorsal from the ventral margin of the sternebrae. Accuracy of the puncture depth was confirmed by ultrasonography and computed tomography. Isolated MSCs were cultivated using media supplemented with three alternative sera, i. e. fetal calf serum, standardized horse serum and autologous serum. Due to morphological characteristics (spherical shape, only thin layer of hyaline cartilage at the <b>ventral</b> site, reliable <b>bone</b> marrow aspiration from only 10  mm intraosseous depth), sternebra 5 appeared most suitable for bone marrow aspiration.

40|$|Background: The retrosigmoid {{approach}} is a common route to the cerebellopontine angle and lateral clivus. Patient&#x 2032;s head positioning just before the operation is crucial to perform the procedure effectively and safely. Aim : The aim {{of the study is}} to determine the positional angle of the head on preoperative axial sequences of the cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Materials and Methods : The angle between the line drawn along the petrous <b>bone</b> <b>ventral</b> to the internal auditory canal and the line drawn parallel to the dorsal face of the clivus on the axial view of MRI sequences was measured. Results : This method of patient positioning has resulted in minimal cerebellar retraction, less time in the preoperative preparation period and less postoperative headache and neck pain. Conclusions : This method can provide quick and better exposure of the cerebellopontine angle. Preoperative measurement of positional angle on axial MRI sequences is a very simple and sufficient way to determine the angle of the head that is turned to the contralateral side...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} prospectively the randomised, long-term, clinical and radiological {{results of the}} treatment of spondylitis patients by ventro-dorsal or ventral spine fusion. Group  1 consisted of 12 patients who (after ventral removal of the focus of infection and autologous bone grafting) were treated by dorsal instrumentation. Group  2 consisted of ten patients who, after similar <b>ventral</b> removal and <b>bone</b> interposition, were stabilised by ventral instrumentation. The patients prospectively underwent clinical and radiological studies. In addition, {{they were asked to}} fill in self-assessment questionnaires such as the short-form (SF) - 36 health survey, the Oswestry questionnaire, and the visual analog scales (VAS). The postoperative follow-ups were at 6  months, 2  years and 5. 4  years. It proved possible to demonstrate clinically that patients with an isolated ventral spondylodesis feel significantly better and experience significantly less pain in the area of spinal fusion than patients with ventro-dorsal fusion 2 and 5. 4  years after the operation. Over a number of years a stable fusion can be achieved through either operation. Ventral stabilisation yields more advantages than dorsal instrumentation in the long term. These advantages result in a clinically smoother course after the operation. If, in the individual case, ventral instrumentation is feasible, this method should be used...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Cervical {{vertebral}} (C) malformation {{is rarely}} reported in large breed dogs. Congenital cervical kyphosis (CCK) {{may result from}} defects of vertebral segmentation, failure of formation or both. This report describes two cases of C 3 -C 4 CCK in young sighthounds, treated surgically. Case description: An 18 -month-old female Deerhound and a six-week-old female Borzoi dog were presented because of the complaints of reluctance to exercise and signs of of neck pain. Both dogs were neurologically normal. Diagnostic imaging revealed C 3 -C 4 deformity, moderate kyphosis, and spinal canal stenosis associated with chronic spinal cord pressure atrophy. Both dogs underwent surgical treatment. Results: A staged two-step surgery starting with dorsal decompression was elected in the Deerhound. After the first surgical procedure, the dog developed focal myelomalacia and phrenic nerve paralysis and was euthanatized. A ventral distraction-fusion technique with two locking plates was performed in the Borzoi. This patient recovered uneventfully and long-term follow-up computed tomography revealed complete spondylodesis. Clinical significance: Until now, CCK has only been described in sighthounds. Congenital cervical kyphosis might be considered a differential diagnosis in these breeds that are presented with signs of cervical pain. <b>Ventral</b> realignment-fusion and <b>bone</b> grafting may be considered for surgical treatment, although the earliest age at which this procedure {{can and should be}} performed remains unclear...|$|R
