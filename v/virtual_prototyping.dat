To accelerate post-silicon validation, high-quality tests should be ready before the first silicon prototype becomes available.

40|$|Post-silicon {{validation}} {{has become}} a critical stage in the system-on-chip (SoC) development cycle, driven by increasing design complexity, higher level of integration and decreasing time-to-market. According to recent reports, post-silicon validation effort comprises more than 50 % of the overall development effort of an 65 nm SoC. Though post-silicon validation covers many aspects ranging from electronic properties of hardware to performance and power consumption of whole systems, a central task remains validating functional correctness of both hardware and its integration with software. There are several key challenges to achieving accelerated and low-cost post-silicon functional validation. First, there is only limited silicon observability and controllability; second, {{there is no good}} test coverage estimation over a silicon device; third, it is difficult to generate good post-silicon tests before a silicon device is available; fourth, there is no effective software robustness testing approaches to ensure the quality of hardware/software integration. We propose a systematic approach to accelerating post-silicon functional validation with <b>virtual</b> <b>prototypes.</b> Post-silicon test coverage is estimated in the pre-silicon stage by evaluating the test cases on the <b>virtual</b> <b>prototypes.</b> Such analysis is first conducted on the initial test suite assembled by the user and subsequently on the expanded test suite which includes test cases that are automatically generated. Based on the coverage statistics of the initial test suite on the <b>virtual</b> <b>prototypes,</b> test cases are automatically generated to improve the test coverage. In the post-silicon stage, our approach supports coverage evaluation of test cases on silicon devices to ensure fidelity of early coverage evaluation. The generated test cases are issued to silicon devices to detect inconsistencies between <b>virtual</b> <b>prototypes</b> and silicon devices using conformance checking. We further extend the test case generation framework to generate and inject fault scenario with <b>virtual</b> <b>prototypes</b> for driver robustness testing. Besides virtual prototype-based fault injection, an automatic driver fault injection approach is developed to support runtime fault generation and injection for driver robustness testing. Since <b>virtual</b> <b>prototype</b> enables early driver development, our automatic driver fault injection approach can be applied to driver testing in both pre-silicon and post-silicon stages. For preliminary evaluation, we have applied our coverage evaluation and test generation to several network adapters and their <b>virtual</b> <b>prototypes.</b> We have conducted coverage analysis for a suite of common tests on both the <b>virtual</b> <b>prototypes</b> and silicon devices. The results show that our approach can estimate the test coverage with high fidelity. Based on the coverage estimation, we have employed our automatic test generation approach to generate additional tests. When the generated test cases were issued to both <b>virtual</b> <b>prototypes</b> and silicon devices, we observed significant coverage improvement. And we detected 20 inconsistencies between <b>virtual</b> <b>prototypes</b> and silicon devices, each of which reveals a <b>virtual</b> <b>prototype</b> or silicon device defect. After we applied virtual prototype-based fault injection approach to <b>virtual</b> <b>prototypes</b> for three widely-used network adapters, we generated and injected thousands of fault scenarios and found 2 driver bugs. For automatic driver fault injection, we have applied our approach to 12 widely used drivers with either <b>virtual</b> <b>prototypes</b> or silicon devices. After testing all these drivers, we found 28 distinct bugs...|$|R

40|$|<b>Virtual</b> <b>prototypes</b> are {{increasingly}} used in device/driver co-development and co-validation to enable early driver development and reduce product time-to-market. However, drivers developed over <b>virtual</b> <b>prototypes</b> {{often do not}} work readily on silicon devices, since silicon devices often {{do not conform to}} <b>virtual</b> <b>prototypes.</b> Therefore, it is important to detect the inconsistences between silicon devices and <b>virtual</b> <b>prototypes.</b> We present an approach to post-silicon conformance checking of a hardware device with its <b>virtual</b> <b>prototype,</b> i. e., a virtual device. The conformance between the silicon and virtual devices is defined over their interface states. This approach symbolically executes the virtual device with the same driver request sequence to the silicon device, and checks if the interface states of the silicon and virtual devices are consistent. Inconsistencies detected indicate potential errors in either the silicon device or the virtual device. We have evaluated our approach on three network adapters and their virtual devices, and found 15 inconsistencies exposing 15 real bugs in total from the silicon and virtual devices. The results demonstrate that our approach is useful and efficient in facilitating device/driver covalidation at the post-silicon stage...|$|R
