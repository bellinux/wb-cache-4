These techniques are used interchangeably in AD research and thus far it is unclear which technique is superior in detecting abnormalities early in the disease process. 18 healthy participants without any memory impairment, 18 patients with MCI, and 17 patients with mild AD were included and between-group differences were investigated in AD signature regions (areas in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), medial temporal lobe (MTL) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC)). Both manual <b>volumetric</b> <b>measurements</b> and VBM were able to detect GM atrophy {{in the early stages}} (differentiation controls and MCI), mainly in the MTL. In the early phase, automated <b>volumetric</b> <b>measurements</b> showed GM differences in the PPC but not in the MTL. In our sample, CT measurements were not sensitive for group differences in the early stages. PFC regions showed abnormalities in the later stages (controls vs AD) when manual <b>volumetric</b> <b>measurements</b> or VBM are employed. Manual <b>volumetric</b> <b>measurements</b> together with VBM are preferred techniques for assessing GM differences showing abnormalities in most of the investigated regions, with a predominance of the MTL in the early phase. Automated FreeSurfer <b>volumetric</b> <b>measurements</b> show similar performances in the early phase, displaying group differences in the PPC but not in MTL regions.

40|$|Background and {{objective}} It {{has been proven}} that <b>volumetric</b> <b>measurements</b> could detect subtle changes in small pulmonary nodules in serial CT scans, and thus may {{play an important role}} in the follow-up of indeterminate pulmonary nodules and in differentiating malignant nodules from benign nodules. The current study aims to evaluate the effects of different reconstruction parameters on the <b>volumetric</b> <b>measurements</b> of pulmonary nodules in chest CT scans. Methods Thirty subjects who underwent chest CT scan because of indeterminate pulmonary nodules in General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University from December 2009 to August 2011 were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 52 pulmonary nodules were included, and all CT data were reconstructed using three reconstruction algorithms and three slice thicknesses. The <b>volumetric</b> <b>measurements</b> of the nodules were performed using the advanced lung analysis (ALA) software. The effects of the reconstruction algorithms, slice thicknesses, and nodule diameters on the <b>volumetric</b> <b>measurements</b> were assessed using the multivariate analysis of variance for repeated measures, the correlation analysis, and the Bland-Altman method. Results The reconstruction algorithms (F= 13. 6, P< 0. 001) and slice thicknesses (F= 4. 4, P= 0. 02) had significant effects on the measured volume of pulmonary nodules. In addition, the coefficients of variation of nine measurements were inversely related with nodule diameter (r=- 0. 814, P< 0. 001). The volume measured at the 2. 5 mm slice thickness had poor agreement with the volumes measured at 1. 25 mm and 0. 625 mm, respectively. Moreover, the best agreement was achieved between the slice thicknesses of 1. 25 mm and 0. 625 mm using the bone algorithm. Conclusion Reconstruction algorithms and slice thicknesses have significant impacts on the <b>volumetric</b> <b>measurements</b> of lung nodules, especially for the small nodules. Therefore, the reconstruction setting in serial CT scans should be consistent in the follow-up of indeterminate pulmonary nodules, more importantly for the small nodules...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. The {{aim of this}} Study was {{to assess}} the {{efficacy}} of a Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) system in the identification of lung metastases and to compare the <b>volumetric</b> CAD <b>measurements</b> with unidimensional observer measurements in the evaluation of treatment response in oncology patients. Materials and methods. Two observers (A and B) evaluated nine patients undergoing lung computed tomography (CT) just before and immediately after treatment with chemotherapy. Multislice CT scans were performed before and after the injection of contrast material with a high-resolution protocol (collimation 4 x 1 mill, 100 mAs. 120 kV). Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) criteria were used to consider the disease as stable, increased or decreased. Subsequently, target lesions (most significant lesions identified before and after chemotherapy) were evaluated with a computerised system (CAD) to establish <b>volumetric</b> <b>measurements.</b> Observers' unidimensional <b>measurements</b> and CAD <b>volumetric</b> <b>measurements</b> were analysed for comparison. Results. Twenty-four nodules (diameter: 5 - 18 mill in the first study and 4 - 20 mill in the follow-up study) were included. Observers agreed in the assessment of therapy response in 21 nodules: eight were considered to have increased in size, and 13 were judged stable. Observer and CAD measurements disagreed in three nodules: two were considered stable by radiologists and increased by CAD: one was considered increased by radiologists and stable by CAD. As regards patient response, radiologists disagreed in two cases. CAD and observers did not agree in one case. Conclusions. Our preliminary data Suggest that <b>volumetric</b> <b>measurements</b> can modify the diagnostic and therapeutic evaluation of oncology patients under chemotherapy.

Even though this pressure pulse is somewhat damped {{by the time it}} reaches the skin, it is enough to distend the arteries and arterioles in the subcutaneous tissue. If the pulse oximeter is attached without compressing the skin, a pressure pulse can also be seen from the venous plexus, as a small secondary peak.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Volumetric {{intravascular}} ultrasound (IVUS) assessment provides {{complementary information}} on atherosclerotic plaques. The volumes {{can be calculated}} by applying Simpson's rule to cross-sectional area data of multiple IVUS images, acquired with a fixed sample spacing, which is the distance (along the vessel's axis) between two images. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of different sample spacings {{on the results of}} <b>volumetric</b> IVUS <b>measurements.</b> METHODS: A stepwise electrocardiographically gated IVUS image-acquisition and automated three-dimensional analysis approach was applied to 26 patients. Twenty-eight coronary segments with mild-to-moderate coronary atherosclerosis were examined. <b>Volumetric</b> <b>measurements</b> of five images per mm (i. e. sample spacing 0. 2 mm), representing a complete scanning of the coronary segment, were considered the optimal standard, against which <b>volumetric</b> <b>measurements</b> of three, one, and one-half images per mm (i. e. larger sample spacings) were compared. RESULTS: The lumen, total vessel, and plaque volumes obtained with five images per mm were 183. 3 +/- 2. 8, 350. 6 +/- 141. 6, and 167. 3 +/- 89. 2 mm 3. There was an excellent correlation (r = 0. 99, P < 0. 001) between these data and <b>volumetric</b> <b>measurements</b> with larger sample spacings. The <b>volumetric</b> <b>measurements</b> with larger sample spacings differed on average only by a little (< 0. 7 %) from the optimal standard measurements. However, a relatively small, but significant, increase in SD of these differences was associated with the wider sample spacings (< 3. 6 %, P < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: The width of the sample spacing has a relatively small but significant impact on the variability of <b>volumetric</b> intravascular ultrasound <b>measurements.</b> This should be considered when designing future volumetric studies. The electrocardiographically gated acquisition of five IVUS images per mm axial length during a stepwise transducer pull-back is an ideal approach, particularly when addressing with IVUS volumetric changes that are assumed small, such as those expected in studies of the progression and regression of atherosclerosis...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} operator experience in <b>volumetric</b> <b>measurements</b> on intra- and inter-observer variability of lung volume estimation by 3 -dimensional (3 D) ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in fetuses with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). Methods: We conducted a retrospective single-center study. Total fetal lung volume (TFLV) was measured twice using 52 stored 3 D-ultrasound volumes and 52 corresponding MRI exams by a fetal medicine specialist with no experience in <b>volumetric</b> <b>measurements</b> and two operators experienced in the respective techniques. Bland-Altman analysis was performed to evaluate intra- and inter-observer variability. Results: Measurements of TFLV by 3 D-ultrasound showed higher intra-observer variability compared with MRI irrespective of operator experience, with narrower 95 % limits of agreement on MRI as compared with ultrasound measurements. Similarly, 3 D-ultrasound showed higher inter-observer variability as compared with MRI. Finally the 95 % limits of agreement at ultrasound were quite comparable for intra-observer variability between the experienced and the inexperienced operator. Conclusion: Our study shows that operator experience {{has an impact on}} the variability of TFLV and, in the absence of experience in <b>volumetric</b> <b>measurements,</b> estimation of TFLV in fetuses with CDH by 3 D-ultrasound shows higher variability than MRI measurements, but even in experienced hands variability is greater for 3 D-ultrasound.

5000|$|Pyrodex, {{and most}} other black powder substitutes, are {{formulated}} to be a volume-for-volume equivalent of black powder, not an equivalent mass-for-mass (weight-for-weight). Pyrodex is measured by <b>volumetric</b> <b>measurement</b> techniques, not in grains on a scale, due to the difference in density of Pyrodex versus black powder. For example, to measure a [...] "60 grain equivalent" [...] of Hodgdon's Pyrodex suitable {{for use in a}} muzzleloader rifle, one uses a volumetric measure that produces a volume of Pyrodex equal to the volume of a mass of 60 grains of black powder. Due to Pyrodex being less dense than black powder, a measurement by weight on a scale of 60 grains of mass of Pyrodex would be near a 30 percent overload.|$|E
50|$|A {{classical}} {{device for}} dew measurement is the drosometer. A small, artificial condenser surface is suspended from an arm {{attached to a}} pointer or a pen that records the weight changes of the condenser on a drum. Besides being very wind sensitive, however, this, like all artificial surface devices, only provides {{a measure of the}} meteorological potential for dew formation. The actual amount of dew in a specific place is strongly dependent on surface properties. For its measurement, plants, leaves, or whole soil columns are placed on a balance with their surface at the same height and in the same surroundings as would occur naturally, thus providing a small lysimeter. Further methods include estimation by means of comparing the droplets to standardized photographs, or <b>volumetric</b> <b>measurement</b> of the amount of water wiped from the surface. Some of these methods include guttation, while others only measure dewfall and/or distillation.|$|E
50|$|In cardiac physiology, preload is the {{end diastolic}} volume that {{stretches}} the right or left ventricle of the heart to its greatest dimensions under variable physiologic demand. In other words, it is the initial stretching of the cardiomyocytes prior to contraction; therefore, it {{is related to the}} sarcomere length at the end of diastole. Parameters such as ventricular end diastolic volume or pressure are used to measure preload since the ideal length of the cardiac sarcomere cannot be measured. Passive filling of the (heart) ventricle and subsequent atrial contraction thus allows an echocardiographically <b>volumetric</b> <b>measurement.</b> Preload is theoretically most accurately described as the initial stretching of a single cardiomyocyte prior to contraction. This cannot be measured in vivo and therefore other measurements are used as estimates. Estimation may be inaccurate, for example in a chronically dilated ventricle new sarcomeres may have formed in the heart muscle allowing the relaxed ventricle to appear enlarged. The term end-diastolic volume is better suited to the clinic, although not exactly equivalent to the strict definition of preload. Atrial pressure is a surrogate for preload.|$|E
