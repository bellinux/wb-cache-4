5|$|One of the {{above-mentioned}} exceptions was a 1986 {{release of the}} film for the now-obsolete VHD <b>video</b> <b>disc</b> system (not {{to be confused with}} LaserDisc). This required a special 3D VHD player, or a standard VHD player with a hardware 3D adapter, and a set of LCD glasses that shuttered the viewer's eyes according to control signals sent by the player, allowing the polarised 3D effect to work. The other exception was the Sensio 3D DVD of Jaws 3-D released in February 2008. The Sensio 3D Processor is needed for 3D home viewing.|$|E
5|$|Odex {{blamed the}} {{approximate}} 70% fall in its Video CD (VCD) and Digital <b>Video</b> <b>Disc</b> (DVD) sales in 2006 and 2007 on illegal downloading. The response of anime fans {{was that the}} fall in sales was because Odex's products were inferior, inaccurately translated, and released later than the online versions. Odex subsequently attributed the inaccurate subtitling on censorship laws against mature themes (such as yaoi) and on fansubbers—anime fans who had translated the Japanese dialogue—whom they had hired. In response, the Board of Film Censors said {{that it did not}} ask for subtitles to be changed, that it merely classified content, and that the onus was on distributors to ensure accurate subtitles. In addition to problems of quality and scheduling, criticisms were directed at Odex's litigious strategy and poor public relations. Odex received support from the Anti Video Piracy Association of Singapore (AVPAS) in making its demands for compensation.|$|E

500|$|Live Intrusion {{was filmed}} at the Mesa Amphitheatre in Mesa, Arizona, on March 12, 1995 while {{promoting}} Divine Intervention on tour. The Machine Head members Chris Kontos and Robb Flynn gave {{assistance to the}} band while performing [...] "Witching Hour", originally recorded by Venom in 1981. The video was released as a VHS (Video High Standard) through American Recordings on October 31, 1995. The video features live footage of Slayer and exclusive unseen footage of Slayer {{on and off the}} road. The beginning of the video features a portrait of some of Slayer fans, including a picture from the mid-1990s, about a fan, who had [...] "Slayer" [...] carved onto their forearm. It was directed and produced by Phil Tuckett, with the audio recorded by Sylvia Massy. On August 17, 2010, Live Intrusion was remastered and released as a DVD (Digital <b>Video</b> <b>Disc).</b> It was created using the original VHS master and edited the footage with newer technology. The DVD was sold at retail and online for (USD) $13.98. The DVD was also released in the Slayer Live DVD 3-Pak, also released on August 17, 2010. It was sold for (USD) $29.98.|$|E
500|$|Silver Star Story Complete was {{initially}} released in North America as a limited collector's edition which included two game discs, a hardbound instruction manual, a soundtrack CD, a [...] "Making of Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete" [...] special disc, and a cloth {{map of the}} Lunar world. The package retailed for $60.00 {{to cover the cost}} of the elaborate extras. Working Designs would also publish their own strategy guide for the game, also billed as a collector's item. [...] Ireland's team would add an easter egg to the [...] "Making of" [...] <b>video</b> <b>disc</b> in the form of a minigame based on Atari's arcade game Warlords called Lords of Lunar accessed by using a code found in-game. In February 2002, a special [...] "Fan-Art Edition" [...] of the game was released featuring disc artwork by contributors to the Working Designs website, which lacked the extras of the collector's edition. A Windows-based PC version of Silver Star Story was released in Japan in December 1999 by DigiCube featuring higher resolution graphics and video playback. Working Designs had expressed interest in bringing this version to North America in 2002, but claimed that the English version was too buggy and unstable to be released.|$|E
