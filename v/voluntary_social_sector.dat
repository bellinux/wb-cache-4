40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, {{there has been a}} growing {{interest}} in the voluntary organisations that play an important and innovative part {{in the development of the}} welfare societies in America (se Salamon 1995; 1997; Alexander, Nank and Stivers C. 1999; Reisch and Sommerfeld 2003), England (se Plowden 2003) and Scandinavian (se [...] ..). The states, in particular, has realised that a number of welfare tasks cannot be solved without establishing a close working relationship with the existing <b>voluntary</b> <b>social</b> <b>sector.</b> The added political interest has led to greater awareness of the structuralisation of voluntary organisations and their supply of services. At the same time, we know very little today about the practical functions of volunteers – what is it they do and know, and how may this possibly differ from what others do and know. We are also in need of studies to highlight the relationship between the practices of volunteers and the voluntary organisations which initially facilitated the development of such practices. The need for such information is growing in step with the ever-increasing demands placed on the practices of volunteers by society in general and politicians in particular. Using Niklas Luhmann’s theory of social systems as a springboard, this article will look at the state’s expectations for new and more integrated forms of cooperation with the voluntary organisations. These expectations are interesting precisely because the bodies that are seeking to cooperate have very different ways of organising the provision of social services. Using a specially selected area of user-cantered voluntary social services, the article will examine the unique aspects of voluntary work, as well as the unique way in which the voluntary organisations organise and manage this work. The article will argue that the voluntary work represent a interaction system, and that the organisation which instigates the voluntary social work neither has access to it, nor control over it. The article will therefore show that there is another, far more controversial side to voluntary social services than the state’s attempts to formulate a joint voluntary service policy. Voluntary organisations risk becoming embaressed. On the basis of this argument, the article will pinpoint a number of risks associated with the attempt to formalise cooperation between public and voluntary social services. What are the risks for the people towards whom these services are directed? What are the risks for the voluntary organisations? And what are the risks for the social policies of the welfare state, based as they are on the principle of universalism...|$|E
40|$|The study {{concentrates}} on voluntary organizations {{and participation in}} them. In particular voluntary sectors in Nordic societies are the point of interest. The study sets out to trace the varied discussions on voluntary organizations, third sector, and civil society. Based on a review of theoretical discussions, a general theory of voluntary organizations is developed. The theory includes social origins of voluntary organizations, their place and functions in the society, and explanation of participation in voluntary organizations. Special attention is directed to the dialectic relationship of voluntary organizations and social class. Also the interdependent relationship of voluntary organizations with the pub-lic sector receives due attention. Ordinary organization theory, what goes on inside the organizations, is {{to a large degree}} left outside discussion. This study has no independent empirical part. However, Nordic countries are used as a ´case´ for the testing of the theoretical discussion. Last chapter before conclusions presents some data on voluntary organization in the Nordic countries, which is then reflected on the general theory. Voluntary organizations can be approached from basically three perspectives: (1) as civil society, (2) as third sector, and (3) as general social activity. The approach on this study is mainly from the civil society and third sector perspectives. Important influences {{in the development of the}} theory con-cerning the civil society perspective have been Martti Siisiäinen and Norwegian researchers Per Selle, Stein Kuhnle and Kurt Klaudi Klausen. In the third sector perspective major influence has been the American initiated comparative international research project that is lead by Lester M. Salamon and Helmut K. Anheier. The project research in Finland is directed by Voitto Helander. The study starts with a definition of voluntary organizations and other related concepts such as social movements and the third sector. Voluntary organizations are defined as formal private organizations that do not aim at profit making and that are based on voluntary participation. The picture on voluntary sector that is outlined in the study is to a large degree positive. Voluntary organizations play several important social functions. First of all, they contribute to proper functioning and the stability of the democratic political system. They mediate between private interests and the political system. They also form an intermediate level between the individual and the society. By integrating people into the society they contribute to the general stability of the social system as a whole. Voluntary organizations are also an alternative to public sector and the markets. They produce collective goods and services that these for some reason are not able to provide or provide them in a unsatisfactory or insufficient manner. Still further, voluntary organizations are a central factor in the construction and reconstruction of social classifications, such as class. Participation in voluntary organizations is divided into active and passive participation. ´Passive participation´ equals passive membership. Voluntary participation is always an individual decision based on individual needs and interests but it is often affected by social and system level issues. Through socialization individuals acquire attitudes that are more or less favourable to participation, and social networks are a central channel through which individuals join organizations. On the other hand, system level structural differences and political traditions affect participation levels. Structural opportunities for participation vary significantly across social systems and across time. Nordic countries have some of the highest levels of memberships in voluntary organizations. The present day voluntary sector is rooted deeply in the social movements of nineteenth century. In addition what is common to Nordic voluntary sectors is that they have relatively low participation rates compared to high membership, their <b>voluntary</b> <b>social</b> <b>sector</b> is relatively weak, and voluntary organizations are closely affiliated with the state but have in any case retained relative autonomy. One important observation is that the position of voluntary organizations seems to be changing. The end of the industrial society, globalization, crisis of the welfare state, and the growing individual orientation all have affected the voluntary sector and continue to have effect in the future. It seems that voluntary organizations as formal organizations are loosing some of their centrality in democratic participation. On the other hand, their importance in recreation and general social activity has increased. It also seems likely that their role in welfare production is growing. At least they provide a potential alternative for the states struggling with costly welfare regimes. 1. INTRODUCTION 8 Research questions 11 Structure of the paper 11 2.

40|$|This {{case study}} explores the {{relationship}} between ideology {{and the performance of}} the <b>voluntary</b> <b>social</b> welfare <b>sector</b> in Western New York. Data were collected from the directors of 22 {{of the largest and most}} important <b>voluntary</b> <b>social</b> welfare agencies relating to their own social attitudes and those of their boards. The common expression of similar agency attitudes toward a variety of social policies were in narrow conformity with the conservative values of the current national administration. The common core of conservative values, suggesting that the agencies perform an ideological role within the community in addition to their service role, may explain much of their decision to ignore great and growing social needs.

40|$|This paper {{asserts that}} the <b>voluntary</b> or <b>social</b> <b>sector</b> plays {{a pivotal role in}} {{generating}} and disseminating social innovations through collaboration with diverse partners. The authors explore the potential to engender a quantum shift in the sector's efficiency, reach, and impact through the combined use of open source technologies, social process tools and collaboration platforms. The objective is to contribute to a new generation of intelligent social systems, enabling an evolutionary recalibration of relationships among ourselves, our social and economic institutions, and the planet. As a means of integrating and disseminating the most promising approaches, the concept of Applied Collaboration Studios is proposed. Its primary activities would be: i) dissemination of open source technologies; ii) ongoing instruction and coaching in the use of social process tools; iii) the assembly and launch of multiple collaboration platforms; and iv) collaboration with other like initiatives to create ecologies of scale that inform and precipitate systems change toward greater resilience.

40|$|There is {{a danger}} in {{discussion}} about social work that it becomes seen as a monolithic activity, one which is the monopoly of Local Authority <b>Social</b> Services Departments. <b>Voluntary</b> <b>sector</b> <b>social</b> work is, inevitably, a casualty of this view: overlooked within accepted definitions of social work and marginalised within the teaching and placement organisation of the DipSW curriculum. The Voluntary Sector Pathway, an option {{in the second year}} of the MA/DipSW course at the University of Nottingham, inverts this situation, promoting the longstanding and unique contribution of the <b>voluntary</b> <b>sector</b> to <b>social</b> work. <b>Voluntary</b> <b>sector</b> placements provide the culmination of a learning experience which places the sector at its heart.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} an {{analysis}} of the political initiative ”National Civilsamfundsstrategi” (National Strategy for Civil Society) of 2010. The analysis also brings in reports drawn up by various actors within the field of <b>voluntary</b> <b>social</b> work upon which ”National Civilsamfundsstrategi” leans. The thesis is concerned with the area of policy which is why the emphasis is on document analysis. The theoretical framework of the thesis is built up around Michel Foucault. More specifically, his “theory of governmentality” is used to put the <b>voluntary</b> <b>social</b> work into a special perspective regarding power, through which the focus is on power relations of the <b>voluntary</b> <b>social</b> work where discourses and categories are put into speech. The analysis is done on the basis of Carol Bacchi’s WPR-method (What’s the Problem Represented to be) backed by Kaspar Villadsen and his take on genealogical analysis of the social work and emphasises representations of problems in “Civilsamfundsstrategien” as well as the underlying assumptions embedded in these “problems”. Through the analysis, the actors appearing in the present political initiatives regarding <b>voluntary</b> <b>social</b> work are highlighted. They are juxtaposed in order to pinpoint the underlying elements of the universal categories of “the volunteer” and “the socially exposed” to obtain an understanding about what these categories imply. By dismantling these groupings, the categories perceived as universal within the field of <b>voluntary</b> <b>social</b> work are questioned and rather left as constructions created by history.

40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to investigate the}} interaction of school and community through a comparative study of second-level schools in Cork City and County. The Education Act 1998 sets the framework {{for the development of}} education as a partnership process involving pupils, teachers, parents, patrons, trustees/owners/governors, management bodies, local community (including <b>voluntary</b> <b>social</b> and business <b>sector)</b> and the state. The challenge is building partnership networks beyond the school where mutual interdependence is fostered and partnerships are inclusive of all persons in the dynamics of the interaction. The international perspective focuses on flexible learning styles and programmes which enable schools to connect more effectively with the wider diverse community of today. The study also follows the creative and innovative thinking on the developing interface between the school and changing society in Ireland. The focus here is on the school in the local community from inception to the present day. An in-depth questionnaire was designed with the specific aim of examining if schools were interacting with their community. This was distributed to second-level schools. Follow-up interviews were conducted among five representatives of the major stakeholders in the education process. The questionnaires elicited definite wide-ranging information and the interviews provided further clarification on issues pertinent to the study. The thesis concludes that the community/partnership dimension of education has gained much ground up to the present day although there are varying levels of interaction across the different sectors. The study also highlights the factors that either enhance or hinder the formation of meaningful strong proactive relationships and partnerships in the local community.
