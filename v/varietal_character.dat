40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of different Saccharomyces cerevisiae wine yeast strains on the concentration of aroma-enhancing volatile thiols and fermentation metabolites in Sauvignon Blanc wine. Seven commercial wine yeast strains were selected based on their putative ability to modulate the concentrations of the fruity volatile thiols, 4 -mercapto- 4 -methylpentan- 2 -one (4 MMP), 3 -mercapto-hexanol (3 MH) and 3 -mercapto-hexylacetate (3 MHA). Each of these yeasts was used to produce Sauvignon Blanc wines under controlled conditions, in triplicate, in 20 -L quantities. The levels of 4 MMP, 3 MH and 3 MHA in these wines were quantified using the p-hydroxymercuribenzoate method. In addition, a total of 24 volatile yeast-derived fermentation aroma compounds were also quantified using headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography mass spectrometry (HS-SPME–GC–MS). Formal sensory analysis was conducted by 12 trained assessors and, additionally, a panel of 24 experienced wine industry professionals assessed the wines and ranked them in order of preference. The results indicated that the yeast strains varied significantly in terms of their capabilities to (i) produce volatile thiols and fermentation metabolites; and (ii) to modulate the <b>varietal</b> <b>characters</b> of Sauvignon Blanc wine. Yeast strains that produced the highest levels of volatile thiols were responsible for wines with the highest perceived intensity of fruitiness, and these wines were preferred by the tasting panels. While the ‘green’ characters in Sauvignon Blanc wines can be manipulated through vineyard management, the ‘tropical fruity’ characters appear to be largely dependent on the wine yeast strain used during fermentation. Therefore, the choice of yeast strain offers great potential to modulate wine aroma profiles to definable styles and predetermined consumer market specifications. Jan H. Swiegers, Robyn L.

"Mr. Murray has {{combined}} with a careful examination of the soundings a constant use of the tow-net, usually at the surface, but also at depths of from ten to one hundred fathoms; and he finds the closest relation to exist between the surface fauna of any particular locality and the deposit which is taking place at the bottom. In all seas, from the equator to the polar ice, the tow-net contains Globigerinoe. They are more abundant and of a larger size in warmer seas; several varieties, attaining a large size and presenting marked <b>varietal</b> <b>characters,</b> {{are found in the}} intertropical area of the Atlantic. In the latitude of Kerguelen they are less numerous and smaller, while further south they are still more dwarfed, and only one variety, the typical Globigerina bulloides, is represented. The living Globigerinoe from the tow-net are singularly different in appearance from the dead shells we find at the bottom. The shell is clear and transparent, and each of the pores which penetrate it is surrounded by a raised crest, the crest round adjacent pores coalescing into a roughly hexagonal network, so that the pores appear to lie {{at the bottom of a}} hexagonal pit. At each angle of this hexagon the crest gives off a delicate flexible calcareous spine, which is sometimes four or five times the diameter of the shell in length. The spines radiate symmetrically from the direction of the centre of each chamber of the shell, and the sheaves of long transparent needles crossing one another in different directions have a very beautiful effect. The smaller inner chambers of the shell are entirely filled with an orange-yellow granular sarcode; and the large terminal chamber usually contains only a small irregular mass, or two or three small masses run together, of the same yellow sarcode stuck against one side, the remainder of the chamber being empty. No definite arrangement and no approach to structure was observed in the sarcode, and no differentiation, with the exception of round bright-yellow oil-globules, very much like those found in some of the radiolarians, which are scattered, apparently irregularly, in the sarcode. We never have been able to detect, in any of the large number of Globigerinoe which we have examined, the least trace of pseudopodia, or any extension, in any form, of the sarcode beyond the shell.|$|R
40|$|Atypical aging (ATA) is {{a flavor}} defect in white wines, {{particularly}} {{but not limited}} to aromatic whites, where wine loses its varietal flavors very rapidly and atypical, waxy, furniture varnish, and dish rag like aromas appear when the wine is only 6 months to just over a year old. ATA is different from normal wine aging in both rate and flavor characteristics. This thesis is comprised of three papers: the first being a discussion of the history of research on the topic; next, a report on the process of describing ATA as a sensory phenomenon (taste panel results); the third paper describes research done to find ATA?s causes and responsible compounds. Work done in Germany regarding ATA has focused primarily on ortho-aminoacetophenone (O-AP), a compound responsible for the ?foxy? note in American labrusca grapes. O-AP {{does not seem to be}} an important compound in New York wines with ATA, however. What is agreed upon is the oxidative nature of ATA and the need for antioxidants beyond SO 2, such as ascorbic acid, to protect at-risk wines. During the 2001 - 2003 growing seasons, trials were conducted in a Riesling vineyard in the Finger Lakes region of New York State to study the effects of irrigation and nitrogen fertilization on ATA development. Wines made from this fruit were then analyzed sensorially and chemically to determine any differences these treatments may have had on wine quality, particularly in relation to the atypical aging defect.

For this goal different wine samples were produced using active dry wine yeast fermentation, spontaneous fermentation and fermentation with prepared ferment that contained original cultured yeast from local wine yard. The wines were produced from three vine varieties from year 2012 and 2013. The analytical and sensoric evaluation was subsequently carried out. The result of the experiment show a good and even sensoric quality of the wines produced using the active dry wine yeast fermentation, yet certain uniformity is apparent. On the contrary the spontaneous fermentation shows traces of unevenness in the sensoric quality evaluation. The most important finding is that the method that produces wine using the prepared ferment is a full alternative to the methods of spontaneous or active dry wine yeast fermentation and that in many cases leads to even better sensoric evaluation than these two methods.

Descriptive analysis was used by a trained panel to describe Pinot noir juice and wine from three sources.

The following three treatments were applied to the crushed grapes prior to pressing the juice: freezing and thawing; skin contact with 250 ppm Pectinol VR (a pectinase); and skin contact with 250 ppm Rohapect D 5 L (another pectinase). The trained panel developed descriptive terminology which differed between Pinot noir juice and Pinot noir wine. The juice treatments created subtle, if any, aroma differences.

40|$|Wine {{quality is}} related to its {{intrinsic}} visual, taste, or aroma characteristics and {{is reflected in the}} price paid for that wine. One of the most important wine faults is the excessive concentration of acetic acid which can cause a wine to take on vinegar aromas and reduce its <b>varietal</b> <b>character.</b> Thereby it is very important for the wine industry to have methods, like electronic noses, for real-time monitoring the excessive concentration of acetic acid in wines. However, aroma characterization of alcoholic beverages with sensor array electronic noses is a difficult challenge due to the masking effect of ethanol. In this work, in order to detect the presence of acetic acid in synthetic wine samples (aqueous ethanol solution at 10 % v/v) we use a detection unit which consists of a commercial electronic nose and a HSS 32 auto sampler, in combination with a neural network classifier (MLP). To find the characteristic vector representative of the sample that we want to classify, first we select the sensors, and the section of the sensors response curves, where the probability of detecting the presence of acetic acid will be higher, and then we apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) such that each sensor response curve is represented by the coefficients of its first principal components. Results show that the PEN 3 electronic nose is able to detect and discriminate wine samples doped with acetic acid in concentrations equal or greater than 2 g/L...|$|E
