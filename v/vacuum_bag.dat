5|$|After some time, {{they decided}} that the best method of {{featuring}} a <b>vacuum</b> <b>bag</b> {{was to have a}} cleaning lady vacuuming up the evidence. Whereas cleaning ladies had already been the murder victims of several previous episodes, here it seemed absolutely necessary if they wanted an episode to have a realistic plot. However, the writers believed that having a maid as the victim required a main character to work with in order to give some personal involvement. Monk was not considered mostly because he does not have a cleaning lady, and if he did, she would never be good enough for him because of his germophobia and meticulousness. It was eventually decided that the maid would be Dr. Kroger's employee. The idea of having her work for Dr. Kroger was successful, because the writers had been looking to have an episode where Kamel would be the focus.|$|E

500|$|... "Mr. Monk Gets a New Shrink" [...] {{was written}} by Hy Conrad and {{directed}} by Andrei Belgrader. The idea of hiding the crucial piece of evidence in a <b>vacuum</b> <b>bag</b> {{had been on the}} writing table for years at the time that this episode was written. The writers' problem was that they could not get a realistic idea on how to use it. One idea had actually been to have a killer hack up his victim, place the dismembered limbs into a self-cleaning oven, then vacuum out the remains and have the bag filled with the victim. The writers saw this possibility as too gruesome for the show. Other ideas had included hiding something valuable in the bag and having the killer stalk Monk while trying to recover it.|$|E

Bart throws him Mona's knife, which Homer uses to cut himself free. Meanwhile, Marge and Lisa light Marge's hemp purse on fire using a pair of Mona's diamond earrings which Lisa stole. This creates marijuana fumes through a vent, mellowing out the guards. Homer then breaks free from his prison room using [...] "The Defender", and stops the launch.

40|$|In {{order to}} match a {{predicted}} production ramp-up in aircraft production, {{state of the}} art manufacturing techniques have to be optimized regarding productivity and efficiency. Especially vacuum infusion techniques for large CFRP structures still involve a high amount of manual work. In detail, the <b>vacuum</b> <b>bagging</b> depends on manual lay-up processes of auxiliary materials. A first approach of automation concepts for robot-based <b>vacuum</b> <b>bagging</b> will be discussed in this paper. In a research project at the Center for Leigtweight Production Technology in Augsburg, automated manufacturing of a single-curved CFRP fuselage demonstrator has been investigated. A rigid gripping system with needle grippers has been developed and validated for the application of auxiliary materials as peel ply, release film and airweave {{on the top of a}} dry fiber preform. Alongside the process chain, handling and positioning procedures have been analyzed both analytically and in experimental test series. According to the rigidity of the gripping system, an adequate motion concept for the fuselage demonstrator has been found. The gripping system allows pick-up, transportation and positioning of auxiliary material packages on a single-curved preform with high accuracy.

Outside this bag is the real QCD vacuum, whose effect is taken into account through the difference between energy density of the true QCD vacuum and the perturbative <b>vacuum</b> (<b>bag</b> constant [...] ) and boundary conditions imposed on the quark wave functions and the gluon field. The hadron spectrum is obtained by solving the Dirac equation for quarks and the Yang–Mills equations for gluons. The wave functions of the quarks satisfy the boundary conditions of a fermion in an infinitely deep potential well of scalar type {{with respect to the}} Lorentz group. The boundary conditions for the gluon field are those of the dual color superconductor. The role of such a superconductor is attributed to the physical vacuum of QCD. Bag models strictly prohibit the existence of open color (free quarks, free gluons, etc.) and lead in particular to string models of hadrons.|$|E

In the last decades, light-weight core materials such as honeycomb, wood, foam core {{have been used in}} manufacture {{sandwich structures}} based on required. In this case, sandwich structure with poly-propylene honeycomb core and FGRP face sheet was modeled, produced, fabricated and tested. The composite sandwich structures were manufactured using hand lay-up and <b>vacuum</b> <b>bagging</b> manufacturing process. The behaviors of these structures under three point bending and four point bending were investigated. Flexural behavior of these structures has been experimentally and finite element investigated. Design sandwich composite structure with different thickness, manufacturing process and glass fiber skins. The main aim of the study is to analyze effect of material, loading span length, thickness and manufactured process on flexural behavior of the sandwich panel in load rate 1 mm/min.

50|$|<b>Vacuum</b> <b>bag</b> {{moulding}} uses {{a flexible}} film to enclose the part and seal it from outside air. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>bag</b> material {{is available in}} a tube shape or a sheet of material. A vacuum is then drawn on the <b>vacuum</b> <b>bag</b> and atmospheric pressure compresses the part during the cure. When a tube shaped bag is used, the entire part can be enclosed within the bag. When using sheet bagging materials, {{the edges of the}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>bag</b> are sealed against the edges of the mould surface to enclose the part against an air-tight mould. When bagged in this way, the lower mold is a rigid structure and the upper surface of the part is formed by the flexible membrane <b>vacuum</b> <b>bag.</b> The flexible membrane can be a reusable silicone material or an extruded polymer film. After sealing the part inside the <b>vacuum</b> <b>bag,</b> a vacuum is drawn on the part (and held) during cure.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Chemical surface {{modifications}} involving 1 % {{sodium hydroxide}} (NaOH) and 1 % acrylic acid (AA) treatments {{are applied to}} woven banana fabric and it is used as reinforcement in an unsaturated polyester matrix. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>bagging</b> technique was used to prepare the woven banana fiber-reinforced unsaturated polyester composites with four different volume percentages of fibers (5, 10, 15, and 20 %). The effects of fiber-loading and fiber surface treatments on the flexural, impact and water absorption properties of the composites were investigated. The acrylic acid treatment results in improved mechanical and water absorption properties of the composites compared to the alkali treatment and untreated fiber composites. The treatment effects on the banana fibers have been characterized by means of infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and microscopy analysis (SEM). The moisture absorption test showed that acrylic acid-treated woven banana fabric composites exhibit less water absorption than both alkali-treated and untreated woven banana fabric composites.

40|$|Electron beam curing of {{composites}} is a non-autoclave process, and consolidation pressure during cure has therefore {{been limited}} to that which may be provided by <b>vacuum</b> <b>bagging</b> the part, or by the application of direct mechanical force. Tooling to apply mechanical force tends {{to be limited to}} simple geometric shapes and may also block (shadow) the electron beam’s path to the composite. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>bagging</b> is readily adapted to most complex three-dimensional parts but the applied consolidation is limited to roughly atmospheric pressure and therefore cannot be relied on to collapse the expansion of volatiles during cure of the electron beam cured laminate. Preventive measures are therefore needed to reduce the factors that cause voids. A critical opportunity to reduce voids in the cured laminate is to minimize air entrapment between plies during lay-up. This paper reports the results of process trials conducted with IM 7 -GP- 12 K/ 3 K and IM 7 -GP- 12 K/ 8 HM unidirectional prepreg tapes to evaluate vacuum debulking and other parameters on the reduction of voids in electron beam cured laminates...|$|R

5000|$|Because voids {{are viewed}} as defects in {{composite}} materials, many methods are applied for reducing voids in composites. Traditionally, using <b>vacuum</b> <b>bagging</b> system and autoclave under pressure and heat will minimize or prevent voids from forming.
