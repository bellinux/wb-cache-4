Methanol phenolic extracts of dry rosemary leaves and olive <b>vegetable</b> <b>water</b> filtrate, in combination with BHA, were added to olive oil (blend of refined and virgin olive oil, 3 to 1) and to sunflower oil and their antioxidant effects under accelerated conditions were evaluated. Accelerated conditions included the oven test (at 63 °C) and the conductivity method (Rancimat at 120 °C). Frying process at 180 °C was also applied. The methanol phenolic extracts and the BHA were added to each oil at the following concentrations: 200 ppm rosemary extract; 200 ppm olive <b>vegetable</b> <b>water</b> extract; 100 ppm rosemary extract + 100 ppm BHA; 100 ppm <b>vegetable</b> <b>water</b> extract + 100 ppm BHA and 200 ppm BHA. In general, antioxidant effect of phenolic additives of rosemary and of BHA was in the following order: 200 ppm rosemary extract > 100 ppm rosemary extract + 100 ppm BHA > and 200 ppm BHA. The addition of 200 ppm <b>vegetable</b> <b>water</b> extract and 100 ppm <b>vegetable</b> <b>water</b> extract + 100 ppm BHA exhibited similar antioxidant effect to that of 200 ppm BHA.

During the frying period the trans fatty acids (TFA) by capillary column gas chromatography (CC-GC) were determined. Trans fatty acids of oleic and linoleic were increased with frying time in both the control oil samples. The rosemary additives (extracts) alone and in combination with BHA decreased the level of trans fatty acids (mainly elaidic acid), while the addition of olive <b>vegetable</b> <b>water</b> did not have any effect.

A milkbeverage (MB), without addition of phenoliccompounds, {{was used as}} the control. Except for a longer latency phase of FMB 200, the three beverages showed an almost similar kinetic of acidification, consumption of lactose and synthesis of lacticacid. Apart from the beverage, Lb. plantarum C 48 showed a decrease of ca. Log 2. 52 – 2. 24 cfu/ml during storage. The cell density of functionalLb. paracasei 15 N remained always above the value of Log 8. 0 cfu/ml. During fermentation, the total concentration of free amino acids markedly increased without significant (P > 0. 05) differences between beverages. The concentration of GABA increased during fermentation and further storage (63. 0 ± 0. 6 – 67. 0 ± 2. 1 mg/l) without significant (P > 0. 05) differences between beverages. After fermentation, FMB 100 and FMB 200 showed the same phenolic composition of the phenol extract from olive <b>vegetable</b> <b>water</b> but a different ratio between 3, 4 -DHPEA and 3, 4 -DHPEA-EDA. During storage, the concentrations of 3, 4 -DHPEA-EDA, p-HPEA and verbascoside of both FMB 100 and FMB 200 decreased. Only the concentration of 3, 4 -DHPEA increased.

Three diversity metrics and three evenness metrics were estimated from the abovementioned land cover categories for quantifying the effect of landscape composition on nymphal and adult Laodelphax striatellus Fallén. The degree of correlation between the proportion of crop cover and adjacent spatial scales (r: 0. 651 – 0. 983) was higher than the correlation between the proportion of crop cover and nonadjacent spatial scales (r: − 0. 255 – 0. 896). While the degree of correlation between diversity indices and abundance of L. striatellus decreased gradually when the spatial scales varied from large (> 100 m radius buffer) to small (< 100 m).

The situation is exacerbated in developing countries due to the lack of regulations where people consume vegetables grown using polluted soil and water. Most of the research works conducted in Addis Ababa revealed that the concentration of metals in vegetables reached toxic level and it was attributed, exclusively, to the industrial sources. To investigate the impact of natural environmental changes, in the current work, <b>vegetable,</b> <b>water</b> and soil samples were collected from the northern part of the city of Addis Ababa where there is no industrial activities and Ziway area in the Main Ethiopian Rift.

Populated area and rural area were compared to investigate for the concentrations of metals such as Cd, Cr, Pb and Zn, in soils, vegetables and irrigation water in order to understand the magnitude of metals in the edible part of the vegetables. The results indicate that vegetables that are grown in industrially free area of northern part of Addis Ababa, which are destined to the domestic consumption, contain high level of metals that are generated from geogenic sources. Until recent days, industrial pollution was attributed to be the main source of metals in the city’s irrigation water and irrigated vegetables, however, natural sources are widespread in the city.

40|$|Olive oil {{extraction}} using a horizontal centrifuge with a screw conveyor {{is an essential}} operation to reduce production costs. However, proper control of the plant is required to maintain {{a high level of}} extraction yield and olive oil quality. Rheological characteristics of the olive paste, which change in relation to water content, fruit variety, maturity level and seasonal temperature variations, greatly affect the efficiency of centrifugal extraction. If olive paste is fed to a decanter without automatic control, then non-optimal extraction is performed. After successfully testing a suitable flow mass sensor in order to set up an automatic system to control the olive paste mass flow rate fed to a decanter centrifuge during olive {{oil extraction}}, a feedback control system was tested in the laboratory and built in-line in an industrial processing plant. This allowed trials to be carried out at constant mass flow rate for both the paste and the added water, on a decanter centrifuge with variable differential speed between bowl and screw conveyor (i. e. variable DN) and with regulation capability of oil-water ring levels. Constant quality olives (cv. Coratina) were used for the trials; the correlation was evaluated between oil/water ring levels and DN with respect to the extraction yield, husk fat content and <b>vegetable</b> <b>water</b> fat content. The “oil recovery efficiency” (o) and “separation coefficient” S peaked with maximum residence time, using DN= 13. 3 and RING= 284. 8, while o minimum was achieved at higher DN. More specifically, for DN values higher than about 18 or lesser than 12, o becomes independent of RING. Furthermore, o and S values are strictly related to the geometry of the decanter centrifuge, whereas the paste dilution ratio determines the preservation quality of the oil extracted, and the maximum oil recovery efficiency represents the remaining objective related to the quantity of extracted oil. From experimental data some interesting relations were found linking decanter centrifuge parameters; their relationship depends on a complete quadratic interaction model constituted by the input variables that leads to highly correlated polynomials between DN vs. Uopdb ("mass fraction of oil in the fed olive paste" (dry basis)) and o optimal vs. Uopdb. These relations allow optimization of DN and RING values such that maximum oil recovery efficiency is achieved. Indeed, knowledge of Uopdb by an on-line method allows the decanter DN and RING operating parameters, to be calculated and modified at once, obtaining optimal maximum oil recovery efficiency...|$|E

The collected 180 samples of <b>vegetables,</b> <b>water,</b> soil, after preparation by atomic absorption Spectrophotometers, were analyzed according to standard methods. Results: Mean concentration values of lead, cadmium, chromium, arsenic and zinc in vegetable samples were, respectively 23. 99, 2. 09, 5. 4, 5. 26, 168. 4 micrograms per gram of plant tissue. Mean concentrations of heavy metals in water were, respectively, 7. 55, 4. 85, 0. 78, 12. 83 and 347. 99 mg per liter in water samples. Mean concentrations of heavy metals in soil were, respectively, 81. 12, 14. 43, 134. 32, 19. 08 and 435 micrograms, per gram of soil sample.
