The Faraday and Voigt rotations were measured {{as a function of}} four parameters: applied field, specimen thickness, wavelength and polarization azimuth of the incident light. Nickel films were grown epitaxially on a monocrystalline copper layer deposited on rock salt. The specimens were selected, using optical and electron microscopy, to be as near as possible to the theoretical ideal of pure, parallel-sided, monocrystalline films. The thickness of each specimen was measured using a multiple beam Fizeau fringe technique. The magneto-optical rotations were measured using a photoelectric polarimeter, accurate to [one-sixth] of arc, which is described 6 later in the thesis.

5000|$|A typical {{hysteresis}} cycle {{containing the}} <b>Voigt</b> <b>effect</b> {{is shown in}} figure 1. This cycle was obtained by sending a linearly polarized light along the 110 direction with an incident angle of approximately 3° (more details can be found in [...] ), and measuring the rotation due to magneto-optical effects of the reflected light beam. In contrast to the common longitudinal/polar Kerr effect, the hysteresis cycle is even with respect to the magnetization, which is a signature of the <b>Voigt</b> <b>effect.</b> This cycle was obtained with a light incidence very close to normal, and it also exhibits a small odd part; a correct treatment has to be carried out in order to extract the symmetric part of the hysteresis corresponding to the <b>Voigt</b> <b>effect,</b> and the asymmetric part corresponding to the longitudinal Kerr effect.|$|E

From the observed Zeeman and piezo transitions of the D line, the behaviour of the ground and excited states has been determined.

Though this complex constitutes a hydrogenic atom, the presence of H causes the ground state to be very different from that of unperturbed group III impurities. The observed ground state behaviour provides a template for identification of such axial defects. A new method was adopted to diffuse Mg into Ge. In the process, complexes were introduced. Zeeman studies were carried out with B||for two of these, viz., MgX 1 and MgX 2.

40|$|Faraday {{effect in}} the {{wurtzite}} (uniaxial) diluted magnetic semiconductor (DMS), Cd 1 -xMn xSe, is studied with the magnetic field (H) either parallel or perpendicular its optic axis (c). For Hc, the Faraday effect is qualitatively {{similar to that in}} the cubic DMS 2 ̆ 7 s. The Faraday rotation, positive for CdSe, becomes negative and very large when Mn 2 + replaces Cd 2 +. The sign of the rotation and its dependence on x, H, and temperature T are dominated by the spin-spin exchange interaction between band electrons and Mn 2 + electrons (sp-d exchange interaction). The dispersion of the Faraday effect is well described by an excitonic model. The antiferromagnetic coupling between Mn 2 + ions is manifested in the Faraday effect through the phenomenological effective temperature (T+T AF), as well as with hysteresis effects associated with the formation of spin-glass phase for high x and low T. ^ For Hc, the natural birefringence of Cd 1 -xMn xSe as well as the Faraday rotation affects the polarization of the light. Decomposing the combined effect into the separate contributions due to the birefringence and the Faraday effect, it is found that the dispersion of the Faraday constant is very similar for Hc and Hc, although the Faraday effect for the former is smaller. ^ In the Voigt geometry (Hk), the refractive index parallel to H differs from that perpendicular to H, resulting in a linear double refraction, called the <b>Voigt</b> <b>effect.</b> This effect is found to be very large in the DMS 2 ̆ 7 s due to the large sp-d exchange interaction. An excitonic model describes the dispersion and H 2 -dependence of the <b>Voigt</b> <b>effect</b> in Cd 1 -xMn xTe.

40|$|A novel {{spectroscopy}} X-ray magneto-optical spectroscopy of buried antiferromagnetic films: Theory {{and experiment}} X-ray magneto-optical (MO) spectroscopies have developed into extremely powerful tools {{for the investigation}} of both fundamental and applied magnetism. In particular the x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) has become widely used during the last decade. A disadvantage of the XMCD and related techniques is that these can be applied only to study ferromagnetic (FM) materials. There exists currently an increasing interest in antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials which call for different x-ray spectroscopic techniques. A novel, versatile magneto-x-ray spectroscopy has been developed, {{that can be applied}} to AFM’s. This magneto-x-ray spectroscopy may be measured in reflection and is related to the x-ray <b>Voigt</b> <b>effect</b> and the x-ray magnetic linear dichroism (XMLD), which both involve a transmission geometry. Using the newly developed technique, element-selective x-ray MO spectra of AFM materials have been measured {{for the first time in}} reflection. The XMLD-type reflection spectroscopy has been applied to buried AFM layers, which was demonstrated by spectra obtained from exchange-biased microstructures of current technological importance: NiO/Co and NiMn/Co, containing the insulating AFM NiO, and the metallic AFM NiMn, respectively. The measured spectrum provides information about the exchangesplit d-density of states of the AFM atom. Modern magnetic materials are often composed of several elements, each of which contributes in a specific manner to the global magnetic properties. In order to understand the magnetic behavior of a complex compound on the basis of its constituents, the magnetic state of an individual sort of atoms must be determined. Such an element-selective probing of magnetic atoms can be conveniently achieved by x-ray magneto-optical (MO) spectroscopies. As a consequence, these spectroscopies have developed into leading-edge research techniques for the investigation of magnetism. The continuously increasing access to brilliant and polarized synchrotron radiation has also considerably boosted the popularity of magneto-x-ray spectroscopies.
