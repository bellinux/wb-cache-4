50|$|As {{these cells}} {{traverse}} an ATM network, switching takes place {{by changing the}} VPI/VCI values (label swapping). Although the VPI/VCI values are not necessarily consistent {{from one end of}} the connection to the other, the concept of a circuit is consistent (unlike IP, where any given packet could get to its destination by a different route than the others). ATM switches use the VPI/VCI fields to identify the <b>virtual</b> <b>channel</b> <b>link</b> (VCL) of the next network that a cell needs to transit on its way to its final destination. The function of the VCI is similar to that of the data link connection identifier (DLCI) in frame relay and the logical channel number and logical channel group number in X.25.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Conventional {{oblivious}} routing algorithms do {{not take}} into account resource requirements (e. g., bandwidth, latency) of various flows in a given application. As they are not aware of flow demands that are specific to the application, network resources can be poorly utilized and cause serious local congestion. Also, flows, or packets, may share <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> in an undetermined way; the effects of head-of-line blocking may result in throughput degradation. In this paper, we present a framework for application-aware routing that assures deadlock freedom under one or more <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> by forcing routes to conform to an acyclic channel dependence graph. In addition, we present methods to statically and efficiently allocate <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> to flows or packets, under oblivious routing, when there are two or more <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> per <b>link.</b> Using the application-aware routing framework, we develop and evaluate a bandwidth-sensitive oblivious routing scheme that statically determines routes considering an application’s communication characteristics. Given bandwidth estimates for flows, we present a mixed integer-linear programming (MILP) approach and a heuristic approach for producing deadlock-free routes that minimize maximum channel load. Our framework can be used to produce application-aware routes that target the minimization of latency, number of flows through a link, bandwidth, or any combination thereof. Our results show {{that it is possible to}} achieve better performance than traditional deterministic and oblivious routing schemes on popular synthetic benchmarks using our bandwidth-sensitive approach. We also show that, when oblivious routing is used and there are more flows than <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> per <b>link,</b> the static assignment of <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> to flows can help mitigate the effects of head-ofline blocking, which may impede packets that are dynamically competing for <b>virtual</b> <b>channels.</b> We experimentally explore th...|$|R

Through-wafer optical interconnect has been proposed as a useful technology for building ultra-compact MPPs since it provides a simplified mechanism for interconnecting stacked multichip substrates. This paper presents the offset cube, a new network topology designed to exploit the packaging benefits of through-wafer optical interconnect in ultra-compact MPP systems. We validate the offset cube’s topological efficiency by developing deadlock-free adaptive routing protocols with modest <b>virtual</b> <b>channel</b> requirements (only two <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> per <b>link</b> needed for full adaptivity). A preliminary analysis of router complexity suggests these protocols can be efficiently implemented in hardware. We also present a 3 D mesh embedding for the offset cube. Network simulations show the offset cube performs comparably to a bidirectional 3 D mesh of equal size under uniform, hot-spot, and trace-driven traffic loads. While the offset cube is not proposed as a general replacement for the mesh topology, it leverages the benefits of through-wafer optical interconnect more effectively than a mesh by completely eliminating chip-to-chip wires for data signals. Hence, the offset cube is an effective topology for interconnecting ultra-compact MCM-level MPP systems...|$|R
40|$|Most routers in on-chip {{interconnection}} networks (OCINs) have multiple <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> (VCs) {{to mitigate the}} effects of head-of-line blocking. Multiple VCs necessitate VC allocation schemes since packets or flows must compete for channels when there are more flows than <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> at a <b>link.</b> Conventional dynamic VC allocation, however, raises two critical issues. First, it still suffers from {{a fair amount of}} head-of-line blocking since all flows can be assigned to any VC within a link. Moreover, dynamic VC allocation compromises the guarantee of in-order delivery even when used with basic variants of dimension-ordered routing, requiring large reorder buffers at the destination core or, alternatively, expensive retransmission logic. In this thesis, we present two <b>virtual</b> <b>channel</b> allocation schemes to address these problems: Static <b>Virtual</b> <b>Channel</b> Allocation and Exclusive Dynamic <b>Virtual</b> <b>Channel</b> Allocation (EDVCA). Static VC allocation assigns channels to flows by precomputation when oblivious routing is used, and ensures deadlock freedom for arbitrary minimal routes when two or more VCs are available. EDVCA, on the other hand, is done at runtime, not requiring knowledge of traffic patterns or routes in advance. We demonstrate that both static VCA and EDVCA guarantee in-order packet delivery under single path routing, and furthermore, that they both outperform dynamic VC allocation (out-of-order) by effectively reducing head-of-line blocking. We also introduce a novel bandwidth-sensitive oblivious routing scheme (BSORM), which is deadlock-free through appropriate static VC allocation. Implementation for these schemes requires only minor, inexpensive changes to traditional oblivious dimension-ordered router architectures, more than offset by the removal of packet reorder buffers and logic. by Keun Sup Shim.

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} {{the use of}} slow-silent <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> to reduce the switching power of on-chip networks while keeping the leakage power small. Adding <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> to a network improves the throughput until each link bandwidth is saturated. This enables us to reduce the switching power of on-chip networks by decreasing their operating frequency and supply voltage. However, adding <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> increases the leakage power of routers {{as well as the}} area due to their large buffers; so the runtime power gating is applied to individual <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> to eliminate this problem. We evaluate the performance of slow-silent <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> by using real application traces, and their power consumption (switching and leakage) is evaluated based on the detailed design of a virtual-channel router placed and routed with a 90 nm technology.

In the cases of neighboring communications, a network with two <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> is better than the other networks with more <b>virtual</b> <b>channels,</b> because the performance improvement from no <b>virtual</b> <b>channel</b> to two <b>virtual</b> <b>channels</b> is the largest and their frequency and supply voltage can also be reduced well in these cases. ...|$|R
