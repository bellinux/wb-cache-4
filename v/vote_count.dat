The final <b>vote</b> <b>count</b> gave Republican William S. Taylor a small plurality with 193,714 votes to Goebel's 191,331; Brown garnered only 12,140 votes.|$|E

Ford defeated Matthews by 631 votes, 0.2% of the total <b>vote</b> <b>count</b> in the primary. He ran an independent campaign and won {{in the general election}} even as Combs-Breathitt pick Henry Ward lost the race for governor to Republican Louie B. Nunn.

While Tedisco had been ahead in early counts, by April 10 Murphy was leading, and by April 23 Murphy had a 401-vote advantage. Tedisco conceded the race the following day, and Murphy was sworn in on April 29. Democratic electoral successes in November 2008 and Murphy's clear support of the stimulus package were credited for his success.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>vote</b> <b>count,</b> the Progressive Conservatives {{emerged with}} nine more seats than they {{held at the}} {{dissolution}} of the previous legislature. The party had won 69.5 percent of the popular vote, the highest popular vote share ever attained by the PC party in the province. Three Liberal incumbents, as well as NDP leader Lorraine Michael, successfully held their seats. Notably, however, Liberal leader Gerry Reid was not reelected in his own district. The next month Williams' Progressive Conservatives increased their seat count to 44 out of 48, after winning a deferred election in Grand Falls-Windsor-Buchans following the death of Liberal candidate Gerry Tobin on October 1.|$|E

5|$|In balloting for the National Baseball Hall of Fame {{following}} his retirement, Ruffing often received votes from approximately 50% {{of the voters}} in the Baseball Writers' Association of America, short of the 75% required for induction. Bob Feller wrote an article in The Saturday Evening Post in 1962, calling Ruffing, Satchel Paige, and Luke Appling the three most deserving players who {{had yet to be}} elected. The balloting of 1967 was Ruffing's final year of eligibility, as he had retired twenty years prior. Ruffing finished with 212 votes, tied with Joe Medwick for the highest <b>vote</b> <b>count,</b> but was seven votes short of the 219 required for induction. However, a runoff election held the next month saw Ruffing into the Hall of Fame the next month.|$|E

Bush of Texas {{and the vice president}} of the United States, Al Gore. Gore, who as vice president was required to preside over his own Electoral College defeat (by five electoral votes), denied the objections, all of which were raised by only several representatives and would have favored his candidacy, after no senators would agree to jointly object. Objections were again raised in the <b>vote</b> <b>count</b> of the 2004 elections, and on that occasion the document was presented by one representative and one senator. Although the joint session was suspended, the objections were quickly disposed of and rejected by both Houses of Congress. If there are no objections or all objections are overruled, the presiding officer simply includes a state's votes, as declared in the certificate of vote, in the official tally.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{expose the}} results of a voting {{experiment}} realised in 2007, during the French Presidential election. This experiment aimed at confronting the Single Transferable vote (SVT) procedure to two criteria : simplicity and the selection of a Condorcet-winner. Building on our electoral sample's preferences, we show that this voting procedure can design a different winner, depending on the <b>vote</b> <b>counting</b> process. With the <b>vote</b> <b>counting</b> process advocated by Hare, the winner is Nicolas Sarkozy, while the Coombs <b>vote</b> <b>counting</b> process has François Bayrou as winner. For these two <b>vote</b> <b>counting</b> processes, the details of the experiment are the same and it is shown that the simplicity criterion is respected. However, with regard to the Condorcet-winner criterion, the Coombs methods is the only one to elect the Condorcet-winner, i. e. François Bayrou.
