The Atari 2600 game Combat, released in 1977, includes several <b>variations</b> <b>of</b> Tank, including ones with bouncing shots or invisible tanks. Combat was initially developed as a console version of the arcade game, like the cancelled dedicated console version, with additional plane-based game modes added during development.
