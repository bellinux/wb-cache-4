40|$|NASA has {{recently}} {{developed a new}} piezoelectric actuator, the Radial Field Diaphragm or RFD. This actuator uses a radially-directed electric field to generate concentric out-of-plane (Z-axis) motion that allows this packaged device {{to be used as}} a pump or <b>valve</b> <b>diaphragm.</b> In order to efficiently use this new active device, experimental determination of pressure, flow rate, mechanical work, power consumption and overall efficiency needs to be determined by actually building a pump. However, without an optimized pump design, it is difficult to assess the quality of the data, as these results are inherent to the actual pump. Hence, separate experiments must be conducted in order to generate independent results to help guide the design criteria and pump quality. This paper focuses on the experiments used to generate the RFD’s operational parameters and then compares these results to the experimentally determined results of several types of ball pumps. Also discussed are how errors are inherently introduced into the experiments, the pump design, experimental hardware and their effects on the overall system efficiency...|$|E

The diaphragm pressure obtained was that of 40 shores for 13 patients and 50 shores for 19 patients. 60 shores was never used.

30|$|Valve {{piezoelectric}} pumps {{usually have}} larger flow rate {{than that of}} valveless ones. However, the traditional cantilever valve easily induces stress concentration which impacts the reliability of pumps. Therefore, a cymbal-shaped slotted check valve is proposed to be applied in a piezoelectric pump {{in order to reduce}} the stress concentration of the valve and thus improve the reliability of the piezoelectric pump. The structure and working principle of the piezoelectric pump are analyzed; the stress analysis of the cymbal-shaped slotted <b>valve</b> <b>diaphragm</b> is conducted. In addition, finite element software is employed to analyze the difference of the Von-Mises stress between the cymbal-shaped slotted diaphragm and the slotted flat diaphragm. The simulation results show that, the Von-Mises stress of cymbal-shaped slotted diaphragm is smaller than that of the slotted flat one. Furthermore, the cymbal-shaped slotted valve piezoelectric pump is also fabricated, and flow rate experiment is performed. The experimental results indicate that the flow rate of piezoelectric pump working in low frequencies (0  Hz < f <  50  Hz) is larger than that working in high frequencies (200  Hz < f <  2000  Hz). When driven at voltage of 160  V and frequency of 5  Hz, the pump reaches its maximum flow rate of 6.6  g/min. The experimental results validate the feasibility of the cymbal-shaped slotted check valve. This research can effectively solve the problem of stress concentration of valve piezoelectric pumps and is helpful for improving the reliability of them.|$|E

However, for transitional and turbulent flow the same loss coefficients cannot be applied for more accurate designs for <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valves</b> from different manufacturers.

40|$|Despite the {{extensive}} use of straight-through <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valves</b> in many diverse industrial applications, very few studies of frictional pressure loss for straight-through <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valves</b> {{have been reported in}} the open literature. The few that are available are for fully opened valves based on the tacit assumption that different sized <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valves</b> are geometrically similar. In this study, the pressure drops across five straight-through <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valves</b> were measured in four aperture positions. Resistance coefficients were determined by experimentally establishing pressure gradients upstream and downstream of the valves. The experiments were carried out using Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids over a wide range of Reynolds numbers with the emphasis on obtaining laminar flow data. The Hooper 2 -k correlation was corroborated and found to be valid at Reynolds numbers < 10 for straight-through <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valves.</b> At higher Reynolds numbers the resistance coefficient is shown to be dependent on the size and the opening of the valve. Three different approaches (domain separation, simple summation, and selective combination) using a two-constant model to predict the experimental resistance coefficients were explored. Comparison of the correlations with experimental data and existing models has shown that the simple summation two-constant model approach has substantial merit. Considering the complexities of accounting for the valve size, the valve opening position, the type of fluid over a Reynolds number range of 0. 1 - 100 000, this model gives pipeline design engineers a simple, semi-empirical correlation for the estimation of resistance coefficients of straight-through <b>diaphragm</b> control <b>valves...</b>|$|R

40|$|Dissertation {{submitted}} in fulfilment of {{requirements for}} the degree Master Technology: Chemical Engineering in the FACULTY OF ENGINEERING at the CAPE PENINSULA UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY, 2009 The prediction of the energy losses when designing pipeline and pumping systems requires accurate loss coefficient data. But the loss coefficient data found in the open literature was not adequate for predicting the loss coefficient for Saunders straight-through <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valves.</b> As more accurate loss coefficient data to enable more efficient pipeline designs are scarce in the open literature, it is problematic to predict the head loss due to the pipeline fittings, and particularly for <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valves.</b> Most of the data given in the literature are for turbulent flow based on water. Due to water shortages mining operations are forced to increase their solids concentrations and to operate in laminar flow (Slatter, 2002). Consequently {{there is a need}} to determine loss coefficient data in laminar flow for valves used in these industries to ensure energy efficient designs (Pienaar et al., 2001; 2004) or if needed, to derive a new correlation to predict losses through Saunders <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valves.</b> However, a systematic study of various sizes of <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valves</b> of different manufacturers to ascertain, if the same loss coefficient can be applied, has never been done. Therefore a comparison will be made between the data produced in this work and the existing correlations.

Once the chamber is fully pressurised the compressed air behind the diaphragm is quickly vented, causing the centre of the diaphragm to flex backwards, exposing the butt of the barrel to the compressed air inside the chamber, which rapidly exhausts through the barrel, launching the projectile.

40|$|Thesis (MTech (Chemical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2005 The {{prediction}} of head losses in a pipe system {{is very important}} because head losses affect the performance of fluid machinery such as pumps. In a pipe system, two kinds of losses are observed: major losses and minor losses. In Newtonian and non-Newtonian flow, major losses {{are those that are}} due to friction in straight pipes and minor losses are those that are due to pipe fittings such as contractions, expansions, bends and valves. Minor losses must be accurately predicted in a pipe system because they are not negligible and can sometimes outweigh major losses (Edwards et al., 1985). There is presently little data for the {{prediction of}} non-Newtonian head losses in pipe fittings in the literature and little consensus amongst researchers (Pienaar et al., 2004). In the case of <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valves,</b> usually, only one loss coefficient value is given in turbulent flow or in laminar flow with no reference to a specific size of the valve, assuming geometrical similarity that would lead to dynamic similarity. However, no one has done a systematic study of various sizes of <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valves</b> from the same manufacturer to establish if this is true. This could be the main reason for discrepancies found in the literature (Hooper, 1981; Perry & Chilton, 1973; Miller, 1978 and Pienaar et al., 2004). This work addresses this issue. A literature revIew on the flow of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids has been presented. The work of Hooper (1981) on <b>diaphragm</b> <b>valves</b> and the works of Edwards et al., (1985), BaneIjee et aI., (1994) and Turian et al., (1997) for non-Newtonian fluids in globe and gate valves were found to be relevant to this work...|$|R
