Therefore, the paper proposes to replace the <b>voluntary</b> <b>agreement</b> by an emission trading scheme which directly places car makers under obligation. This switch in policy should be accompanied by further phased increases in the ecotax levied on fuels and a vehicle taxation system that places greater focus on CO 2 emission. ...|$|R
