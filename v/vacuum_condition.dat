50|$|The Kelvin probe {{technique}} {{relies on}} the detection of an electric field (gradient in ϕ) between a sample material and probe material.The electric field can be varied by the voltage ΔVsp that {{is applied to the}} probe relative to the sample.If the voltage is chosen such that the electric field is eliminated (the flat <b>vacuum</b> <b>condition),</b> thenSince the experimenter controls and knows ΔVsp, then finding the flat <b>vacuum</b> <b>condition</b> gives directly the work function difference between the two materials.The only question is, how to detect the flat vacuum condition?Typically, the electric field is detected by varying the distance between the sample and probe. When the distance is changed but ΔVsp is held constant, a current will flow due to the change in capacitance. This current is proportional to the vacuum electric field, and so when the electric field is neutralized no current will flow.|$|E

50|$|The device {{consists}} of a hot cathode (filaments), anodes (phosphor) and grids encased in a glass envelope under a high <b>vacuum</b> <b>condition.</b> The cathode {{is made up of}} fine tungsten wires, coated by alkaline earth metal oxides, which emit electrons when heated by an electric current.

50|$|As a result, {{specimens}} can {{be examined}} {{faster and more}} easily, avoiding complex and time consuming preparation methods, without modifying the natural surface or creating artifacts by the preceding preparation work, or the vacuum of the SEM. Gas/liquid/solid interactions can be studied dynamically in situ and in real time, or recorded for post processing. Temperature variations from subzero to above 1000 °C and various ancillary devices for specimen micro-manipulation have become a new reality. Biological specimens can be maintained fresh and live.

50|$|The {{presence}} of gas around a specimen creates new possibilities unique to ESEM: (a) Liquid-phase electron microscopy is possible since any pressure greater than 609 Pa allows water {{to be maintained}} in its liquid phase for temperatures above 0 °C, {{in contrast to the}} SEM where specimens are desiccated by the <b>vacuum</b> <b>condition.</b> (b) Electrically non-conductive specimens do not require the preparation techniques used in SEM to render the surface conductive, such as the deposition of a thin gold or carbon coating, or other treatments, techniques which also require vacuum in the process. Insulating specimens charge up by the electron beam making imaging problematic or even impossible. (c) The gas itself is used as a detection medium producing novel imaging possibilities, as opposed to vacuum SEM detectors. (d) Plain plastic scintillating BSE detectors can operate uncoated without charging. Hence, these detectors produce the highest possible signal-to-noise-ratio at the lowest possible accelerating voltage, because the BSE do not dissipate any energy in an aluminium coating used for the vacuum SEM.|$|E

30|$|In summary, we have {{observed}} a giant PPC phenomenon of WO 3 nanowire in <b>vacuum</b> <b>condition.</b> No decreasing current {{can be observed}} in absence of oxygen molecular atmosphere, and a gradually decay current can be presented in air condition. For the SiO 2 -surrounded WO 3 nanowire, there is a very weak photoresponse in our measurements. The high bias and high electric field effects can accelerate the decay process in air, but not in <b>vacuum</b> <b>condition.</b> We can conclude that: (1) the photoconductivity of WO 3 nanowire is mainly related to the oxygen adsorption and desorption, and the typical semiconductor photoconductivity properties of WO 3 nanowire are very weak comparing to the surface effect; (2) the giant PPC effect is caused by the absence oxygen molecular as recombination center in <b>vacuum</b> <b>condition,</b> and the intensity of PPC is only depended on the oxygen molecular re-adsorbed rate on the surface of WO 3 nanowires; (3) the thermal effect and oxygen re-adsorption can accelerate the decay current.|$|E
