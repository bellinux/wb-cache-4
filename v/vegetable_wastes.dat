Overall, these results suggest that green <b>vegetable</b> <b>waste</b> derived activated carbon as a low-cost adsorbent for the removal of copper (II) will be useful for future scale-up for the tertiary treatment of wastewater...|$|R
30|$|This {{experiment}} used a factorial randomized {{block design}} (RBD) {{which consisted of}} two factors. Factor I comprised three kinds of vermicompost (V) with three different bedding materials; V 1 : mixture of spent mushroom <b>waste,</b> cow dung, <b>vegetable</b> <b>waste,</b> and leaf litter, V 2 : mixture of coconut husk, cow dung, <b>vegetable</b> <b>waste</b> and leaf litter, and V 3 : sugarcane trash, cow dung, <b>vegetable</b> <b>waste</b> and leaf litter. Factor II comprised 4 different rates of vermicompost application: D 1 [*]=[*] 5 t ha− 1, D 2 [*]=[*] 10 t ha− 1, D 3 [*]=[*] 15 t ha− 1, and D 4 [*]=[*] 20 t ha− 1. From these two factors, there were 12 treatment combinations plus one control treatment (without vermicompost application). Each treatment was replicated 3 times to obtain 39 units of experimental plot, and each experimental plot had 5 samples of the observed plants.|$|R
