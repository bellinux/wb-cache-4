40|$|The {{transition}} of a fossil fuel to a biobased economy {{in combination with}} the prospected increase in the world’s population will lead to a growing demand for additional sources of biomass that can complement traditional agricultural biomass production. Microalgae are unicellar aquatic organisms that receive much interest as a promising source of biofuels or bulk protein. But today, the cost and energy demand for production of microalgae using current the best available technologies is still too high for bulk biomass production. The introduction of a flocculation pre-concentration can be an interesting improvement to existing harvesting processes and reduce significantly overall production costs. The usage of aluminum sulphate; electro-coagulation-flocculation; biopolymers such as chitosan and cationic starch; and flocculation induced by high pH was studied in detail for both freshwater and marine species. Influence of the presence of algal organic matter (AOM) was investigated for all modes of flocculation and related to the flocculation efficiency; the flocculation mechanism and the floc characteristics (floc size, aggregated <b>volumetric</b> <b>index,</b> sedimentation velocity). Our study showed that pH induced flocculation is a promising and cost competitive alternative harvesting technique (US $ 20 ton- 1 biomass). Other parameters, such as interference of AOM, medium recyclability and contamination risk are included in the overall assessment of flocculation based harvesting methods. status: publishe...|$|E

We determined the effect of S. invicta on loggerhead shrike (Lanius ludovicianus L.) abundance and investigated a possible mechanism of impact, which is a reduction in insect prey availability. We used a fire ant bait (hydramethylnon) to reduce fire ant populations on one randomly chosen member of each of five pairs of 202 -ha study areas in the Texas coastal Bend region, and also measured shrike relative abundance and a <b>volumetric</b> <b>index</b> of insect biomass on the study areas.

More shrikes were observed on areas where S. invicta populations had been reduced. Both insect biomass and shrike abundance were negatively correlated to the level of S. invicta infestation. Our data suggest that shrikes may avoid areas on wintering habitats that have been invaded by S. invicta and that this avoidance may result from reduced insect availability...|$|E

Inter-study reproducibility {{is a key}} requirement for longitudinal studies but has not been defined for CMR-based quantification of left atrial (LA) and right atrial (RA) dynamics. Methods: Long-axis 2 - and 4 -chamber cine images were acquired at 9 : 00 (Exam A), 9 : 30 (Exam B) and 14 : 00 (Exam C) in 16 healthy volunteers.

40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{evaluate}} the clinical, US (ultrasound) -Doppler and hematologic findings after proximal splenic artery embolization (PSAE) for blunt injury. METHODS: From August 1998 to February 2003, 37 patients (28 men and 9 women; 20 - 89 years old, mean 40 years) underwent PSAE for blunt injuries. One patient required secondary splenectomy after PSAE. Early complications were investigated during the hospital stay. Delayed follow-up included {{review of the}} outpatient records, telephone interview, consultation, US-Doppler splenic study, Howell-Jolly body search, and serum antibody titer determinations (pneumococcus and Haemophilus influenzae B). RESULTS: No early postprocedural complications were depicted. Ten patients were lost on follow-up. Two patients had a telephone interview that revealed no complication. Twenty-four patients were examined 6 to 63 (mean 26) months after the embolization. No late complication was reported. Splenic measurements were in the normal range: length (53 - 110 mm; mean, 73), width (49 - 110 mm; 76), thickness (26 - 56 mm; 38), volume (61 - 508 mL; 226), standard ellipsoid formula volume (32 - 265 mL; 118), corrected volume (29 - 238 mL; 106), and splenic <b>volumetric</b> <b>index</b> (2. 3 - 18. 8; 8. 4). The spleen was homogeneous in 23 patients (96 %). Intrasplenic vascularization was present and splenic vein was patent in all patients. Howell-Jolly bodies were found in two patients. All patients (24 of 24) evaluated for exposure-driven immunity against Haemophilus Influenza b had sufficient immunity. Seventeen of the 18 patients (94 %) evaluated for exposure-driven immunity against pneumococcus had sufficient immunity. Five of the six patients (83 %) evaluated for pneumococcus vaccine response had a sufficient response.

Effect of the inoculated strain was also determined on the settling properties {{and the removal of}} chemical oxygen demand (COD). Two laboratory scale reactors were set up to achieve a stable nitrifying state under the same physicochemical conditions of hydraulic retention time (HRT), temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen (DO), and operated under the sequencing batch mode. The level of DO was kept at 0. 5 – 1. 5 mg/L by periodic stirring and aeration. Each specific Corg/N ratio was continued for duration of 3 weeks. One of the reactors (BR 2) was inoculated with P. ammonioxydans H 9 T periodically at the start of each Corg/N ratio. Sludge <b>volumetric</b> <b>index</b> (SVI) improved with the increasing Corg/N ratio, but no significant difference was detected between the two reactors. BR 2 showed higher levels of nitrogen removal with the increasing heterotrophic conditions, and the ammonia removal reached to the level of 82 %– 88 %, up to 10 % higher than that in the control reactor (BR 1) at Corg/N ratios higher than 6; however, the ammonia removal level in experimental reactor was up to 8 % lower than that in control reactor at Corg/N ratios lower than 2.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: The {{evaluation}} of treatment strategies for {{deep venous thrombosis}} (DVT) is assessed {{through the use of}} a reliable method of quantifying the extent of the thrombotic process. Previous indices of thrombus burden have suffered from various limitations, including lack of clinical relevance, poor correlation with actual thrombus mass, and failure to include important venous segments in the methodology. The use of a novel scheme of quantifying venous thrombus was evaluated as an alternative method that would avoid some of the drawbacks of existing indices. Methods: The volumes of 14 venous segments (infrarenal inferior vena cava, common iliac, hypogastric, external iliac, common femoral, profunda, superficial femoral, and popliteal and six tibial veins) were calculated from computed tomography (pelvic vein diameter), duplex ultrasound scan (infrainguinal vein diameter), and contrast venography (length of all segments) measurements. A venous <b>volumetric</b> <b>index</b> (VVI) was assigned with the normalization of the values to the volume of a single calf vein. The VVI was validated with the assessment of the ability to discriminate between asymptomatic and symptomatic DVT and between those DVT that were associated with pulmonary emboli and those that were not. Results: With the imaging data, the VVI ranged from 1 for a single calf vein thrombus to 26 for the infrarenal inferior vena cava. Each VVI unit represented 2. 3 mL of thrombus, with a maximum possible score of 63 representing a thrombus burden of 145 mL for a single extremity, including the infrarenal inferior vena cava. In 885 patients with DVT, the VVI ranged from 1 to 56, averaging 3. 9 ± 0. 2 in patients who were asymptomatic and 8. 7 ± 0. 3 in patients who were symptomatic (P <. 001). The VVI was similar in the patients with pulmonary emboli as compared with those without (9. 6 ± 1. 2 vs 7. 7 ± 0. 2, respectively). In comparison with the three existing methods of quantifying venous thrombus burden, the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis results suggested that the VVI and the Venous Registry index were better than the other two indices in the discrimination of patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic DVT (P <. 001). Conclusion: A novel index of venous thrombus burden, on the basis of actual venous volume measurements, was more accurate than present indices in the differentiation between clinical categories of patients with DVT. As such, it offers an acceptable alternative to current scoring systems. (J Vasc Surg 1999; 30 : 1060 - 6. ...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the ability of}} orbital apex crowding volume measurements calculated with multidetector-computed tomography to detect dysthyroid optic neuropathy. METHODS: Ninety-three patients with Graves' orbitopathy were studied prospectively. All of the patients underwent a complete neuro-ophthalmic examination and computed tomography scanning. Volumetric measurements were calculated from axial and coronal contiguous sections using a dedicated workstation. Orbital fat and muscle volume were estimated {{on the basis of}} their attenuation values (in Hounsfield units) using measurements from the anterior orbital rim to the optic foramen. Two indexes of orbital muscle crowding were calculated: i) the <b>volumetric</b> crowding <b>index,</b> which is the ratio between soft tissue (mainly extraocular muscles) and orbital fat volume and is based on axial scans of the entire orbit; and ii) the volumetric orbital apex crowding index, which is the ratio between the extraocular muscles and orbital fat volume and is based on coronal scans of the orbital apex. Two groups of orbits (with and without dysthyroid optic neuropathy) were compared. RESULTS: One hundred and two orbits of 61 patients with Graves' orbitopathy met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Forty-one orbits were diagnosed with Graves' orbitopathy, and 61 orbits did not have optic neuropathy. The two groups of orbits differed significantly with regard to both of the <b>volumetric</b> <b>indexes</b> (p< 0. 001).

The aim of the present evaluation {{was to assess the}} effect of severe MR on LA function, its potential relation with conventional surgical indications, and long-term postoperative survival. METHODS: Two-dimensional speckle-tracking strain and <b>volumetric</b> <b>indices</b> of LA reservoir, conduit, and contractile function were assessed in 121 patients with severe MR and 70 controls. Patients were divided according to the presence (n = 46) or absence (n = 75) of one or more guidelines-based criteria for mitral surgery (symptoms, left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 60 %, left ventricular end-systolic diameter ≥ 40 mm, atrial fibrillation, or systolic pulmonary arterial pressure > 50 mm Hg). RESULTS: In patients with severe MR compared with controls, significant LA reservoir and contractile dysfunction was observed, which was more pronounced {{in patients with}} mitral surgery indication (P <. 05 for all strain and <b>volumetric</b> <b>indices).</b> Of all indices of LA function, LA reservoir strain was an independent predictor (odds ratio, 0. 88; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 82 - 0. 94; P <. 001) and had the highest accuracy to identify patients with indications for mitral surgery (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0. 8; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 72 - 0. 87). A total of 117 patients underwent mitral valve surgery. Patients with LA reservoir strain ≤ 24 % showed worse survival at a median of 6. 4 years (interquartile range, 4. 7 - 8. 7 years) after mitral surgery (P =. 02), regardless the symptomatic status before surgery. LA reservoir strain, on top of mitral surgery indications, provided incremental predictive value for postoperative survival. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired LA reservoir strain in patients with severe organic MR relates to long-term survival after mitral valve surgery, independently of and incremental to current guidelines-based indications for mitral surgery.

40|$|International audienceThe age of {{emergence}} of the first molar (M 1) is a developmental event correlated with many variables of primate life history, such as adult brain size. The evolution of human life history {{is characterized by the}} inclusion of childhood, which takes place between weaning and M 1 emergence. Children still depend on adults for nutrition due to their small digestive system and their immature brains. By contrast, juveniles are not dependent because of M 1 emergence, which enables shifting to adult type diet, and attainment of nearly adult brain size. In this study, developmental connections between M 1 emergence and growth of cranial components were explored in two ways {{in order to understand the}} developmental basis of their evolutionary connections: (1) differences in growth trajectories of cranial components with respect to M 1 emergence and (2) differences between individuals with and without fully emerged M 1. Growth of anteroneural, midneural, posteroneural, otic, optic, respiratory, masticatory and alveolar cranial components was analysed in human skulls of individuals aged 0 - 20 years and in an adult reference skull. <b>Volumetric</b> <b>indices</b> were calculated to estimate size. Two subsamples were selected in order to focus on the transition between deciduous and permanent dentition: those with full deciduous dentition and before M 1 reaches the occlusal plane; and those who present M 1 in full emergence and no other cheek-tooth at the occlusal plane. The principal results were as follows. (1) Trajectories fitted using the whole sample are characterized by an inflection point that takes place before M 1 emergence for neural components and around M 1 emergence for facial components. (2) Associations between growth and age tend to be strong in those with full deciduous dentition, and weak in those who present M 1 in full emergence. (3) Individuals who present M 1 in full emergence are larger than those with full deciduous dentition. (4) Growth of components linked to the central nervous system is not linear until M 1 emergence. Individuals who present M 1 in full emergence are only larger than individuals with full deciduous dentition by 4 - 5 % of adult size.

The structural and functional state of the right heart was evaluated in progressive left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction by echocardiography. Results. In the acute period of infarction, remodeling processes occur in the left ventricle, with normal postload values, <b>volumetric</b> <b>indices</b> and right ventricular contractility are in the normal range.

Methods: Both cardiac CT and MRI were performed prior to pulmonary valve implantation (PVI) in 11 patients (median age, 19 years) who had undergone total correction of tetralogy of Fallot during infancy. The simplified contouring method (MRI) and semiautomatic 3 -dimensional region-growing method (CT) were used to measure ventricular volumes. Results: All <b>volumetric</b> <b>indices</b> measured by CT and MRI generally correlated well with each other, except for the left ventricular end-systolic volume index (LV-ESVI), which showed the following correlations with the other indices: the right ventricular end-diastolic volume index (RV-EDVI) (r= 0. 88, p＜ 0. 001), the right ventricular end-systolic volume index (RV-ESVI) (r= 0. 84, p= 0. 001), the left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (LV-EDVI) (r= 0. 90, p= 0. 001), and the LV-ESVI (r= 0. 55, p= 0. 079).

Forty-four pregnant Carthusian broodmares were divided into three age Groups: A (4 – 7 years; n = 18), B (8 – 12; n = 15) and C (13 – 17; n = 11). Jugular blood samples were taken every 14 days during pregnancy and data were pooled for each animal. The following hematological variables were determined: red blood cells (RBC), hemoglobin (HB), hematocrit (HCT), <b>volumetric</b> <b>indices,</b> white blood cells (WBC) and platelets (PLT). Furthermore, the numbers and percentages of lymphocytes (LYMP), band (BNL) and total neutrophils (NL), eosinophils (EOS), monocytes (MON), basophils (BAS) and the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (N/L) were counted on blood smears. Total serum protein concen-trations (TSP) were also measured. The lower values of RBC, WBC, LYMP and PLT in the older broodmares (Group C) possibly reflected a decline in bone marrow activity. The lower RBC of these mares was compensated by an increased MCV. The higher NL values in Group C, both BNL and NL, could have represented subclini-cal infections, since these animals also presented the highest TSP. Likewise, the animals of Group C showed the highest EOS counts. This research demonstrated that ageing significantly influences the hematological values of Carthusian broodmares, with the most marked differences in mares older than 13 years and that these physiologi-cal variations {{must be taken into account}} in a clinical context...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Stress {{echocardiography}} is used {{to diagnose}} myocardial dysfunction in horses, but current methods are not well standardized. The influence of heart rate (HR) on measurements is largely unknown. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the use of 2 -dimensional echocardiography (2 DE), anatomical M-mode (AMM), tissue Doppler imaging (TDI), and 2 D speckle tracking (2 DST) at rest and after exercise for quantification of regional and global left-ventricular (LV) function. ANIMALS: Five athletic Warmblood horses; 11. 6 +/- 3. 6 years; 529 +/- 48 kg. METHODS: Prospective study. Three separate echocardiographic examinations were performed before (baseline) and over 5 minutes after treadmill exercise with 2 DE (1 st, short-axis view; 2 nd, long-axis view) and pulsed-wave TDI (3 rd examination). Offline analyses were performed at baseline and after exercise at HR 120, 110, 100, 90, and 80 minute(- 1). Global and segmental measurements were compared by analysis of variance. RESULTS: Quantitative analyses of stress echocardiograms were feasible in all horses. None of the AMM indices changed significantly after exercise. Stroke volume and ejection fraction by 2 DE and strain by 2 DST decreased, whereas strain rate by 2 DST increased significantly at HR> 100 minute(- 1). TDI analyses were technically difficult and provided little additional information. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: <b>Volumetric</b> <b>indices</b> by 2 DE and strain and strain rate by 2 DST are applicable for quantitative assessment of stress echocardiograms. In healthy horses, they are significantly altered at a HR> 100 minute(- 1) {{and need to be}} evaluated in view of the instantaneous HR. Further investigations are needed to define the clinical value of stress echocardiography in horses with cardiac disea...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} geomorphological {{analysis}} of the recent extensional tectonics of a Quaternary continental basin in the Northern Apennines (Italy). The study area is focused on Upper Tiber Valley (UTV), a basin elongated for 70 km in NNW-SSE direction hosting the Tiber River. The area {{is characterized by a}} series of features that make it an excellent case study: (i) homogeneity of lithology (ii) active faults, and (iii) strong morphogenetic activity. In this study, 36 hydrographical basins, tributaries of Tiber River, have been analysed. A preliminary qualitative geomorphological setting was outlined pointing out that the drainage river network shows meaningful evidence of tectonic control, such as abrupt changes in stream directions, knickpoints and steepness anomalies alignments along meaningful length in adjacent basins. Besides, the tectonic control is well marked in base level changes and consequent tectonically induced downcutting. Signs of neotectonics are highlighted by structural landforms too. The entrenchment of alluvial fans, the triangular facets and the fault planes are mapped by field survey and aerial photo interpretation. In addition, a quantitative analysis was also performed. Linear, areal and <b>volumetric</b> <b>indexes</b> related to drainage basins and river networks are taken into account. The geometry of the escarpments delimiting the basin and the landforms detected along the adjacent piedmont are investigated. The ranges of values, according to the existing literature, confirm a condition of wide-ranging morphological disturbance. In {{the central part of the}} study area, while the western basins are almost in equilibrium, the eastern ones reveal clear signs of disequilibrium, this is particularly evident along the distal segment of the river network. These data, joined with the characteristics of the escarpment and piedmont junction, confirm that the neotectonic activity, in the centre and in the eastern side of the basin, is the main factor controlling the morphological system...|$|R
40|$|Main {{results of}} {{investigations}} on logistics {{activities in the}} Republic of Belarus at year-end 2016 are presented in the paper. The paper identifies and analyzes basic components of this activity {{on the basis of}} economic evaluation of indices presented in annual State statistical reporting on logistics and transport and freight forwarding activities of the Republican organizations according to form 1 -logistics (Mintrans – Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Republic of Belarus), a report of the Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Republic of Belarus on the results of the implementation of Republican Program for development of logistics systems and transit potential of the Republic of Belarus for the period of 2016 – 2020, World Bank reports on logistics performance index, some indices of logistics infrastructure position and also results of electronic questionnaire of the largest logistics centers of the Republic of Belarus. Methods of comparative analysis, generalization and economic analysis have been used in the process of research. The analysis has shown that a network of logistics centers with various specialization and forms of property are located and operating in all regions of the Republic of Belarus. Most of them are situated in the Minsk region near the II and IX trans-European transport corridors and in the Brest region near the border with Poland. Structure of the logistics centers includes temporary storage warehouses, customs warehouses, warehouses for general use, container terminals, car parking, customs clearance office, and automotive, railway and other cargo transport facilities. Indices of logistics activity in the Republic of Belarus demonstrate its development in 2016. Storage space of logistics centers and main financial and <b>volumetric</b> <b>indices</b> of logistics activity which are included in the State statistical reporting have been increased during in recent times. These facts testify to the demand for logistics capacity of the Republic of Belarus and its efficient economic and infrastructure development...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Areal {{bone mineral}} density is {{predictive}} for fracture risk. Microstructural bone parameters evaluated at the appendicular skeleton by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) display differences between healthy patients and fracture patients. With the simple {{geometry of the}} cortex at the distal tibial diaphysis, a cortical index of the tibia combining material and mechanical properties correlated highly with bone strength ex vivo. The trabecular bone score derived from the scan of the lumbar spine by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) correlated ex vivo with the micro architectural parameters. It is unknown if these microstructural correlations could be made in healthy premenopausal women. METHODS Randomly selected women between 20 - 40 years of age were examined by DXA and HR-pQCT at the standard regions of interest and at customized sub regions to focus on cortical and trabecular parameters of strength separately. For cortical strength, at the distal tibia the <b>volumetric</b> cortical <b>index</b> was calculated directly from HR-pQCT and the areal cortical index {{was derived from the}} DXA scan using a Canny threshold-based tool. For trabecular strength, the trabecular bone score was calculated based on the DXA scan of the lumbar spine and was compared with the corresponding parameters derived from the HR-pQCT measurements at radius and tibia. RESULTS Seventy-two healthy women were included (average age 33. 8 years, average BMI 23. 2 kg/m(2)). The areal cortical index correlated highly with the <b>volumetric</b> cortical <b>index</b> at the distal tibia (R  =  0. 798). The trabecular bone score correlated moderately with the microstructural parameters of the trabecular bone. CONCLUSION This study in randomly selected premenopausal women demonstrated that microstructural parameters of the bone evaluated by HR-pQCT correlated with the DXA derived parameters of skeletal regions containing predominantly cortical or cancellous bone. Whether these indexes are suitable for better predictions of the fracture risk deserves further investigation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundFluid {{resuscitation}} {{in early}} post-operative (PO) period after liver transplantation (LT) {{can be very}} detrimental for both graft and patient's outcome. Central venous pressure (CVP) was commonly used to guide fluid resuscitation after LT; yet, <b>volumetric</b> <b>indices</b> like stroke volume (SV) or right ventricular end diastolic volume (RVEDV) have gained more support recently. We tested the hypothesis that use {{of any of the}} three parameters to guide fluid therapy in the early PO period after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) will not elaborate any changes in fluid volumes infused or graft and patient outcome. Patients and methodsSixty patients undergoing LDLT allocated based on the parameter guiding the fluid therapy in the first 72 h in ICU into one of three groups, G-CVP (control), G-SV and G-RV groups 20 patients each using CVP, SVI and RVEDVI respectively to guide fluid therapy. Based on the guiding parameter assessed every 4 h, fluid therapy was administered as 500 ml boluses followed by reassessment of the guiding parameter for further fluid infusion. Fluids infused over three days in the ICU were used as a primary outcome. Hemodynamics, graft and renal functions, and graft and patient outcome were recorded as secondary objectives. ResultsCVP and PCWP were significantly higher in G-SV and G-RV compared to the CVP group while other hemodynamic parameters did not show significant differences between the groups. Fluid volume infused and urine output were significantly higher in G-SV and G-RV compared to G-CVP group. Laboratory and survival data did not differ among the studied groups. ConclusionThe use of the CVP to guide fluid infusion after LT is a safe and effective alternative to more logistically demanding techniques as SV and RVEDVI without any negative impact on patient hemodynamic or metabolic homeostasis...|$|R
40|$|Error {{characterization}} {{is vital}} {{for the advancement of}} precipitation algorithms, the evaluation of numerical model outputs, and their integration in various hydro-meteorological applications. The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) has been a benchmark for successive Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) based products. This has given way to the evolution of many multi-satellite precipitation products. This study evaluates the performance of the newly released multi-satellite Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP) product, whose temporal variability was determined based on several data products including TMPA 3 B 42 RT. The evaluation was conducted over India with respect to the IMD-gauge-based rainfall for pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post monsoon seasons at daily scale for a 35 -year (1979 – 2013) period. The rainfall climatology is examined over India and over four geographical extents within India known to be subject to uniform rainfall. The performance evaluation of rainfall time series was carried out. In addition to this, the performance of the product over different rainfall classes was evaluated along with the contribution of each class to the total rainfall. Further, seasonal evaluation of the MSWEP products was based on the categorical and <b>volumetric</b> <b>indices</b> from the contingency table. Upon evaluation it was observed that the MSWEP products show large errors in detecting the higher quantiles of rainfall (> 75 th and > 95 th quantiles). The MSWEP precipitation product available at a 0. 25 ° × 0. 25 ° spatial resolution and daily temporal resolution matched well with the daily IMD rainfall over India. Overall results suggest that a suitable region and season-dependent bias correction is essential before its integration in hydrological applications. While the MSWEP was observed to perform well for daily rainfall, it suffered from poor detection capabilities for higher quantiles, making it unsuitable for the study of extremes...|$|R
30|$|Cardiac output {{decreased}} in all groups. In IAP- 30 animals, <b>volumetric</b> preload <b>indices</b> significantly decreased, while those of IAP- 15 pigs {{did not differ}} from those of controls. Under IAH, the mean arterial pressure (MAP) in the IAP- 30 group declined, while MAP in the IAP- 15 group was significantly elevated (controls unchanged). PO 2 and PCO 2 remained unchanged. The grade of ischemic damage of the intestines (histopathologically quantified using the Park score) increased significantly with different IAH levels. Accordingly, the amount of translocated bacteria in intestinal wall specimens as well as in MLN significantly increased with the level of IAH. Lymph node cultures confirmed the relation between bacterial translocation (BT) and IAP. The most often cultivated species were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus, Clostridium, Pasteurella, and Streptococcus. Bacteremia was detected only occasionally in all three groups (not significantly different) showing gut-derived bacteria such as Proteus, Klebsiella, and E. coli spp.|$|R
30|$|Depending on {{the level}} of IAH, the {{circulation}} in study pigs was compromised as evidenced by the significant decrease in <b>volumetric</b> preload <b>indices</b> and signs of ongoing acidosis. Accordingly, base excess was found to correlate very strongly with GEDVI. As proven in former studies using different techniques (e.g., flowmeters, near infrared spectroscopy, laser Doppler flow measurement [37 – 42]), IAH indeed suppresses arterial perfusion as well as venous outflow of intra- and extra-abdominal organs, resulting in tissue ischemia [43]. In the present study, the limited circulation was mirrored by marked decreasing APP and RFG values. RFG was found to correlate very strongly with urine output. The amount of histomorphological damage of the intestines increased dramatically with different IAH levels. Other investigations found comparable hemodynamic changes [44] and ischemic damage in the bowel specimen of pigs exposed to IAH over at least 18 h [8, 9, 14, 45].|$|R
