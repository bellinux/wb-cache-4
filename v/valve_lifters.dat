50|$|Valve {{clearance}} {{refers to}} the small gap between a <b>valve</b> <b>lifter</b> and a <b>valve</b> stem that ensures that the valve completely closes. On engines with mechanical valve adjustment, excessive clearance causes noise from the valve train.

Typically, the clearance must be readjusted each 20000 mi with a feeler gauge.|$|R

2500|$|Milt Schornack joined Royal Pontiac {{and helped}} improve the {{performance}} enhancement package.

40|$|The {{amount of}} {{research}} in the area of mass transfer of air as a bubble in hydraulic fluid or lubricant is very limited. There are only a few studies on the interaction of oils with air, especially knowledge of air solubility of the oil and diffusivity of dissolved air in oil, namely aeration. This paper will study the effect of aeration on a direct acting hydraulic <b>valve</b> <b>lifter</b> system in an internal combustion engine. Aeration is, primarily, influenced by hydrodynamic factors such as, design features of the oil system and the physicochemical characteristics of the oil. The direct acting hydraulic <b>valve</b> <b>lifter</b> (DAHVL) was introduced to the automotive industry because of some definite advantages, such as acoustic improvement and friction reduction. Although, the aforementioned, advantages of DAHVL are significant, the aeration effect due to hydraulics creates a challenge. Aeration stems from compressibility of air in oil. It is a fact that the incompressibility of the oil hydraulically maintains all components of the valve train in contact. Therefore, aeration tends to create separation between the valve train components. This separation creates certain effects on the dynamic performance. This paper has concentrated on 3 major specifics: how oil aeration affects engine operation (via a linear math model compared to experimental data), a brief discussion on what variables inherent in the design could significantly improve the system 2 ̆ 7 s robustness to aeration effects (experimental only) and on what causes aeration (theory) ...|$|R

The viscosity changes caused by the engine temperature changes, the spring constant variations resulting from the deformations and the plunger-body radial clearance changes have been investigated.

50|$|In a {{piston engine}} {{configuration}} where the valves are overhead but the camshaft is not, informally called pushrod engine or I-head engine, the camshaft is placed within the cylinder block (usually beside and slightly above the crankshaft {{in a straight}} engine or directly above the crankshaft in the V of a V engine), and uses pushrods or rods to actuate rocker arms above the cylinder head to actuate the <b>valves.</b> <b>Lifters</b> or tappets {{are located in the}} engine block between the camshaft and pushrods. By contrast, overhead camshaft design avoids the use of pushrods by putting the camshaft directly above the valves in the cylinder head, thus simplifying the valvetrain.|$|R
2500|$|Sliding {{friction}} between {{the surface of the}} cam and the cam follower which rides upon it can be considerable. In order to reduce wear at this point, the cam and follower are both surface hardened, and modern lubricant motor oils contain additives specifically to reduce sliding friction. The lobes of the camshaft are usually slightly tapered and the faces of the <b>valve</b> <b>lifters</b> slightly domed, causing the lifters to rotate to distribute wear on the parts. The surfaces of the cam and follower are designed to [...] "wear in" [...] together, and therefore each follower should stay with its original cam lobe and never be moved to a different lobe. You can put new lifters on an old cam but never old lifters on a new cam. In some engines the followers have rollers which eliminate the sliding friction and wear but add mass to the valvetrain.|$|E

50|$|During the Isle of Man TT {{practice}} in 1928 two fast laps were attempted {{and it was}} rumoured that under certain conditions the lower front ends of the swinging-fork assembly grounded and possibly the centre stand as well.

The motorcycle was not used in the actual race and was returned to the Birmingham factory. Despite assurances that the journalist apparently received that the model would go straight into production after the TT, this never happened.

50|$|The {{earliest}} IOE layouts used atmospheric {{inlet valves}} which were held {{closed with a}} weak spring and were opened by the pressure differential created when the piston went down on the inlet stroke. This worked well with low-speed early engines and {{had the benefit of}} being very simple and cheap, but the weak spring was unable to close the valve fast enough as the RPM's of engines increased, necessitating stronger springs, which in turn needed direct mechanical action to open, as the atmospheric pressure of 15psi limits the total force available from creating a pressure differential, meaning that a 15-lb spring is the strongest that can be used (for practical purposes, {{it would have to be}} lighter still). When the limits of this system were reached, the design was improved without substantial changes to the head casting by adding a mechanical system to open the inlet valves and stronger springs to close them. In both cases, the exhaust valves were in the block and were opened by contact with a camshaft through a tappet or <b>valve</b> <b>lifter</b> and closed by springs.|$|R
5000|$|In a F-head/IOE engine, {{the intake}} {{manifold}} and its valves are located atop the cylinders, in the cylinder head, and are operated by rocker arms which reverse {{the motion of}} the pushrods so that the intake valves open downward into the combustion chamber. The exhaust manifold and its valves are located beside or as part of the cylinders, in the block. The exhaust valves are either roughly or exactly parallel with the pistons; their faces point upwards and they are not operated by separate pushrods, but by contact with a camshaft through the tappet or <b>valve</b> <b>lifter</b> and an integrated valve stem/pushrod. The valves were offset to one side, forming {{what seemed to be a}} pocket, leading to the term [...] "pocket valve" [...] being used for IOE engines. An F-head engine combines features from both overhead-valve and flathead type engines, the inlet valve operating via pushrod and rocker arm and opening downward like an overhead valve engine, while the exhaust valve is offset from the cylinder and opens upward via an integrated pushrod/valve stem directly actuated by the camshaft, much like the valves in a flathead engine.|$|R

The result from the finite element analysis is an approximate of the component failure. In the mean time, the software development is improving in this few decades.

50|$|Oil under {{constant}} pressure is supplied to the lifter via an oil channel, {{through a small}} hole in the lifter body. When the engine <b>valve</b> is closed (<b>lifter</b> in a neutral position), the lifter is free to fill with oil. As the camshaft lobe enters the lift phase of its travel, it compresses the lifter piston, and a valve shuts the oil inlet. Oil is nearly incompressible, so this greater pressure renders the lifter effectively solid during the lift phase.|$|R
