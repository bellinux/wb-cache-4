We have used different techniques to establish, with an accuracy of a few percent, the relationship between the electrical and mechanical properties of several commercial quartz tuning forks with fundamental resonant frequency similar to 32 kHz. The velocity is usually inferred from an electro-mechanical calibration that models a quartz prong as a clamped, rectangular cantilever beam. We have tested the accuracy of this calibration using three methods: measurement of the amplitude at which the fork prongs touch each other; direct optical measurement of the moving fork prongs using strobe microscopy; and a Michelson interferometry technique operating with a 670 nm laser. All three methods yield consistent results. The velocity so determined is found to be 10 % lower than that of the standard electro-mechanical calibration...|$|R

50|$|Another {{reason for}} using the fork shape is that, when it vibrates in its {{principal}} mode, the handle vibrates {{up and down as}} the prongs move apart and together. There is a node (point of no vibration) at the base of each prong. The handle motion is small, allowing the fork to be held by the handle without damping the vibration, but it allows the handle to transmit the vibration to a resonator, which amplifies the sound of the fork. The fork is usually struck, and then the handle is pressed against a wooden box resonator, or a table top. Without the resonator the sound of a tuning fork is very faint. The {{reason for this is that}} the sound waves produced by each fork prong are 180° out of phase with the other, so at a distance from the fork they interfere and largely cancel each other out. If a sound absorbing sheet is slid in between the prongs of a <b>vibrating</b> <b>fork,</b> reducing the waves reaching the ear from one prong, the volume heard will actually increase, due to a reduction of this cancellation.|$|R
50|$|Vibrating Element Transducers: This type of {{instrument}} {{requires a}} vibrating element {{to be placed in}} contact with the fluid of interest. The resonant frequency of the element is measured and is related to the density of the fluid by a characterization that is dependent upon the design of the element. In modern laboratories precise measurements of relative density are made using oscillating U-tube meters. These are capable of measurement to 5 to 6 places beyond the decimal point and are used in the brewing, distilling, pharmaceutical, petroleum and other industries. The instruments measure the actual mass of fluid contained in a fixed volume at temperatures between 0 and 80 °C but as they are microprocessor based can calculate apparent or true relative density and contain tables relating these to the strengths of common acids, sugar solutions, etc. The <b>vibrating</b> <b>fork</b> immersion probe is another good example of this technology.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{optimisation}} of the mechanical behaviour of a tuning fork microgyrometer, aimed at improving its performance. Two different configurations of the instrument have been analysed and compared, the ‘wide gap’ design and ‘narrow gap’ design. In the former case the air gap between the <b>vibrating</b> <b>forks</b> and the flat substrate is so large that the air flow around each fork is not influenced by the substrate presence. This geometrical configuration results in a very low air damping, that allows the instrument to operate at atmospheric pressure. In the ‘narrow gap’ case {{the distance between the}} forks and the substrate is instead very small. As a consequence, the instrument needs to operate under very low pressure conditions. Although this requirement represents a drawback of the narrow gap solution, we have found out that this instrument configuration, when compared to the wide gap design, allows to achieve a significantly smaller dynamic error and a significantly wider range of linearity. The thickness of the air gap represents, indeed, an additional parameter that can be adjusted by the designer to optimise the performances of the instrument. We have developed an accurate analytical model of the sensor, focusing, in particular, the attention on the two tines of the drive mode, which are the structural components that more than others influence the performance of the whole instrument. The optimal design of these fundamental elements can be, indeed, carried out neglecting the interaction with the remaining part of the sensor structure. We have more over performed a 3 D FEM analysis of the sensor structure to validate some of the assumptions introduced in the formulation. In this paper we show how to utilise the model as a helpful designing tool for this kind of device and, in particular, how to design the instrument to minimise the amplitude error...|$|R

40|$|We analyse the {{performances}} of two different configurations of a tuning fork microgyrometer, the so called 'wide gap' design and 'narrow gap' design. In the former case the air gap between the <b>vibrating</b> <b>forks</b> and {{the walls of the}} surrounding frame is so large that the air flow around each fork is not influenced by the presence of the frame itself. This geometrical configuration results in a very low air damping, and, hence, allows the instrument to operate at atmospheric pressure. In the case of 'narrow gap' design the distance between the forks and the frame walls is instead very small. As a consequence, the instrument needs to operate under very low pressure conditions, since, at higher pressures, the presence of a thin layer of air would increase the air damping to very large values, and would not allow the correct operation of the instrument. Although the requirement of low pressure conditions represents a drawback of the narrow gap solution, we show that this instrument configuration, when compared to the wide gap design, allows to achieve a significantly smaller dynamic error and a significantly wider range of linearity. Indeed the thickness of the air gap represents an additional parameter that can be adjusted by the designer to optimise {{the performances}} of the instrument.

40|$|VoIP {{call routing}} {{involves}} {{all the necessary}} tasks that a VoIP provider must perform in order to setup incoming calls from subscribers. Technology and regulatory developments allow the existence of multiple alternative ways (signalling servers) for routing a call, each one with certain attributes (for example cost, availability and call quality). This dissertation applies techniques from Operational Research and Communication Systems Evaluation. We propose and analyze policies and strategies for VoIP providers that can achieve optimal call routing by considering the expected profit from each successful call. An interesting aspect of these routing policies is the consideration of the time a caller is willing to wait until hearing the ring tone of a pending call. This characteristic allows a provider to make several attempts in order to connect a specific call. The first routing policy proposed is called 'Sequential' and suggests forwarding a call to a single signalling server each time, but allowing redials in case a previously contacted signalling server was found blocked. We propose conditions, that under some assumptions, result in optimal call routing; that is {{the selection of the}} optimal signalling server each time. The second routing policy proposed is called 'Forking' and is more generic than Sequential in the sense that allows forwarding a call request to multiple signalling servers. This policy takes advantage of a very interesting aspect of serving a call, the fact that whatever the number of providers attempting to setup a call only one of them will be able to reserve all necessary resources along the signalling path. This characteristic separates our optimization problem from similar problems found in the related work, as well as makes these routing strategies more attractive for VoIP providers. We also study the impact of Forking policy to the set of VoIP providers and owners of signalling servers. We conclude that there are cases where VoIP providers have the incentive to follow a very aggressive strategy with respect to the number of signalling servers used for each call and in relation to the socially optimum <b>forking</b> <b>level.</b> This results to the appearance of a Tragedy of the Commons type of problem. We propose an incentive mechanism that prompts VoIP providers to limit their <b>forking</b> <b>level</b> to the socially optimum. The proposed mechanism is the introduction of a signalling charge for each call setup that is attempted by a signalling server. ...|$|R

The {{need for}} new environrnentally {{acceptable}} refrigerants, with low or zero ozone depletion potential and low global warming potential, led the industrial and the scientific community to launch a significant research effort on the thermophysical properties of these compounds. It {{is the purpose of}} this paper to give an overall view of the current research in this field, started in 1990 by our group, in collaboration with the LIMHPCNRS, Villetaneuse, France, and the NIST, Boulder, USA. The effort has been concentrated in developing equipments to measure density dielectric constant and thermal conductivity in the liquid phase, covering the temperature and pressure ranges necessary for the normal duty of these fluids. The dielectric constant and the thermal conductivity of three provisional replacements, HCFC 123, HCFC 141 b, HCFC 142 b and two c 1 ass A fluids, HFC 134 a and HFC 152 a, have been measured in the temperature range 200 to 300 K and pressures up to 20 MPa, using a direct capacitance method, by measuring the capacitance of a cylinder filled with the sample and in vacuum, using an impedance analyzer, and the polarized hot wire technique. The density of HCFC 142 b, HCFC 22 + HCFC 142 b and HCFC 14 lb was measured with a <b>vibrating</b> <b>fork</b> densimeter, calibrated with toluene, 2, 2, 4 -trimethylpentane and vacuum.
