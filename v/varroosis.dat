A high proportion of the mites disappeared from artificially infested brood cells without damage to the pupae. The opening of the cell and the removal of the bee brood are independent traits of a graded response by adult workers towards mite-infested brood cells. We found a higher between-colony variation in the reaction towards Varroa-infested brood of Africanized honey bees compared to Carniolans.

However, a significant difference in the spatial distribution of DWV between asymptomatic and crippled bees could be demonstrated: when analysing head, thorax and abdomen of crippled bees, all body parts were always strongly positive for viral sequences.

40|$|Varroa mites are vectors {{for several}} bee viruses {{contributing}} also to their diffusion worldwide (Martin 2001; Di Prisco et al. 2011; Cersini et al. 2013). The tripartite relationship among bees, mites, and viruses {{is thought to}} be responsible for the loss of a large amount of colonies (Highfield et al. 2009; Berthoud et al. 2010; Francis et al. 2013). Before the arrival of Varroa destructor, virus prevalence was lower (Martin et al. 2012). The mites have contributed to spread the viruses which could be correlated to the high number of mite-infested honey bee colony losses (Berthoud et al. 2010; Francis et al. 2013). Since the varroa mite arrival, control of <b>varroosis</b> has become necessary (Moritz et al. 2010). Such control is focused on the coexistence between honeybees and mites.

40|$|The {{environment}} and agriculture {{depend on a}} wide variety of pollinating species, including 20, 000 species of hymenoptera, the most important being the domestic honey bee (Apis mellifera). Worldwide, the annual value of this ecological service is estimated to be in excess of a hundred billion dollars. Since 1997, numerous eye-witness accounts and published articles have reported an apparent weakening and mortality of bee colonies in various countries around the world. The beekeeping profession estimates that national production of honey fell by 20 to 30 % between 1997 and 2009. The depopulation observed in apiaries is sometimes severe, leading to a reduction in honey production in the same proportion as the reduction in the number of bees. The weakening that occurs at the end of the beekeeping year may also result in a higher frequency of mortalities in winter. One can define six categories of causes of mortality of bee colonies: – bee diseases and parasites; – chemical products; – the environment; – beekeeping practices; – agricultural practices; – treatment of <b>varroosis.</b> Bee diseases and parasites The pathogens responsible for diseases and parasitic infestations are predators: parasites, fungi, bacteria and viruses. To date, there are 29 known pathogens of bees. This precise figure is based on numerous bibliographic references, including recent studies on the decline of bee populations. While all of them have the potential to cause mortality of bee colonies, some have been highlighted in the most recent investigations into the phenomenon of weakening, collapse and mortality of bee colonies, either individually or in association with others.

Six mixed colonies were made with Italian and Africanized honey bees. The percentage infestation by this parasite was found to be significantly lower in adult Africanized (1. 69 ± 0. 44) than Italian bees (2. 79 ± 0. 65). This ratio was similar to that found in Mexico, even though the Africanized bees tested there had not been in contact with varroa, compared to more than 20 years of the coexistence in Brazil. However, mean mite infestation in Brazil on both kinds of bees was only about a third of that found in Mexico.

For the determination of mortality, dead honey bee traps were placed in front of the experimental hives entrance located in areas of intensive agriculture in Valencian Community (Spain). A total of 34 bee samples, obtained along the monitoring period, were analyzed by means of QuEChERS extraction method and screened for 58 pesticides or their degradation products by LC-MS/MS. An average of four pesticides per honey bee sample was detected. Coumaphos, an organophosphate acaricide used against <b>varroosis</b> in the experimental hives, was detected in 94 % of the samples. However, this acaricide was unlikely to be responsible for honey bee mortality because its constantly low concentration during all the monitoring period, even before and after acute mortality episodes. The organophosphates chlorpyrifos and dimethoate, as well as the neonicotinoid imidacloprid, were the most frequently detected agrochemicals. Almost 80 % of the samples had chlorpyrifos, 68 % dimethoate, and 32 % imidacloprid. Maximum concentrations for these three compounds were 751, 403, 223. ng/g respectively.

40|$|The {{parasitic}} disease <b>Varroosis</b> in colonies of Apis mellifera {{caused by the}} mite Varroa destructor {{is one of the}} biggest problems in beekeeping. In order to keep the number of mites below the injury level and avoid spreading throughout the hive, beekeepers have to treat their colonies against <b>Varroosis</b> on a regular basis. Oxalic acid represents one of the main active components in medical treatments. By the use of sugar water as carrier substance it cannot be excluded that the bees ingest the syrup and the acaricide. This can lead to bee mortality, because of the oral toxicity of oxalic acid, and could increase possible effects of the acid. The purpose of this study was to determine the sublethal effects of the conventional treatment with oxalic acid dehydrate in sugar water (OAS) and also in combination with the sugar substitute glycerol 45 % (OAG) on a colony level and the individual bee in a wide range. For all experiments, excluding the residue detections in the colonies, bees were treated individually in the laboratory with 5 µl of OAS and OAG, respectively, ventral on the abdomen (dosage of oxalic acid dehydrate: 175 µg/bee). Controls received glycerol 45 % (G) or sugar water (S). In this work many different parameters were investigated: to find changes in the feeding behavior the crop, midgut and rectum were weighted (n= 80) and the individual food uptake was determined (n= 125). The bees’ sensitivity to water and ascending concentrations of sucrose solution (ACSS) was tested using the proboscis extension response (n= 100). Motoric activity was investigated in an open-field-like apparatus, standing vertically and illuminated from above (n= 40). In an observation hive the behavior and longevity of treated bees under field-like conditions was recorded. In addition, longevity was also investigated under laboratory conditions (n= 100). The flight behavior (uptake and home coming) was examined using radio frequency identification (n= 100). In addition to the investigation of sublethal effects, residues of oxalic acid on individual bees and hive material were determined optically under a binocular and quantitatively using enzymatic reaction (n= 60). With computed tomography the distribution of oxalic acid was visualized and the density of bees was measured (n≤ 600). The treatment with oxalic acid in both formulations caused sublethal effects on Apis mellifera. These could be demonstrated in changed feeding behavior, an increased sensitivity to water, changes in flight behavior and decreased longevity. On motoric activity and phototactic behavior the treatment seemed to have no effect. Effects on the in-hive behavior, could not be detected for the formulation oxalic acid in glycerol. The increased sensitivity on water 24 h after treatment (p≤ 0. 004; Mc Nemar’s Test) indicates an acidosis of the bees, which they compensated with an increased uptake of water. This could also explain the increased uptake of sugar water in the individual feedings (p≤ 0. 005, H≥ 20, DF= 3, Kruskal-Wallis One Way ANOVA on Ranks). In contrast, the feeding on solid food, like sugar dough, was decreased (p≤ 0. 001, H≥ 72. 609, DF= 3, Kruskal-Wallis One Way ANOVA on Ranks). The changes in flight behavior appeared in a decreased flight-rate seven days after treatment (p≤ 0. 03, t≥ 2. 83, paired t-test) and a decreased proportion of bees showing flight activity (p≤ 0. 043, z≥ 2. 024, z-test). Along with the decreased longevity in the laboratory (p≤ 0. 001, statistics= 355. 577, DF= 3, Kaplan-Meier Survival Analysis Gehan-Breslow) and observation hive (p≤ 0. 003, statistics= 11. 852, DF= 2, Kaplan-Meier Survival Analysis Gehan-Breslow), these results indicate a general impairment of the bees after treatment, which can vary in its’ extend and could not be detected in all trials. The exact mode of action of the oxalic acid on the bee is yet unproven. However, it seems improbable that the effects are caused through an oral uptake by the bees, since impairments could also be found for the combination with glycerol. This would support Nozal’s assumption that oxalic acid penetrates the cuticle of bees and could be an explanation for the increased mortality of young bees in this study (p≤ 0. 033, z≥ 2. 131, z-Test), which are more sensitive to a treatment due to their softer cuticle. Beside these effects an increased grooming behavior after application was observed for both formulations (p≤ 0. 009, H≥ 13. 398, DF= 4, Kruskal-Wallis One Way ANOVA on Ranks) which lasted longer in the OAS group. Oxalic acid in glycerol formed a wet film around the abdomen and distributed evenly. In contrast, the formulation with sugar water formed crystals when drying which could be found on the bees’ body surface and could have provoked the prolonged selfgrooming of the OAS bees. The visualization of oxalic acid distribution with computed tomography showed an increased density of the individual bee up to 14 days after treatment with OAS and OAG resp. (p≤ 0. 001, H≥ 195. 198, DF= 3, Kruskal-Wallis One Way ANOVA on Ranks) indicating the presence of oxalic acid at least up to this point. In addition, residues of oxalic acid could be detected up to two weeks on the individual bee and up to five weeks on hive material using enzymatic reaction. This implies possible exposure of bees to oxalic acid in the hive even long after a treatment. Oxalic acid is used in November/December and affects primarily long living winter bees which are essential for overwinter survival and a successful colony development in spring. In this study a reduced longevity could also be observed under field-like conditions, in the observation hive and the examination of flight behavior. However, it is possible, that the extent of this effect is weakened on vital bees treated in the hive due to the capability of the colony to buffer negative effects to a certain level. The sublethal effects of oxalic acid on Apis mellifera demonstrated in this study can impair the health of the bee colony since an affection of the individual will always have an effect on the whole group. These adverse effects are in contrast with the high efficacy of the oxalic acid application in the hive. The benefits of the treatment clearly predominate the drawbacks. Alternative compounds have considerable disadvantages compared to oxalic acid. The findings of this study can help to estimate the effects of the treatment on the colony and to initiate an improvement of this vetenary drug. Without a colony treatment against the parasite Varroa destructor the conservation and survival of Apis mellifera is not possible...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effects of}} the varroacidal active ingredients oxalic acid dihydrate and hop beta acids on the honeybee Apis mellifera and the pathogens causing Nosemosis, Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae. The conservation of the honeybee has exceptional ecological and economic importance and the treatment of honeybee colonies with veterinary medicines is essential. Colony infestation with the parasitic mite Varroa destructor causes colony collapse within 2 - 3 years unless the colonies are treated regularly. The varroacides oxalic acid and beta acids are highly effective but the effect on the individual honeybee (e. g. pH-value of parts of the intestine and hemolymph) in low sublethal doses has not been studied sufficiently. There is also the assumption that the use of organic acids to combat <b>Varroosis</b> will reduce the prevailance of Nosemosis in honeybee colonies. The tolerance of oxalic acid is described for the dermal and oral application on individually treated honeybees. A dose-response was tested for the following doses: 175 µg, 212, 5 µg, 250 µg, 375 µg and 500 µg/bee after dermal application; 10 µg, 50 µg, 75 µg, 80 µg and 100 µg/bee after oral application. Beta acid were also tested in a dose-depended study: 6 µg, 12, 5 µg, 25 µg, 37, 5 µg and 50 µg/bee after dermal application; 50 µg, 75 µg and 100 µg/bee after oral application. The bee mortality was monitored in intervals of 24, 48 and 72 hours. The dermal application of oxalic acid was well tolerated in a dose up to 212, 5 µg/bee. Increased bee mortality was documented exceeding 25 % in the highest doses. The oral application was not very well tolerated. It resulted in a dose-dependent mortality with a peak at 55 % when applying 100 µg oxalic acid/bee. Beta acids showed low bee toxicity in doses up to 50 µg/bee after dermal application. The oral application of beta acids caused increased bee mortality in all tested dosages. Honeybees kept in the laboratory were treated individually (oral and dermal) with sublethal doses of oxalic acid and beta acids. The pH-value measurement of the intestinal parts (crop, ventriculus, rectum) and hemolymph was conducted in 24 hour intervals. To define the physiological pH-value (“standard”) of the organs, honeybees were analysed subsequently to the sampling of the colony. The physiological pH-values of the honeybee intestinal parts and hemolymph were derived as a standard: crop pH 5. 21, ventriculus pH 6. 55, rectum pH 5. 04, hemolymph pH 6. 72. The treatment with oxalic acid resulted in reduced pH-values of the contents of the crop, the ventriculus (significantly at 48 and 72 hours), the rectum (significantly at 48 and 72 hours) and the hemolymph (significantly at 24 and 72 hours). The treatment with beta acids resulted in increased pH-values of the contents of the crop (significantly at 48 hours), the ventriculus (significantly at 24 hours), the rectum (significantly at 24 hours) and significantly changed pH-values of the hemolymph (at 24 and 72 hours). The infection level of honeybees with Nosema spp. was observed in the laboratory for 35 days after the treatment with oxalic acid and beta acids. In a field experiment nucleus colonies were infected with Nosema spores and treated with the products Oxuvar® (active ingredient: oxalic acid) and HopGuard® (active ingredient: beta acids). The infection level was observed for 25 days by means of individual bee sampling. The application of oxalic acid and beta acids to Nosema diseased bees resulted in a reduced count 8 days post treatment in both test groups compared to the untreated control group. One colony treated with HopGuard® indicated a temporary inhibition of Nosema infection. The individual treatment of honeybees with oxalic acid and beta acids changed the pH-value of the intestinal parts and the hemolymph. The shift towards stronger acidity after oxalic acid treatment confirms that damage to the epithelial tissue and organs is caused by hyperacidity. There is evidence that the growth of the microsporidia Nosema spp. is inhibited; while not preventing the Nosema dispersal in the colony completely it would allow the beekeeper to introduce appropriate remedial measures...|$|E
