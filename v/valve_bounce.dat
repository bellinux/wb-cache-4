50|$|<b>Valve</b> <b>bounce</b> is {{a related}} {{condition}} where the valve does not stay seated, {{due to the}} combined effects of the valve's inertia and resonance of metallic valve springs that reduce the closing force, and allow the valve to re-open partially.|$|E
50|$|Stiffer {{valve springs}} {{can help prevent}} valve float and <b>valve</b> <b>bounce,</b> but only {{at the expense of}} {{increased}} friction losses and higher stresses in the valvetrain. Various techniques have been used to offset the effect of stiffer springs, such as dual-spring and progressive-sprung valves, roller-tipped tappets, and pneumatic valve springs.|$|E
5000|$|Early {{air-cooled}} ohv BMW boxer motorcycle engines {{had long}} pushrods {{and a single}} centrally-mounted camshaft; but the post-1992 BMW R259 [...] "Oilhead" [...] boxer engines had a camshaft in each cylinder head, located between the combustion chamber and the rocker arms. The pushrods were very short, allowing higher rpm and more power. For instance, the BMW R1100S (which had a R259 engine) could achieve an output of [...] at 8,400 rpm, with no risk of <b>valve</b> <b>bounce.</b> [...] Since 2013, BMW flat-twin motorcycle engines have had OHC valve actuation.|$|E
50|$|This drop in {{pressure}} upon valve closure {{also helps to}} avoid the effects of water hammer within the delivery pipe. This can, if uncontrolled, cause the injector <b>valve</b> to <b>bounce</b> upon its seat and encourage dribble, or even to cause work hardening and eventual fracture to the pipework.|$|R
25|$|Firstly the pop valves were a type used in industry; {{secondly}} the dead-weight type {{could be}} held down (so it would never work properly); and thirdly a dead-weight <b>valve</b> tends to <b>bounce</b> and thus waste steam.|$|R
5000|$|Safety valve: used {{to relieve}} {{pressure}} and prevent possible explosion of a boiler. As originally devised by Denis Papin {{it was a}} dead weight {{on the end of}} an arm that was lifted by excess steam pressure. This type of valve was used throughout the 19th century for stationary steam engines, however the vibrations of locomotive engines caused the <b>valves</b> to <b>bounce</b> and [...] "fizzle" [...] wasting steam. They were therefore replaced by various spring-loaded devices.|$|R
50|$|A {{multi-valve}} engine design typically has three, four, or five valves per cylinder to achieve improved performance. Any four-stroke {{internal combustion engine}} needs at least two valves per cylinder: one for intake of air and fuel, and another for exhaust of combustion gases. Adding more valves increases valve area and improves the flow of intake and exhaust gases, thereby enhancing combustion, volumetric efficiency, and power output. Multi-valve geometry allows the spark plug to be ideally located within the combustion chamber for optimal flame propagation. Multi-valve engines tend to have smaller valves that have lower reciprocating mass, which can reduce wear on each cam lobe, and allow more power from higher RPM without the danger of <b>valve</b> <b>bounce.</b> Some engines are designed to open each intake valve at a slightly different time, which increases turbulence, improving the mixing of air and fuel at low engine speeds. More valves also provide additional cooling to the cylinder head. The disadvantages of {{multi-valve engine}}s are an increase in manufacturing cost and a potential increase in oil consumption due to the greater number of valve stem seals. Some SOHC multi-valve engines (such as the Mazda B8-ME) use a single fork-shaped rocker arm to drive two valves (generally the exhaust valves) so that fewer cam lobes will be {{needed in order to}} reduce manufacturing costs.|$|E
5000|$|The Humber was also, at launch, {{fitted with}} a high tune version of the 1,592 cc and, from September 1965, 1,725 cc {{oversquare}} engine producing [...] and [...] respectively. Early models with the 1,592 cc engine had twin single Zenith downdraught carburettors - later 1,592/1,725 cc engines used a Solex twin choke downdraught carburettor for simplicity. The twin Zenith carburettors had been hard to keep balanced. Other modifications included a water-jacketed inlet manifold, timing adjustments and stronger valve springs to eliminate <b>valve</b> <b>bounce</b> at high engine speeds. The later H120's [...] engine is a straight swap for both of these units and looks almost identical - it provides a useful boost in power to an already swift automobile. The unique Sceptre interior featured full instrumentation, including a tachometer marked up to 6,000 rpm, and a four-speed floor-mounted transmission with self-cancelling overdrive (with column-mounted control and indicator) on third and fourth gear {{for a total of}} six separate ratios in standard form. The lockout could be removed on first and second gears, and this was often done by Rootes in cars used for competitions such as rallying. In addition, the Sceptre was from the beginning provided with servo-assisted braking control and, unusually in 1963, 10-inch front disc-brakes. The Marks 1 and 1A were not available with an automatic option - although this was rectified with the Mark II cars, using a three-speed unit with automatic kick-down. This was a cheaper option than was usual at the time due to the deletion of the Laycock De Normanville overdrive fitted to the Manual cars.|$|E

40|$|Present work descries {{the effect}} of {{in-cylinder}} pressure in turbocharged gasoline engine, on valvetrain analysis. Consideration of cylinder pressure gives corrected stresses and also it gives scope for reduction in moving masses in valvetrain. Reduction in moving mass and valve spring stiffness has significant impact in valvetrain kinematics & dynamics. These parameters are analysed in detail in this work. Initially, kinematic and dynamic analysis on the benchmark three cylinder naturally aspirated engine valve train is performed. The impacts of in cylinder pressure (P-ÆŸ) on kinematic parameters are analysed. The boundary conditions are modified suitable to TCIC engine and the impact on valvetrain kinematic parameters such as valve lift, velocity, acceleration, contact stress between cam and follower at idle speed and high speed, inertia and spring force safety factor, dynamic valve lift and <b>valve</b> <b>bouncing</b> are analysed & tabulated. These analyses revealed that there is the scope to reduce the contact stresses by 5 % at least. Further optimization of the valvetrain masses and stiffness {{to bring down the}} stress levels of turbocharged engine is performed. Valvetrain kinematic and dynamic analyses are being simulated in 1 D analysis software AVL-EXCITE...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A newly {{designed}} injector is presented high pressure common rail system. The whole injector system {{was seen as}} a single degree of freedom linear system and the dynamic equation of the system was established. And the equation was solved for the expression of throttle <b>valve</b> opening without <b>bounce</b> between needle <b>valve</b> and valve body. The analysis on the impact of the <b>bounce</b> to the <b>valve</b> opening effect is gained through initial velocity, and a large bounce with small damping will get stronger which cannot curb anymore...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a multibody {{model of}} a car engine valve train system was developed, by using LMS Virtual. Lab software, in order to analyse its {{resonant}} vibrational behaviour. The model complexity {{is the result of}} a compromise between the need to obtain accurate results (with acceptable run times) and the requirement of an easy integration of subcomponent models into a virtual assembly. The cam-follower contact was modelled using appropriate tools of the adopted code (Generator Cam, Cam Contact). Model validation was realised by comparing the kinematic laws of the valve motion, obtained from the numerical simulation, against those obtained from the experimental tests performed by FCA Group. Then, the dynamics of the valve train system was analysed, applying a ramp to the crankshaft with a variable engine speed (1, 000 to 6, 000 rpm) and considering the motion unsmoothness deriving from the inertia and combustion pressure loads. The camshaft is considered rigidly connected to the crankshaft by a mechanism with a transmission ratio equal to 0. 5. Such analyses allow to assess the <b>valve</b> <b>bounce,</b> the disengagement phenomena of the cam-follower system, the resultant forces acting on the camshaft bearings, and the resisting torque on the camshaft...|$|E
