The existence of this surface was announced in our paper in Bulletin of the AMS, 29 (1) : 77 [...] 84, 1993. Its ends in the quotient are asymptotic to one full turn of the helicoid, and, like the helicoid, it contains a vertical line. Modulo <b>vertical</b> <b>translations,</b> it has two parallel horizontal lines crossing the vertical axis.

50|$|Often, {{vertical}} translations {{are considered}} for the graph of a function. If f is any function of x, then the graph of the function f(x) + c (whose values are given by adding a constant c {{to the values of}} f) may be obtained by a <b>vertical</b> <b>translation</b> of the graph of f(x) by distance c. For this reason the function f(x) + c is sometimes called a vertical translate of f(x). For instance, the antiderivatives of a function all differ from each other by a constant of integration and are therefore vertical translates of each other.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, two {{measures}} of uncertainty for interval type- 2 fuzzy sets are presented, evaluated, compared and contrasted. Wu and Mendel regard {{the length of}} the type-reduced set as a measure of the uncertainty in an interval set. Green eld and John argue that the volume under the surface of the type- 2 fuzzy set {{is a measure of the}} uncertainty relating to the set. For an interval type- 2 fuzzy set, the volume measure is equivalent to the area of the footprint of uncertainty of the set. Experiments show that though the {{two measures}} give di erent results, there is considerable commonality between them. The concept of invariance under <b>vertical</b> <b>translation</b> is introduced; the uncertainty measure of a fuzzy set has the property of invariance under <b>vertical</b> <b>translation</b> if the value it generates remains constant under any <b>vertical</b> <b>translation</b> of the fuzzy set.

Thus each car body has six degrees of freedom which is commonly adopted by the researchers [23].

As the derivative of a constant is zero, x2 {{will have an}} infinite number of antiderivatives, such as x3/3, x3/3 + 1, x3/3 - 2, etc. Thus, all the antiderivatives of x2 can be obtained by changing the value of C in F(x) = x3/3 + C; where C is an arbitrary constant known as the constant of integration. Essentially, the graphs of antiderivatives of a given function are <b>vertical</b> <b>translations</b> of each other; each graph's vertical location depending upon the value of C.|$|R

40|$|Examples of {{complete}} minimal surfaces properly embedded in H^ 2 x R have been extensively studied and the literature contains {{a plethora of}} nontrivial ones. In this paper we construct a large class of examples {{of complete}} minimal surfaces embedded in H^ 2 x R, not necessarily proper, which are invariant by a <b>vertical</b> <b>translation</b> or by a hyperbolic or parabolic screw motion. In particular, we construct a large family of non-proper complete minimal disks embedded in H^ 2 x R invariant by a <b>vertical</b> <b>translation</b> and a hyperbolic screw motion and whose importance is twofold. They have finite total curvature in the quotient of H^ 2 x R by the isometry, thus highlighting a different behaviour from minimal surfaces embedded in R^ 3 satisfying the same properties.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the mechanism underlying the reported nonlinear at-rest coefficient of earth pressure, K 0 of clays at high pressure, a particle-scale model {{which can be used}} to calculate vertical and horizontal repulsion between clay particles has been proposed. This model has two initial states which represent the clays at low pressure and high pressure, and the particles in this model can undergo rotation and <b>vertical</b> <b>translation.</b> The computation shows that the majority of particles in a clay sample at high pressure state would experience rotation during one-dimensional compression. In addition, rotation of particles which tends to form a parallel structure causes an increase of the horizontal interparticle force, while <b>vertical</b> <b>translation</b> leads to a decrease in it. Finally, the link between interparticle force, microstructure, and macroscopic K 0 is analyzed and {{it can be used to}} interpret well the nonlinear changes in K 0 with both vertical consolidation stress and height-diameter ratio...|$|E

These parts can be used incrementally-individually, as a relational/functional compilation laboratory, or batch-composed, as a complete RELFUN compiler. All intermediate steps employ explicit declarative representations, which can be displayed via RELFUN's user interface.

40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{experimental}} {{study on the}} robustness of the eigenfaces method for face recognition. To build a face recognition system, especially in an unconstrained surveillance system where a clear, direct, and normalized view of the face cannot be assumed, one needs to implement several image preprocessing steps like segmentation, deskewing, zooming, rotation, warping, etc., before processing the face image per se. Our aim is to determine how efficient these preprocessing steps must be in order to apply the eigenfaces method with success. The experiments are conducted on {{a subset of the}} AR-face color image database. Real images are used and altered synthetically to study the effects of 7 parameters that can be translated into corresponding preprocessing artifacts: horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>translations,</b> downsampling, zooming, rotation, morphing and lighting...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—When {{a person}} walks the head {{undergoes}} {{horizontal and vertical}} rotations, and also horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>translations.</b> To visually fixate on an object while walking, compensatory horizontal and vertical eye movements must be made. Our model for this gaze (head plus eye) control system includes three types of eye movements: smooth pursuit, saccadic, and vestibulo-ocular. The smooth pursuit system uses a target-selective adaptive controller (TSAC) that compensates for the large inherent time delay and produces zero-latency tracking of predictable targets. Target movements were selected to minimize {{the role of the}} saccadic control system. Typical tracking is shown while seated with the head restrained, standing with unrestrained head, performing voluntary head rotations, and walking. Each additional degree of freedom produced additional head movements that were compensated by additional eye movements. It is shown that while a human walks the effects of head rotations (yaw) cancel the effects of head translations, thus minimizing the resulting horizontal eye rotations necessary to maintain fixation.
