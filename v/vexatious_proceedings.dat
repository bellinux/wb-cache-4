"SIR,--I {{think you}} have {{suffered}} enough for faults which, I believe, do not lie with you, so much as your wife; and I have withdrawn my claims which I had against you {{while you were in}} wrongful possession of my father's estates. You must remember that when, on examination of my father's papers, no will was found, I yielded up his property, with perfect willingness, to those who I fancied were his legitimate heirs. For this I received all sorts of insults from your wife and yourself (who acquiesced in them); and when the discovery of a will, in India, proved MY just claims, you must remember how they were met, and the <b>vexatious</b> <b>proceedings</b> with which you sought to oppose them.|$|E
60|$|Well, {{there was}} nothing more to be done. He might, it is true, have seen Ida, and working upon her love and natural inclinations have tried to persuade her to cut the knot by marrying him off-hand. Perhaps he would have succeeded, for in these affairs women are apt to find the {{arguments}} advanced by their lovers weighty and well worthy of consideration. But he was not the man to adopt such a course. He did the only thing he could do--answered her letter by saying that what must be must be. He had learnt that on the day subsequent to his interview with his rival the Squire had written to Edward Cossey informing him that a decided answer would be given to him on Christmas Day, and that thereon all <b>vexatious</b> <b>proceedings</b> on the part of that gentleman's lawyers had been stayed for the time. He could now no longer doubt what the answer would be. There was only one way out of the trouble, the way which Ida had made up her mind to adopt.|$|E
50|$|In Canada, Section 40 of the Federal Court Act and in Ontario Section 140 of the Courts of Justice Act, {{restrict}} {{the ability to}} introduce or continue proceedings {{for those who have}} instituted <b>vexatious</b> <b>proceedings</b> or conducted proceedings in a vexatious manner.|$|E
2500|$|The High Court {{has power}} to {{prohibit}} vexatious litigants from bringing or continuing legal proceedings without its permission. The Attorney-General must {{apply to the}} Court for such an order, and the Court must be satisfied that the person has [...] "habitually and persistently and without any reasonable ground instituted <b>vexatious</b> legal <b>proceedings,</b> in any court or subordinate court, whether against the same person or against different persons".|$|R
5000|$|Further steps {{have been}} taken {{with a view to}} {{simplification}} of procedure. By Order xxx. rule i (as amended in 1897), a summons, called a summons for directions, has to be taken out by a plaintiff immediately after the appearance of the defendant, and upon such summons an order is to be made respecting pleadings, and a number of interlocutory proceedings. To make such an order at that early stage would seem to demand a prescience and intelligent anticipation of future events which can hardly be expected of a master, or even a judge in chambers, except in simple cases, involving a single issue of law or fact which the parties are agreed in presenting to the court. The effect of the rule is that the plaintiff cannot deliver his statement of claim, or take any step in the action without the leave of the judge. In Chancery cases the order usually made is that the plaintiff deliver his [...]statement of claim, {{and the rest of the}} summons stand over, and the practical effect is merely to add a few pounds to the costs. It may be doubted whether, as applied to the majority of actions, the rule does not proceed on wrong lines, and whether it would not be better to leave the parties, who know the exigencies of their case better even than a judge in chambers, to proceed in their own way, subject to stringent provisions for immediate payment of the costs occasioned by unnecessary, <b>vexatious,</b> or dilatory <b>proceedings.</b> The order does not apply to admiralty cases or to proceedings under the order next mentioned.|$|R
50|$|It {{should be}} noted that, prior to its {{termination}} in 1933, criminal prosecution required a true bill of indictment from the grand jury, and so frivolous and <b>vexatious</b> <b>proceedings</b> were designed to be avoided at this stage (although this did not {{turn out to be}} the case in practice).|$|E
50|$|The Larceny (Advertisements) Act 1870 (33 & 34 Vict c 65) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

50|$|If {{a person}} habitually and without {{reasonable}} excuse brings <b>vexatious</b> <b>proceedings</b> in the Employment Tribunals, a government law officer may {{apply to the}} Employment Appeal Tribunal for an Order declaring that person to be a vexatious litigant, which {{has the effect of}} barring that person from bringing further proceedings in the Employment Tribunals without the consent of the Employment Appeal Tribunal.|$|E
50|$|In Queensland, {{the process}} for having someone {{declared}} a vexatious litigant is governed by the <b>Vexatious</b> <b>Proceedings</b> Act 2005, which supplanted an earlier Act. Importantly, the Act defines a vexatious proceeding to include a proceeding brought without merit or any prospect of success, with the consequence {{that it is not}} necessary to prove the existence of any improper motive in order to obtain relief under the Act.|$|E
50|$|In this case, Julie Gilfoyle, Burchill & Horsey Lawyers, Mylton Burns and McInnes Wilson Lawyers {{brought an}} {{application}} under the <b>Vexatious</b> <b>Proceedings</b> Act 2005 against the respondent Milton Arnoldo Conde, who had commenced {{more than two}} dozen proceedings in Queensland Courts between May 2009 and February 2010, including against solicitors and barristers acting against those he was suing, an Anti-Discrimination Tribunal member named Peter Roney and even the Chief Justice of Queensland Paul de Jersey.|$|E
50|$|The {{court of}} Queen's Bench, led by Lord Denman, {{unanimously}} found that Hansard was not protected by privilege and awarded damages to Stockdale, HM Treasury defraying Hansard's costs. However, when the Middlesex sheriffs attempted {{to enforce the}} court order, Hansard fell back upon parliament for protection. Accordingly the sheriffs and other persons who sought {{to carry out the}} orders issued by the law court against the Hansards were imprisoned by order of the House of Commons. These protracted and <b>vexatious</b> <b>proceedings</b> were brought to a close only by the passing of the Parliamentary Papers Act 1840 by which it was enacted that proceedings, criminal or civil, against persons for the publication of papers printed by order of either house of parliament shall be stayed upon the production of a certificate to that effect. Stockdale was thus finally defeated, and the printer was indemnified.|$|E
5000|$|... s 77(1) {{authorised}} {{the court}} in a compulsory winding up to direct the liquidator either to prosecute the offender himself or to refer the matter to the Director of Public Prosecutions. If it appeared to the liquidator in a voluntary winding up that any past or present director, manager or other officer of the company had been guilty of an offence {{in relation to the}} company for which he was criminally liable, section 77(2) required him to report the matter to the Director of Public Prosecutions. It also required the liquidator to give the Director of Public Prosecutions information and access to documents in his possession or under his control. If the Director of Public Prosecutions decided not to bring proceedings against the offender, the liquidator could do so himself though only with the leave of the court. This was a safeguard against the company's assets being wasted on frivolous or <b>vexatious</b> <b>proceedings.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Brisbane City Council v. Matthews 2006 QSC 25, {{involved}} an application brought under the <b>Vexatious</b> <b>Proceedings</b> Act {{as a result}} of the numerous proceedings brought by the respondent Mathews against the Brisbane City Council (BCC) and other parties. Mathews was a disability pensioner {{as a result of}} a head injury he had sustained many years before, and his injuries affected his ability to concentrate for long periods. Justice Fryberg heard the application before all chamber applications in the list that day in order to assist the respondent, who was self-represented, in being able to present his case. After noting that Mathews had brought multiple proceedings, Justice Fryberg found that they were vexatious under the meaning of the Act::The features of the proceedings to which I have been referred generally are in my view accurately summarised by for the applicant. There is a joinder of multiple defendants without any basis for joinder; there are allegations of bias against judges which are completely unsubstantiated (and I should add that the allegations made orally before me today included allegations of bias against the lady who is now the Chief Judge of the District Court and also against the lady who is the Governor); there is the making of hopeless claims; there are unparticularised allegations of deceit and fraud; there are exaggerated damages claims; there is non-compliance with Court proceedings and in particular a failure to deliver complying pleadings; and finally, there is bringing of claims in respect of which it is not possible to demonstrate the suffering of any loss.|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the history and development of <b>vexatious</b> <b>proceedings</b> legislation in Queensland. It undertakes {{a case study of}} declared vexatious litigants and analyses the effectiveness of a legislative response. In light of recent national and international reforms, this article argues that the current legislative approach to dealing with <b>vexatious</b> <b>proceedings</b> in Queensland is no longer model and requires reformulation. It asserts that a system of graduated litigation limitation orders would provide for a more nuanced response to the issue of vexatious and querulous behaviour. The article concludes by emphasising the value of a multidimensional approach which includes practical, early intervention strategies in addition to legislation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} impact of section 34 of {{the constitution of the}} Republic of South Africa, 1996 on certain aspects of banking law. During parliamentary sovereignty, the parliament and the executive could enact legislation ousting the jurisdiction of courts to adjudicate public-administration matters. However, the constitution in section 34 has brought changes to our banking law by compelling the alteration of established statutory or common law legal principles. The impact brought by section 34 of the constitution on banking law is explored by paying special focus to the law in potential conflict with section 34 of the constitution to see how the courts have addressed the issue of non-compliance with section 34 of the constitution. The law in potential conflict with section 34 of the constitution relates to mainly to manners in which courts could be by-passed by banks in the protection of their interests. Against this background this dissertation discusses and analyses case law in this regard which has contributed towards the development of both our common law and statutory law some of which was in conflict with section 34 of the constitution by limiting unfairly the right of access to court guaranteed by section 34 of the constitution. The following five topics are dealt with specifically: section 38 (2) of the Northwest Agricultural Bank Act 14 of 1981; sections 34 (3) (b) to (7), (9) and (10) and 55 (2) (b) to (d) of the Land Bank Act 13 of 1944; Perfecting clauses in notarial bonds of movables without court intervention; Rule 8 of the Uniform Rules of the High Court; and section 2 of the <b>Vexatious</b> <b>Proceedings</b> Act 3 of 1956.
