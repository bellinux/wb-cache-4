40|$|This study {{examined}} the developmental progression of volunteers involved in a community development project {{and the role of}} factors on various ecological levels (individual, familial, project and community) that impede and support this progression. In-depth interviews were completed using a narrative approach with a total of 11 individuals who were volunteers (n= 5), staff members (n= 4) and individuals who were once volunteers who later became frontline staff members (n= 2) at the Highfield Community Enrichment Project. This project is one of the several Better Beginnings, Better Future program sites implemented in Ontario. Volunteer participants were asked to tell a story about their journey as a volunteer with the project. Specifically, they were asked to address how and why they became involved with the project, barriers to volunteer involvement, structures that supported their involvement, why they continued to be involved, how they hoped {{to be involved in the}} future and how the project could better support volunteers in the future. Staff participants were asked to discuss the initial volunteers with the project and their progression over time, current volunteers and their progression, barriers to participation, reasons behind discontinued volunteerism, how they support and sustain volunteerism, how they encourage a progression of volunteers into complex roles, benefits of volunteerism, and how they can improve upon their support of volunteers. From the data gathered a model of volunteer progression was developed. This model illustrates that volunteerism is a progression where volunteers often begin participating in program-specific roles (task-focused roles) and then progress into more complex roles (i. e., advocacy, leadership, committee roles). It was found that a variety of initiating factors, barriers, supporting and sustaining factors and inhibiting factors play a role in determining whether or not community residents will volunteer in the first place and whether they will progress to occupy more complex roles within the project. The volunteer progression is complete when volunteers progress and move beyond volunteering to enact other roles within the community. An overarching theme emerged from the research data that embodies the entire model developed. This theme was labeled an empowering system of beliefs and structures. It was concluded that without a belief system and project structures that were empowering of volunteer involvement the progression described would not exist. This model serves as an organizational framework from which community development projects similar to the Highfield Community Enrichment project can tailor the support they provide to volunteers to the level at which they are volunteering and from which they can identify and enhance the ways in which they promote <b>volunteer</b> <b>growth</b> and development. This study addresses how this model can be utilized and provides recommendations concerning how the project can maximize volunteerism and promote the progression of volunteers into more complex and central roles...|$|E

40|$|Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative {{opportunistic}} pathogen {{that causes}} serious infections in immunocompromised hosts including severely burned patients. After multiplying within the burn wound, P. aeruginosa translocate {{into the bloodstream}} causing bacterial sepsis frequently leading to organ dysfunction and septic shock. Although the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa infection of thermally-injured wounds has been extensively analyzed, little is known regarding the ability of P. aeruginosa to adapt and survive within the blood of severely burned patients during systemic infection. To identify such adaptations, transcriptome analyses (RNA-seq) were conducted on P. aeruginosa strain PA 14 that was grown in whole blood from a healthy volunteer or three severely burned patients. Compared with growth in blood from healthy <b>volunteers,</b> <b>growth</b> of PA 14 in the blood from severely burned patients significantly altered the expression of 2596 genes, with expression of 1060 genes enhanced, while that of 1536 genes was reduced. Genes whose expression was significantly reduced included genes related to quorum sensing, quorum sensing-controlled virulence factors and transport of heme, phosphate, and phosphonate. Genes whose expression was significantly enhanced {{were related to the}} type III secretion system, the pyochelin iron-acquisition system, flagellum synthesis, and pyocyanin production. We confirmed changes in expression of many of these genes using qRT-PCR. Although severe burns altered the levels of different blood components in each patient, the growth of PA 14 in their blood produced similar changes in the expression of each gene. These results suggest that, in response to changes in the blood of severely burned patients and as part of its survival strategy, P. aeruginosa enhances the expression of certain virulence genes and reduces the expression of others...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Background Ventilator-associated {{pneumonia}} (VAP) is {{the most}} commonly fatal nosocomial infection. Clinical diagnosis of VAP remains notoriously inaccurate. We tested the hypothesis that significantly augmented inflammatory markers distinguish VAP from conditions closely mimicking VAP. Methods A prospective, observational cohort study in two university hospital intensive care units recruiting 73 patients with clinically suspected VAP, and a semi-urban primary care practice recruiting a reference group of 21 age- and sex-matched <b>volunteers.</b> <b>Growth</b> of pathogens at > 104 colony forming units/ml bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) distinguished VAP from 'non-VAP'. Inflammatory mediators were quantified in BALF and serum. Mediators showing significant differences between patients with and without VAP were analysed for diagnostic utility by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves. Results. Seventy-two patients had recoverable lavage - 24 % had VAP. BALF interleukin (IL) - 1 β, IL- 8, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and macrophage inflammatory protein 1 α were significantly higher in the VAP group (all P< 0 · 005). Using a cut off of 10 pg/ml, BALF IL- 1 β generated negative likelihood ratios for VAP of 0 · 09. In patients with BALF IL- 1 β < 10 pg/ml the post-test probability of VAP was 2 · 8 %. Using a cut off value for IL- 8 of 2 ng/ml, positive likelihood ratio was 5. 03. There {{was no difference in}} cytokine levels between patients with sterile BALF and those with growth of < 104 CFU/ml. Conclusions BALF IL- 1 β and IL- 8 are amongst the strongest markers yet identified for accurately demarcating VAP within the larger population of patients with suspected VAP. These findings have potential implications for reduction in unnecessary antibiotic use but require further validation in larger populations...|$|R

40|$|Endothelial {{progenitor}} cells (EPC) are bone-marrow derived circulating cells {{participating in}} angiogenesis and vascular homeostasis. Reduced numbers of circulating EPC are observed {{in patients with}} various cardiovascular diseases and are related to an increased risk for future cardiovascular events and death. Little is known about functional changes. The aim of this thesis was to study the function of EPC from patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) or with cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes or advanced age. In particular, underlying molecular mechanisms were examined and potential therapeutic approaches were explored. CAD patients had reduced EPC numbers, which were correlated with increased plasma concentration of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor. In vitro, ADMA impaired EPC function which could be restored by statin treatment. In addition, EPC number and function decreased with age. Treatment of <b>volunteers</b> with <b>growth</b> hormone increased EPC levels and improved EPC function. Animal and in vitro studies showed the EPC increase to be directly mediated by the {{insulin-like growth factor 1}} (IGF- 1), which enhanced endothelial NOS expression of the EPC in a phosphoinositide- 3 -kinase/Akt dependent manner. Growth hormone-mediated increase in IGF- 1 reversed age-related EPC dysfunction. Finally, function of EPC from patients with type II diabetes mellitus was analysed. Uncoupling of eNOS occurred within diabetic EPC and resulted in enhanced superoxide anion formation with subsequent EPC dysfunction. EPC dysfunction was protein kinase C-dependent, associated with reduced intracellular tetrahydrobiopterin (BH 4) concentrations and reversible after exogenous BH 4 treatment. Impairment of EPC function is likely to contribute to the pathogenesis of vascular disease in diabetes mellitus. In conclusion, mechanisms underlying EPC dysfunction in various cardiovascular diseases were investigated and novel treatment approaches for dysfunctional EPC were explored. The knowledge may provide clues for the therapy and prevention of certain cardiovascular diseases. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|Ventilator {{associated}} pneumonia (VAP) is {{a significant}} challenge for the Intensive Care doctors worldwide. It is both difficult to diagnose accurately and quickly and to treat effectively once the diagnosis has been established. Current diagnostic microbiological methods of diagnosis {{can take up to}} 48 hours to yield results. Early diagnosis and treatment remain the best way of improving outcome for patients with VAP. In this study we look at novel diagnostic techniques for VAP. Electronic nose (Enose) technology was used to identify to identify the presence of microorganisms in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid samples taken from the respiratory tracts of ventilated patients. The results were compared with standard microbiological culture and sensitivities. The Enose was able to discriminate 83 % of samples into growth or no growth groups on samples grown in the lab. When the technique was employed to samples taken directly from patients the accuracy fell to 68. 2 %. This suggests that patient related factors may be reducing the accuracy of the Enose classification. The use of antimicrobial drugs prior to patient sampling is likely to have played a major role. The second part of this study used Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of patient’s breath in an attempt to identify patients with VAP. Breath samples were taken {{at the same time as}} the bronchoalveolar lavage samples described above. The use of this technique did show differences between the breath samples of patients who did not have any microbiological growth from their BAL samples and those that did. Leave one out cross validation of a PC fed LDA model showed 84 % correct classification between healthy <b>volunteers,</b> no <b>growth</b> and growth groups. Finally, we evaluated the Breathotron, which is a breath analysis device designed and built at Cranfield Health. It allows for analysis of breath samples using a single sensor system as opposed to a sensor array employed in traditional Enose devices. This allows it to be more portable and cheaper to build. The Breathotron also allows collection of breath onto sorbent cartridges for GC-MS analysis. Its single sensor did not allow for accurate discrimination between samples.

This naturalistic inquiry revealed some personal and situational characteristics of middle-aged and older Christian adults who offered their services to each English as a foreign language overseas for a short term. Five-page questionnaires were received from 8 % people between the ages of 40 and 80 who volunteered under the auspices of Christian organizations. Interviews were conducted with 47 of the respondents and the themes that emerged were analyzed and reported. No situational characteristics were found to be common, but certain personal traits and behaviors were found to be strikingly similar. The daily and long-standing habit of reflection was found to be common. Other common characteristics were: a nonmaterialistic lifestyle, friendships with internationals, a pattern of volunteer service, and an active lifestyle. Other common traits were relational skill, helpfulness and a sense of responsibility, optimism and a sense of gratitude, flexibility, and the ability to change and grow. The investigation found that the volunteers had a deep sense of commitment to their faith and desired to live Christianity. The volunteers appeared to operate under a stable and integrated system, using their habit of reflection on attitude, lifestyle, and commitment to motivate them to action. Prior consideration of possible benefits to themselves from volunteering apparently were not weighed against the cost of service. The volunteers did not believe they had greatly sacrificed finances, time, or energy. In retrospect they acknowledged joy and satisfaction from the volunteer experience and the relationships generated thereby but especially noted spiritual growth, particularly the maturation of their sense of dependence on and trust in God. This research showed the connection between <b>volunteering</b> and <b>growth</b> within maturity. Adult developmentalists should note the influence of volunteering on maturing processes and the connection between achieved maturity and motivation to volunteer in what might be considered "costly" situations.

40|$|Background: The Health Systems Trust {{implemented}} a community-based growth-monitoring intervention project that {{fits into the}} Integrated Nutrition Programme focus areas and commissioned an evaluation of this project. Objective: To assess project volunteers' knowledge on infant and young child nutrition and growth monitoring, and evaluate community-based growth-monitoring activities. Design: Five randomly selected growth-monitoring sites per sub-district were evaluated. Project volunteers (n= 45) and caregivers (n= 186) attending the growth-monitoring sites were interviewed {{by means of a}} questionnaire. Growth-monitoring and nutrition education activities were observed at the growth-monitoring sites. Setting: Two rural districts in KwaZulu-Natal (Umkhanyakude: sub-district Jozini; and Zululand: sub-district Phongola), and one rural district in the Eastern Cape (OR Tambo), South Africa. Results: Project volunteers were mostly women (87 %), 38 ± 10 years old, and 27 % had matric/Grade 12. There was a high turnover of project volunteers. Their nutrition knowledge varied. Forty-six percent of the project volunteers and 39 % of the caregivers could correctly identify the growth curve of a healthy growing child. Seven of the 13 sites that were visited were at a crèche. There was a referral system between the growth-monitoring site and the local clinic, and links with the Department of Agriculture and, to a lesser extent, the Department of Social Welfare. Weighing methods were inconsistent and the steps of growth monitoring were not followed through. Nutrition education to the caregivers was lacking at several of the sites.

The type strain AZ_ 3 a(T) of S. tigurinus was originally isolated from a patient with infective endocarditis. According to its phenotypic and molecular characteristics, S. tigurinus is most closely related to Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, Streptococcus oralis, and Streptococcus infantis. Accurate identification of S. tigurinus is facilitated by 16 S rRNA gene analysis. We retrospectively analyzed our 16 S rRNA gene molecular database, which contains sequences of all clinical samples obtained in our institute since 2003. We detected 17 16 S rRNA gene sequences which were assigned to S. tigurinus, including sequences from the 3 S. tigurinus strains described previously. S. tigurinus originated from normally sterile body sites, such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or heart valves, of 14 patients and was initially detected by culture or broad-range 16 S rRNA gene PCR, followed by sequencing. The 14 patients had serious invasive infections, i. e., infective endocarditis (n = 6), spondylodiscitis (n = 3), bacteremia (n = 2), meningitis (n = 1), prosthetic joint infection (n = 1), and thoracic empyema (n = 1).

40|$|Abstract To {{evaluate}} {{interference effects}} of <b>volunteer</b> barley on <b>growth</b> indices of six wheat cultivars, {{a study conducted}} in Sabzevar region during 2007 - 2008 growing season. The experiment was established as randomized complete block design with factorial arrangement and three replications. The treatments were six wheat cultivars in weedy and weed free situation. The studied cultivars including: 1 - Chamran 2 - Gascogen 3 - Mahdavi 4 - Pishtaz 5 - Shiraz and 6 - Falat with densities of 350, 375, 375, 400, 400, 325 seed m- 2. Valfajr cultivar {{was used as a}} volunteer barley with density of 50 plant m- 2. Base on variance analyze results volunteer barley interference reduced grain yield, leaf aria index, relative growth rate, crop growth rate, height and dry matter accumulation of wheat cultivars. The maximum of grain yield in monoculture and mixedculture was obtained in Shiraz and Mahdavi cultivars, respectively and the minimum values was found in Gascogen and Chamran cultivars, respectively. The maximum of leaf area index in monoculture and mixedculture were in Mahdavi cultivar, which could be caused by higher height and thus increased shading on volunteer barley and limitation on its growth. Comparison of cultivars relative growth rate in monoculture and mixedculture showed that Mahdavi cultivar had minimum reduction of relative growth rate. Moreover crop growth rate of Shiraz cultivar in monoculture and Mahdavi cultivar in mixedculture was greater than other cultivars. Results showed that yield of evaluated cultivars in volunteer barley interference situation were affected by height, leaf area index, relative growth rate, crop growth rate and accumulated dry matter, and Mahdavi cultivar showed better performance in these traits.

5000|$|Kerala is a {{state on}} the {{tropical}} Malabar Coast of south-western India. Nicknamed {{as one of the}} [...] "10 paradises of the world" [...] by National Geographic, Kerala is famous especially for its Eco-tourism initiatives. Its unique culture and traditions, coupled with its varied demography, has made {{it one of the most}} popular tourist destinations in India. Growing at a rate of 13.31%, the tourism industry significantly contributes to the state's economy. Kerala is known for its tropical backwaters and pristine beaches in Trivandrum such as Kovalam and Varkala.From the green scapes of Idukki to the buzzing cities like Trivandrum and Kochi, Kerala has its vivid collection of tourist spots. Popular attractions in the state include the beaches at Kovalam, Kappad, Muzhuppilangad, Cherai and Varkala; the hill stations of Munnar, Thekkady, Ramakkalmedu Nelliampathi, Ponmudi and Wayanad; forts like the Bekal Fort in Kanhangad and St. Angelo's Fort in Kannur and the National Parks/ Wildlife sanctuaries at Periyar and Eravikulam. The [...] "backwaters" [...] region—an extensive network of interlocking rivers, lakes, and canals that centre on Alleppey, Kumarakom, and Punnamada also see heavy tourist traffic. Heritage sites, such as East Fort, Kuthira Malika, Hill Palace, Mattancherry Palace are also famous. Cities such as Trivandrum, Cochin, Trichur, Calicut and Quilon are popular centres for shopping and traditional theatrical performance.The Grand Kerala Shopping Festival (GKSF) claimed to be Asia's largest shopping festival was started in the year 2007. Since then it has become an annual shopping event being conducted in the December-January period. During this period stores and shops registered under the GKSF offer wide range of discounts, vat refunds etc. Along with the guaranteed shopping experience, shoppers are provided with gift coupons for a fixed worth of purchase entering them into weekly and mega lucky draws. As compared to shopping festivals being held in other countries, this Festival converts the entire state of Kerala into a giant shopping mall, incorporating not just the big players, but also the small and medium scale industries.The state's tourism agenda promotes ecologically sustained tourism, which focuses on the local culture, wilderness adventures, <b>volunteering</b> and personal <b>growth</b> of the local population. Efforts are taken to minimise the adverse effects of traditional tourism on the natural environment, and enhance the cultural integrity of local people.|$|R
