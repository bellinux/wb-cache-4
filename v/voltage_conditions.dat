25|$|On January 30, 2012, the Byron Unit 2 {{was shut}} down and {{depressurized}} after a failed insulator in the plant's switchyard caused the loss of one phase to the plant's startup transformers. This caused low <b>voltage</b> <b>conditions</b> on the plant's emergency power buses and also {{for two of the}} reactor coolant pumps to trip which caused the plant to shut down. The trip of the plant then caused the other two reactor coolant pumps to trip (as they had been receiving power directly from the main generator) and natural circulation had to be used during the shutdown. When operators discovered the loss of the single phase, they manually tripped the breaker feeding the startup transformers, allowing the emergency diesel generators to start and restore normal voltages to the safety buses. Steam was vented from the non-radioactive, secondary side of the plant to aid in the cooling process while the turbines remained offline. A small amount of radioactive tritium was released into the local environment during the initial venting procedure, but was deemed no threat to the public by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. A similar insulator failure occurred at Unit 1 on February 29 again affecting the unit's startup transformers. In this case the breaker feeding the transformers tripped automatically and the emergency diesel generators immediately started up to restore power to the safety buses. Additionally, all of the non-safety power generation buses transferred to the unit auxiliary transformers, which receive power from the plant's turbine generator, preventing a trip of the plant. After this second failed insulator event, Exelon took both units offline and replaced all of the insulators in the plant's switchyard.|$|E

Due to large amount of non-linear equipment, impact and fluctuating loads (such as locomotive, arc-furnace, heavy merchant mill, welding equipment etc.), problems of power quality {{is becoming more and more}} serious problem with time. To overcome this problem APF (Active power filter) has gained more attention because of its excellent performance of harmonic mitigation and reactive power compensation.

This paper presents detailed analysis to compare and elevate the performance of two control strategies for extracting reference currents of shunt active power filter under balanced and un-balanced <b>voltage</b> <b>condition</b> by using PI controller. The instantaneous active and reactive current component (id-iq) method and instantaneous active and reactive power (p-q) method are two control strategies which are extensively used in active filters. A shunt active filter based on the instantaneous active and reactive current component (id-iq) method is proposed. This method aims to compensate harmonic and first harmonic unbalance.

50|$|In {{the legacy}} grid, {{there are three}} primary tools for {{carrying}} out voltage management: Load Tap Changers (LTCs), voltage regulators, and capacitor banks. LTCs and voltage regulators refer to transformers with variable turns ratios that are placed at strategic points in a network and adjusted to raise or lower voltage as is necessary. Capacitor banks manage voltage by “generating” reactive power, and have thus far been the primary tools through which true Volt/VAR control is carried out. These large capacitors {{are connected to the}} grid in shunt configuration through switches which, when closed, allow the capacitors to generate VARs and boost voltage at the point of connection. In the future, further VVC might be carried out by smart inverters and other distributed generation resources, which can also inject reactive power into a distribution network. A VVC application helps the operator mitigate dangerously low or high <b>voltage</b> <b>conditions</b> by suggesting required action plans for all VVC equipment.
