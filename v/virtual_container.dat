40|$|Abstract—In cloud computing, <b>virtual</b> <b>containers</b> on {{physical}} resources are provisioned to requesting users. Resource providers may pack as many containers as possible onto {{each of their}} physical machines, or may pack specific types and quantities of <b>virtual</b> <b>containers</b> based on user or system QoS objectives. Such elastic provisioning schemes for resource sharing may present major challenges to scientific parallel applications that require task synchronization during execution. Such elastic schemes may also inadvertently lower utilization of computing resources. In this paper, we describe the elasticity constraint effect and ripple effect that cause a negative impact to application response time and system utilization. We quantify the impact using real workload traces through simulation. Then, we demonstrate that some resource scheduling techniques can be effective in mitigating the impacts. We find that a tradeoff is needed among the elasticity of <b>virtual</b> <b>containers,</b> the complexity of scheduling algorithms, and the response time of applications.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} goals of data-center management is to reduce cost through efficient use of resources. Virtualization techniques provide the opportunity of carving individual physical servers into multiple <b>virtual</b> <b>containers</b> that can be run and managed separately. A key challenge that comes with virtualization is the simultaneous on-demand provisioning of shared resources to <b>virtual</b> <b>containers</b> and the management of their capacities to meet service quality targets at the least cost. This paper proposes a two-level resource management system with local controllers at the virtual-container level and a global controller at the resource-pool level. Autonomic resource allocation is realized through the interaction of the local and global controllers. A novelty of the controller designs is their use of fuzzy logic to efficiently and robustly deal with the complexity of the virtualized data center and the uncertainties of the dynamically changing workloads. Experimental results obtained through a prototype implementation demonstrate that, for the scenarios under consideration, the proposed resource management system can significantly reduce resource consumption while still achieving application performance targets. 1...|$|R

50|$|SDH {{differs from}} Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy (PDH) {{in that the}} exact rates {{that are used to}} {{transport}} the data on SONET/SDH are tightly synchronized across the entire network, using atomic clocks. This synchronization system allows entire inter-country networks to operate synchronously, greatly reducing the amount of buffering required between elements in the network.Both SONET and SDH can be used to encapsulate earlier digital transmission standards, such as the PDH standard, or they can be used to directly support either Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) or so-called packet over SONET/SDH (POS) networking. Therefore, it is inaccurate to think of SDH or SONET as communications protocols in and of themselves; they are generic, all-purpose transport containers for moving both voice and data.

Reducing unnecessary movement of empty containers by facilitating collaboration between shippers of outbound containers (exporters) and receivers of inbound containers (importers) could help improve efficiency. A <b>Virtual</b> <b>Container</b> Yard is an internet based system containing information on container movements for the purpose of matching container importing and exporting needs and minimizing unnecessary empty container kilometers travelled. In this paper, the <b>Virtual</b> <b>Container</b> Yard concept, applied to the Vaughan CP intermodal terminal, is analyzed to demonstrate the potential effect on vehicle kilometers travelled. Container movement data were obtained from the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario’s Commercial Vehicle Survey, and a linear program was formulated and solved to determine optimal matching of inbound and outbound containers to minimize empty container movements. It was determined that implementing a <b>Virtual</b> <b>Container</b> Yard could reduce the vehicle kilometers travelled to and from the Vaughan CP rail terminal by almost 40 % assuming full collaboration between all importers and exporters.

Combining the two approaches leads to a <b>virtual</b> <b>container</b> service infrastructure in which services or functionality extensions can be dynamically added to or removed from an application as needed. This is particular important nowadays given the increasing pervasiveness of wireless and ad-hoc networks as well as peer-to-peer interaction.

Resources have to be allocated to multiple (<b>virtual)</b> <b>containers</b> to minimize {{the total amount of}} resources while meeting the end-to-end performance requirements for the application. In this paper we address these two challenges through the combination of the resource controllers on both application and container levels.
