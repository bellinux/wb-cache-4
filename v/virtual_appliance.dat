40|$|A <b>virtual</b> routing <b>appliance</b> is {{a system}} for the rapid, {{automated}} management and employment of virtual networks. <b>Virtual</b> routing <b>appliances</b> utilize <b>virtual</b> machines to enable virtual infrastructure, {{and they have been}} used commonly in order to implement experimental networks and devoted subnets over a virtual network. Existing research in this area such as cluster-based virtual routers, and Xen routers require the use of physical resources to establish connectivity and to guarantee efficient resource utilization. The <b>virtual</b> routing <b>appliance</b> uses dynamic routing protocols such as RIP, and OSPF to forward traffic between different subnets and manage IP packets at the IP layer. The <b>virtual</b> routing <b>appliance</b> permits rapidly deployable virtual infrastructure, which is helpful for installing isolated infrastructure for restricted purposes, and which is also vital to the deployment of both network and application services. This research is a self-sufficient initiative to evaluate the feasibility of setting up <b>virtual</b> routing <b>appliances</b> in a <b>virtual</b> environment. A <b>virtual</b> routing <b>appliance</b> can convey about substantial cost benefits to organizations, especially educational institutions with limited use of physical resources...|$|R

50|$|With {{the rise}} of {{virtualization}} as a platform for hosted services provision, <b>virtual</b> <b>appliances</b> have come to provide a direct route for traditional on-premises applications to be rapidly redeployed in a {{software as a service}} (SaaS) mode - without requiring major application re-architecture for multi-tenancy. By decoupling the hardware and operating system infrastructure provider from the application stack provider, <b>virtual</b> <b>appliances</b> allow economies of scale on the one side to be leveraged by the economy of simplicity on the other. Traditional approaches to SaaS, such as that touted by Salesforce.com, leverage shared infrastructure by forcing massive change and increased complexity on the software stack.|$|R
