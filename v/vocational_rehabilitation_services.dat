40|$|In this study, {{the authors}} {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} demographic, medical, and <b>vocational</b> <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>service</b> variables on employment outcomes of persons living with HIV/AIDS. Binary logistic regression {{analyses were conducted to}} determine predictors of employment outcomes using two groups drawn from <b>Rehabilitation</b> <b>Services</b> Administration (RSA- 911) data. Only service variables were found to be significantly related to employment outcomes in both groups. Job placement assistance and on-the-job supports were found to be significant predictors of a successful employment outcome at closure. Whereas higher case service expenditures increased the likelihood of achieving employment at closure, longer length of time in rehabilitation decreased the likelihood of employment at closure. Keywords HIV/AIDS, employment outcomes, <b>vocational</b> <b>rehabilitation,</b> logistic regression Since Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) was first reported in the United States in 1981, the number of persons living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and AIDS has continued to grow, more than 90 % of whom are working-age adults (20 – 64 years; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2007). Before the advent of adv-anced treatment for HIV in the 1990 s, termination from work was a relative certainty for many of those living with HIV/ AIDS to maintain their health or because they faced imme-diate death (Klosinski, 1998). As the widespread use of potent combination antiretrovi-ral therapy has improved their health and longevity, people with HIV/AIDS have increasingly focused on entering or reentering the workforce (Brooks & Klosinski, 1999; Brooks...|$|R
