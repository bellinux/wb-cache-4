The constant-quality video compression technique commonly used, {{variable bit rate}} (VBR) encoding, produces flows with multiple time-scale rate variability, so smoothing the VBR video traffic within an entire distribution tree presents a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel wavelet-based traffic smoothing (WTS) algorithm. Unlike existing algorithms, the WTS algorithm considers traffic smoothing at multiple resolutions. It results in a pruned version of a full tree, which corresponds to the original VBR traffic. Theoretical anal-ysis and numerical evaluation demonstrate that: 1) WTS performs well across several metrics in smoothing bursty traffic and 2) for a <b>video</b> <b>bit</b> <b>stream</b> with frames, the computational complexity of WTS is (log).
