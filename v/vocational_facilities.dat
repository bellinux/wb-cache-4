50|$|From 1969 to 1974, General Đồng served {{military}} personnel {{in a different}} capacity, Minister of War Veterans (equivalent to the US Secretary of Veterans Affairs). During this time, he worked with West Germany to get financial and medical support for disabled veterans. His relationship with German officials in Oberhausen resulted in military orphans or children of disabled veterans going there to further their education. Most of the students came from the seven ministry-sponsored Quốc Gia Nghĩa Tử schools. Minister Đồng's personal ties with Australian, Taiwanese and South Korean officials benefited Vietnamese veterans. During his tenure, Australia, Taiwan and South Korea provided much needed funding and training to disabled veterans at <b>vocational</b> <b>facilities.</b> His friendship with an American adviser Shelby Robert and his wife Miriam benefited the ministry as well. In April 1973, the Robert and the Gettysburg Presbyterian Church donated several wheelchairs and provided funding to train a Vietnamese doctor from the ministry. Later that year, the minister traveled to the United States and several western European countries to ask for financial assistance. The trip yielded good results: several US colleges provided the ministry with funding for the its prosthetic center. In particular, Ohio State University sent professors to train teachers and to teach QGNT's students in three special courses: typing, accounting and home economics.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to measure and analyze {{accessibility}} of area <b>vocational</b> <b>facilities</b> in Indiana to physically disabled persons. Empirical data did not exist to determine accessibility of area <b>vocational</b> <b>facilities</b> in Indiana. The <b>vocational</b> <b>facilities</b> were all self-contained, or not attached to comprehensive high schools. Federal fiscal support of vocational education had been constant beginning with the Morrill Act of 1862. Intent of federal legislation toward accessibility and vocational education was to insure any person, regardless of handicap, an unobstructed, free and appropriate education. Enrollment of secondary vocational education students in Indiana has increased over ninety percent since 1967. Vocational schools' receiving federal monetary support have mandated accessibility for handicapped persons. Therefore, it is important that existing <b>vocational</b> <b>facilities</b> maintain accessibility compliance and future buildings be designed with accessibility for handicapped persons kept paramount. Twenty-two area <b>vocational</b> <b>facilities</b> were visited and surveyed between December, 1981 and March, 1982. The instrument used to survey <b>vocational</b> <b>facilities</b> was The Revised Accessibility Checklist as recommended by the Iowa Chapter of the American Institute of Architects. The Revised Accessibility Checklist was based on American National Standards Institute Specifications 117. 1. ANSI Specification 117. 1 was the established standard used in determining compliance with the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 required all buildings receiving federal funds be accessible to physically handicapped persons. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 required structures to be in compliance by June, 1980. Individual <b>vocational</b> <b>facilities</b> were evaluated according to specific accessibility checklist criteria. Classifications in determining individual building accessibility were Excellent, Good, Average, Below Average, and Poor. None was judged excellent, four were good, none was average, fourteen were below average and four were poor. Conclusions based on the findings and data were:The majority of facilities were not accessible to physically disabled persons. 2) Federal legislation mandating accessibility has had limited effect. 3) Facilities constructed after 1975 were in substantial compliance with accessibility standards. 4) Parking lots, restrooms, water fountains and telephones could be feasibly altered to comply with accessibility standards. Recommendations for specific renovations to the twenty-two facilities surveyed were made for improving accessibility. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|E

40|$|A CASE STUDY USING A QUALITATIVE RESEARCH TECHNIQUE TO INVESTIGATE THE PERCEPTIONS OF ADMINISTRATION, FACULTY, AND STUDENTS, REGARDING TWO STAND-ALONE CAREER CENTERS IN ILLINOIS Anthony Jay Plese 157 Pages August 2014 The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} case {{study was to explore}} the process by which a vocational facility (career center) operates, and to identify administration, faculty, and student perceptions as each may affect decision-making regarding the area of study, why students chose the vocational center they are attending, and perceptions that define a quality center. This research study asked open-ended questions to help the reader understand how administrators, teachers, and students perceive their career center and their role and purpose at hat center. Throughout the paper two terms were used interchangeably: vocational education (VE) and career and technical education (CTE). The practitioners and students involved in this study were from two area <b>vocational</b> <b>facilities</b> in north central Illinois that provide skill training for eleventh and twelfth grade students. The participants were interviewed using a semi-structured protocol. There were also observations from the interviewer of the students and faculty chosen for the project. The daily operations of each center were documented as part of the observation process. The following themes evolved from the research questions: skills, certification, licensure, dual credit, hands-on learning, engaged learning, and the ability to increase occupational skills or secure employment after high school. The researcher believes the study shows different perceptions from the teachers, students, and administration regarding the importance and reasons for vocational education...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1967 The United States of America faces many serious {{problems}} today. To enumerate {{a few of}} the major ones we must list: 1. poverty 2. juvenile delinquency 3. school drop-outs 4. automation 5. unskilled people A major aim of a great deal of federal legislation passed during President Kennedy's and President Johnson's terms has been directed toward the solution of these educational problems. It has been implied that education {{is the key to the}} solution of many of our modern and age-old problems. The enactment of the Vocational Education Act of 1963, plus the Manpower Development and Training Act of 1962 and the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 have stimulated renewed vigor into the nation's occupational education programs. The purpose of this study was to examine the vocational education status of Tillamook and Clatsop counties and to determine the feasibility of establishing area vocational schools. Community leaders, school administrators, and many students have voiced their desire for more occupational education. The State Department of Education was also interested in obtaining information relating to vocational education in these two counties. This research was designed to investigate the following: (1) Employment opportunities (2) Potential vocational education students in the two counties (3) Status of existing <b>vocational</b> <b>facilities,</b> personnel, and curriculum (4) Cooperative educational action by school districts. Information regarding these items will be of special assistance to the school districts in these two counties in planning better education for all ages. A written survey was administered to 4, 706 students from grade 7 through 14 to determine the vocational student potential. Secondary dat 3 from the Oregon State Department of Labor was used to determine the job opportunities. Personal inspection of existing facilities and curriculums were made by the investigators. The statutes of the State of Oregon were studied for legal restrictions to cooperative action among school districts. The findings and information summarized in this study indicates that there is a lack of occupational education in Tillamook and Clatsop Counties. Approximately 70 percent of the 4, 706 students surveyed indicated a desire for occupational education in high school, It is the opinion of the author that it is essential to have some form of cooperative action among the smaller school districts in order to provide adequate vocational education for their children. In Tillamook and Clatsop counties the only limitations upon cooperative action appears to be transportation, scheduling, and willingness of the districts to cooperate...|$|E

It is well to remember the many personal sacrifices and the endless long hours work­ing like a human dynamo, striving to improve the living standards of the worker and his family; putting more bread and butter on their table and, needless to say, the betterment of our community as a whole can be attributed to his interest in civic activities. He gave of himself so completely he ruined his own health. W are all better off be­cause of the principles he stands for and lives by. Among his many achievements in labor and public life and the many worthwhile things he founded, the following serve as living proof of Gosser's untiring efforts. The Childrens Summer Camp, The Diagnostic Clinic, The Health and Retiree Center with the Pharmacies, the Optical Department, the Dental Department, the Hearing Aid Department, United Labor Committee, 60 Now, Council of Elders, Golden Age Summer and Winter Centers. As President of Local 12 U. A. W., as Regional Director of Region 2 -B, U. A. W., as. Vice-president of the International Union, UAW-AFL-CIO, during which time he was Director of the Competitive Shops Department, Director of Skilled Trades Department, Director of Wage and Hours Department, Director of Die Casting Department, Director of Auto-Lite Department, Director of Dana-Spicer Department, Director of Champion Spark Plug Department, Director of Doehler-Jarvis Council, Director of Foundry Department and Director of several other wage and hour councils too numerous to mention. In civic life he served as a Charter Member of the Labor-Management-Citizens Com­mittee and the Toledo Industrial Development Committee. Dick Gosser also was an in­tegral part of the Toledo Port Authority and other civic committees. He helped in various major fund raising drives like the Newsboy Goodfellows, The Community Chest, hospi­tals, churches, and others. Only last year, through his efforts, every needy child had an opportunity to attend free the Children's Wonderland at the Lucas County Recreational Center. These are just an example of the many'ways Toledo's most renowned labor leader has helped people in all walks of life throughout the United States an. dCanada.. It is fitting this evening that over 2, 000 of us. gather together to break bread with this great man and our best 'friend, Richard T. Gosser. It is ·our way of demonstrati. ng to him and to everyone that we honor and appreciate his complete dedication to labor and the community. What's more, we publicly ackqowledge and respect his honesty, his courage, his leadership, and his efforts to obtain a fuller measure of life for all•. We sincerely' hope that his retirement as an active officer in the labor movement is not a conclusion to 'an illustrious past, but instead with the Good Lord willing and his health permitting, Dick Gosser will continue to be an inspiration and a guiding tower of light to a better and brighter future. In these troubled tiines, now more than ever, we need his unequaled quality of under­standing tolerance, perseverance, desire and ability to help people gain dignity as be­comes the brotherhood of man. 'I am deeply touched by this turnout tonite. I don't believe anyone came out here because they want a job as an international representative. My influence with the UAW has diminished since my retirement so I take it that those who are here are my friends. And I {{want to thank you for}} giving up your favorite TV program or breaking a bowling date or some other engagement to come. If I seem to be overwhelmed by gratitude [...] forgive me. During my long years as a Labor Leader I have found gratitude isn't our chief virtue. I can think back to a long list of associates whom I have tried to help and who are no longer with meÿoing back to Toots Martinÿ [...] But I don't think this is the place or the time to review history [...] , or to talk of my deeds or my misdeeds. After all the words that have been spoken it would be like putting more icing on the frosting of the cake. Looking back 30 years I would say we have come a pretty long way in getting a better deal for the worker. Now if we can mobilize only a small part of that spirit when we first started this industrial union movement; if we can get just a small part of the effort and the sacrifice that those fellows gave, we can gain more in the next 30 months than has been accomplished in the last 30 years. I donlt plan to make a long speech [...] , that is, long for me. But last week I told some negro ministers who met with me that thereWs a difference when a worker in a factory retires and a fellow who has made his living using his brains and his wits. If the last couple of months in Florida proved anything to me it proved I wasnlt going to be happy spending the rest of my life sunning myself on a rocking chair. If I can't do all I could 5 or i 0 years ago I still can outthink [...] and figure out a few short cuts to help the workers [...] . or the retirees. And having been doing this so long, I may as well go on doing it. But nowadays itls not the worker that needs help so much as the fellows that have given up workingo [...] or the young fellows that want to work but can't [...] . and they canlt because there is no job to be found for too many of them. Yet there is one simple remedy that can help both these groups of people [...] . the young fellow looking for a job and the old-timer who has given his up. That is our Sixty Now program where we make it possible for the older worker to retire with a decent pay check so he can enjoy life and live in dignity. While we are helping him to a well-earned and long deserved rest we are helping create a job opening for the younger fellow just out of school. Let me just give you a few facts before I leave this point. The Social Security Department reports that the average monthly benefit to the 13 million people retired under this law is 76. 66. That is less than i, 000. 00 a year. If the President and the Congress really want to cure poverty herels a swell place to begin. LetWs raise Social Security [...] . and if we have to reduce anything, letts reduce the age [...] . NOT the Social Security benefit. The 1960 census report says there were nearly 3 and 3 / 4 million men and women between the ages of 60 and 64 working in this country. At the same time the United States Labor Department reported there were between 4 and 5 million persons unemployed. If we could make it possible and worthwhiled for these older persons to retire on a decent benefit it would nearly take care of all the unemployed. Now just let me make a final point. No one has to tell me that not all these young fellows have the skills or the aptitudes to take over all these jobs. So I would like to recommend to our school and university officials; to [...] 2 - our legislators in Congress, in the State, to the county commissioners and to the City Council that they find the money to make available the facilities needed for training. I think you would find the employers, the unions and the public willing to do their part and carry their share. It would mean that the present <b>vocational</b> <b>facilities</b> at Macomber and the University of Toledo would have to be expanded° I read that school officials in 5 counties in this area have gotten together to open a vocational school at the Rossford Erie Depot. What would be wrong with the employers forming a joint committee with the teachers and the labor unions and making up a flexible training program so these youngsters could be able to fill all the openings in the plants and elsewhere. And why not follow a program such as the UAW skilled trades which I directed combining training in the school with that on the job. I would recommend that once a fellow signs up for this training he has to finish the course and can't bid on some higher paid opening which might come up while hews learning. The youngsters today have to learn that it's not the quick or easy buck that counts but the ability and willingness to learn skills or trades that will stick with him a lifetime and give him the chance to get a job anytime, any place while the untrained worker is automated out of a livelihood. I could go on for a lot more but I think these points are important. I am willing to help in this in any way I can [...] . up to the limits of my resources. In closing I think I should say I deeply appreciate your coming and the sentiments that were expressed. I want to assure everyone that I shall continue to make any contribution I can to help people so long as I can draw a breath [...] - 3 -...|$|E
