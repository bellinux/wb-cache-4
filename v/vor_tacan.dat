40|$|Using data {{obtained}} in flight, three position determining algorithms {{for use by}} general aviation aircraft were evaluated representing increasing software requirements. These were a DME only, DME/air data and blended DME/air data. Although each step represented additional software with resultant increase in position accuracy, all could be performed on a programmable electronic desk calculator. Results from the computation of aircraft position using the three algorithms are presented. The algorithms employed can be extended to accept <b>VOR,</b> <b>TACAN</b> bearing, ADF, or other NAVAID Data. To obtain the flight data an experimental system was configured and flown on a general aviation aircraft. Principal hardware elements (all with low-cost potential) were a programmable calculator, a single DME receiver (multiplexed for multiple DME use) and a low-cost air speed sensor (shed-vortex principle). The flight test demonstrated satisfactory performance of these principal elements...|$|E
50|$|In many cases, VOR {{stations}} have collocated Distance measuring equipment (DME) or military Tactical Air Navigation (TACAN) â€” the latter includes both the DME distance feature {{and a separate}} TACAN azimuth feature that provides military pilots data similar to the civilian VOR. A collocated <b>VOR</b> and <b>TACAN</b> beacon is called a VORTAC. A VOR collocated only with DME is called a VOR-DME. A VOR radial with a DME distance allows a one-station position fix. Both VOR-DMEs and TACANs share the same DME system.|$|R
40|$|An {{automatic}} Navaids Checkout System {{for use in}} Space Shuttle {{development is}} discussed. The groundwork leading to the development is presented, followed by {{a description of the}} hardware. Finally, system utilization including operator interface and system software is discussed. The Navaids Checkout System is extremely flexible with capability to handle different test articles with a minimum of hardware reconfiguration. Application software is written in a high level user-oriented test language. The checkout system has been in operation for approximately one year with capability to handle <b>VOR,</b> ILS, <b>TACAN,</b> ATC Radar Beacon, and UHF/VHF communications equipment...|$|R
5000|$|A {{non-directional}} (radio) beacon (NDB) is a {{radio transmitter}} at a known location, {{used as an}} aviation or marine navigational aid. As the name implies, the signal transmitted does not include [...] directional information, in contrast to other navigational aids such as low frequency radio range, VHF omnidirectional range (<b>VOR)</b> and <b>TACAN.</b> NDB signals follow the curvature of the Earth, {{so they can be}} received at much greater distances at lower altitudes, a major advantage over VOR. However, NDB signals are also affected more by atmospheric conditions, mountainous terrain, coastal refraction and electrical storms, particularly at long range.|$|R
500|$|The V-22 is {{equipped}} with a glass cockpit, which incorporates four Multi-function displays (MFDs, compatible with night-vision goggles) and one shared Central Display Unit (CDU), to display various images including: digimaps, imagery from the Turreted Forward Looking Infrared System primary flight instruments, navigation (<b>TACAN,</b> <b>VOR,</b> ILS, GPS, INS), and system status. The flight director panel of the Cockpit Management System (CMS) allows for fully coupled (autopilot) functions that take the aircraft from forward flight into a [...] hover with no pilot interaction other than programming the system. The glass cockpit of the canceled CH-46X was derived from the V-22. The fuselage is not pressurized, and personnel must wear on-board oxygen masks above 10,000 feet.|$|R
50|$|IAP charts are {{aeronautical}} charts that {{portray the}} aeronautical data {{that is required}} to execute an instrument approach to an airport. Besides depicting topographic features, hazards and obstructions, they depict the procedures and airport diagram. Each procedure chart uses {{a specific type of}} electronic navigation system such as an NDB, <b>TACAN,</b> <b>VOR,</b> ILS/MLS and RNAV. The chart name reflects the primary navigational aid (NAVAID), if {{there is more than one}} straight-in procedure or if it is just a circling-only procedure. A communication strip on the chart lists frequencies in the order they are used. Minimum, maximum and mandatory altitudes are depicted in addition to the minimum safe altitude (MSA) for emergencies. A cross depicts the final approach fix (FAF) altitude on NPAs while a lightning bolt does the same for PAs. NPAs depict the MDA while a PA shows both the decision altitude (DA) and decision height (DH). Finally, the chart depicts the missed approach procedures in plan and profile view, besides listing the steps in sequence.|$|R
