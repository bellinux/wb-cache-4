5|$|A 2009 study {{conducted}} by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that crashes involving pedestrians and bicyclists have higher incidence rates for hybrid electric vehicles than internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles in low-speed vehicle maneuvers such as reversing or leaving a parking zone. These accidents commonly occurred in zones with low speed limits, during daytime and in clear weather. The study found that a HEV was two {{times more likely to be}} involved in a pedestrian crash than was a conventional ICE vehicle when a <b>vehicle</b> <b>is</b> slowing or stopping, backing up, or entering or leaving a parking space. Vehicle maneuvers were grouped in one category considering those maneuvers that might have occurred at very low speeds where the difference between the sound levels produced by the hybrid versus ICE <b>vehicle</b> <b>is</b> the greatest. Also the study found that the incidence rate of pedestrian crashes in scenarios when vehicles make a turn was significantly higher for HEVs when compared to ICE vehicles. Similarly, The NHTSA study also concluded that the incidence rate of bicyclist crashes involving HEVs for the same kind of maneuvers was significantly higher when compared to conventional vehicles.|$|E
5|$|A {{successor}} for the C3 Picasso {{was revealed}} in 2017 {{as the new}} C3 Aircross, and revealed at the Geneva Motor Show in March as the C-Aircross Concept, with an expected launch in late 2017. Auto Express reported the <b>vehicle</b> <b>is</b> taking design cues from the C-Aircross Concept, and will {{make the transition from}} MPV to an SUV design.|$|E
5|$|Customer {{deliveries}} of the Opel Ampera in Europe were {{delayed until}} the NHTSA completed its {{investigation of the}} Volt's battery fire risk {{to make sure the}} <b>vehicle</b> <b>is</b> safe. However, deliveries of the first Chevrolet Volts in Europe began in France in November 2011. Deliveries of the Vauxhall Ampera in the UK continued as scheduled for May 2012. Opel Ampera deliveries began in February 2012.|$|E

5|$|Like {{its parent}} Jeep Wrangler, the Storm {{is first and}} {{foremost}} an airmobile, capable offroad and utility vehicle meant to tackle extreme terrain in a general reconnaissance role, and can be outfitted with a machine gun or other weapons systems. When armed with a 105mm (4.1in) M40 recoilless rifle, the <b>vehicle</b> <b>is</b> uniquely capable of firing directly over its blast guard equipped hood rather than in the perpendicular position required by most other vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The FMCSA {{regulates the}} length, width, and weight limits of CMVs for interstate {{commercial}} traffic. Interstate commercial traffic is generally {{limited to a}} network of interstate freeways, U.S. highways and state highways known as the National Network (NN). Provided the truck remains on the NN, they {{are not subject to}} the state limits. State limits (which can be lower or higher than federal limits) come into effect for intrastate commercial traffic, provided the <b>vehicle</b> <b>is</b> not on the NN.|$|E
5|$|The M-240 Storm MultiMission <b>Vehicle</b> <b>is</b> {{the first}} of three Storm generations. A variant of the 1991 Jeep Wrangler YJ and the older CJ-6/CJ-8 wheelbase, it is entirely {{produced}} in Israel by Automotive Industries Ltd. {{with the exception of the}} engines, as their manufacture is not economically viable on the Storm's market scale.|$|E
30|$|Hybrid <b>vehicles</b> <b>are</b> {{overwhelmingly}} large, both {{in number}} of vehicles owned and in sales volume. Nearly 1.337  million units of hybrid <b>vehicles</b> <b>were</b> sold in FY 2016, while number of vehicles owned stood at 6.971  million units {{at the end of}} FY 2016. Sales units of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid <b>vehicles</b> <b>were</b> 13, 800 units each, number of electric <b>vehicles</b> owned <b>was</b> 89, 800 units, and number of plug-in hybrid vehicles stood at 70, 323 units.

5|$|The Mitsubishi i-MiEV (MiEV is {{an acronym}} for Mitsubishi {{innovative}} Electric <b>Vehicle)</b> <b>is</b> a five-door hatchback electric car produced by Mitsubishi Motors, and is the electric version of the Mitsubishi i. Rebadged variants of the i-MiEV are also sold in Europe by PSA Peugeot Citroën (PSA) as the Peugeot iOn and Citroën C-Zero. The i-MiEV is the world's first modern highway-capable mass production electric car.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} {{electromagnetism}} are most visibly {{employed in the}} electric motor, which provides a clean and efficient means of motive power. A stationary motor such as a winch is easily provided with a supply of power, but a motor that moves with its application, such as an electric <b>vehicle,</b> <b>is</b> obliged to either carry along a power source such as a battery, or to collect current from a sliding contact such as a pantograph.|$|E
5|$|There are tragic {{consequences}} one snowy {{night when}} the Castillo brothers' car veers {{off the road and}} into a tree. Cesar, {{in the back seat of}} the <b>vehicle,</b> <b>is</b> barely hurt, but Nestor, having driven the car, is killed. The life of Cesar, shattered, is never the same. To honor his brother's memory, Cesar opens his own small club, which is well received. Delores pays him a visit and asks him to sing Nestor's song for her.|$|E
5000|$|This format, {{introduced}} on 18 September 2000, is used nationwide, {{so there}} is no way of knowing where the <b>vehicle</b> <b>was</b> registered.

5|$|A {{division}} of the DOT, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), regulates safety for the U.S. trucking industry. The FMCSA enforces the length, width, and weight limits of CMVs set by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) for interstate commercial traffic. Interstate commercial traffic is generally limited to a network of Interstate Highways, U.S. Highways, and state highways known as the National Network (NN). Provided the truck remains on the NN, it {{is not subject to}} state limits. These limits (which can be lower or higher than federal limits) come into effect for intrastate commercial traffic, provided the <b>vehicle</b> <b>is</b> not on the NN.|$|E
5|$|A {{flexible-fuel vehicle}} (FFV) or dual-fuel vehicle (colloquially called a flex-fuel <b>vehicle)</b> <b>is</b> an {{alternative}} fuel vehicle with an internal combustion engine designed to run {{on more than one}} fuel, usually gasoline blended with either ethanol or methanol fuel, and both fuels are stored in the same common tank. Modern flex-fuel engines are capable of burning any proportion of the resulting blend in the combustion chamber as fuel injection and spark timing are adjusted automatically according to the actual blend detected by a fuel composition sensor. Flex-fuel vehicles are distinguished from bi-fuel vehicles, where two fuels are stored in separate tanks and the engine runs on one fuel at a time, for example, compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), or hydrogen.|$|E
30|$|The <b>vehicle</b> flow <b>was</b> {{observed}} by counting the vehicles from closed-circuit television (CCTV) videos. These videos also provide {{the data for}} vehicle composition in the traffic stream. GPS-mounted <b>vehicle</b> <b>was</b> used to note time-based speed of the <b>vehicle.</b> This <b>vehicle</b> <b>was</b> first moved from NIPA to Hasan Square {{and then on the}} other direction as well. The data attained from this <b>vehicle</b> <b>were</b> plotted on MS Excel to generate the speed distribution.|$|R
50|$|If several <b>vehicles</b> <b>are</b> involved, {{the term}} 'serial crash' {{may be used}}. If many <b>vehicles</b> <b>are</b> involved, the term 'major incident' may be used rather than 'pile up'.|$|R
