2500|$|The Tuvaluan economy {{therefore}} {{relies heavily}} on its fishing income, with 42% of the Tuvaluan population involved in fishing activity at various levels. UN Data calculated a gross value of fisheries at US$43,773,582 (2007 est), which accounted for the output of coastal commercial fishing, coastal subsistence fishing, locally based offshore fishing, foreign-based offshore fishing, freshwater fishing and aquaculture. In recent years [...] all of the income has been generated through the listed activities in Tuvalu waters, rather than through exports direct from Tuvalu. The activities of international fishing vessels, which in 2008 comprised 42 longline fishing vessels, 3 pole/line vessels and 126 purse seiners, far outweigh domestic activity, with a production <b>volume</b> of 35,541 <b>tonnes</b> worth US$40,924,370 (2009 est) or 93.5% of gross value, although Tuvalu retains a sizeable share in income via licensing. The fishing in the 900,000km2 of water area mainly consists of Skipjack Tuna, Yellowfin Tuna and Bigeye Tuna.|$|R
40|$|There is an {{important}} and growing class of elementary particle detectors which are characterized by a large sensitive <b>volume</b> (thousands of <b>tonnes),</b> very low radioactive backgrounds, and rely on the emission of light for particle detection. Water Cherenkov detectors come into this category; they have a large mass of water as the sensitive medium. Particles are detected when they interact with the water and produce Cherenkov light, so detection efficiency relies on having a huge light sensitive area at {{the periphery of the}} detector. The most cost-effective way of achieving this is by placing light concentrators on large photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). This paper describes the work carried out on light concentrators for the PMTs in the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory, a 1000 tonne heavy water Cherenkov detector. We discuss the advantages of using light concentrators, summarize the optical theory of non-imaging light concentration, and describe in detail the development and manufacture of the concentrators themselves. 1...|$|R

40|$|The two-generation study (OECD TG 416) is the {{standard}} requirement within REACH to test reproductive toxicity effects of chemicals with production <b>volumes</b> > 100 <b>tonnes.</b> This test is criticized in terms of scientific relevance and animal welfare. The Extended One Generation Reproductive Toxicity Study (EOGRTS), incorporated into the OECD test guidelines in 2011 (OECD TG 443) {{has the potential to}} replace TG 416, while using only one generation of rats and being more informative. However, its regulatory acceptance proved challenging. This article reconstructs the process of regulatory acceptance and use of the EOGRTS and describes drivers and barriers influencing the process. The findings derive from literature research and expert interviews. A distinction is made between three sub-stages; The stage of Formal Incorporation of the EOGRTS into OECD test guidelines was stimulated by retrospective analyses on the value of the second generation (F 2), strong EOGRTS advocates, animal welfare concern and changing US and EU chemicals legislation; the stage of Actual Regulatory Acceptance within REACH was challenged by legal factors and ongoing scientific disputes, while the stage of Use by Industry is influenced by uncertainty of registrants about regulatory acceptance, high costs, the risk of false positives and the manageability of the EOGRTS.
