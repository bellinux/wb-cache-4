Since the year 2003 the IVF also works on a <b>virtual</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>management</b> <b>centre</b> and in conjunction with this on traffic management. Several large-scale projects have been done since this time, most importantly INVENT where modern traffic management methods have been evaluated and the online-simulation and prediction of traffic during the world youth day (Weltjugendtag) 2005 in Cologne/Germany. This publication briefly describes the simulation package together with the projects mentioned above to show how SUMO {{can be used to}} simulate largescale traffic scenarios. Additionally, it is pointed out how SUMO may be used as a testbed for automatic management algorithms with minor effort in developing extensions...|$|E

30|$|Limited by {{the data}} {{collection}} methods, the initial information of an incident obtained by a <b>traffic</b> <b>management</b> <b>centre</b> (TMC) is commonly insufficient. Furthermore, several latent influencing factors for the incident duration time, such as the real-time traffic flow conditions and the details in characteristic differences of incident locations, cannot often {{be integrated into the}} incident dataset. Thus, we must consider several unobserved factors that are not included in the factor vector, which affect the durations and are referred to as unobserved heterogeneity. Two approaches have been adopted in the current traffic incident duration time analysis and prediction to examine the heterogeneity assumption, namely, applying the gamma distribution to incorporate heterogeneity and allowing parameters to vary across observations based on a pre-specified distribution, which is known as the random-parameter duration model [9, 23, 30, 37, 52, 53].|$|R

40|$|The {{detection}} of incidents {{and the subsequent}} incident response activities and <b>traffic</b> <b>management</b> activities have long been known {{to have a significant}} impact on the resultant magnitude of incident induced delay. Efforts to reduce incident induced delay have tended to focus on reducing the time to detect incidents (i. e. automatic incident detection) and to provide appropriate and swift emergency response. However, efforts to develop <b>traffic</b> <b>management</b> strategies in response to incidents are often hampered by a lack of knowledge of how long the incident is likely to exist. This lack of knowledge also is problematic for disseminating information to travellers about the incident. In practice, <b>traffic</b> <b>management</b> personnel, police, etc. are able to provide rough estimates of the duration of incidents on the basis of experience and the known characteristics of the crash (e. g. number of vehicles involved, type of vehicles, etc.). The purpose of this work is to examine the feasibility of developing a model that permits the prediction of crash duration on the basis of observable crash characteristics. Such a model could be integrated within the <b>traffic</b> <b>management</b> <b>centre</b> (TMC) software to assist operators in selecting appropriate <b>traffic</b> <b>management</b> response strategies and in the provision of information to drivers. The examination of the potential to develop a crash duration prediction model is done on the basis of field data for an urban freeway (the QEW) in Toronto Canada. Field data are obtained from two unrelated databases: the provincial 2 crash database and the freeway <b>traffic</b> <b>management</b> system incident log database. It is found that linking these databases is a complex problem that has a significant influence on the explanatory power of the crash duration prediction model...|$|R

40|$|Most {{algorithms}} {{trying to}} analyze or forecast road traffic rely on many inputs, but in practice, calculations are usually {{limited by the}} available data and measurement equipment. Generally, some of these inputs are substituted by raw or even inappropriate estimations, which in some cases come into conflict with the fundamentals of traffic flow theory. This paper refers to one common example of these bad practices. Many <b>traffic</b> <b>management</b> <b>centres</b> depend on the data provided by double loop detectors, which supply, among others, vehicle speeds. The common data treatment is to compute the arithmetic mean of these speeds over different aggregation periods (i. e. the time mean speeds). Time mean speed is not consistent with Edie’s generalized definitions of traffic variables, and therefore {{it is not the}} average speed which relates flow to density. This means that current practice begins with an error that can have negative effects in later studies and applications. The algorithm introduced in this paper enables easily the estimation of space mean speeds from the data provided by the loops. It is based on two key hypotheses: stationarity of traffic and log-normal distribution of the individual speeds in each time interval of aggregation. It could also be used in case of transient traffic as a part of any data fusion methodology...|$|R

It {{has become one of}} the major technologies of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS). Most of the commonly used floating vehicle devices receive floating vehicle data in a frequency of 1 Hz. To collect real time traffic data of the road network for the above application, floating vehicle data from floating vehicles has to be transmitted from vehicles to a <b>traffic</b> data <b>management</b> <b>centre</b> in short time intervals. With the increase in the numbers of floating vehicles, the cost on communication increases dramatically. This is often one of the major barriers limiting the application of floating vehicle technologies for real time traffic route guidance and many other applications.

The systems used in both domains have historically been developed without consideration given to the social factors important to their use, designs instead being based solely on technical constraints. In the first stages of the project <b>traffic</b> <b>management</b> is investigated through conduction of a literature review covering the objectives, functions and constraints acting upon <b>Traffic</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Centres</b> (TMCs) in road, rail, maritime and air domains. Congestion management is then considered in urban road TMCs through application of the Event Analysis of Systematic Teamwork (EAST) method based on observational data collected from four TMCs, Bristol, Cardiff, Dorset and Nottingham, in which the tasks, social agents, information and relationships between these elements are considered. The EAST method is then expanded to enable investigation into TMCs’ resilience, providing further knowledge about the domain. The later stages of the project are concerned with SCOOT validation, the process by which adaptively controlled traffic lights using SCOOT are set up to reflect real traffic conditions. The domain, using the current PC SCOOT Urban Traffic Control system, is assessed through Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA) with the findings used to propose areas suitable for development. One of these areas, STOC validation, is then developed further by applying Ecological Interface Design to develop an alternative display addressing limitations with PC SCOOT’s display. This concept display is then evaluated through two empirical experiments examining performance compared to traditional displays and investigating the role of experience within the domain. Finally, by using insights obtained into the STOC validation process an automated STOC selection algorithm is developed which has the potential to redefine how STOC validation is conducted...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Wireless mesh {{networks}} (WMN) {{have attracted}} considerable interest {{in recent years}} as a convenient, flexible and low-cost alternative to wired communication infrastructures in many contexts. However, the great majority of research on metropolitan-scale WMN has been centered around maximization of available bandwidth, suitable for non-real-time applications such as Internet access for the general public. On the other hand, the suitability of WMN for mission-critical infrastructure applications remains by and large unknown, as protocols typically employed in WMN are, for the most part, not designed for real-time communications. In this paper, we describe the Smart Transport and Roads Communications (STaRComm) project at National ICT Australia (NICTA), which sets a goal of designing a wireless mesh network architecture to solve the communication needs of the traffic control system in Sydney, Australia. This system, known as SCATS (Sydney Coordinated Adaptive Traffic System) and used in over 100 cities around the world, connects a hierarchy of several thousand devices — from individual traffic light controllers to regional computers and the central <b>Traffic</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Centre</b> (TMC) — and places stringent requirements on the reliability and latency of the data exchanges.

40|$|Intelligent Vehicles, as a {{main part}} of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), will have great impact on {{transportation}} in near future. They {{would be able to}} understand their immediate environment and also communicate with other traffic participants such as other vehicles, infrastructures and <b>traffic</b> <b>management</b> <b>centres.</b> Intelligent vehicles could navigate autonomously in highway and urban scenarios using maps, GPS, video sensors and so on. To navigate autonomously or follow a road, intelligent vehicles need to detect lanes. It seems that the best cue for lane detection is to use the lane markings painted on roads and it should be noticed that among passive and active sensors, the video sensors are the best candidate for finding lane markings. In this paper we present a method for lane detection in image sequences of a camera mounted behind the windshield of a vehicle. The main idea is to find the features of the lane in consecutive frames which match a particular geometric model. The geometric model is a parabola, an approximation of a circular curve. By mapping this model in image space and calculation of gradient image using Sobel operator, the parameters of the lane can be calculated using a randomized Hough transform and a genetic algorithm. The proposed method is tested on different road images taken by a video camera from Ghazvin-Rasht road in Iran. Experimental results on different road scenes indicate the good performance of the proposed method. 1...|$|R
