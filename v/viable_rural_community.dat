These short lived communities represented {{one of the few}} contexts in which both African American and non-African American groups lived and worked together within a <b>viable</b> <b>rural</b> <b>community.</b> By analyzing one such settlement, this study presents a basis for comparative functional analysis at the household level through the use of pattern identification of material culture. This study utilized both probate inventory assessments of the period and archeological material within the same classification scheme. Advantages and disadvantages of both data sources are also presented. While the data between the two groups showed little differentiation concerning household material composition, slight differences, particularly at the class level, was evident. These differences may have been based in socio-economic concerns or may have exhibited active consumer choice, reflecting minute aspects of cultural identity. Department of AnthropologyThesis (M.

By way of example, it summarises an empirical study of the content and delivery of tele-education among indigenous communities in Chiapas, Mexico. Findings: Developing and emerging economies and regions should prioritise effective and efficient rural education which incorporates practical and technical skills appropriate to the rural context in order to include {{young people in the}} agricultural development and agribusiness of rural areas. This means delivery of education that is rural, local and particular to the context, with appropriate technology, pedagogy and curriculum. Research limitations/implications: The concepts and argument are of wide significance. The case study findings should not be readily generalised but the implications will relevant to many remote and marginalised <b>communities</b> where the <b>rural</b> economy is weak, opportunities are few and education resources are scarce. Originality/value: The paper links different literatures and, by also drawing on empirical evidence consistent with the literature, makes a case for a significant reorientation of rural education towards appropriate life-skills in order to create <b>viable</b> <b>rural</b> livelihoods...|$|R

40|$|Rapid urbanisation, inequalities {{in income}} and service levels {{within and between}} communities, and {{population}} and economic decline are challenging the viability of <b>rural</b> <b>communities</b> worldwide. Achieving healthy and <b>viable</b> <b>rural</b> <b>communities</b> {{in the face of}} rapidly changing social, ecological and economic conditions is a declared global priority. As a result, governments all over the world, in both developed and developing countries, are now prioritizing rural and regional development through policies and programs aimed at enhancing the livelihoods of people living in rural regions. In recognition of the important roles that research can play in rural development, a range of systematic literature reviews have rightly examined key priorities in rural development including education, gender, economic development (especially agriculture), and health and nutrition (see Department for International Development [DFID], 2011). However, none of these works has systematically examined the extent to which rural development as a field of research is progressing towards facilitating sustainable change. This book evaluates trends in rural development research across the five continental regions of the world. Specifically, it assesses the total publication output relating to rural development, the types of publications, their quality and impact over the last three decades. Additionally, it evaluates the continental origins of the publications as well as the extent to which such publications engage with issues of sustainability. The aim is to determine whether the rural development field is growing in a manner that reflects research and policy priorities and broader social trends such as sustainability. Development policy makers, practitioners, those teaching research methods and systematic literature reviews to undergraduate and graduate students, and researchers in general will find the book both topical and highly relevant...|$|R

40|$|A {{major concern}} with {{fee-for-service}} reimbursement {{is that it}} forces consumers into predefined categories of service, whether or not those services meet their needs. The urban response to these incentives has been to experiment with capitated Medicare and Medicaid payments that inte-grate acute and long-term care funding. Although the use of capitation payments has conceptual and intuitive appeal, this article analyzes whether it is feasible in rural areas. Integrated financ-ing systems for rural areas must meet the specific goals of people served in the areas and be com-patible with local market conditions.

40|$|This chapter {{presents}} {{a selection of}} the range of different health service models that have been developed in rural Australia in response to local community needs, historical conditions and workforce composition. In 1975, the current Medical Benefits Schedule (MBS) was developed to support universal health care for all Australians. The MBS set the relative values of medical procedures and consultations, which were then used as the basis of the funding available to support the different types of medical practices. At that time, the usual type of medical health service was based on solo or small-group private medical practice. This medical care funding has not changed substantially in Australia over the last 30 years. State and territory governments are responsible for hospital care and the Australian Government is predominantly responsible for outpatient or community care. In many cases, the traditional model of clinical practice may not be <b>viable</b> in many <b>rural</b> <b>communities.</b> As doctors leave or retire from clinical practice in small communities, the burden of service delivery on doctors who remain increases. As a result, in the last decade, a health professional workforce shortage has developed in rural areas.

Given the wealth of political, professional and health related issues underlying the {{recruitment and retention}} of AHPs to rural areas, total resolution of this issue may not be possible.

40|$|Fothergill, M. (2007). Developing {{approaches}} {{to the use of}} forage legumes in upland environments to enhance biodiversity and produce balanced quality ruminant feed DEFRA Final Report LS 3646, 24 pp. Sponsorship: DEFRA LS 3646 Agriculture within the Less Favoured Areas of the UK (LFAs) is entering a new era in which the complex demands for sustainable, productive livestock farming have to be balanced with environmental protection. Previous intensification of farming has led to a loss of fragile habitats and a degradation of the environment. Yet many of Europe's most highly prized landscapes and natural habitats are found in these LFAs. Modern agricultural policies are aimed at inspiring farmers to regard themselves as guardians of the rural environment as well as food producers by encouraging the adoption of more sustainable {{approaches to}} land management. These systems must protect fragile environments and enhance ecosystem function. Restoring and controlling grassland diversity may be beneficial to maintaining desirable levels of several ecosystem processes, and may therefore have applications in land management and agriculture. Thus, the development and use of forage legumes that encourage the development of greater biodiversity, contribute to a reduction in environmental pollution from grassland and also provide adequate production by prudent use of natural resources is key to the successful development of sustainable upland farming. The successful development of such legumes is dependent upon a detailed understanding of the key traits underpinning these objectives. The overall objective of this research is to provide information to develop varieties for ruminant production systems that are economically, ethically and environmentally sustainable in the LFAs of the UK. Pasture and forage legumes provide locally produced, high quality feed of known origin and when grown within the appropriate system can provide a nutritionally balanced diet for the ruminant animal. Greater reliance on such pastures is regarded as the best way of developing low-input, economically viable systems of livestock production in the LFAs. Forage legumes with improved agronomic and nutritional qualities that can be grown in low nutrient status soils and allow the development of acceptable levels of diversity are essential to the development of these systems. Ecological theory suggests that the ability of ecosystems to buffer environmental disturbance and change, is related to species diversity. Upland environments are subject to a number of extreme biotic and abiotic stresses that limit the persistence and productivity of legumes and create fluctuations in agronomic performance. Species richness is important at a medium level for ecosystem functioning, thus understanding the relationships between soil/plant/animal processes is essential to develop criteria for variety improvement and material suitable for maintaining balanced swards necessary for the optimum ruminant diet and species richness. The project will support germplasm improvement in LS 3644 and LS 3645 and associated work in LS 3643 by contributing to a greater understanding of the mechanisms influencing tolerance of these factors. The resulting knowledge will be used to develop selection criteria leading to improvements in agronomic performance and overall diversity in upland environments. This will lead to the development of novel germplasm for direct use in LS 3644 as well as testing hypotheses relating to the factors affecting agronomic performance and co-existence in upland environments. It will also provide information to aid the protection of the environment by reducing pollution of surface and ground water resources together with the development of highly desirable improvements in sward diversity. The results from this project will also help improve the profitability of livestock farming in the LFAs and hence help to maintain <b>viable</b> <b>rural</b> <b>communities</b> in almost half the agricultural land of the UK whilst sustaining and enhancing rural environments. It will also enable farmers to produce meat from economically and environmentally sustainable livestock systems...|$|R
