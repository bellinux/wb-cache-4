40|$|AbstractThe {{roles of}} spinal N-methyl-d-aspartic acid {{receptor}} 2 B (NR 2 B) subunit in central sensitization of chronic visceral pain were investigated. A rat model with {{irritable bowel syndrome}} (IBS) was established by colorectal distention (CRD) on post-natal days 8 – 14. Responses of the external oblique muscle of the abdomen to CRD were measured to evaluate the sensitivity of visceral pain in rats. The sensitivity of visceral pain significantly increased in IBS-like rats. Expressions of spinal NR 2 B subunit and phosphorylated NR 2 B subunit significantly increased by 50 – 55 % in IBS-like rats when compared with those in control rats. Ro 25 - 6981, a selective antagonist of NR 2 B subunit, has a dose-dependent anti-allodynic and anti-hyperalgesic effect without causing motor dysfunction in IBS-like rats. Furthermore, the activation mechanism of the spinal NR 2 B subunit in chronic visceral pain was also investigated. Spinal administration of genistein, a specific inhibitor of tyrosine kinases, also decreased the <b>visceral</b> pain <b>hypersensitivity</b> of IBS-like rats in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the expression of phosphorylated NR 2 B subunit was decreased after spinal administration of Ro 25 - 6981 or genistein in IBS-like rats.

In addition, patients with these disorders often demonstrate a heightened sensitivity to experimental visceral stimulation, termed <b>visceral</b> pain <b>hypersensitivity</b> {{that is likely}} to be important in their pathophysiology. Knowledge of how the brain processes sensory information from visceral structures is still in its infancy. However, our understanding has been propelled by technological imaging advances such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Positron Emission Tomography, Magnetoencephalography, and Electroencephalography (EEG). Numerous human studies have non-invasively demonstrated the complexity involved in functional pain processing, and highlighted a number of subcortical and cortical regions involved. This review will focus on the neurophysiological pathways (primary afferents, spinal and supraspinal transmission), brain-imaging techniques and the influence of endogenous and psychological processes in healthy controls and patients suffering from functional gastrointestinal disorders. Special attention will be paid to the newer EEG source analysis techniques. Understanding the phenotypic differences that determine an individual’s response to injurious stimuli could be the key to understanding why some patients develop pain and hyperalgesia in response to inflammation/injury while others do not. For future studies, an integrated approach is required incorporating an individual’s psychological, autonomic, neuroendocrine, neurophysiological, and genetic profile to define phenotypic traits that may be at greater risk of developing sensitised states in response to gut inflammation or injury...|$|R
50|$|The lateral hypothalamus, {{also called}} the lateral {{hypothalamic}} area, contains the primary orexinergic nucleus within the hypothalamus that widely projects throughout the nervous system; this system of neurons mediates an array of cognitive and physical processes, such as promoting feeding behavior and arousal, reducing pain perception, and regulating body temperature, digestive functions, and blood pressure, among many others. Clinically significant disorders that involve dysfunctions of the orexinergic projection system include narcolepsy, motility disorders or functional gastrointestinal disorders involving <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome), and eating disorders.|$|E
5000|$|CFAP is {{characterized}} by chronic pain, with no physical explanation or findings (no structural, infectious, or mechanical causes can be found). It is theorized that CFAP is a disorder {{of the nervous system}} where normal nociceptive nerve impulses are amplified [...] "like a stereo system turned up too loud" [...] resulting in pain. This <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> may be a stand-alone cause of CFAP, or CFAP may result from the same type of brain-gut nervous system disorder that underlies IBS. As with IBS, low doses of antidepressants have been found useful in controlling the pain of CFAP.|$|E
50|$|In the {{gastrointestinal}} tract, mucosal {{mast cells}} {{are located in}} close proximity to sensory nerve fibres, which communicate bidirectionally. When these mast cells initially degranulate, they release mediators (e.g., histamine, tryptase, and serotonin) which activate, sensitize, and upregulate membrane expression of nociceptors (i.e., TRPV1) on visceral afferent neurons via their receptors (respectively, HRH1, HRH2, HRH3, PAR2, 5-HT3); in turn, neurogenic inflammation, <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity,</b> and intestinal dysmotility (i.e., impaired peristalsis) result. Neuronal activation induces neuropeptide (substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide) signaling to mast cells where they bind to their associated receptors and trigger degranulation of a distinct set of mediators (β-Hexosaminidase, cytokines, chemokines, PGD2, leukotrienes, and eoxins).|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUNDS AND OBJECTIVES: Visceral pain shows many {{pathophysiological}} {{properties that}} make this form of pain unique, {{not only because of}} the clinical properties of the sensation but also because the neurobiological mechanisms that mediate the sensory process. This study aimed at reviewing the pathophysiology of visceral pain. CONTENTS: The activation and sensitization of visceral nociceptors are heavily influenced by the secretory and motor properties of the microenvironment where the sensory receptors are located. In some cases, epithelial cells can play a direct role in the activation of primary sensory neurons. Subclinical alterations of the visceral epithelium can contribute to enhanced <b>visceral</b> sensitivity. Central <b>hypersensitivity</b> induced by <b>visceral</b> activation can be caused by mobilization of AMPA receptors from the cytosol to the membrane of nociceptive neurons. In addition, functional pain syndromes, such as the Irritable Bowel Syndrome, could be triggered or maintained by hormonal alterations, particularly those involving sex hormones such as estrogen. CONCLUSION: The neurobiological mechanisms that mediate visceral pain are sufficiently unique to preclude interpreting visceral pain conditions purely as a direct extrapolation of what we know about somatic pain. The functional properties of visceral nociceptors are different from those of their somatic counterparts and the microenvironment where visceral nociceptors are located, and especially the motor and secretory functions of organs like the gut, play a key role in the activation and sensitization of visceral sensory receptors...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) affects 40 % of Western populations. Many {{symptoms}} persist {{despite the}} resolution of inflammation or acid exposure. In these patients, <b>visceral</b> pain <b>hypersensitivity</b> (VPH), modulated peripherally and centrally, {{is believed to be}} important. Study 1 : Full thickness human oesophageal samples were collected from 10 patients undergoing oesophagectomy. Using immunohistochemistry, the samples were stained with PGP 9. 5, synapthophysin, TRPV 1, TRPV 4 and ASIC 3. Within healthy areas of the human oesophagus, immunoreactive nerve fibres and ganglia were identified in the sub-epithelium and myenteric plexus. Within the epithelium, nerve endings were absent; however, ASIC 3 was reliably identified in epitheliocytes. Study 2 : Oesophageal biopsy samples from 36 individuals were collected during upper GI endoscopy; erosive oesophagitis, non-erosive reflux disease and controls. Symptoms were profiled using symptom severity scores, adapted from a validated questionnaire. Oesophageal mucosal biopsies were taken 3 - 5 cm above the lower oesophageal sphincter. Specific features of oesophageal mucosal epithelial ASIC 3 were identified by immunohistochemistry, which were associated positively with an increase in symptom severity. Study 3 : Oesophageal VPH can be induced in healthy volunteers using an established model of acid infusion. In total, 85 retrospective infusions from 57 volunteers were studied, and VPH was present in 70 %. The model was shown to be safe and reproducible, but reliability of the model for drug studies was only valid provided control measures were observed. Study 4 : Pregabalin is a centrally acting calcium channel blocker currently used for somatic neuropathic pain and partial seizures. Using the model described in study 3, a prospective, double-blinded, cross-over, placebo-controlled study in 15 healthy volunteers was performed. After an initial screening visit, the volunteers were randomised to either pregabalin or placebo. Pregabalin prevented or attenuated VPH at 30 and 90 minutes after acid sensitisation. Conclusion: The evidence for central sensitisation was further consolidated with the pregabalin study and peripheral sensitisation by the ASIC 3 study. The evidence is important in the detection of predominant mechanisms underlying the symptoms of patients with GORD for both cohort development and targeted treatment.

40|$|For years, {{a set of}} bowel-related {{symptoms}} and signs manifesting in diverse combinations, {{in the absence of}} a documented "organic" cause, have been collectively described under the term irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Dating back from initial description of the syndrome, its close proximity to emotional distress and psychological or even psychiatric disorders has led to the conclusion that it represented a repertoire of psychosomatic manifestations. Since then, additional evidence has offered intriguing alternative pathogenetic pathways: <b>visceral</b> dysmotility or <b>hypersensitivity,</b> low-grade intestinal inflammation, presence of increased/altered microbial populations and their metabolites, persistent post-infectious changes in hormones, cytokines and immune cells. The line between the syndrome and more severe inflammatory diseases became thinner due to the observation that IBS could precede or co-exist with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and the discovery of common genetic background in IBS, IBD and celiac disease patients. Similarly, the detection of various antibodies ie against microbial components (flagellin), food antigens or "autoantibodies", also involved in the pathogenesis of IBD, celiac disease or endocrine disorders, have made this matter even foggier. In the present chapter, all these important data are presented and critically evaluated while addressing issues associated with grey areas ie those between food intolerance or gluten sensitivity and IBS, and the implication of the brain-gut axis in the onset of the syndrome. Finally, the "pros" and "cons" of different theories about the pathogenesis of IBS are weighed, and hard evidence is used for "drawing lines" between IBS subsets which in turn allow correct stratification of IBS patients thus, allowing a better and more individualized/tailored therapeutic approach. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

5000|$|Mast {{cells and}} the {{compound}} that they secrete {{are central to}} the pathophysiology and implicated in the treatment of IBS; some of the secreted mast cell mediators (and associated receptors) which have been implicated in symptoms of IBS or specific subtypes include: histamine (HRH1, HRH2, HRH3), tryptase and chymase (PAR2), serotonin (5-HT3), PGD2 (DP1). [...] Histamine also causes epithelial secretion of chloride ions and water (associated with secretory diarrhea) by signaling through a receptor or ligand-gated ion channel that has not been identified as of 2015. [...] A 2015 review noted that both H1-antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers have shown efficacy in reducing pain associated with <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> in IBS; other lower quality studies have also suggested the benefit of these agents for IBS. In a related review on idiopathic mast cell activation syndromes (including IBS), a combined treatment approach using antileukotrienes, H1/H2-antihistamines, and a mast cell stabilizer are suggested.|$|E
50|$|Bloating from {{irritable}} bowel syndrome (IBS) is {{of unknown}} origin but often results from {{an insult to the}} gut, and as such can overlap with infective diarrhea, celiac, and inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis). IBS is a brain-gut dysfunction that causes <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> and results in bloating in association with recurrent diarrhea (or constipation) and abdominal pain. While there is no direct treatment for the underlying pathology of IBS, the symptom of bloating can be well managed through dietary changes that prevent the over-reaction of the gastrocolic reflex. Having soluble fiber foods and supplements, substituting dairy with soy or rice products, being careful with fresh fruits and vegetables that are high in insoluble fiber, and eating regular small amounts can all help to lessen the symptoms of IBS (Van Vorous 2000). Foods and beverages to be avoided or minimized include red meat, oily, fatty and fried products, dairy (even when there is no lactose intolerance), solid chocolate, coffee (regular and decaffeinated), alcohol, carbonated beverages, especially those also containing sorbitol, and artificial sweeteners (Van Vorous 2000). IBS is most commonly found in patients around the age of 20 and is found more often in women than men. In people with IBS, the intestines squeeze too hard or not hard enough and cause food to move too quickly or too slowly through the intestines. Other terms used to describe this condition include spastic bowel, spastic colon, and irritable colon. Symptoms of the condition will worsen as a person is placed under stress, during travel, and at other times when the daily routine is tampered with. Common symptoms include bloating, constipation, abdominal cramp or pain after bowel movement, or feeling like a movement is required even after one has been completed.|$|E

The aim of the work described in this thesis was to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} stress-related pathophysiology of <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity.</b> Investigations were carried out in the rat model of maternal separation. Because others already indicated that mast cells may be involved in post-stress <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity,</b> we first set out to confirm these observations in our animal model in chapter 2. Next we investigated the role of nerve growth factor (NGF) because, in addition to histamine, it is one of the mast cell mediators known to modulate transient receptor ion channel 1 (TRPVl). We used two different TRPVl antagonists to evaluate the functional role of TRPVl in post-stress <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity.</b> In chapter 3 we focused on the possible role of corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH). We evaluated whether there is such a thing as prolonged post-stress mast cell-dependent <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> in maternally separated rats using the antagonist α-helical CRF (9 - 41). In chapter 4, we tested two peripherally restricted H 1 R antagonists for their capacity to reverse post-stress <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity.</b> IBS transfer across generations may largely depend on environmental factors. Therefore, in chapter 5, we used our animal model to investigate whether susceptibility to stress-induced <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> in maternally separated Long Evans rats can be transferred across generations without further separation protocols and, if so, whether this depends on maternal care...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTemporomandibular {{disorder}} and {{irritable bowel syndrome}} are comorbid functional chronic pain disorders of unknown etiology that are triggered/exacerbated by stress. Here we present baseline phenotypic characterization of a novel animal model to gain insight into the underlying mechanisms that contribute to such comorbid pain conditions. In this model, chronic <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity,</b> a defining symptom of irritable bowel syndrome, is dependent on 3 factors: estradiol, existing chronic somatic pain, and stress. In ovariectomized rats, estradiol replacement followed by craniofacial muscle injury and stress induced <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> that persisted for months. Omission of any 1 factor resulted in a transient (1  week) <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> from stress alone or no hypersensitivity (no inflammation or estradiol). Maintenance of <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> was estradiol dependent, resolving when estradiol replacement ceased. Referred cutaneous hypersensitivity was concurrent with <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity.</b> Increased spinal Fos expression suggests induction of central sensitization. These data demonstrate the development and maintenance of <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> in estradiol-replaced animals following distal somatic injury and stress that mimics some characteristics reported in patients with temporomandibular {{disorder and}} comorbid irritable bowel syndrome. This new animal model is a powerful experimental tool that can be employed to gain further mechanistic insight into overlapping pain conditions. PerspectiveThe majority of patients with temporomandibular disorder report symptoms consistent with irritable bowel syndrome. Stress and female prevalence are common to both conditions. In a new experimental paradigm in ovariectomized rats with estradiol replacement, masseter inflammation followed by stress induces <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> that persists for months, modeling these comorbid pain conditions...|$|E
40|$|Separation of newborn rats {{from their}} mothers induces <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> and {{impaired}} epithelial secretory cell lineages when they are adults. Little {{is known about the}} mechanisms by which maternal separation causes <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> or its relationship with defects in epithelial secretory cell lineages. We performed studies with C 3 H/HeN mice separated {{from their mothers}} as newborns and mice genetically engineered (Sox 9 flox/flox-vil-cre on C 57 BL/ 6 background) to have deficiencies in Paneth cells. Paneth cells deficiency was assessed by lysozyme staining of ileum tissues and lysozyme activity in fecal samples. When mice were 50 days old, their abdominal response to colorectal distension was assessed by electromyography. Fecal samples were collected and microbiota were analyzed using GULDA quantitative PCR. Mice with maternal separation developed <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> and defects in Paneth cells, as reported from rats, compared to mice without maternal separation. Sox 9 flox/flox-vil-Cre mice also had increased <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> compared to control littermate Sox 9 flox/flox mice. Fecal samples from mice with maternal separation and from Sox 9 flox/flox-vil-cre mice had evidence for intestinal dysbiosis of the microbiota, characterized by expansion of Escherichia coli. Daily gavage of conventional C 3 H/HeN adult mice with 109 commensal E. coli induced <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity.</b> Conversely, daily oral administration of lysozyme prevented expansion of E. coli during maternal separation and <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity.</b> Mice with defects in Paneth cells (induced by maternal separation or genetically engineered) have intestinal expansion of E. coli leading to <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity.</b> These findings provide evidence that Paneth cell function and intestinal dysbiosis are involved in visceral sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND & AIMS: <b>Visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> is {{one feature}} of {{irritable}} bowel syndrome (IBS). Bacterial dysbiosis might be involved in activation of nociceptive sensory pathways, {{but there have been}} few studies {{of the role of the}} mycobiome (the fungal microbiome) in development of IBS. We analyzed intestinal mycobiomes of patients with IBS and a rat model of <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity.</b> METHODS: We used internal transcribed spacer 1 -based metabarcoding to compare fecal mycobiomes of 18 healthy volunteers with those of 39 patients with IBS (with <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> or normal levels of sensitivity). We also compared the mycobiomes of Long Evans rats separated from their mothers (hypersensitive) with non-handled (normally sensitive) rats. We investigated whether fungi can cause <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> using rats exposed to fungicide (fluconazole and nystatin). The functional relevance of the gut mycobiome was confirmed in fecal transplantation experiments: adult maternally separated rats were subjected to water avoidance stress (to induce <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity),</b> then given fungicide and donor cecum content via oral gavage. Other rats subjected to water avoidance stress were given soluble β-glucans, which antagonize C-type lectin domain family 7 member A (CLEC 7 A or DECTIN 1) signaling via spleen associated tyrosine kinase (SYK), a SYK inhibitor to reduce <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity,</b> or vehicle (control). The sensitivity of mast cells to fungi was tested with mesenteric windows (ex vivo) and the human mast cell line HMC- 1. RESULTS: α diversity (Shannon index) and mycobiome signature (stability selection) of both groups of IBS patients differed from healthy volunteers, and the mycobiome signature of hypersensitive patients differed from that of normally sensitive patients. We observed mycobiome dysbiosis in rats that had been separated from their mothers compared with non-handled rats. Administration of fungicide to hypersensitive rats reduced their <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> to normal levels of sensitivity. Administration of cecal mycobiomes from rats that had been separated from their mothers (but not non-handled mycobiome) restored hypersensitivity to distension. Administration of soluble β-glucans or a SYK inhibitor reduced <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity,</b> compared with controls. Particulate β-glucan (a DECTIN- 1 agonist) induced mast cell degranulation in mesenteric windows and HMC- 1 cells responded to fungal antigens by release of histamine. CONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of patients with IBS and controls, we associated fungal dysbiosis with IBS. In studies of rats, we found fungi to promote <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity,</b> which could be reduced by administration of fungicides, soluble β-glucans, or a SYK inhibitor.

40|$|Neonatal {{maternal}} separation (MS) {{is a major}} {{early life}} stress that {{increases the risk of}} emotional disorders, visceral pain perception and other brain dysfunction. Elevation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4) signaling in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) precipitates early life colorectal distension (CRD) -induced <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> and pain in adulthood. The present study aimed to investigate the role of TLR 4 signaling in the pathogenesis of postnatal MS-induced <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> and pain during adulthood. The TLR 4 gene was selectively knocked out in C 57 BL/ 10 ScSn mice (Tlr 4 -/-). MS was developed by housing the offspring alone for 6 h daily from postnatal day 2 to day 15. <b>Visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> and pain were assessed in adulthood. Tlr 4 +/+, but not Tlr 4 -/-, mice that had experienced neonatal MS showed chronic <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> and pain. TLR 4 immunoreactivity was observed predominately in microglia in the PVN, and MS was associated with an increase in the expression of protein and/or mRNA levels of TLR 4, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), CRF receptor 1 (CRFR 1), tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin- 1 β in Tlr 4 +/+ mice. These alterations were not observed in Tlr 4 -/- mice. Local administration of lipopolysaccharide, a TLR 4 agonist, into the lateral cerebral ventricle elicited <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> and TLR 4 mRNA expression in the PVN, which could be prevented by NBI- 35965, an antagonist to CRFR 1.

40|$|Irritable bowel {{syndrome}} (IBS) is {{a functional}} gastrointestinal disorder, with the characteristic symptoms of chronic abdominal pain and altered bowel habits (diarrhea, constipation, or both).

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> is a {{clinical}} observation made when diagnosing patients with functional bowel disorders. The cause of <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> is unknown but {{is thought to}} be attributed to inflammation. Previously we demonstrated that a unique set of enteric neurons, colospinal afferent neurons (CANs), co-localize with the NR 1 and NR 2 D subunits of the NMDA receptor {{as well as with the}} PAR 2 receptor. The aim of this study was to determine if NMDA and PAR 2 receptors expressed on CANs contribute to <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> following inflammation. Recently, work has suggested that dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons expressing the transient receptor potential vanilloid- 1 (TRPV 1) receptor mediate inflammation induced <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity.</b> Therefore, in order to study CAN involvement in <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity,</b> DRG neurons expressing the TRPV 1 receptor were lesioned with resiniferatoxin (RTX) prior to inflammation and behavioural testing. Results CANs do not express the TRPV 1 receptor; therefore, they survive following RTX injection. RTX treatment resulted in a significant decrease in TRPV 1 expressing neurons in the colon and immunohistochemical analysis revealed no change in peptide or receptor expression in CANs following RTX lesioning as compared to control data. Behavioral studies determined that both inflamed non-RTX and RTX animals showed a decrease in balloon pressure threshold as compared to controls. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that the NR 1 cassettes, N 1 and C 1, of the NMDA receptor on CANs were up-regulated following inflammation. Furthermore, inflammation resulted in the activation of the PAR 2 receptors expressed on CANs. Conclusion Our data show that inflammation causes an up-regulation of the NMDA receptor and the activation of the PAR 2 receptor expressed on CANs. These changes are associated with a decrease in balloon pressure in response to colorectal distension in non-RTX and RTX lesioned animals. Therefore, these data suggest that CANs contribute to <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> during inflammation. </p...|$|E

40|$|At present, {{the concept}} of <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> {{provides}} the leading hypothesis regarding the generation of symptoms in functional gastrointestinal disorders. This paper discusses the current clinical evidence for drugs that have been proposed to interfere with visceral sensitivity in functional gastrointestinal disorders. Several possible pharmacological targets have been identified to reduce visceral pain and to reverse the processes underlying the persistence of <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity.</b> However, most of the available evidence comes from experimental animal models and cannot simply be extrapolated to patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders. In this review, we selected five drug classes that {{have been shown to}} exhibit visceral analgesic properties in experimental studies, and of which data were available regarding their clinical efficacy. These included opioid substances, serotonergic agents, antidepressants, somatostatin analogues and alpha(2) -adrenergic agonists. Although clinical trials show a limited benefit, in particular for serotonergic agents, the evidence illustrating that these effects result from normalization of visceral sensation is currently lacking. Therefore, we conclude that {{the concept of}} targeting <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> as a treatment for functional gastrointestinal disorders is still controversial.

40|$|Background  Acute stress-induced {{hypersensitivity}} to colorectal distention {{was shown}} to depend on corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) -induced mast cell degranulation. At present it remains unclear whether CRF also induces chronic poststress activation of these cells. Accordingly, {{the objective of this}} study was to compare pre- and poststress CRF-receptor antagonist treatment protocols for their ability to, respectively, prevent and reverse mast cell dependent <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> in a rat model of neonatal maternal separation. Methods  The visceromotor response to colonic distention was assessed in adult maternally separated and non-handled rats before and at different time points after 1  h of water avoidance (WA). Rats were treated with the mast cell stabilizer doxantrazole and the CRF receptor-antagonist α-helical-CRF (9 - 41). Western blotting was used to assess mucosal protein levels of the mast cell protease RMCP- 2 and the tight junction protein occludin. Key Results  In maternally separated, but not in non-handled rats, WA induced chronic hypersensitivity (up to 30  days) to colorectal distention. <b>Visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> was prevented, but could not be reversed by administration of α-helical-CRF (9 - 41). In contrast, however, the mast cell stabilizer doxantrazole reversed <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity.</b> Compared with vehicle-treated rats, pre-WA α-helical-CRF (9 - 41) treated animals displayed higher mucosal RMCP- 2 and occludin levels. Conclusions & Inferences  Water avoidance-stress leads to persistent mast cell dependent <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> in maternally separated rats, which can be prevented, but not reversed by blockade of peripheral CRF-receptors. We conclude that persistent poststress mast cell activation and subsequent <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> are not targeted by CRF-receptor antagonists. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|<b>Visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in motor and sensory abnormalities associated with irritable bowel syndrome, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. The present study was designed to evaluate the expression of the 5 -HT 4 receptor and the serotonin transporter (SERT) as well as their roles in chronic <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> using a rat model. Neonatal male Sprague-Dawley rats received intracolonic injections of 0. 5 % acetic acid (0. 3 - 0. 5 mL at different times) between postnatal days 8 and 21 to establish an animal model of <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity.</b> On day 43, the threshold intensity for a visually identifiable contraction of the abdominal wall and body arching were recorded during rectal distention. Histological evaluation and the myeloperoxidase activity assay were performed to determine the severity of inflammation. The 5 -HT 4 receptor and SERT expression of the ascending colon were monitored using immunohistochemistry and Western blot analyses; the plasma 5 -HT levels were measured using an ELISA method. As expected, transient colonic irritation at the neonatal stage led to <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity,</b> but no mucosal inflammation was later detected during adulthood. Using this model, we found reduced SERT expression (0. 298 ± 0. 038 vs 0. 634 ± 0. 200, P < 0. 05) and increased 5 -HT 4 receptor expression (0. 308 ± 0. 017 vs 0. 298 ± 0. 021, P < 0. 05). Treatment with fluoxetine (10 mg·kg- 1 ·day- 1, days 36 - 42), tegaserod (1 mg·kg- 1 ·day- 1, day 43), or the combination of both, reduced <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> and plasma 5 -HT levels. Fluoxetine treatment increased 5 -HT 4 receptor expression (0. 322 ± 0. 020 vs 0. 308 ± 0. 017, P < 0. 01) but not SERT expression (0. 219 ± 0. 039 vs 0. 298 ± 0. 038, P = 0. 654). These results indicate that both the 5 -HT 4 receptor and SERT play a role in the pathogenesis of <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity,</b> and its mechanism may be involved in the local 5 -HT level...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims: Crohn’s Disease (CD), {{a chronic}} Inflammatory Bowel Disease, {{can occur in}} any part of the {{gastrointestinal}} tract, but most frequently in the ileum. <b>Visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> contributes for development of chronic abdominal pain in this disease. Currently, the understanding of the mechanism underlying hypersensitivity of Crohn’s ileitis has been hindered by a lack of specific animal model. The present study is undertaken to investigate the <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> provoked by 2, 4, 6 -trinitrobenzene sulfonic (TNBS) -induced ileitis rats. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were anaesthetized and laparotomized for intraileal injection of TNBS (0. 6 ml, 80 mg/kg body weight in 30 % ethanol, n = 48), an equal volume of 30 % Ethanol (n = 24) and Saline (n = 24), respectively. <b>Visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> was assessed by visceromotor responses (VMR) to 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 mmHg colorectal distension pressure (CRD) at day 1, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28. Immediately after CRD test, the rats were euthanized for collecting the terminal ileal segment for histopathological examinations and ELISA of myleoperoxidase and cytokines (TNF-α, IL- 1 β, IL- 6), and dorsal root ganglia (T 11) for determination of calcitonin gene-related peptide by immunohistochemistry, respectively. Results: Among all groups, TNBS-treatment showed transmural inflammation initially at 3 days, reached maximum at 7 days and persisted up to 21 days. The rats with ileitis exhibited (P < 0. 05) VMR to CRD at day 7 to day 21. The calcitonin gene-related peptide-immunoreactive positive cells increased (P < 0. 05) in dorsal root ganglia at day 7 to 21, which was persistently consistent with <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> in TNBS-treated rats. Conclusions: TNBS injection into the ileum induced transmural ileitis including granuloma and <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity.</b> As this model mimics clinical manifestations of CD, it may provide a road map to probe the pathogenesis of gut inflammation and <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity,</b> as well as for establishing the therapeutic protocol for Crohn’s ileitis...|$|E
40|$|<b>Visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> (perception of {{gastrointestinal}} sensory {{events at}} a lower-than-normal threshold) {{is considered to}} be an important pathophysiological mechanism in the development of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), such as irritable bowel syndrome, non-cardiac chest pain and functional dyspepsia. These disorders are associated with significant health care and socioeconomic costs due to factors such as repeated visits to consultants, hospitalizations and work absenteeism. Despite the presence of extensive evidence linking <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> and FGIDs, the mechanism(s) underlying <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> has not been fully elucidated. Suggested hypotheses include sensitization of afferent neurones, both {{at the level of the}} enteric and the (afferent) autonomic nervous system (peripheral sensitization), sensitization of spinal cord dorsal horn neurones (central sensitization) and psychosocial factors/psychiatric comorbidity influencing the processing of afferent signals at the level of the brain. Importantly, these hypotheses may be complementary rather than mutually exclusive. However, the degree to which each of these mechanisms contributes to the overall perception of visceral pain, and therefore the generation of symptoms, still remains unclear. This article discusses the mechanisms that may underlie <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity,</b> with reference to FGIDs. Understanding these mechanisms is essential in order to improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients with these disorders. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Background: Many {{patients}} with {{irritable bowel syndrome}} (IBS) have lowered sensory thresholds to rectal distention when compared to control subjects, a phenomenon called <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity.</b> Aim: To investigate the usefulness of a rectal barostat as a diagnostic tool in IBS {{and if there are}} differences in <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> in different groups of IBS patients. Patients and Methods: Ten healthy subjects and 19 IBS patients, defined using Rome II criteria (12 with constipation, three with diarrhea and four alternating between diarrhea and constipation), were studied. Sequential isobaric rectal distentions, from 2 mmHg up to a maximal pressure of 52 mmHg or when the patients reported pain, were carried out. <b>Visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> was defined as a pain threshold under 38 mmHg. Results: Only 26 % of IBS patients had <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> (16 % and 43 % of {{patients with}} IBS and constipation and IBS and diarrhea or alternating symptoms, respectively, p =NS).

40|$|Irritable bowel {{syndrome}} (IBS) is {{a common}} gastrointestinal disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain and alteration of bowel movements. The pathogenesis of <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> in IBS patients remains largely unknown. Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) is reported {{to play an important}} role in development of visceral hyperalgesia. However, the role of H 2 S at spinal dorsal horn level remains elusive in <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity.</b> The aim of this study is designed to investigate how H 2 S takes part in <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> of adult rats with neonatal colonic inflammation (NCI). <b>Visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> was induced by neonatal colonic injection of diluted acetic acid. Expression of an endogenous H 2 S synthesizing enzyme cystathionine β-synthetase (CBS) was determined by Western blot. Excitability and synaptic transmission of neurons in the substantia gelatinosa (SG) of spinal cord was recorded by patch clamping. Here, we showed that expression of CBS in the spinal dorsal horn was significantly upregulated in NCI rats. The frequency of glutamatergic synaptic activities in SG was markedly enhanced in NCI rats when compared with control rats. Application of NaHS increased the frequency of both spontaneous and miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents of SG neurons in control rats through a presynaptic mechanism. In contrast, application of AOAA, an inhibitor of CBS, dramatically suppressed the frequency of glutamatergic synaptic activities of SG neurons of NCI rats. Importantly, intrathecal injection of AOAA remarkably attenuated <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> of NCI rats. These results suggest that H 2 S modulates pain signaling likely through a presynaptic mechanism in SG of spinal dorsal horn, thus providing a potential therapeutic strategy for treatment for chronic visceral pain in patients with IBS...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Repeated {{exposure}} to stress leads to mast cell degranulation, microscopic inflammation, and subsequent <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> in animal models. To what extent this pathophysiological pathway {{has a role}} in patients with the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has not been properly investigated. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the relationship between <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity,</b> microscopic inflammation, and the stress response in IBS. METHODS: Microscopic inflammation of the colonic mucosa was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 66 IBS patients and 20 healthy volunteers (HV). Rectal sensitivity was assessed by a barostat study using an intermittent pressure-controlled distension protocol. Salivary cortisol to a psychological stress was measured to assess the stress response. RESULTS: Compared with HV, mast cells, T cells, and macrophages were decreased in IBS patients. Similarly, lambda-free light chain (FLC) -positive mast cells were decreased but not immunoglobulin E (IgE) - and IgG-positive mast cells. There were no differences between hypersensitive and normosensitive IBS patients. No relation was found between any of the immune cells studied and the thresholds of discomfort, urge, first sensation, or IBS symptoms (e. g., abdominal pain, stool-related complaints, bloating). Finally, stress-related symptoms and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis response to stress were not correlated with the number of mast cells or the presence of <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Although the number of mast cells, macrophages, T cells, and. FLC-positive mast cells is decreased in IBS compared with HV, this is not associated with the presence of <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> or abnormal stress response.

40|$|<b>Visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> is now {{recognised}} {{as a major}} pathophysiological {{mechanism in}} functional gastrointestinal disorders of the upper gastrointestinal tract. In patients with non-cardiac chest pain and functional dyspepsia, a high prevalence of <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> has been indeed observed. In these patients, luminal physiological stimuli can be perceived as unpleasant or even painful. Although the fine mechanisms underlying such "aberrant perceptions" are yet not fully clarified, {{it is thought that}} an altered activation of the gut-wall receptors, an altered conduction of sensory inputs at the level of neural pathways, or an impaired processing of the sensations at the level of brain, may occur along the brain-gut axis. So far, drugs able to reduce hypersensitivity, that target each of the constituents of the stimuli-perception chain, have the therapeutic potential to reduce <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> and, thus, to improve the symptoms. In this context, the availability of new agonists/antagonists to neurotransmitters offers a new exciting tool for the treatment of functional disorders of the upper gastrointestinal tract. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Chronic visceral pain in {{patients}} with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) {{has been difficult to}} treat effectively partially because its pathophysiology is not fully understood. Recent studies show that norepinephrine (NE) {{plays an important role in}} the development of <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity.</b> In this study, we designed to investigate the role of adrenergic signaling in <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> induced by heterotypical intermittent stress (HIS). Abdominal withdrawal reflex scores (AWRs) used as visceral sensitivity were determined by measuring the visceromoter responses to colorectal distension. Colon-specific dorsal root ganglia neurons (DRGs) were labeled by injection of DiI into the colon wall and were acutely dissociated for whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. Blood plasma level of NE was measured using radioimmunoassay kits. The expression of b 2 -adrenoceptors was measured by western blotting. We showed that HIS-induced <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> was attenuated by systemic administration of a b-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol, in a dose-dependent manner, but not by a a-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine. Using specific b–adrenoceptor antagonists, HIS-induced <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> was alleviated by b 2 adrenoceptor antagonist but not by b 1 - or b 3 -adrenoceptor antagonist. Administration of a selective b 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist also normalized hyperexcitability of colon-innervating DRG neurons of HIS rats. Furthermore, administration of b-adrenoceptor antagonist suppressed sustained potassium current density (IK) without any alteration of fast-inactivating potassium current density (IA).

However, the role of TRPA 1 in visceral nociception during post-inflammatory states is not well defined. Here, we explore the correlation between TRPA 1 expression in the spinal dorsal horn (SDH) and persistent post-inflammatory <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity.</b> Methods: We injected rats intracolonically with 2, 4, 6 -trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) or vehicle (n= 12 per group). Post-inflammatory <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> was assessed by recording the electromyographic activity of the external oblique muscle in response to colorectal distension. TRPA 1 expression and distribution in the spinal cord and colon were examined by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Results: Animals exposed to TNBS had more abdominal contractions than vehicle-injected controls (P< 0. 05), which corresponded to a lower nociceptive threshold. Expression of TRPA 1 in the SDH (especially in the substantia gelatinosa) and the colon was significantly greater in the TNBS-treated group than in controls (P< 0. 05). In the SDH, the number of TRPA 1 -immunopositive neurons was 25. 75 ± 5. 12 in the control group and 34. 25 ± 7. 89 in the TNBS-treated group (P= 0. 023), and integrated optical density values of TRPA 1 in the control and TNBS-treated groups were 14, 544. 63 ± 6, 525. 54 and 22, 532. 75 ± 7, 608. 11, respectively (P= 0. 041). Conclusion: Our results indicate that upregulation of TRPA 1 expression in the SDH is associated with persistent post-inflammatory <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> in the rat and provides insight into potential therapeutic targets for the control of persistent <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity.</b> Keywords: TRPA 1, post-inflammatory <b>visceral</b> <b>hypersensitivity,</b> spinal dorsal horn, substantia gelatinos...|$|E
