In this view, the issue of the European Commission Green Book in 1997 - on ports and sea infrastructures - and that of the White Book in 1998 - referring to a fair set of fees to exploit infrastructures with an approach in stages in an UE context - led again to the debate on criteria to set transport infrastructures fees, particularly for ports.

DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Analysis of 2015 Medicare claims data for an initial outpatient appointment with a consultant physician (Item 110) in 11 medical specialties representative of common adult non-surgical medical care (cardiology, endocrinology, gastroenterology, geriatric medicine, haematology, immunology/allergy, medical oncology, nephrology, neurology, respiratory medicine and rheumatology). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mean, median, 10 th and 90 th percentile levels for consultant physician fees and out-of-pocket costs, by medical specialty and state or territory; bulk-billing rate, by medical specialty and state/territory. RESULTS: Bulk-billing rates varied between specialties, with only haematology and medical oncology bulk-billing {{more than half of}} initial consultations. Bulk-billing rates also varied between states and territories, with rates in the Northern Territory (76 %) nearly double those elsewhere. Most private consultations require a significant out-of-pocket payment by the patient, and these payments varied more than fivefold in some specialties. CONCLUSION: Without data on quality of care in private outpatient services, the rationale for the marked <b>variations</b> in <b>fees</b> within specialties is unknown.

Recent work in behavioral finance suggests that investors do not make optimal investment decisions in their DC plans. The authors designed and administered a pair of mutual fund choice experiments to over 1000 survey respondents who participate in the RAND American Life Panel. Their analysis sheds light {{on the question of}} how mutual fund investors respond to <b>variation</b> in <b>fees</b> in a hypothetical scenario in which fees should be obvious to the investor. The results show that some aspects of individual behavior are consistent with rational wealth-maximization and the majority of the respondents are able to provide estimates of fees that lie within a benchmark range. However, they find that respondents tend not to minimize expected fees and are more averse to backend load fees than to front-end loads. The trade-off between expense ratios and loads is found to be somewhat sensitive to the expected holding period {{in a manner consistent with}} expected-wealth maximization, but investors may tend to be too averse to loads. Differences in measured financial literacy predict differences in behavior, with lower rates of literacy among women accounting for differences in choice behavior by gender. They also find that financial literacy mediates individual responses to the presentation of information intended to enhance decision making. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} factors {{affecting}} {{the level of}} audit fees paid by companies to their auditors. Firstly, all the likely factors thought to be affecting the level of audit fees were identified through a literature survey. These factors were classified into three groups i. e., size, complexity, and others. The relative importance of these factors was determined empirically and statistically. The empirical study was undertaken by mailing two questionnaires to samples of 100 companies, and 100 audit firms. Preliminary interviews were carried out {{in order to identify}} if the most important factors collected through the literature should be considered suitable for further inclusion in the final questionnaire. The questionnaires were not used to collect data or to quantify the subjective factors. They were used to assess {{the degree to which the}} factors previously identified were important determinants of the audit fee, and whether other determinants should also be considered. The data for the statistical analysis was obtained from published data i. e., Data Stream, Companies' Annual Reports, and Who Owns Whom. In carrying out the statistical analysis, Multiple Regression arid Principal Component Techniques were used to assess the magnitude of the association between the size and complexity factors and audit fees. An audit fee regression model was developed which explains 90 Y. of the <b>variation</b> in audit <b>fees</b> of the largest 65 manufacturing companies in the U.

The results of both the empirical study, and the statistical analysis revealed that the company size (in terms of debtors, stocks work in progress, turnover, creditors, and total employment costs), and its complexity (in terms of number of subsidiaries, and number of countries in which the company operates) are the major objective determinants of audit fees. The empirical study also revealed that the quality of the company's internal control system, competition in the audit market, and the risk involved in the audit work are the major subjective determinants of audit fees.

However, few empirical papers consider the role of the seller in shaping the demand for auctions, a point we seek to redress.

40|$|When the UK Government {{introduced}} a fee level {{at the point}} of entry for Home students on undergraduate programmes, the debate was focused upon widening participation into higher education. That debate was to be settled empirically but the aspect of the intervention tending to be overlooked was the effect on access to postgraduate study for those shouldering greater debt and unable to pay it off at this stage. There has been for a long time a semi-market in postgraduate programme fees. Research council funded research students are a small minority. Most find other means of support and many choose the part-time study option. Fees for part-time study have for a long time varied across the sector, where less popular institutions' subject areas see the need to loss-lead to ensure a critical mass of research-active individuals. Since the mid- 1990 s, the research councils have shifted resources relatively into research degree programmes and away from taught masters programmes, making it harder to study at higher degree level in subjects less "job-marketable", and making more room for fee levels above economic cost for more job-marketable programmes. And all this is without considering the International postgraduate student dimension, concerning which there has been more <b>variation</b> in <b>fee</b> levels, tending towards an implicit "cash cow" policy to hold up the postgraduate infrastructure of institutions. Overall, the situation within the postgraduate domain is and has been highly complex, but the increasing market trend, strengthened by the non-market action of the research councils, sees higher fee levels and higher proportions of International postgraduates and others who can find the financial means, concentrated in Russell Group institutions rather than elsewhere.

"May 2012 "Despite the overabundance of data collected and analyzed about tuition as a primary cost of public higher education, little to no {{attention has been paid to}} fees as a portion of that cost. Most of the existing research combines tuition and required fees into one entity, rarely separating fees from tuition, and disregarding non-required fees altogether. Framed by the theories of academic capitalism, resource dependency, and neoliberalism (Slaughter & Rhoades, 2004), this descriptive analysis examines the use of required and non-required fees as part of the overall price of public higher education institutions, differentiating at both the in-state and out-of-state, and the undergraduate and graduate levels. Further, internal and external institutional factors are compared with the use of fees as a revenue generating strategy to see if differences exist among certain public institutions. Findings suggest that there are differences among fee structures as institutions that are more research intensive tend to charge higher fees than non-research intensive, indicating that research institutions may be using fees as a way to increase revenue, enhance perceived quality, and remain competitive in the marketplace. Results also indicate that the external variables of region, state, governance structure, political culture, and regulation contribute to <b>variations</b> in <b>fee</b> structures exhibiting that fees are not as simple in their creation as one might think. The results could prove valuable in the arenas of finance and policy creation for public higher education institutions by allowing policy to be created that will change the current fee environment from a hidden procedure to a more evident process...|$|R
