30|$|For the {{negative}} binomial example, {{we see that}} the sCMP class of distributions again performs well in estimating the form of the simulated dataset. The true parameter values associated with {{the negative}} binomial model imply that μ =n(1 -p)/p = 6 and θ= 3. The negative binomial distribution(θ̂= 3.5599, μ̂= 5.3001) is the best model among the distributions considered (AIC = 521.4971), however, the sCMP class of distributions performs more optimally as m increases (among those <b>values</b> <b>for</b> <b>m</b> considered). Larger <b>values</b> <b>for</b> <b>m</b> were not considered here because the sCMP models for m= 3, 4 produce approximately equal log-likelihood values, thus likewise producing comparable AIC and BIC values; this makes sense because the negative binomial estimate is 3 < θ̂= 3.5599 < 4. Meanwhile, even for the sCMP models where m= 1, 2, the difference in AIC when compared with the best model still implies that these models show considerable support.|$|R

40|$|As {{part of its}} {{monetary}} policy strategy, the European Central Bank has formulated a reference <b>value</b> <b>for</b> <b>M</b> 3 growth. A pre-requisite {{for the use of}} a reference <b>value</b> <b>for</b> <b>M</b> 3 growth is the existence of a stable demand function for that aggregate. However, a large empirical literature has emerged showing that, beginning in 2001, essentially all euro area M 3 demand functions have exhibited instability. This paper argues that a proper understanding of the determination of money requires a portfolio analysis where the demand for broad money is seen as just one element in the wealth portfolio. Under this framework, wealth is the variable that constitutes the total budget constraint on the holdings of assets, including money, and changes in equity prices are a key transmission channel of {{monetary policy}}. Understanding money behaviour thus requires good data on euro area wealth which at present do not exist. Our basic premise {{is that there is a}} stable demand-for-money function but that the models that have been used until now to estimate euro area money-demand are not well-specified because they do not include a measure of wealth. Using two empirical methodologies - - a co-integrated vector equilibrium correction (VEC) approach and a time-varying coefficient (TVC) approach - - we find that a demand-for-money function that includes wealth is stable. The upshot of our findings is that M 3 behaviour continues to provide useful information about medium-term developments on inflation.
