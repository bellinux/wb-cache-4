2500|$|The LFA's {{engineers}} {{selected a}} V10 engine over an equivalent displacement V8 engine {{for its ability}} to rev higher, and over a V12 for its lower reciprocating mass, allowing for more rapid engine response. Lexus claims their engine can rev from idle to its redline in 0.6seconds and an analog tachometer needle could not accurately track the LFA's changes in engine speeds. This necessitated the use of a digital tachometer which can instantly display engine speed. The engine reportedly weighs less than the manufacturer's own 3.5-liter 2GR-FE V6 engine. Engineers attempted to make the engine sound like that of a Formula One car with high revs, {{while at the same time}} maintaining reliability and <b>vibration</b> <b>control.</b> Along with other manufacturers such as Ferrari, Toyota had produced their own F1 engines and chassis designs.

With the increase of bridge span length and the tendency of the bridge cross-section being more slender and streamlined, multi-mode coupled vibrations {{as well as their}} controls have become very important for large bridges susceptible to strong winds. As a simple but effective device, the TMD system especially the semi-active one has become a promising option for such coupled <b>vibration</b> <b>controls.</b> However, despite various studies of optimal <b>controls</b> of single-mode-based <b>vibrations</b> with TMDs, research on the corresponding controls of the multi-mode coupled vibrations is very rare so far.
