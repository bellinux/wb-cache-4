40|$|Numerical {{study on}} <b>vibration</b> <b>stress</b> of {{rotating}} fan blade under aerodynamic load at critical speed Hai-jun Kou, Jian-sheng Lin and Jun-hong Zhang The <b>vibration</b> <b>stress</b> caused by resonance {{is the main}} cause of failure in aircraft engine blades. The study investigated the <b>vibration</b> <b>stress</b> of a single-stage fan blade influenced by the interaction of aerodynamic and structural behavior at multiple critical speeds. A numerically based analysis through the interfacing of computational fluid dynamics and finite element modeling analysis, referred to as fluid–structure interaction was performed. A three-dimensional finite element model of the blade which was verified by modal test was established to carry out response analysis when blade resonates. A single flow channel model of the blade was constructed to simulate the aerodynamic pressure loads that result in vibration of the fan blades. The Campbell diagram was introduced to determine the critical conditions of the blade. The results show that resonance phenomenon appears for several times between 2000 and 3600 r/min, and further analyses of the blade mode shape as well as dynamic stress at these speeds indicate that <b>vibration</b> <b>stress</b> at critical speed is obviously higher than those at the adjacent speeds. But there is no positive correlation between the peak stress and critical speed, while it is determined by the comprehensive action of critical speed, vibration mode and synchronous excitation. The peak stress distribution is closely linked to the mode shape of the blade, and it always appears at the leading edge and changes along the blade height. It also illustrates that {{the leading edge of the}} blade is most prone to vibration fatigue...|$|E

The robot must be resistant {{to a variety of}} impacts, aimed at its destruction, for example any emergency situation or inadvertent influence of the person.

One way to check robot to withstand <b>vibration</b> <b>stresses</b> - testing on a vibration table. However, breakage during vibration testing requires considerable time and financial expenses for redesign the robot, restoration of damaged parts and re-testing.

This report highlight the work of the vibration simulation of space manipulation system, show the results of calculations, schedules and distribution charts of surface stresses. Vibrational modeling is an important condition for creating high-quality products and can save considerable resources in development and manufacturing of systems for space purposes. Development of methods for evaluation of vibration disturbances on products designed to operate in space is of great interest for the creators of such technology. ???? ?? ????????? ??????????? ?????????? ?????? ? ???????????? ?????????. ????? ?????? ???? ???????? ? ????????? ????????????, ???????????? ?? ??? ??????????, ???????? ????????????? ????? ????????? ???????? ??? ????????????????? ??????????? ????????. ? ?????? ? ???????????? ?????????????????? ????????? ??? ?? ?????????? ?????????? ???????????? ? ????????? ???????????? ?????????, ??????????? ??? ?????? ? ???????. ????? ?? ???????? ?????????? ??????????? ?????? ????????????? ???????????? ????????? ???????? ?????????? ????????? ?? ???????????. ?????? ? ?????? ??????? ?? ????? ???????????? ????????? ????????? ???????????? ????????? ? ?????????? ??????? ?? ????????? ??????????? ??????, ?????????????? ???????????? ??????? ? ????????? ?????????? ?????????. ???????? ????? ????? ??? ?????????? ????????????? ????????????? ? ???????? ??????????????? ??????. ????????????? ???????? ???????? ???????? ? ???????????? ?????? ?????? ? ????????? ????????????? ???????????? ?????? ????????? ? ???????????. ? ?????? ??????????? ?????? ?? ????????????? ????????????? ??????????????? ??????? ???????????? ??????????, ?? ??????? ??????? ???????? ?????????? ????????, ??????? ? ????? ????????????? ????????????? ??????????...|$|R

40|$|To date, {{the failure}} {{potential}} and prediction between simultaneous multi-axial versus sequentially applied uniaxial <b>vibration</b> <b>stress</b> screen testing {{has been the}} subject of great debate. In most applications, current vibration tests are done by sequentially applying uniaxial excitation to the test specimen along three orthogonal axes. The most common standards for testing military equipment are published in MIL-STD- 810 F and NAVMAT P- 9492. Previous research had shown that uniaxial testing may be unrealistic and inadequate. This current research effort is a continuing effort to systematically investigate the differences between fatigue damage mechanisms and the effects of uniaxial versus tri-axial testing. This includes assessing the ability of the tri-axial method in predicting the formation of damage mechanisms, specifically looking at the effects of stress or fatigue failure. Multi-axial testing achieves the synergistic effect of exciting all modes simultaneously and induces a more realistic <b>vibration</b> <b>stress</b> loading condition.
