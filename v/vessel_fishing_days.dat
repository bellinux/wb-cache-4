25|$|The {{fisheries}} in the Northeast Region are governed mostly by Fishery Management Plans (FMPs). An example of successful regulation is the 1994 Amendment 4 to the Sea Scallop FMP.

Data were collected from trawler and longliner fleets targeting hake off the Spanish ports of La Coruña, Burela, and Celeiro. Main factors in the models created include a factor for engine Horse Power, to adjust for characteris-tics that determine fishing power; Year and Month factors for La Coruña’s trawler fleet; and the factors Month, Year, <b>Vessel,</b> and <b>Fishing</b> <b>Days</b> for the Spanish longliner fleet as a whole. Moreover, both models indicate that interactions between the Year and Month factors also {{had a significant impact}} on hake catch rates. The total proportions of variance explained by these models were 55 % for La Coruña’s trawler fleet, and about 48 % for Spanish longliner fleet. The results showed sim-ilar patterns comparing nominal and standardized catch rates...|$|R
