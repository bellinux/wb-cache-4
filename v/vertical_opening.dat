25|$|The <b>vertical</b> <b>opening</b> of a {{trawl net}} is created using {{flotation}} {{on the upper}} edge ("floatline") and weight on the lower edge ("footrope") of the net mouth. The configuration of the footrope varies based on the expected bottom shape. The more uneven the bottom, the more robust the footrope configuration must be to prevent net damage. This is used to catch shrimp, shellfish, cod, scallops and many others. Trawls are funnel-shaped nets that have a closed-off tail where the fish are collected and is open on the top end as the mouth.|$|E
25|$|The {{ceremonial}} huipil of Zinacantán, Chiapas is also {{distinguished by}} its manufacture and symbolism. It {{is made of}} white cotton with a square neckline or with a <b>vertical</b> <b>opening</b> with a button fastener. The chest area is marked off with a red line inside of which are white chicken feathers delicately fastened with white, blue or green thread. The lower border has fringe made of the same materials and colors. It is the only garment in Mexico which uses the pre Hispanic art of featherwork today. This huipil is often used for weddings as {{it is believed that}} it ensures a good marriage. Other white wedding huipils are found in Pinotepa Nacional, Chopan and Cotzocón in Oaxaca. In Pinotepa Nacional, decorative elements include animals, flowers, human figures, fretwork, moons, suns, fish and insects.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the west}} end, two options for {{crossing}} {{the river and}} canal were developed. [...] One involving a high level <b>vertical</b> <b>opening</b> bridge which will allow the majority of canal traffic to pass under {{without the need for}} opening. [...] The other involved a bridge over the river and an aqueduct under the canal. [...] Both of these designs are technically complex and were considered in detail along by the key stakeholders involved in the project. Ultimately it was decided that a bridge over the river and a tunnel under the canal were the best option, allow more expensive.|$|E

40|$|The {{buoyancy}} induced turbulent {{flows in}} ventilated enclosure with internal heat source has important applications in building ventilations, solar energy receivers, thermal management of electronic devices and enclosure fire dynamics. In naturally ventilated buildings, the fluid flow is mainly driven by buoyancy and air exchange through ventilation openings provides thermal comfort for building occupants. During fire accidents in buildings and in long tunnels, larger temperature difference induces strong buoyant plumes {{and the hot}} gas flow characteristics are important {{for the design of}} fire safety and ventilation systems. The air flow patterns through <b>vertical</b> <b>openings</b> such as doorways and windows are widely studied but very few investigations are performed with horizontal or ceiling openings. The horizontal vents are openings in ceilings, floors or smoke vent at roof top. The flow patterns through horizontal openings are highly unstable in comparison with <b>vertical</b> <b>openings.</b> Previous investigations through horizontal openings have not considered the effects of heat source strength, vent aspect ratio, wind speed, wind direction, heat source and vent locations...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} a double-skin porous façade system on the wind-induced {{response}} of the Commonwealth Advisory Aeronautical Research Council (CAARC) Standard Tall Building were investigated via a program of wind tunnel model study conducted at the China Light and Power (CLP) Power Wind/Wave Tunnel Facility at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. For reduced wind velocities ranging from about 4 to 14, the dynamic alongwind, crosswind and torsional responses of the building were reduced significantly when <b>vertical</b> <b>openings</b> {{were introduced to the}} outer skin of the double-skin façade. The reduction in crosswind response at around the critical reduced velocity associated with vortex shedding when the incident wind was normal to the windward face of the building is particularly striking. These response reductions are attributable to the disruption to the vortex shedding process caused by channelling air flow created by <b>vertical</b> <b>opening(s)</b> and the double-skin façade system. Innovative façade systems such as these can be adopted in tall building design to utilise their wind-induced response reducing aerodynamic characteristics...|$|R

50|$|Several {{methods were}} used in {{traditional}} architecture to alleviate the harsh climate of the country. Windows were seldom used {{in order to reduce}} heat conduction. The badgheer construction method allowed air to be channeled into houses for ventilation purposes.

50|$|The first {{tumbler lock}} {{was found in}} the ruins of the Palace of Khorsabad in Iraq. Basic {{principles}} of the pin tumbler lock may date as far back as 4000 BC in Egypt; the lock consisted of a wooden post affixed to the door, and a horizontal bolt that slid into the post. The bolt had <b>vertical</b> <b>openings</b> into which a set of pins fitted. These could be lifted, using a key, to a sufficient height to allow the bolt to move and unlock the door. This wooden lock was one of Egypt's major developments in domestic architecture during classical times.|$|R
5|$|Arrowslits, also {{commonly}} called loopholes, were narrow <b>vertical</b> <b>openings</b> in defensive walls which allowed arrows or crossbow bolts {{to be fired}} on attackers. The narrow slits were intended to protect the defender by providing a very small target, but {{the size of the}} opening could also impede the defender if it was too small. A smaller horizontal opening could be added to give an archer a better view for aiming. Sometimes a sally port was included; this could allow the garrison to leave the castle and engage besieging forces. It was usual for the latrines to empty down the external walls of a castle and into the surrounding ditch.|$|R

40|$|Air pumping {{effect of}} a fire plume to give higher intake rate through <b>vertical</b> <b>openings</b> in a post-flashover room fire will be {{discussed}} in this paper. The thermal balance equation was set up with known fire phenomena in a room. The hydrostatic model was applied to study the air intake rate through <b>vertical</b> <b>openings.</b> An equation relating heat release rate to room air temperature rise with empirical constants was then justified by reported experimental data on post-flashover room fire. The heat release rate was measured by the oxygen consumption method in that experiment. The predicted heat release rate from the empirical equation reported in the literature was observed to be proportional to the room air temperature rise as derived from hydrostatics. However, the proportionality constant is lower than the experimental value. A possible explanation is due to neglecting another fire phenomenon on air pumping action of the fire plume in a real room fire. Higher pressure differences across the door would give higher airflow rates across an opening. This would supply more air to give higher heat release rate as observed in the experiment. In this paper, the pressure due to air pumping of the fire plume is taken as a proportion of the hydrostatic pressure due to temperature differences between the upper hot layer and lower cool layer. Comparing the measured heat release rate with the estimated heat release rate due only to hydrostatics will give the air pumping action. The possible increase in heat release rate in a post-flashover fire can then be estimated accordingly. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R
