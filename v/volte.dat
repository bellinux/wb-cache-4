500|$|Leaving Castlereagh to {{negotiate}} on Tsar Alexander's behalf, Metternich briefly {{turned his attention}} to quelling anti-Habsburg feeling in Italy. Around the same time, [...] he learnt that the Duchess of Sagan was courting the Tsar. Disappointed, and exhausted by social rounds, Metternich let his guard drop, angering Tsar Alexander during negotiations over Poland (then ruled by Napoleon as the Grand Duchy of Warsaw) by implying Austria could match Russia militarily. The pair would never meet in person again. Despite the blunder, Francis refused to dismiss his foreign minister, and political crisis rocked Vienna throughout November, culminating in a declaration by Tsar Alexander that Russia would not compromise in its claim on Poland as a satellite kingdom. The Coalition rejected this utterly, and agreement seemed further off than ever. During the stand-off, it seems that Alexander even went as far as to challenge Metternich to a duel. Fortunately for Metternich, Tsar Alexander soon did a rapid <b>volte</b> face and agreed to the division of Poland. He also softened in regard to the Germanic Kingdom of Saxony, {{and for the first time}} allowed Talleyrand to participate in all Big Four (now Big Five) discussions.|$|E

500|$|Both iPhone 6 models {{received}} generally positive reviews. Re/code {{called it}} [...] "the best smartphone you can buy". TechRadar praised the iPhone 6's [...] "brilliant" [...] design, improved battery life over the 5s, iOS 8 for being [...] "smarter and more intuitive than ever", {{along with the}} quality of its camera. However, the plastic antenna strips on the rear of the phone were criticized for resulting in poor aesthetics, the display for having lower resolution and pixel density in comparison to other recent smartphones – including those with the same physical screen size as the iPhone 6, such as the HTC One, and for not having a sufficient justification for its significantly higher price in comparison to similar devices running Android or Windows Phone. The Verge considered the iPhone 6 to be [...] "simply and cleanly designed" [...] in comparison to the 5s, noting that the phone still felt usable despite its larger size, but criticized the antenna plastic, the protruding camera lens (which prevents the device from sitting flat without a case), and the lack of additional optimization in the operating system for the bigger screen. Improvements such as performance, battery life, <b>VoLTE</b> support, and other tweaks were also noted. In conclusion, the iPhone 6 was considered [...] "good, even great, but there’s little about it that’s truly ambitious or truly moving the needle. It’s just a refinement of a lot of existing ideas into a much more pleasant package".|$|E
