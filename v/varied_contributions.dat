Little research has addressed this contribution young people make to health care work from their perspectives. This study explored the accounts of bilingual young people from four linguistic groups in London, including those from established minority groups and those more recently arrived. Young people reported extensive experience of interpreting in a number of settings, and identified a range of benefits to themselves and their families arising from their contributions, as well as some problems faced in achieving successful encounters. Focusing on young people's own accounts enabled their work to be conceptualised not as merely 'inappropriate and inadequate interpreting' but as a <b>varied</b> <b>contribution</b> to the informal economy of health care that ranged from simple translation to complex mediation between families, the wider community and the health care system.

40|$|International audienceTombel graben and Mounts Bambouto are two {{volcanic}} {{fields of}} the typical system of alternating graben and horst structure of the Cameroon Volcanic Line. Tombel graben is a young volcanic field, whereas Mounts Bambouto horst is an old stratovolcano with calderas. Volcanic products in both settings have a signature close to that of Ocean Island Basalt implying a major role of FOZO (focal zone) component and <b>varied</b> <b>contribution</b> of depleted mantle (DMM) and enriched mantle (EM) components. The Cameroon Volcanic Line is a hot line essentially resulting from passive rifting. Eocene to Recent intraplate basaltic volcanism {{in the study area}} was probably a result of mantle upwelling coupled with lithospheric extension. The olivine basaltic magma of horst volcanoes evolved in a large-scale, steady-state magmatic reservoir via crystal fractionation and limited contamination to highly differentiated alkaline lavas (trachyte and phonolite). Conversely, rapid ascent of lavas along multiple fault lines of graben structures produced less evolved lavas (hawaiite) within small reservoirs. This model, evaluated for the study area, involves mantle upwelling inside zones of weakness in the lithosphere after intra-continental extension. It can be applied {{to other parts of the}} Cameroon Volcanic Line as well, and is similar to that described in other intra-continental rift-related areas in Africa...|$|R
40|$|This is an Accepted Manuscript of {{an article}} {{published}} by Taylor & Francis in Construction Management and Economics on 14 th January 2016, available online: [URL] is commonly understood to be a distinct, even defining, aspect of being human – an attribute related to our efficacies to come to know and influence the, mostly nonhuman, world around us. In construction, expertise is commonly defined as the acquisition of skill and knowledge related to new technical processes, organizational routines, health and safety codes, even cultural norms. Despite the development of rule-following ‘expert systems’ in construction and beyond, the proposal that nonhuman technologies and artefacts can share our expertise is thus to be regarded with doubt: humans are human because of their lived expertise to undertake tasks faster and better than machines and other nonhumans. Increasingly, however, this anthropocentric view of expertise can be challenged by a ‘posthuman turn’ that is gathering pace across {{the social sciences and}} humanities. In this paper I evaluate, via the work of four seminal posthuman thinkers, the distinct, and <b>varied,</b> <b>contribution</b> that posthumanism might make to how we understand notions of construction expertise. In so doing I draw upon fictional examples of construction practices to illustrate the challenge and theoretical and practical opportunities in rethinking construction expertise via posthumanism...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{investigation of}} the solution structure of two Yb(III) complexes of C- 4 symmetric chiral tetraamide ligands based on cyclen is performed in different solvents with the combined use of H- 1 NMR, NLR-CD, and luminescence techniques. Pseudocontact chemical shifts and NOE measurements allow one to assess the relative positions of the ring and the side chains; NIR-CD,spectra provide {{a description of the}} local stereochemistry around the metal ion; and finally, the axial exchange dynamics can be quantitatively characterized by means of the luminescence emission data. The two complexes can be described-by a Lambda(delta delta delta delta) (i. e., square antiprismatic) coordination polyhedra, capped by a ninth axial solvent molecule. On changing the solvent composition (water,: methanol, acetonitrile,dimethylsulfoxide), equilibria involving the ring or the sidearms are not detected, and the macrocycle conformation stays the same: the relevant changes in the observed spectra can thus be related to different axial coordinations. The susceptibility anisotropy factor D in the H- 1 NMR spectra becomes progressively smaller as the strength of the axial ligand increases; correspondingly, the different crystal field caused by the <b>varied</b> <b>contribution</b> of this further ligand shapes differently the CD and the emission patterns of the central cation. The present study is the first attempt to rationalize a correspondence between the magnetic and optical parameters used in the description of the behavior of lanthanide ions in solution...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{estimate}} the inputs of nitrogen (N) and exports of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) from the Changjiang River to the estuary {{for the period}} 1970 - 2003, by using the global NEWS-DIN model. Modeled DIN yields range from 260 kg N km(- 2) yr(- 1) in 1970 to 895 kg N km(- 2) yr(- 1) in 2003, with an increasing trend. The study demonstrated a <b>varied</b> <b>contribution</b> of different N inputs to river DIN yields during the period 1970 - 2003. Chemical fertilizer and manure together contributed {{about half of the}} river DIN yields, while atmospheric N deposition contributed an average of 21 % of DIN yields in the period 1970 - 2003. Biological N fixation contributed 40 % of DIN yields in 1970, but substantially decreased to 13 % in 2003. Point sewage N input also showed a decreasing trend in contribution to DIN yields, with an average of 8 % over the whole period. We also discuss possible future trajectories of DIN export based on the Global NEWS implementation of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment scenarios. Our result indicates that anthropogenically enhanced N inputs dominate and will continue to dominate river DIN yields under changing human pressures in the basin. Therefore, nitrogen pollution is {{and will continue to be}} a great challenge to China...|$|R
40|$|Lanthanum (La) bearing {{materials}} {{have been widely}} used to remove phosphorus (P) in water treatment. However, it remains a challenge to enhance phosphate (PO 4) adsorption capacity and La usage efficiency. In this study, La was co-precipitated with aluminum (Al) to obtain a La/Al-hydroxide composite (LAH) for P adsorption. The maximum PO 4 adsorption capacities of LAH (5. 3 % La) were 76. 3 and 45. 3 mg P g- 1 at pH 4. 0 and 8. 5, which were 8. 5 and 5. 3 times higher than those of commercially available La-modified bentonite (Phoslock®, 5. 6 % La), respectively. P K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure analysis showed that PO 4 was preferentially bonded with Al under weakly acid conditions (pH 4. 0), while tended to associate with La under alkaline conditions (pH 8. 5). La LIII-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure analysis indicated that PO 4 was bonded on La sites by forming inner sphere bidentate-binuclear complexes and oxygen defects exhibited on LAH surfaces, which could be active adsorption sites for PO 4. The electrostatic interaction, ligand exchange and oxygen defects on LAH surfaces jointly facilitated PO 4 adsorption but with <b>varied</b> <b>contribution</b> under different pH conditions. The combined contribution of two-component of La and Al may be an important direction {{for the next generation of}} commercial products for eutrophication mitigation...|$|R
