25|$|By simply {{observing the}} stem of one H. physophora individual, we see the complex {{interactions}} between four different species: an ant, a plant, a fungus, and an assassin bug, {{as well as all}} of the prey that lands on the plant. The plant gives a little of its own resources to the predators, but it gets two forms of defense against herbivores and parasitic plants. To the plant, this defense is worth much more than the loss of some food. The plant has maximized its own fitness by establishing two separate and independent relationships that are not very costly but <b>very</b> <b>rewarding.</b> The insects both benefit as well, given a safe habitat and a steady food supply of other insects that land on the prey. In the perspective of A. decemarticulatus, they do not actively give any of their own resources to the plant or to the assassin bug. They simply live among them, use their resources, and hunt.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to {{the changes in the}} game's engine, the developers decided to improve the artificial intelligence to give each enemy a distinct behavior.

It's great when a game requires both thinking and quick reactions". Originally, the developers planned to add weather effects that would disorient the player's ship during gameplay, but this feature was ultimately not implemented due to time and technology constraints. Multiplayer games were heavily tested to ensure their network stability and support IPX, TCP, and DirectPlay. The actual development of the game took 31 months to complete, with the developers describing it as both a joyful and painful process due to in part of the almost nonexistent management and the rapidly evolving technology at the time.|$|E

The covers consist most part of pop songs in which the band transformed into a more symphonic oriented form.

So not going the easy way by using only a piano or an acoustic guitar for example, but really trying to put {{all the elements of}} a Within Temptation track in this new version. It was quite a challenge because we had only one week to get it right, while recording an original Within Temptation song can sometimes takes up half a year! But this pressure also gave us an creative boost and it was <b>very</b> <b>rewarding</b> to get it done in time each week. Also, we learned a lot from the in-depth analysis we needed to make on these hits, written by others, in combination with implementing our own sound and style in each new cover. We are glad that we’ve taken up this challenge and are very proud of the result." [...] They covered artists such as Imagine Dragons, OneRepublic, Lana del Rey, The Who among others.

However, psychological research suggests that excessive rewards can in some cases result in a decline in performance. To test whether <b>very</b> high monetary <b>rewards</b> can decrease performance, we conducted a set of experiments in the US and India in which subjects worked on different tasks and received performance-contingent payments that varied in amount from small to very large relative to their typical levels of pay.

40|$|Exploration {{in complex}} domains {{is a key}} {{challenge}} in reinforcement learning, especially for tasks with <b>very</b> sparse <b>rewards.</b> Recent successes in deep reinforcement learning have been achieved mostly using simple heuristic exploration strategies such as ϵ-greedy action selection or Gaussian control noise, {{but there are many}} tasks where these methods are insufficient to make any learning progress. Here, we consider more complex heuristics: efficient and scalable exploration strategies that maximize a notion of an agent's surprise about its experiences via intrinsic motivation. We propose to learn a model of the MDP transition probabilities concurrently with the policy, and to form intrinsic rewards that approximate the KL-divergence of the true transition probabilities from the learned model. One of our approximations results in using surprisal as intrinsic motivation, while the other gives the k-step learning progress. We show that our incentives enable agents to succeed {{in a wide range of}} environments with high-dimensional state spaces and <b>very</b> sparse <b>rewards,</b> including continuous control tasks and games in the Atari RAM domain, outperforming several other heuristic exploration techniques.
