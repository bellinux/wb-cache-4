40|$|Today, {{two types}} of DC power supply <b>can</b> <b>be</b> found in the market, Switch-Mode Power Supply (SMPS) and linear power supply. However, many {{customers}} prefer to choose SMPS than linear power supply because for same power rating, SMPS is smaller, cheaper and lighter than linear power supply especially transformer. The high frequency switching transformer that is used in SMPS is smaller and lighter than the transformer that is used in linear power supply. SMPS also have better efficiency than linear power supply. This project is focusing on developing SMPS using flyback converter topology.

Most of electrical energy consumed in industrial facilities is received from electrical generators. Therefore {{it is necessary to}} perform research in order to develop advanced electric generators with less cost and high efficiency. There has been a recent interest in flux switching generators (FSG) in which all the flux sources are positioned in the stator that make the rotor simple, robust and brushless. Hence, this project presents an operating principle of a new proposed outer-rotor hybrid excitation flux switching generator. In this Generator a combination of a permanent magnet (PM) and field excitation coil (FEC) are used as the main flux sources.

Latest developments in high etched or sintered anodes increases the capacitance value, depending on the rated voltage, by a factor of up to 200 for Al-e-caps or Ta-e-caps compared with smooth anodes.

25|$|Input current: Due to biasing {{requirements}} or leakage, a {{small amount}} of current (typically ~10 nanoamperes for bipolar op-amps, tens of picoamperes (pA) for JFET input stages, and only a few pA for MOSFET input stages) flows into the inputs. When large resistors or sources with high output impedances are used in the circuit, these small currents can produce large unmodeled voltage drops. If the input currents are matched, and the impedance looking out of both inputs are matched, then the voltages produced at each input will be equal. Because the operational amplifier operates on the difference between its inputs, these matched voltages will have no effect. It is more common for the input currents to be slightly mismatched. The difference is called input offset current, and even with matched resistances a small offset voltage (different from the input offset <b>voltage</b> below) <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>produced.</b> This offset <b>voltage</b> <b>can</b> create offsets or drifting in the operational amplifier.|$|R

However, the energy increase obtained is accompanied by an intensity decrease due to the low efficiency of the charge breeding process itself.

The microbial electrolysis cell is a two electrode system in which at the anode organic substances, including waste water, are used by microorganisms that release the terminal electrons to the electrode. These electrons are subsequently used at the cathode resulting {{in the production of}} a current. By addition of a small <b>voltage,</b> hydrogen gas <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>produced</b> by combining electrons and protons at the cathode.

In this study we focused on the characterization of the microbial communities of the microbial electrolysis cell biocathode using molecular techniques. The results show that the microbial community consists of 44 % Proteobacteria, 27 % Firmicutes, 18 % Bacteriodetes and 12 % related to other phyla.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} theory and the conducted activity {{that lead to the}} construction of a high voltage high frequency arbitrary waveform voltage generator. The generator has been specifically designed to supply power {{to a wide range of}} plasma actuators. The system has been completely designed, manufactured and tested at the Department of Electrical, Electronic and Information Engineering of the University of Bologna. The generator structure is based on the single phase cascaded H-bridge multilevel topology and is comprised of 24 elementary units that are series connected in order to form the typical staircase output voltage waveform of a multilevel converter. The total number of <b>voltage</b> levels that <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>produced</b> by the generator is 49. Each level is 600 V making the output peak-to-peak voltage equal to 28. 8 kV. The large number of levels provides high resolution with respect to the output voltage having thus the possibility to generate arbitrary waveforms. Maximum frequency of operation is 20 kHz. A study of the relevant literature shows that this is the first time that a cascaded multilevel converter of such dimensions has been constructed. Isolation and control challenges had to be solved for the realization of the system. The biggest problem of the current technology in power supplies for plasma actuators is load matching. Resonant converters are the most used power supplies and are seriously affected by this problem. The manufactured generator completely solves this issue providing consistent voltage output independently of the connected load. This fact is very important when executing tests and during the comparison of the results because all measures should be comparable and not dependent from matching issues. The use of the multilevel converter for power supplying a plasma actuator is a real technological breakthrough that has provided and will continue to provide very significant experimental results...|$|R
40|$|Piezoelectric {{materials}} convert {{mechanical energy}} into electrical energy and electrical energy into mechanical energy. They generate electrical charges {{in response to}} mechanical stress and generate mechanical displacement and/or force when subjected to an electric current. Scientists at Langley Research Center have developed a piezoelectric device that is superior in many ways to those {{that used to be}} the only ones commercially available. It is tougher, has far greater displacement and greater mechanical load capacity for a comparative <b>voltage</b> operation, <b>can</b> <b>be</b> easily <b>produced</b> at a relatively low cost, and lends itself well to mass production. The NASA-developed piezoelectric device is also unique in that it is more efficient in extracting electrical energy from the mechanical energy that goes in. It works on a simple principle. A thin ceramic piezoelectric wafer is sandwiched between an aluminum sheet and a steel sheet and held together with LaRC-SI, an amorphous thermoplastic adhesive with special properties created by NASA at Langley. The sandwich is heated in an autoclave, and the adhesive melts. When the sandwich cools, the adhesive bonds the parts together into one piezoelectric element. While they cool, the components of the element contract at different rates, since they are made of different materials. This differential shrinkage causes the element to warp in either a convex or concave shape, depending on which way it is oriented. The shrinking of the outside metal layers places the inside piezoelectric ceramic under mechanical stress. If the element is cantilevered by clamping one side and then plucked, it reverberates like a diving board that has just ejected a diver. This way, a small amount of mechanical energy can result in a relatively long period of electrical generation. When the piezoelectric element is used for the creation of electricity, it is called Lightning. This same sandwiched piezoelectric wafer can also convert electrical energy into mechanical energy. Then, it is called Thunder. Electricity goes in, excites the element, and then, mechanical energy in the form of movement is generated...|$|R
40|$|Cardiac {{mechanical}} alternans {{are believed}} to be associated with intracellular Ca 2 + alternans. However, the mechanisms underlying the genesis of intracellular Ca 2 + alternans are unclear. Experimental studies have shown that alternans of systolic Ca 2 + under <b>voltage</b> clamp <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>produced</b> either by partially inhibiting the Ca 2 + release mechanism or by applying small depolarising pulses. In each case the alternans relied on the appearance of propagating waves of Ca 2 + release. The aim of the work in this thesis is to develop a theoretical model to understand the mechanisms underlying how the beat-to-beat alternation in the amplitude of the systolic Ca 2 + transient <b>is</b> <b>produced.</b> A mathematical model of intracellular Ca 2 + handling for a ventricular cardiac cell was developed as a spatially extended object, which is discretized by a group of coupled elements. Each element contains L-type and T-type Ca 2 + channels, a subspace into which Ca 2 + release takes place, a cytoplasmic space and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) release channels (RyR) and uptake sites (SERCA). Inter-element coupling is via Ca 2 + diffusion between neighbouring subspaces and cytoplasm spaces. Small depolarising pulses were simulated by a sequence of step changes of cell membrane potential (20 mV) with random block on the L-type channels. Partial inhibition of the release mechanism is mimicked by applying a random reduction of the open probability of the RyR in response to a full stimulation by L type Ca 2 + channels. In both cases the simulations are consistent with experimental observations and show that Ca 2 + alternans <b>can</b> <b>be</b> generated and sustained through alternation of SR Ca 2 + content produced by the propagating wave of Ca 2 + release. However, the presented model has certain limitations. In the model, the property of L-type Ca 2 + channel is described as an average effect of global current in a cardiac cell, rather than the total current of a large population of unitary L-type Ca 2 + current, which is directly associated with the testing potential and which is {{a very important part of}} Ca 2 + induced Ca 2 + release (CICR). To conquer the limitation, an improved version of the Ca 2 + handling model was developed by incorporating stochastic unitary L-type Ca 2 + channels into the previous model. The improved model has a more biophysically detailed Ca 2 + handling model, which can not only simulate proper unitary L-type Ca 2 + influx but also produce a good quality of global L-type Ca 2 + current. Like the old model the new stochastic model produced the global and regional alternans of Ca 2 + transients observed in previous experimental studies as well, and agreed the key role of SR Ca 2 + content to genesis of cardiac Ca 2 + alternans. The study in this thesis provided novel insights into understanding the mechanisms underlying the genesis of intracellular Ca 2 + alternans. In addition, the simulation study of effects of volatile anesthesics on rat ventricle has also been included in this thesis, and is presented in Appendix 1.
