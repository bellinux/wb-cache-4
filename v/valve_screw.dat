50|$|When using {{fuel and}} oxygen tanks {{they should be}} {{fastened}} securely upright to a wall or a post or a portable cart. An oxygen tank is especially dangerous {{for the reason that}} the oxygen is at a pressure of 21 MPa (3000 lbf/in² = 200 atmospheres) when full, and if the tank falls over and its valve strikes something and is knocked off, the tank will effectively become an extremely deadly flying missile propelled by the compressed oxygen, capable of even breaking through a brick wall.For this reason, never move an oxygen tank around without its <b>valve</b> cap <b>screwed</b> in place.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} low-permeability {{components of a}} microfluidic drug delivery system fabricated with versatile micromilling and lamination techniques. The fabrication process uses laminate sheets which are machined using XY milling tables commonly used in the printed-circuit industry. This adaptable platform for polymer microfluidics readily accommodates integration with silicon-based sensors, printed-circuit, and surface-mount technologies. We have used these methods to build components used in a wearable liquid-drug delivery system for in vivo studies. The design, fabrication, and performance of membrane-based fluidic capacitors and manual <b>screw</b> <b>valves</b> provide detailed examples of the capability and limitations of the fabrication method. We demonstrate fluidic capacitances ranging from 0. 015 to 0. 15 muL/kPa, <b>screw</b> <b>valves</b> with on/off flow ratios greater than 38000, and a 45 times reduction in the aqueous fluid loss rate to the ambient due to permeation through a silicone diaphragm layer.

50|$|The {{historical}} record is scanty {{but it seems}} that the Steam Horse operated successfully for an unknown period. So much so, that another, larger, one with a 9ft boiler rather than the original 5ft, seems to have been built for the Newbottle Colliery, in County Durham. This locomotive cost £540 and may have had two cylinders. During 1814 and 1815 it hauled loads up a 1 in 36 gradient at 3 mph, but the colliery owners were not happy with it. On 31 July 1815, during a demonstration, the new wrought iron boiler exploded, killing thirteen spectators and injuring several others, due to the safety <b>valves</b> being <b>screwed</b> down too tightly, therefore not working.and the idea was not pursued. This incident was the first recorded railway disaster.|$|R
50|$|The {{acceptance}} of the single-valved bugle took some time. Originally, the American Legion required that <b>valved</b> bugles have <b>screws</b> to allow the valve to be locked onto either the G or D open scale during certain competitions. Some smaller corps had straight bugles even into the 1960s, {{and there are still}} some corps, bands and other groups who continue to use straight bugles or G-D piston bugles to this day, as entire horn lines or as bugle sections.|$|R
5000|$|The ball valve's ease of operation, repair, and {{versatility}} lend it to extensive industrial use, supporting pressures up to 1000 bar {{and temperatures}} up to 752 °F (400 °C), depending on design and materials used. Sizes typically range from 0.2 to 48 inches (0.5 cm to 121 cm). Valve bodies {{are made of}} metal, plastic, or metal with a ceramic; floating balls are often chrome plated for durability. One disadvantage of a ball valve is that they trap water in the center cavity while in the closed position. In {{the event of a}} freeze, the sides can crack due to expansion of ice forming. Some means of insulation or heat tape in this situation will usually prevent damage. Another option for cold climates is the [...] "freeze tolerant ball valve". This style of ball valve incorporates a freeze plug in the side so {{in the event of a}} freeze up, the freeze plug ruptures (acts as a sacrificial disk), thus making for an easy repair. Now instead of replacing the whole <b>valve,</b> just <b>screw</b> in a new freeze plug.|$|R
50|$|Air lock {{problems}} {{often occur}} {{when one is}} trying to recommission a system {{after it has been}} deliberately (for servicing) or accidentally emptied. For example, a central heating system using a circulating pump to pump water through radiators. When filling such a system, air is trapped in the radiators. This air has to be vented using <b>screw</b> <b>valves</b> built into the radiators. Depending on the pipe layout - if there are any upside down 'U's in the circuit - {{it will be necessary to}} vent the highest point(s). If not, air lock may stop flow through that part of the circuit completely. Note that circulating pumps usually do not generate enough pressure to overcome air locks.|$|R
50|$|The air {{pressure}} in an inflated tire holds the inner valve body shut. A small screw and captive nut {{on the top}} of the valve body permits the <b>valve</b> to be <b>screwed</b> shut and ensure that it remains tightly closed. The nut must be unscrewed to permit airflow in either direction. This must be done before attaching a pump. The screw remains captive on the valve body even when unscrewed fully; it is tightened again after the tire is inflated and the pump removed. The valve cap protects the valve body, keeps dirt and mud out of the mechanism, and also prevents the valve from damaging the tube when it is rolled for storage, but is not necessary to prevent pressure loss.|$|R
40|$|A {{control valve}} is {{provided}} which {{is adapted to}} be connected between a pressure source, such as a vacuum pump, and a pressure vessel so as to control the pressure in the vessel. The valve comprises a housing having a longitudinal bore which is connected between the pump and vessel, and a transversely movable valve body which controls the air flow through an air inlet in the housing. The valve body includes cylindrical and conical shaped portions which cooperate with reciprocally shaped portions of the housing to provide flow control. A filter in the air inlet removes foreign matter from the air. The bottom end of the <b>valve</b> body is <b>screwed</b> into the <b>valve</b> housing control knob formed integrally with the valve body and controls translation of the valve body, and the opening and closing of the valve...|$|R
25|$|Yoke valves (sometimes called A-clamps {{from their}} shape) {{are the most}} popular {{regulator}} connection in North America and several other countries. They clamp the high pressure inlet opening of the regulator against the outlet opening of the cylinder valve, and are sealed by an O-ring in a groove in the contact face of the cylinder <b>valve.</b> The user <b>screws</b> the clamp in place finger-tight to hold the metal surfaces of cylinder valve and regulator first stage in contact, compressing the o-ring between the radial faces of valve and regulator. When the valve is opened, gas pressure presses the O-ring against the outer cylindrical surface of the groove, completing the seal. The diver must take care not to screw the yoke down too tightly, or it may prove impossible to remove without tools. Conversely, failing to tighten sufficiently can lead to O-ring extrusion under pressure and a major loss of breathing gas. This can be a serious problem if it happens when the diver is at depth.|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the master’s thesis is to study the influence of phosphate coating structure on the mechanical properties of screw connection.

To investigate {{the effect of the}} structure on the connection sealing, twelve kinds of phosphate coatings varying in one process parameter were prepared. The monitored parameters determining the phosphate structure are – type of phosphate and activation bath, its temperature and concentration and time of immersion.

5000|$|There are {{two main}} types of socket wrenches: impact sockets and hand sockets. Common sockets are colloquially {{referred}} to by {{counting the number of}} [...] "points" [...] (pointed corners of walls) present {{in the shape of the}} socket nut opening. For example, the hexagon shape is commonly called a [...] "6 point" [...] socket because the hexagon forms 6 [...] "points" [...] where walls intersect to create six sharp pointed corners. This system of description using [...] "points" [...] generally works well in avoiding confusion, with the exception of [...] "8-point" [...] and [...] "12-point" [...] where two very incompatible shapes exist with both having 8 [...] "points" [...] and 12 [...] "points". The vast majority of larger common nut and bolt heads are produced with the 6-point hexagonal gripping shape. Less frequently used shapes include the square 4-point, triple square 12-point (not to be confused with 12-point double hexagon), octagonal 8-point (not to be confused with the more common 8-point double square shape). These less common shapes are typically found in special applications or particular industries such as aircraft, PVC plumbing fittings or German and UK made automobiles. With rail cars, <b>valve</b> adjustment <b>screws</b> and pipe plugs the 4-point square shaped driver can still be found in wide use both male and female configurations. Nuts and bolt heads are also produced in 12-point double hexagon shapes and various types of splines more common to aircraft and aerospace applications. Most manufacturers of sockets for larger bolts produce them in 6-point (hexagonal) and limited sizes of 12-point (double-hexagonal) configurations.|$|R

5000|$|Supervisory control {{often takes}} {{one of two}} forms. In one, the {{controlled}} machine or process continues autonomously. It is observed {{from time to time}} by a human who, when deeming it necessary, intervenes to modify the control algorithm in some way. In the other, the process accepts an instruction, carries it out autonomously, reports the results and awaits further commands. With manual control, the operator interacts directly with a controlled process or task using switches, levers, <b>screws,</b> <b>valves</b> etc., to control actuators. This concept was incorporated in the earliest machines which sought to extend the physical capabilities of man. In contrast, with automatic control, the machine adapts to changing circumstances and makes decisions in pursuit of some goal which {{can be as simple as}} switching a heating system on and off to maintain a room temperature within a specified range. Sheridan [...] defines supervisory control as follows: [...] "in the strictest sense, supervisory control means that one or more human operators are intermittently programming and continually receiving information from a computer that itself closes an autonomous control loop through artificial effectors to the controlled process or task environment." ...|$|R
50|$|The tanks have {{fittings}} for filling, liquid outlet, emergency {{relief of}} excess pressure, fuel level gauge {{and sometimes a}} vapour outlet. These may be separate valves mounted {{into a series of}} 3 to 5 holes in a plate welded into the tank shell, or may be assembled onto a multi-valve unit which is bolted into one large hole on a boss welded, {{or in the case of}} an aluminium tank, extruded as part of the tank shell.Modern fill valves are usually fitted with an automatic fill limiter (AFL) to prevent overfilling. The AFL has a float arm which restricts the flow significantly but does not shut it off entirely. This is intended to cause the pressure in the line to rise enough to tell the bowser to stop pumping but not cause dangerously high pressures. Before AFLs were introduced, it was common for the filler (with integral check <b>valve)</b> to be <b>screwed</b> directly into the tank, as the operator had to open an ullage valve at the tank while filling, allowing vapour out of the top of the tank and stopping filling when liquid started coming out of the ullage valve to indicate that the tank was full. Modern tanks are not fitted with ullage valves.|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{studies of}} {{externally}} registered indicator dilution curves show a {{relation between the}} height of the curve and the detected volume. If this re lationship were established on a quantitative basis {{it might be possible to}} de termine the volume difference between paired organs or symmetrical locations in the body from the difference between two detected volumes. Cardiac stroke volume might also be measured from the difference between diastolic and sys tolic volumes. A systematic series of experiments were first carried out on models to determine the feasibility of such measurements. This paper presents the results of studies with single tube model systems in which the height of externally registered dilution curves are measured at different detected volumes. The quantitative relationship between these two variables is determined and the effect of dilution volume and flow rate on the height is evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHOD Various model systems are used but certain features are common to all (Figs. 1, 2). Flow is maintained by means of a centrifugal pump emersed in a basin fed by running water from a wall faucet. The water level is kept constant by means of an overflow discharge tube. Rate of flow from the pump to the tubing is regulated by a hand operated <b>screw</b> <b>valve.</b> The tubing is housed in presswoo...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the first}} round of studies to verify the {{technical}} feasibility of applying the Fuel-Slurry Integrated Gasifier/Gas Turbine (FSIG/GT) concept for thermoelectric power generation consuming high-ash coal (HAC). Such resource is, in most instances, considered unprofitable and usually discarded as a residue. This is part of a series dedicated to the application of FSIG/GT, which has already shown the possibility of increasing the efficiencies of conventional power generation based on sugar-cane bagasse and municipal solid waste (MSW). As before, a water-slurry of fuel particles is injected into pressurized vessels using commercially available pumps. Therefore, it avoids the cumbersome sequential or cascade feeding systems. In addition, the process does not need the application of pure oxygen or hydrocarbons to ignite the particles in the injected slurry. The slurry is prepared to contain fractions of dry-solid fuel near the limit allowed for the operation of slurry pumps. The slurry is injected into a dryer, from which the dry solid particles enter the gasifier. As the dryer and gasifier operate under similar pressures, simple rotary <b>valves</b> and Archimedes' <b>screws</b> can accomplish the transference from one vessel to the other. The produced fuel gas is cleaned to decrease its particle content and size as well alkaline concentration and reach acceptable limits for injections into standard gas turbines. Power steam turbine cycles are used to recover energy. Having in mind the low quality of HAC as fuel, the overall power generation efficiencies attained in the present study seem reasonable. Nonetheless, unlike conventional processes consuming HAC, the present one does not require de-ashing. Future studies will explore possibilities of improving the values achieved at the present instance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|The {{materials}} for treatment—crushed and roasted ore, or tailings, {{as the case}} may be—are put into the hopper above the revolving barrel, or chlorinator. This latter is made of iron, lined with wood and lead, and sufficiently strong to bear a pressure of 100 lb. to the square inch, its capacity being about 30 cwt. of ore. The charge falls from the hopper into the chlorinator. Water and chlorine-producing chemicals are added—generally sulphuric acid and chloride of lime—the manhole cover is replaced and screwed down so as to be gas tight. On {{the opposite side of the}} barrel there is a valve connected with an air pump, through which air to about the pressure of four atmospheres is pumped in, to liquefy the chlorine gas that is generated, after which the <b>valve</b> is <b>screwed</b> down. The barrel is then set revolving at about ten revolutions a minute, the power being transmitted by a friction wheel. According to the nature of the ore, or the size of the grains of gold, this movement is continued from one to four hours, during which time the gold, from combination with the chlorine gas, has formed a soluble gold chloride, which has all been taken up by the water in the barrel. The chlorinator is then stopped, and the gas and compressed air allowed to escape from the valve through a rubber hose into a vat of lime water. This is to prevent the inhalation of any chlorine gas by the workmen. The manhole cover is now removed and the barrel again set revolving, by which means the contents are thrown automatically into the filter below. This filter is an iron vat lined with lead. It has a false bottom, to which is connected a pipe from a vacuum pump working intermittently. As soon as all the ore has fallen from the chlorinator into the filter, the pump is set going, a partial vacuum is produced in the chamber below the false bottom in the filter, and very rapid filtration results. By this means all the gold chlorides contained in the wet ore may be washed out, a continual stream being passed through it while filtration is going on. The solution running from the filter is continually tested, and when found free from gold, the stream of water is stopped, as is also the vacuum pump. The filter is then tipped up into a truck below, and the tailings run out to the waste heap. The process of washing and filtration occupies about an hour, during which time another charge may be in process of treatment in the chlorinator above. The discharge from the filter and the washings are run into a vat, and from this they are allowed to pass slowly through a tap into a charcoal filter. During the passage of the liquid through the charcoal filter, the chloride of gold is decomposed and the gold is deposited on the charcoal, which, when fully charged, is burnt, the ashes are fused with borax in a crucible, and the gold is obtained.|$|R
