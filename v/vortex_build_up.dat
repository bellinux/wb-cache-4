The 120-level tower in Wuhan, China will contain offices, luxury apartments and condominiums, a 45,000 sm five-star hotel, and a 5,000 sm, 27-meter-tall private club with spectacular views at the tower’s penthouse level. Wuhan Greenland Center also features a uniquely streamlined form that combines three key shaping concepts—a tapered body, softly rounded corners and a domed top—to reduce wind resistance and <b>vortex</b> action that <b>builds</b> <b>up</b> around supertall towers.|$|R
40|$|When one splits spacetime {{into space}} plus time, the Weyl {{curvature}} tensor (vacuum Riemann tensor) gets {{split into two}} spatial, symmetric, and trace-free (STF) tensors: (i) the Weyl tensor's so-called "electric" part or tidal field, and (ii) the Weyl tensor's so-called "magnetic" part or frame-drag field. Being STF, the tidal field and frame-drag field each have three orthogonal eigenvector fields which can be depicted by their integral curves. We call the integral curves of the tidal field's eigenvectors tendex lines, we call each tendex line's eigenvalue its tendicity, and we give the name tendex to a collection of tendex lines with large tendicity. The analogous quantities for the frame-drag field are vortex lines, their vorticities, and <b>vortexes.</b> We <b>build</b> <b>up</b> physical intuition into these concepts by applying them {{to a variety of}} weak-gravity phenomena: a spinning, gravitating point particle, two such particles side by side, a plane gravitational wave, a point particle with a dynamical current-quadrupole moment or dynamical mass-quadrupole moment, and a slow-motion binary system made of nonspinning point particles.

40|$|Der Bericht behandelt im ersten Teil das Stroemungsfeld einer ebenen Wirbelwelle, die mit einer elektromagnetischen Anordnung angeregt wird. Die von dem Anregungsgebiet abfliessende Stroemung entwickelt sich zu einer Wirbelstrasse. Diese Entwicklung laesst sich durch ein einfaches Potentialmodell oder mit dem Laufzeiteffekt beschreiben. In einem zweiten Teil werden einer Zylindernachlaufstroemung Wirbelwellen mit Frequenzen vom 0, 3 bis 3 fachen der natuerlichen Abloesefrequenz ueberlagert. Die verschiedenen Phaenomene, die im Amplituden-Frequenzraum des Nachlaufes auftreten, sind Schwebung, Steuerung und Wirbelvereinigung. (orig.) The report {{deals in}} a first part with the flow fields of two {{dimensional}} vortex waves (shear waves), which are stimulated by electromagnetic forces. Downstream of the excitation area the <b>vortex</b> waves <b>build</b> <b>up</b> to a <b>vortex</b> street. This development can be described by a simple irrotational theory or explained with the travelling time effect. A {{second part of the}} report deals with the superposition of a wake of a circular cylinder by vortex waves. The ratio between the frequency of the vortex wave and the natural frequency of the cylinder wake varies between 0. 3 and 3. Various phenomena are observed in the amplitude frequency space of the wake, as beat phenomena, control and vortex pairing. (orig.)
