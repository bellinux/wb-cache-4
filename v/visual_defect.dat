5000|$|The Ishihara color test, which {{consists}} {{of a series of}} pictures of colored spots, is the test most often used to diagnose red-green color deficiencies. A figure (usually one or more Arabic digits) is embedded in the picture as a number of spots in a slightly different color, and can be seen with normal color vision, but not with a particular color defect. The full set of tests has a variety of figure/background color combinations, and enable diagnosis of which particular <b>visual</b> <b>defect</b> is present. The anomaloscope, described above, is also used in diagnosing anomalous trichromacy. Position yourself about 75cm from your monitor so that the colour test image you are looking at is at eye level, read the description of the image and see what you can see!! It is not necessary in all cases to use the entire set of images. In a large scale examination the test can be simplified to 6 tests; test, one of tests 2 or 3, one of tests 4, 5, 6 or 7, one of tests 8 or 9, one of tests 10, 11, 12 or 13 and one of tests 14 or 15.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <b>Visual</b> <b>defect</b> due to optic {{radiation}} injury is a complication of temporal lobectomy for temporal epilepsy. To investigate whether diffusion tensor imaging can delineate {{the changes in}} optic radiations after lobectomy, we evaluated parameters on tensor images for optic radiations and correlated them with <b>visual</b> <b>defect.</b> METHODS: We examined 14 cases after temporal lobectomy. Durations after surgeries ranged from 3 weeks to 9 years. The cases were classified into three groups {{on the basis of}} the severity of visual field defect (A–C, with group C the most severe). We evaluated signals on T 2 -weighted images and parameters of tensor images, including fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), for the optic radiation in both the operated and intact side. RESULTS: On T 2 -weighted images, high signals in optic radiations were seen in four cases, occurring more than 4 weeks after surgery. The mean operated-to–intact side FA ratio in the optic radiation decreased according to severity of <b>visual</b> <b>defect</b> (group A, 0. 88; group B, 0. 89; group C, 0. 73). The mean operated-to-intact side ADC ratio showed no significant difference in the overall cases. The ratio for ADC, however, tended to increase according to <b>visual</b> <b>defect</b> in cases after 10 weeks postsurgery...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} <b>visual</b> field <b>defects</b> on driving performance, and to predict practical fitness to drive. Methods: The driving performance of 87 subjects with <b>visual</b> field <b>defects</b> due to ocular abnormalities was assessed on a driving simulator and during an on-road driving test. Outcome Measures: The final score on the on-road driving test and simulator indexes, such as driving speed, viewing behavior, lateral position, time-headway, and time to collision. Results: Subjects with <b>visual</b> field <b>defects</b> showed differential performance on measures of driving speed, steering stability, lateral position, time to collision, and time-headway. Effective compensation consisted of reduced driving speed in cases of central <b>visual</b> field <b>defects</b> and increased scanning in cases of peripheral <b>visual</b> field <b>defects.</b> The sensitivity and specificity of models based on vision, visual attention, and compensatory viewing efficiency were increased when the distance at which the subject started to scan was taken into account. Conclusions: Subjects with <b>visual</b> field <b>defects</b> demonstrated differential performance on several driving simulator indexes. Driving examiners considered reduced speed and increased scanning to be valid compensation for central and peripheral <b>visual</b> field <b>defects,</b> respectively. Predicting practical fitness to drive was improved by taking driving simulator indexes into account...|$|R
30|$|LHON was firstly {{reported}} by the VonGrafe in 1858. In 1871, the disease was named after Doctor Leber who discovered that LHON was an independent disease. In 1988, Wallace DC (Wallace et al. 1988) found that LHON was associated with mtDNA mutation. LHON typically appears in young males with clinical manifestation including central vision damage and acute or subacute, painless, binoculus or monocular vision loss (Mulliez et al. 2000). Numerous studies have reported the characteristics of <b>visual</b> field <b>defects</b> associated with idiopathic optic neuritis (ION). Marshall (1950) has detected no <b>visual</b> <b>defects</b> around central or paracentral scotoma in 90.8  % of ION cases. Trobe and Glaser (1978) have reported no hemianopia in 81 cases of ION, and considered hemianopia as an important indicator to differentiate ION from compressive optic neuropathy. In a study by Keltner et al. (1993), diffuse <b>visual</b> field <b>defects</b> are detected in 48.2  % of cases, whereas all other patients have developed focal <b>visual</b> field <b>defects.</b> Among these, the central scotoma only accounts for 3.8  %, including hemianopia {{and other types of}} <b>visual</b> field <b>defects.</b>|$|R

40|$|OF THE many {{causes of}} {{progressive}} visual failure, {{one of the}} most important is that due to compression of the optic nerve or chiasm by a surgically treatable lesion. In most instances the nature of the <b>visual</b> <b>defect</b> or the results of radiological contrast studies make the position quite clear, and dictate the appropriate management. Occasionally, however, the character of the <b>visual</b> <b>defect</b> may be unusual, and radio-logical studies either negative or equivocal, making diagnosis uncertain and the indication for surgical exploration a matter of judgement. Four cases of progressive visual failure are reported here in which investigations were not conclusive in indicating the compressive lesion, but in which exploratory craniotomy revealed a tumour.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an automated vision system used to detect the <b>visual</b> <b>defects</b> on painted slates. The vision system that has been developed consists of two major components. The first component addresses issues such as the mechanical implementation and interfacing the inspection system with the sensing and optical equipment whereas the second component involves {{the development of an}} image processing algorithm able to identify the <b>visual</b> <b>defects</b> present on the slate surface. Imaging the slate surface was challenging because it is dark coloured, glossy, has depth profile non-uniformities and is being transported at high speed on a conveyor. Thus, choosing an adequate illumination set–up was a key issue {{in the development of the}} vision system. After extensive testing, a collimated lighting topology proved to be an appropriate solution to image the slate. The <b>visual</b> <b>defects</b> on the slate surface are detected by employing a computationally efficient fourcomponent image–processing algorithm. The vision system was mounted on an industrial conveyor and slate inspection was carried out at production line speeds. The prototype system was subjected to robustness tests and experimental results ar...|$|R

30|$|In this study, {{we found}} that MD and VFI were {{negatively}} correlated with BCVA (LogMAR) in all tested eyes with or without stable BCVA (LogMAR), indicating the high sensitivity and stability of visual field examination in the diagnosis of LHON. We found that the <b>visual</b> field <b>defects</b> were mostly central (53.1  %) and paracentral (24.5  %) scotoma at early stages of LHON. As the disease progressed, the <b>visual</b> field <b>defects</b> exasperated around the scotoma, and extended from two sides or enlarged surrounding the blind spot. In the late phase, <b>visual</b> field <b>defects</b> mainly included central isopter constriction (36.7  %), diffuse defects (42.9  %), hemianopia or quadrantanopia (10.2  %), In contrast to early stage: <b>visual</b> field <b>defects</b> including the nasal step and arcuate scotoma such as early glaucoma damage were seldom detected at late stages of LHON. These characteristics of <b>visual</b> field <b>defects</b> reported in this study might be useful for differentiating the diagnosis of the disease from glaucoma.|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{hemianopia}} on line bisection is not known. To study this, manual line bisection in 30 patients with unilateral cerebral hemispheric lesions was examined. The mean bisection {{point in a}} group of eight patients with left hemineglect was biased rightward (ipsilaterally), as expected. Among the remaining 22 patients, eight had right hemianopic <b>visual</b> <b>defects,</b> eight had left hemianopic <b>visual</b> <b>defects,</b> and six had normal visual fields. Both groups of patients with contralateral <b>visual</b> field <b>defects</b> had mean bisection points biased contralaterally, compared with 68 normal subjects. This bias was less than the ipsilateral (opposite) bias of patients with hemineglect. Contralateral bisection bias was more evident in those whose field defect involved the macular region. No bias was seen in patients with neither field defects nor hemineglect. The contralateral bias in hemianopia may represent either non-veridical spatial representation within a visual hemifield or a consequence of the strategic adaptation of attention into contralateral hemispace after hemianopia. ...|$|R
