40|$|Five {{different}} anti-wear additives, {{suitable for}} the formulation of environmentally adapted hydraulic fluids were tested, both commercially available and newly developed. The used base fluid was a high performance saturated complex ester. The formulated fluids 2 ̆ 7 performance was evaluated {{through the use of}} an assembled pin & <b>vee</b> <b>block</b> in a modified Falex wear tester according to wear and frictional behaviour. The combinations of tested materials were steel-steel and bronze-steel tribopairs. The friction, wear scar volume and visual appearance {{both inside and outside the}} wear scar were studied. Some of the tested combinations gave unwanted performance, such as high friction, large wear and etching damages, whereas others gave good performance. It was found that the new additives showed promising results for formulation of environmentally adapted lubricants based on saturated complex esters. Further investigations will look closer at the chemical composition of the formed tribofilms with the use of surface sensitive analysis technology...|$|E
40|$|The {{lubricants}} of {{the future}} {{have to be more}} environmentally adapted, show a higher level of performance, and give a lower total life cycle cost (LCC) than the lubricants that are used today. One way to be able to produce, choose and formulate these lubricants is to have good knowledge about the properties of the base fluids and their additive response. The base fluid properties can be divided into four different groups, i. e. physical, chemical, film formation properties and additive response. This thesis is based on the results from the Swedish HiMeC research project "Environmentally adapted lubricants for high performance components". A number of different environmentally adapted ester fluids, suitable for formulation of environmentally adapted lubricants were investigated according to properties, molecular structure and film formation capability. I t was found that both thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity are high for the esters compared to mineral fluids. There is a strong correlation between the number of carboxylate groups and the thermal conductivity. The film formation capability was investigated by the use of optical interferometry in a ball and disc apparatus. A new model for measuring the running in performance of mechanical components was developed. The tests are run un-accelerated, with the same contact pressure and speed as the real applications they represent. The method is based on a tribotest and exact measurement of the surface topography at the exact same spot before and after the test. The most interesting parameters to monitor were found to be Rdq and Rpk. It was found that even very small changes at the uppermost parts of the topography can be measured and monitored whit this method. The additive response for both traditional anti wear additives and specially designed more polar additives where studied. The test where performed at Iwate University in Japan. A modified Falex pin and <b>vee</b> <b>block</b> tribotest machine where used. It was found that the new type of additives is efficient but {{further research is needed to}} be able to formulate fluid based on this chemistry. When putting all together, it could be seen that it will be possible to tailor make base fluids with suitable properties and additivate them with the correct additives for the task they should perform. That will make it possible to achieve better results than the fluids used to day in both environmental and performance aspects. Godkänd; 2006; 20070315 (evan...|$|E

5000|$|The Avro design {{used the}} Rolls-Royce Vulture 24-{{cylinder}} X-block engine, which was two Rolls-Royce Peregrine <b>Vee</b> cylinder <b>blocks</b> mounted {{one on top}} of the other, the bottom one inverted to give the [...] "X" [...] shape. When developed in 1935, the Vulture engine had promise — it was rated at 1,760 hp (1,310 kW) but it proved woefully unreliable and had to be derated to 1,480-1,500 hp (1,100-1,120 kW). Avro's prototype Manchester L7246, was assembled by their experimental department at Manchester's Ringway Airport and first flew from there on 25 July 1939, with the second aircraft following on 26 May 1940. The Vulture engine was chosen by Avro and not stipulated by the Air Ministry as is sometimes claimed; other engine layouts considered included the use of two Bristol Hercules or Bristol Centaurus radial engines. The Handley Page HP.56, always intended as the backup to the Avro, was redesigned to take four engines on the orders of the Air Ministry in 1937, when the Vulture was already showing problems.|$|R
