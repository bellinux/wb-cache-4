40|$|Vibrothermography, {{also known}} as Sonic IR and thermosonics, is a method for finding cracks through thermal imaging of vibration-induced crack heating. Due to large {{experimental}} variability and equipment which has, up to now, yielded mostly qualitative results, little data has been available to help quantify the vibrothermographic effect. This paper quantitatively evaluates the relationship between vibrothermographic crack heating, crack size, and <b>vibrational</b> <b>stress</b> {{in a series of}} tests on 63 specimens each of Ti- 6 - 4 titanium and Inconel 718 at three different sites with different equipments. Test specimens are excited in a resonant mode. Infrared cameras record the crack heating, and <b>vibrational</b> <b>stress</b> is evaluated from the known vibrational mode shape combined with vibrational velocities measured using a laser vibrometer. Crack heating increases both with crack length and dynamic <b>vibrational</b> <b>stress</b> level. Data from all three sites gives similar probability of detection (POD) curves.

These vibrations are the leading cause for fatigue failure in turbine blades. This thesis presents the finite element analysis methods to estimate the maximum <b>vibrational</b> <b>stresses</b> of rotating structures under forced excitation. The presentation included starts with the derived equations of motion for vibration of rotating beams using energy methods under the Euler Bernoulli beam assumptions. The nonlinear large displacement formulation captures the centrifugal stiffening and gyroscopic effects. The weak form of the equations and their finite element discretization are shown. The methods implemented were used for normal modes analyses and forced vibration analyses of rotating beam structures. The prediction of peak stresses under simultaneous multi-mode excitation show that the maximum <b>vibrational</b> <b>stresses</b> estimated using the linear superposition of the stresses can greatly overestimate the stresses if the phase information due to damping (physical and gyroscopic effects) are neglected.

The moisture concentrations in the flip chip assembly have been calculated by Finite Element Simulations to determine an adequate autoclave aging period. An extended three parameter diffusion model based on Fick's law has been used. It considers an additional first order binding of the moisture and enables the modeling of a linear moisture absorption beyond the fickian saturation level, as observed for epoxies and polyimides. The diffusion properties and the adhesion of the underfiller are tested by the subsequent <b>vibrational</b> <b>stressing.</b> The results of linear-elastic finite element simulations show, that the vibrational test induces the same shear stresses and strains in the underfill material as those induced by the mismatch of the {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (CTE) between board and chip in temperature cycling. However the CTE mismatch between underfill and its adjacent materials causes additional tensile stress and strain during temperature cycling, which are not induced by the vibrational test. Thus the rapid interface test is independent of the thermo-mechanical properties of the underfill material. It enables a fast selection of underfill materials with good adhesion in a humid environment, which suit applications in harsh environments. By using a defined test setup, in which only the underfill material is varied, the assessment period is reduced to less than a week...|$|R
40|$|Vibrothermography is an {{inspection}} technique that detects cracks by observing vibration induced crack heating. Frictional crack heating in a vibrating specimen is {{directly linked to}} the resonant <b>vibrational</b> <b>stress</b> on the crack. In simple geometries we can measure the vibrational mode structure and intuit the dynamic <b>vibrational</b> <b>stress</b> field on the crack. This {{can be used to}} establish a relationship between crack heating and vibration, which will be critical for vibrothermography to be accepted as a viable inspection technology. We correlate stress to heating by exciting specimens in a well understood and repeatable resonant vibration mode. Through knowledge of the mode shape, a single point surface velocity measurement is sufficient to calculate the deformed shape of the entire specimen. The loads and stresses within the specimen are calculated from the deformed shape and used to identify the relationship between crack heating and vibration. We explore a simplified case of a bar in third order flexural resonance with a surface crack that heats in response to flexure-induced normal load. Specimens are tuned to resonate in third order flexural bending when excited with a single frequency excitation system.

40|$|The {{most common}} method for {{relieving}} residual stresses is {{post weld heat}} treatment (PWHT). PWHT is used in cases where machining of welded components and castings with high residual stresses may result in undesired distortions. The beneficial influence of PWHT on fatigue is significant at negative R- values and low stress ranges. Compared to PWHT, <b>vibrational</b> <b>stress</b> relief (VSF) has the potention for significant advantages: reduction of cost, absence of scale, no metallurgical consequences etc. The aim of the present research was to determine the effectiveness of VSR compared to PWHT, especially for welded structures with repaired welds. In the investigations, several test series were carried out, where welded components indifferent fabrication states (as welded, vibrated after welding, heat treated after welding and preloaded after welding), were submitted to fatigue loading. It is found that due to the absence of sound and common accepted guidelines and quality criteria, the success of <b>vibrational</b> <b>stress</b> relief is quite uncertain. Furthermore, it is found that in fatigue loading, VSR probably has no significant beneficial effect. During the first load cycles, about the same "stress relief" occurs as during VSR. Only in case of very low stresses and low R-ratios, VSR may have any positive effect on the fatigue life of welded structures...|$|E

40|$|Lecturepg. 43 - 48 Based on the {{development}} of numerical analysis techniques over the past decade, the engineer can easily model the internal flow conditions and vibration characteristics of turbomachinery. When focusing on vibration response of rotating blades, it is easy to predict the resonance frequency; however difficulty remains in the prediction of <b>vibrational</b> <b>stress.</b> The primary reasons include: The unsteady external excitation force and vibration response are complicated making it difficult to calculate these characteristics precisely, and; It is likewise difficult to confirm the simulation results of vibration response since the actual measurement of <b>vibrational</b> <b>stress</b> on the rotating blades presents its own set of challenges. The authors already introduced the measured actual stress on mechanical drive steam turbine blades at the resonance condition with nozzle wake during full load testing and compared the results of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and finite element analysis (FEA). On the contrary, there is not much study or discussion regarding compressor impeller resonance stress based on measuring actual stress. Considering that compressor impeller sizing has increased, it is important to deeply study the vibration phenomena relating to internal flow and blade cascade interaction excitation forces and create a clear criteria for designing large, robust impellers. In this regard, the authors introduce a unique stress measurement technique for rotating blades at full load by specially designing flexible, high response impellers to emphasize the vibration stress. The basic vibration characteristics of the nodal diameter interference diagram and Campbell diagram are explained. In order to estimate <b>vibrational</b> <b>stress</b> on the blades, the unsteady CFD analysis is applied for calculation of the external excitation force and the vibration response is analyzed. The analyzed detail results are compared with the actual measured vibration stress and vibration response systematically. Through this study, the resonance with the inlet guide vanes (IGV) and a unique blade/stator cascade interaction phenomena are found. Subsequently, the cause of these phenomena is investigated, and the authors try to explain this mechanism.

40|$|The {{subject is}} the {{aircraft}} bevel gears, which {{are part of}} the drive systems of gas turbine engines and helicopter transmissions. The article deals with defect specifics of the aircraft conical gears with a circular tooth as compared to the conical gear wheels of general engineering. The finite element method has been used to find by calculation that the main reason for destruction of aircraft bevel gears is a resonant vibration excitation of the gear wheel rim due to its nodal diameter eigenvibrations happened to be within the operating range of the transmission rotation frequencies. A parametric finite element model has been developed. It allows us to investigate the impact of modification parameters of the drive side of gear wheels on the function of the kinematic transmission error at different values of transmitted torque. Using the method of main coordinates, a reduced dynamic model of the bevel gear has been developed to allow simulating the vibration intensity of bevel gears with various parameters of the working profile modification. Within the framework of evaluation test of the dynamic model, amplitude-frequency characteristics have been constructed for the main parameters of transmission oscillations, including <b>vibrational</b> <b>stresses</b> in the teeth space. It is found that modification parameters of the transmission drive side {{have a significant effect on}} the vibration intensity of the bevel gears in the entire operating range. The main factor affecting the vibration stress amplitude in the gear wheel is the amplitude of the kinematic error function with the corresponding torque transmitted. The obtained research results can be used when designing the new aircraft drives and modernizing the existing ones. As part of the further development, it is expected to create a technique for recording the damage accumulation in the conical gears, taking into account the typical flight profile of a gas turbine engine or a helicopter. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{the design}} of subsea flow systems the {{integrity}} and reliability is paramount. As the equipment must be designed to operate at a large variety of conditions, inherent to the many processes, evaluation of the integrity is complex.. Flow induced pulsations and vibrations can cause serious design and production problems, especially in subsea gas production systems. Mechanical vibrations can be induced by internal and external flow through a complex process that is affected by numerous {{factors such as the}} piping geometry, flow conditions and fluid properties. Wellhead choke valves are commonly used to control the flow of fluids from the reservoir. During production, significant noise is produced by the flow as it passes through the choke. The noise is of broadband nature: it can be described by pressure pulsations with frequencies over a large range (1 - 20 kHz). The subsequent vibration levels can become significant when the pressure pulsations match with a certain acoustic or mechanical resonance mode of the production piping, and can lead to an increased risk of failure of nearby equipment. The paper describes a method to examine the mechanical loads on nearby equipment due to the vibrations induced by the usage of a wellhead choke by the means of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations and Finite Element Modeling (FEM). Numerical experiments were performed on a generic piping system consisting of standard pipes and bends as well as a fictive ensemble of sensor block and choke valve to explore: 1) the acoustic eigenmodes of the piping, 2) the mechanical eigenmodes of the piping and equipment, and 3) the resulting mechanical loads on the subsea equipment. It is shown that typical frequencies characteristic of noise related fatigue are such that the number of cycles, easily reaching 1010 within a few months, can be regarded as the primary source instead of the maximum stress levels. Some aspects are not considered in the current approach, such as the effect of the medium and the surrounding. These will lead to slightly lower cyclic stress estimates, and will therefore not invalidate the presented method as a worst case estimation of noise induced <b>vibrational</b> <b>stresses.</b> Copyright 2012, Society of Petroleum Engineers...|$|R

30|$|At higher {{operating}} temperature (450  h at 700  °C) the structures formed were more intensive; all {{surfaces of the}} wire had changed; however, the structures were smaller (Fig.  5 d). Wires at the anode side behaved differently. Some faceting was visible, but significant wire area became porous (Fig.  5 c). This part of the wire was only 10  mm from the anode connection (presented in Fig.  4), and after damage to the glass the coating was exposed to the dual atmosphere. The damage to the silver wire microstructure was observed even 10  mm {{from the point of}} wire exposure to the dual air–fuel atmosphere after long operational time. After several hours of operation, silver wires became brittle. This affected the mechanical strength and integrity. Even low physical stress could break the wire. This is important if a stack with silver wires is considered for an APU unit in vehicles where the system must resist <b>vibrational</b> <b>stresses</b> and strains. A cell with such brittle wires would be prone to damage caused by vibration. The risk of breaking the wire connection is significant. All these problems with silver will lead to degradation of the cell structural stability and in long-term operation to the degradation of the cell/stack performance. Zhong et al. [12] using Ag mesh for cathode current collector did not observe this type of degradation. However, they used Pt paste to improve the strength of the connection, and the test time was short. Silver commercially available has the purity of 99.95 %. Silver is rarely used by industry in pure form caused by its softness and susceptibility to damage. Also for SOFC application, silver alloys should be considered instead of pure silver. Where higher strength at elevated temperature is required, silver-palladium alloys are more suitable; however, that would increase the cost. Also the application of Ag(Al) alloys can enhance the thermal stability of silver [31]. The addition of aluminium reduces silver agglomeration at elevated temperature and prevents diffusion of silver into the matrix of support material. Wires with high Ni, Fe or Cr content are less suitable because of formation of a nonconductive oxide layer and reduced conductivity between the cathode and the interconnect. The addition of other elements and alloy formation on the silver surface may be the solution for application of silver current collectors in SOFC. Silver wires coated with gold are slightly more expensive than pure silver.|$|R

The tests were conducted by personnel from the Overhaul and Repair Department, Alameda Naval Air Station, from the Bureau of Naval Weapons Fleet Readiness Represent­ative, Pacific and from the USNPGS Department of Aeronautics. The power plant utilized for correlating purposes for a T- 56 -lOW turboprop engine, recently overhauled at NAS Alameda while the propeller was the Hamilton Standard model required for this engine. The test data reveal satisfactory correlation of the engine performance data with the Alameda test results. The discrepancies that do appear {{are the result of}} errors in the instrumentation system and do not present a major problem. All of the major facility systems function satisfactorily except the oil supply system and the chamber lighting fixtures. Engine starting and control systems were adequate although somewhat different from the designs utilized in the NAVWEPS specifica­tions for this engine. The engine support stand and thrust measuring assembly were found to be structurally sound and functioned satisfactorily. The propeller orifice assembly did not induce prohibitive <b>vibrational</b> <b>stresses</b> as was anticipated. However, the vibrational loads did cause the majority of the orifice retaining bolts to loosen during the test sequence. Three bolts were found beneath the test stand; these could have caused object damage to the engine. The major areas of discrepancy are the engine oil supply system and the test chamber lighting fixtures. The engine oil system as designed could not satisfy the requirements for the T- 56 series engine. It was necessary to re-route the oil by-pass system, to obtain a more precise control of the engine oil supply and pressure, and to provide a method to heat the oil for operation of the engine at high power set­tings. The system as temporarily modified, did function adequately during the test period. The lighting fixtures mounted on swivel joint bases oscillated vio­lently when operating the engine at Idle power. One fixture above the engine broke loose during this short period and was blown clear of the engine stand by the propeller air stream. All ceiling-mounted light fixtures were removed from the chamber before further engine operation. The acoustic survey revealed that the acoustic paneling in the in­ let and the exhaust passages functioned satisfactorily. However, the Sound Pressure Level reduction across the chamber front double-doors did not meet the specified limits. Corrective action is required to (1) provide adequate and safe lighting in the test chamber, (2) re-design and install an oil supply system compatible for operation with the T- 56 engine, and (3) provide positive locking devices on all bolted fixtures in the test chambers...|$|R

Vibrational service stress amplitudes applied at the joint of blades and hub were much larger than the inherent fatigue strength of blade 2 ̆ 7 s material, ABS resin. In order to prevent such a failure accident of a small wind turbine generator, the recommended shapes of blades and hub were proposed...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the peculiarities of {{functioning}} of murine erythron system under <b>vibrational</b> <b>stress</b> {{on the basis of}} experimental data about erythrocytes acid resistance. Experiments were made on the outbred male mice at about one age and weight that were maintained in vivarium conditions on usual diet. Animals were divided into 5 groups. Animals of 1 – 4 groups were exposed to daily thirty-minute vibration at frequencies of 8, 16, 24 and 32 Hz respectively, with amplitude of 0. 8 ± 0. 12 mmduring 14 days. Animal exposure to vibration was provided by the electromechanical converter connected to the generator of low frequency signals. The fifth group of animals was not exposed to vibration and it was used as a control. Kinetic dependences of acid hemolysis of erythrocytes was registered daily, from the 1 st to the 5 th day, and further at the 7 th, 9 th and 14 th days of experiment. Blood for analysis was taken from tail veins in 15 – 20 min after stopping of vibration. As the basic indicators characterizing resistance of erythrocytes to the hemolytic agent influence we used the hemolysis rate constant, i. e. the value inverse to cell half-life time. For analysis of acid erythrograms we also used such indicators as hemolysis duration, maximum erythrogram’s time and width of the interval of erythrocyte group dominating in the population. We processed the results of research statistically. The study showed that acid resistance of erythrocytes decreased during the first five days of vibration influence at frequencies of 8 – 16 Hz. Besides, erythrocytes were divided into fractions that indicated the erythrocytes aging and strengthening of the population heterogeneity. On the fifth day of 16 Hz influence the emission of reticulocytes was recorded. At 8 Hz influence these processes were registered on the 7 th day of the experiment. During the subsequent days the hemolysis curves were slightly displaced in relation to the control. Increase in hemolysis time and forms of erythrograms suggested the existence of erythrocytes fraction with increased resistance to the haemolytic factor. High activity of stress-induced mechanisms led to the drop in the general erythrocytes content in blood, and to the decrease in the share of low-resistant “old” erythrocytes and general increase in erythrocytes stability to the acid hemolysis. At 24 Hz vibration influence we observed similar processes; however, during the second week of action the content of “old” erythrocytes in murine blood was much higher, compared with “young” cells. Strengthening of erythrocytes heterogeneity was observed with the shift on the erythrograms to the left, emergence of several maxima, and reduction of half-life time of the cells. However, the hemolysis termination time was not reduced. At 32 Hz vibration the erythropoesis was not observed within 14 days of the experiment. Stress-induced disorder of the hemopoesis and cellular composition of peripheral blood were revealed and expressed in erythropoesis suppression, devastation of the “old” erythrocytes’ reserve, and decrease in their acid resistance. The consequence of these processes can be hypoxia of cells and tissues, {{which is one of the}} mechanisms of organs stress injuries...|$|E
40|$|Molecular {{aggregates}} like molecular crystals and clusters findimportant applications as pharmaceutical drugs, explosives, organicsemi-conductors, {{materials for}} fuel storage, etc. These systems aredominated {{by a variety}} of intermolecular interactions of differentstrengths like hydrogen bonding, dispersion, electrostatics andinduction. Traditional classical force field methods for studying theproperties of these chemical systems lack the desirable accuracy fortreatment of these different types of intermolcular interactions,while efficient treatment with electronic structure methods likesecond-order perturbative Moller-Plesset (MP 2) and coupled clustermethods are unaffordable for these large chemical systems. Methodsbased on density functional theory (DFT) suffer from their inabilityto be systematically improvable. Hence, alternative methods aredesirable for electronic structure quality predictions while beingcomputationally affordable for these molecular crystals and clusters. The Hybrid Many-Body Interaction (HMBI) method described in thisdissertation has been developed for studying the properties of thesemolecular aggregates. In this method, the system is broken down intofragments and the most important short-range interactions are treatedusing highly accurate electronic structure methods while the lessimportant but more expensive interfragment interactions are treatedusing inexpensive classical force fields. Here, we demonstrate thatthe HMBI predictions are electronic structure quality while beingcomputationally affordable. Moreover, these predictions can besystematically improved by use of more accurate electronic structuremethods and force fields. Here, the HMBI method has been employed in predicting the energeticsand structure of molecular crystals and clusters. Some othercapabilities of this method include prediction of the crystalstructure in the presence of external <b>stress,</b> <b>vibrational</b> spectra,phonon dispersion curves, thermal properties like sublimation heatsand specific heat capacities and elastic constants. We demonstratethat accurate HMBI predictions of these crystal properties allows foraccurate identification and screening of different crystal polymorphswhich is important in various applications of these materials...|$|R
