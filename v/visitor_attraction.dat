40|$|AbstractThis paper aims {{to explore}} the {{relationships}} between place attachment and perceived authenticity of major <b>visitor</b> <b>attractions.</b> The empirical {{study was conducted with}} a sample of international tourists to major <b>visitor</b> <b>attractions</b> in two capital cities, Helsinki, Finland and Jerusalem, Israel. The results indicate a positive correlation between place attachment and authenticity. Major <b>visitor</b> <b>attractions</b> located in places with considerable heritage experience value are considered more authentic, and that authenticity of <b>visitor</b> <b>attractions</b> is influenced by place attachment moderated by iconicity and heritage value of the destination region. These findings provide insight to the ways tourists perceive authenticity of <b>visitor</b> <b>attractions</b> and highlight the importance of the heritage value of tourism destinations for strategic planning and marketing purposes...|$|R

5|$|Stone is quarried {{in various}} parts of Wales, and slate {{quarrying}} has been a major industry in North Wales. The Cilgwyn Quarry was being worked in the 12th century, but later Blaenau Ffestiniog became the centre of production. The Penrhyn Quarry is still producing slates, though at a reduced capacity compared to its heyday, and the Llechwedd Slate Caverns have been converted into a <b>visitor</b> <b>attraction.</b> Several of the railways that used to carry the slates to the ports have been restored as tourist attractions, including the Ffestiniog Railway and the Talyllyn Railway.|$|E
5|$|Comprising {{an area of}} 1.6ha (4 acres), with a {{perimeter}} of 480m (1570ft), the Scottish Parliament building is located 1km (0.6mi) east of Edinburgh city centre {{on the edge of}} the Old Town. The large site previously housed the headquarters of the Scottish and Newcastle brewery which were demolished to make way for the building. The boundary of the site is marked by the Canongate stretch of the Royal Mile on its northern side, Horse Wynd on its eastern side, where the public entrance to the building is, and Reid's Close on its western side. Reid's Close connects the Canongate and Holyrood Road on the southwestern side of the complex. The south eastern side of the complex is bounded by the Our Dynamic Earth <b>visitor</b> <b>attraction</b> which opened in July 1999, and Queen's Drive which fringes the slopes of Salisbury Crags.|$|E
5|$|In March 2007 the Extraordinary Ordsall Campaign {{applied for}} a grant of £5.1 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF), to {{regenerate}} Ordsall Hall and secure its future.

Only 40 per cent of the building was then open to the public, but following restoration work further rooms {{were expected to be}} opened. The building closed for refurbishment in early 2009, and re-opened to the public on 15 May 2011.

5|$|Government {{troops were}} {{stationed}} at Aberdour Castle during the Jacobite Rising of 1715. During their stay, a second fire again caused extensive damage. In 1725, the Mortons bought an adjacent property, Cuttlehill House, which they renamed Aberdour House, and the castle {{ceased to be}} a residence. The east range was again repaired, and was used for various purposes, including a school room, a barracks, and a masonic hall. In 1924 the castle and gardens were placed in state care, and continue to be managed by Historic Scotland as a <b>visitor</b> <b>attraction.</b> The south-east wing was initially restored as a home for the custodian, and now houses a cafe. The castle is protected as a Scheduled Ancient Monument, and the castle, dovecot and walled garden are Category A listed buildings, the highest level of protection for a historic building in Scotland. The grounds, and surrounding former parks, are listed on the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes, the national register of significant gardens.|$|E
5|$|Poole Quay is a <b>visitor</b> <b>attraction</b> to {{the south}} of the town centre lined with a mixture of {{traditional}} public houses, new bars, redeveloped warehouses, modern apartment blocks and historic listed buildings. Once the busy centre of Poole's maritime industry, all port activities moved to Hamworthy in the 1970s as the Quay became increasingly popular with tourists. The Grade II* listed Customs House on the quay-front was built in 1814 and now functions as a restaurant and bar. Nearby the Grade I listed Town Cellars, a medieval warehouse built in the 15th century on the foundations of a 14th-century stone building, houses a local history centre. Scaplen's Court, another Grade I listed building, also dates from the medieval era. Poole Pottery has been redeveloped into an apartment block. Boats regularly depart from the quay during the summer and provide cruises around the harbour and to Brownsea Island, the River Frome and Swanage. Public artworks along the Quay include Sea Music – a large metal sculpture designed by Sir Anthony Caro, and a life-size bronze sculpture of Robert Baden-Powell created to celebrate the founding of the Scout Movement on Brownsea Island. At the western end of the quay near the mouth of Holes Bay is Poole Bridge. Built in 1927, it is the third bridge to be located on the site since 1834.|$|E

40|$|Foodservice outlets {{have the}} {{potential}} to enhance the experience of visitors {{to a wide range of}} <b>visitor</b> <b>attractions.</b> As such introducing authentic foodservice outlets could potentially play significant role in the development of cultural-heritage and natural attractions in Ghana. Consuming local traditional foods leave nostalgic, memorable feelings, which create 'golden locations' and in turn encourage repeat visits and increase visitor traffic at these locations. The foodservice sector has however, been supported in Ghana generally and has been largely ignored at <b>visitor</b> <b>attractions.</b> In situations where foodservice outlets are limited, visitors can potentially find themselves unable to purchase any refreshments at the attractions. This detracts from their experience and discourages repeat visits. The main aim of this thesis is critically to evaluate the integration of foodservice at Ghanaian <b>visitor</b> <b>attractions</b> and to identify a suitable approach for developing authentic foodservice outlets at the sites. This thesis derived data from both secondary and primary research. With the lack of available data and records on Ghanaian <b>visitor</b> <b>attractions</b> and foodservice operations, the primary data collection exercise used a mixed-method approach in a two-Phase study over a one-year period. An exploratory survey of <b>visitor</b> <b>attractions</b> and foodservice operations in the research area, which also involved focus groups (n= 56) and individual (n= 6) interviews, within the academia and with stakeholders of tourism and foodservice sectors. Based on the findings of the Phasel study, the Phase 2 study, involved a visitor survey (n= 528) at six selected <b>visitor</b> <b>attractions.</b> A follow-up interview was conducted with attractions and foodservice personnel (n= 24) at the attractions where the survey was conducted. The findings of the research have confirmed that the Ghanaian tourism industry has overlooked foodservice sector in the development of tourism and particularly at <b>visitor</b> <b>attractions.</b> It also established the importance of foodservice as part of the overall experiences at <b>visitor</b> <b>attractions.</b> It proposes independent! multi-owned/ franchises as the best alternative approaches for developing and integrating authentic foodservice outlets with Ghanaian <b>visitor</b> <b>attractions.</b> Therefore, the study proposes introducing formally trained staff to the informal traditional foodservice outlets to develop authentic foodservice outlets at <b>visitor</b> <b>attractions</b> as a positive way to support the tourism industry in Ghana. It also suggests that the proposals made to address the current situation in Ghana may be applicable to other countries in Africa seeking to develop sectors of their economies and be of interest to the relevant and the international bodies such as UNWTO, UNDP, and UNEP who seek to promote the development of sustainable tourism practices...|$|R
