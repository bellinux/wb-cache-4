In this cross-sectional study, data from 802 participants (247 men, 555 women; mean age, 63. 5 years) were analyzed. The measurement of the <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> of the dural sac from the level of L 1 / 2 to L 4 / 5 was taken using axial T 2 -weighted images. The minimum <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> was defined as the <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> of the dural sac at the most constricted level in the examined spine. Participants were divided into three groups according to minimum <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> measurement quartiles (less than the first quartile, between the first and third quartiles, and greater than the third quartile). A multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the association between the minimum <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> and the prevalence of low back pain. The mean minimum <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> was 117. 3 mm 2 (men: 114. 4 mm 2; women: 118. 6 mm 2). A logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, and other confounding factors, including disc degeneration, showed that a narrow minimum <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> (smaller than the first quartile) was significantly associated with low back pain (odds ratio, 1. 78; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 13 - 2. 80 compared to the wide minimum <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> group: minimum <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> greater than the third quartile measured).

Design. This study quantified trunk muscle <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>areas</b> of male and female spine loading muscles. Background. There is a lack of comprehensive data regarding the female spine loading muscle size. Although biomechanical models often assume females are the same as males, little is known regarding gender dierences in terms of trunk muscle areas and no data exist regarding the prediction of trunk muscle physiological <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>areas</b> from commonly used external anthro-pometric measures.

AIM: To correlate fetal umbilical cord <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> with birth weight. To compare large <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> of the umbilical cord with macrosomia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Umbilical cord <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> of 250 antenatal women was evaluated from 34 weeks of gestational age. The outcome measured was birth weight. Weight of newborn was measured immediately after birth. Macrosomia was defined as birth weight > 90 th percentile in the study group.

The maximum voluntary knee extension force which could be produced by the untrained subjects was 742 +/- 100 N (mean +/- SD). The trained subjects could produce a significantly (p less than 0. 001) greater force (992 +/- 162 N). <b>Cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> of the knee-extensor muscle group was 81. 6 +/- 11. 8 cm 2 in the untrained subjects and 104. 1 +/- 12. 3 cm 2 in the trained subjects (p less than 0. 001).

The circumvent geometric assumptions about the shape of the stenosis after PTCA, a videodensitometric analysis technique was used for the assessment of vascular <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>areas.</b> Elastic recoil was defined as the difference between balloon <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> of the largest balloon used at the highest pressure and minimal luminal <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> after PTCA.

40|$|Abstract: In the tandem groove rolling process, when {{a certain}} amount of wear on the work roll exists and the roll speed is not changed, the roll gap, i. e. the section height, should be {{adjusted}} to keep a mass balance between stands, i. e. multiply the exit <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> by the roll speed between stands. To investigate the actual relationship between the amount of wear on the work roll and the subsequent exit <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> variation, the authors designed wear contours and machined them on the original roll groove, i. e. on the roll groove with no wear. They then performed a pilot hot rolling test using a work roll with a worn-down groove and one with a groove with no wear, and measured the exit <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> of the workpiece while the roll gap changed. To predict the amount of roll gap adjustment that compensates wear, a model for roll gap adjustment is proposed. In the proposed model, the authors introduced the concept of equiva-lent roll gap adjustment, which reduces the increased exit <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> owing to wear up to a base exit <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> of the workpiece. Results reveal that the exit <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> calculated by the roll gap adjustment model is in good agreement with the exit <b>cross-sectional</b> <b>area</b> measured.
