2500|$|The {{transition}} between {{the ground and}} the excited state is based on the Franck–Condon principle, that the electronic transition is very fast compared with the motion in the lattice. The energy transitions can then be symbolized by vertical arrows between the ground and excited state, that is, there is no motion along the configurational coordinates during the transition. Figure 2 is an energy diagram for interpreting absorption and emission with and without phonons in terms of the configurational coordinate qi. The energy transitions originate at the lowest phonon energy level of the electronic states. As represented in the figure, the largest wavefunction overlap (and therefore largest transition probability) occurs when the photon energy is equal to the energy difference between the two electronic states (E1 – E0) plus three quanta of lattice mode i vibrational energy (...) [...] This three-phonon transition is mirrored in emission when the excited state quickly decays to its zero-point lattice <b>vibration</b> <b>level</b> by means of a radiationless process, and from there to the ground state via photon emission.

40|$|Abstract—This work {{presents}} a numerical model developed {{to simulate the}} dynamics and vibrations of a multistage tractor gearbox. The effect of time varying mesh stiffness, time varying frictional torque on the gear teeth, lateral and torsional flexibility of the shafts and flexibility of the bearings {{were included in the}} model. The model was developed by using the Lagrangian method, and it was applied to study the effect of three design variables on the <b>vibration</b> and stress <b>levels</b> on the gears. The first design variable, module, had little effect on the <b>vibration</b> <b>levels</b> but a higher module resulted to higher bending stress levels. The second design variable, pressure angle, had little effect on the <b>vibration</b> <b>levels,</b> but had a strong effect on the stress levels on the pinion of a high reduction ratio gear pair. A pressure angle of 25 o resulted to lower stress levels for a pinion with 14 teeth than a pressure angle of 20 o. The third design variable, contact ratio, had a very strong effect on both the <b>vibration</b> <b>levels</b> and bending stress levels. Increasing the contact ratio to 2. 0 reduced both the <b>vibration</b> <b>levels</b> and bending stress levels significantly. For the gear train design used in this study, a module of 2. 5 and contact ratio of 2. 0 for the various meshes was found to yield the best combination of low <b>vibration</b> <b>levels</b> and low bending stresses. The model can therefore be used as a tool for obtaining the optimum gear design parameters for a given multistage spur gear train.

50|$|The slope {{statistic}} of the IRI {{was chosen}} for backward compatibility with roughness measures in use. It is the average absolute (rectified) relative velocity of the suspension, divided by vehicle speed to convert from rate (e.g. m/s) to slope (m/km). The frequency content of the suspension movement rate {{is similar to the}} frequency content of chassis vertical acceleration and also tire/road vertical loading. Thus, IRI is highly correlated to the overall ride <b>vibration</b> <b>level</b> and to the overall pavement loading <b>vibration</b> <b>level.</b> Although it is not optimized to match any particular vehicle with full fidelity, it is so strongly correlated with ride quality and road loading that most research projects that have tested alternate statistics have not found significant improvements in correlation.|$|E

40|$|Visible {{mechanical}} vibrations were noticed on two topsides piping {{systems on}} a producing FPSO, in the Gulf of Guinea following increased production in 2008 and 2009. A field survey was undertaken on the piping of the FPSO {{to investigate the}} actual pulsation and <b>vibration</b> <b>levels</b> followed by a computer analysis to investigate if fatigue failure, caused by the actual vibrations as measured, would occur. Vibration data was collected from subsea jumpers, risers and topsides piping to ensure full coverage of the flow line systems from the wellhead to production manifolds on the topsides. The objectives {{of the study were}} to: determine the root cause of the vibrations, ascertain the <b>vibration</b> <b>levels,</b> predict fatigue occurrence and reduce <b>vibration</b> to acceptable <b>levels.</b> The study revealed that the maximum <b>vibrations</b> <b>levels</b> were caused {{as a result of an}} excitation of several mechanical natural frequencies by a broadband excitation as a result of the multiphase flow.

5000|$|This phenomenon, {{which is}} similar to a sonic boom from {{supersonic}} aircraft, was theoretically predicted in 1994. Its first experimental observation took place in 1997-1998 on the newly built high-speed railway line in Sweden (from Gothenburg to Malmo) for high-speed trains X 2000. At some locations along this line characterised by very soft ground (near Ledsgard) the Rayleigh wave velocity was as low as 45 m/s, and train speeds of only 165-170 km/h were sufficient to observe the effect. In particular, the increase in train speeds from 140 to 180 km/h was accompanied by about tenfold increase in generated ground <b>vibration</b> <b>level,</b> which agrees with the theory.

From 1994 through 2001, the deputy chief engineer of CAIC, Mr. Li Meng (李萌) led the team to successfully develop the main rotor for Z-10, winning two patents in the process. The main rotor blade, Type 95KT composite rotor blade was a top priority of the 8th 5-yr plan that first began in that era, {{and it was one of}} the ten critical technologies of Z-10. China never had such advanced technology and Mr. Li Meng had to lead his team to develop it on their own, and finished the job ahead of schedule.

It resembled {{that of the}} Renault R35, {{with two}} bogies, horizontal springs — be it here of the oil type — and five road wheels per side. The prototype also had a new Chausson radiator and more comfortable suspended crew seats. The new type however was not tested immediately; only after also Renault had presented another prototype, this time with seven road wheels — an extra wheel having been inserted in the space created by moving the bogie assembly twenty centimetres backward — both types were simultaneously compared between 7 and 23 February 1940. It was shown that the AMX suspension, though much sturdier, had a negative influence on the performance: speed and range fell with about 15%, mostly due to an incorrect weight distribution. The new seats, though clearly adding to crew comfort, were too high, preventing a soldier of normal length from closing the hood. However the new Renault suspension offered no clear advantages over the older model in terms of <b>vibration</b> <b>level</b> and crew fatigue, so both models were in the end rejected as possible modification projects of existing vehicles; AMX's type on 11 April 1940 was judged not to be acceptable for future production.|$|E
