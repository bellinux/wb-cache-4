5|$|Developments in AspectJ have {{revealed}} {{the potential to}} incorporate just-in-time compilation into the execution of aspect-oriented code to address performance demands. At run-time, an aspect weaver could translate aspects in a more efficient manner than traditional, static weaving approaches. Using AspectJ on a Java <b>Virtual</b> Machine, dynamic weaving of aspects at run-time {{has been shown to}} improve code performance by 26%. While some implementations of just-in-time <b>virtual</b> machines implement this capability through a new <b>virtual</b> machine, some implementations can be designed to use features that already exist in current <b>virtual</b> machines. The requirement of a new <b>virtual</b> machine is contrary to one of the original design goals of AspectJ.|$|E
5|$|Dirac's second-order {{perturbation}} theory can involve <b>virtual</b> photons, transient intermediate {{states of the}} electromagnetic field; the static electric and magnetic interactions are mediated by such <b>virtual</b> photons. In such quantum field theories, the probability amplitude of observable events is calculated by summing over all possible intermediate steps, even ones that are unphysical; hence, <b>virtual</b> photons are not constrained to satisfy , and may have extra polarization states; depending on the gauge used, <b>virtual</b> photons may {{have three or four}} polarization states, instead of the two states of real photons. Although these transient <b>virtual</b> photons can never be observed, they contribute measurably to the probabilities of observable events. Indeed, such second-order and higher-order perturbation calculations can give apparently infinite contributions to the sum. Such unphysical results are corrected for using the technique of renormalization.|$|E

25|$|<b>Virtual</b> reality therapy (VRT), {{also known}} as <b>virtual</b> reality {{immersion}} therapy (VRIT), simulation for therapy (SFT), <b>virtual</b> reality exposure therapy (VRET), and computerized CBT (CCBT), {{is the use of}} <b>virtual</b> reality technology for psychological or occupational therapy. Patients receiving <b>virtual</b> reality therapy navigate through digitally created environments and complete specially designed tasks often tailored to treat a specific ailment. Technology can range from a simple PC and keyboard setup, to a modern <b>virtual</b> reality headset. It is widely used as an alternative form of exposure therapy, in which patients interact with harmless <b>virtual</b> representations of traumatic stimuli in order to reduce fear responses. It has proven to be especially effective at treating PTSD. <b>Virtual</b> reality therapy has also been used to help stroke patients regain muscle control, to treat other disorders such as body dysmorphia, and to improve social skills in those diagnosed with autism.|$|E
25|$|Another ethical {{issue of}} some concern is how <b>virtual</b> reality is use by clinicians in that clinicians should be {{certified}} to use <b>virtual</b> reality for their clients/patients.
