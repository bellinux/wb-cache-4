40|$|Objective. The {{decision}} whether {{and when to}} perform a relaparotomy in secondary peritonitis is largely subjective and based on professional experience. No existing scoring system aids in this decisional process. Our aim was to search for variables that could predict positive findings at relaparotomy. Design. Retrospective, clinical study. Setting. Tertiary university hospital. Patients: Two hundred and nineteen patients of a consecutive series who underwent an emergency laparotomy for secondary peritonitis. Interventions. None. Sequential prediction models were constructed by accumulation of clinical information in chronological order using logistic regression to determine the strength of association between predictive variables and positive findings at relaparotomy outcome. Positive findings were defined as persistent peritonitis or a new infectious focus at relaparotomy. Measurements and Main Results. Relaparotomy (planned or on demand) for secondary peritonitis was performed in 117 of 219 patients (53 %), yielding either positive (n = 62) or negative (n = 55) findings. Discriminatory power for positive findings at relaparotomy improved in the successive (multivariate) models: general patient characteristics (area under the curve, 0. 60; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 52 - 0. 68), adding peritonitis-related <b>variables</b> (<b>area</b> under the curve, 0. 73; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 66 - 0. 80), adding operation-related <b>variables</b> (<b>area</b> under the curve, 0. 74; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 67 - 0. 81), and adding postoperative <b>variables</b> (<b>area</b> under the curve, 0. 87; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 82 - 0. 92). Bootstrap resampling reduced the areas under {{the curve of the}} subsequent models only slightly. Sensitivity and specificity of the final model were 82 % and 76 %, respectively, at a total error rate of 16 %. One preoperative predictor and five postoperative predictors significantly increased the need for relaparotomy: younger age, decreased hemoglobin levels, temperature > 39 degrees C, lower Pao(2) /FIO 2 ratio, increased heart rate, and increased sodium levels. Conclusions: These data suggest that the causes of secondary peritonitis and findings at emergency laparotomy for peritonitis are poor indicators for whether patients will need a relaparotomy. Factors indicative of progressive or persistent organ failure during early postoperative follow-up are the best indicators for ongoing infection and associated positive findings at relaparotom...|$|E
40|$|Summary: The {{properties}} of a <b>variable</b> <b>area</b> sampling technique, {{by which the}} observer varies the searchradius to obtain approximately a prescribed number of woody plants in each tier measured, were determined by (i) comparison of fixed <b>area</b> and <b>variable</b> <b>area</b> sampling of a computer-mapped shrub population; (ii) comparison of results from fixed <b>area</b> and <b>variable</b> <b>area</b> sampling of woody plants exceeding about 2 m height in a rata-kamahi forest; (iii) two <b>variable</b> <b>area</b> surveys of woody plants exceeding 30 cm height in a beech forest. <b>Variable</b> <b>area</b> sampling gave unbiased estimates of crown area and plant density in the computer-mapped population.

40|$|Graduation date: 1994 <b>Variable</b> <b>area</b> {{surveys are}} used in large {{geographic}} regions to estimate the density of birds distributed over a region. If some birds go undetected, {{a measure of the}} effective area surveyed, the amount of area occupied by the birds detected, is needed. The effective area surveyed is determined by observational, biological, and environmental factors relating to detectability. It has been suggested that density estimates are inaccurate, and that it is risky to compare bird populations intraspecifically over time and space, since factors influencing bird counts will vary. There have been several controversial studies where <b>variable</b> <b>area</b> survey density estimates were evaluated using density estimates calculated from spot mapping as the standard for comparison. Spot mapping itself is an unproven estimator that the previously mentioned factors also influence. Without a known population density, determining how the different density estimators perform is difficult to access. <b>Variable</b> <b>area</b> surveys of inanimate objects whose densities were known have been conducted under controlled circumstances with results generally supporting the <b>variable</b> <b>area</b> survey method, but time and inability to control for all factors limit the application of this type of study. A simulation program that distributes over a region vegetation and a known density of birds, and then simulates the process of gathering bird detection data is one tool accessible to evaluate <b>variable</b> <b>area</b> density estimates. Within such a simulation study various observational, biological, and environment factors could be introduced. This thesis introduces such a simulation program, VABS, that was written with the objectives of identifying factors that influence bird counts and determining the limitations of the <b>variable</b> <b>area</b> survey. Within this thesis are discussions concerning the several factors that have been identified as influencing bird counts and the effects that these factors had on the Fourier series, exponential power series, and Cum-D density estimates when these factors were simulated in VABS. Critical assumptions of the <b>variable</b> <b>area</b> survey are identified, and the ability of the <b>variable</b> <b>area</b> survey to estimate density for different detectability curve is examined.

Percentage of variance accounted for by the regressions was used as the criterion for best-fit. For the species-area relationship and that between the insects and plants the best model was that using untransformed data; for the species-distance and species-altitude relationships only the log/log model for the plant species-altitude relationship yielded a statistically-significant value for the correlation coefficient. Though there are significant correlations between island areas and the number of species per genus of both insects and vascular plants they support, this is not accepted as evidence for competitive exclusion.

Within this landscape, nest-site placement by female sage-grouse was influenced by landscape variables at multiple spatial scales (Dzialak et al. 2011 a); however, DSR of nests was most influenced by nest site-specific <b>variables</b> (<b>area</b> ≤ 30 × 30 m), similar to another study by Manzer and Hannon (2005). This finding is in contrast to other studies which found that landscape-level variables were most influential on the success of nests by ground-nesting birds (Stephens et al. 2005; Moynahan et al. 2007). Examining the variables that were included in the final model revealed potential mechanisms (i.e., visual and olfactory) that predators used to locate nests when considering that nest depredation and direct predation of the incubating female were the most common sources of nest failure. Last, the modeling approach used offers a simplified and unified framework for modeling nest- and time-specific covariates, fixed and random effects, complex hierarchical data structures, and multiple relationships (e.g., linear and quadratic) of the independent variables, and to account for the correlation of multiple measurements on the same bird and nest (Appendix 1).|$|E

The IRP is discussed primarily herein, presenting the actuation {{technology for the}} Flight Control System (FCS) on civil aircraft. Actuation technology {{is one of the}} key technologies for next generation More Electric Aircraft (MEA) and All Electric Aircraft (AEA); it is also an important input for the preliminary design of the Flying Crane, the aircraft designed in the author’s GDP. Information regarding actuation technologies is investigated firstly. After initial comparison and engineering consideration, Electrohydrostatic Actuation (EHA) and <b>variable</b> <b>area</b> actuation are selected for further research. The tail unit of the Flying Crane is selected as the case study flight control surfaces and is analysed for the requirements. Based on these requirements, an EHA system and a <b>variable</b> <b>area</b> actuation system powered by localised hydraulic systems are designed and sized in terms of power, mass and Thermal Management System (TMS), and thereafter the reliability of each system is estimated and the safety is analysed. These two systems are then compared in fuel penalty, safety, maintenance and installation, cost, risk and certification. A conventional Fly-By-Wire (FBW) actuation system is used as the reference case. The results show that both the EHA system and the <b>variable</b> <b>area</b> actuation system are feasible for the FCS on civil aircraft. The EHA system is proved to be quite efficient in power consumption and mass reduction. However, the reliability of EHA needs to be improved and the TMS of this system may lead to an increase in aircraft drag. The <b>variable</b> <b>area</b> actuation system demonstrates that it can significantly reduce the system design point and system size; while the localised hydraulic system is not as efficient as a centralised hydraulic system. Finally, a <b>variable</b> <b>area</b> actuation system powered by the centralised hydraulic systems is suggested for the FCS on civil aircraft and the Flying Crane. A <b>variable</b> <b>area</b> actuation system powered by localised hydraulic systems is recommended as the first step towards MEA and AEA in the future...|$|R

The present-day {{geographic}} {{distribution of}} individual species of five taxonomic groups (plants, dragonflies, butterflies, herpetofauna and breeding birds) is relatively well-known {{on a small}} scale (5 5 km squares) in Flanders (north Belgium). These data allow identification of areas with a high diversity within each of the species groups. However, differences in mapping intensity and coverage hamper straightforward comparisons of species-rich areas among the taxonomic groups. To overcome this problem, we modelled the species richness of each taxonomic group separately using various environ-mental characteristics as predictor <b>variables</b> (<b>area</b> of different land use types, biotope diversity, topo-graphic and climatic features). We applied forward stepwise multiple regression to build the models, using a subset of well-surveyed squares. A separate set of equally well-surveyed squares was used to test the predictions of the models. The coincidence of geographic areas with high predicted species richness was remarkably high among the four faunal groups, but much lower between plants and each of the four faunal groups. Thus, the four investigated faunal groups can be used as relatively good indicator taxa for one another in Flanders, at least for their within-group species diversity. A mean predicted species diversity per mapping square was also estimated by averaging the standardised predicted species richness over th...|$|E
