50|$|XGA {{should not}} be {{confused}} with EVGA (Extended <b>Video</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Array),</b> a contemporaneous VESA standard that also has 1024×768 pixels. It should also not be confused with the Expanded Graphics Adapter, a peripheral for the IBM 3270 PC which can also be referred to as XGA.|$|R
50|$|LG Leon {{comes with}} a 4.5 FWVGA IPS (Full Wide <b>Video</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Array,</b> In-plane switching) LCD {{capacitive}} touchscreen screen with 16M colors, and a true-to-nature color touchscreen that display resolution of 854x480 pixels (218 ppi pixel density), that is approximately the 16:9 format used in DVD and HDTV formats.|$|R
50|$|<b>Video</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Array</b> (VGA) is {{the display}} {{hardware}} first introduced with the IBM PS/2 line of computers in 1987. Through widespread adoption, the term has {{also come to}} mean either an analog computer display standard, the 15-pin D-subminiature VGA connector, or the 640×480 resolution characteristic of the VGA hardware.|$|R

50|$|A <b>Video</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Array</b> (VGA) {{connector}} is a three-row 15-pin DE-15 connector. The 15-pin VGA connector {{was provided}} on many video cards, computer monitors, laptop computers, projectors, and high definition television sets. On laptop computers or other small devices, a mini-VGA port was sometimes used {{in place of}} the full-sized VGA connector.|$|R
50|$|IBM premiered the {{new video}} adapter in the PCjr home {{computer}} it announced in 1983. At that time, the company called the adapter the Video Gate Array (not {{to be confused}} with the later <b>Video</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Array</b> or VGA standard), or CGA Plus. The adapter incorporated the Motorola 6845, an integrated circuit for controlling video.|$|R
50|$|In November 1988, NEC Home Electronics {{announced}} its {{creation of the}} association to develop and promote a Super VGA computer display standard as a successor to IBM's proprietary <b>Video</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Array</b> (VGA) display standard. Super VGA would enable graphics display resolutions up to 800 × 600 pixels, compared to VGA's maximum resolution of 640 × 480 pixels—a 56% increase.|$|R
50|$|The Samsung Minikit is a Linux-based smartphone. It bundles {{together}} a video camera, SVGA (Super <b>Video</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Array)</b> digital camera, an MP3 player, voice recorder, memory stick and Web cam. It comes with uClinux, an ARM9-based Soc {{and comes in}} three models—with internal storage capacities of 256 MB, 512 MB and 1 GB. Models weigh as little as 147 grams.|$|R
50|$|VIVO {{is found}} {{predominantly}} on high-end ATI video cards, {{although a few}} high-end NVIDIA video cards also have this port. VIVO on these graphics cards typically supports Composite, S-Video, and Component as outputs, and composite and S-Video as inputs. Many other video cards only support component and/or S-Video outputs to complement <b>Video</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Array</b> or DVI, typically using a component breakout cable and an S-Video cable.|$|R
5000|$|The Quarter <b>Video</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Array</b> (also {{known as}} Quarter VGA, QVGA, or qVGA) {{is a popular}} term for a {{computer}} display with 320×240 display resolution. QVGA displays were most often used in mobile phones, personal digital assistants (PDA), and some handheld game consoles. Often the displays are in a [...] "portrait" [...] orientation (i.e., taller than they are wide, as opposed to [...] "landscape") and {{are referred to as}} 240×320.|$|R
50|$|DMS-59 (Dual Monitor Solution, 59 pins) is {{generally}} used for computer video cards. It provides two Digital Visual Interface (DVI) or <b>Video</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Array</b> (VGA) outputs {{in a single}} connector. An adapter cable is needed for conversion from DMS-59 (digital) to DVI (digital) or VGA (analog), and different types of adapter cables exist. The connector is four pins high and 15 pins wide, with a single pin missing from the bottom row, in a D-shaped shell, with thumbscrews.|$|R
40|$|As the microelectronic {{industry}} grows {{there has}} been an exponential increase in the importance of FPGAs in modern digital circuit design. FPGAs not only provided an advantage of being reconfigurable but also come in extremely small packaging. In this paper we use the Xilinx Spartan 3 AN series FPGA and propose its use as part of a System on Chip controller for a <b>Video</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Array</b> (VGA), that serves {{as one of the most}} popular display units today...|$|R
40|$|This {{software}} performs two functions: (1) taking stereo image pairs as input, it computes stereo disparity maps {{from them}} by cross-correlation to achieve 3 D (three-dimensional) perception; (2) taking {{a sequence of}} stereo image pairs as input, it tracks features in the image sequence to estimate {{the motion of the}} cameras between successive image pairs. A real-time stereo vision system with IMU (inertial measurement unit) -assisted visual odometry was implemented on a single 750 MHz/ 520 MHz OMAP 3530 SoC (system on chip) from TI (Texas Instruments). Frame rates of 46 fps (frames per second) were achieved at QVGA (Quarter <b>Video</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Array</b> i. e. 320 240), or 8 fps at VGA (<b>Video</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Array</b> 640 480) resolutions, while simultaneously tracking up to 200 features, taking full advantage of the OMAP 3530 's integer DSP (digital signal processor) and floating point ARM processors. This is a substantial advancement over previous work as the stereo implementation produces 146 Mde/s (millions of disparities evaluated per second) in 2. 5 W, yielding a stereo energy efficiency of 58. 8 Mde/J, which is 3. 75 better than prior DSP stereo while providing more functionality...|$|R
30|$|The {{contributions}} of the work {{presented in this paper}} describe a detailed morphology [6] FPGA architecture, implementing reconfigurable shape structuring elements (SE) and efficient morphology operators capable of obtaining dilation and erosion from the same function. The FPGA design can be reconfigured during operation, obtaining a large degree of flexibility. Applying the presented architecture for augmented vision obtains a highly flexible edge overlay visual enhancement system capable of obtaining multiple morphology edge gradient types with user-tunable edge size and magnitude while meeting real-time constraints for <b>video</b> <b>graphics</b> <b>array</b> (VGA), extended <b>graphics</b> <b>array</b> (XGA) and high-definition (HD) resolutions.|$|R
5000|$|FWVGA is an {{abbreviation}} for Full Wide <b>Video</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Array</b> {{which refers to}} a display resolution of 854×480 pixels. 854×480 is approximately the 16:9 aspect ratio of anamorphically [...] "un-squeezed" [...] NTSC DVD widescreen video and considered a [...] "safe" [...] resolution that does not crop any of the image. It is called Full WVGA to distinguish it from other, narrower WVGA resolutions which require cropping 16:9 aspect ratio high-definition video (i.e. it is full width, albeit with considerable reduction in size).|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the initial}} range of PS/2 models were {{equipped}} with a new frame buffer known as the <b>Video</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Array,</b> or VGA for short. This effectively replaced the previous EGA standard. VGA increased graphics memory to 256 KB and provided for resolutions of 640×480 with 16 colors, and 320×200 with 256 colors. VGA also provided a palette of 262,144 colors (as opposed to the EGA palette of 64 colors). The IBM 8514 and later XGA computer display standards were also introduced on the PS/2 line.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we analyze {{application}} of amorphous Indium‐Gallium‐Zinc‐Oxide thin film transistors (a‐InGaZnO TFTs) to voltage‐driven pixel electrode circuit {{that could be}} used for 4. 3 ‐in. wide <b>video</b> <b>graphics</b> <b>array</b> (WVGA) full color active‐matrix organic light‐emitting displays (AM‐OLEDs). Simulation results, based on a‐InGaZnO TFT and OLED experimental data, show that both device sizes and operational voltages can be reduced when compared to the same circuit using hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a‐Si:H) TFTs. Moreover, the a‐InGaZnO TFT pixel circuit can compensate for the threshold voltage variation (ΔV TH) of driving TFT within acceptable operating error range...|$|R
40|$|Progress in {{environmental}} stability and processability, {{and the increase}} of the field-effect mobility of organic semiconductors has triggered their use as the active element in microelectronic devices. The advantages of their application are the easy processing, for example, spin-coating and ink-jet printing, without a temperature hierarchy, and their mechanical flexibility. Applications are foreseen {{in the field of}} large-area electronics where numerous devices are integrated on low-cost substrates such as plastics. The first flexible, even rollable, quarter <b>video</b> <b>graphics</b> <b>array</b> (QVGA) active matrix displays based on organic semiconductors have already been reported. [1...|$|R
50|$|Over time {{mobile phones}} {{have seen an}} {{increased}} emphasis placed on user personalization. Far from {{the black and white}} screens and monophonic ringtones of the past, phones now offer interactive wallpapers and MP3 TruTones. In the UK and Asia, WeeMees have become popular. WeeMees are three-dimensional characters that are used as wallpaper and respond to the tendencies of the user. <b>Video</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Array</b> (VGA) picture quality allows people to change their background with ease without sacrificing quality. All of these services are downloaded through the provider with the goal to make the user feel connected to the phone.|$|R
50|$|The phone has a 3.0 in {{capacitive}} {{touch screen}} LCD. It has a resolution of 320 by 480 pixels half-size <b>video</b> <b>graphics</b> <b>array</b> (HVGA) with 24-bit depth. On the back is a 3.2-megapixel camera with fixed focus. Photos can be geotagged. The camera can be accessed via the touchscreen menu, or via the dedicated camera button {{on the side of}} the phone. The Xperia X8 uses a 600 MHz Qualcomm MSM7227 processor, has a 3-axis accelerometer and built-in Global Positioning System (GPS), a digital compass, an ambient light sensor and a lug for attaching a strap.|$|R
50|$|Most often those {{programs}} used a blue {{background for the}} main screen, with white or yellow characters, although commonly they had also user color customization. They often used box-drawing characters in IBM's code page 437. Later, the interface became deeply influenced by graphical user interfaces (GUI), adding pull-down menus, overlapping windows, dialog boxes and GUI widgets operated by mnemonics or keyboard shortcuts. Soon mouse input was added - either at text resolution as a simple colored box or at graphical resolution thanks {{to the ability of}} the Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA) and <b>Video</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Array</b> (VGA) display adapters to redefine the text character shapes by software - providing additional functions.|$|R
5000|$|Wide VGA or WVGA, {{sometimes}} just WGA, an abbreviation for Wide <b>Video</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Array</b> is any display resolution {{with the same}} 480 pixel height as VGA but wider, such as 720×480 (3:2 aspect ratio), 800×480 (5:3), 848×480, 852×480, 853×480 or 854×480 (~16:9).It is a common resolution among LCD projectors and later portable and hand-held internet-enabled devices (such as MID and Netbooks) as {{it is capable of}} rendering web sites designed for an 800 wide window in full page-width. Examples of hand-held internet devices, without phone capability, with this resolution include: Spice stellar nhance mi-435, ASUS Eee PC 700 series, Dell XCD35, Nokia 770, N800, and N810.|$|R
50|$|<b>Video</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Array</b> (VGA) refers {{specifically}} to the display hardware first introduced with the IBM PS/2 line of computers in 1987. Through its widespread adoption, VGA has also come to mean either an analog computer display standard, the 15-pin D-subminiature VGA connector or the 640×480 resolution itself. While the VGA resolution was superseded in the personal computer market in the 1990s, it became a popular resolution on mobile devices in the 2000s. VGA is still the universal fallback troubleshooting mode {{in the case of}} trouble with graphic device drivers in operating systems. In the field of videos the resolution of 640×480 is called Standard Definition (SD) - in comparison for instance to HD (1280×720) or Full HD (1920×1080).|$|R
50|$|The 5151 was {{designed}} {{to work with the}} PC's Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA) text-only graphics card, but the third-party Hercules Graphics Card became a popular companion to the 5151 screen because of the Hercules' comparatively high-resolution bitmapped 720×348 pixel monochrome graphics capability, much used for business presentation graphics generated from spreadsheets like Lotus 1-2-3. This was much higher resolution than the alternative IBM Color Graphics Adapter 320×200 pixel, or 640×200 pixel graphic standard. It could also run most programs written for the CGA card's standard graphics modes. Monochrome monitors continued to be used, even after the introduction of higher resolution color IBM Enhanced <b>Graphics</b> Adapter and <b>Video</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Array</b> standards in the late 1980s, for dual-monitor applications.|$|R
40|$|This work {{evaluates the}} {{feasibility}} of using 802. 11 g ad hoc and 3 G cellular broadband networks to wirelessly stream ultrasound video in real-time. Telemedicine ultrasound applications in events such as disaster relief and first-response triage can incorporate these technologies, enabling onsite medical personnel to receive assistance with diagnostic decisions by remote medical experts. the H. 264 scalable video codec was used to encode echocardiographic video streams at various image resolutions (<b>video</b> <b>graphics</b> <b>array</b> [VGA] and quarter <b>video</b> <b>graphics</b> <b>array</b> [QVGA]) and frame rates (10, 15, 20, and 30 frames/s). the video stream was transmitted using 802. 11 g and 3 G cellular technologies, and pertinent transmission parameters such as data rate, packet loss, delay jitter, and latency were measured. 802. 11 g permits high frame rate and VGA resolution and has low latency and jitter, but it is suitable only for short communication ranges, whereas the 3 G cellular network allows medium to low frame rate streaming at QVGA image resolution with medium latency. However, video streaming can take place from any location with 3 G service to any other site with Internet connectivity. the transmitted ultrasound video streams were subsequently recorded and evaluated by physicians with expertise in medical ultrasonography who evaluated the diagnostic value of the received video streams relative to the original videos. They expressed the opinion that image quality {{in the case of}} both 802. 11 g and 3 G was fully to adequately preserved, but missed frames could momentarily decrease the diagnostic value. This research demonstrates that 3 G and 802. 11 g wireless networks combined with efficient video compression make diagnostically valuable wireless streaming of ultrasound video feasible...|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to having applications for streaming video, super-resolution has many applications in numerous fields. In some cases where poor video quality is due to hardware limitations, namely the complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) sensor resolution or a lens on a camera, super-resolution {{can be used to}} help rectify or improve video quality. Examples of hardware limitations include the CMOS sensor on a <b>video</b> <b>graphics</b> <b>array</b> (VGA) camera where the resolution is already fixed or the zoom length of the lens of a digital camera that is fixed. Note that although the process technology for a sensor can be changed to improve resolution, it can also introduce new problems [6]. If the video is not up to par, super-resolution can be used to boost image quality and resolution.|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} a {{compression}} system to significantly {{reduce the size of}} high resolution PC /AT based <b>Video</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Array</b> (VGA) image (picture) files, which can range from 64 Kbytes to over 1 Mbyte, stimulated an extensive research program that resulted in the development of new image compression systems. This Discrete Cosine Transform (DOT) based compression scheme can reduce VGA image file sizes by a factor of more than 6 -to- 1 with only minor detectable image degradation. The technology to be discussed is designed specifically to operate on the PC /Ál-based platform equipped with VGA display. This paper will discuss the characteristics of VGA images versus full color RGB images and the compatibilities between these two types of images. 1...|$|R
50|$|Each cog {{has access}} to some {{dedicated}} counter-timer hardware, and a special timing signal generator intended to simplify the design of video output stages, such as composite PAL or NTSC displays (including modulation for broadcast) and <b>Video</b> <b>Graphics</b> <b>Array</b> (VGA) monitors. Parallax thus makes sample code available which can generate video signals (text and somewhat low-resolution graphics) using a minimum parts count consisting of the Propeller, a crystal oscillator, and a few resistors to form a crude digital-to-analog converter (DAC). The frequency of the oscillator is important, as the correction ability of the video timing hardware {{is limited to the}} clock rate. It is possible to use multiple cogs in parallel to generate a single video signal. More generally, the timing hardware can be used to implement various pulse-width modulation (PWM) timing signals.|$|R
