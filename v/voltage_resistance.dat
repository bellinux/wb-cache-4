50|$|Solid {{aluminum}} {{electrolytic capacitors}} have no known inherent wear-out failure mechanism. In addition the solid electrolyte offers {{a very long}} time stability of the electrical and thermal characteristics. They remain constant throughout {{a very long time}} without time-depending changes. The dependence of the impedance and ESR at lower temperatures is very low compared with non-solid electrolytes. The capacitors are insensible against high inrush or switch-off currents and can be operated without a series resistor, whereby the SAL electrolytic capacitors at high current loads have a much higher reliability with respect to tantalum electrolytic capacitors. In addition, the dielectric aluminum oxide in combination with the electrolyte manganese dioxide has a relatively high <b>voltage</b> <b>resistance</b> against wrong polarity.|$|E
5000|$|After the {{discovery}} of the electron in 1897, the Drude model, which describes electrical conduction in metals, was developed very quickly. By associating the somewhat abstract concept of moving charge with the rather more concrete motion of the charged electrons, the Drude model effectively deals with the traditional [...] "charge current" [...] and the Heaviside [...] "energy current" [...] views simultaneously. With this achievement of [...] "unification", the energy current approach has largely lost favour, because in omitting the concepts related to conduction it has no direct model for (for example) Ohm's Law.

5000|$|The {{simplest}} input, and the {{one most}} identified with circuit bending, is the body contact, where the performer's touch causes the circuit to change the sound. Often metal knobs, plates, screws or studs are wired to these circuit points to give easier access to these points from the outside {{the case of the}} device. Since creative experimentation is a key element to the practice of circuit bending, there is always a possibility that short circuiting may yield undesirable results, including component failure. In particular, connecting the power supply or a capacitor directly to a computer chip lead can destroy the chip and make the device inoperable. Before beginning to do circuit bending, a person should learn the basic risk factors about working with electrical and electronic products, including how to identify capacitors (which can give a person a serious shock due to the electrical charge that they store), and how to avoid risks with AC power. For safety reasons, a circuit bender should have a few basic electronics tools, such as a multimeter (an electronic testing device which measures <b>voltage,</b> <b>resistance</b> and other factors). It is advised that beginner circuit benders should never [...] "bend" [...] any device that gets its power from mains electricity (household AC power), as this would carry a serious risk of electrocution. Circuit bending can also be carried out in interactive electronic audio games. People modify their electronic games to enhance the quality of recordings used for fan-made projects or to change the speed of the game which results in a pitch change. This makes the gameplay easier, especially if the game gets impossibly fast. Adding a knob or a switch to change the pitch of the game can lead to some disadvantages which include the game can change its pitch slightly when its lights are turned on, and it can cause the batteries to drain out quickly on high speeds.|$|E

The state equation indicates that the battery’s output voltage is determined by both open circuit voltage and polarization voltage, whereas the polarization voltage is directly related to its corresponding resistance, capacitance and current.

40|$|Enhanced {{proximity}} effect by mid gap Andreev resonant state (MARS) in a diffusive normal metal / insulator / triplet superconductor (DN/TS) junction is studied {{based on the}} Keldysh-Nambu quasiclassical Green's function formalism. By choosing a p-wave superconductor as a typical example of TS, conductance of the junction and the spatial variation of quasiparticle local density of states (LDOS) in DN are calculated as {{the function of the}} magnitudes of the resistance R_d, Thouless energy in DN and the transparency of the insulating barrier. The resulting conductance spectrum has a zero bias conductance peak (ZBCP) and LDOS has a zero energy peak (ZEP) except for α = π/ 2 (0 ≤α≤π/ 2), where α denotes the angle between the lobe direction of the p-wave pair potential to the normal to the interface. These peaks are revealed to be suppressed by applying a magnetic field. When the magnitude of R_d/R_ 0 is sufficiently large, the total zero <b>voltage</b> <b>resistance</b> of the junction is almost independent of the R_d for α≠π/ 2. The extreme case is α= 0, where total zero <b>voltage</b> <b>resistance</b> is always R_ 0 / 2.

We demonstrate an empirical regression modeling of an X-ray radiation sensor based on a graphene field effect transistor (GFET). The experimental data obtained from published work only showed the values of resistance, R versus back gate voltage, Vbg for X-ray flux, E of 0 kV, 30 kV and 40 kV. Least Squares Estimation (LSE) in nonlinear regression model is utilized to obtain the individual polynomial regression model of resistance versus back gate voltage model {{for each of the}} 3 X-ray flux. LSE with multiple nonlinear regression incorporating with Nimmo and Atkinsmethod is employ to get a unified polynomial regression based on the individual model. The model is simulated in MATLAB and provide fast execution time. The unified model for is able to predict the resistance versus back gate voltage for various X-ray radiation flux beyond these three values given values. In addition to that, we are able to find the limit of X-ray flux based on the initial characteristic. Moreover, our technique enable one to visualize the interrelationship between R, Vbg and E variables and perform multivariate analysis.
