The original method used a TAE buffering system and incorporated a modified <b>vacuum</b> <b>blotting</b> system for the transfer of proteins onto a membrane (originally PVDF). The modified <b>vacuum</b> <b>blotting</b> system is actually a vacuum-assisted capillary transfer, since the vacuum only helps fluid that has already gone through the gel and membrane to leave the system.|$|E

(1982) The term eastern {{blotting}} {{was specifically}} rejected by two separate groups: Reinhart and Malamud {{referred to a}} protein blot of a native gel as a native blot; Peferoen et al., opted to refer to their method of drawing SDS-gel separated proteins onto nitrocellulose using a vacuum as <b>Vacuum</b> <b>blotting.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A general {{blotting}} procedure {{starts with}} extraction of total RNA from a homogenized tissue sample or from cells. Eukaryotic mRNA {{can then be}} isolated {{through the use of}} oligo (dT) cellulose chromatography to isolate only those RNAs with a poly(A) tail. [...] RNA samples are then separated by gel electrophoresis. Since the gels are fragile and the probes are unable to enter the matrix, the RNA samples, now separated by size, are transferred to a nylon membrane through a capillary or <b>vacuum</b> <b>blotting</b> system. [...] A nylon membrane with a positive charge is the most effective for use in northern blotting since the negatively charged nucleic acids have a high affinity for them. The transfer buffer used for the blotting usually contains formamide because it lowers the annealing temperature of the probe-RNA interaction, thus eliminating the need for high temperatures, which could cause RNA degradation. [...] Once the RNA has been transferred to the membrane, it is immobilized through covalent linkage to the membrane by UV light or heat. After a probe has been labeled, it is hybridized to the RNA on the membrane. Experimental conditions that can affect the efficiency and specificity of hybridization include ionic strength, viscosity, duplex length, mismatched base pairs, and base composition. [...] The membrane is washed to ensure that the probe has bound specifically and to prevent background signals from arising. The hybrid signals are then detected by X-ray film and can be quantified by densitometry. To create controls for comparison in a northern blot, samples not displaying the gene product of interest can be used after determination by microarrays or RT-PCR.|$|E

Dahle, Senior scientist Co-supervisors: Vu Tan Trao, Ass. Prof., M. D., Ph. D.; Bui Duc Duong, M. D., Ph. D. Sponsor: University of Oslo, Faculty of Medicine, Institute of General Practice and Community Medicine, Section for International Health. Vietnam {{was among}} the high-burden tuberculosis countries. Molecular typing is not available on a routine basis in the Vietnamese National Tuberculosis Program’s laboratories. DNA fingerprinting of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an international standard epidemiologic tool, which exploits variability in both the number and genomic position of Insertion Sequence 6110. This method allows generating strain specific DNA patterns (DNA fingerprints). Besides, IS 6110 -Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) analysis has proven useful for the recognition of outbreaks in communities, modes transmission and determination of genetic diversity in M. tuberculosis populations world-wide. To understand “Emerging strains” of M. tuberculosis and their epidemiology and distribution, RFLP studies are considered valuable for the public health aspects of the Vietnamese National Tuberculosis Program. Sputum smears collected, AFB microscopy performed and M. tuberculosis strains were grown on Löwenstein-Jensen slants for 4 to 6 weeks at local hospitals. PCR was used to detect M. tuberculosis DNA and a probe hybridization technique was used for genotyping. DNA was extracted, digested and separated by using horizontal 0. 8 % agarose gels in Tris-acetate buffer and <b>vacuum</b> <b>blotted</b> onto nylon membranes. For the IS 6110 RFLP, the DNA was hybridized to the 254 -bp PCR product of IS 6110 and visualized by a digoxigenin-dUTP labelling and detection kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) in Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) in Norway. The sample size {{of this study was}} too small to make conclusive recommendations. However, clear indications arise. The East African Indian family appears to represent a well established epidemic and presented an epidemiological pattern indicating recent transmission both within and between urban and rural areas. The Beijing and other families however, appeared to represent isolates of ongoing importation to northern of Vietnam. Multi-drug resistance was not found to be related to any particular Mycobacterium tuberculosis family. Despite the presence of several M. tuberculosis lineages and the large genetic diversity in the MTB population presented in northern Vietnam, spoligotyping should be considered valuable screening method for clustering of M. tuberculosis isolates and their assignment to known genotypes. Also the affordability reproducibility of the method is in its advantag...|$|R

To monitor the fate of these toxins in soil, a dot blot enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that detects free and particle-bound toxins from B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki and subsp. tenebrionis was developed. The lower limit of detection of the toxins, either free or adsorbed or bound on the clay minerals montmorillonite (M) or kaolinite (K) or on the clay-particle-size fraction separated from soil (by sedimentation according to Stokes' Law), was approximately 3 ng. Antibodies (Ab) to the toxins from B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki and from B. thuringiensis subsp. thuringiensis were raised in goats and rabbits, respectively, and each Ab was rendered specific by adsorption onto CNBr-activated Sepharose coupled with the other toxin. The preadsorbed Ab were specific for the toxins from both subspecies, both free and bound on M, K, or the clay-particle-size fraction of soil. The toxins that were added to sterile and nonsterile soil amended with M or K or not amended were detected on the clay-particle-size fraction of the soil after various periods of incubation by the dot blot ELISA. No toxins were detected on the silt- and sand-particle-size fractions. Each dot blot, containing various amounts of toxins and/or clays, was applied to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in a dot <b>blot</b> <b>vacuum</b> system. The toxins were still detectable on the clay-particle-size fraction of nonsterile soil after 40 days. This agreed with preliminary results of other studies in this laboratory that when these toxins bind on clay minerals, they become resistant to utilization by microorganisms...|$|R

Plasmid DNA from the bacterial isolates and marker plasmids of E. coli V 517 were extracted using Wizard Plus SV Minipreps plasmid DNA Purification kit (Promega, USA) and was separated in 0.8 % agarose gel at 70 volts for 4  h. After depurination, denaturation, and neutralization of the gel, DNAs were transferred onto a Hybond N + nylone membrane (Nycomed Amershamplc, Buckinghamshire, UK) with a <b>vacuum</b> <b>blotting</b> system for 3 – 4  h and fixed by UV exposure. The membrane with blotted DNA was sequentially subjected to pre-hybridization and hybridization with a labeled probe.

40|$|W e have {{developed}} a fast and efficient method for transferring nucleic acids onto nylon membranes. This. method requires less DNA for transfer; no decrease in efficiency is observed after successive probing, and sev-eral gels can be processed simultaneously. We believe that this technique is of general interest in routine anal-ysis of multiple samples in population genetic studies or in diagnosis purposes. Q 1991 Acndemic Presa. Inc. Transfer of nucleic acids from agarose gels to nitro-cellulose or nylon membranes is a technique widely used in molecular biology. Several procedures already de-scribed include: (i) capillary blotting, originally devel-oped by Southern (1) : (ii) electroblotting (2) : and more recently, (E) <b>vacuum</b> <b>blotting</b> (3). This latter method offers some significant advantages: transfer is rapid and quantitative, with a high band resolution, but it does require an expensive specific device. In this paper, we describe a very simple way of trans-ferring nucleic acids from agarose gel to nylon mem-brane that combines both capillary transfe;:and vac-uum blotting and avoids the requirement of a specific apparatus. It also allows simultaneous blotting of sev-eral gels of any size. We propose the name “pocket blot-ting ” for this efficient, simple, and inexpensive method. MATEFUAL AND METHODS Human DNA was prepared from peripheral blood samples. Celis were lysed in hypotonic buffer (4), essen-tially as described by Maniatis et al. (5).

40|$|The {{identity}} of the physiologically important Cry 1 A receptor protein(s) in the lepidopteran Manduca sexta has {{been a matter of}} dispute due to the multiple proteins which bind the Cry 1 Ac toxin. Cry 1 Aa, Cry 1 Ab, and Cry 1 Ac exhibit essentially identical toxicities toward M. sexta larvae and show a high degree of sequence and presumed structural identities. These similarities make it likely that there is a common mechanism of toxicity in these lepidopteran-specific toxins in terms of both mode of action and the receptor proteins through which these toxins exert their lepidopteran-specific toxicity. Investigators in our laboratory previously demonstrated that the cloned 210 -kDa glycoprotein BT-R 1 binds all three Cry 1 A toxins (T. P. Keeton and L. A. Bulla, Jr., Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 63 : 3419 – 3425, 1997). This protein remains a common binding protein even after being subjected to various midgut membrane preparation and processing protocols. The method used to isolate proteins from the M. sexta larval midgut in no significant way affects the results of ligand binding and <b>vacuum</b> <b>blotting</b> experiments, and we have been unable to detect specific, high-affinity binding of any Cry 1 A toxin to Cry 1 Ac binding proteins other than BT-R 1. Alterations in blot substrate and blocking, hybridization, and washing buffers support these conclusions. Collectively, these results indicate that in M. sexta the cadherin-like BT-R 1 protein is a common high-affinity receptor protein for the Cry 1 A family of toxins...|$|E
40|$|Thirty-three {{clinical}} isolates from male nongonococcal urethritis and 28 isolates from {{soft tissue}} infections and ulcers {{were identified as}} Bacteroides ureolyticus by conventional bacteriological tests and were compared with five reference strains of the species. Whole-cell proteins from these clinical isolates and the reference strains were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The majority of the strains from the two sources could be divided into five different groups, named phenons I to V; phenons I to IV have been described previously by others, while phenon V has been described recently by us. Digestion of chromosomal DNA from 16 of the clinical isolates (including strains representative {{of each of the}} five SDS-PAGE phenons) and the five reference strains was attempted with restriction endonucleases EcoRI, PstI, SmaI, and HindIII. After electrophoresis in agarose gels, good digestion was observed with HindIII only, and 12 different banding patterns (restriction endonuclease analysis [REA] profiles) were obtained for the 19 strains digested; one nongonococcal urethritis isolate and one reference strain did not show any digestion. From the agarose gels, HindIII-digested fragments of DNA were transferred to nylon membranes by use of <b>vacuum</b> <b>blotting</b> and subjected to hybridization with 32 P-labelled 16 S- 23 S rRNA from Escherichia coli. The resultant pattern of bands (ribotypes), which depends on the restriction fragment length polymorphisms in the rRNA genes, was used as a measure of genomic variation within the species. In total, 13 different ribotypes were obtained for the 19 strains. For some strains, good correlation was achieved among the SDS-PAGE phenons, REA profiles, and ribotypes. However, for others, REA analysis and ribotyping were able to discriminate between strains which shared the same SDS-PAGE phenon. Interestingly, these two techniques of DNA characterization were able to differentiate between isolates from the genital tract and those associated with soft tissue infections and ulcers...|$|E
