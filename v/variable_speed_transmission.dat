50|$|The Octo-Auto {{failed to}} sell and in 1912 Reeves created the Sexto-Auto, a six-wheel version. The first version was a {{modification}} of the Octo-Auto. The second attempt was built on a modified Stutz Motor Company chassis and was no more successful than the first attempt. It was a luxury car, had <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> <b>transmission</b> and reportedly made several cross-country jaunts. With a price of $4,500 (over $100,000 in 2014 terms) it too never caught on with the American public.|$|E
50|$|Reeves is {{credited}} as building either {{the fourth or}} fifth American automobile, called at the time a motocycle. It had a belt and pulley based <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> <b>transmission</b> which he believed made it superior to Henry Ford's Quadricycle with only one speed. The motocycle was four-wheeled and powered by a two-cylinder, two cycle, six horsepower Sintz Gas Engine Company engine. The coach was made by the Fehring Carriage Company. The Sintz engine proved unreliable and Reeves created his own air cooled model, probably in 1897/1898.|$|E

50|$|In 1888 Reeves and his brothers, Marshal and Girney {{purchased}} the Edinburg Pulley Company and renamed it the Reeves Pulley Company. Marshal was {{the driving force}} behind this venture having first invented a tongueless corn plow in 1869 and in 1875 together with his father and uncle formed the Hoosier Boy Cultivator Company. In 1879 the company name was changed to Reeves & Co. Reeves, with his interest in motor vehicles, began to develop a motocycle and in so doing adapted his <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> <b>transmission.</b> The transmission became a product line in its own right for the Reeves Pulley Company because of its multiple applications.|$|E
50|$|Perhaps {{the best-known}} and best-selling steam car was the Stanley Steamer, {{produced}} from 1896 to 1924. Between 1899 and 1905, Stanley outsold all gasoline-powered cars, and was {{second only to}} the electric cars of the Columbia Automobile Company in the US. It used a compact fire-tube boiler to power a simple double-acting two-cylinder engine. Because of the phenomenal torque available at all engine speeds, the steam car's engine was typically geared directly to the rear axle, with no clutch or <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> <b>transmission</b> required. Until 1914, Stanley steam cars vented their exhaust steam directly to the atmosphere, necessitating frequent refilling of the water tank; after 1914, all Stanleys were fitted with a condenser, which considerably reduced their water consumption.|$|E

Carter was its first vice president. In 1905 he left to form the Motorcar Company in Jackson, featuring his friction drive car and naming it “Cartercar.” The new <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> <b>transmission</b> used friction discs, not gears, and also allowed the car to brake by reversing the lever. [...] Carter developed his friction-drive system with parts from a corn sheller.

40|$|Abstract—Gear {{boxes and}} {{direct-drive}} systems {{are commonly used}} in the transmission of large wind turbines. The components such as blades, rotor, gear box and the generator should be set up coaxially in the nacelle. Thus, the total weights of the nacelle increases {{with the size of}} the wind turbines. This research develops a hydrodynamic <b>variable</b> rotational <b>speed</b> <b>transmission</b> system combining with planetary gear-sets and the hydrodynamic transmission system for a 2 MW wind turbine. The nonlinear dynamic models of hydrodynamic transmission system and planetary gear-sets are derived firstly. The dynamic simulation analysis for the feedback type hydrodynamic transmission system (FHDTS) with feedback planetary gear-sets is implemented using MATLAB / SIMULINK.

5000|$|Reeves {{continued}} to work on developing a car and by 1904 had convinced his brothers to back another attempt. He made four Model D and six Model E cars by 1905. The D had a 12 hp engine and the E an 18-20 hp engine. In 1905 he produced an air cooled, valve in head motor with individually cast cylinders, splash lubrication, and intake and exhaust manifolds on opposite sides. That year Reeves obtained a contract for 500 of these engines from the Aerocar Company and by 1906 was making 15 engines a week. 1906 saw {{the introduction of a}} water cooled model and the Model J engined car the Reeves Go-Buggy. The Model P engine was used in the Sears Motor Buggy. The engines {{continued to}} evolve until 1910 when the family again abandoned the idea because of the collapse of the Aerocar Company. [...] Through this period Reeves had continued to make cars with the Model S and N being two of the types. The <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> <b>transmission</b> continued to be made by the Reeves Pulley Company up until 1955 when it was acquired by the Reliance Electric Company, now part of the Baldor Electric Company.|$|E

40|$|Rotorcraft {{transmission}} {{design is}} limited by empirical weight trends that are proportional to the power/torque raised to the two-thirds coupled with the relative inexperience industry has with the employment of <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> <b>transmission</b> to heavy lift helicopters {{of the order of}} 100, 000 lbs gross weight and 30, 000 installed horsepower. The advanced rotorcraft transmission program objectives are to reduce transmission weight by at least 25 %, reduce sound pressure levels by at least 10 dB, have a 5000 hr mean time between removal, and also incorporate the use of split torque technology in rotorcraft drivetrains of the future. The major obstacle that challenges rotorcraft drivetrain design is the selection, design, and optimization of a <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> <b>transmission</b> in the goal of achieving a 50 % reduction in rotor speed and its ability to handle high torque with light weight gears, as opposed to using a two-speed transmission which has inherent structural problems and is highly unreliable due to the embodiment of the traction type transmission, complex clutch and brake system. This thesis selects a nontraction pericyclic continuously variable transmission (P-CVT) as the best approach for a single main rotor heavy lift helicopter to target the above mentioned obstacle for drivetrain design and provides advancement {{in the state of the}} art of drivetrain design over existing planetary and split torque transmissions currently used in helicopters. The goal of the optimization process was to decrease weight, decrease noise, increase efficiency, and increase safety and reliability. The objective function utilized the minimization of the weight and the constraint is the tooth bending stress of the facegears. The most important parameters of the optimization process are weight, maintainability, and reliability which are cross-functionally related to each other, and these parameters are related to the torques and operating speeds. The analysis of the split torque type P-CVT achieved a weight reduction of 42. 5 % and 40. 7 % over planetary and split torque transmissions respectively. In addition, a 19. 5 dB sound pressure level reduction was achieved using active gear struts, and also the use of fabricated steel truss like housing provided a higher maintainability and reliability, low cost, and low weight over cast magnesium housing currently employed in helicopters. The static finite element analysis of the split torque type P-CVT, both 2 -D and 3 -D, yielded stresses below the allowable bending stress of the material. The goal of the finite element analysis is to see if the designed product has met its functional requirements. The safety assessment of the split torque type P-CVT yielded a 99 % probability of mission success based on a Monte Carlo simulation using stochastic- petri net analysis and a failure hazard analysis. This was followed by an FTA/RBD analysis which yielded an overall system failure rate of 140. 35 failures per million hours, and a preliminary certification and time line of certification was performed. The use of spherical facegears and pericyclic kinematics has advanced the state of the art in drivetrain design primarily in the reduction of weight and noise coupled with high safety, reliability, and efficiency.

40|$|Abstract—A system {{consisting}} of a smart antenna and a processor can perform filtering in both the time and space domain,thus reducing {{the sensitivity of the}} receiver to interfering directional noise sources. Smart antennas can be used for further increase in the capacity of a communication system and for <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> of <b>transmission</b> for multimedia information. Switched beam antenna arrays are a subset of smart antennas that cover either the x-y plane or a portion of it with multiple radiation patterns. A processor can decide which pattern to use for reception or transmission. In this paper the use of genetic algorithms (GAs) is examined in the design of switched beam antenna arrays. The antenna consists of five or six elements and the radiation patterns vary from 4 to 8,covering the x-y plane with the main beams of the radiation patterns pointing at 0 ◦, 90 ◦, 180 ◦, 270 ◦ and 0 ◦, 45 ◦, 90 ◦, 135 ◦, 180 ◦, 225 ◦, 270 ◦, 315 ◦ respectively.

40|$|The {{last couple}} of decades have seen {{the rise of the}} hybrid {{electric}} vehicle as a compromise between the outstanding specific energy of petrol fuels and its low-cost technology, and the zero tail-gate emissions of the electric vehicle. Despite this, considerable reductions in cost and further increases in fuel economy are needed for their widespread adoption. An alternative low-cost energy storage technology for vehicles is the high-speed flywheel. The flywheel has important limitations that exclude it from being used as a primary energy source for vehicles, but its power characteristics and low-cost materials make it a powerful complement to a vehicle's primary propulsion system. This thesis presents an analysis on the integration of a high-speed flywheel for use as a secondary energy storage device in hybrid vehicles. Unlike other energy storage technologies, the energy content of the flywheel has a direct impact on the velocity of transmission. This presents an important challenge, as it means that the flywheel must be able to rotate at a speed independent of the vehicle's velocity and therefore it must be coupled via a <b>variable</b> <b>speed</b> <b>transmission.</b> This thesis presents some practical ways in which to accomplish this in conventional road vehicles, namely {{with the use of a}} variator, a planetary gear set or with the use of a power-split continuously variable transmission. Fundamental analyses on the kinematic behaviour of these transmissions particularly as they pertain to flywheel powertrains are presented. Computer simulations were carried out to compare the performance of various transmissions, and the models developed are presented as well. Finally the thesis also contains an investigation on the driving and road conditions that have the most beneficial effect on hybrid vehicle performance, with a particular emphasis on the effect that the road topography has on fuel economy and the significance of this.

40|$|Underwater sensor {{networks}} (UWSNs) {{have become}} a hot research topic because of their various aquatic applications. As the underwater sensor nodes are powered by built-in batteries which are difficult to replace, extending the network lifetime is a most urgent need. Due to the low and <b>variable</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>speed</b> of sound, the design of reliable routing algorithms for UWSNs is challenging. In this paper, we propose a Q-learning based delay-aware routing (QDAR) algorithm to extend the lifetime of underwater sensor networks. In QDAR, a data collection phase is designed {{to adapt to the}} dynamic environment. With the application of the Q-learning technique, QDAR can determine a global optimal next hop rather than a greedy one. We define an action-utility function in which residual energy and propagation delay are both considered for adequate routing decisions. Thus, the QDAR algorithm can extend the network lifetime by uniformly distributing the residual energy and provide lower end-to-end delay. The simulation results show that our protocol can yield nearly the same network lifetime, and can reduce the end-to-end delay by 20 - 25 % compared with a classic lifetime-extended routing protocol (QELAR) ...|$|R
