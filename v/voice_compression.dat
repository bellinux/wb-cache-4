40|$|A good {{amount of}} {{work has been done}} in the field of <b>compression,</b> <b>voice</b> signal detection, and {{spectrum}} analysis which has been generated a number of results in the past few decades. In this research, following three important problems have been identified: 1. To distinguish between constitutional and unconstitutional Voice: It is an important task to identify authenticity of recorded voice of the specific person. Here it has been tried to develop a Simulator which identifies constitutional and unconstitutional voice. 2. To identify words sequence:It is an important task to recognize words sequence in the recorded voice. Sometimes voice may be recorded fast, clear, or loud. Here it has been tried to develop a simulator to checkout whether recorded words are in proper sequence are not. 3. To develop a simulator which does not change file extension and quality of voice signal after compression: Normally, after compression, file extension is changed and quality of the voice signal is deteriorated. Here it has been tried not to change extension of the file after compression with minor distortion in voice signal. As per review of above three problems, it is being considered a simulator may be designed which may resolve above problems. With this view, the research title is chosen as “Design of Simulator for Automatic Voice Signal Detection and Compression (AVSDC) ” which is suitable for pervasive computing, voice signal detection, and spectrum analysis. AVSDC is divided into following two parts: 1. Automatic Voice Signal Detection (AVSD) 2. Automatic <b>Voice</b> Signal <b>Compression</b> (AVSC) Automatic <b>Voice</b> Signal Detection (AVSD) is used to identify constitutional and unconstitutional voice signal automatically which is performed on the basis of frequency, pitch value, formant value, and sequence of words in the voice signal for several samples of the same voice. An underline purpose of AVSD is to identify fake voice in the security system. Frequency is being mapped to the frequency domain by computing its DFT using the FFT algorithm. Sequence of words is computed by continuously computing difference between absolute averages of two adjacent significant windows and comparing it to a predefined threshold. Word Identification System is part of AVSD which is designed to checkout whether recorded words in proper sequence are not. Normally, sometimes spoken words of voice may be recorded very fast, smoothly, or loudly. The main idea behind the word identification system is to first train it with several versions of the same word, thus yielding a “reference fingerprint”. Then, subsequent words can be identified based on how close they are to this fingerprint. The whole idea is evaluated on the basis of Euclidean distance theory. Automatic <b>Voice</b> Signal <b>Compression</b> (AVSC) takes. wav stereo file as an input and compress 50 to 60 percent of the source file at about 45 kbps with high quality voice signal by taking the help of adaptive wavelet packet decomposition and psychoacoustic model. AVSC takes. wav stereo file as an input and creates. wav mono file after compression. After compression minor distortion is also possible. The main feature of AVSC is that file extension does not change after compression. In other words, compression is done from. wav to. wav extension. AVSC takes. wav stereo file as an input and after compression it creates. wav mono file as an output. AVSC also computes entropy and SNR (Signal to Noise Ratio) of the source file during the compression...|$|R

40|$|The {{quality of}} VoIP {{communication}} relies significantly {{on the network}} that transports the voice packets because this network does not usually guarantee the available bandwidth, delay, and loss that are critical for real-time voice traffic. The solution proposed here is to manage the voice-over-IP stream dynamically, changing parameters as needed to assure quality. The main objective of this dissertation is to develop an adaptive speech encoding system {{that can be applied}} to conventional (telephony-grade) and wideband voice communications. This comprehensive study includes the investigation and development of three key components of the system. First, to manage VoIP quality dynamically, a tool is needed to measure real-time changes in quality. The E-model, which exists for narrowband communication, is extended to a single computational technique that measures speech quality for narrowband and wideband VoIP codecs. This part of the dissertation also develops important theoretical work in the area of wideband telephony. The second system component is a variable speech-encoding algorithm. Although VoIP performance is affected by multiple codecs and network-based factors, only three factors can be managed dynamically: voice payload size, speech compression and jitter buffer management. Using an existing adaptive jitter-buffer algorithm, <b>voice</b> packet-size and <b>compression</b> variation are studied as they affect speech quality under different network conditions. This study explains the relationships among multiple parameters as they affect speech transmission and its resulting quality. Then, based on these two components, the third system component is a novel adaptive-rate control algorithm that establishes the interaction between a VoIP sender and receiver, and manages voice quality in real-time. Simulations demonstrate that the system provides better average voice quality than traditional VoIP...|$|R

The used wavelet function can be chosen from the well known Daubechies class of compactly supported wavelets. Our implementation uses an adaptive manner for the wavelet domain threshold value computation. The package has two major components: a compression software which reads a standard audio data file and the reconstruction software which reads a compressed file and generates a standard audio file. Experimental results are also presented. I. DATA COMPRESSION WITH WAVELETS Data compression is a very largely used procedure for data storage purposes. There exist a large variety of compression algorithms, many of them standardised {{and each of them}} having its advantages and its backdraws. They offers speed, high compression ratio, portability etc., but {{there is not a single}} algorithm which best fit to all kind of applications. They were classified in two major categories, the first includes the ones for compression without loss and the second one includes those for compression with loss. All the algorithms have the same purpose, to reduce the information redundancy from the considered data set, but those from the first class allow a perfect reconstruction while those from the second class does not. Those procedures which allow small information losses can achieve higher compression ratio, but they can not be utilised in applications where the data set integrity is primordial (for file compression for example). This second class includes various <b>voice</b> and image <b>compression</b> algorithms. In this work we present a complete audio compression/decompression software package, which implements an algorithm from this second class, which exploits a very popular orthogonal transform named the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), [1], [2].
