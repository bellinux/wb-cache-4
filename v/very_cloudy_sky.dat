40|$|In {{an earlier}} report (Buchbinder, Solowey and Phelps, 1941) {{it was shown}} that both {{daylight}} and sunlight after passing through a window are lethal for streptococci maintained in a simulated room environment. Tests {{of the effect of}} diffuse daylight on one short chain strain of alpha hemolytic streptococcus yielded re-producible data which indicated a geometric death rate. Similar findings were obtained with a short chain strain of Group B beta hemolytic streptococcus. Tests on a long chain strain of Group A beta hemolytic streptococcus, however, yielded non-geometric death rates during the usual one and two'hour test periods. It was calculated from the data that daylight would destroy 50 per cent of the very short chains of the alpha hemolytic strain in 45 min-utes, whereas 200 minutes would be required for the same effect on the Group A strain. This divergence in death rates, as well as the non-geometric course of death for the'Group A strain, were explained by the difference in average chain length of the two strains. It was also found that the lethal power of diffuse daylight varied with its spectral distribution and intensity. Light from clear blue skies seemed to be most effective per foot-candle, where-as that from <b>very</b> <b>cloudy</b> <b>skies</b> was least effective. However, 'light from <b>cloudy</b> <b>skies</b> on all but the grayest days had the great-est overall killing effect, evidently because of increased intensity due to reflection from the clouds. Direct sunlight (through glass), as might be expected, was much more lethal than daylight, the median survival time 2 of the strain of alpha hemolytic strepto...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIt {{has been}} {{suggested}} that atmospheric CO 2 concentration and frequency of cloud cover will increase in future. It remains unclear, however, how elevated CO 2 influences photosynthesis under complex clear versus <b>cloudy</b> <b>sky</b> conditions. Accordingly, diurnal changes in photosynthetic responses among beech trees grown at ambient (AC) and doubled (EC) CO 2 concentrations were studied under contrasting sky conditions. EC stimulated the daily sum of fixed CO 2 and light use efficiency under clear sky. Meanwhile, both these parameters were reduced under <b>cloudy</b> <b>sky</b> as compared with AC treatment. Reduction in photosynthesis rate under <b>cloudy</b> <b>sky</b> was particularly associated with EC-stimulated, xanthophyll-dependent thermal dissipation of absorbed light energy. Under clear sky, a pronounced afternoon depression of CO 2 assimilation rate was found in sun-adapted leaves under EC compared with AC conditions. This was caused in particular by stomata closure mediated by vapour pressure deficit...|$|R

40|$|Clouds can {{significantly}} affect carbon uptake of forest ecosystems by affecting incoming solar radiation on the ground, temperature {{and other environmental}} factors. In this study, we analyzed the effects of cloudiness on the net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide (NEE) of a temperate broad-leaved Korean pine mixed forest at Changbaishan (CBS) and a subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest at Dinghushan (DHS) of ChinaFLUX, based on the flux data obtained during June–August from 2003 to 2006. The {{results showed that the}} response of the NEE of forest ecosystem to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was different under clear <b>sky</b> and <b>cloudy</b> <b>sky</b> conditions, and this difference was not consistent between CBS and DHS. Compared with clear skies, light-saturated maximum photosynthetic rate (Pec,max) of CBS during mid-growing season (from June to August) was respectively enhanced by 34 %, 25 %, 4 % and 11 % on <b>cloudy</b> <b>skies</b> in 2003, 2004, 2005 and 2006; however, Pec,max of DHS was higher under clear <b>skies</b> than under <b>cloudy</b> <b>skies</b> from 2004 to 2006. NEE of forests at CBS reached its maximum when the clearness index (kt) was between 0. 4 and 0. 6, and the NEE decreased obviously when kt exceeded 0. 6. Compare with CBS, although NEE of forest at DHS tended to the maximum when kt varied between 0. 4 and 0. 6, the NEE did not decrease noticeably when kt exceeded 0. 6. The results indicated that <b>cloudy</b> <b>sky</b> conditions were more beneficial to carbon uptake for the temperate forest ecosystem rather than for the subtropical forest ecosystem. This {{is due to the fact}} that the non-saturating light conditions and increase of diffuse radiation were more beneficial to photosynthesis, and the reduced temperature was more conducive to decreasing the ecosystem respiration in temperate forest ecosystems under <b>cloudy</b> <b>sky</b> conditions. This phenomenon is important to evaluate carbon uptake of temperate forests under climate change conditions...|$|R

When combined with a physically-based light transport algorithm, our cloud illumination model accurately reproduces the highly varying anisotropic structure of a <b>cloudy</b> <b>sky.</b> In contrast to purely image-based techniques which produce static RGB illumination maps, by generating an actual cloud volume our method efficiently handles changes in sun direction, viewing angle, and cloud geometry.
