50|$|The {{concept of}} <b>Metal</b> <b>Mass</b> was thought up by five metal fans, three of whom {{worked at a}} church (pastors Haka Kekäläinen and Jukka Valkama and youth worker Mikko Saari) {{and the other two}} being musicians (Markus Korri and Juhani Palttala), after a 2005 seminar on the {{relationship}} of Church and heavy metal music. They gathered a team for service and began working on arrangements. The first <b>Metal</b> <b>Mass</b> was held {{around the time of the}} annual Tuska Open Air Metal Festival, June 29, 2006, in Temppeliaukio Church.

40|$|Aims. We {{investigate}} whether X-ray observations map heavy {{elements in the}} Intra-Cluster Medium (ICM) well and whether the X-ray observations yield good estimates for the <b>metal</b> <b>mass,</b> with respect to predictions on transport mech- anisms of heavy elements from galaxies into the ICM. We further test the accuracy of simulated metallicity maps. Methods. We extract synthetic X-ray spectra from N-body/hydrodynamic simulations including metal enrichment pro- cesses, which we then analyse with the same methods as are applied to observations. By changing the metal distribution in the simulated galaxy clusters, we investigate the dependence of the overall metallicity {{as a function of}} the metal distribution. In addition we investigate the difference of X-ray weighted metal maps produced by simulations and metal maps extracted from artifcial X-ray spectra, which we calculate with SPEX 2. 0 and analyse with XSPEC 12. 0. Results. The overall metallicity depends strongly on the distribution of metals within the galaxy cluster. The more inhomogeneously the metals are distributed within the cluster, the less accurate is the metallicity as a measure for the true <b>metal</b> <b>mass.</b> The true <b>metal</b> <b>mass</b> is generally underestimated by X-ray observations. The difference between the X-ray weighted metal maps and the metal maps from synthetic X-ray spectra is on average less than 7 % in the temperature regime above T > 3 E 7 K, i. e. X-ray weighted metal maps can be well used for comparison with observed metal maps. Extracting the <b>metal</b> <b>mass</b> in the central parts (r < 500 kpc) of galaxy clusters with X-ray observations results in <b>metal</b> <b>mass</b> underestimates up to a factor of three.

40|$|The hot {{gas that}} fills {{the space between}} galaxies in {{clusters}} is rich in metals. In their large potential wells, galaxy clusters accumulate metals over the whole cluster history and hence they retain important information on cluster formation and evolution. We use a sample of 5 cool core clusters to study the distribution of metals in the ICM. We investigate whether the X-ray observations yield good estimates for the <b>metal</b> <b>mass</b> and whether the heavy elements abundances are consistent with a certain relative fraction of SN Ia to SNCC. We derive detailed metallicity maps of the clusters from XMM - Newton observations and we use them as a measure for the <b>metal</b> <b>mass</b> in the ICM. We determine radial profiles for several elements and using population synthesis and chemical enrichment models, we study the agreement between the measured abundances and the theoretical yields. We show that even in relaxed clusters the distribution of metals show a lot of inhomogeneities. Using metal maps usually gives a <b>metal</b> <b>mass</b> 10 - 30...|$|R

Based on spatially resolved energy spectra, we measured for the first time precise cumulative ICM <b>metal</b> <b>masses</b> within 0. 1 and ~ 0. 3 r_{ 180 }. Comparing our results with supernova nucleosynthesis models, the number ratio of type II (SNe II) to type Ia (SNe Ia) is estimated to be ~ 3. 5, assuming the <b>metal</b> <b>mass</b> in the ICM is represented by the sum of products synthesized in SNe Ia and SNe II.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{simulation}} setup {{for studying the}} dynamical and chemical evolution of the intracluster medium (ICM) and analyze a sample of 12 galaxy clusters that are diverse both kinetically (pre-merger, merging, virialized) and in total mass (M vir = 1. 17 x 10 ^ 14 - 1. 06 x 10 ^ 15 M). We analyzed the <b>metal</b> <b>mass</b> fraction in the ICM {{as a function of}} redshift and discuss radial trends as well as projected 2 D metallicity maps. The setup combines high mass resolution N-body simulations with the semi-analytical galaxy formation model Galacticus for consistent treatment of the subgrid physics (such as galactic winds and ram-pressure stripping) in the cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. The interface between Galacticus and the hydro simulation of the ICM with FLASH is discussed with respect to observations of star formation rate histories, radial star formation trends in galaxy clusters, and the metallicity at different redshifts. As a test for the robustness of the wind model, we compare three prescriptions from different approaches. For the wind model directly taken from Galacticus, we find mean ICM metallicities between 0. 2 - 0. 8 Z within the inner 1 Mpc at z = 0. The main contribution to the <b>metal</b> <b>mass</b> fraction comes from galactic winds. The outflows are efficiently mixed in the ICM, leading to a steady homogenization of metallicities until ram-pressure stripping becomes effective at low redshifts. We find a very peculiar and yet common drop in <b>metal</b> <b>mass</b> fractions within the inner ~ 200 kpc of the cool cores, which is due to a combination of wind suppression by outer pressure within our model and a lack of mixing after the formation of these dense regions...|$|R

40|$|We model how {{repeated}} supernova {{explosions in}} high-redshift dwarf starburst galaxies drive superbubbles and winds {{out of the}} galaxies. We compute the efficiencies of <b>metal</b> and <b>mass</b> ejection and energy transport from the galactic potentials, including the effect of cosmological infall of external gas. The starburst bubbles quickly blow out of small, high-redshift, galactic disks, but must compete with the ram pressure of the infalling gas to escape into intergalactic space. We show that the assumed efficiency of the star formation rate dominates the bubble evolution and the <b>metal,</b> <b>mass,</b> and energy feedback efficiencies. With star formation efficiency f ∗ = 0. 01, the ram pressure of infall can confine the bubbles around high-redshift dwarf galaxies with circular velocities vc � 52 km s − 1.

40|$|A {{statistical}} {{predictive model}} {{to estimate the}} time dependence of metal loss (ML) for buried pipelines has been developed considering the {{physical and chemical properties}} of soil. The parameters for this model include pH, chloride content, caliphate content (SO), sulfide content, organic content (ORG), resistivity (RE), moisture content (WC), clay content (CC), plasticity index (PI), and particle size distribution. The power law-based time dependence of the ML was modeled as P[*]=[*]ktv, where t is the time exposure, k is the metal loss coefficient, and v is the corrosion growth pattern. The results were analyzed using statistical methods such as exploratory data analysis (EDA), single linear regression (SLR), principal component analysis (PCA), and multiple linear regression (MLR). The model revealed that chloride (CL), resistivity (RE), organic content (ORG), moisture content (WC), and pH were the most influential variables on k, while caliphate content (SO), plasticity index (PI), and clay content (CC) appear to be influential toward v. The predictive corrosion model based on data from a real site has yielded a reasonable prediction of <b>metal</b> <b>mass</b> loss, with an R 2 score of 0. 89. This research has introduced innovative ways to model the corrosion growth for an underground pipeline environment using measured metal loss from multiple pipeline installation sites.
