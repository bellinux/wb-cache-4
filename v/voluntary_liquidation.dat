Within two years the company advertised with contact addresses at 2 – 10 Albert Street in Birmingham, 5 Cross Street in Manchester and 52 Bothwell Street, Glasgow, and its main office at 9 – 15 Leonard Street, Finsbury. By 1902 advertisements show the Manchester address as 2 Charlotte Street, Mosley Street and an additional office had opened at Albion Buildings, St James' Street, Newcastle.

However, significant problems had emerged for the company, even though it remained in good financial standing. In particular, road transport was able to offer a door-to-door service, (although the company did attempt to provide something similar at Narooma), and the railways provided increased competition, entering into exclusive contracts with some hotels and taking some goods contracts away from the shipping line.

5|$|The {{cause of}} this decline was the club's ongoing {{financial}} problems; despite the boom in football during the early 20th century, the club's geographic isolation, in the relatively underpopulated area of Plumstead (then {{on the outskirts of}} urban London), meant attendances and thus income were low. To stay afloat, Woolwich Arsenal were forced to sell their star players (including Ashcroft, as well as Tim Coleman and Bert Freeman), and slowly started to slip down the table, which compounded their financial situation as crowds fell. By {{the end of the decade}} the average attendance at Manor Ground was 11,000, a little over half of what it had been in 1904. The club were close to bankruptcy, and in 1910 went into <b>voluntary</b> <b>liquidation</b> before being bought out by a consortium of businessmen; the largest shareholder amongst the new owners was the property magnate Sir Henry Norris, who was also the chairman of Fulham.|$|E

By the 1960s, the pier was suffering from serious financial difficulties. In 1965, it was bought by a company that owned some seafront hotels and entertainment venues. They had ambitions for the pier but were unable to cope with increasing maintenance costs. Some portions of wood and iron from the pier fell on the beach, and the pierhead was closed in 1970 due to safety concerns. The pier was Grade II listed in 1969 and the council served compulsory repair notices, but the company was unable to afford them and opted for <b>voluntary</b> <b>liquidation.</b> The remainder of the pier was closed in 1975 when the Brighton Corporation declined to buy it, passing control to the Crown Estate Commissioners.|$|E

This is then subjected to out-of-sample testing over the subsequent ten-year period. The results indicate that in both the short-run and the long-run, changes in the level of liquidations can be explained by two main explanatory variables namely: the nominal after-tax cost of borrowing and changes in real economic activity. In addition, confirmatory evidence is provided of the dampening effect of the 1986 Insolvency Act on the number of liquidations. The model retains its forecasting accuracy in the out-of-sample period although there is possibly some preliminary evidence of a further mitigating effect associated with the Enterprise Act 2002...|$|R

50|$|A liquidating {{distribution}} (or liquidating dividend) {{is a type}} of nondividend distribution made by {{a corporation}} or a partnership to its shareholders during its partial or complete liquidation. Liquidating distributions are not paid solely out of the profits of the corporation. Instead, the entire amount of shareholders' equity is distributed. When a company has more liabilities than assets, equity is negative and no liquidating distribution is made at all. This is usually the case in bankruptcy liquidations. Creditors are always senior to shareholders in receiving the corporation's assets upon winding up. However, in case all debts to creditors have been fully satisfied, there is a surplus left to divide among equity-holders. This mainly occurs during <b>voluntary</b> <b>liquidations</b> of solvent corporations.|$|R

40|$|South Africa has a dualistic {{system of}} {{insolvency}} law, {{which means that}} individual and corporate insolvency is dealt with in separate statutes. The {{purpose of this study}} is to propose a framework for corporate insolvency law reform, with a view to introducing a single insolvency statute in South Africa. In determining the reasons for the separate development of individual and corporate insolvency in South Africa, research is conducted into the historical development of both individual and corporate insolvency law. Although corporate insolvency is supplemented by the substantive rules of individual insolvency, the existence of separate statutes regulating individual and corporate insolvency has resulted in the separate development, and resultant fragmentation, of South African insolvency law. In determining why some countries have been more successful than others in introducing a unified insolvency statute, a brief comparative study is undertaken in respect of the insolvency regimes that apply in England, Australia, Germany and the United States. Research is then conducted into the possibility of introducing a unified insolvency statute in South Africa. Having determined that the underlying problem of a dualistic system is the fragmentation of the regulatory statutes, the remainder of the thesis is devoted to making proposals for the introduction of a unified statute. In proposing a unified insolvency statute the following critical issues are addressed: the definition of "debtor" for the purposes of a unified statute; whether a unified statute should also address the liquidation of specialised institutions such as banks; liquidation applications; the commencement of liquidation; the vesting of the insolvent estate; whether ancillary matters such as alternatives to liquidation, insolvent deceased estates, business rescue provisions, compromises, personal liability provisions and cross-border insolvencies should be included in such a statute; and revised provisions in regard to <b>voluntary</b> <b>liquidations</b> by resolution. The conclusion that is reached, is that it is in fact possible to substantially unify all the provisions relating to individual and corporate insolvency law in South Africa into a single statute. This conclusion is reached by means of a draft Insolvency and Business Recovery Bill, and is included as part of the conclusion to the thesis. Thesis (LLD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2004.

40|$|Being {{able to make}} an {{objective}} assessment of a firm’s probability of getting into distress and eventually failing is of great importance to {{a large number of}} economic agents. Because of its importance to this wide array of practitioners, {{it is not surprising that}} business failure or bankruptcy prediction is one the most extensively researched topics in the corporate finance and financial accounting literature. Although some earlier examples of academic studies and practical applications exist, the modern era of failure prediction is generally considered to have started in the 1960 s, with relatively straightforward analyses of bankruptcy likelihood for small samples of stock exchange quoted companies in the United States. Ever since, researchers have attempted to improve the performance and the validity of prediction models in various ways. One important source of improvement has been the application of more sophisticated statistical methods, from univariate tests and discriminant analysis in the 1960 s and 1970 s, over logit and probit regressions in the 1980 s and 1990 s, to the more recent hazard models and artificial intelligence techniques. Moreover, a better understanding of the potential causes of distress and failure has led to the inclusion of many new predictors, ranging from more complex accounting ratios and market variables to macroeconomic and industry-related measures and non-financial information (e. g., company ownership or managerial characteristics). Finally, due to ever-better data availability, many studies have also widened the scope of prediction in terms of the type of companies that are studied (e. g., models for private companies or SMEs), in terms of geography (in both developed and emerging markets), and in terms of the definition of failure (i. e., not only formal bankruptcy but also reorganization procedures, <b>voluntary</b> <b>liquidations,</b> and company sales). The continuous search for improvement has led to a vast and rich literature consisting of hundreds of published prediction studies. It goes without saying that this chapter can never hope to give a complete discussion of this body of work, which means that it should be read as a primer to the main insights and developments in the field and as a starting point in exploring the literature. We predominantly include studies that have been highly influential and papers published in high-quality business and economics journals.

40|$|Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SMEs) play a {{significant}} role in the Australian economy. The OECD (2000) reports that SMEs are the core to a nation’s future economic growth and account for 95 percent of enterprises and 60 to 70 percent of jobs. The existing literature on small business primarily focuses on three specific areas: SME start-up/entrepreneurship, general management of the enterprise, and SME failure. Whilst it may be an idealistic notion that businesses will grow and long outlast their founders, the reality is that most businesses have finite lives with the vast majority of Australian business start-ups ceasing to exist within fifteen years. In the Australian context there are significant studies on business cessation but little research has focussed on business exits that do not include business <b>liquidation</b> (<b>voluntary</b> or involuntary). This study deals specifically with the subject of business harvesting associated with owners who voluntarily and successfully exit their businesses. The main aim of this study was to undertake an empirical study of SME exits focussing on details of the process to identify its major stages and contributing factors. To conduct this study a research framework for business exits was developed based on the conceptual framework for managing growth and change in small businesses proposed by Joyce and Woods (2003) ...|$|R
40|$|Whilst {{it may be}} {{an idealistic}} notion that {{businesses}} will continue to grow and long outlast their founders, the reality is that most businesses have finite lives with the vast majority of Australian business start-ups ceasing to exist within fifteen years. The reasons for business expiration are essentially: failure, voluntary closure, and harvest. The nature of SMEs in Australia is that there are many start-ups and almost as many failures each year. Whilst there are significant studies on business cessation, there has been very little research focus on business exits (harvesting) that does not include business <b>liquidation</b> (<b>voluntary</b> or involuntary). The main aim of this research was to undertake an empirical study of Australian SME exits to identify the process that owners of SMEs undertake to execute a successful exit. A research framework for business exits was developed that consisted of a process with three overlapping stages: exit contemplation, exit planning, and exit execution. This study was based on an exploratory case methodology which focussed on the exit process undertaken by twelve Australian SMEs. From {{the results of the study}} the findings revealed that Australian SMEs undertake two types of exit process; one for reactive scenarios where owners responded to unsolicited offers from buyers, and proactive scenarios where owners prepare their businesses for an exit, identify potential buyers, and then execute an exit. Reactive exits are simpler and quicker to conduct than proactive exits. They are also less expensive to transact, less disruptive to their businesses, and because of their quick transaction time, pose a lower overall risk. The major management implication for exiting owners from this study is that exit preparation, not planning, is the key to achieving a successful exit. Preparation was identified to take two forms: deliberate or inadvertent. These activities contribute or build towards the business’s saleability by removing potential exit barriers and enhancing the businesses brand, potential, and profitability. For buyers of small businesses this study concludes that in cases of craftsman style owners, an exit is often not about the price. For these owners, exits coincided with waning satisfaction because of management complexity, changed lifestyle requirements, or simply, longevity...|$|R
