However, tracing a complete program unobtrusively is often cost-prohibitive, requiring large on-chip trace buffers and wide trace ports. Whereas program execution traces can be efficiently compressed in hardware, compression of data address and data value traces is much more challenging due to limited redundancy. In this paper we describe two hardwarebased filtering techniques for data traces: cache first-access tracking for load data values and data address filtering using partial register-file replay. The results of our experimental analysis indicate that the proposed filtering techniques can significantly {{reduce the size of}} the data traces (~ 5 - 20 times for the load data <b>value</b> <b>trace,</b> depending on the data cache size; and ~ 5 times for the data address trace) at the cost of rather small hardware structures in the trace module...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} spin transport in 2 -dimensional insulators, {{with the}} long-term goal of establishing {{whether any of}} the transport coefficients corresponds to the Fu-Kane-Mele index which characterizes 2 d time-reversal-symmetric topological insulators. Inspired by the Kubo theory of charge transport, and by using a proper definition of the spin current operator, we define the Kubo-like spin conductance G_K^s_z and spin conductivity σ_K^s_z. We prove that for any gapped, periodic, near-sighted discrete Hamiltonian, the above quantities are mathematically well-defined and the equality G_K^s_z = σ_K^s_z holds true. Moreover, we argue that the physically relevant condition to obtain the equality above is the vanishing of the mesoscopic average of the spin-torque response, which holds true under our hypotheses on the Hamiltonian operator. This vanishing condition might be relevant in view of further extensions of the result, e. g. to ergodic random discrete Hamiltonians or to Schrödinger operators on the continuum. A {{central role in the}} proof is played by the trace per unit volume and by two generalizations of the trace, the principal <b>value</b> <b>trace</b> and it directional version.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{laboratory testing}} {{to investigate the}} suitability of recycled construction and demolition (C&D) materials as alternative subbase materials for permeable pavements. Permeable pavements are increasingly being used as urban stormwater management systems. Three commonly found recycled C&D waste materials, crushed brick (CB), recycled concrete aggregate (RCA), and reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP), were investigated to assess their suitability as permeable pavement subbase materials. Geotextile was also used in this research to trap pollutants. The laboratory tests included basic physical characterization such as particle size distribution, specific gravity, water absorption, Los Angeles abrasion, California Bearing Ratio (CBR), and modified Proctor compaction tests. In addition, hydraulic conductivity tests were undertaken in a laboratory test setup with different influent suspension percentages and moisture contents. Temporal variations of effluent suspension percentages were investigated to assess clogging effects. It {{was found that the}} geotextile layer did not have any effect in terms of permeability of the C&D materials.

40|$|Lake Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada is {{the tenth}} largest {{freshwater}} lake worldwide and {{has one of}} the largest catchment areas of any aquatic system in Canada. Intensive agriculture, livestock production, urban development and industrialization contribute excess nutrients and contaminants to the lake. Although nutrient-driven eutrophication, establishment of invasive fishes, commercial fishing pressures and avian predation may adversely affect fish community structure and function, trophic interactions among Lake Winnipeg’s biota have not been intensely examined. Similarly, the mechanisms governing the dietary transfer of mercury (Hg) and trace elements are unknown, despite the fact elevated Hg residues in fish tissues led to a commercial fishing ban in the 1970 s. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to use a multi-stable isotope approach (δ 15 N, δ 13 C, δ 34 S and δ 2 H) to a) identify trophic interactions among fishes and piscivorous birds and b) track the dietary transfer of trace elements. An intensive field program was undertaken in 2009 and 2010. Muscle samples from fishes and Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus; hereafter “cormorant”) were examined isotopically (δ 15 N, δ 13 C and δ 34 S) and the data were used to reconstruct the lake’s food web. The effects of trophic position (TP; δ 15 N), food source (δ 13 C and δ 34 S) and organism size on concentrations of aluminum (Al), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), Hg and selenium (Se) in muscle were examined according to an information-theoretic approach. The utility of scale sampling as a non-invasive method for monitoring contaminant concentrations in fillets of commercially-valuable walleye (Sander vitreus) was also investigated. Similarly, the concerted analyses of stable isotope ratios (δ 15 N, δ 13 C, δ 34 S and δ 2 H) and Hg concentrations in cormorant flight feathers were evaluated as a non-destructive method for tracking habitat use and contaminant biotransport. Muscle of fishes and cormorants collected from Lake Winnipeg’s north basin were generally depleted in 13 C and 34 S but enriched in 15 N relative to individuals from the south basin. Stable isotopic mixing models also revealed much of the fish biomass consumed by cormorants (north basin: ≥ 59 %; south basin: ≥ 74 %) consisted of species with little or no direct commercial <b>value.</b> <b>Trace</b> element concentrations in biota were often species-specific; however the influence of TP and pelagic, benthic, or detrital nutrient sources were often evident at fine scales. Biomagnification (south basin) and bioaccumulation (north basin) of Hg were observed within the lake’s walleye populations. Fortunately, analysis of walleye scales demonstrated some utility in monitoring fillet-Hg concentrations. Mercury, as well as Cd, Fe, Mn, and Se increased with increasing TP in cormorants nesting on the north basin of Lake Winnipeg. Although the factors driving contaminant concentrations in cormorant muscle differed spatially, concentrations of Cd, Hg and Se in muscle did not differ among adult and hatch-year cormorants, or by nesting location. Measurements of stable isotopes (δ 15 N, δ 13 C, δ 34 S and δ 2 H) and Hg in primary feathers revealed cormorants accumulated more Hg from Lake Winnipeg than from winter habitats. This study is the first to demonstrate the utility of a multi-isotope approach in describing Hg and trace element trophodynamics for the Lake Winnipeg food web. The lake’s north and south basins appeared to differ in terms of trophic structure and the mechanisms underlying contaminant transfer. Mercury may be the element of greatest concern for Lake Winnipeg, as biomagnification, bioaccumulation and biotransport of this toxic element have been demonstrated...|$|E

There are many iterative reconstruction algorithms that perform different computations in forward and backprojection stages. These computations typically result in different l_i and w_i <b>values.</b> <b>Trace</b> provides an API that makes it easy for developers to implement their algorithms for forward and backprojection kernels.

During step 2, Trace runtime system automatically applies the user-selected (or user-implemented) Reduce(...) function to the l_i and w_i arrays. Trace uses a wrapper data structure called replicated reconstruction object (replica) for the management of l_i and w_i.

This parallelization technique also lets Trace scale up to the number of ray-sum values in input dataset; therefore, it provides fine-grained reconstruction. On the other hand, since each thread requires a private replica, memory utilization can be high which may limit the level of parallelization.|$|R
