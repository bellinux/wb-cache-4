5|$|Glasses {{and certain}} types of {{plastics}} are commonly welded materials. Unlike metals, which have a specific melting point, glasses and plastics have a melting range, called the glass transition. When heating the solid material into this range, it will generally become softer and more pliable. When it crosses through the glass transition, {{it will become a}} very thick, sluggish, <b>viscous</b> <b>liquid.</b> Typically, this <b>viscous</b> <b>liquid</b> will have very little surface tension, becoming a sticky, honey-like consistency, so welding can usually take place by simply pressing two melted surfaces together. The two liquids will generally mix and join at first contact. Upon cooling through the glass transition, the welded piece will solidify as one solid piece of amorphous material.|$|E
5|$|In {{mammalian}} cells, {{the average}} {{diameter of the}} nucleus is approximately 6 micrometres (µm), which occupies about 10% of the total cell volume. The <b>viscous</b> <b>liquid</b> within it is called nucleoplasm (or karyolymph), and is similar in composition to the cytosol found outside the nucleus. It appears as a dense, roughly spherical or irregular organelle. The composition by dry weight of the nucleus is approximately: DNA 9%, RNA 1%, Histone Protein 11%, Residual Protein 14%, Acidic Proteins 65%.|$|E
5|$|Thermoplastics, by contrast, form long {{molecular}} chains, {{which are}} often coiled or intertwined, forming an amorphous structure without any long-range, crystalline order. Some thermoplastics may be fully amorphous, while others have a partially crystalline/partially amorphous structure. Both amorphous and semicrystalline thermoplastics have a glass transition, above which welding can occur, but semicrystallines also have a specific melting point which is above the glass transition. Above this melting point, the <b>viscous</b> <b>liquid</b> will become a free-flowing liquid (see rheological weldability for thermoplastics). Examples of thermoplastics include polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinylchloride (PVC), and fluoroplastics like Teflon and Spectralon.|$|E

5|$|The larvae are {{generally}} whitish grubs, roughly oval and bluntly-pointed at both ends. They have fifteen segments and spiracles in each segment for breathing. They have no legs but {{are able to}} move {{within the confines of}} the cell, helped by tubercles on their sides. They have short horns on the head, jaws for chewing their food and an appendage on either side of the mouth tipped with a bristle. There is a gland under the mouth that secretes a <b>viscous</b> <b>liquid</b> which solidifies into the silk they use to produce their cocoons. The pupa can be seen through the semi-transparent cocoon and over the course of a few days, the insect undergoes metamorphosis into the form of the adult bee. When ready to emerge, it splits its skin dorsally and climbs out of the exuviae as a winged adult and breaks out of the cell.|$|E
5|$|Welding {{thermoplastic}} is {{very similar}} to welding glass. The plastic first must be cleaned and then heated through the glass transition, turning the weld-interface into a thick, <b>viscous</b> <b>liquid.</b> Two heated interfaces can then be pressed together, allowing the molecules to mix through intermolecular diffusion, joining them as one. Then the plastic is cooled through the glass transition, allowing the weld to solidify. A filler rod may often be used for certain types of joints. The main differences between welding glass and plastic are the types of heating methods, the much lower melting temperatures, and the fact that plastics will burn if overheated. Many different methods have been devised for heating plastic to a weldable temperature without burning it. Ovens or electric heating tools can be used to melt the plastic. Ultrasonic, laser, or friction heating are other methods. Resistive metals may be implanted in the plastic, which respond to induction heating. Some plastics will begin to burn at temperatures lower than their glass transition, so welding can be performed by blowing a heated, inert gas onto the plastic, melting it while, at the same time, shielding it from oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Some frogs {{protect their}} {{offspring}} inside their own bodies. Both {{male and female}} pouched frogs (Assa darlingtoni) guard their eggs, which are laid on the ground. When the eggs hatch, the male lubricates his body with the jelly surrounding them and immerses himself in the egg mass. The tadpoles wriggle into skin pouches on his side, where they develop until they metamorphose into juvenile frogs. The female gastric-brooding frog (Rheobatrachus sp.) from Australia, now probably extinct, swallows her fertilized eggs, which then develop inside her stomach. She ceases to feed and stops secreting stomach acid. The tadpoles rely on the yolks of the eggs for nourishment. After six or seven weeks, they are ready for metamorphosis. The mother regurgitates the tiny frogs, which hop away from her mouth. The female Darwin's frog (Rhinoderma darwinii) from Chile lays up to 40 eggs on the ground, where they are guarded by the male. When the tadpoles are about to hatch, they are engulfed by the male, which carries them around inside his much-enlarged vocal sac. Here they are immersed in a frothy, <b>viscous</b> <b>liquid</b> that contains some nourishment to supplement what they obtain from the yolks of the eggs. They remain in the sac for seven to ten weeks before undergoing metamorphosis, after which they move into the male's mouth and emerge.|$|E

The {{internal}} structure is complex, {{consisting of a}} mass of curled or folded fibre embedded in a viscid matrix which is in turn surrounded by a less viscous layer. This results in the low viscosity liquid flowing past the moth's scales to reach the cuticle below, while the more <b>viscous</b> <b>liquid</b> forms a bond to the thread to sustain the moth's weight.

If it is an expansive soil, this soil will also begin to swell in volume as this moisture content is exceeded. Increasing the water content beyond the soil's plastic limit will transform it into a malleable, plastic mass, which causes additional swelling. The soil will remain in this plastic state until its liquid limit is exceeded, which causes it to transform into a <b>viscous</b> <b>liquid</b> that flows when jarred.|$|E

The necrotic liquid mass is frequently creamy yellow due to the presence of dead leukocytes and is commonly known as pus.

25|$|Gas {{chromatography}} {{is based}} on a partition equilibrium of analyte between a solid or <b>viscous</b> <b>liquid</b> stationary phase (often a liquid silicone-based material) and a mobile gas (most often helium). The stationary phase is adhered to the inside of a small-diameter (commonly 0.53 – 0.18mm inside diameter) glass or fused-silica tube (a capillary column) or a solid matrix inside a larger metal tube (a packed column). It is widely used in analytical chemistry; though the high temperatures used in GC make it unsuitable for high molecular weight biopolymers or proteins (heat denatures them), frequently encountered in biochemistry, it is well suited for use in the petrochemical, environmental monitoring and remediation, and industrial chemical fields. It is also used extensively in chemistry research.|$|E
25|$|Researchers at the University of Nice in France {{have been}} {{studying}} a tiny aquatic slug which is a natural predator of C. taxifolia.

This slug is believed to feed exclusively on C. taxifolia, by sticking its proboscis into the stem and sucking out the white <b>viscous</b> <b>liquid</b> inside the stem: this causes the alga to become limp, discolored, and dead. As the slug does so, it absorbs the alga's poison. The slug has an enzyme which neutralizes the noxious effect of the poison, and at the same time, the poison protects the slug from being eaten by fish. However, this slug cannot survive in the cooler waters of the Mediterranean and, therefore, is unable to control the invasive alga there.|$|E
