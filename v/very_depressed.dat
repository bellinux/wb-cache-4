5|$|Potter {{continued}} to publish children's books with Warnes and used her sales profits {{and a small}} legacy from an aunt to buy Hill Top, a working farm of 34 acres (13.85ha) in the Lake District in July 1905. On 25 August, Potter's fiancé and editor Norman Warne died suddenly; she became <b>very</b> <b>depressed</b> and was ill for many weeks, but rallied to complete the last few tales she had planned or discussed with him.|$|E
5|$|In 1901, Riley's doctor {{diagnosed}} {{him with}} neurasthenia, a nervous disorder, and recommended {{long periods of}} rest as a cure. Riley remained ill {{for the rest of}} his life and relied on his landlords and family to aid in his care. During the winter months he moved to Miami, Florida, and during summer spent time with his family in Greenfield. He made only a few trips during the decade, including one to Mexico in 1906. He became <b>very</b> <b>depressed</b> by his condition, writing to his friends that he thought he could die at any moment, and often used alcohol for relief.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, {{during his}} years in Berlin, Lagrange's health was rather poor on many occasions, {{and that of his}} wife Vittoria was even worse. She died in 1783 after years of illness and Lagrange was <b>very</b> <b>depressed.</b> In 1786, Frederick II died, and the climate of Berlin became rather trying for Lagrange.|$|E

25|$|During {{his last}} years, he {{appeared}} in his second Irwin Allen film, When Time Ran Out, a critical and commercial failure and heavily disliked by Holden himself. Blake Edwards' S.O.B., was more successful. In 1981, Holden was offered the role of Coach Daniel B. Delaney in That Championship Season. He became <b>very</b> <b>depressed</b> when filming was delayed, and drank even more heavily.|$|E
25|$|Most hamsters are {{strictly}} solitary. If housed together, acute and chronic stress may occur, {{and they may}} fight fiercely, sometimes fatally. Dwarf hamster species may tolerate conspecifics. Russian hamsters form close, monogamous bonds with their mates, and if separated, they may become <b>very</b> <b>depressed.</b> This happens especially in males. Males will become inactive, eat more, and even show some behavioral changes similar to some types of depression in humans. This can even cause obesity in the hamster.|$|E
25|$|From January 1978 {{until the}} early 1990s Genie moved {{through a series of}} at least four {{additional}} foster homes and institutions, some of which subjected her to extreme physical abuse and harassment. Shurley saw her at her 27th birthday party, in 1984, and again two years later, and in an interview years later he said that both times she was <b>very</b> <b>depressed</b> and uncommunicative. In 1992, Curtiss told Russ Rymer that the only two updates she had heard on Genie indicated she barely spoke and was depressed and withdrawn. When Rymer published a two-part magazine article on Genie in The New Yorker in April of that year he wrote that she lived in an institution and only saw her mother one weekend every month, as did the first edition of his 1993 book, entitled Genie: A Scientific Tragedy. The afterword of the 1994 edition of Rymer's book on Genie, written in November 1993, detailed conversations he had with Genie's mother—who had since gone blind again due to glaucoma—just before and after the publication of his magazine articles. At that time she told him that Genie had recently moved into a more supportive foster home which permitted regular visits, and said that Genie was happy and, although hard to understand, was significantly more verbal.|$|E

5000|$|Fawley is the {{inspiration}} for [...] "Marygreen" [...] of Thomas Hardy's Jude the Obscure. Jude's surname was Fawley, and he set the novel there {{because it was the}} home of Hardy's grandmother, who had a <b>very</b> <b>depressing</b> childhood. The house in which she lived is now called Jude Cottage.|$|R
25|$|Gay actor Martin Kurath (Prochnow) who is {{in prison}} {{develops}} a friendship with Thomas Manzoni (Hannawald), the 15-year-old son of the prison warden (Lüönd). The two {{fall in love and}} they both yearn for Kurath's release. This triggers intense indignation in their surroundings. After Kurath is released a year later, Thomas accompanied by Kurath, tells his parents he is a homosexual. His father tells him to leave and never return. Kurath and Thomas move in together and Thomas enrolls in school. Thomas' father, however, then has him arrested and condemned to a brutal reformatory. Kurath obtains a fake passport and poses as a psychology doctoral candidate and helps Thomas escape with him to Germany. They are betrayed by a German homosexual friend of Kurath's who insists, in Kurath's absence, that Thomas become his lover in order to obtain a German residency permit. Thomas does so, but then refuses to sleep with the betrayer, is kicked out and prostitutes himself. Broken by these experiences, he voluntarily returns to the reformatory. When he reaches 21 and is released, he is so psychologically damaged that, despite reunion with Kurath, he attempts suicide and is committed to a psychiatric hospital. He escapes and the film ends with a TV announcement that the police are looking for him and that the public should, if approaching him, treat him gently, as he is <b>very</b> <b>depressed</b> and confused.|$|E
25|$|Willow meets stoic Oz in {{the second}} season. Their {{courtship}} is slow and patient. Oz is bitten by a werewolf, and just as Willow begins to confront him about why he does not spend time with her, he transforms and attacks her. She must shoot him with a tranquilizer gun several times while he is wild, but her assertiveness in doing so makes her more confident in their relationship. Oz's trials in dealing with a power he cannot control is, according to authors J. Michael Richardson and J. Douglas Rabb, a model for Willow to reference when she encounters her own attraction to evil. When Willow and Oz decide to commit to each other, Willow is enthusiastic {{that she has a}} boyfriend, and, as a guitarist in a band, one so cool. Her relationship with Oz endures the high school storylines of exploring her attraction to Xander, which briefly separates them. She worries that she is not as close to Oz as she could be. They stay together through graduation into college, but Oz is drawn to Veruca, another werewolf. He admits an animal attraction to Veruca, which he does not share with Willow. He sleeps with Veruca and leaves shortly after to explore the werewolf part of himself. Willow becomes <b>very</b> <b>depressed</b> and doubts herself. She drinks, her magical abilities are compromised, her spells come out wrong, and she lashes out at her friends when they suggest she get over it ("Something Blue").|$|E

"My mom {{called me}} and I was <b>very</b> <b>depressed.</b> I was on tour and I couldn't leave, so I went into the studio and I wrote this song 'Speechless,' and it's about these phone calls.

60|$|But {{the teller}} {{of the comic}} story does not slur the nub; he shouts it at you--every time. And when he prints it, in England, France, Germany, and Italy, he italicizes it, puts some {{whooping}} exclamation-points after it, and sometimes explains it in a parenthesis. All of which is <b>very</b> <b>depressing,</b> and makes one want to renounce joking and lead a better life.|$|R
500|$|Around 1907, Caion's {{paper was}} hosting poems {{by the young}} Symbolist author George Bacovia (including [...] "Sonnet" [...] and [...] "Pulvis") and art chronicles by Theodor Cornel. Bacovia {{described}} their first encounter, in November 1903, as follows: [...] "Caion [...] was <b>very</b> <b>depressed</b> after his recently completed trial with Caragiale. My solitary presence, without any sort of recommendation from another author, made him receive me with significant reserve. I then communicated the purpose of my arrival, asking for the address of his collaborator, the poet Macedonski. Nevertheless, he still asked me {{for a handful of}} poems, the ones later published by his magazine." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{wandered the}} boulevards alone, and spent what little {{money he had}} on alcohol. A series of {{embarrassing}} encounters with English visitors, or Frenchmen he had known in better days, drowned his spirit. Soon Wilde was sufficiently confined to his hotel to joke, {{on one of his}} final trips outside, [...] "My wallpaper and I are fighting a duel to the death. One of us has got to go." [...] On 12 October 1900 he sent a telegram to Ross: [...] "Terribly weak. Please come." [...] His moods fluctuated; Max Beerbohm relates how their mutual friend Reginald 'Reggie' Turner had found Wilde <b>very</b> <b>depressed</b> after a nightmare. [...] "I dreamt that I had died, and was supping with the dead!" [...] "I am sure", Turner replied, [...] "that you must have been the life and soul of the party." [...] Turner was {{one of the very few}} of the old circle who remained with Wilde right to the end, and was at his bedside when he died.|$|E
500|$|After English {{actor and}} comedian Russell Brand {{divorced}} Perry in late December 2011, {{she was so}} distraught over the event that she considered committing suicide. Greg Wells, who assisted Perry with the composition of [...] "By the Grace of God", commented on the situation: [...] "I think she felt so kicked {{in the head and}} so publicly embarrassed at being divorced by a text message". After overcoming her suicidal thoughts and initial shock, she felt prompted to create a [...] "darker" [...] project as compared to her previous albums. Instead, she channelled the entire divorce event into [...] "By the Grace of God", in which its lyrics depict Perry battling against her suicidal thoughts while lying on her bathroom floor. During an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Perry spoke on how she felt during the breakup: [...] "Imagine what you go through. Imagine what happens when you go through a break up. We all go through break ups and we all get <b>very</b> <b>depressed</b> and desperate." ...|$|E

5000|$|Many {{critics have}} {{also noted that}} Allison's music often focuses on <b>very</b> <b>depressing</b> topics.

I have really good experiences performing live, with people really responding." ...|$|R
500|$|Kurt Vonnegut has {{inspired}} numerous posthumous tributes and works. In 2008, the Kurt Vonnegut Society was established, and in November 2010, the Kurt Vonnegut Memorial Library was opened in Vonnegut's hometown of Indianapolis. The Library of America published {{a compendium of}} Vonnegut's compositions between 1963 and 1973 the following April, and another compendium of his earlier works in 2012. Late 2011 saw the release of two Vonnegut biographies, Gregory Sumner's Unstuck in Time and Charles J. Shields's And So It Goes. Shields's biography of Vonnegut created some controversy. According to The Guardian, the book portrays Vonnegut as distant, cruel and nasty. [...] "Cruel, nasty and scary are the adjectives commonly used to describe him by the friends, colleagues, and relatives Shields quotes", said The Daily Beasts Wendy Smith. [...] "Towards the end he was very feeble, <b>very</b> <b>depressed</b> and almost morose", said Jerome Klinkowitz of the University of Northern Iowa, who has examined Vonnegut in depth.|$|E
500|$|In 1819, {{the group}} moved to Rome, where Mary and Percy Shelley's son William died. Mary Shelley had now lost {{all three of}} her {{children}} and was <b>very</b> <b>depressed.</b> Claire became increasingly concerned about Allegra, as Byron refused {{to allow her to}} see their daughter or reveal where she was. Mary, however, became pregnant again, with Percy Florence, and the group traveled from Rome to Pisa and Florence. En route, they became friends with a couple who helped and inspired them: Lady Mountcashell, who as Margaret King had been an eager pupil of Mary Shelley's mother, Mary Wollstonecraft; and George William Tighe, the agricultural theorist for whom she had left her husband and children. Both were poets and, like the Shelleys, were republicans and freethinkers. Lady Mountcashell referred to herself as [...] "Mrs. Mason" [...] after a character from Wollstonecraft's own children's story Original Stories from Real Life (1788). The couple had two children, Anna Laura Georgiana (called Laurette) and Nerina, who quickly became attached to Mary and Claire.|$|E
500|$|In 1983, Nettles had an eye surgically removed as {{a result}} of cancer {{diagnosed}} several years earlier. She lived for two more years, dying in 1985. Applewhite told their followers that she had [...] "traveled to the Next Level" [...] because she had [...] "too much energy to remain on Earth", abandoning her body to make the journey. His attempt to explain her death in the terms of the group's doctrine was successful, preventing the departure of all but one member. Applewhite became <b>very</b> <b>depressed.</b> He claimed that Nettles still communicated with him, but he suffered from a crisis of faith. His students supported him during this time, greatly encouraging him. He then organized a ceremony in which he symbolically married his followers; Lalich views this as an attempt to ensure unity. Applewhite told his followers that he had been left behind by Nettles because he still had more to learn—he felt that she occupied [...] "a higher spiritual role" [...] than he did. He began identifying her as [...] "the Father" [...] and often referred to her with male pronouns.|$|E

They lived in Cracow, where Czajkowski finished his final year of studies at the very reputable Jagiellonian University. Less than a year into {{his career as a}} doctor, Czajkowski decided to give it up because, as he put it, [...] "Being a doctor is <b>very</b> <b>depressing.</b> You're always surrounded by sick people." [...] He decided to, instead, become a full-time fencing coach.|$|R
5000|$|The album's lyrical content {{frequently}} focuses upon {{life as a}} touring {{musician and}} the nature of songwriting, with Kozelek stating, [...] "When you're a touring musician, you're always turning over new rocks and there's always a certain level of tension in your life. The music business, and the travel that comes with it, is stressful, challenging, redundant, exhausting, exciting, and often <b>very</b> <b>depressing.</b> After all of these years, I'm still trying to cope with aspects of it." ...|$|R
500|$|Other {{family members}} were also {{reportedly}} followed and harassed by government officials. Protestors converged outside the hospital where Feng was staying, carrying a banner that read [...] "severely beat the traitors and expel them." [...] Local media reported that the local government had organized the protest. [...] About a dozen guards patrolled outside Feng's hospital room for two weeks, following family members wherever they went. [...] "We feel like prisoners," [...] remarked Deng Jicai. [...] Supporters of the family allege that local officials were also engaged in an online smear campaign against the family. [...] "The whole family feels <b>very</b> <b>depressed</b> and pressured," [...] said Jicai. [...] On June 26, a visiting family member had their tires slashed. [...] A spokesperson for the Shaanxi provincial government called the allegations of harassment unfounded rumors. [...] However, Liang Zhongtang, an independent researcher, said it was common for people who seek outside help to be harassed by local governments. He speculated that the township government was trying to prevent further {{media coverage of the}} case. [...] On July 13, Jiyuan said that he remained concerned over his family's future safety, noting: [...] "There are rumors on the street that after this thing calms down, when people are not paying attention to us anymore, they [...] will kill my family." ...|$|E
500|$|To create {{tracks on}} Let the Blind Lead, Cox {{continually}} adds elements to a song until he [...] "feel like it's getting crowded…When it sounds done, it's done. And {{if it seems}} like it's missing something, I'll go back and add something." [...] Most of his music {{is the product of}} several hours' work, rather than that of a few days. [...] To Pitchfork Media Cox said that, with each song, [...] "The genesis is usually a beat." [...] Cox considers the music of Let the Blind Lead to have a [...] "dynamic arc": {{the first half of the}} record contains [...] "more accessible songs. I was <b>very</b> <b>depressed</b> in the middle, and it created this kind of black hole of misery. Then I tried to bring it up again at the end." [...] Cox intended for his music to be [...] "therapeutic", for both himself and his audience. [...] In addition, he wanted the album to have a healing element, and be something [...] "somebody could listen to all the way through and feel like they went through a bad period of time and came out of it." [...] Pauline Oliveros, a composer who runs an organization that studies music therapy, was described by Cox as having [...] "a big influence" [...] on him and his ideas of therapeutic music. [...] He considers music [...] "the only art form I know of that has such an immediate effect on the human psyche", and found the time he first met and talked with Oliveros as being [...] "like meeting a hero of mine." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's first song, [...] "Tired of Sex", {{written before}} {{the release of}} the Blue Album, has Cuomo {{describing}} meaningless sex encounters with groupies, reciting his list of encounters and wondering why true love eludes him. [...] "Across the Sea" [...] was inspired by a letter Cuomo received from a Japanese fan: [...] "When I got the letter, I fell in love with her. It was such a great letter. I was very lonely at the time, {{but at the same time}} I was <b>very</b> <b>depressed</b> that I would never meet her." [...] Second single [...] "The Good Life" [...] chronicles the rebirth of Cuomo after an identity crisis as an Ivy League loner. Cuomo, who felt isolated at Harvard, wrote the song after [...] "becoming frustrated with that hermit's life I was leading, the ascetic life. And I think I was starting to become frustrated with my whole dream about purifying myself and trying to live like a monk or an intellectual and going to school and holding out for this perfect, ideal woman. And so I wrote the song. And I started to turn around and come back the other way." [...] Lead single [...] "El Scorcho" [...] addresses Cuomo's shyness and inability to approach a girl while at Harvard; he explained that the song [...] "is more about me, because at that point I hadn't even talked to the girl, I didn't really know much about her." [...] The album's final single, [...] "Pink Triangle", describes a man who falls in love and wants to get married, but discovers the object of his devotion is a lesbian.|$|E
