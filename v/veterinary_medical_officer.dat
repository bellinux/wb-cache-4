Formerly, unless prohibited by a Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) <b>veterinary</b> <b>medical</b> <b>officer,</b> carcasses of BSE sampled animals were allowed to be stamped inspected and passed, and packing plants were allowed to process them for human food before the sample results were received.|$|E

[...] Since 2006, the USDA has used gas chromatography/mass spectrometry to identify chemicals found on horses' legs at events. Samples of suspicious substances are swabbed at the show, and sent to a laboratory for analysis; owners and trainers are later informed of the results. [...] However, this method is only used by APHIS <b>veterinary</b> <b>medical</b> <b>officers</b> at present.|$|R

The HPA, created specifically to stop such practices and to monitor the Tennessee Walking Horse in particular, prohibits the use of soring agents. The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), part of the USDA, is working with the industry to enforce the law. Tennessee Walking Horse organizations send designated qualified persons (DQPs) to shows to inspect the horses, and, as funding permits, APHIS sends federally employed <b>veterinary</b> <b>medical</b> <b>officers</b> to work with DQPs at some shows.|$|R

500|$|The showing, {{exhibition}} {{and sale of}} Tennessee Walking Horses and some other horse breeds is governed by the Horse Protection Act of 1970 (HPA) due to concerns about the practice of soring, which developed during the 1950s and became widespread in the 1960s, resulting in a public outcry. Congress passed the Horse Protection Act in 1970, declaring the practice [...] "cruel and inhumane". The Act prohibits anyone from entering a sored horse into a show, sale, auction or exhibition, and prohibits drivers from transporting sored horses to a sale or show. Congress delegated statutory responsibility for enforcement to the management of sales and horse shows, but placed administration of the act with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Violations of the HPA may result in criminal charges, fines and prison sentences. The USDA certifies certain Horse Industry Organizations (HIOs) to train and license Designated Qualified Persons (DQPs) to complete inspections. APHIS inspection teams, which include inspectors, investigators, and <b>veterinary</b> <b>medical</b> <b>officers,</b> also conduct unannounced inspections of some horse shows, and {{have the authority to}} revoke the license of a DQP who does not follow the standards of the Act.|$|R

LarsonVeterinary Services, {{a branch}} of Animal Plant Health Inspections Services, has the {{responsibility}} to protect our nation’s animals and animal products through disease control and eradication programs, surveillance and monitoring. During {{the course of my}} experience working with Veterinary Services, I learned about program diseases and the different ways <b>veterinary</b> <b>medical</b> field <b>officers</b> and epidemiologists work together to control, monitor and survey these diseases. Veterinary Services has been working to eliminate bovine tuberculosis in the United States since the early 1900 ’s. The Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Program has been largely successful but tuberculosis keeps resurfacing in pockets around the U. S. leading to the conclusion that there must be a wildlife reservoir. Mycobacterium bovis is the cause of bovine tuberculosis and is considered a zoonotic pathogen. M. bovis has been reported to infect a wide range of host species including cattle, goats, sheep, pigs, cats, dogs, bison, badgers, possums, antelopes, elephants, seals, and humans(1). Through my experiences working with Veterinary Services, I was able to learn about the bovine tuberculosis eradication program and to explore different avenues in which M. bovis could be transmitted to humans. My report discusses the potential pathways for M. bovis zoonotic transmission to humans and my experiences working with Veterinary Services...|$|R
