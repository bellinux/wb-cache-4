5|$|The Engineering Department had no {{mandate to}} archive the {{programme}} videotapes they held, although typically {{they would not}} be wiped or junked until the relevant production department or BBC Enterprises indicated that they had no further use for the tapes. The first Doctor Who master videotapes to be junked were those for the serial The Highlanders, which were erased on 9 March 1967, a mere two months after Episode 4's original transmission. Further erasing and junking of Doctor Who master videotapes by the Engineering Department continued into the 1970s. Eventually, every master <b>videotape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> programme's first 253 episodes (1963–69) was destroyed or wiped. The final 1960s master tapes to be erased were those for the 1968 serial Fury from the Deep, in late 1974.|$|E

25|$|The defense {{strategy}} for the other two suspects was to attack the prosecution on a wide front.

500|$|Thompson filed {{a lawsuit}} {{on behalf of the}} parents of three {{children}} killed in the Heath High School shooting in 1997.

Carneal had also owned a <b>videotape</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Basketball Diaries, which includes a high school student dreaming about shooting his teacher and some classmates. The suit sought $33 million in damages, alleging that the producers of the games, the movie, and the operators of the Internet sites were negligent in distributing this material to a minor because it would desensitize him and make him more prone to violence. Additional claims included product liability for making [...] "defective" [...] products (the defects alleged were violent features and lack of warnings) and violation of RICO, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, for distributing this material to minors. Said Thompson, [...] "We intend to hurt Hollywood. We intend to hurt the video game industry. We intend to hurt the sex porn sites." ...|$|E

The ball was auctioned by Leland's Auction in 2000 for $551,844, which was the then-third highest sports memorabilia auction price. After controversy over the ball's authenticity, the sale was suspended. The ball was relisted months later and sold for only $67,791. Attles contends that Chamberlain gave him the actual 100-point ball. In 2014, [...] Josh Pastner, then head coach of the Memphis Tigers, stated that his father, who was a ballboy for the Warriors, had taped the game starting in the second quarter.

500|$|On July 8, 2006, Lonsdale {{got into}} a {{physical}} altercation with a Scientologist while filming the Church of Scientology in Clearwater. A spokeswoman for the Church of Scientology told Bay News 9 that Lonsdale had been harassing their staff members, and that the fight {{was not related to}} the church. Lonsdale stated [...] "Basically, I'm filming a pseudo-documentary for one of our free-access Pinellas web channels," [...] and said that while filming a Scientologist came out of a coffee shop and yelled that Lonsdale was a religious bigot. Lonsdale stated [...] "I picked up the camera again and started filming him ... He went right for my face and my head, backed me up into a pole to which I had no other choice but to defend myself." [...] The Scientologist was arrested by Clearwater police and charged with battery, but the State Attorney's Office of Florida decided not to pursue charges. After the incident the Clearwater police Deputy Chief viewed a <b>videotape</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> altercation, and concluded that Lonsdale was the victim and that his police officers made the right decision in arresting the Scientologist. After viewing the videotape, the Assistant State Attorney stated [...] "it is just {{not going to be a}} prosecutable case," [...] and said that the video shows [...] "pretty much mutual aggression" [...] between Lonsdale and the Scientologist. The Assistant State Attorney stated that the video showed aggression on both sides, and that Lonsdale's criticism of Scientology on the internet made the case [...] "unprosecutable". Lonsdale's attorney Luke Lirot stated [...] "It is another example of the State Attorney's Office's historical reluctance to tangle with Scientology." [...] Scientology spokeswoman Pat Harney said that church members had been told to avoid Lonsdale, and told the St. Petersburg Times that Scientologists had complained to police that they felt Lonsdale was stalking them. The police did not charge Lonsdale, stating that he had the right to take photos and video in public places.|$|E
