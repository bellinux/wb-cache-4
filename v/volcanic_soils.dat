5|$|Maraba's coffee {{plants are}} the Bourbon {{variety of the}} Coffea arabica species and are grown on fertile <b>volcanic</b> <b>soils</b> on high-altitude hills. The fruit is handpicked, mostly {{during the rainy season}} between March and May, and brought to a washing station in Maraba, where the coffee beans are {{extracted}} and dried. At several stages, the beans are sorted according to quality. The farmers receive credits based on the amount and quality of the beans they provide.|$|E
5|$|Maraba {{coffee is}} {{grown in the}} south of Rwanda at {{coordinates}} , roughly 12kilometres (7mi) from Butare and 150kilometres (93mi) from the capital, Kigali. The project began in the Maraba District of Butare Province, but these entities were replaced under local government organisation in 2006, and the area is now part of Huye District in the Southern Province. The area is very hilly, due to its proximity to the Western Rift Valley and the montane Nyungwe Forest, and features rich <b>volcanic</b> <b>soils.</b> The coffee is grown at altitudes between 1,700 and 2,100 metres (5,577–6,889ft) above sea level, often on steep hillsides with terrace farming. The area experiences an average of 115centimetres (45in) of rainfall annually. The majority of this falls during the rainy season of March to May, the major coffee harvesting season. The high altitude lowers the temperature slightly to an average of about 20 °C (68 °F). There is little seasonal variation.|$|E
5|$|Subsistence crops {{grown in}} the country include matoke (green bananas), which occupy {{more than a third}} of the country's farmland, potatoes, beans, sweet potatoes, cassava, wheat and maize. Coffee and tea are the major cash crops for export, with the high altitudes, steep slopes and <b>volcanic</b> <b>soils</b> {{providing}} favourable conditions. Reports, have established that more than 400,000 Rwandans, make their living from coffee plantation. Reliance on agricultural exports makes Rwanda vulnerable to shifts in their prices. Animals raised in Rwanda include cows, goats, sheep, pigs, chicken, and rabbits, with geographical variation in the numbers of each. Production systems are mostly traditional, although there are a few intensive dairy farms around Kigali. Shortages of land and water, insufficient and poor-quality feed, and regular disease epidemics with insufficient veterinary services are major constraints that restrict output. Fishing takes place on the country's lakes, but stocks are very depleted, and live fish are being imported in an attempt to revive the industry.|$|E

25|$|Irrigation in Guatemala is {{concentrated}} in three regions of the country. The Atlantic coast region has low humidity and high evapotranspiration so irrigation is needed for the cultivation of bananas, tomatoes, watermelon, and tobacco. The high plains region has very little rain {{for much of the}} year and with fertile <b>volcanic</b> <b>soils</b> that do not retain moisture very well. Without irrigation, there is only one harvest per year so crops such as basic grains require irrigation. The lower coastal zones have irrigated sugarcane and banana plantations.|$|E
25|$|Mount Etna {{is one of}} {{the most}} active volcanoes in the world and is in an almost {{constant}} state of activity. The fertile <b>volcanic</b> <b>soils</b> support extensive agriculture, with vineyards and orchards spread across the lower slopes of the mountain and the broad Plain of Catania to the south. Due to its history of recent activity and nearby population, Mount Etna has been designated a Decade Volcano by the United Nations. In June 2013, it was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.|$|E

25|$|The {{religious}} {{festival of}} Corpus Christi is particularly important, and is traditionally celebrated with floral carpets {{laid in the}} streets. Particularly noteworthy are the celebrations in La Orotava where a very large carpet, or tapestry, of different coloured <b>volcanic</b> <b>soils,</b> covers the Plaza del Ayuntamiento (town square). These soils are taken from the Parque Nacional del Teide, and after the celebration, are returned, to preserve the National Park. The celebration of Corpus Christi in Orotava has been declared of Important Cultural Interest among the official Traditional Activities of the Island.|$|E
25|$|Most Nepenthes species grow in {{environments that}} provide high {{humidity}} and precipitation and moderate to high light levels. A few species, including N.ampullaria, prefer the dense, shaded forests, but most other species thrive {{on the margins}} of tree/shrub communities or clearings. Some species (e.g. N.mirabilis) have been found growing in clear-cut forest areas, roadsides, and disturbed fields. Other species have adapted to growing in savanna-like grass communities. The soils in which Nepenthes species grow are usually acidic and low in nutrients, being composed of peat, white sand, sandstone, or <b>volcanic</b> <b>soils.</b> Exceptions to these generalities include species that thrive in soils with high heavy metal content (e.g. N.rajah), on sandy beaches in the sea spray zone (e.g. N.albomarginata). Other species grow on inselbergs and as lithophytes, while others, such as N.inermis, can grow as epiphytes with no soil contact.|$|E
25|$|Twomey’s Calistoga Estate Vineyard, {{surrounding}} the Calistoga Winery, and Healdsburg Estate Vineyard, on the Healdsburg winery property, are planted with Sauvignon Blanc. Their sources of fruit for their Merlot, Pinot noir and Sauvignon blanc wines come from estate-owned vineyards in the Napa, Russian River and Anderson Valleys, and from independent partner growers {{who have a}} contract with Twomey to grow grapes for them. The Duncan family’s purchase of the Soda Canyon Ranch vineyard in 1999 in southeastern Napa Valley was the impetus for Twomey’s creation. They originally purchased Soda Canyon Ranch Vineyard to produce Cabernet Sauvignon for Silver Oak. However, when winemaker Daniel Baron discovered it was also planted with quality French clones of Merlot, he approached the Duncans about making a Merlot using techniques he learned while working in France and Twomey began. Soda Canyon Ranch Vineyard {{is located in the}} rolling hills of southeastern Napa Valley and its <b>volcanic</b> <b>soils</b> are tightly planted with French Merlot clones.|$|E

25|$|Soil {{chemical}} and physical characteristics are {{strongly related to}} above ground productivity and forest structure and dynamics. The physical properties of soil control the tree turnover rates whereas chemical properties such as available nitrogen and phosphorus control forest growth rates. The soils of the eastern and central Amazon {{as well as the}} Southeast Asian Rainforest are old and mineral poor whereas the soils of the western Amazon (Ecuador and Peru) and volcanic areas of Costa Rica are young and mineral rich. Primary productivity or wood production is highest in western Amazon and lowest in eastern Amazon which contains heavily weathered soils classified as oxisols. Additionally, Amazonian soils are greatly weathered, making them devoid of minerals like phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and magnesium, which come from rock sources. However, not all tropical rainforests occur on nutrient poor soils, but on nutrient rich floodplains and <b>volcanic</b> <b>soils</b> located in the Andean foothills, and volcanic areas of Southeast Asia, Africa, and Central America.|$|E
25|$|The Deccan plateau is a topographically {{variegated}} region located {{south of}} the Gangetic plains-the portion lying between the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal-and includes a substantial area {{to the north of}} the Satpura Range, which has popularly been regarded as the divide between northern India and the Deccan. The name derives from the Sanskrit daksina ("south"). The plateau is bounded on the east and west by the Ghats, while its northern extremity is the Vindhya Range. The Deccan's average elevation is about 2,000 feet (600 m), sloping generally eastward; its principal rivers, the Godavari, Krishna, and Cauvery, flow from the Western Ghats eastward to the Bay of Bengal. The plateau's climate is drier than that on the coasts and is arid in places. Although sometimes used to mean all of India {{south of the}} Narmada River, the word Deccan relates more specifically to that area of rich <b>volcanic</b> <b>soils</b> and lava-covered plateaus in the northern part of the peninsula between the Narmada and Krishna rivers.|$|E

40|$|GSP 234 entitled: Geo-Congress 2014 Technical Papers: Geo-Characterization and Modeling for SustainabilityVolcanic soils can {{be found}} in many places around the world. In {{comparison}} to conventional soils, their mechanical behavior is less extensively studied in the laboratory. In this study, a series of laboratory tests has been carried out to investigate the small-strain shear modulus (G 0) of a <b>volcanic</b> <b>soil</b> sampled from northeastern Japan, using the resonant column and bender element techniques. Specimens were prepared at different packing densities and confining stress levels. The G 0 values of the original <b>volcanic</b> <b>soil</b> samples and the sieved soil samples without the fine particles (diameter < 63 μm) were measured to examine the influence of the fines. Selected test results are presented and discussed in this paper and are compared with that of two clean quartz sands that are commonly used in the laboratory. It is found that the G 0 value of the original <b>volcanic</b> <b>soil</b> is markedly lower than that of the clean quartz sands under otherwise similar conditions but the G 0 value increases substantially if the fine particles are removed from the original soil samples.
