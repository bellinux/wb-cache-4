The sultan issued an official Firman in 1778 and paid Hussein Pasha al-Jalili 800 Qirsh to buy the village of Baghdida. The people of Baghdida were <b>very</b> <b>upset</b> <b>about</b> what had happened. They met and decided after long deliberation to abandon the village. When al-Jalili heard the story, he felt guilty and decided to return the village to its rightful owners. He issued a decree in 1778, in which he relinquished his ownership to Baghdida, but he kept his rights to receive the tenth of its produce in taxes.|$|E

Putting his teachings in terms of Islam and the Koran, he soon gains influence over the local sheikh, who offers Cutter a substantial interest-free loan for a large aircraft he needs. He accepts, and when he returns from Britain with the aircraft, finds that the authorities are <b>very</b> much <b>upset</b> <b>about</b> the transaction, decrying Shaklin's influence over the sheikh.

500|$|The mystery writer J.A. Jance {{wrote in}} the Los Angeles Times, [...] "Yes, it's {{a bit of a}} shock to {{discover}} that some of the TV series' characters who died last season or the season before are back among the living between the covers of Lindsay's new book. Rita, Dexter's long-suffering wife who died a terrible death in a bathtub in last year's season finale, is alive and well and having a baby in Dexter Is Delicious. But my advice to readers is this: Don't quibble. Get over it. After all, fiction is an alternate universe to begin with, and Lindsay's dark, comedic fiction is an alternate universe once removed. Patrick McCann and Colin Wrinn were <b>very</b> <b>upset</b> <b>about</b> her death in Season 4 of the hit TV show, Dexter, but Colin Whelan did not care for her." ...|$|E

Just after she leaves, Jerry tries to reason with the others {{that he did not know}} she had a pony and wonders why {{immigrants}} with ponies would leave Europe to come to America without ponies ("Who leaves a country packed with ponies to come to a non-pony country?") After the dinner, when Jerry's parents are leaving, his father soothes: [...] "Hey, I agree with him. Nobody likes a kid with a pony."

500|$|Physicist Isidor Rabi noticed Oppenheimer's disconcerting triumphalism: [...] "I'll {{never forget}} his walk; I'll {{never forget the}} way {{he stepped out of}} the car... his walk was like High Noon... this kind of strut. He had done it." [...] At an {{assembly}} at Los Alamos on August 6 (the evening of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima), Oppenheimer took to the stage and clasped his hands together [...] "like a prize-winning boxer" [...] while the crowd cheered. He noted his regret the weapon had not been available in time to use against Nazi Germany. However, he and many of the project staff were <b>very</b> <b>upset</b> <b>about</b> the bombing of Nagasaki, as they did not feel the second bomb was necessary from a military point of view. He traveled to Washington on August 17 to hand-deliver a letter to Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson expressing his revulsion and his wish to see nuclear weapons banned. In October 1945 Oppenheimer was granted an interview with President Harry S Truman. The meeting, however, went badly, after Oppenheimer remarked he felt he had [...] "blood on my hands". The remark infuriated Truman {{and put an end to}} the meeting. Truman later told his Undersecretary of State Dean Acheson [...] "I don't want to see that son-of-a-bitch in this office ever again." ...|$|E

5000|$|Along with film critics, {{many have}} also accused the film's creators of {{excessive}} commercialization directed at young children (a criticism first leveled {{with the introduction}} of the Ewoks in Return of the Jedi). Star Wars creator George Lucas stated that he feels there is a section of the fanbase who get upset with aspects of Star Wars because [...] "the movies are for children but they don't want to admit that... There is a small group of fans that do not like comic sidekicks.

5000|$|An {{adjective}} phrase (or adjectival phrase) is {{a phrase}} whose head word is an adjective, e.g. fond of steak, <b>very</b> happy, quite <b>upset</b> <b>about</b> it, etc. The adjective in an adjective phrase can initiate the phrase (e.g. fond of steak), conclude the phrase (e.g. very happy), or {{appear in a}} medial position (e.g. quite <b>upset</b> <b>about</b> it). The dependents of the head adjective—i.e. the other words and phrases inside the adjective phrase—are typically adverbs or prepositional phrases, {{but they can also}} be clauses (e.g. louder than you do). Adjectives and adjective phrases function in two basic ways in clauses, either attributively or predicatively. When they are attributive, they appear inside a noun phrase and modify that noun phrase, and when they are predicative, they appear outside the noun phrase that they modify and typically follow a linking verb ...|$|R
500|$|It's {{something}} that's {{very difficult}} for me. Because it is lines on paper when I {{do it in the}} comic book series. It's like, 'Oh, okay, Charlie Adlard [...] doesn’t have to draw that arrangement of lines anymore, that person is dead.' But it's very uncomfortable for me to be on set, because I see these actors that are there and, in the source material, I have killed all but two of them. I walk through the set and I'm like, 'Yep, killed that one, killed that one, killed that one.' And it is firing those people. I feel really bad for Emma Bell, just because she was great and I {{would have liked to have}} had her in the show. But, you know, this is The Walking Dead, characters have got to die. Thankfully, Emma was brought onto the show with the understanding that she was only going to be in a certain number of episodes and she knew that she was going to die from the very beginning. But it doesn’t really make it any easier. When they were shooting those scenes, I had to fly to Comic-Con and so I wasn’t actually there for when she died. But it was very emotional on set and I know that she was <b>very</b> <b>upset</b> <b>about</b> having to leave the crew and the actors. You kind of become a family when you're doing a TV show and it’s a little upsetting to have to get rid of somebody.|$|E

When {{she gave me the}} news, I was upset, I started crying. I actually thought that while I was contemplating, 'What if I'm the killer?,' that I'd be excited but I started crying and started feeling bad for Terry. 'Oh man, this is a really tragic situation.'" [...] Allman also {{spoke about the}} point in the season when she began to wonder if Terry was the killer: [...] "I'm sure everybody on the cast was wondering if they were the killer or not at some point. But there was a scene that I alluded to some things that I had questioned whether or not I was the killer. It was the scene where [...] were playing with the trunk. I come down from the apartment and I see them in the garage locked in the trunk and I got really upset at Tommy. I remember [...] really wanting me to really shake Tommy and be <b>very</b> <b>upset</b> <b>about</b> this. I thought, why would I be that mad at him? It could've been, this is Terry not wanting the boys to mess around because it was how Rosie died or this is a flashback for her because she was involved." [...] This scene was in the Ogi Jun episode.|$|E

2500|$|The League of Women Voters had {{announced}} {{a schedule of}} debates similar to 1976, three presidential and one vice presidential. No one had {{much of a problem}} with this until it was announced that Rep. John Anderson might be invited to participate along with Carter and Reagan. Carter steadfastly refused to participate with Anderson included, and Reagan refused to debate without him. It took months of negotiations for the League of Women Voters to finally put it together. It was held on September 21, 1980 in the Baltimore Convention Center. Reagan said of Carter's refusal to debate: [...] "He [...] knows that he couldn't win a debate even if it were held in the Rose Garden before an audience of Administration officials with the questions being asked by Jody Powell." [...] The League of Women Voters promised the Reagan campaign that the debate stage would feature an empty chair to represent the missing president. Carter was <b>very</b> <b>upset</b> <b>about</b> the planned chair stunt, and at the last minute convinced the League to take it out. The debate was moderated by Bill Moyers. Anderson, who many thought would handily dispatch the former Governor, managed only a draw, according to many in the media at that time. The Illinois congressman, who had been as high as 20% in some polls, and {{at the time of the}} debate was over 10%, dropped to about 5% soon after. Anderson failed to substantively engage Reagan, instead he started off by criticizing Carter: [...] "Governor Reagan is not responsible for what has happened over the last four years, nor am I. The man who should be here tonight to respond to those charges chose not to attend," [...] to which Reagan added: [...] "It's a shame now that there are only two of us here debating, because the two that are here are in more agreement than disagreement." [...] In one moment in the debate, Reagan commented on a rumor that Anderson had invited Senator Ted Kennedy to be his running mate by asking the candidate directly, [...] "John, would you really prefer Teddy Kennedy to me?" ...|$|E

The first was that the team with the most torches would bypass The Eliminator and go on to the final challenge, which was Team Claw. The second advantage wasn't going to be revealed until the final challenge. Sting and Venom were going to play The Eliminator so Sting placed their hands on the Island Palms to see who was playing. The flame faded under none of them so they were all playing. It was then Venom's turn to place their hands on the Island Palms. The Island chose everyone except Asad. Because they hadthe least amount of Island Torches and 6 players, team captain Asad was being taken out of Team Venom and offered up as a prize for whoever won The Eliminator.

40|$|Travellers’ {{emotions}} and feelings {{as a result}} of inhospitable experiences with service providers have received limited research interest. The current study sought to address this gap by exploring and classifying travellers’ perceptions about inhospitable experiences while holidaying and considering the role of perceived injustice in the elicitation of divergence of emotions following the inhospitable encounter. The research undertaken spanned a period of two years – two peak summer periods in Croatia and was based on qualitative data gathered by way of interviewing both domestic and international travellers about their experiences with service staff while on holidays in Croatia. Of the 200 people interviewed, all but 34 (17 %) had something negative to report, and 90 (45 %) of the respondents were clearly <b>very</b> annoyed and <b>upset</b> <b>about</b> some of the encounters they had with Croatia’s service providers. The interview question was, “Can you describe your experiences with service providers while on holidays [in Croatia – for overseas visitors]?” The analysis of the findings revealed that both domestic and international tourists’ perceived {{emotions and}} injustices were predictive of the type of inhospitality received. With {{a better understanding of the}} nature and causes of the negative emotions experienced by the travellers {{as a result of}} inhospitable encounter, it should be possible to implement appropriate recovery systems that are designed to reverse the affects of inhospitable encounters...|$|R
