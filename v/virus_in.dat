5|$|Because {{the oral}} polio vaccine is inexpensive, easy to administer, and {{produces}} excellent immunity in the intestine (which helps prevent infection with wild <b>virus</b> <b>in</b> areas where it is endemic), {{it has been the}} vaccine of choice for controlling poliomyelitis in many countries. On very rare occasions (about one case per 750,000 vaccine recipients), the attenuated <b>virus</b> <b>in</b> the {{oral polio vaccine}} reverts into a form that can paralyze. Most industrialized countries have switched to inactivated polio vaccine, which cannot revert, either as the sole vaccine against poliomyelitis or in combination with oral polio vaccine.|$|E

5|$|The trial {{opened on}} June 11, 2007 in Washington, DC.

However, the government's expert witnesses conclusively demonstrated that O'Leary's positive results were caused by contamination in the Unigenetics lab rather than an actual infection.|$|E
5|$|Another {{breakthrough}} came in 1931, {{when the}} American pathologist Ernest William Goodpasture and Alice Miles Woodruff grew influenza {{and several other}} viruses in fertilised chickens' eggs.

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, viruses {{were defined}} in terms of their infectivity, their ability to be filtered, and their {{requirement}} for living hosts. Viruses had been grown only in plants and animals. In 1906, Ross Granville Harrison invented a method for growing tissue in lymph, and, in 1913, E. Steinhardt, C. Israeli, and R. A. Lambert used this method to grow vaccinia <b>virus</b> <b>in</b> fragments of guinea pig corneal tissue. In 1928, H. B. Maitland and M. C.

5|$|In 1943, Jacob Light and Horace Hodes {{proved that}} a {{filterable}} {{agent in the}} faeces of children with infectious diarrhoea also caused scours (livestock diarrhoea) in cattle.

5|$|In {{some species}} of RNA virus, the genes {{are not on}} a {{continuous}} molecule of RNA, but are separated. The influenza virus, for example, has eight separate genes made of RNA.

The virus status of individual queens was evaluated {{by examining the}} presence of <b>viruses</b> <b>in</b> the queens' feces and tissues, including hemolymph, gut, ovaries, spermatheca, head, and eviscerated body.

5|$|Some viruses {{can cause}} lifelong or chronic infections, where the viruses {{continue}} to replicate {{in the body}} despite the host's defence mechanisms.

40|$|When {{considering}} viruses {{of potential}} importance as tools for bioterrorism, several <b>viruses</b> <b>in</b> the Bunya- and Togaviridae {{families have been}} cited. Among those in the Bunyaviridae family are Rift Valley fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, hanta, and sandfly fever <b>viruses,</b> listed <b>in</b> order of priority. Those particularly considered in the Togaviridae family are Venezuelan, eastern and western equine encephalitis viruses. Factors affecting the selection of these viruses are the ability for them to induce a fatal or seriously incapacitating illness, their ease of cultivation in order to prepare large volumes, their relative infectivity in human patients, their ability to be transmitted by aerosol, {{and the lack of}} measures available for their control. Each factor is fully considered in this review. Vaccines for the control of infections induced by these <b>viruses</b> are <b>in</b> varying stages of development, with none universally accepted to date. <b>Viruses</b> <b>in</b> the Bunyaviridae family are generally sensitive to ribavirin, which has been recommended as an emergency therapy for infections by <b>viruses</b> <b>in</b> this family although has not yet been FDA-approved.

5|$|A {{laboratory}} diagnosis is usually made based on recovery of poliovirus from a stool sample or a swab of the pharynx. Antibodies to poliovirus can be diagnostic, and are generally {{detected in the}} blood of infected patients early in the course of infection. Analysis of the patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is collected by a lumbar puncture ("spinal tap"), reveals an increased number of white blood cells (primarily lymphocytes) and a mildly elevated protein level. Detection of <b>virus</b> <b>in</b> the CSF is diagnostic of paralytic polio, but rarely occurs.|$|E
5|$|After {{the virus}} enters the body {{there is a}} period of rapid viral replication, leading to an {{abundance}} of <b>virus</b> <b>in</b> the peripheral blood. During primary infection, the level of HIV may reach several million virus particles per milliliter of blood. This response is accompanied by a marked drop in the number of circulating CD4+ T cells. The acute viremia is almost invariably associated with activation of CD8+ T cells, which kill HIV-infected cells, and subsequently with antibody production, or seroconversion. The CD8+ T cell response is thought to be important in controlling virus levels, which peak and then decline, as the CD4+ T cell counts recover. A good CD8+ T cell response has been linked to slower disease progression and a better prognosis, though it does not eliminate the virus.|$|E
5|$|Governments are {{particularly}} concerned with zoonoses, diseases that humans may acquire from animals. Wild animal populations may harbour diseases {{that can affect}} domestic animals which may acquire them {{as a result of}} insufficient biosecurity. An outbreak of Nipah <b>virus</b> <b>in</b> Malaysia in 1999 was traced back to pigs becoming ill after contact with fruit-eating flying foxes, their faeces and urine. The pigs in turn passed the infection to humans. Avian flu H5N1 is present in wild bird populations and can be carried large distances by migrating birds. This virus is easily transmissible to domestic poultry, and to humans living in close proximity with them. Other infectious diseases affecting wild animals, farm animals and humans include rabies, leptospirosis, brucellosis, tuberculosis and trichinosis.|$|E

40|$|<b>Viruses</b> are {{abundant}} <b>in</b> {{the ocean and}} a major driving force in plankton ecology and evolution. It has been assumed {{that most of the}} <b>viruses</b> <b>in</b> seawater contain DNA and infect bacteria, but RNA-containing <b>viruses</b> <b>in</b> the ocean, which almost exclusively infect eukaryotes, have never been quantified. We compared the total mass of RNA and DNA in the viral fraction harvested from seawater and using data on the mass of nucleic acid per RNA- or DNA-containing virion, estimated the abundances of each. Our data suggest that the abundance of RNA viruses rivaled or exceeded that of DNA <b>viruses</b> <b>in</b> samples of coastal seawater. The dominant RNA <b>viruses</b> <b>in</b> the samples were marine picorna-like viruses, which have small genomes and are at or below the detection limit of common fluorescence-based counting methods. If our results are typical, this means that counts of viruses and the rate measurements that depend on them, such as viral production, are significantly underestimated by current practices. As these RNA viruses infect eukaryotes, our data imply that protists contribute more to marine viral dynamics than one might expect based on their relatively low abundance. This conclusion is a departure from the prevailing view of <b>viruses</b> <b>in</b> the ocean, but is consistent with earlier theoretical predictions...|$|R
