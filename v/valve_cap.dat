50|$|When using {{fuel and}} oxygen tanks {{they should be}} {{fastened}} securely upright to a wall or a post or a portable cart. An oxygen tank is especially dangerous {{for the reason that}} the oxygen is at a pressure of 21 MPa (3000 lbf/inÂ² = 200 atmospheres) when full, and if the tank falls over and its valve strikes something and is knocked off, the tank will effectively become an extremely deadly flying missile propelled by the compressed oxygen, capable of even breaking through a brick wall.For this reason, never move an oxygen tank around without its <b>valve</b> <b>cap</b> screwed in place.|$|E
50|$|The air {{pressure}} in an inflated tire holds the inner valve body shut. A small screw and captive nut {{on the top}} of the valve body permits the valve to be screwed shut and ensure that it remains tightly closed. The nut must be unscrewed to permit airflow in either direction. This must be done before attaching a pump. The screw remains captive on the valve body even when unscrewed fully; it is tightened again after the tire is inflated and the pump removed. The <b>valve</b> <b>cap</b> protects the valve body, keeps dirt and mud out of the mechanism, and also prevents the valve from damaging the tube when it is rolled for storage, but is not necessary to prevent pressure loss.|$|E
50|$|On Friday, January 10, 1936, William Taylor, 42, an African-American farmhand, was {{instantly}} killed when his produce truck {{was struck by}} the Blue Comet while crossing the tracks at Finkel's Lane, Shrewsbury. Mr. Taylor was employed on the farm owned by C. Borderson of Shrewsbury and had been transporting produce from one side of farm to the other. The crossing was on private property and had no watchman. The engineer, William J. Smith of Elizabeth, was taken into custody for questioning and later released. Engineer Smith stated that the bell of the Blue Comet had been kept ringing ever since the train pulled out of the Red Bank station. The whistle, he said, had also been sounded. The truck was demolished and the locomotive badly damaged. A steam <b>valve</b> <b>cap</b> from the automatic safety control of the engine was damaged and the steam escaped. After a delay of about an hour, the train limped into Eatontown station, where an extra locomotive from Red Bank took up the interrupted journey.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the right}} hand side of the engine there is dual {{ignition}} at each cylinder first from the magneto supplying low-tension power to complex ignitors inside the inlet <b>valve</b> <b>caps</b> and again from conventional high-tension sparking plugs through a distributor from the accumulator (battery) dynamo and coil. The low tension igniter and the high tension sparking plug are mounted on the inspection cover above the inlet valves.|$|R
50|$|Metal, {{and some}} hard plastic <b>valve</b> <b>caps</b> have a rubber-washer seal (or a synthetic-rubber-washer seal) inside {{to help make}} a {{hermetic}} seal (airtight seal). The cap helps prevent air from escaping from a slightly leaking valve. In addition, the rubber washer prevents the cap from loosening and falling off due to vibrations and hence being lost, by acting as a cushion between the <b>cap</b> and the <b>valve</b> stem {{and in this way}} damping the vibrations, though most caps are a softer plastic making the need for a separate seal unnecessary.|$|R
5000|$|First-generation dTPMS {{sensors that}} are {{integral}} with the valve stem {{have suffered from}} corrosion. [...] Metallic <b>valve</b> <b>caps</b> can become seized to the valve stem because of galvanic corrosion of dissimilar metals, and efforts to remove it can break the stem, destroying the sensor. A similar fate may befall an after-market brass valve core inside the stem {{that may have been}} installed by unwary technician, replacing the original specialized nickel-coated cores. (They can be distinguished by the yellowish colour of the brass.) Seizure of the valve can complicate repair of a tire leak, possibly requiring replacement of the entire sensor.|$|R

These design features enabled the valve device to simultaneously meet a set of high frequency (1 - 10 kHz), high pressure(0. 1 -IMPa), and large stroke (15 - 40,um) requirements that had not previously been satisfied by other microvalves presented in the literature. This research was carried out through a series of modeling, design, fabrication, assembly, and experimental testing tasks. Linear and non-linear modeling tools characterizing the structural deformations of the active valve sub-systems were developed. These tools enabled accurate prediction of real-time stresses along the micromachined valve membrane structure during deflection into its non-linear large-deflection regime. A systematic design procedure was developed to generate an active valve geometry to satisfy membrane stress limitations and valve power consumption requirements set forth by external hydraulic system performance goals. (cont.) Fabrication challenges, such as deep-reactive ion etching (DRIE) of the drive element and valve membrane structures, wafer-level silicon-to-silicon fusion bonding and silicon-to-glass anodic bonding operations, preparation and integration of piezoelectric material elements within the micromachined tethered piston structure, die-level assembly and bonding of silicon and glass dies, and filling of degassed fluid within the hydraulic amplification chamber were overcome. The active valve structural behavior and flow regulation capabilities were evaluated over a range of applied piezoelectric voltages, actuation frequencies, and differential pressures across the valve. For applied piezoelectric voltages up to 500 Vpp at lkHz, the valve devices demonstrated amplification ratios of drive element deflection to <b>valve</b> <b>cap</b> deflection of 40 - 50 x. These amplification ratios correlated within 5 - 10 % of the model expectations. Flow regulation experiments proved that a peak average flow rate through the device of 0. 21 mL/s under a lkHz sinusoidal drive voltage of 500 Vpp, with valve opening of 17 pm, against a differential pressure of 260 kPa could be obtained. Tests revealed that fluid-structural interactions between the <b>valve</b> <b>cap</b> and membrane components and flow instabilities (due to transition between the laminar and turbulent flow regimes through the valve orifice) limited the valve performance capabilities. by David C.

50|$|A dustcap {{is a small}} cover used on {{the valve}} stem of a bicycle or car tire to prevent dust or other small {{particles}} from entering the valve and damaging it. The dustcap also forms a pressure seal, helping to prevent deflation of the tire due to slight gas seepage past the tire valve. Dustcaps are usually made from plastic but may occasionally be made of metal. The dustcap is internally threaded and is secured by screwing it onto {{the end of the}} stem. To prevent corrosion due to electrolysis and malfunction of the electronics in a direct TPMS and avoid costly repairs, metal <b>valve</b> <b>caps</b> without insulating plastic linings should not be used on direct-TPMS-equipped tire valve stems.|$|R

The advanced compressor monitoring system, which uses dynamic compressor cylinder pressure, directly targets these areas. This system not only provides the information available in the old type monitoring system, but provides much more information concerning the compressor?s loading, performance, and efficiency. Operators and maintenance personnel will now have much more information for critical decisions concerning letting a compressor continue in service or shutting it down to help prevent further damage. A point by point discussion {{of the type of}} data available form such a system and diagnostic information provided by each parameter is provided. Finally, several examples are presented showing the use of this type of advanced continuous monitoring system on a hydrogen compressor in a refinery setting...|$|E

50|$|Buoys {{for this}} use are usually either {{inflated}} and sealed by a <b>valve</b> or <b>cap,</b> or made from buoyant material, {{so they do}} not deflate or flood during the dive, rendering them ineffective.

50|$|The trays or plates used in {{industrial}} distillation columns are fabricated of circular steel plates and usually installed inside the column at intervals of about 60 to 75 cm (24 to 30 inches) up {{the height of}} the column. That spacing is chosen primarily for ease of installation and ease of access for future repair or maintenance. An example of a very simple tray is a perforated tray. The desired contacting between vapor and liquid occurs as the vapor, flowing upwards through the perforations, comes into contact with the liquid flowing downwards through the perforations. In current modern practice, as shown in the adjacent diagram, better contacting is achieved by installing bubble-caps or <b>valve</b> <b>caps</b> at each perforation to promote the formation of vapor bubbles flowing through a thin layer of liquid maintained by a weir on each tray.|$|R
