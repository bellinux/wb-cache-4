In 1965, the Supreme Court produced some decisions, including Lamont v.

5|$|Regarding the {{taxability}} {{of income}} {{in connection with}} events or activities not involving a government privilege or franchise, the United States Supreme Court stated in United States v. Sullivan that gains from illegal traffic in liquor {{are subject to the}} Federal income tax. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Rutkin <b>v.</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> that the receipt of money obtained by extortion is taxable as income to the wrongdoer. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in James <b>v.</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> that the receipt of money obtained through embezzlement is taxable as income to the wrongdoer, even though the wrongdoer is required to return the money to its owner.|$|E
5|$|Three United States Supreme Court {{decisions}} in 1919 each upheld convictions under laws against {{certain kinds of}} anti-war speech. In 1919, the Court upheld the conviction of Socialist Party leader Charles Schenck for publishing anti-war literature. In Debs <b>v.</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> the court upheld the conviction of Eugene Debs. While the Court upheld a conviction a third time in Abrams <b>v.</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote an important dissent which has gradually been absorbed as an American principle: he urged the court to treat freedom of speech as a fundamental right, which should rarely be restricted.|$|E

The ruling {{was based on the}} previous Supreme Court's decisions, by which the Court of Appeals was bound. Later, when he was a Supreme Court justice, Harlan, however, wrote an opinion overturning the conviction of Communist Party activists as unconstitutional in the case of Yates <b>v.</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> Another such case was Watkins <b>v.</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b>|$|E

5|$|Debs appealed his {{conviction}} to the Supreme Court. In its ruling on Debs <b>v.</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> the court examined several statements Debs had made regarding World War I and socialism. While Debs had carefully worded his speeches {{in an attempt}} to comply with the Espionage Act, the Court found he had the intention and effect of obstructing the draft and military recruitment. Among other things, the Court cited Debs' praise for those imprisoned for obstructing the draft. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. stated in his opinion that little attention was needed since Debs' case was essentially {{the same as that of}} Schenck <b>v.</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> in which the Court had upheld a similar conviction.|$|E

5|$|Enforcement {{of federal}} civil rights law in the South created {{numerous}} peonage cases, which slowly traveled up through the judiciary. The Supreme Court ruled in Clyatt <b>v.</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> (1905) that peonage was involuntary servitude. It held that although employers sometimes described their workers' entry into contract as voluntary, the servitude of peonage was always (by definition) involuntary.|$|E
