25|$|Some {{features}} seemed far-fetched, {{but were}} actually {{ahead of their}} time. The wings mounted flush with the aircraft, but had a mechanism which allowed them to rotate in angle of incidence, as well as fold rearward from ten degrees of sweep to forty five degrees for braking and storage. These features were incorporated on future carrier aircraft such as the Fairey Firefly for storage rather than braking and flight control. Variable incidence mechanisms are used commonly to trim tail surfaces, however some aircraft such as the Vought F-8 Crusader have deployed the concept in practical use. The <b>variable</b> <b>sweep</b> mechanism {{can be seen on}} some high-speed aircraft such as the General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark to expand their flight envelope. Bonney used differential sweep for roll control.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{geometric}} <b>variables</b> (<b>sweep</b> and twist) on the structural performance of advanced turboprops are investigated. The investigation {{is limited to}} aerodynamically efficient turboprops using an acceptable design configuration as a baseline. The baseline configuration is modified using a seven by seven array of independently varying sweep and twist parameters while maintaining acceptable aerodynamic efficiency. The turboprop structural performance is evaluated in terms of critical speeds, tip displacements, and vibration frequencies where geometric nonlinearities are included.

50|$|Because of his {{technical}} background Fred {{was invited}} to join the newly created group around Ludwig Bölkow. His mentor was the engineer Hans Derschmidt, a member of the Bölkow group who developed a swept rotor system with <b>variable</b> <b>sweep</b> and who recommended Engelhardt to the company owner Mr. Boelkow (“he is not only a pilot - he also has some solid understanding of helicopter technology”). Boelkow was in need for a test pilot for his Bo 46 project (the Bo 46 employed a novice rotor concept with <b>variable</b> <b>sweep</b> main rotor blades so to achieve higher speeds in forward flight. After his inventor this rotor system is named “Derschmidt Rotor”).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{colour space}} one uses has a {{bearing on the}} type of colour image {{processing}} tasks one does. As we approach the stage of colour processing in image processing, new colour spaces may be needed. In particular, colour spaces that model properties of our perception of colour may be useful. We propose two nonlinear, tridimensional transformations of the variables of the RGB (or LMS) colour space. In the resulting spaces pure S, or pure M input, does not imply the presence of yellow. Since there is evidence of S input to the parvocelular system, we use a dimension called violet minus green; in the resulting space, as the wavelength <b>variable</b> <b>sweeps</b> the visible spectrum, a circle is obtained, making explicit a circularity of chromaticity for spectral colours. ...|$|R

40|$|Small Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) are {{versatile}} tools {{with both}} {{civilian and military}} applications. Fixed wing UAVs require forward airspeed to remain airborne, usually resulting in constant energy expenditure to loiter over targets. A UAV capable of perching could reduce energy expenditure by settling on a site near the target, thus increasing mission duration. Avian perching techniques were observed to build a hypothesis for the biological control techniques employed during the landing maneuver. Variation of wing sweep for pitch control {{was identified as a}} contributing control method, and selected for study. A biologically-inspired aircraft was designed with <b>variable</b> wing <b>sweep,</b> and modeled using a combination of MATLAB and Athena Vortex Lattice (AVL) to predict pitching response due to wing sweep. A small remote controlled prototype was built with <b>variable</b> wing <b>sweep</b> in addition to standard flight control surfaces.

For large aircraft, current research is concentrated on hybrid LFC concepts which combine suction and pressure-gradient control. At NASA Ames, an F- 14 with <b>variable</b> wing <b>sweep</b> has been flight tested with smooth surface gloves on the wings; preliminary results indicate high transition Reynolds numbers to sweep angles as large as 25 deg.

Static force and moment measurements were obtained for wing leading edge sweep angles of 26, 33, 39, and 72. 5 degrees. Fluctuating wing root bending moment data were obtained at subsonic speeds to determine buffet characteristics.

50|$|In 1989, Chinese {{military}} {{was no longer}} interested in the variable-sweep wing and Q-6 was considered inadequate for future conflicts. In addition to the overweight problem of the variable-sweep wing design, avionics and engine issues already identified, there was also problem of the limitation of Chinese industrial capability of producing the advanced composite material needed for the airframe, which was a must in order to makeup the overweight in the <b>variable</b> <b>sweep</b> wing and avionics. This was never achieved and the advanced composite material that was supposedly used was never developed successfully even after the program was already cancelled. The most important factor, however, was that the Chinese realization of stealth: variable-sweep wing would enlarge the radar {{cross section of the}} aircraft multiple times and thus making it impossible to survive on the modern battlefield, because it would be {{much more likely to be}} detected and shot down. Coupled with difficulties mentioned earlier, Q-6 was finally terminated in 1989. Only three models/prototypes were built, one for static test, one for avionics test on the ground, and one for the <b>variable</b> <b>sweep</b> wing research. Chinese have claimed that although the program was cancelled, experience gained had helped to advance Chinese aeronautical industry by providing the necessary lessons learned.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{successful}} and experimental designs were introduced from the 1940s into the 1970s; however, the {{recent advances in}} flight control technology and structural materials have allowed designers to closely tailor the aerodynamics and structure of aircraft, removing the need for <b>variable</b> <b>sweep</b> angle to achieve the required performance; instead, wings are given computer-controlled flaps on both {{leading and trailing edges}} that increase or decrease the camber or chord of the wing automatically to adjust to the flight regime. This is another form of variable geometry, although it is not commonly called such.|$|E
50|$|After {{the close}} of World War II, Boris Cheranovsky was running a de facto design bureau working on jet fighter aircraft. Not only was Cheranovsky {{involved}} with jet propulsion, he also studied variable geometry with the BICh-24 and BICh-25, which were designed with <b>variable</b> <b>sweep</b> wings pivoting outboard of the fuselage to help alleviate centre of pressure changes. Also envisaged was a stressed skin light alloy tailless jet fighter with powered flying controls and pressurised cockpit, designated BICh-26. Cheranovsky's failing health from 1948 prevented further progress on these projects.|$|E
40|$|Two {{dimensional}} {{wind tunnel}} test results obtained for supercritical airfoils indicated that substantial improvements in aircraft performance at high subsonic speeds could be achieved by shaping the airfoil to improve the supercritical flow above the upper surface. Significant increases in the drag divergence Mach number, the maximum lift coefficient for buffer onset, and the Mach number for buffet onset at a given lift coefficient were demonstrated for the supercritical airfoil, as compared with a NACA 6 series airfoil of comparable thickness. These trends were corroborated by results from three dimensional wind tunnel and flight tests. Because these indicated extensions of the buffet boundaries could provide significant improvements in the maneuverability of a fighter airplane, an exploratory wind tunnel investigation was initiated which demonstrated that significant aerodynamic improvements could be achieved from the direct substitution of a supercritical airfoil on a <b>variable</b> wing <b>sweep</b> multimission airplane model...|$|R
50|$|In {{the quest}} to achieve both good soaring/slow speed and good cruising/high-speed {{characteristics}} many glider designers have studied variable geometry or polymorphic concepts. Unlike fast jet aircraft, <b>variable</b> wing <b>sweep</b> has very limited value for a slow flying glider, so glider designers favour concepts which involve changing the wing area rather than sweep angle. There are several methods of achieving variable area, including:- area increasing flaps extending from leading or trailing edges of the wing, telescopic variable span wings where an outer glove is extended or retracted over an inner section, and extending gloves which extend out from the fuselage over the existing wing. The FS-29 was designed and built to research the telescopic variable span wing.With the wing at full extension the FS-29 could thermal successfully in very weak conditions and land safely in small spaces, conversely with the wing fully retracted the FS-29 could cruise between lift at higher speeds, improving performance in distance/speed competitions, as well as perform aerobatics to higher load factors with faster control response.|$|R

It did not fly again until after the war had ended, when it was repaired in the Nabern factory. Because there were few surviving training gliders in post-war Germany, the Hi 21 was much used and made some 14,000 winch launches in the eighteen months to the end of 1946.|$|E

This paper {{deals with}} {{determining}} the sufficient conditions of minimum {{for the class}} of problems in which the necessary conditions of optimum are satisfied in the strengthened form Legendre-Clebsch. To this paper, we shall use the sweep method which analysis the conditions of existence of the conjugated points on the optimal trajectory. The study we have done evaluates the command variation on the neighboring optimal trajectory. The sufficient conditions of minimum are obtained by imposing the positivity of the second variation.

40|$|A {{method is}} shown by which the {{symmetric}} span loading for a certain class of wings can be simply found. The geometry of these wings is limited {{only to the extent}} that they must have symmetry about the root chord, must have a straight quarter-chord line over the semispan, and must have no discontinuities in twist. A procedure is shown for finding the lift-curve slope, pitching moment, center of lift, and induced drag from the span load distribution. A method of accounting for the effects of Mach number and for changes in section lift-curve slope is also given. Charts are presented which give directly the characteristics of many wings. Other charts are presented which reduce the problem of finding the symmetric loading on all wings falling within the prescribed limits to the solution of not more than four simultaneous equations. The loadings and wing characteristics predicted by the theory are compared to those given by other theories and by experiment. It is concluded that the results given by the subject theory are satisfactory. The theory is applied to a number of wings to exhibit the effects of such <b>variables</b> as <b>sweep,</b> aspect ratio, taper, and twist. The results are compared and conclusions drawn as to the relative effects of these variables...|$|R

[...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Aerospace EngineeringThis thesis {{investigates the}} {{feasibility}} of using Dynamic Inversion to develop control laws for time varying systems, specifically Miniature Morphing Air Vehicles. Two Linear Time Varying systems are investigated namely a pendulum of variable length and a miniature aircraft {{with the ability to}} change wing sweep. Simulations of the pendulum and the aircraft are provided with and without the control law in the loop. These simulations show the effectiveness of using dynamic inversion to control LTV systems. The aircraft model used in the simulations is a fourth order model which contains only the longitudinal dynamics. The stability and performance of the open and closed loop is investigated using a notion of LTV poles, that employ a time-varying Ricatti equation. This work also presents preliminary nonlinear aerodynamic model for a miniature aircraft which morphs through <b>variable</b> wing <b>sweep.</b> The estimation of the aerodynamics and the stability derivatives were conducted using Athena Vortex Lattice (AVL).
