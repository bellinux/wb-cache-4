5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six movements, first alternating arias and recitative, then uniting the <b>voices</b> <b>in</b> recitative and aria, {{finally a}} chorale. The two soloists {{are supported by}} an intimate Baroque instrumental ensemble of oboe, strings and continuo. The oboe accompanies the soprano, a solo violin the bass, both play when the voices are united.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the aim of}} the NCMP {{scheme to}} {{ameliorate}} the impacts of the first-past-the-post system, its legitimacy is highly doubted. It is based neither on a clear electoral mandate like ordinary MPs, nor on expertise or specialization (as in the case of NMPs). As a result, the privileges of NCMPs are severely curtailed and this limits their effectiveness as alternative <b>voices</b> <b>in</b> Parliament.|$|E

The theoretical part deals with passive <b>voice</b> <b>in</b> German and Czech language and with it related main concepts, creating, dividing and using it. The practical part is made by contrastive analysis corpus which is made from parallel German and Czech. The text is also detecting if German and Czech language prefer using passive <b>voice</b> <b>in</b> front of active voice and if it is use passive <b>voice</b> <b>in</b> Germen language correspond with using passive <b>voice</b> <b>in</b> Czech language, eventually which kind of passive voice is more usual...|$|R
5|$|Initially, in Ancient Greece, {{homophony}} indicated {{music in}} which a single melody is performed by two or more <b>voices</b> <b>in</b> unison or octaves, i.e. monophony with multiple voices. Homophony as a term first appeared in English with Charles Burney in 1776, emphasizing the concord of harmonized melody.|$|E
5|$|Josquin {{frequently}} used imitation, especially paired imitation, in writing his motets, with sections akin to fugal expositions occurring on successive {{lines of the}} text he was setting. An example is his setting of Dominus regnavit (Psalm 93), for four voices; each of {{the lines of the}} psalm begins with a voice singing a new tune alone, quickly followed by entries of other three <b>voices</b> <b>in</b> imitation.|$|E

Or by voices you may understand, {{such as the}} {{lightning}} and thunder begets in our hearts: for though man is as mute as a fish to Godward, before this thunder and lightning comes to him, yet after that he is full of voices (2 Cor 4:13, 7:14). And how much more numerous are the <b>voices</b> that <b>in</b> the whole church on earth are begot by these lightnings and thunders that proceed from the throne of grace; their faith has a voice, their repentance has a voice, their subjection to God's word has a <b>voice</b> <b>in</b> it; yea, there is a <b>voice</b> <b>in</b> their prayers, a <b>voice</b> <b>in</b> their cry, a <b>voice</b> <b>in</b> their tears, a <b>voice</b> <b>in</b> their groans, in their roarings, in their bemoaning of themselves, and in their triumphs!

5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six movements, {{an opening}} choral fugue, alternating arias and recitatives and closing chorale. He scored {{the work for}} four vocal soloists, a four-part choir and a festive Baroque instrumental ensemble of three trumpets and timpani, two oboes, strings and continuo. The oboes and strings play with the <b>voices</b> <b>in</b> motet style in the choral sections, while the trumpets add {{the style of a}} new time. The cantata is part of Bach's Picander cycle.|$|E

5|$|Biko saw white {{racism in}} South Africa as {{the totality of}} the white power structure. He argued that under apartheid, white people not only participated in the oppression of black people but were also the main <b>voices</b> <b>in</b> {{opposition}} to that oppression. He thus argued that in dominating both the apartheid system and the anti-apartheid movement, white people totally controlled the political arena, leaving black people marginalised. He believed white people were able to dominate the anti-apartheid movement because of their access to resources, education, and privilege. He noted that white South Africans were poorly suited to this role because they had not personally experienced the oppression that their black counterparts faced.|$|E
5|$|During Franklin's administration, Eleanor {{became an}} {{important}} connection to the African-American population {{in the era of}} segregation. Despite the President's desire to placate Southern sentiment, Eleanor was vocal in her support of the civil rights movement. After her experience with Arthurdale and her inspections of New Deal programs in Southern states, she concluded that New Deal programs were discriminating against African-Americans, who received a disproportionately small share of relief moneys. Eleanor became one of the only <b>voices</b> <b>in</b> the Roosevelt White House insisting that benefits be equally extended to Americans of all races.|$|E

5|$|Reviewers {{identified}} the contributions from Driessen, Flanders and Boyer as of particular interest, though challenged {{the inclusion of}} chapters focussed on the environment. They also criticised the book's failure to include contributions from, or sufficiently engage with the work of, the key <b>voices</b> <b>in</b> the politically focused animal ethics literature, such as Robert Garner, Sue Donaldson and Will Kymlicka, Alasdair Cochrane, Kimberly Smith or Siobhan O'Sullivan. Wissenburg's chapter was identified as the one which engaged most directly with this literature; his approach, however, was a negative one. Garner has written that Political Animals and Animal Politics should be praised for its trailblazing, but predicted {{that it would be}} superseded by stronger collections on the same theme.|$|E
5|$|Schubert's famous String Quintet {{was written}} in September 1828, {{together}} with the final versions of the sonatas. The slow movements of the quintet and the B-flat Sonata bear striking similarities in their main sections: both employ the same unique textural layout, in which two-three voices sing long notes in the middle register, accompanied by the contrasted, short pizzicato notes of the other <b>voices,</b> <b>in</b> the lower and upper registers; in both movements, the long notes over the relentless ostinato rhythm, convey an atmosphere of complete stillness, of arrest of all motion and time. String quintet textures also appear elsewhere, throughout the sonata trilogy.|$|E

Unlike in traditional wrestling rules, the opponent may be pinned belly-down.|$|E

5|$|While in Milan, Josquin wrote several {{examples}} of {{a new type of}} piece developed by the composers there, the motet-chanson. These compositions were texturally very similar to 15th century chansons in the formes fixes mold, except that unlike those completely secular works, they contained a chant-derived Latin cantus-firmus in the lowest of the three voices. The other <b>voices,</b> <b>in</b> French, sang a secular text which had either a symbolic relationship to the sacred Latin text, or commented on it. Josquin's three known motet-chansons, Que vous madame/In pace, A la mort/Monstra te esse matrem, and Fortune destrange plummaige/Pauper sum ego, are similar stylistically to those by the other composers of the Milan chapel, such as Loyset Compère and Alexander Agricola.|$|E
5|$|After {{a series}} of residencies, Davey {{embarked}} on a pre-Christmas tour of Ireland in 2007. She appeared on the seventh series of Other <b>Voices</b> <b>in</b> early 2008. The singer represented Ireland at the Eurosonic Festival in Groningen, the Netherlands, in January 2008. She performed at Childline Rocks in February 2008, followed by a performance at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas in that March. Davey was dropped by her record company in mid-2008 alongside most of their client list. She headlined the Main Stage at Cork X Southwest in Skibbereen in July 2008. In August 2009, she headlined the Eurocultured Festival in Dublin's Smithfield Plaza and also performed at that year's Indie-pendence. Davey appeared at Electric Picnic 2008. She featured at The Music Show in the RDS in October 2008. The singer performed in Dublin's Iveagh Gardens during events to celebrate Africa Day on 25 May.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six movements. The {{text and}} tune of the hymn are {{retained in the}} outer choral movements, a chorale fantasia and a four-part closing chorale, which frame two sets of recitative and aria. Bach scored the work for four vocal soloists (soprano, alto, tenor, bass), a four-part choir, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of four trombones (Tb), two oboes (Ob), two violins (Vl), viola (Va) and basso continuo. This {{is one of three}} Bach cantatas to use four different trombone parts (soprano, alto, tenor, and bass), the others being Ach Gott, vom Himmel sieh darein, BWV 2 and Ich hatte viel Bekümmernis, BWV 21. The instruments play colla parte with the <b>voices</b> <b>in</b> the outer movements in the style of Bach's motets.|$|E
