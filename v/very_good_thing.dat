He also {{wrote a letter to}} photographer William Pecchi Jr. in 1988 which reads: [...] "Maybe I look at the world through rose colored glasses but I love people all over the world. That is why stories of racism really disturb me. [...] Because in truth I believe ALL men are created equal, I was taught that and will always believe it. I just can’t conceive of how a person could hate another because of skin color. I love every race on the planet earth. Prejudice is the child of ignorance.

500|$|Up! Live from Chicago {{received}} favorable critic reviews. Matt Bjorke of About.com {{reviewed the}} home release of Up! Close and Personal. He had not attended a Shania concert, nor seen the television special, {{and was surprised}} by the singer's stage presence. He believed that the video would make the singer's naysayers realize Shania's vocal talents and ability to entertainment and interact with a crowd. Bjorke concluded, [...] "Up! Live in Chicago is a dynamic DVD experience that is sure to please fans for years to come." [...] Chris Jones of BBC noted the band's differed from most country bands and wanted a more country-influenced sound. However, Jones complimented the singer's incorporation of the audience, naming it her [...] "inimitable style". He added that the video was [...] "far from [...] sterile experience" [...] because of the live setting and crowd ambiance. However, he suspected Shania's [...] "photocopy-perfect" [...] vocal delivery could be attributed to a fair amount of post-production work. [...] "Overall, you know exactly what you're getting with Shania, and for her fans this is bound to be a <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> indeed." [...] Bobby Reed of the Chicago Sun Times believed Shania failed to give insight into her identity or personality, noting she never mentioned her relocation to Switzerland or her then-new son, Eja. He complimented the band's strong, yet rote efforts of bringing the dense production to life. However, he claimed Shania's vocal delivery was at times frail. Reed also noted the absence of guest stars, in contrast to her two previous concert specials, and acknowledged that inviting fans onstage gave the concert a country-fair vibe. Mark Guarino of Arlington Heights' Daily Herald believed the concert was evidently tailored for television and that Shania played the proper host. He continued, [...] "As the night wore on, Shania tried different ways, with varying degrees of success, to make the magnitude of such a large event work for the small screen. Her reliance on audience participation was an attempt to humanize things, but it often backfired." ...|$|E
