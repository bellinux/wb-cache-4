5|$|While not {{inside an}} {{infected}} cell {{or in the}} process of infecting a cell, viruses exist in the form of independent particles. These viral particles, also known as virions, consist of two or three parts: (i) the genetic material made from either DNA or RNA, long molecules that carry genetic information; (ii) a protein coat, called the capsid, which surrounds and protects the genetic material; and in some cases (iii) an envelope of lipids that surrounds the protein coat when they are outside a cell. The shapes of these virus particles range from simple helical and icosahedral forms for some <b>virus</b> <b>species</b> to more complex structures for others. Most <b>virus</b> <b>species</b> have virions that are too small to be seen with an optical microscope. The average virion is about one one-hundredth the size of the average bacterium.|$|E
5|$|Since Dmitri Ivanovsky's 1892 article {{describing}} a non-bacterial pathogen infecting tobacco plants, {{and the discovery}} of the tobacco mosaic virus by Martinus Beijerinck in 1898, about 5,000 <b>virus</b> <b>species</b> have been described in detail, although there are millions of types. Viruses are found in almost every ecosystem on Earth and are the most abundant type of biological entity. The study of viruses is known as virology, a sub-speciality of microbiology.|$|E
5|$|The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) {{developed}} the current classification system and wrote guidelines {{that put a}} greater weight on certain virus properties to maintain family uniformity. A unified taxonomy (a universal system for classifying viruses) has been established. The 9th ICTV Report defines {{the concept of the}} <b>virus</b> <b>species</b> as the lowest taxon (group) in a branching hierarchy of viral taxa. However, at present {{only a small part of}} the total diversity of viruses has been studied, with analyses of samples from humans finding that about 20% of the virus sequences recovered have not been seen before, and samples from the environment, such as from seawater and ocean sediments, finding that the large majority of sequences are completely novel.|$|E

40|$|Traditionally, virus {{taxonomy}} {{relied on}} phenotypic properties; however, a sequence-based virus taxonomy has become essential since the recent requirement {{of a species}} to exhibit monophyly. The <b>species</b> Cowpox <b>virus</b> has failed to meet this requirement, necessitating a reexamination of this species. Here, we report the genomic sequences of nine Cowpox viruses and, by combining them with the available data of 37 additional genomes, confirm polyphyly of Cowpox viruses and find statistical support based on genetic data {{for more than a}} dozen species. These results are discussed in light of the current International Committee on Taxonomy of <b>Viruses</b> <b>species</b> definition, as well as immediate and future implications for poxvirus taxonomic classification schemes. Data support the recognition of five monophyletic clades of Cowpox <b>viruses</b> as valid <b>species...</b>|$|R
5|$|Playa de Oro {{virus was}} first {{identified}} in rodents collected in 2004 {{as part of}} a survey of wild mammals at Playa de Oro in Manzanillo, Colima, western Mexico. The discovery was published in 2008 by Yong-Kyu Chu and colleagues. Among 600 small mammals, antibodies against the hantavirus Sin Nombre virus were found in 23 individuals (out of 358 studied) of Oryzomys couesi, a rice rat that was the most common species found, six (out of 87) of the cotton rat Sigmodon mascotensis, and one (out of 77) of the pygmy mouse Baiomys musculus. In addition, twelve O.couesi and one S.mascotensis yielded hantavirus RNA. Viruses were found in males more often than in females. Because the amino acid sequences in sequenced parts of the virus's genome differed by as much as 7 to 10% from closely related hantaviruses, Chu and colleagues identified the virus found at Playa de Oro as a new species, called Playa de Oro virus or OROV. Although the authors could not prove that the virus fulfilled all the criteria for identifying a new <b>virus</b> <b>species,</b> they argued that it was likely that it did fulfill those criteria. It is currently treated as a probable species in the Hantavirus genus.|$|E
5|$|Co-evolution {{hypothesis}} : This is {{also called}} the virus-first hypothesis and proposes that viruses may have evolved from complex molecules of protein and nucleic acid {{at the same time}} as cells first appeared on Earth and would have been dependent on cellular life for billions of years. Viroids are molecules of RNA that are not classified as viruses because they lack a protein coat. However, they have characteristics that are common to several viruses and are often called subviral agents. Viroids are important pathogens of plants. They do not code for proteins but interact with the host cell and use the host machinery for their replication. The hepatitis delta virus of humans has an RNA genome similar to viroids but has a protein coat derived from hepatitis B virus and cannot produce one of its own. It is, therefore, a defective virus. Although hepatitis delta virus genome may replicate independently once inside a host cell, it requires the help of hepatitis B virus to provide a protein coat so that it can be transmitted to new cells. In similar manner, the sputnik virophage is dependent on mimivirus, which infects the protozoan Acanthamoeba castellanii. These viruses, which are dependent on the presence of other <b>virus</b> <b>species</b> in the host cell, are called satellites and may represent evolutionary intermediates of viroids and viruses.|$|E
25|$|In <b>virus</b> <b>species</b> with reverse {{transcriptase}} lacking DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity, creation of double-stranded DNA {{can possibly be}} done by host-encoded DNA polymerase δ, mistaking the viral DNA-RNA for a primer and synthesizing a double-stranded DNA by similar mechanism as in primer removal, where the newly synthesized DNA displaces the original RNA template.|$|E

25|$|Based on genetic {{differences}} between HCV isolates, the hepatitis C <b>virus</b> <b>species</b> is classified into six genotypes (1–6) with several subtypes within each genotype (represented by lower-cased letters).

2500|$|Replication of HCV {{involves}} several steps. The virus replicates {{mainly in}} the hepatocytes of the liver, where {{it is estimated that}} daily each infected cell produces approximately fifty virions (virus particles) with a calculated total of one trillion virions generated. [...] The virus may also replicate in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, potentially accounting for the high levels of immunological disorders found in chronically infected HCV patients. [...] HCV has a wide variety of genotypes and mutates rapidly due to a high error rate {{on the part of the}} virus' RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The mutation rate produces so many variants of the virus it is considered a quasispecies rather than a conventional <b>virus</b> <b>species.</b> [...] Entry into host cells occur through complex interactions between virions and cell-surface molecules CD81, LDL receptor, SR-BI, DC-SIGN, Claudin-1, and Occludin.|$|E
2500|$|CBSD is {{characterized}} by severe chlorosis and necrosis on infected leaves, giving them a yellowish, mottled appearance. Chlorosis {{may be associated with}} the veins, spanning from the mid vein, secondary and tertiary veins, or rather in blotches unconnected to veins. [...] Leaf symptoms vary greatly depending on a variety of factors. [...] The growing conditions (i.e. altitude, rainfall quantity), plant age, and the <b>virus</b> <b>species</b> account for these differences. [...] Brown streaks may appear on the stems of the cassava plant. [...] Also, a dry brown-black necrotic rot of the cassava tuber exists, which may progress from a small lesion to the whole root. [...] Finally, the roots can become constricted due to the tuber rot, stunting growth. Typically the affected plants do not possess all of these characteristics, but those that are severely affected may. Farmers may be unaware of their infected cassava crops until they are harvested and see the tuber lesions because leaves are asymptomatic.|$|E
