50|$|Evaporation {{of liquid}} film in film {{evaporators}} {{is very important}} in order to cool the flowing liquid and the surface on which the liquid flows. It can also increase the concentration of the components in the liquid. The climbing/falling film plate evaporator is specifically designed to produce a thin film during both the climbing and falling phases. For the climbing film evaporators, the feed is introduced {{at the bottom of the}} tubes. Evaporation causes the vapor to expand thus causing a thin film of liquid to rise along the tubes. The vapor shear will push the thin film to climb up the wall of the tubes. The feed for the falling film evaporator on the other hand is introduced at the top of the tubes. The liquid flows down the tubes and it will get evaporated as it descends. The flow of the liquid down the tubes is driven by the vapor shear stress and the gravitational forces. The effect of the vapor shear and the gravity will lead to a higher flow rates and shorter residence time. The flow of the thin liquid film in the falling film evaporator is possible in two ways: cocurrent and countercurrent. It is cocurrent if the <b>vapor</b> <b>is</b> <b>drawn</b> from the top to the bottom of the tubes and vice versa for the countercurrent flow. The cocurrent flow will increase the flow rates resulting in a shorter residence time. The type of flow can be described in figure 2.|$|E
50|$|The Outer Banks are {{susceptible}} to reoccurring hurricanes that pummel their fragile coastline. Hurricanes are a name for intense tropical cyclones that develop in the Atlantic Basin. A tropical cyclone is a non-frontal low-pressure system that forms over tropical or sub-tropical waters with organized thunderstorm activity and established surface wind circulation. A tropical cyclone begins as a tropical wave that commonly forms of {{the west coast of}} Africa. Tropical waves are areas of unsettled weather consisting of vertical air movement. Water <b>vapor</b> <b>is</b> <b>drawn</b> upward from warm surface waters and large amounts of heat energy are released when water vapor rises and condenses. Warm ocean temperatures of eighty degrees or higher to a depth of one hundred and fifty feet are needed to strengthen tropical cyclones. This is why the official hurricane season is from June 1 to November 30 (The summer-autumn peak). To determine the strength of a storm, the process of a developing hurricane is sectioned by four stages. First an organized area of thunderstorms that maintains structure for twenty-four hours or more is recognized as a tropical disturbance. If the develops a surface circulation and sustained maximum wind speeds of 38 mph, the storm advances to a tropical depression. Later, if the storm increases its maximum sustained wind speeds to 39-73 mph, the storm is referred as a tropical storm and at that point is given a name. For the storm to become a hurricane, the organized area of intense thunderstorms will have to developed a well defined area of surface circulation and maximum sustained winds speeds that measure over 74 mph. Hurricanes are classified into five different categories measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale, which categorizes these storms based on their wind speeds, barometric pressure, and storm surge.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Thermal Conduction Heating (TCH) {{is a major}} {{component}} of In Situ Thermal Desorption (ISTD), a soil remediation technology in which heat and vacuum are applied simultaneously. Heat flows into the soil primarily by conduction from heaters typically operated between 1000 and 1500 ºF (540 and 815 ºC). The heaters are installed in wells at regular intervals within the soil. As the soil is heated, water is boiled and dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) constituents in the soil are vaporized. The resulting steam and <b>vapors</b> <b>are</b> <b>drawn</b> toward extraction wells for in-situ and aboveground treatment. Compared to fluid injection processes, the conductive heating process is very uniform in its vertical and horizontal sweep. Field project experience at numerous TCH/ISTD sites has confirmed that maintaining target temperatures for several days results in extremely high destruction and removal efficiency of chlorinated volatile organic compounds (CVOCs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and other DNAPLs. Provided that water influx is managed, the effectiveness of the TCH/ISTD process is not limited by the presence of heterogeneous soil conditions or clay, and can be applied effectively below the water table.

40|$|The basic {{objective}} {{of this research was}} the desalination of sea or brackish water using solar energy and vacuum techniques. A process using the vacuum technique was devised for the desalination of sea or brackish water under desert conditions, and calculations were made to show the advantages of this process. To simulate a section of this overall process, an evaporator which may be operated at pressures ranging from relatively low vacuum to one atmosphere was designed. This evaporator was used to convert saline water into fresh water. Solar energy was simulated by using artificial lamps for the conversion process, and fresh water was used experimentally in place of saline water. The purpose was to obtain data on the relationship between the applied vacuum inside the evaporator, the fresh water yield, and the heat distribution in the system. The evaporator consisted of a hollow cylinder made of K-Monel with the bottom made of the same metal and painted black on the inside. Radiant energy from an infrared artificial lamp was transmitted through clear methyl-methacrylate (Plexiglas) which was fitted {{on the top of the}} cylinder. The <b>vapor</b> <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> to a coil and shell condenser where it was condensed and collected. The vacuum applied on the system was controlled manually. Six runs were made with a constant batch feed of water, and each run was continued until the system reached a steady-state. A heat balance was made for each run, and the amount of heat available for water evaporation was compared to the weight of water evaporated and collected in the condenser chamber. Due to the application of vacuum and due to the absorptivity of the Plexiglas top, radiation always occurred from th Plexiglas top to the water basin The fresh water yield increased with a decrease in the pressure applied inside the evaporator. For a pressure of 0. 46 lb/in^ 2 inside the evaporator, the rate of fresh water production was 72 g/hr while for a pressure of 1. 28 lb/in^ 2 inside the evaporator, the rate of water production ws 55 g/hr. The heat available for evaporation increased with a decrease in the pressure applied on the system. When the applied pressure was 5 lb/in^ 2, 37. 4 per cent of the incident radiation was available for water 2 production; and when the pressure decreased to 0. 46 lb/in^ 2 the heat available for water evaporation was 52. 6 per cent of the incident radiation. This investigation revealed the applicability of using vacuum techniques in saline water conversion. Recommended further research consisted mainly of investigating the productivity of the still when it is used under the sun in a desert site. Once these investigations are accomplished a main application of this process may be to furnish municipal water to communities. It may be also possible to develop a household desalting unit which could compete economically with the best household desalting units on the market today...|$|R
