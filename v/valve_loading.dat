40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an application of}} Differential Search (DS) algorithm for solving non-convex economic dispatch (ED) problems with the <b>valve</b> <b>loading</b> effects. ED {{is one of the}} most challenging problems of power system since it is difficult to determine the optimum generation scheduling to meet the particular load demand with the minimum fuel costs while all constraints are satisfied. In addition, the practical ED problems which are involving non-convex objective functions with equality and inequality constraints including the practical operation constraints of generators such as ramp rate limit, prohibited operating zones and generation limits make it harder to solve the global optimum using conventional methods. In this paper, DS is adopted to find the global optimum results of ED. To demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of DS in solving ED, four well known ED test systems with non-convex solution features have been tested and compared with some of the most recently published ED solution methods in literature. The results of this research show that DS is able to find more economical solution than those determined by other methods...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the application of}} a mixedinteger programming (MIP) approach for solving stochastic security-constrained daily hydrothermal generation scheduling (SCDHGS). Power system uncertainties including generating units and branch contingencies and load uncertainty are explicitly considered in the stochastic programming of SCDHGS. The roulette wheel mechanism and lattice Monte Carlo simulation (LMCS) are first employed for random scenario generation wherein the stochastic SCDHGS procedure is converted into its respective deterministic equivalents (scenarios). Then, the generating units are scheduled through MIP over the set of deterministic scenarios for the purpose of minimizing the cost of supplying energy and ancillary services over the optimization horizon (24 h) while satisfying all the operating and network security constraints. To amore realistic modeling of the DHGS problem, in the proposed MIP formulation, the nonlinear <b>valve</b> <b>loading</b> effect, cost, and emission function are modeled in linear form, and prohibited operating zones (POZs) of thermal units are considered. Furthermore, a dynamic ramp rate of thermal units is used, and for the hydro plants, the multiperformance curve with spillage and time delay between reservoirs is considered. To assess the efficiency and powerful performance of the aforementioned method, a typical case study based on the standard IEEE- 118 bus system is investigated, and the results are compared to each other in different test systems...|$|E

To introduce more accurate modeling, the <b>valve</b> <b>loading</b> effects {{are incorporated into}} the conventional quadratic smooth generator cost curves. In addition, quadratic consumer benefit functions are integrated into the objective function to guarantee that locational marginal prices charged at the demand buses are less than, or equal to, the DisCos benefit, earned by selling the power to retail customers. The proposed approach utilizes fuzzy-based genetic algorithms for optimal scheduling of GenCos and DisCos, as well as optimal placement and sizing of SSSC and TCSC units. In addition, the Newton–Raphson approach is used to minimize the mismatch of the power flow equation. Simulation results on the modified IEEE 14 -bus and IEEE 30 -bus test systems (with/without line flow constraints, {{before and after the}} compensation) are used to examine the impact of SSSC and TCSC on total system social welfare improvement versus their cost. To validate the accuracy of the proposed method, several case studies are presented and simulation results are compared with those generated by genetic and Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) approaches...|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} a design of pilot-assisted <b>load</b> control <b>valve</b> with <b>load</b> velocity control ability and fast opening feature based on static and dynamic modeling. Traditional <b>load</b> control <b>valves</b> {{do not have}} the load velocity control ability and its opening feature is very poor because the high spring stiffness comes along with the pressure–spring balance–based principle. Some improvement has been done by employing a two-stage pressure–pressure balance principle to make a <b>load</b> control <b>valve</b> to achieve <b>load</b> velocity control ability while the opening feature was not improved much. In this design, another pressure–pressure balance principle is proposed to make the <b>load</b> control <b>valve</b> achieve <b>load</b> velocity control ability and fast opening closing feature at the same time.

An actual <b>load</b> control <b>valve</b> was developed according to the above methods and the test results show both good load velocity control ability and fast opening feature of the design, which validates the potentiality of the proposed design in many applications...|$|R

40|$|During {{the past}} few years {{systematic}} vibration testing has played an increasing part in the evaluation of mechanical devices. The electro-hydraulic vibrator, consisting of a valve-controlled hydraulic cylinder, is capable of high thrusts over a fairly wide range of frequency. This paper examines the theoretical behaviour of such a vibrator which is itself similar to a hydraulic positioning system. The cylinder equations are extended to include end leakages and the servo valve is examined both for transfer characteristics and the interdependence of flow and load. I t is shown that the classical square root relationship between pressure drop a d flow does not necessarily apply for a two-stage valve with a spring-centred second stage and that a dimensionless number known as the <b>valve</b> <b>load</b> compensation coefficient describes these characteristics. For practical valves it is possible for the flow to be almost independent of the load over a wide range of operating conditions and thus a linear transfer function can be used for the valve-cylinder combination. The experimental work shows good agreement between the theoretical characteristics and those found in practice...|$|R

Also, under normal operating conditions, the generation capacity {{is more than the}} total load demand and losses. Thus, there are many options for scheduling generation. In an interconnected power system, the objective is to find the real and reactive power scheduling of each power plant {{in such a way as}} to minimize the operating cost. This means that the generator‟s real and reactive powers are allowed to vary within certain limits so as to meet a particular load demand with minimum fuel cost. This is called optimal power flow problem. In this project, ECONOMIC LOAD DISPATCH (ELD) of real power generation is considered.

Endoparasite (internal) loads in the elasmobranch spiral valve {{may be a}} source of such unaccounted mortality and morbidity by both inhibiting nutrient uptake and stimulating inflammatory responses within the gastrointestinal tract in the host. Spiral valves of the night shark (Carcharhinus signatus, n= 16), silky shark (Carcharias falciformis, n= 18) and pelagic stingray (Pteroplatytrygon violacea, n= 99) were obtained opportunistically from pelagic longline operations.

Total spiral <b>valve</b> parasite <b>loads</b> were compared against the total length, weight and sex of the host; however, no relationship was observed between these factors. A total of 133 elasmobranch hosts were examined, yielding over 800 individual parasites.
