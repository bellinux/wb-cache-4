40|$|This report {{addresses}} {{changes in}} population size in five species of diving ducks breeding and wintering in the Baltic Sea. Declines in breeding Greater Scaup, Eider and <b>Velvet</b> <b>Scoters</b> on the Baltic coast are verified. Long-tailed Ducks and Eiders have declined in winter. Breeding Eiders have declined in Norway. Monitoring programs in all Nordic countries are partly inadequate for detecting changes in numbers of birds both {{in winter and}} during breeding, but large-scale trends appear reliable. The reasons for the declines observed are largely unknown. For breeding Eiders {{in the northern part}} of the Baltic Sea a change in predation regimes on the breeding islands may be important. If the negative trends are to be stopped, a deeper understanding of the drivers involved and better knowledge about the ecological status of the Baltic Sea food webs utilized by the diving ducks are needed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. During the Middle Neolithic the Åland {{archipelago}} {{consisted of}} a group of small islands. The distance to the nearest shore of the mainland was over 100 km. The archipel-ago was occupied by the Pitted Ware people. This paper presents the bird bones found on the site of Jettböle I (c. 3400 - 2800 cal BC) in Jomala, one of the largest Pitted Ware base-camps on the islands. The economy was based on marine resources (mainly seals), and fishing and fowling were an important constituent part. My aim is to draw a picture of fowling at the Jettböle I based on the avian remains found at the site. The total number of bird bone fragments identified at the site is over 1200 and the number of different bird spe-cies is at least 15. The Eider Somateria mollissima was the most important bird species hunted, followed by the <b>Velvet</b> <b>Scoter</b> Melanitta fusca. The bone material from Jettböle I is the largest and the best preserved bone sample found in Stone Age Finland...|$|E
40|$|As many seaduck populations {{around the}} world have been {{reported}} to be in decline, there is an increasing demand for knowledge about intrinsic and extrinsic factors determining population dynamics of these species. In this study, we analyzed long-term dynamics of the summer population of Velvet Scoters (Melanitta fusca) breeding in the Åland archipelago in the Baltic Sea; in particular, we examined the influence of winter weather and density dependence on population change. The studied population exhibited substantial fluctuations but only a weak negative trend during the total period of 58 years (1949 – 2007), and no significant trend at all during the latter three decades of the study (1977 – 2007). We tested for density dependence and incorporated the winter North Atlantic Oscillation index into the model to test for effects of winter conditions. Our final model explained 56. 3 % of the variance of population growth of the studied population. Delayed density dependence explained 29. 7 %, pre-breeding climate 8. 3 %, and post-breeding climate 18. 3 % of the variance. That breeding success is density dependent in a delayed manner is in accordance with the apprehension that Velvet Scoters breed at the age of 2 years. We conclude that density dependence and winter conditions must be taken into consideration when discussing population changes in seaducks in general and the <b>Velvet</b> <b>Scoter</b> in particular. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{numbers of}} divers, ducks, gulls, terns and waders in the 15 km 2 {{oligotrophic}} lake Takvatn, North Norway were estimated six times during 1983 - 2012. Systematic mapping surveys were done by boat {{within the first}} week after ice-break in June. Twenty-one species were observed {{over the years and}} 12 were regarded as breeding on the lake. Red-breasted merganser Mergus serrator was the dominant diving bird, with estimated minimum number of pairs varying from 15 to 39 among years. Black-throated diver Gavia arctica (1 - 3 pairs), tufted duck Aythya fuligula (2 - 15 pairs) and common scoter Melanitta nigra (1 - 5 pairs) bred regularly, while <b>velvet</b> <b>scoter</b> Melanitta fusca (1 - 2) and goldeneye Bucephala clangula (2 - 4) were found in some years and mallard Anas platyrhynchos (1 pair) and wigeon Anas penelope (1 pair) in one year.

40|$|Die Verbreitungsmuster ausgewählter See- und Wasservogelarten in den Offshore-Bereichen der deutschen Ostsee werden erstmals für die vier Jahreszeiträume Frühjahr, Sommer, Herbst und Winter dargestellt. Dabei zeigen sich bei den einzelnen Arten sowohl räumliche als auf saisonale Verbreitungsunterschiede. Die deutschen Ostseewässer stellen für See- und Wasservögel ein wichtiges Rast-, Mauser- und Überwinterungsgebiet dar, einige Arten kommen in {{international}} bedeutsamen Konzentrationen vor. Für das im Mai 2004 an die EU-Kommission gemeldete Seevogelschutzgebiet „Östliche Pommersche Bucht“ im Ostteil der deutschen Ostsee werden erstmals aktuelle Bestandszahlen der wichtigsten Seevogelarten vorgestellt. Für im Untersuchungsgebiet nur selten auftretende Seevogelarten werden die Gesamtzahlen aller Nachweise aus den Schiffszählungen angegeben. Ziehende oder nur im Küstenbereich vorkommende Wasservogelarten werden lediglich namentlich aufgelistet. In Ergänzung zu früheren Publikationen liefert der vorliegende Artikel umfassende Informationen über das Vorkommen und die jahreszeitlichen Unterschiede der häufigen See- und Wasservogelarten im Offshore-Bereich der deutschen Ostsee. The German Baltic Sea {{is a very}} important area for seabirds and waterbirds. 38 species are regularly found in coastal or offshore waters. Many of them occur {{in international}} important concentrations and are subject to various conservation-related conventions and directives, especially the EU Birds Directive and the African-Eurasian Waterbird Agreement (AEWA). From 2000 to 2005, several research projects were dedicated to describe and analyse the distribution and abundance of seabirds in the offshore area in the German Baltic Sea at high spatial and temporal resolutions. In this study, we present {{for the first time the}} distribution of seabirds and waterbirds in the German Baltic Sea throughout the year, based on transect counts from ships. The main focus is on the offshore areas. For the most numerous species we present the distribution for the four seasons summer, autumn, winter and spring, defined species-specific. The maps clearly show spatial and temporal differences in the distribution of the various species. While Red-breasted Mergansers, Great Crested Grebes or Great Cormorants occur predominantely close to the coast, Red-necked Grebes, Slavonian Grebes and Common Guillemots, among others, prefer offshore-areas. The most numerous and characteristic species are the sea ducks Common Eider, Long-tailed Duck, Common Scoter and <b>Velvet</b> <b>Scoter.</b> They prefer areas with low water depth along the coast or on shallow banks in the offshore area. While Common Eiders occur chiefly in the western parts of the German Baltic Sea, Velvet Scoters are mainly found in the eastern parts. Both species have high densities in the winter half-year but only small numbers during summer. Long-tail Ducks and Common Scoters are distributed over large areas of the German Baltic Sea, but while the former species occurs in the winter half-year only, the latter species is present throughout the whole year. Gulls are widespread throughout the study area and show only local and/or short-term concentrations. Aggregations are often in the vicinity of high fishing activities. The most frequent gull species is the Herring Gull. Terns occur only in very small numbers in the German Baltic Sea, with Black Terns exhibiting small concentrations in the eastern part during late summer. Species that occur predominantly in coastal areas of the German Baltic Sea are not presented in detail. However, for Mute Swan, Greater Scaup, Common Goldeneye and Goosander we present maps for the winter half-year (October-April), as the nearshore distribution of these species sometimes extent into offshore areas. For species occuring only seldom within the study area we present a list with the total number of individuals seen during the surveys. Coastal or migrating waterbird species are only named. Together with previously published information on the distribution of seabirds and waterbirds in the German Baltic Sea, available mainly for the winter and spring periods, this study gives a comprehensive overview about the spatial and temporal distribution of the most numerous and widespread seabirds and waterbirds in the German Baltic Sea. In addition, current population estimates of these species are given for the recently designated Special Protection Area “Pommersche Bucht” in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the eastern part of the German Baltic Sea...|$|E
