50|$|Tasmania has a {{moderate}} maritime climate, cooled by prevailing westerly winds off the Southern Ocean, providing conditions free of extremes in temperature. Mild {{spring and summer}} temperatures, with warm autumn days and cool nights allow the grapes to ripen slowly on the vine, resulting in maximum <b>varietal</b> <b>flavour</b> development. This is achieved without losing that essential natural acidity that gives wine both freshness and balance.|$|E
40|$|The grape variety {{with colored}} pulp and juice named “Professor Davids” was {{selected}} in Greece by P. Zamanidy, L. Troshin and A. Isachkin in 2003 with {{crossing of the}} Greek varieties of “Mandilaria” with the French introducent of “Alicant Bushe”. The duration of the production period is 156 - 165 days. Variety is full-grown. The degree of maturation of the vines is high. Crop yields are very high. The average mass of clusters is 300 gr. Has a high winter hardiness, drought-resistance and high resistance to fungal diseases in comparison with industrial varieties of Vitis vinifera. The female flower, with the stamens. The bunch of average size, cylindroconical, medium density. Berries are medium, round, blue-black in color, with a thick wax coating. The skin is thick, dense. The pulp and juice are intensively painted, with <b>varietal</b> <b>flavour.</b> Sugar content is very high. Notable for long preservation of the harvest in the bushes. The variety is suitable for making intensively painted dry red wines of superior class and high-quality dessert wines and unique juices. Due to its morpho- physiological characteristics it has {{been included in the}} eco-geographic group of varieties of the Black sea basi...|$|E
40|$|Free and glycosidically bound {{volatiles}} were quantified in five grape samples {{grown in}} 1996 {{from two of}} the most important Vitis vinifera varieties of Vinhos Verdes Region, Loureiro and Alvarinho. The most recommended sub-region for monovarietal wine production and an alternative sub-region were chosen. A third sample of Alvarinho was selected from a different and particular pebble soil. Forty compounds in the free fraction and sixty-four in the glycosidically bound fraction including alcohols, monoterpenic compounds, C 13 norisoprenoids, phenols, C 6 compounds and carbonyl compounds were quantified in the samples of the two varieties. The results showed that these two Portuguese varieties were quite different regarding the <b>varietal</b> <b>flavour</b> compounds, even grown in the different sub-regions. Samples of Loureiro variety showed higher content of free monoterpenic compounds than Alvarinho, mainly linalool, pyran linalool oxides and 3, 7 -dimethylocta- 1, 7 -dien- 3, 6 -diol. Free linalool seemed to be characteristic of Loureiro variety, with levels higher than its perception threshold. Both cultivars contained important levels of bound monoterpenic compounds and C 13 norisoprenoids, bound linalool occurring in high levels in both varieties. Nevertheless, Alvarinho variety contained higher amounts of bound geraniol and monoterpenic oxides and diols, mainly trans-pyran linalool oxide, geranic acid and (Z) - 8 -hydroxylinalool, while Loureiro variety was richer in bound α-terpineol and p- 1 -menthen- 7, 8 -diol.

50|$|The vine ripens {{relatively}} quite late, producing good yields {{with high}} resistance to fungal disease and rot. The grape crossed with another Veneto wine grape, Marzemina bianca, to produce Raboso Veronese. It produces quite a large, tight, cylindrical bunch {{with one or}} two wings and a sturdy bunchstem. Its spheroid grape has a blue-black, very tough skin with good bloom. The flesh has a <b>varietal,</b> neutral <b>flavour</b> which is slightly meaty and sweet-acidulous-astringent.Each grape has two or three average-sized, pear-shaped seeds. This vigorous vine can produce an abundant yield. Optimal vinification requires appropriate maceration of juice and skins: this results in a full-bodied wine, acidic and tannic when young, ideal for laying down.Left to age in wooden barrels, it will gradually acquire a deep ruby colour with garnet tinges, a broad and full bouquet of wild violets with a concentrated note of morello cherry; the palate is dry, attractively astringent, and full-flavoured.At full maturity, Raboso Piave {{is one of the great}} Venetian reds, probably the best among the traditional wine of Eastern of Veneto. It is excellent with furred and feathered game, red meat, grilled meats and well-matured cheeses. It is also a superb sipping wine, an ideal accompaniment to long winter evenings in the company of friends.|$|R
40|$|The {{distinctive}} <b>varietal</b> <b>flavour</b> {{of grapes}} and wine {{is affected by}} the absolute and relative concentrations of many compounds, including monoterpene alcohols such as citronellol, geraniol, hotrienol, linalool, nerol and α-terpineol. Monoterpenols in grapes and wine can occur either as free volatile and odorous molecules, or as glycosidically bound, odourless, non-volatile complexes. β-Glucosidases constitute one group of glycosidases that can help to unleash this latent pool of grape-derived volatile aglycons and provide an additional source of wine aroma and flavour compounds. However, yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and bacteria (Oenococcus oeni) most commonly used to initiate alcoholic and malolactic fermentation during winemaking have only limited ability to liberate the aromatic terpenols as well as other aglycones bound to saccharides. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to clone, integrate and express two β-glucosidase genes (BGL 1 and BGL 2) from the dimorphic yeast, Saccharomycopsis fibuligera, in a commercially available wine yeast strain, VIN 13. Using p-nitrophenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside as a synthetic substrate, enzyme assays and kinetic studies indicated that both these two extracellularly produced β-glucosidases were able to cleave glycosidic bonds efficiently. Subsequently, wine from Chenin blanc, Gewürztraminer and Pinotage grapes was made with the transformed and untransformed S. cerevisiae VIN 13 strains, and compared. A series of analyses indicated that wines produced by the β-glucosidase-producing VIN 13 strain contained slightly higher levels of terpenols in comparison with the wines produced by the untransformed control VIN 13 strain. Surprisingly, the wines produced by the transformed strain also contained increased ester concentrations. Many of these fragrant compounds, when produced in appropriate concentrations, would contribute to the fermentation bouquet of wine. The extent to which this acquired capacity of the transformed wine yeast is of practical significance in large-scale wine production is at present unclear but presents a worthwhile proposition for further investigation. 10 page(s...|$|E
