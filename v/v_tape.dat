For on-line nondeterministic Turing machines, (1) simulating 2 pushdown stores by 1 tape requires Ω(n^ 1. 5 / logn) time; {{together with a}} newly proved O(n^ 1. 5 √(logn)) upper bound [L 3], this basically settled the open problem 1 in [DGPR] for 1 <b>tape</b> <b>vs.</b> 2 pushdown case (the case of 1 <b>tape</b> <b>vs.</b> 2 <b>tapes</b> was basically settled by [M]); (2) simulating 1 queue by 1 tape requires Ω(n^ 4 / 3 / logn) time; this brings us closer to a newly proved O(n^ 1. 5 √(logn)) upper bound [L 3]; (3) simulating 2 tapes by 1 tape requires Ω(n^ 2 / lognloglogn) time; this is a minor improvement of [M]'s Ω(n^ 2 / log^ 2 nloglogn) lower bound; it is also claimed (full proof contained in [L 3]) that the actual languages used in [M] (also here) and [F] do not yield Ω(n^ 2) lower bound. To cope with an open question of [GS] of whether a k-head 1 -way DFA (k-DFA) can do string matching, we develop a set of techniques and show that 3 -DFA cannot do string matching, settling the case k = 3.

40|$|Context: There {{is a lack}} of {{research}} on the effects of scapular tape on shoulder joint repositioning. Objective: To quantify the effects of scapular taping on shoulder joint repositioning during flexion and abduction. Design: Repeated measures before and after trial. Setting: Academic institution. Participants: 36 subjects without shoulder pathology. Intervention: Scapular taping with flexion and abduction. Main Outcome Measures: Lateral scapular slide test, plumb-line assessment, and a depth measurement. Absolute error in joint repositioning in flexion and abduction at 3 angles with and without scapular taping was measured. Results: No differences were found for <b>tape</b> <b>vs</b> no <b>tape</b> in flexion (P =. 92) or abduc-tion (P =. 40) or between winging and nonwinging subjects in flexion (P =. 62) or abduction (P =. 91). Conclusions: Scapular taping has no effect on joint repositioning during active shoul-der flexion or abduction.

40|$|This report {{contains}} short descriptions, flow {{charts and}} listings {{of the computer}} programs that are currently being used for routine processing of strong-motion accelerograms at the Earthquake Engineering Research Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology. All programs are in Fortran IV. The programs are presented in five groups corresponding to the processing scheme developed at the Earthquake Engineering Research Laboratory for Volume I, II, III, IV, and eventually Volume V reports (Hudson, et al, 1969; Hudson, et al, 1971; Hudson, et al, 1972 a; and Hudson, et al, 1972 b). The programs belonging to the Volume I operation are used to check the raw digitized data, to perform the elementary corrections for time and fixed base line, and to scale the raw digitized acceleration data to seconds and G/ 10 (G is the acceleration of gravity = 981 cm/sec'). The programs belonging to Volume II processing perform the instrument and base line corrections and calculate ground velocity and displacement. The programs for Volume III processing calculate the true velocity spectra, the Fourier amplitude spectra and the pseudo velocity spectra, while the programs for Volume IV compute the Fourier amplitude spectra using the Fast Fourier Transform approach. On {{the completion of the}} various stages of processing the output data are plotted, tabulated, punched on cards, and stored on magnetic tapes.

50|$|Bing Crosby, a {{big star}} on radio at the time, was {{receptive}} {{to the idea of}} pre-recording his radio programs. He disliked the regimentation of live broadcasts, and much preferred the relaxed atmosphere of the recording studio. He had already asked the NBC network to let him pre-record his 1944-45 series on transcription discs, but the network refused, so Crosby had withdrawn from live radio for a year and returned (this time to the recently created ABC) for the 1946-47 season only reluctantly. Another possible motivation wasn't so much that Crosby wanted the more relaxed atmosphere of <b>taping</b> <b>vs</b> live but that live network radio required performing two identical shows a night, one for the east coast and one for the west coast. This may have been what Crosby was hoping to avoid, as that was the argument Crosby used with the radio network when he asked to use transcription disc recordings of his show. Those recordings were made directly from the live east coast show, as were the later taped versions.|$|R

40|$|Based on two graph {{separator}} theorems, one old (the Lipton-Tarjan planar separator theorem) and one new, {{we present}} two unexpected upper bounds and resolve several open problems for on-line computations: (1) 1 tape nondeterministic machines can simulate 2 pushdown stores in time O(n^ 1. 5 √(logn)) (true for both on-line and off-line machines). Together with the Ω (n^ 1. 5 √(logn)) lower {{bound by the}} author [L 1], this solved the open problem 1 in [DGPR] for the 1 <b>tape</b> <b>vs.</b> 2 pushdown case. It also disproves the commonly conjectured Ω (n^ 2) lower bound. (Note, the Ω (n^ 2) lower bound has been proved for the deterministic case [M, L, V].) (2) the languages defined by [M] and [F], aimed to obtain optimal lower bound for 1 tape nondeterministic machines, can be accepted in O(n^ 2 loglogn / √(logn)) and O(n^ 1. 5 √(logn)) time by a 1 tape TM, respectively. (3) 3 pushdown stores are better than 2 pushdown stores. This answers open problem 3 of [DG]. (An Ω(n^ 4 / 3 / log^e n) lower bound is also obtained.) (4) 1 tape can nondeterministically simulate 1 queue in O(n^ 1. 5 √(logn)) time. (The lower bounds were: Ω(n^ 2) for deterministic case [V] and Ω(n^ 4 / 3 / logn) [L 1] for nondeterministic case. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine the ability of a GPS-imbedded {{accelerometer}} to assess stride variables and vertical stiffness (K), which are directly related to neuromuscular fatigue during field-based high-intensity runs. The ability to detect stride imbalances was also examined. A team sport player performed a series of 30 -s runs on an instrumented treadmill (6 runs at 10, 17 and 24 km·h- 1) with or without his right ankle taped (aimed at creating a stride imbalance), while wearing on his back a commercially-available GPS unit with an embedded 100 -Hz tri-axial accelerometer. Contact (CT) and flying (FT) time, and K were computed from both treadmill and accelerometers (Athletic Data Innovations) data. The agreement between treadmill (criterion measure) and accelerometer-derived data was examined. We also compared the ability of the different systems to detect the stride imbalance. Biases were small (CT and K) and moderate (FT). The typical error of the estimate was trivial (CT), small (K) and moderate (FT), with nearly perfect (CT and K) and large (FT) correlations for treadmill <b>vs.</b> accelerometer. The <b>tape</b> induced very large increase in the right - left foot ∆ in CT, FT and K measured by the treadmill. The tape effect on CT and K ∆ measured with the accelerometers were also very large, but of lower magnitude than with the treadmill. The tape effect on accelerometer-derived ∆ FT was unclear. Present data highlight the potential of a GPS-embedded accelerometer to assess CT and K during ground running...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} {{was to determine the}} usefulness of primary representational systems (prs) as a basis for improved comprehension and communication. Primary representational systems were discussed as being cognitive representations of experience which are revealed through auditory (A), visual (V), or kinesthetic (K) language. Specifically, this study tested Bandler and Grinder 2 ̆ 7 s assumption that an identified A, V, or K individual would better comprehend a communication which contained predicates representative of that individual 2 ̆ 7 s prs. Comprehension was operationalized into general information (GI) and specific predicate usage (SPU) segments in order to isolate possible group differences on this dimension. A total of 80 volunteers were screened from undergraduate psychology courses in order to determine individuals 2 ̆ 7 prs. The prs was determined by each individual 2 ̆ 7 s preference for either A, V, or K predicates on a taped language sample. No A individuals were identified and this category was subsequently dropped from the study. Twenty identified 2 ̆ 2 visuals 2 ̆ 2 and 20 identified 2 ̆ 2 kinesthetics 2 ̆ 2 were randomly assigned to either the V or K experimental conditions. These experimental conditions consisted of a test of comprehension given over a role -played, taped therapy session using primarily either V or K predicates. Kuder-Richardson reliability for the V and K tests of comprehension was. 52 and. 70 respectively. It was found that the V and K groups did not differ in their overall comprehension of <b>V</b> and K <b>taped</b> therapy sessions. These groups did differ, however, when the type of comprehension (GI or SPU) factor was considered. Specifically, it was found that V individuals comprehended V SPU questions better than K individuals and that K individuals comprehended K SPU questions better than V individuals. It was also noted that V individuals were relatively worse at comprehending K SPU questions than K individuals were at comprehending V SPU questions. These findings were discussed {{in the context of their}} potential utility in the psychotherapeutic domain. A speculative discussion was offered which suggested language as the mechanism of psychotherapeutic commonality. Future research directions were suggested among which was the possibility of using the visual and tactual-kinesthetic mediums more in psychotherapeutic communication...|$|R
