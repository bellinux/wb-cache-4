A slow leak can be controlled by opening the free flow valve, which will drive a moderate flow of water out of the exhaust <b>valve.</b> A <b>neck</b> dam failure usually has this effect.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Frontometaphyseal dysplasia, or Gorlin-Cohen syndrome, is an X-linked {{disorder}} primarily {{characterized by}} skeletal dysplasia, such as hyperostosis {{of the skull}} and abnormalities of tubular bone modeling. Some patients develop extraskeletal manifestations, such as urinary tract anomalies. Case presentation A 26 -year-old male patient was diagnosed with frontometaphyseal dysplasia and suffered from chronic urine retention. Although the patient was primarily diagnosed with a neurogenic bladder, our work-up revealed posterior urethral <b>valves,</b> bladder <b>neck</b> stenosis, and multiple bladder stones. The patient was treated by transurethral resection of the urethral <b>valves</b> and bladder <b>neck</b> with simultaneous open cystolithotomy to remove the bladder calculi. After removal of the catheter, the patient voided normally and had no post-void residual urine. At the 1 -year follow-up, he was still voiding normally; his urodynamic investigation was also normal. Conclusions In the recent literature, there is scarce information on the diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of patients with malformations of the urinary tract {{as a result of}} Gorlin-Cohen syndrome. The case presented here could guide urological approaches to patients suffering from this rare condition. </p...|$|R
5|$|On November 16, 1993 Schultz had a {{laryngectomy}} {{after having}} had vocal chord tumors removed the previous May. He lost his voice {{for a period}} before regaining it after several months of home recuperation {{with the aid of}} a voice prosthesis that was inserted into a <b>neck</b> <b>valve.</b> Schultz suffered congestive heart failure on November 14, 2011, which required hospital care. He died on November 26, 2011, aged 78.|$|R
5|$|Cylinders {{should not}} be left {{standing}} unattended unless secured {{so that they can}} not fall in reasonably foreseeable circumstances as an impact could damage the cylinder valve mechanism, and conceivably fracture the <b>valve</b> at the <b>neck</b> threads. This is more likely with taper thread valves, and when it happens most of the energy of the compressed gas is released within a second, and can accelerate the cylinder to speeds which can cause severe injury or damage to the surroundings.|$|R
50|$|Ewan has a short {{biography}} {{of his work}} in the accompanying book of the Topic Records 70 year anniversary boxed set Three Score and Ten. Four of his recordings appear in the boxed set, on the fifth CD Go Down You Murderers from Chorus from the Gallows as track four, and on the sixth CD track nine To the Begging I Will Go from Manchester Angel, track fourteen Sixteen Tons with Brian Daly from the single Sixteen Tons/The Swan <b>Necked</b> <b>Valve</b> and track eighteen Dirty Old Town from the single Dirty Old Town/Sheffield Apprentice. One of his songs appears with another act, Come All Ye Fisher Lads by the Fisher Family from their eponymous album as track two on the fourth CD.|$|R
50|$|This is {{a year-round}} active type of lizard, but during winter, its {{activity}} is usually restricted to unseasonably warm days. They may hibernate late September through October. The lizard basks {{in the sun}} with only its head poking out of the sand. The blood is heated within a chamber inside the head. When the blood is hot enough, the reptile opens a <b>valve</b> in its <b>neck</b> and circulates the blood around the body. It looks for shelter from cold temperatures by digging holes in the ground. When it is threatened or captured, it squirts blood from its eye. This blood may have a taste used to deter predators. If the camouflage and intimidation does not work, that is when they squirt out blood aiming for the predators mouth and eyes. This stream can range up to 4 feet and may be repeated several times. The stream comes out through its lower eyelids' pores. Some other defensive behaviors include gulping air and poking with the horns.|$|R
40|$|A 79 -year-old man {{presented}} with a massive subcutaneous swelling due to extreme dilatation ofa subcutaneously interposed right-sided hemicolon; 7 years earlier he had undergone oesophageal resection and gastric tube reconstruction for a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the distal oesophagus. The procedure was complicated by gastric tube necrosis, and the tube was removed. One year later {{the continuity of the}} gastrointestinal tract was restored by a right-sided isoperistaltic colon graft: the terminal ileum, including the ileocecal valve, was anastomosed to the pre-existing cervical portion of the oesophagus. The dilatation was caused by an obstructive adenocarcinoma located in the distal part of the interposed colon in combination with an intact ileocecal <b>valve</b> in the <b>neck.</b> The tumour was a primary colon carcinoma with no evidence of further dissemination. The colon graft was removed, and the patient received a definitive salivary fistula placed in the neck and permanent feeding tube by jejunostomy. Development of primary colon carcinoma in a colon graft is rare; 7 cases {{have been reported in the}} literature so far. Routine endoscopic follow-up of a graft does not appear to be warranted, but endoscopy should be performed if symptoms aris...|$|R
