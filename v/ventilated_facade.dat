40|$|AbstractThe paper investigates {{experimentally}} {{the thermal}} {{performance of a}} ventilated double skin facade (DSF) with phase change material (PCM) in its air channel, during the heating season in the Mediterranean climate. Two identical house-like cubicles located in Puigverd de Lleida (Spain) were monitored during winter 2012, {{and in one of}} them, a <b>ventilated</b> <b>facade</b> with PCM was located in the south wall. The <b>ventilated</b> <b>facade</b> can operate under mechanical or natural ventilation mode and its thermal control depends on the weather conditions and the energetic demand of the building. The experimental results conclude that even though the use of the <b>ventilated</b> <b>facade</b> with PCM improves significantly the thermal behaviour of the whole building (working as a heat supplier in free floating tests, and reducing significantly the electrical consumption of the HVAC systems), these improvements might be increased if a thermal control is used...|$|E

40|$|This study {{describes}} computational {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) modeling of <b>ventilated</b> <b>façade.</b> Ventilated façades are normal façade but it has an extra channel between the concrete wall and the (double skin) façade. Several studies {{found in the literature}} are carried out with CFD simulations about the behavior of the thermodynamic phenomena of the double skin façades systems. These studies conclude that the presence of the air gap in the <b>ventilated</b> <b>façade</b> affects the temperature in the building skin, causing a cooling effect, at least in low-rise buildings. One of the most important factors affecting the thermal effects of ventilated façades is the wind velocity. In this contribution, a CFD analysis applied on two different velocity assumptions for air movement in the air gap of a <b>ventilated</b> <b>façade</b> is presented. A comparison is proposed considering natural wind induced velocity with forced fan induced velocity in the gap. Finally, comparing temperatures in the building skin, the differences between both solutions are described determining that, related to the considered boundary conditions, there is a maximum height in which the thermal effect of the induced flow is significantly observed...|$|E

This paper discusses a simple analytical method for the calculation of the energy saving achievable by using <b>ventilated</b> <b>facades</b> in which the air flow inside the air duct is due to stack effect. Two particular cases of outstanding importance are investigated. The first in which the inner masonry wall is given, and the air duct and the outer facing have to be optimized. The second in which the outer facing is given, and the inner masonry wall and the air duct have to be optimized. The first case can occur in existing buildings renovation, while the second case can occur during the design process.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the thermal {{behaviour}} of a rainscreen <b>ventilated</b> <b>facade</b> {{has been investigated}} both experimentally and numerically. Field measurements were performed during the 2009 / 10 winter season in a test building located in San Mauro Pascoli (Italy) having a squared base of internal dimension of 2. 89 m and a total internal height of 7. 75 m. The external walls of this tower are rainscreen ventilated facades with a 24 cm air cavity and an external side composed of stoneware with open joints.

In this work the modelling of the test building using a dynamic thermal simulation program (ESP-r) is presented and the main results discussed. In order to study the rainscreen <b>ventilated</b> <b>facade</b> three different multi-zone models were defined and the comparison with the experimental results has been used in order to select the best ESP-r air flow network for the modelling of this kind of envelope component. The thermal analysis of this envelope component evidenced that the <b>ventilated</b> <b>facade</b> is able to reverse the direction of the heat flux through the envelope in regions characterized by large solar irradiation during the winter and moderate wind velocity, when the indoor-outdoor air temperature difference is small, thereby reducing the energy consumption required for indoor heating...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{reports the}} {{preliminary}} experimental {{results of an}} hybridization between a classic <b>ventilated</b> <b>facade</b> and photo-voltaic panels powering a Peltier cells system to improve the inner summer comfort with an environmental friendly approach. The outer layer of the facade is made of photovoltaic panels while a pair of light alloy heat exchanger, coupled on the {{opposite sides of the}} Peltier cells, are fitted between the internal space and the air chimney of the facade. The Peltier cells are electrically wired directly with the solar cells: the more the sun affects the front, the more the solar cells produce power to feed the Peltier cells that work as a static heat pump, cooled by the air flowing through the interspace of the <b>ventilated</b> <b>facade.</b> This will result in an inside cooling effect and this effect shall be summed with the well-known passive good performance of the <b>ventilated</b> <b>facade</b> in summer sunny days. During the winter, a simple switch of the power polarity would result in a free inner heating effect, partially using the solar energy incident on the front: the risk of icing on the cold exchanger in the chimney would be reduced because of the heat transmitted by the rear side of the photo-voltaic cells. A small scale prototype has been tested during summer, showing an improvement of the inner air temperature of about 3 - 4 K during the sunniest hours, in comparison with the unequipped case...|$|E

The study of the fluid flow has been carried out by application of 2 D Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) techniques to a facade model specially designed for laboratory measurements. In this work, instantaneous and time averaged velocity fields along the ventilated cavity have been obtained for five different radiation conditions. These results have allowed to obtain a good description of the flow structures. It has been observed that under radiation conditions, the natural thermal convection produces a chimney effect that forces external air to circulate along the air cavity allowing to remove part of the heat of the facade, and thus reducing the heat transferred to the building...|$|R

40|$|Optimal {{transparency}} and daylight {{combined with the}} possibility to apply natural ventilation and a shading device in the cavity in high-rise buildings are main advantages of <b>ventilated</b> double <b>façades</b> over single skin façades. Application of a fully glazed single skin façade often used to result in high energy consumption due to the poor thermal properties of the glazing. The concept of a <b>ventilated</b> double <b>façade</b> is invented {{with the intention of}} improving the thermal qualities of a fully glazed façade. In low-rise buildings the performance of a <b>ventilated</b> double <b>façade</b> can also be achieved with a much cheaper single skin façade, although the costs of glazing rise quickly if a higher sound insulation is needed. It is therefore important to determine which performance has to be achieved in order to choose between a <b>ventilated</b> double <b>façade</b> and a single skin façade.
