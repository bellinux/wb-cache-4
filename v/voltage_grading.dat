In the past, horizontal porcelain wall bushings and large diameter porcelains used for measuring equipment on pole potential contributed to more than 75 % of all flashovers. The flashovers on wall bushings are due to uneven wetting during rain, and occur also at low pollution. The flashovers on the vertical large diameter porcelains are mainly pollution flashovers at fog or light rain.

40|$|A {{hybrid circuit}} breaker {{consists}} of a series-connected vacuum- and SF 6 interrupter. The vacuum interrupter has the function to withstand very steep-rising transient recovery voltages, whereas the SF 6 interrupter is stressed with the peak of it. Full scale tests are described of a 145 -kV prototype, which is subjected to short-line faults based on 63 kA. During these tests, current through the breaker and voltages across both interrupters were monitored with a high-resolution measurement system. It is shown that the principal idea works correctly. From measured results, it is demonstrated that {{the interaction between the}} two arcs of completely different physical nature has a positive effect on the interruption: Immediately before current zero, the SF 6 arc assists the vacuum arc to interrupt, whereas after current zero, the vacuum arc assists the SF 6 arc in the recovery against the recovery voltage. From the analysis of the measurements, it becomes clear that high values of post arc current (up to 30 A) have (at least initially) a positive effect on the breaker performance. Detailed modeling of the interaction of arc-arc and arc-circuit is described, showing a good agreement with the measured results.

A new method, combined chirplet transform with fractal theory, was proposed in this paper, and is taken as the ruler to define fractal dimension, which is used to describe characteristics of signals. Chirplet-fractal dimension is defined as the sum of residues of decomposed signals. The fractal characteristics of leakage current during flashover are obtained from this dimension.

However, the power supply system for metros and light rails is significantly different from that for trunk railways, because it has shorter power supply line, lower <b>voltage</b> <b>grade,</b> and denser traction substations. In order to reduce the impact of negative-sequence current, negative-sequence compensation devices have to be installed at every traction substation.

30|$|The {{promulgation}} {{and promotion}} of IEC 61850 standards has laid a foundation {{for the development of}} smart substation system. It’s generally considered that, the system structure of smart substation consists of station level, bay level and process level [1]. Between station level and bay level is manufacturing message specification (MMS) network, and between bay level and process level is process level network, which includes sampled measured value (SMV) network and generic object oriented substation event (GOOSE) network [2]. Generally, for the sake that protection device detects the faults and abnormal work status of power system correctly and quickly, isolates faulty elements reliably, and ensures the reliable operation of smart substation, SMV network and GOOSE network are physically separated at present [3], and process level network may be divided into multiple physical networks according to <b>voltage</b> <b>grade</b> [4], so as to ensure interference-free analog signal transmission, GOOSE tripping and GOOSE binary acquisition, reduce network flow, and raise real-time property and reliability. However, in this way, the devices on bay level need to provide at least 3 groups of Ethernet interfaces, with one group for MMS network, one for SMV network, and one for GOOSE network, and the substation network will become complicated. In addition, for busbar protection and transformer protection devices, etc. which needs to exchange messages among multiple bays, separated-network of SMV and GOOSE has brought many troubles. With shared-network of SMV and GOOSE [5], related devices may make the best of the information of the whole substation to simplify network structure and enhance efficiency. Also, along with the application of IEEE 1588, synchronization network is eliminated, and the whole substation communication network will be finally unified [6].|$|R

As early as embryonic day 14. 5 (E 14. 5) newly differentiated IHCs express {{a very small}} outward K+ current that is largely insensitive to 4 -aminopyridine (4 -AP). One day later the inward rectifier, IK 1, is first observed. These immature cells initially exhibit only slow <b>graded</b> <b>voltage</b> responses under current clamp. From E 17. 5 spontaneous action potentials occur. During {{the first week of}} postnatal development, the outward K+ current steadily increases in size and a progressively larger fraction of the current is sensitive to 4 -AP. During the second postnatal week, the activation of the 4 -AP-sensitive current, by now contributing about half of the outward K+ current, shifts in the hyperpolarizing direction. Together with an increase in size of IK 1, this hyperpolarizes the cell, thus inhibiting the spontaneous spike activity, although spikes could still be evoked upon depolarizing current injection. Starting at about the onset of hearing (postnatal day 12, P 12) immature IHCs make the final steps towards fully functional sensory receptors with fast <b>graded</b> <b>voltage</b> responses. This is achieved mainly by the expression of the large-conductance Ca 2 +-activated K+ current IK,f, but also of a current indistinguishable from the negatively activating IK,n previously described in mature outer hair cells (OHCs).

Tiny bundles or strands, approximately 80 μm in diameter, of electrically interconnected fibers from the ventricles of rabbit hearts were used in a double sucrose gap. Current records associated with step changes in voltage were complicated by two capacitive surges of current of nodal and nonnodal origin and large “leakage” currents of nonnodal origin resulting mainly from the multifibered nature of the preparation and emphasized by the method. The transient, inward membrane currents in response to moderate depolarizing steps in command potential had the same duration as the upstroke of the action potential. In good runs, currents were smooth and free from notches. These initial currents behaved qualitatively like the initial sodium currents in squid axon and in other excitable membranes. A fraction of the initial sodium current persisted at least as long as 300 ms. The relationship between peak initial current and <b>voltage</b> was <b>graded</b> and linear in the positive direction. In the negative region the relationship was often very steep, indicating insufficient voltage control of all the membranes despite the squareness of the voltage record.

While mammalian retinas can signal visual flicker at 80 - 100 Hz, the time constant, tau, for the refilling of a depleted vesicle release pool at cone photoreceptor ribbons is 0. 7 - 1. 1 s.

To determine {{the mechanism of}} high-frequency signaling, we focused on an "Off" cone bipolar cell type in the ground squirrel, the cb 2, whose transient postsynaptic responses recovered following presynaptic depletion with a tau of similar to 0. 1 s, or 7 - to 10 -fold faster than the tau for presynaptic pool refilling. The difference in recovery time course is caused by AMPA receptor saturation, where partial refilling of the presynaptic pool is sufficient for a full postsynaptic response.

A mutant fly, trpl, was subsequently isolated. Apart from structural differences, the TRP and TRPL channels differ in cation permeability and pharmacological properties.

The metrics assessed were signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and mean effective noise equivalent quanta (eNEQm), all measured using a uniform chest phantom. Subsequent calibration curves were derived to ensure each metric was held constant across the tube voltage range. Each curve was assessed for its clinical appropriateness by generating computer simulated chest images with correct detector air kermas for each tube <b>voltage,</b> and <b>grading</b> these against reference images which were reconstructed at detector air kermas correct for the constant detector dose indicator (DDI) curve currently programmed into the AEC device. All simulated chest images contained clinically realistic projected anatomy and anatomical noise and were scored by experienced image evaluators.

Conversely, constant eNEQm and SNR do appear to provide optimized performance, with the latter being the preferred calibration metric given as it is easier to measure in practice. Medical physicists may use the SNR image quality metric described here when setting up and optimizing AEC devices for chest radiography CR systems with a degree of confidence that resulting clinical image quality will be adequate for the required clinical task.
