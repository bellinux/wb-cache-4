Since saddle have the vital role to support the pressure vessel and to maintain its stability, it should be designed {{in such a way}} that it can afford the <b>vessel</b> <b>load</b> and internal pressure of the vessel due to liquid contained in the vessel. A model of horizontal pressure vessel and saddle support is created in ANSYS. Stresses are calculated using mathematical approach and ANSYS software. The analysis reveals the zone of high localized stress at the junction part of the pressure vessel and saddle support due to operating conditions. The results obtained by both the methods are compared with allowable stress value for safe designing. Keywords—ANSYS, Pressure Vessel, Saddle, Support...|$|E

Currently, there is very little transparency vis-à-vis the logistics challenges in the industry. We extend the literature by creating an overall view of the coherency between logistical methods and project performance. We develop knowledge about how to use the various approaches by analyzing different logistical solutions. A holistic view of the coherency between the approaches in terms of logistics and project performance, taking into consideration the external influence of weather, is provided through analysis of actual projects in the North Sea region. Case study findings reveal the major factors to be pre-assembly, <b>vessel</b> <b>load,</b> and the distance to shore. We suggest a pre-assembly strategy comprised of a minimum number of components for installation onsite and a maximum number of turbines to be loaded on a vessel. These findings are especially important for the new wind farms being positioned further offshore. We show by means of a case study, with specific characteristics and weather conditions, that the appropriate strategies can be arrived at by using a simulation-based decision-support tool we developed...|$|E
40|$|This three-year project (FY 12 - 14) will {{design and}} {{demonstrate}} {{the ability of}} new Magnetic Stress Gages for the measurement of stresses on the inner diameter of a Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessel overwrap. The sensors are being tested at White Sands Testing Facility (WSTF) where {{the results will be}} correlated with a known nondestructive technique acoustic emission. The gages will be produced utilizing Meandering Winding Magnetometer (MWM) and/or MWM array eddy current technology. The ultimate goal is to utilize this technology for the health monitoring of Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessels for all future flight programs. The first full-scale pressurization test was performed at WSTF in June 2012. The goals of this test were to determine adaptations of the magnetic stress gauge instrumentation that would be necessary to allow multiple sensors to monitor the vessel's condition simultaneously and to determine how the sensor response changes with sensor selection and orientation. The second full scale pressurization test was performed at WSTF in August 2012. The goals of this test were to monitor the vessel's condition with multiple sensors simultaneously, to determine the viability of the multiplexing units (MUX) for the application, and to determine if the sensor responses in different orientations are repeatable. For both sets of tests the vessel was pressured up to 6, 000 psi to simulate maximum operating pressure. Acoustic events were observed during the first pressurization cycle. This suggested that the extended storage period prior to use of this bottle led to a relaxation of the residual stresses imparted during auto-frettage. The pressurization tests successfully demonstrated the use of multiplexers with multiple MWM arrays to monitor a vessel. It was discovered that depending upon the sensor orientation, the frequencies, and the sense element, the MWM arrays can provide a variety of complementary information about the composite overwrapped pressure <b>vessel</b> <b>load</b> conditions. For example, low frequency measurements can be used to monitor the overwrap thickness and changes associated with pressure level. High frequency data is dominated by the properties of the overwrap, including the fiber orientations and lay-up of the layers...|$|E

40|$|This thesis report {{documents}} {{an investigation}} into the electrical engineering aspects and design considerations pertinent to the maritime industry and, in particular, to ship building. The investigation is a review of the electrical power systems of a 35 metre search and rescue (SAR) vessel designed and constructed for the Philippines coast guard by BAE Systems at its Henderson shipbuilding facility in Perth, Western Australia. The purpose of reviewing the electrical systems of the 35 M vessel is to provide a platform from which future vessels of similar class, size and operational purpose can be designed. The electrical engineering design aspects include an introductory description of the rules for classification for which vessels are constructed and in particular that of the 35 M SAR vessel and the structure of project management and the interrelationships between different engineering and design departments which are involved in the 35 M SAR shipbuilding process. The re-validation of the electrical engineering systems includes the use of the existing 35 M SAR vessels load demand to determine generator sizing, three phase motor starting arrangements, cabling, protection and DC emergency power systems, all of which are referenced against classification rules and international standards requirements where applicable. The document is constructed in a systematic way which allows the reader to identify the design processes involved in the 35 M SAR vessel. Its order may not specifically represent the order for which the electrical design is carried out; additionally it does not include specific mechanical or architectural design detail. However generalised detail is included, where applicable, in order to provide background information. It has been shown that a systematic approach to shipbuilding and a constructive and professional relationship between various engineering and design departments is paramount to the successful construction of a maritime vessel. It was additionally identified that during the electrical engineering design process, assumptions are made based on past experiences and practical appreciation for <b>vessel</b> <b>load</b> demands during normal operational conditions, which ultimately ensures system loading is reduced while still maintaining operational requirements of the vessel. It is however identified that over-sizing of some items, such as cables, is deliberate in order to reduce installation errors and potential product availability issues...|$|E

H 577 P LMS 2017 Xiaviii, 103 pages :color illustrationsLiner {{shipping}} network {{design is}} a comprehensive decision problem for the carrier to plan their service operations. A series of related decisions from tactical and operational levels are coordinated to maximize the profits. In this thesis, we study two network design problems for carriers in liner shipping. The first work focuses on the joint decision makings for the network design, in which a general fuel consumption function is assumed. The second work studies the solution to a compact optimization model for the network design, in which the transshipment cost is taken into account. In this thesis, we have developed novel optimization techniques to solve both problems. In the first study, we develop a mathematical programming model that addresses fleet deployment, speed optimization, and cargo allocation jointly, so as to maximize total profits for carriers at the strategic level. To capture fuel costs precisely, our model adopts a general fuel consumption function that depends on both vessel speed and <b>vessel</b> <b>load.</b> To overcome intractability caused by nonlinear terms in the model, we separate fuel consumption costs into two terms associated with ship speed and ship load, respectively, so as to obtain a mixed integer linear programming formulation for approximation. Based on column generation techniques, we develop an iterative search algorithm that adaptively reorganizes the approximated formulation. We conduct extensive experiments using generated data sets from actual liner shipping services in {{different regions of the}} world to show the effectiveness of our approach as well as the significant impact of speed-load factors on fuel consumptions. Managerial insights are obtained by testing the model under different scenarios, which may greatly assist decision makers in the liner shipping industry. In the second study, we study a problem that aims at creating a set of regular services for a designated fleet of oceangoing ships to transport the containerized cargos among seaports. Containers can be transshipped from one ship to another at an intermediate port in order to improve the transportation efficiency. The objective of the problem is to maximize the revenues from the satisfied demands while minimizing the operating cost including the transshipment cost. For this issue, many solution methods known to be effective for problems assuming zero transshipment cost cannot directly apply, because the calculation of transshipment cost has significantly complicated the problem and its mathematical formulation. To tackle this challenge, we develop for this problem a new compact mixed-integer linear programming model. However, the new model may contain exponentially many variables and constraints, making its solution very challenging. Therefore, we propose a novel application of simultaneous column-and-row generation to solve the linear programming relaxation of the new model, so as to derive an upper bound for the profit of an optimal network design. Based on this, we have developed a branch-and-price to find optimal or near-optimal integer solutions for this problem. Results from experiments have shown the effectiveness and efficiency of our models and solution methods. Department of Logistics and Maritime StudiesPh.

40|$|Transportation is {{commonly}} {{seen as a}} necessary function, but not as a value-giving process and is therefore sometimes considered a waste. This has led to more industrial companies choose to outsource and to focus on their core competencies. Though, {{there is a growing}} trend of insourcing processes as the outsourcing has not generated the expected results. Since year 1977 Holmen Paper Braviken has outsourced parts of its <b>vessel</b> <b>loading</b> process to NHS. Due to decreasing profitability, Holmen Paper Braviken have gotten more aware of its costs and are now suspecting that the cost of NHS services are too high and that there might be cheaper alternatives. The purpose of this master thesis is to look into if it would be profitable for Holmen Paper to take over NHS work and to carry out the <b>vessel</b> <b>loading</b> themselves. The results shall serve as an economical basis for future negotiations with NHS. Boat transportation stands for a third of all the goods transportations and <b>vessel</b> <b>loading</b> is often conducted twice a week. Braviken {{is in charge of the}} work in the warehouse during <b>vessel</b> <b>loading,</b> whilst NHS is in charge of transporting and loading the paper on the boat. Holmen Paper Braviken pays a stevedoring fee, goods- and harbor dues for NHS services. The stevedoring fee stands for about 62 % of the total cost and is the only fee that is affected by an insourcing decision. If Holmen Paper Braviken were to insource, they would have to invest in new machinery equipment and employ more personnel that can replace NHS resources. The conclusion is that there exists a large savings opportunity if Holmen Paper Braviken would to insource the <b>vessel</b> <b>loading.</b> The increase of capacity that insourcing would bring could improve the work rotation by varying the truck drivers everyday tasks. Insourcing would also give more time to maintenance, which could counteract stone damages on the paper and reduce the wear of the machinery equipment. The increased capacity would though increase the personnel cost, which prolongs the pay- back time for the company to start profiting. With the current circumstances Holmen Paper Braviken is therefore recommended not to insource the <b>vessel</b> <b>loading</b> with own personnel. In order to reduce personnel costs, flexible staffing is required as the utilization rate of full- time staff is low, which results in a high cost per ton. The most profitable alternative is to recruit two full- time truck drivers to Braviken and to hire three truck drivers from Pema. The difficulty with this option is to find extracurricular work for the full- time truck drivers during days without <b>vessel</b> <b>loading,</b> which may reduce overtime at the mill. Therefore, it is less risk to let the external personnel be responsible for the <b>vessel</b> <b>loading,</b> as Holmen Paper Braviken only needs to pay for the labor time during <b>vessel</b> <b>loading.</b> NHS has carried out stevedoring work for many years and holds great skills in dock work, which justifies a continued partnership with NHS. This option provides a relatively short payback time, but will then bring high annual savings for the company. Therefore Holmen Paper Braviken is recommended to invest in new machinery, but to outsource the labor work of <b>vessel</b> <b>loading</b> to NHS. For future research Holmen Paper Braviken should investigate if a capacity increase will reduce overtime costs at the mill. If so, insourcing with full- time employees can be profitable. Another area worth investigating is how a reallocation of capacity for the different transport modes can influence the decision of insourcing. If it is possible to release more capacity for <b>vessel</b> <b>loading,</b> the need of employing new personnel would decrease. Validerat; 20160626 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R
