50|$|A rotary shutter {{is located}} {{outboard}} {{of the outer}} collimator assembly. The shutter is fabricated using carbon steel and high-density concrete. The purpose of the shutter is to provide shielding when the neutron beam is not required. The shutter has provisions for routing the cryogenic hydrogen transfer line, gaseous helium, and <b>vacuum</b> <b>piping</b> necessary to support the Cold Source.|$|E
50|$|Generally {{a manual}} boost {{controller}} {{will not be}} located within the cabin of the vehicle as the lengthy <b>vacuum</b> <b>piping</b> run between the turbo/wastegate & controller can introduce response issues into the system. It is possible to use two manual boost controllers at different settings with a solenoid to switch between them for two different boost pressure settings. Some factory turbocharged cars have a switch to regulate boost pressure, such as a setting designed for fuel economy and a setting for performance.|$|E
40|$|The {{inner vessel}} heads {{including}} bypass and beam tubes {{had just been}} welded into place and dye penetrant checked. The vacuum heads were not on at this time but the vacuum shell was on covering the piping penetrating into the inner vessel. Signal boxes with all feed through boards, the instrumentation box, and high voltage boxes were all installed with their pump outs capped. All 1 / 4 -inch instrumentation lines were terminated at their respective shutoff valves. All <b>vacuum</b> <b>piping</b> used for pumping down the inner vessel was isolated using o-ring sealed blind flanges. PV 215 A (VAT Series 12), the 4 -inch VRC gate valve isolating the cyropump, and the rupture disk {{had to be removed}} and replaced with blind flanges before pressurizing due to their pressure limitations. Stresses in plates used as blind flanges were checked using Code calcualtions. Before the CC test, vacuum style blanks and clamps were hydrostatically pressure tested to 150 % of the maximum test pressure, 60 psig. The Code inspector and Research Division Safety had all given their approval to the test pressure and procedure prior to filling the vessel with argon. The test was a major success. Based on the lack of any distinguishable pressure drop indicated on the pressure gages, the vessel appeared to be structurally sound throughout the duration of the test (approx. 3 hrs.). A major leak in the instrumentation tubing was discovered at half of the maximum test pressure and was quickly isolated by crimping and capping with a compression fitting. There were some slight deviations in the actual procedure used. The 44 psig relief valve located just outside the cleanroom had to be capped until the pressure in the vessel indicated 38 psi. This was to allow higher supply pressures and hence, higher flows through the pressurizing line. Also, in order to get pressure readings at the cryostat without exposing any personnel to the potentially dangerous stored energy near the maximum test pressure, a camera was installed {{at the top of the}} vessel to view the indicator mounted there. The monitor was viewed at the ante room adjacent to the cleanroom. The holding pressure of 32 psig (4 / 5 of the maximum test pressure) was only maintained for about 20 minutes instead of the half hour recommendation in the procedure. We felt that this was sufficient time to Snoop test and perform the pressure drop test. After the test was completed, the inspector for CBI Na-Con and the Research Divison Safety Officer signed all of required documentation...|$|E
40|$|For long installations, <b>vacuum</b> {{jacketed}} <b>piping</b> {{often comes}} in 40 foot sections that are butt welded {{together in the}} field. A short can is then welded over the bare pipe connection to allow for insulation {{to be protected from}} the environment. Traditionally, the field joint is insulated with multilayer insulation and a vacuum is pulled on the can to minimize heat leak through the bare section and prevent frost from forming on the pipe section. The vacuum jacketed lines for the Ares I mobile launch platform were to be a combined 2000 feet long, with 60 + pipe sections and field joint cans. Historically, Kennedy Space Center has drilled a hole in the long sections to create a common vacuum with the field joint can to minimize maintenance on the <b>vacuum</b> jacketed <b>piping.</b> However, this effort looked at ways to use a passive system that didn't require a vacuum, but may cryopump to create its own vacuum. Various forms of aerogel, multilayer insulations, and combinations thereof were tested to determine the best method of insulating the field joint while minimizing maintenance and thermal losses...|$|R

40|$|The Liquid Nitrogen Test Facility is {{a unique}} test {{facility}} for ground-based liquid nitrogen experimentation. The test rig consists of an insulated tank of approximately 12. 5 cubic ft in volume, which is supplied with liquid nitrogen from a 300 gal dewar via a <b>vacuum</b> jacketed <b>piping</b> system. The test tank is fitted with pressure and temperature measuring instrumentation, and with two view ports which allow visual observation of test conditions. To demonstrate {{the capabilities of the}} facility, the initial test program is briefly described. The objective of the test program is to measure the condensation rate by injecting liquid nitrogen as a subcooled spray into the ullage of a tank 50 percent full of liquid nitrogen at saturated conditions.

40|$|A superconducting RF test {{facility}} (STF) is being constructed at KEK for R&D oriented toward the International Linear Collider (ILC). [1] Under KEK's guidance, Hitachi, Ltd. has manufactured cryostat components at its factory and completed final assembly in the STF Linac Building at KEK. The STF cryomodule {{consists of two}} cryostats, each about six meters long based on the TESLA-TTF-type III design. Each cryostat can house four 9 -cell cavities, each one meter in length. [2] This report outlines the flow of manufacturing from the factory to final assembly, and describes the manufacturing of equipment, assembly precision, and other matters. EQUIPMENT CONFIGURATION This paper first briefly describes the components and specifications of the STF cryomodule. Overall Configuration Figure 1 is an overall diagram of the STF cryomodule; Figure 2 shows the cross-sectional structure. The equipment {{is characterized by the}} connection of two relatively short cryostats to efficiently conduct performance tests on two different kinds of cavities. The major components of those cryostats are vacuum vessels, support posts, 80 K radiation shields, 5 K radiation shields, a helium gas return pipe, cryogenic piping, cavity helium vessels, RF input couplers, and various types of measuring devices and sensors. <b>Vacuum</b> vessels, cryogenic <b>piping,</b> support posts, and radiation shields are based on TTF design, whereas cavities, input couplers, tuners, and WPM have been designed by KEK...|$|R
40|$|NASA Stennis Space Center's (SSC's) large {{rocket engine}} test {{facility}} requires {{the use of}} liquid propellants, including the use of cryogenic fluids like liquid hydrogen as fuel, and liquid oxygen as an oxidizer (gases which have been liquefied at very low temperatures). These fluids require special handling, storage, and transfer technology. The biggest problem associated with transferring cryogenic liquids is product loss due to heat transfer. <b>Vacuum</b> jacketed <b>piping</b> is specifically designed to maintain high thermal efficiency so that cryogenic liquids can be transferred with minimal heat transfer. A vacuum jacketed pipe is essentially two pipes in one. There is an inner carrier pipe, in which the cryogenic liquid is actually transferred, and an outer jacket pipe that supports and seals the vacuum insulation, forming the "vacuum jacket. " The integrity of the vacuum jacketed transmission lines that transfer the cryogenic fluid from delivery barges to the test stand must be maintained prior to and during engine testing. To monitor the vacuum in these vacuum jacketed transmission lines, vacuum gauge readings are used. At SSC, vacuum gauge measurements are done on a manual rotation basis with two technicians, each using a handheld instrument. Manual collection of vacuum data is labor intensive and uses valuable personnel time. Additionally, there are times when personnel cannot collect the data in a timely fashion (i. e., when a leak is detected, measurements must be taken more often). Additionally, distribution of this data to all interested parties can be cumbersome. To simplify the vacuum-gauge data collection process, automate the data collection, and decrease the labor costs associated with acquiring these measurements, an automated system that monitors the existing gauges was developed by Invocon, Inc. For this project, Invocon developed a Wireless Integrated Microelectronic Vacuum Sensor System (WIMVSS) that provides the ability to gather vacuum-gauge measurements automatically and wirelessly, in near-real time - using a low-maintenance, lowpower sensor mesh network. The WIMVSS operates by using a self-configuring mesh network of wireless sensor units. Mesh networking is a type of networking where each sensor or node can capture and disseminate its own data, but also serve as a relay to receive and transmit data from other sensors. Each sensor node can synchronize with adjacent sensors, and propagate data from one sensor to the next, until the destination is reached. In this case, the destination is a Network Interface Unit (NIU). The WIMVSS sensors are mounted on the existing vacuum gauges. Information gathered by the sensors is sent to the NIU. Because of the mesh networking, if a sensor cannot directly send the data to the NIU, it can be propagated through the network of sensors. The NIU requires antenna access to the sensor units, AC power, and an Ethernet connection. The NIU bridges the sensor network to a WIMVSS server via an Ethernet connection. The server is configured with a database, a Web server, and proprietary interface software that makes it possible for the vacuum measurements from vacuum jacketed fluid lines to be saved, retrieved, and then displayed from any Web-enabled PC that has access to the Internet. Authorized users can then simply access the data from any PC with Internet connection. Commands can also be sent directly from the Web interface for control and maintenance of the sensor network. The technology enabled by the WIMVSS decreases labor required for gathering vacuum measurements, increases access to vacuum data by making it available on any computer with access to the Internet, increases the frequency with which data points can be acquired for evaluating the system, and decreases the recurring cost of the sensors by using off-the-shelf components and integrating these with heritage vacuum gauges...|$|R
