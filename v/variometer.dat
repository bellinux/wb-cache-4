5|$|The player {{may choose}} to begin flight on a runway or taxiway, or in the air. Aircraft are {{controlled}} via keyboard, joystick, head-mounted display or specialized input devices such as pedals. During flight, several third- and first-person camera angles may be selected. For example, the third-person Flyby View places the camera {{in front of the}} plane as it flies past, while the first-person Three-Way View displays more information about the plane's position and speed than other angles. Certain camera angles, including the Three-Way View and 3-D Cockpit view, provide the player with simulated flight instruments such as an altimeter, airspeed indicator, accelerometer, <b>variometer</b> and tachometer. The game is designed to allow players to perform aerobatic maneuvers such as the Immelmann turn, tailslide, Lomcevak and Cuban Eight. Performances may be recorded and played back, with controls that allow the player to pause, rewind and fast forward. At any time, the player may stop a recording and resume flight from that point.|$|E
500|$|When the air {{has little}} {{moisture}} or when an inversion stops {{the warm air}} from rising high enough for the moisture to condense, thermals do not create cumulus clouds. Without clouds or dust devils to mark the thermals, thermals are not always associated with any feature on the ground. The pilot must then use both skill and luck to find them using a sensitive vertical speed indicator called a <b>variometer</b> that quickly indicates climbs and descents. Occasionally reliable thermals {{can be found in}} the exhaust gases from power stations or from fires.|$|E
500|$|Soaring pioneer Paul MacCready {{is usually}} {{credited}} with developing mathematical principles for optimizing {{the speed at}} which to fly when cross-country soaring, although it was first described by Wolfgang Späte in 1938. The speed to fly theory allows the optimal cruising speed between thermals to be computed, using thermal strength, glider performance and other variables. It accounts for the fact that if a pilot flies faster between thermals, the next thermal is reached sooner. However at higher speeds the glider also sinks faster, requiring the pilot to spend more time circling to regain the altitude. The MacCready speed represents the optimal trade-off between cruising and circling. Most competition pilots use MacCready theory to optimize their average speeds, and have the calculations programmed in their flight computers, or use a [...] "McCready ring", a rotatable bezel on the glider's <b>variometer</b> to indicate the best speed to fly. The greatest factor in maximizing average speed, however, remains the ability of the pilot to find the strongest lift.|$|E
50|$|Most modern {{sailplanes}} {{are equipped}} with Total Energy compensated <b>variometers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Most pilots use <b>variometers,</b> radios, and, increasingly, GPS units when flying.|$|R

500|$|The <b>variometer,</b> {{also known}} as the {{vertical}} speed indicator (VSI) or the vertical velocity indicator (VVI), is the pitot-static instrument used {{to determine whether or not}} an aircraft is flying in level flight. [...] The vertical speed specifically shows the rate of climb or the rate of descent, which is measured in feet per minute or meters per second. [...] The vertical speed is measured through a mechanical linkage to a diaphragm located within the instrument. [...] The area surrounding the diaphragm is vented to the static port through a calibrated leak (which also may be known as a [...] "restricted diffuser"). [...] When the aircraft begins to increase altitude, the diaphragm will begin to contract at a rate faster than that of the calibrated leak, causing the needle to show a positive vertical speed. [...] The reverse of this situation is true when an aircraft is descending. [...] The calibrated leak varies from model to model, but the average time for the diaphragm to equalize pressure is between 6 and 9 seconds.|$|E
2500|$|The Wien's open cockpit {{was ahead}} of the wing leading edge. [...] There was no {{windscreen}} and the instruments, including the still novel <b>variometer</b> were displayed horizontally, inset into the fuselage immediately {{in front of the}} pilot. The undercarriage consisted of a single enclosed skid and a small spring tailskid. [...] The rear fixed surfaces, ply covered, were very narrow, though the root of the fin was carefully faired into the fuselage. The tapered control surfaces were fabric covered.|$|E
2500|$|In 1930 Hirth took Musterle to the US National Championships held at Harris Hill, New York {{equipped}} with a <b>variometer,</b> an instrument unknown outside Germany and previously only used by Robert Kronfeld in the RRG Professor two years earlier. On 5 October he flew a cross country, blue sky thermal flight for the first time. [...] The following spring, on 10 March 1931, he flew over New York using ridge lift from the Hudson River until signalled to come down by police because he was causing a traffic hazard.|$|E
50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} popular brands of R/C <b>variometers</b> are the Picolario and the Pitlab SkyAssistant.|$|R
50|$|Very few powered {{aircraft}} have {{total energy}} <b>variometers.</b> The pilot of a powered aircraft {{is more interested}} in the true rate of change of altitude, as he often wants to hold a constant altitude or maintain a steady climb or descent.|$|R
5000|$|Gliders' <b>variometers</b> are {{sometimes}} fitted with mechanical {{devices such as}} a [...] "MacCready Ring" [...] to indicate the optimal speed to fly for given conditions. These devices {{are based on the}} mathematical theory attributed to Paul MacCready though it was first described by Wolfgang Späte in 1938. MacCready theory solves the problem of how fast a pilot should cruise between thermals, given both the average lift the pilot expects in the next thermal climb, as well as the amount of lift or sink he encounters in cruise mode. Electronic <b>variometers</b> make the same calculations automatically, after allowing for factors such as the glider's theoretical performance, water ballast, headwinds/tailwinds and insects on the leading edges of the wings.|$|R
2500|$|When {{a current}} flows through a thermistor, it will {{generate}} heat which {{will raise the}} temperature of the thermistor above that of its environment. If the thermistor is being used to measure {{the temperature of the}} environment, this electrical heating may introduce a significant error if a correction is not made. Alternatively, this effect itself can be exploited. [...] It can, for example, make a sensitive air-flow device employed in a sailplane rate-of-climb instrument, the electronic <b>variometer,</b> or serve as a timer for a relay as was formerly done in telephone exchanges.|$|E
50|$|A {{second type}} of {{compensated}} <b>variometer</b> is the Netto or airmass <b>variometer.</b> In addition to TE compensation, the Netto <b>variometer</b> adjusts for the intrinsic sink rate of the glider at a given speed (the polar curve) adjusted for the wing loading due to water ballast. The Netto <b>variometer</b> will always read zero in still air. This provides the pilot with the accurate measurement of air mass vertical movement critical for final glides (the last glide to the ultimate destination location).|$|E
5000|$|Variometers {{also became}} {{important}} in foot-launch hang gliding, where the open-to-air pilot hears the wind but needs the <b>variometer</b> {{to help him}} or her to detect regions of rising or sinking air. In early hang gliding, variometers were not needed for the short flights or flights close to ridge lift. But the <b>variometer</b> became key as pilots began making longer flights. The first portable <b>variometer</b> for use in hang gliders was the Colver <b>Variometer</b> by Colver Soaring Instruments [...] which served to extend the sport into cross-country thermal flying.|$|E

50|$|Absolute magnetometers {{measure the}} {{absolute}} magnitude or vector magnetic field, using an internal calibration or known physical constants {{of the magnetic}} sensor. Relative magnetometers measure magnitude or vector magnetic field relative to a fixed but uncalibrated baseline. Also called <b>variometers,</b> relative magnetometers are used to measure variations in magnetic field.|$|R

An ASK-23 is available for early solo pilots, while an Astir provides pilot progression and an ASW-19 is provided for cross-country rated pilots. All Club gliders have similar instrumentation and are equipped with audio <b>variometers.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In modern gliders, most {{electronic}} variometers {{generate a}} sound whose pitch and rhythm {{depends on the}} instrument reading. Typically the audio tone increases in frequency as the <b>variometer</b> shows {{a higher rate of}} climb and decreases in frequency towards a deep groan as the <b>variometer</b> shows a faster rate of descent. When the <b>variometer</b> is showing a climb, the tone is often chopped and the rate of chopping may be increased as the climb rate increases, while during a descent the tone is not chopped. The vario is typically silent in still air or in lift which is weaker than the typical sink rate of the glider at minimum sink. This audio signal allows the pilot to concentrate on the external view instead of having to watch the instruments, thus improving safety and also giving the pilot more opportunity to search for promising looking clouds and other signs of lift. A <b>variometer</b> that produces this type of audible tone is known as an [...] "audio variometer".|$|E
50|$|It {{is useful}} for a pilot to know the rate of climb of air in a thermal. They can use this to find the strongest area of lift in the thermal. A <b>variometer</b> {{can be used to}} measure the rate of ascent of an aircraft. However, a simple <b>variometer</b> does not {{actually}} measure the lift in the thermal, it measures the rate of ascent of the aircraft. So a pilot may be inside a thermal that is moving upwards at 2 metres per second, but the pilot may be diving their aircraft at 2 metres per second. So the <b>variometer</b> shows zero rate of climb, and does not indicate the presence of the thermal.|$|E
5000|$|The designs {{described}} above, which {{measure the}} rate of change of altitude by automatically detecting the change in static pressure as the aircraft changes altitude are referred to as [...] "uncompensated" [...] <b>variometers.</b> The term [...] "vertical speed indicator" [...] or [...] "VSI" [...] is most often used for the instrument when it is installed in a powered aircraft. The term [...] "variometer" [...] is most often used when the instrument is installed in a glider or sailplane.|$|R
50|$|Advanced {{electronic}} <b>variometers</b> in gliders {{can present}} other {{information to the}} pilot from GPS receivers. The display can thus show the bearing, distance and height required to reach an objective. In cruise mode (used in straight flight), the vario can also give an audible indication of the correct speed to fly {{depending on whether the}} air is rising or sinking. The pilot merely has to input the estimated MacCready setting, which is the expected rate of climb in the next acceptable thermal.|$|R
5000|$|Irving was Chairman of the {{technical}} committee of the British Gliding Association for 25 years. He was also active in the Organisation Scientifique et Technique du Vol à Voile (OSTIV). He presented twenty-one technical papers at OSTIV congresses. [...] He developed the Irving Tube to provide glider <b>variometers</b> with total energy compensation so glider pilots have accurate information about {{the rise and fall}} of the air in which they are flying.He was closely associated with development of the Sigma, a very-high-performance experimental glider.|$|R
50|$|Compensated variometers {{also include}} {{information}} about {{the speed of the}} aircraft, so the total energy (potential and kinetic) is used, not just the change in altitude. For example, if a pilot pushes forward on the stick, speeding up as the plane dives, an uncompensated <b>variometer</b> only indicates that altitude is being lost. But the pilot could pull back on the stick, trading the extra speed for altitude again. A compensated <b>variometer</b> uses both speed and altitude to indicate the change in total energy. So the pilot that pushes the stick forward, diving to gain speed, and then pulls back again to regain altitude will notice no change in total energy on a compensated <b>variometer</b> (neglecting energy loss due to drag).|$|E
5000|$|The minimal {{instrumentation}} {{required is}} an airspeed indicator and a <b>variometer.</b> The pilot {{will use the}} polar curve information for the particular glider to derive the exact speeds to fly depending on the lift and sink conditions in which the glider is flying. This is commonly done using a speed to fly ring (known as a 'MacCready Ring') which is fitted around the aircraft's <b>variometer.</b> The ring is usually calibrated in either knots or meters per second and its markings {{are based on the}} aircraft's polar curve. [...] During the glide between thermals, the index arrow is set at the rate of climb expected in the next thermal. On the speed ring, the <b>variometer</b> needle points to the optimum speed to fly between thermals.|$|E

5000|$|Human beings, unlike {{birds and}} other flying animals, {{are not able}} {{directly}} to sense climb and sink rates. Before {{the invention of the}} <b>variometer,</b> sailplane pilots found it very hard to soar. Although they could readily detect abrupt changes in vertical speed ("in the seat of the pants"), their senses did not allow them to distinguish lift from sink, or strong lift from weak lift. The actual climb/sink rate could not even be guessed at, unless there was some clear fixed visual reference nearby. Being near a fixed reference means being near to a hillside, or to the ground. Except when hill-soaring (exploiting the lift close to the up-wind side of a hill), these are generally very unprofitable positions for glider pilots to be in. The most useful forms of lift (thermal and wave lift) are found at higher altitudes and it is very hard for a pilot to detect or exploit them without the use of a <b>variometer.</b> After the <b>variometer</b> was invented in 1929 by Alexander Lippisch and Robert Kronfeld, the sport of gliding moved into a new realm.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Variometers</b> {{are also}} used in radio {{controlled}} gliders. Typically it {{takes the form of}} a radio transmitter in the model, and a receiver held by the pilot on the ground. Depending on the design, the receiver may give the pilot the current altitude of the model (an altimeter) and some sort of display that indicates if the plane is gaining or losing altitude—often via a tone just like in full scale gliders. Other forms of telemetry may also be provided by the system, displaying parameters such as airspeed and battery voltage. Varios used in radio controlled planes may or may not feature total energy compensation (the better/more expensive ones generally do.) ...|$|R

The causes of this inconsistency might be {{the differences between the two}} pillars installed with two independent absolute instruments and instrument problems in some of the observatories.
