40|$|The {{popularity}} of trucks {{in the class}} 2 category [...] that is, those with a 6, 000 to 10, 000 pounds (lbs) {{gross vehicle weight rating}} (GVWR) [...] has increased since the late 1970 s/early 1980 s. The purpose of this research is to identify and examine vehicles in the upper portion of the class 2 weight range (designated as <b>vehicle</b> <b>class</b> 2 <b>b)</b> and to assess their impact. <b>Vehicles</b> in <b>class</b> 2 <b>b</b> (8, 500 - 10, 000 lbs GVWR) include pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles (SUVs), and large vans (i. e., not minivans). Oak Ridge National Laboratory researched each individual truck model to determine which models were <b>class</b> 2 <b>b</b> trucks and arrived at four methodologies to derive sales volumes. Two methods [...] one for calendar year and one for model year sales [...] were recommended for producing believable and reliable results. The study indicates that 521, 000 <b>class</b> 2 <b>b</b> trucks were sold in calendar year 1999 [...] 6. 4 % of sales of all trucks under 10, 000 lbs. Eighty-two percent of <b>class</b> 2 <b>b</b> trucks sold in 1999 were pickups; one third of <b>class</b> 2 <b>b</b> trucks sold in 1999 were diesel. There were 5. 8 million <b>class</b> 2 <b>b</b> trucks on the road in 2000, which amounts to 7. 8 % of all trucks under 10, 000 lbs. Twenty-four percent of the <b>class</b> 2 <b>b</b> truck population is diesel. Estimates show that <b>class</b> 2 <b>b</b> trucks account for 8 % of annual miles traveled by trucks under 10, 000 lbs and 9 % of fuel use. Data on <b>class</b> 2 <b>b</b> trucks are scarce. As the Tier 2 standards, which apply to passenger vehicles in the 8, 500 - 10, 000 lb GVWR category, become effective, additional data on <b>class</b> 2 <b>b</b> trucks may become available [...] not only emissions data, but data in all areas. At the moment, distinguishing <b>class</b> 2 <b>b</b> trucks from <b>class</b> 2 trucks in general is a substantial task requiring data on an individual model level...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{ability of}} a {{pavement}} structure in carrying out its function reduces {{in line with the}} increase of traffic load, especially if there are overloaded heavy vehicle passing through the road. In this thesis, the effect of overloaded vehicles on the road pavement service life was analyzed using the AASHTO 1993. Vehicle damage factor (VDF) and Structural Number (SN) were calculated on normal and overloading conditions. Remaining of pavement service life due to overloading condition was also presented. So it can be concluded how severe the effect of overloaded vehicles against pavement service life. In this thesis it can be seen, that the presence of overloaded vehicles, particularly heavy <b>vehicles</b> (<b>class</b> 6 <b>B</b> up to <b>class</b> 7 C according to Bina Marga’s vehicle classification) resulted in traffic load (W 18) value that was 200...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{proposes a}} new model to {{estimate}} the mean and covariance of stochastic multi-class (multiple <b>vehicle</b> <b>classes)</b> origin-destination (OD) demands from hourly classified traffic counts throughout the whole year. It is usually assumed in the conventional OD demand estimation models that the OD demand by <b>vehicle</b> <b>class</b> is deterministic. Little attention is given on the estimation of the statistical properties of stochastic OD demands {{as well as their}} covariance between different <b>vehicle</b> <b>classes.</b> Also, the interactions between different <b>vehicle</b> <b>classes</b> in OD demand are ignored such as the change of modes between private car and taxi during a particular hourly period over the year. To fill these two gaps, the mean and covariance matrix of stochastic multi-class OD demands for the same hourly period over the year are simultaneously estimated by a modified lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) method. The estimated covariance matrix of stochastic multi-class OD demands can be used to capture the statistical dependency of traffic demands between different <b>vehicle</b> <b>classes.</b> In this paper, the proposed model is formulated as a non-linear constrained optimization problem. An exterior penalty algorithm is adapted to solve the proposed model. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the applications of the proposed model together with some insightful findings on the importance of covariance of OD demand between difference <b>vehicle</b> <b>classes...</b>|$|R
