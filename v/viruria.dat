40|$|Background: Although early {{monitoring}} of BK virus infection in renal transplant patients {{has led to}} improved outcomes over the past decade, it remains unclear whether monitoring for viremia is the best screening tool for BK virus nephropathy (BKVN). Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of the medical records of 368 renal transplant recipients who had a minimum of 18  months of posttransplantation follow-up. The relationship between the presence of BK <b>viruria</b> and a composite end point of BK viremia/BKVN was established, and the predictive value of high-grade BK <b>viruria</b> for development of viremia/BKVN was determined. Results: High grade of BK <b>viruria</b> was present in 110 (30. 1 %) of the renal transplant recipients. BK viremia/BKVN was present in 64 (17. 4 %) patients and was 50 {{times more likely to}} be present in patients with high-grade BK <b>viruria.</b> The risk of developing BK viremia/BKVN was 3 times higher in high-grade <b>viruria</b> patients, and <b>viruria</b> preceded viremia by nearly 7  weeks.

Objectives: To investigate the clinical {{significance of}} high-level JCPyV <b>viruria</b> and JCPyV primary infections after kidney transplantation. Study design: JCPyV <b>viruria</b> was detected in routine screening by quantitative real-time PCR in 40 / 238 kidney transplant recipients and was high-level (> 10 (7) copies/ml) in 17 patients. A protocol biopsy {{at the time}} of JCPyV <b>viruria</b> was available from 10 patients. Results: Peak urine viral loads were 1. 0 x 10 (7) - 2. 5 x 10 (9) copies/ml in the 17 high-level <b>viruria</b> patients. 6 / 15 (40 %) patients with high-level JCPyV <b>viruria</b> with pretransplant sera available were JCPyV IgG negative suggesting that JCPyV <b>viruria</b> resulted from the donor graft in most cases. No acute graft dysfunction was associated with JCPyV <b>viruria.</b> No positive SV 40 staining was detected in protocol biopsies, and nospecific histopathology was associated with high-level viruria; JCPyV nephropathy was not found. No differences were seen in histopathology or graft function at 3 years in patients with high-level <b>viruria</b> compared to non-JCPyV viruric patients transplanted during the same time period, and outcome was similar in patients with presumably primary and reactivated JCPyV. The mean estimated GFR at last follow-up was 44 ml/min (range 12 - 60 ml/min). One graft with high-level <b>viruria</b> was lost 9 years posttransplant due to recurrent IgA nephropathy Conclusions: High-level JCPyV <b>viruria</b> seems to be associated with primary JCPyV infection reflecting the average seroprevalence of 60 %, but is not stringently associated with inferior graft function or survival, or histopathological changes. c 2016 Elsevier B.

40|$|Two polyomaviruses, BK virus (BKV) and JC virus (JCV), are {{ubiquitous}} {{in the human}} population, generally infecting children asymptomatically and then persisting in renal tissue. It is generally thought that reactivation leads to productive infection for both viruses, with progeny shed in the urine. Several {{studies have shown that}} the rate of JC <b>viruria</b> increases with the age of the host, but a systematic approach to examine the shedding of BKV has not been developed. To elucidate the relationship between BK <b>viruria</b> and host age, we obtained urine from donors (healthy volunteers or nonimmunocompromised patients) who were divided into nine age groups, each containing 50 members. A high-sensitivity PCR was used to detect BKV and JCV DNA from urinary samples, and the specificity of amplification was confirmed by sequencing or restriction analysis of the amplified fragments. The rate of BK <b>viruria</b> was relatively low in subjects aged < 30 years but gradually increased with age in subjects aged ≥ 30 years.

40|$|Polyoma BK virus (BKV) is {{frequently}} {{identified in the}} urine of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) patients with hemorrhagic cystitis (HC). However, <b>viruria</b> is common even in asymptomatic patients, making a direct causative role of BKV difficult to establish. This study prospectively quantified BK <b>viruria</b> and viremia in 50 BMT patients to define the quantitative relationship of BKV reactivation with HC. Adenovirus (ADV) was similarly quantified as a control. More than 800 patient samples were quantified for BKV VP 1 gene with a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Twenty patients (40 %) developed HC, 6 with gross hematuria (HC grade 2 or higher) and 14 with microscopic hematuria (HC grade 1). When compared with asymptomatic patients, patients with HC had significantly higher peak BK <b>viruria</b> (6 × 1012 versus 5. 7 × 107 genome copies/d, P <. 001) and larger total amounts of BKV excreted during BMT (4. 9 × 1013 versus 7. 7 × 108 genome copies, P <. 001). There was no detectable increase in BK viremia. Binary logistic regression analysis showed that BK <b>viruria</b> was the only risk factor, with HC not related to age, conditioning regimen, type of BMT, and graft-versus-host disease. Furthermore, the levels of ADV <b>viruria</b> in patients with or without HC were similar and comparable with those of BK <b>viruria</b> in patients without HC, suggesting that the significant increase in BK <b>viruria</b> in HC patients was not due to background viral reactivation or damage to the urothelium.

40|$|BK and JC polyomaviruses can reactivate after transplantation, causing renal {{dysfunction}} and graft loss. The {{incidence of}} JC reactivation after renal transplant {{is not well}} understood. Here, we characterized JC reactivation using samples collected {{during the first year}} after transplantation from 200 kidney recipients. We detected BK and JC viruses in the urine of 35 and 16 % of transplant recipients, respectively. The median viral load in the urine was 400 times higher for BK virus than JC virus. The presence of BK <b>viruria</b> made concurrent JC <b>viruria</b> less likely: JC <b>viruria</b> was detected in 22 % of non-BK viruric recipients compared with 4 % of BK viruric recipients (P = 0. 001).

We did not observe JC viremia, JC nephropathy, or progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. The onset of JC <b>viruria</b> was associated with donor, but not recipient, JC-specific antibody in a titer-dependent fashion and inversely associated with donor and recipient BK-specific antibody.

40|$|International audiencePolyomavirus BK (BKV) is {{a common}} human polyomavirus that rarely causes {{clinical}} symptoms in immunocompetent individuals. However, BK virus reactivation occurs in 20 - 40 % of kidney transplant patients and 1 - 10 % of cases present with BK virus-associated nephropathy (BKVN) and reduced kidney allograft survival. In this study, 120 consecutive renal allograft recipients were monitored for BK virus replication by real -time PCR (qPCR) in the blood and urine {{during the first year}} post-transplantation and risk factors for BK viremia, <b>viruria</b> and polyoma BKV-associated nephropathy were evaluated. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to determine the cutoff points for assessing the risk of developing BKVN. In total, 1, 243 samples were tested. BK-DNAuria > 107 copies/ml and BK-DNAemia > 104 copies/ml were found in 25. 8 % and 5 % of the samples screened, respectively, during the 12 month follow-up period. BKVN was confirmed histologically in 3 / 120 patients and viremic patients were treated with dialysis for longer time periods and had higher levels anti-BKV-reactive antibodies. Patients with <b>viruria</b> were also treated longer with dialysis and had impaired graft function 12 months post-transplantation. Patients with sustained <b>viruria</b> exhibited more acute rejection episodes than patients with transient <b>viruria.</b> Using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the cutoff point for viremia and <b>viruria</b> was redefined to 103 copies/ml serum for BK viremia and a cutoff point of 6. 7 x 107 copies/ml in urine.

40|$|BK virus-allograft {{nephropathy}} (BKVAN) is {{an increasingly}} recognized complication after kidney transplantation. Quantitative tests have been advocated to monitor patients, but data demonstrating their efficacy are relatively limited. We developed a real-time PCR assay to quantitate BK virus loads {{in the setting}} of renal transplantation, and we correlated the BK virus load with clinical course and with the presence of BK virus in renal biopsy specimens. BK virus loads were measured in urine, plasma, and kidney biopsy samples in three clinical settings: (i) patients with asymptomatic BK <b>viruria,</b> (ii) patients with active BKVAN, and (iii) patients with resolved BKVAN. Active BKVAN was associated with BK viremia greater than 5 × 103 copies/ml and with BK <b>viruria</b> greater than 107 copies/ml in all cases. Resolution of nephropathy led to resolution of viremia, decreased <b>viruria</b> levels, and disappearance of viral inclusions, but low-level viral DNA persisted in biopsy specimens even for patients whose <b>viruria</b> was cleared. All but one patient in the resolved BKVAN group carried a urinary viral load below 107 copies/ml. Viral loads in patients with asymptomatic <b>viruria</b> were generally lower but in some cases overlapped with levels more typical of BKVAN. One patient with asymptomatic <b>viruria</b> and with a viral load overlapping values seen in BKVAN had developed nephropathy by the time of follow-up.

We prospectively monitored pediatric renal transplant recipients {{for the presence of}} BK and JC polyomavirus in urine and blood using a quantitative PCR assay to evaluate the prevalence and clinical relevance of polyomavirus infection in the pediatric renal transplant population. Of 46 pediatric renal recipients who were evaluated, nine (20 %) demonstrated isolated BKV <b>viruria,</b> while five (11 %) had concomitant BKV viremia and <b>viruria.</b> JCV <b>viruria</b> was found in eight (17 %) patients. BKV viremia was associated with a significantly higher urinary BKV viral load: median urinary viral load 1. 9 x 10 (9) copies/mL (range 6. 7 x 10 (2) - 1. 8 x 10 (11)) for the group with concomitant viremia and <b>viruria</b> vs. 1. 8 x 10 (3) copies/mL (range 2. 5 x 10 (2) - 4. 5 x 10 (6)) for the group with isolated <b>viruria</b> (p < 0. 0001). In children that were followed prospectively since their transplantation, the BKV urinary viral load increased markedly before viremia became detectable a few weeks later. None of the patients with JCV <b>viruria</b> or isolated BKV <b>viruria</b> had renal dysfunction. Among the five patients with BKV in both urine and blood, two developed biopsy-proven BKV nephropathy associated with deterioration of the renal function. Management of the BKV nephropathy consisted of reduction of immunosuppression alone or in combination with antiviral treatment with cidofovir. This study shows that polyomavirus {{infection and}} related interstitial nephritis is a relevant clinical issue in the pediatric renal transplant population. Monitoring the polyomaviral load in the urine and the blood of the patients using a quantitative PCR technique is a useful tool in the diagnosis and subsequent management of this infection.

The rt-QPCR assay {{was found to be}} highly sensitive and specific, with a wide dynamic range (2. 4 to 11 log 10 copies/ml) and very good precision (coefficient of variation, ∼ 5. 9 %). There was {{a significant difference in the}} prevalences of <b>viruria</b> and viremia between the BKVAN (100 % and 100 %) and SV (23 % and 3. 9 %) groups (P < 0. 001). No <b>viruria</b> or viremia was detected in LD or in NT-CKD patients. The median (range) peak levels of BK virus <b>viruria</b> and viremia, in log 10 copies/ml, were 10. 26 (9. 04 to 10. 83) and 4. 83 (3. 65 to 5. 86) for the BKVAN group versus 0 (0 to 10. 83) and 0 (0 to 5. 65) for the SV group, respectively (P < 0. 001).

Urine and plasma samples from 44 renal allograft recipients with stable graft function were collected during outpatient follow-up and the genome copies of BKV were determined by Q-PCR. All patients showed quantifiable viremia and two groups of patients were identified: one group of patients (n= 35) showed low viral load (median: 270 /ml, range: 108 - 1000 /ml) and the other group (n= 9) with high viral load (median: 5 × 104 /ml, range: 2 × 104 - 6 × 104 /ml).

Altogether 433 patients were examined in a cross-sectional manner and 233 of these patients were selected for a prospective, longitudinal study. In this study, an average of 7 measurements per patient were recorded during the first year of post-transplantation. Results: A total of 7 % and 19 % patients were positive for BKV in serum and urine, respectively. Sustained BK <b>viruria</b> showed sensitivity of 100 % and specificity of 94 % for BK viremia, and was associated with significantly higher level of BK load than the patients with transient <b>viruria</b> (p < 0. 01). Interestingly, BK viremia was preceded by BK viruria: the peak of viral load and number of positive patients appeared during the third and fifth posttransplant month for urine and serum, respectively. BKVAN diagnosed in 21. 4 % of patient with persistent BK <b>viruria,</b> appeared 5 and 11 weeks after BKV reactivation in serum and urine respectively was detected. Conclusion: Sustained BK <b>viruria</b> is a reliable marker allowing an early identification of patients at high risk of BKVAN development and therefore assure precocious therapeutic interventions...|$|E
40|$|<b>Viruria</b> {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} in many human and animal viral infections (1, 2). Preliminary studies in mice and rats by Schultz and Neva (3) established that virus passes from blood to urine within 30 minutes after intravenous injection un-der the conditions of their experiments. This viru-ria {{was referred to as}} "immediate <b>viruria</b> " and was considered to be distinct from the <b>viruria</b> that occurs during acute infections. In the present study, dogs were used in experiments that were technically too difficult to be carried out in smaller laboratory animals. Renal physiological and viro-logical techniques were combined to study the mechanisms of virus clearance from the blood by the kidney and to establish the locus in the neph-ron where virus gains entry into the urine. Previ-ous studies of a similar nature include those of Keller and Zatzman (4), who injected Bacillus megatheriumi phage and studied its renal excretion and distribution in the liver and spleen of dogs. Petrov (5) used injection of bacteriophage of Escherichia coli in dogs to establish clearance val-ues for these virus particles. Although Schultz and Neva (3) were unable to determine the renal contribution to <b>viruria</b> in rats, they observed that the rat bladder is permeable to small numbers of virus particles.

40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of {{lymphocytic choriomeningitis}} virus infection in fetal, newborn, and young adult hamsters was studied. Infected newborn hamsters initially developed a persistent viremia and <b>viruria</b> with titers often in excess of 10 (4. 0) mean infectious doses/ 0. 03 ml of blood or urine. After week 12 two different patterns of infection became evident. Approximately one-half of the hamsters eventually cleared the infection, whereas the others developed a chronic progressive and ultimalely fatal disease characterized by continuous high-titered viremia and <b>viruria</b> and high titers of virus in their tissues. Complement-fixing antibody and, to a lesser degree, virus-neutralizing antibody coexisted with the viremia. Hamsters with persistently high levels of viremia and <b>viruria</b> developed chronic glomerulonephritis and widespread vasculitis, whereas hamsters that cleared their infections did not develop these lesions. Litters of hamsters born to viremic mothers were invariably infected. Litter sizes were small and breeding effectiveness was reduce; however, vertical, congenital infection was successfully passed through three generations. The course of infection in the congenitally infected hamsters {{was similar to that}} in newborn infected hamsters, with all animals producing complement-fixing antibody, some animals being capable of clearing the viremia and remaining healthy, and other animals having persistent viremia and fatal disease. Inoculated young adult hamsters did not become diseased, developed viremia and <b>viruria</b> which persisted up to 3 and 6 months, respectively, and developed complement-fixing antibody by 10 days after infection. The prolonged urinary excretion of large amounts of {{lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus}} by asymptomatic, chronically infected hamsters is an important public health consideration when dealing with potential human infection...|$|E

40|$|Patients with {{inflammatory}} bowel disease (IBD) have an immune-deficient baseline status further modulated by {{immunosuppressive therapy}} that may promote the reactivation of latent viruses such as BK virus (BKV). The aim of this prospective {{study was to determine}} the prevalence of BKV infection in IBD patients and its potential relationship with the immunosuppressive treatment. Paired urine and plasma samples from 53 consecutive patients with IBD and 53 controls were analyzed. BKV detection was performed by conventional PCR and positive samples were further quantified by real-time PCR. No viremia was detected. BKV <b>viruria</b> was significantly more common in IBD patients than among the controls (54. 7 % versus 11. 3 %; P< 0. 0001). The only risk factor for BKV <b>viruria</b> in IBD was age (47. 2 ± 16. 3 versus 37. 8 ± 15. 2; P= 0. 036), and there was a trend towards higher rate of <b>viruria</b> in outpatients (61. 5 % versus 38. 5 %; P= 0. 096) and in those not receiving ciprofloxacin (59. 5 % versus 40. 5 %; P= 0. 17).

40|$|AbstractObjectivesRenal {{transplant}} patients receive calcineurin inhibitors {{to suppress}} the calcineurin-nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) pathway. The DNA binding activity of NFAT {{and its relationship to}} the reactivation of BK virus (BKV) has not been evaluated in renal transplant patients. Patients and MethodsThe DNA binding activity of NFAT cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc 1) was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 26 renal transplant patients and 26 healthy controls. At the same time, their urinary BKV viral load was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. ResultsThe activity of NFATc 1 was lower in renal transplant patients without BKV <b>viruria</b> [BKV (−) ] than in healthy controls, while it trended to be higher in renal transplant patients with BKV <b>viruria</b> [BKV (+) ] than in BKV (−) patients. The tacrolimus blood levels did not differ between BKV (+) and BKV (−) renal transplant patients or correlate with NFATc 1 activity. ConclusionNFATc 1 DNA binding activity was lower in renal transplant patients without BKV <b>viruria</b> than in those who were BKV (+). However, there was no relationship between tacrolimus blood levels and NFATc 1 activity in renal transplant patients...|$|E
40|$|There are no accurate, noninvasive {{tests to}} {{diagnose}} BK polyomavirus nephropathy, a common infectious complication after renal transplantation. This study evaluated whether the qualitative detection of cast-like, three-dimensional polyomavirus aggregates (“Haufen”) {{in the urine}} accurately predicts BK polyomavirus nephropathy. Using negative-staining electron microscopy, we sought Haufen in 194 urine samples from 139 control patients and in 143 samples from 21 patients with BK polyomavirus nephropathy. Haufen detection was correlated with pathology in concomitant renal biopsies and BK <b>viruria</b> (decoy cell shedding and viral load assessments by PCR) and BK viremia (viral load assessments by PCR). Haufen originated from renal tubules containing virally lysed cells, and the detection of Haufen in the urine correlated tightly with biopsy confirmed BK polyomavirus nephropathy (concordance rate 99 %). A total of 77 of 143 urine samples from 21 of 21 patients with BK polyomavirus nephropathy (disease stages A–C) contained Haufen, and during follow-up (3 to 120 wk), their presence or absence closely mirrored the course of renal disease. All controls were Haufen-negative, however, high viremia or <b>viruria</b> were detected in 8 % and 41 % of control samples, respectively. κ statistics showed fair to good agreement of <b>viruria</b> and viremia with BK polyomavirus nephropathy or with Haufen shedding and demonstrated an excellent agreement between Haufen and polyomavirus nephropathy (κ 0. 98). Positive and negative predictive values of Haufen for BK polyomavirus nephropathy were 97 % and 100 %, respectively. This study shows that shedding of urinary Haufen and not BK viremia and <b>viruria</b> accurately mark BK polyomavirus nephropathy. It suggests that the detection of Haufen {{may serve as a}} noninvasive means to diagnose BK polyomavirus nephropathy in the urine...|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} whether polyomaviruses contribute to interstitial cystitis pathogenesis. A prospective study was performed with 50 interstitial cystitis cases compared with 50 age-matched, disease-free controls for {{the frequency of}} polyomaviruria. Associations between polyomaviruria and disease characteristics were analysed in cases. Polyomavirus in urine and bladder tissue was detected with species (JC virus vs. BK virus) specific, real-time PCR. Case patients were reflective of interstitial cystitis epidemiology with age range from 26 - 88 years (median 58) and female predominance (41 / 50 F). There was {{a significant increase in}} the frequency of polyomavirus shedding between cases and controls (p< 0. 02). Polyomavirus shedding, in particular BK <b>viruria,</b> was associated with vesical ulceration, a marker of disease severity, among interstitial cystitis cases after adjustment for age and sex (OR 6. 8, 95 % CI 1. 89 - 24. 4). There was a significant association among cases between the presence of BK <b>viruria</b> and response to intravesical Clorpactin therapy (OR 4. 50, 95 % CI 1. 17 - 17. 4). The presence of polyomaviruria was found to be associated with the ulcerative form of interstitial cystitis. Clorpactin, which has anti-DNA virus activity, was more likely to improve symptoms in the presence of BK <b>viruria.</b> These data from this pilot study suggest associations between polyomaviruria and interstitial cystitis warranting further investigation...|$|E

40|$|Objective　To {{investigate}} the epidemiological characteristics of BK virus (BKV) infection in living renal transplantation patients, {{and analyze the}} risk factors of BKV infection and BKV nephropathy (BKVN). Methods　The BKV DNA load in urine and blood samples of 43 renal transplant recipients, who had received renal transplantation in 309 Hospital from Feb. 2012 to Feb. 2013, was determined at preoperative period and 0. 5, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 months after transplantation. Meanwhile, the biopsy of grafted kidney was performed in those patients with continuously elevated serum creatinine and those with higher BKV DNA load. Patients were divided into 3 groups as follows according to the test results: BK <b>viruria</b> group, BK viremia group and pathologically diagnosed BKVN group. Data of each group were then recorded, including gender, age, postoperative diabetes (PTDM), acute rejection (AR), delayed recovery of graft function (DGF), postoperative pulmonary infection, preoperative immune induction therapy, postoperative immunosuppressive regimen, and other information. The risk factors for postoperative BKV infection and BKVN were analyzed. Results　After an average of 15 -month follow-up, {{it was found that}} the incidence of BKV <b>viruria</b> was 46. 5 %, that of BKV viremia was 14. 0 %, and that of BKVN was 2. 3 %. Sixth month after transplantation was found to be the peak time of <b>viruria</b> and viremia. FK 506 was significantly associated with viremia in living donor renal transplantation. The immunosuppressive regimen was the immune related independent risk factor for BK viremia developing BKVN after living renal transplantation. Conclusion　The incidence of BK viremia and BKVN is lower in living donor renal transplantation than in cadaver renal transplantation, but that of <b>viruria</b> is similar in both groups. Immunosuppressive scheme based on FK 506 is an immune related independent risk factor leading to BK viremia proceeding to BKVN in living donor kidney transplantation.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about late-onset hemorrhagic {{cystitis}} (HC) in children, its relationship to BK virus, and treatment with cidofovir (CDV) following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We prospectively investigated BK virus reactivation in children who underwent HSCT from a matched related donor for thalassemia or sickle cell anemia following busulfan-cyclophosphamide-based conditioning regimens and analyzed risk factors for development of HC and its treatment with CDV. Grade 2 - 4 HC occurred in 30 patients with a cumulative incidence of 26 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] = 18 %- 34 %). The cumulative incidences of BK <b>viruria</b> and viremia were 81 % (95 % CI = 69 %- 89 %) and 28 % (95 % CI = 18 %- 40 %), respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that use of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) (hazard ratio [HR] = 10. 5; P =. 001), peak BK <b>viruria</b> > 100, 000 copies/mL (HR = 6. 2; P =. 004), and grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (HR = 5. 3; P =. 007) were predictive factors for HC. Nineteen patients with HC were given CDV at 1. 5 mg/kg/day 3 times a week, or 5 mg/kg/week. The median duration of therapy was 27 days (range, 21 - 180 days), and a median of 9 doses were given (range, 6 - 22). All patients had a complete clinical response (CCR), and 69 % had a microbiological response at 4 weeks. Eleven patients with BK virus-related HC receiving supportive care also had CCR. The median duration of HC in these patients {{was similar to that}} in patients treated with CDV. None of the patients with HC cleared BK <b>viruria</b> when CCR was achieved. We conclude that late-onset HC is more prevalent in children with sustained high BK <b>viruria</b> who are treated with ATG or who develop graft-versus-host disease. Randomized clinical trials are urgently needed to better define the role of CDV in treating BK virus-related HC...|$|E
