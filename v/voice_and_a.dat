Turunen uses both her classical singing <b>voice</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> rock-sounding voice.

5|$|Development of Revelation lasted {{more than}} three years; Ubisoft had as many as eighty {{employees}} working on the game. Musician Peter Gabriel lent his <b>voice</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> song to the game's audio; the original score was written by Exiles composer Jack Wall. Overall, reception to the game was positive; reviewers lauded the impressive visuals, sound, and puzzles. Publications such as Computer Gaming World took issue with the control scheme of the game. Revelation is the last game in the Myst series to use both prerendered backgrounds and full-motion video; the final game in the series, , is rendered in real-time throughout.|$|E
5|$|Wooden carvings in {{the shape}} of hawks, ancient gods, serpents and turtles are also popular. The Grand Huts, also known as grande case (chef's hut), are {{decorated}} with the filial of fleche faitiere representing the ancestral spirits, symbolic of transition between the world of the dead and the world of the living. The wood carving is shaped like the spear-like carving that adorns the top of the grande case. It comprises three parts; the flat crowned face representing the ancestor with a long, the rounded pole run through by conch shells mounted on it that represents the ancestor’s <b>voice,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> base with the pole fixed to it to symbolise the link between the clan and the chief. The central piece is also flanked by wooden pieces with sharp points (facing downwards) that are intended to prevent bad spirits enveloping the ancestor in the central part. As it represented the power of the chiefs over their subjects, it was adopted as flag of the Kanaks by the organization leading the independent movement in New Caledonia. The arrow or the spear normally has a needle at the end to insert threaded shells from bottom to top. After the death of a Kanak chief, the fleche faitière is removed and his family takes it to their home. Though it was allowed to be used again as a sign of respect it is normally kept at burial grounds of noted citizens or at the mounds of abandoned grand houses.|$|E

25|$|Nonetheless, the limpid {{purity of}} her tone and the {{smoothness}} of her legato line remained uniquely impressive, compensating {{to some extent}} for the weakening of her breath control. The records also display a lively singing personality {{as well as a}} surprisingly strong chest <b>voice</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> mellow timbre. Her trill remains wonderfully fluent and accurate and her diction is excellent. Overall her discs have a charm and musicality that give us a hint of why, at her peak, she commanded $5,000 a night.|$|E

25|$|The next Phillip St revue was Around the Loop, {{which again}} teamed Oldaker, Gordon Chater, Blacklock and Humphries, plus {{newcomer}} June Salter. Humphries revived the Edna character (for {{what he said}} {{would be the last}} time) and the revue proved to be a major hit, playing eight shows a week for 14 months. During this period Humphries was living near Bondi and while out walking one day he had a chance meeting with an elderly man who had a high, scratchy <b>voice</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> pedantic manner of speech; this encounter inspired the creation of another of Humphries' most enduring characters, Sandy Stone.|$|E

25|$|Ocean Township {{operates}} {{within the}} Faulkner Act (formally {{known as the}} Optional Municipal Charter Law) under the Council-Manager form of government (Plan A), implemented based on the recommendations of a Charter Study Commission as of July 1, 1963.

25|$|The 1913 Armory Show in New York City, an {{exhibition}} which brought European modernist artists' {{work to the}} U.S., both shocked the public and influenced art making in the United States {{for the remainder of}} the twentieth century. The exhibition had a twofold effect of communicating to American artists that artmaking was about expression, not only aesthetics or realism, and at the same time showing that Europe had abandoned its conservative model of ranking artists according to a strict academic hierarchy. This encouraged American artists to find a personal <b>voice,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> modernist movement, responding to American civilization, emerged in New York. Alfred Stieglitz (1864–1946), photographer, Charles Demuth (1883–1935) and Marsden Hartley (1877–1943), both painters, helped establish an American viewpoint in the fine arts. Stieglitz promoted cubists and abstract painters at his 291 Gallery on 5th Avenue. The Museum of Modern Art, founded in 1929, became a showcase for American and international contemporary art. By the end of World War II, Paris had declined as the world's art center while New York emerged as the center of contemporary fine art in both the United States and the world.|$|E
