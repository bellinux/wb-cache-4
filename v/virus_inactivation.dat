25|$|The {{degree of}} {{inactivation}} by ultraviolet radiation {{is directly related}} to the UV dose applied to the water. The dosage, a product of UV light intensity and exposure time, is usually measured in microjoules per square centimeter, or equivalently as microwatt seconds per square centimeter (µW·s/cm2). Dosages for a 90% kill of most bacteria and viruses range from 2,000 to 8,000µW·s/cm2. Larger parasites such as cryptosporidium require a lower dose for inactivation. As a result, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has accepted UV disinfection as a method for drinking water plants to obtain cryptosporidium, giardia or <b>virus</b> <b>inactivation</b> credits.

The BioProcess Systems Alliance (BPSA) is the single use association advocating broader application of single-use to include cGMP Good manufacturing practice use which will require FDA support. The agency has stated in public forums it is a major backer of single use technology in general, as the technology provides significant benefits and value, including mitigation of cross contamination and reduced industry costs. The FDA has stated it will not issue guidance to the industry on single use but may issue Q and As on its web site. When an FDA approved single use production site is approved, the gates will open for broader and faster single use adoption worldwide. Already single use has shown itself to be a huge cost saver and to increase process flexibility and operational efficiency for biosimilar applications and for biotech startups and CROs. Emerging markets are expected to embrace single use vs stainless given their lack of legacy infrastructure and desire to drive capex and opex costs out of the biotech operation.

40|$|Temperature is {{considered}} {{as the major}} factor determining <b>virus</b> <b>inactivation</b> in the environment. Food industries, therefore, widely apply temperature as virus inactivating parameter. This review encompasses an overview of viral inactivation and virus genome degradation data from published literature {{as well as a}} statistical analysis and the development of empirical formulae to predict <b>virus</b> <b>inactivation.</b> A total of 658 data (time to obtain a first log(10) reduction) were collected from 76 published studies with 563 data on virus infectivity and 95 data on genome degradation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Solvent/detergent (S/D) {{treatment}} is an established <b>virus</b> <b>inactivation</b> technology {{that has been}} applied {{in the manufacture of}} medicinal products derived from human plasma for more than 20 years. Data on the inactivation of enveloped viruses by S/D treatment collected from seven Plasma Protein Therapeutics Association member companies demonstrate the robustness, reliability, and efficacy of this <b>virus</b> <b>inactivation</b> method. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The results from 308 studies reflecting production conditions as well as technical variables significantly beyond the product release specification were evaluated for <b>virus</b> <b>inactivation,</b> comprising different combinations of solvent and detergent (tri(n-butyl) phosphate [TNBP]/Tween 80, TNBP/Triton X- 100, TNBP/Na-cholate) and different products (Factor [F] VIII, F IX, and intravenous and intramuscular immunoglobulins). RESULTS: Neither product class, process temperature, protein concentration, nor pH value has a significant impact on <b>virus</b> <b>inactivation.</b> A variable that did appear to be critical was the concentration of solvent and detergent. CONCLUSION: The data presented here demonstrate the robustness of <b>virus</b> <b>inactivation</b> by S/D treatment for a broad spectrum of enveloped test viruses and process variables. Our data substantiate the fact that no transmission of viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, or of other enveloped viruses was reported for licensed plasma derivatives since the introduction of S/D treatment...|$|E

40|$|Development of {{effective}} and environmentally friendly disinfectants, or virucidal agents, should help {{prevent the spread}} of infectious diseases through human contact with contaminated surfaces. These agents may also be used, if non-toxic to cells and tissues, as chemotherapeutic agents against infectious diseases. We have shown that arginine has a synergistic effect with a variety of virucidal conditions, namely acidic pH and high temperature, on <b>virus</b> <b>inactivation.</b> All of these treatments are effective, however, at the expense of toxicity. The ability of arginine to lower the effective threshold of these parameters may reduce the occurrence of potential toxic side effects. While it is clear that arginine can be safely used, the mechanism of its <b>virus</b> <b>inactivation</b> has not yet been elucidated. Here we examine the damages that viruses suffer from various physical and chemical stresses and their relations to <b>virus</b> <b>inactivation</b> and aggregation.

40|$|The {{persistence}} of poliovirus type 1 (PO 1) in mixed septic tank effluent and swine manure slurry was determined, and the antiviral effects of several bacterial cultures isolated from swine manure slurry were demonstrated. In two field experiments, PO 1 was consistently inactivated more {{rapidly in the}} mixed waste than in the control Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS). D values (time [in days] for a 90 % reduction of virus titer) were 18. 7 and 29. 9 for the mixed waste and 56. 5 and 51. 8 for the D-PBS control, respectively. The <b>virus</b> <b>inactivation</b> in the mixed waste was temperature dependent. A comparison of PO 1 inactivation in raw mixed waste, autoclaved mixed waste, and bacterium-free filtrate of raw mixed waste at the same pH and temperatures provided an initial demonstration that the <b>virus</b> <b>inactivation</b> in the mixed waste is related, at least in part, to microbial activity. At 25 degrees C, the D value was 6. 8 for the mixed waste, 11. 2 for the autoclaved mixed waste, and 10. 5 for the bacterium-free filtrate of raw mixed waste. At 37 degrees C, D values were 1. 3, 3. 9, and 3. 1 for these three suspending media, respectively. Three bacterial isolates which had shown antiviral effects in a screening test each caused <b>virus</b> <b>inactivation</b> in autoclaved mixed waste, in which the effect of other microorganisms was excluded.

Further analysis revealed that adenovirus infection leads to biphasic type I IFN induction at 12 to 24 h and 48 to 60 h postinfection. The later induction coincided with VA expression and was reduced by <b>virus</b> UV <b>inactivation</b> or RIG-I silencing.

Infectious EBOV titers were determined in SDS-treated plasma and whole blood from EBOV-infected nonhuman primates (NHPs). Infectious titers of EBOV or herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) in detergents-treated cell culture medium containing various serum concentrations were determined. Laboratory test results were not affected by 0. 1 % detergent treatment of blood samples, in contrast with 1 % SDS treatment.

Experiments with cell culture medium showed that <b>virus</b> <b>inactivation</b> by detergents is annulled at physiological serum concentrations.
