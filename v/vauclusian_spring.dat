5|$|The cave {{was formed}} under phreatic {{conditions}} i.e. below the local water table, but lowering base levels {{to which the}} subterranean drainage was flowing resulted in some passages being abandoned by the river, and {{there is evidence of}} a number of abandoned resurgences. In particular, the passages in the 20th chamber are interpreted as a former <b>Vauclusian</b> <b>spring,</b> the waters of which once surfaced in the Ebbor Gorge. It is uncertain whether that was the original rising or whether it formed when the main rising at Wookey was blocked.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Vauclusian</b> <b>spring</b> is {{a spring}} that {{originates}} from a shaft or a cave system, {{with the water}} surging upwards under relatively high pressure. It is named after the Fontaine de Vaucluse in southern France.|$|E

5000|$|The area {{is popular}} for tourism and summer homes, {{and the city}} is known as having the richest {{cultural}} heritage in Ardèche: there are many dolmens in the Bois du Laoul forest and a sculpture of Mithra near the <b>Vauclusian</b> <b>springs</b> of the Tourne. Several former noble or grand-bourgeois 18th century places are regularly used for local and visitors during summer season. A mediaeval fort with embellishments dating from the 15th and 17th century, the entire construction a classified historical monument, the Bishops' palace of Bourg-Saint-Andéol with inside the museum René Margotton, front of Rhône, {{is one of the}} largest and most complex in the Vivarais region.|$|R
40|$|Arranged by {{geologist}} Dr. Temucin Aygen, the International Conference of Speleology and Karstology at Istanbul, {{with the}} participation of about twenty foreign scholars, opened first at Beyazit de Stamboul University. For three days papers and discussions enlivened the sessions, broken by tours around the Bosporus. During the following two weeks {{the members of the}} Conference took a field trip across Anatolia, through Ankara, Konya, Mersin, Antalya, Burdur, Izmir, Bursa, and Istanbul. They thus had the opportunity to investigate the principal karstic phenomena of Turkey - the Konya obrouks, travertines of’ Yerkòpru and Antalya, caves of the Mersin region, <b>vauclusian</b> <b>springs</b> of Irviz and Manavgat, and so forth. The interest of these occurrences of Anatolian karst is unquestionable - in addition to the scientific problems they pose, they represent a great economic value either as tourist centres or as producers of electric energy and sources of water for irrigation...|$|R
40|$|Mountainous {{areas are}} often covered by little evolved soils from which {{deposited}} radionuclides can potentially leak into the vadose zone. In the Swiss Jura mountains, we observed unusual isotopic ratios of nuclear weapon test (NWTs) fallout with an apparent loss of NWTs plutonium relative to ¹³⁷Cs of Chernobyl origin in thinner soils. Here, we studied the karstic watershed of a <b>vauclusian</b> <b>spring</b> {{to determine the}} residence times of plutonium, ²⁴¹Am, and ⁹⁰Sr deposited by global fallout and their respective mobility in carbonaceous soils. The results show that ⁹⁰Sr is washed most efficiently from the watershed with a residence time of several hundred years. The estimated plutonium residence time is more than 10 times higher (in the range of 5000 - 10, 000 years), and the ²⁴¹Am residence time is double that of plutonium. The spring water ²⁴¹Am/²³⁹+²⁴⁰Pu isotopic ratio is lower (0. 12 - 0. 28) than found in watershed soils (0. 382 ± 0. 077). Similar differences are found in aquatic mosses (²⁴¹Am/²³⁹+²⁴⁰Pu isotopic ratio 0. 05 - 0. 12), which are permanently submerged in spring waters. In contrast to plutonium, ⁹⁰Sr is leached from these mosses with 0. 5 M HCl, demonstrating that strontium is probably associated with calcium carbonate precipitations on the mosses. The higher plutonium to americium isotopic ratio found in the samples of spring water and mosses at the outlet of the karst shows that plutonium mobility is enhanced...|$|E
