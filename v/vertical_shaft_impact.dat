40|$|Understanding {{the effect}} of {{particle}} shape on dry rheology {{is considered to be}} an important aspect in order to replace natural sand used in concrete with man-made manufactured sand. There is a significant difference in particle shape and surface texture between crushed rock material (aggregates) and natural sand. The crushed aggregates are normally less rounded and have less equally shaped dimensions compared to natural sand. Thus, the flow ability of the concrete will be different. The main difference is explained by a difference in the wet rheology of the cement paste which in turn is affected by the smallest particles in the size range from microns to a few millimetres. In previous research, it has been demonstrated how different crushing techniques affects the shape of the produced particles. In many cases it is believed that <b>Vertical</b> <b>Shaft</b> <b>Impact</b> (VSI) -technology is the way forward to replace natural sand.

This paper experimentally investigates the smoke back-layering flow length of longitudinal ventilated tunnel fires with a <b>vertical</b> <b>shaft</b> in the upstream (0. 5 - 4. 0 m from the fire source) using a 1 / 10 reduced-scale subway tunnel model.

40|$|The {{aggregate}} {{industry in}} Sweden is investigating methods {{to improve the}} quality of manufactured sand (aggregate smaller than 2 mm produced by crushing rock) for concrete production. A common way to improve the shape of the particles is to use a <b>vertical</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>impact</b> (VSI) crusher. However, the crushing process creates a large amount of fines (particles smaller than 63 mu m) that are not desirable in concrete mixes. The aggregate industry in Sweden is therefore investigating methods to reduce the amount of fines produced by the manufacturing of sand. One method being investigated is air classification. A centrifugal air classifier used in the aggregate industry was investigated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to improve the understanding of the influence of the geometric design of the classifier on the cut size and the resulting particle size distribution. Simulations were performed with a CFD model using an Euler-Lagrange approach. The simulation results show that the classification results are affected by air flow velocity, particle shape, particle size, the geometry of the air classifier and turbulence in the air flow.

40|$|Issue: Ceramic {{contaminants}} in recycled glass cullet {{can result in}} inclusions in finished glass products. Ceramic inclusions can lead to eventual fracturing or breakage of the glass container, especially if the container is filled with a pressurized liquid like soda or beer. Providing a cullet supply free of ceramic contaminants is generally {{the responsibility of the}} materials recovery facility (MRF). Many MRFs physically remove ceramic contaminants from the cullet, either manually or with automated systems. An alternative to complete ceramic removal is to reduce the entire cullet supply to No. 12 mesh or smaller. Called “fine-sizing”, this size reduction enables most ceramics to melt in the furnace. This Best Practice describes some prevalent technologies for fine-sizing cullet. Best Practice: This best practice considers two approaches to fine-sizing glass cullet: vertical shaft grinding and flexible impact pulverizing. Moisture control is also discussed.

The aggregates output from the Rock <b>Vertical</b> <b>Shaft</b> <b>Impact</b> Crusher (RoR VSI), had been classified to six groups of shapes then divided further into two categories namely the high quality aggregates and the low quality aggregates. The characteristics of the aggregates such as shape, size and color, do play an important roles in the development of high strength concrete. In order to produce high quality aggregates, the system would need to be monitored and maintained continuously by analyzing the past and current data. Presently, there is no database system to store the images for the classified data. The conventional method of the aggregates is done manually which is slow, highly subjective and laborious. Therefore, a local database system is proposed to store information could help to overcome this problem. The images and aggregates ’ recognition and classification data will be kept in order and it will have a simple and easy way of storing and retrieving information. The machine performance can be retrieved for any period of time by calculating the output for high quality aggregates out of total of aggregates produced. The shapes break down for all six recognizable shapes also can be displayed. These could help the engineer to monitor the system on output performance with continuous analysis, with shorter time. Other than that, the strength of the concrete can be determined by counting the number and the percentage of good quality of aggregate being used. Keyword...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{the effect}} of {{particle}} shape on dry rheology {{is considered to be}} an important aspect in order to replace natural sand used in concrete with manufactured sand. Crushed particles from solid rock are normally less rounded and have less equally shaped dimensions compared to natural sand. Thus, the flowability and workability of the concrete will be different. In previous research, it has been demonstrated how different crushing techniques affects the shape of the particles. In many cases it is believed that <b>Vertical</b> <b>Shaft</b> <b>Impact</b> (VSI) technology is a way forward to replace natural sand. To be able to study {{the effect of}} VSI at the smaller fractions (63 - 2000 µm) sufficient measurements methods to determine particle shape are required. Optical tools to analyze the aggregates would make it possible to study a large amount of particles at small fractions. The determination of particle shape of aggregates is challenging since the shape is highly irregular and the size span of particles are very large. This study aim to evaluate one of the available optical tools, the Camsizer, for digital imaging determination of shape and size distribution. The available default shape parameters of the Camsizer are studied to understand the meaning of the parameters and their suitability for determining the quality of manufactured sand. To evaluate the capacity to determine particle shape, tests are made with 35 different materials. The results are compared with the dry rheology measured with the standardized “flow cone” test. Dependence has been previously proven between particle shape and the mass flow rate in the cone. Three different shape parameters, aspect ratio, sphericity and symmetry, are studied with the Camsizer and the results are compared with the mass flow rates in the cone. The results indicate a strong linear relationship between the optical parameters and the flow cone test...|$|E
40|$|Abstract only - The {{existing}} {{construction waste}} recycling technologies and standards have been long applied in construction and demolition (C&D) waste recycling, mainly {{focused on the}} production and use of coarse recycled aggregates. Very few papers and process focus on the production of recycled sand although some previous results show that fine aggregates fraction (below 4. 8 mm) represents around 40 to 60 % (in mass) of the Brazilian waste and it is usually down cycled as road sub-base or disposed in landfills. The quality of the recycled aggregate is strictly related {{to the content of}} porous and low strength phases, as the patches of cement attached to the recycled aggregate. Despite being the crucial factor for aggregate performance, the removal of adhered cement paste is not a simple task. Some technologies have already been described in the literature, even though, to the moment none of these technologies has clearly succeeded in reaching the large market available. This paper presents a summary of the main properties of the sand produced from C&D waste by tertiary crushing at vertical shaft impactor crusher (attrition and abrasion comminution). Additionally mineral processing technologies were applied on the attained product, such as density concentration by shaking table and spirals and magnetic separation at rare earth roll separator. The main properties of recycled sand are discussed and compared to the previous C&D waste, respectively: apparent density, water absorption, chemical composition, porosity, particle shape and cement paste content. The results demonstrated that the comminution by <b>vertical</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>impact</b> crusher allowed producing a VSI-sand with low porosity and water absorption. The concentration by shaking table at narrow sieve fractions led to a product with low porosity and reduced content of cement paste, although products from spiral concentrator for the bulk sample had only the effect of classification instead of concentration. The non-magnetic products presented similar characteristics of the heavy product from the shaking table plus separation of micaceous minerals. The aim of producing sand from construction and demolition waste through mineral processing unit operations changes the recycling approach and contributes for upcycling the recycled sand...|$|E

40|$|Aggregate {{quality is}} of great importance, and in this context it is {{essential}} to understand how various process parameters influence the product quality characteristics. Thus, {{there is a need for}} aggregate producers to improve their process knowledge. Research has led to an improved understanding of how different process parameters affect the outcomes of specific comminution processes. In aggregate production, breakage models are one example of such a research result. These models have been refined over the years. The breakage models that have been presented to date can accurately predict the size distribution of aggregates. On the other hand, they cannot normally predict any other material characteristics such as shape and strength. This thesis outlines the research to date, which has focused on a frequently discussed quality parameter, namely the shape of the product. Knowledge of various methodologies is required to measure this parameter. A novel method for measuring the shape of fine aggregates is presented. The rheology test, the methodology of which was originally based on a New Zealand standard, can be correlated with other data to measure particle shape in accordance with the F-aspect method. The correlation between these methods is very good, and since the rheology test is easy to use, it is suitable for a quarry or a basic test facility. The cone crusher is the most commonly used tertiary stage crusher today. One of its great advantages is that it produces a relatively low amount of fines. However, it only produces acceptable particle shapes for certain fraction sizes. The <b>vertical</b> <b>shaft</b> <b>impact</b> crusher (VSI) creates particles of a very satisfactory shape across all fractions, including fine aggregate, as confirmed by studies using the aforementioned rheology test. This thesis presents two models for predicting shape in crushed aggregate from a cone crusher. The first model is empirical, and my conclusion is that there are four dominating parameters affecting shape: the average feed size, the closed side setting (CSS), throw and eccentric speed. To further investigate how compressive breakage affects particle shape, an inter-particle breakage model is introduced. This model simulates a specific crushing stage inside the crusher. Simulation results show that the outcome from a crushing event can be predicted with good accuracy. A VSI model for describing particle size and shape is presented in this work. It is proposed that the dominating breakage mechanism in a VSI equipped with a rock box is of abrasive character. Abrasive breakage can appropriately shape all particle sizes, assuming the crusher is operated at a proper velocity. The empirical cone crusher model and the VSI models are combined in a mathematical simulation in order to determine how a crushing plant should be operated to maximise both yield and aggregate quality. The results show that there exists a set of rules to determine the crusher and screen settings that will achieve the best performance in terms of product yield and quality requirements...|$|E
