5|$|Lena was {{president}} of the German jury (including Carolin Niemczyk, Alina Süggeler, Tim Bendzko and Florian Silbereisen) and the spokesperson for Germany, revealing the countries <b>voting</b> <b>results</b> at the Eurovision Song Contest 2013 final on 18 May.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of televoting and jury <b>voting</b> <b>results</b> underwent changes that were detailed {{in the official}} rules for the 2013 contest. Each member of a respective nation's jury was required to rank every song, except that of their own country. The <b>voting</b> <b>results</b> from each member of a particular nation's jury were combined to produce an overall ranking from first to last place. Likewise, the televoting results were also interpreted as a full ranking, {{taking into account the}} full televoting result rather than just the top ten. The {{combination of}} the jury's full ranking and the televote's full ranking produced an overall ranking of all competing entries. The song which scored the highest overall rank received 12 points, while the tenth-best ranked song received 1-point. It was announced in the official Media Handbook that an official app would also be available for voters to vote via during the contest.|$|E
5|$|In {{both the}} 2008 and 2006 United States House of Representatives elections, Kilroy was {{involved}} in close elections for Ohio's 15th congressional district. She lost in 2006 after an election that required the counting of absentee ballots and election recounts. However, after the incumbent retired, she won a similarly close election in 2008. In both cases, she was behind after the Election Day vote tabulations, but made up significant ground with belated absentee ballot <b>voting</b> <b>results.</b> The 2010 election race was widely followed in the mainstream press as a race that the Republicans were targeting.|$|E

5|$|In {{protest of}} the decision, {{multiple}} photographs of We Are Our Mountains were displayed during {{the presentation of}} <b>voting</b> <b>results</b> from Armenia; one was displayed on a video screen at Yerevan's Republic Square in the background, and another was displayed {{on the back of}} a clipboard that the presenter Sirusho was reading results from. Despite the controversy, 1,065 Armenians voted for the Azerbaijani entry, enough to give the country a single point. A total of 43 Azerbaijanis voted for the Armenian entry.|$|E
5|$|The <b>voting</b> <b>results</b> for the WWE Championship match {{were then}} revealed, with Shawn Michaels winning. A bonus match was {{made between the}} two losers in the voting, Jeff Hardy and Mr. Kennedy. Hardy gained the {{advantage}} after dropkicking Kennedy off the apron to ringside. Kennedy came back after throwing Hardy out of the ring. Hardy regained control with a top rope Hurricanrana. Kennedy won the match via pinfall after Hardy missed a rope-aided corner dropkick.|$|E
5|$|Using MVP <b>voting</b> <b>results,</b> {{historical}} {{surveys and}} sabermetric analysis, historian Bill Deane projected in 1989 that Pierce {{would have won}} the American League Cy Young Award in 1953 and 1956 {{if it had been}} given at the time; the award was not created until 1956 (when the National League's Don Newcombe won the award by unanimous vote), and awards were not given for both leagues until 1967. In 1988, baseball historian and statistician Bill James chose Pierce as having had the tenth greatest career value among left-handers, ahead of six Hall of Famers.|$|E

The song which scored the highest overall rank received 12 points, while the tenth-best ranked song received 1-point. In the event of a televoting(insufficient amount of votes/technical issues) or jury failure(technical issue/breach of rules), only a jury/televoting was used by each country.|$|E
5|$|On June 14, 2011, Academy {{president}} Tom Sherak {{announced at}} a press conference that, in an attempt to further revitalize interest surrounding the awards, the 2012 ceremony would feature between five and ten Best Picture nominees depending on <b>voting</b> <b>results,</b> as opposed to a set number of nominees. In related events, the Academy held its third annual Governors Awards ceremony at the Grand Ballroom of the Hollywood and Highland Center on November 12, 2011. On February 11, 2012, in a ceremony at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel in Beverly Hills, California, the Academy Awards for Technical Achievement were presented by host Milla Jovovich.|$|E
5|$|The <b>voting</b> <b>results</b> for Triple H's {{opponent}} for the World Heavyweight Championship {{were then}} revealed, with Shawn Michaels winning. The next match was a Fulfill Your Fantasy Battle Royal {{match for the}} WWE Women's Championship between Molly Holly, Stacy Keibler, Victoria, Gail Kim, Jazz, Nidia, and Trish Stratus. The first to be eliminated was Nidia, which was followed with the elimination of Jazz. Kim attempted a hurricanrana on Victoria but Victoria countered the move as she eliminated Kim. Victoria was eliminated afterwards by Stratus and Molly. Stratus and Molly continued working together, as they got the upper hand over Keibler. Molly eliminated Keibler and Stratus eliminated Molly to retain the title.|$|E

5|$|To be {{inducted}} in the National Baseball Hall of Fame, a player must receive at least 75% {{of the vote}} from the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) or the Veterans Committee. Kelly was on the BBWAA ballot seven times, never coming close to being elected, and never garnering more than 1.9% of the vote. By year, <b>voting</b> <b>results</b> for Kelly were: 1947 (one vote, 0.6%), 1948 (two votes, 1.7%), 1949 (one vote, 0.7%), 1956 (two votes, 1.0%), 1958 (two votes, 0.8%), 1960 (five votes, 1.9%), and 1962 (two votes, 0.6%). Despite {{the lack of support}} from the BBWAA, he was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1973 by the Veterans Committee. At the time of Kelly's election, the writers' ballot was voted on by approximately 400 writers, while the Veterans Committee had a membership of twelve former players and executives.|$|E
25|$|The Social Credit {{government}} {{did away with}} the Instant-runoff voting system, {{that had been in}} place in the rural constituencies, and the Single Transferable Vote system in Edmonton and Calgary, both of which had been in place since 1924. The move was made to standardize and simplify <b>voting</b> <b>results</b> across the province. Under single transferable vote and instant-runoff <b>voting,</b> <b>results</b> would take up to five days to count all the possible vote transfers, before anyone was declared elected. This was especially problematic, in Edmonton that elected seven members. As well, the government in 1955 had lost a few members in rural constituencies due to IRV, when they had received the largest portion of the vote in the constituency but were not elected to the seat after re-distribution of the ballots in the second round. The cancellation of IRV system was meant to prevent this in the future.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the seventh}} season, the <b>voting</b> <b>results</b> are {{seemingly}} skewed towards Caucasian contestants, and critics {{believe that it}} was Caucasian female viewers who vote only for Caucasian male contestants. During top 20 week, all four eliminated contestants were non-Caucasian. This season had the fewest non-Caucasian finalists. This led to criticism of bias in favor of Caucasians.|$|E
25|$|The {{computer}} program DialIdol, which allows voters to autodial their votes {{and uses the}} dialing results to make predictions about the eliminations, was in development during season 4. It was finished by Top 6 week and was used to predict the <b>voting</b> <b>results</b> from the Top 6 to Top 2. However, the dialing program was not {{made available to the}} general public until season 5.|$|E
25|$|Deutschland sucht den Superstar Season 4 is {{the fourth}} season of Deutschland sucht den Superstar which aired on RTL network.

25|$|Feeney's 2006 congressional opponent, Clint Curtis, has {{previously}} provided an affidavit alleging that in October 2000, Feeney asked Curtis, then {{a computer programmer}} at Yang Enterprises, to design a computer program to falsify touch-screen <b>voting</b> <b>results</b> in Palm Beach County. Curtis subsequently passed a polygraph test commissioned by a Washington, D.C. private investigator. A Wired News story noted that Curtis had no direct knowledge of the vote counting software having been used in a public election.|$|E
25|$|The <b>voting</b> <b>results</b> {{presented}} at the contest were incorrect as {{a problem with the}} company that processed the votes made an error. Konkurent was shown as the third choice, but after the error was fixed, it was Prima Vista that qualified. When the correct results were presented, Iskra & Misha Iliev with 41.60%, Tereza Kolarova with 22.97% and Prima Vista with 17.14% qualified for the October selection final. The jury's choice was also the winner of the televote, so the first three placings moved on.|$|E
25|$|On the {{day prior}} to the <b>voting</b> <b>results</b> being announced, however, Channel 4 stated that it still {{considered}} the vote {{to be a success}} as they had already received 400,000 votes, making it the most successful of the series. 36p from each call and 26p from each text also went to charity, raising over £250,000 for charity on the vote alone. The money was split among three charities: Shelter, The Teenage Cancer Trust and the winning housemate's chosen charity, which Pete chose as the Tourette's Association.|$|E
