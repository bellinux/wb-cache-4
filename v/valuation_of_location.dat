We questioned a sample of over 1200 people from five EU countries, and used tools from experimental psychology and economics to extract from them the value they attach to their location data. We compare this value across national groups, gender and technical awareness, but also the perceived difference between academic use and commercial exploitation. We provide some analysis of the self-selection bias of such a study, and look further at the <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>location</b> data over time using data from another experiment...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide {{information}} for tourist destinations through an analysis of the valuation of the location and the seasonality implicit in the price of accommodation. The study data are from European municipalities on the Mediterranean coast. Using quantile regression (that is, taking into account that demand valuation can vary along the hotel price distribution), the author finds that the effect of seasonality, although very important, is mainly constant along the price distribution, with the exception of the greater seasonality effect in Argelès-sur-Mer at higher percentiles. With regard to the <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>location,</b> the fact of the hotel or the apartment being in a French location is valued more highly at higher percentiles...|$|E
40|$|The {{exchange}} of private information for services or other benefits is a commonplace practice {{today in the}} advent of mobile technology. In the case of mobile services, the exchanged commodity is increasingly often spatial location of the user. To decide whether this transaction is beneficial, the user needs to evaluate the exchange value of this commodity. To assess the value users give to their location, and to understand its relationship with location sharing, we conducted a study on a mobile crowdsourcing platform (N= 190). We find that users' <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>location</b> privacy {{is dependent on the}} sharing scenario. For instance, when the location is to be shared with an untrusted advertiser, the users require a premium as compensation for their information. Additionally, benefit perception and trust are found to be connected with more frequent location sharing, while perceived risks and privacy concern are associated with sharing one’s location less frequently...|$|E

40|$|<b>Location</b> <b>of</b> product origin is an often-used {{marketing}} device by retailers. This {{approach is}} based on the assumption that <b>location</b> <b>of</b> origin signals something to consumers about the underlying quality (or other attributes) of the product. This can be an effective strategy if the signal matches the consumer valuat ion of the product after consumption. In the same vein, health advertising is used to increase demand for a product that exhibits “healthy ” dietary attributes. While there have been numerous studies examining the potential impacts of these attributes on demand, there have been few rigorous studies that examine the consistency <b>of</b> consumer <b>valuations</b> <b>of</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> origin before and after they have actually consumed the product (or before and after health advertising).

Controlling for firm-specific differences in the <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> potential <b>locations,</b> the results confirm significant effects of tax incentives, market size, and of labor cost on cross-border location decisions. In accordance with Devereux and Griffith (1998) {{we find that the}} marginal tax rate has no predictive power for location decisions whereas effective average and statutory tax rates exert significant effects. In particular, the statutory tax rate has strong predictive power for the likelihood of direct investment holdings at a location. The results indicate that an increase in the statutory tax rate by 10 percentage points reduces the odds of observing some positive direct investment by approximately 20 %. [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Land-market theory {{emphasizes}} travel savings {{as well as}} {{access to}} amenities as the underlying determinants of land prices (e. g., von Thünen 1826 and Alonso 1964). This research investigates a series of hedonic models (which postulate a good's price to be a linear function of its multiple attributes) for implicit estimation of land values, along with explicit estimation of median housing price and monthly contract rent across the San Francisco Bay Area’s census tracts. The benefits and <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>location</b> are assessed by including a variety of travel-based explanatory variables (including average trip characteristics and automobile ownership) as well as measures of local land-use patterns- after controlling {{for a variety of}} the dwelling units ’ structural characteristics. In many of the models, lot size is interacted with location attributes in order to elucidate the direct dependence, if any, of land values on location. The results indicate that changes in accessibility and travel costs affect land and dwelling-unit values in highly statistically and economically significant ways. For example, the coefficient estimates associated with travel-time reductions suggest values of travel-time savings to be roughly five dollars per hour across all adult-traveller trip types (in 1989 $). Furthermore, a high proximity to industrial land uses and very local commercial activity depress land (and dwellin...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the factors that {{influence}} an entrepreneur's decision to stay or move out of a neighbourhood. In general, new and relatively small firms tend to have a strong connection to their local environment and hardly ever move across large distances. In the Netherlands, 75 % of all moving firms even stays within the same municipality, to business parks or to other neighbourhoods (RPB, 2007). Aspects of the building (e. g. size) are the most likely reason to move, but does the neighbourhood itself matter as well? We look to what extent neighbourhood aspects influence or have influenced the decision to stay or move, both on the push and the pull side. These aspects {{may be related to the}} local physical environment or the safety situation, but also to the local social community. There is recent evidence that localized firm support network contacts contribute positively to firm success (Sleutjes & Schutjens, 2009). Local personal and professional relationships may tie firms to their local environment. If certain neighbourhood characteristics or localized networks turn out to be pull or push factors for entrepreneurs, this might interest policy makers aiming at stimulating the neighbourhood economy by attracting and retaining entrepreneurs within certain urban neighbourhoods. Basically, three questions will be answered in this paper: 1. To what extent do social and physical neighbourhood characteristics play a role in a firm's decision to stay or move? 2. How do localized firm support networks influence a firm's decision to stay put within a certain neighbourhood or not? 3. To what extent do moving firms keep in touch with local network contacts from their former neighbourhood? We conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews among 40 entrepreneurs from five similar Dutch neighbourhoods. The sample is equally divided between firms that stayed and firms that recently moved out of the neighbourhood (20 / 20). The survey provides detailed information on the characteristics and the performance of firms, as well as network contacts, neighbourhood attachment, location choice, and the <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>location</b> aspects. We make use of qualitative methods in order to analyze our data...|$|E

40|$|Hedonic house price {{modelling}} {{has been}} used extensively in the <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> locational externalities. However, the theory of how locational externalities impact upon house prices is not reflected in the traditional measurement s <b>of</b> <b>location</b> used in these studies. The result is that many hedonic house price models suffer from parameter estimates that are either insignificant or counterintuitive. In this paper I attempt to move towards a more realistic <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> locational externalities by examining the effects <b>of</b> <b>location</b> upon house prices from a geographical {{as opposed to a}} purely economic perspective. A multilevel conceptualisation is presented, which takes into account the spatial effects of locational externalities upon house prices. A location-sensitive GIS of Cardiff and a multilevel specification of the hedonic model is then used to model these effects. I conclude that a more realistic treatment <b>of</b> <b>location</b> is required if locational externalities are to be valued successfully. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{determine}} the mechanism that a rational, profit-maximizing seller {{would use to}} revise his reservation price for a heterogeneous or infrequently exchanged good. For instance, while one dimension of a home's quality may be easily determined in competitive markets (e. g., the <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> floor size, <b>location,</b> etc.), other dimensions of quality may be idiosyncratic (unit specific) and unobservable by the seller (e. g., aesthetics of the home). Here, a seller of a new or infrequently exchanged housing unit may use sales success information to revise his expectation of the unit's market-determined value and hence revise his reservation price. The rational seller will, upon arrival of the first buyer inspecting the unit, determine a sequence of reservation prices for this and expected subsequent buyers. This price sequence falls for subsequent buyers and starts from a lower initial price if the first buyer arrives later than expected. Through this mechanism, we offer an explanation for price dispersion and vacancy durations in housing markets. While we explicitly model {{the real estate market}} here, this price revision mechanism is also applicable to rental markets, labor markets, used car markets, and other markets characterized by heterogeneity and infrequent sales.

40|$|Banks’ <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> {{goodwill}} {{has been}} questioned by analysts and the media. Analysts suggest that bank management as of {{the inception of the}} financial crisis have exploited the unverifiable fair value goodwill accounting opportunistically. This suggestion implicitly implies that bank management was more likely than management of other industries to exploit goodwill accounting during the financial turmoil. In this thesis, I test whether the value relevance <b>of</b> banks’ <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> goodwill was affected differently than other industries during the financial turmoil. To do so, I use the value relevance of the pharmaceutical industry’s <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> goodwill as a control group for banks. Further, I hypothesize that (1) banks’ <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> goodwill was value irrelevant since investors should have impounded the information of the analysts in the stock price; (2) pharmaceutical industry’s <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> goodwill was value relevant since the financial turmoil did not severely affect its core business.

Moreover, the empirical result indicates that banks’ <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> goodwill was not less value relevant than the pharmaceuticals’ <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> goodwill. In summary, banks’ <b>valuation</b> <b>of</b> goodwill seems to have been value relevant during the financial turmoil. MSc in Accountin...|$|R
