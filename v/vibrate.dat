5|$|Male Zygoballus sexpunctatus spiders {{are known}} to exhibit {{elaborate}} courtship displays. As a male approaches a female, it will typically raise and spread its first pair of legs and <b>vibrate</b> its abdomen. If the female is receptive, it will often <b>vibrate</b> its abdomen as well. The specific patterns of courtship behavior, however, vary between individuals.|$|E
5|$|Epicoxal hypothesis: This theory {{suggested}} that a possible origin for insect wings {{might have been the}} movable abdominal gills found in many aquatic insects, such as on naiads of mayflies. According to this theory these tracheal gills, which started their way as exits of the respiratory system and over time were modified into locomotive purposes, eventually developed into wings. The tracheal gills are equipped with little winglets that perpetually <b>vibrate</b> and have their own tiny straight muscles.|$|E
5|$|Harmless watersnakes of {{the genus}} Nerodia are often mistaken for it. These are also semiaquatic, thick-bodied snakes with large heads that can be {{aggressive}} when provoked, but they behave differently. For example, watersnakes usually flee quickly into the water, while A. piscivorus often stands its ground with its threat display. In addition, watersnakes do not <b>vibrate</b> their tails when excited. A. piscivorus usually holds its head at an angle around 45° when swimming or crawling.|$|E
40|$|Abstract – In this paper, a novel <b>vibrating</b> method {{based on}} the {{principle}} of <b>vibrating</b> suction method is presented, which is called pulse <b>vibrating</b> method. To discuss this method in depth and evaluate its performance, simplified mathematical model based on some assumptions for both the previous sin <b>vibrating</b> method and the pulse <b>vibrating</b> method are built, and a new experimental platform is developed as well to verify the validity of the mathematical models. The experiments indicate that the experiments meet the mathematical model with only small deviation caused by some unknown factors. The experimental results also show that the pulse <b>vibrating</b> method is much better than the sin <b>vibrating</b> method for higher negative air pressure and less power consumption. At the end of this paper, conclusion is given and future work is proposed to further analyze the principle of the <b>vibrating</b> suction method.

5|$|It {{is usually}} {{possible}} for a mechanical part to <b>vibrate</b> {{in a number of}} different modes, however the design will be based on a particular vibrational mode and the designer will take steps to try to restrict the resonance to this mode. As well as the straightforward longitudinal mode some others which are used include flexural mode, torsional mode, radial mode and drumhead mode.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Swinton O. Scott III. In the opening shot of the episode, the bus that the children travel in to the field trip had to <b>vibrate</b> up and down {{to give the impression}} that it did not have bumpers and that it was falling apart. Scott said it was difficult to animate the scene because of the vibrating and the backgrounds panning. Milhouse's tutor in the episode is based on the American actor Tony Randall.|$|E
5|$|Various {{courtship}} behaviours {{have been}} observed among mecopterans, with males often emitting pheromones to attract mates. The male may provide an edible gift such as a dead insect or a brown salivary secretion to the female. Some boreids have hook-like wings which the male uses {{to pick up and}} place the female on his back while copulating. Male panorpids <b>vibrate</b> their wings or even stridulate while approaching a female.|$|E

5|$|Crystals {{are often}} {{idealized}} as being perfectly periodic. In that ideal case, the atoms are positioned on a perfect lattice, the electron density is perfectly periodic, and the Fourier transform F(q) is zero except when q {{belongs to the}} reciprocal lattice (the so-called Bragg peaks). In reality, however, crystals are not perfectly periodic; atoms <b>vibrate</b> about their mean position, {{and there may be}} disorder of various types, such as mosaicity, dislocations, various point defects, and heterogeneity in the conformation of crystallized molecules. Therefore, the Bragg peaks have a finite width and there may be significant diffuse scattering, a continuum of scattered X-rays that fall between the Bragg peaks.|$|E
5|$|In {{their shared}} hotel room Walter keeps Peter awake by reciting the {{chemical}} formula for root beer. The next morning Peter expresses his unhappiness with the arrangement to Olivia (Anna Torv) and tells her {{he wants to}} leave. She can't let him do that, telling him that Walter refuses to work without him. The Fringe Team investigates the object that arrived in Brooklyn, a cylinder that is determined to <b>vibrate</b> at a particular frequency. In {{the course of the}} investigation, Walter assaults and forcibly sedates Junior Agent Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole) in order to hide the cylinder. He later meets with the bald man at a diner.|$|E
5|$|Sound that {{travels through}} the outer ear {{impacts on the}} eardrum, and causes it to <b>vibrate.</b> The three {{ossicles}} bones transmit this sound to a second window (the oval window) which protects the fluid-filled inner ear. In detail, the pinna of the outer ear helps to focus a sound, which impacts on the eardrum. The malleus rests on the membrane, and receives the vibration. This vibration is transmitted along the incus and stapes to the oval window. Two small muscles, the tensor tympani and stapedius, also help modulate noise. The two muscles reflexively contract to dampen excessive vibrations. Vibration of the oval window causes vibration of the endolymph within the vestibule and the cochlea.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Articulatory <b>vibrating</b> {{screen is}} {{composed}} of multi-section screen with articulatory <b>vibrating.</b> The principle of even-thickness screening is referenced on its layout, with linear <b>vibrating</b> screen as the discharge end, with round <b>vibrating</b> screens as the feeding end, and also the intermediate screen. In accordance with the structural features of articulatory <b>vibrating</b> screen and under the condition of assembly module in Pro/E, mechanical components of articulatory <b>vibrating</b> screen are assembled {{in the light of}} the arrangement, the sequence, the restrictions and the modifications of installation. With the visualized research on the operational process, the three-dimensional illustrations of assembly model are established to ensure the correct design on every mechanical component of articulatory <b>vibrating</b> screen. The finite element model of <b>vibrating</b> screen is set up by its analysis software to carry out the analysis of finite element calculation and modal according to two operating modes of the regular work and the machine halt beyond resonance region. The analysis result indicates that the intensity and the rigidity of the <b>vibrating</b> screen are safe; the machine operation is stable; and no resonance phenomenon would happen. This study provides the theoretical reference for the design of similar machinery. It is of practical importance and economic value to apply the visualized design method into the design of articulatory <b>vibrating</b> screen...|$|R
5|$|Bees {{beat their}} wings about 200 times a second. Their thorax muscles do not {{contract}} on each nerve firing, but rather <b>vibrate</b> like a plucked rubber band. This is efficient, since it lets the system consisting of muscle and wing operate at its resonant frequency, leading to low energy consumption. Further, it is necessary, since insect motor nerves generally cannot fire 200 times per second. These types of muscles are called asynchronous muscles and {{are found in}} the insect wing systems in families such as Hymenoptera, Diptera, Coleoptera, and Hemiptera. Bumblebees must warm up their bodies considerably to get airborne at low ambient temperatures. Bumblebees have been known to reach an internal thoracic temperature of 30°C (86°F) using this method.|$|E
5|$|Before mating, {{males and}} females may stridulate, or <b>vibrate</b> the objects they are on. In the Meloidae, the male climbs onto the dorsum of the female and strokes his {{antennae}} on her head, palps, and antennae. In Eupompha, the male draws his antennae along his longitudinal vertex. They may not mate at all {{if they do not}} perform the precopulatory ritual. This mating behaviour may be different amongst dispersed populations of the same species. For example, the mating of a Russian population of tansy beetle (Chysolina graminis) is preceded by an elaborate ritual involving the male tapping the female's eyes, pronotum and antennae with its antennae, which is not evident in the population of this species in the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Male mole crickets sing by stridulating, always underground. In Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa {{the song}} {{is based on an}} almost pure tone at 3.5 kiloHertz, loud enough to make the ground <b>vibrate</b> 20cm all round the burrow; in fact {{the song is}} unique in each species. In Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa the burrow is {{somewhat}} roughly sculpted; in Gryllotalpa vineae, the burrow is smooth and carefully shaped, with no irregularities larger than 1 millimetre. In both species the burrow {{takes the form of a}} double exponential horn with twin openings at the soil surface; at the other end there is a constriction, then a resonating bulb, and then an escape tunnel. A burrow is used for at least a week. The male positions himself head down with his head in the bulb, his tail near the fork in the tunnel.|$|E

5|$|String {{theory is}} a {{theoretical}} framework that attempts to reconcile gravity and quantum mechanics. In string theory, the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. String theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other. In a given version of string theory, {{there is only one}} kind of string, which may look like a small loop or segment of ordinary string, and it can <b>vibrate</b> in different ways. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string will look just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. In this way, all of the different elementary particles may be viewed as vibrating strings. One of the vibrational states of a string gives rise to the graviton, a quantum mechanical particle that carries gravitational force.|$|E
5|$|The fixed {{reed and}} fairly uniform {{diameter}} of the clarinet give the instrument an acoustical behavior approximating that of a cylindrical stopped pipe. Recorders use a tapered internal bore to overblow at the octave when the thumb/register hole is pinched open, while the clarinet, with its cylindrical bore, overblows at the 12th. Adjusting {{the angle of the}} bore taper controls the frequencies of the overblown notes (harmonics). Changing the mouthpiece's tip opening and the length of the reed changes aspects of the harmonic timbre or voice of the clarinet because this changes the speed of reed vibrations. Generally, the goal of the clarinetist when producing a sound is to make as much of the reed <b>vibrate</b> as possible, making the sound fuller, warmer, and potentially louder.|$|E
5|$|Another {{feature of}} the wing was its washout. The {{trailing}} edge of the wing twisted slightly upward along its span, the angle of incidence decreasing from +2° at its root to -½° at its tip. This caused the wing roots to stall before the tips, reducing tip-stall that could otherwise {{have resulted in a}} wing drop, often leading to a spin. As the wing roots started to stall, the separating air stream started to buffet (<b>vibrate)</b> the aircraft, warning the pilot, and hence allowing even relatively inexperienced pilots to fly the aircraft to the limits of its performance. This washout was first featured in the wing of the Type 224 and became a consistent feature in subsequent designs leading to the Spitfire. The complexity of the wing design, especially the precision required to manufacture the vital spar and leading-edge structures, at first caused some major hold-ups in the production of the Spitfire. The problems increased when the work was put out to subcontractors, most of whom had never dealt with metal-structured, high-speed aircraft. By June 1939, most of these problems had been resolved, and production was no longer held up by a lack of wings.|$|E

Then the <b>vibrating</b> system is optimization designed based on the conditions of implementing stable self-synchronous operation. The simulation program with proper parameters of <b>vibrating</b> system is run, and {{the results show that}} the system is in a good synchronous state. Computer simulations demonstrate that the <b>vibrating</b> system realizes speed synchronization and phase synchronization. The results verify the effectiveness of the optimization design...|$|R
50|$|To {{assess the}} {{bubbling}} behaviour of the <b>vibrating</b> fluidized bed, {{factors such as}} the size of the bubble and its velocity were also taken into account. For various vibration amplitudes and frequencies, numerical simulations of the <b>vibrating</b> fluidized bed was conducted to better understand the behaviour of the bubbles under the <b>vibrating</b> conditions. The results showed that due to the oscillatory displacement of the <b>vibrating</b> fluidized bed causes the mean bubble diameter to increase but lowers the acceleration rate of the bubbles. Thus, it was concluded that bubbling behaviour in a <b>vibrating</b> fluidized bed in dependent on the vibrations.|$|R

5|$|Populations from Los Baños {{and from}} Sagada, {{both in the}} Philippines, have {{slightly}} different hunting tactics, and Los Baños has some very dangerous prey spiders. In laboratory tests, Los Baños P. labiatas rely more on trial and error than Sagada P. labiatas in finding ways to <b>vibrate</b> the prey's web and thus lure or distract the prey. Around Los Baños the web-building Scytodes pallida, which preys on jumping spiders, is very abundant. All members of the genus Scytodes spit a sticky gum on prey and potential threats, and this can immobilise a Portia {{long enough for the}} Scytodes to wrap the Portia in silk and then bite it. Around Los Baños, P. labiata instinctively detours round the back of S. pallida that is not carrying eggs while with plucking the web {{in a way that makes}} S. pallida believe the threat is in front of it. P. labiata prefers to stalk a female S. pallida carrying eggs, as then S. pallida is reluctant to drop the eggs in order to spit, and in this case P. labiata sometimes uses a direct attack. In areas where S. pallida is absent, the local members of P. labiata do not use this combination of plucking other spiders' webs to deceive the prey and detouring for a stab in the back.|$|E
5|$|The male wanders as {{an adult}} and in August or September goes looking for the females' webs to mate. The male will enter the female's web and <b>vibrate</b> the silk as he {{approaches}} her. The female is usually aggressive at first and will chase the male from the web. The Courtship process consists of the male bobbing, plucking and tweaking the web along with periods of cautious approach and being chased by the female. Eventually, when she becomes docile and allows him to approach, the male will then approach the female as she hangs quietly upside down in the web. The male moves onto her ventral abdomen, tapping her rapidly until she moves to align his abdomen above hers. He then inserts his palps one at a time, leaving the female between each insertion. Copulation occurs over 10 to 30 minutes. After mating, the male retreats to groom, which is performed by running his palps and legs through his fangs and wiping them over his body. The male is not eaten by the female unlike some other widow spiders.|$|E
5|$|The most basal of {{the living}} teleosts are the Elopomorpha (eels and allies) and the Osteoglossomorpha (elephantfishes and allies). There are 800 species of elopomorphs. They have thin leaf-shaped larvae known as leptocephali, {{specialised}} for a marine environment. Among the elopomorphs, eels have elongated bodies with lost pelvic girdles and ribs and fused elements in the upper jaw. The 200 species of osteoglossomorphs are defined by a bony element in the tongue. This element has a basibranchial behind it, and both structures have large teeth which are paired with the teeth on the parasphenoid in {{the roof of the}} mouth. The clade Otocephala includes the Clupeiformes (herrings) and Ostariophysi (carps, catfishes and allies). Clupeiformes consist of 350 living species of herring and herring-like fishes. This group is characterised by an unusual abdominal scute and a different arrangement of the hypurals. In most species, the swim bladder extends to the braincase and plays a role in hearing. Ostariophysi, which includes most freshwater fishes, have developed some unique adaptations. One is the Weberian apparatus, an arrangement of bones (Weberian ossicles) connecting the swim bladder to the inner ear. This enhances their hearing, as sound waves make the bladder <b>vibrate,</b> and the bones transport the vibrations to the inner ear. They also have a chemical alarm system; when a fish is injured, the warning substance gets in the water, alarming nearby fish.|$|E

50|$|In a <b>vibrating</b> {{fluidized}} bed, {{energy is}} transferred when the <b>vibrating</b> wall comes {{into contact with}} the particles. These particles collide with other particles in the bed which passes kinetic energy in the form of wave propagation throughout the <b>vibrating</b> fluidized bed. The magnitude of the energy transferred is relative to the amplitude. This is because of the oscillations caused by the wave reflection of the medium boundary in the <b>vibrating</b> fluidized bed.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Many {{companies}} {{have tried to}} develop the horizontally <b>vibrating</b> linear motor, for sliming the smart phone. Mathematical modeling and analysis is one of method to simulate the dynamic performance of the horizonatally <b>vibrating</b> linear motor. However, the horizontally <b>vibrating</b> linear motor <b>vibrates</b> in twisting mode because {{there are two kinds}} of force acting on the <b>vibrating</b> part.
