50|$|<b>Voanioala</b> gerardii, {{commonly}} known as the forest coconut, is a species of flowering plant in the Arecaceae family. It is a large coconut relative that is generally regarded as monotypic within the genus <b>Voanioala.</b> However a team of geneticists headed by Bee F. Gunn found sufficient genetic variation within <b>Voanioala</b> to constitute at least two and possibly four cryptospecies. It is endemic to Madagascar. It is threatened by habitat loss and harvest for its edible seeds and palm heart, and it is estimated that there are fewer than fifteen mature trees remaining.|$|E

50|$|<b>Voanioala</b> gerardii is {{critically}} endangered {{because of its}} scarcity. Only 10-15 trees are found. They are cut down for their edible palm hearts and their seeds are used for market trade. They are also rare because of its poor dispersal of seeds. Habitat loss through agricultural logging threatens forest coconuts as well. The national park in Masoala Peninsula is protecting the forest coconuts on its property, and its future depends greatly on the effort of the national park. Its population is currently decreasing.|$|E

The critically endangered <b>Voanioala</b> gerardii and the endangered Lemurophoenix halleuxii are two palm species from monospecific genera endemic to Madagascar that overlap in their distribution within this region. This project undertook field surveys of all known populations of these two species to document their population sizes and locations. We modelled their area of potentially suitable habitat within the region and undertook genetic analysis to investigate genetic diversity and relatedness among populations of each species. The study found overlapping but contrasting patterns of potential habitat. It also found contrasting levels and patterns of genetic diversity between the two species that were not consistent with the modelled habitat distributions. We found that <b>Voanioala</b> gerardii populations are critically small but contain unexpectedly high levels of genetic diversity, which may indicate as yet undiscovered populations remaining. An active program to change methods of seed collection and to involve local villagers and land managers in the conservation of these species would be required to prevent their extinction...|$|E
40|$|PREMISE OF THE STUDY: The genome size of {{a species}} (C-value) is {{associated}} with growth, development and adaptation to environmental changes. Angiosperm C-values range 1200 -fold and frequently vary within species, although {{little is known about}} the impacts of domestication on genome size. Genome size variation among related species of palms is of evolutionary significance because changes characterize clades and may be associated with polyploidy, transposon amplifications, deletions, or rearrangements. Further knowledge of genome size will provide crucial information needed for planning of whole genome sequencing and accurate annotations. We studied the genome size of Cocos nucifera and its variation among cultivars, and compared it to values for related palms from the Attaleinae subtribe. METHODS: Flow cytometric analysis of isolated nuclei from young palm leaves was used to estimate genome sizes of 23 coconut cultivars (Talls, Dwarfs, and hybrids) worldwide and 17 Cocoseae species. Ancestral genome size was reconstructed on a maximum likelihood phylogeny of Attaleinae from seven WRKY loci. KEY RESULTS: The coconut genome is large-averaging 5. 966 pg-and shows intraspecific variation associated with domestication. Variation among Tall coconuts was significantly greater than among Dwarfs. Attaleinae genomes showed moderate size variation across genera, except polyploids Jubaeopsis caffra, <b>Voanioala</b> gerardii, Beccariophoenix alfredii, and Allagoptera caudescens, which had larger genomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results contribute to the understanding of the relationship between domestication and genome size in long-lived tree crops and provide a basis for whole-genome sequencing of the coconut and other domesticated plants. Polyploidy evolved independently in two clades within Attaleinae. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
