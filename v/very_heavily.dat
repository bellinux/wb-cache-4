In a March 2012 interview, Hopsin {{said that he}} talked to Tech N9ne about appearing on the album, which Tech N9ne agreed to. He also stated in 2012 that he wanted Yelawolf on the album.|$|E
5|$|Ireland {{remained}} {{ruled by}} native kings into the 12th century, largely {{without the use}} of castles. There was a history of Irish fortifications called ráths, a type of ringfort, some of which were <b>very</b> <b>heavily</b> defended but which are not usually considered to be castles in the usual sense of the word. The kings of Connacht constructed fortifications from 1124 which they called caistel or caislen, from the Latin and French for castle, and there has been considerable academic debate over how far these resembled European castles.|$|E

5|$|Over nine-tenths of {{the total}} biomass on Earth is plant life, on which animal life depends <b>very</b> <b>heavily</b> for its existence. More than 2 million species {{of plant and animal}} life have been {{identified}} to date, and estimates of the actual number of existing species range from several million to well over 50million. The number of individual species of life is constantly in some degree of flux, with new species appearing and others ceasing to exist on a continual basis. The total number of species is in rapid decline.|$|E
5|$|A {{large part}} of the massif is covered by ice fields and is cut by {{numerous}} glaciers, mostly flowing northwestwards on the French side; southeastwards on the Italian side and eastwards on the Swiss side. With much steeper slopes on the Italian side, many glaciers drop very sharply and some, such as the Miage Glacier and the Brenva Glacier, are <b>very</b> <b>heavily</b> covered in rock debris. The massif is itself defined by broad valleys which formed along fault lines and which have subsequently been shaped by ice during the last glacial period of the ice age.|$|E
5|$|According {{to current}} knowledge, B.sessilis as an {{extremely}} hardy plant that {{grows in a}} range of soils and aspects, so long as it is given good drainage, and tolerates both drought and moderate frost. Unlike many dryandras, it grows well on limestone (alkaline) soils. It flowers <b>very</b> <b>heavily</b> and is an excellent producer of honey. It attracts birds, and is also popular with beekeepers. However, its size makes it unsuitable for smaller gardens, and if given an ideal situation it may produce a great many seedlings. It is propagated only from seed, as propagating it from cuttings has proven virtually impossible. Germination takes about five or six weeks, and plants may take two years to flower.|$|E

5|$|During {{the ensuing}} German occupation, {{it became the}} command post for German forces in the Pas-de-Calais/Flanders region and was <b>very</b> <b>heavily</b> fortified, as it was {{generally}} believed by the Germans that the Allies would invade at that point. It was also used as a launch site for V1 flying bombs and {{for much of the}} war, the Germans used the region as the site for railway guns used to bombard the south-eastern corner of England. In 1943 they built massive bunkers along the coast in preparation for launching missiles on the southeast of England. Despite heavy preparations for defence against an amphibious assault, the Allied invasion took place well to the west in Normandy on D-Day. Calais was <b>very</b> <b>heavily</b> bombed and shelled in a successful effort to disrupt German communications and persuade them that the Allies would target the Pas-de-Calais for invasion (rather than Normandy). The town, by then largely in ruins, was liberated by General Daniel Spry's 3rd Canadian Infantry Division between 25 September and 1 October 1944. On 27 February 1945 Calais suffered a last bombing raid—this time by British bombers who mistook the town for Dunkirk, which was at that time still occupied by German forces. After the war there was little rebuilding of the historic city and most buildings were modern ones.|$|E
5|$|Pushkar Lake and its precincts become <b>very</b> <b>heavily</b> {{populated}} {{during the}} annual Pushkar Fair or Pushkar mela, which has both a religious {{as well as}} an economic aspect. During the fair, a very large gathering of pilgrims takes a holy dip in the lake and the camel fair is an adjunct celebration. Pushkar Fair commences on Prabodhini Ekadashi, the 11th lunar day in the bright fortnight and ends on Kartik Poornima – the full Moon day in the month of Kartik (October–November), the latter being the most important day of the fair. This fair is held in the honour of god Brahma. A ritual bath on Kartik Poornima in the Pushkar Lake is considered to lead one to salvation. It is believed circling the three Pushkars on Kartik Poornima is highly meritorious. Sadhus, Hindu holy men, gather here and stay from the Ekadashi to full moon day in caves. The Pushkar fair is also Asia's largest camel fair. The colourful and lively Camel Fair reportedly attracts 2 lakh people and 50,000 camels. In this fair held {{on the banks of the}} lake, camels are very colourfully decorated and paraded in the sand dunes on the southern part of the lake. Tribes from several neighbouring villages are seen in their traditional colourful costumes. The fair on Kartik Poornima, the day when Brahma is believed to have concluded his Yagna establishing the lake. It is organized by the Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation (RTDC), Pushkar Municipal Board and the Animal Husbandry Department of Rajasthan. The fair is a colourful cultural event also with folk dances, music, camel races and the cattle fair. The tug of war is a popular entertaining sport held during the fair. This event is held between the Rajasthanis and foreigners; locals invariably win the event.|$|E

25|$|The drain induced barrier {{lowering}} of the threshold voltage and channel length modulation effects upon I-V curves are reduced by using shallow junction extensions. In addition, halo doping can be used, that is, {{the addition of}} <b>very</b> thin <b>heavily</b> doped regions of the same doping type as the body tight against the junction walls to limit the extent of depletion regions.|$|R
50|$|The {{trade balance}} gap between Tanzania and Saudi Arabia is <b>very</b> large, <b>heavily</b> favored to Saudi Arabia. In 2013, Saudi Arabia {{exported}} $220 {{million worth of}} goods to Tanzania, mainly refined petroleum and polymer products. While in 2013, Tanzania only exported $20.7 million worth of goods to Saudi Arabia; mainly Tanzania's exports to Saudi Arabia are low value agriculture products such as vegetables, fish and raw tobacco.|$|R

25|$|The {{extent to}} which Dodgson's Alice may be or could be {{identified}} with Liddell is controversial. The two Alices are clearly not identical, and though it was long assumed that the fictional Alice was based <b>very</b> <b>heavily</b> on Liddell, recent research has contradicted this assumption. Dodgson himself claimed in later years that his Alice was entirely imaginary and not based upon any real child at all.|$|E

50|$|When two red tails cohabitate, {{they have}} been known to become {{territorial}} with one another as they mature. One shark will become dominant and will continually chase and harass the submissive shark. Larger groups from a pair when young but five or more when mature surprisingly, tend to get along much better than two or three when mature as they will establish a stable hierarchy; such a group will require a <b>very</b> large <b>heavily</b> planted aquarium, however.|$|R
50|$|Roman {{literature}} was from its <b>very</b> inception influenced <b>heavily</b> by Greek authors. Some {{of the earliest}} works currently discovered are of historical epics telling the early military history of Rome. As the Republic expanded, authors began to produce poetry, comedy, history, and tragedy.|$|R
25|$|The firm {{promotes}} <b>very</b> <b>heavily</b> from within, {{most notably}} in its executive suite. The company has resisted the trend toward outsider CEOs. Paul Otellini was a 30-year veteran of the company when he {{assumed the role of}} CEO. All of his top lieutenants have risen through the ranks after many years with the firm. In many cases, Intel's top executives have spent their entire working careers with Intel.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to Richardson's consistency and strenuous work, Lockwood was never capable of long bowling spells. He bowled off a much shorter run than Richardson {{and tended to}} come down <b>very</b> <b>heavily</b> in his delivery stride. Lockwood could break back, though rarely as sharply as Richardson, but what really set Lockwood apart was his unpredictability, with extremely subtle variations of pace and pitch characterising his bowling. Frequently Lockwood would deliver a slow ball without change of action and the batsman would claim they never expected it.|$|E

40|$|New {{efficient}} {{mechanism of}} obtaining spin polarization in_nonmagnetic_ semiconductors at arbitrary temperutures is described. The effect appears during tunneling of electrons from a nonmagnetic semiconductors (S) into ferromagnet (FM) through a Schottky barrier modified with <b>very</b> thin <b>heavily</b> doped interfacial layer. We show that electrons {{with a certain}} spin projection are extracted from S, while electrons with the opposite spins are accumulated in S. The spin density increases and spin penetration depth decreases with current. Comment: 4 pages, 2 figure...|$|R

25|$|While both land {{ambulance}} service providers do have paid staff, they also rely <b>very</b> <b>heavily</b> on volunteer members. In most cases, paid staff {{tend to be}} concentrated in urban areas and {{in the management of}} rural areas, with rural response staff being largely volunteer-based. St. John Ambulance reports a total of 2,211 paid staff in New Zealand, supplemented by 7,647 volunteers. By contrast, Wellington Free Ambulance currently staffs 108 paid paramedics and 35 volunteers, not including the 21 paid staff and 21 auxiliary (volunteer) staff previously from the Wairarapa DHB service.|$|E
25|$|The wrist of Confuciusornis shows fusion, {{forming a}} carpometacarpus. The {{second and third}} metacarpals were also {{partially}} fused, but the first was unfused, and the fingers could freely move relative to each other. The second metacarpal, which supported the flight feathers, was <b>very</b> <b>heavily</b> built; its finger carries a small claw. The claw of the first finger to the contrary was very large and curved. The stub-like third metacarpal, which supported the calami of the feathers, was probably enclosed in {{the flesh of the}} hand. The formula of the finger phalanges was 2-3-4-0-0.|$|E
25|$|His successor, Frank Blake, {{previously}} {{served as}} the company's {{vice chairman of the}} board and executive vice president. Blake agreed to a much more conservative compensation package than Nardelli, that is <b>very</b> <b>heavily</b> dependent upon the success of the company. Although a longtime deputy to Nardelli at GE and Home Depot, Blake was said to lack Nardelli's hard edge and instead preferred to make decisions by consensus. Indeed, Blake repudiated many of his predecessor's strategies, and {{it has been reported that}} the two men have not spoken since Nardelli departed Home Depot.|$|E
50|$|Melbourne's thrash {{scene was}} also {{on the rise in}} the 1980s, with bands like Renegade and Rampage {{recording}} albums. Hobbs' Angel of Death released their self-titled album in 1988 through German label Steamhammer/SPV Records. Possibly one of the heaviest Australian recordings of its time, Hobbs' Angel of Death showcased a <b>very</b> distinct, <b>heavily</b> Satanic, Slayer-influenced sound. While initially intended as a studio project, Hobbs' Angel of Death would play a few shows before ending {{at the turn of the}} decade, but would reform several times over the next few years.|$|R
