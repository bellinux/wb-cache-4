25|$|The <b>varicella</b> <b>vaccine</b> is {{recommended}} in many countries. Some countries require the varicella vaccination or an exemption before entering elementary school. A second dose {{is recommended}} {{five years after}} the initial immunization. A vaccinated person is likely to have a milder case of chickenpox if they become infected. Immunization within three days following household contact reduces infection rates and severity in children.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{approved}} the <b>Varicella</b> <b>vaccine</b> to prevent chickenpox. Its effect on postherpetic neuralgia is still unknown. The vaccine—made from a weakened {{form of the}} varicella-zoster virus—may keep chickenpox from occurring in nonimmune children and adults, or at least lessen {{the risk of the}} chickenpox virus lying dormant in the body and reactivating later as shingles. If shingles could be prevented, postherpetic neuralgia could be completely avoided.|$|E
40|$|Evidence {{concerning}} {{the effectiveness of}} Oka-based <b>varicella</b> <b>vaccines</b> when administered following exposure to varicella zoster virus in domestic and hospital settings is reviewed. The evidence appears to support post-exposure use of Oka-derived <b>varicella</b> <b>vaccines</b> in children within 3 days of rash onset in the index case. Despite vaccination, a small proportion will develop mild, but infectious, chickenpox, especially {{if they have been}} exposed in the household setting. Controlled studies of post-exposure prophylaxis in adults using both Varilrix and Varivax II are still needed. The applicability of this approach to disease control in health care facilities and in community settings warrants wider discussion. Commun Dis Intell 2001; 25 : 13 - 15...|$|R
40|$|What is {{the risk}} of {{seizures}} from live virus vaccines? Evidence-Based Answer: MMR (measles-mumps-rubella) vaccine may increase the short-term risk of febrile seizure compared with nonvaccination (SOR: B, systematic review of cohort studies). MMRV (combination measles-mumps-rubellavaricella) vaccine may also be {{associated with an increased}} short-term risk of febrile seizures compared with MMR and <b>varicella</b> <b>vaccines</b> given separately (SOR: B, based on retrospective study). It is unlikely that administration of live-attenuated influenza <b>vaccine,</b> <b>varicella,</b> zoster, yellow fever, oral polio, or rotavirus vaccines affect seizure risk (SOR: C, based on expert opinion) ...|$|R
50|$|For {{children}} age two and younger, the MMRV {{vaccine is}} associated with more adverse events compared to separate administration of MMR and varicella vaccinations on the same day. There are 4.3 additional febrile seizures per 10,000 vaccinated children (95% CI 2.6-5.6), 7.5 additional mostly mild fever episodes per 100 vaccinated children (95% CI, 5.4-9.4) and 1.1 additional measles-like rash per 100 children (95% CI, 0.2-1.8). Febrile seizures cased by the MMRV vaccine occur 7 to 10 days after vaccination. In children age 4-6, {{there is no evidence}} for an increased risk in febrile seizures after MMRV compared to the separate administration of MMR and <b>Varicella</b> <b>vaccines.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Varicella</b> <b>vaccine,</b> {{also known}} as {{chickenpox}} vaccine, is a vaccine that protects against chickenpox. One dose of vaccine prevents 95% of moderate disease and 100% of severe disease. Two doses of vaccine are more effective than one. If given {{to those who are}} not immune within five days of exposure to chickenpox it prevents most cases of disease. Vaccinating {{a large portion of the}} population also protects those who are not vaccinated. It is given by injection just under the skin.|$|E
25|$|The {{chickenpox}} vaccine {{first became}} commercially available in 1984. A mean of 2,350 reports per year of an adverse event the occurs {{some time after}} <b>varicella</b> <b>vaccine</b> is administered, based on 20,004 cases reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database from May 1995 through December 2003; however, this includes all adverse events, whether or not caused by the vaccine and some events are to be statistically expected regardless (independent of any vaccine administration). VAERS reports do not imply any finding of causation. Minor events {{are known to be}} underreported to VAERS.|$|E
25|$|Mumps is {{preventable}} by two {{doses of}} the mumps vaccine. Most of the developed world includes it in their immunization programs, often in combination with measles, rubella, and <b>varicella</b> <b>vaccine.</b> Countries that have low immunization rates may see an increase in cases among older age groups and thus worse outcomes. There is no specific treatment. Efforts involve controlling symptoms with pain medication such as paracetamol (acetaminophen). Intravenous immunoglobulin {{may be useful in}} certain complications. Hospitalization may be required if meningitis or pancreatitis develops. About one per ten thousand people who are infected die.|$|E
25|$|As measles and rubella cause upper {{respiratory}} disease {{that leads to}} complications of pneumonia and bronchitis which are also caused by <b>varicella,</b> MMR <b>vaccine</b> is beneficial to control exacerbations of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) and asthma.|$|R
40|$|In Italy, the {{introduction}} of Universal Varicella Vaccination (UVV) has been decided but postponed, as a national programme, until 2015, when data from Regions which have already implemented it will be available. Starting from 2003, eight Italian Regions (Basilicata, Calabria, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Apulia, Sardinia, Sicily, Tuscany and Veneto) have progressively introduced UVV, in their immunization programme, with different schedules in children aged 13 - 15 months and 5 - 6 years, currently a two-dose schedule is adopted by all Regions. In June 2013, an Interregional Group on Varicella Vaccination (IGVV) {{has been established in}} order to assess the effectiveness of varicella vaccination with standardized and shared tools. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the impact of varicella vaccination on the incidence and hospitalizations due to varicella and its complications in the period 2003 - 2012 in order to support the Italian decision makers on the future national adoption. Preliminary data showed that a general reduction of incidence and hospitalization rates was observed in the study period, resulting in relevant savings for the National Health Service. Immunization coverage with first dose at 24 months of age was high in all Regions (84 %- 95 %) in 2012. Adverse events due to <b>varicella</b> <b>vaccines</b> were rare and without permanent sequelae. Underreporting of varicella cases and delays in the administration of the first dose of <b>varicella</b> <b>vaccines</b> were the main critical issues. In conclusion, solid evidences in support of universal UVV arise from the experiences available today in Italy...|$|R
40|$|Varicella zoster virus causes {{an acute}} {{infection}} that affects most children globally, but {{the age of}} infection can be greater in residents of tropical areas.

25|$|The <b>varicella</b> <b>vaccine</b> has {{resulted}} in a {{decrease in the number of}} cases and complications from the disease. It protects about 70 to 90 percent of people from disease with a greater benefit for severe disease. Routine immunization of children is recommended in many countries. Immunization within three days of exposure may improve outcomes in children. Treatment of those infected may include calamine lotion to help with itching, keeping the fingernails short to decrease injury from scratching, and the use of paracetamol (acetaminophen) to help with fevers. For those at increased risk of complications antiviral medication such as aciclovir are recommended.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the uses}} of these cell lines is to provide an {{environment}} for virus replication. The Oka/Merck strain of live attenuated varicella virus {{is one of the}} viruses that require this environment to grow. Some controversy has arisen due to the ideas that the vaccine contains components of or has required the use of an aborted fetus, which violates the ethics and beliefs of many who oppose the use of aborted fetuses in medical research. While the cell line provides the environment in which the virus is grown and subsequently isolated from, theoretically, the vaccine itself is free from extraneous biological agents. Nevertheless, Merck & Co., Inc.'s M-M-R®II, ZOSTAVAX® and VARIVAX® vaccine descriptions state that [...] "residual components of MRC-5 cells including DNA and protein" [...] are present in the vaccine. Also, the use of the WI-38 and MRC-5 cell lines for growing the varicella virus is controversial because these human embryonic lung cells were derived from aborted fetuses. Due to beliefs concerning the use of human embryonic fetal tissue in medical research, some individuals are opposed to using the <b>varicella</b> <b>vaccine.</b>|$|E
40|$|The Varicella zoster {{virus is}} a human {{pathogen}} which causes Varicella after primary infection and herpes zoster after secondary reactivation. Both disease manifestations can occur at any age; however, Varicella is seen more commonly in children whilst herpes zoster is mainly observed in the elderly. Although uncommon, disease complications secondary to Varicella may be severe and life-threatening especially at the extremes of age, during pregnancy and in the immunocompromised. Attenuated <b>Varicella</b> <b>vaccines</b> have been successfully formulated to prevent Varicella and its complications and {{are part of the}} routine childhood immunisation programmes in several countries including the US, Canada, Germany and Australia.

40|$|Abstract Background Recurrent benign 6 th nerve palsy in the {{paediatric}} {{age group}} is uncommon, {{but has been}} described following viral and bacterial infections. It has also been temporally associated with immunization, but has not been previously described following two different live attenuated vaccines. Case presentation A case is presented of a 12 month old Caucasian boy with recurrent benign 6 th nerve palsy following measles-mumps-rubella and <b>varicella</b> <b>vaccines,</b> given on separate occasions with complete recovery following each episode. No alternate underlying etiology was identified despite extensive investigations and review. Conclusions The majority of benign 6 th nerve palsies {{do not have a}} sinister cause and have an excellent prognosis, with recovery expected in most cases. The exact pathophysiology is unknown, although hypotheses including autoimmune mechanisms and direct viral invasion could explain the pathophysiology behind immunization related nerve palsies. It is important to rule out other aetiologies with thorough history, physical examination and investigations. There is limited information in the literature regarding the safety of a repeat dose of a live vaccine in this setting. Future immunizations should be considered on a case-by-case basis. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background Chickenpox is {{a common}} {{infectious}} disease among children. Ever since a live attenuated vaccine was developed in 1970 s, different countries have adopted different vaccination program against chickenpox. Hong Kong recently has commenced a routine childhood varicella vaccination program. The objective {{of this study is}} to evaluate whether routine childhood varicella vaccination is cost effective and the implications to Hong Kong. Methodology Literature search was done on electronic databases: Medline and Embase for articles relevant to the topic. A total of 9 articles were retrieved for this systemic review. All 9 studies focus on the cost effectiveness of childhood varicella vaccination with comparison to no vaccination or other interventions. Findings Routine childhood varicella vaccination program is cost effective especially from the societal perspective. The longer the vaccination program takes place, the more cost effective it would be. The cost effectiveness ratio is most sensitive to the coverage rate and the vaccine price. Conclusion It remains unclear whether the routine childhood varicella vaccination program in Hong Kong would be cost effective or not. As the Hong Kong program has adopted the most recent recommendations towards <b>varicella</b> <b>vaccines</b> that the review articles were not included. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Completion of {{multiple}} dose vaccine schedules {{is crucial to}} ensure a protective immune response, and maximise vaccine cost-effectiveness. While barriers and facilitators to vaccine uptake have recently been reviewed, there is no comprehensive review of factors influencing subsequent adherence or completion, which is key to achieving vaccine effectiveness. This study identifies and summarises the literature on factors affecting completion of multi-dose vaccine schedules by adolescents. Methods Ten online databases and four websites were searched (February 2014). Studies with analysis of factors predicting completion of multi-dose vaccines were included. Study participants within 9 – 19 years of age {{were included in the}} review. The defined outcome was completion of the vaccine series within 1  year among those who received the first dose. Results Overall, 6159 abstracts were screened, and 502 full texts were reviewed. Sixty one studies were eligible for this review. All except two were set in high-income countries. Included studies evaluated human papillomavirus vaccine, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and <b>varicella</b> <b>vaccines.</b> Reported vaccine completion rates, among those who initiated vaccination, ranged from 27  % to over 90  %. Minority racial or ethnic groups and inadequate health insurance coverage were risk factors for low completion, irrespective of initiation rates. Parental healthcare seeking behaviour was positively associated with completion. Vaccine delivery in schools was associated with higher completion than delivery in the community or health facilities. Gender, prior healthcare use and socio-economic status rarely remained significant risks or protective factors in multivariate analysis. Conclusions Almost all studies investigating factors affecting completion have been carried out in developed countries and investigate a limited range of variables. Increased understanding of barriers to completion in adolescents will be invaluable to future new vaccine introductions and the further development of an adolescent health platform.
