5000|$|The European Union {{defines a}} VOC as [...] "any organic {{compound}} having an {{initial boiling point}} {{less than or equal}} to 250 C measured at a standard atmospheric pressure of 101.3 kPa." [...] The VOC Solvents Emissions Directive is the main policy instrument for the reduction of industrial emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the European Union. It covers a wide range of solvent using activities, e.g. printing, surface cleaning, vehicle coating, dry cleaning and manufacture of footwear and pharmaceutical products. The VOC Solvents Emissions Directive requires installations in which such activities are applied to comply either with the emission limit values set out in the Directive or with the requirements of the so-called reduction scheme. Article 13 of The Paints Directive, approved in 2004, amended the original VOC Solvents Emissions Directive and limits the use of organic solvents in decorative paints and varnishes and in vehicle finishing products.

5000|$|Along {{with energy}} inefficiency, poor air quality has been another side-effect {{of the post}} air {{conditioning}} building design. Because most modern buildings are temperature controlled, {{they are designed to}} be airtight. The lack of ventilation can not only make buildings expensive to cool, it also traps harmful toxins that can do serious damage to people's respiratory systems. Toxins come from a variety of sources. Materials that make up the library, including paints and carpeting, have volatile organic compounds (VOC's), which produce a ground-level ozone after reacting with sunlight and nitrogen. The carbon dioxide that people breathe into the atmosphere is another toxin. To improve air quality, materials can be bought that have a low <b>VOC</b> <b>content,</b> and CO2 [...] monitors can be installed to ensure that CO2 [...] levels remain at a safe level.

40|$|The {{emission}} of {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOC’s) in pulp and paper mills has been an environmental concern. <b>VOC</b> <b>content</b> and the vapor-liquid phase equilibrium (VLE) of VOC’s in mill streams are the two key factors that dictate VOC emissions.

40|$|This {{document}} {{presents the}} technical justification for choosing and using propane as a calibration standard for estimating total flammable {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) in an air matrix. A propane-in-nitrogen standard was selected based {{on a number of}} criteria: (1) has an analytical response similar to the VOCs of interest, (2) can be made with known accuracy and traceability, (3) is available with good purity, (4) has a matrix similar to the sample matrix, (5) is stable during storage and use, (6) is relatively non-hazardous, and (7) is a recognized standard for similar analytical applications. The Waste Retrieval Project (WRP) desires a fast, reliable, and inexpensive method for screening the flammable <b>VOC</b> <b>content</b> in the vapor-phase headspace of waste containers. Table 1 lists the flammable VOCs of interest to the WRP. The current method used to determine the <b>VOC</b> <b>content</b> of a container is to sample the container's headspace and submit the sample for gas chromatography [...] mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. The driver for the VOC measurement requirement is safety: potentially flammable atmospheres in the waste containers must be allowed to diffuse prior to processing the container. The proposed flammable VOC screening method is to inject an aliquot of the headspace sample into an argon-doped pulsed-discharge helium ionization detector (Ar-PDHID) contained within a gas chromatograph. No actual chromatography is performed; the sample is transferred directly from a sample loop to the detector through a short, inert transfer line. The peak area resulting from the injected sample is proportional to the flammable <b>VOC</b> <b>content</b> of the sample. However, because the Ar-PDHID has different response factors for different flammable VOCs, a fundamental assumption must be made that the agent used to calibrate the detector is representative of the flammable VOCs of interest that may be in the headspace samples. At worst, we desire that calibration with the selected calibrating agent overestimate the value of the VOCs in a sample. By overestimating the <b>VOC</b> <b>content</b> of a sample, we want to minimize false negatives. A false negative is defined as incorrectly estimating the <b>VOC</b> <b>content</b> of the sample to be below programmatic action limits when, in fact, the sample,exceeds the action limits. The disadvantage of overestimating the flammable <b>VOC</b> <b>content</b> of a sample is that additional cost may be incurred because additional sampling and GC-MS analysis may be required to confirm results over programmatic action limits. Therefore, choosing an appropriate calibration standard for the Ar-PDHID is critical to avoid false negatives and to minimize additional analytical costs...|$|E

According to UNI 11021 : 2002 a small-scale chamber was used to expose 1) wines to low and high VOCs drying coatings and 2) corks to the same coatings. Then the corks after exposition to coatings were placed {{in direct contact with}} wines. Different styles of white, red and rosé wines were tested. In both directly exposed wines and in wines after contact with the exposed cork, taste and smell off-flavour perception and intensity were assessed by a panel of 8 experienced wine tasters using a 5 point numerical scale according to ISO standard methods. The results show that the sensory characters of wines, especially taste, are influenced by coating <b>VOCs</b> <b>contents.</b> In fact the taste off-flavour perception is higher than smell in wines exposed to either high or low <b>VOCs</b> <b>contents.</b> ANOVA and Duncan analysis prove that: a) panellist's answers are significantly different, b) it is difficult to differentiate the off-flavour perception on the scale high levels c) the panellist off-flavour perceptions versus wine style discriminate the wines into two groups (red and white/rosè). For all the wine styles, the Pearson's test shows no-significative correlation between the level of off-flavour perception and the main chemical characters of the wines.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Biofiltration is a {{suitable}} odor reduction technique {{for the treatment}} of gaseous emissions from composting processes, but {{little is known about the}} start-up of full-scale biofilters after material replacement and their performance after several years of operation. - RESULTS: Biofilter material (wood chips used previously as bulking agent in a composting process) can effectively remove ammonia and most of the volatile organic compounds (<b>VOCs)</b> <b>content,</b> achieving removal efficiencies greater than 70 % for VOCs and near 90 % for ammonia immediately after material replacement. These removal efficiencies were maintained for several months after material replacement. In the studied full-scale biofilter no lag phase was observed in the removal of ammonia whereas in the case of VOCs different patterns were detected during biofilter start-up. For the old biofilter material, after 4 years of operation, a statistically significant decrease of removal efficiency for ammonia in comparison with the new material was detected. No statistically significant differences were found in the case of VOCs. - CONCLUSIONS: Data on the emissions of several pollutants from biofilters treating composting exhaust gases have been systematically obtained.

30|$|The {{platinum}} catalyst {{can also}} be used as an assessment tool to determine if the majority of VOCs produced are being detected, accurately identified and accurately quantified by the PTR-MS. A difference in the total <b>VOC</b> <b>content</b> determined by the platinum catalyst and CO 2 detector from that provided by the PTR-MS can alert the user to check for issues such as the following: additional ions with significant carbon content may need to be quantified in the PTR-MS spectrum, some compounds (e.g. alkanes) are not being detected, sensitivity factors may be inaccurate, or identification of the VOC precursor responsible for part or all of an ion’s intensity may be incorrect. Ideally, all but one of these issues would be ruled out using prior system knowledge before using this assessment tool to identify discrepancies in PTR-MS VOC quantification. In this system, the PTR-MS total <b>VOC</b> <b>content</b> agreed on average to within 5.5  ±  4.7  % of that determined with the platinum catalyst and CO 2 detector, which is considered to be excellent agreement. This level of agreement suggests that the PTR-MS quantification is providing an accurate measurement of VOC composition and that there are no significant errors in the calibration of the four major products, especially the detailed calibration of the major product, ethanol. The system described here is rapid and efficient at measuring the composition of VOCs with high confidence compared to other available measurement methods.|$|E

40|$|Combustion Science & Engineering, Inc. (CSE) {{performed}} {{an analysis of}} the selfinitiated thermal decomposition phenomenon of paint-loaded filters that has occurred on several occasions as reported by the Iowa Waste Reduction Center. By conducting a series of self-heating tests on samples of filters loaded with paint, CSE has shown that in selected circumstances the exothermic decomposition of the paint-loaded filters could lead to thermal runaway and eventually ignition of the filters. These circumstances are related to the temperature, size, and composition of materials surrounding the filters. The exothermic decomposition of the paint releases energy. If the energy generated within the pile is greater than the energy lost from the pile, the internal temperature will increase. The non-linear nature of the chemical reactions promotes an exponential rise in the temperature, eventually reaching the ignition temperature of the paint and/or filters. At a certain critical pile size the configuration does not allow effective dissipation of the energy produced by the reaction for a given temperature. CSE’s test data were used to determine the Frank-Kamenetskii parameter for self-heating and the results indicate that the packing density is the single most critical factor. Furthermore, filters loaded with paint with a higher <b>VOC</b> <b>content</b> are more prone to selfheat than filters with a lower <b>VOC</b> <b>content.</b> To correct the self-heating problem, the geometry of the storage of the filters must be changed to allow for less temperature build-up and better heat dissipation. This can be effectively accomplished by reducing the volume of the storage containers and by reducing the packing density (number of filters per volume unit). In addition, filters should never be mixed with ordinary trash, as trash surrounding the filters will cause the same insulating effect as tightly packed filters. ...|$|E
