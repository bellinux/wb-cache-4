30|$|In {{the current}} text being {{negotiated}} for the post- 2015 framework for DRR, education <b>and</b> <b>awareness-raising</b> have been correctly identified as top priorities in public policy. The {{problem is that}} such educational efforts focus on understanding the natural phenomena involved or the actions to be undertaken in preparedness for an emergency response. Very little, and sometimes almost nothing, is done to address the vulnerabilities that put a specific community, family, or individual at risk to these natural hazards. What is it {{that needs to be}} changed in people’s behavior to make them stronger to resist or be resilient to these hazards? This question should be the focus of educational <b>and</b> <b>awareness-raising</b> efforts by governments and civil society organizations. In such a consciousness process, understanding the hazards and preparing to respond are key elements. Good data, information, and knowledge about natural hazards are essential. But {{it is one thing to}} include those components and another to focus only on them. This is one of the key challenges that must be addressed at Sendai.|$|R
