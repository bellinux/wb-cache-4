Additionally, Fig.  3 illustrates that P_e^* will be at the highest level in the cooperative model and at the lowest level in the Stackelberg model. This means end-users’ welfare in Stackelberg scenario can be more than other scenarios. As can be observed in Table  1 : π_R^* has the lowest <b>value</b> <b>in</b> the Nash game model and the highest <b>value</b> <b>in</b> the cooperative model, while π_T^* is minimum in the cooperative model and maximum in the Nash model. q_R^* shows the lowest <b>value</b> <b>in</b> the Nash model and the highest <b>value</b> <b>in</b> the Stackelberg model, while q_T^* has the lowest <b>value</b> <b>in</b> the cooperative model and the highest <b>value</b> <b>in</b> the Nash model.

5|$|General vector spaces do {{not possess}} a {{multiplication}} between vectors. A vector space equipped with an additional bilinear operator defining the multiplication of two vectors is an algebra over a field.

The Stone–Weierstrass theorem mentioned above, for example, relies on Banach algebras which are both Banach spaces and algebras.|$|E
