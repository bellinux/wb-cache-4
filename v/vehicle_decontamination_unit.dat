40|$|Abstract Background The {{cleaning}} {{stage of the}} instrument decontamination process has come under increased scrutiny due to the increasing complexity of surgical instruments and the adverse affects of residual protein contamination on surgical instruments. Instruments used in the podiatry field have a complex surface topography and are exposed {{to a wide range}} of biological contamination. Currently, podiatry instruments are reprocessed locally within surgeries while national strategies are favouring a move toward reprocessing in central facilities. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of local and central reprocessing on podiatry instruments by measuring residual protein contamination of instruments reprocessed by both methods. Methods The residual protein of 189 instruments reprocessed centrally and 189 instruments reprocessed locally was determined using a fluorescent assay based on the reaction of proteins with o-phthaldialdehyde/sodium 2 -mercaptoethanesulfonate. Results Residual protein was detected on 72 % (n = 136) of instruments reprocessed centrally and 90 % (n = 170) of instruments reprocessed locally. Significantly less protein (p Conclusions Overall, the results show the superiority of central reprocessing for complex podiatry instruments when protein contamination is considered, though no significant difference was found in residual protein between local <b>decontamination</b> <b>unit</b> and central <b>decontamination</b> <b>unit</b> processes for Blacks files. Further research is needed to undertake qualitative identification of protein contamination to identify any cross contamination risks and a standard for acceptable residual protein contamination applicable to different instruments and specialities should be considered as a matter of urgency. </p...|$|R

40|$|This Corrective Action Investigation Plan {{contains}} the U. S. Department of Energy, Nevada Operations Office's approach {{to collect the}} data necessary to evaluate corrective action alternatives appropriate for the closure of Corrective Action Unit 252 under the Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order. Corrective Action Unit 252 consists of Corrective Action Site (CAS) 25 - 07 - 02, Engine Test Stand- 1 (ETS- 1) Decontamination Pad. Located in Area 25 {{at the intersection of}} Road H and Road K at the Nevada Test Site, ETS- 1 was designed for use as a mobile radiation checkpoint and for <b>vehicle</b> <b>decontamination.</b> The CAS consists of a concrete decontamination pad with a drain, a gravel-filled sump, two concrete trailer pads, and utility boxes. Constructed in 1966, the ETS- 1 facility was part of the Nuclear Rocket Development Station (NRDS) complex and used to test nuclear rockets. The ETS- 1 Decontamination Pad and mobile radiation check point was built in 1968. The NRDS complex ceased primary operations in 1973. Based on site history, the focus of the field investigation activities will be to determine if any primary contaminants of potential concern (COPCs) (including radionuclides, total volatile organic compounds, total semivolatile organic compounds, total petroleum hydrocarbons as diesel-range organics, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act metals, total pesticides, and polychlorinated biphenyls) are present at this site. Vertical extent of migration of suspected <b>vehicle</b> <b>decontamination</b> effluent COPCs is expected to be less than 12 feet below ground surface. Lateral extent of migration of COPCs is expected to be limited to the sump area or near the northeast corner of the decontamination pad. Using a biased sampling approach, near-surface and subsurface sampling will be conducted at the suspected worst-case areas including the sump and soil near the northeast corner of the decontamination pad. The results of this field investigation will support a defensible e valuation of corrective action alternatives in the corrective action decision document...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{reason for}} the {{underwater}} tests was to detect the radiation contamination of the ships after an underwater nuclear explosion. This meant that the contaminated ships required unique [...] "radsafe" [...] preparations so that the data could be quickly accounted for. After the data on the damage and radiation was recorded, the ships needed decontamination work completed before repairs could be completed. The Radiological and <b>Decontamination</b> <b>Unit</b> consisting of 200 enlisted and one officer was created for task of decontamination. After decontamination, the target ships were repaired {{for use in a}} second underwater nuclear weapons test. The amount of radiation exposure was debated {{for the safety of the}} crews. Roentgens (R) were used to gage the gamma radiation that affected the units working on the nuclear tests. For the underwater test crew, a limit of 5 R per blast along with 10 R per operation was referenced as the limit for exposure. These initial limits were rejected and maximum permissible exposure standards (MPE) were solidified by commanders for the crews working on the <b>decontamination</b> <b>unit.</b> Due to the fast recovery of ships, high contamination values were expected by commanders and set the standard to four roentgens per hour (R/hr). An excess of 4 R/hr was designated off limits of recovery units. Personnel were given special breathing equipment to work in the interior of ships with an R/hr higher than one. High numbers of personnel working the tests were used to keep individuals within the MPE. Times were calculated to keep the total exposure below two roentgens for the personnel working on the ships. A floating decontamination facility was created on board a transport ship for the Wahoo and Umbrella nuclear tests. This allowed important data analysis and an increase in recovery efficiency.|$|R

40|$|The {{command module}} {{reaction}} control system is emptied of all remaining propellant using {{ground support equipment}} designed to provide an acid/base neutralization of the propellant in both the liquid and gaseous phases so {{that it may be}} disposed of safely. During the deactivation operation of the oxidizer from the Apollo 16 command module on 7 May 1972, the scrubber tank of the <b>decontamination</b> <b>unit</b> exploded, destroying the ground support equipment unit and damaging the building that housed the operation. Only minor injuries were received by the personnel in the area and the command module was not damaged. Test results show that the failure was caused by an insufficient quantity of neutralizer for the quantity of oxidizer. This insufficiency lead to exothermic nitration-type reactions which produced large quantities of gas at a very high rate and failed the decontamination tank...|$|R
40|$|Earth-moving {{vehicles}} (e. g., dump trucks, belly dumps) commonly haul radiologically contaminated {{materials from}} a site being remediated to a disposal site. Traditionally, each vehicle must be surveyed before being released. The logistical difficulties of implementing {{the traditional approach}} {{on a large scale}} demand that an alternative be devised. A statistical method for assessing product quality from a continuous process was adapted to the <b>vehicle</b> <b>decontamination</b> process. This method produced a sampling scheme that automatically compensates and accommodates fluctuating batch sizes and changing conditions without the need to modify or rectify the sampling scheme in the field. Vehicles are randomly selected (sampled) upon completion of the decontamination process to be surveyed for residual radioactive surface contamination. The frequency of sampling is based on the expected number of vehicles passing through the decontamination process in a given period and the confidence level desired. This process has been successfully used for 1 year at the former uranium millsite in Monticello, Utah (a cleanup site regulated under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act). The method forces improvement in the quality of the decontamination process and results in a lower likelihood that vehicles exceeding the surface contamination standards are offered for survey. Implementation of this statistical sampling method on Monticello projects has resulted in more efficient processing of <b>vehicles</b> through <b>decontamination</b> and radiological release, saved hundreds of hours of processing time, provided a high level of confidence that release limits are met, and improved the radiological cleanliness of vehicles leaving the controlled site...|$|R
