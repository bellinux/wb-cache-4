5|$|In September 2015, in {{the context}} of the European migrant crisis, Labour Party {{leadership}} candidate Yvette Cooper called for an increase in the number of refugees resettled in the UK to 10,000. The prime minister, David Cameron, subsequently announced that the UK would resettle 20,000 refugees from camps in countries bordering Syria over the period to 2020 under the <b>Vulnerable</b> <b>Persons</b> Relocation Scheme, which was established in early 2014 and is distinct from, but modelled on, the Gateway Protection Programme.|$|E
5|$|On 17 November, Major General Andrija Rašeta, the {{commander}} of the JNA 5th (Zagreb) Military District, notified the European Community Monitor Mission (ECMM) that the JNA accepted in principle the quick evacuation of <b>vulnerable</b> <b>persons</b> from Vukovar. At the time, it was estimated that there were about 400 people trapped in the city's hospital, but the actual number was later discovered to be about 450. This included about 40 patients receiving treatment for severe injuries sustained over the preceding few days and about 360 patients recovering from wounds suffered earlier on. In addition to these individuals, some civilians had taken shelter in the hospital {{in the final days of}} the battle. They moved there expecting to be evacuated from the city, even though the hospital itself was subjected to daily artillery attack. Furthermore, a number of Croatian troops took refuge in the hospital posing as patients or staff.|$|E
