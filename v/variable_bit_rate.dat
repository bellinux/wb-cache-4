However, video on an XVCD is typically encoded at a <b>variable</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> (VBR), so complex scenes can use a much higher data rate for a short time, while simpler scenes will use lower data rates. Some XVCDs use lower bitrates in order to fit longer videos onto the disc, while others use higher bitrates to improve quality. MPEG-2 may be used instead of MPEG-1.|$|E

25|$|MPEG-2 doubles {{the number}} of {{sampling}} rates which are supported and MPEG-2.5 adds 3 more. When this was written, the suggested implementations were quite dated. Implementers of the standard were supposed to devise their own algorithms suitable for removing parts of {{the information from the}} audio input. As a result, many different MP3 encoders became available, each producing files of differing quality. Comparisons were widely available, so it was easy for a prospective user of an encoder to research the best choice. Some encoders that were proficient at encoding at higher bit rates (such as LAME) were not necessarily as good at lower bit rates. Over time, LAME evolved on the SourceForge website until it became the de facto CBR MP3 encoder. Later an ABR mode was added. Work progressed on true <b>variable</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> using a quality goal between 0 and 10. Eventually numbers (such as -V 9.600) could generate excellent quality low bit rate voice encoding at only 41kbit/s using the MPEG-2.5 extensions.|$|E

This is easily accomplished using LAME version 3.99.5 and the command line [...] "lame -V 9.6 lecture.WAV" [...] English speakers average 41–42kbit/s with -V 9.6 setting but this may vary with amount of silence recorded or the rate of delivery (wpm).

2500|$|Karlheinz Brandenburg used a CD {{recording}} of Suzanne Vega's song [...] "Tom's Diner" [...] {{to assess and}} refine the MP3 compression algorithm. This song was chosen because of its nearly monophonic nature and wide spectral content, {{making it easier to}} hear imperfections in the compression format during playbacks. Some refer to Suzanne Vega as [...] "The mother of MP3". This particular track has an interesting property in that the two channels are almost, but not completely, the same, leading to a case where Binaural Masking Level Depression causes spatial unmasking of noise artifacts unless the encoder properly recognizes the situation and applies corrections similar to those detailed in the MPEG-2 AAC psychoacoustic model. Some more critical audio excerpts (glockenspiel, triangle, accordion, etc.) were taken from the EBU V3/SQAM reference compact disc and have been used by professional sound engineers to assess the subjective quality of the MPEG Audio formats. LAME is the most advanced MP3 encoder. LAME includes a VBR <b>variable</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> encoding which uses a quality parameter rather than a bit rate goal. Later versions 2008+) support an n.nnn quality goal which automatically selects MPEG-2 or MPEG-2.5 sampling rates as appropriate for human speech recordings which need only 5512Hz bandwidth resolution.|$|E

2500|$|This {{observation}} {{caused a}} revolution in audio encoding. Early on bitrate was the prime and only consideration. At the time MP3 files were of the very simplest type: they used the same bit rate for the entire file: this process is known as Constant Bit Rate (CBR) encoding. Using a constant bit rate makes encoding simpler and less CPU intensive. However, {{it is also possible}} to create files where the bit rate changes throughout the file. These are known as <b>Variable</b> <b>Bit</b> <b>Rate</b> The bit reservoir and VBR encoding were actually part of the original MPEG-1 standard. The concept behind them is that, in any piece of audio, some sections are easier to compress, such as silence or music containing only a few tones, while others will be more difficult to compress. So, the overall quality of the file may be increased by using a lower bit rate for the less complex passages and a higher one for the more complex parts. With some advanced MP3 encoders, it is possible to specify a given quality, and the encoder will adjust the bit rate accordingly. Users that desire a particular [...] "quality setting" [...] that is transparent to their ears can use this value when encoding all of their music, and generally speaking not need to worry about performing personal listening tests on each piece of music to determine the correct bit rate.|$|E

40|$|The future {{wireless}} communications systems {{should be able}} to offer wide variety of applications, which have vastly different quality of service (QoS) requirements. The time-variable QoS may require the support of <b>variable</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rates</b> on the wireless links to the individual users. Multi-rate DS/CDMA is a promising basis on which to support the <b>variable</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rates</b> on the individual wireless links. Currently, the study on channel estimation and multiuser detection for multi-rate DS/CDMA, which makes full use of the nature of multi-rate signals, is still at its early stage. The thesis deals with the application of subspace-based techniques to blind channel estimation and multiuser detection for multi-rate DS/CDMA, including single-carrier and multicarrier scenarios. For the single-carrier case, space-time blind linear multiuser detection is investigated for synchronous dual-rate systems over the AWGN channel. The performance is evaluated analytically. The multi-rate generalization and the asynchronous extension are discussed. Two-stage space-time dual-rate blind detectors are also presented. Furthermore, blind adaptive channel estimation and detection schemes for asynchronous dual-rate systems over frequency-selective multipath channels are developed. In the context of multicarrier DS/CDMA, based on a finite-length truncation approximation on the band-limited chip waveform, blind timing acquisition and channel estimation scheme is proposed for multi-rate systems. The channel estimation error due to the finite-length chip waveform truncation is analyzed by exploiting a first-order perturbation approximation...|$|R

Although this enables the coexistence of applications with unequal <b>bit</b> <b>rates,</b> heterogeneous QoS requirements are still not well supported. Moreover, the MAOPF allocates all OFDM subcarriers to the same mobile. This does not fully take advantage of the multiuser diversity and has a negative impact on the system capacity.|$|R
