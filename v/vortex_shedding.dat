5|$|Dragonflies {{generate}} lift in {{at least}} four ways at different times, including classical lift like an aircraft wing; supercritical lift with the wing above the critical angle, generating high lift and using very short strokes to avoid stalling; creating vortices; and <b>vortex</b> <b>shedding.</b> Some families appear to use special mechanisms, as for example the Libellulidae which take off rapidly, their wings beginning pointed far forward and twisted almost vertically. Dragonfly wings behave highly dynamically during flight, flexing and twisting during each beat. Among the variables are wing curvature, length and speed of stroke, angle of attack, forward/back position of wing, and phase relative to the other wings.|$|E
25|$|A monopole-like {{sound field}} is {{generated}} by volumetric flow rate oscillations. Karthik and Anderson have studied this phenomenon and concluded that symmetric <b>vortex</b> <b>shedding</b> on the cavity side is the driving agency.|$|E

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of <b>vortex</b> structures <b>shed</b> from {{a heated}} cylinder is experimentally investigated {{by means of}} 2 -D particle tracking velocimetry. Within this investigation the ReD number was chosen to be 73. The RiD number, the dimensionless number which presents {{the relative importance of}} the induced heat, varies between 0 and 1. The experiments were carried out in a large towing tank where the disturbances caused by boundary layers could be minimised. The results show that for small RiD numbers the induced heat results in a deflection of the vortex street in negative y-direction. Within the vortex street a linking of two subsequently shed vortices occurs where the <b>vortex</b> <b>shed</b> from {{the lower half of the}} cylinder rotates around the <b>vortex</b> <b>shed</b> from the upper half. These phe-nomena are assumed to be caused by a strength dierence between the vortices shed from the upper half of the cylinder and the lower half. For RiD 1 the eect of the induced heat and buoyancy becomes even more pronounced resulting in a more upward...|$|R

25|$|At higher speeds on powered aircraft, the {{boundary}} layer on the airfoil is turbulent {{and more complex}} <b>vortex</b> <b>shedding</b> patterns have been observed. Since {{it is difficult to}} measure in flight, Hayden made static tests.|$|E
25|$|The {{steady flow}} over a {{cylinder}} (or similar object) will generate <b>vortex</b> <b>shedding</b> and consequent sound. The early Greeks used this phenomenon {{to develop a}} harp and the sound was called an Aeolian tone after Aeolus, God of the Wind.|$|E
25|$|The first {{number is}} {{the ratio of}} {{unsteady}} inertial forces to steady inertial forces. The number was {{named in honor of}} Vincenz Strouhal who first deduced the relationship between the <b>vortex</b> <b>shedding</b> frequency around a cylinder and the flow speed. The characteristic variables were the cylinder diameter L1, and the speed of the flow over it U. He found the number to be reasonably constant over given a Reynolds number range.|$|E

25|$|Manipulation of the {{equation}} yields the lower two equations for the dipole sound power of both lift and drag. Each time a <b>vortex</b> is <b>shed,</b> the drag velocity fluctuation u has the same sign, but the lateral velocity fluctuation v, has opposite signs, since the <b>vortex</b> is <b>shed</b> on alternate sides. As a result, The drag dipole {{would be expected to}} be twice the frequency of the lift dipole.|$|R
25|$|Most {{suspension}} bridges have open truss {{structures to}} support the roadbed, particularly owing to the unfavorable effects of using plate girders, discovered from the Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940) bridge collapse. Recent developments in bridge aerodynamics have allowed the re-introduction of plate structures first seen on the Severn bridge built in the 1960s. In {{the picture of the}} Yichang Bridge, note the very sharp entry edge and sloping undergirders in the suspension bridge shown. This enables this type of construction to be used without the danger of <b>vortex</b> <b>shedding</b> and consequent aeroelastic effects, such as those that destroyed the original Tacoma Narrows bridge.|$|E
25|$|The {{method of}} {{creating}} swirl in the vortex whistle {{was considered the}} cause for lack of dynamic similarity, so the swirl was created in a pipe with a contraction having swirl blades followed by an expansion to create the required axial backflow. This was the vortex whistle in a pipe. Measurements made with this geometry, are shown in the figure on the right. As can be seen, dynamic similarity was achieved with both air and water. This whistle became a flow meter called the swirlmeter. Its accuracy rivals that of the <b>vortex</b> <b>shedding</b> meters described above but has a higher pressure drop. The feedback is hydrodynamic (Class I) and only one stage was found.|$|E
25|$|Another {{characteristic}} {{dimension is}} the airfoil chord. In these tests the jet width {{was sufficient to}} keep the <b>vortex</b> <b>shedding</b> coherent across it. On an airfoil {{there would be a}} correlation length less than the wingspan resulting in a number independent dipoles arrayed laterally. The sound power would be diminished somewhat. Since the dipole model is based on the time rate of change of the force, reduction of sound power might be accomplished by reducing that rate. One possible means would be for the opposite sides of the surface to gradually sense each other spatially prior to the trailing edge and thus reduce the rate at the edge. This might be done by a section of graduated porous or flexible materials.|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} using fins {{mounted on}} a wind tunnel wall has examined {{the proposition that the}} interaction between axially-separated aerodynamic control surfaces fundamentally results from an angle of attack superposed upon the downstream fin by the <b>vortex</b> <b>shed</b> from the upstream fin. Particle Image Velocimetry data captured on the surface of a single fin show the formation of the trailing vortex first as a leading-edge vortex, then becoming a tip vortex as it propagates to the fin’s spanwise edge. Data acquired on the downstream fin surface {{in the presence of a}} trailing <b>vortex</b> <b>shed</b> from an upstream fin may remove this impinging vortex by subtracting its mean velocity field as measured in single-fin experiments, after which the vortex forming on the downstream fin’s leeside becomes evident. The properties of the downstream fin’s lifting vortex appear to be determined by the total angle of attack imposed upon it, which is a combination of its physical fin cant and the angle of attack induced by the impinging vortex, and are consistent with those of a single fin at equivalent angle of attack...|$|R
40|$|Based on flow {{visualization}} {{experiment and}} particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurement, the <b>shedding</b> <b>vortex</b> of flapping wing model with single {{degree of freedom}} was studied experimentally and several conclusions were obtained as follow. (1) A horn-shape <b>shedding</b> <b>vortex</b> with a wingspan-direction movement is generated around the leading edge {{as well as the}} trailing edge during flapping. (2) The <b>shedding</b> <b>vortex</b> leads to alternative pressure differences with unequal scalar {{on both sides of the}} flapping wing. (3) Both attack angle and inflow speed are not zero, which are essential factors to the lift generation of study object. (4) The maximum circulation of the <b>shedding</b> <b>vortex</b> appears at about 3 / 5 of the upward flapping journey, as well as the downward flapping journey. (5) The circulation of the <b>shedding</b> <b>vortex</b> is proportional to the flapping speed. (6) The flapping wing generates more work during the downward flapping journey, as compared with the upward flapping journey, resulting in the generation of lift within a whole flapping cycle...|$|R
40|$|A {{model of}} a teetering rotor was tested in a low speed wind tunnel. Blade element airloads {{measured}} on an articulated model rotor were compared with the teetering rotor and showed that the teetering rotor is subjected to less extensive flow separation. Retreating blade stall was studied. Results show that stall, {{under the influence of}} unsteady aerodynamic effects, consists of four separate stall events, each associated with a <b>vortex</b> <b>shed</b> from the leading edge and sweeping over the upper surface of the rotor blade. Current rotor performance prediction methodology was evaluated through computer simulation...|$|R
25|$|At {{high speeds}} U, the flow is {{turbulent}} {{and in some}} studies the speed can be supersonic and the sound generated can be quite high level. One study has shown that several modes of oscillation (stages) can occur in a shallow cavity; the modes being related {{to the number of}} vortices in the distance L. For shorter cavities and lower Mach numbers, there is a shear-layer mode, while for longer cavities and higher Mach numbers there is a wake mode. The shear-layer mode is characterized well by the feedback process described by Rossiter. The wake mode is characterized instead by a large-scale <b>vortex</b> <b>shedding</b> with a Strouhal number independent of Mach number. There is an empirical equation for these data; it is called Rossiter’s formula.|$|E
2500|$|The cover art for Currents and its {{accompanying}} singles {{were created}} by Kentucky-based artist and musician Robert Beatty. Kevin Parker has said Currents designs {{are based on a}} diagram of <b>vortex</b> <b>shedding</b> he remembered while trying to visualise the album's themes. Beatty described how Parker's ideas for the album artwork [...] "were all based on turbulent flow, the way liquid or air flows around objects." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the release}} of the group's {{previous}} album, Lonerism (2012), Parker began work on Currents, [...] largely recording at his home studio in Fremantle. He engrossed himself with writing and recording, and in keeping with his reputation as a musical auteur, laboured over the details of each song, ultimately causing the release date to be delayed by two months. In contrast to the psychedelic rock sound of the project's prior work, Currents marks a shift to more dance-oriented music, with more emphasis placed on synthesisers than guitars. Parker was inspired to seek a change out of desire to hear Tame Impala's music played in dance clubs and a more communal setting. Thematically, the record is about the process of personal transformation, which many critics interpreted {{to be the result of}} a romantic break-up. The album's cover art depicting <b>vortex</b> <b>shedding</b> is a visualisation of these themes.|$|E
40|$|The {{main object}} {{of the present study}} is to {{investigate}} numerically the mechanism of aerodynamic damping of pitching oscillation in sedan-type vehicles. The transient numerical solver employed is based on the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) method. Whilst, the Arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) method was used to realize the vehicle motion during dynamic pitching and fluid flow coupled simulations. Validation of the numerical method was done by comparing the flow structures obtained from the LES to the corresponding flow structures observed in the wind tunnel measurements. Two vehicle models with basic sedan-type automobile shape were created to study the influences of upper body geometry on the aerodynamic pitching stability of sedan-type vehicle. In addition, the credibility of modeling of automotive aerodynamics by simple bluff body models was verified. For the sedan-type models investigated, the trailing vortices that shed from the A-pillar and C-pillar edges were found to produce the opposite tendencies on how they affect the aerodynamic pitching stability of the models. In particular, the <b>vortex</b> <b>shed</b> from the A-pillar edge tended to enhance the pitching oscillation, while the <b>vortex</b> <b>shed</b> from the C-pillar edge tended to suppress it. Hence, the vehicle with rounded A-pillar and angular C-pillar exhibited a higher aerodynamic damping than the vehicle with the opposite A- and C-pillars configurations. The aerodynamic damping mechanism has been proposed {{based on the results of}} flow visualization on the phase-averaged flow properties...|$|R

30|$|Previous {{investigations}} {{were focused}} on improving the compressor performance or controlling separations. The influence of aspiration on flow fields, especially vortex structures, has been rarely studied. In multi-stage compressors, the vortexes of the upstream blade rows, such as horseshoe vortex, passage <b>vortex,</b> and concentration <b>shedding</b> <b>vortex,</b> may significantly influence the flow field of downstream blade rows. Therefore, flow fields, especially vortexes, in the aspirated compressors must be elucidated.|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{experimental}} observation of <b>vortex</b> cluster <b>shedding</b> from a moving obstacle in an oblate atomic Bose-Einstein condensate. At low obstacle velocities v above a critical value, vortex clusters consisting of two like-sign vortices are generated to form a regular configuration like a von Kármán street, and as v is increased, the shedding pattern becomes irregular with {{many different kinds of}} vortex clusters. In particular, we observe that the Stouhal number associated with the shedding frequency exhibits saturation behavior with increasing v. The regular-to-turbulent transition of the <b>vortex</b> cluster <b>shedding</b> reveals remarkable similarities between a superfluid and a classical viscous fluid.

Phase-averaged velocity statistics of the discrete vortex were described by comparison with the Karman <b>vortex</b> <b>shed</b> from the cylinder. The near-wall shear layer separates {{in the region of}} adverse pressure gradient behind the rectangular cylinder and develops into the periodic formation of the discrete vortices which are eventually caught up by the Karman vortex and entrained into it. The vorticity of the discrete vortices is negative (clockwise rotating) and about the same order of magnitude as the Karman vortices. The coherent normal stresses of the Karman vortices are much larger than those of the discrete vortices, while the incoherent ones are not all that different with each other...|$|R

50|$|An {{approximate}} way {{to relate}} the sound generated to the flow characteristics is to perturb the standard drag equation with velocity perturbations {{as shown in the}} upper equation below.(lift measurements for cylinders are generally not available). The upper equation is the modified drag equation with both drag component u and lift component v and the cross sectional area dL where d is the cylinder diameter and w is the length. Manipulation of the equation yields the lower two equations for the dipole sound power of both lift and drag. Each time a <b>vortex</b> is <b>shed,</b> the drag velocity fluctuation u has the same sign, but the lateral velocity fluctuation v, has opposite signs, since the <b>vortex</b> is <b>shed</b> on alternate sides.
