25|$|Edward Kemp's {{plan was}} for a formal garden {{containing}} a conservatory and plant houses {{to the north of}} the house. Beyond these were a garden yard, a stable yard, a coach house and a farm yard. To the west of these was a substantial kitchen garden. The other outbuildings included a <b>vinery,</b> with a heated wall, and a smoke house for curing bacon and ham. Joseph Stubs was a collector of rare plants and many of these were planted in what he called the American Garden. In the days of the Wright family a head gardener and seven full-time gardeners were employed and also during this time more outbuildings were constructed beyond the coach house.|$|E

At the time it was thought to be the deepest well in the world, at nine hundred feet.

In the other, the gardener's lad flung a stone at a blackbird on the wall above the <b>vinery,</b> and Master Lance, who I fancy did not like the gardener's lad, flung one through the glass. Geoffrey, who was angry, but had not seen what I saw, haled the boy before him, and Lance looked him in the face and lied with the assurance of an ambassador.

He was helped in this by the discovery of a seam of lead on the estate which, when mined, brought in a useful income. He [...] "laid open the natural beauties of the place", improved the scenery, created walkways, vistas and dingles and built a sunken passageway under the turnpike road.
