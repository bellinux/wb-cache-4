30|$|The ViKY® System was docked {{into one}} of the lateral {{surgical}} table rails through a height/pivot adjustment mechanism. An Olympus 5 -mm LTF-VH deflectable tip video laparoscope (Olympus Surgical and Industrial America Inc, Center Valley, PA, USA) was then coupled with the system. A Bluetooth ear-piece was utilized to aurally control the platform’s 3 degrees of freedom (in/out, left/right, up/down) (Media File 1). Articulated Maryland graspers, curved scissors, and 5 -mm Ligasure blunt tip <b>vessel</b> <b>sealer</b> were then used for lymph node dissections and hysterectomies/oophorectomies. The iliac artery and vein were first identified, the retroperitoneal space entered and developed in a caudal–cranial fashion. The lymphatic tissue was removed using the Maryland grasper and 5 -mm Ligasure (Covidien, Mansfield, CT, USA).|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Many {{instruments}} {{are used for}} laparoscopic dissection, including monopolar electrosurgery scissors (MES), electrothermal bipolar <b>vessel</b> <b>sealers</b> (BVS) and ultrasonically coagulating shears (UCS). These three devices were compared with regard to dissection time, blood loss, safety and costs. METHODS: Sixty-one consecutive patients undergoing laparoscopic left-sided colectomy were randomized to MES, BVS or UCS. The primary endpoint was dissection time. RESULTS: Patient and operation characteristics did not differ between the groups. Median dissection time was significantly shorter with BVS (105 min) and UCS (90 min) than with MES (137 min) (P < 0. 001). With BVS and UCS, significantly fewer additional clips were required (MES 9 versus BVS 0 versus UCS 3; P < 0. 001) {{and there was a}} trend towards lower blood loss (125 versus 50 versus 50 ml respectively; P = 0. 223) and a reduced volume of suction fluid (425 versus 80 versus 110 ml; P = 0. 058). Overall satisfaction was similar for the three instruments. Dissection with BVS and UCS was significantly cheaper than with MES, assuming a centre volume of 200 cases per year (P = 0. 009). CONCLUSION: BVS and UCS shorten dissection time in laparoscopic left-sided colectomy and are cost-effective compared with MES...|$|R
30|$|Vessel sealing {{technology}} {{is a type of}} bipolar electrosurgery developed to coagulate blood vessels from a diameter of 2 – 3  mm and with minimized collateral tissue damage. An electrothermal bipolar <b>vessel</b> <b>sealer</b> (EBVS) combines an advanced electrical current with mechanical pressure, in order to fuse the vessel walls and create a seal. The EBVS allows the secure sealing of vessels with a diameter of up to 7  mm [38, 39]. The seals obtained with EBVS have proven to be stronger compared to those obtained with traditional bipolar and ultrasonic technology [40, 41]. The available instruments have a diameter of either 5 or 10  mm [40]. EBVS rely on a computer-controlled tissue feedback system that senses tissue impedance or resistance and adjusts the current and output voltage: a consistent electrosurgical effect is obtained through all tissue types.|$|E
40|$|Various {{sources of}} {{ultrasonic}} and thermal energy {{have been developed}} to facilitate blood vessel ligation. However, their ef-ficacy in sealing lymphatics has not been clearly established to date. We hypothesized that the electrosurgical bipolar <b>vessel</b> <b>sealer</b> (EBVS) produces reliable and durable sealing of large lymphatic vessels in a porcine model. Thoracic ducts from 4 adult pigs were explanted and sealed at multiple levels by using 3 different EBVS devices: LigaSure Atlas, XTD, and V. Fifteen seals (5 per group) were analyzed for sealing time and visual quality. Seal burst strength was measured by using a graduated pressure saline injection system. Twelve intact seals also underwent a histologic analysis. The mean overall burst strength of the seals was 271 ± 78 mm Hg (127 to 360 mm Hg). The burst pressures in the 3 groups were not statisti-cally different. The overall mean time to achieve a seal was 5. ...|$|E
40|$|Laparoscopic {{surgery is}} rapidly {{expanding}} among urologists as a {{minimally invasive treatment}} with surgical procedures becoming increasingly challenging. Accurate haemostatis is of utmost importance in laparoscopy, as bleeding can rapidly impair the working environment conditions. We subsequently reviewed the different haemostatic tools used in laparoscopy with the focus on ultrasonic dissectors and electrothermal bipolar <b>vessel</b> <b>sealer</b> (EBVS). Briefly, {{there is a wide}} variety of haemostatic tools currently available in laparoscopy, all with their inherent advantages and limitations. The comparison of ultrasonic dissectors and EBVS shows that both systems are very attractive with similar physical properties concerning thermal spread and bursting pressure of vessels sealed. It has to be noted, however, that EBVS can handle vessels of up to 7 mm. In conclusion, haemostatic tools constitute a rapidly evolving domain with devices being developed which cause less thermal spread, while being more precise and faster. This evolution should finally allow more complex laparoscopic surgical procedures. Journal ArticleReviewinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
50|$|Quest, a low-powered, schooner-rigged {{steamship}} that sailed from 1917 until {{sinking in}} 1962, {{is best known}} as the polar exploration vessel of the Shackleton-Rowett Expedition of 1921-1922.

Prior to and after the Shackleton-Rowett Expedition, Quest operated in commercial service as a seal-hunting <b>vessel</b> or <b>sealer.</b> Quest was also the primary expedition vessel of the British Arctic Air Route Expedition to the east coast of the island of Greenland in 1930-1931.|$|R
40|$|Background: Blood loss during {{resection}} of the hepatic parenchyma in hepatectomy can {{be minimized}} using vessel-sealing (VS) devices. Some sealing devices were retrospectively compared {{to evaluate the}} efficacy of each device for controlling blood loss, transection time and postoperative complications in hepatectomy as a cohort study. Methods: Between 2005 and September 2012, hepatectomy was underwent in 150 patients using one of three types of LigaSure™ (Dolphin Tip Laparoscopic Instrument, Precise or Small Jaw) or the Harmonic Focus or Ace ultrasonic dissecting sealer. Results were compared to crush-clamping alone as the control method by the historical study (n= 81). Results: Irrespective of the vessel-sealing device used for underlying chronic hepatitis, blood loss, blood transfusion rate, operating time and transection time were significantly reduced in the VS group compared with controls (p< 0. 05). Rates of postoperative bile leakage and intra-abdominal abscess formation were significantly lower in the VS group than in controls (p< 0. 05). Comparing devices, LigaSure Small Jaw and Harmonic Focus showed lower blood loss, shorter transection time and reduced rates of post-hepatectomy complications, in turn resulting in shorter hospital stays (p< 0. 05). Tendencies toward uncontrolled ascites and bile leakage were only concern {{with the use of}} Harmonic Focus. Satisfactory surgical results were achieved using the sealing device for laparoscopic hepatectomy. Conclusions: The use of energy sealing devices improves surgical results and avoids hepatectomy-related complications. Adequate use of <b>vessel</b> <b>sealers</b> is necessary for safe and rapid completion of hepatic resection...|$|R
25|$|The seal hunt {{provided}} critical winter {{wages for}} fishermen, but was dangerous work marked by sealing disasters that claimed hundreds of lives, {{such as the}} 1914 Newfoundland Sealing Disaster involving the SS Southern Cross, the SS Newfoundland, and SS Stephano. The rugged hulls and experienced crews of Newfoundland sealing <b>vessels</b> often led <b>sealers</b> such as Bear and Terra Nova to be hired for arctic exploration and one sealer Algerine was hired to recover Titanic bodies in 1912. After World War II, the Newfoundland hunt was dominated by large Norwegian sealing vessels until the late 20th century, when the much diminished hunt shifted to smaller motor fishing vessels, based from outports around Newfoundland and Labrador. In 2007, the commercial seal hunt dividend contributed about $6 million to the Newfoundland GDP, {{a fraction of the}} industry's former importance.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{dissection}} of splenic hilar {{lymph nodes}} in gastric cancer surgery is indispensable for treating gastric cancers {{located in the}} proximal third of the stomach. Splenic vascular injury {{is a matter of}} debate resulting on time or delayed splenectomy. We aimed to share our experience and plausible mechanisms causing this complication in two case reports. Case presentations: Two male patients with gastric cancer were diagnosed with acute splenic infarction following gastric surgery in the early postoperative period. Both underwent emergent exploratory laparotomy. Splenectomy was performed due to splenic infarction. Discussion: Because we observed this rare complication in recent patients whose surgery was performed using vessel-sealing device for splenic hilar dissection, we suggested that extensive mobilization of the surrounding tissues of splenic vascular structures hilum using the <b>vessel</b> <b>sealer</b> could be the reason. Conclusion: In case of acute abdominal pain radiating to left shoulder, splenic complications should be taken into consideration in gastric cancer patients performed radical gastrectomy. Meticulous dissection of splenic hilar lymph nodes should be carried out to avoid any splenic vascular injury...|$|E
50|$|The Bering Sea Arbitration of 1893 arose {{out of a}} fishery {{dispute between}} the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the United States in the 1880s. The United States Revenue Cutter Service, today known as the United States Coast Guard, {{captured}} several Canadian <b>sealer</b> <b>vessels</b> throughout the conflict. Diplomatic representations followed the capture {{of the first three}} ships and an order for release was issued by the British imperial government (then still in charge of foreign affairs for the Dominion of Canada), but it did nothing to stop the seizures and none were released. This led to the U.S. claiming exclusive jurisdiction over the sealing industry in the Bering Sea, and that led to negotiations outside of the courts. The award was given in favor of the British, however, and the Americans were denied exclusive jurisdiction. The British were awarded compensation for the damage that had been inflicted on their vessels, and the American sealing zone remained as it was prior to the conflict (60 miles).|$|R
6000|$|At length {{he reached}} {{the point in the}} {{narrative}} where the amiable wanderers fell in with the sealers, on that unknown island to which chance and an adverse fortune had unhappily led them, in their pilgrimage. I had taken measures secretly to instruct Mr. Poke and the rest of my companions, as to {{the manner in which it}} became us to demean ourselves, while the Doctor was acquainting the academy with that first outrage committed by human cupidity, or the seizure of himself and friends. We were to rise, in a body, and, turning our faces a little on one side, veil our eyes in sign of shame. Less than this, it struck me, could scarcely be done, without manifesting an improper indifference to monikin rights; and more than this, might have been identifying ourselves with the particular individuals of the species who had perpetrated the wrong. But there was no occasion to exhibit this delicate attention to our learned hosts. The Doctor, with a refinement of feeling that did credit, indeed, to monikin civilization, gave an ingenious turn to the whole affair, which at once removed all cause of shame from our species; and which, if it left reason for any to blush, by a noble act of disinterestedness, threw the entire onus of the obligation on himself. Instead of dwelling on the ruthless manner in which he and his friends had been seized, the worthy Doctor very tranquilly informed his listeners, that, finding himself, by hazard, brought in contact with another species, and that the means of pushing important discoveries were unexpectedly placed in his power; conscious it had long been a desideratum with the savans to obtain a nearer view and more correct notions of human society; believing he had a discretion in the matter of his wards, and knowing that the inhabitants of Leaplow, a republic which all disliked, were seriously talking of sending out an expedition for this very purpose, he had promptly decided to profit by events, to push inquiry to the extent of his abilities, and to hazard all in the cause of learning and truth, by at once engaging the <b>vessel</b> of the <b>sealers,</b> and sailing, without dread of consequences, forthwith into the very bosom of the world of man! ...|$|R
