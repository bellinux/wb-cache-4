40|$|Understanding {{the effects}} of {{acoustic}} vibration on micro thermal bubble dynamics in a microchannel {{is the key to}} develop acoustic-thermal-bubble based microfluidic devices. For that purpose, in the current research, a series of experiments were carried out to study the acoustic-thermal-bubble dynamics in a microchannel. The thermal bubble was generated by a micro heater which was fabricated by MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical-System) technique. Using a high-speed digital camera, the thermal bubble dynamics was studied in two different conditions: normal condition and acoustic condition. Through theoretical analysis, the whole bubble dynamic process in two conditions can be roughly divided into four steps, which are bubble nucleation, satellite bubbles movement, bubble evolution, and bubble shrinkage and remove. The effects of acoustic vibration on all these four steps were found to be significant. The mechanisms behind these effects are discussed by analyzing the high speed <b>video</b> <b>recording</b> results. The <b>current</b> experimental investigation has some potential applications in microfluidic devices, and a prototype of micro mixer based on acoustic-thermal-bubble was successfully tested.

40|$|<b>Video</b> <b>recording</b> is {{increasingly}} becoming a favourable medium in archaeological research, particularly as an unconventional documentation tool that captures the elusive processes of ongoing interpretation in an audiovisual format. Our research forms {{part of the}} Personal Architectonics Through INteraction with Artefacts (PATINA) project, a project focused {{on the design of}} technologies for supporting research. Archaeological fieldwork is one of the research environments being studied by the project, and one of our primary concerns was to observe and <b>record</b> <b>current</b> research practices in the wild and to examine the influence of new technologies on those practices. This research brings together well-established and advanced observation techniques used in social sciences and computing fields such as human–computer interaction with archaeological research and presents the deployment of an off-the-shelf wearable camcorder as a recording interface in archaeological fieldwork. The article discusses the user evaluation methodology and the results, while addressing long-standing and timely theoretical discussions on the role of <b>video</b> <b>recording</b> in archaeological research...|$|R
40|$|<b>Video</b> <b>recording</b> is underused in {{improving}} patient safety and understanding performance shaping factors in patient care. We report {{our experience of}} using <b>video</b> <b>recording</b> techniques in a trauma centre, including how to gain cooperation of clinicians for <b>video</b> <b>recording</b> of their workplace performance, identify strengths of video compared with observation, and suggest processes for consent and maintenance of confidentiality of <b>video</b> <b>records.</b> <b>Video</b> <b>records</b> are {{a rich source of}} data for documenting clinician performance which reveal safety and systems issues not identified by observation. Emergency procedures and <b>video</b> <b>records</b> of critical events identified patient safety, clinical, quality assurance, systems failures, and ergonomic issues. <b>Video</b> <b>recording</b> is a powerful feedback and training tool and provides a reusable record of events that can be repeatedly reviewed and used as research data. It allows expanded analyses of time critical events, trauma resuscitation, anaesthesia, and surgical tasks. To overcome some of the key obstacles in deploying <b>video</b> <b>recording</b> techniques, researchers should (1) develop trust with <b>video</b> <b>recorded</b> subjects, (2) obtain clinician participation for introduction of a new protocol or line of investigation, (3) report aggregated <b>video</b> <b>recorded</b> data and use clinician reviews for feedback on covert processes and cognitive analyses, and (4) involve multidisciplinary experts in medicine and nursing...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{increasing}} numbers of researchers have begun to investigate second language acquisition within the socio-cultural context in which it occurs using qualitative methods and approaches such as an ethnographic approach. This frequently entails audio and/or <b>video</b> <b>recording</b> {{of the participants in}} naturalistic contexts. Yet theoretical and methodological issues related to <b>video</b> <b>recording</b> have not yet received {{a great deal of attention}} in the second language acquisition literature. The purpose of this paper is to initiate such a discussion among SLA researchers. This is accomplished by reviewing the visual anthropology, educational anthropology, and ethnographic filmmaking literature on three questions concerning the collection of valid <b>video</b> <b>recorded</b> data: a) How should the interaction be <b>video</b> <b>recorded?</b> b) Who should be <b>video</b> <b>recorded?</b> c) Who should do the <b>video</b> <b>recording?</b> Examples from my own research are presented to illustrate the kinds of problems that might be encountered in each of these areas. Finally I present my reflections on the decisions I made when videotaping so that other SLA researchers using <b>video</b> <b>recording</b> might gain some insights that will assist them when dealing with the theoretical, methodological and practical considerations of planning and implementing their SLA studies using an ethnographic approach...|$|R

Methods: Jurisprudence was searched to exemplify legislation on <b>video</b> <b>recording</b> in health care. In addition, legislation was translated for different applications of video in health care found in the literature. Results: Three principles in Western law are relevant for <b>video</b> <b>recording</b> in health care practice: (1) regulations on privacy regarding personal data, which apply to the gathering and processing of video data in health care settings; (2) the patient <b>record,</b> in which <b>video</b> data can be stored; and (3) professional secrecy, which protects the privacy of patients including video data.
