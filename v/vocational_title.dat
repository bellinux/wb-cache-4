5000|$|The most {{acceptable}} term currently for the brother's vocation is [...] "religious brother", and the <b>vocational</b> <b>title</b> is [...] "Brother," [...] sometimes abbreviated as [...] "Bro." [...] or [...] "Br." [...] The generic use of {{the term}} [...] "brother" [...] to describe fraternal and/or spiritual relationships between men in communities can sometimes lead to confusion {{about what it means to}} be a [...] "brother" [...] (religious). According to canon law, brothers are neither [...] "lay nor clerical" [...] but instead belong to the religious state of life. Hence, the <b>vocational</b> <b>title</b> [...] "brother" [...] is generally not used by seminarians (other than in monastic or mendicant Orders) in order to avoid the impression that being a brother is a developmental phase of clerical formation. However, as equal members of the same community, both priests and brothers would consider themselves brothers in the fraternal, communal sense of the term.|$|E
5000|$|In the past, {{the term}} lay brother was used within some Catholic {{religious}} institutes, to distinguish {{members who were}} not ordained from those members who were clerics (priests and seminarians). This term is now considered controversial by some because {{of the history of}} inequality between Brothers and clerics. The term [...] "lay" [...] has also been used in the past to designate someone as [...] "uneducated" [...] in contrast to [...] "illiterate". Instead, the term [...] "religious Brother" [...] or simply [...] "Brother" [...] is appropriate when referring to a vowed male religious who is neither priest, deacon, nor seminarian. The <b>vocational</b> <b>title</b> [...] "Brother" [...] is generally capitalized in order to distinguish it from the generic use of the biologically relational term [...] "brother".|$|E

30|$|Several {{instruments}} {{have been}} developed to assess resemblance with the RIASEC interest types, almost all variants of John Holland’s self-directed search measure (SDS; Holland, 1979). The SDS has been primarily developed as a tool for the self-exploration of interests. SDS measures typically list a broad series of activities and <b>vocational</b> <b>titles</b> that individuals may like or want to try out, supplemented with skills and characteristics that further define the RIASEC interest domains. The SDS family of tools has been successfully distributed and implemented world-wide, including Brazil. For example, the Self-Directed Search Career Explorer (SDS: CE; Holland, Fritzsche, and Powell, 1994) has been translated and adapted by Primi, Mansão, Muniz, and Nunes (2010) for adolescents. Teixeira, Castro, and Cavalheiro (2008) developed a 48 -item version for adolescents and adults, whereas Mansão and Noronha (2011), and Meireles and Primi (2015) developed and validated a 154 -item RIASEC measure for adolescents. Given their exploratory nature, SDS-based measures refer to a broad set of characteristics of the individual or activities and occupations that he or she may want to try out. Instruments are hence long and not directly useful for large-scale assessment. In addition, the content covered by interest tools is relatively time-bound: activities and vocation titles quickly change, and what is an appropriate item today may sound outdated 10  years later.|$|R

This paper provides a theoretical perspective for the Rand study by: (1) analyzing knowledge of planned educational change; and (2) proposing a conceptual model of factors that affect the change processes within school districts. Following the introduction, section 2 first assesses the literature on program and policy studies and then critically examines the analytical literature on planned change in education to select and formulate major theoretical issues. Section 3 suggests an approach to investigating these concerns and proposes a conceptual model. It is argued that th...|$|R

Educational supervision is a process concerned with providing leadership which facilitates attainment of the organizational goals of schools. Schools achieve their purposes through the human organization. Teachers and their immediate supervisors, principals, are two of the major parties involved in the human organization of schools. The problem investigated in the study was: What relationships exist between teachers' needs orientations and their preferred principal leadership styles? The hypotheses tested were: There is no significant relationship between teachers' needs orientations groups (intrinsic, extrinsic) and Leader Behavior Description Questionnaire-Form XII scores when analyzed by (1) sex of teachers, (2) age of teachers, (3) years of experience of teachers, (4) tenure status of teachers, (5) size of attendance centers, (6) level of attendance centers, and (7) {{the presence or absence of}} a negotiated teachers' contract. The population studied consisted of all public school teachers in the 134 attendance centers of the nine unit districts in Kane County, Illinois. A 20 percent random stratified sample was adopted. The sample consisted of 814 teachers in twenty-six attendance centers. Needs orientations were assessed by a revised version of the Choice-Motivator Scale. The Scale consisted of twenty-two pairs of <b>vocational</b> <b>titles</b> and ten suggested reasons for choices made for each pair. Five of the reasons indicated extrinsic motivations and five intrinsic motivations. Teachers were directed to choose one vocational choice from each pair and to select a reason for that choice. Extrinsic and intrinsic scores were obtained from the reasons selected. The list of reasons was revised for the purposes of the study. Content validity of the revised reasons was established by the use of a panel of experts approach. Reliability of the revised reasons was established through a test-retest procedure. Preferred principal leadership styles were assessed by teachers responding to the LBDQ-Form XII. Directions were reworded so as to instruct teachers to answer the items in terms of their preferred principal leadership style, not the extant leadership style of their present principal. Results obtained on the LBDQ-Form XII were analyzed according to twelve subscores, a total score, and two factor scores. The twelve subscores were representation, demand reconciliation, tolerance of uncertainty, persuasiveness, initiation of structure, tolerance of freedom, role assumption, consideration, production emphasis, predictive accuracy, integration, and superior orientation. The two factor scores were system-oriented and person-oriented leadership, each of which were comprised of six of the twelve subscores. Seven two-way analyses of variance were computed for each of the scores of the LBDQ-Form XII. Descriptive data for the scores was also obtained. The alpha point was set at. 05. The following conclusions were based upon the analysis of the findings of the study. It was concluded that (1) most of the teachers studied were intrinsically motivated persons, (2) a substantial relationship existed between teachers' needs orientations groups and the subscore consideration, (3) some relationship existed between groups and the subscore tolerance of uncertainty, (4) some relationship existed between groups and the factor score person orientation, (5) there was very little interactive relationship between groups and the secondary independent variables, and (6) the factors of the presence or absence of a negotiated teachers' contract, the sex of teachers, and the age of teachers were equally, or perhaps more, important than groups when studying relationships between teachers' needs orientations and their preferred principal leadership style...|$|R
