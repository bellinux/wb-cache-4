5|$|In 1847, Hodgson {{described}} a red panda {{under the name}} Ailurus ochraceus, of which Pocock concluded it represents the same type as Ailurus fulgens, since {{the description of the}} two agree <b>very</b> <b>closely.</b> He subordinated both types to the Himalayan red panda subspecies Ailurus fulgens fulgens.|$|E
5|$|While {{there can}} be {{considerable}} variation across members of a species—and while the results are obviously impacted by the effects of moult and feather regeneration—even <b>very</b> <b>closely</b> related species show clear differences in their wing formulas.|$|E
5|$|From 1942–1945, Peng's {{role in the}} war {{was mostly}} political, and he {{supported}} Mao <b>very</b> <b>closely.</b> In June 1944 Peng {{was part of a}} team that held conferences with American military personnel that visited Yan'an as part of the Dixie Mission, briefing the Americans about the military situation in Japanese-occupied China.|$|E
50|$|A <b>very</b> similar, <b>closely</b> related species, Salix pedicellaris (bog willow), {{occurs in}} {{northern}} North America; it {{is classified as}} a variety of swamp willow S. myrtilloides var. pedicellaris by some botanists.|$|R

50|$|The 174 km Putty Road is <b>very</b> historic, <b>closely</b> {{following}} the Bulga Road (named after the Bulga Creek), first explored by John Howe, Chief Constable of Windsor, {{being the first}} road to link Sydney to the Hunter Valley. It was opened in 1823 and was initially a popular cattle-rustling route.|$|R
5|$|Hama {{wrote out}} page-by-page plots {{for all of}} the issues he wrote, with most pages having four to six panels. He worked <b>very</b> <b>closely</b> with the artists in {{plotting}} the book, and wrote the series spontaneously, never knowing how an issue would end until he got to the last page.|$|E
5|$|The northwestern crow (C. caurinus) is <b>very</b> <b>closely</b> {{related to}} the American crow. Its {{ancestors}} became separated by Ice Age glaciation west of the Rocky Mountains. It is endemic to Pacific temperate rain forests where it all but replaces the American crow. Only in the Seattle region do they co-occur to any extent. In form the two species are much alike. There is a marked difference in voice.|$|E
5|$|The operas of his mature period, Jenůfa (1904), Káťa Kabanová (1921), The Cunning Little Vixen (1924), The Makropulos Affair (1926) and From the House of the Dead (after a {{novel by}} Dostoyevsky and premièred posthumously in 1930) are {{considered}} his finest works. The Australian conductor Sir Charles Mackerras became <b>very</b> <b>closely</b> associated with Janáček's operas.|$|E

50|$|In Western art, {{architectural}} {{painting as}} an independent genre developed in the 16th century in Flanders and the Netherlands, and reached its peak in 16th and 17th century Dutch painting. Later, it developed in a tool for Romantic paintings, with e.g. views of ruins becoming <b>very</b> popular. <b>Closely</b> related genres are architectural fantasies and trompe-l'oeils, especially illusionistic ceiling painting, and cityscapes.|$|R
5|$|There {{are four}} ghost {{stations}} on the Buenos Aires Underground, two on Line A and two on Line E. The Line A stations – Pasco Sur and Alberti Norte – were closed in 1953 since stations {{in that part}} of the line were grouped <b>very</b> <b>closely</b> together and having fewer stops would improve the line's frequency. Pasco Sur remains in very good condition, while Alberti Norte was converted into an electrical substation.|$|E
5|$|Yann Martel named a {{character}} in his Man Booker Prize-winning novel Life of Pi (2001) after Poe's fictional character, Richard Parker. Mat Johnson's 2011 novel Pym is a satirical fantasy exploring racial politics in the United States, drawing its inspiration from The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket, {{as well as being}} modeled <b>very</b> <b>closely</b> on the original.|$|E
5|$|Author John Macklin {{includes}} an account in his 1965 book, Strange Destinies, of two green children {{who arrived in}} the Spanish village of Banjos in 1887. Many details of the story <b>very</b> <b>closely</b> resemble the accounts given of the Woolpit children, such as the name of Ricardo de Calno, the mayor of Banjos who befriends the two children, strikingly similar to Richard de Calne. It therefore seems that Macklin's story is an invention inspired by the green children of Woolpit, particularly {{as there is no}} record of any Spanish village called Banjos.|$|E
50|$|This {{endangered}} species is endemic to the Mae Klong basin (including Khwae Noi River) in Thailand, and the Ataran River on the Thai-Myanmar border. Records from the Mekong basin are misidentifications of the <b>very</b> similar and <b>closely</b> related A. nigrolineata.|$|R
50|$|The {{leaves are}} alternate, stipulate, paripinnate compound, <b>very</b> numerous, <b>closely</b> placed, rachis 8.8-12.5 cm long, {{narrowly}} furrowed, slender, pubescent, with an erect linear gland between the leaflets of each pair, leaflets 16-24, very shortly stalked 2-2.5 cm long 1-1.3 cm broad, slightly overlapping, oval oblong, obtuse, at both ends, mucronate, glabrous or minutely downy, dull green, paler beneath, stipules very large, reniform-rotund, produced at base on side of next petiole into a filliform point and persistent.|$|R
5000|$|The bluish white shell has an {{elongate}} conic shape. The {{length of}} the shell measures 7.4 mm. The teleoconch of the type specimen contains 11½ whorls, marked by <b>very</b> fine, <b>closely</b> spaced, incised spiral lines.The short, rounded base of the shell shows rather strong incremental lines and the same spiral sculpture as seen on the spire. The oval aperture has a thin outer lip. The inner lip is slightly sinuous and reflected over. The parietal wall is covered by a thin callus.|$|R
5|$|Baker's yeast or Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a {{unicellular}} fungus, {{is used to}} make {{bread and}} other wheat-based products, such as pizza dough and dumplings. Yeast species of the genus Saccharomyces are also used to produce alcoholic beverages through fermentation. Shoyu koji mold (Aspergillus oryzae) is an essential ingredient in brewing Shoyu (soy sauce) and sake, and the preparation of miso, while Rhizopus species are used for making tempeh. Several of these fungi are domesticated species that were bred or selected according to their capacity to ferment food without producing harmful mycotoxins (see below), which are produced by <b>very</b> <b>closely</b> related Aspergilli. Quorn, a meat substitute, is made from Fusarium venenatum.|$|E
5|$|Besides these unique characteristics, Sampson {{pointed out}} {{additional}} differences with two <b>very</b> <b>closely</b> related forms. The frill spikes of Achelousaurus are more outwards oriented than the spikes of Einiosaurus, which are medially curved; the spikes of Achelousaurus are nevertheless less {{directed to the}} outside than the comparable spikes of Pachyrhinosaurus. Achelousaurus also differs from Pachyrhinosaurus in its smaller nasal boss that does not reach the frontal bones at its rear. Apart from the skull, no features of the skeleton are known that distinguish Achelousaurus from {{other members of the}} Centrosaurinae.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, Carradine earned {{critical}} {{praise for}} {{his portrayal of}} folksinger Woody Guthrie in Hal Ashby's Bound for Glory (1976) for which he won a National Board of Review Award for Best Actor. He was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award and New York Film Critics Circle Award {{for his role as}} Guthrie. Carradine worked <b>very</b> <b>closely</b> with his friend, singer-songwriter-guitarist Guthrie Thomas, on the Bound for Glory film. Thomas assisted Carradine in the guitar style of the period and the songs that had been chosen to be in the film itself.|$|E
25|$|Eurypterus {{with broad}} paddles and metastoma. Postabdomen has small epimera. Pretelson has large rounded epimera with imbricate scales (overlapping, similar to fish scales). It is <b>very</b> similar and <b>closely</b> related to E. tetragonophthalmus. The species {{was named after}} the Norwegian {{paleontologist}} Gunnar Henningsmoen. Found in Bærum, Norway.|$|R
50|$|It has a broad, ovoid-shaped mantle and {{can reach}} a total length (including arms) {{of up to}} 50 cm. The head is {{narrower}} {{than the rest of}} the body with a filament over each eye. The octopus's colour is yellowish or reddish-orange to reddish-brown dorsally with diffuse rust-brown patches, and white on the underside. The skin is covered with <b>very</b> fine, <b>closely</b> set granulations, interspersed with larger warts. The relatively short arms have a single series of suckers on them and at rest are held with the tips lightly curled, hence the species's common name.|$|R
50|$|The corallites are <b>very</b> {{small and}} <b>closely</b> packed. They are joined {{directly}} {{to one another}} by fused but porous walls and have diagnostic skeletal characteristics that are only visible under the microscope. The septa are also fused. The polyps are 1 millimetre (0.04 in) in diameter and the coenosarc covering the skeleton is thin.|$|R
5|$|Porpoises are a {{group of}} fully aquatic marine mammals that are {{sometimes}} referred to as mereswine, all of which are classified under the family Phocoenidae, parvorder Odontoceti (toothed whales). There are six extant species of porpoise. They are small toothed whales that are <b>very</b> <b>closely</b> related to oceanic dolphins. The most obvious visible {{difference between the two groups}} is that porpoises have shorter beaks and flattened, spade-shaped teeth distinct from the conical teeth of dolphins. Porpoises, and other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates, and their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged from them about 40 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|This list classifies all of {{the works}} by Priestley. It is taken from Ronald E. Crook's A Bibliography of Joseph Priestley 1733-1804 (unless {{otherwise}} noted) and it follows <b>very</b> <b>closely</b> his generic subdivisions. All texts are by Priestley unless otherwise noted and only the first English language editions of the texts are listed below. The dash {{at the beginning of}} each entry below is a shorthand for the author's name, Joseph Priestley, consistent with standard bibliographic custom.|$|E
5|$|Viva Piñata {{was planned}} as a larger {{intellectual}} property. 4Kids TV {{had agreed to}} make a Viva Piñata cartoon before the game was released. 4Kids selected the series out of several Microsoft properties offered. 4Kids also handled the series merchandising. The cartoon is tied <b>very</b> <b>closely</b> to the game, and its animations {{are based on the}} game's own 3D character models. Its episodes are approved by Rare's Gregg Mayles for their applicability to the game. The cartoon was also designed to give viewers tips on how to interact with the in-game piñatas. The animated series' storyline later influenced the plot of Trouble in Paradise.|$|E
50|$|The Baltistan and Skardu area, under Pakistani {{rule and}} entirely Muslim, {{used to be}} {{included}} in what is geographically referred to as Ladakh. Before partition, Baltistan was one of the districts of Ladakh. Skardo was the winter capital of Ladakh while Leh was the summer capital. People of Baltistan and Ladakh speak <b>very</b> similar languages <b>closely</b> related to Tibetan.|$|R
50|$|Tabebuia ochracea is a timber tree {{native to}} South America, Cerrado and Pantanal {{vegetation}} in Brazil. It is <b>very</b> similar and <b>closely</b> related to and often {{confused with the}} Golden Trumpet Tree, Tabebuia chrysotricha. It is a seasonal flowering tree, blossoming only during spring (September). During this time, all leaves fall and only flowers remain in the crown.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of {{residents of the}} Renbell province are Renbellanise of Polynesian descent. The Rennell and Bellona languages are <b>very</b> similar and <b>closely</b> related to New Zealand, Maori and Samoan languages. Most adults speak Solomon Pijin, although children and some unschooled young person’s will only be comfortable speaking Renbelian (Polynesian language), and most have some understanding of English.|$|R
5|$|Roa Bastos was an {{exponent}} of the Neobaroque {{style that}} brought Latin American literature {{to the fore}} internationally in the mid-20th century. Among others, the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda is also associated with this school of writing. The style uses a complex system of metaphors that are often <b>very</b> <b>closely</b> tied to the land, flora {{and culture of the}} particular writer, {{especially in the case of}} Roa Bastos. Magic realism is a Neobaroque concept that applies such systems of metaphor to otherwise realistic settings (Yo, el Supremo being a notable example of the form). The Neobaroque style was used by many Paraguayan writers in exile after 1947 and until the 1980s. At the core of much of the work from this group are ideas of political freedom and the emancipation of their homeland.|$|E
5|$|Sorkin {{has written}} for the theatre, film and television, and in each medium his level of {{collaboration}} with other creators has varied. He began in theatre which involved a largely solitary writing process, then moved into film where he collaborated with director Rob Reiner and screenwriter William Goldman, and eventually worked in television where he collaborated <b>very</b> <b>closely</b> with director Thomas Schlamme {{for nearly a decade}} on the shows Sports Night, The West Wing and Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip; he now moves between all three media. He has a habit of chain smoking while he spends countless hours cooped up in his office plotting out his next scripts. He describes his writing process as physical because he will often stand up and speak the dialogue he is developing.|$|E
5|$|The Sind sparrow (Passer pyrrhonotus) is a {{passerine}} bird of the sparrow family Passeridae, found {{around the}} Indus valley region in South Asia. It {{is also known}} as the jungle, Sind jungle, or rufous-backed sparrow. Very similar to the related house sparrow, it is smaller and has distinguishing plumage features. As in the house sparrow, the male has brighter plumage than female and young birds, including black markings and a grey crown. Distinctively, the male has a chestnut stripe running down its head behind the eye, and the female has a darker head than other sparrow species do. Its main vocalisations are soft chirping calls that are extended into longer songs with other sounds interspersed by breeding males. Historically, this species was thought to be <b>very</b> <b>closely</b> related to the house sparrow, but its closest evolutionary affinities may lie elsewhere. Discovered around 1840, this species went undetected for several decades after its discovery.|$|E
50|$|The Prussian army, {{commanded}} by Prince Blücher, was cantoned south east of Brussels with {{its headquarters in}} Namur. The Anglo-allied army, {{commanded by}} the Duke of Wellington, was cantoned south west Brussels with its headquarters in Brussels. Wellington's army included contingents from the British Army (including the KGL), Hanover (their king was also the king of Britain), Brunswick (until <b>very</b> recently <b>closely</b> associated with Hanover and hence the British), the Kingdom of the Netherlands (Dutch and Belgian troops), and Nassau (had close dynastic ties with the Netherlands {{and part of the}} territory had until very recently been ruled by the King of the Netherlands).|$|R
60|$|In the {{meantime}} Dick hastened to secure his post. The street {{he had to}} guard was <b>very</b> narrow, and <b>closely</b> lined with houses, which projected and overhung the roadway; but narrow and dark as it was, since it opened upon the market-place of the town, {{the main issue of}} the battle would probably fall to be decided on that spot.|$|R
50|$|Sepioteuthis lessoniana, {{commonly}} known as the bigfin reef squid or oval squid, is a commercially important species of loliginid squid. It is one of the three currently recognized species belonging to the genus Sepioteuthis. Studies in 1993, however, have indicated that bigfin reef squids may comprise a cryptic species complex. The species is likely to include several <b>very</b> similar and <b>closely</b> related species.|$|R
