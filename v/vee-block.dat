30|$|Insert {{presetting}} on the boring-bar {{is carried}} out {{with the help of}} a portable <b>Vee-block</b> insert setting gauge on the horizontal boring-bar.|$|E
30|$|Iteration no. 2 {{corresponds}} to the intermediary phase readings after performing moderate improvements like setting up a standard procedure for tool-insert setting on boring bar, cleaning the filter–regulator–lubrication (FRL) unit of pneumatic gauges and replacing the worn out cutting tool insert edge. In Iteration 2, a slight cyclic pattern is observed. This {{is because of the}} reason that there is a constant progressive wear out of the boring bar insert on continued boring operation. After every ten components being machined, the boring bar insert must be compensated for the wear by elevating the insert by about five micrometers, over the diametric dimension. This exercise is performed {{with the help of a}} test mandrel and a boring bar tool insert setting <b>Vee-block.</b> Because of worn out Vee-surfaces of tool insert setting <b>Vee-block,</b> though the insert setting is done it is not accurate and this is reflected in the cyclic pattern observed in the second optimization step of Iteration 2. As a measure of corrective action, a new insert setting <b>Vee-block</b> is replaced with the old worn-out piece and the Vee surfaces of the <b>Vee-Block</b> are case hardened to achieve hardness up to 55 HRc with a case depth of 0.5 – 0.8  mm. In this iteration we see a marginal increase in CP to 1.32 and CPK to 0.90.|$|E
40|$|Five {{different}} anti-wear additives, {{suitable to}} formulate environmentally adapted hydraulic fluids, were tested. The used base fluid was a saturated, environmentally adapted synthetic complex ester. The tested materials were steel-steel and bronze-steel. A modified Falex pin and a <b>vee-block</b> tester {{were used for}} the tribotests. XPS was used to characterize the surfaces. It was found that the new types of more polar additives work better than the traditional ones, though they can give selective transfer of cupper to the steel pin. To use this type of additives in fully formulated products more investigations have to be performed...|$|E
50|$|The top {{and lower}} link pivots use roller bearings, {{reducing}} friction relative to plain bearings and improving both the smoothness {{and speed of}} suspension response. The position {{and shape of the}} rubber <b>vee-blocks</b> and Metalastik bushes are designed to ensure sufficiently rigid suspension mounting for good control whilst successfully isolating the body from NVH.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{insulate}} the passenger compartment from noise, vibration and harshness (NVH), the {{independent rear suspension}} {{was designed to be}} carried in a separate crossbeam assembly attached to the vehicle body by four rubber <b>vee-blocks.</b> The only other points of contact with the vehicle body (i.e. the radius arms) are by means of metal sleeved (Metalastik) rubber bushes, so there is no metal-to-metal contact between the suspension and vehicle body. The fabricated steel crossbeam carries the differential and inboard brakes (if fitted).|$|R
5000|$|The {{complete}} {{rear suspension}} assembly is {{carried in a}} steel crossbeam (shown ghosted in the diagram below), which {{is attached to the}} vehicle body via four rubber <b>vee-blocks</b> and also carries the differential (blue) and inboard brakes (red). The rear wheels are located transversely by top links and wheel carriers (green) and lower links (cyan). The top link is the driving half-shaft with a universal joint at each end. The lower link pivots adjacent to the differential casing at its inboard end and where it meets the wheel carrier at the wheel hub casting (violet) at its outboard end. The pivot bearings {{at each end of the}} lower link are widely spaced so as to provide maximum longitudinal rigidity. Suspension is provided by two coil spring and damper units (yellow) on each side of the differential casing (four in total), the spring and damper units attaching to the crossbeam at the top and the lower link at the bottom. The crossbeam is located by two radius arms (see photo above) each of which runs forward from the lower link to a point on the vehicle body and is pivoted at each end via rubber bushings.|$|R
40|$|The girders for the Australian Synchrotron Storage Ring {{are aligned}} by a cam and <b>vee-block</b> {{system that allows}} fine {{adjustment}} of each girder in all six degrees of freedom. The adjustment assembly also contains a constrained layer damping (CLD) plate to minimise the transmission of ground vibration to the magnets. An algorithm has been developed to calculate the required adjustment of each cam to achieve the desired movement. The performance of the adjustment system has been characterized and an efficient and accurate alignment strategy developed. Vibration measurements have also been taken to asses {{the effectiveness of the}} CLD plates in reducing magnet motion. 1...|$|E
