5|$|The {{apparent}} magnitude (v) of HD 154672 is 8.22, {{which means that}} it is not <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> naked eye. It is slightly dimmer than Neptune, which has an {{apparent magnitude}} of 7.78 at its brightest.|$|E
5|$|The nucleus {{reached its}} maximum {{apparent}} size in December 1882. The comet faded gradually, but despite its fragmentation it remained <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> naked eye until February 1883. The last definite sighting {{of the comet}} was made by B. A. Gould at Córdoba on 1 June 1883.|$|E

5|$|With an {{apparent}} magnitude of 3.4, the Andromeda Galaxy {{is among the}} brightest of the Messier objects - making it <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> naked eye on moonless nights, even when viewed from areas with moderate light pollution.|$|E
5|$|According to {{measurements}} {{made by the}} Hipparcos astrometric satellite, Mu Arae {{exhibits a}} parallax of 64.47 milliarcseconds as the Earth moves around the Sun. When combined with the known distance from the Earth to the Sun, this means the star is located {{at a distance of}} 50.6 light years (15.51 parsecs). Seen from Earth it has an apparent magnitude of +5.12 and is <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> naked eye.|$|E

5|$|Although {{above the}} horizon and hence <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ancient Greeks, Antlia's stars were too faint to have been {{included}} in any ancient constellations. The stars that now comprise Antlia lay within an area of the sky covered by the ancient constellation Argo Navis, the Ship of the Argonauts, which due to its immense size was split into several smaller constellations by Lacaille in 1763. Ridpath reports that due to their faintness, the stars of Antlia did not make up part of the classical depiction of Argo Navis.|$|E
5|$|As {{the galactic}} plane passes through it, Serpens Cauda {{contains}} many massive OB stars. Several {{of these are}} <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> naked eye, such as NW Serpentis, an early Be star that {{has been found to}} be somewhat variable. The variability is interesting; according to one study, it could be one of the first discovered hybrids between Beta Cephei variables and slowly pulsating B stars. Although not <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> naked eye, HD 167971 (MY Serpentis) is a Beta Lyrae variable triple system consisting of three very hot O-type stars. A member of the cluster NGC 6604, the two eclipsing stars are both blue giants, with one being of the very early spectral type O7.5III. The remaining star is either a blue giant or supergiant of a late O or early B spectral type. Also an eclipsing binary, the HD 166734 system consists of two O-type blue supergiants in orbit around each other. Less extreme in terms of mass and temperature is HD 161701, a spectroscopic binary consisting of a B-type primary and an Ap secondary, although it is the only known spectroscopic binary to consist of a star with excess of mercury and manganese and an Ap star.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria {{display a}} wide {{diversity}} {{of shapes and}} sizes, called morphologies. Bacterial cells are about one-tenth the size of eukaryotic cells and are typically 0.5–5.0micrometres in length. However, a few species are <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> unaided eye—for example, Thiomargarita namibiensis is up to half a millimetre long and Epulopiscium fishelsoni reaches 0.7mm. Among the smallest bacteria {{are members of the}} genus Mycoplasma, which measure only 0.3micrometres, as small as the largest viruses. Some bacteria may be even smaller, but these ultramicrobacteria are not well-studied.|$|E

5|$|Beta Pictoris {{is a star}} in the {{southern}} constellation of Pictor, the Easel, and is located {{to the west of the}} bright star Canopus. It traditionally marked the sounding line of the ship Argo Navis, before the constellation was split. The star has an apparent visual magnitude of 3.861, so is <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> naked eye under good conditions, though light pollution may result in stars dimmer than magnitude 3 being too dim to see. It is the second brightest in its constellation, exceeded only by Alpha Pictoris, which has an apparent magnitude of 3.30.|$|E
5|$|Both the {{apparent}} and absolute magnitude scales are logarithmic units: one whole number difference in magnitude {{is equal to}} a brightness variation of about 2.5 times (the 5th root of 100 or approximately 2.512). This means that a first magnitude star (+1.00) is about 2.5 times brighter than a second magnitude (+2.00) star, and about 100 times brighter than a sixth magnitude star (+6.00). The faintest stars <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> naked eye under good seeing conditions are about magnitude +6.|$|E
5|$|Comets {{are small}} Solar System bodies, {{typically}} {{only a few}} kilometres across, composed largely of volatile ices. They have highly eccentric orbits, generally a perihelion within the orbits of the inner planets and an aphelion far beyond Pluto. When a comet enters the inner Solar System, its proximity to the Sun causes its icy surface to sublimate and ionise, creating a coma: a long tail {{of gas and dust}} often <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> naked eye.|$|E

5|$|HD 2039 is {{a yellow}} dwarf or yellow subgiant {{star in the}} {{constellation}} Phoenix. The star is not <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> naked eye, and lies approximately 330 light years away from the Sun. HD 2039 is a relatively stable star, and an exoplanet {{at least three times}} the mass of the planet Jupiter has been discovered in its orbit; this exoplanet, known as HD 2039 b, was the 100th exoplanet to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|Hale–Bopp became <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{naked eye}} in May 1996, and {{although}} its rate of brightening slowed considerably {{during the latter}} half of that year, scientists were still cautiously optimistic that it would become very bright. It was too closely aligned with the Sun to be observable during December 1996, but when it reappeared in January 1997 it was already bright enough to be seen by anyone who looked for it, even from large cities with light-polluted skies.|$|E
5|$|Hale–Bopp was a record-breaking comet—the {{farthest}} comet {{from the}} Sun discovered by amateurs, {{with the largest}} well-measured cometary nucleus known after 95P/Chiron, and it was <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> naked eye for {{twice as long as}} the previous record-holder.

5|$|Hale–Bopp was {{discovered}} on July 23, 1995 separately by Alan Hale and Thomas Bopp prior to it becoming naked-eye visible on Earth. Although predicting the maximum apparent brightness of new comets with {{any degree of}} certainty is difficult, Hale–Bopp met or exceeded most predictions when it passed perihelion on April 1, 1997. It was <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> naked eye for a record 18months, twice as long as the previous record holder, the Great Comet of 1811. Accordingly, Hale–Bopp was dubbed the Great Comet of 1997.|$|E
5|$|Halley's Comet or Comet Halley, officially {{designated}} 1P/Halley, is a short-period comet {{visible from}} Earth every 74–79 years. Halley {{is the only}} known short-period comet that is regularly <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> naked eye from Earth, and the only naked-eye comet that might appear twice in a human lifetime. Halley last appeared in the inner parts of the Solar System in 1986 and will next appear in mid-2061.|$|E
5|$|In early times, {{astronomy}} only {{comprised the}} observation and {{predictions of the}} motions of objects <b>visible</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> naked eye. In some locations, early cultures assembled massive artifacts that possibly had some astronomical purpose. In addition to their ceremonial uses, these observatories could be employed to determine the seasons, {{an important factor in}} knowing when to plant crops, as well as in understanding the length of the year.|$|E
