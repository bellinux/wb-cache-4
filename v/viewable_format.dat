50|$|Raw image {{files are}} {{sometimes}} called digital negatives, as they fulfill {{the same role}} as negatives in film photography: that is, the negative is not directly usable as an image, but has {{all of the information}} needed to create an image. Likewise, the process of converting a raw image file into a <b>viewable</b> <b>format</b> is sometimes called developing a raw image, by analogy with the film development process used to convert photographic film into viewable prints. The selection of the final choice of image rendering is {{part of the process of}} white balancing and color grading.|$|E
5000|$|... iMovie is {{a digital}} video editor. The process of film capture by {{a digital camera}} via FireWire is automated, with iMovie {{allowing}} users to split up their videos, add titles and special effects, and reorganize them into movies. It is also compatible with MPEG 4 cameras, AVCHD camcorders, HDV cameras, and Apple's iSight webcams. Photographs may also be used, and a soundtrack may be added using tracks from the user's iTunes music library. These can then be exported {{into a variety of}} <b>viewable</b> <b>formats,</b> including the [...]mov format used by Apple's QuickTime Player.|$|R
5000|$|Every day, Beaudet {{receives}} new {{offers from}} telephone companies and television stations. Incidentally, the first offer {{was from a}} French, not Canadian company. [...] The popularity has surged {{to the point that}} Beaudet has employed two other people, Simon Parizeau and Hugo Caron, to help with the production at his home in Boucherville. Work is underway to convert Têtes à claques to <b>formats</b> <b>viewable</b> on cell phones and iPods. Currently, Vertigo Candy is using Beaudet's animation and voice talent as advertising on its front page.|$|R
50|$|Filmed in June 2001 (airing in October), {{the band}} was {{featured}} along with Charlie Tagawa in {{a segment of the}} television show Bay Area Backroads hosted by Doug McConnell and produced for Bay Area station KRON, an NBC affiliate. The episode is archived on the San Francisco Chronicle website SFGate.com. and <b>viewable</b> here (QuickTime <b>format).</b> After the main segment, the episode closes with a short segment with McConnell singing When the Saints Go Marching In with the band. This is in addition to numerous appearances on KPIX's Evening Magazine from 1976-1991 and other San Francisco Bay Area television shows.|$|R
5000|$|Critics have {{considered}} the i'm Watch as a flop. CNET praises the device for its smooth interface and how it displays notifications and messages in an easily <b>viewable</b> <b>format.</b> The downside to this though, is that the watch {{is very difficult to}} set up. Battery life is very low, as it falls way short of other devices on the market. Laptop Magazine liked the internal memory capacity, but feels that the Bluetooth tethering causes too much hassle when connecting. They added that the watch looks like [...] "a timepiece from the future, but its performance does not match the Dick Tracy-style feature set." [...] Tech Radar commends the i'm Watch for its ability to pair with Android, iOS and BlackBerry devices, but is concerned about the poor hands-free control quality and lack of text message alerts.|$|E
40|$|A demosaicing {{algorithm}} {{is just a}} digital image process used to reconstruct full color image from the incomplete color samples output from a picture sensor overlaid with a color filter array (CFA). It {{is also known as}} CFA interpolation or color reconstruction. Most contemporary digital camera models acquire images using a single image sensor overlaid with a CFA, so demosaicing is the main processing pipeline required to render these images into a <b>viewable</b> <b>format.</b> Many modern digital camera models can save images in a natural format allowing the consumer to demosaicit using software, as opposed to utilizing the camera's built-in firmware. Thus demosaicing becomes and major area of research in vision processing applications. The key objective of the paper is to examine and analyze various image demosaicing techniques. The entire aim would be to explore various limitations of the earlier techniques. This paper ends up with the suitable gaps in earlier techniques.

40|$|Abstract Background Cellular {{processes}} {{depend on}} the function of intracellular molecular networks. The curation of the literature relevant to specific biological pathways is important for many theoretical and experimental research teams and communities. No current tool supports web publication or hosting of user-developed large scale annotated pathway diagrams. Sharing via web publication is needed to allow real-time access to the current literature pathway knowledgebase, both privately within a research team or publicly among the outside research community. Web publication also facilitates team and/or community input into the curation process while allowing centralized control of the curation and validation process. We have developed new tool to address these needs. Biological Pathway Publisher (BioPP) is a software suite for converting CellDesigner Systems Biology Markup Language (CD-SBML) formatted pathways into a web <b>viewable</b> <b>format.</b> The BioPP suite is available for private use and for depositing knowledgebases into a newly created public repository. Results BioPP suite is a web-based application that allows pathway knowledgebases stored in CD-SBML to be web published with an easily navigated user interface. The BioPP suite consists of four interrelated elements: a pathway publisher, an upload web-interface, a pathway repository for user-deposited knowledgebases and a pathway navigator. Users {{have the option to}} convert their CD-SBML files to HTML for restricted use or to allow their knowledgebase to be web-accessible to the scientific community. All entities in all knowledgebases in the repository are linked to public database entries as well as to a newly created public wiki which provides a discussion forum. Conclusion BioPP tools and the public repository facilitate sharing of pathway knowledgebases and interactive curation for research teams and scientific communities. BioPP suite is accessible at [URL] </p...|$|E
40|$|Library and University Collections adopted IIIF as a {{consortium}} member in 2016. This {{was an important}} step for the division: we've seen it as a vital framework and standard for beautification of digital resources streamlined, more sensible content workflows annotation and teaching potential sharing images and data with other, open-minded institutions …and we feel that in our constant drive {{to be at the}} forefront of library tech, it’s definitely something we should use. Since last year’s Repo Fringe, when we were talking about all of this theoretically, we’ve made a fair bit of progress. We went live in December when our image repository- LUNA- was upgraded to a IIIF-compliant version. Since then… the first tranche of our collections. ed websites have had the OpenSeadragon viewer embedded, saving clicks through to the LUNA system the Vernon CMS is attritionally having its jpegs replaced with iiif urls, saving space and hassle two brand new sites (St Cecilia’s Hall and the Coimbra group) have been built using IIIF from the ground up- the latter using the Cantaloupe server (as it houses a lot of non-Edinburgh material) on-the-fly manifest creation is being generated for museums objects and special collections the Mahabharata scroll is <b>viewable</b> in that <b>format</b> using Universal Viewer the Scottish Session Papers are incorporating IIIF and Tesseract OCR metadata games is getting a facelift exhibitions are moving to IIIF-enabled Omeka and most impressively… we have developed Polyanno, a world-leading tool for annotation, translation and transcription, which is proving popular amongst the big players in the community. Our memorandum with the NLS means we have an obvious basis to show how we can collaborate with other institutions, which is one of IIIF’s major strengths. We would hope, though, that IIIF’s open-ness means we can start to interoperate globally in the virtual space...|$|R
50|$|The Western Welsh Omnibus {{company had}} used a unique system for {{identifying}} the depôt to which a 'bus was allocated and up to 1948, these comprised symbols of squares, triangles, diamonds and circles coloured in black or red with thin white edging for the blacks and thick black edging for the reds. Following that year these were all changed to diamonds with their longer length vertical and the narrow width, horizontal and other colours were introduced and each diamond carried thick black edging with a thin white 'tracer' separating the outer and inner diamond colours within the symbol.Main depôts were located at Cardiff, Barry, Bridgend, Carmarthen, Pontypool, Crosskeys, Neath and Brecon. Depôt symbol changes were Cardiff; Black triangle changed to orange diamond with a horizontal black band across its minor width, Barry; Black diamond retained but with inner thin white tracer, Bridgend: red triangle changed to blue diamond, Carmarthen: changed from red square to green diamond, Pontypool: changed from black circle to brown diamond with horizontal white bar across minor width (although another source has stated a black horizontal bar), Crosskeys: changed from a black square to a yellow diamond, Neath: red diamond retained but with thicker black edging, Brecon: changed from red circle to white diamond.(Not confirmed is that an Aberdare sub-depôt carried a red diamond with the black letters AE, within the red area. There were sub-depôts at other South Wales towns and as the Western Welsh took over some other ’bus companies, the depôt symbols were extended with variations in diamond filled in colour plus letters like AM for Ammanford and E for Ely works and colours grey and white were introduced and some diamonds bore two colours, split horizontally. The absorption of the former Neath & Cardiff (N&C) express ’bus company meant that a white triangle {{was added to the}} coach side. A separate colour chart of principal symbols seen on a wallchart in 1949 is <b>viewable</b> in jpg <b>format</b> on Wikipedia.|$|R
40|$|The Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) of the Department of Transportation is {{required}} to identify areas unusually sensitive to environmental damage {{in the event of}} a hazardous liquid pipeline accident. Pipeline operators that can affect these "unusually sensitive areas" (USAs) must develop and follow an integrity management program to continually assess and evaluate the integrity of their pipelines. After extensive consultation and pilot testing with conservation biologists, government agencies, drinking water experts, and other stakeholders, a process has been developed to identify USAs for both ecological resources and drinking water. The process begins by designating and assessing environmentally sensitive areas (ESAs), then determining which ESAs are potentially more susceptible to permanent or long-term damage from a hazardous liquid release. Finally, criteria were identified to determine which resources can be affected by a release and sustain permanent or long-term damage. Ecological USAs are defined and mapped based on the presence of critically imperiled species, assemblages of multiple imperiled or endangered species, the presence of sensitive species that are aquatically dependent or have a limited terrestrial range, and concentrations of migratory waterbirds. Mapping these areas nationwide made use of ecological data from several sources, the majority coming from the Association for Biodiversity Information (ABI). Once created, maps of the USAs are posted on the RSPA Internet website in <b>viewable</b> <b>format</b> ([URL] and electronic versions of the GIS data layers are made available to pipeline operators for use with their GIS pipeline mapping systems. To identify and locate USAs, RSPA needed ecological data in a timely and standardized format. This included the location of imperiled, threatened, and endangered species. ABI aggregated data on the location and condition of species produced by its member organizations—the Natural Heritage Programs. This project represents the first time that detailed natural heritage data on specific locations of imperiled and endangered species have been aggregated nationwide for natural resource protection purposes. Previously, accomplishing this would have required a planning or regulatory agency to seek data from over fifty organizations across the country. ABI’s aggregated dataset represents the most authoritative collection of locational information on imperiled species available. This paper focuses on the process developed to identify USAs, development and provision of ecological data, and the mapping of USAs across the country...|$|E
