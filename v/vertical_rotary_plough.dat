40|$|In Italy, {{there has}} been a {{significant}} increase of the areas cultivated with short-rotation forestry (SRF) poplar (Populus spp.) for the production of lignocellulosic biomass.

This constitutes a serious obstacle for root development and water availability, which affect the successful establishment of the plantation. To this end the Unit of Agricultural Engineering of the Agricultural Research Council (CRA-ING) has developed a new system for reduced tillage (RT), to be used during the establishment of SRF poplar. This new system aims at breaking the tillage pan and at reducing both traffic intensity and site preparation cost. A new machine has been developed, which is based on a commercial <b>rotary</b> <b>plough,</b> suitably modified by adding a shank subsoiler. This machine can perform both deep soil ripping and surface ploughing in a single pass, treating narrow strips where poplar cuttings are to be planted.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to determine the}} coefficients of sorption and desorption of picloram in Ultisol (PVA) and Oxisol (LVA), displaying different physical and chemical characteristics. Samples of soil were collected at the 0 20 cm depth in degraded pasture areas in Vi√ßosa-MG. Firstly, the equilibrium time between the herbicide in solution and the herbicide which was sorbed in the soil was determined by the Batch Equilibrium method. The time required was 24 hours. Sorption and desorption studies were carried out under controlled laboratory conditions; the sorption evaluation consisted in adding 10. 0 mL of herbicide solutions at different concentrations to tubes containing 2. 00 g of soil, with <b>vertical</b> <b>rotary</b> agitation being maintained during the pre-determined equilibrium time. After centrifugation, supernatant extract cleaning and filtration, herbicide concentration was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV detection at 254 nm. Desorption was evaluated using the samples in the tubes after the sorption tests. The Freundlich model was used for interpretation of the sorption process. Ultisol showed higher adsorption coefficient (Kf a) compared with Oxisol, which may be attributed to the lower pH of the soil and its higher organic matter content. Desorption process occurred in both soils; the LVA allowed greater release of the previously sorbed molecules...|$|R
40|$|In the French Landes de Gascogne forest, {{the last}} 2009 storm damaged many young stands of Pinus pinaster. The {{susceptibility}} {{of the young}} trees to wind damage mainly depends on the mechanical stability of their root system. An optimal development of the root system allows a better anchorage at the adult age. In sandy soil, tillage could {{be a part of}} the key in the shallow root development because it can add artificial microtopography. To assess the incidence of reafforestation techniques on root system development and to find out which tree structure features are associated to toppling, we selected three neighboring 13 -years old planted stands with different tillage (full ploughing, strip <b>ploughing</b> and <b>rotary</b> <b>ploughing).</b> An inventory of stem leaning and direction of leaning, height and DBH was made. Three trees per toppling level (undamaged, leaning and toppled trees) were sampled in each plot. The root system architecture was measured by 3 D digitizing and microtopography was measured in a radius of 3 m around the trees. The percent of straight trees was significantly more important (37 %) in the full ploughing compare to the other stands (23 %) and the toppled trees were the tallest. After thirteen years, the strip ploughing plot had still a strong microtopography. The circular distribution of the root volume was studied as a proportion in three wind-oriented sectors. Undamaged trees showed a large reinforcement of root volume, length and number in the leeward quarter only, except in the strip plough plot. Larger trees which uproot with a root soil plate show generally a windward and a leeward reinforcement. In these smaller trees, which toppled, leeward roots could not move due to low plasticity of sand, whereas leeward roots were lifted easily in these low cohesion soil. To prevent toppling, reafforestation techniques should not hamper the root development leeward...|$|R

The effects of six soil preparation methods on the vegetation cover, seedling survival, dominant seedling height and seedling establishment were studied up to four years after seedling emergence. The methods were: no preparation, ordinary <b>ploughing,</b> <b>rotary</b> cultivation, deep <b>ploughing,</b> soil inversion, removal of topsoil.

Seedling survival and establishment without preparation, and with rotary cultivation, were close to nil, while the other soil preparation methods generally were more effective. Best seedling survival and establishment were obtained on seedbeds created by removing topsoil or by transposing it by deep ploughing or inversion. These seedbeds also suppressed competing vegetation, compared to seedbeds with topsoil at the surface. Seedling establishment after removal of topsoil, amounting to 8 % of sown germinable seed, was outstanding on sandy soil, but much poorer on silty soil.

Ploughing was the only treatment that caused a significant shift of seeds to the deeper profile. Ploughed plots had significantly fewer weed seedlings than other treatments, due to lower numbers of both summer grasses and broadleaf weeds. Undisturbed plots contained significantly fewer broadleaf species, and weed emergence was delayed.
