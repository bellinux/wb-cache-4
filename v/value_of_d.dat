25|$|As is {{the case}} with {{dimensions}} determined for lines, squares, and cubes, fractal dimensions are general descriptors that do not uniquely define patterns. The <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>D</b> for the Koch fractal discussed above, for instance, quantifies the pattern's inherent scaling, but does not uniquely describe nor provide enough information to reconstruct it. Many fractal structures or patterns could be constructed that have the same scaling relationship but are dramatically different from the Koch curve, as is illustrated in Figure 6.|$|E
25|$|An {{example is}} shown in the figure on the right with a water jet. The laminar {{two-dimensional}} jet amplifies small disturbances at the orifice to generate a vortex street. For this case, the flow speed, in terms of Reynolds number, was graphed against the disturbance frequency, in terms of the Strouhal number for a variety of disturbance amplitudes to reveal the region of instability as shown in the figure on the left. The <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>D</b> in the figure represents the ratio of the lateral disturbance displacement to the nozzle width; the disturbances were minute.|$|E

[...] Since d is approximately equal to 2(1−r), where r is the sample autocorrelation of the residuals, d=2 indicates no autocorrelation. The <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>d</b> always lies between 0 and 4. If the Durbin–Watson statistic is substantially less than 2, there is evidence of positive serial correlation. As a rough rule of thumb, if Durbin–Watson is less than 1.0, there may be cause for alarm. Small values of d indicate successive error terms are, on average, close in value to one another, or positively correlated. If d>2, successive error terms are, on average, much different in value from one another, i.e., negatively correlated. In regressions, this can imply an underestimation of the level of statistical significance.|$|E
2500|$|The {{net tonnage}} {{calculation}} {{is based on}} a number of factors, one of which is the moulded draft d. [...] The choice of the value to use for d can be complicated. [...] For ships subject to the International Convention on Load Lines, the Summer Load Line draft is used, with the exception of cases where that is a timber load line. [...] For passenger ships, the draft used is the deepest subdivision load line assigned in accordance with the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea. [...] Otherwise, if a ship has been assigned a load line by its national government, the draft for that summer load line is used. [...] If the ship has no load line, instead, a maximum draft assigned by its national government, that value is used, if it has been assigned a maximum.

40|$|Conformally equivariant {{quantization}} is {{a peculiar}} map between symbols <b>of</b> real weight <b>d</b> and differential operators acting on tensor densities, whose real weights are designed by l and l+d. The existence and uniqueness {{of such a}} map has been proved by Duval, Lecomte and Ovsienko for a generic weight d.
