40|$|Power {{conditioning}} circuit is {{an essential}} element for energy harvesting applications. Designed for input rectifying, voltage conversion and output regulation, power conditioning circuit transforms harvested energy from AC to DC and from an unregulated, usually low amplitude input voltage to a specified, well-regulated DC output to power the intended load. Drastically different from conventional power systems, energy harvesting devices usually collect energy from weak power sources and produce low amplitude AC outputs. These devices typically have high output impedance with pronounced reactance in comparison with a regular power supply. The electrical characteristics of the energy harvesting devices make it difficult or even impractical to use existing power conditioning solutions for energy harvesting applications. For example, the forward voltage drop of a typical rectifier diode will prevent those harvested energies with voltage amplitudes below this threshold to be rectified and delivered to their loads. In fact, many recent energy harvesting work are hampered {{by the lack of}} adequate power conditioning circuits and fail to prove their practical purposes and values of their energy harvesting techniques. Inspired by the early work on piezoelectric wind energy harvesting, this research work mainly focuses on low voltage power conditioning circuits for energy harvesting applications and covered both low voltage rectifier circuits and <b>voltage</b> <b>boosting</b> circuits that are essential for demonstrating the usefulness of energy harvesting techniques. By examining the device physics and operation principle of the existing current rectifying solutions, this work proposed a new low-voltage, high-efficiency hybrid rectifier circuit with low in-line rectifying voltage loss. This new circuit is prototyped and demonstrated to have the highest rectifying efficiency in comparison with other passive rectifier circuits from the literature. To achieve low-voltage and low-power <b>voltage</b> <b>boosting,</b> this work explored three most representative <b>voltage</b> <b>boosting</b> approaches for energy harvesting applications. It first studied the feasibility of passive <b>voltage</b> <b>boosting</b> method, which uses the reactive nature of the energy harvesting device to enhance its output voltage. By introducing an inductive load to a capacitive piezoelectric energy harvesting device, this research work studied the feasibility, advantages and limitations of the passive <b>voltage</b> <b>boosting</b> technique via transformer circuit, and presented bench measurement data for both voltage conversion ratio and power conversion efficiency. This work also studied two representative active <b>voltage</b> <b>boosting</b> circuits- charge pump type and inductive boost converter type. Both circuits are bench studied for their minimal input <b>voltage</b> range, <b>voltage</b> <b>boosting</b> capabilities and power conversion efficiencies. Based on these results, a low input voltage power conditioning circuit with hybrid input rectifier is developed and prototyped. Bench test on the prototype circuit showed that it has high power conversion efficiency around 60 % at 10 mW and low start-up voltage of approximately 0. 435 V VRMS which is better than others work from the literature. This new power conditioning circuit is tested in two energy harvesting applications (thermoelectric and piezoelectric) and both showed great energy harvesting results...|$|R
40|$|Using of {{low-voltage}} {{variable-frequency drive}} {{followed by a}} step-up transformer is the most preferable way to feed an electrical submersible pump motor. The existence of long feeder between the motor and drive systems usually causes over-voltage problems because of the travelling wave phenomenon, which makes the employment of filter networks on the motor or inverter terminals mandatory.

50|$|The IGFC system {{combines}} use of SOFCs as a {{topping cycle}} {{to the gas}} turbine or heat recovery steam generator-based bottoming cycle. Typical major components of the IGFC system, this one centered on a SOFC module running at atmospheric pressure, are identified in the simplified cycle diagram.The system fuel as depicted is coal, converted to syngas by the gasifier, which is then supplied to the SOFC module after cleanup and pressure reduction. The syngas pressure reduction step is accomplished in this system concept by an expander/generator, which thereby produces part of the cycle's gross power generation. Oxygen for the coal gasification process is provided by a conventional air separation unit, and steam for the gasifier is raised by power system heat and recycled water. Note that the SOFC module is configured to maintain the anode and cathode off-gas streams separated, and the anode off-gas, which contains some electrochemically-unreacted hydrogen and carbon monoxide, is combusted to completion at the oxy-combustor. Maintaining separation of the off-gas streams restricts the large atmospheric nitrogen content to the cathode side, and simplifies the CO2 capture process to anode off-gas cooling, water-vapor condensation, CO2 drying, and CO2 compression. Compressed CO2 is suitable for carbon utilization or storage (CUS) as appropriate. Heat recovered from the anode-side process {{can be used by}} a power-generating bottoming cycle consisting of a heat recovery steam generator and steam turbine. On the cathode side, process air for the SOFC electrochemical process and for module cooling is provided by an air blower; heat can be recovered from the hot cathode off-gas stream to preheat the process air as needed, and for the generation of additional power.Due to the inherently efficient SOFC, and to using recovered SOFC exhaust heat to generate additional electric power, an IGFC system is capable of operating at a high electric efficiency that significantly exceeds those associated with conventional pulverized coal and integrated gasification combined cycle power systems. IGFC efficiency margins considered achievable, based upon the U.S. Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory comparative studies of advanced power systems, are apparent in the table provided in subsequent discussion.Improvement in the IGFC cycle efficiency is possible by pressurized operation of the SOFCs, as depicted in the diagram of IGFC with pressurized SOFC cycle. The process is basically similar to the atmospheric-pressure cycle, but it would run the SOFC module at elevated pressure, achieving an SOFC <b>voltage</b> <b>boost,</b> and would replace the cathode-side process-air blower with an air compressor. Also, an expander/generator would be installed in the cathode off-gas stream to reduce gas pressures and generate additional power (this tends to drop the temperature of the gases so much that steam generation to run a steam turbine is not a viable option). Optionally, an expander/generator set could also be placed in the anode off-gas stream, just downstream of the oxy-combustor, and ahead of off-gas heat recovery.|$|E

In this part, a family of "Two-switch Boosting Switched-capacitor Converters (TBSC) " is introduced, which distinguishes itself from the prior arts by its symmetrical interleaved operation, reduced output ripple, low yet even voltage stress on components, and systematic expandability. Along with the topologies, a modeling technique based on charge-balance transient-calculation is formulated, which provokes the converter regulation method through duty cycle and frequency adjustment. The design guideline for high efficient TBSC is provided and regulation under high power condition is explored. In addition, an enhanced accurate modeling technique considering the output capacitor effect is developed for simple two-phase SC converters.
