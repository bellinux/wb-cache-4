5000|$|In {{secondary}} xylem - the xylem which is produced as a stem thickens rather {{than when it}} first appears - a <b>vessel</b> <b>element</b> originates from the vascular cambium. A long cell, oriented along the axis of the stem, called a [...] "fusiform initial", divides along its length forming new vessel elements. The cell wall of a <b>vessel</b> <b>element</b> becomes strongly [...] "lignified", i.e. it develops reinforcing material made of lignin. The side walls of a <b>vessel</b> <b>element</b> have pits: more or less circular regions in contact with neighbouring cells. Tracheids also have pits, but only vessel elements have openings at both ends that connect individual vessel elements to form a continuous tubular vessel. These end openings are called perforations or perforation plates. They {{have a variety of}} shapes: the most common are the simple perforation (a simple opening) and the scalariform perforation (several elongated openings in a ladder-like design). Other types include the foraminate perforation plate (several round openings) and the reticulate perforation plate (a net-like pattern, with many openings).|$|E
50|$|At {{maturity}} the protoplast - {{the living}} material {{of the cell}} - dies and disappears, but the lignified cell walls persist. A <b>vessel</b> <b>element</b> is then a dead cell, but one that still has a function, and is still being protected by surrounding living cells.|$|E
40|$|<b>Vessel</b> <b>elements</b> in Monocotyledons present {{morphological}} differences {{according to}} the organ where they occur. Usually such diff erences have been explained from an evolutionary perspective, with few data on how the <b>vessel</b> <b>elements</b> could be infl uenced by the diff erent functions of organs and the growth habits of the plants. To address this question, three vegetative organs of palms of the same genus, Syagrus, growing in similar environments, but with different habits, were analyzed. Accordingly, we aimed to detect whether the <b>vessel</b> <b>elements</b> would present similar features in all species or whether the <b>vessel</b> <b>elements</b> would change {{according to the}}ir different habits. We found that the width and type of perforation plates varied {{in the same way}} among all species, while the lengths varied in an unusual form. First, all species presented very long elements in the roots, either as long, or longer than those of the stems and leaves. Second, the <b>vessel</b> <b>elements</b> of the stems varied considerably among the species. Specifi cally, in Syagrus romanzoffi ana, <b>vessel</b> <b>elements</b> of the stem were equal in size to those of the other organs, while in both Syagrus fl exuosa and Syagrus petraea, shorter <b>vessel</b> <b>elements</b> were found in the stems. We surmise that <b>vessel</b> <b>elements</b> in palm roots {{may be related to the}} high pressure-potential required to avoid stem embolism. The dimorphism of the <b>vessel</b> <b>elements</b> in the stems most likely reflects the distinct habits of these species. Large stems, such as of those of the arboreal palms, presented much longer vessels than those of subterranean stems. Based on these anatomical findings, we suggest that the diff erences found among the <b>vessel</b> <b>elements</b> of roots, stem, and leaves may have evolved in response not only to phylogenetic and ecological constraints, but also to specificities derived from the different plant habits...|$|R
40|$|<b>Vessel</b> <b>elements</b> from macerations {{of roots}} and stems of Hanguana malayana were studied with {{scanning}} electron microscopy (SEM). <b>Vessel</b> <b>elements</b> are present in both stems and roots. The <b>vessel</b> <b>elements</b> of roots are slightly more specialized than those of stems in having greater differentiation of perforation plates from lateral wall areas. Long areas of transition between lateral wall areas and perforation plates, consisting of 10 or more pits (arguably perforations) with porose membranes or threadlike pit membrane remnants, characterize <b>vessel</b> <b>elements</b> of both stems and roots of Hanguana. Tracheids may be present, but cannot be identified with certainty. The <b>vessel</b> <b>elements</b> of Hanguana are like those of Acorus (Acoraceae) in primitiveness and {{are among the most}} primitive recorded for monocotyledons. These facts are consistent with placement of Hanguana in a monogeneric family, rather than in Flagellariaceae or any other family of monocotyledons...|$|R
50|$|The most {{distinctive}} xylem cells are the long tracheary elements that transport water. Tracheids and <b>vessel</b> <b>elements</b> are distinguished by their shape; <b>vessel</b> <b>elements</b> are shorter, and are connected together into long tubes that are called vessels.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>vessel</b> <b>element</b> or {{vessel member}} (trachea) {{is one of}} the cell types found in xylem, the water {{conducting}} tissue of plants. Vessel elements (tracheae) are typically found in flowering plants (angiosperms) but absent from most gymnosperms such as conifers. Vessel elements are the main feature distinguishing the [...] "hardwood" [...] of angiosperms from the [...] "softwood" [...] of conifers.|$|E
5000|$|In most plants, pitted tracheids {{function}} as the primary transport cells. The other type of tracheary element, besides the tracheid, is the <b>vessel</b> <b>element.</b> Vessel elements are joined by perforations into vessels. In vessels, water travels by bulk flow, as in a pipe, rather than by diffusion through cell membranes. The presence of vessels in xylem has been considered {{to be one of}} the key innovations that led to the success of the angiosperms. However, the occurrence of vessel elements is not restricted to angiosperms, and they are absent in some archaic or [...] "basal" [...] lineages of the angiosperms: (e.g., Amborellaceae, Tetracentraceae, Trochodendraceae, and Winteraceae), and their secondary xylem is described by Arthur Cronquist as [...] "primitively vesselless". Cronquist considered the vessels of Gnetum to be convergent with those of angiosperms. Whether the absence of vessels in basal angiosperms is a primitive condition is contested, the alternative hypothesis states that vessel elements originated in a precursor to the angiosperms and were subsequently lost.|$|E

The clone L 34 showed the significantly higher girth followed by G 3 and S 7 C 15. The variations were significant for girth, <b>vessel</b> <b>element</b> length and specific gravity between the wood produced from planting stocks grown by two techniques. Intra-clonal variations were significant for fiber length, fiber diameter and <b>vessel</b> <b>element</b> length. In general wood element’s dimensions and specific gravity increased from bottom to top and pith to periphery radial locations. G 3 clone was different from the L 34 and S 7 C 15 clone for the wood traits. The three different clones of Populus deltoides showed variability in wood anatomical properties and specific gravity in the woods grown from macro- and micro-propagated planting stock. So, the plantation raised by two techniques could not produce similar type of wood even from the same clone. G 3 clone was the exception as it did not show variation in wood traits for two techniques. Intra-clonal variations in all the three clones of P. deltoides indicated that wood traits were not stable within the population of same clone grown by either method...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Microfluidic chips {{have been}} widely used in various of areas, such as biology, chemistry, medical science and so on. As one of the key {{techniques}} of microfluidic chips, the technique of micro driven of the water has been studied by experts all around the world for years. Of all kinds of the driven methods, the power costed by bionic driven is lowest. Moreover, as xylem is the main channel to transport the water in a tree, the mechanism of water transportation has been always an important issue in the study of physiological plant ecology. In this paper, the models of a single <b>vessel</b> <b>element</b> with different pit numbers (5 pits, 10 pits and 20 pits) or diameters(4 µm and 7 µm) were established according to the xylem and the pits ’ structure. The 3 -dimensional flow distribution was analyzed by ANSYS 12. 0 calculating by realizable κ-ε algorithm. The pressure distribution contours and the velocity distribution contours of a single <b>vessel</b> <b>element</b> could be obtained after calculated by the software. According to the results, the flow field in a single <b>vessel</b> <b>element</b> of the xylem was studied. In addition, the influence of pits on the pressure and velocity were analyzed. The results showed that the influence on pressure and velocity is less when the diameter is smaller. As the number of pits on the vessel increased, the influence on the distribution of pressure and velocity is greater. Based on the result of numerical simulation of <b>vessel</b> <b>element,</b> a bionic structural microfluidic chip was designed and then analyzed by ANSYS 12. 0...|$|E

40|$|The Tracheary Element Differentiation-Related 6 (TED 6) and TED 7 {{membrane}} proteins {{function in}} the differentiation of xylem <b>vessel</b> <b>elements,</b> the cellular units for water conduction in angiosperm plants. Functional analysis of TED 6 and TED 7 had suggested that these proteins directly bind to a subunit of the secondary cell wall (SCW) -related cellulose synthase complex, to promote SCW formation in xylem <b>vessel</b> <b>elements.</b> However, whether TED 6 and TED 7 function in SCW formation of xylem <b>vessel</b> <b>elements</b> only, or function broadly in other cell types has remained unclear. To clarify this, we conducted detailed expression analysis of TED 6 and TED 7 genes in Arabidopsis thaliana.

Elementos de vasos em monocotiledôneas apresentam diferenças morfológicas de acordo com o órgão onde ocorrem. Tais diferenças têm sido explicadas sobretudo de um ponto de vista evolutivo, com poucos dados acerca de como a função de um órgão ou o hábito de crescimento de uma planta influenciariam na morfologia dos elementos de vaso. Para responder tal pergunta, foram analisados os órgãos vegetativos de três palmeiras do mesmo gênero, Syagrus, crescendo em ambientes similares, mas com hábitos diferentes. Assim, buscamos detectar se os elementos de vaso apresentariam características similares em todas as espécies ou se mudariam de acordo com os diferentes hábitos. Tanto a largura quanto o tipo de placa de perfuração variaram de maneira semelhante em todas as espécies, ao passo que os comprimentos variaram de uma forma inédita. Primeiramente, todas as espécies apresentaram elementos de vaso nas raízes tão ou mais longos que aqueles dos caules e folhas.

Especifi camente, em Syagrus romanzoffi ana os elementos de vaso apresentaram igual comprimento em todos os órgãos, enquanto tanto Syagrus fl exuosa quanto Syagrus petraea, vaso mais curtos foram encontrados nos caules. Provavelmente os elementos de vaso das raízes de palmeiras estão envolvidos na criação de altos potenciais hídricos necessários para evitar embolia no caule. O dimorfismo dos vasos no caule possivelmente reflete os hábitos diferentes destas espécies. Caules de maiores dimensões, como os de palmeiras arbóreas, apresentam elementos de vaso mais longos que aqueles de caules subterrâneos.

All cell types – fibres, <b>vessel</b> <b>elements</b> and axial parenchyma – derive from fusiform cambial cells which contain randomly oriented CMTs. At {{the early stages of}} development, fibres and axial parenchyma cells possess helically arranged CMTs, which increase in number as secondary wall thickening proceeds and simple pits develop. In contrast, incipient <b>vessel</b> <b>elements</b> are distinguished by the marking out of sites of bordered pits; these sites first appear as microtubule-free regions within the reticulum of randomly oriented CMTs that characterises their precursor fusiform cambial cells. Subsequently, the ring of CMTs which develops at the periphery of the microtubule-free region decreases in diameter as the over-arching pit border is formed. Like bordered pits, large-diameter, non-bordered pits (contact pits) which develop between <b>vessel</b> <b>elements</b> and adjacent contact ray cells originate as microtubule-free regions and are also associated with development of a ring of CMTs at the periphery. In the case of contact pits, however, there is no reduction in the diameter of the CMT ring during pit development. Tertiary cell wall thickenings are also a feature of <b>vessel</b> <b>elements</b> and appear to form at sites where bands of laterally associated, transversely oriented CMTs, separated from each other by microtubule-free zones, are found. Later, these bands of CMTs become narrower, and separate into pairs of microtubule bundles located {{on each side of the}} developing wall thickening. Development of perforations between <b>vessel</b> <b>elements</b> is also associated with the presence of a ring of CMTs at their periphery...|$|R
30|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that earlywood vessels develop in deciduous ring-porous hardwoods before bud break [7 – 14]. We confirmed that division of cambial cells and expansion of <b>vessel</b> <b>elements</b> along the entire stem began before bud break in Q. serrata and R. pseudoacacia. We reported recently that the combination of disbudding and localized heating of the dormant stems of seedlings of Q. serrata induced the earlier differentiation of <b>vessel</b> <b>elements</b> than that in non-heated stems [14]. Thus, the presence and development of buds are not essential for the start of differentiation of the current year’s first earlywood vessels.|$|R
50|$|Roots grow {{primarily}} from the same nodes as the leaves, but may also grow from other locations along the rhizome. The roots of Marsilea and Regnellidium are noteworthy for containing <b>vessel</b> <b>elements.</b> <b>Vessels</b> have also {{been found in the}} rhizome of two species of Marsilea. These vessels have evolved independently of vessels in other groups of plants.|$|R
