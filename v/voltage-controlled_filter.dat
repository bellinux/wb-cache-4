50|$|A <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>filter</b> (VCF) is a processor, {{a filter}} whose {{operating}} characteristics (primarily cutoff frequency) {{can be controlled}} {{by means of a}} control voltage applied to control inputs.

Although popularly known for their use in analog music synthesizers, in general, they have other applications in military and industrial electronics.|$|E
50|$|ARP Odysseys {{produced}} between 1972 and 1975, {{referred to}} as Mark I, were white-faced Odysseys that used a 2-pole <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>filter,</b> which were similar to Oberheim SEM modules. Some late models used a black and gold color scheme and include CV/gate jacks like the later Mark II's. These earlier units contained {{a greater number of}} internal adjustments and were slightly more difficult to calibrate.|$|E
50|$|The DCW of an {{oscillator}} is {{the magnitude}} of distortion that {{is applied to the}} reading angle of that oscillator's selected waveform. The DCW can be modified over time using an ADSR envelope, thus changing the timbre of the sound over time. In this capacity, it was described by Casio in the CZ-1's manual as being phase distortion synthesis's equivalent of the VCF (<b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>filter)</b> in analogue synthesisers.|$|E
5000|$|Early analog synthesizers used {{technology}} from electronic analog computers and laboratory test equipment. They were generally [...] "modular" [...] synthesizers, {{consisting of a}} number of independent electronic modules connected by patch cables into a patchbay that resembled the jackfields used by 1940s-era telephone operators. Synthesizer modules in early analog synthesizers included voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs), <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>filters</b> (VCFs), and <b>voltage-controlled</b> amplifiers (VCAs). The control voltage varied frequency in VCOs and VCFs, and attenuation (gain) in VCAs. Additionally, they used envelope generators, low-frequency oscillators, and ring modulators.Some synthesizers also had effects devices, such as reverb units, or tools such as sequencers or sound mixers. Because many of these modules took input sound signals and processed them, an analog synthesizer could be used both as a sound-generating and sound-processing system.|$|R

50|$|The Roland MC-505 is a groovebox {{conceived}} in 1998 {{as a combination}} of a MIDI controller, a music sequencer and a drum machine, and also has some of the prime features of synthesizers: arpeggiator, oscillators, <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>filter,</b> control of attack, decay, sustain and release. It was released as the successor to the Roland MC-303 and is a compact version of the Roland JX-305 Groovesynth without the full set of 61 keys. It is also the predecessor to the Roland D2, Roland MC-307, Roland MC-909 and the Roland MC-808.|$|E
5000|$|Solo Melody: {{this section}} {{is very close}} to a {{traditional}} analog monophonic synthesizer. Using the same proprietary Roland [...] "fundamental generator" [...] chip, the possible waveforms include 16' pulse, 8' pulse, and sawtooth waveform. The -24 dB per octave <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>filter</b> is self-oscillating, with string-pitch tracking. In addition to the same ADS Envelope Generator found in the Polyensemble and Bass, there is a triangle wave LFO to modulate pulse width or the filter cutoff. The filter {{can also be used to}} process the output of the polyensemble section, and an external input.|$|E
50|$|Using this approach, Moog built a {{range of}} signal-generating, signal-modifying and {{controller}} modules, each {{of which could be}} easily inter-connected to control or modify the functions and outputs of any other. The central component was the voltage-controlled oscillator, which generated the primary sound signal, capable of producing a variety of waveforms including sawtooth, square and sine waves. The output from the VCO could then be modified and shaped by feeding the signal into other modules such as <b>voltage-controlled</b> amplifiers, <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>filters,</b> envelope generators, and ring modulators. Another customization as part of the Moog Modular Synthesizer is the sequencer, which provided a source of timed step control voltages that were programmed to create repetitive note patterns, without using the keyboard. The inputs and outputs of any module could be cross-linked with patch cords (using tip-sleeve ("mono") Â¼-inch plugs) and, together with the module control knobs and switches, could create a nearly infinite variety of sounds and effects.|$|R
40|$|The use of analog CMOS {{circuits}} at {{high frequency}} has gained much {{attention in the}} last several years. At the heart of rapid prototyping of these circuits is the concept of using a versatile library of common RF function blocks. The blocks (cells) must be designed to be flexible in terms of drive requirements and loading. This paper presents the results of on-going research in development of phase-synchronizer as common RF function block, used in frequency and phase modulation, frequency synthesis, clock generation recovery, filtering, etc. The proposed circuit is based on series of <b>voltage-controlled</b> all-pass <b>filter</b> as delay chain, and enables phase regulation of analog input signals in wide range. Other characteristics of the input signal, such as amplitude and waveform are not deteriorated. The gm-C <b>voltage-controlled</b> all-pass <b>filter</b> is crucial block of the proposal.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} polarization-resolved photoluminescence under applied voltage in p-i-p GaAs/AlAs double-barrier diodes. We have observed oscillations {{in the degree}} of polarization up to 36 % at B= 15 T with sign reversals occurring near to the hole subband resonances. At high voltages a polarization saturation up to 25 % at B= 15 T is observed. The data are interpreted by using simulations based on a simple theoretical model that considers spin conservation for tunneling and the relaxation processes for carriers at Zeeman states in the quantum well.

5000|$|A four-way {{joystick}} {{was provided}} to control low-frequency oscillation (LFO) modulation as well as pitch bending. Pulling the joystick bender towards you also allowed control over <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>filter</b> (VCF) as well. Around the back panel are jacks for headphones, stereo line out (to plug into a keyboard amplifier, PA system, mixing board, etc.), pedal inputs for damper, portamento and [...] "program up" [...] are provided. Also available are two sockets for tape recorder interface to facilitate offline patch backup and storage of sounds and other data.

5000|$|The <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>filter</b> (VCF) and voltage-controlled {{amplifier}} (VCA) each {{have their own}} ADSD envelope generator (or Attack-Decay-Sustain-Decay). Musicians {{who are familiar with}} more modern synthesizers might expect the last letter to be R for [...] "Release" [...] (as in ADSR). However, on the Minimoog, the envelopes are ADSD, as the decay setting also sets the time for what is regularly known as release. In other words, there are three knobs to control 4 sections of the sound (most modern synths have four knobs, one for each section) [...] - [...] a [...] "shortcoming" [...] that doesn't seem to diminish the Minimoog's popularity in any way. There is also a switch above the pitch and modulation wheels to engage the final decay stage as well as a switch for engaging the glide circuit.|$|E

25|$|RO is {{a simple}} and {{convenient}} tool for tuning the frequency of oscillators, filters and amplifiers in analog synthesizers. Particularly simple is their implementation in the <b>voltage-controlled</b> RC <b>filters</b> in a Sallen-Key topology, where the RO provides a nearly exponential dependence of the cutoff frequency on the controlling current, without using feedback by the modulation signal. However, due to the slow response of ROs, most synthesizer developers of the 1970s and 1980s, such as ARP, Korg, Moog and Roland, preferred other elements. As of August 2013 RO-based synthesizers are produced by Doepfer (Germany). A still popular use for ROs are Lowpass Gates like the 292 by Buchla Electronic Musical Instruments or the Makenoise MMG.|$|R
40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{investigate the}} spin-dependent transport properties of electrons in realistic magnetic-electric barrier nanostructures, which {{are produced by}} the deposition, {{on top of a}} heterostructure, of a metallic ferromagnetic stripe with an applied voltage. The degree of the electron-spin polarization is found to be closely associated with this voltage, although the use of applied voltage itself induces no spin polarization effect. As a positive voltage is applied to the stripe the electron-spin polarization shifts towards the low-energy region and increases; it shifts towards the high-energy direction and reduces for a negative applied voltage. These results shown in this work imply that the degree of electron-spin polarization can be tuned by means of an applied voltage on the stripes of system, which may result in a practical <b>voltage-controlled</b> spin <b>filter.</b> Magnetic-electric barrier, spin filtering, spintronics, spin polarization, 73. 40.

5000|$|While {{the earlier}} Polymoog {{synthesizer}} (1975) featured unlimited polyphony, the 6-voice Memorymoog is considered sonically superior, {{and is often}} described architecturally as six Minimoogs in one unit. Each of the six voices of the Memorymoog {{is made up of}} 3 voltage-controlled oscillators that can be set to any combination of pulse (variable width), saw, and triangle waveforms and freely switched over a 4-octave initial range. Each voice also has its own 24 dB/Octave Low Pass <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>filter.</b> Moog Music wisely included a discrete implementation of its famed, patented transistor ladder filter, which was first introduced in the Moog Modular systems of the 1960s and subsequently came into widespread prominence in the Minimoog. In Mono mode, the Memorymoog functions as a traditional monophonic synthesizer with 1-18 oscillators selectable in unison for powerful leads and basslines. The user may also specify any combination of Low-, Latest- or High-Note Priority keying and Single or Multiple Triggering, for an impressive degree of control. A Chord Memory function (for single key, parallel chord [...] "planing" [...] effects) and an Arpeggiator are also included, while an independent LFO with 5 non-mixable waveforms allows simultaneous modulation of each VCO frequency, oscillator pulse width and filter cutoff frequency in any combination. Further, VCO-3 can also be used as a Low- or Audio-Frequency modulation source. With careful programming, audio frequency modulation using Oscillator 3 can produce convincing pseudo acoustic and FM-like timbres typically not associated with analog subtractive synthesis.|$|E
5000|$|The {{synthesizer}} {{voices are}} based on the Curtis Electronics CEM 3394 chip. This allows for one voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) per voice, with on/off toggles for any combination of sawtooth, triangle and variable pulse waveforms. There are coarse (up to 4 octaves) and fine (to just under a semitone) tuning parameters. A [...] "poly mod" [...] parameter allows the audio output of one voice to feed another's <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>filter</b> (VCF) when they are layered in [...] "double" [...] mode. This results in a sound with 4-voice polyphony with no audio from the second voice's oscillators, processed through two filters in series. The single low-frequency oscillator (LFO) is free-running (i.e. doesn't restart when a key is depressed), with programmable rate (0.25 to 20 Hz according to the manual), and has programmable depth and waveform (triangle or square). This can modulate any combination of filter cutoff frequency, pitch, or oscillator pulse-width. There is a chorus with fixed rate and frequency. Filter cutoff frequency, resonance (to self-oscillation), keyboard tracking (off, half or full) and envelope amount can be programmed, but the envelope cannot be inverted. The two ADSR envelopes modulate the VCA and the 24 dB/octave VCF. The rate for the polyphonic portamento is programmable. [...] "Unison" [...] (monophonic mode) can be programmed for each patch. In this mode, the envelopes are re-triggered only after all keys are released ("legato", with low-note priority), and a delay of four oscillators relative to the other four can be programmed (fixed at 20, 40 or 80 milliseconds). A program can be [...] "linked" [...] to another so that both are called up and assigned correctly in a split or layer. There is also a programmable output level for each patch to help balance loud and soft sounds.|$|E
50|$|Features include four voltage-controlled {{oscillators}} (VCOs) with tuning, footage (16, 8, 4, 2), waveshape (triangle, saw, pulse-width, and pulse-width modulated), and amplitude. The first oscillator is {{the master}} oscillator as far as fine tuning goes. Two direct modifiers to the VCOs are a detune control that only affects oscillators 2 and 4, and a Pulse Width control that goes to cancellation either side of 50% phase symmetry of a square wave; pulse width can be routed to MG1, MG2, or <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>filter</b> (VCF) envelope. There is one independent noise generator with an amplitude control (frequency and shape is modified by the VCF). There is one 24/db octave exponential low-pass VCF with resonance, scaling and invertible envelope control shared across all four VCOs. One voltage-controlled amplifier (VCA) envelope with triggering and dampering controls is shared across all four VCOs. There are two low frequency modulators: MG1 controls VCO Pitch/Pulse-width, 'EFFECTS' and VCF cutoff; MG2 controls the tempo of the arpeggiator, and Pulse-Width. There is one arpeggiator with on/off/latch control, up/down/up-down pitch control, and 1/2/full keyboard control (44 notes). The arpeggiator can cycle through each oscillator in POLY mode, or all four {{at a time in}} MONO. There is an 'EFFECTS' section which includes an amplitude modulator (X-MOD) with hard-sync control, and a frequency modulator with which the frequency of the modulator can be altered by the VCF envelope or MG1. For both modulators there is the option of single modulation of all oscillators, or two carriers, and two modulators (using the VCOs). Controller Interfaces are external inputs/outputs for CV/Trigger, VCF and VCO mod inputs, arpeggiator, portamento, and the pitch/MG1 mod wheels can be assigned to control VCO1 pitch, pitch or the filter. Bender goes to 2.5 octaves +/- for Pitch and full range for VCF cutoff. There are 5 different oscillator assignment modes: 'Hold' drones the oscillators until force dampered or Chord Memory is activated; 'Chord Memory (MONO)' allows 2-4 oscillators (VCOs) to be set to any arrangement across 44 keys (for example, in organ or rave chords); 'Unison (MONO)' stacks all 4 oscillators; and 'Unison/Share', which defaults to Unison with one note played, but divides the oscillators across the notes as 2 or more are played. Poly is without explanation, and oscillators always play in sequenced order from 1-4.|$|E

50|$|Most SD synthesizers use {{a single}} DCO (plus a digital noise {{generator}} for certain waveforms) per voice, and offer 32 possible waveforms. The top-of-the-line Casio HT-6000 offered 64 possible waveforms, 4 DCO's per voice, velocity, detuning, ring-modulation, and an expanded SD parameter set.

Finally, like on the CZ's, a low-frequency oscillator (LFO) is programmable to modulate the DCO pitch, but unfortunately it cannot modulate the VCF or DCA. Nearly all of the SD synth parameters had 5-bit precision, allowing a stepwise range of 0-31.|$|R
