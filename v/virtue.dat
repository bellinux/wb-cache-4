5|$|As in the Vindication of the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft {{does not}} {{highlight}} {{the differences between}} men and women as much as she emphasizes the importance of <b>virtue</b> in Original Stories. Moreover, she defines <b>virtue</b> in such a way that it applies to both sexes. Traditionally, as Kelly explains, <b>virtue</b> was tied to femininity and chastity, but Wollstonecraft’s text rejects this definition and argues instead that <b>virtue</b> should be characterized by reason and self-control. Myers has also pointed out that Mrs. Mason’s desire to instill rationality in her charges is potentially liberating for women readers and their daughters as such a pedagogy was in direct contrast to much that was being written at the time by conduct book writers such as James Fordyce and John Gregory and philosophers such as Rousseau, who asserted the intellectual weakness of women and the secondary status of their gender.|$|E
5|$|Hope is {{traditionally}} considered by Christians as a theological <b>virtue</b> (a <b>virtue</b> {{associated with the}} grace of God, rather than with work or self-improvement). Since antiquity artistic representations of the personification depict her as a young woman, typically holding a flower or an anchor.|$|E
5|$|In his Critique of Pure Reason, German philosopher Immanuel Kant {{stated that}} no {{successful}} argument for God's existence arises from reason alone. In his Critique of Practical Reason {{he went on}} to argue that, despite the failure of these arguments, morality requires that God's existence is assumed, owing to practical reason. Rather than proving the existence of God, Kant was attempting to demonstrate that all moral thought requires the assumption that God exists. Kant argued that humans are obliged to bring about the summum bonum: the two central aims of moral <b>virtue</b> and happiness, where happiness arises out of <b>virtue.</b> As ought implies can, Kant argued, it must be possible for the summum bonum to be achieved. He accepted that it is not within the power of humans to bring the summum bonum about, because we cannot ensure that <b>virtue</b> always leads to happiness, so there must be a higher power who has the power to create an afterlife where <b>virtue</b> can be rewarded by happiness.|$|E
50|$|The seven Christian <b>virtues</b> {{are from}} {{two sets of}} <b>virtues.</b> The four {{cardinal}} <b>virtues</b> are Prudence, Justice, Restraint (or Temperance), and Courage (or Fortitude). The cardinal <b>virtues</b> are so called because they are regarded as the basic <b>virtues</b> required for a virtuous life. The three theological <b>virtues,</b> are Faith, Hope, and Love (or Charity).|$|R
50|$|The <b>virtues</b> {{then are}} {{similarly}} divided, into intellectual (dianoetic) <b>virtues,</b> and the <b>virtues</b> of character (ethical or moral <b>virtues)</b> {{pertaining to the}} irrational part of the soul, which can take part in reason.|$|R
50|$|Aquinas further {{connected}} the theological <b>virtues</b> with the cardinal <b>virtues.</b> He views the supernatural inclinations of the theological <b>virtues,</b> caused by habitual grace, {{to find their}} fulfillment in being acted upon in the cardinal <b>virtues.</b>|$|R
5|$|In his {{combined}} works, Kant {{constructed the}} basis for an ethical law from the concept of duty. Kant began his ethical theory by arguing that the only <b>virtue</b> that can be unqualifiedly good is a good will. No other <b>virtue</b> has this status because every other <b>virtue</b> {{can be used to}} achieve immoral ends (the <b>virtue</b> of loyalty is not good if one is loyal to an evil person, for example). The good will is unique in that it is always good and maintains its moral value even when it fails to achieve its moral intentions. Kant regarded the good will as a single moral principle which freely chooses to use the other virtues for moral ends.|$|E

50|$|Regarding virtues: a truly {{scientific}} ethic should {{promote the}} private <b>virtues</b> of prudence, temperance, and industry (the only <b>virtues</b> Moore discusses in Principia), not the (so-called) <b>virtues</b> of beneficence, charity, civic-mindedness, social justice, patriotism, piety, reverence, or altruism. Such an ethic should promote the <b>virtues</b> {{of the creative}} self, not the <b>virtues</b> of the conscientious citizen.|$|R
60|$|The real {{difference}} between Paganism and Christianity is perfectly {{summed up in}} {{the difference between the}} pagan, or natural, <b>virtues,</b> and those three <b>virtues</b> of Christianity which the Church of Rome calls <b>virtues</b> of grace. The pagan, or rational, <b>virtues</b> are such things as justice and temperance, and Christianity has adopted them. The three mystical <b>virtues</b> which Christianity has not adopted, but invented, are faith, hope, and charity. Now much easy and foolish Christian rhetoric could easily be poured out upon those three words, but I desire to confine myself to the two facts which are evident about them. The first evident fact (in marked contrast to the delusion of the dancing pagan)--the first evident fact, I say, is that the pagan <b>virtues,</b> such as justice and temperance, are the sad <b>virtues,</b> and that the mystical <b>virtues</b> of faith, hope, and charity are the gay and exuberant <b>virtues.</b> And the second evident fact, which is even more evident, {{is the fact that the}} pagan <b>virtues</b> are the reasonable <b>virtues,</b> and that the Christian <b>virtues</b> of faith, hope, and charity are in their essence as unreasonable as they can be.|$|R
50|$|The four classic {{cardinal}} <b>virtues</b> are temperance, prudence, courage, and justice. Christianity derives {{the three}} theological <b>virtues</b> of faith, hope and love (charity) from 1 Corinthians. Together these {{make up the}} seven <b>virtues.</b> Buddhism's four brahmavihara ("Divine States") {{can be regarded as}} <b>virtues</b> in the European sense. The Japanese Bushidō code is characterized by up to ten <b>virtues,</b> including rectitude, courage, and benevolence.|$|R

Tyball agrees, but the betrayal fails; Garamon is killed, but seals the demon inside the room. Because he lacks <b>virtue,</b> Tyball cannot re-enter by himself, and plans to sacrifice Baron Almric's daughter, Arial, at the doorway to gain entrance.|$|E

50|$|The moral <b>virtues</b> are {{acquired}} by practice and habit. Catholic moral theology {{holds that the}} theological <b>virtues</b> differ from the cardinal <b>virtues</b> in that they cannot be obtained by human effort, but are infused by God into a person. Like the cardinal <b>virtues,</b> an individual who exercises these <b>virtues</b> strengthens and increases them, i.e., they are more disposed to practice them.|$|R

5|$|In {{contemporary}} times, Either/Or received {{new life}} as a grand philosophical work {{with the publication of}} Alasdair MacIntyre's After <b>Virtue</b> (1981), where MacIntyre situates Either/Or as an attempt to capture the Enlightenment spirit set forth by David Hume and Immanuel Kant. After <b>Virtue</b> renewed Either/Or as an important ethical text in the Kantian vein, as mentioned previously. Although MacIntyre accuses Victor Eremita of failing to provide a criterion for one to adopt an ethical way of life, many scholars have since replied to MacIntyre's accusation in Kierkegaard After MacIntyre.|$|E
50|$|Civic <b>virtues</b> were {{especially}} important during the 19th and 20th century.

For the 15 <b>virtues</b> ratings, a MANOVA, and follow-up ANOVA’s were used to examine effects of nation, age, gender and religion. We found strong evidence for relationships between nations and blocks of culturally related nations and the importance attached to various <b>virtues.</b> There appear to be some country specific <b>virtues,</b> such as generosity in France, but also some relatively universal <b>virtues,</b> most notably honesty, respect, and kindness.|$|R

Among those philosophies which Russell condemns as rooted in love of power: all forms of idealism and anti-realism, such as Johann Gottlieb Fichte's solipsism; certain forms of Pragmatism; Henri Bergson's doctrine of Creative evolution; and the works of Friedrich Nietzsche (Russell 1938:209–214).|$|E
