50|$|The {{objective}} of <b>video</b> <b>tracking</b> is to associate target objects in consecutive video frames. The association {{can be especially}} difficult when the objects are moving fast relative to the frame rate. Another situation that increases {{the complexity of the}} problem is when the tracked object changes orientation over time. For these situations <b>video</b> <b>tracking</b> systems usually employ a motion model which describes how the image of the target might change for different possible motions of the object.|$|E

50|$|<b>Video</b> <b>tracking</b> is {{the process}} of {{locating}} a moving object (or multiple objects) over time using a camera. It has a variety of uses, some of which are: human-computer interaction, security and surveillance, video communication and compression, augmented reality, traffic control, medical imaging and video editing. <b>Video</b> <b>tracking</b> can be a time consuming process due to the amount of data that is contained in video. Adding further to the complexity is the possible need to use object recognition techniques for tracking, a challenging problem in its own right.|$|E

50|$|Computer-assisted <b>video</b> <b>tracking</b> {{technology}} has improved {{to the point}} that it can determine the position of a ball at impact with a margin of error less than five millimeters.Accordingly, starting with the NASDAQ-100 Open in March 2006, most top-level tournaments allow systems such as Hawk-Eye to be used to settle disputed line calls.|$|E
50|$|Corner {{detection}} is {{an approach}} used within computer vision systems to extract {{certain kinds of}} features and infer the contents of an image. Corner detection is frequently used in motion detection, image registration, <b>video</b> <b>tracking,</b> image mosaicing, panorama stitching, 3D modelling and object recognition. Corner detection overlaps with the topic of interest point detection.|$|E
50|$|The {{motion of}} the vehicle {{presents}} another special challenge. Underwater vehicles are constantly moving due to currents and other phenomena. This introduces another uncertainty to algorithms, where small motions may appear in all directions. This can be specially important for <b>video</b> <b>tracking.</b> In order to reduce this problem image stabilization algorithms may be applied.|$|E
