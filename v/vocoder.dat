5|$|Months later, André 3000 {{worked with}} Pete Novak at the Larrabee Sound Studios in Los Angeles. André improvised the lyrics {{based on a}} {{screenplay}} he had written. They experimented with various sound effects, including singing through a <b>vocoder,</b> and did 30 to 40 takes for each line.|$|E
5|$|Tenebraes {{score is}} very {{different}} to those the band had produced for Argento previously. The early 1980s had seen Simonetti experimenting with dance music, and he decided on a more electronic sound for Tenebrae. Simonetti described the score as an electronica/rock hybrid, with the main theme including disco elements. So {{it would not be}} difficult to accommodate Argento's preference for long takes, Simonetti, Pignatelli and Morante made sure to play each song for 3–4 minutes. Recording the score, Simonetti used the Roland Jupiter-8, Roland <b>Vocoder</b> Plus and Minimoog synthesizers, as well as a piano, electric piano, the Oberheim DMX digital drum, a Roland TR-808 drum machine, and Roland MC-4 music sequencer. Pignatelli played bass and fretless guitar, while Morante played electric and acoustic guitar.|$|E
25|$|Cynic's 2008 album Traced in Air melded {{together}} the styles and influences heard on 1993's Focus {{with the more}} progressive-oriented Portal approach. The result had Cynic put less emphasis on its extreme metal elements, with new guttural vocalist Tymon Kruidenier playing a smaller role than Tony Teegarden did on Focus. Additionally, Paul Masvidal all but abandoned his <b>vocoder</b> robotic vocals, opting instead for a more natural singing voice, with a subtler —although noticeable— <b>vocoder</b> layer that increases an octave his voice.|$|E
25|$|A <b>vocoder,</b> a {{portmanteau}} of {{the words}} voice and encoder, is an analysis and synthesis system, mostly used for speech. In the encoder, the input is passed through a multiband filter, each band is passed through an envelope follower, and the control signals from the envelope followers are communicated to the decoder. The decoder applies these control signals to corresponding filters in the (re)synthesizer. Research physicist Homer Dudley invented the <b>Vocoder</b> at Bell Labs in 1939 which served the purpose of improving the voice-carrying capabilities of his employer's telephone lines.|$|E
25|$|Yandel's {{voice was}} {{recorded}} using two Neve 1073 preamplifiers, a <b>Vocoder</b> Korg voice codec, a Solid-State Channel Strip preamplifier, The Mouth software by Native Instruments and Melodyne software. As {{well as on}} his previous studio album, his voice was multitracked on all songs and also has some delays.|$|E
25|$|Other {{controllers}} include theremin, lightbeam controllers, touch buttons (touche d’intensité) on the ondes Martenot, {{and various}} types of foot pedals. Envelope following systems, the most sophisticated being the <b>vocoder,</b> are controlled by the power or amplitude of input audio signal. A musician uses the talk box to manipulate sound using the vocal tract, though it is rarely categorized as a synthesizer.|$|E
25|$|According to member Cheryl, Tangled Up {{emphasizes}} a {{more mature}} nature than their previous efforts. Musically, {{the record is}} a pop album that incorporates elements of dance-pop, synthpop, and various EDM sub-genres. Lyrically, it delves into themes of love, relationships and femininity. Majority of the numbers consists of synthesizers, drum machines, electric and acoustic guitars, and keyboards, whilst it was the group's first experimentation with tools such as autotune and <b>vocoder.</b>|$|E
25|$|With Ralf und Florian, {{released}} in 1973, Kraftwerk {{began to move}} closer to its now classic sound, relying more heavily on synthesizers and drum machines. Although almost entirely instrumental, the album marks Kraftwerk's first use of the <b>vocoder,</b> which would in time become one of its musical signatures. Kraftwerk's futuristic and robotic sound {{was influenced by the}} 'adrenalized insurgency' of Detroit artists of the late '60s such as MC5 and the Stooges.|$|E
25|$|Recording {{took place}} from mid-1983 to mid-1984 at the band's Yello Studio {{on the shore}} of Lake Zurich. Blank had {{purchased}} two new synthesizers in 1983, a Yamaha DX7 and a Roland JX-3P, but the album was mostly written and created using the equipment he already owned, a Fairlight CMI Series II sampler along with an ARP Odyssey synthesizer, the Linn LM-1 and Oberheim DMX drum machines, a Roland VP-330 <b>Vocoder</b> Plus, a Lexicon Hall reverb unit and a Framus guitar.|$|E
25|$|The year 1975 saw {{a turning}} point in Kraftwerk's live shows. With {{financial}} support from Phonogram Inc., in the US, they were able to undertake a multi-date tour to promote the Autobahn album, a tour which took them to the US, Canada and the UK for the first time. The tour also saw a new, stable, live line-up {{in the form of a}} quartet. Hütter and Schneider continued playing keyboard synthesizers such as the Minimoog and ARP Odyssey, with Schneider's use of flute diminishing. The pair also started singing live for the first time, Schneider processing his voice with a <b>vocoder</b> live. Wolfgang Flür and new recruit Karl Bartos performed on self-built electronic percussion instruments. Bartos also used a Deagan vibraphone on stage. The Hütter-Schneider-Bartos-Flür formation remained in place until the late 1980s and is now regarded as the classic live line-up of Kraftwerk. Emil Schult generally fulfilled the role of tour manager.|$|E

500|$|... "Within" [...] {{was one of}} {{the first}} tracks to be {{recorded}} for the album. It features Gonzales on piano with minimal accompaniment consisting of bass and a percussion track, as well as <b>vocoder.</b> In the context of the album, [...] "Within" [...] marks the transition from the key of A minor of the previous three songs, to the key of B-flat minor of subsequent tracks. Regarding the lyrics, critic Nick Stevenson observed, [...] "A deep <b>vocoder</b> sings about not understanding the world, being lost and not even remembering his own name." [...] Jeremy Abbott of Mixmag added, [...] "So many things I don't understand is the prominent lyric and Chilly's chords combined with grazing cymbals make for a beautiful summer lullaby." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I Love You" [...] is an electropop {{new wave}} song. Downes {{is also a}} vocalist on the track, which he sings through a <b>vocoder.</b> He said that [...] "I Love You" [...] was really about [...] "being {{on the road and}} making love to someone you don't really like, while all the time you're wanting to phone someone who's a long way off." ...|$|E
500|$|Various {{sound effects}} were newly {{recorded}} {{with the help}} of film experts from Warner Bros. Bangalter noted one example in which the sound of a busy restaurant was achieved by placing microphones in front of the forks of a group of people. In another instance, the effect of dripping water was recorded on a soundstage. Use of electronics was limited to drum machines that appear on only two tracks, a large custom-built Modcan modular synthesizer performed live by the duo, and vintage vocoders. When asked which of the two Daft Punk members performed the robotic vocals on the album, Bangalter expressed that it did not matter. The duo produced most of the <b>vocoder</b> tracks in their own private studio in Paris, with later processing done by Mick Guzauski at Capitol. Moroder elaborated that Daft Punk would take [...] "a week or so" [...] to find an adequate <b>vocoder</b> sound, and an additional few days to record the lyrics.|$|E
500|$|... "Nobody Knows Me" [...] has <b>vocoder</b> effects, spacey synths, bubbly bass. IGN Music's Spencer D. {{described}} {{that the}} song blips, glurgs, and shuffles with a Jetsons' styled disco {{ebb and flow}} and sounds like as an outtake from Music (2000). It begins with <b>vocoder</b> treated vocals over a bleeping synth, on a minor chord. Heavy drum hits stress the melody during the verse. [...] "Nobody Knows Me" [...] is written in common time with a moderately fast tempo of 120 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of C major with Madonna's voice spanning from B3 to C5. The song follows a basic sequence of C–Am–D–Am–A–E as its chord progression. Lyrically, she rejects tabloid culture's [...] "social disease", denouncing both TV and magazines. The chorus features repeated echo shifts of [...] "nobody knows me" [...] while she ponders thoughts like, [...] "It's no good when you're misunderstood, but why should I care what the world thinks of me?". O'Brien {{described it as a}} trancey track with a sense of childlike defiant lyrics, dismissing critics who have no knowledge of her [...] "jealously guarded inner self".|$|E
500|$|... "Taboo" [...] (capitalized as [...] "TABOO") {{is a song}} by Japanese {{recording}} artist Kumi Koda, taken from her seventh studio album Trick (2009). It was written by Koda, and co-written and produced by Hiro. [...] "Taboo" [...] is a dance-pop song that lyrically discusses several taboo subjects including sex and homosexuality. It contains numerous elements including electropop and hip-hop, and employs use of <b>vocoder.</b> It was released as the second single from the album on October 8, 2008 by Rhythm Zone.|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "Free Free" [...] is the {{creation}} of a newly founded genre by Nakata titled Eropop, which he generated by combining 1980s pop, house and disco music; furthermore, the single also incorporates influences of contemporary EDM. The lyrical content is based on the theme of freedom and having fun. With that said, erotica is another factor that inspired the tracks lyrics and Suzuki's image for the track. Backed by synthesizers and keyboards, it is Suzuki's first English language recording and her vocals are processed through pro-tools such as autotune and <b>vocoder.</b>|$|E
500|$|... "Juxtapozed with U" [...] is 3 minutes 8 seconds {{long and}} is in the key of A major. The track begins with a drum fill, {{featuring}} flanging, before a harp, strings, acoustic guitar and bass join at 2 seconds. An electric guitar joins at 13 seconds playing a melody line. The song breaks down at 25 seconds for the first verse with just bass, drums, acoustic guitar and occasional synthesizer accompanying Gruff Rhys's vocals which are fed through a <b>vocoder.</b> The first chorus begins at 47 seconds with the strings and harp re-entering while Rhys sings the words [...] "You've got to tolerate all those people that you hate, I'm not in love with you but I won't hold that against you" [...] twice without the use of a <b>vocoder.</b> The song breaks down again for the second verse after which the second chorus enters at 1 minute 33 seconds. The outro begins at 1 minute 58 seconds with Rhys singing [...] "Let's get juxtaposed, juxtaposed, just suppose I'm juxtaposed with you" [...] supported by harmony backing vocals. The rest of the band continue singing these words while Rhys begins singing the chorus lyrics, starting at 2 minutes 43 seconds. The track ends with Rhys singing the words [...] "Let's get juxtaposed" [...] backed only by harmony vocals.|$|E
500|$|... "All Night Long" [...] was {{recorded}} in mid 1998 by Komuro in Tokyo, Japan. [...] "All Night Long" [...] {{was described as a}} drum and bass song with numerous musical elements, including pop music and Japanese pop. Throughout the choruses of the song, Suzuki's vocals are processed with minor <b>vocoder</b> effects. In December 2011, [...] "All Night Long" [...] was one of eight tracks from her compilation album Ami Selection to be re-produced, re-composed, and re-recorded. Komuro was in charge of re-produced, re-arranging, and re-composing the track; the re-worked track is a dance-pop song with the same elements of drum and bass and Japanese pop.|$|E
500|$|... "Nobody Knows Me" [...] {{is a song}} by American singer-songwriter Madonna. The {{song was}} written and {{produced}} by Madonna and Mirwais Ahmadzaï for her ninth studio album American Life (2003). It was released as a promotional single in the United States on October 15, 2003, with a remixed version appearing on the remix compilation Remixed & Revisited (2003). [...] "Nobody Knows Me" [...] carries on the main theme of American Life, with its usage of negative tones on the songs. It is a dance and electronic song, with <b>vocoder</b> effects, spacey synths and a bubbly bass, and lyrically, Madonna rejects tabloid culture's [...] "social disease", denouncing both TV and magazines.|$|E
500|$|Fraser McAplpine from BBC Music {{has claimed}} that the song's chorus can be likened to Eiffel 65's [...] "Blue (Da Ba Dee)" [...] (1999). According to digital music sheet {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "Disturbia" [...] is composed in a key of B minor and is set in common time with a moderate techno-pop groove. Rihanna's vocal range spans from the lower note of D3 to the high note of E5 and the track follows a chord progression of Bm-D-A-G in the verses and chorus. The song features various vocal effects, namely the use of Auto-Tune and a <b>vocoder</b> {{in contrast with the}} detached electronic bounce of the song and its weaving, winding melody.|$|E
500|$|Hal's {{version of}} the popular song [...] "Daisy Bell" [...] (referred to by Hal as [...] "Daisy" [...] in the film) was {{inspired}} by a computer-synthesized arrangement by Max Mathews, which Arthur C. Clarke had heard in 1962 at the Bell Laboratories Murray Hill facility when he was, coincidentally, visiting friend and colleague John R. Pierce. At that time, a speech synthesis demonstration was being performed by physicist John Larry Kelly, Jr., by using an IBM 704 computer to synthesize speech. Kelly's voice recorder synthesizer <b>vocoder</b> recreated the song [...] "Daisy Bell" [...] ("Bicycle Built For Two"); Max Mathews provided the musical accompaniment. Arthur C. Clarke was so impressed that he later used it in the screenplay and novel.|$|E
500|$|In a {{separate}} publishing from The New York Times, David Browne criticized the song's overuse of processed vocals, writing that: [...] "As heard on her current single 'We R Who We R' {{from her new}} mini-album, 'Cannibal,' Kesha has a thin, often computer-manipulated voice that recalls ’80s new-wave pop acts. It’s often hard to tell when her singing voice ends and the <b>Vocoder</b> processing kicks in." [...] Rolling Stone gave the song {{two and a half}} stars out of five, referring to the combination of Kesha's style and the song's themes as an [...] "awkward fit". However, Rolling Stone later placed the song at number 50 in its Best 50 Singles of 2010 list.|$|E
500|$|Christopher Weingarten of The Village Voice {{compared}} the album to Radiohead's third studio album, OK Computer, describing the record's composition as [...] "uninhibited hooks, daffy left turns, piano-soaked bathos, explorations {{of the human}} relationship with technology, [...] a complete avoidance of metal". Weingarten noted various elements and styles the band incorporated in A Thousand Suns, saying the band was [...] "sink their distortion pedals into a tender oblivion, embracing the pulseless <b>Vocoder</b> syrup of Imogen Heap, the cuddly heavenward synths of Yeasayer, the post-apocalyptic stutter-hop of El-P, the head rush of Ibiza house". Jordy Kasko of Review Rinse Repeat {{compared the}} style of A Thousand Suns to that of Pink Floyd's eighth studio album The Dark Side of the Moon and Radiohead's fourth studio album Kid A.|$|E
500|$|In June 2016, it was {{confirmed}} through Anime News Network that Minmi would release {{a new song}} titled [...] "Hologram", which {{would serve as a}} featured track for the first season of Japanese anime television series, Actually, I Am… (Japanese: Jitsu wa Watashi wa) (2015). [...] "Hologram" [...] marks Minmi's second consecutive single to have been written, composed, arranged, and produced by herself, following her 2014 single [...] "Ite Itai yo". Musically, it was pointed out by a writer for Selective Hearing as a transition from her signature reggae music styles from previous releases to dance-pop and electronic dance music, whilst retaining musical elements of dancehall music. It also incorporates synthesizers and keyboards in its instrumentation, with Minmi's vocals being processed with Auto-Tune and <b>vocoder</b> pyrotechnics.|$|E
