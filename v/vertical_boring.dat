50|$|The {{company had}} modern shops for mill work, {{pulp and paper}} machinery, general machine shop work, {{structural}} steel, power and heating, boilers and tanks, iron, and brass and aluminum castings. At {{the time of its}} construction, the machine shop contained the largest <b>vertical</b> <b>boring</b> mill between Toronto and Vancouver. The plant covered 35 acres and was located at the north of Lakehead Harbour. There were 76 buildings with a roofed area of 300,000 ft2 m2.|$|E
50|$|This factory {{had some}} of the largest machine tools in the UK. One, a <b>vertical</b> <b>boring</b> mill had a {{turntable}} 36' in diameter, used for machining the gun turret gear rings. This and other machines lent themselves to the machining of large turbine casing castings for the hydro-electric schemes. The building had three tiers of overhead cranes and could together lift several hundred tons. The building still continues to manufacture automotive parts under the ownership of Albion, now a subsidiary of American Axle.|$|E
50|$|The {{boring process}} can be {{executed}} on various machine tools, including (1) general-purpose or universal machines, such as lathes (/turning centers) or milling machines (/machining centers), and (2) machines designed to specialize in boring as a primary function, such as jig borers and boring machines or boring mills, which include <b>vertical</b> <b>boring</b> mills (workpiece rotates around a vertical axis while boring bar/head moves linearly; essentially a vertical lathe) and horizontal boring mills (workpiece sits on a table while the boring bar rotates around a horizontal axis; essentially a specialized horizontal milling machine).|$|E

40|$|MR imaging {{is uniquely}} placed to non-invasively study rodent cardiac {{structure}} and function. High-field MR scanners commonly have a <b>vertical</b> <b>bore,</b> {{and the purpose}} of this work was to demonstrate CINE-MR imaging in normal and infarcted rat hearts after determining hemodynamic stability when positioned vertically for imaging. Optimisation of imaging parameters was carried out prior to assessment of cardiac function in a group of normal and infarcted rat hearts. Rat hemodynamics were unaltered when vertical for 90 minutes, compared with horizontal measurements and rat cardiac parameters were measured accurately and reproducibly with our optimized CINE-MR protocol. A flip angle of 17. 5 ࠷as shown to provide optimal contrast for the assessment of structure and function, and, in contrast to our findings in mice, respiratory gating was not found to be essential.

5000|$|A gun foundry, {{overseen by}} a Master Founder, was {{established}} in 1717. (The decision of the Board of Ordnance {{to set up and}} supervise its own foundry operations followed a devastating explosion at the private foundry it had previously used in Moorfields.) In Woolwich, the original Royal Brass Foundry building survives (built {{on the site of the}} relocated [...] "Greenwich Barn"). Its handsome exterior encloses a space designed for pure industrial functionality, with height to accommodate a <b>vertical</b> <b>boring</b> machine, and tall doors permitting easy removal of newly made cannons.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "vertical turret lathe" [...] (VTL) {{is applied}} to {{machines}} wherein the same essential design of the horizontal version is upended, which allows the headstock {{to sit on the}} floor and the faceplate to become a horizontal rotating table, analogous to a huge potter's wheel. This is useful for the handling of very large, heavy, short workpieces. Vertical lathes in general are also called [...] "vertical boring mills" [...] or often simply [...] "boring mills"; therefore a vertical turret lathe is a <b>vertical</b> <b>boring</b> mill equipped with a turret. A CNC version is called a [...] "CNC VTL".|$|E
5000|$|Bullard Sr's son, Edward Payson Bullard Jr (1872-1953), {{continued}} the family machine tool business {{and brought the}} turret principle to the <b>vertical</b> <b>boring</b> mill, making it a vertical turret lathe. For a while in America during the 20th century, the name [...] "Bullard" [...] {{on the shop floor}} was something of a genericized trademark for vertical turret-head boring mills. E.P. Bullard Jr led the development of the company's multiple-spindle [...] brand machine that became an important automatic lathe in the mass production of parts for the automotive industry. Bullard Jr was president of the company for 40 years, through World War I, the interwar period, and World War II, a period during which the Bullard company was the largest machine tool builder in the U.S., and vast volumes of military matériel were produced by countless companies running Bullard machines. Bullard is now owned by Bourn& Koch, based in Rockford, Illinois. Bourn & Koch continues to provide OEM parts, service and support for their machines.|$|E

50|$|Similarly, Connecticut {{industry}} became {{well known}} in allied fields. Hardware and tools continue to be manufactured by Stanley Corporation in New Britain, despite having almost moved elsewhere for financial reasons. Connecticut was a major area for development and manufacture of machine tools. In 1818, Simeon North designed America's first milling machine. Machinist Elisha Root first designed machinery for the Collins Company of Collinsville which manufactured axes which became world-famous, then was hired by Colt in 1849 to modernize firearm production by designing precision drop hammers, boring machines, gauges, jigs, etc., and improving the milling machines designed by Francis A. Pratt for the George S. Lincoln company in Hartford; the resulting Lincoln miller became world-famous, selling over 150,000 machines. Another Colt engineer, William Mason, patented 125 inventions for manufacture of firearms, as well as steam pumps and power looms. Christopher Spencer invented the automatic turret lathe (which in its small- to medium-sized form {{is known as a}} screw machine) for machining screws, as well as the variable cam cylinder used to control the turret. Francis A. Pratt and Amos Whitney invented a thread milling machine in 1865; Whitney also perfected various measurement instruments, and Pratt designed the aforementioned original milling machine manufactured by the George S. Lincoln company of Hartford. Simon Fairman invented the lathe chuck in West Stafford in 1830, and his son-in-law, Austin F. Cushman, invented the self-centering Cushman Universal Chuck in 1862. Edward P. Bullard designed the <b>vertical</b> <b>boring</b> mill in 1883. Charles E. Billings perfected the drop hammer for metal forging in the 1870s and designed the copper commutator central to the operation of electrical generators and motors. Edwin R. Fellows of Torrington in 1896 designed and built a new type of gear shaper and founded the Fellows Gear Shaper Company, which made a vital contribution to the manufacture of effective and reliable gear transmissions for the nascent automotive industry. The name Bridgeport on machine tools continues to be a guarantee of high quality around the world, for people who have no idea that the machinery is named after a city in Connecticut. Even the world of toys was dominated by the A. C. Gilbert Company, manufacturers of Erector Sets as well as other educational toys such as chemistry sets, microscopes, toy trains, etc.|$|E

40|$|During the {{renovation}} of sewers by means of trenches methods {{it is not the}} custom to renovate the sewer connections of the houses affected - although these usually are in an equally bad condition. The reason for this probably is the very high cost - why reluctance {{on the part of the}} house-owners can be expected. It is the intention of this project to develop and test a device with which sewer connections can be replaced at low cost and which can also be used under difficult ground conditions as well as below ground-water level. Following well-established horizontal thrust-boring machines, a <b>vertical</b> <b>boring</b> machine was developed which works on the principle of trenches methods. It allows borings from ground level to the sewers in angles from 30 to 90. A new bore head was designed to control direction, and gauging techniques required for this were optimized. With the help of a pneumatic in-hole-hammer it is possible to use the machine even in difficult ground conditions like rock or stony ground. The efficiency of the prototype could be proven using it in-situ. A lot of investigations and tests were carried out for its use below ground-water level. Still, the process evolved in the laboratory has to be optimized further before it can be used in practice. (orig.)

40|$|The {{multidisciplinary}} {{field of}} tissue engineering (TE) aims to create biological substitutes to restore, maintain, or enhance {{the function of}} tissue or whole organs, in which the mechanical properties of replacements are critical to their structure and function. Several techniques have been investigated for measuring the mechanical properties of developing tissues and organs; however, current methods are destructive. The goal of this work is to apply high resolution Magnetic Resonance Elastography (μMRE) technique with 100 μm in-plane resolution to address a critical problem in TE: nondestructive monitoring and characterization of growing mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) -based tissue engineered constructs.

The authors determined diversity of populations of prokaryotic genomes of independent bacterial clones isolated from both surface soil, and subsurface sediments. The degree of diversity for deep subsurface isolates was exceedingly high, much higher than that observed for surface soil isolates. The authors have found that the genomes of some subsurface isolates are significantly more plastic than those for strains isolated from surface environments.
