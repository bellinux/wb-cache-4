5|$|In November 1962, Rolls-Royce {{offered a}} PCB-equipped <b>vectored</b> thrust twin-Spey design as an {{alternative}} to the BS100. This alternative engine arrangement was widely seen as inferior, particularly due to the danger posed by asymmetric thrust output if a single engine failure occurred; however, Rolls-Royce claimed that their solution could be available sooner than the BS100 would be. In December 1962, Bristol performed the first successful run of a PCB-equipped Pegasus 2 engine. In order to perform a vertical takeoff, the use of PCB was necessitated; however, this feature would have come at the cost of significant ground erosion during operations.|$|E
5|$|The jamming {{operations}} were effective, {{but the decision}} to pack {{a large number of}} aircraft into relatively small airspace made it certain that German night fighters would locate some aircraft. At this time, German policy was to commit only Experten to battle as they had the skill and experience to find and shoot down Allied bombers. The first fighters were being <b>vectored</b> onto their targets as the bombs began to fall on Ladbergen. Four pilots claimed all eight of the Lancasters lost on the raid out of a operating force of some 203 bombers. Geschwaderkommodore of NJG 4, Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer claimed two; Hauptmann (Captain) Hermann Greiner claimed three; Hauptmann Josef Kraft claimed two, while Major Martin Drewes claimed one.|$|E
50|$|From the definition, it {{is clear}} that a {{displacement}} <b>vector</b> is a polar <b>vector.</b> The velocity <b>vector</b> is a displacement <b>vector</b> (a polar <b>vector)</b> divided by time (a scalar), so is also a polar <b>vector.</b> Likewise, the momentum <b>vector</b> is the velocity <b>vector</b> (a polar <b>vector)</b> times mass (a scalar), so is a polar <b>vector.</b> Angular momentum is the cross product of a displacement (a polar <b>vector)</b> and momentum (a polar <b>vector),</b> and is therefore a pseudovector. Continuing this way, it is straightforward to classify any <b>vector</b> as either a pseudovector or polar <b>vector.</b>|$|R

5|$|Although the F-35B {{is fully}} capable of {{performing}} vertical landing, {{in a similar}} fashion to the way that the Harrier and Sea Harrier operated, this method of operation places limitations on the loads that the aircraft is capable of returning to the ship with. As a consequence, to avoid the costly disposal at sea of both fuel and munitions, the Royal Navy is developing the Shipborne rolling vertical landing (SRVL) technique for its operation of the Lightning II. SRVL is a hybrid landing technique that uses the Lightning's <b>vectored</b> thrust capability to slow its forward speed to around 70 knots to allow it to make a rolling landing, using its disc brakes, without the need of an arrestor wire. A special type of metallic 'thermal paint' is being developed to withstand temperatures of up to 1,500C in the vicinity of jet nozzles.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham {{had to wait}} a {{month for}} his next victory on 23 December 1940. Kampfgeschwader 1 (KG 1) sent 100 bombers led by Kampfgruppe 100 to attack Manchester. GCI <b>vectored</b> Cunningham onto the enemy aircraft. It was not yet dark and Cunningham {{identified}} the machine as a Heinkel He 111. Flying at 15,000 feet, he saw the Heinkel above the Beaufighter at 16,500 feet. Cunningham engaged the enemy 50 miles south of West Lulworth. The enemy climbed to 19,000 feet. Following, Cunningham opened fire at 200–300 yards. The He 111 was engulfed in fire. The bomber was high enough for the crew to jettison the bombs and incendiaries and glide to France where it crash-landed at Cherbourg. Two of Feldwebel Georg Deininger's crew were wounded. The 3./KGr 100 machine was written off. The crew were unaware they had {{been a victim of}} a night-fighter. They supposed they had been shot down by a flak ship.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham {{took off}} this night from RAF Middle Wallop in Hampshire to patrol north of London. When the {{direction}} of the raid was known he was ordered to proceed to the East Midlands. GCI <b>vectored</b> Cunningham and his temporary radar operator John Phillipson—a former ground radar operator—onto an enemy aircraft, but the crew were forced much further westward. Search lights attracted their attention and Phillipson was able to make a contact and guide him. Soon visual confirmation was made. A tell-tale sign of an aircraft was a blank patch of sky surrounded by a cluster of stars. Keeping in the enemy's blind spot, he flew below it and adjusted his speed to match the German pilot. After closing the range as much as he dared, he fired with all four cannons and the Junkers Ju 88 exploded upon hitting the ground near Wittering, Cambridgeshire at 00:35. Cunningham's victim, 3./KG 54 Ju 88 flown by Unteroffizier Kaspar Sondermeister, was not claimed as destroyed. However, after interrogation of the two German survivors who affirmed the circumstances, Cunningham was granted the victory.|$|E

5|$|Johnson {{returned}} to operational flying in early 1941 in 616 Squadron, which was forming {{part of the}} Tangmere Wing. Johnson often found himself flying alongside Wing Commander Douglas Bader and Australian ace Tony Gaze. On 15 January 1941, Johnson, the recently appointed Squadron Leader Burton and Pilot Officer Hugh Dundas, who arrived back at the squadron on 13 September 1940, took off to offer cover for a convoy off North Coates. The controller <b>vectored</b> the pair onto an enemy aircraft, a Dornier Do 17. Both attacked the bomber and lost sight of it and each other. Although the controllers intercepted distress signals from the bomber Johnson did not see it crash. They were credited with one enemy aircraft damaged. It {{was the only time}} Johnson was to engage a German bomber. By the end of January, Johnson had added another 16.35 flying hours on Spitfires.|$|E

They took care of the first formation of twelve bombers that emerged from the clouds. Two recently launched divisions of VF-18 Snooper Anti-Submarine Patrol (SNASP) were also routed to intercept, including one division led by Harris. His division had barely finished grouping up after launch when they sighted a second formation of bombers coming towards the ships.

Late in the afternoon, the Japanese launched a small airstrike, without any escorting fighters, based on an erroneous spot report. The American carriers were far closer to the Japanese than they realized and roughly in line with their intended target. Alerted by radar, some of the American Combat Air Patrol (CAP) was <b>vectored</b> to intercept the Japanese aircraft, the rest being retained near the carriers because of bad weather and fading daylight.
