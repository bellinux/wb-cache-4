40|$|Multiple {{periodic}} oscillations in a nonlinear {{suspension bridge}} system. (English summary) J. Math. Anal. Appl. 269 (2002), no. 2, 726 – 746. In this paper the author considers a suspension bridge model proposed by A. C. Lazer and P. J. McKenna [SIAM Rev. 32 (1990), no. 4, 537 – 578; MR 1084570 (92 g: 73059) ] which describes oscillations in a simplified suspension bridge configuration. The roadbed of length L is modeled by a horizontal vibrating beam with both ends simply supported, and the supporting cable of length L is modeled by a horizontal vibrating string with both ends fixed. The <b>vertical</b> <b>stays</b> connecting the roadbed to the supporting cable are modeled by nonlinear springs which resist expansion {{but do not}} resist compression. The author is interested in multiple periodic oscillations in this model which are symmetric about x = L/ 2. When the material parameters satisfy certain conditions it is shown by using a variational reduction method and the Mountain Pass method that the model system admits at least three periodic oscillations. The proof of this result is rather long and complicated, and gives no information about the stability of these periodic solutions...|$|R

Reproduction is oviparous, with females producing 300,000 to 1,000,000 eggs. Spawning occurs year-round; spawning areas are known to exist in the Caribbean Sea and off the coast of Florida. Males reach sexual maturity at 43 cm long and females at 50 cm long. As the fish mature and move into deeper water where there is less available light, they lose the cone cells in their eyes in favor of rod cells.|$|R

It {{is one of the}} few sharks that conduct a diel <b>vertical</b> migration, <b>staying</b> in deep water during the day and moving into surface waters at night to feed. To protect its sensitive brain and eyes from the temperature changes accompanying these movements, the bigeye thresher has a vascular exchange system called the rete mirabile around those organs. This species feeds mainly on fish and squid, which are stunned via whip-like strikes of the long tail. Bigeye threshers are ovoviviparous, usually bearing litters of two pups. The embryos are oophagous and feed on ova produced by the mother while inside the uterus. This shark is caught by commercial fisheries across its range; the meat is not highly regarded but the skin, fins, and liver oil are valued. It has been assessed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|R

40|$|Phenotypic {{variability}} in carotenoid content {{in a group}} of 28 Daphnia magna clones derived from two populations is shown to have a significant, albeit rather low, genetic component (hR 2 = 0. 23). To test the idea that pigmentation and vertical migration are two alternative mechanisms to reduce photodamage, we checked for a positive correlation between carotenoid content and phototactic behavior. Although no significant correlation was observed for the total group of clones, a significant and positive relation was found for the clones of one of the two populations. These results suggest that, in particular populations, depth during the day and carotenoid pigmentation can bc co-selected. Among diaptomid copepods, individuals with a high concentration of carotenoid pig-ments have been shown to survive natural in-tensities of visible and ultraviolet light better than less pigmented individuals (Hairston 1976, 1979; Byron 1982). The experiments performed by Siebeck (1978) with different Daphnia species from mountain puddles and lakes also showed that the more pigmented species (Daphnia pulex obtusa) was more tol-erant of UV-B radiation than the less pig-mented ones (Daphnia galeata and Daphnia longispina). Hairston (1980 a) observed that the carotenoid content of Diaptomus sicilis and Diaptomus nevadensis was correlated with daytime vertical distribution in two lakes and hypothesized that diurnal vertical migration in zooplankton may have evolved as a mech-anism to avoid photodamage. According to this hypothesis, zooplankters have two alter-native ways of protecting themselves against the deleterious effects of bright sunlight: pro-duce photoprotective pigments or perform a nocturnal <b>vertical</b> migration, <b>staying</b> lower in the water during the day than at night. The better option would then be heavy pigmenta-tion when predation pressure is weak and ver-tical migration when predation pressure is strong. Two critiques of this hypothesis have been put forward.

First Lieutenant Harold Schrier, E Company's executive officer, who volunteered to lead the patrol, was to raise the battalion's American flag to signal that the mountaintop was captured. Along the way up, there was a small number of Japanese sniper shots. When Schrier and his men reached the rim there was a skirmish which they soon overcame. After an iron water pipe was found and used for a flagstaff, the American flag was tied to it by Lt. Schrier. Sergeant Henry Hansen, and Corporal Charles Lindberg. Once the flag was tied on, the flagstaff was taken to the highest position on the crater to be raised. The flag was raised by Lt. Schrier, Platoon Sergeant Ernest Thomas, and Sgt. Hansen.

40|$|Abstract. Analyses of past typhoons have {{suggested}} that global climate changemay result in increases in the intensity of these episodic events and {{that the effects of}} typhoons on the biogeochemistry of aquatic ecosystems will also be strengthened. We collected a 2 -year time series of phytoplankton responses, including chlorophyll-a concentration, primary production and turnover rate in the Fei-Tsui Reservoir, Taiwan, on the basis of five typhoons in 2011 and eight in 2012 (21 weeks affected). We found approximately a two-fold increase in phytoplankton responses during the typhoon period compared with the non-typhoon period. However, there were no consistent correlations between phytoplankton responses and typhoon disturbance and length of typhoon <b>stay.</b> <b>Vertical</b> distributions of phytoplankton responses indicated that the peak values of these responses occurred both during the typhoon periods and during the non-typhoon periods occurring between two typhoons. Moreover, the strongest correlations were found between euphotic depth-averaged phosphate and primary production and turnover rate. Combined effects on phytoplankton responses could explain at least 70 % of the variability. The regulation of phytoplankton responses by multiple processes and interactions among factors that operate during each typhoon event may add complexity to the challenge of detecting typhoon-driven mechanisms in such ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|The Lightweight Rover Unit (LRU) is a four-wheeled {{planetary}} rover for rough terrain exploration. The {{front and the}} rear wheels are each mounted on a bogie axis, respectively. These bogies {{are attached to the}} body via actuated swivel joints. The aim of this thesis is to employ these actuators to control the vertical wheel force distribution. The control of the vertical wheel forces can be utilized to increase the tip-over stability of the rover and to reduce wheel slippage. In the beginning, a mathematical model of the rover was derived. This model allows an estimation of the wheel forces depending on the system state of the rover. Based on this model, a control law was developed that uses the bogie actuators to distribute the vertical wheel forces in a predefined way. The chosen approach employs a quadratic optimization problem to distribute the wheel forces according to variable optimality measures. The mathematical model contained unknown system parameters which had to be identified for a precise estimation of the wheel forces. These parameters were used in the successful verification of the rover model. The errors between the estimated and the real <b>vertical</b> wheel forces <b>stayed</b> below the tolerable limit. Finally, the proposed controller was successfully validated in experimental tests on the LRU...|$|R
40|$|The marine copepod Calanus finmarchicus is an {{important}} key species in the Northern Atlantic due to his abundance and his position in the food web. It performs diel <b>vertical</b> migration (DVM), <b>staying</b> in deeper water layers {{during the day and}} ascending to the surface in the night. The exact trigger for the DVM is not known yet, but light seems to have {{an important}} influence on the position of C. finmarchicus. Some studies suggest an involvement of an endogenous rhythm, which controls the vertical position of C. finmarchicus throughout the day. In this work the DVM and respiration rate of C. finmarchicus were examined under natural simulated light conditions to identify possible circadian rhythms. Therefore, two laboratory experiments were performed with the CV-stage of C. finmarchicus under light/dark (LD) and constant darkness (DD) conditions. The position of C. finmarchicus in the DVM experiment showed a clear diurnal rhythm, with significant differences between day and night. The rhythm persisted in weaker form during constant darkness, indicating that an endogenous circadian clock is involved in the DVM. The results from the respiration experiment supported the assumption, revealing a rhythmicity in the oxygen uptake that also persisted under constant darkness. The light seemed to have in both experiments the role of a Zeitgeber that synchronises the circadian clock. For a final identification of the assumed clock a genetic analysis is necessary. However the experiments showed evidence that the DVM and the metabolic activity of C. finmarchicus are controlled by a circadian clock...|$|R
40|$|SummaryAmong {{the most}} common and chronic {{problems}} in the healthcare system worldwide is the crowding of emergency rooms (ER); leading to many serious complications. King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center utilized health analytics methods to identify areas of deficiency and suggest potential improvements to ER performance. The project implemented solutions and monitored two indicators; ER length of stay (LOS), reflecting efficiency, and percentage of patients leaving without treatment, reflecting effectiveness of the ER. A retrospective analysis of 26, 948 ER encounters in 2014 was done in January 2015. Analytics techniques were used to suggest process redesign based on results. Two recommendations were implemented; a Fast-Track for lower acuity ER patients and an internal waiting area, for those patients who can <b>stay</b> <b>vertical</b> and spare an ER bed. 32. 8 % of ER patients had lower acuity levels and less than 0. 5 % of them were admitted to the hospital. After implementing the two solutions, the total ER LOS was reduced from 20 h in 2014 to less than 12 h in 2016; 40 % improvement. The percentages of patients left without being seen stayed around 3. 5 %, while the percentages of patients left before complete treatment was significantly reduced from 13. 5 % in 2014 to 5. 5 % in 2016. Consequently, the total percentage of patients left without treatment was reduced from 17 % in 2014 to 9 % in 2016, with 50 % improvement. All other factors were the same, including numbers of ER visits, Patient Acuity Level, working staff, working hours, and the count of ER beds. Health analytics methods can be used to identify areas of deficiency, potential improvements, and recommend effective solutions to positively enhance ER performance. More solutions should be examined such as team triaging, patients palmar scanning, and placing a physician in triage. Additionally, more indicators should be monitored, such as the effectiveness of ER treatment—including the rates of revisits...|$|R
40|$|Lime-cement columns {{have been}} used in Sweden to improve poor soil {{conditions}} since the 1970 ’s. The method is inexpensive and flexible, but is difficult to test since the columns are manufactured in-situ. Many test-methods have been developed for testing the column strength during the years. Most of them need to be evaluated using an empirical correction-factor known as the cone factor. The column penetration test, KPS, is the most commonly used method in Sweden, it is considered to be reliable since {{a large part of the}} column cross-section is tested. The problem is that the probe easily deviates out of the column to the softer surrounding soil. Today a pre-drilled guiding-hole, a soil-rock sounding, helps the probe to <b>stay</b> <b>vertical.</b> Although the soil-rock sounding is commonly not used for evaluation of column strength, the penetration resistance is recorded. A visual comparison between the plotted penetration resistances from the two methods shows similarities in both hard and soft areas of the columns. The relation can be measured using statistics, such as the correlation coefficient. A strong correlation was also found, suggesting that a similar equation used to evaluate the undrained shear strength from the column penetration tests can be applied with the data from the soilrock soundings. The statically pushed column penetration test probe and the rotated soil-rock sounding bit bore are likely to cause different failure modes in the column. This means that different empirical cone factors are needed when the undrained shear strength is evaluated. By evaluating the ratio between the cone factors of the column penetration test and the data from the soil-rock soundings from three sites, E-road E 18 north of Stockholm, E-road E 45 outside Gothenburg and at a construction site at Lidingö, the following aspects of the ratio was investigated: if the ratio was site-specific; the sensitivity to the binder content; the sleeve friction and; the sensitivity to rotational speed and rate of penetration. Average columns formed from the penetration resistance at depth from each site were used during the evaluations. The Swedish geotechnical society has standardised two methodologies that can be used for pre-drilling. The soil-rock sounding methodology which has no fixed rate of penetration or rotational speed, and the total sounding methodology, based on the Norwegian total sounding methodology which has fixed rate of penetration and rotational speed. The latter is to prefer when comparing results between sites. To remove the sleeve friction, the data from the soil-rock soundings needed to be de-trended. The amount of de-trending needed to find a constant cone factor varied at the sites between 0. 5 kN/m and 1. 0 kN/m. This however caused high interference, partly from scaling the variation. The cone factor for the total sounding methodology was found to be between 0. 30 - 0. 45 times the cone factor for the column penetration test...|$|R
