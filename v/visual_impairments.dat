5|$|Symbols are visuals used to {{represent}} objects, actions, and concepts {{through the use of}} items such as the physical object itself, colored or black and white photographs, line drawings, and written words. For users with literacy skills, alphabet-based symbols including individual letters, whole words, or parts thereof may be used in combination with the other types of symbols.Tactile symbols which are textured objects, real objects or parts of real objects that are used as a communication symbols particularly for individuals with <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> and/or significant intellectual impairments. Both low- and high-tech devices can incorporate the use of symbols. With low-tech devices, a communication partner is involved and must interpret the symbols chosen. Picture Communication Exchange System (PECS) is a commonly used low-tech communication system that teach individuals how to request, comment, and answer questions through the use of line drawings known as picture communication symbols (PCS). , a high-tech communication system, is an app that incorporates various symbols and motor planning. Symbols are placed in fixed position on the screen which allow users to develop motor patterns associated with certain requests or statements. The choice of symbols and aspects of their presentation, such as size and background, depend on an individual's preferences as well as their linguistic, visual, and cognitive skills. This can be determined using an assessment for symbolic understanding.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} the prevalence and causes of <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> and blindness {{in an urban}} Indian population. Design: Population-based study. Participants: Ethnic Indians aged more than 40 years living in Singapore. Methods: Participants underwent standardized ophthalmic assessments for <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> and blindness, defined using best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and presenting visual acuity (PVA), according to US and modified World Health Organization (WHO) definitions. Main Outcome Measures: Unilateral <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> or blindness was defined {{on the basis of}} the worse eye, and bilateral <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> or blindness was defined {{on the basis of the}} better eye. Primary causes of <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> were determined. Results: A total of 3400 eligible individuals (75. 6 % response rate) participated. On the basis of US definitions, the age-standardized prevalence was 0. 4 % for bilateral blindness (≤ 20 / 200, better eye) and 3. 4 % for bilateral <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> (20 / 200, better eye). Another 0. 3 % of bilateral blindness and 13. 4 % of bilateral <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> were correctable with refraction. Cataract was the principal cause of best-corrected bilateral blindness (60. 0 %) and bilateral <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> (65. 7 %). Other major causes of blindness and <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> included diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, corneal opacity, and myopic maculopathy. Conclusions: The prevalence of bilateral blindness and <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> in Indians living in Singapore is lower than estimates from populations living in India, but similar to estimates obtained from Singapore Malay and Chinese populations. Cataract is the leading cause of blindness and <b>visual</b> <b>impairment.</b> One in 20 cases of bilateral blindness and 1 in 10 cases of bilateral <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> are attributable to diabetic retinopathy. These data may have relevance to many ethnic Indian persons living outside India.

25|$|The {{interpretation}} of facial expressions and mouthing {{can be difficult}} to understand when an individual has a visual impairment. Such problems hinder the ability of people to understand stimuli and translate information pertaining to perception with their brain for analysis. Non-verbal communication is important in effective communication and elders with vision loss are more likely to misinterpret or read the other person's actions in a wrong way. <b>Visual</b> <b>impairments</b> also cause a loss in positive perceptions of the environment around them. This can lead to isolation and possible depression in elderly people. Macular degeneration is a common cause of vision loss in elderly people. It diminishes the macula of the eye, which is responsible for clear vision. It causes progressive loss of central vision and possible loss of colour vision. This degeneration is caused by systemic changes in the circulation of waste products and growth of abnormal vessels around the retina causing the photoreceptors not to receive proper images. Though ageing almost always causes this, other possible effects and risk factors include smoking, obesity, family history and excessive sunlight exposure.|$|E
25|$|The {{ophthalmic}} {{features of}} the Bonnet–Dechaume–Blanc syndrome occur as retinal arteriovenous malformation (AVMs). There are three categories of AVMs that are categorized depending on {{the severity of the}} malformation. The first category consists of the patient having small lesions that usually are asymptomatic. The second category, more severe than the first, is when the patient’s malformation is missing a connecting capillary. The missing capillary is meant to serve as a link between an artery and a vein; without it, edemas, hemorrhages, and <b>visual</b> <b>impairments</b> can result. Category three, the most severe, occurs when the patient’s malformations are so severe that the dilated vessels cause no distinction between artery and vein. When the symptoms are this severe, the patient has a significantly increased risk of developing vision loss. Since the retinal lesions categorized vary from large vascular malformations that affect a majority of the retina to malformations that are barely visible, the lesions cause a wide range of symptoms including decrease in visual sharpness, proptosis, pupillary defects, optic degeneration and visual field defects. The most common type of visual field impairment due to AVMs is homonymous hemianopia. Homonymous hemianopia typically presents unilaterally, but bilateral cases have been reported as well.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> {{is known to}} be higher in a diabetic population than in a non-diabetic population. How much of this <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> may be attributed to uncorrected refractive error is unclear. This study examined the {{prevalence of}} <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> in a Hong Kong diabetic population to determine the proportion of the <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> that could be corrected with prescription spectacles. Methods: Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) were recruited as subjects for this study. All subjects underwent a standardised diabetic retinopathy screening that included measurement of presenting distant vision, biomicroscopic examination of the anterior eye and a retinal examination. For those subjects whose visual acuity was worse than 6 / 9. 5, autorefraction was performed. In this study, we classified <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> into three categories: no <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> (<b>visual</b> acuity in the better eye better than or equal to 6 / 18), mild <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> (<b>visual</b> acuity in the better eye between 6 / 18 and 6 / 60) and severe <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> (<b>visual</b> acuity in the better eye {{less than or equal to}} 6 / 60). Results: For the 2, 301 subjects who participated in this study, the mean age at examination was 61. 4 ± 10. 5 -years (range, 23 to 92 -years). Regarding visual acuity, 11. 3 per cent (259 / 2, 301) of subjects had <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> with 10. 6 per cent being mild (244 / 2, 301) and 0. 7 per cent severe (15 / 2, 301). After correction with a prescription determined by autorefraction, the prevalence of <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> dropped to 4. 0 per cent (91 / 2, 301). Nearly 70 per cent (168 / 259) of <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> was correctable by prescription spectacles and 21. 6 per cent (56 / 259) of subjects were likely to benefit from cataract surgery. Conclusion: For our sample of diabetic patients, nearly 70 per cent of the <b>visual</b> <b>impairment</b> could be remedied by a spectacle correction. In the care of the diabetic eye, eye-care providers should not focus solely on diabetic retinopathy.
