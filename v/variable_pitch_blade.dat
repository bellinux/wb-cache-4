The scope of the project is to develop an innovative propeller concept to improve the efficiency and the working capabilities of micro wind turbines, widening the range of the wind speed for which the turbine can transform energy effectively and safely. This new propeller concept is based on a <b>variable</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>blade,</b> which has morphing capabilities that enables the control system to select the optimum twist law along the blade, to optimize the efficiency also in non-nominal conditions. The final layout identified for the proposed wind turbine will be presented; the pylon contains the power supply and an On Board Computer (OBC) for the active control loop, whereas, the nacelle hosts the motors for yaw control and pitch/twist control. The general idea of the morphing control system is to obtain a twist law theta(r) so as to allow the optimal rotor operation for different working conditions. The proposed control strategy aims at maximizing the rotor efficiency, calculated as the product of the mechanical and the electrical efficiencies by maintaining the rotor in the nominal working condition.

Some designs use <b>variable</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>blade</b> control devices in order to maximize the efficiency of the turbines; however these are complex to design, construct and maintain under the severe load conditions sub sea devices experience. There is an interest in the use of composite materials for potential improvements in hydrodynamic and structural performance of Horizontal Axis Tidal Turbines (HATT). In addition to the advantages of high strength-to-mass and high strength to stiffness ratios, anisotropy of the laminated fibre composites can be designed to allow 3 D tailoring of the blade deformation. Anisotropic structures show different levels of elastic coupling, depending on the ply angle in the layers that comprise such a material. Passive control of a turbine blade can be achieved by taking advantage of the directionality of the anisotropic composite material. A structure that undergoes both bending and twisting due to a pure bending load is said to exhibit bend-twist coupling. This type of behaviour has been identified as a potential method for load reduction - particularly fatigue loads, and an increase in both efficiency and annual energy capture in wind turbines [1]. Preliminary studies have since shown that this may also be the case for HATTs [2]. A computationally efficient, yet realistic, model has been developed in order to estimate the amount of induced twist present on a bend-twist coupled blade in a tidal stream. This model takes into account the effect on the induced twist of fibre orientation, blade loading and cross section, material mechanical properties, and shell thickness. The method has been incorporated into a Blade Element Momentum code, modified to predict the performance of free stream tidal devices; such that the performance of a HATT with composite bend-twist coupled blades could be estimated. It has been shown that, when compared to a free stream tidal turbine with fixed blades of a similar configuration, a HATT that utilises composite bend-twist couple blades can reduced fatigue loading, bring the turbine efficiency closer to the Betz limit and increase the annual energy capture...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{objective was to}} investigate the generation and collection of power generated in a distributed tidal generation site, and realise the most economic grid connection methodology for a practical installation. Current tidal steam prototype designs utilise variable speed gear boxes, power frequency converters and <b>variable</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>blades</b> in the nacelle, thus requiring complicated, heavy and expensive equipment in the nacelle. Moreover the <b>variable</b> <b>blade</b> <b>pitch</b> mechanism has a large power demand, and has to operate day after day submerged in water at depths between 30 m – 80 m. The approach taken in this research is to replace major cost components with much cheaper ones, as well as locating as many components as possible onshore where costs are less. This thesis investigates a novel tidal stream power generation system referred to as “passive rectification to a common DC-bus” where an array of 3 -phase synchronous generators operating at diverse speeds are connected to a common DC bus via passive diode rectifiers. The proposed tidal stream topology shows that <b>variable</b> <b>pitched</b> <b>blades,</b> <b>variable</b> speed gearboxes and frequency converters in the nacelle can be replaced by a much simpler system that uses fixed <b>pitch</b> <b>blades,</b> a fixed ratio gearbox, generator excitation control system, and a diode bridge rectifier. These components are generally cheaper, lighter, have a lower power demand and are more reliable than the components they replace. Also some of the voltage and frequency conversion is carried out ashore where costs are less, in addition to the overall {{reduction in the number of}} components required as some of the components are shared by multiple devices. As a result system efficiency is maximised, in addition to facilitating a reduction in capital, installation and operational costs. Power conversion from the tidal generation power system to shore is achieved via passive rectification to a common DC-bus, thus system power regulation is achieved by individual generator field current control, to attain optimum system operation including, maximum power extraction, power limitation and stall control, in turn improving system reliability and controllability. Furthermore passive stall control via generator field current regulation eliminates the need for mechanical brakes which reduces cost and improves reliability. The feasibility of the proposed power generation system was carried out via computer simulations and later validated via small scale laboratory hardware simulations. ...|$|R

In this paper, we present an experimental programme that utilised two strategies to study rotating stall recovery patterns in an industrial fan. The experimental facility incorporated a fan with both <b>variable</b> <b>pitch</b> in motion <b>blades</b> and a variable speed drive. The facility enabled us first, to study the evolution of unsteady pressure signals on the fan casing whilst varying fan <b>blade</b> <b>pitch</b> and then to examine varying fan rotational speed. Consequently, we were able to recover a fan from stall either by varying <b>blade</b> <b>pitch</b> at constant speed, or by varying speed at constant <b>blade</b> <b>pitch.</b> We also studied the physical flow phenomena associated with stall recovery by cross-correlating signals from circumferentially offset high frequency response pressure transducers and then analysed the cross-spectra. This enabled us to gain insight into the transient fluid flow behaviour associated with stall recovery in the studied industrial fan class. The transient fluid flow behaviour associated with stall recovery by varying <b>blade</b> <b>pitch</b> was indicative of both a mild and progressive transition. In contrast, stall recovery by varying fan speed occurred more suddenly. In comparison with the <b>variable</b> <b>pitch</b> transition, the <b>variable</b> speed transition was more indicative of recovery from mild surge. From this we may conclude that stall recovery via variable speed resulted in significantly higher unsteady mechanical stress induced in fan rotating components than recovery via <b>variable</b> <b>pitch.</b> Higher bending stresses in the fan blades are more likely to result in mechanical failure, and therefore we may conclude that the studied fan is more ‘stall tolerant’ when one operates it as a <b>variable</b> <b>pitch</b> fan rather than as a variable speed fan...|$|R

However, there are few new designs of vertical axis turbines which are customized for building integration.

Due to the application of existing technology, the costs as well as the risks for the SuperFan development program were appraised lower than those of the competing CFM56-5 engine.Due to the lower specific fuel consumption and higher thrust rating, the design of the A340 was modified. Compared to the original design's range of 7,000 nautical miles, the revised version - designated the A340-200 - was projected to have a range up to 8,000 nautical miles with full passenger load.Airbus decided on 26 December 1986 to offer the SuperFan as primary engine option for the A340.Boeing also studied the SuperFan as an option for the 7J7 program.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the modeling and robust controller design {{design for a}} wind-driven induction generator system. a  robust controller for the static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) and the <b>variable</b> <b>blade</b> <b>pitch</b> in a wind energy conversion system (WECS) {{is designed to be}} controlled voltage and mechanical power. This controller leading to satisfactory damping characteristics achieved for the closed loop system. Effects of various system disturbances on the dynamic performance have been simulated, and the results comparison with output feedback controller reveal that the proposed controller is effective in regulating the load voltage and stabilizing the generator rotating speed for WECS. The nonlinear simulation was conducted and that comparison with the above linear simulation shows that the simulations carried out for small changes in system inputs is sufficiently accurate. For review performance against large disturbances from a symmetrical three-phase short circuit at infinity bus bar has been used  and the results show robust controller design as well as fluctuations resulting from the short circuit is damped...|$|R
