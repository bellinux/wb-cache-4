The letter B may indicate that the right time code is from the second set of timecode on the <b>video</b> <b>tape.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{chemistry}} of the cometary meteoroids was studied by {{closed circuit television}} observing systems. Vidicon cameras produce basic data on standard <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> and enable the recording of the spectra of faint shower meteors, consequently the chemical study is extended to smaller particles {{and we have a}} larger data bank than is available from the more conventional method of recording meteor spectra by photography. The two main problems in using <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> meteor spectrum records are: (1) the <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> recording has a much lower resolution than the photographic technique; (2) <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> is relatively new type of data storage in astronomy and the methods of quantitative photometry have not yet been fully developed in the various fields where <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> is used. The use of the most detailed photographic meteor spectra to calibrate the <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> records and to make positive identification of the more prominent chemical elements appearing in the spectra may solve the low resolution problem. Progress in the development of standard photometric techniques for the analysis of <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> records of meteor spectra is reported...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 24 - 25) The {{use of the}} <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> recorder in {{the classroom}} is assumed to promote some educational objectives. Literature on the effects of <b>Video</b> <b>tape</b> and television in the classroom has been reviewed and the hypothesis developed that classes which use the <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> recorder for motivation will achieve more than classes which do not. Three eighth grade American history classes were used as subjects for a test of this hypothesis. One class was allowed to use <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> equipment to present oral reports on slavery, the Civil War or World War II, based on independent research; two classes did not use <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> equipment for reports. Comparisons were made between the three classes' scores on written tests following presentation of the reports, their comments on questionnaires and notes from daily observation of the three classes by the teacher. The results show that the use of <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> recording by the student is an effective motivational tool...|$|R

5|$|Persuaded by the European {{football}} body, UEFA, to take action, the FA summoned Hackett and {{the other}} match officials for their accounts of the brawl. Three days after the match, both clubs were formally charged. A five-man disciplinary committee later studied three <b>video</b> <b>tapes</b> of how the brawl came about {{and listened to the}} defence presented by club representatives. In November 1990, Arsenal and Manchester United were fined Â£50,000 each and deducted league points; Arsenal lost two points and United one.|$|E
5|$|The GR1A and GR4A were {{equipped}} with TIRRS (Tornado Infrared Reconnaissance System), consisting of one SLIR (Sideways Looking Infra Red) sensor {{on each side}} of the fuselage forward of the engine intakes to capture oblique images, and a single IRLS (InfrarRed LineScan) sensor mounted on the fuselage's underside to provide vertical images. TIRRS recorded images on six S-VHS <b>video</b> <b>tapes.</b> The newer RAPTOR reconnaissance pod has replaced the built-in TIRRS system.|$|E

A VT operator sets up and operates <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> equipment to record and play back the program, reads the program log to ascertain when {{to record the}} program, and when it airs. They also select sources, such as satellite or studio, for the program, and select the video recording equipment to use. They are heavily used in sports programming, and in all <b>video</b> <b>taped</b> productions, including television news programming, and sometimes sitcoms, if they are shot on <b>video</b> <b>tape),</b> they are also responsible for action replays and quickly editing highlights while a show is in progress. As the title suggests, <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> operators only work in <b>video</b> <b>taped</b> production. Although, VTR operator's still work on digital productions. It is a name that has just stuck to the playback operator. They can also be on set editors to give the director and director of photography {{the ability to see}} how what they shot cuts together.|$|R

5|$|Mulder and Scully {{visit the}} murderer's house, where Mulder sees a {{repairman}} {{working on the}} cable line. They find hundreds of <b>video</b> <b>tapes</b> of the news. Scully believes all the violence the man watched on TV may have {{led him to the}} murders, something Mulder does not believe. That night Scully watches the tapes, seeing if there are any clues to why the man committed murder. She steps outside for a break and sees Mulder in a car talking to the Cigarette Smoking Man. In the morning Scully suspiciously asks Mulder if he moved the car in the night. When Mulder tells her he only went out for a paper earlier, she believes he is lying. The next day a similar murder occurs when a woman thinks she sees her husband in a hammock with another woman; in reality she has killed her neighbor who was in a hammock with his dog. Mulder sees the same cable repairman near the house, who escapes from him. Climbing up on the telephone pole Mulder finds a device inside the cable box.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the filming}} was completed, more than 20 two-hour Beta SP <b>video</b> <b>tapes</b> of footage {{had to be}} edited down to fit {{the actions of the}} game. The {{programming}} included editing the original video footage, and mixing the rendered images of doors, drawers, chairs and other objects into the footage frame-by-frame, which was necessary for more than 100 scenes. The game required more polishing and fine-tuning than most games of its time due to the many video components, and the programmers had to determine the desired frame rate, data transfer rate and desired resolution of the video elements. Another challenge for the game was CD resource management. Since many of the scenes in the game could be repeated in multiple chapters, some pieces of the code were written onto several different CDs {{to reduce the number of}} times the player had to swap discs in the middle of a chapter, an unusual practice for computer games at the time. The final game was on seven discs, a large number for a computer game, and more than the four or five discs originally expected.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{motivation}} {{for the development of}} <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> was as a short or long-term archival medium. Only after a series of technical advances spanning decades did <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> editing finally become a viable production tool, up to par with film editing.|$|R

50|$|Video {{technology}} was first developed for mechanical television systems, which were quickly replaced by {{cathode ray tube}} (CRT) television systems, but several new technologies for video display devices have since been invented. Video was originally exclusively a live technology. Charles Ginsburg led an Ampex research team developing {{one of the first}} practical <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> recorder (VTR). In 1951 the first <b>video</b> <b>tape</b> recorder captured live images from television cameras by converting the camera's electrical impulses and saving the information onto magnetic <b>video</b> <b>tape.</b>|$|R

25|$|Vicarious trauma affects workers being 'witnesses' {{to their}} clients' trauma. It {{is more likely}} to occur in {{situations}} where trauma related work is the norm rather than the exception. Listening with empathy to the clients generates feeling, and 'seeing oneself' in clients' trauma may compound the risk for developing trauma symptoms. May also result if we are witness to situations that happen in the course of our work (e.g. violence in the workplace, reviewing violent <b>video</b> <b>tapes,</b> etc). Risk increases with exposure and with the absence of seeking protective factors and pre-preparation of preventive strategies.|$|E
