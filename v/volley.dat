5|$|Herodotus {{says that}} when the Persians in Asia Minor heard {{of the attack on}} Sardis, they {{gathered}} together, and marched to the relief of Artaphernes. When they arrived at Sardis, they found the Greeks recently departed. So they followed their tracks back towards Ephesus. They caught up with the Greeks outside Ephesus and the Greeks were forced to turn and prepare to fight. Holland suggests that the Persians were primarily cavalry (hence their ability {{to catch up with the}} Greeks). The typical Persian cavalry of the time were probably missile cavalry, whose tactics were to wear down a static enemy with <b>volley</b> after <b>volley.</b>|$|E

5000|$|A {{serve and}} <b>volleyer</b> {{has a great}} net game, is quick around the net, and has fine touch for <b>volleys.</b> Serve and volleyers {{come up to the}} net at every {{opportunity}} when serving. They are almost always attackers and can hit many winners with varieties of <b>volleys</b> and drop <b>volleys.</b> When not serving, they often employ the [...] "chip-and-charge", chipping back the serve without attempting to hit a winner and rushing the net. The serve-and-volleyers' strategy is to put pressure on the opponent to try to hit difficult passing shots. This strategy is extremely effective against pushers.|$|R

5|$|After {{the militia}} {{advanced}} about 200yards (200m), the Kickapoo suddenly let loose a loud yell from their hidden {{position on the}} bank of an oxbow lake along the river. The warriors fired a <b>volley</b> toward the advancing militia and three men, Samuel Black, Samuel Wells and Montaville Morris, were hit and went down. Dodge did not hesitate and ordered his men to charge, they obeyed and waited until they were within six feet of the Kickapoo before discharging their weapons. The fight, after the initial charge and <b>volley,</b> descended into a hand-to-hand struggle with tomahawks, bayonets, muskets and spears the weapons of choice. The fighting only lasted a few minutes: nine Kickapoo were killed on the spot and the other two were felled while fleeing across the lake. During the hand-to-hand combat a fourth member of the militia, Thomas Jenkins, was wounded. Though short, the Battle of Horseshoe Bend had a lasting impact and influence {{on the rest of the}} war.|$|E
40|$|Vertebrate {{reproduction}} {{is dependent on}} the operation of a central signal generator that directs the episodic release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, a neuropeptide that stimulates secretion of the pituitary gonadotropic hormones and, thereby, controls gonadal function. The electrophysiological correlates of this pulse generator are characterized by abrupt increases in hypothalamic multiunit electrical activity (MUA <b>volleys)</b> invariably associated with the initiation of secretory episodes of luteinizing hormone. Using cluster analysis, we extracted single units from the multiunit signals recorded from the mediobasal hypothalamus of four intact and four ovariectomized rhesus monkeys. Of the 40 individual units identified in this manner, 24 increased their frequency with the MUA <b>volleys.</b> The onset and termination of these single-unit bursts occurred coincidently with those of the MUA <b>volleys</b> in both intact and ovariectomized animals, indicating that the longer duration of the MUA <b>volleys</b> characteristic of the gonadectomized animals was due not to the sequential activation of different units but to the longer bursts of the individual cells. Four other units showed decreases in firing rate during the MUA <b>volleys,</b> while the frequency of the remainder did not change. All the examined units were active during the intervals between the <b>volleys</b> of electrical activity. The results indicate that the MUA <b>volleys</b> associated with the activity of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone pulse generator represent the simultaneous increase in firing rate of some individual hypothalamic neurons and the decrease in the frequency of others...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Synchronously spiking neurons {{have been}} {{observed}} in the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus. In computer models, synchronous spike <b>volleys</b> may be propagated across appropriately connected neuron populations. However, {{it is unclear how}} the appropriate synaptic connectivity is set up during development and maintained during adult learning. We performed computer simulations to investigate the influence of temporally asymmetric Hebbian synaptic plasticity on the propagation of spike <b>volleys.</b> In addition to feedforward connections, recurrent connections were included between and within neuron populations and spike transmission delays varied due to axonal, synaptic and dendritic transmission. We found that repeated presentations of input <b>volleys</b> decreased the synaptic conductances of intragroup and feedback connections while synaptic conductances of feedforward connections with short delays became stronger than those of connections with longer delays. These adaptations led to the synchronization of spike <b>volleys</b> as they propagated across neuron populations. The findings suggests that temporally asymmetric Hebbian learning may enhance synchronized spiking within small populations of neurons in cortical and hippocampal areas and familiar stimuli may produce synchronized spike <b>volleys</b> that are rapidly propagated across neural tissue. ...|$|R

5|$|Chelsea's goalscoring chance came in {{the fifth}} minute when Poyet found Di Matteo, who fumbled his {{opportunity}} as it went over the goal. Stuttgart almost took the lead through Bobic, who took advantage of Steve Clarke's poor clearance but Bobic's attempt went just past the right goalpost. The Germans continued to push forward, as Balakov had a chance on goal, after being found by Poschner, but his shot was kept out by Ed de Goey to mark the first save of the match. Chelsea held on however; a few minutes later, Poyet ran towards the ball to direct a powerful <b>volley</b> on goal following a weak clearing header from Berthold, but a well-placed Franz Wohlfahrt dived to read the attempt. Chelsea had another chance before half time, which saw Wise from a Di Matteo free kick launch another <b>volley,</b> with the successive effort going just off the target.|$|E

50|$|Shimizu {{was mainly}} a {{baseline}} player. His forehand grip {{was described as}} 'faulty' but nevertheless his passing shots, which he hit low and with topspin, were judged as excellent. Shimizu's backhand was orthodox and played with force from the baseline. His service was hit at shoulder height with precision and reverse twist but without great speed. His forehand <b>volleys</b> were comparatively weak but his backhand <b>volleys</b> and his smash were first-class. In his book The Art of Lawn Tennis Bill Tilden describes Shimuzu as a baseline player and marvelous court coverer with an uncanny accuracy in his shots. In comparing Shimuzu to his countryman Kumagae he states that Shimizu had a superior backhand and low <b>volleying</b> skills but lacked Kumagae's forehand drive and had a weaker service. Their high <b>volleying</b> skills and overheads were judged equal.|$|R
5000|$|The {{longtime}} tennis writer Ted Tinling has credited Ryan with {{inventing the}} <b>volleying</b> style later perfected by {{players such as}} Sarah Palfrey Cooke, Alice Marble, Louise Brough Clapp, Margaret Osborne duPont, Doris Hart, Darlene Hard, Margaret Court, Navratilova, and King. [...] "Before World War I, women's tennis consisted primary of slogging duels from the baseline. There were a few <b>volleying</b> pioneers, notably ... Hazel Hotchkiss Wightman and Ethel Thomson Larcombe, but <b>volleying</b> as a fundamental, aggressive technique was first injected into the women's game by ... Ryan." [...] However, Tinling also said about Ryan, [...] "Elizabeth wasn't fast enough for singles. Too heavy." ...|$|R

5|$|Nasri {{continued}} his fine form as season wore on. In the club's Champions League group stage tie against Serbian club Partizan, he assisted on a Sébastien Squillaci {{goal in the}} team's 3–1 victory. In October 2010, Nasri went on a streak in which he scored goals in three-straight matches. He started the streak by converting a penalty in a 2–1 win over Birmingham City. In the club's following match, against Shakhtar Donetsk, Nasri scored on a left-footed <b>volley</b> in a 5–1 victory. He also assisted on a goal in the match. Against Manchester City five days later, he scored the first goal {{and set up the}} third in a 3–0 victory. As a result of his performances in October 2010, Nasri was named the PFA Fans' Player of the Month. In November, Nasri was on the score-sheet again netting the opener in a 3–2 defeat to Tottenham. A week later, he scored a <b>volley</b> in a 4–2 win over Aston Villa.|$|E

5000|$|The {{mission of}} the Firing Party element is to render three <b>volleys</b> of rifle fire at the gravesite to honor the {{deceased}} during funeral services. It is commonly thought that as there are seven members on the party (the NCOIC of the firing party is the eighth member and {{is known as the}} [...] "NFP") with each firing three rounds, that this composes a [...] "21-gun salute". However, this is incorrect. 21 rounds just happen to be the number of rounds fired. The firing party's goal is to fire three <b>volleys</b> in perfect unison (these are known as [...] "boomers"). The custom of firing three <b>volleys</b> began as a way of signaling the opposing side that the battlefield dead had been retrieved and that the fighting could resume. Seven members on the firing party is thought to originate from the idea that seven is a lucky number. Three <b>volleys</b> being fired is thought to symbolize the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit of the Christian faith. It was also believed that the sound of the gunfire scared away evil spirits from the gravesite and paved a way for the soul to follow to heaven. As time passed, these <b>volleys</b> became an official military custom that survives to this day.|$|R

5|$|Aided by his serve, Raonic employs an all-court {{style with}} an {{emphasis}} on short points. His groundstrokes are both good, but his forehand is stronger than his backhand. Because of this, he has been known to run around his backhand and hit inside-out forehands instead. He attempts to dictate play and is generally more aggressive than his opponent, as evidenced by usually having more winners and more unforced errors. To finish points quickly, Raonic occasionally approaches the net, with either a serve and <b>volley</b> or chip and charge strategy.|$|E
