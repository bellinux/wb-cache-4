40|$|The {{replication}} of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) in nondividing host cells {{such as those of}} macrophage lineage is an important feature of AIDS pathogenesis. The pattern of HIV- 1 replication is dictated, in part, by the nucleophilic property of the viral gag matrix (MA) protein, a component of the viral preintegration complex that facilitates nuclear localization of <b>viral</b> <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> in the absence of mitosis. We now identify the accessory viral protein Vpr, as a second nucleophilic component that influences nuclear localization of <b>viral</b> <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> in nondividing cells. Reverse transcription and nuclear localization of <b>viral</b> <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> following infection of cells by viruses lacking Vpr or viruses containing mutations in a gag MA nuclear localization sequence were indistinguishable from the pattern observed in cells infected by wild-type HIV- 1. These viruses retained the ability to replicate in both dividing and nondividing host cells including monocyte-derived macrophages. In contrast, introduction of both gag MA and Vpr mutations in HIV- 1 attenuated nuclear localization of <b>viral</b> <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> in nondividing cells and virus replication in monocyte-derived macrophages. These studies demonstrate redundant nucleophilic determinants of HIV- 1 that independently permit nuclear localization of <b>viral</b> <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> and virus replication in nondividing cells such as monocyte-derived macrophages.

This agent in its natural host, the cottontail rabbit, is infective, can be seen as virus bodies with the electron microscope, and can be visualized with fluorescent antibody only in the upper keratinizing cells of individual papillomas. At the growing bases of such papillomas, where neoplasia is in active progress, no infective virus is demonstrable and viral bodies cannot be visualized by either the electron microscope or fluorescent antibody.
