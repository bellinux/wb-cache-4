The apparent volumetric shrinkage, evaluated from density measurements at room temperature, was correlated with the progress of epoxide conversion. During the entire curing process, the apparent volume shrinkage {{was found to be}} less than 3 % and occurred before vitrification. A slight re-expansion of the resin, attributed to self-antiplasticization effects, was observed during postcuring at 1808 C. It was concluded that residual stresses were not generated due to chemical cross-linking during curing but rather from thermal contraction occurring during the cooling stage after cure. A photo-elastic method was used to characterize residual stresses during cooling in a deliberately engineered resin rich hole of a carbon fiber/RTM 6 composite. The residual stress was found to reach approximately 28 MPa, which is in good agreement with the value calculated from the shrinkage and elastic moduli.

50|$|Most radiometers for {{remote sensing}} (RS) acquire {{multispectral}} images. Dividing the spectrum into many bands, multispectral {{is the opposite}} of panchromatic, which records only the total intensity of radiation falling on each pixel. Usually, Earth observation satellites have three or more radiometers (Landsat has seven). Each acquires one digital image (in remote sensing, called a 'scene') in a small spectral band. The bands are grouped into wavelength regions based on the origin of the light. The shortest wavelength region is the ultra-violett (wavelengths < 0.4 µm), followed by the visible, or VIS, region, ranging from 0.4 µm to 0.7 µm. The others are the near-infrared with wavelengths from 0.7 µm to 1 µm, followed by the Short-Wave-Infrared (SWIR) from 1 µm to 2.5 µm, the middle infrared (MIR) from 4 µm to 6 µm, <b>and</b> far, <b>or</b> <b>thermal</b> infrared (FIR <b>or</b> <b>thermal)</b> from 8 µm to 14 µm.

40|$|Present {{capabilities}} of the NASA CARES/Life (Ceramic Analysis and Reliability Evaluation of Structures/Life) code include probabilistic life prediction of ceramic components subjected to fast fracture, slow crack growth (stress corrosion), and cyclic fatigue failure modes. Currently, this code has the capability to compute the time-dependent reliability of ceramic structures subjected to simple time-dependent loading. For example, in slow crack growth (SCG) type failure conditions CARES/Life can handle the cases of sustained and linearly increasing time-dependent loads, while for cyclic fatigue applications various types of repetitive constant amplitude loads can be accounted for. In real applications applied loads are rarely that simple, but rather vary with time in more complex ways such as, for example, engine start up, shut down, and dynamic and vibrational loads. In addition, when a given component is subjected to transient environmental <b>and</b> <b>or</b> <b>thermal</b> conditions, the material properties also vary with time.

40|$|Present status: The {{currently}} used sterilisation-methods for the sterilisation of packaging material {{are based on}} the oxidation of the spores (by e. g. hydrogenperoxyde) <b>and</b> <b>or</b> <b>thermal</b> destruction of the spores (by dry air (300 C) or hot steam). Reason / objective of the investigation: Mainly the needed high temperatures, safety and environmental aspects of the state-of-the-art sterilisation methods are the reason why alternatives are needed. The main objective of the project was to demonstrate that the plasma treatment is able to sterilise the packaging material and in a second step to investigate if the relevant properties of the packaging material are affected. Method: The Robert Bosch GmbH concentrated in its part of the project on the investigation of capacitively and inductively coupled low-pressure radio-frequency plasmas ('RF' 13, 56 MHz). Result: With the inductively coupled RF-plasma source very short treatment times < 10 s were able to reduce the test-spores by 5 to 6 orders of magnitude. The VUV-light emitted by the plasma was identified to be the main spore killing mechanism. The study of the packaging material lad to negative changes of relevant properties in some cases. Conclusions / application possibilities: It could be proved that plasma-sterilisation is a real alternative to the state-of-the-art sterilisation methods. The compatibility with relevant packaging parameters and the technical implementation has to be investigated separately for different applications. (orig.)
