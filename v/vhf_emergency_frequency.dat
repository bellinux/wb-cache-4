5000|$|Testing of {{the signal}} began on October 23, 2012, to check the {{strength}} of its signal and test out potential interference with <b>emergency</b> <b>frequencies.</b> As CKFT is just 25 kilometres from Edmonton, Andrew Nakonechny, program director of CKFT, promised CKFT would [...] "be all about Fort Saskatchewan." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{civilian}} aircraft <b>emergency</b> <b>frequency</b> for voice distress alerting is 121.5 MHz. Military aircraft use 243 MHz (which is a harmonic of 121.5 MHz, {{and therefore}} civilian beacons transmit on this frequency as well). Aircraft can also signal an emergency by setting {{one of several}} special transponder codes, such as 7700.|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{the switch}} to 406 MHz, pilots and ground {{stations}} are encouraged to continue to monitor for transmissions on the <b>emergency</b> <b>frequencies,</b> as many 406 beacons are also equipped with 121.5 [...] "homers."

These operated on the aircraft <b>emergency</b> <b>frequencies</b> of 121.5 and 243 MHz (2.5 and 1.2 meter wavelengths).|$|R
50|$|Air {{traffic control}} may re-establish {{communications}} with NORDO aircraft by using <b>emergency</b> <b>frequencies,</b> voice features of NAVAIDs, or aviation light signals. In {{the event of}} one-way communications (i.e. aircraft can receive only), the controller may request the aircraft make identifying turns, flash their navigational lights, transmit codes or IDENT signals on the transponder, rock their wings, etc., to acknowledge clearances or instructions.|$|R
50|$|In North America, the NDB band is from 190 to 435 kHz {{and from}} 510 to 530 kHz. In Europe, {{there is a}} longwave {{broadcasting}} band from 150 to 280 kHz, so the European NDB band is from 280 kHz to 530 kHz with a gap between 495 and 505 kHz because 500 kHz was the international maritime distress (<b>emergency)</b> <b>frequency.</b>|$|R
5000|$|False alarms were common, as {{the beacon}} {{transmitted}} on the aviation <b>emergency</b> <b>frequency,</b> {{and there is}} interference from other electronic and electrical systems. To reduce false alarms, a beacon was confirmed by a second satellite pass, which could easily slow confirmation of a 'case' of distress to up to about 4 hours (although in rare circumstances the satellites could be position such that immediate detection becomes possible.) ...|$|R
50|$|In Canada, Flight Information Centres (FIC) {{monitor the}} FISE {{frequencies}} (frequency 126.7 MHz is for broadcasts) {{as well as}} 121.5 MHz, the <b>emergency</b> <b>frequency.</b> However, Canadian FIC have phased out the use of 126.7 MHz for FISE (en route flight information) and are instead utilizing discrete frequencies. This is to decrease the frequency congestion often experienced on 126.7. These frequencies {{are found in the}} Canada Flight Supplement (CFS).|$|R
2500|$|According to the U.S. government, Vincennes mistakenly {{identified}} the Iranian airliner as an attacking military fighter. The officers mis{{identified the}} flight profile being flown by the Airbus A300B2 as being {{similar to that}} of an F-14A Tomcat during an attack run; however, the ship's own Aegis Combat System recorded the flight plan of the Iranian airliner as climbing (not descending as in an attack run) {{at the time of the}} incident. The commercial flight had originated at Bandar Abbas, which served dual roles as a base for Iranian F-14 operations and as a hub for commercial, civilian flights. According to the same reports, Vincennes tried unsuccessfully to contact the approaching aircraft, seven times on the military <b>emergency</b> <b>frequency</b> and three times on the civilian <b>emergency</b> <b>frequency,</b> but never on air traffic control frequencies. This civilian aircraft was not equipped to pick up military frequencies and the messages on the civilian emergency channel could have been directed at any aircraft. [...] More confusion arose as the hailed speed was the ground speed, while the pilot's instruments displayed airspeed, a [...] difference.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the case}} of 121.5 MHz beacons, the {{frequency}} is known in aviation as the [...] "VHF Guard" [...] <b>emergency</b> <b>frequency,</b> and all U.S. civilian pilots (private and commercial) are required, by FAA policy, to monitor this frequency when {{it is possible to}} do so. The frequency can be used by Automatic Direction Finder (ADF) radionavigation equipment, which is being phased out in favor of VOR and GPS but is still found on many aircraft.|$|R
50|$|Following an {{intensive}} ground school, the EFT course covers {{the rudiments of}} flying, stalling and circuits with the pilots flying their first solo after just 10 hours of tuition. They then advance to spinning, aerobatics, instrument flying, formation flying and low level navigation. As the course progresses, emergency handling and airmanship are introduced, this includes simulated engine failures {{and the use of}} <b>emergency</b> <b>frequencies.</b> EFT culminates in the Final Handling Test which is a composite sortie comprising any elements taught during the course.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} <b>emergency</b> <b>frequency</b> (also {{known as}} GUARD) is a frequency {{used on the}} aircraft band reserved for emergency communications for aircraft in distress. The frequencies are 121.5 MHz for civilian, also known as International Air Distress (IAD) or VHF Guard, and 243.0 MHz for military use, also known as Military Air Distress (MAD) or UHF Guard. Earlier emergency locator transmitters used the guard frequencies to transmit, but an additional frequency of 406 MHz is used by more modern ELTs.|$|R
5000|$|Ground {{facilities}} {{identify themselves}} {{by the name}} and function of the facility: e.g. Seattle Tower for the tower air traffic control operators' position, SoCal Approach for a TRACON, or Boston Center for an Area Control Center. All other ICAO countries around the world, for example the European Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA), use Control or Radar instead of Center in their airspace. (Langen Radar, Brussels Control, Paris Control, ...). London Centre (center) is the <b>emergency</b> <b>frequency</b> call sign for London Terminal Control TC.|$|R
5000|$|An islands-wide {{service is}} {{provided}} with 24-hour cover. The control desk maintains a listening watch on marine and civilian <b>emergency</b> radio <b>frequencies</b> and is where [...] "999" [...] emergency calls are answered.|$|R
5000|$|Currently {{the only}} fuel {{available}} is turbine kerosene (Type JET A) {{and it is}} provided by a local contractor. METAR weather services are provided on a limited basis locally and a call out can be arranged for weather at other times. The radio station operates the same hours as the weather service and {{is in fact the}} same person. They use the standard CARS mandatory frequency of 122.1 MHz and they also monitor the <b>emergency</b> <b>frequency</b> of 121.5 MHz. The CARS also monitor the NDB which broadcasts the morse code identification [...] "HI" [...] on 361 kHz.|$|R
5000|$|... 2182 kHz is the {{international}} calling and distress frequency for SSB maritime voice communication (radiotelephony). It is analogous to Channel 16 on the marine VHF band. 500 kHz was for many years the maritime distress and <b>emergency</b> <b>frequency,</b> {{and there are more}} NDBs between 510 and 530 kHz. Navtex, {{which is part of the}} current Global Maritime Distress Safety System occupies 518 kHz and 490 kHz for important digital text broadcasts. Lastly, there are aeronautical and other mobile SSB bands from 2850 kHz to 3500 kHz, crossing the boundary from the MF band into the HF radio band.|$|R
2500|$|Four {{days after}} Powers disappeared, NASA issued a very {{detailed}} press release noting that an aircraft had [...] "gone missing" [...] north of Turkey. The press release {{speculated that the}} pilot might have fallen unconscious while the autopilot was still engaged, even falsely claiming that [...] "the pilot reported over the <b>emergency</b> <b>frequency</b> that he was experiencing oxygen difficulties." [...] To bolster this, a U-2 plane was quickly painted in NASA colors and shown to the media. Under {{the impression that the}} pilot had died and that the plane had been destroyed, the Americans had decided to use the NASA cover-up plan. Nikita Khrushchev used the American misstep to embarrass President Eisenhower and his administration.|$|R
5000|$|... 156 - 158 MHz VHF Marine Radio; 156.8 MHz (Channel 16) is the {{maritime}} <b>emergency</b> and contact <b>frequency.</b>|$|R
