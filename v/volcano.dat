5|$|The name of {{the peak}} was {{suggested}} by an explorer named Chris Dickinson during the Cambridge Coast Mountains Expedition in 1979. It was adopted on November 24, 1980, and has been its official name since then. However, this name for the peak does not normally show up in any volcanological resources. Instead, it is informally referred to as Lava Fork or Lava Fork <b>volcano</b> due to its close association with the creek of the same name. The reason for this controversy is because The <b>Volcano</b> is generic. In speech {{it may not be}} obvious whether The <b>Volcano</b> or the <b>volcano</b> is intended, leading to confusion. Similar named volcanoes in Canada include <b>Volcano</b> Vent in the Tuya volcanic field of northwestern British Columbia and <b>Volcano</b> Mountain in the Fort Selkirk volcanic field of central Yukon. As of 2009, the unofficial terms for The <b>Volcano</b> continue to be used by Natural Resources Canada.|$|E
5|$|Activity of Cerro Blanco {{goes back}} 8 mya, when the Maricunga Belt {{in the west}} was active. The <b>volcano</b> is {{responsible}} for a large Holocene eruption with a <b>Volcano</b> explosivity index 7, {{the largest in the}} Andean Central Volcanic Zone for 5000 years. It is comparable to Santorini and Tambora's large eruptions.|$|E

5|$|Animals {{living on}} the <b>volcano</b> include the {{mountain}} tapir and spectacled bear, {{both of which are}} designated as threatened. Other animals inhabiting the surrounding region include the rufous-fronted parakeet, bearded helmetcrest, and Herveo plump toad. The <b>volcano</b> is home to 27 species of birds endemic to Colombia, with 14 of these species confined to the region around the <b>volcano.</b> 15 bird species in the area are considered threatened.|$|E
5|$|At {{least one}} {{explosive}} subaqueous <b>volcano</b> formed during the Pleistocene epoch. This subaqueous <b>volcano,</b> known as White Horse Bluff, {{is thought to}} have formed in three phases. Its first phase of activity was involved with water, possibly dammed by glacial ice which filled the Clearwater River valley. The <b>volcano</b> heated glacial water then flooded down the volcano's vent, creating violent steam explosions and broken lava fragments. Once the steam explosions had subsided, the broken lava fragments settled back into the glacial water, creating the unvolcano-like form of White Horse Bluff which is mostly made of fragmental volcanic glass called hyaloclastite. The <b>volcano</b> ceased erupting soon after breaching the surface of the glacial water.|$|E
5|$|Blackburn {{first became}} {{interested}} in the possibility of an eruption at Mount St. Helens in March 1980, when a series of earthquakes rocked the <b>volcano.</b> Having already climbed the mountain, he was intrigued by the situation and was eventually assigned to document the activity of the <b>volcano</b> for his outdoor skills and his meticulousness. By May, he had begun camping out at the <b>volcano</b> as a joint project to take pictures of the volcanic phenomena for The Columbian, National Geographic, and the United States Geological Survey.|$|E

5|$|Ciomadul {{is located}} in the southeastern Carpathians, {{at the end of the}} Călimani (Kelemen) – Gurghiu (Görgényi) – Harghita (Hargita) {{volcanic}} chain. The gorge of the Olt River separates Ciomadul from the Harghita Mountains. The towns of Băile Tușnad and Bixad are close to the <b>volcano,</b> and a road leads up the <b>volcano</b> from the southeast and goes past the Mohos swamp to the St. Ana lake. The basement of the <b>volcano</b> is formed by flysch of Cretaceous age.|$|E
5|$|Emanations of {{hydrogen}} sulfide {{have been reported}} around the <b>volcano,</b> preventing the mining of underground sulfur deposits, and the gas is also present in the hot springs. The confirmed presence of sulfur dioxide would indicate hot magma beneath the <b>volcano.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following {{the pattern}} of Hawaiian <b>volcano</b> formation, Mauna Loa would have started as a {{submarine}} <b>volcano,</b> gradually building itself up through underwater eruptions of alkali basalt before emerging from the sea {{through a series of}} surtseyan eruptions about 400,000 years ago. Since then, the <b>volcano</b> has remained active, with a history of effusive and explosive eruptions, including 33 eruptions since the first well-documented eruption in 1843. Although Mauna Loa's activity has been overshadowed in recent years by that of its neighbor Kīlauea, it remains active.|$|E
50|$|Stepovak Bay is a bay {{located on}} the Alaska Peninsula, Alaska, on the Gulf of Alaska. It is framed by the Stepovak Bay group of <b>volcanoes,</b> a chain of 5 cinder cone <b>volcanoes</b> in the Aleutian Arc.

5|$|<b>Volcanoes</b> in Indonesia {{are part}} of the Pacific Ring of Fire. The 150 entries in the list below are grouped into six {{geographical}} regions, four of which belong to the <b>volcanoes</b> of the Sunda Arc trench system.

50|$|Underground and {{submarine}} mud <b>volcanoes</b> {{are also}} famed in Azerbaijan. There {{are more than}} 140 submarine <b>volcanoes</b> in the Caspian Sea. Eight islands in the Baku Archipelago are mud <b>volcanoes</b> by origination. The other kind of mud <b>volcanoes</b> are wells. Their activity can be observed among strata of various ages. According to the information, mud <b>volcanoes</b> initially began their activity in the territory of Azerbaijan 25 million years ago.|$|R
5|$|Geological {{evidence}} shows the Thera <b>volcano</b> erupted numerous times over {{several hundred thousand}} years before the Minoan eruption. In a repeating process, the <b>volcano</b> would violently erupt, then eventually collapse into a roughly circular seawater-filled caldera, with numerous small islands forming the circle. The caldera would slowly refill with magma, building a new <b>volcano,</b> which erupted and then collapsed in an ongoing cyclical process.|$|E
5|$|Hawaiian volcanoes {{follow a}} {{well-established}} {{life cycle of}} growth and erosion. After a new <b>volcano</b> forms, its lava output gradually increases. Height and activity both peak when the <b>volcano</b> is around 500,000 years old and then rapidly decline. Eventually it goes dormant, and eventually extinct. Erosion then weathers the <b>volcano</b> until it again becomes a seamount.|$|E
5|$|Hualālai is {{the third}} most active <b>volcano</b> making up the island of Hawaii, behind Kīlauea and Mauna Loa. Although the two larger volcanos have each erupted over 150times in the last 1,000years, Hualālai has done so but 3times. The {{recurrence}} of activity at the <b>volcano</b> seems to be every 200 to 300years.|$|E
50|$|These <b>volcanoes</b> have erupted mainly lava flows, which descend their slopes. The <b>volcanoes</b> {{range in}} shape from long and narrow to short and stubby. Craters are {{found on the}} <b>volcanoes.</b> Eruptive {{activity}} commenced during the Pleistocene and continued during the Holocene. There is evidence of glaciation on the <b>volcanoes,</b> including moraines.|$|R
50|$|A monogenetic {{volcanic}} {{field is}} a type of volcanic field consisting of a group of small monogenetic <b>volcanoes,</b> each of which erupts only once, as opposed to polygenetic <b>volcanoes,</b> which erupt repeatedly over a period of time. Many monogenetic <b>volcanoes</b> are cinder cones, often with lava flows, such as Parícutin in the Michoacán-Guanajuato volcanic field, which erupted from 1943 to 1952. Some monogenetic <b>volcanoes</b> are small lava shields, such as Rangitoto Island in the Auckland volcanic field. Other monogenetic <b>volcanoes</b> are tuff rings or maars. A monogenetic field typically contains between ten and a hundred <b>volcanoes.</b> The Michoacán-Guanajuato field in Mexico contains more than a thousand <b>volcanoes</b> and is much larger than usual.|$|R

5|$|Incapillo {{is part of}} the Andean Central Volcanic Zone, {{which extends}} through the {{countries}} of Chile, Bolivia, and Argentina and includes six or more Quaternary caldera or ignimbrite systems, about 44 stratovolcanoes, and over 18 smaller centres. One of these stratovolcanoes, Ojos del Salado, is the world's highest <b>volcano.</b> This zone also includes the Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex and the Galan caldera farther south. Incapillo is the southernmost <b>volcano</b> of the Central Volcanic Zone with Pleistocene activity; the next such <b>volcano</b> to the south is Tupungato in the Southern Volcanic Zone at 33° southern latitude.|$|E
5|$|Lava Fork <b>volcano</b> is {{associated}} {{with a small group of}} related volcanoes called the Iskut-Unuk River Cones. This forms part of the much larger Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province, which extends from the Alaska–Yukon border to near the port city of Prince Rupert, British Columbia. Eruptive activity at The <b>Volcano</b> is relatively young compared to most other volcanoes in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province. Geologic studies have shown that The <b>Volcano</b> and its eruptive products were emplaced in the past 400years; this is well after the last glacial period, which ended about 10,000years ago.|$|E
5|$|Licancabur {{has been}} active during the Holocene, after the ice ages. Although no {{historic}} eruptions of the <b>volcano</b> are known, lava flows extending into Laguna Verde have been dated to 13,240 ± 100 BP. The <b>volcano</b> has primarily erupted andesite, with small amounts of dacite and basaltic andesite.|$|E
50|$|The {{group of}} <b>volcanoes</b> {{consists}} of basalt and dacitic lava flows, small shield <b>volcanoes,</b> cinder cones, and lava domes. Altogether, {{there are about}} 40 <b>volcanoes,</b> with the highest peak being Irao-yama.|$|R
5000|$|Mud <b>volcanoes</b> {{are often}} {{associated}} with lava <b>volcanoes,</b> and the typical relationship is that where they are close, the mud <b>volcanoes</b> emit incombustible gases, while the ones further away emit methane.|$|R
50|$|Most Ionian <b>volcanoes</b> {{start as}} steep-sided shield <b>volcanoes.</b> After an eruptive construct-building phase, the central region collapses {{to form a}} caldera. Since steep-sided shield <b>volcanoes</b> have not been {{observed}} inside collapsed calderas, this indicates a failure to reform steep-sided <b>volcanoes</b> after the collapse, which {{can be associated with}} various variables such as change in temperature, eruptive rate, and/or lava composition. Failure to reform shield <b>volcanoes</b> is caused by failure to supply magma through the magma chamber. These interpretations might be a sign that current shield <b>volcanoes</b> will follow this pattern and transform to caldera-forming eruptive sites.|$|R
5|$|Mauna Loa's {{most recent}} {{eruption}} occurred from March24 to April15, 1984. No recent eruptions of the <b>volcano</b> have caused fatalities, but eruptions in 1926 and 1950 destroyed villages, {{and the city}} of Hilo is partly built on lava flows from the late 19th century. Because of the potential hazards it poses to population centers, Mauna Loa is part of the Decade Volcanoes program, which encourages studies of the world's most dangerous volcanoes. Mauna Loa has been monitored intensively by the Hawaiian <b>Volcano</b> Observatory since 1912. Observations of the atmosphere are undertaken at the Mauna Loa Observatory, and of the Sun at the Mauna Loa Solar Observatory, both located near the mountain's summit. Hawaii Volcanoes National Park covers the summit and the southeastern flank of the <b>volcano,</b> and also incorporates Kīlauea, a separate <b>volcano.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pyroclastic {{flows from}} an {{eruption}} would destroy much wildlife about the <b>volcano.</b> Gareloi has historically produced several pyroclastic flows, which can travel extremely fast. Future flows at Gareloi <b>Volcano</b> could travel {{off the island}} into the Pacific Ocean and, if large enough, could fall into the ocean and generate tsunamis, though unlikely.|$|E
5|$|Seismic {{activity}} is {{monitored by the}} USGS Cascades <b>Volcano</b> Observatory in Vancouver, Washington, which issues weekly updates (and daily updates if significant eruptive {{activity is}} occurring at a Cascades <b>volcano).</b>|$|E
