40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of a study into <b>V-ribbed</b> <b>belt</b> noise {{generated}} as a result of tangential belt slip. The results of experimental studies to identify the belt operating conditions associated with belt noise are presented, together with {{the results of}} analytical studies to identify the mechanism of noise generation. It is concluded that tangential slip <b>V-ribbed</b> <b>belt</b> noise generation is controlled only by the amount of slip, and that the mechanism of noise generation is harmonic excitation of the fundamental vibration mode of the belt, with stickÂ¿slip frictional behaviour providing the impetus for the vibratio...|$|E
40|$|A {{new concept}} of the {{balancer}} system for a combustion engine is proposed. The balancer system (Torque Balancer) to reduce the roll vibration of the cylinder-block is composed of sub-flywheel which is driven in reverse to the crankshaft. The sub-flywheel generates the counter torque fluctuation to suppress the cylinder-block roll vibration. The prototype Torque Balancer composed of the alternator and the double <b>V-ribbed</b> <b>belt</b> confirms 10 dB reduction of the cylinder-block roll vibration...|$|E
40|$|Efficient belts {{can provide}} the same {{magnitude}} of energy savings as energy-efficient motors. Therefore, belt drives deserve greater attention, so that their losses should be minimized. The belt drive power losses are a combination of torque losses and speed losses. However, the determination of belt drive behavior in terms of power losses requires extensive experimental investigations. Therefore, in this study, belt slip and torque losses were investigated experimentally with a laboratory constructed test bench. Measurement System Analysis (MSA) was performed in order to investigate the test rig reliability. Special attention was paid for experimental test setup, testing and modeling of torque loss behavior of <b>V-ribbed</b> <b>belt</b> drive systems. Significant design parameters were investigated...|$|E
5000|$|A multi-groove, <b>V-Ribbed,</b> or polygroove <b>belt</b> {{is made up}} of usually between 3 and 24 [...] "V" [...] shaped {{sections}} alongside each other. This gives a thinner belt for {{the same}} drive surface, thus it is more flexible, although often wider. The added flexibility offers an improved efficiency, as less energy is wasted in the internal friction of continually bending the belt. In practice this gain of efficiency causes a reduced heating effect on the belt, and a cooler-running belt lasts longer in service. Belts are commercially available in several sizes, with usually a 'P' (sometimes omitted) and a single letter identifying the pitch between grooves. The 'PK' section with a pitch of 3.56 mm is commonly used for automotive applications.|$|R
