They comprise the Carboniferous Limestone, the overlying Gritstone and the Coal Measures which occur only on the extreme margins of the area and infrequent outcrops of igneous rocks including lavas, tuffs and <b>volcanic</b> <b>vent</b> agglomerates.|$|E
5|$|Several {{types of}} {{volcanic}} eruptions—during which lava, tephra (ash, lapilli, volcanic bombs and volcanic blocks), and assorted gases are expelled from a <b>volcanic</b> <b>vent</b> or fissure—have been distinguished by volcanologists. These are often named after famous volcanoes where {{that type of}} behavior has been observed. Some volcanoes may exhibit only one characteristic type of eruption {{during a period of}} activity, while others may display an entire sequence of types all in one eruptive series.|$|E
5|$|In a {{volcanic}} eruption, lava, tephra (volcanic bombs, lapilli, and ash), and various gases are expelled from a <b>volcanic</b> <b>vent</b> or fissure. While many eruptions only pose dangers to the immediately surrounding area, Earth's largest eruptions {{can have a}} major regional or even global impact, with some affecting the climate and contributing to mass extinctions. Volcanic eruptions can generally be characterized as either explosive eruptions, sudden ejections of rock and ash, or effusive eruptions, relatively gentle outpourings of lava. A separate list is given below for each type.|$|E

50|$|Chemosynthetic {{bacteria}} {{are found in}} benthic marine ecosystems. These organisms are able to feed on hydrogen sulfide in water that comes from <b>volcanic</b> <b>vents.</b> Great concentrations of animals that feed on these {{bacteria are}} found around <b>volcanic</b> <b>vents.</b> For example, there are giant tube worms (Riftia pachyptila) 1.5 m in length and clams (Calyptogena magnifica) 30 cm long.|$|R

5|$|Volcanic ash is also {{produced}} during phreatomagmatic eruptions. During these eruptions fragmentation occurs when magma comes {{into contact with}} bodies of water (such as the sea, lakes and marshes) groundwater, snow or ice. As the magma, which is significantly hotter than the boiling point of water, comes into contact with water an insulating vapor film forms (Leidenfrost effect). Eventually this vapor film will collapse leading to direct coupling of the cold water and hot magma. This increases the heat transfer {{which leads to the}} rapid expansion of water and fragmentation of the magma into small particles which are subsequently ejected from the <b>volcanic</b> <b>vent.</b> Fragmentation causes an increase in contact area between magma and water creating a feedback mechanism, leading to further fragmentation and production of fine ash particles.|$|E
25|$|On {{the south}} side of the Khutzeymateen Inlet north of Prince Rupert, thick basaltic Plinian {{eruption}} tephra deposits are recognized at Crow Lagoon. These volcanics originated from a <b>volcanic</b> <b>vent</b> that remains unidentified. However, existence of volcanic bombs at the Plinian tephra deposits indicates the <b>volcanic</b> <b>vent</b> of its origin is located nearby. The age of these volcanics is unknown but they were deposited throughout the Holocene epoch.|$|E

25|$|Volcanic vents {{composed}} of felsic rocks {{are thought to}} have been located at the iron-bearing Sherman Mine, the former Temagami garbage dump and adjacent to the Milne Townsite. Remnants of a large <b>volcanic</b> <b>vent</b> are present west of Sherman Mine, including the existence of two felsic lava flows that outcrop between Link Lake and Turtle Lake. The aspect of the most extensive felsic lava flow indicates that the <b>volcanic</b> <b>vent</b> they erupted from was adjacent to the western portion of Link Lake. Additionally, differentiation of facies and directions in which the lava traveled exist in course grained, resedimented conglomerate. This suggests that a more prominent structure, perhaps evidence of a prehistoric volcano, existed west of Link Lake. Also, coarsest felsic volcanic fragments occur in feldspar-phyric pyroclastic deposits exposed on the Sherman Mine property, suggesting the approximate location of a <b>volcanic</b> <b>vent.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{threat from}} lava flows in the Garibaldi Belt is minor unless an {{eruption}} {{takes place in}} winter or under or adjacent to areas of glacial ice, such as ice fields. When lava flows over large areas of snow, it creates meltwater. This can produce lahars that could flow further than the associated lavas. If water were to enter a <b>volcanic</b> <b>vent</b> that is erupting basaltic lava, it may create a massive explosive eruption. These explosions are generally more extreme than those during normal basaltic eruptions. Therefore, the existence of water, snow, or glacial ice at a <b>volcanic</b> <b>vent</b> would {{increase the risk of}} an eruption having a large impact on the surrounding region. Subglacial eruptions have also caused catastrophic glacial outburst floods.|$|E
25|$|Several north-trending felsic dikes, {{composed}} {{mainly of}} feldspar and quartz-feldspar, are located {{north of the}} former Temagami garbage dump. These dikes are not known to extend across the Link Lake Deformation Zone, suggesting that they might represent the feeders of a minor <b>volcanic</b> <b>vent,</b> manifest now by felsic lava flows. Because certain lithologies can be correlated through the Link Lake Deformation Zone, {{it is unlikely that}} the lack of felsic dikes south of the former town dump area is an expression of displacement along the deformation zone.|$|E

40|$|The Sverrefjell and Sigurdfjell eruptive {{centers in}} the Bockfjord Volcanic Complex (BVC) on Svalbard (Norway) formed by {{subglacial}} eruptions ca. 1 Ma ago. These eruptive centers carry ubiquitous magnesian carbonate deposits including dolomitemagnesite globules {{similar to those in}} the Martian meteorite ALH 84001. Carbonates in mantle xenoliths are dominated by ALH 84001 type carbonate globules that formed during quenching of CO 2 -rich mantle fluids. Lava hosted carbonates include ALH 84001 type carbonate globules occurring throughout lava vesicles and microfractures and massive carbonate deposits associated with vertical <b>volcanic</b> <b>vents.</b> Massive carbonates include < or equal 5 cm thick magnesite deposits protruding downwards into clear blue ice within <b>volcanic</b> <b>vents</b> and carbonate cemented lava breccias associated with <b>volcanic</b> <b>vents.</b> Carbonate cements comprise layered deposits of calcite, dolomite, huntite, magnesite and aragonite associated with ALH 84001 type carbonate globules lining lava vesicles.

25|$|Derrick Cave {{began as}} an open channel of lava flowing south from a large <b>volcanic</b> <b>vent.</b> Eventually, a lava crust {{solidified}} {{over the top of}} the flowing lava. This formed a roof over the river, enclosing it in a lava tunnel or tube. When the eruption from the vent stopped, the lava drained out of the tube leaving a lava tube cave behind. After the cave cooled, several sections of its roof collapsed. These collapsed ceiling sections provided entrances to both the uphill (northeast) and downhill (southwest) parts of the cave.|$|E
25|$|Rilles on the Moon {{sometimes}} {{resulted from}} the formation of localized lava channels. These generally fall into three categories, consisting of sinuous, arcuate, or linear shapes. By following these meandering rilles back to their source, they often lead to an old <b>volcanic</b> <b>vent.</b> One of the most notable sinuous rilles is the Vallis Schröteri feature, located in the Aristarchus plateau along {{the eastern edge of}} Oceanus Procellarum. An example of a sinuous rille exists at the Apollo 15 landing site, Rima Hadley, located {{on the rim of the}} Imbrium Basin. Based on observations from the mission, it is generally believed that this rille was formed by volcanic processes, a topic long debated before the mission took place.|$|E
25|$|Flow-dominated tuyas and {{the absence}} of {{subglacial}} fragmental deposits are two uncommon glaciovolcanic features in the Garibaldi chain. This is due to their different lava compositions and decline of direct lava-water contact during volcanic activity. The lava composition of these volcanic edifies changes their structure because eruption temperatures are lower than those associated with basaltic activity and lava containing silica increases thickness and glass differentiation temperatures. As a result, subglacial volcanoes that erupt silicic content melt less qualities of ice and are not as likely to contain water close to the <b>volcanic</b> <b>vent.</b> This forms volcanoes with structures that display their relationship with the regional glaciation. The surrounding landscape also changes the flow of meltwater, favouring lava to pond within valleys dominated by glacial ice. And if the edifice is eroded, it could change the prominence of fragmental glaciovolcanic deposits as well.|$|E

25|$|At {{least three}} phases of eruptive {{activity}} {{have been recognized}} at Mount Fee. The only exposed remnant of Fee's earliest volcanic activity is a minor outcrop of pyroclastic rock. This is evidence of explosive eruptions during Fee's eruptive history, {{as well as its}} first volcanic event. The second volcanic event produced a sequence of volcanic rocks on Fee's eastern flank. This volcanic material was likely deposited when a sequence of lava flows and broken lava fragments erupted from a <b>volcanic</b> <b>vent</b> and moved down the flanks during the construction of the ancestral Mount Fee. Following extensive dissection, renewed volcanism produced a viscous series of lavas on its northern flank. The U-shaped crevice separating the two main summits of Mount Fee separates this lava flow from the main volcanic ridge. The conduit from which these lava flows originated was likely vertical in structure and intruded through older rocks deposited during Fee's earlier volcanic events. This volcanic event was also followed by a period of erosion, and likely one or more glacial periods. Extensive erosion following the last volcanic event at Mount Fee has created the rugged north-south trending ridge that currently forms a prominent landmark.|$|E
25|$|Mount Cayley is {{surrounded}} by smaller volcanic features and volcanoes called satellite cones, also known as parasitic cones. These formed due to Cayley's <b>volcanic</b> <b>vent</b> being heavily blocked by cooled and solidified lava, causing magma to force out of the lines of weakness {{at the side of}} the volcano, forming a satellite cone. They commonly derive material from the same source as the initial volcano, although it may have its own magma chamber system. Similar volcanic formations are found elsewhere in the Cascade Volcanic Arc, including Mount Shasta in Northern California, which consists of four overlapping volcanic cones and several satellite cones, including Black Butte and Shastina. The small satellite cones at Mount Cayley become progressively younger from south to north, ranging in age from Pliocene-to-Pleistocene which forms a volcanic field. Because these features are related to the stratovolcano of Mount Cayley, the volcanic field is commonly referred to as the Mount Cayley volcanic field. The high elevations of the volcanic field, coupled with its cluster of mostly high altitude, non-overlapping vents, have resulted in several eruptions under the Powder Mountain Icefield, creating many ice-contact features. Due to the volcanic field's remoteness, it has not been studied or mapped in detail. As a result, the number and age of eruptions remains unknown.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{southeast}} of Mount Cayley lies Mount Fee, an extensively eroded volcano containing a north-south trending ridge. It {{is one of}} the older volcanic features in the central Garibaldi chain. Its volcanics are undated, but its large amount of dissection and evidence of glacai ice overriding the volcano indicates that it formed more than 75,000years ago before the Wisconsinan Glaciation. Therefore, volcanism at Mount Fee does not display evidence of interaction with glacial ice. The remaining product from Fee's earliest volcanic activity is a minor portion of pyroclastic rock. This is evidence of explosive volcanism from Fee's eruptive history, as well as its first volcanic event. The second volcanic event produced a sequence of lavas and breccias on the eastern flank of the main ridge. These volcanics were likely placed when a sequence of lava flows and broken lava fragments erupted from a <b>volcanic</b> <b>vent</b> and moved down the flanks during the construction of a large volcano. Following extensive dissection, renewed volcanism produced a viscous series of lava flows forming its narrow, flat-topped, steep-sided northern limit and the northern end of the main ridge. The conduit for which these lava flows originated from was likely vertical in structure and intruded through older volcanics deposited during Fee's earlier volcanic events. This volcanic event was also followed by a period of erosion, and likely one or more glacial periods. Extensive erosion following the last volcanic event at Mount Fee has created the rugged north-south trending ridge that currently forms a prominent landmark.|$|E

500|$|This first {{recorded}} eruption of Cerro Azul was effusive, and formed the <b>volcanic</b> <b>vent</b> at Quizapu. Hornblende–dacite lava erupted with small masses of tephra, {{which had been}} degassed shortly before the eruption. Lava flowed over the Estero Barroso Valley and westward into the Río Blanquillo Valley. By November 28, the volcano appeared at rest, and the herdsman returned {{to the place of}} first observation. There, they found a blocky lava field. The lava was still hot, fuming and crackling with gas and flame. Fascinated by the volcano, Ignacy Domeyko traveled to Chile to study the field and found its width to be [...] By 1992 the field had grown to twice that size.|$|E
500|$|Lying in {{the middle}} of the Mount Cayley {{volcanic}} field is a subglacial volcano named Slag Hill. At least two geological units compose the edifice. Slag Hill proper consists of andesite lava flows and small amounts of pyroclastic rock. Lying on the western portion of Slag Hill is a lava flow that likely erupted less than 10,000years ago due to the lack of features indicating volcano-ice interactions. The Slag Hill flow-dominated tuya [...] northeast of Slag Hill proper consists of a flat-topped, steep-sided pile of andesite. It protrudes through remnants of volcanic material erupted from Slag Hill proper, but it represents a separate <b>volcanic</b> <b>vent</b> due to its geographical appearance. This small subglacial volcano possibly formed between 25,000and 10,000years ago throughout the waning stages of the Fraser Glaciation.|$|E
500|$|Quizapu, which formed {{during the}} 1846 eruption, {{is the most}} {{prominent}} crater. It {{is also known as}} Cerro del Medio ("Middle Hill") or Volcan Nuevo ("New Volcano"). The <b>volcanic</b> <b>vent</b> formed during an effusive eruption involving hornblende–dacite flows accompanied by tephra, and the crater was excavated by phreatic and Strombolian eruptions between 1907 and 1932. Pent-up pressure within the volcano spawned an enormous Plinian eruption in 1932. The volume of lava ejected during this single event is roughly equal to that ejected {{during the rest of the}} eruptive history at Quizapu, since its formation in 1846. Although [...] of material was ejected, no subsidence was detected from the removal of magma. Because of aerodynamic drag, a Plinian eruption excavates a circular crater. As the earlier eruptions had already formed an approximately circular caldera, the Plinian eruption was able to proceed efficiently, with minimal drag and minimal reshaping of the crater.|$|E
50|$|Crater chains {{seen on the}} Moon often radiate from larger craters, and in {{such cases}} {{are thought to be}} either caused by {{secondary}} impacts of the larger crater's ejecta or by <b>volcanic</b> <b>venting</b> activity along a rift.|$|R
