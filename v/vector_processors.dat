2500|$|Faulkner and Randall {{explained}} {{the game was}} still utilizing the Omen Engine, with Faulkner saying of programming for the PlayStation 2 [...] "The PS2 is certainly good at pushing polys, no doubt about that. And the two <b>vector</b> <b>processors</b> can handle the physics and geometry we have with room to spare. The trick is the video memory, mainly. All of the cool visual features, like a high-res framebuffer, FSAA and high-res textures all {{take a lot of}} video memory. It's a real juggling act trying to get it to do all that at once." [...] Faulkner explained [...] "the PS2 math capabilities are like Intel's SSE, but on steroids. The math processors can be used to optimize any kind of math operations, which, in a 3D game, means a lot. So they will basically be used to speed up a lot of the 3D transformations and lighting." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a June {{interview}} with GameSpot, Traveller's Tales revealed the game {{had been in}} development for over three years, with them funding the project themselves, long before Midway got involved. They explained the game utilises a game engine specifically designed for Haven, which allows smooth transition from third-person gameplay to piloting a vehicle. The engine also powers the cutscenes, allowing the camera to move and sweep around the landscape of a level, giving the player {{an idea of the}} route they have to take. Landscapes are fractally generated using the PlayStation 2's <b>vector</b> <b>processors,</b> which allows for considerable draw distance. The game also features night and day cycles and alternating weather patterns, such as randomly occurring rain showers (which prompt Haven to pull his hood up when outdoors). The developers were also keen to stress the game features no loading times; [...] "Traveller's Tales intends for the game's loading to be invisible to players after the initial startup, thanks to carefully managed memory usage and constant streaming." [...] They also revealed that after the PlayStation 2 launch, the game would be released for the Game Boy Advance as well as GameCube and Xbox.|$|E
2500|$|As first {{reported}} by Wired on October 17, 2007, an interesting application of using PlayStation 3 in a cluster configuration was implemented by Astrophysicist Gaurav Khanna, from the Physics department of University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, who replaced time used on supercomputers with {{a cluster of}} eight PlayStation 3s. [...] Subsequently, {{the next generation of}} this machine, now called the PlayStation 3 Gravity Grid, uses a network of 16 machines, and exploits the Cell processor for the intended application which is binary black hole coalescence using perturbation theory. In particular, the cluster performs astrophysical simulations of large supermassive black holes capturing smaller compact objects and has generated numerical data that has been published multiple times in the relevant scientific research literature. The Cell processor version used by the PlayStation 3 has a main CPU and 6 SPEs available to the user, giving the Gravity Grid machine a net of 16 general-purpose processors and 96 <b>vector</b> <b>processors.</b> [...] The machine has a one-time cost of $9,000 to build and is adequate for black-hole simulations which would otherwise cost $6,000 per run on a conventional supercomputer. [...] The black hole calculations are not memory-intensive and are highly localizable, and so are well-suited to this architecture. Khanna claims that the cluster's performance exceeds that of a 100+ Intel Xeon core based traditional Linux cluster on his simulations. The PS3 Gravity Grid gathered significant media attention through 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT- To {{maximize}} the available performance {{is always a}} goal in microprocessor design. In this paper a new technique has been implemented which exploits the advantage of both superscalar and vector processing technique in a proposed processor called Supervector <b>processor.</b> <b>Vector</b> <b>processor</b> operates on array of data called vector and can greatly improve certain task such as numerical simulation and tasks which requires huge number crunching. On other hand superscalar processor issues multiple instructions per cycle which can enhance the throughput. To implement parallelism multiple vector instructions were issued and executed per cycle in superscalar fashion. Case study {{has been done on}} various benchmarks to compare the performance of proposed supervector processor architecture with superscalar and <b>vector</b> <b>processor</b> architecture. Trimaran Framework has been used in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed supervector processor scheme.
