5|$|Brentwood Academy {{sued the}} {{association}} over this action. Brentwood {{argued that the}} enforcement of the rule constituted state action which they claimed <b>violated</b> the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The school asserted that their due process rights had been <b>violated</b> because there were no evidentiary hearings to determine the validity of the claim that they inappropriately recruited football players. Further, they argued that the rule <b>violated</b> their freedom of speech because it restricted the ways the Academy could recruit. In July 1998, the District Court agreed with this argument and granted summary judgement to the Academy, while enjoining the association from enforcing the rule. A year later, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the lower court's decision, finding that the actions of the association did not constitute 'state action'. The United States Supreme Court granted certiorari of the case to review this question.|$|E

The case arose when Simon Glik, a private citizen, filmed Boston, Massachusetts, police officers making an arrest in a public park. When the officers observed that Glik was recording the arrest, they arrested him and he was subsequently charged with wiretapping, disturbing the peace, and aiding in the escape of a prisoner.

From the latest upper limits of B(B^+_u→π^+ℓ^+ℓ^-) and B(B^ 0 _d→ℓ^+ℓ^-), we have derived new upper bounds on the relevant R-parity <b>violating</b> couplings products, which {{are stronger than}} the existing ones. Using the constrained parameter space, we present the R-parity <b>violating</b> effects on the branching ratios and the forward-backward asymmetries of these decays. We find that B(B^ 0 _d→ℓ^+ℓ^-) and B(B^+_u →ρ^+ℓ^+ℓ^-) could be enhanced several orders by the R-parity <b>violating</b> sneutrino and squark exchanges, respectively. The R-parity <b>violating</b> effects on the dilepton invariant mass spectra of B^+_u→π^+ℓ^+ℓ^-, ρ^+ℓ^+ℓ^- and the normalized forward-backward asymmetry A_FB(B^+_u→π^+ℓ^+ℓ^-) and A_FB(B^+_u →ρ^+ℓ^+ℓ^-) are studied in detail.
