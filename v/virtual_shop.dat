Certain characters, including Tinker Bell, can not be played inside Playset mode and only in Toybox mode. Toybox mode supports local and online multiplayer. In Toybox mode, players are given a [...] "Magic Wand," [...] which can be used to place items around the sandbox, customize items and access the Toy Shop (a <b>virtual</b> <b>shop</b> where players can purchase new items for use in the Toybox.) The Magic Wand {{can also be used to}} set commands on objects, using [...] "Game Logic." [...] Creativi-Toys, objects in the Toybox, that can be set to use Game Logic return in the game, with 75 new additions. For example, a player can set a party cannon to shoot confetti if they connect the cannon to a button. Players can also restrict access to certain packs and tools in the Toybox, including the Magic Wand. The Toy Shop replaces the Toy Spinner from the first game. Items that can be used in Toybox mode can be unlocked through Playset mode. In an attempt to make Toybox building easier, the game will feature improved and enhanced Toybox editor tools (including in-game [...] "brushes", that will automatically create scenery for players, including cities, dungeons and race tracks). Templates, pre-built mini-games when placed into a world or [...] "Auto Creators" [...] are also present in the game. Templates range from Cliff-side beat 'em up Battle Arenas (similar to Super Smash Bros.) to obstacle courses. Players can then tweak and change Templates to their liking. In order to add some Templates into the Toybox, players must decide the length, width and height of a box, that will house and generate the desired structure. A Challenge Maker has also be implemented into the game, allowing players to create structured games. Result screens were also added for competitive play Toyboxes. A new feature introduced in Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes is the Text Creator, which allows players to write their own text bubbles in the Toybox. All text, however, must be filter and moderated through a safe chat server. The game also introduces the Toy Box Game Maker, a tool that can restrict access to certain actions, including the use of the Magic Wand. An undo button has also been implemented into the game. Objects from the first game can be unlocked in Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes by placing a Disney Infinity Playset piece on the Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes base. will also feature automated builders, that can be dropped into the Toybox and generate worlds for players. Automated builders include Eve from WALL-E and Sultan from Aladdin. In the Toybox mode players will also be able to create interior areas, a feature absent from the first game. Interior areas (styled in-game as INteriors) can also be themed to certain characters. More than twenty rooms can be added inside an INteriors. Multiple INteriors can be connected through doorways inside buildings.|$|E

Software platforms were custom written to handle money collection and transfer, connecting caller and sex worker though neither could see anything but the platform's phone number, and metering the connection. Details vary significantly from one platform to another, but the provider may be given a personal page on the platform to use however she (sometimes he) wishes.

40|$|Existing {{e-commerce}} applications {{on the web}} {{provide the}} users a relatively simple, browser-based interface to access available products. Customers are not provided with the same shopping experience as they would in an actual store or mall. This experience, however, {{can be achieved by}} the creation of a <b>virtual</b> <b>shopping</b> mall environment, simulating most of the actual shopping user interactions. The virtual mall brings together the services and products of various vendors. Users can navigate through the <b>virtual</b> <b>shopping</b> malls, adding items of interest into a <b>virtual</b> <b>shopping</b> cart, and perform searches assisted by 'intelligent agents'. A Collaborative Virtual Environment (CVE) can realize a sophisticated <b>virtual</b> <b>shopping</b> application. In such a CVE, a large number of potential users may interact with each other. In this paper, vCOM, a VRML and Java 3 D-based prototype is presented, which permits users to navigate around virtual e-commerce worlds and perform collaborative shopping and intelligent searches with the assistance of software agents, in order to find the products and services of interest to them. They can then negotiate with sales agents to bargain for the best possible price and then make a secure buying transaction. The virtual mall prototype also allows the user to communicate with an 'intelligent shopping assistant' using simple voice commands. This assistant interacts with the shopper using voice synthesis and helps him/her use the interface to efficiently navigate in the mall. Real-time interactions between the entities in this shared environment are implemented over the High Level Architecture (HLA), an IEEE standard for distributed simulations and modeling.
