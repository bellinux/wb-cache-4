40|$|Background: To compare {{cost and}} quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained by {{influenza}} vaccination {{with or without}} pneumococcal vaccination in the elderly living in long-term care facilities (LTCFs). Methods: Cost-effectiveness analysis based on Markov modelling over 5 years, from a Hong Kong public health provider's perspective, on a hypothetical cohort of LTCF residents aged ≥ 65 years. Benefit-cost ratio (BCR) and net present value (NPV) of two <b>vaccination</b> <b>strategies</b> versus no <b>vaccination</b> were estimated. The cost and QALYs gained by two <b>vaccination</b> <b>strategies</b> were compared by Student's t-test in probabilistic sensitivity analysis (10 000 Monte Carlo simulations). Results: Both <b>vaccination</b> <b>strategies</b> had high BCRs and NPVs (6. 39 and US$ 334 for influenza vaccination; 5. 10 and US$ 332 for influenza plus pneumococcal vaccination). In base case analysis, the two <b>vaccination</b> <b>strategies</b> were expected to cost less and gain higher QALYs than no vaccination. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the cost of combined vaccination and influenza vaccination was significantly lower (p< 0. 001) {{than the cost of}} no <b>vaccination.</b> Both <b>vaccination</b> <b>strategies</b> gained significantly higher (p< 0. 001) QALYs than no vaccination. The QALYs gained by combined vaccination were significantly higher (p= 0. 030) than those gained by influenza vaccination alone. The total cost of combined vaccination was significantly lower (p= 0. 011) than that of influenza vaccination. Conclusion: Influenza vaccination with or without pneumococcal vaccination appears to be less costly with higher QALYs gained than no vaccination, over a 5 -year period, for elderly people living in LTCFs {{from the perspective of a}} Hong Kong public health organisation. Combined vaccination was more likely to gain higher QALYs with lower total cost than influenza vaccination alone. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

A cost-effectiveness analysis of varicella <b>vaccination</b> <b>strategies,</b> using the Latium region in Italy as a case study, was undertaken.

However, experience in Italy with non-compulsory vaccinations has shown this is difficult to achieve. Consequently, eradication of the disease is not seen as an attainable short-term goal. For mass varicella vaccination to be successful, it must be run at a national as well as regional level in combination with education programmes, and a reliable surveillance system.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} a general {{periodic}} vaccination {{has been applied}} to control the spread and transmission of an infectious disease with latency. An SEIRS epidemic model with general periodic <b>vaccination</b> <b>strategy</b> is analysed. We suppose that the contact rate has period T and the vaccination function has period LT, where L is an integer. Also we apply this strategy in a model with seasonal variation in the contact rate. Both the <b>vaccination</b> <b>strategy</b> and the contact rate are general time dependent periodic functions. Also the same SEIRS models have been examined for a mixed <b>vaccination</b> <b>strategy</b> composed of both of the time dependent periodic <b>vaccination</b> <b>strategy</b> and the conventional one. A key parameter of the paper is a conjectured value Rc 0 for the basic reproduction number. Rsup 0 and R inf 0 are respectively upper and lower bounds for Rc 0.

40|$|Cervical {{cancer and}} other human papillomavirus- (HPV-) related cancers are preventable, but {{preventive}} measures implemented in developing countries and especially in low-income rural regions have not been effective. Cervical cancer burden derived from sexually transmitted HPV infections is the heaviest in developing countries, and {{a dramatic increase in}} the number of cervical cancer cases is predicted, if no intervention is implemented in the near future. HPV vaccines offer an efficient way to prevent related cancers. Recently implemented school-based HPV vaccination demonstration programmes can help tackle the challenges linked with vaccine coverage, and access to vaccination and health services, but prevention strategies need to be modified according to regional characteristics. In urban regions WHO-recommended <b>vaccination</b> <b>strategies</b> might be enough to significantly reduce HPV-related disease burden, but in the rural regions additional <b>vaccination</b> <b>strategies,</b> vaccinating both sexes rather than only females when school attendance is the highest and applying a two-dose regime, need to be considered.

Vets appear to group farmers into three ‘character types’. This characterisation influences the vet–farmer relationship and how the vet communicates with the farmer. Vets required evidence of disease or a risk of disease as a motivator to advise vaccination. However, this seemed to be sometimes overruled by a risk-averse attitude; resulting in vaccination being advised ‘just in case’. Crucially, the need for resources to support and build on the vet–farmer relationship is highlighted as an area requiring further exploration in order to optimise <b>vaccination</b> <b>strategies</b> on farm...|$|R

Methods: A systematic research of studies was conducted via the United States National Library of Medicine and the National Institutes of Health Medical Database (PubMed) and Google Scholar database.

A systematic review of literature was conducted. The effectiveness of rubella vaccination strategies on the control and elimination of rubella and CRS incidence was used as primary inclusion criteria. Results: 5 articles were selected according to inclusion criteria. They were two cohort studies, two ecological studies, one mathematical modeling study. From the experience in Canada, around 99 % decline of rubella and CRS incidence happened after <b>vaccination</b> <b>strategy</b> with selective approach for children. However, it led to a shift of infection to susceptible groups, and couldn’t interrupt rubella virus circulation. A combined vaccination with adults could control CRS incidence but was not effective for CRS elimination.
