60|$|The intropulsive force, {{that sends}} the {{ossification}} inward {{as to the}} centre, is reserved for a yet higher step, and this we find embodied {{in the class of}} fishes. Even here, however, the process still seems imperfect, and (as it were) initiatory. The skeleton has left the surface, indeed, but the bones approach to the nature of gristle. To feel the truth of this, we need only compare the most perfect bone of a fish with the thigh-bones of the mammalia, and the distinctness with which the latter manifest the co-presence of the magnetic power in its solid parietes, of the electrical in its branching arteries, and of the third greatest power, viz., the qualitative and interior, in its marrow. The senses of fish are more distinct than those of insects. Thus, the intensity of its sense of smell has been placed beyond doubt, and rises in the extent of its sphere far beyond the irritable sense, or the feeling, in insects. I say the feeling, not the touch; for the touch seems, as it were, a supervention to the feeling, a perfection given to it by the reaction of the higher powers. As the feeling of the insect, in subtlety and <b>virtual</b> <b>distance,</b> rises above the solitary sense of taste(16) in the mollusca, so does the smell of the fish rise above the feeling of the insect. In the fish, likewise, the eyes are single and moveable, while it is remarkable that the only insect that possesses this latter privilege, is an inhabitant of the waters. Finally, here first, unequivocally, and on a large scale, (for I pretend not to control the freedom, in which the necessity of Nature is rooted, by the precise limits of a system,)—here first, Nature exhibits, in the power of sensibility, the consummation of those vital forms (the nisus formativi) the adequate and the sole measure of which is to be sought for in their several organic products. But as if a weakness of exhaustion had attended this advance in the same moment it was made, Nature seems necessitated to fall back, and re-exert herself on the lower ground which she had before occupied, that of the vital magnetism, or the power of reproduction. The intensity of this latter power in the fishes, is shown both in their voracity and in the number of their eggs, which we are obliged to calculate by weight, not by tale. There is an equal intensity both of the immanent and the projective reproduction, in which, if we take in the comparative number of individuals in each species, and likewise the different intervals between the acts, the fish (it is probable) would be found to stand in a similar relation to the insect, as the insect, in the latter point, stands to the system of vegetation. Meantime, the fish sinks a step below the insect, in the mode and circumstances of impregnation. To this we will venture to add, the predominance of length, as the form of growth in so large a proportion of the known orders of fishes, and not less of their rectilineal path of motion. In all other respects, the correspondence combined with the progress in individuation, is striking in the whole detail. Thus the eye, in addition to its moveability, has besides acquired a saline moisture in its higher development, as accordant with the life of its element. Add to these the glittering covering in both, the splendour of the scales in the one answering to the brilliant plates in the other,—the luminous reservoirs of the fire-flies,—the phosphorescence and electricity of many fishes,—the same analogs of moral qualities, in their rapacity, boldness, modes of seizing their prey by surprise,—their gills, as presenting the intermediate state between the spiracula of the grade next below, and the lungs of the step next above, both extremes of which seem combined in the structure of birds and of their quill-feathers; but above all, the convexity of the crystalline lens, so much greater than in birds, quadrupeds, and man, and seeming to collect, in one powerful organ, the hundred-fold microscopic facettes of the insect’s light organs; and it will not be easy to resist the conviction, that the same power is at work in both, and reappears under higher auspices. The intention of Nature is repeated; but, as was to have been expected, with two main differences.|$|E

Furthermore, interindividual differences and intraindividual stabilities can be found among participants, and neither the three different virtual environments nor the metric aid improved depth estimations.

40|$|Mentoring {{can enhance}} an {{employee}} 2 ̆ 7 s career development and advancement but traditional face-to-face mentoring {{has become less}} relevant because of globalization, increased employee mobility and technology-enabled work. A new mentoring model enabled by technology has emerged {{to meet the needs}} of today 2 ̆ 7 s complex, fast changing global workplace. Although e-mentoring has several advantages over traditional mentoring, the absence of regular face-to-face interactions requires different strategies to develop an effective mentoring relationship. Moreover, additional complexities arise when this virtual mentoring is global. This research utilizes the construct of <b>virtual</b> <b>distance,</b> the 2 ̆ 2 psychological separation 2 ̆ 2 that has been found to impact performance outcomes of geographically dispersed, technology mediated teams (Sobel Lojeski, 2006; Sobel Lojeski 2 ̆ 6 Reilly, 2008; Sobel Lojeski, 2010) to understand the effectiveness of global e-mentorships. Research results support the hypothesis that <b>virtual</b> <b>distance</b> is negatively related to mentorship effectiveness measured as mentor and mentee satisfaction with mentorship outcomes and perception of impact of mentoring on the mentee 2 ̆ 7 s career. Several enablers were also identified as having potential to mitigate <b>virtual</b> <b>distance,</b> thereby improving e-mentorship effectiveness. Three of the four enablers investigated were found to be significant - mentor-mentee matching, mentorship goal clarity and technology usage, defined as partners 2 ̆ 7 access to and comfort with using communication technology. The relationship between cultural intelligence, as measured by Van Dyne et al. (2102) and mentor-mentee matching was investigated given the cross-cultural nature of the e-mentorships and found to be significant. Contrary to hypothesis, trust was not found to moderate the relationship between <b>virtual</b> <b>distance</b> and mentorship effectiveness. However, those mentors and mentees who stayed in contact after the conclusion of the formal mentoring program showed stronger relationships between <b>virtual</b> <b>distance</b> and mentorship effectiveness and partner match and <b>virtual</b> <b>distance.</b> This work makes an important contribution to the literature beyond the application to e-mentoring since one-on-one virtual collaboration is also an essential component of effective e-leadership...|$|E

40|$|Islands, {{especially}} smaller ones, {{are characterized}} by discontinuity of space and are considered {{as some of the}} least accessible areas. In this paper, we seek to shed light on the accessibility problems that islands face {{from the point of view}} of island residents. This shift in emphasis considers additional aspects to accessibility that include the availability of connections to access services required to cover the needs of island residents and the different destinations where these may be available, and the time that one may have to spend to get to these destinations in order to use these services. An alternative measure of accessibility is proposed, based on the time required to travel; this is then applied to three different Greek islands in the Aegean Sea. The accessibility of the residents of these islands to selected services is compared with that of settlements in continental Greece of similar population and distance to the capital Athens. The findings clearly demonstrate the adversities that island residents have to face, especially for smaller islands, where accessing selected services may require as many as four destinations, with <b>virtual</b> <b>distances</b> 4 to 6 times longer than ‘real distances’...|$|R
