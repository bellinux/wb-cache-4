40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the presence of Salmonella sp. serovars in mesenteric lymph nodes of swine as well as the spread potential of the agent during slaughter and inspection activities. Animals were bred in confinement and slaughtered in officially inspected facilities in western Parana, Brazil. Thefollowing samples were collected in five replications, at different moments of the slaughter process: 30 chains of mesenteric lymph nodes; 12 swabs of white <b>viscera</b> <b>inspection</b> tables; eight swabs of knives used in lymph nodes inspection; and four swabs of gloves of theinspection staff. Microbiological analysis of the lymph nodes of 150 animals showed Salmonella sp in 17. 3 % (26 / 150) of them. The agent was also isolated in 5. 0 % (2 / 40) of the knives, and in 28. 3 % (17 / 60) of the white <b>viscera</b> <b>inspection</b> tables. None of the gloves was positive(0 / 20). In conclusion, Salmonella serovars from mesenteric lymph nodes and different surfaces that get in contact with slaughtered animals show the agent´s spread potential and consequently cross-contamination during the slaughter process...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{relationship}} between tail lesions, cold carcass weight and viscera condemnations in an Irish abattoir. The following data were collected at the evisceration point from every 3 rd pig slaughtered over 7 days: farm identification, sex, tail lesion score, <b>viscera</b> <b>inspection</b> outcome and cold carcass weight. Tail lesions were scored according to a 5 point scale. Disease lesions responsible for lung (pleurisy, pneumonia and abscess), heart (pericarditis) and liver (ascariasis) condemnation were recorded based on the decision of the veterinary inspector. Data on 3, 143 pigs from 61 batches were available. The relationship between disease lesions, tail lesion score and cold carcass weight was studied at individual carcass level, whereas the relationship between disease lesions and tail lesion score was studied at both carcass and batch level. Tail lesions (score ≥ 1) were found in 72 % of the study population, with 2. 3 % affected by severe tail lesions (scores ≥ 3). Pleurisy (13. 7 %) followed by pneumonia (10. 4 %) showed the highest prevalence, whereas the prevalence of ascariasis showed the greatest variation between batches (0 to 75 %). Tail lesion score, pleurisy, pleuropneumonia and pericarditis were associated with reductions in carcass cold weight (P ≤ 0. 05) ranging from 3 to 6. 6 kg. Tail lesion score was associated with condemnations for pleurisy, pneumonia and pleuropneumonia (P ≤ 0. 05) at a batch level. Veterinary inspector shift was associated with condemnations for pneumonia, pleuropneumonia and pericarditis (P ≤ 0. 05) at a carcass level and with pneumonia at a batch level. Sex was not associated with viscera condemnations but males were more likely to be affected by tail lesions. The relationship between overall tail lesion score and the lung diseases at batch level supports the relationship between poor health and poor welfare of pigs on farms. The inclusion of tail lesion scores at post mortem meat inspection should be considered as a health and welfare diagnostic tool...|$|E
