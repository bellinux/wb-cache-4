This means from a thermodynamic point of view, that this system is a Constant Volume and <b>Variable</b> <b>Pressure</b> system. This causes some operational problems to the compressors and turbines operating on them, so the pressure variations have to be kept below a certain limit, as do the stresses induced on the storage vessels.|$|E
25|$|A {{scanning}} {{electron microscope}} (SEM) {{is a type of}} electron microscope that produces images of a sample by scanning the surface with a focused beam of electrons. The electrons interact with atoms in the sample, producing various signals that contain information about the sample's surface topography and composition. The electron beam is scanned in a raster scan pattern, and the beam's position is combined with the detected signal to produce an image. SEM can achieve resolution better than 1 nanometer. Specimens can be observed in high vacuum in conventional SEM, or in low vacuum or wet conditions in <b>variable</b> <b>pressure</b> or environmental SEM, and at a wide range of cryogenic or elevated temperatures with specialized instruments.|$|E

In order to monitor a radon signal due to <b>variable</b> <b>pressures</b> and rock stresses {{we use a}} natural laboratory under a reservoir of the Vianden (Luxembourg) pumping storage power plant. Depending on energy demands, the artificial reservoirs {{at the top of}} a hill experience daily variations in water levels of up to 16 meters, thus exerting <b>variable</b> <b>pressures</b> on the underlying rocks. Radon concentrations are continuously measured in boreholes drilled into the bedrock under water reservoir. We observe some very strong variations in transient radon concentrations induced by variations of water level. The reservoir consists of two independent reservoirs that were emptied individually for some period of time. The observed radon pattern depends on the location of the boreholes under the reservoir and is different if both basins are working together, or if one of the reservoirs is empty. The observed patterns can be accounted for by variable pathways of fluids, fluid overpressure and a dynamic flow in cracks...|$|R
40|$|Accurate breath {{detection}} {{is crucial}} in sleep and respiratory physiology research and in several clinical settings. However, this process is technically challenging due to measurement and physiological artifacts and other factors such as variable leaks in the breathing circuit. Recently developed techniques to quantify the multiple causes of obstructive sleep apnea, require intermittent changes in airway pressure applied to a breathing mask. This presents an additional unique challenge for breath detection. Traditional algorithms often require drift correction. However, this is an empirical operation potentially prone to human error. This paper presents a new algorithm for breath detection during <b>variable</b> mask <b>pressures</b> in awake and sleeping humans based on physiological landmarks detected in the airflow or epiglottic pressure signal (Pepi). The algorithms were validated using simulated data from a mathematical model and against the standard visual detection approach in 4 healthy individuals and 6 patients with sleep apnea during <b>variable</b> mask <b>pressure</b> conditions. Using the flow signal, the algorithm correctly identified 97. 6 % of breaths with a mean difference±SD in the onsets of respiratory phase compared to expert visual detection of 23 ± 89 ms for inspiration and 6 ± 56 ms for expiration during wakefulness and 10 ± 74 ms for inspiration and 3 ± 28 ms for expiration with <b>variable</b> mask <b>pressures</b> during sleep. Using the Pepi signal, the algorithm correctly identified 89 % of the breaths with accuracy of 31 ± 156 ms for inspiration and 9 ± 147 ms for expiration compared to expert visual detection during <b>variable</b> mask <b>pressures</b> asleep. The algorithm had excellent performance in response to baseline drifts and noise during <b>variable</b> mask <b>pressure</b> conditions. This new algorithm {{can be used for}} accurate breath detection including during <b>variable</b> mask <b>pressure</b> conditions which represents a major advance over existing time-consuming manual approaches...|$|R

40|$|Heat {{exchange}} rates decrease non-linearly with reductions in atmospheric pressure. This decrease creates risk of thermal stress (elevated leaf temperatures) for plants under reduced pressures. Forced convection (fans) significantly increases heat exchange rate under almost all pressures except below ~ 10 kPa. Plant cultivation techniques under reduced pressures will require forced convection. The cooling curve technique is a reliable means of assessing {{the influence of}} environmental <b>variables</b> like <b>pressure</b> and gravity on gas exchange of plant. These results represent the extremes of gas exchange conditions for simple systems under <b>variable</b> <b>pressures.</b> In reality, dense plant canopies will exhibit responses in between these extremes.
