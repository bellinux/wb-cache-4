5|$|The holotype {{specimen}} of A. atacis {{is a group}} of three connected dorsal <b>vertebrae.</b> Cervical <b>vertebrae</b> are uncommon from Bellevue {{and most of them are}} poorly preserved. The <b>vertebrae</b> are opisthocoelous, with centra that lengthen toward the rear. Neural spines have been preserved on the <b>vertebrae,</b> and they face toward the rear. Two dorsal <b>vertebrae</b> were preserved with a complete, but very crushed neural arch, a neural spine with a characteristic shape: it is very widened distally and narrows downwards. The <b>vertebrae</b> also have an internal structure that is spongy, with very large cells. The caudal <b>vertebrae</b> are all strongly procoelous and are compressed on the sides. The neural spines of the caudal <b>vertebrae</b> are very narrow and very tall and point toward the rear. The middle caudal <b>vertebrae</b> are more compressed on the sides that the others. Also, the centrum of middle caudal <b>vertebrae</b> is longer proportionally. Two sacral <b>vertebrae</b> were known from Bellevue. They are poorly preserved, and are thought to belong to a juvenile. A complete sacrum was also found in 2002.|$|E

5|$|The {{most serious}} {{pathology}} discovered {{was in a}} series of five large tail <b>vertebrae.</b> The first two <b>vertebrae</b> showed only minor abnormalities {{with the exception of a}} large groove that extended along the left side of both bones. However, the next three <b>vertebrae</b> were completely fused together at many different points, forming a solid bony mass. There is no sign of any other <b>vertebrae</b> after the fifth in the series, indicating that the tail ended there prematurely. From the size of the last <b>vertebrae,</b> scientists judged that about ten <b>vertebrae</b> were lost. One explanation for this pathology is severe physical trauma resulting in the loss of the tail tip, followed by osteomyelitis (infection) of the last remaining <b>vertebrae.</b> Alternatively, the infection may have come first and led to the end of the tail becoming necrotic and falling off. This is the first example of tail truncation known in a non-avian theropod dinosaur.|$|E
5|$|The skull {{is unknown}} except for {{possibly}} {{a portion of}} lower jaw found at the same site {{as the rest of}} the known Coelurus material. Although it has the same preservation and coloring as the fossils known to belong to the Coelurus skeleton, it is very slender, which may mean it does not belong to the skeleton; this bone is 7.9centimeters long (3.1in) but only 1.1centimeters tall (0.43in). In general, its <b>vertebrae</b> were long and low, with low neural spines and thin walls to the bodies of the <b>vertebrae.</b> Its neck <b>vertebrae</b> were very pneumatic, with numerous hollow spaces on their surfaces (pleurocoels); these hollows were not evenly distributed among the <b>vertebrae</b> and varied in size. The neck <b>vertebrae</b> were very elongate, with bodies four times longer than wide, and they articulated with concave faces on both ends (amphicoely). The back <b>vertebrae</b> were not as elongate, lacked surface hollows, and had less developed concave faces and bodies that were hourglass-shaped. The tail <b>vertebrae</b> also lacked surface hollows.|$|E
5|$|There are 34 known <b>vertebrae</b> of Plesiorycteropus. The animal had {{at least}} seven sacral and five or six lumbar <b>vertebrae.</b> A find of {{associated}} caudal <b>vertebrae</b> {{from the base of}} the tail, which diminish in size only slowly from front to back, suggests that the tail was long. There is no evidence for the additional joints between the <b>vertebrae</b> that are characteristic of xenarthrans. In the seven known thoracic (chest) <b>vertebrae,</b> the articulations with the intervertebral disks are bean-shaped and much wider from side to side than from top to bottom. In the back thoracics and all lumbars, a longitudinal transarcual canal is present in the neural arch.|$|E

40|$|Neste estudo foram avaliados a sensibilidade e precisão dos métodos de Nash e Moe e de Raimondi para a medida da rotação da <b>vértebra</b> torácica e lombar. Três cirurgiões de coluna avaliaram, independentemente, as radiografias de uma <b>vértebra</b> torácica (T 9) e de uma <b>vértebra</b> lombar (L 2) com graus de rotação que variaram de 0 º a 60 º e estabeleceram valores de acordo com o método de Nash e Moe e o método de Raimondi. Foram estudadas a concordância entre os examinadores para um determinado método, a variação das medidas obtidas na <b>vértebra</b> torácica e lombar a partir de uma mesma rotação real conhecida e a correlação entre um valor real conhecido de rotação {{vertebral}} e a sua estimativa pelos métodos utilizados no estudo. Os resultados mostraram boa concordância entre os examinadores para o método de Nash e Moe, tanto para a <b>vértebra</b> torácica (k médio = 0, 66), quanto para a lombar (k médio = 0, 80). Pelo método de Raimondi não houve diferença significativa entre os examinadores para a <b>vértebra</b> torácica, no entanto, para a <b>vértebra</b> lombar houve baixa reprodutibilidade do método. Para uma mesma rotação na <b>vértebra</b> torácica e lombar os resultados foram não concordantes pelo método de Nash e Moe, e pelo método de Raimondi os valores observados para a <b>vértebra</b> torácica foram significativamente maiores que os da <b>vértebra</b> lombar. A correlação entre os valores reais e as estimados pelo método de Raimondi para a <b>vértebra</b> torácica mostrou que houve diferença significativa produzida em função da rotação até 20 º graus, já para a <b>vértebra</b> lombar, os valores obtidos foram muito próximos do real. The sensibility {{and precision}} of the Nash and Moe and Raimondi methods were evaluated {{in this study}} for the measurement of {{the rotation of the}} thoracic and the lumbar <b>vertebra.</b> Three spine surgeons evaluated, independently, the x-rays of a thoracic <b>vertebra</b> (T 9) and of a lumbar <b>vertebra</b> (L 2) with varying rotational degrees from 0 º to 60 º and established values in agreement with the Nash and Moe method and the Raimondi method. The agreement among the examiners as to a certain method, the variation of the measures obtained for the thoracic and the lumbar <b>vertebra,</b> starting from a same known actual rotation and the correlation between a known true value of vertebral rotation and its forecast prepared through the methods used in the study were perused. The results showed good agreement among the examiners for the Nash and Moe method, so much for the thoracic <b>vertebra</b> (average k = 0, 66), as for the lumbar (average k = 0, 80). Using the Raimondi method {{there was no significant difference}} among the examiners for the thoracic <b>vertebra.</b> However, there was a low reproducibility of the method for the lumbar <b>vertebra.</b> For a same rotation of the thoracic and lumbar <b>vertebra</b> the results were non-concordant for the method of Nash and Moe, and for the Raimondi method the values observed for the thoracic <b>vertebra</b> were significantly larger than the ones for the lumbar <b>vertebra.</b> The correlation between the true values and the estimated values for the Raimondi method for the thoracic <b>vertebra</b> showed that there was a significant difference produced in function of the rotation up to 20 º degrees, however for the lumbar <b>vertebra</b> the obtained values were very close to the actual...|$|R
5|$|Additional {{features}} of the cervical <b>vertebrae</b> which distinguish Dinocephalosaurus from other protorosaurs include the low and keel-like neural spines, and the anterior and posterior (rear) articular surfaces of the <b>vertebrae</b> both being concave (amphicoelous). In the first ten <b>vertebrae,</b> the bottom margin is also concave. The long, slender cervical ribs bear frontal projections free of the vertebral bodies, which are also unique to Dinocephalosaurus. These ribs are aligned along the neck and bridge multiple consecutive vertebral joints, from two or three consecutive joints in the anterior the neck to five or six in the posterior neck. There appear to be no distinct processes on the <b>vertebrae</b> for articulation with the ribs.|$|E
5|$|All the <b>vertebrae</b> {{were highly}} pneumatised by invading air sacs, {{except for the}} atlas bone and the hindmost tail <b>vertebrae,</b> and were thereby {{connected}} to the respiratory system. The back <b>vertebrae</b> were as pneumatised as those of sauropod dinosaurs, and had an extensive system of depressions. These adaptations may be correlated with gigantism, as they reduce weight. The six <b>vertebrae</b> of the sacrum were also tall and pneumatised, and all but the first one were fused together at the top, their neural spines forming a neural plate. The ilium, the top hip bone, was also partially pneumatised close to the sacral <b>vertebrae.</b> Part of the pelvis was hypertrophied (enlarged) compared to other ornithomimosaurs, to support {{the weight of the}} animal with strong muscle attachments. The front hip bones tilted upwards in life. The tail of Deinocheirus ended in at least two fused <b>vertebrae,</b> which were described as similar to the pygostyle of oviraptorosaurian and therizinosauroid theropods. Ornithomimosaurs are known to have had pennaceous feathers, so this feature suggests that they might have had a fan of feathers at the tail end.|$|E
5|$|As {{usual in}} oryzomyines, 12 ribs are present. The first rib articulates {{with both the}} last {{cervical}} (neck) and first thoracic (chest) <b>vertebrae,</b> a synapomorphy of the Sigmodontinae. The anapophyses, processes {{at the back of}} <b>vertebrae,</b> are absent from the fifth lumbar. Between the second and third caudal <b>vertebrae,</b> hemal arches (small bones) are present with a spinous back border. The entepicondylar foramen is absent, as in all members of the Sigmodontinae; if present, as in some other rodents, this foramen perforates the distal end of the humerus.|$|E

5|$|Temnospondyls' <b>{{vertebra}}e</b> {{are divided}} into several segments. In living tetrapods, {{the main body of}} the vertebra is a single piece of bone called the centrum, but in temnospondyls, this region was divided into a pleurocentrum and intercentrum. Two types of <b>vertebrae</b> are recognized in temnospondyls: stereospondylous and rhachitomous vertebrae.'In rhachitomous <b>vertebrae,</b> the intercentra are large and wedge-shaped, and the pleurocentra are relatively small blocks that fit between them.' Both elements support a spine-like neural arch, and well-developed interlocking projections called zygapophyses strengthen the connections between <b>vertebrae.</b> The strong backbone and strong limbs of many ratchitomous temnospondyls allowed them to be partially, and in some cases fully, terrestrial. In stereospondylous <b>vertebrae,</b> the pleurocentra have been lost entirely, with the intercentra enlarged as {{the main body of the}} <b>vertebrae.</b> This weaker type of backbone indicates that stereospondylous temnospondyls spent more time in water.|$|E
5|$|The 19 dorsal <b>vertebrae</b> {{are similar}} to the {{pectoral}} <b>vertebrae,</b> being weakly concave and taller than long, but the neural spines are proportionally taller than the centra. The single-headed dorsal ribs are rounded but slightly flattened in cross-section, and some have a prong-like projection at the top end; their articular surfaces are slightly concave. Underneath, there are at least ten pairs of gastralia, each of which tapers to the sides and has a central groove on the bottom surface. The three sacral <b>vertebrae</b> are similar, but have much smaller, blunter, more oval-shaped ribs. The comparatively smaller first sacral rib is directed further outwards and backwards than the other two ribs. There initially were 25 caudal <b>vertebrae</b> preserved, with 22 still being accounted for. The last several caudal <b>vertebrae</b> are partially fused into a pygostyle-like structure. The preserved caudal ribs are flattened, triangular, and taper towards the tip of the tail.|$|E
5|$|The {{cervical}} <b>vertebrae</b> of {{the neck}} had broad neural spines that increased in height towards the body. The front part of the neural spines had well developed entheses, which was common among adult dinosaurs, and indicates the presence of large ligaments which helped support the massive head. The dorsal <b>vertebrae</b> of the back had centra (or bodies) that were short relative to their width, and their neural spines were short and narrow. The dorsal <b>vertebrae</b> were tightly spaced, which limited the downwards movement of the back. The neural spines had ossified (turned to bone) tendons, which also overlapped some of the <b>vertebrae.</b> The ribs {{of the last four}} back <b>vertebrae</b> were fused to them, and the ribcage was very broad {{in this part of the}} body. The ribs had scars that show where muscles attached to them. The caudal <b>vertebrae</b> of the tail had centra that were slightly amphicoelous, meaning they were concave on both sides. The interlocked zygapophyses (articular processes) of the caudal <b>vertebrae</b> formed a U-shape when seen from above, instead of the more usual V-shape.|$|E

5|$|The giraffe's neck <b>vertebrae</b> have {{ball and}} socket joints. In particular, the atlas–axis joint (C1 and C2) allows the animal to tilt its head {{vertically}} and reach more branches with the tongue. The point of articulation between the cervical and thoracic <b>vertebrae</b> of giraffes is shifted to lie {{between the first and}} second thoracic <b>vertebrae</b> (T1 and T2), unlike most other ruminants where the articulation is between the seventh cervical vertebra (C7) and T1. This allows C7 to contribute directly to increased neck length and has given rise to the suggestion that T1 is actually C8, and that giraffes have added an extra cervical vertebra. However, this proposition is not generally accepted, as T1 has other morphological features, such as an articulating rib, deemed diagnostic of thoracic <b>vertebrae,</b> and because exceptions to the mammalian limit of seven cervical <b>vertebrae</b> are generally characterised by increased neurological anomalies and maladies.|$|E
5|$|The lumbar (or lower back) {{region is}} made up of five <b>vertebrae</b> (L1–L5), {{sometimes}} including the sacrum. In between these <b>vertebrae</b> are fibrocartilaginous discs, which act as cushions, preventing the <b>vertebrae</b> from rubbing together {{while at the same time}} protecting the spinal cord. Nerves come from and go to the spinal cord through specific openings between the <b>vertebrae,</b> providing the skin with sensations and messages to muscles. Stability of the spine is provided by the ligaments and muscles of the back and abdomen. Small joints called facet joints limit and direct the motion of the spine.|$|E
5|$|The {{most notable}} feature of Acrocanthosaurus was its row of tall neural spines, {{located on the}} <b>vertebrae</b> of the neck, back, hips and upper tail, which could be more than 2.5times {{the height of the}} <b>vertebrae</b> from which they extended. Other dinosaurs also had high spines on the back, {{sometimes}} much higher than those of Acrocanthosaurus. For instance, the unrelated Spinosaurus had spines nearly 2meters (6.5ft) tall, about 11 times taller than the bodies of its <b>vertebrae.</b> The lower spines of Acrocanthosaurus had attachments for powerful muscles like those of modern bison, probably forming a tall, thick ridge down its back. The function of the spines remains unknown, although they may have been involved in communication, fat storage, or temperature control. All of its cervical (neck) and dorsal (back) <b>vertebrae</b> had prominent depressions (pleurocoels) on the sides, while the caudal (tail) <b>vertebrae</b> bore smaller ones. This is more similar to carcharodontosaurids than to Allosaurus.|$|E
30|$|Apart {{from the}} Cobb angles {{of the three}} spinal regions (PT, MT, TL/L), {{additional}} documented radiographic parameters were: the Risser sign, AVT (apical vertebral translation), AVR (apical vertebral rotation), coronal and sagittal balance, thoracic kyphosis (T 5 –T 12), thoracolumbar sagittal alignment (L 10 –T 2), lumbar lordosis (T 12 –S 1) and lumbo-sacral take-off angle (LSTOA), {{as well as the}} end <b>vertebra</b> (EV), neutral <b>vertebra</b> (NV) and stable <b>vertebra</b> (SV) of the major curve and the lowest instrumented <b>vertebra</b> (LIV).|$|R
2500|$|Structures may be {{described}} as being {{at the level of}} a specific spinal <b>vertebra,</b> depending on the section of the vertebral column the structure is at. The position is often abbreviated. For example, structures {{at the level of the}} fourth cervical <b>vertebra</b> may be abbreviated as [...] "C4", at the level of a thoracic <b>vertebra</b> [...] "T4", at the level of a lumbar <b>vertebra</b> [...] "L3". Because the sacrum and coccyx are fused, [...] they are not often used to provide location.|$|R
40|$|The {{anticlinal}} <b>vertebra</b> is a {{point in}} the caudal thoracic vertebral column at which vertebral anatomic features change. It may be used as a point of reference in diagnostic imaging studies. However, its exact definition and anatomic location are not consistent between anatomic texts. The position of the anticlinal <b>vertebra</b> was evaluated radiographically in 100 dogs, using three different definitions of the anticlinal <b>vertebra.</b> Definition P referred to perpendicularity of the spinous proceses, definition V referred to verticality of the spinous processes, and definition J referred to the orientation of the intervertebral joints. The anticlinal <b>vertebra</b> was assessed to be T 11 in 85 %, 75 %, and 89 % of dogs for definitions P, V, and J, respectively. Combining definitions improved the likelihood that the <b>vertebra</b> assessed to be the anticlinal <b>vertebra</b> was T 11, if the combination included definition J, but at the expense of loss of sensitivity. The degree of agreement between the definitions ranged from fair to poor. The level of agreement between definitions P and J was improved for small and large dogs and the level of agreement between definitions V and J was improved for medium and large dogs. Compared with large breed dogs, small breed dogs {{were more likely to have}} T 10 described as the anticlinal <b>vertebra.</b> The presence of transitional <b>vertebra</b> did not affect the position of the anticlinal <b>vertebra.</b> It should not be assumed that the anticlinal <b>vertebra</b> is T 11 in all dogs. Care should be taken to define this anatomic feature accurately when using it as an anatomic landmark...|$|R
5|$|The neck {{formed a}} straighter S shape (a sigmoid curve typical of theropods) than that seen in other theropods; in fact, the neck was {{initially}} thought to lack the Scurve. The {{shape of the}} cervical <b>vertebrae</b> indicate that they tapered towards the head and were progressively longer front to back. The neural spines of the cervical <b>vertebrae</b> were low, thin, and were not always sutured to the centra (the bodies of the <b>vertebrae).</b> The axis vertebra, small relative {{to the size of}} the skull, had a well-developed hyposphene. The centra of the dorsal <b>vertebrae</b> were similar in size. Like other dinosaurs, Baryonyx reduced its weight (skeletal pneumaticity) with fenestrae (openings) in the neural arches and with pleurocoels (hollow depressions) in the centra (primarily near the transverse processes). From front to back, the neural spines of the dorsal <b>vertebrae</b> changed from short and stout to tall and broad.|$|E

5|$|The tail of Dimetrodon {{makes up}} {{a large portion of}} its total body length and {{includes}} around 50 caudal <b>vertebrae.</b> Tails were missing or incomplete in the first described skeletons of Dimetrodon; the only caudal <b>vertebrae</b> known were the eleven closest to the hip. Since these first few caudal <b>vertebrae</b> narrow rapidly as they progress farther from the hip, many paleontologists {{in the late nineteenth and}} early twentieth centuries thought that Dimetrodon had a very short tail.
