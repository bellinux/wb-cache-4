5000|$|GT-S: The GT-S (chassis code ST162) {{was given}} a de-tuned version of the DOHC 2.0 L engine (3S-GELC) {{featuring}} T-VIS and a 6800 rpm redline producing [...] at 6000 rpm and 125 ft-lbs of torque at 4800 rpm. An EGR and O2 sensor restricted the engine along with a milder ECU. The GT-S replaced the rear drum brakes with disc brakes going along with a 5x100 bolt pattern. Standard features {{in addition to the}} GT trim included an 8-way adjustable sports bucket seats with power lumbar and side bolsters, automatic climate control, side mirror defogger, wrap-around spoiler, telescopic steering wheel, and speed-rated 205/60-14 tires on 14"x6" [...] alloy wheels. Leather interior including shift knob, door panel inserts, and steering wheel were optional. In Canada, all GT-S models were 5-speed (S53) manual transmissions, but in America, an electronic controlled 4-speed automatic (A140E) with lock-up torque converter was available. New features in 1988-1989 included an illuminated <b>vanity</b> <b>light</b> as standard and ABS as optional.|$|E

A visor mounted mirror was among popular dealer-added accessories that provided high profit margins with the sales staff receiving extra incentives to sell them. In some cases, a flip up or sliding cover over the mirror automatically turns on <b>vanity</b> <b>lights,</b> {{which can be}} adjusted with a dimmer control (see image).|$|R

60|$|The general opinion which ranks <b>vanity</b> {{among the}} <b>lighter</b> failings of humanity, commits a serious mistake. Vanity wants {{nothing but the}} motive power to develop into {{absolute}} wickedness. Vanity can be savagely suspicious and diabolically cruel. What are the two typical names which stand revealed in history as {{the names of the}} two vainest men that ever lived? Nero and Robespierre.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in May 2017 {{the hotel}} debuted their new rooms {{with the top}} two floors being {{available}} to book. Totally renovated, the rooms feature all new flooring, wall vinyl, ceilings, and completely redone bathrooms. The new furniture includes new Doubletree beds, reading lights, all new cabinets with refrigerators, and coffee makers. The bathrooms include very large sinks and <b>vanities</b> including <b>lighted</b> personal make-up mirrors {{as well as a}} huge lighted main mirror, along with all new tubs for the Queen bedrooms and walk-in showers with glass barn-doors for the King bedrooms. So far the reaction has been extremely positive and the renovation is slated to be complete by August, 2017 when the hotel with officially convert to Doubletree by Hilton - Hotel Utica.|$|R
5000|$|From 1977 to 1979, a Williamsburg Edition was {{available}} for the Continental Town Car. It was primarily a cosmetic option, with its own two-tone paint, pinstriping, full vinyl roof, power vent windows, <b>lighted</b> <b>vanity</b> mirrors, and 6-way twin [...] "Comfort Lounge Seats". For 1977, Williamsburg Editions were among the more subtle versions of the Continental, marketed to buyers seeking a conservative design; no opera windows or coach lights were fitted. In 1978, this changed, as both features were added in, but the Williamsburg became the only Continental Town Car sold with two-tone paint.|$|R
50|$|With the {{internal}} combustion engine and transaxle mounted very low in the back, the T3 had much larger disc brakes in the front, and drums in the rear. Axle weight is very nearly equal upon both the front and back ends of the vehicle. Unlike the T2 before it, the T3 was available with amenities such as power steering, air conditioning, power door locks, electrically controlled and heated mirrors, <b>lighted</b> <b>vanity</b> mirrors, and a light above the glove box (most of which were essentially standard equipment in later models).|$|R
60|$|The {{family of}} Mark Heathcote, the lowest {{dependant}} included, saw these strangers depart with great inward satisfaction. Even the maidens, in whom nature, in moments weaker than common, had awakened {{some of the}} <b>lighter</b> <b>vanities,</b> were gladly rid of gallants, who could not soothe their ears with the unction of flattery, without frequently giving great offence to their severe principles, by light and irreverent allusions to things on which they themselves were accustomed to think with fitting awe. Eben Dudley could scarcely conceal the chuckle with which he saw the party bury themselves in the forest, though neither he, nor any of the more instructed in such matters, believed they incurred serious risk from their sudden enterprise.|$|R
60|$|Nevertheless the {{darkness}} wheeled round about, with grey shadow-shapes of wild beasts, {{and also with}} dark shadow-shapes of the angels, whom the light fenced out, as it fenced out the more familiar beasts of darkness. And some, having for a moment seen {{the darkness}}, saw it bristling with the tufts of the hyena and the wolf; and some having given up their <b>vanity</b> of the <b>light,</b> having died in their own conceit, saw the gleam {{in the eyes of}} the wolf and the hyena, that it was the flash of the sword of angels, flashing at the door to come in, that the angels in the darkness were lordly and terrible and not to be denied, like the flash of fangs.|$|R
50|$|Convenience {{standard}} accessories included power steering, tinted windshield, intermittent wipers, woodgrain panels applied on dashboard, luxury steering wheel, heater with front defroster, Quartz clock, 180 km/h-110 mph speedometer, {{water temperature}} and gasoline level gauges, warning lights with international symbols, inside hood release, rear defroster, <b>lighted</b> <b>vanity</b> mirror on passenger's side sunvisor, AM FM stereo radio with four speakers, cigarette lighter, front ashtray, locking glove box, parcel shelf, complete light group (hood, trunk, front ashtray, glovebox, courtesy, reading dome light), dual remote-controlled remote mirrors (non-electric), three-point retractable front seatbelts, side armrest safety reflectors on front doors, dual rear ashtrays, spare tire cover and locking gas cap.

5000|$|... 1976 was {{the last}} model year for the sixth generation. Some items that were {{standard}} in 1975 were moved to the options list. Some items returning to the option list included, AM/FM stereo, front cornering lights, and tinted glass. Additionally the rear windows became stationary. This move was to keep cost down and was also shared by the 1976 Mark IV. The 1976 luxury groups were cr√®me and gold ($793), lipstick ($546), and Bordeaux ($700). New options included driver's <b>lighted</b> <b>vanity</b> mirror ($43), power lumbar drivers seat, ($86), AM/FM stereo search radio ($298), and AM/FM stereo radio with Quadra sonic 8-track tape player ($382). An auto dimmer {{was added to the}} autolamp option. Base price was $7,790 with a total of 52,935 cars produced.|$|R
25|$|VAM {{originally}} intended the Rally SST to include as standard equipment only the same accessories as the 1981 Rally GT and the optional equipment {{list of the}} 1981 Rally AMX except for its own share of exclusive and not available accessories. However, the same story as the 1980 Rally GT repeated itself for the 1981 Rally SST. The need to stress differences between not just the three-version Rally line but also the new Spirit-based Lerma model forced VAM to act any way it could. Once again, the company's sales department determined that virtually all Rally SST units included all optional convenience accessories available in the Rally line from the factory. The final list of equipment for the Rally SST consisted of a tinted windshield, intermittent wipers, rear defroster, electric antenna, full light group including reading dome light, AM-FM stereo radio, quartz clock, center console with compartment and armrest with rear ashtray, <b>lighted</b> <b>vanity</b> mirror, side armrest safety reflectors, cigarette lighter, front ashtray, locking glove box, leather wrapped sports steering wheel, inside hood release, air conditioning, parcel shelf, power door locks, power windows, power trunk release, dual remote-controlled mirrors, reclining bucket seats, retractable seatbelts, and removable trunk cover.|$|R
2500|$|The 1980 VAM Americans {{incorporated}} all changes {{designed by}} AMC for the Concord that included C-pillar {{windows on the}} ECD, opera windows on the GFS, full-length tail lights, a standard flexible seven-blade fan in all engines, [...] speedometer. For the first time, the cars came with a VAM-designed grille made of aluminum. The American ECD came with the [...] six as standard equipment, meaning that all high-trim VAM Americans were powered by the largest six engine from this point ahead. The American GFS switched to column-shifted transmission control (retaining the individual seat configuration) and the American DL wagon was available {{for the first time}} with simulated wood bodyside trim. A <b>lighted</b> <b>vanity</b> mirror was now standard equipment for the three top end models. All three base models included the heater as standard equipment regardless of transmission type, as well as high back front seats with adjustable headrests. All models featured a locking gas cap and high trim models had safety reflectors fixed onto the door armrests. The high trim 1980 models were the first VAM cars ever to be available with intermittent wipers, power door locks, power windows, power trunk release, electric antenna, and an AM/FM stereo radio (instead of the previous monaural units).|$|R
2500|$|The Rally GT and the Rally SST did not {{disappear}} completely this year; {{this can be}} described that they were downgraded from being trim levels to optional packages that were offered by several VAM dealerships. A Rally SST equivalent was created including most of the still available optional items including automatic transmission, air conditioning, rear wiper and washer, reading dome light, intermittent wipers, <b>lighted</b> <b>vanity</b> mirror on passenger's side sunvisor, and built-in side armrest safety reflectors. The only option that were virtually separate at all times were the new tape player, electric antenna and mirror controls. This set of components was called [...] "paquete de lujo" [...] by VAM's dealerships and the units carrying it had no particular name or designation. On {{the other side of}} the coin, there was a second optional package for Rally AMXs with manual transmission that included all mechanical components of the Rally GT 4.6 / X engine (302 degree camshaft, headers, Holley 2300 two-barrel carburetor, counterweight-modified high-acceleration Prestolite electronic distributor and 3.31:1 rear gears) except for the ported head. Unlike the luxury package, units equipped with the performance one did get a special name that was either Rally ZX or Rally TX, depending on the dealership that sold the unit.|$|R

2500|$|The {{greatest}} novelty for 1981 was {{the introduction}} of a third trim level within the VAM's Rally line, the company's first high-end luxury sporty model called Rally SST. This version carried the same mechanicals as the Rally AMX except that it came equipped from the factory with the three-speed automatic transmission. Appearance wise, the car carried bright trim on the rocker panels, wheel lips, drip rails, B-pillar molding plus door and side glass bases. The moldings for the windshield and rear glass were also bright instead of blacked out while both bumpers were chromed. The lower portions of the sides, doors and front fenders carried wide moldings with a horizontal six-stripe pattern. The in-house five-spoke wheels held AMC's [...] "Noryl" [...] wheel cover design. Finally, chromed squared mirrors with inside controls were fitted to the doors. The Rally SST is the closest VAM counterpart to the AMC Spirits in terms of appearance and the Mexican equivalent of the US AMC Spirit Limited model. To reduce the sportiness and enforce the luxury appointments of the line, a fender-mounted electric antenna was made standard equipment so the AMX's sporty roof-mounted diagonal design would not be present. For this same reason, the rear spoiler was not available. Among its unique characteristics, the Rally SST included side armrest safety reflectors and sun visor <b>lighted</b> <b>vanity</b> mirror from the factory, which were unavailable in the AMXs and GTs. The interior of the Rally SST was the same as the one of the GTs and AMXs with the only exceptions of the center console having an open compartment in place of the auxiliary gauges and the quartz electric digital clock instead of both tachometer types. Despite the luxury focus, the sporty aspects were retained {{in the form of the}} individual reclining Recaro-type bucket seats, center console with armrest and rear ashtray, floor-mounted transmission, leather-wrapped sports steering wheel and the full suspension package with rear sway bar.|$|R
2500|$|After {{the turmoil}} of 1982, Renault de M√©xico took over VAM from the Mexican {{government}} in February 1983. As with AMC, Renault was most interested in the Jeep line, VAM's production facilities, and its established dealer network. As soon as the agreement was finalized, Renault ordered the termination of VAM's passenger car line so it would not compete with its own products. VAM's 1983 models existed mainly to use up the highest possible amount of existing inventories as well as fulfilling previous agreements with sourcing companies. The American line for 1983 soldiered on in a very limited form. The American GFS and American ECD models were virtually not produced for the final year. Both sedan models existed as the base manual and semi-equipped automatics units. Cars with manual transmissions had a parcel shelf as standard equipment while the units with automatic transmission featured aluminum road wheels, the same door panels and seat designs as the previous GFS and ECD models along with their respective door armrest safety reflectors. The two-door automatic models had a reclining mechanism for their front seats. Regardless of the transmission, standard equipment included power brakes, power steering, and dual remote mirrors. The American DL station wagon model was virtually the only high-trim American model to be available. For 1983, the base automatic and the basic DL were merged into a single version alongside the equipped DL and the base manual, creating three versions for the year unlike the four {{of the last two}} years. The mid-range version had the same equipment as the sedan models with automatic transmission of the year, it was also called [...] "American DL" [...] and carried the same woodgrain panels and moldings that were never seen in the base automatics of the previous two years. The differences between the mid-range DL and the top-of-the-line DL are the presence of the AM/FM stereo radio, reading dome <b>light,</b> <b>lighted</b> <b>vanity</b> mirror, intermittent wipers and air conditioning in the latter model. The only optional accessories available were the AM/FM stereo tape player radio, remote-controlled door mirrors and electric antenna. Only the top-of-the-line DL carried the [...] I6 while the rest had the [...] Cars equipped with air conditioning included the larger 282 engine. Leftover 1983 VAM Americans were sold as 1984 models.|$|R
6000|$| psalms: The {{boys and}} girls whom charity maintains, Implore your help in these pathetic strains: How could devotion touch the country pews, Unless the gods {{bestowed}} a proper Muse? Verse cheers their leisure, verse assists their work, Verse prays for peace, or sings down Pope and Turk. The silenced preacher yields to potent strain, And feels that grace his prayer besought in vain; The blessing thrills through all the lab'ring throng, And Heaven is won by violence of song. [...] Our rural ancestors, with little blest, Patient of labour when the end was rest, Indulged the day that housed their annual grain, With feasts, and off'rings, and a thankful strain: The joy their wives, their sons, and servants share, Ease of their toil, and partners of their care: The laugh, the jest, attendants on the bowl, Smoothed every brow, and opened every soul: With growing years the pleasing licence grew, And taunts alternate innocently flew. But times corrupt, and Nature, ill-inclined, Produced the point that left a sting behind; Till friend with friend, and families at strife, Triumphant malice raged through private life. Who felt the wrong, or feared it, took th' alarm, Appealed to law, and justice lent her arm. At length, by wholesome dread of statutes bound, The poets learned to please, and not to wound: Most warped to flatt'ry's side; but some more nice, Preserved the freedom, and forebore the vice. Hence satire rose, that just the medium hit, And heals with morals what it hurts with wit. [...] We conquered France, but felt our captive's charms; Her arts victorious triumphed o'er our arms; Britain to soft refinements less a foe, Wit grew polite, and numbers learned to flow. Waller was smooth; but Dryden taught to join } The varying verse, the full-resounding line, } The long majestic march, and energy divine. } Though still some traces of our rustic vein And splay-foot verse, remained, and will remain. Late, very late, correctness grew our care, When the tired nation breathed from civil war. Exact Racine, and Corneille's noble fire, Showed us that France had something to admire. Not but the tragic spirit was our own, And full in Shakespeare, fair in Otway shone: But Otway failed to polish or refine, And fluent Shakespeare scarce effaced a line. E'en copious Dryden wanted, or forgot The last and greatest art, the art to blot. Some doubt, if equal pains, or equal fire The humbler Muse of comedy require. But in known images of life, I guess The labour greater, as th' indulgence less. Observe how seldom even the best succeed: Tell me if Congreve's fools are fools indeed? What pert, low dialogue has Farquhar writ! How Van wants grace, who never wanted wit! The stage how loosely does Astraea tread, Who fairly puts all characters to bed! And idle Cibber, how he breaks the laws, To make poor Pinky eat with vast applause! But fill their purse, our poet's work is done, Alike to them, by pathos or by pun. [...] O you! whom <b>vanity's</b> <b>light</b> bark conveys On fame's mad voyage by the wind of praise, With what a shifting gale your course you ply, For ever sunk too low, or borne too high! Who pants for glory finds but short repose, A breath revives him, or a breath o'erthrows. Farewell the stage! if just as thrives the play, The silly bard grows fat, or falls away. [...] There still remains, to mortify a wit, The many-headed monster of the pit; A senseless, worthless, and unhonoured crowd; Who, to disturb their betters mighty proud, Clatt'ring their sticks before ten lines are spoke, Call for the farce, the bear, or the black-joke. What dear delight to Britons farce affords! Ever the taste of mobs, but now of lords; (Taste, that eternal wanderer, which flies From heads to ears, and now from ears to eyes). The play stands still; damn action and discourse, Back fly the scenes, and enter foot and horse; Pageants on pageants, in long order drawn, Peers, Heralds, Bishops, ermine, gold, and lawn; The champion too! and, to complete the jest, Old Edward's armour beams on Cibber's breast, With laughter sure Democritus had died, Had he beheld an audience gape so wide. Let bear or elephant be e'er so white, The people, sure, the people are the sight! Ah luckless poet! stretch thy lungs and roar, That bear or elephant shall heed thee more; While all its throats the gallery extends, And all the thunder of the pit ascends! Loud as the wolves, on Orcas' stormy steep, Howl to the roarings of the Northern deep, Such is the shout, the long-applauding note, At Quin's high plume, or Oldfield's petticoat; Or when from court a birthday suit bestowed, Sinks the lost actor in the tawdry load. Booth enters--hark! the universal peal! [...] "But has he spoken?" [...] Not a syllable. What shook the stage, and made the people stare? Cato's long wig, flowered gown, and lacquered chair. [...] Yet lest you think I rally more than teach, Or praise malignly arts I cannot reach, Let me for once presume t' instruct the times, To know the poet from the man of rhymes: 'Tis he, who gives my breast a thousand pains, Can make me feel each passion that he feigns; Enrage, compose, with more than magic art, With pity, and with terror, tear my heart; And snatch me, o'er the earth, or through the air, To Thebes, to Athens, when he will, and where. [...] But not {{this part of the}} poetic state Alone, deserves the favour of the great; Think of those authors, sir, who would rely More on a reader's sense, than gazer's eye. Or who shall wander where the Muses sing? Who climb their mountain, or who taste their spring? How shall we fill a library with wit, When Merlin's cave is half unfurnished yet? [...] My liege! why writers little claim your thought, I guess; and, with their leave, will tell the fault: We poets are (upon a poet's word) Of all mankind, the creatures most absurd: The season, when to come, and when to go, To sing, or cease to sing, we never know; And if we will recite nine hours in ten, You lose your patience, just like other men. Then too we hurt ourselves, when to defend A single verse, we quarrel with a friend; Repeat unasked; lament, the wit's too fine For vulgar eyes, and point out every line. But most, when straining with too weak a wing, We needs will write epistles to the King; And from the moment we oblige the town, Expect a place, or pension from the Crown; Or dubbed historians, by express command, T' enrol your triumphs o'er the seas and land, Be called to Court to plan some work divine, As once for Louis, Boileau and Racine. [...] Yet think, great sir! (so many virtues shown) Ah think, what poet best may make them known? Or choose at least some minister of grace, Fit to bestow the laureate's weighty place. [...] Charles, to late times to be transmitted fair, Assigned his figure to Bernini's care; And great Nassau to Kneller's hand decreed To fix him graceful on the bounding steed; So well in paint and stone they judged of merit: But kings in wit may want discerning spirit. The hero William and the martyr Charles, One knighted Blackmore, and one pensioned Quarles; Which made old Ben, and surly Dennis swear, [...] "No Lord's anointed, but a Russian bear." [...] Not with such majesty, such bold relief, The forms august, of king, or conquering chief, E'er swelled on marble; as in verse have shined (In polished verse) the manners and the mind. Oh! could I mount on the Maeonian wing, Your arms, your actions, your repose to sing! What seas you traversed, and what fields you fought! Your country's peace, how oft, how dearly bought! How barb'rous rage subsided at your word, And nations wondered while they dropped the sword! How, when you nodded, o'er the land and deep, Peace stole her wing, and wrapped the world in sleep; Till earth's extremes your mediation own, And Asia's tyrants tremble at your throne-- But verse, alas! your majesty disdains; And I'm not used to panegyric strains: The zeal of fools offends at any time, But most of all, the zeal of fools in rhyme. Besides, a fate attends on all I write, That when I aim at praise, they say I bite. A vile encomium doubly ridicules: There's nothing blackens like the ink of fools. If true, a woeful likeness; and if lies, [...] "Praise undeserved is scandal in disguise:" [...] Well may he blush, who gives it, or receives; And when I flatter, let my dirty leaves (Like journals, odes, and such forgotten things As Eusden, Philips, Settle, writ of kings) Clothe spice, line trunks, or, flutt'ring in a row, Befringe the rails of Bedlam and Soho.|$|R
