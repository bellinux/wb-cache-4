5|$|An {{international}} {{style in}} art {{did not exist}} in Qatna; instead, a regional hybrid style prevailed where international motifs appear along with regional ones, yet all the pieces reveal enough features to trace them to Qatna. The volute-shaped plant {{is one of the most}} widespread international motifs; many pieces from the royal hypogeum were decorated with the motif, but Qatna had its own typical <b>volute,</b> where the crown is a single long lobe with dotted pendants branching out of the corners of the upper <b>volute.</b> The wall painting in Qatna's royal palace attests to contact with the Aegean region; they depict typical Minoan motifs such as palm trees and dolphins.|$|E
5|$|The M3 GMC was 20.46feet (6.24m) long, 6.45feet (1.97m) wide, 8.17feet (2.49m) high (including the gun shield), {{and weighed}} 20,000pounds (9.1t). Its {{suspension}} consisted of semi-elliptical longitudal leaf springs for the wheels and vertical <b>volute</b> springs for the tracks, while its transmission consisted of constant mesh. Its ground clearance was 11.2inches (280mm).|$|E
5|$|The T19 Howitzer Gun Motor Carriage {{was similar}} to the M3 Half-track, as it shared the same chassis, engine, {{suspension}}, armor, and fuel tank. It was 20ft 2 in long, 6ft 5 in wide, 7ft 8 in high, with a weight of 9.54short tons. The suspension consisted of semi-elliptical longitudinal leaf springs for the wheels and vertical <b>volute</b> springs for the tracks. It was powered by a White 160AX, 147hp, 386 in3, six-cylinder gasoline engine with a compression ratio of 6.3:1. It was capable of a maximum road speed of 45mph. The power-to-weight ratio was 14.7hp/ton.|$|E
50|$|<b>Volutes</b> are predators {{that live}} in deep waters where they stalk and kill other molluscs. <b>Volutes</b> {{do not have a}} free-swimming larval stage. Their large egg {{capsules}} contain enough food to allow the embryos to develop over several months. What emerges from these capsules are tiny but fully formed shells. <b>Volutes</b> tend to spend their life in colonies and have small home ranges.|$|R
5000|$|The {{composite}} {{order is}} a mixed order, combining the <b>volutes</b> of the Ionic order capital with the acanthus leaves of the Corinthian order. In many versions the composite order <b>volutes</b> are larger, however, and there is generally some ornament placed centrally between the <b>volutes.</b> The column of the composite order is typically ten diameters high, though as with all the orders these details may be adjusted by the architect for particular buildings. The Composite order is essentially treated as Corinthian except for the capital, with no consistent differences to that above or below the capital.|$|R

5|$|It was {{originally}} {{developed from the}} prototype T2 tank built by Rock Island Arsenal, which had a Vickers-type leaf spring suspension. The suspension {{was replaced by the}} superior vertical <b>volute</b> system in the T2E1 series of 1935. This was put into production with minor modifications as the M2A1 in 1936, with ten produced. The main pre-war version was the M2A2, with 239 produced, becoming the main tank in the US Army infantry units in the pre-world-war-II period. The Spanish Civil War showed that tanks armed only with machine guns were ineffective. This led to the M2A4 with a 37mm gun as the main armament. A total of 375 were delivered, the last ten as late as April 1942.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} surviving {{works of}} art that exhibit traces {{of the influence of}} the Parthenon frieze belong to the media of vase painting and grave stelae where we may find some echo not just of motifs, themes, poses, but tenor, as well. Direct imitation, and indeed quotation, of the frieze begins to be pronounced around 430 BC. One example, an explicit copy, is a pelike attributed to the Wedding Painter of a youth “parking up” a horse exactly in the manner of figure W25 on the frieze. While those vase paintings that resemble the frieze cluster around 430, the vases that quote the pediments are datable nearer {{to the end of the}} century, giving further evidence of the priority of the sculptural program. More accomplished painters also found inspiration in the sculpture, namely Polygnotos I and his group, especially the Peleus Painter, the Kleophon Painter and the late work of the Achilles Painter. Later painters of talent also managed to capture the mood of eusebeia, or thoughtful piety of the procession, as, for example, on the <b>volute</b> krater of the Kleophon Painter of a sacrifice to Apollo, which shares the quiet dignity of the best of High Classical sculpture.|$|E
25|$|The T20 used {{an early}} version of the {{horizontal}} <b>volute</b> spring suspension (HVSS), another improvement compared to the less robust vertical <b>volute</b> spring suspension (VVSS) of the early versions of the M4. Later prototypes of the M26 tested a torsion bar suspension, which would become the standard for future U.S. tank suspension systems.|$|E

50|$|This type of anta capital with side <b>volutes</b> are {{considered}} {{as belonging to}} the Ionic order, starting from the archaic period. They are generally characterized by various moldings on the front, arranged in a rather flat manner {{in order not to}} protrude from the wall, with superposed <b>volutes</b> on curved sides broadening upwards.|$|R

25|$|In the Cyclades, {{there were}} early temples entirely built of marble. <b>Volute</b> capitals {{have not been}} found {{associated}} with these, but their marble entablatures belonged to the Ionic order.|$|E
25|$|Neo-Renaissance {{features}} of the building (arched windows, pediments, low roof), could almost be called Neo-baroque by the choice of <b>volute</b> shaped motifs for the wrought iron balconies, or the roof pediment.|$|E
5000|$|The major {{features}} of the Ionic order are the <b>volutes</b> of its capital, which {{have been the subject}} of much theoretical and practical discourse, based on a brief and obscure passage in Vitruvius. The only tools required to design these features were a straight-edge, a right angle, string (to establish half-lengths) and a compass. Below the <b>volutes,</b> the Ionic column may have a wide collar or banding separating the capital from the fluted shaft (as in, for example, the neoclassical mansion Castle Coole), or a swag of fruit and flowers may swing from the clefts or [...] "neck" [...] formed by the <b>volutes.</b>|$|R

The 1980s also saw the end to several design characteristics, including the <b>volute</b> and maple neck. However, because of consumer demand, the Gibson Les Paul guitar is available today in {{a wide array of}} choices, ranging from guitars equipped with modern digital electronics to classic re-issue models built to match the look and specifications of the guitar's earliest production runs from 1952 to 1960.|$|E
25|$|The {{collector}} of a centrifugal compressor {{can take many}} shapes and forms. When the diffuser discharges into a large empty chamber, the collector may be termed a Plenum. When the diffuser discharges into a device that looks somewhat like a snail shell, bull's horn or a French horn, the collector {{is likely to be}} termed a <b>volute</b> or scroll. As the name implies, a collector’s purpose is to gather the flow from the diffuser discharge annulus and deliver this flow to a downstream pipe. Either the collector or the pipe may also contain valves and instrumentation to control the compressor.|$|E
25|$|The design, {{using as}} many {{commercial}} components {{as possible to}} improve reliability {{and the rate of}} production, was standardized in 1940 and built by the Autocar Company, Diamond T Motor Company, and the White Motor Company. Offered with a choice of White 160AX or IHC Red Diamond 450 engines, the M3 was driven through a manual constant-mesh (non-synchromesh) transmission with four forward and one reverse gear, as well as a two-speed transfer case. The front suspension was leaf spring, tracks by vertical <b>volute</b> spring. Braking was vacuum-assisted hydraulic, steering manual, without power assist. The electrical system was 12-volt.|$|E

25|$|Campania also {{produced}} red-figure vases in the 5th and 4th centuries BC. The light brown clay of Campania {{was covered with}} a slip that developed a pink or red tint after firing. The Campanian painters preferred smaller vessel types, but also hydriai and bell kraters. The most popular shape is the bow-handled amphora. Many typical Apulian vessel shapes, like <b>volute</b> kraters, column kraters, loutrophoroi, rhyta and nestoris amphorae are absent, pelikes are rare. The repertoire of motifs is limited. Subjects include youths, women, thiasos scenes, birds and animals, and often native warriors. The backs often show cloaked youths. Mythological scenes and depictions related to burial rites play a subsidiary role. Naiskos scsnes, ornamental elements and polychromy are adopted after 340 BC under Lucanian influence.|$|E
25|$|The {{specifications}} of the M5 {{were almost}} identical to the specifications of the M3 Half-track. It was 20.8feet (6.3m) long, 7.3feet (2.23m) wide, 9feet (2.74m) high, and weighed 21,500pounds (9.8t). It had vertical <b>volute</b> springs for the tracks and semi-elliptical longitudal leaf springs for the wheels. It was powered by a 142hp (106kW) White 160AX, 386 cubic inch (6,330cc), 6-cylinder engine, with a compression ratio of 6.35:1. It had a fuel capacity of 60 US gallons (230l), a range of 125miles (201km), and a speed of 42miles per hour (68km/h). It had constant mesh transmission, 6.5–13.5mm (0.26–0.53in) of armor, one 0.5in (12.7mm) M2 machine gun and two 0.3in (7.6mm) M1919 machine guns, and crew of three with up to ten passengers.|$|E
25|$|As {{soon as the}} Ionic order becomes {{recognisable}} in temple architecture, it {{is increased}} to monumental sizes. The temple in the Heraion of Samos, erected by Rhoikos around 560 BC, is the first known dipteros, with outside dimensions of 52 × 105 m. A double portico of 8 × 21 columns enclosed the naos, the back even had ten columns. The front used differing column distances, with a wider central opening. In proportion to the bottom diameter, the columns reached three times {{the height of a}} Doric counterpart. 40 flutings enriched the complex surface structure of the column shafts. Samian column bases were decorated with a sequence of horizontal flutings, but in spite of this playfulness they weighed 1,500kg a piece. The capitals of this structure were probably still entirely of wood, as was the entablature. Ionic <b>volute</b> capitals survive from the outer peristasis of the later rebuilding by Polycrates. The columns of the inner peristasis had leaf decoration and no volutes.|$|E
5000|$|In some {{variants}} {{the features}} of a more fully developed face become discernible in the palmette itself, while in certain architectural uses, usually {{at the head of}} pilasters or herms, the fan of palm-fronds [...] and the <b>volutes</b> sometimes appear as breasts. Common to all these forms is the pair of <b>volutes</b> {{at the base of the}} fan - constituting the defining characteristics of the palmette.|$|R
