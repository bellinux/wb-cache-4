5|$|The {{hooded pitohui}} {{was placed in}} the genus Pitohui with five other species, and the genus was thought to reside within the Australasian {{whistler}} family (Pachycephalidae). A 2008 examination of the genus, however, found it to be polyphyletic (meaning that the genus contained unrelated species), with some purported members of the genus not actually falling within the whistlers. The hooded pitohui and the closely related <b>variable</b> <b>pitohui</b> were both found {{to be related to the}} Old World orioles (Oriolidae). A 2010 study by the same team confirmed that the hooded pitohui and <b>variable</b> <b>pitohui</b> were orioles and indeed were sister species, and that together with the figbirds they formed a well defined basal clade within the family. As the <b>variable</b> <b>pitohui</b> was the type species for the genus Pitohui, the hooded pitohui was retained in that genus and the four remaining species were moved to other genera.|$|E

50|$|The {{southern}} <b>variable</b> <b>pitohui</b> (Pitohui uropygialis) is {{a species}} of pitohui in the family Oriolidae. It is found on New Guinea and neighbouring islands. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests. It {{is also one of}} the few known poisonous birds.|$|E
50|$|They are brightly coloured, {{omnivorous}} birds. The {{hooded pitohui}} is brightly coloured, with a brick red belly and a jet-black head. The <b>variable</b> <b>pitohui,</b> {{as its name}} implies, exists in many different forms, and 20 subspecies with different plumage patterns have been named. Two of them, however, closely resemble the hooded pitohui.|$|E
50|$|The birds' bright colours are {{suggested}} {{to be an}} example of aposematism (warning colouration), and the similarity of the hooded pitohui and some forms of the <b>variable</b> <b>pitohui</b> might then {{be an example of}} Müllerian mimicry, in which dangerous species gain a mutual advantage by sharing colouration, so an encounter with either species trains a predator to avoid both.|$|E

40|$|Bird {{species in}} the genus Pitohui are {{chemically}} defended by a potent neurotoxic alkaloid in their skin and feathers. The two most toxic pitohui species, the hooded pitohui (Pitohui dichrous) and the <b>variable</b> <b>pitohui</b> (Pitohui kirhocephalus), are sometimes strikingly patterned and, in certain portions of their geographical ranges, both species share a nearly identical colour pattern, whereas in other areas they do not. Müllerian mimicry (the mutual resemblance of two chemically defended prey species) is common in some other animal groups and Pitohui birds have been suggested {{as one of the}} most likely cases in birds. Here, we examine pitohui plumage evolution in the context of a well-supported molecular phylogeny and use a maximum likelihood approach to test for convergent evolution in coloration. We show that the 'mimetic' phenotype is ancestral to both species and that the resemblance in most races is better explained by a shared ancestry. One large clade of P. kirhocephalus lost this mimetic phenotype early in their evolution and one race nested deep within this clade appears to have re-evolved this phenotype. These latter findings are consistent with the hypothesis that Müllerian mimicry is driving the evolution for a similar colour pattern between P. dichrous, but only in this one clade of P. kirhocephalu...|$|E
