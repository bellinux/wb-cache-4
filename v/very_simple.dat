5|$|A hub is able {{to support}} low {{bandwidth}} devices mixed with other speed device via a special PID value, PRE. This is required as a USB hub functions as a <b>very</b> <b>simple</b> repeater, broadcasting the host message to all connected devices regardless if the packet was for it or not. This means in a mixed speed environment, {{there is a potential}} danger that a low speed will misinterpret a high or full speed signal from the host.|$|E
5|$|Director David Silverman had {{difficulty}} devising a legible Scrabble {{board for the}} opening scene that would convey {{the idea that the}} Simpsons were only able to devise <b>very</b> <b>simple</b> words. The design of Bart's visualization of the math problem was partially inspired by the art of Saul Steinberg. The increasing appearance of numbers in that sequence derived from Silverman's use of a similar tactic when he had to develop a set design for the play The Adding Machine.|$|E

These are often <b>very</b> <b>simple</b> communication boards or books, from which the user selects letters, words, phrases, pictures, and/or symbols to communicate a message. Depending on physical abilities and limitations, users may indicate the appropriate message with a body part, light pointer, eye-gaze direction, or a head/mouth stick. Alternatively, they may indicate yes or no while a listener scans through possible options.|$|E
5|$|Narayan's writing {{style was}} often {{compared}} to that of William Faulkner since both their works brought out the humour and energy of ordinary life while displaying compassionate humanism. The similarities also extended to their juxtaposing of the demands of society against the confusions of individuality. Although their approach to subjects was similar, their methods were different; Faulkner was rhetorical and illustrated his points with immense prose while Narayan was <b>very</b> <b>simple</b> and realistic, capturing the elements all the same.|$|E
50|$|The <b>very</b> <b>simplest</b> {{of these}} motors may use a {{stretched}} rubber band as a linear spring, {{rather than a}} coil spring. These are bulky and less powerful but require little manufacturing sophistication: coil springs, although apparently simple, demand a highly developed steel metallurgy.

5|$|The {{evolutionary}} history of snake venom {{is a matter}} of debate. The common view of this history before 2014 was that venom originated just once among all Toxicofera approximately 170 million years ago, and then diversified into the wide range of venoms seen today. Under this hypothesis, the original toxicoferan venom was a <b>very</b> <b>simple</b> set of proteins that were assembled in a pair of glands. Subsequently, this set of proteins diversified in the various lineages of toxicoferans, including Serpentes, Anguimorpha, and Iguania. Several snake lineages subsequently lost the ability to produce venom, often due to a change in diet.|$|E

5|$|The {{most natural}} and {{convenient}} {{way to express}} the relation involves the algebraic concept of exact sequences: sequences of objects (in this case groups) and morphisms (in this case group homomorphisms) between them such {{that the image of}} one morphism equals the kernel of the next. In general, this does not allow (co)homology groups of a space to be completely computed. However, because many important spaces encountered in topology are topological manifolds, simplicial complexes, or CW complexes, which are constructed by piecing together <b>very</b> <b>simple</b> patches, a theorem such as that of Mayer and Vietoris is potentially of broad and deep applicability.|$|E
5|$|Though Arts and Crafts is {{specifically}} {{regarded as a}} movement within architecture, {{as opposed to a}} full-blown style, there are elements that are considered typical to buildings designed in the style. Examples include, dark, heavy woodwork and <b>very</b> <b>simple</b> ornamentation. The Oregon Public Library contains functional elements associated with that movement. Dark woodwork is found throughout the building, first in the stairwell to the gallery and its balusters and newel posts and then in the four-panel wooden interior door. The ceilings are coffered and have exposed wooden beams. Also located in the interior is a large 1909 wooden floor clock, a built-in storage cabinet, and two wooden fuse boxes that all evoke the Arts and Crafts movement.|$|E
5|$|Two {{vertices}} in a {{directed graph}} {{are said to}} be strongly connected to each other if there is a directed path {{from one to the other}} and vice versa. This is an equivalence relation, and the vertices of the graph may be partitioned into strongly connected components, subsets within which every two vertices are strongly connected. There are several efficient linear time algorithms for finding the strongly connected components of a graph, based on depth first search: Tarjan's strongly connected components algorithm and the path-based strong component algorithm each perform a single depth first search. Kosaraju's algorithm performs two depth first searches, but is <b>very</b> <b>simple.</b>|$|E

Contemporaries noted that cottages in the Highlands and Islands tended to be cruder, with single rooms, slit windows and earthen floors, often shared by a large family. In contrast many Lowland cottages had distinct rooms and chambers, were clad with plaster or paint and even had glazed windows. In the early 1800s urban settings also included traditional thatched houses, beside the larger, stone and slate roofed town houses of merchants and urban gentry.|$|E
