40|$|Clear air turbulence, wake vortices, dry hail, and {{volcanic}} ash are hazards to civil aviation {{that have not}} been brought to the forefront of public attention by a catastrophic accident. However, these four hazards are responsible for major and minor injuries, emotional trauma, significant aircraft damage, and in route and terminal area inefficiency. Most injuries occur during clear air turbulence. There is significant aircraft damage for any <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> <b>encounter.</b> Rolls induced by wake vortices occur near the ground. Dry hail often appears as an area of weak echo on the weather radar. This paper will present the meteorological, electromagnetic, and spatiotemporal characteristics of each hazard. A description of a typical aircraft encounter with each hazard will be given. Analyzed microwave and millimeter wave sensor systems to detect each hazard will be presented...|$|E
40|$|Multiple volcanoes erupt yearly {{propelling}} {{volcanic ash}} {{into the atmosphere}} and creating an aviation hazard. The plinian eruption type {{is most likely to}} create a significant aviation hazard. Plinian eruptions can eject large quantities of fine ash up to an altitude of 50, 000 m (164, 000 feet). While large airborne particles rapidly fall, smaller particles at reduced concentrations drift for days to weeks as they gradually descend and deposit on the ground. Very small particles, less than 13 ̆bcm, can remain aloft for years. An average of three aircraft encounters with volcanic ash was reported every year between 1973 and 2003. Of these, 8 resulted in some loss of engine power, including a complete shutdown of all four engines on a Boeing 747. However, no crashes have been attributed to volcanic ash. The major forms of engine damage caused by volcanic ash are: 1. Deposition of ash on turbine nozzles and blades due to glassification 2. Erosion of compressor and turbine blades 3. Carbon deposits on fuel nozzles The combination of these effects can push the engine to surge and flame out. If a flame out occurs, engine restart may be possible. Less serious engine damage can also occur. In most cases the major damage will require an engine overhaul long before the minor damage becomes an operational issue, but under some conditions no sign of volcanic ash is evident and the turbine cooling system blockage could go unnoticed until an engine inspection is performed. Several organizations provide aircrew procedures to respond to encounters with a volcanic ash cloud. If a <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> <b>encounter</b> is suspected, then an engine inspection, including borescope, should be performed with particular attention given to the turbine cooling system.

40|$|The {{forecast}} accuracy of distal <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> clouds {{is important for}} providing valid aviation advice during <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> eruption. However, because the distal part of <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> plume {{is far from the}} volcano, the influence of eruption information on this part becomes rather indirect and uncertain, resulting in inaccurate <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> forecasts in these distal areas.

40|$|For {{improving}} the numerical modelling of <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> atmospheric concentration by addressing <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> aggregation processes and removal by wet deposition during long-range transport, an interdisciplinary approach by combining volcanic, meteorological, atmospheric and climate research is wishful.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} early ages of {{hydration}} behavior when basaltic <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> {{was used as}} a partial substitute to ordinary Portland cement using ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering and wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS). The mix design consisted of 10, 30 and 50 % substitution of Portland cement with two different-sized <b>volcanic</b> <b>ashes.</b> The data showed that substitution of <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> above 30 % results in excess unreacted <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash,</b> rather than additional pozzolanic reactions along longer length scales. WAXS studies revealed that addition of finely ground <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> facilitated calcium-silicate-hydrate related phases, whereas inclusion of coarser <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> caused domination by calcium-aluminum-silicate-hydrate and unreacted MgO phases, suggesting some <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> remained unreacted throughout the hydration process. Addition of more than 30 % <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> leads to coarser morphology along with decreased surface area and higher intensity of scattering at early-age hydration. This suggests an abrupt dissolution indicated by changes in surface area due to the retarding gel formation that can have implication on early-age setting influencing the mechanical properties of the resulting cementitious matrix. The findings from this work show that the concentration of <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> influences the specific surface area and morphology of hydration products during the early age of hydration. Hence, natural pozzolanic <b>volcanic</b> <b>ashes</b> can be a viable substitute to Portland cement by providing environmental benefits in terms of lower-carbon footprint along with long-term durability...|$|R

These beds are identified on well logs by their high radioactivity and low density. Paleontologic markers used to date these deposits give dates {{that are consistent with}} eruptions from the Snake River Plain (SRP) and Yellowstone calderas. Lead isotope ratios from the Gulf of Mexico samples are also consistent with the SRP-Yellowstone tuffs. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the rare earth element (REE) and other trace element data from the GOM samples to determine whether they may be differentiated from one another, and also whether they compare to the SRP data. Well cuttings and sidewall core samples from sixteen wells known to contain <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> were density separated using lithium metatungstate to isolate the low density volcanic glass from the remaining minerals. The concentrated ash was dissolved and analyzed using ICP-MS. Trace and REE variations were plotted by depositional age based upon paleontological markers. Variations in most trace elements are not useful criteria for discriminating ash by age. There is a wide spread in fairly mobile elements (i. e. Sr, Ba), suggesting that each ash bed has had a different diagenetic history. REE variations, in particular the magnitude of the Europium anomaly and the degree of fractionation between light and heavy REE, are good discriminates of each ash. A few anomalous samples plot within an older field, which might be explained by reworking of older ash into younger deposits. Direct correlation to SRP-Yellowstone eruptions is hindered by the lack of SRP samples analyzed using similar methods...|$|R

In this introductory paper, we provide a general introduction into magma fragmentation processes during explosive volcanic eruptions, describe the evolution of {{the eruption of}} Eyjafjallajokull, present the possibilities of ground based in-situ and remote measurements and numerical model studies of <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> and summarise open questions and future directions.

5|$|Proximal {{volcanic}} hazards pose {{a significant}} threat {{to human life}} near Gareloi. If Gareloi were to erupt unexpectedly, <b>ash</b> clouds, falling <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash,</b> pyroclastic flows, and debris avalanches (such as lahars) could easily span deadly hazards such as tsunamis. As <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> can induce engine failure, it puts commercial airplanes in particular at high risk. Inhalation of <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash,</b> also known as tephra, creates respiratory complexities and irritation of the eye.|$|R
40|$|<b>Ash</b> fall during <b>volcanic</b> eruptions and {{pyroclastic}} {{flows of}} Mt. Fugen in Unzen rendered severe bad effects on everyday life, local economy in commerce and industry, and agriculture in Shimabara district. The governments made programs for ash {{fall under the}} Act of Active Volcanos and considered many countermeasures to reduce damage due to <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash.</b> Residents suffered from <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> {{for a long time}} and introduced various means to avoid <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash.</b> The objective of this paper is to investigate the countermeasures against <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> in the eruption of Mt. Fugen in Unzen by interviews and questionnaires. The results are discussed and some suggestions are presented...|$|R
5000|$|Animal {{studies that}} focused on the {{biological}} effects of chronic inhalation exposure to Mount St. Helens <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> or quartz, under controlled laboratory conditions, indicate significant dose-response to both materials. The quartz that came from the volcano was found to be markedly toxic and fibrogenic; by contrast, the <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> was much less toxic. Similar results were noted in other animal studies, suggesting that quartz is a much more potent pulmonary toxicant than <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash.</b> However, the presence of <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> in the inhaled air did increase the [...] "histamine sensitivity" [...] of the epithelial irritant receptors [...] as well as inhibit the ability of alveolar macrophages to protect against infection.|$|R
50|$|Concrete {{has been}} used since ancient times. Regular Roman {{concrete}} for example was made from <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> (pozzolana), and hydrated lime. Roman concrete was superior to other concrete recipes (for example, those consisting of only sand and lime) used by other nations. Besides <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> for making regular Roman concrete, brick dust can also be utilized. Besides regular Roman concrete, the Romans also invented hydraulic concrete, which they made from <b>volcanic</b> <b>ash</b> and clay.|$|R
