40|$|Abstract. The {{estimation}} of moisture content of dead fuels {{is a critical}} <b>variable</b> in <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> assessment since it is strongly related to fire ignition and fire spread potential. This study evaluates the accuracy of two well-known meteoro-logical moisture codes, the Canadian Fine Fuels Moisture Content and the US 10 -h, to estimate fuel moisture content of dead fuels in Mediterranean areas. Cured grasses and litter {{have been used for}} this study. The study was conducted in two phases. The former aimed to select the most efficient code, and the latter to produce a spatial representation of that index for operational assessment of <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> conditions. The first phase required calibration and validation of an estimation model based on regression analysis. Field samples were collected in the Cabañeros National Park (Central Spain) for a six-year period (1998 – 2003). The estimations were more accurate for litter (r 2 between 0. 52) than for cured grasslands (r 2 0. 11). In addition, grasslands showed higher variability in the trends among the study years. The two moisture codes evaluated in this paper offered similar trends, therefore, the 10 -h code was selected since it is simpler to compute. The second phase was based on interpolating the required meteorological variables (temperature and relative humidity) to compute the 10 -h moisture code. The interpolation was based on European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecast-ing (ECMWF) predictions. Finally, a simple method to combine the estimations of dead fuel moisture content with other <b>variables</b> associated to <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> is presented in this paper. This method estimates the probability of ignition based on the moisture of extinction of each fuel type...|$|R
40|$|Fire {{regimes are}} {{strongly}} related to weather conditions that directly and indirectly influence fire ignition and propagation. Identifying the most important meteorological fire drivers is thus fundamental for daily fire risk forecasting. In this context, several fire weather indices have been developed focussing mainly on fire-related local weather conditions and fuel characteristics. The specificity of the conditions for which <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> indices are developed makes its direct transfer and applicability problematic in different areas or with other fuel types. In this paper we used the low-to-intermediate fire-prone region of Canton Ticino {{as a case study}} to develop a new daily <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> index by implementing a niche modelling approach (Maxent). In order to identify the most suitable weather conditions for fires, different combinations of input variables were tested (meteorological <b>variables,</b> existing <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> indices or a combination of both). Our findings demonstrate that such combinations of input variables increase the predictive power of the resulting index and surprisingly even using meteorological variables only allows similar or better performances than using the complex Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI). Furthermore, the niche modelling approach based on Maxent resulted in slightly improved model performance and in a reduced number of selected variables with respect to the classical logistic approach. Factors influencing final model robustness were the number of fire events considered and the specificity of the meteorological conditions leading to fire ignition...|$|R

The rule calculates the value of current cell, based on cell value and the value of its neighboring cells at the previous time. We propose the transition rules of the model, using multiple linear regression analysis, by performing adjustment of model parameters and input data. Data in this research is a collection of JPEG images of maps that present the results of observations of drought code <b>variable</b> in <b>Fire</b> <b>Danger</b> Rating System for 30 successive days. In order to process the data in the model Continues Cellular Geography, the qualitative input data was transformed into continuous data using random number generator based on certain probability distribution. The research observed the effect of the selection of neighborhood scheme and its radius, to the quality of transition rules. Experimental results show, continues uniform distribution is better than normal distribution and uniform discrete distribution. Whilst in the scheme of Cellular Automata model, von Neumann neighborhood with radius 2, is the optimal scheme. Manipulation of map resolution, by up grading or down grading it‘s scale, can be decreasing the quality of transition rules.

40|$|Abstract. The present paper {{presents}} and discusses {{the relationships between}} live Fuel Moisture Content (FMC) measurements and fire occurrence (number of fires and burned area) in a Mediterranean area of central Spain. Grasslands and four shrub species (Cistus ladanifer L., Rosmarinus officinalis L., Erica australis L. and Phillyrea angustifolia L.) were sampled in the field from the spring to the summer season over a 9 -year period. Higher seasonal FMC variability was found for the herbaceous species than for shrubs, as grasslands have very low values in summertime. Moisture variations of grasslands {{were found to be}} good predictors of number of fires and total burned surface, while moisture variation of two shrubs (C. ladanifer L. and R. officinalis L.) was more sensitive to both the total burned area and the occurrence of large fires. All these species showed significant differences between the FMC of high and low occurrence periods. Three different logistic regression models were built for the 202 periods of analysis: one to predict periods with more and less than seven fires, another to predict periods with and without large fires (> 500 ha), and the third to predict periods with more and less than 200 ha burned. The results showed accuracy in predicting periods with a high number of fires (94 %), and extensive burned area (85 %), with less accuracy in estimating periods with large fires (58 %). Finally, empirical functions based on logistic regression analysis were successfully related to fire ignition or potential burned area from FMC data. These models should be useful to integrate FMC measurements with other <b>variables</b> of <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> (ignition causes, for instance), to provide a more comprehensive assessment of <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> conditions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Increasedwildfire {{activity}} (e. g. {{number of}} starts, area burned, fire behaviour) across the western United States {{in recent decades}} has heightened interest in resolving climate–fire relationships. Macroscale climate–fire relationships were examined in forested and non-forested lands for eight Geographic Area Coordination Centers in the western United States, using area burned derived from the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity dataset (1984 – 2010). Fire-specific biophysical <b>variables</b> including <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> and water balance metrics were considered in addition to standard climate variables of monthly temperature, precipitation and drought indices to explicitly determine their optimal capacity to explain interannual variability in area burned. Biophysical variables tied to the depletion of fuel and soil moisture and prolonged periods of elevated fire-danger had stronger correlations to area burned than standard variables antecedent to or during the fire season, particularly in forested systems. Antecedent climate–fire relationships exhibited inter-region commonality with area burned in forested lands correlated with winter snowwater equivalent and emergent drought in late spring. Area burned in non-forested lands correlated with moisture availability in the growing season preceding the fire year. Despite differences {{in the role of}} antecedent climate in preconditioning fuels, synchronous regional fire activity in forested and non-forested lands suggests that atmospheric conditions during the fire season unify fire activity and can compound or supersede antecedent climatic stressors. Collectively, climate–fire relationships viewed through the lens of biophysical variables provide a more direct link to fuel flammability and wildfire activity than standard climate variables, thereby narrowing the gap in incorporating top-down climatic factors between empirical and process-based fire models...|$|R

40|$|Forest <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> rating {{based on}} sparse {{meteorological}} stations {{is known to}} be potentially misleading when assigned to larger areas of complex topography. This case study examines several <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> indices based on data from two meteorological stations at different elevations during a major drought period. This drought was caused by a persistent high pressure system, inducing a pronounced temperature inversion and its associated thermal belt with much warmer, dryer conditions in intermediate elevations. Thus, a massive drying of fuels, leading to higher <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> levels, and multiple fire occurrences at mid-slope positions were contrasted by moderate <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> especially in the valleys. The ability of <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> indices to resolve this situation was studied based on a comparison with the actual <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> as determined from expert observations, fire occurrences and fuel moisture measurements. The results revealed that, during temperature inversion, differences in daily cycles of meteorological parameters influence <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> and that these are not resolved by standard meteorological stations and <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> indices (calculated on a once-a-day basis).

In this paper we test the sensitivity of FWI values to both instantaneous and daily mean values, analyzing their effect on mean seasonal <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> (seasonal severity rating, SSR) and extreme <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> conditions (90 th percentile, FWI 90, and FWI> 30, FOT 30), with a special focus on its influence in climate change impact studies. To this aim, we analyzed reanalysis and regional climate model (RCM) simulations, and compared the resulting instantaneous and daily mean versions both in the present climate and in a future scenario. In particular, we were interested in determining the effect of these datasets on the projected changes obtained for the mean and extreme seasonal <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> conditions in future climate scenarios, as given by a RCM. Overall, our results warn against the use of daily mean data for the computation of present and future <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> conditions. Daily mean data lead to systematic negative biases of <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> calculations. Although the mean seasonal <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> indices might be corrected to compensate for this bias, <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> extremes (FWI 90 and specially FOT 30) cannot be reliably transformed to accommodate the spatial pattern and magnitude of their respective instantaneous versions, leading to inconsistent results when projected into the future. As a result, we advocate caution when using daily mean data and strongly recommend the application of the standard definition for its calculation as closely as possible. Threshold-dependent indices derived from FWI are not reliably represented by the daily mean version and thus can neither be applied for the estimation of future <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> season length and severity, nor for the estimation of future extreme events. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

LFM has been incorporated in <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> rating systems, such as the National <b>Fire</b> <b>Danger</b> Rating System (NFDRS) in the US (Deeming et al. 1978) and the Canadian Forest <b>Fire</b> <b>Danger</b> Rating System (CFFDRS) (Stocks et al. 1989). LFM can also be used by fire behavior models to determine energy needed for ignition and fire spread rate (Rothermel 1972). The direct measurement of LFM is done by collecting fresh field samples, drying them until all moisture is evaporated, and calculating the water content using the mass difference between fresh and dry samples (Lawson and Hawkes 1989, Pollet and Brown 2007). Field-sampled LFM represents conditions for a vegetation species at a single site and time, {{but it is difficult to}} extrapolate field measurements to larger regions and longer time periods.|$|R

Proper selection of a fuel model is a critical step in the mathematical modeling of fire behavior and <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> rating. This guide will facilitate {{the selection of the}} proper fire behavior fuel model and will allow comparison with <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> rating fuel models. The 13 fire behavior fuel models are presented in 4 fuel groups: grasslands, shrublands, timber, and slash. Each group comprises three or more fuel models; two or more photographs illustrate field situations relevant to each fuel model. The 13 fire behavior fuel models are cross- referenced to the 20 fuel models of the National <b>Fire</b> <b>Danger</b> Rating System by means of a similarity chart. Fire behavior fuel models and <b>fire</b> <b>danger</b> rating fuel models, along with the fire-carrying features of the model and its physical characteristics, are described in detail...|$|R
