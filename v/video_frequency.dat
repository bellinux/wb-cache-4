40|$|In {{order to}} meet {{stringent}} specifications of bandwidth flatness, differential gain and phase, and 75 Î© drive capability, high speed complementary bipolar processes are more suitable than CMOS processes for video switches and multiplexers. Traditional CMOS switches and multiplexers suffer from several disadvantages at <b>video</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Their switching time (typically 50 ns or so) is not fast enough for today's video applications, and they require external buffering in order to drive typical video loads. In addition, the small variation of the CMOS switch on-resistance with signal level (RON modulation) introduces unwanted distortion in differential gain and phase. Multiplexers based on complementary bipolar technology offer a better solution at <b>video</b> <b>frequencies.</b> The tradeoffs, of course, are higher power and cost. Functional block diagrams of the AD 8170 /AD 8174 /AD 8180 /AD 8182 bipolar video multiplexer are shown in Figure 1. The AD 8183 /AD 8185 video multiplexer is shown in Figure 2.
