50|$|The Mk.1 and Mk.1A {{computers}} were electromechanical, {{and many of}} their mechanical calculations required drive movements of precise speeds. They used reversible two-phase capacitor-run induction motors with tungsten contacts. These were stabilized primarily by rotary magnetic drag (eddy-current) slip clutches, similar to classical rotating-magnet speedometers, but with a much higher torque. One part of the drag was geared to the motor, and the other was constrained by a fairly stiff spring. This spring offset the null position of the contacts by an amount proportional to motor speed, thus providing velocity feedback. Flywheels mounted on the motor shafts, but coupled by magnetic drags, prevented contact chatter when the motor was at rest. Unfortunately, the flywheels must also have slowed down the servos somewhat.A more elaborate scheme, which placed a rather large flywheel and differential between the motor and the magnetic drag, eliminated <b>velocity</b> <b>error</b> for critical data, such as gun orders.|$|E

We investigate the significance of two-dimensional (2 -D) perturbations that arise {{in the presence of}} horizontal velocity gradients. The full electric response is calculated for two schematic geometries that contain horizontal velocity gradients, have a two-layer ocean with a layer of sediment beneath, and are described by four nondimensional parameters. When considered over the realistic ranges of oceanic aspect ratio (the ratio of water depth to the width of velocity), sediment thickness, and sediment conductivity, <b>velocity</b> <b>errors</b> arising from 2 -D perturbations are found to be less than a few percent of the dominant one-dimensional (1 -D) signal. All errors depend on the aspect ratio to the power of 1. 9 (1) for signals induced by the vertical (horizontal) component of the Earth's magnetic field. Depth-uniform <b>velocity</b> <b>errors</b> are proportional to the 1 -D sediment conductance ratio, whereas depth-varying <b>velocity</b> <b>errors</b> are independent of sediment thickness or conductivity. Errors are weakly (proportionally) dependent on the jet depth for signals induced by the vertical (horizontal) component of the magnetic field. Two-dimensional perturbations decay away from the forcing region with a half width of 0. 2 - 1 times the 1 -D effective water depth.

We found that to track the moving target appropriately, participants triggered more saccades with increasing target oscillation frequency to compensate for imperfect tracking gains. Our sinusoidal paradigm allowed us to show that saccade amplitude was better correlated with internal estimates of position and <b>velocity</b> <b>error</b> at saccade onset than with those parameters 100 ms before saccade onset as head-restrained studies have shown.

40|$|AbstractVelocity {{measurement}} errors were investigated for an array-based preclinical ultrasound scanner (Vevo 2100, FUJIFILM VisualSonics, Toronto, ON, Canada). Using a small-size rotating phantom {{made from a}} tissue-mimicking material, errors in pulse-wave Doppler maximum velocity measurements were observed. The extent of these errors was dependent on the Doppler angle, gate length, gate depth, gate horizontal placement and phantom <b>velocity.</b> <b>Errors</b> were observed {{to be up to}} 172 % at high beam–target angles. It was found that small gate lengths resulted in larger <b>velocity</b> <b>errors</b> than large gate lengths, a phenomenon that has not previously been reported (e. g., for a beam–target angle of 0 °, the error was 27. 8 % with a 0. 2 -mm gate length and 5. 4 % with a 0. 98 -mm gate length). The <b>error</b> in the <b>velocity</b> measurement with sample volume depth changed depending on the operating frequency of the probe. Some edge effects were observed in the horizontal placement of the sample volume, indicating a change in the array aperture size. The <b>error</b> in the <b>velocity</b> measurements increased with increased phantom velocity, from 22 % at 2. 4 cm/s to 30 % at 26. 6 cm/s. To minimise the impact of these errors, an angle-dependent correction factor was derived based on a simple ray model of geometric spectral broadening. Use of this angle-dependent correction factor reduces the maximum <b>velocity</b> measurement <b>errors</b> to < 25 % in all instances, significantly improving the current estimation of maximum velocity from pulse-wave Doppler ultrasound...|$|R
40|$|When objects move in our environment, the {{orientation}} of the visual axis in space requires the coordination of two types of eye movements: saccades and smooth pursuit. The principal input to the saccadic system is position error, whereas it is <b>velocity</b> <b>error</b> for the smooth pursuit system. Recently, {{it has been shown that}} catch-up saccades to moving targets are triggered and programmed by using <b>velocity</b> <b>error</b> in addition to position error. Here, we show that, when a visual target is flashed during ongoing smooth pursuit, it evokes a smooth eye movement toward the flash. The velocity of this evoked smooth movement is proportional to the position error of the flash; it is neither influenced by the velocity of the ongoing smooth pursuit eye movement nor by the occurrence of a saccade, but the effect is absent if the flash is ignored by the subject. Furthermore, the response started around 85 ms after the flash presentation and decayed with an average time constant of 276 ms. Thus this is the first direct evidence of a position input to the smooth pursuit system. This study shows further evidence for a coupling between saccadic and smooth pursuit systems. It also suggests that there is an interaction between position and <b>velocity</b> <b>error</b> signals in the control of more complex movements...|$|E
