Although Jeeps are also prominent in the show, the brand itself would not become a part of Chrysler until the AMC buyout that occurred in 1987.|$|E
5|$|A plug-in {{electric}} vehicle (PEV) is any motor vehicle {{that can be}} recharged from an external source of electricity, such as wall sockets, and the electricity stored in the rechargeable battery packs drives or contributes to drive the wheels. PEV is a subset of electric <b>vehicles</b> <b>that</b> includes all-electric or battery {{electric vehicle}}s (BEVs), plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs), and electric vehicle conversions of hybrid electric vehicles and conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. In China, plug-in electric vehicles are called new energy vehicles (NEVs).|$|E
5|$|By 26 August a new Czechoslovak {{representative}} {{requested the}} whole issue {{be removed from the}} Security Council's agenda. Shirley Temple Black visited Prague in August 1968 to prepare for becoming the US Ambassador for a free Czechoslovakia. However, after the 21 August invasion she became part of a U.S. Embassy-organized convoy of <b>vehicles</b> <b>that</b> evacuated U.S. citizens from the country. In August 1989, she returned to Prague as U.S. Ambassador, three months before the Velvet Revolution that ended 41 years of Communist rule.|$|E

5|$|Over {{four million}} {{journeys}} are made {{every day on}} the Underground network, over 1billion each year. An investment programme is attempting to reduce congestion and improve reliability, including £6.5billion (€7.7billion) spent before the 2012 Summer Olympics.

5|$|Owing to the 1960s {{setting of}} The Secret Service, Derek Meddings and the {{technicians}} {{of the special}} effects department received few commissions for scale models of <b>vehicles</b> <b>that</b> appeared futuristic. This left Unwin's vintage Ford Model T, Gabriel, as their main project, in addition to rendering vehicles and settings common to the decade in miniature and producing the optical enlargement and miniaturisation effects for the character of Harding. Wag Evans manufactured a full-size and two miniature versions (the last of differing scales) of Gabriel, fitting the larger car with belt-driven electric motors, a folding roof, upholstered interior, and a remote control mechanism.|$|E
5|$|PEV is a {{subcategory}} {{of electric}} <b>vehicles</b> <b>that</b> includes battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid vehicles, (PHEVs), and electric vehicle conversions of hybrid electric vehicles and conventional {{internal combustion engine}} vehicles. Even though conventional hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) have a battery that is continually recharged with power from {{the internal combustion engine}} and regenerative braking, they can not be recharged from an off-vehicle electric energy source, and therefore, they do not belong to the category of plug-in electric vehicles.|$|E

5|$|The 24th Infantry Division's three {{infantry}} regiments, {{which had}} a wartime strength of 3,000 each, were already below strength on their deployment, and heavy losses in the preceding two weeks had reduced their numbers further. The 21st Infantry had 1,100 men left, having suffered 1,433 casualties. The 34th Infantry had only 2,020 and the 19th had 2,276 men. There were another 2,007 men in the 24th Infantry Division artillery formations. Thus the division's total strength was 11,400. This was severely reduced from the 15,965 men and 4,773 <b>vehicles</b> <b>that</b> had arrived in Korea {{at the beginning of}} the month.|$|E
5|$|The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) {{measures}} the traffic volumes on its highways using a calculation called average annual daily traffic (AADT). This value {{is an expression}} of the number of <b>vehicles</b> <b>that</b> use a section of roadway on any average day of the year. When the department surveyed M-247 in 2009, the southernmost section near M-13 carried 6,135vehicles; the remainder carried 6,224vehicles. As a subset of these figures, 190commercial vehicles used the trunkline on average. This was an overall increase from 2008 when the sections carried 5,031and 5,573vehicles respectively, but a decrease from the 214commercial vehicles.|$|E
5|$|The {{highway is}} {{maintained}} by the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) {{who is responsible for}} constructing and maintaining highways in the state. As part of this role, ADOT surveys volumes of traffic on their highways. These surveys are most often presented in the form of annual average daily traffic (AADT), which is the number of <b>vehicles</b> <b>that</b> travel a road during an average day during the year. In 2009, ADOT calculated that an average of only 550 vehicles used the road daily. No part of the highway has been listed in the National Highway System, a system of roads in the United States important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E

5000|$|Upon {{activation}} {{the normal}} traffic light cycle is suspended {{and replaced by}} the [...] "preemption sequence": the traffic lights to all approaches to the intersection are switched to [...] "red" [...] {{with the exception of}} the light for the <b>vehicle</b> <b>that</b> has triggered the preemption sequence. Sometimes, an additional signal light is placed nearby to indicate to the preempting <b>vehicle</b> <b>that</b> the preempting sequence has been activated and to warn other motorists of the approach of an emergency vehicle. The normal traffic light cycle resumes after the sensor has been passed by the <b>vehicle</b> <b>that</b> triggered the preemption.|$|R
5|$|There {{are also}} several alumni owned <b>vehicles</b> <b>that</b> are painted to {{resemble}} the Wreck. These vehicles mimic {{the look and feel}} of the Reck but are not the Ramblin' Wreck. One of the most famous instances of mistaken identity occurred in 1988. A father-son duo of Georgia Tech alums attempted to lead the Tech football team onto the field at Sanford Stadium in Athens. After getting inside of the stadium with their gold 1924 Ford Model T, the two were finally stopped by Georgia officials who were informed the real Ramblin' Wreck had remained in Atlanta.|$|E
5|$|With {{the landing}} of Discovery on June 12, 1998, the Phase One program concluded. Techniques and {{equipment}} {{developed during the}} program assisted the development of Phase Two: initial assembly of the International Space Station (ISS). The arrival of the Destiny Laboratory Module in 2001 {{marked the end of}} Phase Two and the start of Phase Three, the final outfitting of the station, completed in 2012. In 2015, a reconfiguration of the American segment was completed to allow its docking ports to accommodate NASA-sponsored commercial crew <b>vehicles,</b> <b>that</b> are expected to start visiting the ISS in 2017.|$|E
5|$|A gritter, {{also known}} as a sander, salt {{spreader}} or salt truck, is found on most winter service vehicles. Indeed, the gritter is so commonly seen on winter service <b>vehicles</b> <b>that</b> the terms are sometimes used synonymously. Gritters are used to spread grit (rock salt), onto roads. The grit is stored in the large hopper on the rear of the vehicle, with a wire mesh over the top to prevent foreign objects from entering the spreading mechanism and hence becoming jammed. The salt is generally spread across the roadway by an impeller, attached by a hydraulic drive system to a small onboard engine. However, until the 1970s, the grit was often spread manually using shovels by men riding {{on the back of the}} truck, and some older spreading mechanisms still require grit be manually loaded into the impeller from the hopper.|$|E

5|$|A {{specialist}} {{was hired}} to enhance the game's artificial intelligence and give enemies more lifelike behaviour. In previous Tomb Raider games, enemies would simply run at Lara and attack immediately, whereas in Tomb Raider III, enemies can pop {{out of the dark}} and attack the player, or retreat back into the level and regroup to attack later. A stealth element partially inspired by Rare's 1997 hit GoldenEye 007 was also introduced, giving players the option of sneaking around and avoid detection. New <b>vehicles</b> <b>that</b> are critical to complete certain levels were added; the team also experimented with the idea of putting Lara on horseback, but they ultimately discarded it. The development of the game took eleven months to complete, and incorporating all the new ideas into the engine was considered the most difficult task of the project.|$|E
5|$|Certain weapons can be dual-wielded, {{allowing}} the player to trade accuracy, {{the use of}} grenades and melee attacks for raw firepower. The player can carry two weapons at a time (or three if dual-wielding; one weapon remains holstered), with each weapon having advantages and disadvantages in different combat situations. For example, most Covenant weapons eschew disposable ammo clips for a contained battery, which cannot be replaced if depleted. However, these weapons can overheat if fired continuously for prolonged periods. Human weapons are less effective at penetrating shields and require reloading, but cannot overheat due to prolonged fire. The player can carry a total of eight grenades (four human grenades, four Covenant) to dislodge and disrupt enemies. New in Halo 2 {{is the ability to}} board enemy <b>vehicles</b> <b>that</b> are near the player and traveling at low speeds. The player or AI latches onto the vehicle and forcibly ejects the other driver from the vehicle.|$|E
5|$|Hit & Run {{has seven}} levels, each with {{missions}} and sub-plot. The player can control one specific character in each level. The game's playable characters are Homer, Bart, Lisa, Marge, and Apu. Homer and Bart are played twice. When travelling on foot, the player character can walk, run, and perform {{three types of}} melee attacks: a normal kick, a jumping kick, and a smashing move. To drive, the player can either commandeer {{one of the many}} civilian <b>vehicles</b> <b>that</b> drive endlessly around town, or use a phone booth to select a car. The game's driving missions are also similar to those of Grand Theft Auto III. In both games, the player races against other characters, collects items before a timer runs out, and wrecks other cars.|$|E
