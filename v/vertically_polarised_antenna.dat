40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{possibility}} of replacing several high directive antennas with one single, multi-beam antenna for small cell microwave backhaul. An unconventional 28 GHz multi-beam backhaul antenna, built around a cylindrical Luneburg lens, has been designed and simulated. Additionally, a cylindrical Luneburg lens with permittivity distribution governed by air holes has been designed and simulated. This type of cylindrical lens antenna operates in a single plane and the two fundamental modes {{are determined by the}} lens thickness h, with TM 0 -mode propagation for h < λ/ 2 and TE 1 -mode propagation for λ/ 2 < h < λ. A <b>vertically</b> <b>polarised</b> <b>antenna</b> with nine coaxial ports in an arc array has been designed with a lens thickness of h = 2. 25 mm and a lens diameter of 16 λ. Port separation is 15. 7 º and the port arc array span 141. 3 º. The gain of each individual beam is above 20. 6 dB with beam widths of less than 5. 4 º. The hole lens antenna exhibits good matching between 26 GHz to 29. 8 GHz with a return loss below 16 dB for TM 0 -mode propagation and gain of 19 dB. The combination of these results show that a multi-beam backhaul antenna for smallcell wireless backhaul applications is plausible, including a possibility to construct the lens through 3 D printing.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this work}} were to investigate, design and implement beam steering antenna arrays for mobile and wireless applications using the genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimisation (PSO) techniques as optimisation design tools. Several antenna designs were implemented and tested: initially, a printed dipole antenna integrated with a duplex RF switch used for mobile base station antenna beam steering was investigated. A coplanar waveguide (CPW) to coplanar strip (CPS) transition was adopted to feed the printed dipole. A novel RF switch circuit, used to control the RF signal fed to the dipole antenna and placed directly before it, was proposed. The measured performance of the RF switch was tested and the results confirmed its viability. Then two hybrid coupled PIN diode phase shifters, using Branchline and Rat-Race ring coupler structures, were designed and tested. The generation of four distinct phase shifts was implemented and studied. The variations of the scattering parameters {{were found to be}} realistic, with an acceptable ± 2 phase shift tolerance. Next, antenna beam steering was achieved by implementing RF switches with ON or OFF mode functions to excite the radiating elements of the antenna array. The switching control process was implemented using a genetic algorithm (GA) method, subject to scalar and binary genes. Anti-phase feeding of radiating elements was also investigated. A ring antenna array with reflectors was modelled and analysed. An antenna of this type for mobile base stations was designed and simulation results are presented. Following this, a novel concept for simple beam steering using a uniform antenna array operated at 2. 4 GHz was designed using GA. The antenna is fed by a single RF input source and the steering elements are reactively tuned by varactor diodes in series with small inductors. The beam-control procedure was derived {{through the use of a}} genetic algorithm based on adjusting the required reactance values to obtain the optimum solution as indicated by the cost function. The GA was also initially used as an optimisation tool to derive the antenna design from its specification. Finally, reactive loading and time modulated switching techniques are applied to steer the beam of a circular uniformly spaced antenna array having a source element at its centre. Genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimisation (PSO) processes calculate the optimal values of reactances loading the parasitic elements, for which the gain can be optimised in a desired direction. For time modulated switching, GA and PSO also determine the optimal on and off times of the parasitic elements for which the difference in currents induced optimises the gain and steering of the beam in a desired direction. These methods were demonstrated by investigating a <b>vertically</b> <b>polarised</b> <b>antenna</b> configuration. A prototype antenna was constructed and experimental results compared with the simulations. Results showed that near optimal solutions for gain optimisation, sidelobe level reduction and beam steering are achievable by utilising these methods. In addition, a simple switching process is employed to steer the beam of a horizontally polarised circular antenna array. A time modulated switching process is applied through Genetic Algorithm optimisation. Several model examples illustrate the radiation beams and the switching time process of each element in the array...|$|E
40|$|The {{advent of}} body worn devices {{and the use}} of them {{for a wide range of}} applications, from {{entertainment}} to military purposes, indicate the need to investigate to the behaviour of antennas and wave propagation on the body in depth. Knowledge and understanding and of the on-body channel can lead to the design of efficient antennas and systems for wearable devices. The objective of this work is to identify the propagation mechanism on the body for different polarisation states at 2. 45 GHz. In particular, the effect of the body on the antenna performance with normal and parallel polarisation is studied and their capability in launching surface waves is evaluated. It is shown that both <b>vertically</b> and horizontally <b>polarised</b> <b>antennas</b> can launch a transverse magnetic (TM) Norton surface wave mode regardless of their polarisation states. However, horizontally <b>polarised</b> <b>antennas</b> do not launch the wave as strongly as <b>vertically</b> <b>polarised</b> <b>antennas.</b> Also, the change in the far field and near field behaviour of the antennas such as a dipole in proximity to the body is investigated and the observations lead to the design of a novel surface wave parasitic array. This new antenna is directive and can increase the path gain by almost 10 dB compared to other planar antennas. In addition, the effect of the polarization of the antenna on channel path gain is studied and channel cross polarization discrimination is quantified, using both simulation and measurement.

40|$|In {{traditional}} {{approaches to}} antenna characterisation, spectral and angular dispersion are modelled separately. In the paper, {{the dependence of}} the power radiated from ultra wideband (UWB) antennas jointly on frequency and direction is established experimentally. It is demonstrated that both omni-directional and directional antennas typically exhibit higher directivity with frequency, with the former experiencing a seven-fold increase {{with respect to the}} lowest frequency in the FCC UWB frequency range (3. 1 - 10. 6 GHz). The consequences of this behaviour are highlighted and the effect on the communications link is quantified. The effective available bandwidth of a system is found to be highly sensitive to the angular disposition of the antenna {{at each end of the}} link. It is shown that the bandwidth is severely limited in some directions, and careful orientation of the antennas is required to achieve full UWB operation for a range of antenna designs. The 10 dB bandwidth of a <b>vertically</b> <b>polarised</b> UWB <b>antenna</b> can be as little as 2 GHz in the equatorial plane when the joint dispersion is considered.

40|$|In this digital era, {{the usage}} of smart phones and mobile devices is {{becoming}} a norm in society with mobile communication quickly transitioned from voice oriented transmission to picture transmission to a more complex live video streaming. This latest development has demanded more capacity and higher bandwidth in communication links. Static links, which {{are the focus of}} this thesis, {{are an integral part of}} this mobile system in delivering high capacity data transmission using backhauls or nomadic links. Multi <b>polarised</b> <b>antennas</b> with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multiplexing can be employed to greatly enhance the capacity of a mobile system, especially at frequencies lower than 6 GHz, using their compact size. A practical antenna inherently exhibits elliptical polarisation though it may be designed to form linear or circular polarisation. Little attention has been given to this aspect of polarised waves as they have always been deemed as unwanted polarisation, although in practice, any <b>antenna</b> is elliptically <b>polarised</b> as it can never be perfectly circularly or linearly polarised. This work therefore aims to deliberately exploit this opportunity by forming antennas with elliptical polarisation to identify the advantages of doing so in order to improve orthogonality in comparison with linear polarisation. It was found that in order to achieve perfect orthogonality, it was more practical to set the magnitudes and phases of the co-polar and cross-polar linear components, which resulted in an improved co to cross polar ratio more than 20 dB better than linear polarisation in free space. A dual elliptically <b>polarised</b> <b>antenna</b> prototype was designed and evaluated in this work, which was evaluated both in free space and within an indoor measurement campaign.
