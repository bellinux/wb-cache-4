40|$|Dilution of {{sea water}} with {{isotonic}} sugar solution leaves {{the rate of}} cleavage of Arbacia eggs almost unchanged until the proportion of sea water is decreased to 20 or 25 <b>volumes</b> <b>per</b> cent.

No cleavage occurs in 2 <b>volumes</b> <b>per</b> cent sea water or in pure sugar solution. Eggs returned from these media to sea water resume cleavage and development. There is thus no relation between the rate of cleavage and the electrical conductivity of the medium, except possibly {{within the range of}} dilutions from 20 to 5 <b>volumes</b> <b>per</b> cent sea water.

40|$|The {{production}} of extracellular amylase by Bacillus subtilis {{has been studied}} in solid-state fermentation (SSF). In a sequential order, various process parameters were optimized for maximum amylase production. The tested process parameters were different solid substrates such as banana husk (BH), water melon husk (WMH), lentil bran (LB), wheat bran (WB), melon husk (MH) and maize oil cake (MOC), different incubation time (24 – 144 h), particle size (500 – 2500 μm), initial moisture content of the substrate (40 – 70 %, by mass <b>per</b> <b>volume),</b> inoculum size (10 – 60 %, by mass <b>per</b> <b>volume)</b> and inoculum concentration (10 – 60 %, by <b>volume</b> <b>per</b> mass).

Preliminary measurements of the photosynthetic capacity have been made for Chlorella vulgaris (UTEX 259), Neospongiococcum punctatum (UTEX 786), Stichococcus sp., and Gloeocapsa sp.
