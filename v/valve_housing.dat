25|$|The valvular {{event that}} causes such {{cavitating}} conditions to exist is the closing {{mechanics of the}} MHV. Several causes of cavitation relating to valve closure have been identified. Squeeze flow is cavitation that is said to occur as the occluder approaches the housing during closure and fluid is squeezed between the occluder and the <b>valve</b> <b>housing</b> causing a low pressure formation. Water hammer is cavitation caused by the sudden stop of the valve occluder as it contacts the <b>valve</b> <b>housing.</b> This sudden retardation of the fluid retrograde inertia is said to put the fluid under tension causing cavitation. Squeeze flow is said to form a cloud of bubbles at the circumferential lip of the occluder whereas water hammer {{is said to be}} seen as transient bubbles at the occlude housing.|$|E
25|$|Drive {{was taken}} from the rocking arm of an exhaust valve, a lever fixed to the <b>valve</b> <b>housing</b> {{transmitting}} impulses to the gun through a rod. Designed by Leutnant Otto Bernatzik, it was geared down to deliver a firing impulse every second revolution of the propeller, and fired at about 380 to 400 rounds per gun. As with other gears synchronizing the Schwarzlose gun, firing became erratic at high engine speeds.|$|E
25|$|The {{cavitation}} phenomenon {{can also}} be described using fluid mechanics. This can result from pressure oscillations, flow deceleration, tip vortices, streamline contraction, and squeeze jets. This last cause is the most contributive factor to cavitation. The squeeze jets are formed when the valve is closing and the blood between the occluder and <b>valve</b> <b>housing</b> is “squeezed” out to create a high-speed jet. This in turn creates intense vortices with very low pressures {{that can lead to}} cavitation.|$|E

25|$|Turbulence {{and high}} shear {{stresses}} are also major issues with MHV, {{as they can}} fracture the <b>valve</b> <b>housing</b> or components, or induce blood damage. A large flow gradient can lead to these factors, so flow separation and stagnation should be as small as possible. High stresses are created {{at the edges of}} the annular jet in caged-ball valves, in narrow regions {{at the edges of the}} major orifice jet in tilting-disc valves, and in regions immediately distal to the valve leaflets in bileaflet valves. The implications of blood damage from these stresses are discussed in the next section.|$|E
25|$|Bileaflet {{heart valves}} consist of two semicircular {{leaflets}} that rotate about struts {{attached to the}} <b>valve</b> <b>housing.</b> This design was introduced in 1979 and while {{they take care of}} {{some of the issues that}} were seen in the other models, bileaflets are vulnerable to backflow and so they cannot be considered as ideal. Bileaflet valves do, however, provide much more natural blood flow than caged-ball or tilting-disc implants. One of the main advantages of these valves is that they are well tolerated by the body. Only a small amount of blood thinner is needed to be taken by the patient each day in order to prevent clotting of the blood when flowing through the valve.|$|E

2500|$|It may be {{desirable}} for the diver {{to have some}} control over the flow characteristics of the demand valve. The usual adjustable aspects are cracking pressure and the feedback from flow rate to internal pressure of the second stage housing. The inter-stage pressure of surface supplied demand breathing apparatus is controlled manually at the control panel, and does not automatically adjust to the ambient pressure {{in the way that}} most scuba first stages do, as this feature is controlled by feedback to the first stage from ambient pressure. This has the effect that the cracking pressure of a surface supplied demand valve will vary slightly with depth, so some manufacturers provide a manual adjustment knob {{on the side of the}} demand <b>valve</b> <b>housing</b> to adjust spring pressure on the downstream valve, which controls the cracking pressure. The knob is known to commercial divers as [...] "dial-a-breath". A similar adjustment is provided on some high-end scuba demand valves, to allow the user to manually tune the breathing effort at depth ...|$|E
2500|$|The first {{artificial}} heart valve was the caged-ball, which utilizes a metal cage to house a silicone elastomer ball. When {{blood pressure in}} the chamber of the heart exceeds that of {{the pressure on the}} outside of the chamber the ball is pushed against the cage and allows blood to flow. At the completion of the heart's contraction, the pressure inside the chamber drops and is lower than beyond the valve, so the ball moves back against the base of the valve forming a seal. In 1952, Charles A. Hufnagel implanted caged-ball heart valves in ten patients (six survived the operation), marking the first long-term success in prosthetic heart valves. A similar valve was invented by Miles [...] "Lowell" [...] Edwards and Albert Starr in 1960 (commonly referred to as the Starr-Edwards Silastic Ball Valve). The first human implant was on Sept 21, 1960. It consisted of a silicone ball enclosed in a cage formed by wires originating from the <b>valve</b> <b>housing.</b> Caged ball valves have a high tendency to form blood clots, so the patient must have a high degree of anti-coagulation, usually with a target INR of 2.5-3.5. Edwards Lifesciences discontinued production of the Starr-Edwards valve in 2007.|$|E
