40|$|Abstract—The present work {{deals with}} the {{structural}} analysis of turbine blades and modeling of turbine blades. A common failure mode for turbine machines is high cycle of fatigue of compressor and turbine blades due to high dynamic stresses caused by blade vibration and resonance within the operation range of the machinery. In this work, proper damping system will be analyzed to reduce the vibrating blade. The main focus {{of the work is}} the modeling of under platform damper to evaluate the dynamic analysis of turbine-blade vibrations. The system is analyzed using Bond graph technique. Bond graph {{is one of the most}} convenient ways to represent a system from the physical aspect in foreground. It has advantage of putting together multi-energy domains of a system in a single representation in a unified manner. The bond graph model of dry friction damper is simulated on SYMBOLS-shakti ® software. In this work, the blades are modeled as Timoshenko beam.

40|$|AbstractWind-excited {{vibrations}} in {{the frequency}} range of 10 to 50 Hz due to vortex shedding often cause fatigue failures in the cables of overhead transmission lines. Damping devices, such as the Stockbridge dampers, have been in use {{for a long time}} for supressing these <b>vibrations.</b> The <b>dampers</b> are conveniently modelled by means of their driving point impedance, measured in the lab over the frequency range under consideration. The cables can be modelled as strings with additional small bending stiffness. The main problem in modelling the vibrations does however lay in the aerodynamic forces, which usually are approximated by the forces acting on a rigid cylinder in planar flow. In the present paper, the wind forces are represented by stochastic processes with arbitrary crosscorrelation in space; the case of a Kármán vortex street on a rigid cylinder in planar flow is contained as a limit case in this approach. The authors believe that this new view of the problem may yield useful results, particularly also concerning the reliability of the lines and the probability of fatigue damages...|$|R

40|$|Damping due to {{internal}} friction in taut wire cables undergoing bending vibrations is negligible in many cases.

The present work deals with {{the analysis of the}} dynamic behavior of such cables. The local mechanical properties of a wire cable are identified experimentally. In particular, the moment-curvature-relationship is determined experimentally at every location of the wire cable which is subjected to dynamic flexural deformations.

Simulation results show how the risk of bundle collapse and the load on the spacer is reduced when the number of subconductors in the bundle is increased.

The evaluation {{is based on a}} prototype steel building designed using four different seismicresistant frames: (a) conventional moment resisting frames (MRFs); (b) MRFs with viscous dampers; (c) SC-MRFs; or (d) SC-MRFs with viscous dampers. All frames are designed according to Eurocode 8, and have the same column/beam cross-sections and similar periods of <b>vibration.</b> Viscous <b>dampers</b> are designed to reduce the peak story drift under the design basis earthquake (DBE) from 1. 8 % to 1. 2 %. Losses are estimated by developing vulnerability functions according to the FEMA P- 58 methodology, which considers uncertainties in earthquake ground motion, structural response, and repair costs. Both the probability of collapse and the probability of demolition due to excessive residual story drifts are taken into account. Incremental dynamic analyses are conducted using models capable to simulate all limit states up to collapse. A parametric study on the effect of the residual story drift threshold beyond which is less expensive to rebuild a structure than to repair is also conducted. It is shown that viscous dampers are more effective than post-tensioning for seismic intensities equal or lower than the maximum considered earthquake (MCE). Posttensioning is effective in reducing repair costs only for seismic intensities higher than the DBE. The paper also highlights the effectiveness of combining post-tensioning and supplemental viscous damping by showing that the SC-MRF with viscous dampers achieves significant repair cost reductions compared to the conventional MRF...|$|R
40|$|Inclined {{stay cables}} on {{cable-stayed}} bridges {{are prone to}} wind-induced vibrations due to their long flexible nature and low structural damping. Severe stay cable vibrations under either the combined effect of rain and wind or wind only have been observed in field and wind tunnel tests which caused great concerns to bridge designers. To suppress these <b>vibrations,</b> fluid <b>dampers</b> are often attached to the stay cables near the anchorages. In order to facilitate effective and economical design of dampers for stay cable vibration mitigation, thorough understanding of both the vibration characteristics and {{the dynamics of the}} cable-damper system is necessary. Nevertheless, existing studies are limited to deterministic-based analysis of which the uncertainties of structural parameters (such as cable tension and damper capacity) and wind parameters (such as speed, direction, etc.) over the service life of a bridge are totally neglected. Thus, to provide complete information regarding the aerodynamic response of a damped cable, the problem should be more rationally studied from a probabilistic-based sense. This would offer bridge engineers a more reliable analytical tool for performance assessment of cable-damper systems. The current study aims at improving the current practice of external damper design by proposing a time-variant reliability-based framework model of a damped stay cable subjected to wind load conditions. Two types of cable vibrations that are more probable, i. e. rain-wind-induced cable vibrations, and/or critical, i. e. dry-inclined cable galloping, than the others are investigated. The research outcomes are drawn to ensure reliability of design and enhance maintainability of external dampers for bridge stay cables.
