5000|$|Also per ACSM, {{the type}} of {{surveying}} known as [...] "land surveying" [...] is the detailed study or inspection, as by gathering information through observations, measurements in the field, questionnaires, or research of legal instruments, and data analysis in the support of planning, designing, and establishing of property boundaries. It involves the re-establishment of cadastral surveys and land boundaries based on documents of record and historical evidence, as well as certifying surveys (as required by statute or local ordinance) of subdivision plats or maps, registered land surveys, judicial surveys, and space delineation. Land surveying can include associated services such as mapping and related data accumulation, construction layout surveys, precision measurements of length, angle, elevation, area, and volume, as well as horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>control</b> <b>surveys,</b> and the analysis and utilization of land survey data.|$|R
40|$|The United States Naval Oceanographic Office (NAVOCEANO) conducts {{worldwide}} hydrographic {{surveys in}} accordance with the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) S- 44 hydrographic survey standards. The current approach to meeting IHO standards requires the use of shore-based assets to establish and maintain <b>vertical</b> <b>control</b> via in-situ water level measurements. NAVOCEANO is upgrading its shipboard mission systems to support use of the vertical component of Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements for <b>vertical</b> <b>control</b> of hydrographic <b>survey</b> data. Use of GPS positioning for <b>vertical</b> <b>control</b> simplifies hydrographic <b>survey</b> operations by reducing the need for shore-based infrastructure for water level measurements and by allowing for the production of data products in a tactical time frame. GPS-based <b>vertical</b> <b>control</b> also offers the potential for a more seamless vertical datum from deep water through shallow water and up onto shore. However, this approach to <b>vertical</b> <b>control</b> presents new challenges in the need to define the separation between the ellipsoid and the required vertical datum. Precise point positioning (PPP) techniques make use of GPS satellite clock corrections and satellite orbit corrections which are freely available via the Internet. PPP processing is a post-time activity, lagging data acquisition by the 18 hours to 24 hours needed {{to gain access to the}} correction values. Positioning accuracies of better than 20 cm horizontal (95 % confidence) and better than 30 cm vertical (95 % confidence) have been demonstrated with PPP techniques using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software packages. An integrated survey system configured with current state-of-the-art equipment for the sonar, motion sensor, and profiling sensor can meet IHO order 1 survey requirements using a PPP-based GPS track-line when the separation uncertainty is suitably controlled...|$|R

40|$|Abstract]: Environmental {{conditions}} in underground coal mines effect lateral refraction when surveying {{with a regular}} theodolite. Xstrata Coal’s Oaky North Mine situated 26 Km east of Tieri in Central Queensland’s Bowen Basin has overcome these environmental conditions by utilising gyrotheodolites to <b>control</b> the underground <b>survey</b> <b>network.</b> This project studies the environmental conditions effecting lateral refraction and how Oaky North Mine utilises gyrotheodolites to <b>control</b> the underground <b>survey</b> <b>network.</b> Oaky North Mine is an underground longwall coal operation, producing approximately 5 million tonnes of sub-bituminous, medium volatile coal per annum. Two pairs of parallel tunnels (gateroads) with cross cuts every 100 m are driven using a continuous miner for a length of approximately 3. 4 Km. These gateroads form the maingate and tailgate of the longwall block. The demand for an accurate underground control network is high. Typically, accuracies of ± 50 mm are expected allowing a breakthrough tolerance of ± 100 mm. The ability to establish accurate control networks and perform associated surveys is restricted by lateral refraction. The path of light through the atmosphere {{is influenced by the}} inhomogenities of the refractive index. This refractive effect deteriorates the pointing accuracy of survey lines. Currently, there is no available method to accurately correct these systematic errors. This project investigates whether literature research supporting the use of a gyrotheodolite, will improve breakthrough errors of an open ended traverse or when compared to the readings from TCRA 1203 vary sufficiently to be outside accepted tolerances. Specifically, in this project, the gyrotheodolite used is the DMT (Deutsche Montan Technologie) Gyromat 2000, permanently fixed to a Wild T 2 theodolite. The Gyromat 2000 is a fully automated high precision (1. 5 cm every 1 Km) surveying gyroscope with a measuring time < 10 mins...|$|R
5000|$|The {{requirement}} for accurate maps in Australia {{led to the}} development of a control network of Trig stations. The word [...] "trig" [...] is short for trigonometric. Trig stations can be located on landmarks such as hills or high man-made structures such as buildings, or grain silos or water reservoirs. The process of triangulation was used as the method to provide the locations of the trig stations, which were then used to connect to smaller scale surveys or for mapping.The geodetic infrastructure in New South Wales incorporates approximately 6,000 traditional trigonometric stations that formed the backbone of the <b>survey</b> <b>control</b> <b>network</b> before the introduction of more than 160 CORSnet-NSW stations.TP5865 - Collaroy Trig station is located on top of the heritage Collaroy Reservoir.|$|R

Keeping the ageing passive geodetic infrastructure current and ready for utilisation requires regular maintenance such as fit-for-purpose assessments, verification of owner records, contact details, access details, and (most importantly) recent, time-stamped Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) observations. As this level of maintenance is neither viable nor justifiable for the entire network of trig stations in the modern era, LPI has selected a subset of ‘high-scoring’ trig stations based upon a number of factors including a ‘TrigStar’ rating, monument quality and significance within the contexts of <b>survey</b> <b>network,</b> local community and heritage. After the successful completion of a campaign-style pilot project in the Central West, and subsequent campaigns on the South Coast, in Northern NSW and in Southern NSW, LPI continues to carry out this trig rationalisation and targeted upgrade across the State. LPI plans to complete its first pass of trig maintenance and upgrade before the realisation of the nation’s next-generation datum in 2015. This paper outlines how this method provides an effective strategy to maintain geodetic infrastructure across NSW, connect traditional survey infrastructure with modern-day satellite-based positioning and contribute new GNSS observations towards the next-generation Australian datum...|$|R

In theory, <b>vertical</b> <b>controls</b> in the gasoline industry can produce both positive and negative effects. Many <b>vertical</b> <b>controls</b> can increase efficiency, both operations and in the transactions between refiners and retail outlet.

This investigation aimed at assessing <b>vertical</b> <b>control,</b> by cephalometric measurements, during the treatment of Angle Class II Division 1 maloc-clusion. Thirty cases, selected from the files of the São Leopoldo Man-dic Dental Research Center, Brazil, of subjects with Angle Class II Divi-sion 1 malocclusion and facial hyperdivergence, were used in this study. The patients were treated using a combined extraoral appliance during a mean treatment time of 1. 1 years. Pre- and posttreatment cephalomet-ric measurements were compared to assess <b>vertical</b> <b>control.</b> The results were submitted to ANOVA (p = 5 %). The ANOVA test revealed no sta-tistically significant difference between the pretreatment and posttreat-ment values of OP (Occlusal plane angle) and SN. MP. While there was a decrease in Y-axis, FMA, and PP. MP, there was an increase in SN. PP, Co-Go, AFH, PFH, and FHI.
