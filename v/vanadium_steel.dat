5|$|Approximately 85% of {{vanadium}} produced {{is used as}} ferrovanadium or as a steel additive. The considerable {{increase of}} strength in steel containing small amounts of vanadium was discovered in the early 20th century. Vanadium forms stable nitrides and carbides, resulting in {{a significant increase in}} the strength of steel. From that time on, <b>vanadium</b> <b>steel</b> was used for applications in axles, bicycle frames, crankshafts, gears, and other critical components. There are two groups of <b>vanadium</b> <b>steel</b> alloys. Vanadium high-carbon steel alloys contain 0.15% to 0.25% vanadium, and high-speed tool steels (HSS) have a vanadium content of 1% to 5%. For high-speed tool steels, a hardness above HRC 60 can be achieved. HSS steel is used in surgical instruments and tools. Powder-metallurgic alloys contain up to 18% percent vanadium. The high content of vanadium carbides in those alloys increases wear resistance significantly. One application for those alloys is tools and knives.|$|E

40|$|Vanadium as an {{important}} alloying element in steels was initially associated with the properties achieved following tempering. Interest in the microstructure was stimulated by the advent of transmission electron microscopes with a resolution of ~ 1 nm together with {{selected area electron diffraction}} techniques. A second timely development was that of controlled rolling, particularly of plate and sheet products. The scope of this review will include the historical background on quenched and tempered <b>vanadium</b> <b>steels,</b> precipitation during isothermal aging, conventional controlled rolling and during thin slab direct charging and the development of strength and toughness in <b>vanadium</b> microalloyed <b>steels.</b> The characterisation of microstructure, in particular the methods for the analysis of the chemical composition of precipitates, has progressed since the availability of X-ray energy dispersive analysis in the 1970 s, and the role played by electron energy loss spectroscopy in providing quantitative analysis of carbon and nitrogen in <b>vanadium</b> microalloyed <b>steels</b> will be presented. There are still many topics involving <b>vanadium</b> microalloyed <b>steels</b> that are controversial. These include the nucleation sequence of homogeneous precipitates of vanadium carbonitride and whether this occurs coherently, the composition of the vanadium precipitates, the nucleation mechanism for interphase precipitation, the importance of strain induced precipitation in austenite of vanadium carbonitride, the contributions of both interphase precipitation and random precipitation in ferrite to the yield strength, {{and the role of the}} process route parameters in developing properties. These topics will be considered in this paper which concentrates on hot rolled <b>vanadium</b> microalloyed <b>steels</b> placed in the context of pertinent research on other alloys...|$|R
50|$|Reheat {{cracking}} {{is a type}} of cracking {{that occurs}} in HSLA steels, particularly chromium, molybdenum and <b>vanadium</b> <b>steels,</b> during postheating. The phenomenon has also been observed in austenitic stainless steels. It is caused by the poor creep ductility of the heat affected zone. Any existing defects or notches aggravate crack formation. Things that help prevent reheat cracking include heat treating first with a low temperature soak and then with a rapid heating to high temperatures, grinding or peening the weld toes, and using a two layer welding technique to refine the HAZ grain structure.|$|R

25|$|The {{front axle}} was drop forged {{as a single}} piece of <b>vanadium</b> <b>steel.</b> Ford twisted many axles through eight full {{rotations}} (2880 degrees) and sent them to dealers to be put on display to demonstrate its superiority. The Model T did not have a modern service brake. The right foot pedal applied a band around a drum in the transmission, thus stopping the rear wheels from turning. The previously mentioned parking brake lever operated band brakes acting {{on the inside of the}} rear brake drums, which were an integral part of the rear wheel hubs. Optional brakes that acted on the outside of the brake drums were available from aftermarket suppliers.|$|E
2500|$|Although it was uncommon, {{the drive}} bands could {{fall out of}} adjustment, {{allowing}} the car to creep, particularly when cold, adding another hazard to attempting to start the car: a person cranking the engine could be forced backward while still holding the crank as the car crept forward, although it was nominally in neutral. As the car utilized a wet clutch, this condition could also occur in cold weather, when the thickened oil prevents the clutch discs from slipping freely. Power reached the differential through a single universal joint attached to a torque tube which drove the rear axle; some models (typically trucks, but available for cars, as well) could be equipped with an optional two-speed Ruckstell rear axle shifted by a floor-mounted lever which provided an underdrive gear for easier hill climbing.

40|$|Abstract. Hot-rolling direct {{quenching}} and partitioning (HDQ&P) processes {{were applied to}} both low carbon high silicon <b>vanadium</b> micro-alloyed <b>steel</b> and low carbon low silicon steel with phosphorus addition. Proeutectoid ferrite with an area fraction of about 30 % was introduced {{into some of the}} sheets. Microstructures were characterized using SEM, TEM and XRD. Mechanical properties were investigated by means of uniaxial tensile test. Austenite stabilization, retained austenite stability, tensile deformation and fracture were comprehensively analyzed by making the comparison between the two steels and between the sheets with and without ferrite considering the different precipitation statuses in ferrite. Experimental results showed that the high silicon <b>vanadium</b> micro-alloyed <b>steel</b> contained more retained austenite with higher stability compared with the low silicon phosphorus added steel. Filled with much more carbides with larger sizes, the martensite in the low silicon phosphorus added steel exhibited a much salient tempered feature. The high silicon <b>vanadium</b> added <b>steel</b> possessed higher strength and ductility than the low silicon phosphorus added steel. The introduction of ferrite can result in an extremely obvious post-necking elongation drop in the low silicon phosphorus added steel.

50|$|However, during tempering, {{elements}} like chromium, vanadium, and molybdenum precipitate {{with the}} carbon. If the steel contains fairly low concentrations of these elements, the softening {{of the steel}} can be retarded until much higher temperatures are reached, when compared to those needed for tempering carbon steel. This allows the steel to maintain its hardness in high temperature or high friction applications. However, this also requires very high temperatures during tempering, to achieve a reduction in hardness. If the steel contains large amounts of these elements, tempering may produce an increase in hardness until a specific temperature is reached, {{at which point the}} hardness will begin to decrease. For instance, molybdenum steels will typically reach their highest hardness around 315 C whereas <b>vanadium</b> <b>steels</b> will harden fully when tempered to around 371 C. When very large amounts of solutes are added, alloy steels may behave like precipitation hardening alloys, which do not soften at all during tempering.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Vanadium</b> microalloyed <b>steels</b> {{with high}} yield {{strength}} (≈ 600 MPa), good toughness and ductility {{have been successfully}} produced in commercial thin slab casting plants employing direct rolling after casting. Because of the high solubility of VN and VC, most of the vanadium {{is likely to remain}} in solution during casting, equalisation and rolling. While some vanadium is precipitated in austenite as cuboids and pins the grain boundaries, a major fraction is available for dispersion strengthening of ferrite. Despite a coarse as-cast grain size, significant grain refinement can be achieved by repeated recrystallisation during hot rolling. Consequently, a fine and uniform ferrite grain structure is produced in the final strip. Increasing the V and N levels increases dispersion strengthening which occurs together with a finer ferrite grain size. The addition of titanium to a <b>vanadium</b> containing <b>steel,</b> decreases the yield strength due to the formation of V-Ti(N) particles in austenite during both casting and equalisation. These large particles reduced the amount of V and N available for subsequent precipitation of fine (~ 5 nm) V rich dispersion strengthening particles in ferrite...|$|R

40|$|A "direct measurement" of {{the impact}} {{toughness}} of both Tempcore and microalloyed with <b>vanadium</b> reinforcing <b>steel</b> bars, of the same strength class (50 OMPa nominal yield stress), is undertaken. The term "direct measurement" means that V-notched specimens with the original round section of the bars (and not with the standard rectangular one) are used, mentioned here as direct V-notched (DVN) specimens. The major complications encountered with them are the use of non-standard geometry (Charpy V-notched, CVN), the variable size of the bars and the composite microstructure of the Tempcore reinforcing steel. It {{has been shown that}} the toughness characteristics of reinforcing steels may be estimated by the CVN impact test using direct (DVN) specimens.
