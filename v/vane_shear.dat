In order to obtain a high strength modelling silty clay for use in centrifuge model tests of soil-pipeline interaction, direct <b>shear</b> tests, <b>shear</b> <b>vane</b> tests and cone penetration tests were conducted to investigate its shear strength behaviour. [...] This thesis first presents some background on the shear strength of soils and measurement techniques. The details of the direct shear tests, the <b>shear</b> <b>vane</b> tests, the cone penetration tests and centrifuge modelling are also discussed. The silty clays used in this study were kaolin and a kaolin-silt mixture; the plasticity indices were 30. 6 % and 19. 5 % respectively. The kaolin-silt mixture (K-S) was obtained by mixing equal amounts of kaolin and silt by weight. [...] Direct <b>shear</b> and <b>shear</b> <b>vane</b> tests were conducted on both clays at different vertical stresses under various overconsolidation ratios (OCR's). This thesis presents these test procedures and the test results. Cone penetration tests were also conducted in a centrifuge at 50 gravities to verify the results from the direct <b>shear</b> and <b>shear</b> <b>vane</b> tests and to correlate the cone penetration resistance to the undrained shear strength from <b>shear</b> <b>vane</b> and direct <b>shear</b> tests. Centrifuge modelling principles and the current methods to convert cone tip resistance to shear strength are also presented. Test results show that the shear strength of K-S is higher than that of pure kaolin. Shear strengths of heavily overconsolidated clays obtained from the <b>shear</b> <b>vane</b> tests are higher than those obtained from the direct shear tests.

40|$|The <b>shear</b> <b>vane</b> test is {{a method}} of {{determining}} the in-situ undrained strength and remolded shear strength of cohesive soils. During the <b>shear</b> <b>vane</b> test, an increasing torque is applied until the surrounding soil goes to failure. When the torque at failure is known, the shear strength can be determined {{by means of an}} idealized and simplified formula which correlates torque and shear strength. Previous tests have shown that several aspects of cohesive soil material behavior such as anisotropy, strain softening (progressive failure) and strain rate, which are not incorporated in the simplified formula, affect the measured strength from the <b>shear</b> <b>vane</b> test. This implies that the interpretation of the undrained shear strength from the <b>shear</b> <b>vane</b> test is more complicated than the simplified and idealized formula used today. In this report, numerical simulations have been conducted in Plaxis 2 D and Plaxis 3 D in order to investigate to which extent progressive failure (softening), anisotropy and strain rate affect the measured strength from the <b>shear</b> <b>vane</b> test. The material models used were Mohr-Coulomb, Geofuture Soft Clay (a user defined material model developed by NTNU) and the total stress based NGI ADP model. The Mohr-Coulomb material model was applied in Plaxis 2 D and 3 D {{to determine the effects of}} progressive failure. From the Mohr-Coulomb simulations conducted, the effect of progressive failure from the 2 D and 3 D simulations were 2 % and 4 % respectively. The simulations conducted seem to suggest that the effect of progressive failure can be neglected when using the Mohr-Coulomb material model. The Geofuture material model was applied in Plaxis 2 D to determine the effects of strain rate during the <b>shear</b> <b>vane</b> test. Several simulations were conducted in which the time to failure varied. Based on the simulations conducted, a tenfold increase in time to failure decreases the measured strength by 7 - 8 %. The NGI ADP material model was applied in Plaxis 3 D to determine to which extent anisotropy affects the strength determined in the <b>shear</b> <b>vane</b> test. The degree of anisotropy was measured by the plasticity index (Ip) of the soil.

The early age strength development of shotcrete is very important as it influences the determination of safe re-entry times beneath the tunnel heading. This study has examined the possible application of a handheld soil <b>Vane</b> <b>Shear</b> Tester and a handheld Auger Penetrometer for testing the early age strength of shotcrete. This is achieved by measuring the shear strength, as previous research in this area indicates that the shear failure dominates the early age resistance of shotcrete. The investigation involved testing of three techniques, which resulted in readings of both compressive and shear strengths. Shear testing involved a combination of the <b>Vane</b> <b>Shear</b> Tester and the Auger Penetrometer which obtains its readings through Auger Penetration and rotation.

The focus of this project was to establish the rotational <b>shear</b> <b>vane</b> as a useful tool in avalanche safety work as well as develop a robust method for measuring the applied torque. A new and novel way of measuring the torque on a rotational <b>shear</b> <b>vane</b> has been developed to illustrate its effectiveness. The new system measures the power supplied to a cordless drill to get an indication of the applied torque. This was done because {{it was found that the}} earlier method of using a strain gauge/cantilever system repeatedly failed to work, largely due to complexity. The snow probe in its present embodiment has been shown to provide a good clear indication of the snow profile under easily repeated circumstances. Shear strength results are at this stage not sufficiently for reliable quantitative results. However the probe in its present form is able to give pictorial impressions of the snow pack that compare well to current hand hardness profiles derived from snow pit methods. Even in its current form the snow probe is able to collect useful snow profile data in a matter of minutes, much quicker than conventional snow pit methods. A loose relationship was found to exist between the approach angle of a <b>shear</b> <b>vane</b> blade and the clarity of the snow profile. These relationships are relatively inaccurate at present due to lack of rotational velocity data and therefore pproach angle data.

40|$|Many {{harbours}} in {{the world}} suffer from high siltation rates in their basins. To guarantee safe shipping, harbour authorities have to maintain the navigable depth by having dredged large amounts of mud. Some authorities relate the navigable depth to a depth at which the density is equal to a certain value, e. g. 1200 kg/m 3. However, the shear strength might be a more direct criterion to relate the navigable depth to. A research project is conducted to develop a model to describe the consolidation behaviour and strength evolution of mud layers. The third series of experiments for this project, executed at Delft University of Technology, are described in this report. The {{analysis of the data}} is left for future work. The sedimentation and consolidation of Dollard mud was simulated in segmented consolidation columns. By using segments well-defined and undisturbed samples of the mud bed were obtained. For this reason, more accurate <b>shear</b> <b>vane</b> measurements of the samples could be done than if conventional consolidation columns had been used. Four segmented consolidation columns and one conventional consolidation column were set up. To study the time evolution of the strength of the mud bed, the segmented columns were dismantled at different times. After the dismantling, <b>shear</b> <b>vane</b> tests were carried out and density measurements were done with a conductivity probe. The density profiles of the mud layer in the conventional column were measured with a gamma-ray densimeter. Pore water pressures were measured at several times. From these measurements effective stresses and permeabilities were calculated. Various rheological parameters were derived from four different types of <b>shear</b> <b>vane</b> measurements. Flow curves were also measured. It turned out that significant segregation occurred, resulting in a mud bed formed on top of a layer of approximately 5 - 8 cm with a relatively large coarse silt fraction and high densities.

Computer simulations were calibrated with the field measurements, and {{used to evaluate the}} stability and safety of newly constructed sludge embankments...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an assessment of}} the suitability of a laboratory vane apparatus, a cone penetrometer as well as a <b>shear</b> <b>vane</b> tester and a pocket penetrometer for determination of the parameters of the undrained shear strength of fly ash from the Power Plant “Skawina”. The suitability of the cone penetrometer and the laboratory vane apparatus for the determination of the undrained shear strength of the fly ash has been shown. On the bases of the obtained test results,, drained and undrained shear strengths of the subsoil made of the fly ash under the square pad foundation were calculated according to Eurocode 7. The calculations of the ultimate resistance of the drained subsoil showed that it was several times bigger than its value in undrained conditions. This confirms the need for the proper determination of the angle of internal friction and cohesion as well as the undrained shear strength of fly ashes...|$|R
