5|$|After Burke's first {{campaign}} for alderman, {{he has been}} unopposed in most of his re-election campaigns. In 2007, Burke faced his first opponent since 1971, a school teacher who had never run for office. A Burke supporter unsuccessfully challenged the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opponent's ballot application, but the case was tied up in court {{for most of the}} campaign, and Burke went on to win with nearly 90 percent of the vote.|$|E
5|$|Coffee Stain Studios {{released}} Goat Simulator worldwide on 1 April 2014, {{aware that}} tying the date with April Fools' Day may raise doubts on the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game. Those that pre-ordered the game through Coffee Stain's website received early {{access to the}} title three days ahead of release. The official release trailer for Goat Simulator is a loose parody of the highly praised teaser trailer released for Dead Island, showing, among shots of the game, reversed slow-motion footage of the goat crashing through a building after being launched from an exploding gas station.|$|E
5|$|However, other taxonomists {{challenged}} the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> species {{as early as}} 1939, noting that the Lānai hookbill was only known from one specimen and arguing that it was merely an aberrant and partially albino female ōū. The hookbill's validity was not confirmed until 1989 when the specimen's skull was removed and examined. The bird's cranial osteology, myology, plumage, and bill morphology confirmed the distinctness of the species.|$|E

5|$|Some authors {{challenge}} the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second step (mild opioids) and, pointing to their higher toxicity and low efficacy, argue that mild opioids could {{be replaced by}} small doses of strong opioids (with {{the possible exception of}} tramadol due to its demonstrated efficacy in cancer pain, its specificity for neuropathic pain, and its low sedative properties and reduced potential for respiratory depression in comparison to conventional opioids).|$|E
5|$|Teo's counsel {{submitted}} {{that the}} nature and conditions of her detention rendered the detention unlawful.

In general, where {{the manner in which}} the detention is conducted is alleged to be unlawful, the detainee's remedy is to challenge the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conditions of the detention, not the lawfulness of the detention itself.|$|E

5|$|The {{third and}} final Part lists some of Kennedy's reservations. He would not say that the {{defendant}} must be present at all stages of the trial. There should be a reluctance to consider the applicability of Article 75 of Protocol I, since the U.S. never signed it and thus it is not binding. Kennedy writes that he feels {{it was not necessary}} to delve into the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conspiracy charge, and he expresses no view on the merits of the other limitations of the commission noted in Part V of the Decision.|$|E
5|$|The <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Euclidean {{algorithm}} can {{be proven}} by a two-step argument. In the first step, the final nonzero remainder r'N−1 {{is shown to}} divide both a and b. Since {{it is a common}} divisor, it must be {{less than or equal to}} the greatest common divisor g. In the second step, it is shown that any common divisor of a and b, including g, must divide r'N−1; therefore, g must be less than or equal to r'N−1. These two conclusions are inconsistent unless r'N−1 = g.|$|E

5|$|There are {{questions}} about the external <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> AS diagnosis. That is, {{it is unclear whether}} there is a practical benefit in distinguishing AS from HFA and from PDD-NOS; the same child can receive different diagnoses depending on the screening tool. The debate about distinguishing AS from HFA is partly due to a tautological dilemma where disorders are defined based on severity of impairment, so that studies that appear to confirm differences based on severity are to be expected.|$|E

5|$|The barons {{anticipated}} that the King would act in accordance with these charters, subject to the law and moderated by {{the advice of the}} nobility. Uncertainty continued, and in 1227, when he was declared of age and able to rule independently, Henry announced that future charters had to be issued under his own seal. This brought into question the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous charters issued during his minority, and Henry actively threatened to overturn the Charter of the Forest unless the taxes promised in return for it were actually paid. In 1253, Henry confirmed the charters once again in exchange for taxation.|$|E

Tod also used philological techniques to reconstruct areas of Rajput history that were not even known to the Rajputs themselves, by drawing on works such as the religious texts known as Puranas.|$|E
