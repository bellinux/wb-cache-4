Fifteen patients had a pretreatment {{and at least one}} posttreatment DCE-MRI. We applied a pixel-by-pixel TIC shape analysis, where TICs are classified into five different types according to their shape, and calculated the occurrence of each TIC type in the region of interest (ROI). The results were compared to the pharmacokinetic model (PKM) parameters K(trans), K(ep), V(e), and V(i), and with the semiquantitative parameters maximum enhancement (ME) and initial slope of increase (ISI). The relative amount of type 2 and 4 TIC shape significantly correlated with the parameter K(ep) but not with K(trans) or V(e). The PKM parameter V(e) and the semiquantitative parameters ME and ISI showed significant changes after treatment. None of the TIC shapes individually showed significant changes.

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2012 Tekstil endüstrisindeki üretim işlemlerinde kullanılan suyun belirli bir kalitede olması gerekmektedir. Kullanılan suyun özellikleri tekstil fabrikalarında üretilen malzemenin kalitesini belirlemede önemli bir faktördür. Proses suyunun ihtiyaç duyulan özelliklerde olmaması ürün kalitesine olumsuz etki göstermektedir. Dolaysıyla, ideal bir ürün hazırlamak için proses suyunun kalitesi çok önemlidir. Tekstil atıksularının geri kazanımında membran prosesleri bu ihtiyacı yüksek performanslarıyla karşılayabilmektedir. Yüksek performanstaki membran sisteminin başarılı üretimine ön arıtma uygulaması son derece katkı göstermektedir. Ön arıtmanın seçimi tüm tesisin performansını belirlemektedir. Bu çalışmada, farklı proseslere ait atıksuların arıtılması ve geri kazanılması konusunda farklı membran filtrasyon sistemleri ve membran sistemleri öncesi ön arıtma metotları uygulanarak membran türleri arasında en yüksek arıtma verimini sağlayabilecek membran türlerini ve en uygun ön arıtma metotlarını belirlemeye çalışılmıştır, ve aynı zamanda, ön arıtma alternatifini değerlendirerek giderim verime etkisi araştırılmıştır.

Industrry is {{the biggest}} {{potential}} that creates the environmental pollution. Textile industry is categorized in varied industry branches with high water consuming and high waste water producing. During the industrial production and after different kinds of wastes come into being which causes environmental pollution. Production diversity in textile industry affects the waste water categorization. Textile industry includes different varieties of production proceseses causes waste water characteristics become so different and shows different consantrations in unit waste water amount. The water which is used at the poduction proses in the textile industry must be in a definite quality. The properties of the water used in textile fabrics directly {{affect the quality of}} the produced materials. It shows negative effect directly on the product quality if the water quality is not as it is needed. For this reason the quality of water is very important for preparing the ideal product. The waste water of textile industry is rather more coloured than the other industry branches because of the painting materials. The conventional treatment methods are unable to textile industry wastewater process due to the biologically resistant to decomposition of dyes and dye auxiliary chemical substances for thire complex structure. At the present, As the hold method(such as biological treatment, coagulation, adsorption), can not provide sufficient treatment, new technologies are needed for reusing and recovering of the waste water to reducing the consuming of water soure. For the recovery of textile wastewaters, membrane processes can meet this need with its High performance. Pre-treatment of High-performance membrane system shows highly additiion in a successful application. Selection of pre-treatment determines the performance of the entire plant. In a time serious blockage occurs {{on the surface of the}} membrane becuse of the materials which are not get through the membrane filtration. Because of the blockage reduction will be occurs in the flow and the performanes of membrane will be decrease. To prevent from this, pretreatment has done before the power flux is given to membrane. Pre refinement degree is set by the characteristic of power flux and membrane process structure which is used. Cartridge filtration can be used for to hold the particules which are 5 - 10 &# 956;. The aims of the pre pretreatment are: - To prolonged the work time of the membrane - To prevent the blockage of membrane. - To increase the performance of the system. - To reduce the maintenance and repair cost of the system. In this study, applying pre- treatment methods before the membrane systems and the different membrane filtration systems in the subject of the treatment and recovery of the waste waters that belongs to different processes’, it is tried to be set up the highest filtration productivity that supplies in the membrane sorts and most proper pre-treatment method. At the same time the effect of the removal efficiency is researched by considerating the alternative of the pre-treatment. In this Laboratory-scale study, At first, characterization studies were carried out. The wastewater samples were taken from outputs of process of maximum water consumption and maximum wastewater production of Zorlu Linen Dokuma Emprime Konfeksiyon San. <b>ve</b> <b>Tic.</b> A. Ş. and color, conductivity, and COD analyzes were carried out. And then, Experimental studies to be carried out separately on the wastewater resulting from the washing process of woven finishing and bleaching proses of knit fabric finishing at the plant, In the Studies, different pre-treatment alternatives were determined for using wastewater and then the pre-treatment alternative which providing optimum conditions was selected for the final treatment of wastewater with membrane processes. In the characterization work, COD, conductivity and color parameters were measured for the sample. In the treatability studies for the selection of the membrane the all monitored parameters in the raw water and treated water are: flux, temperature, pH, conductivity, chemical oxygen demand (COD), Total Organic Carbon (TOC) and color. In this experimental study mikrofiltration(MF- 0, 05 µm, MF- 0, 2 µm), ultrafiltration(UF) (UC 010 T), ozonation, UV-TiO 2, modified and unmodified zeolite sistem, ultrasound(UF) (UC 010 T), are used for the pre-treatment. For the last treatment, nanofiltration (NF) (270) and revers osmose(RO) (XLE) membrane systems are used. At the result of pre-treatmen process, all the compares has been done which are supplied from the analysis of the water quality parameters. From the achievable alternatives of the pre-treatmen, the most available pre-treatmen combination is choosed and the filtrate current is subjected to the last treatment process by the helping of membrane process. Experiments are done as pre-treatment and unpre-treatment style. In the pre-treatment tests the raw water directly feed to the membrane filtration for final treatment, In the pre-treatment experiments before the pre-treatment was operated and the obtained filtrate was subjected to membrane filtration for final treatment, and the results are given as a comparison. As a result, the different combinations of each which was tried for applicable pre-treatment alternatives of each shows different consequences. Also each pre-treatment alternative’s that supplies excellence elimination water quality parameter shows difference. For this reason in the choise of the pre-treatment which will realize prufying process must be known very well and in this way proper pre-treatment alternative must be chosen taking care to remove wanted pollutant parameter. To value the experimental studies, membrane types which for the parameter of the flow achieved high flux values, for water quality parameters achieved highest removal efficiencies were selected. The flux values that continuously monitored was before decreased and then was going to be constant. High-flux values obtained with NF 270 nanofiltration membrane, and high removal efficiencies were obtained with reverse osmosis XLE membrane. In the bleaching wastewater treatment, removal efficiencies which are supplied by the NF 270 nanafiltration applications mostly are less than the removal efficiencies which are supplied by the revers osmoz mambrane. The highest curent value is recorded as 42 L/m 2. sa which are realized in the NF 270 nanofiltration experiments and this value is acheieved by pre-treatmen applacation using the 0, 05 µm microfiltration. The lowest current value is supplied by result of NF 270 application after the ultrasound experiment. For the XLE reverse osmos membrane the higeset current value is achieved by the UC 010 T ultrafiltration pre-treatment process, the lowest current value is supplied as a result by the application of UV/TiO 2. At the recovery of bleaching proses effluents, in terms of removal efficiency effective results yielded from zeolite pre-treatment, to obtain a high flux, effective results yielded from UF pre-treatment. For the NF 270 membrane, the MF pre-treatment application also gave positive results, especially to achieving high flux. Bleaching wastewater was passed through NF 270 nanofiltration membrane after pre-treatment and results showes that according to the non-pretreatmen condation COD removal efficiency increased nearly to 42 %, for XLE reverse osmosis membrane, according to the non-pretreatmen condation COD removal efficiency has an increase of 50 %. In the washing proses removal efficiencies which are supplied by the NF 270 nanafiltration applications mostly are less than the removal efficiencies which are supplied by the revers osmoz mambrane. The flux value of nanofiltration is higher than XLE. The highest curent value is recorded as 43 L/m 2. sa which are realized in the NF 270 nanofiltration experiments and this value is acheieved by pre-treatmen applacation using the ultrafiltration. The lowest flux value is supplied by result of NF 270 application after the zeolite experiment. For the XLE reverse osmos membrane the higheset flux value is achieved by the UC 010 T ultrafiltration pre-treatment process, the lowest current value is supplied as a result by the application of 0. 2 µm microfiltration pre-treatment process. At the recovery of washing wastewater, in terms of removal efficiency and to achieve high flux, MF and UF pre-treatment sistems gave effective results. For the NF 270 membrane, the MF pre-treatment application also gave positive results, especially to achieving high flux. In this study which using membrane technologies and a variety of pre-treatment alternatives, color parameter that an important parameter for textile industries wastewater and up to now has not a standard in our country on this parameter was largely removed. In this Project, The all experiment results showes that reusable quality can be reached in textile industry wastewater by using the membrane technology. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E
