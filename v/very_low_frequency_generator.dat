40|$|Background: resting brain {{activity}} appears altered in Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The default mode interference hypothesis (Sonuga-Barke and Castellanos, 2007) postulates that patterns of spontaneous <b>very</b> <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> {{brain activity}}, {{typical of the}} resting brain, cause attention lapses in ADHD when they remain unattenuated following the transition from rest to active task performance. Here we test this hypothesis using DC-EEG. Methods: DC-EEG recordings of <b>very</b> <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> brain activity (< 1. 5 Hz) were compared for 16 male children with ADHD and 16 healthy controls during both rest and active task performance (two choice reaction time task). Results: a previously identified <b>very</b> <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> resting network of electrodes was replicated. At rest ADHD children showed less EEG power in <b>very</b> <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> bands (i. e.,. 02 –. 2 Hz). They also showed less attenuation of power at these frequency bands during rest-to-task transition. Reduced attenuation {{was associated with a}} number of measures of performance. Discussion: we confirmed the existence of altered <b>very</b> <b>low</b> <b>frequency</b> brain activity in ADHD. ADHD children may have deficits both in maintaining a resting brain when needed and ‘protecting’ an active brain from the intrusion of resting state brain activity...|$|R
