In the interaction with systems in their environment, this wealth of information may be of use to the user. In order to create suitable auditory interfaces we require {{a better understanding of}} how people perceive everyday sounds. We have chosen to study the sounds of rolling balls, because a rolling ball can be used as a metaphor for cursor movement resulting from moving a mouse or a trackball. In three experiments the perception of recorded sounds of rolling balls was investigated. In the first experiment subjects were presented with pairs of sounds of rolling balls with different sizes and equal velocity in which they had to decide which of the two sounds was created by the larger ball. In the second experiment the <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> <b>rolling</b> balls was varied and subjects had to choose the faster of two balls equal in size. The results showed that subjects are able to identify the size of rolling balls and that most subjects can clearly discriminate between rolling balls with different velocities. However, some subjects had difficulties in labelling the velocity correctly, probably due to lack of feedback about the correctness of their responses. In the third experiment both size and velocity varied. The results showed a clear interaction between the auditory perception of size and <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> <b>rolling</b> balls...|$|E

LOX- 1 expression is induced by inflammatory cytokines {{as well as by}} proatherogenic stimuli. LOX- 1 protein binds aged/apoptotic cells, activated platelets, and bacteria, suggesting that it may have diverse activities in vivo. Here, we reveal a role for LOX- 1 in endotoxin-induced inflammation. In a model of endotoxemia, injection of a high dose of endotoxin into rats induced leukopenia within 1 h and death of the animals within 24 h. Preadministration of anti-LOX- 1 antibody reduced the degree of leukopenia and completely rescued the animals, whereas control IgG did not. In a model of low-dose endotoxin-induced uveitis, anti-LOX- 1 antibody efficiently suppressed leukocyte infiltration and protein exudation.

40|$|Tese de doutoramento, Ciências Biomédicas (Ciências Funcionais), Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Medicina, 2013 Neutrophils {{are among}} the first leukocytes to migrate from the blood to sites of inflammation. Here, {{they are able to}} {{recognize}} and engulf inflammatory agents, such as infectious agents and activate various anti-microbial strategies to inactivate and destroy them. Importantly, an efficient neutrophil recruitment and function will be pivotal for the success of the inflammatory response in recovering the host’s health. In inflammatory conditions, neutrophil recruitment from the bloodstream through the vascular endothelium into interstitial tissues requires successive interactions of neutrophils with the endothelial cells throughout this multistep process. Among diverse cellular adhesion molecules involved is the β 2 -integrin Mac- 1 (CD 11 b/CD 18), that by binding the endothelial ICAM- 1 is specifically required during firm adhesion and leukocyte crawling. Additionally, this integrin has been shown to bind fibrinogen with a strong affinity as well as to its clotting product fibrin, among other molecular targets. Fibrinogen is a soluble glycoprotein present in the plasma that is importantly required for coagulation and the major determinant of blood viscosity and flow. It has been also proposed as a relevant player in inflammation in view of its ability to modulate the neutrophil function by potentiating degranulation, phagocytosis and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and by providing survival cues that delay apoptosis of activated neutrophils. One possible explanation for these effects could be that by binding Mac- 1 in a low-avidity state, fibrinogen could function as a primer for resting neutrophils and thus decrease the threshold for cell activation. Taken all this, our goal in the present work was to address whether circulating fibrinogen could also modulate neutrophil recruitment and thus understand its role in the mechanism of microvascular inflammatory response. In this respect, we hypothesized that upon binding Mac- 1, plasma fibrinogen could potentiate neutrophil-endothelial cell interaction by priming the neutrophil to a more adhesive phenotype. To test this, we first investigated whether soluble fibrinogen could modulate neutrophil activation, more precisely concerning the production of oxygen free radicals (OFR). By combining flow cytometry with dihydrorhodamine 123, we showed that by itself, soluble fibrinogen could induce OFR production by neutrophils isolated from human peripheral blood, arguing it could modulate neutrophil activation. Furthermore, we demonstrated this effect not to be Mac- 1 dependent as: (i) fibrinogen did not interfere with the neutrophil Mac- 1 activation and (2) an anti-total Mac- 1 antibody known to block this integrin function did not impair the induced OFR production. Finally, binding of fibrinogen to the neutrophil’s membrane was observed independently of its co-localization with Mac- 1 staining, arguing for the fibrinogen interaction with another unidentified neutrophil membrane receptor. Next, we addressed in vitro whether fibrinogen could modulate the adhesive behaviour of circulating neutrophils. For such, we used flow chamber assays that allowed the visualization and study of cell adhesion processes under well-defined wall shear stress. Human neutrophils were flown over monolayers of HUVECs at a constant wall shear stress of 0, 1 dynes/cm 2 in {{the presence or absence of}} soluble fibrinogen. Neutrophil’s adhesive behaviour was evaluated by determining the numbers of rolling and adherent neutrophils and the <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> <b>rolling.</b> Under a physiological concentration (300 mg/dL) of fibrinogen, the number of rolling neutrophils was not significantly affected in comparison to that measured in its absence. Surprisingly, the rolling velocities measured for the first were significantly higher than those exhibited by the latter. Additionally, the number of adherent fibrinogen-treated neutrophils was smaller than that determined for non-treated ones. This showed that at physiological concentrations, soluble fibrinogen could modulate the adhesive behaviour of circulating neutrophils towards activated endothelium. This effect may be important in a non-inflammatory condition by preventing excessive adhesion of neutrophils to the vascular wall and enabling adherent cells to easily detach from it. It may constitute an important mechanism to prevent unwanted accumulation of neutrophils in the vasculature and to avoid thrombus formation and growth. These results led us to propose that fibrinogen could further influence leukocyte recruitment in vivo and particularly, impact on the normal progression of acute inflammation. To explore this, the effect of soluble fibrinogen on leukocyte recruitment in acute inflammation was next evaluated in vivo by intravital microscopy of post-capillary venules of mouse mesentery. This approach allowed us to address specifically its contribution for leukocyte rolling and adhesion by determining the number of rolling leukocytes, their rolling velocities and the number of adherent leukocytes. To enable the in vivo study of leukocyte recruitment in the absence of soluble fibrinogen in the bloodstream, we made use of a mouse model bearing a disrupted fibrinogen α chain gene for which, homozygous individuals had been shown not to express any experimentally detected plasmatic soluble fibrinogen. As control groups, wild-type and heterozygous mice, known to possess normal coagulation patterns, were used. Acute inflammation was mimicked by superfusing the mesentery with PAF, a well-known neutrophil activator. Under these conditions, a slightly reduced number of rolling leukocytes was observed in homozygous (α-/-) mice when compared to both control groups. Despite this, rolling leukocytes migrated with increased velocities in homozygous (α-/-) mice when compared to those from control animals. Consistently, homozygous mice further displayed a diminished number of adherent leukocytes than the other groups. Overall, these observations led us to conclude that leukocyte recruitment is compromised in the absence of soluble fibrinogen in the blood circulation. Altogether our studies led us to conclude that soluble fibrinogen can modulate neutrophil activation and importantly, that it should constitute an important factor for leukocyte recruitment in acute inflammation. As soluble fibrinogen is able to bind either to the neutrophil or to the endothelial cell, one could envisage that it could also be able to bridge these two cellular identities and possibly favour a more stable and effective leukocyte recruitment. These results have profound implications in inflammation. As central players in the process, leukocytes need rapidly to cross the vascular wall and reach the inflamed areas. If this is affected due to absent or reduced levels of plasmatic soluble fibrinogen, ineffective immune responses will be elicited to invading pathogens. This will compromise the organism’s health by enhancing the risk of sepsis development among other possible pathological consequences. Os neutrófilos estão entre os primeiros leucócitos a migrar da corrente sanguínea para o local da inflamação. Um vez no local, estes possuem a capacidade de reconhecer e englobar os agentes causadores de infecções desenvolvendo estratégias anti-microbianas de forma a conseguir desativar e destruir esses mesmos agentes. Assim sendo, é importante salientar que um recrutamento de neutrófilos funcional e eficiente é fundamental para o sucesso da resposta inflamatória e para recuperação da saúde do hospedeiro. Em situações inflamatórias, o recrutamento dos neutrófilos é feito a partir do sangue e através do endotélio vascular para os tecidos intersticiais, este recrutamento consiste num processo com várias etapas que requer interações sucessivas do neutrófilos com as células endoteliais. Entre as várias moléculas de adesão celular envolvidas neste processo, é a integrina-β 2, Mac- 1 (CD 11 b/CD 18), que permite que neutrófilos se liguem á ICAM- 1 endotelial, passo essencial para a adesão firme dos leucócitos e o seu consequente alongamento. Além disso, foi também demonstrado que o fibrinogénio, assim como a fibrina, são ligandos de alta afinidade para esta mesma integrina, para além de outros alvos moleculares. O fibrinogénio é uma glicoproteina solúvel que está presente no plasma, sendo um dos elementos determinantes para o fluxo e viscosidade sanguínea, desempenhando ainda uma função fundamental na coagulação. Para além desta funções sobejamente conhecidas foi proposto por vários autores que fibrinogénio tem também uma função relevante no processo inflamatório tendo em conta a sua capacidade em modular a função do neutrófilo potenciando a sua desgranulação, fagocitose e atrasando a apoptose dos neutrófilos ativados. Uma das possíveis explicações para estes efeitos está diretamente relacionada com a ligação do fibrinogénio á Mac- 1 quando esta se encontra em baixa afinidade, o fibrinogénio pode não só pre-ativar os neutrófilos mas também facilitar a sua ativação. Tendo tudo isto em consideração, o objetivo deste trabalho consiste investigar se o fibrinogénio solúvel que se encontra em circulação pode ou não modular o recrutamento dos neutrófilos e desta forma modular a resposta inflamatória microvascular. Na primeira abordagem a esta pergunta começou-se por investigar se o fibrinogénio solúvel ao ligar-se á Mac- 1, poderia facilitar a interação entre as células endoteliais e os neutrófilos facilitando a sua adesão. Começou-se por tentar perceber se o fibrinogénio solúvel pode modular a ativação dos neutrófilos, tendo como medida de ativação a produção de radicais livres de oxigénio (OFR). Recorrendo á citometria de fluxo e á incubação dos neutrófilos com diidrorodamina 123, conseguiu-se provar que o fibrinogénio só por si induz a produção de OFR pelos neutrófilos isolados a partir de sangue periférico humano, ativando-os. Para além disso, demonstrou-se ainda que este efeito não é dependente da ligação do fibrinogénio á Mac- 1, uma vez que, mesmo quando foi utilizado um anticorpo bloqueador da Mac- 1 a produção de OFR não foi afectada. Para além disso, foi também verificado por microscopia confocal que não existe uma colocalização entre a marcação por Mac- 1 e pelo fibrinogénio, o que sugere um receptor ainda não identificado para o fibrinogénio, na membrana do neutrófilo. Seguidamente, utilizando uma abordagem in vitro, investigou-se se o fibrinogénio conseguia modular o efeito adesivo dos neutrófilos em circulação. Para tal recorreu-se ao uso de uma camara de fluxo laminar que permitiu a visualização do processo de adesão com “shear-stress constante. Os neutrófilos isolados a partir de sangue periférico humano foram colocados sobre uma monocamada de HUVECs com um fluxo constante de 0, 1 dynes/cm 2 na presença e na ausência de fibrinogénio solúvel. O comportamento adesivo dos neutrófilos foi avaliado contando o numero de neutrófilos em rolamento e aderidos e determinando a sua velocidade de rolamento. A uma concentração fisiológica (300 mg/dL) de fibrinogénio, o numero de neutrófilos em rolamento não foi afectado significativamente quando comparado com o numero encontrado na ausência de fibrinogénio. Mas surpreendentemente as velocidades de rolamento foram significativamente superiores na presença do fibrinogénio. Determinou-se ainda que o numero de neutrófilos aderidos na presença de fibrinogénio foi mais pequeno do que na sua ausência. O que conduziu á conclusão que o solúvel fibrinogénio em concentrações fisiológicas podem influenciar a adesão dos neutrófilos circulantes à parede endotelial ativada. Este efeito assume especial importância em situações não-inflamatórias, prevenindo a adesão excessiva de neutrófilos á parede vascular e também facilitando que células aderentes facilmente se libertem. Pode assim constituir um mecanismo importante para prevenir a acumulação não desejada de neutrófilos na vasculatura e impedir a formação e crescimento de trombos vasculares. Estes resultados conduziram a que se propusesse que o fibrinogénio pode influenciar o recrutamento dos leucócitos in vivo, e particularmente, ter um importante impacto na normal progressão de uma inflamação aguda. De forma a explorar esta hipótese, o efeito do fibrinogénio solúvel no recrutamento dos leucócitos durante uma inflamação aguda, foi utilizada uma abordagem in vivo, recorrendo á microscopia intravital das vénulas pós-capilares do mesentério do murganho. Esta abordagem permitiu visualizar diretamente e contar o numero de leucócitos aderidos e em rolamento assim como determinar as sua velocidades de rolamento. O modelo animal utilizado nesta abordagem foi um murganho geneticamente alterado, sem a cadeia α do fibrinogénio o que faz com que os indivíduos homozigoticos não possuam fibrinogénio em circulação. Como grupo controlo foram utilizados murganhos “wild-type” e heterozigoticos que possuem um padrão de coagulação normal. De forma a recriar uma situação de inflamação aguda, perfundiu-se o mesentério com PAF, um ativador de neutrófilos bem descrito na literatura. Nesta condições, foi encontrado um numero ligeiramente reduzido de leucócitos em rolamento nos murganhos homozigoticos(α-/-) quando comparado com o numero encontrado tanto nos murganhos heterozigoticos como nos “wild-type”. No entanto, a velocidade de rolamento é superior nos murganhos homozigoticos(α-/-) quando comparada com os mesmos grupos controlo. Consistentemente com este resultado, também o numero de leucócitos aderentes foi inferior neste grupo quando comparado com o mesmo grupo controlo. Estes resultados permitiram concluir que o recrutamento leucocitário ficou comprometido na ausência do fibrinogénio solúvel em circulação. De uma forma global, este trabalho permitiu concluir que o fibrinogénio solúvel pode modular a ativação dos neutrófilos e ainda constituir um factor importante para o recrutamento leucocitário durante uma situação de inflamação aguda. O fibrinogénio solúvel tem a capacidade de se ligar não só ao neutrófilo mas também ás células endoteliais, podendo assim servir de ponte de ligação entre estas duas identidades celulares e desta forma favorecer um recrutamento leucocitário mais eficaz e mais estável. Estes resultados tem implicações importantes no processo inflamatório. Sendo os neutrófilos células determinantes neste processo, precisam de conseguir atravessar rapidamente a parede vascular e chegar ao local onde ocorre a inflamação. Se este processo se encontra comprometido devido a uma concentração reduzida ou mesmo á ausência de fibrinogénio solúvel em circulação, a resposta imunitária fica comprometida e suscetível á invasão por agentes patogénicos.

The model, which {{is suitable for}} real-time implementation, is based on qualitative and quantitative observations obtained from a physics-based model described in the literature. In {{the first part of}} the paper, the physics-based model is presented, followed by a perceptual experiment, whose aim is to identify the perceptually relevant information characterizing the rolling interaction. On the basis of this experiment, we hypothesize that the particular pattern of the interaction force is responsible for the perception <b>of</b> a <b>rolling</b> object. A complete analysis-synthesis scheme of this interaction force is then provided, along with a description of the calibration of the proposed source-filter sound synthesis process. Finally, a mapping strategy for intuitive control of the proposed synthesis process (i. e. size and <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rolling</b> object and roughness of the surface) is proposed and validated by a listening test...|$|R
40|$|The role of haem oxygenase (HO) in the hepatic {{accumulation}} of leukocytes in mice during {{the initiation of}} remote organ injury following normotensive limb ischaemia-reperfusion (I-R) was investigated. Remote organ injury was initiated by 1 h bilateral hindlimb ischaemia followed by either 1 or 1. 5 h reperfusion (I-R) in male C 57 BL/ 6 mice. Mice {{were randomly assigned to}} either sham (no I-R, n = 4), I-R (n = 4 for both time points), I-R plus chromium mesoporphyrin (CrMP, n = 4) to inhibit HO or I-R plus haemin (n = 4) to increase HO. Leukocyte accumulation and leukocyte-endothelial interaction were directly measured using fluorescence intravital microscopy. Leukocytes were labelled via an injection of rhodamine 6 G. In sinusoids the total number and the number of stationary leukocytes were assessed. In postsinusoidal venules the number <b>of</b> adherent and <b>rolling</b> leukocytes and the <b>velocities</b> <b>of</b> both red blood cells and leukocytes were measured. The total number of leukocytes increased in sinusoids of I-R mice reaching a plateau within 1 h compared with sham animals, while the number of stationary leukocytes progressively increased over the entire study period. Stationary leukocytes in sinusoids increased after 1 and 1. 5 h of I-R following CrMP, while they were significantly reduced following haemin treatment compared to animals treated with I-R only. In postsinusoidal venules a progressive increase in adherent leukocytes also occurred. As observed in sinusoids, CrMP significantly increased, while haemin significantly reduced leukocyte adhesion. The number <b>of</b> <b>rolling</b> leukocytes increased after CrMP in both I-R groups (1 and 1. 5 h). The <b>velocities</b> <b>of</b> <b>rolling</b> leukocytes declined following 1. 5 h of I-R compared with sham. Haemin treatment of 1. 5 h I-R animals restored the velocities back to sham levels. The calculated wall shear rates in postsinusoidal venules were significantly lower in all I-R groups in comparison to sham animals. Combination of 1. 5 h I-R with CrMP resulted in the lowest shear rates of all I-R groups. The number of stationary leukocytes within sinusoids and adherent leukocytes in postsinusoidal venules were correlated to the corresponding alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. In conclusion, endogenous HO reduces leukocyte-endothelial interactions within the liver. Thus, endogenous HO activity provides an important mechanism controlling the hepatic inflammatory response during the initiation of remote organ injury following normotensive limb ischaemia-reperfusion...|$|R

40|$|Spontaneous {{stratification}} in granular mixtures—i. e., {{the formation}} of alternating layers of small-rounded and large-faceted grains when one pours a random mixture of {{the two types of}} grains into a quasi-two-dimensional vertical Hele-Shaw cell—has been recently reported by H. A. Makse et al. [Nature 386, 379 (1997) ]. Here we study experimentally the dynamical processes leading to spontaneous stratification. We divide the process in three stages: (a) avalanche of grains and segregation in the rolling phase, (b) formation of the “kink”—an uphill wave at which grains are stopped—at the bottom substrate, and (c) uphill motion of the kink and formation of a pair of layers. Using a high-speed video camera, we study a rapid flow regime where the rolling grains size segregate during the avalanche {{due to the fact that}} small grains move downward in the rolling phase to form a sublayer <b>of</b> small <b>rolling</b> grains underneath a sublayer <b>of</b> large <b>rolling</b> grains. This dynamical segregation process—known as “kinematic sieving,” “free surface segregation,” or simple “percolation”— contributes to the spontaneous stratification of grains in the case of thick flows. We characterize the dynamical process of stratification by measuring all relevant quantities: the <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rolling</b> grains, the <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> the kink, and the wavelength of the layers. We also measure other phenomenological constants such as the rate <b>of</b> collision between <b>rolling</b> and static grains, and all the angles of repose characterizing the mixture. The wavelength of the layers behaves linearly with the thickness of the layer <b>of</b> <b>rolling</b> grains (i. e., with the flow rate), in agreement with theoretical predictions. The <b>velocity</b> profile <b>of</b> the grains in the rolling phase is a linear function of the position of the grains along the moving layer, which implies a linear relation between the mean velocity and the thickness <b>of</b> the <b>rolling</b> phase. We also find that the speed of the upward-moving kink has the same value as the mean speed of the downward-moving grains. We measure the shape and size of the kink, as well as the profiles <b>of</b> the <b>rolling</b> and static phases of grains, and find agreement with recent theoretical predictions...|$|R

Mice lacking this membrane receptor exhibit a severe impairment <b>of</b> leukocyte <b>rolling.</b> We observed that, {{in addition to}} leukocytes, platelets were rolling in mesenteric venules of wild-type mice. To investigate the role of P-selectin in this process, resting or activated platelets from wild-type or P-selectin-deficient mice were fluorescently labeled and transfused into recipients of either genotype. Platelet-endothelial interactions were monitored by intravital microscopy. We observed <b>rolling</b> <b>of</b> either wild-type or P-selectin-deficient resting platelets on wild-type endothelium. Endothelial stimulation with the calcium ionophore A 23187 increased the number <b>of</b> platelets <b>rolling</b> 4 -fold. Activated P-selectin-deficient platelets behaved similarly, whereas activated wild-type platelets bound to leukocytes and were seen <b>rolling</b> together. Platelets <b>of</b> either genotype, resting or activated, interacted minimally with mutant endothelium even after A 23187 treatment. The <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> platelet <b>rolling</b> was 6 - to 9 -fold {{greater than that of}} leukocytes. Our results demonstrate that (i) platelets roll on endothelium in vivo, (ii) this interaction requires endothelial but not platelet P-selectin, and (iii) platelet rolling appears to be independent of platelet activation, indicating constitutive expression of a P-selectin ligand(s) on platelets. We have therefore observed an interesting parallel between platelets and leukocytes in that both of these blood cell types roll on stimulated vessel wall and that this process is dependent on the expression of endothelial P-selectin...|$|R
40|$|Adhesion receptors {{that are}} known to {{initiate}} contact (tethering) between blood-borne leukocytes and their endothelial counterreceptors are frequently concentrated on the microvilli of leukocytes. Other adhesion molecules are displayed either randomly or preferentially on the planar cell body. To determine whether ultrastructural distribution plays a role during tethering in vivo, we used pre-B cell transfectants expressing L- or E-selectin ectodomains linked to transmembrane/intracellular domains that mediated different surface distribution patterns. We analyzed the frequency and <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> transfectant <b>rolling</b> in high endothelial venules of peripheral lymph nodes using an intravital microscopy model. Ectodomains on microvilli conferred a higher efficiency at initiating rolling than random distribution which, in turn, was more efficient than preferential expression on the cell body. The role of microvillous presentation was less accentuated in venules below 20 �m in diameter than in larger venules. In the narrow venules, tethering of cells with cell body expression may have been aided by forced margination through collision with erythrocytes. L-selectin transfected cells rolled 10 -fold faster than E-selectin transfectants. Interestingly, <b>rolling</b> <b>velocity</b> histograms <b>of</b> cell lines expressing equivalent copy numbers of the same ectodomain were always similar, irrespective o...|$|R
40|$|Rolling Isolation Systems {{provide a}} simple and {{effective}} means for protecting components from horizontal floor vibrations. In these systems a platform rolls on four steel balls which, in turn, rest within shallow bowls. The trajectories of the balls is uniquely determined by the horizontal and rotational <b>velocity</b> components <b>of</b> the <b>rolling</b> platform, and thus provides nonholonomic constraints. In general, the bowls are not parabolic, so the potential energy function of this system is not quadratic.

The equations of motion are {{described in terms of}} a redundant set of constrained coordinates. Coordinate accelerations are uniquely determined at any point in time via Gauss's Principle by solving a linearly constrained quadratic minimization. In the absence of any modeled damping, the equations of motion conserve energy.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Current {{paradigm}} {{attributes the}} low incidence of cardiovascular disorders in Mediterranean countries despite a high saturated fat intake, the "French paradox," to the antioxidant capacity {{of red wine}} polyphenols. Conceivably, other antiinflammatory pathways may contribute to at least a similar extent to the atheroprotective activity of these polyphenols. We have investigated whether gallic acid (GA), an abundant red wine polyphenol, modulates the activity of P-selectin, an adhesion molecule that is critically involved in the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the vessel wall and thus in atherosclerosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: GA potently inhibited the binding of a peptide antagonist (IC 50, 7. 2 micromol/L) and biotin-PAA-Le(a) -SO 3 H, an established high-affinity ligand, to P-selectin (IC 50, 85 micromol/L). Under dynamic flow conditions, GA markedly and dose dependently attenuated the <b>rolling</b> <b>of</b> monocytic HL 60 cells over P-selectin-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells (EC 50, 14. 5 micromol/L) while increasing the <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> P-selectin-dependent <b>rolling</b> <b>of</b> human blood leukocytes over a platelet monolayer. In vivo tests established that GA administration to normolipidemic C 57 /Bl 6 and aged atherosclerotic apolipoprotein E-deficient mice impaired the baseline <b>rolling</b> <b>of</b> conjugates between activated platelets and circulating monocytes over femoral vein endothelium, as judged by online video microscopy (ED 50, 1. 7 +/- 0. 3 and 1. 5 +/- 0. 4 mg x kg(- 1) x h(- 1), respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide a solid mechanistic foundation through which GA intervenes in major inflammatory pathobiologies by binding and antagonizing P-selectin. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Tires {{are made}} of {{viscoelastic}} materials with stiffness quite dependent on the frequency. Generally, two causes of the stiffness increase are distinguished : a frequency dependence complex modulus and a geometrical stiffness. In this paper, an experimental and theoretical study on the relaxation and frequency dependence of complex moduli of the tire constitutive materials are presented and validated. Expressions of the viscoelastic behavior are presented in time and frequency domains. The {{results show that the}} real part of the Young's modulus is monotonic according to the frequency. It contributes to {{an important part of the}} stiffening. A numerical approach simulating the experimental results of the contact area of Cesbron is also presented. The tire is modeled with a real material distribution in the tire section. The geometrical stiffness also increases with the rotational velocity and it varies with the vibration frequencies. Static and dynamic computations for different rolling velocities are done. The results show that the contact area depends on the <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rolling</b> tire. Comparisons between the measurements and the computations show a good agrement and a decrease of about 20 % in the contact areas when the tire rolls compared to a static tire.

A total of 15 aggregate sources from five different regions in China were selected and tested using a specially-designed device stationed at the State Key Laboratory of Tribology in Tsinghua University. A total of 4 groups of experimental tests were performed to measure the aggregate frictional coefficients under different testing conditions. In the first group, a total of 25 tests were performed to study the impact of loading levels and rotational <b>velocities</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rolling</b> shaft on the measured frictional coefficients. The second and third groups of tests were conducted to study the dry and wet friction at the surfaces between the aggregate specimens and the outer ring <b>of</b> the <b>rolling</b> shaft with the milled sands pretreated. The fourth group of tests was performed to measure the dry friction at the surfaces between the aggregate specimens and the outer ring with the car tire rubber pretreated. From the experimental test results for most aggregate sources, it was observed that: 1) in the second and third groups of tests, both wet and dry frictional coefficients sharply increased at the beginning, then after their peak values the dry frictional coefficients kept constant while the wet frictional coefficients decreased smoothly over the testing time; 2) the wet frictional coefficients were lower than the dry frictional coefficients; 3) the dry frictional coefficients at the surfaces between aggregates and the milled sands were smaller than those at the surfaces between aggregates and the car tire rubber. However, the second and third observations above were not true for severa...|$|R
40|$|Unstable {{movement}} in roller bearings like cage or roller slip {{can lead to}} damages or eventually even to an early break of the bearing. To prevent slip, inadequate operating states should be avoided. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} study the dynamic behavior of the bearing. Unfortunately, there is only a limited range of measurement methods for the dynamic of bearing components. Two possible approaches are using solely a high-speed camera or the combination of an optomechanical image derotator and a high-speed camera. This work focuses on a proposal which is suitable for both. Initially, the influence <b>of</b> the rotational <b>velocity</b> in the images is eliminated. In the next step the measurement data is reduced to a region of interest which displays a particular rolling-element. A rolling element is equipped with a linear marker which, in the next stage, is segmented by a thresholding method to multiple regions. The region representing the marker is extracted from the background and the position is calculated by a Principle Component Analysis. Depending on the shift of the angular position and the lag time between two images, the rotational <b>velocity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rolling</b> element is calculated. Thus, it is possible to determine whether the rolling element is operating under ideal conditions. In conclusion, {{it can be said that}} this approach enables a simple and flexible non-invasive method to depict the occurrence of roller slip in roller bearings. © 2017 SPIE...|$|R

50|$|Leukocytes, as well {{as other}} types of white blood cells, {{normally}} form weak and short-lived bonds with other cells via selectin. Coated outside the membrane of leukocytes are microvilli, which have various types of adhesive molecules, including P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), a glycoprotein that is normally decorated with sulfated sialyl-Lewis x. the sulfated-sialyl-Lewis-x-contained PSGL-1 molecule has the ability to bind to any type of selectin. Leukocytes also exhibit L-selectin that binds to other cells or other leukocytes that contain PSGL-1 molecules.An important example of catch bonds is their role in leukocyte extravasation. During this process, leukocytes move through the circulatory system to sites of infection, and in doing so they 'roll' and bind to selectin molecules on the vessel wall. While able to float freely in the blood under normal circumstances, shear stress induced by inflammation causes leukocytes to attach to the endothelial vessel wall and begin rolling rather than floating downstream. This “shear-threshold phenomenon” was initially characterized in 1996 by Finger et al. who showed that leukocyte binding and rolling through L-selectin is only maintained when a critical shear-threshold is applied to the system. Multiple sources of evidence have shown that catch bonds are responsible for the tether and roll mechanism that allows this critical process to occur. Catch bonds allow increasing force to convert short-lived tethers into stronger, longer-lived binding interactions, thus decreasing the rolling velocity and increasing the regularity <b>of</b> <b>rolling</b> steps. However, this mechanism only works at an optimal force. As shear force increases past this force, bonds revert to slip bonds, creating an increase in <b>velocity</b> and irregularity <b>of</b> <b>rolling.</b>|$|R
