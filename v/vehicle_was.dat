5|$|A {{reusable}} Two-Stage-To-Orbit (TSTO) launch <b>vehicle</b> <b>was</b> {{planned to}} be implemented about 15 years after the addition of LFBBs to Ariane 5. However, only a preliminary analysis of TSTO was completed. The proposed configuration consisted of two boosters with retractable wings attached to the external fuel tank, and a reusable orbiter with fixed wings carrying payload on top of it. During geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) missions, an additional, expandable upper stage would be used.|$|E

She then attempted {{to walk away from}} the scene, but was prevented from doing so by a male police officer, whom she then slapped. She was handcuffed and charged with careless driving, refusing a breathalyser test, and two counts of assault on a police officer. She was released on HK$5,000 bail.|$|E
5|$|Both {{tracks and}} wheels {{were used for}} {{steering}}. The steering system was set up so that shallow turns used only the wheels, but brakes would {{be applied to the}} tracks the farther the steering wheel was turned. The drive sprocket had rollers rather than the more common teeth. The rear suspension consisted of six double roadwheels, overlapping and interleaved in the usual Schachtellaufwerk system used for German half-track vehicles, mounted on swing arms sprung by torsion bars. An idler wheel, mounted {{at the rear of the}} <b>vehicle,</b> <b>was</b> used to control track tension. The front wheels had leaf springs and shock absorbers.|$|E

40|$|For an {{autonomous}} vehicle, detecting and tracking other <b>vehicles</b> <b>is</b> a critical task.

If a detected <b>vehicle</b> <b>is</b> moving, the orientation can be inferred from its trajectory, but if the <b>vehicle</b> <b>is</b> stationary, the orientation must be determined directly. In this paper, we focus on vision-based algorithms for determining vehicle orientation of vehicles in images. We train a set of Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) classifiers to recognize different orientations of vehicles detected in imagery. We find that these orientation-specific classifiers perform well, achieving a 88...|$|R

5|$|Hitler envisioned {{widespread}} car ownership {{as part of}} the new Germany and {{he arranged}} for designer Ferdinand Porsche to draw up plans for the KdF-wagen (Strength Through Joy car), intended to be an automobile that every German citizen could afford. A prototype was displayed at the International Motor Show in Berlin on 17 February 1939. With the outbreak of World War II, the factory was converted to produce military vehicles. No production models were sold until after the war, when the <b>vehicle</b> <b>was</b> renamed the Volkswagen (people's car).|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Dull began {{a search}} for a new {{official}} symbol to represent the Institute. He specifically wanted a classic pre-war Ford. Dull's search would entail newspaper ads, radio commercials, and other means to locate this vehicle. The search took him throughout the state and country, but no suitable <b>vehicle</b> <b>was</b> found until the autumn of 1960. Dean Dull spotted a polished 1930 Ford Model A outside of his apartment located in Towers Dormitory. The owner was Captain Ted J. Johnson, Atlanta's chief Delta Air Lines pilot.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, while filming Somewhere in Time, a car {{was brought}} {{on the island}} for Christopher Reeve's {{character}} to drive.
