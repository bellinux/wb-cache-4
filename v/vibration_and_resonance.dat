A common failure mode for turbine machines is high cycle of fatigue of compressor and turbine blades due to high dynamic stresses caused by blade <b>vibration</b> <b>and</b> <b>resonance</b> within the operation range of the machinery.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{recent advances}} {{in the design and}} characterization of hybrid transducers incorporating magnetostrictive and electrostrictive elements. In order to analyze and validate the properties inherent to hybrid concepts, a transducer was designed and constructed through a mechanical series arrangement of a PMN-PT stack and a Terfenol-D rod. This configuration provides a double resonant frequency response that can be tuned for a variety of applications. The primary objective of this study lies in the determination of the design criteria for achieving maximum transducer bandwidth on the 1 - 6 kHz range. To this end, a linear system model was developed utilizing concepts from vibrations, electroacoustic theory, and linearized constitutive relationships for each class of smart material for low to moderate drive levels. This model provides a means of completely describing the system response and the interactions between electrical and mechanical domains for this hybrid transducer. Experimental data collected from the test device indicate that the measured modes of <b>vibration</b> <b>and</b> <b>resonance</b> peaks agree with the theoretical results, and that the desired bandwidth has been achieved. 1...|$|E
40|$|One major task of an {{aircraft}} landing gear is the absorption of vertical energy which will mostly result either from the landing impact of from overrunning bumps and other ground irregularities. The necessity to limit the applied landing gear loads at the high stroke velocities at touch-down leads to damping characteristics which provide only lillte damping action at less vehement movements. Aircraft with high fuselage flexibility are therefore prone to <b>vibration</b> <b>and</b> <b>resonance</b> phenomena. The vonventional approach of developing the landing gear separetely from the airframe with only simple models to represent the aircraft ground dynamic properties seems no longer appropriate.

40|$|The human {{upper airways}} embrace {{the source of}} {{phonation}} and affect the modulation of the voice, which is of vital importance for communication. Moreover, unwanted sounds may be generated in the upper airways due to elastic, collapsible parts that are susceptible to flow-induced <b>vibration</b> <b>and</b> <b>resonance.</b> The sound resulting from fluid-structure interaction in the upper respiratory tract, commonly known as snoring, {{can be an important}} indicator for underlying breathing disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The scope of this work is the assessment of acoustic sources and the conditions for sound being produced in the upper airways in healthy and diseased state. For the study of the vocal tract under phonation, both low- and high-order numerical methods are applied and the obtained results are compared to experimental data from collaborators. The geometries of the vocal tract are based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data for the different vowel pronunciations under voiced speech of a healthy male subject. Unsteady, direct compressible flow simulations using a finite volume solver are carried out for the computation of the pressure fluctuations and the associated distribution of frequency peaks {{as a result of the}} modulation through the static vocal tract. The peaks of the envelope of the far-field Fourier spectrum, which are characterising the spoken tone, are extracted and compared to the Helmholtz eigenfrequencies of the airway volume. The effect of variations of vocal fold closure, fundamental frequency, and vocal tract length on the computed acoustic signal is investigated. Thus, an estimation of the impact of vocal disorders on the ability of vowel production is attempted. A particular advantage of the presented approach is the attainment of time-resolved pressure and velocity fields of the flow, which allows for analysis of the coherent structures at the level of the vocal fold constriction, responsible for sound output during unvoiced speech. Furthermore, fluid-structure interaction simulations are performed for the study of the influence of critical parameters, such as Reynolds number of the flow or elasticity of the structure, on the onset of oscillations for a simplified model. The acoustic sources involved in the generation of the dominant frequencies of tissue vibrations are identified by application of an acoustic analogy. The obtained results of this work contribute to the development of a computational tool that assists physicians in the assessment of the airway function and the effectiveness of treatment plans prior to their application.

40|$|We {{first show}} a {{possible}} mechanism {{to create a}} new type of nuclear fusion, thermal resonance fusion, i. e. low energy nuclear fusion with thermal resonance of light nuclei or atoms, such as deuterium or tritium. The fusion of two light nuclei has to overcome the Coulomb barrier between these two nuclei to reach up to the interacting region of nuclear force. We found nuclear fusion could be realized with thermal vibrations of crystal lattice atoms coupling with light atoms at low energy by resonance to overcome this Coulomb barrier. Thermal resonances combining with tunnel effects can greatly enhance the probability of the deuterium fusion to the detectable level. Our low energy nuclear fusion mechanism research - thermal resonance fusion mechanism results demonstrate how these light nuclei or atoms, such as deuterium, can be fused in the crystal of metal, such as Ni or alloy, with synthetic thermal <b>vibrations</b> <b>and</b> <b>resonances</b> at different modes and energies experimentally. The probability of tunnel effect at different resonance energy given by the WKB method is shown that indicates the thermal resonance fusion mode, especially combined with the tunnel effect, is possible and feasible. But the penetrating probability decreases very sharply when the input resonance energy decreases less than 3 keV, so for thermal resonance fusion, the key point is to increase the resonance peak or make the resonance sharp enough to the acceptable energy level by the suitable compound catalysts, and it is better to reach up more than 3 keV to make the penetrating probability larger than 10 ^{- 10 }.
