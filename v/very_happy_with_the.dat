5|$|Parker and Stone were <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> episode, but {{received}} {{feedback from}} fans {{that it was}} one of the weaker episodes of the first season, and that the constant jokes about Barbra Streisand started to grow redundant. Many fans also did not like Kenny's tether ball accident death scene because it had nothing to do with the plot of the episode, which Parker and Stone said was supposed to be the joke.|$|E
25|$|Many {{local people}} were not <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> outcome. Those {{entitled}} to common rights, mainly from the Isle of Axholme, claimed they had been allotted the worst land. There were complaints of flooding from those further down the Don in the villages of Fishlake, Sykehouse and Snaith. Recrimination against foreign settlers was encouraged by those who had lost their fishing and other livelihood.|$|E
25|$|I {{just had}} to lay it down, more or less: first track... second track – you know, really fast working on that. And all the guitar overdubs on Presence were done in one night. But I didn't think I {{would be able to}} do it in one night, I thought I'd have to do it across maybe three {{different}} nights to get the individual sections. Everything sort of crystallised and you'll notice everything was just pouring out. I was <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> guitar playing on that whole album, you know as far as the maturity of playing goes.|$|E

50|$|Even {{though they}} never {{expected}} the song ‘Fairytale' {{to be so}} big, when the song was sealed, they were <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> it. <b>The</b> song, according to the duo, {{was inspired by a}} split experienced by one of them. The song has captured many music lovers' attention across the country and hasn't lost the momentum since it was released.|$|R

25|$|After the cease-fire, the 3d BW {{returned}} to peacetime duty remaining at Kunsan AB, South Korea until October 1954, when it {{moved back to}} Johnson AB, Japan. Beginning in January 1956, the 3d Bombardment Group converted from the aging World War II era B-26 to the jet-powered Martin B-57B Canberra Night Intruder. However, the USAF was not <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> B-57B as it was initially produced. It was deemed to be inadequate to meet the night intruder and close support role for which it had originally been designed. The service life of the B-57B with USAF tactical bomb groups was planned to be brief. After three years of service with the B-57s in tactical bomb groups, {{the decision was made}} to phase out the B-57.|$|E
25|$|However, on 26 February 2009, the BBC Trust, the BBC's own Editorial Watchdog, {{upheld a}} {{complaint}} from {{a member of}} the public and released a report criticising the Newsnight programme for significant failings in the conduct of this interview, stating that the interview had not upheld the BBC's guidelines on fairness and impartiality, that Senator Walker had been misquoted, that Walker's earlier comments had been edited in a way as to misrepresent what Senator Walker had said and so as to mislead the audience and that the correction had not gone far enough in remedying the unfair implications that the quotes had suggested. Frank Walker stated that he was <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> outcome, and that he felt vindicated for what he felt was the low-point of his political career.|$|E
25|$|Kricfalusi left Bakshi's {{studio to}} work on The New Adventures of Beany and Cecil for ABC, where he teamed up {{with many of the}} people who would later work with him on many of his Spümcø projects. ABC had been {{negotiating}} for the production of the show with the Clampett family, who insisted that Kricfalusi be part of the production as he was a strong proponent of Bob Clampett's cartoon style. The long negotiations delayed the start of production to mid-July, causing much of the animation to be rushed in order to meet the September deadline. Tensions rose between Kricfalusi and ABC over the tone of the show, leading to an uncomfortable atmosphere for the show's crew. The more ABC strove to soften the show, the more Kricfalusi pushed for shocking and offensive material. The Clampett family were ultimately not <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> cartoon, but remained supportive of Kricfalusi. ABC cancelled the show after six episodes, finding the humor not suitable for children's programming.|$|E

Milne initially thought Shepards style {{was not what}} he wanted, but used him to illustrate the book of poems When We Were <b>Very</b> Young. <b>Happy</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> results, Milne then insisted Shepard illustrate Winnie-the-Pooh. Realising his illustrators contribution to the books success, the writer arranged for Shepard to receive a share of his royalties.

5000|$|Batchelder was a {{founding}} member of the American Ornithologists' Union (AUO). He was always very keen to dispel the originally widespread impression that the AOU had originated in the Nuttall Ornithological Club. In fact, the Nuttall members were not <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> how <b>the</b> Club was [...] "rather unwillingly compelled" [...] to transfer control of its Bulletin, which was to become The Auk, to the AOU. Despite these tensions, Batchelder served as associate editor of the new publication from 1888 to 1893, and vice-president, then President (1900-1905) of the AOU.|$|R

5000|$|Out {{of the ten}} {{songs on}} the album [...] "Burns Like a Paper Rose" [...] {{seems to be one}} of the favorites. The album itself goes from {{haunting}} and ominous to more of a straight rock sound. Wolves Like Us showcase their experience and their talent in putting together the album as a whole. Larsh says that <b>the</b> band is <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> how <b>the</b> record turned out, and that they still genuinely enjoy playing the songs on the record. He goes on to say that as musicians they are always looking forward and focus on making the next record better.|$|R

500|$|Al-Jamri's first {{memories}} in Bahrain were {{during a visit}} with father {{during the month of}} Ramadan. Although he was mocked by other kids due to his partly Iraqi accent, al-Jamri said he was <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> visit as he found his village Bani Jamra much more [...] "open" [...] than Najaf. In 1973, al-Jamri returned to Bahrain with his family, spending 11 years of his life in Iraq.

500|$|That November, Joe Russo {{stated that}} {{the theme of the}} film was betrayal, calling it [...] "extremely emotional. [...] hinges on that emotion, and on a very {{personal}} level we didn't want [...] to become about politics and people arguing about platitudes.

Speaking about the post-production process in January 2016, the Russo brothers said, [...] "This has been the easiest post process we've ever had on a film. We're <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> how <b>the</b> movie was. Everyone is <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> where <b>the</b> movie was. For us, the tricky thing is the effects because it's a very complicated movie and there are some really big sequences in the film. The effects are on a much larger scale than the work we did on Winter Soldier. That's the part that becomes really difficult because you don't have a lot of time and everyone has very high standards. So everyone starts killing themselves at this point...we'll be done <b>with</b> <b>the</b> movie in two and a half months." [...] They also {{stated that the}} film would be doing [...] "a few reshoots" [...] in mid-to-late January.|$|R
500|$|The {{scene in}} which Daryl Mootz crashes his car after being hit with {{heart-shaped}} hail was filmed on a [...] "lonely road" [...] near Grapevine, California. The road was so seldom used that the Caltrans highway officials reportedly had no problem shutting down the entire road for the crew to film the scene. Director Kim Manners was <b>very</b> <b>happy</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> way the filming turned out, although he did note that the hardest shot to get was of the car crashing into the pole, because the car kept correcting itself and crashing at an undesired angle.|$|E
