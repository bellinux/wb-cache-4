40|$|An {{innovative}} approach to patient {{education has been}} developed {{using a combination of}} computer assisted instruction (CAI) and video techniques, CAI/VIDEO. Several hours of nutritional education material for diabetics have been prepared. The CAI/VIDEO material is presented on a microcomputer which is electronically connected to a <b>videodisk</b> <b>player.</b> A clinical evaluation of the effectiveness of CAI/VIDEO in patient education is currently being performed...|$|E
40|$|Presented is a {{progress}} report for the Regional Planetary Image Facilities (RPIF) prototype image data management and reduction system being jointly implemented by Washington University and the USGS, Flagstaff. The system will consist of a MicroVAX with a high capacity (approx 300 megabyte) disk drive, a compact disk player, an image display buffer, a <b>videodisk</b> <b>player,</b> USGS image processing software, and SYSTEM 1032 - a commercial relational database management package. The USGS, Flagstaff, will transfer their image processing software including radiometric and geometric calibration routines, to the MicroVAX environment. Washington University will have primary responsibility for developing the database management aspects {{of the system and}} for integrating the various aspects into a working system...|$|E
40|$|Several hundred {{thousand}} images have been returned by planetary missions and by earth-orbiting satellites. Locating specific images for study based on engineering {{data can be}} cumbersome and time consuming if done manually. BIRP, a FORTRAN program for small computers, is designed to quickly search through catalogs of image engineering data. A description of the desired images is entered and the BIRP program finds the images meeting the requirements. A <b>videodisk</b> <b>player</b> or microfiche reader may be controlled by BIRP so that images can be viewed immediately after a search. A search through 50, 000 images on a single parameter takes less than 1 min on a minicomputer. Data for each parameter is stored in a separate file so {{that the number of}} files and thus the storage space required may be varied to fit computers with different storage capacities. Most modern minicomputers with FORTRAN compilers and an 8 -bit byte variable type may use BIRP with minor modifications to the program...|$|E
