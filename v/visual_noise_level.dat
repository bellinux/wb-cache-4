The analyses used subjective responses from around 50, 000 occupants collected mainly in US office buildings using a web-based survey {{administered by the}} Center for the Built Environment (CBE) over the period of ten years. Overall satisfaction with the workspace significantly improved self-estimated job performance; increased satisfaction with temperature was estimated to provide the greatest improvement in self-estimated job performance, followed by increase in satisfaction with noise and air quality.

40|$|Summary-It {{is often}} imPrtant to assess visual neural {{function}} {{despite the presence}} of cloudy optic media. A psychophysical method is described which may prove useful for assessing visual function behind cloudy optics. Contrast thresholds for grating patches were measured in the presence and absence of one dimensional dynamic noise as a function of spatial frequency and <b>noise</b> <b>level.</b> These measurements provide a means for analyzing a visual deficit into optical-like and non-optical-like components. Given certain assumptions, a purely optical loss will depress the contrast sensitivity function, relative to a normal control, in the absence, but not in the presence of high <b>levels</b> of added <b>visual</b> <b>noise.</b> This predicted c:ffc:ct was borne: out by simulation and found in one patient.

We conduct a visual detection experiment in the absence and presence of various amounts of random <b>visual</b> <b>noise.</b> We define two indices of extrinsic stochastic resonance effects, consider {{the spread of the}} psychometric function without extrinsic noise as an intrinsic <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> index, and find that the indices of extrinsic stochastic resonance effects are negatively correlated with the intrinsic noise index. Our results suggest that extrinsic noise-induced sensitisation depends not only on the extrinsic but also on the intrinsic <b>noise</b> <b>level.</b> An interesting problem in human perception is how it can be affected by the presence of noise. This question has been addressed by adding noise externally to a signal when performing a signal detection task (Collins et al., 1996, 1997; Simonotto et al., 1997; Zeng et al., 2000; Kitajo et al., 2003; Sasaki et al., 2006, 2007).

In the human ventral cortex, retinotopic and higher visual areas (e. g. Lateral Occipital Complex-LOC) have been implicated {{in the analysis of}} simple and more complex features respectively. To test how processing of complex natural images progresses across the human ventral cortex, we used images of scenes and added <b>visual</b> <b>noise</b> that matched the signal in spatial-frequency power spectrum. The resulting images were rescaled to ensure constant mean luminance and r. m. s. contrast across all <b>noise</b> <b>levels.</b> We localized individually in each observer the retinotopic regions and the LOC and measured event-related BOLD response in these regions during a scene discrimination task performed at 4 <b>noise</b> <b>levels.</b> Behavioral accuracy increased with increasing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We found that log BOLD signal change from fixation baseline vs. log SNR is well-described by a straight line for all visual areas. The regression slope increased monotonically from lower to higher visual areas along the ventral stream. For example, changes by a factor of 8 in SNR produced little or no change to the BOLD response in V 1 /V 2, but resulted in progressively larger increases in V 4 v, posterior, and anterior sub-regions of the LOC. These findings suggest that the use of <b>visual</b> <b>noise</b> can reveal the progression in complexity of the natural-image features that are processed across the human visual areas...|$|R

These results have been explained using the critical-band-masking (CBM) model by supposing a visual filter-bank of constant relative bandwidth. However, some psychophysical and biological data {{support the idea of}} variable octave bandwidth. The CBM model has been used here to explain the progressive change of threshold curves with the <b>noise</b> mask <b>level</b> and to estimate the bandwidth of visual filters. Bayesian staircases were used in a 2 IFC paradigm to measure contrast thresholds of horizontal sinusoidal gratings (0. 25 - 8 c/deg) within a fixed Gaussian window and masked with one-dimensional, static, broadband white noise with each of five power density levels. Raw data showed that the contrast threshold curve progressively shifts upward and flattens out as the mask <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> increases. Theoretical thresholds from the CBM model were fitted simultaneously to the data at all five <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> using <b>visual</b> filters with log-Gaussian gain functions.

40|$|Although objects can be {{identified}} {{based solely on the}} information provided by the spatial structure of an image, color adds another perceptual dimension which may facilitate object identification. Here, we ask whether color in natural images is associated with improvements in object recognition performance. We used a procedure based on Fourier analysis to systematically degrade colored and achromatic natural images. Both stimulus types were mixed with increasing amounts of achromatic noise, leading to loss of spatial structure in the images. At a given <b>noise</b> <b>level,</b> the difference between colored and achromatic images was thus provided only by the remaining color. We used a delayed matching to sample paradigm, where a sample stimulus was presented (250 ms), followed by a probe stimulus after a delay period (1 s). Sample stimuli were presented at various <b>noise</b> <b>levels,</b> whereas probe stimuli were always undegraded. A lever press was required if the sample stimulus matched or was a degraded version of the probe stimulus. We have preliminary results from one monkey. The monkeyÂ’s recognition performance decreased as a function of <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> for both color and achromatic conditions. In addition, we found that the recognition performance was significantly higher for the color condition than the achromatic condition at the same degradation level (p= 0. 0303, N = 5). Since the spatial information for both stimulus versions is equally degraded by the <b>visual</b> <b>noise,</b> these results suggest that color, independently of spatial composition, is associated with an advantage in object identification performance...|$|R
