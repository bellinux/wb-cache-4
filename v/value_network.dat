25|$|<b>Value</b> <b>network</b> {{analysis}} {{offers a}} taxonomy for non-financial business reporting, which {{is becoming increasingly}} important in SEC Filings. In some approaches taxonomies are supported by Extensible Business Reporting Language XBRL. Venture capitalists and investors {{are concerned with the}} capability of a firm to create value in future. Financial statements are limited to current and past financial indicators and valuations of capital assets. In contrast, <b>value</b> <b>network</b> analysis is one approach to assessing current and future capability for value creation and to describe and analyze a business model.|$|E
25|$|<b>Value</b> <b>network</b> {{analysis}} (VNA) is {{a methodology}} for understanding, using, visualizing, optimizing {{internal and external}} value networks and complex economic ecosystems. The methods include visualizing sets of relationships from a dynamic whole systems perspective. Robust network analysis approaches are used for understanding value conversion of financial and non-financial assets, such as intellectual capital, into other forms of value.|$|E
50|$|Internal <b>value</b> <b>networks</b> {{focus on}} key activities, {{processes}} and relationships that cut across internal boundaries, such as order fulfillment, innovation, lead processing, or customer support. Value is created through exchange and {{the relationships between}} roles. <b>Value</b> <b>networks</b> operate in public agencies, civil society, in the enterprise, institutional settings, and all forms of organization. <b>Value</b> <b>networks</b> advance innovation, wealth, social good and environmental well-being.|$|R
50|$|Fjeldstad & Stabell's <b>value</b> <b>networks</b> is a {{configuration}} which {{emphasize that}} the value being created is between customers when they interact facilitated by the <b>value</b> <b>networks.</b> This represents a very different perspective from Christensen's but confusingly also one that is applicable {{in many of the}} same situations as Christensen's.|$|R
40|$|The {{implementation}} of electronic procurement processes for product-service bundles, consisting of product- and service components requires {{a consideration of}} strategic, tactical and operational procurement and {{information and communication technologies}} in <b>value</b> <b>networks.</b> In the past, the scientific discussion oriented on traditional procurement processes for products and technology-solutions. Increasingly, the design of hybrid procurement processes in <b>value</b> <b>networks</b> is of scientific interest. The combination of different procurement processes for products and services, however, includes problems. This paper shows the need for a process-oriented approach in procurement at several abstraction levels. We describe a model for the design of the electronic procurement process in <b>value</b> <b>networks</b> to serve product-service bundles. Different process characteristics are investigated for the applicability of product-service bundles and SCOR. We adjust a proposal for the procurement process in <b>value</b> <b>networks...</b>|$|R
25|$|Along {{with the}} more {{traditional}} business transactions the critical intangible exchanges are also mapped. Intangible exchanges are those mostly informal knowledge exchanges and benefits or support that build relationships and keep things running smoothly. These informal exchanges are actually the key to creating trust and opening pathways for innovation and new ideas. Traditional business practices ignore these important intangible exchanges, but they are made visible with a <b>value</b> <b>network</b> analysis.|$|E
25|$|Advocates of VNA {{claim that}} strong value-creating {{relationships}} support successful business endeavors at the operational, tactical, and strategic levels. A <b>value</b> <b>network</b> perspective, {{in this context}} would encompass {{both internal and external}} value networks — loose yet complex configurations of roles within industries, businesses, business units or functions and teams within organizations that engage in mutually beneficial relationships. Tools used in the past to analyze business value creation, such as the value chain and value added, are linear and mechanistic approaches based on a process perspective. These approaches are considered inadequate to address this new level of business complexity where value creating activities occur in complex, interdependent and dynamic relationships between multiple sets of actors.|$|E
25|$|<b>Value</b> <b>network</b> {{analysis}} addresses both {{financial and}} non-financial value. Every business relationship includes contractual or mandated activities between participants — and also informal exchanges of knowledge, favors, and benefits. The analysis {{begins with a}} visual map or diagram that first shows the essential contractual, tangible revenue- or funding-related business transactions and exchanges that occur between each node of the networks. Nodes represent real people, typically individuals, groups of individuals such as a business unit or aggregates of groups such {{as a type of}} business in an industry network. During analysis when adopting a reflective, double loop or generative learning mode, it is beneficial to regard nodes as role plays (shortened to roles). Practitioners have found {2} that conversation between participants about role plays within a larger whole invariably results in transforming individual behaviour and gaining commitment to implementing needed change as elaborated below.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to compare methods for {{detecting}} and/or measuring regular equivalence in <b>valued</b> <b>networks.</b> The methods compared can be divided into direct and indirect methods. The indirect methods considered here are all variants of the REGE algorithm (White, 2005). All direct methods have roots in Batagelj, Doreian, and Ferligoj (1992); however they have been adapted for <b>valued</b> <b>networks</b> (Žiberna, 2006 b). All approaches are compared on an empirical <b>valued</b> social <b>network.</b> Variants of the REGE algorithm are also compared on a few artificial <b>valued</b> <b>networks</b> in order to clarify their functionality. This is not necessary for direct approaches, which have clearly defined ideal blocks. In discussion, advantages and disadvantages of both indirect and direct approaches are discussed...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{addresses}} the development cycle of recent ‘services’ models. It considers that all products involve services and consequently maybe {{be considered as}} service systems. First, the issue of ‘services’ is described; next, the enhancement of ‘services’ via value creation is described, along with the progression from supply and demand chains, to value chains, to service value chains, and finally to service <b>value</b> <b>networks.</b> This progression pathway has developed over time, and has enabled ‘service’ and ‘e-service’ businesses to deliver and further develop competitive business solutions. The combinations of integrated, highly competitive, e-supply chains delivering the final ‘services’ suite to the frontline business seller moves the e-supply chain model to a more advanced level. Today, the recent concept of utilizing service <b>value</b> <b>networks</b> offers a key to future competitive solutions. Service <b>value</b> <b>networks</b> house fully integrated e-demand and e-supply chains working in harmony to the deliver both services and e-services. They are also highly agile and offer customer-induced flexible business solutions to customer requests. This chapter highlights the progression to service <b>value</b> <b>networks.</b> In addition it also offers the manager a balanced scorecard structural mechanism via which management controls over e-services and service <b>value</b> <b>networks</b> may be developed and maintained...|$|R

50|$|A <b>value</b> <b>network</b> is a {{business}} analysis perspective that describes social and technical resources within and between businesses. The nodes in a <b>value</b> <b>network</b> represent people (or roles). The nodes are connected by interactions that represent tangible and intangible deliverables. These deliverables {{take the form of}} knowledge or other intangibles and/or financial value. Value networks exhibit interdependence. They account for the overall worth of products and services.

40|$|Advancement {{in digital}} {{technology}} is rapidly changing the contemporary landscape {{of business and}} associated networks for manufacturing firms. Many traditional physical products are now being embedded with digital components, providing them digital capability to become digitized products. The digitization of physical products has become an important driver for digital service innovation within manufacturing industries. Such digital service innovation transforms <b>value</b> <b>networks</b> of manufacturing firms in various industries. While digitization of products and digital service innovation {{can be observed in}} many manufacturing industries, this thesis focuses on the transformation of <b>value</b> <b>networks</b> within the vehicle industry. This thesis is a collection of papers and a cover paper. The thesis reports from a collaborative project in the vehicle industry. The project explored new digital services for vehicles based on remote diagnostics technology. The exploration and conceptualization of digital services is investigated in a collaborative manner with participants from the vehicle industry. The results reflect that there is a paradigm shift for manufacturing firms digitizing their products, and stretching the business scope from product to solution oriented business. This thesis contributes to the existing literature on digital innovation with insights on the transformation of <b>value</b> <b>networks</b> in the vehicle industry. The research question addressed in this thesis is: How are <b>value</b> <b>networks</b> of manufacturing firms transformed by digital service innovation? To answer the question, this thesis conceptualizes how the value creating pattern of digitized products transforms <b>value</b> <b>networks</b> of manufacturing firms. A model is presented that reflects how the symbiotic value relationship between the digitized product and digital services transforms the roles, relationships and exchanges in the <b>value</b> <b>networks</b> of manufacturing firms. The model can serve as an analytical tool to further advance the knowledge on business aspects in digital innovation. This thesis contributes to practice by providing an understanding of how manufacturing firms can leverage value of digitized products and digital services in <b>value</b> <b>networks.</b> ReDi 2 Servic...|$|R

50|$|The {{concept of}} {{business}} value {{aligned with the}} theory that a firm is best viewed as a network of relationships both internal and external. These networks are sometimes called a <b>value</b> <b>network</b> or value chain. Each node in the network could be a stakeholder group, a resource, an organization, end-consumers, interest groups, regulators, or the environment itself. In a <b>value</b> <b>network,</b> value creation {{is viewed as a}} collaborative, creative, synergistic process rather than purely mechanistic or a result of command-and-control.|$|E
