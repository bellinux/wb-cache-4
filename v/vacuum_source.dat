40|$|Abstract—Traditional submillimeter-wave <b>vacuum</b> tube <b>sources</b> (backward wave oscillators), now {{available}} {{only from the}} former Soviet Union, have been a mainstay for generating modest amounts (mW) of narrow band (phase lockable) tunable CW RF power at frequencies from 50 to 1200 GHz. Recently groups in both Europe and the US have recognized the potential for producing these expensive, hand-assembled sources through monolithic techniques. A major step in this process is the forma-tion of the electron gun – typically a hot cathode operating at high temperature and requiring significant power. We have developed a cold field emission cathode based on multi-walled carbon nanotube bundles. This cathode can be integrated di-rectly onto a silicon circuit (as part of a monolithic process), has demonstrated emission at only a few volts/µm and current den-sities (unfocused) of more than 20 A/cm 2.

40|$|SUMMARY: Vacuum {{infusion}} processing {{has enjoyed}} a resurgence of interest {{in recent years as}} a primary mode of fabrication over traditional open mold processing. This renewed interest is driven by economic, environmental and engineering concerns as closed mold processing is recognized as being a cleaner, more efficient process than open molding. To facilitate vacuum infusion implementation, process simulation models are often used to gain an understanding of and to optimize the processing parameters for a given part. Simulation models to date derive resin flow characteristics, i. e. velocity, in part by way of the pressure gradient at the resin flow front. Although these simulations {{have been found to be}} generally accurate further process optimization may be realized through consideration of the effects of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>source’s</b> volumetric flow rate on the infusion process. This paper seeks to lay the groundwork for future model development by expanding our understanding of these effects and their implications...|$|R
40|$|Intense {{beams of}} metal ions can be formed from a <b>vacuum</b> arc ion <b>source.</b> Broadbeam {{extraction}} is convenient, and the time-averaged ion beam current delivered downstream can readily {{be in the}} tens of milliamperes range. The <b>vacuum</b> arc ion <b>source</b> has for these reasons found good application for metallurgical surface modification [...] it provides relatively simple and inexpensive access to high dose metal ion implantation. Several important source developments have been demonstrated recently, including very broad beam operation, macroparticle removal, charge state enhancement, and formation of gaseous beams. The authors have made a very broad beam source embodiment with beam formation electrodes 50 cm in diameter, producing a beam of width {approximately} 35 cm for a nominal beam area of {approximately} 1, 000 cm{sup 2 }, and a pulsed Ti beam current of about 7 A was formed at a mean ion energy of {approximately} 100 keV. Separately, they`ve developed high efficiency macroparticle-removing magnetic filters and incorporated such a filter into a <b>vacuum</b> arc ion <b>source</b> so as to form macroparticle-free ion beams. Jointly with researchers at the High Current Electronics Institute at Tomsk, Russia, and the Gesellschaft fuer Schwerionenforschung at Darmstadt, Germany, they`ve developed a compact technique for increasing the charge states of ions produced in the vacuum arc plasma and thus providing a simple means of increasing the ion energy at fixed extractor voltage. Finally, operation with mixed metal and gaseous ion species has been demonstrated. Here, they briefly review the operation of <b>vacuum</b> marc ion <b>sources</b> and the typical beam and implantation parameters that can be obtained, and describe these source advances and their bearing on metal ion implantation applications...|$|R

50|$|Consider {{a nozzle}} {{connected}} to a <b>vacuum</b> <b>source.</b> As the pressure ratio gets to about 2, the flow through the nozzle will approach the local speed of sound, and the flow becomes choked flow.
