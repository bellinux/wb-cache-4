40|$|Recent advancements in {{computer}} technology have motivated the automation of various functions of inspection. However, purely automated inspection does have limitations that humans can compensate for given their superiority in pattern recognition, rational decision-making, and adaptability to new circumstances. To achieve best performance and quality of inspection in a hybrid system, functions should be properly allocated between human and machines. Although the classical issues of speed and accuracy have been considered in this cooperative situation, the subjective measure of human trust in automation has not. This topic is an important one, impacting {{on the use of}} automation, especially in the context of function allocation. This paper, therefore, investigates the <b>variation</b> <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> as a function of a system’s action, specifically the type of errors made by the system using a printed circuit board inspection task. Most significantly, this study found that a linear regression model best fits the human trust in the system {{as a function of the}} number of times the human overrides the system’s response...|$|E

As a result, following a report by the Law Reform Committee, Petre Crowder introduced the <b>Variation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Trusts</b> Bill to Parliament, where it was given the Royal Assent on 23 July 1958, and came into force as the <b>Variation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Trusts</b> Act 1958.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{problem of}} secure routing in mobile ad hoc {{networks}} is long-standing {{and has been}} extensively studied by researchers. Recently, techniques of aggregating signatures have been applied to authenticate on demand routing protocols in mobile ad hoc networks. In this paper, we propose an efficient, single round multisignature scheme, CLFSR-M, constructed using cubic (third-order) linear feedback shift register (LFSR) sequences. The scheme, CLFSR-M is derived from a 2 -party signature scheme CLFSR-S, formed using a well-known variant of the generalized ElGamal signature scheme. The multisignature has been engineered to produce an efficient technique to authenticate route discovery in the dynamic source routing (DSR) protocol. Our technique supports authentication of cached routes. Delegating special functions to nodes or assuming the existence <b>of</b> a <b>trusted</b> third party to distribute certified public keys is not practical in mobile ad hoc networks. We consider a fully distributed mechanism of public key distribution and present two <b>variations</b> <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> policies, based on PGP, for effective management of individual and aggregate public keys. Finally, we perform a theoretical analysis including correctness and security of CLFSR-M and also present a performance (computation and communication costs, storage overhead) comparison of the proposed scheme with existing ones...|$|R

500|$|Prior to the 1961 Act, {{the areas}} {{trustees}} could invest in {{were based on}} the Trustee Act 1925, which set up a [...] "Statutory Lists" [...] system. The list contained only those investments available at the Post Office, along with land. It did {{not take into account the}} deprecation of currency or inflation, meaning that if the trustees invested in stocks and shares they were at risk of losing money simply because of the falling value of the pound sterling. As a result, even though the income from a trust might remain nominally constant, the real value of that income could be much reduced over the lifetime <b>of</b> the <b>trust.</b> This was recognised by lawyers, who had been advising their clients to structure trusts in such a way as to allow their trustees to invest in wider areas than the Statutory Lists. In 1952 the report of the Nathan Committee advocated reform, and the government published a White Paper on [...] "Government Policy on Charitable Trusts in England and Wales" [...] in 1955, which proposed a reform of the Statutory Lists system. This came about under the <b>Variation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Trusts</b> Act 1958, which allowed trustees to apply to the courts to widen their investment powers, a process that was expensive and slow.|$|R

The two game variants differ by the order of moves, which previous research suggests is an important factor in the likelihood of observing cooperation. However, this behavioral pattern is not replicated. While considerable trust is observed, there is little cooperation. Further, the results indicate that the negotiated price does not impact the likelihood of reaching the cooperative outcome...|$|R

25|$|Possibly {{the most}} {{important}} aspect <b>of</b> good <b>trust</b> management is to have good trustees. In virtually all cases, a settlor will have identified who trustees will be, but even if not or the chosen trustees refuse a court will, in the last resort appoint one under the Public Trustee Act 1906. A court may also replace trustees who are acting detrimentally to the trusts. Once a trust is running, <b>Trusts</b> <b>of</b> Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996 section 19 allow beneficiaries of full capacity to determine who the new trustees are, if other replacement procedures are not in the trust document. This is, however, simply an articulation of the general principle from Saunders v Vautier that beneficiaries of full age and sound mind may by consensus dissolve the trust, or do with the property as they wish. According to the Trustee Act 2000 sections 11 and 15, a trustee may not delegate their power to distribute trust property without liability, but they may delegate administrative functions, and the power to manage assets if accompanied with a policy statement. If they do, they can be exempt from negligence claims. For the trust terms, these may be varied in any unforeseen emergency, but only in relation to the trustee's management powers, not a beneficiary's rights. The <b>Variation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Trusts</b> Act 1958 allows courts to vary trust terms, particularly on behalf of minors, people not yet entitled, or with remoter interests under a discretionary trust. For the latter group of people, who may have highly restricted rights, or know very little about a trust terms, the Privy Council affirmed in Schmidt v Rosewood Trust Ltd that courts have an inherent jurisdiction to administer trusts, and this goes especially to a requirement for information about a trust to be disclosed.|$|R

Our main findings are that cooperation is indeed more likely in the payoff dominated game. Moreover, indefinite repetition increases both cooperation rates and the likelihood with which the payoff dominated game is chosen. Overall we conclude that available explicit incentives indeed do affect relational contracting and, anticipating this, agents may choose weak explicit incentives to facilitate implicit agreements...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This study argues that, in {{addition}} to political and economic factors, the level <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> between decision makers influenced outcomes in European-Russian energy cooperation. Drawing on selected cases of commercial partnerships and long-term contracts, it examines the impact <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> and {{the process by which}} it was developed or undermined between European and Russian partners. The findings are the following. Firstly, trust appeared to mitigate suspicion and encouraged cooperation between commercial and political actors. Secondly, when trust was present, conflicts of interest were more easily overcome while in its absence, a spiral of litigation and attempts at political coercion ensued. Thirdly, the development <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> was partially determined by history, collective memories and pre-existing political and economic conditions. At the same time, actors had the option to make decisions that could contribute to building trust or not. Fourthly, the analysis demonstrates a wide <b>variation</b> in levels <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> between West European companies and politicians toward Russia. And finally, it underscores the importance of interpersonal relations and energy companies as non-state actors. Because of the size and scope of these projects, the trust factor has implications not only on commercial ventures but also national economies, energy security and international relations...|$|R

40|$|Survey {{data have}} {{generally}} found trust {{to be much}} lower in Africa than in developed countries. This paper analyses {{the extent to which}} trust decreases with social distance, using data from a survey conducted in a village in rural Cameroon. Participants are asked a number <b>of</b> questions about <b>trust</b> in people with varying levels of social distance: fellow group members, fellow villagers, people from neighbouring villages and people in general. The results indicate that the level <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> diminishes as social distance (the radius <b>of</b> <b>trust)</b> increases. There is more trust in fellow group members than there is in other villagers, and more trust in fellow villagers than there is in those outside the village. I also analyse the correlation between the respondents' characteristics and trust. A substantial part <b>of</b> the <b>variation</b> in levels <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> can be explained by observable individual characteristics. The main correlates <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> are education, whether the respondent is divorced and the number of years lived in the village. Divorced persons are significantly less trusting, while increases in the number of years lived in the village are associated with increases in the levels <b>of</b> <b>trust.</b> People who have completed primary education are significantly more trusting. In only one case (trust in fellow villagers) is age significantly correlated with trust, and its effect is negative. Income is significantly positively correlated with trust in fellow villagers and trust in people from neighbouring villages as well, but uncorrelated with trust in people in general. Respondents' personal characteristics are insignificantly correlated with trust as social distance increases. Copyright 2010 The author 2010.

40|$|Derived {{from ancient}} Justinian and English common law, the “public trust doctrine” vests {{ultimate}} and inalienable ownership of certain {{tracts of land}} in the state. Many states have incorporated some <b>variation</b> <b>of</b> the public <b>trust</b> doctrine into their statutes, constitutions, or common law. The application <b>of</b> the public <b>trust</b> doctrine, however, has been challenged as constituting a Fifth Amendment regulatory taking of private property under the United States Constitution, giving rise to the need for just compensation. This type of application <b>of</b> the public <b>trust</b> doctrine was at issue in the nearly decade-long saga culminating in the decision of Palazzolo v. State. The case featured an owner of marshland property who sought compensation for Rhode Island’s denial of his repeated development requests. The Rhode Island Superior Court in Palazzolo ultimately held that the state’s denial of the landowner’s requests did not constitute a regulatory taking. This Comment analyzes the role that the public trust doctrine played in the court’s weighing of the various factors in a regulatory takings analysis. Further, this Comment argues that the public trust doctrine, as applied in Palazzolo, represents a tremendously powerful means for states to set aside publically valuable swaths of land, a means capable of withstanding even a constitutional challenge...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: A {{legacy of}} racial {{discrimination}} in medical research and {{the health care system}} has been linked to a low level <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> in medical research and medical care among African Americans. While racial differences in trust in physicians have been demonstrated, little is known about racial <b>variation</b> in <b>trust</b> <b>of</b> health insurance plans and hospitals. For the present study, the authors analyzed responses to a cross-sectional telephone survey to assess the independent relationship of self-reported race (non-Hispanic black or non-Hispanic white) with trust in physicians, hospitals, and health insurance plans. METHODS: Respondents ages 18 - 75 years were asked to rate their level <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> in physicians, health insurance plans, and hospitals. Items from the Medical Mistrust Index were used to assess fear and suspicion of hospitals. RESULTS: Responses were analyzed for 49 (42 %) non-Hispanic black and 69 (58 %) non-Hispanic white respondents (N= 118; 94 % of total survey population). A majority <b>of</b> respondents <b>trusted</b> physicians (71 %) and hospitals (70 %), but fewer trusted their health insurance plans (28 %). After adjustment for potential confounders, non-Hispanic black respondents were less likely to trust their physicians than non-Hispanic white respondents (adjusted absolute difference 37 %; p= 0. 01) and more likely to trust their health insurance plans (adjusted absolute difference 28 %; p= 0. 04). The difference in <b>trust</b> <b>of</b> hospitals (adjusted absolute difference 13 %) was not statistically significant. Non-Hispanic black respondents were more likely than non-Hispanic white respondents to be concerned about personal privacy and the potential for harmful experimentation in hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Patterns <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> in components <b>of</b> our health care system differ by race. Differences in trust may reflect divergent cultural experiences of blacks and whites as well as differences in expectations for care. Improved understanding of these factors is needed if efforts to enhance patient access to and satisfaction with care are to be effective...|$|R
