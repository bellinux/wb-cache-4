Creep experiments were performed in the temperature range of 747 - 845 K at 300 MPa. The water content of the melt varies from nominally dry to 6. 2 wt% H 2 O. The Fe 2 +/Fetot ratio was determined for each sample in the quenched glass using a colorimetric method. Pressure has minor influence on the viscosity compared with the effect of temperature, water content (main compositional parameter controlling the viscosity) or with the Fe 2 +/Fetot ratio (especially important at low water content of the melt). Based on our new viscosity data and literature data with measured Fe 2 +/Fetot ratio we propose a new empirical equation to estimate the viscosity η (in Pa·s) of andesitic melts {{as a function of}} temperature T (in K), water content w (in wt%) and Fe 2 +/Fetot ratio.
