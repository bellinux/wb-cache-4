40|$|Abstract – Extrusion {{is one of}} {{the widest}} used and the most basic {{processes}} of plastic forming, and the metal flow in extrusion is affected by many factors, such as friction, die shape, billet temperature and so on. Among these factors, friction is the key boundary condition to determine the property of the extruded products. In this paper research and measurements of velocity fields and impact of friction on velocity distribution in forward extruded specimens of copper alloy were analysed using the <b>visioplasticity</b> method. The <b>visioplasticity</b> method was used to find the complete velocity distributions from the experimental data by the finite-difference method.

Those are extrusion, {{a combination of}} extrusion and chipping, mechanical rolling, hydraulic expansion, and sintering of metal powder, all of which involve complex operations and high production costs. Grooved rolling is introduced as a simple process to form enhanced boiling surfaces. First, the deformation caused by grooved rolling was analysed by applying a <b>visioplasticity</b> method with plasticine model rolling. Characteristic deformations using the grooved rolling technique occur {{in the form of}} a continuous indentation by the teeth of the grooved roll to the surface of a plane sheet or strip, deformation is mainly confined to the region between the teeth of the upper grooved roll and lower flat roll, plastic flow of the work occurs mainly in a longitudinally and the tips of rib projections formed by grooved rolling are rounded. Second, grooved rolling of thin aluminum and copper strips was examined and it was found that 1 mm pitch grooves can be formed on the strip surfaces successfully. Finally, three-stand tandem mill, by which longitudinal grooving, additional 45 degree cross grooving, and flattening and trimming of the rounded tips of the rib projections could be performed, was introduced as a test system, and some examples of products were obtained by the system. ...|$|E

The experiments were carried out at room temperature, which was within the range of 28 to 32 °C. The testing lubricant was refined, bleached and deodorized palm olein (RBD palm olein).

40|$|The {{techniques}} of physical modeling and <b>visioplasticity</b> {{were used to}} explore the behavior during extrusion of particulate metal-matrix composites. Plasticine billets with nylon inclusions were chosen as modeling materials. Initial full-billet testing was done {{in order to make}} sure that the previously-observed phenomenon of void formation during extrusion of half-billets was not due solely to interaction between the half-billet and the transparent chamber cover or its silicon gel coating. Extensive half-billet testing was then undertaken. A constant reduction ratio of 2 : 1 was used. Friction was kept as constant as possible: the die and chamber were coated with talcum powder, and the chamber cover was coated with silicon gel. The semicone die angle was varied. Six values were used: 15 °, 30 °, 45 °, 60 °, 75 °, and 90 °. Some degree of void-formation around the front and back of the nylon half-sphere was found in almost all samples. However, the size of the voids was significantly smaller in the billets extruded through 15 ° dies than in those extruded through the other dies. It may be that there is a critical angle somewhere below 30 °. Voids visible on the top of the billet were similarly shaped for both front and back positions. They had conical profiles, with the largest cross-sectional area at the sphere, and were slightly overhung with plasticine along their sides. Voids not visible from the top of the billet, but only when the billet was cut open and the half-sphere removed, were smaller than the top-visible voids, but had clear similarities to them. Video-taping of the extrusions, with normal and magnifying lenses, allowed the flow patterns in front and back of the nylon half-sphere to be observed at length. A distinct flow pattern emerged.

40|$|In {{the first}} of the metalforming {{operations}} considered, that of plane-strain side-pressing, the finite-element predicted deformation behaviour of 60 - 40 brass and 7075 aluminium alloy has been compared with experiment. Both <b>visioplasticity</b> and hardness studies have been performed. The macrohardness survey was found to be the most appropriate in validating the use of the finite-element technique. The numerical calculations of the local stress and strain distributions are then used with a number of previously published continuum fracture criteria to predict the fracture initiation sites. For certain of the successful criteria the level of deformation at fracture has also been predicted using critical values of fracture found experimentally from an axisymmetric tensile test. For the operation of plane-strain side-pressing, very good agreement with both the experimental fracture initiation site, and the level of deformation at fracture, is reported for the criterion of a critical value of generalised plastic strain at fracture, and the equivalent criterion of generalised plastic work. The second metalforming operation considered is simple upsetting. The fracture initiation behaviour of 60 - 40 brass has been examined for specimens of the four initial aspect ratios of 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5 and 2. 0. Again, the generalised plastic strain/work criterion has successfully predicted the experimental fracture initiation sites in all cases. However, satisfactory levels of deformation at fracture predictions have only been found for the two lower aspect ratio specimens. A small range of strip compression and tension operations on 60 - 40 brass compose the third type of metalforming operation considered in this thesis. Yet again the generalised plastic strain/work criterion has successfully predicted the fracture initiation site found experimentally but not the level of deformation at fracture. Finally, the axisymmetric extrusion of 60 - 40 brass and 7075 aluminium alloy is examined. For the brass using the generalised plastic strain/work criterion, good agreement with experiment has been found for both the fracture initiation site and level of deformation at fracture found experimentally. However, for the aluminium alloy only the correct fracture initiation site has been found. In summary, it appears that the fracture criterion of a critical value of generalised plastic strain/work has successfully predicted the fracture initiation site found experimentally in all the operations considered in this thesis but has been unable to consistently predict the correct level of deformation at fracture. These differences in the predicted and experimental level of deformation at fracture cannot be explained with reference to the finite-element calculated levels of hydrostatic stress. Further work is necessary to explain this difference...|$|E
