30|$|Query The query {{process is}} just like searching from it. For example, what is the <b>max</b> <b>value</b> from <b>array</b> index 2 to 4 ? The process is as follows: we start from root node if we see that a node range is set under {{required}} query then {{we will go to}} its left and right child node. For example, when we are in root node, its range is [1 4] and required range is [2 4] that means required ranges set under root node. We should divide the root node to left and right child. Then, we can see that the right child total range sets under query range so instead of divide it by left and right child we should take that node value which is 7. On the other hand, root node’s left child take ranges [1 – 2] which set under query range but not totally so we again divide it by left and right child which are node id 4 [1 – 1] and 5 [2 – 2] where node id 5 sets under totally to the queried range so we will take its value which is – 9 but node id 4 [1 – 1] is out of the queried range. So we need to just ignore that node. At last, the required answer is the <b>max</b> <b>value</b> between 7 and – 9 which is 7. Time Complexity is O(log(n)).|$|R

This problem presents very different algorithmic challenges from aggregate and selection queries, {{in the sense that}} an individual node cannot by itself determine its inclusion in the query result. We present novel query processing algorithms for this problem, with the goal of minimizing message traffic in the network. These algorithms employ a hierarchy of local constraints, or thresholds, to leverage network topology such that message-passing is localized. We evaluate all algorithms using simulated and real-world data to study various trade-offs. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Exercise is very {{important}} for keeping and increasing healt. Exercise is classified aerobic and anaerobic. Aerobic exercise will affect the cardiorespiratoric more than anaerobic one, because it will enhance the oxygen uptake. Men fitness can be measured by the VO 2 <b>max</b> <b>values.</b> VO 2 <b>max</b> is the maximum amount of oxygen in millilitres, one can use in one minute per kilogram of body weight. Those who are fit have higher VO 2 <b>max</b> <b>values</b> and can exercise more intensely than those who are not as well conditioned. Objectives: To know that how programmed aerobic exercise influence the VO 2 max change in 12 weeks. Method: This way an experimental study using pre and post test control group design. Seventy students were divided in two groups, treatment and control groups. Measurement performed before, on 6 th weeks and after the 12 weeks treatment period for dtetermination of the VO 2 max, both control and group of treatment. Result: There was significant increases of VO 2 max in the treatment group after 12 weeks programmed aerobic exercise. There was not significant increases of VO 2 max in the control group after 12 weeks anaerobic exercise. There was significant difference of VO 2 <b>max</b> <b>values</b> between treatment and control group at 12 th week. Conclusion: Aerobic training for about 12 weeks could increase VO 2 <b>max</b> <b>values.</b> Key words: aerobic exercise, VO 2 max...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Two {{cysteine}} residues {{were introduced}} to selected positions (Serine- 309 and Serine- 43) of the Thermoplasma acidophilum citrate synthase. Serine- 309 Cysteine mutation drastically reduced the activity, {{as well as the}} thermostabiity of the enzyme. Although Serine- 43 Cysteine mutation reduced the enzyme activity, it did not have any effect on the thermostability. Both wild-type and cysteine- 43 mutant Thermoplasma citrate synthase enzymes were purified to homogenity using affinity chromatography on Matrex Gel Red A. The cysteine- 43 mutant Thermoplasma citrate synthase was strikingy similar to the wild-type recombinant citrate synthase in its molecular size, substrate and cofactor specificities, pH profile and thermal resistance.

In the ordinal case, it refers to the cardinality of the scale values that appear in the set of all capacities.
