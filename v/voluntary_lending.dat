50|$|With the Truce {{more normal}} times arrived. The {{borrowing}} requirement went to zero {{with the arrival}} of the temporary peace and this probably helped the transition to <b>voluntary</b> <b>lending.</b> After the Truce ended in 1621 expenditures for war again rose steeply, but this time the Republic, and in particular Holland, had no trouble borrowing on average 4 million guilders annually, which helped keep down the rise in taxation that might otherwise have been necessary. By 1640 confidence in Holland's public debt (and the supply of funds available for borrowing) had risen so much, that a refinancing of the outstanding debt with a much lower interest rate of 5 percent was possible (followed in 1665 by a conversion to 4 percent).|$|E
30|$|For Airbnb, {{the initial}} idea of sharing extra {{bedrooms}} is good, {{but the idea}} has been converted to commercial businesses, particularly in big cities like New York and San Francisco. For instance, in New York City, many hosts control multiple listings and over 200 properties in some cases [44]. As mentioned earlier, the academic realm has no consensus on the definition of sharing economy, possibly because of differing interpretations of the act of sharing [10]. Many definitions of sharing economy do not fall into strict concepts of sharing. Some prior conceptualizations (e.g., Belk [20]) assume reciprocity and joint possessions, but these definitions do not truly reflect the practices of sharing economy services such as Airbnb [23]. Belk [20] distinguishes prototypical characteristics of sharing and commodity exchange. Later, Belk [16] identifies commercial car-sharing businesses such as Zipcar and for-profit home-sharing organizations like Airbnb as pseudo-sharing. According to Belk [16], such sharing is not prosocial sharing because “sharing includes <b>voluntary</b> <b>lending,</b> pooling and allocation of resources, and authorized use of public property (sharing), but not contractual renting, leasing, or unauthorized use of property by theft or trespass (pseudo-sharing).” Ozanne and Ballantine [56] argue that sharing behaviors reduce consumption of specific brands or product categories, and thus, they are an alternative to consumption: anti-consumption. Additionally, many of the initial startups that partook in sharing economy have quit operations or changed directions. Many {{of those who have}} stayed have ended the person-to-person narrative as a marketing technique and have begun to compete on price. Thus, the sharing economy has evolved to look less unique and revolutionary, a development which deepens the concerns about its legitimacy.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the tradeoffs facing creditors {{of a country}} whose debt is large enough that the country cannot attract <b>voluntary</b> new <b>lending.</b> If the country is unable to meet its debt service requirements out of current income, the creditors have two choices. They can finance the country, lending at an expected loss {{in the hope that}} the country will eventually be able to repay its debt after all; or they can forgive, reducing the debt level to one that the country can repay. The post- 1983 debt strategy of the IMF and the US has relied on financing, but many current calls for debt reform call for forgiveness instead. The paper shows that the choice between financing and forgiveness represents a tradeoff. Financing gives the creditors an option value: if the country turns out to do relatively well, creditors will not have written down their claims unnecessarily. However, the burden of debt distorts the country's incentives, since the benefits of good performance go largely to creditors rather than itself. The paper also shows that the tradeoff itself can be improved if both financing and forgiveness are made contingent on states of nature that the country cannot affect, such as oil prices, world interest rates, etc. ...|$|R
40|$|In an open network, how {{to provide}} deterrents to {{malicious}} behaviors is an important issue. A common solution {{is the use of}} cryptographic primitives. In this solution, execution logs are stored by each entity and used when needs arise for trouble settlement or judgment; authorities are involved mainly in the settlement phase. Depending on system-design and security policies, however, more active authorized procedures would be of great help. In preparation for such a situation, this paper introduces a framework of an inspection mechanism for server-and-client protocols which are based on a private-key cipher. The mechanism uses two “current ” private keys per server-and-client pair. One of them is updated session by session and thus the system can accept one-session rental of the membership; <b>voluntary</b> clients can <b>lend</b> their membership to the inspection authority without disclosing the current keys of the next and future sessions. As an application example, a digital-valuable storage system called an “electronic safe-deposit box ” is described and its protocol is shown in part. 1...|$|R
40|$|The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (S-O Act) of 2002 {{requires}} principal {{officers to}} certify under oath to {{the veracity of}} information contained in SEC filings and opine {{on the effectiveness of}} the internal control system. This study examines the determinants and contents of corporate voluntary disclosure of management 2 ̆ 7 s responsibilities during the five-year period preceding the S-O Act. We predict that the voluntary disclosure of management 2 ̆ 7 s responsibilities for financial information signals certain incentives and characteristics of the reporting firm that are relevant to financial statement users and regulators. Consistent with our predictions, our findings reveal significant differences between issuing and non-issuing firms as to the effectiveness of an individual firm 2 ̆ 7 s internal control system, access to capital markets, audit committee characteristics, and ownership structure. An empirical analysis of the contents of these assertions also reveals different areas of emphasis and selectivity by management, which represents an informative link to existing disclosure mandates. The results of this study contribute to our knowledge of management 2 ̆ 7 s motivations for <b>voluntary</b> disclosure and <b>lend</b> credence to the mandatory certification requirements and related disclosure reforms established in the post-Enron era...|$|R
