40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} BacT/ALERT FA (FA) medium, a new aerobic BacT/ALERT FAN (FAN) medium (Organon Teknika Corporation, Durham, N. C.) that {{does not require the}} added cost and inconvenience of a <b>venting</b> <b>unit,</b> we inoculated blood specimens from adult patients with suspected sepsis into an original FAN aerobic culture bottle and an FA bottle. Of 7, 745 blood culture sets containing both bottles, 5, 256 (68 %) met the criteria for adequacy of filling. A total of 466 isolates judged to represent the causes of true infections were recovered from 276 patients; 271 isolates were recovered from both bottles, 82 were recovered from the FAN bottle only, and 113 were recovered from the FA bottle only (P < 0. 05). More Burkholderia cepacia isolates (P < 0. 01), Candida albicans isolates (P < 0. 001), Cryptococcus neoformans isolates (P < 0. 01), yeasts overall (P < 0. 001), and total microorganisms (P < 0. 05) were recovered from FA bottles. Of cultures found to be positive within the first 72 h of incubation, the mean times to detection were almost identical for FAN (20. 4 h) and FA (20. 7 h) bottles. Of 263 isolates that caused monomicrobic episodes of bloodstream infections, 180 were detected in both bottles, 32 were detected in FAN bottles only, and 51 were detected in FA bottles only (P < 0. 05). Of 186 isolates considered to be contaminants, 63 were detected in both media, 64 were detected in FAN bottles only, and 59 were detected in FA bottles only (P was not significant). The number of false-positive results were comparable: 69 (1. 3 %) in FAN bottles and 56 (1. 1 %) in FA bottles. However, there were 14 isolates with false-negative results (6 yeasts, 6 nonfermenters, and 1 isolate each of Propionibacterium acnes and coagulase-negative staphylococci) in FAN bottles, whereas there were none in FA bottles. On the basis of these results, we conclude that the new nonvented FA bottle is superior to the original vented FAN medium for the recovery of B. cepacia and yeasts, especially C. albicans and C. neoformans, and is comparable to FAN medium for other microorganisms...|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} the volume of blood cultured in the detection of clinically important bacteremia and fungemia in adults, we evaluated the yield and speed of detection of microorganisms from 5, 317 paired 2 - and 5 -ml samples of blood. The same kind of medium (supplemented peptone broth with 0. 03 % sodium polyanetholsulfonate) and atmosphere of incubation (open <b>venting</b> <b>units)</b> were used for all blood cultures. Only adequately filled (less than or equal to 80 % of stated volume) sets (20 -ml tube and 50 -ml bottle) were compared statistically. Significantly more bacteria (p less than 0. 01), Pseudomonas spp. In particular (P less than 0. 05), were isolated from the 5 -ml samples of blood. We conclude that the volume of blood cultured is a critical factor in the detection of septicemia. Consequently, valid evaluation of other factors influencing the detection of septicemia must be based on comparisons in which equal volumes of blood are cultured...|$|R

The atmosphere of incubation (open <b>venting</b> <b>units)</b> and ratio of blood to broth (1 : 10) were the same for both samples. Only cultures with adequate blood samples (greater {{than or equal to}} 80 % of stated volume) were compared statistically. Overall, SPB/SPS outperformed TSB/SAS. Bacteroidaceae and Eubacterium were found more often (P less than 0. 05) and viridans streptococci were found sooner (P less than 10 (- 4)) in SPB/SPS than in TSB/SAS. Most importantly, staphylococci were found both more often (P less than 0. 03) and sooner (P less than 10 (- 7)) in SPB/SPS than in TSB/SAS. In a separate experiment, SAS slowed the growth of a clinical strain of Staphylococcus aureus in TSB.

40|$|The {{value of}} {{hypertonic}} {{media in the}} detection of bacteremia and fungemia is controversial, since prior clinical trials have yielded conflicting results with different media. Earlier, we showed that the addition of 10 % sucrose to supplemented peptone broth at a 1 : 10 ratio of blood to broth yielded better recovery of Staphylococcus epidermidis, the Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and yeasts. To evaluate the effect of 10 % sucrose on blood cultured at a 1 : 5 ratio, we compared the yield and speed of detection of clinically important microorganisms from adult patients in 5, 839 blood samples cultured in supplemented peptone broth with 0. 03 % sodium polyanetholesulfonate with and without 10 % sucrose. The atmosphere of incubation (open <b>venting</b> <b>units),</b> 1 : 5 ratio of blood to broth, and methods of processing were the same for both bottles. Recovery of facultative gram-positive (P less than 0. 02) and gram-negative (P less than 0. 02) bacteria was improved, but the recovery of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria was both reduced (P less than 0. 01) and delayed (P less than 0. 02) by sucrose. The total yield of microorganisms including fungi, however, was increased with sucrose.

The central part of The Crater comprises basal accidental lithic rich tuff breccias and unsorted, weakly bedded lapilli tuffs inferred to have been deposited by "en masse " deposition of fall back tephra and/or high concentration pyroclastic density currents from vent opening phreatomagmatic explosions, near <b>vent.</b> The <b>unit</b> subsequently subsided into the conduit. Above this unit, is a juvenile rich lapilli tuff deposited near vent by high-concentration pyroclastic density currents.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} atmosphere of incubation in the detection of clinically important bacteremia and fungemia in adults, we compared the yield of microorganisms from 10, 541 paired 5 -ml samples of blood incubated aerobically and anaerobically. The medium, supplemented peptone broth (SPB) with 0. 03 % sodium polyanetholesulfonate, and the ratio of blood to broth (1 : 10) were {{the same for all}} cultures. Only cultures with adequate blood samples (greater than or equal to 80 % of stated volume) were compared statistically. More fungi (P less than 10 (- 7)) grew in continuously vented bottles of SPB. Aerobic incubation also favored (P less than 0. 01) isolation of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Eubacterium; more than 80 % of these bacterial organisms were detected only in vented bottles. Anaerobic incubation (plugged <b>venting</b> <b>units)</b> did not significantly favor the isolation of any genus of microorganisms, although an estimated 11 % more Bacteroidaceae grew in the unvented bottle of SPB. By comparison of our data with published results for other media, we conclude that the need for both aerobic and anaerobic incubation of blood cultures is dependent upon the medium used and the microorganisms likely to be encountered. Vented incubation of blood cultured in SPB is crucial for detection of fungi and some bacteria. Routine use of an unvented bottle of SPB may not be worthwhile for patients in whom Bacteroidaceae cause bacteremia infrequently. However, when Bacteroidaceae are suspected as the cause of sepsis, use of an unvented bottle of SPB is prudent...|$|R
40|$|A {{discontinuous}} zone of subdued, west-facing fault scarps offset Quaternary alluvium along 58 km of {{the western}} piedmont of the Santa Rita Mountains, south of Tucson, Arizona. Scarps trend NE to N-S and are 1 to 6 km basinward from the deeply embayed mountain front. Scarp heights range from 1 to 7 m, and maximum scarp slope angles range from 3 ° to 9. 5 °. A 6 -m-deep trench excavated in middle Pleistocene and younger deposits exposed a high-angle fault zone with about 3. 5 m of total displacement. Estimated ages of faulted and unfaulted surfaces, extent of degradation of piedmont scarps, and stratigraphic relations exposed in the trench suggest an age of about 100 ka for the most recent surface-rupture <b>vent.</b> <b>Units</b> having well-developed relict soils of late Pleistocene age and older are faulted, whereas units having weakly to moderately developed soils, of latest Pleistocene and Holocene age, are not offset. Morphologic fault scarp analyses suggest an age of 60 to 100 ka. Earthquake magnitude estimates derived using minimum and maximum seismic source moment calculations range from 6. 4 to 7. 3. One or more earlier surface-rupture vents are implied by significantly higher scarp heights on mid-Pleistocene than on late Pleistocene surfaces. Scarp heights on middle and early (?) Pleistocene surfaces are similar, restricting faulting to post-middle Pleistocene time (< 200 to 300 ka), Stratigraphic relation-ships observed in the trench also suggest two fault-displacement events. Tec-tonic landform analysis of the mountain front-piedmont area implies several m. y. of inactivity along the range-bounding fault system prior to these late Quaternary displacements. Extremely long recurrent intervals between displacement events and reactivation of faulting after an interval of tectonic quiescence are typical of late Quaternary fault behavior in southeastern Arizona...|$|R
40|$|A {{preliminary}} volcanological mapping {{has been}} carried out {{in the western part of}} the Bakony- Balaton Highland Volcanic Field (BBHVF) around Szigliget (Hungary) village. Pyroclastic rocks have been found building up the three distinct hillsides in the area. The pyroclastic rock beds in each hillside show similar north-westward dip direction and similar textural and compositional characteristics, suggestive of a complex but closely related volcanic system in the area. The pyroclastic deposits have been grouped into three units according to their textural, compositional and stratigraphic characteristics. Unit 1 which represents the lowermost stratigraphic position crops out in the southern side of the study area. It consists of coarse-grained, matrix-supported massive to weakly bedded, accidental lithic clast-rich, block-bearing lapilli tuffs / tuff breccias, extremely rich in deep-seated accidental lithic and peridotite lherzolite clasts. Unit 2 which represents an intermediate stratigraphic position crops out in the southern and north-east hilltops. It consists of coarse-grained accidental lithic clast-rich, normal graded, bedded, vitric lapilli tuffs / tuff beds. Deep-seated accidental lithic clasts are common, but large peridotite lherzolite fragments are relatively rare. Unit 3 which represents the highest stratigraphic position in the area crops out in the northwestern side. It consists of fine-to-coarse grained, bedded, accidental lithic clast-rich vitric lapilli tuff / tuff beds. Deep-seated lithic clasts as well as peridotite lherzolite fragments are rare. Accidental lithic clasts, derived from shallow prevolcanic strata (Neogene sediments), have a dominant proportion of pyroclastic rocks in this unit. In each unit the volcanic glasses are angular, non- to highly vesiculated tephrite to phono-tephrite shards. The presence of sideromelane glass shards and the large amount of accidental lithic clasts in beds from each units indicate subsurface phreatomagmatic explosive processes during formation of pyroclastic rocks at Szigliget. The pyroclastic rocks are interpreted as part of a former crater rim deposits around maar basin which subsequently subsided inward into a <b>vent.</b> <b>Unit</b> 1 is interpreted to be a lower diatreme deposit and Unit 2 and Unit 3 a series of near-vent pyroclastic density currents and fallout tephra...|$|R
50|$|Farallon Negro {{probably}} is a stratovolcano {{which has been}} degraded by erosion, resulting in the exposure of intrusive bodies. Before the erosion, the volcano may have been over 6000 m high and covering a surface area of 700 km2. Another theory suggests that Farallon Negro was a multi-vent complex. The basement altitude is about 2600 m. These include the Agua Rica and Bajo de la Alumbrera porphyry centres and the Agua Tapada and Bajo el Durazno intrusion.

5000|$|Typically, {{residential}} and industrial evaporative coolers use direct evaporation, {{and can be}} described as an enclosed metal or plastic box with vented sides.

To cool, the fan draws ambient air through <b>vents</b> on the <b>unit's</b> sides and through the damp pads.

30|$|The phreatic {{eruption}} at Ontake volcano on 27 September 2014, which caused the worst volcanic {{disaster in the}} past half-century in Japan, was reconstructed based on observations of the proximal pyroclastic density current (PDC) and fallout deposits. Witness observations were also used to clarify the eruption process. The deposits are divided into three major depositional units (Units A, B, and C) which are characterized by massive, extremely poorly sorted, and multimodal grain-size distribution with 30 – 50  wt% of fine ash (silt–clay component). The depositional condition was initially dry but eventually changed to wet. Unit A originated from gravity-driven turbulent PDCs in the relatively dry, vent-opening phase. Unit B was then produced mainly by fallout from a vigorous moist plume during <b>vent</b> development. <b>Unit</b> C was derived from wet ash fall in the declining stage. Ballistic ejecta continuously occurred during vent opening and development. As observed in the finest population of the grain-size distribution, aggregate particles were formed throughout the eruption, {{and the effect of}} water in the plume on the aggregation increased with time and distance. Based on the deposit thickness, duration, and grain-size data, and by applying a scaling analysis using a depth-averaged model of turbulent gravity currents, the particle concentration and initial flow speed of the PDC at the summit area were estimated as 2  ×  10 − 4 – 2  ×  10 − 3 and 24 – 28  m/s, respectively. The tephra thinning trend in the proximal area shows a steeper slope than in similar-sized magmatic eruptions, indicating a large tephra volume deposited over a short distance owing to the wet dispersal conditions. The Ontake eruption provided an opportunity to examine the deposits from a {{phreatic eruption}} with a complex eruption sequence that reflects the effect of external water on the eruption dynamics.|$|R

40|$|DOE's mission {{under the}} Distributed Energy and Electricity Reliability (DEER) Program is to {{strengthen}} America's electric energy infrastructure and provide utilities and consumers {{with a greater}} array of energy-efficient technology choices for generating, transmitting, distributing, storing, and managing demand for electric power and thermal energy. DOE recognizes that distributed energy technologies can help accomplish this mission. Distributed energy (DE) technologies have received much attention for the potential energy savings and electric power reliability assurances that may be achieved by their widespread adoption. Fueling the attention has been the desire to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and concern about easing power {{transmission and distribution system}} capacity limitations and congestion. However, these benefits may come at a cost to the electric utility companies in terms of lost revenue and other potential impacts on the distribution system. It is important to assess {{the costs and benefits of}} DE to consumers and distribution system companies. DOE commissioned this study to assess the costs and benefits of DE technologies to consumers and to better understand the effect of DE on the grid. Current central power generation <b>units</b> <b>vent</b> more waste heat (energy) than the entire transportation sector consumes and this wasted thermal energy is projected to grow by 45 % within the next 20 years. Consumer investment in technologies that increase power generation efficiency is a key element of the DOE Energy Efficiency program. The program aims to increase overall cycle efficiency from 30 % to 70 % within 20 years as well. DOE wants to determine the impact of DE in several small areas within cities across the U. S. Ann Arbor, Michigan, was chosen as the city for this case study. Ann Arbor has electric and gas rates that can substantially affect the market penetration of DE. This case study analysis was intended to: (1) Determine what DE market penetration can realistically be expected, based on consumer investment in combined heat and power systems (CHP) and the effect of utility applied demand response (DR). (2) Evaluate and quantify the impact on the distribution utility feeder from the perspective of customer ownership of the DE equipment. (3) Determine the distribution feeder limits and the impact DE may have on future growth. For the case study, the Gas Technology Institute analyzed a single 16 -megawatt grid feeder circuit in Ann Arbor, Michigan to determine whether there are economic incentives to use small distributed power generation systems that would offset the need to increase grid circuit capacity. Increasing circuit capacity would enable the circuit to meet consumer's energy demands at all times, but it would not improve the circuit's utilization factor. The analysis spans 12 years, to a planning horizon of 2015. By 2015, the demand for power is expected to exceed the grid circuit capacity for a significant portion of the year. The analysis was to determine whether economically acceptable implementation of customer-owned DE systems would reduce the peak power demands enough to forestall the need to upgrade the capacity of the grid circuit. The analysis was based on economics and gave no financial credit for improved power reliability or mitigation of environmental impacts. Before this study was completed, the utility expanded the capacity of the circuit to 22 MW. Although this expansion will enable the circuit to meet foreseeable increases in peak demand, it also will significantly decrease the circuit's overall utilization factor. The study revealed that DE penetration on the selected feeder is not expected to forestall the need to upgrade the grid circuit capacity unless interconnection barriers are removed. Currently, a variety of technical, business practice, and regulatory barriers discourage DE interconnection in the US market...|$|R
