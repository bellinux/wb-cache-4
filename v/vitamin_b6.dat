5|$|As {{an example}} of Curcubita, raw summer squash is 94% water, 3% carbohydrates, and 1% protein, with {{negligible}} fat content (table). In 100 grams, raw squash supplies 16 calories and is rich in vitamin C (20% of the Daily Value, DV), moderate in <b>vitamin</b> <b>B6</b> and riboflavin (12–17% DV), but otherwise devoid of appreciable nutrient content (table), although the nutrient content of different Curcubita species may vary somewhat.|$|E
5|$|The carrot {{gets its}} characteristic, bright orange colour from β-carotene, and lesser amounts of α-carotene, γ-carotene, lutein and zeaxanthin. α- and β-carotenes are partly metabolized into vitamin A, {{providing}} more than 100% of the Daily Value (DV) per 100 g serving of carrots (right table).

5|$|Bone marrow suppression, {{characterized}} {{particularly by}} thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), may occur during linezolid treatment; {{it appears to}} be the only adverse effect that occurs significantly more frequently with linezolid than with glycopeptides or beta-lactams. It is uncommon in patients who receive the drug for 14 days or fewer, but occurs much more frequently in patients who receive longer courses or who have renal failure. A 2004 case report suggested that pyridoxine (a form of <b>vitamin</b> <b>B6)</b> could reverse the anemia and thrombocytopenia caused by linezolid, but a later, larger study found no protective effect.|$|E
5|$|The carrot is a {{biennial}} {{plant in}} the umbellifer family Apiaceae. At first, it grows a rosette of leaves while building up the enlarged taproot. Fast-growing cultivars mature within three months (90 days) of sowing the seed, while slower-maturing cultivars are harvested four months later (120 days). The roots contain high quantities of alpha- and beta-carotene, and are {{a good source of}} vitamin K and <b>vitamin</b> <b>B6,</b> but the belief that eating carrots improves night vision is a myth put forward by the British in World War II to mislead the enemy about their military capabilities.|$|E
5|$|Pyridoxine, {{also known}} as <b>vitamin</b> <b>B6,</b> {{can be used to}} {{counteract}} the inhibition by MMH on the pyridoxine-dependent step in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter GABA. Thus GABA synthesis can continue and symptoms are relieved. Pyridoxine, which is only useful for the neurological symptoms and does not decrease hepatic toxicity, is given at a dose of 25mg/kg; this can be repeated up to a maximum total of 15 to 30g daily if symptoms do not improve. Benzodiazepines are given to control seizures; as they also modulate GABA receptors they may potentially increase the effect of pyridoxine. Additionally MMH inhibits the chemical transformation of folic acid into its active form, folinic acid, this can be treated by folinic acid given at 20–200mg daily.|$|E

25|$|The {{link between}} levels of folate and altered mental {{function}} is not large, but is sufficient enough {{to suggest a}} causal association. Deficiency in folate can cause an elevation of homocysteine within the blood, as the clearance of homocysteine requires enzymatic action dependent on folate, {{and to a lesser}} extent, <b>vitamins</b> <b>B6</b> and B12. Elevated homocysteine has been associated with increased risk of vascular events, as well as dementia.|$|R
5000|$|Deficiencies of <b>vitamins</b> <b>B6,</b> B9, and B12 {{can lead}} to high {{homocysteine}} levels. Vitamin B12, or cobalamin, acts as a cofactor for the enzyme methionine synthase (which forms part of the S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) biosynthesis and regeneration cycle). Vitamin B12 deficiency prevents the 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) form of folate from being converted into THF due to the [...] "methyl trap". This disrupts the folate pathway and leads {{to an increase in}} homocysteine which damages cells (for example, damage to endothelial cells can result in increased risk of thrombosis).|$|R

50|$|Although {{numerous}} cellular {{mechanisms are}} involved in food intake, many investigations over the past decades have pointed out defects in the methionine metabolic pathway as cause of carcinogenesis. For instance, deficiencies of the main dietary sources of methyl donors, methionine and choline, lead {{to the formation of}} liver cancer in rodents. Methionine is an essential amino acid that must be provided by dietary intake of proteins or methyl donors (choline and betaine found in beef, eggs and some vegetables). Assimilated methionine is transformed in S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) which is a key metabolite for polyamine synthesis, e.g. spermidine, and cysteine formation (see the figure on the right). Methionine breakdown products are also recycled back into methionine by homocysteine remethylation and methylthioadenosine (MTA) conversion (see the figure on the right). <b>Vitamins</b> <b>B6,</b> B12, folic acid and choline are essential cofactors for these reactions. SAM is the substrate for methylation reactions catalyzed by DNA, RNA and protein methyltransferases. The products of these reactions are methylated DNA, RNA or proteins and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). SAH has a negative feedback on its own production as an inhibitor of methyltransferase enzymes. Therefore, SAM:SAH ratio directly regulates cellular methylation, whereas levels of <b>vitamins</b> <b>B6,</b> B12, folic acid and choline regulates indirectly the methylation state via the methionine metabolism cycle. A near ubiquitous feature of cancer is a maladaption of the methionine metabolic pathway in response to genetic or environmental conditions resulting in depletion of SAM and/or SAM-dependent methylation. Whether it is deficiency in enzymes such as methylthioadenosine phosphorylase, methionine-dependency of cancer cells, high levels of polyamine synthesis in cancer, or induction of cancer through a diet deprived of extrinsic methyl donors or enhanced in methylation inhibitors, tumor formation is strongly correlated with a decrease in levels of SAM in mice, rats and humans.|$|R

50|$|In 1999, Metabolite sued LabCorp for {{infringement}} of {{a patent}} covering a diagnostic test. The claims of Metabolite's patent include {{the correlation between}} levels of homocysteine and <b>vitamins</b> <b>B6</b> and B12. A jury ordered LabCorp to pay $4.7 million in damages and the decision was upheld by a federal court, which further stated that doctors were 'directly infringing' Metabolite's patents each time such a test is ordered and interpreted. LabCorp argued that the correlation is a principle of nature, and therefore the patent should never have been granted. The court dismissed the case, although Justice Breyer, Justice Stevens, and Justice Souter dissented from this decision. Breyer's dissenting opinion cited numerous cases in which scientific and mathematical principles had been held to be patent ineligible, including O'Reilly v. Morse and Gottschalk v. Benson..|$|R
50|$|Natto has a {{different}} nutritional makeup from raw soy beans, losing Vitamin A and several other vitamins and minerals. The calorie content of natto is {{lower than that of}} raw soy beans, however. While soy beans are highly nutritious, the nutrition is packed in the bean's hard fiber. Natto includes the benefits of nutritious soy and softer dietary fiber without the high sodium content present in many other soy products, notably in miso. Natto contains no cholesterol and is a significant source of iron, calcium, magnesium, protein, potassium, <b>vitamins</b> <b>B6,</b> B2, E, K2, and more. When Natto is mixed with egg and eaten with rice, Japanese call the dish a perfectly nutritious meal, covering all nutritional needs. Natto is the richest food source of natural K2.
