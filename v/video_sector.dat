50|$|Screen Digest {{was founded}} in 1971 by {{journalist}} and documentary film-maker John Chittock, then film and video correspondent of the Financial Times, together with his business partner and wife Joy Chittock. Initially it was a news digest containing abstracts {{of a range of}} media, including film and cinema, television and in particular the nascent <b>video</b> <b>sector</b> and with editorial emphasis on the relevance and brevity of stories.|$|E
5000|$|As {{video art}} became more {{established}} throughout the 1980s LVA changed {{to accommodate the}} different concerns which emerged across the decade. The phenomenon of Scratch video, for example, {{and the rise of}} the music video and cheaper and more available video [...] "camcorder" [...] technology produced a different aesthetic less connected to the modernist concern for medium specificity which first characterised video. In 1988, after some disagreements with John Cleese’s video production company (Video Arts) over company names, LVA became London Video Access, and indeed its production facilities were in great demand at the expense of its distribution library during this period, showing a shift towards broadcast and the independent <b>video</b> <b>sector</b> and away from the arts. By 1994 another change of title to London Electronic Arts reflected developments in video technology towards a more dispersed digital media and again reasserted the artist led nature of the organisation. A further move to Lottery funded premises at the Lux Centre in 1996 also provided a purpose built gallery space to accompany distribution and production facilities. Under the pressure of funding cuts, and perhaps also determined by the increasingly blurred distinctions which now existed between video and other moving image media, LEA merged with the London Film-Makers' Co-op with whom it shared a venue under the collective name of the Lux Centre, continuing until the eventual demise of the Centre in 2001. Its extensive library of video tapes, attesting to the rich history of British and international video art which LVA first helped to promote, continues to find distribution through LUX, as do many of the artists originally involved.|$|E
40|$|Online video {{has grown}} rapidly in recent years. One in five Australians (14 years and over) {{reported}} viewing online video via a PC 2 ̆ 7 {{in the last}} four weeks 2 ̆ 7 in 2010, nearly double the figure in 2008, according to Roy Morgan. Other researchers estimate much higher proportions but of different groups. Across the whole population, Australians have been adding new screen activities to old ones. Australians get audiovisual stories online in many ways and from many places. Different types of online video service based in Australia and overseas use different delivery systems and retail business models to deliver many kinds of content. Measuring use of these services requires different tools that are not easy to reconcile and are being constantly developed by research companies. This makes analysis of the online <b>video</b> <b>sector,</b> at this stage of its evolution, more complex than other distribution sectors like cinema, television and DVD, where there is more consensus about what and how to measure, and what the metrics mean. This project concentrates on websites. Our primary measurement tool was Nielsen NetView. NetView provides data on the frequency and duration of access to particular URLs. The Interactive Advertising Bureau of Australia [IAB] appointed the Nielsen Company as the sole and exclusive preferred supplier of online audience measurement services in Australia in May 2011. In October 2011, Nielsen began releasing data using a new hybrid methodology, known as Nielsen Online Ratings. We also received some data about traffic to the ABC 2 ̆ 7 s websites and catch-up TV service collected by WebTrends, some data and analysis on the frequency and duration of access to particular URLs from Experian Hitwise, and gathered information from secondary sources about other places where Australians go for audiovisual stories. This project identified 25 sites for detailed analysis. Three main measures were used to analyse the selected 25 sites: (1) the size of the 2 ̆ 7 unique Australian audience 2 ̆ 7 visiting each site each month; (2) the total amount of time (2 ̆ 7 total minutes 2 ̆ 7) spent on each site by these visitors; and (3) the average time spent on the site per visitor. This data was obtained for the months June 2010 to June 2011. Demographic data was also supplied for the month of June 2011...|$|E

40|$|A concise {{account that}} {{supplements}} topics only briefly mentioned in other {{contributions to the}} anthology Other Cinemas, this piece provides a factual overview of the establishment and early context surrounding the fourth British terrestrial television channel, Channel 4 (C 4), which started broadcasting in 1982. With its dedicated ‘Independent Film and Video Department’, C 4 opened air-time to more diverse content through its alternative model, which, rather than making programmes in-house, operated as a ‘publisher-broadcaster’ by buying-in and commissioning work. Developed following a series of interviews/conversations between Holdsworth and former deputy Commissioning Editor at the Channel, Professor Rod Stoneman (National University of Ireland, Galway) this co-authored overview (1, 300 words) observes how the Channel’s initial founding remit stemmed from an ethos towards innovation that owed much to the experimental ‘independent’ and ‘workshop’ artistic film and <b>video</b> <b>sectors</b> that emerged in 1970 s Britain. This chapter is supplemented by two contributions to the book (a chapter on the IFA and another short section on the Workshop Declaration) {{as well as a}} chronology (all written by Holdsworth) ...|$|R

Do they enable this industry to confront the multitude of instabilities it faces?

40|$|The movie business, and the {{distribution}} of films through the associated cinema and home <b>video</b> <b>sectors</b> is a truly global phenomenon. In terms of both production and distribution, Hollywood has traditionally dominated international markets, however, with radical innovations in information and digital technologies and the spread of the Internet, it has become increasingly easier to make and distribute films around the world. Coupled with this is the ‘runaway production’ concept, whereby Hollywood productions are no longer tied to site-specific studios and can choose to shoot and edit their (usually high-budget) movies in locations around the globe. This has created an international market where cities, such as Vancouver, Sydney, Brisbane, Prague, Cape Town, London and many more, compete for big movie business. London has a thriving film and video sub-sector and a highly competitive infrastructure, nurtured by a host of supporting institutions, which together create a powerful creative network of players capable of competing at a global scale. The physical geography of the city also matters to the film industry, {{not only in terms of}} shooting locations, but also in determining where to locate, pitch or exhibit the final creative product. Consequently, the location and interconnected value chain of producers, post-production, financiers, sales agents and distributors, cinemas and theatres, as well as the myriad of specialised and highly skilled workforce is key to the industry’s success. The co-location and clustering tendencies of individuals and institutions located at close proximity in London and highlighted in this report are evidence of the intense social networking that characterises the industry...|$|R

Thus, political and industrial factors offer an explanation as to why clusters emerge and how they evolve, going beyond the purely geographic or economic factors.
