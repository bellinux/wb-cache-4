5000|$|Work until 1964: The {{paintings}} from 1959-1964 begin representational and then become more abstract. The dealing with various materials {{was a major}} focus in these early works. Examples of this are several sand {{paintings from}} this period. Mike Rose used Sand, <b>varnish</b> <b>paint,</b> and oil paint squeezed out of the tube. However, paper, textiles and canvas of varying coarseness were also used. In 1964 came the transition from collages to “script paintings”.|$|E

Many <b>varnishes</b> and <b>paints</b> are well known emitters of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), {{some of which may}} be acidic, and thus have the potential to damage calcium carbonate specimens.

Foaming problem was negligible when the mixture with φ; 20 % of the industrial wastewater and j = 80 % of the municipal wastewater was treated. With the operational cycle of 6 h with anoxic (non-aerated) and aerobic (aerated) phase the required effluent quality was obtained according to regulations for treated wastewater that flows into the recipient.

40|$|The Kauri Gum Industry {{has played}} an {{important}} part in the development of Northland for more than one hundred years. Kauri gum was valued for its use in the manufacture of <b>varnish,</b> <b>paint</b> and linoleum, and it is sought after today primarily for its ornamental qualities. For the most part the old Gumfields where the diggers roamed at will have vanished, being converted into fertile farm land; the Ahipara Gumfields are an exception; here little development has taken place. The Historic Reserve area has been modified by machine washing and sluicing, leaving permanent scars in the landscape where the topsoil has been washed away, these workings are from the later period of gumdigging about 1930 onwards, however, in parts the ground is pockmarked with shallow holes where earlier generations of gumdiggers have left their mark. The surrounding Crown Land on this plateau south of Ahipara is partly covered in stunted scrub where frequent fires occur, pockets of bush survive in the gullies and sandhills stretch from Tuaroa Peak 201 metres down to the sea, the area as a whole having an atmosphere of true wilderness...|$|E

50|$|Butanone is an {{effective}} and common solvent and is used in processes involving gums, resins, cellulose acetate and nitrocellulose coatings and in vinyl films. For this reason it finds use {{in the manufacture of}} plastics, textiles, in the production of paraffin wax, and in household products such as lacquer, <b>varnishes,</b> <b>paint</b> remover, a denaturing agent for denatured alcohol, glues, and as a cleaning agent. It has similar solvent properties to acetone but boils at a higher temperature and has a significantly slower evaporation rate. Unlike acetone, it forms an azeotrope with water, making it useful for azeotropic distillation of moisture in certain applications. Butanone is also used in dry erase markers as the solvent of the erasable dye.|$|R
5000|$|The {{larval stage}} is {{responsible}} for nearly all {{the damage done by}} the beetle. They feed on many of the various hardwoods used in wood paneling, door and window frames, furniture, baskets, hardwood trim and flooring in homes. Only sapwood is attacked.

[...] Subfloors, joists and rafters are usually made of pine or other softwood and generally escape infestation.
