Working under a NASA contract for U.S. DOE's Division of Automotive Technology Development, Williams Research performed the design and analysis on the gas turbine engine, while AMC's AM General subsidiary did the vehicle installation studies, supplied the <b>vehicle,</b> <b>transmission,</b> drivetrain, and the typical car accessories. The two-door sedan used a dual-rotor gas turbine with variable power turbine nozzle, and a 3-speed automatic transmission for conventional rear-wheel-drive. Williams Research conducted all the performance and fuel economy analysis, with the turbine powered Concord meeting expectations. The final report estimated that the IGT vehicle would have a 10% higher cost over the conventional piston engine, of which {{less than half of}} the cost penalty would be in the turbine engine, but the remainder would be the cost of adapting existing production of vehicles and systems. However, fuel economy improvements, as well as reduced maintenance and repairs, would result in an overall life-cycle cost saving of 9% for the IGT vehicle.|$|E

50|$|VASCAR {{relies on}} the {{accuracy}} of the patrol vehicle's speedometer drive (generally located within the <b>vehicle</b> <b>transmission)</b> for determining the distance traveled, using an odometer within the VASCAR system itself. Recently-purchased law enforcement vehicles generally have electronic speedometers, and a sensor wire is connected to the speed-sensor feed wire to count the pulses from the drive. Older vehicles, with cable-driven speedometers, are connected to the VASCAR unit with a mechanical-optical adapter which attaches to the cable. Pulses are counted the same way for both input methods.|$|E
50|$|An {{automatic}} transmission, {{also called}} auto, self-shifting transmission, n-speed automatic (where n is its number of forward gear ratios), or AT, {{is a type}} of motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>transmission</b> that can automatically change gear ratios as the vehicle moves, freeing the driver from having to shift gears manually. Like other transmission systems on vehicles, it allows an internal combustion engine, best suited to run at a relatively high rotational speed, to provide a range of speed and torque outputs necessary for vehicular travel. The number of forward gear ratios is often expressed for manual transmissions as well (e.g., 6-speed manual).|$|E
50|$|Power for the C4 was {{provided}} by the same unit used in the CS, a 1003 cc four-cylinder engine (two valves per cylinder) with a 58.0 mm bore, a 95.0 mm stroke, a magneto ignition AND Solex carburetor; it was rated at 22 KW at 2800 rpm. The <b>vehicle</b> <b>transmission</b> (which was also used in the CC and CS models, the only difference being the longer length of the gearshift levers, necessitated by the longer chassis) provided three speeds, with power being sent to the rear wheels (a differential was not used on the rear-wheel power distribution scheme until the 1925 model, however). The suspension used semi-elliptic leaf springs in both the front and rear as well as fitted friction type dampers.|$|E

50|$|A PTO {{or power}} {{take-off}} unit {{has the same}} driven components as a petrol or diesel driven unit except that the unit takes mechanical power from the vehicles engine via a specially fitted power take off unit which is usually fitted to the <b>vehicle</b> <b>transmission.</b> The power is usually transmitted via a drive shaft or hydraulic pump and motor. Heating the solution is either by a vehicle exhaust heat exchanger, coolant heater or LPG fired heater. The advantage is quieter running and lighter weight in addition to not having to maintain a second engine. The disadvantages are putting extra running hours on the vehicle engine and transmission. The PTO system is also usually vehicle specific so transferring the truckmount to another make or model of vehicle will require a new PTO system to be fitted.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} upgrade the <b>vehicle</b> <b>transmission</b> {{elements}} in terms of reducing their size and weight and simultaneous achieving required level of reliability the contemporary design of these elements is based on real stochastic nature of working and critical stresses as design basic values. Consequently, working and critical stresses are considered as random variables with distribution at appropriate intervals of dispersion where different values of working and critical stresses find different appearance probabilities. Therefore, reliability evaluation of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>transmission</b> elements is made {{on the base of}} probability where working stresses are lower than critical ones. In that respect, this paper deals with the influence of road conditions on reliability of the <b>vehicle</b> <b>transmission</b> elements highlighting of the driving shafts with different diameters...|$|E
