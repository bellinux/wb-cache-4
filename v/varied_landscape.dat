5|$|In much of {{the area}} {{bordering}} the wetlands, an abundance of produce, of great variety, can be cultivated. The green and <b>varied</b> <b>landscape</b> provides good grazing for livestock. In some areas the carboniferous limestone and the Dolomitic Conglomerate have been mineralised with lead and zinc ores. Evidence of early settlement comes from the Sweet Track, which was built from timber felled {{in the winter of}} 3807–06 BC, and lowland villages such as Glastonbury Lake Village and hill forts and ancient settlements on hills, many of which date from the Iron Age. From the time of the Romans until 1908, the Mendip Hills were an important source of lead.|$|E
5|$|Dorset has a <b>varied</b> <b>landscape</b> {{featuring}} broad elevated chalk downs, steep limestone {{ridges and}} low-lying clay valleys. Over half {{the county is}} designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Three-quarters of its coastline {{is part of the}} Jurassic Coast Natural World Heritage Site due to its geological and palaeontologic significance. It features notable landforms such as Lulworth Cove, the Isle of Portland, Chesil Beach and Durdle Door. Agriculture was traditionally the major industry of Dorset but is now in decline and tourism has become increasingly important to the economy. There are no motorways in Dorset but a network of A roads cross the county and two railway main lines connect to London. Dorset has ports at Poole, Weymouth and Portland, and an international airport. The county has a variety of museums, theatres and festivals, and is host to one of Europe's largest outdoor shows. It is the birthplace of Thomas Hardy, who used the county as the principal setting of his novels, and William Barnes, whose poetry celebrates the ancient Dorset dialect.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of Flight Unlimited in 1995, project leader Seamus Blackley planned to use that game's computational fluid dynamics (CFDs) code to create a combat flight simulator called Flight Combat. However, a new manager at Looking Glass Studios demanded that Blackley instead design a direct sequel to Flight Unlimited. Blackley refused and was fired, leaving the company in late 1995. Constantine Hantzopoulos became the lead designer and project leader of the fourteen-member Flight Unlimited II team. The team eschewed the aerobatics focus of their previous game in favor of general civilian aviation, in order {{to compete with the}} Microsoft Flight Simulator series. Looking Glass announced the game on December 18, 1996. It was slated to include 6 planes, 45 airports and 8,500 square miles of terrain from the San Francisco Bay Area. The Bay Area was chosen because of its <b>varied</b> <b>landscape</b> and numerous airports. In January 1997, Eidos Interactive partnered with Looking Glass to provide the game's marketing and distribution.|$|E

25|$|From the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, visual arts in Israel have shown a creative orientation, influenced both by the West and East, {{as well as by the}} land itself, its development, the character of the cities, and stylistic trends emanating from art centers abroad. In painting, sculpture, photography, and other art forms, the country's <b>varied</b> <b>landscape</b> is the protagonist: the hill terraces and ridges produce special dynamics of line and shape; the foothills of the Negev, the prevailing grayish-green vegetation, and the clear luminous light result in distinctive color effects; and the sea and sand affect surfaces. On the whole, local landscapes, concerns, and politics lie at the center of Israeli art, and ensure its uniqueness.|$|E

500|$|Eric Neigher of 1UP.com {{praised the}} game's texture, draw distance, {{depth of field}} and variety, writing that such details made the game feel more alive. The explosions were praised for their visual effects. According to Neigher, the <b>varied</b> <b>landscape</b> and the {{grappling}} hook made Just Cause 2 game world superior to those of Grand Theft Auto and Infamous. Eurogamer Simon Parkin commended Avalanche Studios for developing a [...] "picture-postcard amalgam of Pacific landscapes" [...] without significant technical difficulties, such as framework instability. However, Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot and Ryan Clements of IGN noted a number of gameplay problems, such as loose shooting mechanic and technical glitches. Jeff Marchiafava of Game Informer considered its world {{one of the most}} enjoyable and entertaining sandboxes for players to explore, overshadowing other open-world games with urban settings.|$|E
500|$|Writing in 1862, Benjamin Clarje {{considered}} {{the park to}} exhibit [...] "perhaps a richer display of <b>varied</b> <b>landscape</b> than any spot of similar size in the kingdom". He notes that the surface in the upper area of the park is [...] "diversified by gentle undulations and has been planted with great judgment and taste" [...] and that the River Towy flows in the vicinity. The Wildlife Trust West Wales acquired the nearby woodland in 1979. The BBC's Peter Crawford wrote of it in his book, The Living Isles: [...] "The woodland is primarily oak and wych elm," [...] he writes. [...] "The shrubs and ground cover are outstanding with cherry, holly, spindle, dog violet and the parasitic toothwort. Lichen communities are of importance and include the rare lungwort. Overlooked by the romantic Castle of Dinefwr the fine old parkland has a herd of fallow deer. The mature trees attract woodpecker, redstarts and pied flycatchers. In winter, the water meadows draw large numbers of ducks".|$|E
500|$|Following {{the release}} of Flight Unlimited II in 1997, certain members of that game's team wanted {{to move on to}} Flight Unlimited III, while others wanted to create the combat flight {{simulator}} game Flight Combat. Looking Glass Studios chose to develop the games simultaneously: the team was split into two, both supplemented with new hires. The company then surveyed customers to determine where Flight Unlimited III should take place, among other things. In May 1998, Electronic Arts was announced as the game's publisher, as part of a multi-title marketing and distribution deal that also included System Shock 2. Looking Glass's goal was to build on the foundation of Flight Unlimited II and to provide what project leader Tom Sperry called [...] "the true joy and sensation of flight in the most realistic environment available". The company first displayed Flight Unlimited III at the MicroWINGS Conference in August 1998. At the show, the game was revealed to take place in and around Seattle—a choice based on fan requests and on the <b>varied</b> <b>landscape</b> and weather of Puget Sound. Looking Glass also discussed new planes, moving objects on the ground and a real-time, physics-based weather system.|$|E
