40|$|See the {{editorial}} commentary by Walsh and Rex on pages 600 – 2) The removal of all central venous catheters (CVCs) from all patients with candidemia {{is considered to}} be standard care. However, this practice is not always possible, and it is associated with significant cost and potential complications. To evaluate the effect of CVC removal on the outcome of patients with candidemia, a literature review was conducted that selected studies that evaluated CVC removal as a prognostic factor (of mortality) in candidemia, performed a multivariate analysis with odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals, and included a validated severity of illness score. Of 203 studies of candidemia, only 4 fulfilled these criteria. One study showed a benefit from CVC removal in a subset of 21 neutropenic patients; another study showed no benefit; and the remaining 2 studies showed a marginal benefit from this strategy. Although it is possible that removal of CVCs may reduce the rate of complications due to candidemia, including death, the findings of this literature review do not substantiate this consensus recommendation. <b>Vascular</b> <b>catheters</b> have been associated with candide-mia, both as risk and prognostic factors [1 – 5].

We performed a retrospective case-control study to characterize the epidemiology, microbiology, and outcomes of hemodialysis-associated candidemia. All cases of candidemia at our institution were evaluated from 1 January 2000 until 1 September 2004. For each case, two non-candidemic dialysis patients served as controls. Among 350 cases of candidemia, 78 (22 %) occurred in adult hemodialysis patients. Cases and controls were similar with respect to age, corticosteroid, antibiotics use, prevalence of diabetes mellitus, liver cirrhosis, surgical procedures, and cancer.

However, a proportion of patients with catheter tips colonized by S. aureus have no blood cultures taken because of low suspicion of sepsis {{and the meaning of}} this microbiological finding is unknown. We have analysed all catheter tips growing S. aureus during a 6 -year period and have selected patients without blood cultures taken 7 days before or after central <b>vascular</b> <b>catheter</b> removal. Patient's evolution was classified into good and poor outcome. Poor outcome was defined as S. aureus infection within 3 months after catheter withdrawal or death in the same period with no obvious cause. Patients with good and poor outcomes were compared to assess whether antimicrobial therapy influenced evolution. Sixty-seven patients fulfilled our inclusion criteria and five (7. 4 %) had a poor outcome. The administration of early anti-staphylococcal therapy had no impact on the outcome of this population (p 0. 99). The only factor independently associated with a poor outcome was the presence of clinical signs of sepsis when the catheter was removed (OR 20. 8; 95 % CI 2. 0 - 206. 1; p 0. 009). Our data suggest that patients with central <b>vascular</b> <b>catheter</b> tips colonized with S. aureus should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of ongoing infection, but if these are not present then antimicrobial therapy does not seem justified...|$|E
