25|$|Epazote {{essential}} oil contains ascaridole (up to 70%), limonene, p-cymene, and smaller amounts of numerous other monoterpenes and monoterpene derivatives (α-pinene, myrcene, terpinene, thymol, camphor and trans-isocarveol). Ascaridole (1,4-peroxido-p-menth-2-ene) is rather an uncommon constituent of spices; another plant owing {{much of its}} character to this monoterpene peroxide is boldo. Ascaridole is toxic and has a pungent, not <b>very</b> <b>pleasant</b> flavor; in pure form, it is an explosive sensitive to shock. Ascaridole content is lower in epazote from Mexico than in epazote grown in Europe or Asia.|$|E

25|$|Flexible {{keyboards}} are a junction between normal {{type and}} laptop type keyboards: normal from the full arrangement of keys, and laptop from the short key distance. Additionally, the flexibility allows {{the user to}} fold/roll the keyboard for better storage and transfer. However, for typing the keyboard must be resting on a hard surface. The vast majority of flexible keyboards in the market are made from silicone; this material makes them water and dust proof, a <b>very</b> <b>pleasant</b> feature especially in hospitals where keyboards are subjected to frequent washing. For connection with the computer the keyboards use a USB cable, and operating system support reaches {{as far back as}} Windows 2000.|$|E
500|$|Erlewine gave a three-and-a-half star rating, {{saying that}} Stegall's {{production}} {{gave it a}} more traditional sound in comparison to A Few Questions, and that, despite having some [...] "sappy" [...] songs, it was his [...] "most enjoyable collection in some time." [...] Engine 145 reviewer Brady Vercher rated it three stars out of five, praising Walker's vocal performance but saying that the song selection [...] "seemed to be lacking in everything but fluff." [...] Country Standard Time reviewer Jeffrey B. Remz wrote that Walker showed [...] "a <b>very</b> <b>pleasant</b> country voice with {{a good sense of}} emotion" [...] and that the production was more country-sounding than most mainstream acts, but said that it had several [...] "generic" [...] songs.|$|E
500|$|The first European land {{exploration}} of Alta California, the Spanish Portolá expedition, passed this way {{on its way}} north, camping at San Juan Creek on July 23, 1769. Franciscan missionary Juan Crespi noted in his diary: [...] "...we came to a <b>very</b> <b>pleasant</b> green valley, full of willows, alders, live oaks, and other trees not known to us. It has a large arroyo, which {{at the point where}} we crossed it carried a good stream of fresh and good water, which, after running a little way, formed in pools in some large patches of tules." [...] On the return journey to San Diego, the party used the campsite again, on January 20.|$|E

Miles is often shown consuming large amounts of food on-screen. Miles enjoys his food because of his time spent living hungry on the streets. This was a character choice made by Quong Tart. He {{thought it was important}} that viewers see his eating habits, staying true to [...] "representing human beings." [...] However, Quong Tart stated that it sometimes reached a [...] "point where it might not be <b>very</b> <b>pleasant</b> to watch." [...] Viewers had written letters to Quong Tart requesting that Miles should stop [...] "pigging out on television." ...|$|E
500|$|Samuel Pepys {{visited the}} house in 1665 and noted some of its features, {{particularly}} the busts of Charles I, Lord Essex and Lord Fairfax and described the house as [...] "a <b>very</b> <b>pleasant</b> place". He visited the house twice to collect money on behalf of Charles II from Sir Robert Vyner who was a well-known goldsmith. On one occasion, Sir Robert showed Pepys {{the body of a}} black boy who had worked at the house and died of tuberculosis. The body had been dried in an oven and kept in an open coffin and was then displayed to visitors. Sir Robert later became Lord Mayor of London in 1674. After the house became empty in 1923, workmen unsealed a cupboard near the servants' quarters where it was believed the body was stored, though they found no trace of it.|$|E
500|$|At Bahía Blanca, in the {{southern}} part of present Buenos Aires Province, Darwin rode inland into Patagonia with gauchos: he saw them use bolas to bring down [...] "ostriches" [...] (rheas), and ate roast armadillo. With FitzRoy, he went for [...] "a <b>very</b> <b>pleasant</b> cruize about the bay" [...] on 22 September, and about [...] from the ship they stopped for a while at Punta Alta. In low cliffs near the point Darwin found conglomerate rocks containing numerous shells and fossilised teeth and bones of gigantic extinct mammals, in strata near an earth layer with shells and armadillo fossils, suggesting to him quiet tidal deposits rather than a catastrophe. With assistance (possibly including the young sailor Syms Covington acting as his servant) Darwin collected numerous fossils over several days, amusing others with [...] "the cargoes of apparent rubbish which he frequently brought on board".|$|E

500|$|Kelsey Grammer {{initially}} expected Sideshow Bob to be {{a one-time}} role, and calls him [...] "the most popular character I've ever played". Grammer usually joins the show's [...] "table readings" [...] (wherein cast members read each script {{together for the}} first time), and former executive producer David Mirkin described working with Grammer as <b>very</b> <b>pleasant,</b> due to his lively sense of humor. Grammer, Mirkin says, is capable of perfect readings, but noted that the actor dislikes performing Sideshow Bob's evil laugh. In a 2007 interview, Simpsons executive producer Al Jean listed Grammer as one of his favorite guest stars (second only to Phil Hartman), saying [...] "his voice is so rich." [...] Writer George Meyer commented that [...] "writing for Kelsey is great, he can give the kind of purple, florid, melodramatic speeches that most of the characters would never give. And he can sing." ...|$|E
500|$|Henry's {{garden was}} very ornately decorated, as 16th-century {{visitors}} noted. The Spanish Duke of Nájera wrote of a visit in 1544 {{in which he}} saw [...] "a <b>very</b> <b>pleasant</b> garden with great walks and avenues in all directions, containing many sculptures of men and women, children and birds and monsters, and other strange figures in low and high relief." [...] Von Wedel recorded in 1584 that in the garden were [...] "thirty-four high columns, covered with various fine paintings; also different animals carved in wood, with their horns gilt, are set {{on the top of}} the columns, together with flags bearing the queen's arms. In the middle of the garden is a nice fountain with a remarkable sun-dial, showing the time in thirty different ways. Between the spaces that are planted in the garden there are fine walks grown with grass, and the spaces are planted very artistically, surrounded by plants in the shape of seats." ...|$|E
500|$|Andy confronts Dwight and {{challenges}} {{him to a}} [...] "duel" [...] in the parking lot, with Angela as a prize to the winner. Dwight accepts and Angela, anxious to avoid making a choice {{between the two men}} herself, says she will honor the results of the duel. Jim, acting as office manager in Michael's absence, tries to talk them out of the duel and confiscates Dwight's hidden weapons around the office, but concedes he does not have the power to prevent a fight outside the office. Meanwhile in New York, Michael is nervous about why David Wallace wants to meet with him. But as the meeting begins, David tells him Scranton is the most successful Dunder Mifflin branch amid a difficult economic climate, and he wants to learn why Michael's management has been so successful. Michael is delighted with the compliment and attention, but can only manage vague, off-topic and largely nonsensical answers. David claims it is difficult for someone to make a self-evaluation, and Michael leaves the meeting in a <b>very</b> <b>pleasant</b> mood.|$|E

500|$|White Zombie {{was filmed}} in eleven days in March 1932 and {{was shot at}} the Universal Studios lot and Bronson Canyon on such a small budget {{that it had to}} film at night. Other than Béla Lugosi and Joseph Cawthorn, the {{majority}} of the cast in White Zombie were actors whose fame had diminished since the silent film era. By the time Lugosi appeared in White Zombie, he was already popular with contemporary audiences after his starring role in the hit 1931 film, Dracula. Sources vary about Lugosi's salary for White Zombie. Claims range between US$500 to $900. Richard Sheffield, who was his close friend in the 1950s, reported a payment of $5,000 for White Zombie on Lugosi's tax returns. The cast and crew's reaction to Lugosi on the set was mixed. Madge Bellamy recalled her collaboration with Lugosi positively, stating that he was <b>very</b> <b>pleasant</b> and that he used to kiss her hand in the morning when they would come on to the set. In contrast, assistant cameraman Enzo Martinelli remarked that [...] "Lugosi wasn't really a friendly type" [...] on set.|$|E
500|$|In 1954 Holloway {{joined the}} Old Vic theatre company to play Bottom in A Midsummer Night's Dream, with Robert Helpmann as Oberon and Moira Shearer as Titania. After {{playing at the}} Edinburgh Festival, the Royal Shakespeare Company took the {{production}} to New York, where it played at the Metropolitan Opera House and then on tour of the US and Canada. The production was harshly reviewed by critics {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic, but Holloway made a strong impression. [...] Holloway said of the experience: [...] "Out of the blue I was asked by the Royal Shakespeare Company to tour America with them, playing Bottom. ... From that American tour came the part of Alfred Doolittle in My Fair Lady and from then on, well, just let's say I was able to pick and choose my parts and that was <b>very</b> <b>pleasant</b> at my age." [...] Holloway's film career continued simultaneously with his stage work; one example was the 1956 comedy Jumping for Joy. [...] American audiences became familiar with his earlier film roles when the films began to be broadcast on television in the 1950s.|$|E
500|$|Darwin's {{views on}} social and {{political}} issues reflected his time and social position. He {{grew up in a}} family of Whig reformers who, like his uncle Josiah Wedgwood, supported electoral reform and the emancipation of slaves. Darwin was passionately opposed to slavery, while seeing no problem with the working conditions of English factory workers or servants. His taxidermy lessons in 1826 from the freed slave John Edmonstone, who he long recalled as [...] "a <b>very</b> <b>pleasant</b> and intelligent man", reinforced his belief that black people shared the same feelings, and could be as intelligent as people of other races. He took the same attitude to native people he met on the Beagle voyage. These attitudes were not unusual in Britain in the 1820s, much as it shocked visiting Americans. British society became more racist in mid century, but Darwin remained strongly against slavery, against [...] "ranking the so-called races of man as distinct species", and against ill-treatment of native people. He valued European civilisation and saw colonisation as spreading its benefits, with the sad but inevitable effect that savage peoples who did not become civilised faced extinction. Darwin's theories presented this as natural, and were cited to promote policies that went against his humanitarian principles.|$|E
