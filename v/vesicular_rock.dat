The conditions of magma transit within the conduit from 2011 to 2012 differ: in 2011, the decompression rate and magma ascent rate of BVR were higher than for BVVR, but, in 2012, the decompression rate and magma ascent rate between BVR and BVVR were similar.

40|$|We have {{measured}} {{the pressures of}} decrepitation of vesicles in synthetic glasses of feldspar compositions (NaAlSi 308 -KAlSi 308). Vesicles filled with Xe do not decrepitate at internal pressures of 160 MPa, indicating that the unflawed surface of the vesicle wall has an intrinsic strength > 80 MPa. Vesicles containing C 02 escaped decrepitation and displayed ductile deformation when the Tg was reached at the maximum P of 200 MPa (indicating an intrinsic strength higher than 100 MPa). Vesicles containing H 20 showed dramatically reduced strength, decrepitating at internal pressures {{on the order of}} 1 - 5 MPa. The H 20 -filled vesicles leaked slowly over periods of several weeks or months. The relative stability of the inclusions is strongly dependent on the quench rate, with rapidly quenched inclusions showing greater stability over long periods of time. Microscopic examination revealed the presence of radial microfractures in the walls of H 20 -filled vesicles. We account for the microfracturing with reference to recent studies of chemical-gradient stress. Our observations may account for a variety of phenomena, which occur wherever hydrous vesicular glasses are formed, including explosive decompression of <b>vesicular</b> glassy <b>rock</b> in near-surface volcanic environments, spontaneous decrepitation of vesicular basaltic glass dredged from the seafloor ("popping rocks"), and rapid loss of H 20 from synthetic vesicular glasses produced in laboratory experiments investigating fluid-melt phase equilibria...|$|R

Both Roter Kamm impact-melt rock samples analyzed to date, as well as several suevite samples, exhibit a granitic-granodioritic precursor composition. Micro-chemical analyses of glassy matrix and Al-rich orthopyroxene microphenocrysts demonstrate rapid cooling and chemical disequilibrium at small scales. Platinum-group element abundances and ratios indicate an ordinary chondritic composition for the Roter Kamm impactor.

We calculate so-called Haralick texture features such as contrast, energy, entropy and homogeneity. The supervised classification method is used for assigning characteristic texture features to different rock classes and assessing the discriminative power of these image features. We use classifiers obtained from training intervals to characterize the entire image data set recovered in ODP hole 1203 A. This yields a synthetic lithology profile based on computed texture data. We show that Haralick features accurately classify 89. 9 % of the training intervals.

40|$|It has {{recently}} been hypothesised that pumice, a low-density <b>vesicular</b> volcanic <b>rock,</b> could have acted as a natural floating laboratory for the accumulation and concentration of chemical reactants needed for the origin of life. To test the plausibility of his hypothesis, we here turn to the earliest rock record for evidence of pumice deposits and their associated mineralogy and biogeochemistry. We report abundant clasts of pumice from within a volcaniclastic breccia bed immediately above the ∼ 3460. Ma 'Apex chert' unit of the Apex Basalt, Pilbara region, Western Australia. Textural and geochemical analyses reveal that the body of these pumice clasts was deeply permeated by intimate associations of C, O, N, P and S. Pumice and scoria vesicles were also lined with carbon or with catalysts such as titanium oxide or potential biominerals such as iron sulfide, while many were infilled with aluminosilicate minerals. The latter may be the metamorphosed remains of potentially catalytic clay and zeolite minerals. It is not yet possible to distinguish between chemical signals left by prokaryote biology from those left by prebiology. That being so, then early prokaryotes may well have colonised and modified these Apex pumice clasts prior to burial. Nevertheless, our data provide the first geological evidence that the catalysts and molecules needed for the earliest stages of life may be found within pumice rafts from the earliest oceans on Earth. © 2012 Elsevier B.

The expansion of agricultural land and the massive establishment of tourist development and road construction in the lower area of the streams increase the damage occurring near the lower area of the streams. To achieve the important integration of Jeju Island’s water resources, a stable water supply from surface water is needed along with preserving and managing of the groundwater.

A land use data from 1975 to 2000 from landsat satellite images provided by the Ministry of Environment and Arcview program was used.

6000|$|Some {{considerable}} {{masses of}} wacke, which {{are associated with}} these basaltic strata, and which likewise occur in the basal series on the coast, especially at Quail Island, are curious. They consist of a pale yellowish- green argillaceous substance, of a crumbling texture when dry, but unctuous when moist: in its purest form, it is of a beautiful green tint, with translucent edges, and occasionally with obscure traces of an original cleavage. Under the blowpipe it fuses very readily into a dark grey, and sometimes even black bead, which is slightly magnetic. From these characters, I naturally {{thought that it was}} one of the pale species, decomposed, of the genus augite;--a conclusion supported by the unaltered rock being full of large separate crystals of black augite, and of balls and irregular streaks of dark grey augitic rock. As the basalt ordinarily consists of augite, and of olivine often tarnished and of a dull red colour, I was led to examine the stages of decomposition of this latter mineral, and I found, to my surprise, that I could trace a nearly perfect gradation from unaltered olivine to the green wacke. Part of the same grain under the blowpipe would in some instances behave like olivine, its colour being only slightly changed, and part would give a black magnetic bead. Hence I can have no doubt that the greenish wacke originally existed as olivine; but great chemical changes must have been effected during the act of decomposition thus to have altered a very hard, transparent, infusible mineral, into a soft, unctuous, easily melted, argillaceous substance. (D'Aubuisson [...] "Traite de Geognosie" [...] tome 2 page 569 mentions, on the authority of M. Marcel de Serres, masses of green earth near Montpellier, which are supposed to be due to the decomposition of olivine. I do not, however, find, that the action of this mineral under the blowpipe being entirely altered, as it becomes decomposed, has been noticed; and the knowledge of this fact is important, as at first it appears highly improbable that a hard, transparent, refractory mineral should be changed into a soft, easily fused clay, like this of St. Jago. I shall hereafter describe a green substance, forming threads within the cells of some <b>vesicular</b> basaltic <b>rocks</b> in Van Diemen's Land, which behave under the blowpipe like the green wacke of St. Jago; but its occurrence in cylindrical threads, shows it cannot have resulted from the decomposition of olivine, a mineral always existing in the form of grains or crystals.) ...|$|R

This study, based on classical modal mineralogy and petrography of samples coming from seven churches (Biet Medhane-Alem, Biet Mariam, Trinity Church, Biet Giyorgis, Biet Amanuel, Biet Abba-Lebanos and Biet Gabriel Rufael), sorts out ambiguous rock-nomenclatures and lithological definitions, which have been found in the literature of the last three decades. We can now affirm that the churches were carved in hydrothermally altered and partially lateritized basaltic scorias (nearly aphyric and highly <b>vesicular).</b> The hewn <b>rock,</b> often reported in literature as “weathered basic tuffs”, can be thus classified as a basaltic scoria deposit, partially welded by syn-post magmatic hydrothermal alteration. Its pyroclastic origin may have strongly enhanced selective weathering. The hewn rock rests on a massive to slightly fractured basalt, still present as bedrock of the Lalibela churches and belonging to lava sequences of the Northern Ethiopian Plateau (continental flood basalts). Despite the severe hydrothermal alteration and partial lateritization of the samples, modal mineralogy, petrography and major-trace elements chemistry strongly suggest that the studied clinopyroxene-olivine transitional basaltic scorias of the churches derive from the same magma type, which gave rise to the Lalibela high-titanium group 2 (HT 2) of the Northern Ethiopian Plateau lava flows. The late-stage and post-magmatic phases (smectites, zeolites and calcite) scattered in the groundmass and filling the large subspherical vesicles of the basaltic scorias really represent a typical hydrothermal facies of continental flood basalts. Most of the secondary hydrothermal minerals are pointed out first, as well as appropriate modal mineralogy and petrography, providing useful insights towards unraveling the causes of deterioration of these world heritage monuments.

40|$|Volcanic eruptions {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{spectacular}} and dangerous natural phenomena. Volcanic activity can either be effusive, dominated by quiescent emission of lava or explosive, dominated by the eruption of pyroclastic material. A rapid transition between these two regimes is possible. possible. On a broad scale, a clear distinction of the eruption style can be drawn by magma composition. Large-scale basaltic eruptions are mostly effusive, whereas large-scale silicic eruptions are mostly explosive. Thus silicic volcanism possesses a severe hazard potential and can have devastating effects on human population. This work comprises experimental investigations of the fragmentation behavior of porous magma as well as of the propagation of elastic waves within this material. The analyses were conducted on samples from Unzen Volcano, Japan as well as samples from Soufrière Hills Volcano, Montserrat, West Indies. The elastic wave velocities of differently porous Unzen dacite samples were investigated with the use of a cubic multi-anvil press. The main results of this study show that porosity (density) and texture affect the elastic properties of samples at a given temperature. In particular, it can be stated: (1) Seismic velocities increase with pressure due to compaction and closing of microcracks. The Vp anisotropy decreases with pressure for the same reason. (2) Increasing the temperature also leads to higher elastic wave velocities and lower anisotropies. This must be highlighted as the inverse behavior is documented for the majority of rocks. The effect may be linked to reduction of pore volume and further closing of microcracks due to reduction of cooling tensions. At 600 °C mean Vp values of 4. 31 - 5. 64 km/s and mean Vs* values of 2. 20 - 3. 32 km/s could be determined. (3) The velocity anisotropy can be linked to the texture of the samples: Those with a high anisotropy show a pronounced shape-preferred orientation of phenocrysts and microcrystals, sometimes in addition to layering within the groundmass of the sample. Since the crystals are typically aligned parallel to walls of volcanic conduits, the velocity normal to the walls is likely to be reduced. The data allows better estimates of the properties of silicic volcanic rocks at shallow depths within volcanoes, e. g. at conduit walls. These estimates are vital for computation of conduit models as well as the modelling of volcano seismic data, and may lead to an improved analysis of precursor phenomena in volcanic areas. The physical properties of magma within volcanic conduits and domes are crucial for modelling eruptions. This study comprises a detailed investigation of the fragmentation behavior (threshold and propagation speed) of differently porous sets of dacitic and andesitic samples derived from Unzen Volcano, Japan and Soufrière Hills Volcano, Montserrat, West Indies. The experiments were performed with a shock-tube based fragmentation apparatus and pertain to the brittle fragmentation process. The results show a strong influence of the open porosity and the initial pressure on the fragmentation behavior. The speed of fragmentation follows a logarithmic relationship with the pressure difference, the fragmentation threshold an inversely proportional power-law relationship with increasing porosity. In this study fragmentation speed values ranging from 15 - 150 m/s were observed for applied pressure differences of up to 40 MPa and open porosities from 2. 5 - 67. 1 %. The expansion of the pressurized gas in the vesicles largely provides the energy driving the fragmentation process. The fragmentation speed results of all analyzed samples show a close relationship to the energy density (fragmentation energy standardized to volume). A logarithmical increase of the propagation speed was observed with the energy density as soon as the energy threshold of 2. 0 x 0. 5 J/m³ was exceeded. The fragmentation speed is independent from the origin and composition of the samples, proving the governing role of the energy to the initiation a propagation of fragmentation process. Different fragmentation mechanisms were discussed and the layer-by-layer fragmentation due to vesicle bursting is concluded to be the main process responsible for the disintegration of <b>vesicular</b> <b>rocks.</b> The increased importance of fracturing due to the passing of the unloading wave after a rapid decompression could be proved for low porous samples. Further the influence of the sample’s permeability on the fragmentation behavior was evaluated. It could be shown that a high permeability hinders the initiation of a fragmentation and reduces the propagation speed of this process at a certain energy density. The fragmentation results were applied to the dome collapse events and Vulcanian events of the 1990 - 1995 Unzen eruption and the 1997 Vulcanian events at Montserrat. Large blocks with layers of various porosity were observed at the block-and-ash flow deposits of Unzen Volcano and support the model that a dome and dome lobes consist of areas of differing porosity. In addition, the samples gained from Montserrat, allow to postulate a porosity gradient within a volcanic conduit, with low porous magma close to the conduit walls. A layered composition of a dome and dome lobes, respectively, may lead to the fragmentation of single layers, followed by the collapse of the overlaying sections. These events could catalyze gravitationally induced dome collapse events leading to vigorous pyroclastic flows and / or trigger a sector collapse followed by an Vulcanian event. A porosity gradient at the magma in the conduit leads to a concave shape of the fragmentation surface and facilitates lateral fragmentation of dense magma close to the conduit walls. Conduit implosion may to occur during most explosive eruptions and is likely to influence the cessation or pulsation of the eruption. The slow magma ascent and extrusion rate at Unzen resulted in relatively dense extruded magma, as the magma could almost completely degas during the ascent. The low porosity of this magma causes a high fragmentation threshold of most material, which is too high for unassisted fragmentation. Therefore dome collapse events were the most abundant events of the 1990 - 1995 activity of Unzen Volcano, leading to numerous block-and-ash flows. Also the fragmentation-amplified collapse of dome lobes or parts of the dome are reasonable. This accounts especially for the long lasting collapse events with vigorous pyroclastic flows at the early stage of the eruption in June 1991, which were followed by minor Vulcanian events. Nevertheless a larger explosive event would have been possible, triggered by a landslide or a sector collapse of the dome. Similarly to Unzen, the first phase of activity of the recent eruption of Montserrat is characterized by numerous dome collapse events leading to violent pyroclastic flows. As the magma extrusion rate was quite high during this phase, the extruded magma was higher vesiculated compared to the Unzen magma and thus a more violent evolution of the eruption activity took place. Large dome collapse events frequently caused Vulcanian events, and even two cycles of Vulcanian activity from August to September 1997 occurred. The calculations of the fragmentation depth, reached by this explosions yielded about 1500 m, based on the laboratory gained fragmentation speeds, which is in good agreement numerical models and observations. In silicic volcanic systems the conduit seems not to be sharply defined. The conduit walls are more to be seen as a kind of transition zone between a hot, ductile and vesicular magma within the conduit and the host rock. The rocks forming this transition zone are assumed to be quite hot, but presumably below glass transition and react therefore solely brittle. Furthermore these rocks should be quite dense, compared to magma in the conduit, and heavily fractured due to the high shear strains this zone is presumably exposed to. The transition zone is less likely affected by a fragmentation event. Their rocks (magma as well as host rocks) are too dense to fragment due to pore pressure. The needed pressure difference is unrealistically high, for example an overpressure of 18 MPa would be needed to initiate the fragmentation of rocks with a porosity of 7. 5 %. Nevertheless this material may be found in the deposits of explosive events, due to processes like conduit wall erosion or as remnant of dense lenses within more porous areas. Indeed, also fragmentation may take place, the most likely process fragmenting even this dense material is by lateral fragmentation, which may occur from a certain depth on behind a fast propagating fragmentation of highly vesicular magma at the center of the conduit. The style and progression of an eruption is depending on the properties of this vesicular magma. If its fragmentation threshold can be exceeded, an explosive event may take place. Otherwise the magma is extruded quiescent in a dome forming eruption. The transition zone bears important implications on the one hand for the explosive event as a lateral fragmentation of a certain area may cause cessation or pulsation of the event, on the other hand for the propagation of seismic signals related to the eruption. Within this transition zone as well as the nearby host rock a decisive change of temperature and porosity can be supposed. This leads to a significant shift of the elastic wave velocities within this zone, sometimes resulting in trapped waves within this zone as observed for Montserrat. Especially the abnormal velocity increase with increasing temperatures has to be mentioned. Thus implications for an overall view of a volcanic system are provided in this study, with the transition zone as the common link. The properties of the elastic wave velocities account for the for host rock as well as the transition zone and bear vital constraints for the interpretation and modelling of volcano seismic data. The results of the fragmentation experiments are applicable for dome <b>rocks,</b> the <b>vesicular</b> interior of a conduit as well as the transition zone and contain important implications for the modelling of conduit processes. Together the results of this study may contribute to a refined understanding of processes typical for silicic volcanism. This may allow an improved analysis of precursor phenomena in volcanic areas and consequently provide important constraints to the hazard and risk management...|$|R

PART I: A {{study of the}} shocked Coconino sandstone from Meteor Crater, Arizona, was undertaken to examine the role of porosity in the compression of rocks and {{in the formation of}} high-pressure phases. A suite of shocked Coconino specimens collected at the crater is divided into five classes, arranged in order of decreasing quartz content. The amounts of coesite, stishovite (measured by quantitative x-ray diffraction) and glass vary systematically with decreasing quartz content. Coesite may comprise one-third by weight of some rocks, whereas the stishovite content does not exceed 1 %. The five classes of rocks have distinct petrographic properties, correlated with the presence of regions containing coesite, stishovite or fused silica. Very few occurrences of diaplectic glass are observed, in striking contrast to its abundant occurrence in the non-porous rocks from the Ries Crater. In the lowest stages of shock metamorphism (Class I), the quartz grains are fractured and the voids in the rock are filled with myriads of small chips derived from neighboring grains. The fracture patterns in the individual quartz grains are controlled by the details of the initial morphology of the colliding grains. In one weakly shocked rock, it was possible to map the general direction of shock passage by recording the apparent direction of collision of individual grains. The principal mechanism of energy deposition by a shock wave in a porous material is the reverberation of shock and rarefaction waves through grains due to collisions with other grains. A one-dimensional model of the impact process can predict the average pressure, volume and temperature of the rock if no phase changes occur, but cannot predict the observed nonuniformity of energy deposition. In all rocks shocked to higher pressure than was necessary to close the voids, high-pressure and/or high-temperature phases are present. Locally high pressures enduring for microseconds and high temperatures enduring for milliseconds controlled the phases of SiO 2 which formed in the rock. Collapsing pore walls became local hot spots into which initial deposition of energy was focused. Microcrystalline coesite in Class II rocks occurs in symplektic regions on quartz grain boundaries which were regions of initial stress and energy concentration, or in sheared zones within the grains. The occurrence and morphology of the coesite-rich regions can be explained only if the transformation from quartz to coesite proceeds slowly in the shock wave. In Class III rocks, microcrystalline coesite occurs in opaque regions which surround nearly isotropic cores of cryptocrystalline coesite. The cores are interpreted to be the products of the inversion of stishovite (or a glass with Si in six-fold coordination) which initially formed in the shock front in regions of grains shocked to pressures near 300 kb. Stishovite is preserved only in the opaque regions, which are believed to have been cooler than the cores. In Class IV <b>rocks,</b> <b>vesicular</b> glass occurs in core regions surrounded by opaque regions containing coesite. The relation of the glass to the coesite and quartz suggests that the glass was formed by inversion of stishovite formed above 350 kb upon release to lower pressure. Class V rocks are composed almost entirely of glass with vesicles uniformly distributed in the glass. These vesicles were probably formed by exsolution of water that had been dissolved in melted SiO 2 during passage of the shock. PART II: The use of Debye temperatures as parameters for material properties of silicate minerals is becoming common in geophysical studies. The elastic Debye temperature, [ [...] . ] alone is, in general, insufficient to specify properties which depend on lattice vibrations. Two effects ignored by the Debye model are shown to be important: high frequency lattice vibrations and the dispersion relation. As an alternative to the Debye model, a somewhat more complicated model is proposed that is still reasonably convenient and is able to account much better than the Debye model does for the variation of specific heat of complex substances over a wide range of temperature. This model is designated the acoustic-optic model. The parameters required for this model are the maximum lattice vibrational frequency, the elastic Debye temperature, and the specific heat at a single (say, room) temperature. Adequate approximations to these parameters are generally available. To consider heat capacity data and compare the data with either the Debye or acoustic-optic model, the calorimetric Debye temperature, [ [...] . ] is considered. [ [...] . ] is the value of Debye temperature that will reproduce the specific heat at constant volume at the temperature T. For silicates, a large increase at high temperatures in [ [...] . ] above the elastic Debye temperature is due to the presence of oscillators between the elastic Debye frequency and a maximum vibrational frequency which exceeds the Debye frequency. Vibrations of these oscillators cause the spectral lines observed at infrared frequencies. The proposed model takes these oscillators into account by adding a constant valued continuum to an assumed low-frequency Debye spectrum. In all substances considered, [ [...] . ] at low temperatures initially decreases to values below [ [...] . ]. This decrease is believed due to the dispersion relation, i. e., the nonlinear relation between the wave vector and the frequency. In two substances of geophysical interest, NaCl and MgO, the maximum observed vibrational frequency is depressed below the observed elastic Debye frequency {{as a consequence of the}} dispersion relation. The acoustic-optic model is capable of predicting the specific heat of these two substances and the acoustic-optic spectra which result from application of the model to these substances describe qualitatively the spectra that result from the dispersion relation. The nonlinearity of the dispersion relation dominates the specific heat behavior of NaCl and MgO and influences the low temperature behavior of all silicates with varying degrees of severity. The effect of the dispersion relation can be ignored for some silicates if specific heats only at high temperatures (T > 100 [degrees]K) are considered. The effect cannot be ignored in the case of rutile or stishovite...|$|R
