40|$|Abstract. This paper {{raises a}} model which {{concerns}} about spinning reserve capacity of output and predicted error based on chance-constrained programming. The distribution function is established on the load demand of electric vehicles. Considering the complementarities of electric vehicles and small hydro and wind power generations, this paper constructs a dispatch model on {{the participation of}} electric <b>vehicles</b> <b>in</b> <b>reserve</b> capacity and peak regulation. Joint operation of different units in the system achieved by genetic algorithm examines the influence from joint dispatch of electric vehicles and small hydro and wind power generations on spinning reserve capacity and peak regulation plan, setting different values of confidence to make comparison of electric charge in the entire system. According to the real operation statistics of an electric company in a certain province, the reliability and accuracy of the model was guaranteed...|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after being}} taken into use, No. 158 lost braking power, killing one person when it {{landed on the}} pavement. The initial plan was to use the six trams to operate all {{services}} on the Kjelsås Line, with one <b>vehicle</b> <b>in</b> <b>reserve,</b> {{but this was not}} possible because of more out-of-service vehicles than estimated.|$|R

40|$|The goal {{of every}} public {{transport}} operator {{is to not}} only provide high-quality service, but also to minimize investment and operating costs. A {{significant proportion of the}} costs are associated with the acquisition, operation and maintenance of reserve vehicles. If the number of <b>vehicles</b> held <b>in</b> <b>reserve</b> is too high, an operator will incur economic losses because vehicles are underused. Conversely, if the number of reserve vehicles is too low, the quality of service will be reduced due to disruptions in the timetable. To determine the number of <b>vehicles</b> to hold <b>in</b> <b>reserve,</b> a coefficient of availability is commonly used. The coefficient of availability is determined by two parameters: reliability and maintainability. Both parameters have the same physical dimensions, the mean time between failures (MTBF) and mean time to repair, and they are expressed <b>in</b> hours. <b>Vehicle</b> wear, which results during the emergence of failures, is not very dependent on the time of operation but is strongly dependent on the distance travelled. It is therefore appropriate to use mean distance between failures (MDBF) instead of MTBF, because it better describes the reliability of vehicles. Using MDBF, however, means that the coefficient of availability is not considered, because MDBF and MTTR have different physical dimensions. This problem is solved by using a random vector that makes it is possible to determine the number of <b>vehicles</b> to hold <b>in</b> <b>reserve</b> based on the distance travelled and maintenance time. This original approach allows the acquisition of better and more authentic data necessary for an operator’s decision-making process. Therefore, the number of required reserve vehicles can be much better planned. Ultimately, this positively affects the quality of services and also the investment and operating costs of the operator.

40|$|Unmanned aerial {{vehicles}} (UAVs), {{also known}} as drones have many applications {{and they are a}} current trend across many industries. They can be used for delivery, sports, surveillance, professional photography, cinematography, military combat, natural disaster assistance, security, and the list grows every day. Programming opens an avenue to automate many processes of daily life and with the drone as aerial programmable eyes, security and surveillance can become more efficient and cost effective. At Barry University, parking is becoming an issue as the number of people visiting the school greatly outnumbers the convenient parking locations. This has caused a multitude of hazards in parking lots due to people illegally parking, as well as unregistered <b>vehicles</b> parking <b>in</b> <b>reserved</b> areas. <b>In</b> this paper, we explain how automated drone surveillance is utilized to detect unauthorized parking at Barry University. The automated process is incorporated into Java application and completed in three steps: collecting visual data, processing data automatically, and sending automated responses and queues to the operator of the system...|$|R

Vacancy monitoring module detects {{the presence of}} <b>vehicle</b> <b>in</b> the parking areas and provide the status to the users in real time.

5|$|Despite Negev's achievements, {{they were}} also given an order to retreat, as the Israeli command {{did not wish to}} fight in broad daylight. The {{retreating}} forces {{had no choice but to}} use a route similar to the ones they came from, which slowed down their movement. Most of the machine guns that they had brought had broken down in the sandy environment, and could not provide them with cover. They were also carrying a multitude of wounded soldiers. Muhammad Naguib decided to use the armored <b>vehicles</b> <b>in</b> his operational <b>reserve</b> against the retreating forces, fearing a possible cut-off from the rest of the Egyptian forces in Palestine. According to Simha Shiloni, commander of the Negev Beasts battalion, the Israelis, especially the wounded, thought that all was lost when this happened. However, the vehicles stopped eventually as they got bogged down in the sands, and the troops made it back to Nitzanim. Sixteen Israeli soldiers were killed in the retreat.|$|R
2500|$|DCFEMS {{also asked}} the D.C. police to {{investigate}} whether arson {{was the cause of}} the ambulance fires. Deputy Mayor Paul Quander called two ambulance fires on the same day suspicious and asked the police to investigate to ensure that [...] "nothing untoward is happening". Quander declined to elaborate on what he meant, and the firefighters' union denounced his statement as a slur on workers. But on August 16, a preliminary investigation determined that both fires were likely accidental. Investigators discovered that DCFEMS maintenance crews (with management approval) were attempting to fix overheating vehicle air conditioners by cutting up aluminum signs and using them as heat shields. DCFEMS superiors ordered the [...] "heat shields" [...] removed after the revelation. Police arson investigators then learned that Medic 27 (which caught fire at the apartment building) had ongoing maintenance issues and that its air conditioner repeatedly failed. The investigation determined that the fire started near the air conditioner (although it did not determine exactly which piece of equipment failed and caused the fire), and concluded the fire was accidental. Medic 27, a 2006 <b>vehicle</b> <b>in</b> the <b>reserve</b> fleet, suffered $25,000 in damage. The second [...] "fire" [...] was not a fire but merely smoke issuing from under the hood of the ambulance. D.C police arson investigators found a small plastic container of transmission fluid stored in the engine compartment, which began smoking after being heated by the constantly-running engine. Because no actual fire occurred, the report did not conclude whether the container was placed there accidentally.|$|R

25|$|A {{new report}} in January 2002 {{revealed}} that Few had ordered no new firefighting or emergency services <b>vehicles</b> <b>in</b> the past 18 months, {{and that the}} city's fleet was quickly approaching decrepitude. A third of all pumper trucks were out of service due to ill-repair and age, and the city was patching up 15-year-old vehicles (which were due to have been scrapped four years ago) to fight fires. Not a single pumper could be held <b>in</b> <b>reserve</b> to fight major fires {{due to the lack}} of <b>vehicles.</b> <b>In</b> one case, the city pressed a fire academy training vehicle into service because it ran out of pumpers. (Reserve pumpers had fallen to 11 in 2002 from 13 in July 2000, five fewer than required.) The department was also short three of the eight ladder trucks required for reserves. Few blamed city officials for not releasing $1.8 million to buy six new pumpers, even though he spent $32,000 to purchase a new command vehicle and an undisclosed sum to buy himself and other commanders 14 new cars. The report also showed that fire truck drivers were inadequately trained and poorly supervised, and were having too many accidents. Because of the lack of reserve vehicles, drivers also continued to operate vehicles even though they should have turned them in for repair. This worsened the repair issues when the vehicle finally failed. Although Few ordered the six pumpers by June 2002, there were still too few trucks <b>in</b> <b>reserve.</b>|$|R
