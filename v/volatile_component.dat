It is commonly used as a fuel for engines, barbecues, portable stoves, and residential central heating. Propane was first identified as a <b>volatile</b> <b>component</b> in gasoline by Dr. Walter O.

25|$|As the {{solution}} to be purified is heated, its vapors rise to the fractionating column. As it rises, it cools, condensing on the condenser walls and the surfaces of the packing material. Here, the condensate continues to be heated by the rising hot vapors; it vaporizes once more. However, {{the composition of the}} fresh vapors are determined once again by Raoult's law. Each vaporization-condensation cycle (called a theoretical plate) will yield a purer solution of the more <b>volatile</b> <b>component.</b> In reality, each cycle at a given temperature does not occur at exactly the same position in the fractionating column; theoretical plate is thus a concept rather than an accurate description.|$|E

A total of 49 <b>volatile</b> <b>components</b> were identified by GC-MS, and the major <b>volatile</b> <b>components</b> were α-limonene (20. 59 – 35. 07 %), fenchone (15. 79 – 31. 81 %), α-caryophyllene (6. 98 – 10. 32 %), β-caryophyllene (6. 98 – 10. 19 %), and piperitenone oxide (1. 96 – 11. 63 %). The comparison of the <b>volatile</b> <b>components</b> from A. indianum (Lour.) Merr. grown in two regions of China was reported.

The new component was what we now know as hydrogen cyanide. Following Macquer's lead, it was first prepared from Prussian blue by the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele in 1782, and was eventually given the German name Blausäure (lit.
