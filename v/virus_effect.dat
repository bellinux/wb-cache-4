40|$|Limited {{protection}} of current vaccines and antiviral drugs against influenza A virus infection underscores {{the urgent need}} for development of novel anti-influenza virus interventions. While short interfering RNA (siRNA) {{has been shown to be}} able to inhibit influenza virus infection in a gene-specific manner, activation of the retinoic acid-inducible gene I protein (RIG-I) pathway has an antiviral effect in a non-gene-specific mode. In this study, we designed and tested the anti-influ-enza <b>virus</b> <b>effect</b> of a short double-stranded RNA, designated 3 p-mNP 1496 -siRNA, that possesses dual functions: an siRNA-targeting influenza NP gene and an agonist for RIG-I activation.

Our study showed that 3 p-mNP 1496 -siRNA could po-tently inhibit influenza A virus infection both in cell culture and in mice. The strong inhibition effect was attributed to its siRNA function as well as its ability to activate the RIG-I pathway.

40|$|Rationale : Emotions {{have been}} {{associated}} with production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IL- 6; more precisely, negative emotions with greater cytokines level whereas positive emotions with lower level of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This may have significant repercussions on individuals&#x 2019; health specifically for those who are subjected to chronic inflammation {{as in the case of}} HIV positive persons. In fact, HIV virus itself produces greater TNF-alpha production, which in its turns might promote greater IL- 6 levels. Thus, this work was conducted in order to verify whether along with HIV association with pro-inflammatory cytokines production, negative and positive emotions, as well as their &#x 201 C;balance&#x 201 D;, might be associated with cytokines level. Methods : Participants to this cross-sectional study were 90 individuals with HIV diagnosis. Emotions were assessed through the Italian version of Derogatis Affects Balance Scale edited by the first two authors of this work. The biomarkers included were viral load, TNF-alpha, and IL- 6. Individuals also self-reported whether they were under antiretroviral therapy. Results : A Structural Equation Model was performed in order to test if negative and positive emotions and their balance (that consisted in the ratio of positive/negative emotions) along with viral load were associated with cytokines level. Results indicated that viral load (&#x 03 B 2;&#x 200 A;=&#x 200 A; 0. 538, p&# 60; 0. 001), negative emotions (&#x 03 B 2;&#x 200 A;=&#x 200 A; 0. 366, p&# 60; 0. 05) and positive/negative emotions (&#x 03 B 2;&#x 200 A;=&#x 200 A;&#x 2212;&#x 200 A; 0. 420, p&# 60; 0. 05) ratio were significantly associated with greater TNF-alpha production. No significant associations were observed with IL- 6.

40|$|Background Recombinant poxviruses expressing tumor {{associated}} antigens (TAAs) {{are evaluated}} since 20 years as immunogenic vaccine vector in clinical trials. Some caveats for using recombinant viral vector {{are due to}} either prior systemic immunity to poxviruses or immunodominance of viral antigens which may reduce the induction of immune response against weaker tumor antigens. To address this issue, we developed a recombinant vaccinia virus (VV) expressing herpes simplex virus (HSV) type I protein ICP 47. This protein down-regulates MHC class-I antigen presentation by blocking the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP), which translocates peptides, generated by proteasomal protein degradation, into the endoplasmic reticulum for loading onto MHC class I molecule. Methods HSV-US 12 gene, coding for ICP 47 was introduced into wild type vaccinia virus (VV) and into r. VV expressing MART- 1 /Melan-A 27 - 35 HLA-A 201 ER-targeted epitope. Following infection with non-replicating recombinant <b>virus,</b> <b>effect</b> of ICP 47 expression on cell surface MHC-class-I, MHC class-II and co-stimulatory molecules was characterized by antibody staining and FACS analysis. Human T-lymphocytes were stimulated in vitro with autologous CD 14 + cells infected with r. VV-US 12, r. VV-Mart-US 12 or control virus. Responsiveness of specific CD 8 + and CD 4 + T cells to viral proteins and to recombinant epitopes was monitored by MHC-multimer staining and cytokines (IFNγ & IL- 2) expression analysis. In order to highlight in vitro the immunogenic advantage provided by ICP 47 blockade of viral epitopes, T cells were pre-sensitized with WT-VV infected APC and then used as responders to r. VV-Mart-US 12 or r. VV-Mart infected APC. Results Cells infected with HSV-US 12 -r. VV, demonstrated a decreased ability of presenting MHC class-I antigens to CD 8 + T cells whereas MHC-class-II restricted presentation to CD 4 + T cells remained unaffected. Cell surface expression of CD 80 as a costimulatory molecule and CD 44 as cell adhesion molecule was not affected in cells infecied with VV expressing ICP 47. Co-expression of ER-Melan-A/Mart- 127 - 35 appeared to partially compensate for the ICP 47 related surface MHC class-I down-regulation and preserve a strong capacity to induce CTL response against the TAA derived peptide. The differential prime-stimulation for Mart epitope, in conditions where clearance of infected APC by VV specific CTL could become a limiting factor, showed significantly enhanced CTL responses to Mart stimulation as characterized by IFN-γ and IL- 2 gene expression in cultures primed with r. VV-Mart-US 12 as compared to cultures primed with r. VV-Mart. Conclusion Thus, viral vectors expressing ICP 47 confirmed a diminished TAP-dependant processing of endogenous class-I restricted epitopes while the immunogenic potential of recombinant epitopes directly targeted to the ER was enhanced. Such reagents could become of high relevance especially in multiple-boost vaccine protocol required in cancer immunotherapy. ...|$|E

In our studies, the ethyl acetate extracts were effectively suppressed the bacterial and fungal pathogens {{due to the}} antimicrobial compounds present in the metabolites. Due to the mid polarity of the ethyl acetate extraction, most of the polar and mid polar compounds active compounds eluted these solvents. A moderately halophilic Streptomyces spp. JAJ 06 producing an antimicrobial compound of polyketide type was isolated from saltpan soil collected at Tuticorin, India (Aruljose et al. 2011). Antifungal secondary metabolites have been isolated from alkaliphilic N. dassonvillei WA 52 (Ali et al. 2009), Nocardia spp. ALAA 2000 (El-Gendy et al. 2008) and marine Streptomyces spp. DPTB 16 (Dhanasekaran et al. 2008). S. violaceusniger G 10 produced antifungal metabolites that effectively inhibited the growth of Fusarium spp. (Getha and Vikineswary 2002). Antiviral activity of halotolerant actinomycetes is also reported against tobacco mosaic tobamovirus and potato Y potyvirus (Mohamed and Galal 2005).

40|$|Polymorphism in the Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) {{region of}} {{chromosome}} {{is the major}} source of host genetic variability in outcome of HIV- 1 infection. However, there is limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effect of protective class I alleles such as HLA-B 57, B 27 and B 51. Taking advantage of a unique cohort (SM cohort) infected with clade B’ HIV- 1 through contaminated blood, in which many variables, such as the length of infection, the infecting viral strain and host genetic background are controlled, we performed a comprehensive study in order to understand HLA-B 51 associated HIV- 1 control. We first focused on the T cell responses against three dominant HLA-B 51 restricted epitopes: GagNI 9 (NANPDCKTI), Pol TV 8 (TAFTIPSV) and Pol LI 9 (LPPVVAKEI), and HLA-B 51 associated escape mutations in these three epitopes. A sequential selection of epitope mutations (i. e., epitope Pol LI 9, Pol TV 8 and Gag NI 9) was observed. Good control of viral load and higher CD 4 + counts were significantly associated with at least one detectable T cell response to un-mutated epitopes. HLA-B 51 restricted CD 8 + T-cell clones, generated from the patients, could effectively inhibit HIV- 1 replication when wild type epitopes are properly processed and presented. We then assessed the evolution of escape mutations under the selecting pressure of HLA-B 51 CTLs in vitro by co-culturing HLA-B 51 CTL clones with HIV- 1 infected target cells (Virus Evolution Assay). Our data showed that three dominant HLA-B 51 restricted CTL responses have driven the sequential escape mutations within the epitopes, leading to the loss of viral control, which confirmed our in vivo findings. Furthermore, applying Virus Evolution Assay, we assessed the impact of antigen sensitivity and TCR usage as well as founder <b>virus</b> <b>effect</b> on HIV- 1 evolution and control. Our data suggested that antigen sensitivity {{plays an important role in}} anti-viral efficacy of CTLs; the TCR usage of CTLs has stronger effect on virus evolution. More importantly, our study highlighted the major impact of the founder virus sequence on viral control. It has been shown that HIV- 1 has adapted to the T-cell responses to epitope Pol TI 8 in other HLA-B 51 + patient cohorts. However, in our cohort, T-cell responses targeting this epitope, with Valine at position 8 (Pol TV 8), provide the hosts with a long-term protection against HIV- 1 infection, because of a fine balance of efficient viral control, lower level of immune pressure and the slower rate of development of escape mutations. In addition, we assessed the ex vivo phenotypic characteristics of HLA-B 51 restricted dominant T cell responses and our preliminary data indicated that the early differentiated and less senescence phenotype of CD 8 + T cell responses in HIV- 1 chronic infection is likely to be a result of low viral antigen exposure due to T cell driven escape. In conclusion, immune-dominant T-cell responses targeting three HLA-B 51 restricted epitopes (Pol LI 9, Pol TV 8 and Gag NI 9) could be advantageous for the host. In particular, the responses against epitope Gag NI 9 with slow development of escape mutations or epitope Pol TV 8 with a fine balance of moderate immune pressure and delayed escape mutations, are beneficial for long-term control of HIV- 1 infection.

40|$|The IHD {{strain of}} vaccinia virus caused the {{rounding}} of all LLC-MK 2 cells {{in a culture}} within 2 to 4 hr after infection. One #g. /ml. of either cycloheximide or streptovitacin A protected 75 ~ of the infected ceils from early cytopathic effects occurring 4 hr after infection and treatment. As much as 83 #g. /ml. of puromycin was required {{to achieve the same}} degree of in-hibition. Puromycin (33 o/~g. /ml.) continued to protect> 9 o ~ of the infected cells 24 hr after infection, while < 4 o ~ of cells treated with cycloheximide (3 oo #g. /ml.) or streptovitacin A (3 oo/~g. /ml.) were protected from <b>virus</b> cytopathic <b>effects</b> at 24 hr. Seventy-five per cent inhibition of virus re-production was achieved with 24 #g. /ml. puromycin, oq 25 #g. ]ml. cyclo-heximide and 0. 062 /~g. /ml. of streptovitacin A. When either puromycin (33 o #g. /ml.) or cycloheximide (3 oo #g. /ml.) was removed from infected cultures after a treatment period of 4 hr, cell rounding began shortly there-after and was complete I hr later. However, after the removal of strepto-vitacin A (3 oo #g. /ml.) there was a ~ hr delay before <b>virus</b> cytopathic <b>effects</b> appeared. The cytopathic effects reached maximum 3 hr after the removal of the compound. When streptovitacin A was removed from LLC-MK 2 cells in-fected with vaccinia virus the yield was 3 ° ~ of control 24 hr after infection. Virus yields from L 2 cells treated with streptovitacin A, however, were only I to 5 ~ of control yields. The aminonucleoside of puromycin (33 o #g. /ml.) markedly inhibited virus replication, but did not significantly alter the development of <b>virus</b> cytopathic <b>effects.</b> These findings are taken as further evidence that the early cytopathological effects induced by vaccinia virus result from the synthesis of virus-induced protein(s) ...|$|R

Concurrent substance abuse, co-morbid mental health conditions, poor socioeconomic status and a complex treatment protocol that is often incompatible with the life styles of IDUs combine to account for poor uptake and completion of HCV treatment.

However, one key finding {{has been that the}} use of viral agents that replicate selectively in tumors is usually insufficient to achieve anything beyond small and transient responses. Instead, like most cancer therapies, oncolytic viruses are most effective in combination with other therapies, which is where they have proven therapeutic effects in clinical and preclinical studies. In cases of some of the smaller RNA <b>viruses,</b> <b>effects</b> can only be achieved through combination regimens with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or targeted conventional therapies. However, larger DNA viruses are able to express one or more transgenes; thus, therapeutic mechanisms can be built into the viral vector itself. The incorporated approaches into arming oncolytic viruses through transgene expression will be the main focus of this review, including use of immune activators, prodrug converting enzymes, anti-angiogenic factors, and targeting of the stroma. This will focus on poxviruses as model systems with large cloning capacities, which have routinely been used as transgene expression vectors in different settings, including vaccine and oncolytic viral therapy.
