25|$|A {{controller}} is a server-side {{component of}} Rails that responds to external requests from the web server to the application, by determining which <b>view</b> <b>file</b> to render. The controller {{may also have}} to query one or more models for information and pass these on to the view. For example, in an airline reservation system, a controller implementing a flight-search function would need to query a model representing individual flights to find flights matching the search, and might also need to query models representing airports and airlines to find related secondary data. The controller might then pass some subset of the flight data to the corresponding view, which would contain a mixture of static HTML and logic that use the flight data to create an HTML document containing a table with one row per flight. A controller may provide one or more actions. In Ruby on Rails, an action is typically a basic unit that describes {{how to respond to}} a specific external web-browser request. Also, note that the controller/action will be accessible for external web requests only if a corresponding route is mapped to it. Rails encourages developers to use RESTful routes, which include actions such as create, new, edit, update, destroy, show, and index. These mappings of incoming requests/routes to controller actions can be easily set up in the routes.rb configuration file.|$|E

50|$|File Dialog Box is a box {{where it}} {{contains}} files.There are {{several types of}} file dialogs. The two most common being a two column <b>view</b> <b>file</b> dialog and a mini file browser dialog. Others include thumbnail view (for photos) and Meta-data (For music). There are several reasons for the many varieties of dialogs. First of all {{there is no single}} standard design, so a program may implement their own for any purpose. Many GUI toolkits do not provide a file dialog, so an application is forced to use its own.|$|E
5000|$|File System Visualizer, {{also known}} as fsv, is a 3D file browser using OpenGL, created by Daniel Richard G. It is a clone of SGI's fsn file manager for IRIX systems, aimed to run on modern Linux and other Unix-like {{operating}} systems. It is capable of representing file systems in two ways - in MapV mode, files and directories are represented as cuboids of equal height, {{with the size of}} the cuboid representing the size of the file or directory, and in TreeV mode, files and directories are shown in a more conventional tree manner, with links between parent directories and subdirectories, and columns of various height (indicating file size) on top of the directories to represent the files inside. In both of these modes, a standard 2D tree representation of files and directories is displayed on the left of the window. The mouse can be used to rotate the 3D representation of the file system, and an [...] "Eagle Eye" [...] function shows the representation from an overhead <b>view.</b> <b>File</b> System Visualizer is also capable of manipulating the files and directories it shows.|$|E

40|$|Introduction One can <b>view</b> <b>file</b> system {{evolution}} as having passed through three stages: 1. Uniprocessor systems, like original UNIX. In such systems {{there is no}} truly concurrent {{access to the same}} file by several clients, and so it was not hard to design file systems that provide the most recent data to every reader. 2. Distributed and/or parallel non-replicated systems, which bring added problems: ffl Concurrent access, meaning several clients access the same server. This opens the question of cache consistency. ffl Client and server can fail separately. 3. Replicated systems, bringing those problems mentioned above plus: ffl Concurrent access, now meaning the possibility of separate clients simultaneously accessing the same file at separate servers. ffl Separate failure among servers as well as between client and server raises the possibility of version skew at the servers. A fourth stage is here now: mobile computing,...|$|E
