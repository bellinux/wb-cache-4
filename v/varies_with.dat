40|$|In {{life-cycle}} economies, {{where an}} individual’s optimal consumption-work plan is almost never constant, the optimal marginal tax rates on capital and labor income <b>vary</b> <b>with</b> age. Conversely, the progressivity imbedded in the U. S. tax code implies that marginal tax rates <b>vary</b> <b>with</b> age because tax rates <b>vary</b> <b>with</b> earnings and earnings <b>vary</b> <b>with</b> age. This paper shows {{that if the}} tax authority is prevented from conditioning tax rates on age, some degree of progressivity is desirable as progressive taxation better imitates optimal agedependent taxes than an optimal age-independent tax system. This role for progressive taxation emanates from efficiency reasons and does not rely on any insurance nor re-distribution arguments...|$|R
5|$|Surface {{differential}} rotation is observed on {{stars such as}} the Sun when the angular velocity <b>varies</b> <b>with</b> latitude. Typically the angular velocity decreases with increasing latitude. However the reverse has also been observed, such as on the star designated HD31993.

The height of the troposphere <b>varies</b> <b>with</b> latitude, ranging between 8km at the poles to 17km at the equator, with some variation resulting from weather and seasonal factors.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} layers {{deposited}} <b>varies</b> <b>with</b> {{location in the}} Lake Lewis basin.

5|$|A few insects, such {{as members}} of the {{families}} Poduridae and Onychiuridae (Collembola), Mycetophilidae (Diptera) and the beetle families Lampyridae, Phengodidae, Elateridae and Staphylinidae are bioluminescent. The most familiar group are the fireflies, beetles of the family Lampyridae. Some species are able to control this light generation to produce flashes. The function <b>varies</b> <b>with</b> some species using them to attract mates, while others use them to lure prey. Cave dwelling larvae of Arachnocampa (Mycetophilidae, fungus gnats) glow to lure small flying insects into sticky strands of silk.|$|E
