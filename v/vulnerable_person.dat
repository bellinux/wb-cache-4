40|$|Overview: Brisbane City Police have an {{increasing}} role {{in responding to}} <b>vulnerable</b> <b>persons,</b> often at risk in the CBD and police are often {{the first people to}} encounter vulnerable people in public space or in circumstances of need. QPS capacity to respond independently to the issues of vulnerable people at risk is often limited to separate and unconnected initiatives, projects and one off events. The Strategic Framework for Community Crime Prevention is a key element in the Queensland Crime Prevention – Building Safer Communities Strategy. The Brisbane City VPS provides the framework to coordinate and support sustainable local action on crime prevention approaches to <b>vulnerable</b> <b>persons</b> through methodology which empowers and mobilises the largest group of change agents – first response police. The Brisbane City Division <b>Vulnerable</b> <b>Persons</b> Strategy (VPS) brings together a range of activities and projects to align their goals and put coordinated action to the intentions of the QPS <b>Vulnerable</b> <b>Persons</b> Policy. The overarching vision of the VPS is to achieve a cultural change in the approach City police have to <b>vulnerable</b> <b>persons</b> through capacity building, first response police participation in community activities and empowering first response police as first to see – first to act agents of change...|$|R

2500|$|As {{provided}} {{for in the}} Magna Carta, [...] "no freeman shall be taken, imprisoned [...] except by the lawful judgment of his peers and by {{the law of the}} land." [...] The right is protected in three ways: the writ of habeas corpus requires a person under arrest to be brought before a judge or into court, the tort of false imprisonment and the offence of kidnapping. Where an individual is lawfully arrested on the basis of an arrest warrant, the length of his detention is prescribed by statute; the detainee's rights and the powers of the police during the period of detention are also regulated under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. The police have no general power to detain a person for questioning without making an arrest unless this is for the purpose of the exercise of another police power {{such as the use of}} a search warrant. Arrests without a warrant are possible if the person is committing or about to commit an offence and the arresting officer has reasonable grounds to believe that arrest is necessary in order to ascertain the person's details, to prevent them from causing injury, damage or further offences, to protect a child or other <b>vulnerable</b> <b>person,</b> to allow prompt and effective investigation of the offence or the person's conduct or to prevent the investigation being hindered by the person's disappearance.|$|E
2500|$|As {{opposed to}} duress and actual undue influence, where illegitimate {{pressure}} is applied, or presumed undue influence which {{depends on a}} relationship of trust and confidence being abused, further cases allow a <b>vulnerable</b> <b>person</b> to avoid an agreement merely {{on the basis that}} they were vulnerable and exploited. In The Medina the Court of Appeal found that a group of pilgrims shipwrecked on a rock in the Red Sea did not need to pay £4000 they promised to a rescue ship, because the [...] "rescuers" [...] had exploited the pilgrims vulnerable position. To prevent unjust enrichment, the Court substituted an award of £1800. Similarly, in Cresswell v Potter, Ms Cresswell conveyed her ex-husband her share of their joint property in return for release from mortgage repayments, later making him £1400 profit. Because Potter took advantage of Ms Creswell's ignorance of property transactions, Megarry J held the agreement was voidable. One potential exception to this pattern, and now very heavily restricted, is the defence of [...] "non est factum", which originally applied in favour of illiterate people in the 19th century allowed a person to have a signed contract declared void if it is radically different from what was envisaged. In Lloyds Bank Ltd v Bundy, Lord Denning MR proposed it was time that all cases be placed into one unified doctrine of [...] "inequality of bargaining power". This would have allowed escape from an agreement if without independent advice one person's ability to bargain for better terms had been heavily impaired, and would have essentially given courts broader scope to change contracts to the advantage of weaker parties. The idea of a general unified doctrine was disapproved by some members of the House of Lords from 1979. However, specific legislation, such as the Consumer Credit Act 1974, the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985, or the Employment Rights Act 1996 creates targeted rights for contracting parties who lack bargaining power, in the same way specific legislation circumscribes a duty of [...] and good faith. Thus, just as there is no unified theory of bargaining power, a unified doctrine of freedom of contract was dismantled long ago where the parties are not making commercial deals in the course of business.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the law on}} {{disclosure}} and misrepresentation aims to make contracting parties informed (or not disinformed), the law also says agreements may be avoided when, in a very general sense, a person's free will was impaired. Complete exercise of [...] "free will" [...] is rare for most people, because they make choices within a constrained range of alternatives. The law still holds people to nearly all contracts (if consumer, employment, tenancy, etc. legislation is not activated) except where someone was under duress, unduly influenced or exploited while in a vulnerable position. Like misrepresentation, the victim may avoid the contract, and the parties restore their property to reverse unjust enrichment, subject to the victim's claim for damages, so long as none of the four equitable bars to rescission lie (i.e. no excessive lapse of time, affirmation of the contract, intervention of an innocent third party's rights and counter-restitution is possible). The most straight forward claim, for duress, involves illegitimate threats. The common law long allowed a claim if duress was of a physical nature. So long as a threat {{is just one of}} the reasons a person enters an agreement, even if not the main reason, the agreement may be avoided. Only late in the 20th century was escape allowed if the threat involved illegitimate economic harm. A threat is always [...] "illegitimate" [...] if it is to do an unlawful act, such as breaking a contract knowing non-payment may push someone out of business. However, threatening to do a lawful act will usually not be illegitimate. In Pao on v Lau Yiu Long the Pao family threatened to not complete a share swap deal, aimed at selling their company's building, unless the Lau family agreed to change a part of the proposed agreement to guarantee the Paos would receive rises in the swapped shares' prices on repurchase. The Laus signed the guarantee agreement after this threat, and then claimed it was not binding. But the Privy Council advised their signature was only a result of [...] "commercial pressure", not economic duress. The Laus' considered the situation before signing, and did not behave like someone under duress, so there was no coercion amounting to a vitiation of consent. However, contrasting to cases involving business parties, the threat to do a lawful act will probably be duress if used against a <b>vulnerable</b> <b>person.</b> An obvious case involving [...] "lawful act duress" [...] is blackmail. The blackmailer has to justify, not doing the lawful act they threaten, but against a person highly vulnerable to them, the demand of money.|$|E

40|$|The {{topic of}} this {{research}} is: The Implementation of International Rules related to the Protection of <b>Vulnerable</b> <b>Persons</b> in Cameroon. Implementation is one most topical issues with respect to Human Rights in developing countries. States have adopted international rules concerning <b>vulnerable</b> <b>persons,</b> which have consequently {{given rise to a}} complete body of instruments. The responsibility of implementing these rules is emphasized by several legal instruments that govern Human Rights in general, particularly the United Nations Charter, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Since independence, the respect of Human Rights has been enshrined in the Cameroon’s constitution. However, in spite of this theoretical consecration, concerns related to the protection of human rights persist due to socio-cultural sluggishness and economic difficulties, which cause dramatic effects within the most vulnerable social groups. The main point of departure for the research is to understand how Cameroon is implementing international rules which it has ratified in relation to the protection of <b>vulnerable</b> <b>persons.</b> The research methodology utilized consisted of an analysis of international legal instruments in relation with the social environment. It is based on the sociological positivism and adopts universalism, cultural relativism, legal and institutional pluralism and the spiral of change as explanatory theories. On basis of the notion of vulnerability, four categories of persons that stand to benefit from international rules were selected : children, elderly persons, women and disabled persons. Due to the "intersectionality" between the different forms of marginalization, the thesis proposes an operational definition in general. This definition refers to a person in a precarious situation and with temporary or permanent weaknesses inherent to her nature, her living condition or physical or mental condition that - in interaction with socio-cultural barriers - makes her unable to protect her interests and exposes her to exclusion and external attacks threatening her autonomy, dignity or physical or psychological integrity and requires, in this respect, special protection measures. It evaluates the overall mechanism of protection of rights {{in the light of the}} universalism of Human Rights and cultural diversity, and demonstrates that the protection of <b>vulnerable</b> <b>persons</b> is the responsibility of the whole society. Even if the State remains a key actor and acts on the basis of national solidarity, a lead role is also played by the international community that contributes in the context of collective responsibility to the implementation of protection rules of <b>vulnerable</b> <b>persons</b> in Cameroon. The obstacles to the full realization of the rights of <b>vulnerable</b> <b>persons</b> cannot be overrated. They suffer from persistence of many social and cultural constraints that become apparent in practices as child trafficking, labour, violence against women, early and forced marriages, genital mutilation, stigmatization of people with disabilities, or neglect of the elderly. Nevertheless the principles, institutions, and procedures put in place to ensure the implementation of international rules on the protection of <b>vulnerable</b> <b>persons</b> in Cameroon are in favour of a better social integration of such persons...|$|R
