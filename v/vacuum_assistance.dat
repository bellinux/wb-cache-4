40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{problem of}} void {{formation}} in composites processing {{is very important}} since the physical and mechanical properties {{as well as the}} finish of the product are strongly influenced by the presence of voids. Examples of properties that are adversely affected by voids are the strength and the weather resistance of the composite. The knowl-edge about void formation in the RTM process is still very limited compared to what is known about autoclave production of composites, and {{it is not clear whether}} the voids are created by diffusion growth, mechanical entrapment or some other mechanism. Our research has been concentrated on the influence of <b>vacuum</b> <b>assistance</b> on the void formation in RTM. The experiments were made in a flat mould with edge injection (uni-directional flow from one side to the other) in which the vacuum level could be varied from atmospheric pressure to about 1 kPa (10 mbar). The total flow length was 0. 55 m in all experiments. The void volume fraction was determined with optical microscopy and image analysis and it was found that most of the voids were concentrated to a small area close to the flow front. The influence of vacuum was that the maximum void content and the size of the region with voids decreased with increasing <b>vacuum</b> <b>assistance.</b> The qualita-tive behavior can be explained with a simple theory based on the ideal gas law and the assumption that the voids are created by mechanical entrapment...|$|E

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis focus on the flow taking place in two industrialmanufacturing methods for composite manufacturing. The first method underinvestigation is compression moulding of Sheet Moulding Compound (SMC). With this method, SMC prepreg are stacked {{and placed in a}} heated mould toolwhich then is closed and held under pressure until the part has cured. Thismethod can be used to manufacture large quantities since the cycle time is short. The drawbacks with the method include pores at the surface causing largervisual defects such as blowouts if the part is painted and relatively poormechanical properties as compared to composites made out of continuous fibres. The aim of this work has been to increase the understanding of the flow that isgenerated during the filling of the mould and how this affects defects such aspores. This has been done experimentally with a circular moulding toolequipped with pressure sensors and <b>vacuum</b> <b>assistance</b> capability. The utilisedpress allowed different temperatures and closure velocities to be used. Thequality of the moulded experimental SMC plates was quantified with differentmethods. Pressure sensors revealed the pressure inside the mould and the flowbehaviour could for example be analysed with image analysis of plates mouldedwith multi-coloured SMC. The relative void content was measured with a highvoltage insulation test. The experiments showed that SMC that had flowed alarger distance had less voids than SMC that still was in the centre. Investigations of the coloured SMC indicate that a high closing velocity (10 mms- 1) of the mould gives a more homogenous flow and also that by applyingvacuum assistance, a more homogenous flow is achieved with low closingvelocity (2. 5 mm s- 1). Interestingly the settings that resulted in a morehomogenous flow also resulted in less voids, indicating that a more homogenous flow should be sought for if a low amount of voids is desired. The setting that gave overall best result was to use <b>vacuum</b> <b>assistance</b> (75 % vacuum), the low mould temperature (144 °C vs. 154 °C) and low velocity. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>assistance</b> also seemed to prevent a back pressure inside the closed mould tool since the press was able to compress further with constant velocity with <b>vacuum</b> <b>assistance.</b> In addition to the experimental work, non-Newtonian viscosity models for SMC have been developed for Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations which could predict the pressure at different closing velocities. The models are complex, but the one thing that seemed to be most important in order to predict accurate pressure at different closing velocities was to allow the bulk material to behave shear thinning. Along with the models, a method of finding unknown constants is presented which allows the models to be used for various SMCs without knowledge about their real material properties. In addition to the experimental work with SMC, the behaviour of bubbles in a non-Newtonian fluid during compression was investigated experimentally with Particle Image Velocimetry and the bubble motion was furthermore also analytically modelledand the results were coupled to the experiment results.

This upsurge, coupled with a decreasing willingness to allow vaginal birth after cesarean section, has resulted in an expansion of the use of <b>vacuum</b> <b>assistance</b> to safely extract the fetal head. By avoiding the use of a delivering hand or forceps blade, the volume being delivered through the uterine incision can be decreased when the vacuum is used properly.

Maternal discomfort related to excessive fundal pressure may also be lessened. To minimize the risk of neonatal morbidity, proper cup placement over the “flexion point” remains essential to maintain vacuum integrity and reduce the chance of inadvertent detachment and uterine extensions.

CB outperforms FNAC on almost all parameters of diagnostic accuracy [17]. Long-throw 14 -G needles produce specimens of approximately 30  mg and outperform smaller gauges (18  G, 16  G) of CB. When sampling microcalcifications, all CB specimens must undergo radiography to confirm that representative calcification has been sampled. Bagnall et al. [18] recommended that at least three flecks of calcification be seen in at least two cores and preferably five flecks or more should be seen in three cores. Diagnostic accuracy will depend upon the proportion of a cluster of microcalcification that is sampled and, as CB rarely removed an entire cluster, this {{led to the development of}} biopsy devices using <b>vacuum</b> <b>assistance</b> to deliver ever larger volumes of tissue.

40|$|The CAFE {{regulations}} {{will require}} {{average fuel consumption}} of cars and light duty trucks to be reduced from 27 mpg to 54. 5 mpg by 2025. In order to reach this requirement, automakers have to improve both the vehicle powertrain efficiency and the vehicle weight. Polymer composite materials are a preferred alternative to achieve the needed weight reduction by combining a higher strength to weight ratio than steel and aluminum, superior fatigue and corrosion resistance than metal and very good crashworthiness characteristics. However, high throughput and cost effective composite manufacturing processes are essential for high performance fibre reinforced polymer composites to penetrate the automotive market to their full potential. High Pressure Resin Transfer Moulding (HP-RTM) process is a new process based on the Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM) technology that enables the processing of very reactive resins in very short cycle times (25, 000 parts per year) with various types of reinforcement (glass, carbon, natural fibre).

40|$|International audienceComposite {{materials}} often {{suffer from}} process-induced defects such as voids that lower their overall performance and thus limit their wider application. Void formation mechanisms and detrimental effects of voids on mechanical properties of composite parts {{have been studied}} extensively. In contrast, limited void reduction strategies are available for the industry. In this study, post-cure compression is proposed as a void reduction technique for thermosetting composites. A resin transfer molded composite disk is fabricated by injecting a thermosetting resin into center-gated mold cavity preloaded with randomly-oriented glass fiber preform. After cure, void content is studied at 25. 4 mm (1 ") and 50. 8 mm (2 ") away from the injection gate of the 76. 2 mm (3 ") -radius composite disk. Two adjacent samples are obtained from each location; the first is utilized as a baseline {{and the second is}} compressed at 70 °C, slightly above the glass transition temperature, until reaching 6 % compression in thickness. Void content, shape and size in each specimen are obtained via microscopic image analysis. Resulting level of voids as well as void morphologies from the four samples are compared in order to assess post-cure compression effects. Initial void content is measured at 2. 13 %. Post-cure compression is observed to induce a 37. 8 % decrease in void content down to 1. 33 %. Considerable difference is also observed in void morphology. Voids become smaller after compression with almost 27 % decrease in the average void size, from 44. 7 µm down to 32. 7 µm. With respect to void shape, voids become more elongated after compression as the so-called shape ratio decreases from 0. 85 to 0. 73. Circular voids dropped from 42. 3 % in the baselines to 32. 7 % in the compressed samples. In contrast, elliptical and irregular void frequencies increased by 8. 3 and 56. 7 %, respectively. Post-cure compression is thus found to be applicable to thermosetting composites for void reduction.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{interest}} {{has grown in}} the use of composite components within the automotive industry. Fibre reinforced plastic (FRP) components are of particular interest to the industry, since lower tooling costs and part consolidation can be utilised, whilst lighter, stiffer components can be produced. Several methods are available to produce FRP components at high volumes, including compression moulding (using dough and sheet moulding compounds), reinforced reaction injection moulding (RRIM) and liquid moulding processes (resin transfer moulding (RTM) and structural reaction injection moulding (SRIM)). RTM is a closed mould process, which is widely used to produce components economically in low volumes using matched moulds to produce two good surfaces. The absence of a high volume manufacturing technology, however, has impeded the acceptance and advance of RTM within the automotive industry. A research programme was established at the University of Nottingham to address the problems {{associated with the use of}} RTM for high volume manufacture. This programme has considered the topics of process technology, processing characteristics of polyester resin systems and fibre preforms, fibre wet-out and interfacial bonding, mould design, microwave pre-heating of reactive resin systems and process modelling. This thesis concerns the research which was undertaken to identify the causes of void formation during the impregnation and polymerisation stages of RTM, and methods of reducing the final void content within the component. The impregnation phase of the RTM process was identified as being the stage where the majority of voids were formed. A study of oil impregnation (having a similar viscosity to that of resin) into reinforcement was undertaken to determine the reasons for uneven flow and air entrapment. The dry reinforcements were studied to assess the microstructure of the preforms in order to determine reasons for obstruction of the resin flow. Fabric stitching, thermoplastic binder and size deposits were identified as potential causes of flow impediment. Fibre orientation and preform stacking were also assumed to assist in the development of uneven flow, leading to air entrapment. A major factor determining the formation of microvoids within fibre bundles was identified as the transverse impregnation of resin into high Tex fibre bundles. The major moulding process variables of injection pressure, vent pressure, fibre volume fraction, mould temperature and resin pre-heating have been assessed, to determine their effect on the void content within unidirectional and CFRM reinforced polyester laminates. It was observed that <b>vacuum</b> <b>assistance</b> during impregnation reduced void formation, although higher exotherm pressures and the possibility of monomer boiling arise from its use. A simple impregnation model was developed to assess the microscopic impregnation rates between fibre bundles, in the capillary between fibres and transversely into fibre bundles. The results from this model were compared with actual moulding histories. The findings of the overall work are discussed and suggestions proposed for the reduction of void content in RTM automotive components...|$|E
40|$|It {{is known}} that a newly formed glass {{container}} will only possess a very small fraction of its theoretical strength. This suggests that damage occurs {{on the surface of}} the glass melt during the forming process due to glass to mould contact and hot glass handling. It might be expected that any damage inflicted on the surface of a glass article during manufacture would heal at the elevated manufacturing temperatures used, however this does not appear to be true. Therefore, the actual mechanism by which glass strength is reduced during forming needs to be fully understood and the work presented in this thesis addresses this problem. Experiments, therefore, have been carried out here which simulate the formation of glass articles using an experimental pressing rig by systematically altering processing parameters such as the mould material, surface fmish of the mould, pressing temperature and atmosphere. Processing parameters that are used industrially for the formation of glass containers were generally reproduced wherever possible in order to investigate the glass-to-mould interaction. The interaction of both a cast iron mould material and carbon-carbon composite materials with a soda-lime-silica glass were examined using the techniques of scanning electron microscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy in order to determine the type and extent of surface damage formed. The surfaces of the pressed glass samples made were found to contain defects of embedded particles and indented dimples. The embedded particles found were usually due to bulk material transfer from the plunger material used. The texture found {{on the surface of the}} pressed glass samples was found to be directly affected by the surface fmish of the plunger. Pressing glass samples using a cast iron plunger at an initial plunger temperature below 450 °C resulted in a randomly rippled 'chilled' surface. As the initial temperature of the plunger was increased, the surface texture of the pressed glass became a closer replica of the plunger surface. The use of <b>vacuum</b> <b>assistance</b> to form the glass samples also resulted in the surface of the pressed glass becoming a closer replica of the original plunger surface, even at lower pressing temperatures. The surfaces of the cast iron and carbon-carbon composite plungers appeared to have been affected by the initial plunger temperatures used. As the initial pressing temperature was increased, the amount of oxidation for both material types increased. In the case of the carbon-carbon composite materials investigated, both the matrix and fibres were found to have broken down at the pressing temperatures used. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, of the pressed glass surfaces and the plunger materials indicated that sodium ions had migrated from the glass melt to the plunger surface during forming...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{excellent}} {{properties and}} relatively low material and manufacturing costs, {{the use of}} fibre reinforced polymer composites have increased during the last decades. One method that is suitable for large scale productions of e. g. lightweight vehicle components is compression moulding of sheet moulding compound (SMC). Although the technique has been considerably improved since it first was introduced, some further improvements need to be done. The main reason why it has not come in wider use in the vehicle industry is unsatisfactory conditions of the surface finish of parts manufactured due to voids. In this work, experiments and numerical simulations has been performed {{in order to increase}} the knowledge of the flow behaviour during the compression moulding process and how the flow affect the quality of the finished product. A process parameter experiment of the compression moulding phase, carried out with a design of experiment approach, was performed in order to investigate the effect of <b>vacuum</b> <b>assistance,</b> mould temperature and ram velocity on the void transport and flow behaviour for SMC. The relative amount of voids has been quantified with a high voltage insulation test and the flow behaviour has been quantified with image analysis of samples moulded with coloured SMC. In conclusion, the setting of high vacuum, low ram velocity and low mould temperature creates a homogeneous flow and minimises the amount of voids. In order to further increase the understanding of void removal during compression moulding, a model experiment was performed where a non-Newtonian fluid (grease) with added bubbles was compressed between two plates whereas the motion of the bubbles were tracked and evaluated using Particle Image Velocimetry. The bubble motion was furthermore analytically modelled and coupled to the experimental results. The experiments reveal an increase in bubble speed compared to the surrounding grease during the compression of the plates. During the latter stage of the compression, the particles change form from initially being approximately spherical, to have the characteristic form of a falling raindrop. The change in form coincides with the increase in speed of the bubble. The developed analytical model supports the shown development in the experiments. A full general solution comprising an arbitrary value of the Power Law exponent, for the velocity fraction coefficient representing the relative bubble speed, is however not covered at the present stage. Finally, the commercial software Ansys CFX were used to perform computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling of the flow during compression moulding with a two different multiphase models. The first model treats the flow of SMC as purely extensional and dependent on temperature, fibre volume fraction and strain rate. While the other one sees the flow as mainly extensional but also with thin shear layers near the surfaces of the moulding tool. Where the viscosity, in addition to temperature, fibre volume fraction and strain rate, also is dependant on shear strain rate. Of the two models, the latter seems to be more robust in modelling the pressure during moulding.

40|$|There is an ever {{increasing}} need for clean, portable energy devices, such as fuel cells and high energy batteries to replace or reduce the world's dependence on fossil fuels. The continued development of thin-film solid polymer electrolytes with improved mechanical and ion transport properties {{is critical for}} the further advancement of such electrochemical energy devices. For hydrogen and methanol fuel cells, the proton exchange membrane (PEM) has to have high protonic conductivity, low fuel crossover, and be mechanically and chemically stable. In particular, for direct methanol fuel cells and for high temperature (> 100 °C), low relative humidity (< 60 % RH) hydrogen fuel cells, the current industrial standard PEM, Nafion®, does not have all the required attributes. Layer-by-Layer (LbL) assembly allows for the controlled deposition of alternating polyelectrolytes at the nanometer scale. This technique {{can be used with}} highly proton conductive water soluble polymers as well as doped polymers. In addition, LbL assembly can be used to coat a variety of substrates of various shapes and sizes. An LbL system composed of poly(diallyl dimethyl ammonium chloride) (PDAC) and sulfonated poly(2, 6 -dimethyl 1, 4 - phenylene oxide) (sPPO) has shown to have relatively high proton conductivity and very low methanol permeability compared to that of Nafion@, but lacking in mechanical strength when hydrated and losing significant proton conductivity at lower RH conditions. Herein this thesis work describes the selection, optimization, and utilization of multilayer systems and system composites as the PEM in hydrogen and methanol fuel cells, focusing on improving and understanding the improvements to the properties of layer-by-layer films and composite membranes for fuel cell applications by targeting two main areas: the mechanical properties and the conductive properties. In addition, characterization and film analysis work was done to correlate and explain how the changing of the LbL system and fabrication techniques impacted the membrane's mechanical and conductive properties. First, the mechanical strength and stability were greatly improved by spray-assembling the films on an electrospun fiber mat to form a composite membrane. Spray-LbL assembly was performed both with and without <b>vacuum</b> <b>assistance,</b> which had complementary effects on the film properties. By combining these techniques, composite membranes with methanol permeability twenty times lower than Nafion® and through-plane proton selectivity five times greater than Nafion@ were fabricated. In addition, the planar swelling of the composite membranes in water was significantly reduced. This large reduction in swelling is hypothesized to be due to the electrostatic interaction of the LbL system with the underlying electrospun fibers and would not occur in a typical polymer blend. Second, to improve the conductivity of the LbL films overall and specifically at lower RH conditions, two approaches were used. In the first approach, divalent salts were added to the polyanion solution to provide a stronger shielding effect than monovalent salts. The divalent salts allowed for ion bridging and increased both the number and the mobility of protons associated with sulfonic acid groups in the LbL film; thus increasing the film's conductivity. Through optimization of salt type and concentration, the protonic conductivity of PDAC/sPPO films was increased fourfold, and the humidity dependence of the conductivity was decreased. In the second approach, PDAC was replaced with a phosphoric-acid-doped polymer, poly(2 - vinyl pyridine) (P 2 VP). The phosphoric acid concentration in the LbL film and the number of free sulfonic acid groups could be controlled post film fabrication by changing the concentration of the phosphoric acid dopant. The resulting P 2 VP/sPPO films exhibited greater conductivity than similarly doped P 2 VP films and under stronger doping conditions (0. 4 M - 1. 0 M phosphoric acid), the film's conductivity increases seventy-fivefold (110 mS/cm at 50 % RH at room temperature), resulting in a conductivity an order of magnitude greater than Nafion®. The large increases in conductivity, particularly at low RH conditions further support a recently reported and very promising proton transport mechanism that utilizes both phosphoric and sulfonic acid groups. by David ShinRen Liu.
