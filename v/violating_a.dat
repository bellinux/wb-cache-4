5|$|Maryland was sanctioned for <b>violating</b> <b>a</b> Southern Conference rule, passed {{halfway through}} the 1951 season, that banned postseason play. The punishment, for {{participating}} in the Sugar Bowl, disallowed the Terrapins from playing any conference games during the 1952 season. This compelled Maryland to schedule all but three games on the road.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} ACLU {{case of the}} 1920s was Gitlow v.

Although the Supreme Court did not overturn Gitlow's conviction, it adopted the ACLU's stance (later termed the incorporation doctrine) that the First Amendment freedom of speech applied to state laws, as well as federal laws.|$|E
5|$|Not in Front of the Children {{explores the}} {{development}} of U.S. case law with different standards of censorship for children and adults. The author describes a 1968 Supreme Court of the United States case, Ginsberg v. New York, where the court upheld a law preventing minors from viewing sexually explicit media. Sam Ginsberg and his wife managed a diner in Bellmore, New York. A mother sent her 16-year-old son to buy two adult magazines at the diner, creating a situation where Ginsberg would be prosecuted. Ginsberg was convicted of <b>violating</b> <b>a</b> New York State law which forbade selling magazines with pictures of nude women to minors.|$|E
40|$|We present {{empirical}} evidence on acquirer firms that have violated or {{are about to}} <b>violate</b> <b>a</b> loan covenant within four quarters of undergoing an acquisition. We find that firms that <b>violate</b> <b>a</b> covenant within the four quarters before the acquisition announcement have the highest announcement period abnormal returns, while firms that <b>violate</b> <b>a</b> covenant within the four quarters after the acquisition announcement but not within the four quarters before it have the sharpest decline in abnormal returns after the acquisition announcement. Also, firms that violate or are about to <b>violate</b> <b>a</b> loan covenant within four quarters have a significantly lower mean target firm deal size than those that have not violated covenants within those time periods. Such results indicate that when firms violate or are about to <b>violate</b> <b>a</b> loan covenant, corporate governance shifts in power cause creditors to enforce stricter rules on management’s actions, {{making sure that the}} acquisitions that management pursues adds to firm value...|$|R

5|$|The Tennessee Volunteers {{entered the}} 2009 season {{following}} a 2008 campaign {{that ended with}} a bowl-ineligible 5-7 record. After the 2008 season ended, Tennessee fired head coach Phillip Fulmer and replaced him with Lane Kiffin, who promised to turn the program around. Kiffin made an offseason splash by breaking the social norms among SEC head football coaches and <b>violating</b> <b>a</b> handful of NCAA rules. In a season-opening win over Western Kentucky, Kiffin appeared {{to have made a}} difference for Tennessee, as the Volunteers had their largest margin of victory in nine years.|$|E
5|$|The Little Ice Age {{may have}} reduced the {{population}} of the great auk by exposing more of their breeding islands to predation by polar bears, but massive exploitation by humans for their down drastically reduced the population. By the mid-sixteenth century, the nesting colonies along the European side of the Atlantic were nearly all eliminated by humans killing this bird for its down, which was used to make pillows. In 1553, the great auk received its first official protection, and in 1794 Great Britain banned the killing of this species for its feathers. In St. John's, those <b>violating</b> <b>a</b> 1775 law banning hunting the great auk for its feathers or eggs were publicly flogged, though hunting for use as fishing bait was still permitted. On the North American side, eider down initially was preferred, but once the eiders were nearly driven to extinction in the 1770s, down collectors switched to the great auk {{at the same time that}} hunting for food, fishing bait, and oil decreased.|$|E

40|$|Culturally {{counterintuitive}} {{concepts are}} ideas that <b>violate</b> <b>a</b> {{small number of}} justifiable expectations raised by shared beliefs {{of a group of}} people. Previous studies have shown that ideas that <b>violate</b> <b>a</b> small number of expectations are better remembered by people than ideas that conform to their expectations or ideas that <b>violate</b> <b>a</b> large number of people’s expectations. However, as counterintuitive ideas become embedded in a group’s belief-system they lose their memorability advantages and must change to regain those advantages. This article presents two case studies conducted to better understand the dynamics of the diffusion of information. It outlines how a cognition and culture approach can help us understand cultural dynamics and offers new insights into rumor diffusion and new religious movement splits...|$|R
