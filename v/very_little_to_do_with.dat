On 1 May, he embarked for Europe to join the New Zealand Division. However, during transit his transport ship was unexpectedly diverted to Egypt. For two months, his contingent was based at the training camp of the Australian Imperial Force at Tel-el-Kebir but had <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> only a few hours of training each day. The 12th Reinforcement left in July for Sling Camp in England, where it underwent more intense training.|$|E
25|$|Non Partisan denotes {{that the}} {{politician}} concerned {{is not known}} to have been associated with a party (not necessarily that he was not). It should be noted that whilst Whig and Tory societies in the city continued to nominate candidates in {{the last half of the}} 18th century, the electoral labels used in Bristol had <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> what the MPs did in national politics.|$|E
25|$|In October 1834 a great fire {{destroyed}} {{much of the}} Palace of Westminster, which Adelaide considered divine retribution for {{the vagaries}} of reform. When the Whig ministry of Lord Melbourne was dismissed by the King, The Times newspaper blamed the Queen's influence, though {{she seems to have}} had <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> it. Influenced by her similarly reactionary brother-in-law, the Duke of Cumberland, she did write to the King against reform of the Church of Ireland.|$|E

25|$|However, some {{computational}} {{problems are}} easier to analyze in terms of more unusual resources. For example, a non-deterministic Turing machine is a computational model that is allowed to branch out to check many different possibilities at once. The non-deterministic Turing machine has <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> how we physically want to compute algorithms, but its branching exactly captures many of the mathematical models we want to analyze, so that non-deterministic time {{is a very important}} resource in analyzing computational problems.|$|E
25|$|The idea of {{emptiness}} {{as lack of}} inherent existence has <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> what the Buddha himself said about emptiness. His teachings on emptiness — {{as reported in the}} earliest Buddhist texts, the Pali Canon — deal directly with actions and their results, with issues of pleasure and pain. To understand and experience emptiness in line with these teachings requires not philosophical sophistication, but a personal integrity willing to admit the actual motivations behind your actions and the actual benefits and harm they cause.|$|E
25|$|There {{were also}} two Knightmare {{computer}} games released: {{the first was}} in 1987, released on the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, and Commodore 64; and the second Knightmare game in 1991, released on the Amiga and Atari ST. A PC version was proposed for 1995, but the plan was abandoned when the series finished. The latter game was an RPG similar to the Dungeon Master and Eye Of The Beholder games which, whilst well received at the time, had <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the TV series besides the fantasy setting.|$|E
50|$|Current {{movies were}} shown each week. National and {{religious}} holidays were observed, and music concerts were given regularly. Elaborate stage plays were produced.

25|$|Of all the {{classical}} philosophers, however, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle are generally {{considered the most}} important and influential. Socrates did not write any books himself and modern scholars debate whether or not Plato's portrayal of him is accurate. Some scholars contend that many of his ideas, or at least a vague approximation of them, are expressed in Plato's early socratic dialogues. Meanwhile, other scholars have argued that Plato's portrayal of Socrates is merely a fictional representation intended to expound Plato's own opinions who has <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the historical figure of the same name. The debate over the extent to which Plato's portrayal of Socrates represents the actual Socrates's ideas is known as the Socratic problem.|$|E
25|$|Franzen {{writes for}} The New Yorker magazine. His 1996 Harper's essay Perchance to Dream bemoaned {{the state of}} {{contemporary}} literature. Oprah Winfrey's book club selection in 2001 of The Corrections led to a much publicized feud with the talk show host. In recent years, Franzen has become recognized for his opinions on everything from social networking services such as Twitter ("the ultimate irresponsible medium") {{and the proliferation of}} e-books ("just not permanent enough") to the disintegration of Europe ("The people making the decisions in Europe are bankers. The technicians of finance are making the decisions there. It has <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> democracy or the will of the people") and the self-destruction of America ("almost a rogue state").|$|E
25|$|In 1963 Benoit Mandelbrot {{analyzed}} the variations of cotton prices on a time series starting in 1900. There were two important findings. First, price movements had <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> a normal distribution {{in which the}} bulk of the observations lies close to the mean (68% of the data are within one standard deviation). Instead, the data showed a great frequency of extreme variations. Second, price variations followed patterns that were indifferent to scale: the curve described by price changes for a single day was similar to a month’s curve. Surprisingly, these patterns of self-similarity were present during the entire period 1900-1960, a violent epoch that had seen a Great Depression and two world wars. Mandelbrot used his fractal theory to explain the presence of extreme events in Wall Street. In 2004 he published his book on the “misbehavior” of financial markets - The (Mis)behavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Risk, Ruin, and Reward. The basic idea that relates fractals to financial markets is that the probability of experiencing extreme fluctuations (like the ones triggered by herd behavior) is greater than what conventional wisdom wants us to believe. This of course delivers a more accurate vision of risk in the world of finance. The central objective in financial markets is to maximize income for a given level of risk. Standard models for this are {{based on the premise that}} the probability of extreme variations of asset prices is very low.|$|E

500|$|In 1996, Chris Carter {{declared}} [...] "One Breath" [...] {{to be one}} of the series' {{most popular}} episodes. Co-writer James Wong also enjoyed the episode, saying [...] "I really love that show". Director R. W. Goodwin said of the episode, [...] "What's so unusual about [...] "One Breath" [...] is that it had <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> our usual X-File stuff.

500|$|Vidya {{followed}} {{the success of}} Paa with the Vishal Bhardwaj-produced Ishqiya (2010), a black comedy directed by debutant Abhishek Chaubey; co-starring Naseeruddin Shah, Arshad Warsi, and Salman Shahid. Vidya's role {{was that of the}} sexually manipulative Krishna Verma. Vidya described her character as [...] "an epitome of grey" [...] and a departure from the conventional portrayal of women in cinema. In preparation for her part, she undertook professional training to speak in the local Uttar Pradesh-dialect. The feature as well as her performance received critical acclaim. Anupama Chopra of NDTV stated, [...] "Vidya Balan's smoldering looks scorch the screen even as her eyes hint at tragedy. She proves that she is miles ahead of the cookie cutter Barbie dolls that clutter Bollywood and that sensuality has <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> showing skin." [...] Her work in the film earned Vidya a Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress, a second consecutive Best Actress award at Screen and a nomination for Best Actress at Filmfare.|$|E

However, Springfield Elementary School stays open regardless of the storm, even though every other local school closes. Only some students, including the classmates of Bart and Lisa, show up while Skinner and Willie are the only faculty members at the school that day. To pass the time, Skinner plays his professed favourite film, a very low-budget, long-running, 1938 holiday film called The Christmas That Almost Wasn't, But Then Was, which Lisa notices has <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> Christmas. By the time the movie is finally over, it is already {{the end of the school}} day, and Skinner lets the kids go home--however, Skinner and the students quickly realize that over the course of the day, the snow has piled up tremendously, leaving them and Groundskeeper Willie trapped inside the school, much to the horror of the kids.|$|E

Stephen Benko states that some depictions of Mary and Jesus share similarities with extant ancient Egyptian art depictions of Horus and Isis. Egyptologist Erik Hornung wrote that [...] "There was an obvious analogy between the Horus child and the baby Jesus and the care they received from their sacred mothers; long before Christianity, Isis had borne the epithet 'mother of the god.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|The CRTC is {{sometimes}} {{blamed for the}} current state of the mobile phone industry in Canada, in which there are only three national mobile network operators – Bell Mobility, Telus Mobility, and Rogers Wireless – as well as a handful of MVNOs operating on these networks. In fact, the commission has <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the regulation of mobile phone service, outside of [...] "undue preference" [...] issues (for example, a carrier offering a superior rate or service to some subscribers and not others without a good reason). It does not regulate service rates, service quality, or other business practices, and commission approval is not necessary for wireless provider sales or mergers as in the broadcasting industry. Moreover, it does not deal with the availability of spectrum for mobile phone service, which is part of the Industry Canada mandate, nor the maintenance of competition, which is largely the responsibility of The Competition Bureau.|$|E
2500|$|Historically, and {{possibly}} {{related to the}} [...] "Reefer Madness" [...] legend, some people (particularly Americans) had confused cannabis with Jimson weed (Datura stramonium). Jimson weed, which grows wild in the United States and several other countries, is a potent deliriant which can cause true hallucinations and delusions that are believed by the user to be real, {{as opposed to the}} pseudohallucinations and perceptual distortions typically caused by cannabis. Confusion could have resulted from the fact that Daturas common name contains the word [...] "weed," [...] which is also a slang term for cannabis, and the fact that both plants (as well as others) have been given the moniker [...] "locoweed" [...] {{in the first half of}} the 20th century. [...] Aside from these superficial similarities, the two plants are not related and have <b>very</b> <b>little</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> one another, and thus should not be confused. [...] Jimson weed is highly toxic and can cause delirium, confusion, hallucinations, blurred vision, photophobia, dry mouth, urinary retention, hyperthermia, incoordination, hypertension, and rapid heartbeat among other effects. [...] An overdose (or suspected overdose) on this substance is a medical emergency, as it can cause seizures, coma, or death by cardiac arrest.|$|E
