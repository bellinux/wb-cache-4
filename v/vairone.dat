50|$|There are 11 reptile and 8 {{amphibian}} species. There are Central European species (fire salamander, yellow-bellied toad, smooth snake), Palearctic (common toad, European green toad, common frog), Euro-Siberian (European tree frog, common European viper, grass snake, viviparous lizard), Irano-Turanian (marsh frog), Southern European (agile frog), Euro-Mediterranean (European green lizard), Mediterranean (common wall lizard) and Balkan (Erhard's wall lizard). The ichthyofauna includes 6 fish species: common minnow, European eel (considered extinct), western <b>vairone,</b> brown trout, {{rainbow trout}} and brook trout. The {{limited number of}} species {{is determined by the}} high altitude of the park. The glacial lakes, streams and upper river courses are inhabited by few fish species.

40|$|Italian {{freshwater}} fish farming {{is dominated by}} the production of salmonids, in particular rainbow trout. During the last decade trout production in Italy declined steadily for various reasons and trout farmers might be interested in the domestication of new species. Diversification is well studied for Mediterranean marine fish farming but not yet for freshwater one. In this scenario, {{it may be possible to}} establish new cold water adapted species for a niche market. The key aspects to be considered for introduction of new species are economical (production costs and market demand) and biological (easy adaptation to rearing conditions, endemic species, etc.). <b>Vairone</b> Telestes muticellus (Bonaparte 1837) and bleak Alburnus alburnus alborella (De Filippi 1844) are two small cyprinids that seem to be potential candidates for diversification in North Italian fish farms. Their feeding and social habits, being not strictly predators and showing strong gregariousness, can facilitate the adaptation to captive rearing and domestication processes, too. Moreover, they are reophilic, moderately cold {{freshwater fish}} and autochthonous in the Po valley basin. Market potentials may be both consumption as food and as live bait for anglers. The aim of this study was a preliminary evaluation of the adaptability of <b>vairone</b> and bleak to captive rearing conditions and to an artificial diet. After two months of adaptation to experimental conditions, 95 specimens of <b>vairone</b> and 39 bleaks (mean body weight 0. 52 g and 0. 63 g, respectively) caught from the wild were stabulated in two 1 m x 1 m, 150 l tanks, supplied with well water (Temperature: 11. 5 ± 2. 0 °C; Dissolved oxygen: 10. 8 ± 0. 5 mg/l; pH: 8. 04 ± 0. 12; TAN: 0. 02 ± 0. 01 mg/l; NO 2 : < 0. 02 mg/l) A practical diet was formulated for both species according to carp nutrient requirements (dry matter 93. 6...|$|E
40|$|The phylogeographic {{structure}} of <b>vairone</b> (Telestes muticellus), a primary freshwater fish endangered {{in a large}} part of its distributional range, was assessed: i) to reconstruct the complex dispersion pattern in the upper Tyrrhenian hydrographic basins of Ligury, actually not recognised as peri-Mediterranean ichthyogeographic district, and ii) to evidence the shape of population genetic structure as useful tool for future conservation strategies. A partial fragment of mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b (497 bp) was sequenced in 109 specimens sampled from 8 populations, along an east-west geographic gradient. Fourteen haplotypes were identified, confirming the evolutionary distance between the two co-generic species: T. muticellus as ‘Ligurian’ clade and T. souffia as ‘French’ clade. The Nested Clade Analysis (NCA), the population genetic variability and population structure suggested a natural colonization occurred throughout the crossing of Alpine and Apennine watershed. The hierarchical Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) confirmed a geographic distinction between the populations from western (WTL) and from eastern (ETL) Tyrrhenian basins of Ligury colonised through the river capture processes along the Maritime Alpine watershed (Padano-Venetian district) and along the Apennine watershed (Tuscano-Latium district), respectively.

40|$|Eleven {{microsatellites}} {{were isolated}} from the <b>vairone</b> Leuciscus souffia (Risso 1826), an endangered fish that inhabits river systems {{in and around the}} Alps in Europe. The level of genetic diversity was assessed in 29 individuals of the subspecies L. s. souffia, and their variability was further estimated in seven individuals of a different subspecies, L. s. muticellus Eight of these microsatellite loci were also applied to seven closely related cyprinid species. Availability of the reported microsatellite loci will facilitate the investigation of population genetic structure of these species with applications for the development of conservation strategies and phylogeographical approaches...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Owing to its {{independence}} from the main Central European drainage systems, the Italian freshwater fauna {{is characterized by a}} high degree of endemicity. Three main ichthyogeographic districts have been proposed in Italy. Yet, the validity of these regions has not been confirmed by phylogenetic and population genetic analyses and a phylogeographic scenario for Italy's primary freshwater fish fauna is still lacking. Here, we investigate the phylogeography of the Italian <b>vairone</b> (Telestes muticellus). Results We sampled 38 populations representing the species' entire distribution range and covering all relevant drainage systems, and genotyped 509 individuals at eight variable microsatellite loci. Applying various population genetic analyses, we identify five distinct groups of populations that are only partly in agreement with the proposed ichthyogeographic districts. Our group I, which is formed by specimens from Veneto and the Po River system draining into the Adriatic Sea, corresponds to the Padano-Venetian ichthyogeographic district (PV), except for two Middle Adriatic drainages, which we identify as a separate group (III). The Tuscano-Latium district (TL) is equivalent to our group V. A more complex picture emerges for the Ligurian drainages: populations from Central Liguria belong to group I, while populations from West (group II) and East Liguria (group IV) form their own groups, albeit with affinities to PV and TL, respectively. Conclusions We propose a phylogeographic scenario for T. muticellus in which an initial T. muticellus stock became isolated from the 'Alpine' clade and survived the various glaciation cycles in several refugia. These were situated in the Upper Adriatic (groups I and II), the Middle Adriatic (group III), (East) Liguria (group IV) and Tuscano-Latium (group V). The population structure in the <b>vairone</b> is, in principal, in agreement with the two main ichthyogeographic districts (PV and TL), except for the two populations in the Middle Adriatic, which we identify as additional major "district". </p...|$|E

Climatic oscillations during the Quaternary had an important effect on the actual distribution and the genetic structure of many freshwater fish species, especially in previously glaciated areas due to founder events (Bernatchez, 2001; Ramstad et al., 2004). In addition to natural events, human interactions (such as fisheries, habitat fragmentation and pollution) have imprinted the population genetic structure of many fish species in the recent past (Laroche & Durand, 2004). Combining population genetic data with geographical information, life-history traits of a species and data on past events such as climatic fluctuations or human interference can provide importan...|$|E
40|$|The phylogeographic {{pattern of}} <b>vairone</b> (Telestes muticellus) populations was {{assessed}} {{to test the}} biogeographic distinction of three peri-Mediterranean ichthyogeographic districts: Padano-Venetian (PV), Tuscano-Latium (TL) and Southern France (SF), evaluating the role of Alpine and Apennine barriers in shaping distinct evolutionary lineages. A fragment of mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b was sequenced in 153 specimens from 14 northwestern Italian populations, collected in 10 tributaries of Po River and in 4 rivers on the Tyrrhenian slope of Ligury. 32 haplotypes were identified. The phylogenetic analyses confirmed the presence of two distinct clades, an “Italian clade” (T. muticellus) and a “French clade” (T. souffia), showing an average genetic distance of 12. 9 % (± 1. 3 SD) and allopatric distribution. The NCA and AMOVA analyses revealed an isolated gene pool in eastern basins on the Tyrrhenian slope of Ligury. The phylogeographic findings suggest: i) the lack of permeability of Alpine barrier towards the dispersion across Italian and French hydrographical systems, ii) partial permeability of Mediterranean Alps and Apennines through river captures crossing lower watersheds...|$|E
