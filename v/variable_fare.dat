50|$|In sharp contrast, {{majority}} of the cities in Europe and Asia are heavily dependent on mass transit. Therefore, the {{majority of}} their transit budgets are used extensively on mass transit technologies, which enables these countries to install and maintain self-supporting and profitable variable pricing structures. Transit agencies that have instituted a more <b>variable</b> <b>fare</b> structure depending on distances or zones traveled have higher farebox ratios over those that rely on a flat-rate model. In addition, recent urban transit scholars agree that variable pricing methods on public transit would actually be a profitable business which can alleviate many municipal agencies' budget problems. For example, transit riders will be discouraged to travel longer distance due to increasing price as one travels further, reducing human congestion of mass transit riders who ride lengthier trips. On the other hand, an increased number of riders will opt to frequently use the transit system for multiple short and quick hop-on and hop-off trips as prices would be cheaper for shorter trips, which mass transit is better suited for. The downside however is that institution of variable-rate fares requires a high value initial investment in fare ticketing technologies {{such as the use of}} contactless smart cards, turnstiles or fare gates, automated ticket machines, as well as the IT infrastructure in which the return on investment may take years depending on the expected transit ridership volumes.|$|E

Tolls would be not a financial mechanism anymore, but a <b>variable</b> <b>fare</b> that the user pays as a reflection of time savings, the increase of travel time regularity, the increase of safety and comfort, etc. In a way, the tolls would represent a price for a service received by the users.

The model aims at maximizing the net economic benefit over the whole study horizon of time. It is shown that at equilibrium, the mode choice at aggregate demand level is governed by a multinomial exponential function, while for each mode, the generalized costs for all departure times that are actually used are identical. The generalized costs include the optimal <b>variable</b> <b>fares</b> and tolls imposed on transit mode and auto mode commuters, respectively; this transport pricing supports the system optimum as a user equilibrium.

40|$|Public {{transit systems}} differ from many other {{government}} enterprises {{in that they}} charge a fee, or fare, in much the way that private businesses charge for their services. Transit fares are typically of two sorts: flat or differentiated. For decades transportation scholars have argued in favor of flexible, differentiated transit fares, which vary by mode, distance, and/or time-of-day to reflect differences in the marginal costs of service provision (Cervero and Wachs 1982; Cervero 1981; Hodge 1995). Such fare policies, researchers contend, could greatly increase the efficiency, efficacy, and equity of transit service. Research on transit costs suggests that short, off-peak trips tend to be relatively inexpensive to provide, while longer, peak-period trips are more expensive (Taylor, Garrett, and Iseki 2000). Accordingly, varying fares to reflect these differences in costs would encourage passengers to consume more inexpensive-to-serve trips, and be more judicious in consuming more expensive-to-serve trips, thereby increasing the cost-effectiveness of transit service.   Recent technological advances, particularly smart cards, have greatly reduced the operational and administrative obstacles to charging differentiated time- or distance-based fares. However, despite an established body {{of research on the}} potential benefits of flexible fares, relatively few transit agencies employ them, and {{over the past two decades}} many have actually moved away from <b>variable</b> <b>fare</b> structures and toward simpler fares by dropping zonebased fares. And while many U. S. transit agencies that have adopted smart card technology, very few of these adopting agencies have moved toward variable fares.   The increasingly widespread implementation of smart farecards makes implementing variable pricing far easier and more reliable than in years past. As smart cards become more ubiquitous, will transit systems gradually reverse course and begin implementing differentiated fares? Will political and institutional resistance to variable pricing hold firm, suggesting that implementation was never the principal obstacle? Or have flat fares become so thoroughly inculcated in transit practice that most transit managers are unaware of the now decades old research on the benefits of differentiated fares? This report explores these questions.   To better understand motivations for fare changes and the potential for implementing marginal cost pricing, we reviewed the literature on transit fares and pricing, conducted indepth interviews with California transit officials, and administered a nationwide survey of transit agency CEOs, planners and analysts, and board members on the goals that shape fare policies. Collectively, these interviews and survey find that, with respect to fare policies, transit agencies tend to be reactive to budgetary pressures and reluctant to change fare structures when changing fare levels. Despite this observed lack of strategic thinking with respect to fares, we do see in our survey data some, albeit limited, interest in distance- and time-based fares, especially among agencies that have or soon will introduce smart cards. But any opportunities to move toward differentiated fares created by smartcard adoption are constrained by an industry where simple, flat fares are the norm and were transit managers are risk-averse and seek to minimize public scrutiny and criticism. Smart cards, in other words, are a necessary but not sufficient means of fare innovation in public transit. Beyond this general observation, our interview and survey results collectively suggest three specific findings with respect to transit fare setting:  1. With respect to fare policies, transit agencies tend to be reactive to budgetary pressures and reluctant to change fare structures when changing fare levels.   Our survey results find that systematic evaluations of fare policies are subject to and often displaced by the immediate needs of an agency’s budget. Respondents indicated that the primary consideration for changing fares is budgetary need, implying a focus on near-term responses to fiscal shortfalls in setting fare policies. Changing fare policies to improve farebox recovery ratios, possibly through marginal cost pricing, which research suggests may improve a given agency’s fiscal health over the long term received considerably less consideration. Rational (i. e., cost- or criteria-based) fare setting policies are viewed as important, but in practice the setting of transit fares appears to be almost exclusively budget-driven and fare increases are more often than not induced by fiscal crises. Because transit systems depend so heavily on subsidies, large swings in tax revenues – especially during the current, prolonged economic downturn – can make transit budgets volatile. When rising costs and/or cuts in subsidies threaten service, fare increases are often put on the table in conjunction with service cuts – at what some would argue is precisely the wrong time. While economists have long asserted the superiority of cost-based pricing on economic efficiency grounds, agency policy setting driven by near-term budgetary volatility almost certainly limits reflection on and adoption of such strategies.   This finding also suggests that the crisis-induced and budget-driven fare setting processes may not themselves be the problem, but rather are a manifestation of unclear or contradictory goals. Clearly defined and congruent agency goals and objectives allow staff to work toward given objectives, and board members to defend their decisions in light of these v objectives. But given the often competing and contradictory goals for public transit (reduce congestion and emissions, serve the needs of the poor and disabled, keep subsidies low, provide quality employment for workers, keep fares low, etc.), goal-driven pricing of transit services has proven elusive.   2. There is some, albeit limited, interest in distance- and time-based fares, especially among agencies that have or soon will introduce smart cards.   While scholars and researchers have long argued for transit pricing based on principles of economic efficiency, in practice, most agencies pursue fare policies that appear to favor administrative efficiency (e. g. keeping fare collection simple) and effectiveness (e. g. simple and low transit fares, unlimited use passes that reward frequent riders). Our survey results underscore that even with increasing technological ability to do so, a majority transit agencies are unlikely to implement distance-based or time-of-day pricing anytime in the near future.   According to the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) (2012), 23 percent of transit operators nationwide currently employ some form of distance-based fare pricing and just 6 percent time of day pricing. While only 6 percent of the respondents to our survey who had recently adopted smart cards reported a move to time- or distance-based pricing as a result, nearly a quarter (24 %) of those planning to adopt smart cards said that they expect to use them to implement some form of distance-based pricing, and fully 18 percent report the same for time-of-day pricing. This suggests that while resistance to variable pricing remains widespread, at least some of this resistance is likely due to the operational challenges of implementing differentiated pricing in the absence of smart cards. And as those operational vi challenges are reduced by smartcards, the longstanding trend away from differentiated fares may begin to reverse.   3. Transit agencies are risk-averse and seek to minimize public scrutiny of any fare changes.   Our survey results emphasize that transit officials seek to ensure their actions avoid public scrutiny and negative publicity, which substantially inhibits implementing variable cost pricing for two reasons. First, implementing <b>variable</b> <b>fare</b> pricing in almost all cases would be a radical departure from the flat fare status quo, and would thus subject a transit agency to financial scrutiny, heightened media attention, and increased lawmaker inquiry – all of which transit officials report they seek to avoid. Secondly, the transit managers we surveyed report that any fare increases will subject their agency to public scrutiny. Concerns over the negative consequences of fare changes appear to be so embedded that transit managers report focusing far more on the riders they might lose from any fare changes than the riders they might gain by implementing, for example, variable fares. They are, in other words, highly loss averse. Finally, the transit agency representatives we interviewed collectively reported that they have generally not conducted market research on non-riders or on customer responses to alternative fare structures, and that they have little understanding of the likely ridership gains and losses that might accompany distance- or time-based pricing.   But despite the many potential benefits of marginal cost-based transit pricing touted in the literature, our interviews found significant evidence of risk-aversion, goal obfuscation, and cost confusion among transit managers, as predicted by the literature on public administration. The interviews revealed, with sometimes surprising candor, how little some senior transit managers understand their costs of service provision and how they vary. This lack of cost comprehension may be the inevitable result of government agencies’ mandate to maintain service without regard to cost or vice versa (Flam, Persson, and Svensson 1982).   We hypothesize that transit agencies’ mission ambiguity is a leading explanatory factor of the context in which a poor understanding of costs can persist. As has been argued in the literature, this lack of cost comprehension is manifest in the crude ways in which transit fares are set, despite advances in technology that can facilitate a movement away from costabstracted, flat, and uniform fares and toward the cost-specific fares that vary based that cost of service provided. Our findings also suggest that the crisis-induced and budget-driven fare setting processes may be not the cause, but the effect of unclear or altogether absent goals. Even when a de facto pursuit of transit fare pricing effectiveness is evident, the absence of explicit goals to which agency decision-makers can refer, can mean that necessary, routine incremental fare increases are deferred until a distracting and destructive budgetary crisis forces a much larger and more disruptive fare increase on riders.   This research suggests that transit agencies could avoid the contentious, fraught, and high-stakes “crises” that currently is all but a sine qua non for raising fares, while offering “fairer” fares that could increase ridership and revenue. However, the transit agency officials we interviewed reported having little information about whether such practices actually affect transit’s mode share. Several interviewees reported that they would expect to lose riders with any form of marginal-cost fare pricing, but had no idea whether or how they might gain additional riders under such a schema. Distance-based pricing, for example, could attract passenger for new, inexpensively priced short-trip riders who might have previously found $ 1. 50 for a four block ride to be too much. The extent to which ridership would change depends on the urban context, economic conditions, traveler demographics, and so on; with information on these factors the ridership effects of fare structure changes could be estimated. Absent such information, any move to distance- or time-based pricing is a decidedly risky policy pursuit.   Our interviewees also speculated that the larger the sources of operating and capital subsidies, the less likely it is that an agency’s managers will focus on farebox recovery ratios. This argument, echoed in the literature (Vrooman 1978; Flam, Persson, and Svensson 1982; Pickrell 1989), suggests that public subsidies have the perverse effect of reducing costefficiency and promoting subsequent budgetary crises.   Transit officials also report that in a world where driving is cheap and preferred, transit officials have little choice but to maintain low fares in order to encourage mode shift. Given this unlevel playing field, then, the non-pursuit of marginal cost pricing may be reasonable to expect. But it also suggests that transit officials should support pricing policies such as congestion tolling and parking pricing, which help to internalize the costs of driving. However, our survey results show that transit officials tend to oppose, or are at best lukewarm toward, efforts to pricing the externalities of automobile travel. Just four in 10 of those surveyed support market-rate pricing on on-street parking, and just 27 percent support high occupancy/ toll (HOT) lanes; this contrasts dramatically with seven in 10 who support increased carpooling...|$|E

Though the city is receiving $ 45 million in federal grants to fund the project, the capital costs burden falls largely on the city. After including private contributions and other external inflows, the city is responsible for $ 82 million of the capital costs, and has set aside an additional $ 15 million should it have to pay for utilities relocation. Projected revenues from the system include: fare revenue, pavement maintenance savings, liquidation of the system, and incremental property tax revenue. Baseline fare revenue projections, assuming a $ 1. 00 fare and initial daily demand of 3, 700 riders, predict that the system will recover 42 % of operational and maintenance (O&M) costs in the first full year of operation. However, as O&M costs rise at a higher rate than ridership, this ratio is expected to decline to 27 % by 2035. This translates to a $ 1. 8 million deficit and $ 5. 4 million deficit in 2017 and 2035, respectively. The financial viability of the system depends on the city’s ability to decrease the rate of O&M cost growth and/or increase ridership.

Based upon this background information a multi-equation econometric model is developed. The model is calibrated over subsets of a base of historical data from 180 markets over a six year time frame. The subsets are cross classifications of markets with respect to length of haul and market size. Recently developed techniques in model sensitivity analysis are applied to ensure statistical robustness, and principal components regression is employed to combat the problem of multicollinearity. Numerical examples of applications of the model are provided. The results indicate that the model performs very well in the analysis of long and medium haul markets. It is particularly effective in the higher density markets. The model is not equipped to account for the impacts upon air transportation passenger demand of competing modes, and therefore does not perform well in the analysis of short haul (less than 400 miles) markets.

Optimisation <b>variables</b> are bus <b>fare,</b> congestion toll, bus frequency, bus size, fare collection system, bus boarding policy and the number of seats inside buses.

A numerical application shows that optimal frequency is quite sensitive to the assumptions on crowding costs, impact of buses on traffic congestion, and overall congestion level. If crowding matters to users, buses should have as many seats as possible, up to a minimum area that must be left free of seats. If for any other reason planners decide to have buses with fewer seats than optimal (e. g., to increase bus capacity), frequency should be increased to compensate for the discomfort imposed on public transport users. Finally, the consideration of crowding externalities (on both seating and standing) imposes a sizeable increase in the optimal bus fare, and consequently, a reduction of the optimal bus subsidy...|$|R
5000|$|The Act of Parliament {{establishing}} the LNC had specified maximum ticket {{prices for the}} railway, and traffic never rose to {{the level at which}} it would have been justified for either the LNC or the LSWR to undertake costly and time consuming lobbying for a change in the legislation. As a consequence, despite the effects of inflation, competition and <b>variable</b> costs the <b>fares</b> of the London Necropolis Railway never changed throughout the first 85 of its 87 years of operation. Live passengers were charged 6s in first class, 3s 6d in second class and 2s in third class (in 1854 worth about £, £ and £ respectively in [...] consumer terms) for a return ticket, while dead passengers were charged £1 in first class, 5s in second class and 2s 6d in third class (in 1854 worth about £, £ and £ respectively in [...] consumer terms) for a one-way ticket. As the railway was intended only to be used by Londoners visiting the cemetery or attending funerals, the only tickets ever issued to living passengers were returns from London. In 1918 the LSWR (which provided the LNC's passenger carriages) abandoned second class services and the LNC as a consequence discontinued the sale of second class fares to living passengers, but continued to separate coffin tickets into first, second and third class dependent on the type of funeral booked.|$|R
40|$|Britain’s {{national}} {{rail system}} was ‘privatised’ {{as a result}} of the 1993 Railways Act, with most of the organisational and ownership changes implemented by 1997. This thesis examines the long term impacts of the privatisation initiative on the passenger rail service. A key issue when examining long term changes is that of the counterfactual – what would have happened if the changes had not occurred? A simple econometric model of the demand for passenger rail services was developed and used in conjunction with extrapolative methods for key <b>variables</b> such as <b>fares,</b> train kms and GDP to determine demand-side counterfactuals. Extrapolative methods were also used to determine counterfactual infrastructure and train operation costs. Although since privatisation rail demand has grown strongly, the analysis indicates that transitional disruptions suppressed demand by around 4 % over a prolonged period (1994 / 95 to 2005 / 6), whilst the Hatfield accident reduced demand by about 5 %, albeit over a short period (2000 / 1 to 2005 / 6). A welfare analysis indicates that although consumers gained {{as a result of}} privatisation, for most years this has been offset by increases in costs. An exception is provided by the two years immediately before the Hatfield accident. Overall the loss in welfare since the reforms were introduced far exceeds the net receipts from the sale of rail businesses. It is found that although the reforms have had advantages in terms of lower fares and better service levels than otherwise would have been the case, this has been offset by adverse transitional effects and high costs, which in turn may be linked with higher transaction costs.

This paper examines the long term impacts of these changes. A key issue when examining long term changes is that of the counterfactual – what would have happened if the changes had not occurred? A simple econometric model of the demand for passenger rail services was developed and used in conjunction with extrapolative methods for key <b>variables</b> such as <b>fares</b> and train km to determine demand-side counterfactuals. Extrapolative methods were also used to determine counterfactual infrastructure and train operation costs. Although our results are sensitive to the assumptions we have made concerning the counterfactual they suggest a number of impacts. Since privatisation, rail demand has grown strongly but our analysis indicates that transitional disruptions suppressed demand by around 9 % over a prolonged period (1992 / 3 to 2005 / 6), whilst the Hatfield accident reduced demand by about 5 %, albeit over a shorter period (2000 / 1 to 2006 / 7). A welfare analysis suggests that although consumers seem to have gained {{as a result of}} privatisation, for most years this has been offset by increases in costs. An exception is provided by the two years immediately before the Hatfield accident. Overall the loss in welfare since the reforms were introduced far exceeds the net receipts from the sale of rail businesses. Thus although the reforms have had advantages in terms of lower fares and better service levels than otherwise would have been the case, this appears to have been offset by increased infrastructure and train operations costs. The source of these high costs remains an area of speculation but appear to be related to aspects of both market and regulatory failure. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Local buses in Britain, outside London, were ‘deregulated’ as {{a result}} of the 1985 Transport Act, with most of the {{organisational}} changes implemented in 1986 but many of the ownership changes occurring over a longer period. By contrast, in London, the 1984 London Regional Transport Act introduced a system of comprehensive tendering – but it took 10 years for the organisational and ownership changes to be fully implemented. This paper examines the long term impacts of these changes. A key issue when examining long term changes is that of the counterfactual – what would have happened if the changes had not occurred? An econometric model of the demand for local bus services in Britain is outlined and used in conjunction with extrapolative methods for key <b>variables</b> such as <b>fares</b> and bus kms to determine demand-side counterfactuals. Some analyses of subsidy and of costs will also be outlined. This will then permit the examination of welfare change by estimating changes in consumer and producer surpluses, updating earlier studies. It is found that outside London, bus demand declined strongly, at least up to the year 2000 and some of this reduction can be ascribed to deregulation. By contrast in London, demand has generally been increasing. However, in both areas operating costs also declined strongly, again up to 2000, but since then there have been strong increases in costs and subsidy. Our initial finding is that there are net welfare increases both outside and inside London, but with welfare increases per capita being five times greater in London than elsewhere. However, sensitivity analysis shows that our results are sensitive to the specification of the modelling system and assumptions made concerning the counterfactual, particularly for the results for London. <br/...|$|R
40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} how aircraft noise {{can be translated}} into a form of landing charge. The objectives of the thesis were to develop noise landi'ng charges for six of the major airports in England and to determine what the implication it has on passengers' choice of airports. An airport choice model is developed distinguished by three market types: long-haul international scheduled, short-haul international scheduled and charter international. Modelling of airport choice was also carried out for passengers from the Greater London and South East areas. The best results are obtained using difference in access time, logarithmic difference in frequencies and weighted differences in <b>fare</b> <b>variables.</b> There is consistency in the access time coefficients for all three markets. Airport choice for international scheduled and charter passengers for the Greater London and other South East areas also show consistency in access time amongst different passenger groups in choosing airports. The implication of the noise charge particularly at Gatwick and Heathrow for the short and long haul markets reveal that the fare coefficients are sensitive and are subject to doubt. However Brooke et al (1994) acknowledge that exact fare details are difficult to obtain. Therefore {{it is a difficult}} task to produce accurate fare coefficients with published fare details that do not take into account discounts received by passengers. This is reflected in this study by observing the fact that high number of passengers change airports, when it may be argued that the noise charges are moderate. The sensitivity of the implications of the noise charge determined in this study have depended highly on the fare coefficients. This study has demonstrated the importance and perhaps the over reliance of depending on a single parameter for the evaluation of the implications of the noise charge...|$|R
40|$|Transportation {{is arguably}} the single most {{important}} factor in explaining the formation, spatial orientation, and growth of the urban metropolis in the United States. Both the spatial pattern and tenure of the regional network of U. S. cities exists {{as a direct result of}} the mode of transportation available to ship goods and transport individuals. In addition, the existing urban landscape has been significantly effected by the growth and change in transportation systems over time, from the horse-drawn railway of the early to mid- 19 th century, to the steam-powered, elevated railroads, and cable cars of the late- 19 th century, to the electric streetcar and trolley system of the late- 19 th and early- 20 th centuries, to the buses, automobiles, and electric rail lines of today. As a result, transportation is at the core of a number of problems (roadway congestion and urban sprawl, for example) that urban policy-makers face. ^ This dissertation is composed of three separate studies in urban transportation economics, two empirical and one theoretical. In each study, an unique research question is investigated; the common theme that links the three studies is an emphasis on the transportation network. In general, I examine how changes in the urban transportation network affect household behavioral choices, property values, and urban land-use patterns. Specifically, I have investigated the following research questions: (1) How responsive are riders of the Washington, D. C. Metro rail system to fare increases by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority? And, what affect does the construction (specification) of the <b>fare</b> <b>variable</b> have on elasticity estimates? (2) How is access to a highway or mass transit transportation system capitalized into property values? And, how have structural changes in the transportation network (that impact access) in Fairfax County, Virginia affected house prices? (3) How do the design and characteristics of an urban transportation network affect spatial land-use patterns and urban composition?...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{research}} is to develop a set of econometric Air-Rail competition models which are sufficiently sensitive to measure the effects upon demand of policy decisions, with regard to such variables as frequency of services and fares. Existing Modal Competition Models have, rather uncritically, applied Multiple Regression analysis in considering only one aspect of the market, namely the demand for travel, ignoring therefore the effects of the supply upon the demand. The emergence of the so called "Simultaneous Equations Bias", due to the two-way dependency between the demand and the level of service factor expressing the supply, renders the application of the 015 (Ordinary Least Squares) inappropriate, and hence, yields biased, inconsistent, and inefficient OLS coefficients. The models, developed in this study, depart from all existing Modal Competition Models, and overcome some of their drawbacks. They are formulated as Multi-equation Supply/Demand Modal Competition Models. They introduce the frequency of services variable not only in the demand, but also in the supply equation expressing the level of supply in response to changes in other variables. In order to derive unbiased, more conSistent, and more efficient coefficients, sophisticated statistical techniques, such as 2315 and JSLS (Two-Stage Least Squares and Three-Stage Least Squares) • are applied as a means of calibration. The elasticities obtained are consistent with the Supply and demand Microeconomic Theory. The frequency of services appears as the most powerful explanatory variable in Air demand; whereas fare and income are the most powerful variables in Rail demand equation. This leads to the conclusion that Air mode is mainly higher income groups and/or business oriented market; and Rail mode lower income groups and/or personal oriented market. Furthermore, Air and Rail are competing on a fare basis in short routes; while they do not show close substitutes for each other in longer ones. The high significance of the frequency of services, in Air demand, outlines its importance as a factor influencing the demand, and therefore, provides the Airlines management with the capability of improving the demand by acting upon the endogenous factor. This is of great interest in the scheduling fleet process. Similarly, the significance of Rail <b>fare</b> <b>variable</b> offers the Railways management the possibility of acting upon the demand through this controlable variable, for an efficient pricing policy. Rail journey time elasticities, derived from these models, are very close to the elasticities assumed by British Railways Board, in their Passenger Traffic Model, 1980. The statistical results indicate that the elasticities derived are useful for both analysis and forecasting purposes...|$|R
40|$|My {{dissertation}} is a {{study of}} the conditions under which state-owned enterprises improve infrastructure services [...] transport, energy, and water [...] particularly in developing countries. This research is relevant because, despite successful privatization of infrastructure that yielded over trillion and a half dollars in investments since 1990, infrastructure provision remains dominated by state-owned enterprises (Estache & Fay, 2007; Gomez-Ibanez, 2003). The OECD estimates that over the next two decades, US $ 35 to 40 trillion will be required to meet the global infrastructure deficit. At least half of this investment will be made by governments, particularly in, but not limited to, developing countries (OECD, 2007). In contrast to conventional wisdom, my research identifies mechanisms for reforming public infrastructure utilities through a new recipe for an inclusive reform framework that, unlike the textbook approach, jointly optimizes equity and efficiency without privatization. This dissertation contrasts the world's largest public utility, the Indian Railways, with the ideal-type textbook privatization, illustrated with the case of the British Railways' privatization. I focus on the Indian Railways as a paradigmatic example of how to reform infrastructure-providing state-owned enterprises while balancing equity with efficiency concerns. I analyze primary data gathered through 100 in-depth interviews and on-site observations. The fieldwork was conducted over a period of two years, including half a year at the Office of the Minister for Indian Railways. In addition, I utilize secondary data through archival review of policy documents and analyze fifty years of the Railways' statistics. My dissertation shows how the Indian Railways was transformed, between 2005 - 2008, counter intuitively, without privatization, retrenchment, or fare-hikes for poor passengers, under the leadership of a populist politician, the then Minister of Railways. I explain how the Railways' was rescued from near bankruptcy in 2001 to realize US $ 6 billion annual surplus in 2008. An essential element of the Indian Railway's complex strategy was to leverage existing assets by operating faster, longer, and heavier trains on the supply-side, as opposed to investing in asset accumulation. On the demand-side, the Railways shed a monopoly mind-set in favor of customer centric, dynamic, and differential pricing and service provision. Based on the positive case of Indian Railways, I derive an equitable alternative to infrastructure reform: A tripartite inclusive reform framework [...] diagnostic, invention, and agency. First, crafting space for reform by diagnosis and navigation of conflicting and competing interest groups to isolate apolitical variables that jointly increase efficiency and equity outcomes. Second, reinventing reforms by focusing on all manipulable variables for supply optimization and demand responsiveness, because profit in public utilities is a function of several manipulable <b>variables,</b> not only <b>fares</b> and wages. Third, agency, through radical incrementalism, an approach to minimize the risk of catastrophic errors, and yet yield rapid transformations...|$|R
40|$|The {{equilibrium}} {{properties of}} an aggregate taxi market are investigated using a general bilateral searching and meeting function which characterizes the search frictions between vacant taxis and unserved customers. Three specific issues are analyzed for meeting functions that exhibit increasing, constant and decreasing returns to scale. Firstly, service quality {{in terms of}} customer wait/search time and average profit per taxi are examined jointly in relation to taxi fleet size, and a Pareto-improving win-win situation is identified, where an increase in taxi fleet size leads to improvements in both service quality and market profitability. Such a Pareto-improving situation is found to emerge {{if and only if}} the meeting functions show increasing returns to scale. Secondly, the properties of the socially optimal solution are examined. It is found that the taxi fleet size should be chosen such that the total cost of operating vacant taxis equals the total cost of customer waiting time multiplied by an asymmetric factor of the meeting function, and that taxi services should be subsidized at social optimum only when the meeting functions show increasing returns to scale. Thirdly, the Pareto-efficient services are examined for trade-offs between social welfare and profits in the light of partially conflicting objectives of the public sector and the private taxi firms using a bi-objective maximization approach. The taxi utilization rate and the customer wait/search time or service quality are proved to be constant along the Pareto frontier and equal to those at social optimum if the meeting functions show constant returns to scale. Extensions are made to the cases with increasing and decreasing returns to scale. This thesis further incorporates both bilateral taxi-customer search frictions and congestion externality into the economic analyses of the equilibrium properties of taxi market. We take account of congestion externalities by adopting a realistic distance-based and delay-based taxi fare structure. We first investigate comparative static effects of regulatory <b>variables</b> of taxi <b>fare</b> and fleet size on the market, and then examine the properties of the Pareto-efficient solutions for simultaneous maximization of social welfare and taxi profit in the congested market. A Structural Equation Model (SEM) is applied to estimate the returns to scale in a Cobb-Douglas type bilateral searching and meeting function which characterizes the search frictions between vacant taxis and unserved customers. Number of taxis, taxi fare, population, average occupied taxi journey time and disposable income are used as exogenous variables; while customer demand, average customer waiting time and average taxi waiting and cruising time in search of each customer are used as endogenous variables. These variables are coupled together through the SEM whose parameters are estimated from the Hong Kong annual taxi survey data. Our calibration results show that urban taxi services in Hong Kong exhibits an increasing return to scale. The established SEM model can be used to obtain regulatory information useful for decision making, such as the impact of the restriction over the number of taxi licenses and the fixing of taxi fare structure...|$|R
