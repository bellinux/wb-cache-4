Despite numerous immigration reform laws enacted {{in the last three}} decades to address this dilemma, the numbers continue to rise instead of decrease. Although the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 made it unlawful to hire illegal aliens, jobs have remained readily available to this population. Employers are mandated to follow a verification process of checking every new employee 's identification that asserts citizenship or alien status with authorization to work. One weakness in the employers sanction provision is that accurate <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> is not required as long as the employer "complied in good faith" that they appear to be authentic. This has led to a rampant rise in counterfeit documents that helps bypass the employee verification process. This study focuses on the role and importance of identity documents and immigration reform during the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton Administrations. Also explored are the positions of agencies responsible for issuing identity documents and the succession of legislative pilot projects aimed to improve on identification and verification systems.

How to monitor these key areas investment effectively, promote the sound development of investment projects, and lead project to a right way are expected to play the leading role of the government department business. Traditionally, the government examines the entire project, which includes project pre-feasibility study, project determination reports rule, project mid-term examination, and accreditation council before the project is completed. However, because the accreditation council is usually as short as several hours, specialists just can check the files which the auditee expects the auditor to examine and can’t have a real perception about the project. This kind of conclusion is not powerful enough to persuade investors to invest in the follow-up project. In order {{to make up for the}} lack of management bugs, government imports a new method, Information Theory Audit (IT audit). IT audit is a very meaningful process. Through on-site survey, <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents,</b> and personnel-related dialogue, auditors, who are experienced in the industry, will know the actual situation of the project. Then, auditors can provide the correct suggestions for investors. Business investment projects are different from government investment projects.

The rapid {{advances in technology}} and the widespread availability of personal computers has not reduced the use <b>of</b> printed <b>documents.</b> While digital documents can be verified by many robust and secure methods such as digital signatures and digital watermarks, <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> printed <b>documents</b> still relies on manual inspection of embedded physical security mechanisms. The objective of this thesis is to propose an efficient automated framework for robust content-based <b>verification</b> <b>of</b> printed <b>documents.</b> The principal issue is to achieve robustness {{with respect to the}} degradations and increased levels of noise that occur from multiple cycles of printing and scanning. It is shown that classic OCR systems fail under such conditions, moreover OCR systems typically rely heavily on the use of high level linguistic structures to improve recognition rates. However inferring knowledge about the contents <b>of</b> the <b>document</b> image from a-priori statistics is contrary to the nature <b>of</b> <b>document</b> <b>verification.</b> Instead a system is proposed that utilizes specific knowledge <b>of</b> the <b>document</b> to perform highly accurate content verification based on a Print-Scan degradation model and character shape recognition. Such specific knowledge <b>of</b> the <b>document</b> is a reasonable choice for the verification domain since the document contents are already known in order to verify them. The system analyses digital multi font PDF documents to generate a descriptive summary <b>of</b> the <b>document,</b> referred to as Description Map" (DDM). The DDM is later used for verifying the content of printed and scanned copies <b>of</b> the original <b>documents.</b> The system utilizes 2 -D Discrete Cosine Transform based features and an adaptive hierarchical classifier trained with synthetic data generated by a Print-Scan degradation model.

Methods A cross-sectional {{study was conducted in}} 680 adults consulting for biological examination in private laboratories in Lyon (France) to evaluate VC for diphtheria, tetanus, poliomyelitis and pertussis (dTPaP) and enabled reported vaccinations to be compared with documented, confirmed vaccinations. Results <b>Verification</b> <b>of</b> <b>documented,</b> confirmed vaccinations disclosed VC of 78. 7 % for tetanus, 63. 6 % for poliomyelitis, 57. 8 % for diphtheria and 10. 7 % for pertussis. Comparison of confirmed and self-reported vaccinations revealed that a large percentage of people who thought that they were vaccinated were not. VC significantly decreased with age for diphtheria and poliomyelitis and did not vary by gender. The VC rate for pertussis has increased since the 2008 recommendations were made.
