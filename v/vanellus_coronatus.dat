50|$|The crowned lapwing (<b>Vanellus</b> <b>coronatus),</b> or crowned plover, is a bird of the lapwing {{subfamily}} {{that occurs}} contiguously from the Red Sea coast of Somalia to southern and southwestern Africa. It is an adaptable and numerous species, with bold and noisy habits. It {{is related to}} the more localized black-winged and Senegal lapwings, with which it shares some plumage characteristics.|$|E
40|$|Aspects of {{the anatomy}} and {{morphology}} of crowned plovers (<b>Vanellus</b> <b>coronatus)</b> collected {{over a period}} of one year at the J. B. M. Hertzog (Bloemfontein) and B. J. Vorster (Kimberley) airports were investigated. The renewal of plumage in both sexes apparently takes place mainly during the summer months. Except for some bill dimensions, all standard body measurements of adult and immature males are significantly larger than those of females. No clear seasonal pattern could be distinguished in the body and liver mass of the birds. Seasonal variations in the visible fat content of adult crowned plovers of both sexes are probably related to breeding activities and the availability of food...|$|E
40|$|Prey {{manipulation}} {{was investigated}} {{as a means}} of reducing the bird hazard at the Bloemfontein airport, central South Africa. From January 1985 to December 2005 approximately 7, 000 individuals representing 55 bird species which, potentially, posed a threat to aviation, were collected at the airport. Numerically the crowned plover (<b>Vanellus</b> <b>coronatus),</b> blacksmith plover (V. armatus), lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni), white-winged korhaan (Eupodotis afraoides) and double-banded courser (Smutsornis africanus) in order of importance constituted more than 90 % of the total sample. Based on stomach analyses harvester termites (Hodotermes mossambicus) comprise the dominant food source of all five species concerned. Experimentally a significant and sustainable decrease in termite numbers and activities in disturbed grass areas could be accomplished by administering bait treated with Gaucho, a systemic insecticide. By using a combination of pitfall traps, mouse traps and sweep nets over a period of 15 months, prey abundance in undisturbed long grass (average 57 cm) and grass which were kept permanently short (average 22 cm) by regular mowing was compared. Terrestrial invertebrates, mainly insects, contributed more than 90 % of the overall sample with twice as many individuals in short grass than in long grass. The available food source for the predominantly insectivorous avifauna at the Bloemfontein airport can thus be effectively reduced by implementing a so-called long grass policy in combination with seasonal chemical control of harvester termites, thereby limiting bird numbers and also bird strikes...|$|E
40|$|Bloemfontein airport, {{situated}} in the central Free State, experiences {{the greatest number of}} bird-aircraft collisions at South African airports, relative to its (low) air traffic. In an attempt to rectify the situation, aspects of the feeding ecology of birds presenting a potential hazard at the airport were investigated. Plant surveys indicated that the study area can be classified as a dry Cymbopogon – Themeda veld type in a relatively good condition. Using 270 pitfall traps over a continuous period of 15 months, it was established that {{more than twice as many}} ground-living invertebrates, mainly insects, occurred in grass kept permanently short (average height 22 cm) compared to those in undisturbed long grass (average height 57 cm). Based on 4, 843 birds from 51 species posing a threat to aviation and which were shot as part of an ongoing management program extending over 11 years, medium-sized, ground-living birds such as crowned plovers (<b>Vanellus</b> <b>coronatus),</b> blacksmith plovers (V. armatus), whitewinged korhaans (Eupodotis afraoides), double-banded coursers (Smutsornis africanus), spotted dikkops (Burhinus capensis), cattle egrets (Bubulcus ibis), Swainson’s francolins (Francolinus swainsonii) and Orange River francolins (F. levaillantoides) dominated the local bird population. Crop and/or stomach analyses of these birds indicate that insects, mainly Isoptera but also Coleoptera and Orthoptera, collectively constitute their main food source. The Isoptera, more specifically the harvester termite (Hodotermes mossambicus), is, moreover, the only important prey taxon showing a conspicuous utilization peak during the relative food shortage of the dry season. A significant and sustained decrease in harvester termite numbers and activities was accomplished by administering Gaucho-treated bait in disturbed grass areas, thereby reducing the availability of food and, hopefully, also bird numbers and bird-aircraft collisions. Implementation of a so-called long grass policy as a control strategy should have a similar effect...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Environmental Science)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Polybrominated {{flame retardants}} (BFRs), {{organochlorine}} pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were analysed in eggs of various wild bird species from industrialised areas in South Africa. Eggs were {{collected during the}} 2008 – 2009 breeding season, homogenised {{and sent to the}} Norwegian School of Veterinary Science (NVH) for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. The concentration, contamination profile, and risk assessment were conducted for each pollutant class, while effects of species-specific variation, feeding guild, and feeding habitat were investigated. Levels of BFRs ranged between 2. 6 – 44 ng g- 1 wet mass (wm). The predominant congeners were BDE- 153, - 154, - 183 and - 47. Results indicated species, in close contact to humans, had higher levels of BFRs, even at lower trophic levels. Therefore, diet was not the primary route of exposure. High concentrations and the occurrence of nona-PBDE congeners and HBCD indicated exposure to current use BFRs. There were measurable levels of OCPs and PCBs in all eggs analysed. Median OCP concentration ranged from 4. 2 – 623 ng g- 1 wm. DDE was the predominant compound in all species {{with the exception of the}} Crowned Lapwing (<b>Vanellus</b> <b>coronatus)</b> where chlordanes were predominant. This may indicate a species-specific attribute in the metabolic efficiency or diet of the genus, since these findings have been reported elsewhere in literature. Congener profiles indicated historic sources of lindane and DDT, while low levels of p,p’-DDT in al species indicate long-range or atmospheric transport. Even though levels of p,p’-DDE were approaching toxicological thresholds, no eggshell thinning was evident. Concentrations of OCPs and PCBs showed an increase with increasing tophic level. PCB concentrations ranged between 0. 9 – 296. 4 ng g- 1 wm. When studying the metabolic potential of PCBs, metabolic groups showed good agreement with the biodegradability of the individual congeners. Phenobarbital-type (PB-type) inducer PCBs were prevalent, indicating the predominance of less toxic PCB congeners. However, non-ortho PCBs were not analysed. These congeners aslo could impact on the toxic potential of PCBs in wild bird eggs. Principle component analysis (PCA) indicated that variances within datasets could be attributed to congener profiles within species as they were affected by exposure, diet, position in the food web, and association with human activities. Although the individual groups of organohalogens were below no observed effect levels (NOELs), negative effects could occur through interactions of various compounds with each other, as well as the unique exposure profiles of South African bird populations. To assess the dietary exposure of low-income human populations living close to large industries, the occurrence of organohalogens was investigated in backyard chicken eggs. Levels of dioxins in these eggs were above the European Union (EU) recommended limits, whereas BFRs and OCPs levels were below levels of concern. Nevertheless, areas where DDT is actively applied to dwellings for malaria control should be urgently investigated. The presence of measureable levels of all the compounds considered, indicate an environment seriously impacted by anthropogenic activity that in the long term could negatively affect both the environment and human health, if it has not already done so.
