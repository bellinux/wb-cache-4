5|$|Anna Maria Rückerschöld (5 February 1725–25 May 1805), born Rücker, was a Swedish {{author who}} wrote several popular books on {{housekeeping}} and {{cooking in the}} late 18th and early 19th century. She was an advocate of women's right to a good education in household matters and propagated this <b>view</b> <b>in</b> public debate through an anonymous letter in 1770. Along with Cajsa Warg and other female cookbook authors, she was an influential figure in culinary matters in early modern Sweden.|$|E
5|$|John Ralston Saul {{expressed}} the <b>view</b> <b>in</b> The Unconscious Civilization that in contemporary developed nations {{many people have}} acquiesced in turning over their {{sense of right and}} wrong, their critical conscience, to technical experts; willingly restricting their moral freedom of choice to limited consumer actions ruled by the ideology of the free market, while citizen participation in public affairs is limited to the isolated act of voting and private-interest lobbying turns even elected representatives against the public interest.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to public <b>view</b> <b>in</b> 2009, Townsend began endorsing Peavey, and later released a PXD Devin Townsend signature model, essentially a Flying V-style 7-string baritone guitar with an EMG 81-7 pickup and a 7-string EMG SA single coil pickup {{in the neck}} position. Peavey also made Townsend a number of custom 7-strings, including one with a single EMG 81-7 pickup that is used for playing most of the material on Ziltoid The Omniscient. Aside from his signature model, Townsend also utilizes two custom 6-string Predator models made by Peavey; one with a natural flame-top finish and the DTP logo on the 12th fret, and one in a black finish with a Floyd Rose vibrato unit (for Open C and Open B tuning, respectively).|$|E
5|$|After the 15 September incident, Blackman {{continued}} with his tour of duty, leaving Helmand Province in late October 2011. On 13 October 2012, at {{the decision of}} the Service Prosecution Authority, Marines A–E were charged with the murder of the unnamed Afghan insurgent. The lead came after British civilian police discovered suspicious video footage on a serviceman's laptop. Marines D and E had charges against them dropped on 5 February 2013. Marines A, B and C first appeared in court in August 2013, where they entered a not-guilty plea. The military trial of Marines A, B and C, protected from <b>view</b> <b>in</b> court behind a screen because of an anonymity order, began on 23 October 2013 and lasted two weeks. Their court-martial board (equivalent to a jury in the civilian justice system) was seven members strong, instead of the five used for less serious cases.|$|E
5|$|After the {{publication}} of Go Quietly, Agnew largely disappeared from public <b>view.</b> <b>In</b> a rare TV interview in 1980, he advised young people not to go into politics because too much was expected of those in high public office. In 1983 a Maryland court ordered him to pay the state the sum of $268,000, including interest and penalties, {{the sum of the}} bribes he had taken while a public employee. Agnew did not dispute the judgement, but seven years later applied unsuccessfully for this sum to be treated as tax-deductible. He was briefly in the news in 1987, when as the plaintiff in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, he gave the public some insight into his recent business activities.|$|E

5|$|Because the Moon is {{continuously}} blocking {{our view}} of a half-degree-wide circular area of the sky, the related phenomenon of occultation occurs when a bright star or planet passes behind the Moon and is occulted: hidden from <b>view.</b> <b>In</b> this way, a solar eclipse is an occultation of the Sun. Because the Moon is comparatively close to Earth, occultations of individual stars are not visible everywhere on the planet, nor at the same time. Because of the precession of the lunar orbit, each year different stars are occulted.|$|E
5|$|Deus Ex: Human Revolution is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} game with incorporated first-person shooter and stealth mechanics. Players take {{the role of}} Adam Jensen, a man equipped with mechanical cybernetic implants called augmentations. The game's environments, ranging from open world hubs to more scripted environments, are explored in first-person, although actions such as hiding behind cover, conversing with non-playable characters (NPCs), and some attack animations switch to a third-person <b>view.</b> <b>In</b> these environments, players can find NPCs that will advance both the main story quest and optional side quests: completing quests, along with other actions such as combat with enemies, rewards Adam with experience points, which raise his experience level. Also accessible are black market vendors which supply equipment and weapons for Credits, the in-game currency. Interactive objects within environments can be highlighted, although these options are either turned off on the hardest difficulty or can be turned off in the options menu by the player.|$|E
5|$|During the 16th {{century and}} {{onset of the}} early modern period, {{military}} alliances with the Portuguese Empire were made, the Jesuit Catholic missionaries arrived, and prolonged warfare with Islamic foes including the Adal Sultanate and Ottoman Empire, {{as well as with}} the polytheistic Oromo people, threatened the security of the Ethiopian Empire. These contacts and conflicts inspired works of ethnography, by authors such as the monk and historian Bahrey, which were embedded into the existing historiographic tradition and encouraged a broader <b>view</b> <b>in</b> historical chronicles for Ethiopia's place in the world. The Jesuit missionaries Pedro Páez (1564–1622) and Manuel de Almeida (1580–1646) also composed a history of Ethiopia, but it remained in manuscript form among Jesuit priests of Portuguese India and was not published in the West until modern times.|$|E

5|$|During this time, Stanton {{maintained}} a broad focus on women's rights in general rather than narrowing her focus only to female suffrage in particular. After {{passage of the}} Fifteenth Amendment in 1870 and its support by the Equal Rights Association and prominent suffragists such as Stone, Blackwell, and Howe, the gap between Elizabeth Cady Stanton and other leaders of the women's movement widened as Stanton took issue with the fundamental religious leanings of several movement leaders. Unlike many of her colleagues, Stanton believed organized Christianity relegated women to an unacceptable position in society. She explored this <b>view</b> <b>in</b> the 1890s in The Woman's Bible, which elucidated a feminist understanding of biblical scripture and sought to correct the fundamental sexism Stanton believed was inherent to organized Christianity. Likewise, Stanton supported divorce rights, employment rights, and property rights for women, issues in which the American Women's Suffrage Association (AWSA) preferred not to become involved.|$|E
5|$|Fodor {{starts with}} some criticisms of {{so-called}} standard realism. This view is characterized, according to Fodor, by two distinct assertions. One of these regards the internal structure of mental states and asserts that such states are non-relational. The other concerns the semantic theory of mental content and asserts {{that there is}} an isomorphism between the causal roles of such contents and the inferential web of beliefs. Among modern philosophers of mind, the majority view seems to be that the first of these two assertions is false, but that the second is true. Fodor departs from this <b>view</b> <b>in</b> accepting the truth of the first thesis but rejecting strongly the truth of the second.|$|E

5|$|Hilbert spaces arise {{naturally}} {{and frequently}} {{in mathematics and}} physics, typically as infinite-dimensional function spaces. The earliest Hilbert spaces were studied {{from this point of}} <b>view</b> <b>in</b> {{the first decade of the}} 20th century by David Hilbert, Erhard Schmidt, and Frigyes Riesz. They are indispensable tools in the theories of partial differential equations, quantum mechanics, Fourier analysis (which includes applications to signal processing and heat transfer)—and ergodic theory, which forms the mathematical underpinning of thermodynamics. John von Neumann coined the term Hilbert space for the abstract concept that underlies many of these diverse applications. The success of Hilbert space methods ushered in a very fruitful era for functional analysis. Apart from the classical Euclidean spaces, examples of Hilbert spaces include spaces of square-integrable functions, spaces of sequences, Sobolev spaces consisting of generalized functions, and Hardy spaces of holomorphic functions.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, the British {{zoologist}} John Edward Gray placed Coquerel's giant {{mouse lemur}} {{into its own}} genus, Mirza. This classification was widely ignored and later rejected in the early 1930s by zoologists Ernst Schwarz, Guillaume Grandidier, and others, who felt that its longer fur and bushy tail did not merit a separate genus and instead placed it in Microcebus. British anatomist William Charles Osman Hill also favored this <b>view</b> <b>in</b> 1953, noting that despite its larger size (comparable to Cheirogaleus), its first upper premolar was proportionally small as in Microcebus. In 1977, French zoologist Jean-Jacques Petter also favored the Microcebus classification, despite the threefold size difference between Coquerel's giant mouse lemur {{and the other members}} of the genus.|$|E
5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature {{established}} Route30, an unsigned legislative route {{extending from}} Niagara Falls, Niagara County {{in the southwest}} to Rouses Point, Clinton County, in the northeast. From Rochester to Red Creek, Route30 was assigned to Ridge Road. Between Red Creek and the hamlet of Union Square (now Maple <b>View)</b> <b>in</b> the town of Mexico, it included most of modern NY104. At the same time, the roadway alongside the Niagara River between Ridge Road in Lewiston and Pine Avenue in downtown Niagara Falls was designated, but not signed, as part of Route18. By 1914, Route30 was amended to also include the section of Ridge Road from Porter (modern NY429) to Ridgeway (NY63). In 1914, another section—from Ridgeway to the Orleans–Monroe county line—was also included in Route30's definition as a spur route. The spur route became part of Route30 on March 1, 1921, when the mainline route was realigned to follow Ridge Road between Ridgeway and Rochester.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, Riverhillsoft {{released}} the first fully 3D survival horror game, Doctor Hauzer, for the 3DO. Both the player {{character and the}} environment are rendered entirely in polygons, while allowing the player to switch the view between three different perspectives: third-person, first-person, and overhead <b>view.</b> <b>In</b> a departure from most other survival horror games before and after it, Doctor Hauzer lacks any enemies; the main threat is instead the sentient house that the game takes place in, with the player having to survive the house's traps and solve puzzles. It also uses background music that heightens tension and changes depending on the situation, {{and the sound of}} the player character's echoing footsteps can change depending on the surface; these would later be used in Resident Evil. The game is today considered a formative step in the creation of the survival horror genre, improving on Alone in the Dark.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Sacred Spain: Art and Belief in the Spanish World brought {{together}} 71 {{works of art}} {{from a wide variety}} of lenders, including Peru, Mexico, and the Prado in Spain.

Andy Warhol Enterprises was displayed at the IMA from October, 2010 to January, 2011 and featured more than 150 works of art by Andy Warhol, as well as archival materials. The exhibition was the largest to illustrate Warhol's fascination with money and feature consumerism as a central theme.
