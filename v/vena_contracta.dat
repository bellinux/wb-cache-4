5000|$|Cavitation {{can occur}} in control valves. [...] If the actual {{pressure}} drop across the valve {{as defined by the}} upstream and downstream pressures in the system is greater than the sizing calculations allow, pressure drop flashing or cavitation may occur. The change from a liquid state to a vapor state results from the increase in flow velocity at or just downstream of the greatest flow restriction which is normally the valve port. To maintain a steady flow of liquid through a valve the flow velocity must be greatest at the <b>vena</b> <b>contracta</b> or the point where the cross sectional area is the smallest. This increase in flow velocity is accompanied by a substantial decrease in the fluid pressure which is partially recovered downstream as the area increases and flow velocity decreases. This pressure recovery is never completely {{to the level of the}} upstream pressure. If the pressure at the <b>vena</b> <b>contracta</b> drops below the vapor pressure of the fluid bubbles will form in the flow stream. If the pressure recovers after the valve to a pressure that is once again above the vapor pressure, then the vapor bubbles will collapse and cavitation will occur.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Vena</b> <b>Contracta</b> {{was also}} a term used by several English shotgun {{builders}} of the 19th and 20th Century. The gun barrels of sporting shotguns tapered very heavily from the breech to the muzzle. Thus a gun with a 12 bore breech would have a 20 bore muzzle. The idea was to retain the advantages a heavy-hitting large bore shotgun while retaining the lesser recoil and easy maneuverability of a small bore. Several leading firms built this type of gun but it proved unpopular and most were returned to the manufacturers for large bore barrels. To most shooters perhaps the idea of placing a 12 bore cartridge into a 20 bore barrel was too [...] "explosive". Complete functioning example are now rare though they are still not highly sought after.|$|E
50|$|An {{orifice plate}} {{is a thin}} plate {{with a hole in}} it, which is usually placed in a pipe. When a fluid (whether liquid or gaseous) passes through the orifice, its {{pressure}} builds up slightly upstream of the orifice but as the fluid is forced to converge to pass through the hole, the velocity increases and the fluid pressure decreases. A little downstream of the orifice the flow reaches its point of maximum convergence, the <b>vena</b> <b>contracta</b> (see drawing to the right) where the velocity reaches its maximum and the pressure reaches its minimum. Beyond that, the flow expands, the velocity falls and the pressure increases. By measuring the difference in fluid pressure across tappings upstream and downstream of the plate, the flow rate can be obtained from Bernoulli's equation using coefficients established from extensive research.|$|E
5000|$|The turbine meter is {{available}} in various manufacturer's configurations of a common theme; [...] turbine blades and rotor configured devices. These devices are designed such that when a gas stream passes through them they will spin proportionally {{to the amount of}} gas passing over the blades in a repeatable fashion. Accuracy is then ensured by completion of a calibration, indicating the relationship between rotational speed and volume, at various Reynolds Numbers. The fundamental difference between the orifice meter and the turbine meter is the flow equation derivation. The orifice meter flow calculation is based on fluid flow fundamentals (a 1st Law of Thermodynamics derivation utilizing the pipe diameter and <b>vena</b> <b>contracta</b> diameters for the continuity equation). Deviations from theoretical expectation can be assumed under the Coefficient of Discharge. Thus, one can manufacture an orifice meter of known uncertainty with only the measurement standard in hand and access to a machine shop. The need for flow conditioning, and hence, a fully developed velocity flow profile is driven from the original determination of Cd which utilized fully developed or 'reference profiles' as explained above.|$|E
50|$|When {{the results}} of this theory were {{compared}} with the quantity of water actually discharged, Newton concluded that the velocity with which the water issued from the orifice was equal to that which a falling body would receive by descending through half the height of water in the reservoir. This conclusion, however, is absolutely irreconcilable with the known fact that jets of water rise nearly to the same height as their reservoirs, and Newton seems to have been aware of this objection. Accordingly, in the second edition of his Principia, which appeared in 1713, he reconsidered his theory. He had discovered a contraction in the vein of fluid (<b>vena</b> <b>contracta)</b> which issued from the orifice, and found that, at the distance of about a diameter of the aperture, the section of the vein was contracted in the subduplicate ratio of two to one. He regarded, therefore, the section of the contracted vein as the true orifice from which the discharge of water ought to be deduced, and the velocity of the effluent water as due to the whole height of water in the reservoir; and by this means his theory became more conformable to {{the results of}} experience, though still open to serious objections.|$|E

This {{study was designed to}} evaluate the effect of changing blood viscosity on the <b>vena</b> <b>contracta</b> width using an in vitro model of valvular insufficiency capable of providing ample variation in the rate and stroke volume. Methods: We constructed a pulsatile flow model filled with human blood at varying hematocrit (15 %, 35 %, and 55 %) and corresponding blood viscosity (blood/water viscosity: 2. 6, 4. 8, 9. 1) levels in which jets were driven through a known orifice (7 mm(2)) into a 110 mL compliant receiving chamber (compliance: 2. 2 mL/mmHg) by a pulsatile pump. In addition, we used variable pump stroke volumes (5, 7. 5, and 10 mL) and rates (40, 60, and 80 ppm). <b>Vena</b> <b>contracta</b> region was imaged using a 3. 5 MHz transducer. Pressure and volume in the flow model were kept constant during each experimental condition, as well as ultrasound settings. Results: Blood viscosity variation in the experimental range did not induce significant changes in <b>vena</b> <b>contracta</b> dimensions. Also, <b>vena</b> <b>contracta</b> width did not change from normal to low hematocrit and viscosity levels. A very modest increase only in <b>vena</b> <b>contracta</b> dimension was observed at very high level of blood viscosity when hematocrit was set to 55 %. Pump rate, in the evaluated range, did not influence <b>vena</b> <b>contracta</b> width.

30|$|In {{single-phase}} fluid flow, {{the theoretical}} analysis to evaluate pressure drop caused by abrupt contraction {{of the flow}} area is accomplished with one-dimensional analysis. We begin by considering the orifice restriction case: as a fluid stream passes through a sharp edge “thin” orifice restriction, the flow contracts to an area smaller {{than that of the}} orifice itself. This smaller area, A c, is called the <b>vena</b> <b>contracta</b> (Van Ness and Abbott 2008). As fluid converges toward the opening of an orifice, it builds up considerable inward radial momentum that causes the flow stream to continue to flow “inwards” for a distance downstream of the restriction (Darby 2001; Sahin and Ceyhan 1996). As the flow stream continues downstream of the <b>vena</b> <b>contracta</b> the flow expands in an irreversible process to the pipe cross-sectional area, A. Correspondingly, the pressure of the flow stream decreases across the restriction and continues to decrease to the point of the <b>vena</b> <b>contracta,</b> with some recovery of pressure occurring as the flow stream expands outward to the pipe cross-sectional area.|$|E

BACKGROUNDColor Doppler imaging of the <b>vena</b> <b>contracta</b> {{has emerged as a}} simple and reliable measure of the severity of valvular regurgitation. This study evaluated the accuracy of VC imaging of AR by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). METHODSA transit-time flow probe was placed on the ascending aorta during cardiac surgery in 24 patients with AR. The flow probe was used to measure RgF and RgV simultaneously during VC imaging by TEE. Flow probe and VC imaging were interpreted separately and in blinded fashion. RESULTSA good correlation was found between VC width and RgF (r = 0. 85) and RgV (r = 0. 79). All six patients with VC width > 6 mm had a RgF > 0. 50. All 18 patients with VC width 7. 5 mm 2 had a RgF > 0. 50, and all 18 patients with a VC area < 7. 5 mm 2 had a RgF < 0. 50. In a subset of nine patients who underwent afterload manipulation to increase diastolic blood pressure, RgV increased significantly (34 ± 26 ml to 41 ± 27 ml, p = 0. 042) while VC width remained unchanged (5. 4 ± 2. 8 mm to 5. 4 ± 2. 8 mm, p = 0. 41).

At 3 months, sheep were randomized to sham surgery versus isolated undersized annuloplasty versus isolated bileaflet chordal cutting versus the combined therapy (n 7 each). At baseline, chronic myocardial infarction (3 months), and euthanasia (6. 6 months), we measured left ventricular (LV) volumes and ejection fraction, wall motion score index, MR regurgitation fraction and <b>vena</b> <b>contracta,</b> mitral annulus area, and posterior leaflet restriction angle (posterior leaflet to mitral annulus area) by 2 -dimensional and 3 -dimensional echocardi-ography.

The hydraulic {{characteristics of the}} 36 -inch wide by 25 -foot long fishway were evaluated at various bottom slopes and headpond elevations. Fishway discharge versus upstream headpond elevation rating curves were established. Numerical equations were derived to predict fishway flow discharge {{as a function of}} the headpond elevation at various slopes. The 36 -inch wide fishway, with 48 -inch high walls, passed a maximum of 20. 3, 21. 9, 23. 0, and 23. 3 f 3 /s at floor slopes of 1 : 10, 1 : 8, 1 : 6, and 1 : 4, respectively (1 being in the vertical direction). These flows corresponded to a headpond elevation of 42 -inches (measured from the fishway bottom to the water surface just upstream of the fishway). Higher headpond elevations caused water to spill over the sides of the fishway. Flow discharge can be determined from the derived equation; by substituting for the headpond elevation above the fishway floor, measured just upstream of the fishway or in the exit channel, and knowing the slope of the fishway bottom. Flow velocities at various cross sections along the fishway were documented. These remained relatively unchanged within the fishway downstream of the <b>vena</b> <b>contracta</b> region (the <b>vena</b> <b>contracta</b> region was within the top two to three upstream baffles). The main flow velocities, downstream of the <b>vena</b> <b>contracta</b> and throughout the fishway, ranged between 2. 2 and 5. 0 ft/s, depending on the fishway slope and headpond elevation.

In 6 sheep (3 in which a right coronary cusp and 3 in which non coronary cusp had been surgically trimmed to produce chronic aortic regurgitation [AR]) 21 hemodynamically different steady states were obtained pharmacologically 20 weeks after recovery from surgery. From magnified high resolution images the diameter of the VC of the flow imaged at 7. 5 mHz was measured as the smallest flow diameter in any part of the flow acceleration field (Figure). The velocity time integral (VTI) of AR obtained by color Doppler guided continuous wave (CW) Dopplerwas also recorded. Regurgitant stroke volume(RSV) were calculated by the formula: RSV=π(VC/ 2) 2 ×VTI.

However, in all previous applications of this model, two-phase flow calculations at the entrance and <b>vena</b> <b>contracta</b> regions were eliminated. In this investigation, two additional steps were introduced to improve the accuracy of computations: (1) applying a comprehensive two-fluid model, including the effect of various two-phase flow patterns and the metastability of liquid phase; and (2) performing a two-phase analysis of the evaporating flow through the entrance and <b>vena</b> <b>contracta,</b> which involves simulation of this region as a contraction from the up-stream to the throat, and an expansion from the throat to downstream.

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Mitral regurgitation (MR) {{is considered the}} most common valve disease with a prevalence of 2 – 3 % of signif-icant regurgitation (moderate to severe and severe) in the gen-eral population. Accurate assessment {{of the severity of}} regur-gitation was demonstrated to be of significant importance for patient management and prognosis and consequently has been widely recognized in recent guidelines. However, evaluation of severity of valvular regurgitation can be potentially difficult with the largest challenges presenting in cases of mitral regur-gitation. Real-time three-dimensional echocardiography (RT 3 DE) by the use of color Doppler has the potential to overcome the limitations of conventional flow quantification using 2 D color Doppler methods.

40|$|Medical {{ultrasound}} imaging {{is widely used}} to diagnose cardiacdiseases. The recent availability of real time 3 D ultrasound posesseveral interesting challenges and opportunities, {{and the work of}} thisthesis is devoted to both challenges and opportunities. One of the key benefits of {{ultrasound imaging}} is that its images arereal time. This has been challenged with the recent introduction of 3 Dimages, where the number of ultrasound beams is squared compared totraditional 2 D images. One common way to alleviate this is byreceiving several closely spaced ultrasound beams from each pulsetransmission, which increases acquisition speed but affects the imagequality. Specifically, B-mode images are irregularly sampled and losespatial shift invariance while a bias in the Doppler velocityestimates causes a discontinuity in the velocity estimates in colorflow images. We have found that these artifacts can be reducedsignificantly by interpolation of the beamformed data from overlappingbeams, with the limitation of requiring at least twice the number ofbeamformers. We have also found that valvular regurgitation is one of thecardiac diseases that can benefit greatly from quantification ofseverity using 3 D ultrasound. We have devised a modality that useshigh pulse repetition frequency 3 D Doppler to isolate thebackscattered signal power from the <b>vena</b> <b>contracta</b> of a regurgitantjet. This measure is calibrated with a narrow reference beam insidethe jet to estimate the cross-sectional area of the <b>vena</b> <b>contracta.</b> Wehave validated this method with computer simulations, with an in vitrostudy and finally in vivo with 27 patients who had mitralregurgitation. We found that the cross-sectional area and regurgitantvolume of the <b>vena</b> <b>contracta</b> could be quantified without bias as long as the orifice was sufficiently large for a calibration beam tofit inside it. The severity of smaller regurgitations will beoverestimated, but this does not pose a clinical problem, as thesepatients can easily be identified by standard 2 D Doppler examination and donot typically need further quantification. Finally, we have developed a new, fast 3 D ultrasound simulation methodthat can incorporate anisotropic scattering from cardiac muscle cells. This approach is three orders of magnitudefaster than the most commonly used simulation methods, making it wellsuited for the simulation of dynamic 3 D images for development and testingof quantitative diagnostic methods such as 3 D speckle tracking andvolumetric measurements.

40|$|The {{majority}} of dams contain low-level outlet works, which typically consist of closed conduits that {{run through the}} dam, and are used to release water from the reservoir when the water level is {{below the level of}} the surface spillways. It is also used to flush the reservoir of sediments and to control the elevation of the reservoir. Low-level outlet works typically consist of a gate that controls the flow within a closed conduit that runs through the dam and an air vent that supplies air behind the gate. In the absence of properly designed air vents, negative pressures may develop downstream of the gate. These negative pressures could potentially lead to cavitation and vibration damage. Properly sized air vents help maintain the downstream air pressure at or near atmospheric pressure and/or provide air to absorb the energy generated by cavitation, reducing the potential for damage. The {{majority of}} research done on air vent sizing is for dams having large dam geometry, which consist of a pressurized conduit leading to a vertical slide gate that is followed by a discharge tunnel. The typical air vent design for these large dams uses the water flow rate and the Froude number measured at the <b>vena</b> <b>contracta</b> downstream of the gate. The low-level outlet works for small-to-medium-sized embankment dam geometries typically have an inclined slide gate, installed at the inlet on the upstream face of the dam slope, followed by an elbow that connects to a conduit that passes through the dam and discharges downstream. This type of outlet geometry does not produce the typical <b>vena</b> <b>contracta.</b> Consequently, the use of the Froude number, at the <b>vena</b> <b>contracta,</b> as a characteristic parameter for characterizing airflow demand is not practical. Recently a laboratory study was performed calculating the head-discharge characteristics of low-level outlets for small-to-medium sized dam geometries. In addition to validating some of the previous laboratory-scale air venting research, the objective of this study was field verification of air-demand/air vent sizing predicted by the laboratory-based method. The influence of conduit slope, air port location, and hydraulic jumps on air demand was also evaluated in the laboratory. The findings of this study can be found within this thesis...|$|E
40|$|Calibrations of {{velocity}} transducers {{are generally}} performed at nozzle exits where the turbulence level is minimal. Such nozzles require a high contraction ratio {{and are usually}} short with a consequent effect on stream static pressure due to formation of a <b>vena</b> <b>contracta.</b> Calibrations performed with a Pitot tube and no static pressure correction {{can lead to a}} significant velocity error. Measurements of static pressure, mean velocity and turbulence intensity are presented for a typical high contraction ratio nozzle. These show two distinct flow regimes which can be described very simply by the Reynolds form of the Navier-Stokes equations...|$|E
