40|$|Article {{submitted}} to Historia scientiarum, revised, {{to appear in}} 2017 The history of cosmology in China {{is something of a}} dead topic, our interest in “cosmology” having shifted in recent years to divination, political prophecy, and the metaphysics of correlative thought. This paper attempts to reopen the topic to examine how it was closed. What we know about the history of cosmology in first-millennium China derives from three sources: Shen Yue and Li Chunfeng’s respective “heavenly patterns” monographs (5 th & 7 th cent.) and Gautama Siddhārtha’s Kaiyuan zhanjing (729), all of which present that history as a contest of “three schools, one winner” that was settled by the second century. Evidencing a greater plurality of “schools,” I examine how and why each author perpetuated this single reductionist narrative, focusing in particular on the question of why the latter—an Indian-origin expert—is silent on Indian-origin ideas. If the history of “heaven’s form” cosmology is a dead topic, I argue, it is the medieval historian who wanted it so, albeit to end a debate that was <b>very</b> <b>much</b> still <b>alive</b> in his day. As to why the modern historian is content to let it lie, I suggest that it is for much the same reason...|$|R

Carrot Ironfoundersson and Samuel Vimes are the captain and commander of the City Watch, and hence are opposed to any kind of coup as part of their dedication to the rule of law. Ironfoundersson is noted by Vimes to be one of the few people who actually likes the Patrician, and Vimes, while adamant that he doesn't, shares the dedication to the city felt by Vetinari and Ironfoundersson.

The finding that uncertainty plays a role in explaining how investors respond to information suggests that it should be included as a factor in our pricing models while the fact that market sentiment also has a role is another instance of the importance of human behaviour in establishing prices. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{standard}} philosophical {{account of}} explanation—the deductive nomological {{model in which}} a phenomenon is explained when a description of it is derived from statements of laws and initial conditions—does not {{do justice to the}} explanations generally offered in the life sciences. There, instead, explanations often take the form of specifications of mechanisms, wherein an overall activity of a system is decomposed into sub-functions and these are then localized to components of the system (Bechtel and Richardson, 1993; Machamer, Darden, and Craver, 2000). Mental activities have been no exception. The brain (including the central nervous system) has long been taken to be the bodily organ responsible for mental activities, and the task has been to decompose mental functions and identify the resulting component functions with parts of the brain. In many respects, this effort embodies the vision of Franz Joseph Gall. Modern cognitive neuroscience, the most sophisticated attempt yet to link mental functions with neural structures, has embraced the quest for mechanistic explanation through decomposition and localization (Bechtel, 2000). Thus, part of the legacy of Gall is <b>very</b> <b>much</b> still <b>alive.</b> However, there are different strands in this legacy. Part of our goal is to differentiate three of these strands. One, which we link with Fodor’s proposal for modularity, follows Gall himself in seeking direct neural instantiation of whole mental functions such as language (or at least syntactic processing). The second and third strands both go beyond Gall in decomposing individual mental activities into component processes. It is then component processes at some level in the decomposition that are linked to brain structures. The second strand, prevalent in philosophical accounts of mind-brain relations and in psychological research which is cut of...|$|R

25|$|Nicaraguan {{music is}} a mixture of {{indigenous}} and European, especially Spanish, influences. Musical instruments include the marimba and others common across Central America. The marimba of Nicaragua is uniquely played by a sitting performer holding the instrument on his knees. He is usually accompanied by a bass fiddle, guitar and guitarrilla (a small guitar like a mandolin). This music is played at social functions as a sort of background music. The marimba is made with hardwood plates, placed over bamboo or metal tubes of varying lengths. It is played with two or four hammers.

25|$|Overall, Jean-Jacques Furer {{concludes that}} the {{shrinkage}} of the Romansh-speaking areas is continuing, though at different rates depending on the region. At the same time, he notes that Romansh is still <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>alive,</b> a fact that is obvious in those areas where it retains a strong presence, such as {{most parts of the}} Surselva and the Lower Engadine. It is also assured that Romansh will continue to be transmitted for several more generations, even though each succeeding generation will be more and more rooted in German as well as Romansh. As a result, if the overall linguistic situation does not change, speakers will slowly become fewer and fewer with each generation. He also concludes however, that there are still enough speakers to ensure that Romansh will survive in the long term at least in certain regions. He considers the Romansh-language school system to be the single most crucial factor in this.|$|E
