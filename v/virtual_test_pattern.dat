A detailed study is presented, of the philosophy underpinning <b>virtual</b> <b>testing</b> schemes: highlighting the structure, challenges and opportunities posed by a <b>virtual</b> <b>testing</b> strategy compared with traditional laboratory experiments. The <b>virtual</b> <b>testing</b> process has been discussed from atomistic to macrostructural length scales of analyses. Several implementations of <b>virtual</b> <b>testing</b> frameworks for diverse categories of materials are also presented, with particular emphasis on composites, cellular materials and biomaterials (collectively described as heterogeneous systems, in this context). The robustness of virtual frameworks for prediction of the constitutive behaviour of these materials is discussed.

To reduce product development time, testing and design processes are often overlapped. A key research question is how this overlapping can be planned and managed to minimise risks and costs.

40|$|For a large circuit {{under test}} (CUT), {{it is likely}} that some <b>test</b> <b>patterns</b> result in {{excessive}} power dissipations that exceed the CUT’s power rating. Designers may resort to lowpower automatic <b>test</b> <b>pattern</b> generation (ATPG) tools to solve this problem, which, however, usually leads to larger test data volume and requires extra computational effort, even if such tools are available. Another method is to partition the circuit into multiple subcircuits and test them separately. Unfortunately, this usually involves rerunning the time-consuming ATPG for each partitioned subcircuit and solving {{the problem of how to}} achieve an acceptable fault coverage for the glue logic between subcircuits. In this paper, we propose a novel low-power <b>virtual</b> <b>test</b> partitioning technique without the above-mentioned shortcomings. The basic idea is to partition the circuit in such way that the faults in the glue logic between subcircuits can be detected by patterns with low power dissipation that are applied at the entire circuit level, while the patterns with high power dissipation can be applied within a partitioned subcircuit without loss of fault coverage. Scan chain routing cost has also been considered during the partitioning process. Experimental results show that the proposed technique is very effective in reducing test power. ...|$|R

Firstly, dependency relationships between parameters are established according to the variational character of each parameter in different working state, including transient processes such as false start, cold run, start, acceleration, deceleration, stop and stable processes such as idle, warming, performance test. Then parameter equations are formulated based on least square fit, utilizing actual test data {{of some kind of}} turbo-fan aeroengine as prototype.

40|$|Taking {{advantage}} of major {{recent advances in}} computational methods and the conceptual representation of failure mechanisms, the modeling community is building increasingly realistic models of damage evolution in structural composites. The goal of <b>virtual</b> <b>tests</b> appears to be reachable, in which most (but not all) real experimental tests can be replaced by high fidelity computer simulations. The payoff in reduced cycle time and costs for designing and certifying composite structures is very attractive; and the possibility also arises of considering material configurations that are too complex to certify by purely empirical methods. However, major challenges remain, the foremost being the formal linking of the many disciplines that must be involved in creating C,, a functioning <b>virtual</b> <b>test.</b> Far more than being merely a computational simulation, a <b>virtual</b> <b>test</b> must be a system of hierarchical models, engineering tests, and specialized laboratory experiments, organized to address the assurance of fidelity by applications of information science, model-based statistical analysis, and decision theory. The <b>virtual</b> <b>test</b> must be structured {{so that it can}} function usefully at current levels of knowledge, while continually evolving as new theories and experimental methods enable more refined depictions of damage. To achieve the first generation of a <b>virtual</b> <b>test</b> system, we must pay special attention to unresolved questions relating to the linking of theory and experiment: how can we assure that damage models address all important mechanisms, how can we calibrate the material properties embedded in the models, and what constitutes sufficient validation of model predictions?

To date these compelling issues have been greatly underserved by both the modeling and experimental communities. Model-based analysis of tests has been undertaken only in terms of very simple (linear or continuum) engineering concepts: information-rich tests for more complex damage mechanisms have not been defined; and in fact the information in which experiments need to be rich has not been stated.
