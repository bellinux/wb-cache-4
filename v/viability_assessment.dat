In this study the methods of quantitative culture (CFU), the microplate alamar blue assay (MABA), flow cytometry, the green fluorescent protein microplate assay (GFPMA) and quantitative PCR were investigated and compared for the enumeration and <b>viability</b> <b>assessment</b> of mycobacteria in culture. The MABA and the GFPMA were applied to the enumeration and <b>viability</b> <b>assessment</b> of mycobacteria post-infection. Quantitative culture was found to be simple and low in cost but was lengthy. The MABA, an economic and quick assay, was more sensitive for high mycobacterial concentrations. The flow cytometric enumeration of fluorescent mycobacteria was rapid and sensitive, but was dependent on access to a flow cytometer and therefore was costly. Flow cytometry facilitated enumeration but was limited concerning <b>viability</b> <b>assessment.</b> The GFPMA was a simple, rapid and cost effective assay.

40|$|Among {{the factors}} proximally {{involved}} in the extinction of small isolated populations, genetic deterioration and temporal variation in environmental quality have been the subjects of intensive research in ecological and evolutionary sciences. However, previous theoretical studies and population <b>viability</b> <b>assessments</b> generally assumed a strict dichotomy between {{these two types of}} threat. Yet a number of empirical studies have recently suggested that the effects of genetic deterioration and environmental variation should not be considered independently, by demonstrating that the main effect of inbreeding depression lies with its tendency to exacerbate the deleterious consequences of environmental stress. Capitalizing on these results, I developed a stochastic model to examine the impact of random environmental perturbations on the persistence time of small isolated populations subject to inbreeding depression and mutation accumulation. The model assumes that spontaneous deleterious mutations have more severe effects when perturbations occur, which results in more efficient purging of the mutation load. Under this assumption, I find that negative perturbations may paradoxically improve middle- and long-term species persistence for realistic frequency of occurrence and severity distribution...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background While the {{ultimate}} causes of most species extinctions are environmental, environmental constraints have various secondary consequences on evolutionary and ecological processes. The roles of demographic, genetic mechanisms and their interactions in limiting the viabilities of species or populations have stirred much debate and remain difficult to evaluate {{in the absence}} of demography-genetics conceptual and technical framework. Here, I computed projected times to metapopulation extinction using (1) a model focusing on the effects of species properties, habitat quality, quantity and temporal variability on the time to demographic extinction; (2) a genetic model focusing on the dynamics of the drift and inbreeding loads under the same species and habitat constraints; (3) a demo-genetic model accounting for demographic-genetic processes and feedbacks. Results Results indicate that a given population may have a high demographic, but low genetic viability or vice versa; and whether genetic or demographic aspects will be the most limiting to overall viability depends on the constraints faced by the species (e. g., reduction of habitat quantity or quality). As a consequence, depending on metapopulation or species characteristics, incorporating genetic considerations to demographically-based <b>viability</b> <b>assessments</b> may either moderately or severely reduce the persistence time. On the other hand, purely genetically-based estimates of species viability may either underestimate (by neglecting demo-genetic interactions) or overestimate (by neglecting the demographic resilience) true <b>viability.</b> Conclusion Unbiased <b>assessments</b> of the <b>viabilities</b> of species may only be obtained by identifying and considering the most limiting processes (i. e., demography or genetics), or, preferentially, by integrating them. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Employing plug-in {{electric}} vehicles (PEV) as energy buffers in a smart grid {{could contribute to}} improved power grid stability and facilitate the integration of renewable energies. While the technical feasibility of this concept termed vehicle-to-grid (V 2 G) has been extensively demonstrated, economic concerns remain a crucial barrier for its implementation into practice. A common drawback of previous economic <b>viability</b> <b>assessments,</b> however, is their static approach based on average values which neglects intrinsic system dynamics. Realistically assessing the eco-nomics of V 2 G requires modeling an intelligent agent as a homo economicus who exploits all available information with regard to maximizing its utility. Therefore, a smart control strategy built on real-time information, prediction and more sophis-ticated battery models is proposed in order to optimize an agent’s market partici-pation strategy. By exploiting this information and by dynamically adapting the agent behavior at each time step, an optimal control strategy for energy dispatches of each single PEV is derived. The introduced cost-revenue model, the battery model, and the optimization model are applied in a case study building on data for Singa-pore. It is {{the aim of this}} work to provide a comprehensive view on the economic aspects of V 2 G which are essential for making it a viable business case...|$|R
30|$|Moreover, before {{reasonable}} {{financing for}} renewable energy is provided by local or international investors, adequate resource and <b>viability</b> <b>assessments</b> must be made, among many other policy initiatives and derivatives. For Nigeria, the national energy policy and the renewable energy master plan [3, 4] stipulate the country's desire to increase electricity production {{through the development of}} its alternative energy sources, of which wind, solar and biogas are major. Thus, efforts at measuring and assessing these sources for electricity generation are vital to its energy development. Since wind resources are site specific, wind energy measurements of as many sites as possible are required to have a proper wind classification of a nation. Based on this, several studies have attempted to classify the wind profile characteristics of Nigeria either, by site, region, or nation [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]. Ajayi [5, 6] and Ohunakin et al. [9] profiled the results of some wind energy assessment studies in Nigeria to include those of pre- 2000 and few post- 2000 wind databases. On regional basis, different studies exist that characterized the wind profiles of sites in the North West [8, 9], North East [7, 8, 11], North Central [8, 10], South West [14] and South East [26] regions, respectively. Some recent studies also exist that profiled the wind characteristics of single sites in Nigeria [12, 13, 15, 17, 21, 23].|$|R

40|$|The {{zoonotic}} protozoan parasites Cryptosporidium parvum, and Giardia duodenalis can colonize the gastrointestinal {{tracts of}} many farmed, domestic and wild animals, and {{are capable of}} causing disease in humans. Due to their high prevalence in dairy and beef cattle, farms {{are considered to be}} potential sources of transmission of the parasites to surrounding bodies of water. Additionally, human sewage overflow events can also contaminate nearby water sources. Both protozoa have been detected in various species of shellfish, but a lack of consistency in methods for detection and <b>viability</b> <b>assessments</b> make it difficult to compare data and extrapolate results. Nonetheless, the detection of these parasites in shellfish destined for human consumption is necessary due to the public health risk that these parasites pose. There is currently no legislation requiring public health officials to test for these parasites in potentially contaminated shellfish or water, despite the increasing evidence suggesting the need to implement parasitological analyses. Furthermore, standard depuration procedures are ineffective at inactivating the parasites, and even supplementation with ultraviolet radiation requires extensive periods of depuration to effectively inactivate all (oo) cysts from bivalves. Although there have been no official reports of human gastroenteritis acquired from consuming shellfish contaminated with Cryptosporidium sp. and/or G. duodenalis, studies examining the efficacy of current monitoring and depuration standards in Canada are needed in the event that they are inadequate for the removal of potentially harmful protozoan parasites...|$|R
40|$|Several {{problems}} remain before molecular biology-based techniques, such as PCR, {{are widely}} accepted {{for the detection}} of infectious agents. Among the most formidable of these problems are the inability of the tests to distinguish between viable and nonviable organisms. We approached this problem by using the fact that bacterial mRNA has an extremely short half-life, averaging only a few minutes. We reasoned that by targeting bacterial mRNA by a reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), a positive signal would indicate the presence of a recently viable organism. To test our hypothesis, we chose to target the mRNA coding for the ubiquitous 85 B antigen of mycobacteria. After partially sequencing the gene coding for 85 B, we developed primers that were specific for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In a single-tube, nested, RT-PCR (STN RT-PCR), these primers detected fewer than 40 CFU in spiked sputum samples and as few as 12 CFU in clinical sputum specimens. The sensitivity of STN RT-PCR with smear-negative samples was as good as that of culture. The specificity was 100 %. More importantly, when M. tuberculosis was cultured with and without 1 microgram of isoniazid per ml, this assay could distinguish between those cultures which contained the antibiotic and those which did not. Subcultures on Lowenstein-Jensen agar confirmed the <b>viability</b> <b>assessments</b> of the STN RT-PCR. Control experiments demonstrated that isoniazid did not inhibit the RT-PCR. In addition, when an IS 6110 -targeted, DNA PCR was used to examine the same samples, all samples though 13 days (the last sample) continued to be positive, irrespective of whether isoniazid was present, thereby demonstrating the superiority of an mRNA target in the detection of mycobacterial viability...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: In this study, we {{evaluated}} whether the hypo-osmotic swelling test (HOST) {{can be used}} as a vital marker in combination with peanut agglutinin (PNA) - labeling in fresh and cryopreserved spermatozoa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human sperm populations were exposed to a hypo-osmotic medium for 60 minutes, and then incubated in a 1 µg/mL solution of the fluorescent dye Hoescht 33258 (H 33258) for 10 minutes. Excess stain was removed by washing in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution, and the pellet was resuspended in 100 µL of culture medium. Twenty microliters of this solution were subsequently smeared on a microscope slide, and fixed in ice-cold methanol to permeabilize the sperm membranes. The fixed smears were finally incubated in a 40 -µg/mL FITC-PNA solution for 20 minutes. Simultaneous assessment of acrosome and viability scores was done in a fluorescent microscope equipped with appropriate filters and phase contrast illumination. The same slide was examined for FITC-PNA labeling, tail swelling, and for Hoechst- 33258 staining by interchanging the filters and phase contrast optics. RESULTS: In fresh specimens, HOST was found to provide <b>viability</b> <b>assessments</b> comparable to those obtained using the H 33258 method (r = 0. 95). However, the results of HOST and H 33258 were not correlated in cryopreserved specimens (r = 0. 22). There was no alteration of PNA-labeling due to the HOST or H 33258. CONCLUSIONS: FITC-PNA labeling in conjunction with the visualization of the morphological change induced by exposure to hypo-osmotic solution provides a simple but effective method for establishing the state of acrosomal membrane and viability in fresh human spermatozoa, but this technique is not reliable for cryopreserved ones...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjective: To {{analyze the}} mechanism(s) {{underlying}} homograft degeneration, we designed an experimental {{model in which}} the behavior of cryopreserved autografts and homografts, as well as fresh autografts, implanted in the same animal was compared. Methods: A cryopreserved homograft was implanted in the aorta of 14 sheep. The excised aortic autologous segment was then subjected to cryopreservation, and 1 to 8 weeks later it was implanted 1 to 2 cm below the cryopreserved homograft. The intermediate segment of the native aorta, the fresh autograft, was dissected at this point. Animals were put to death at different times and the implanted segments were harvested together with a portion of native aorta. Histologic and immunohistochemical analyses, as well as cell <b>viability</b> <b>assessments,</b> were then performed on the explanted segments. Similar studies were also conducted on fragments of cryopreserved autografts and homografts before implantation. Results: With {{the exception of a}} partial loss of the endothelium, cryopreserved specimens retained cell viability and morphologic integrity before implantation. Explanted cryopreserved homografts showed profound changes affecting all strata, as well as a decline in cell viability. Lymphocyte infiltrates were found up to 12 months after implantation. Endothelium was always absent in cryopreserved homografts. However, a reendothelialization of the cryopreserved autografts was observed. After an initial period of neuronal degeneration, reenervation of the cryopreserved autograft segment occurred 6 to 12 months after the operation. Findings regarding the fresh autografts were {{similar to those of the}} cryopreserved autografts.

40|$|Abstract Freeze {{tolerance}} is {{a complex}} cold-hardi-ness adaptation that has independently evolved in {{a diverse group of}} organisms, including several ecto-thermic vertebrates. Because {{little is known about the}} mechanistic basis for freeze tolerance in reptiles, we compared responses to experimental freezing in win-ter-acclimatized hatchlings representing nine taxa of temperate North American turtles, including ones that tolerated freezing and others that did not. Viability rates of hatchlings frozen to – 3 C for 72 h ranged from 0 to 100 %. Tolerance to freezing was poor in Sterno-therus odoratus, Graptemys geographica and Trache-mys scripta, intermediate in Chelydra serpentina, and high in Emydoidea blandingii, Chrysemys picta bellii, C. p. marginata, Malaclemys terrapin, and Terrapene ornata, and generally reflected the winter thermal ecology of each taxon. Plasma activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), a novel in vivo index of freeze/ thaw damage, corroborated <b>viability</b> <b>assessments</b> and demonstrated that cryoinjury occurred even in surviv-ing turtles. Irrespective of taxon, cryoinjury tended to be higher in smaller individuals and in those having relatively low water contents; however, bases for these associations were not apparent. Screening for certain organic osmolytes that might promote freezing survival by colligatively reducing ice content and limiting cell dehydration showed that the plasma of unfrozen (control) turtles contained small quantities of glucose (1. 3 – 5. 8 mmol l– 1) and lactate (0. 6 – 3. 2 mmol l– 1) and modest amounts of urea (range of mean values for all taxa 8. 2 – 52. 3 mmol l– 1). Frozen/thawed turtles of all taxa accumulated modest amounts of glucose and lac-tate that jointly raised the plasma solute concentration by 30 – 100 mmol l– 1. We conclude that organic osmo-lytes accumulated both before and during freezing may promote survival in species that have evolved a toler-ance to freezing, but are not necessarily accumulated for that purpose...|$|R
40|$|Cerium oxide {{nanoparticles}} {{have been}} proposed as an anticancer agent, thanks to their ability of tuning the redox activity in accordance to different conditions, which lead to selective roles on healthy and cancer cells. Recent evidence suggested the ability of these nanoparticles to be toxic against cancer cells, while confer protection from oxidative stress, toward healthy cells. The main focus {{of this study was}} to determine the ultrastructural effects of cerium oxide nanoparticles over multiple incubation time of 1, 3, and 7 days on breast healthy and cancer cells. Cellular characterizations were carried out using electron microscopes, both transmission and scanning electron microscopes, while the <b>viability</b> <b>assessments</b> were performed by propidium iodide and trypan blue viability assays. The obtained results of the viability assays and electron microscopy suggested higher toxic effects on the cancer cell line viability by using a nanoceria dose of 300 μg/mL after 1 day of treatment. Such effects were shown to be preserved at 3 days, and in a longer time point of 7 days. On the contrary, the healthy cells underwent less effects on their viability at time point of 1 and 7 days. The 3 days treatment demonstrated a reduction on the number of cells that did not correlate with an increase of the dead cells, which suggested a possible initial decrease of the cell growth rate, which could be due to the high intracellular loading of nanoparticles. To conclude, the overall result of this experiment suggested that 300 μg/mL of CeO 2 nanoparticles is the most suitable dose, within the range and the time point tested, which induces long-lasting cytotoxic effects in breast cancer cells, without harming the normal cells, as highlighted by the viability assays and ultrastructural characterization of electron microscopy analysis...|$|R
