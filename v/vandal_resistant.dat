Products include PTZ, <b>vandal</b> <b>resistant,</b> thermal, outdoor, HDTV, wireless, motion detection and progressive scan cameras. It introduced the industry's first thermal network camera, the AXIS Q1910, in January 2010 and the industry's first HDTV network camera, the AXIS Q1755, in December 2008.|$|E
50|$|Where {{lighting}} circuits {{must not}} be accidentally switched off (for example, school corridors), a <b>vandal</b> <b>resistant</b> switch may be installed. These require a key to operate and so discourage casual or accidental operation of the switch. The tamper resistant switches are also used in corridor and restroom lighting controls in public buildings such as schools.|$|E
5000|$|Inside, {{the train}} {{includes}} additional Emergency Help Points and CCTV cameras. Thales Australia {{was awarded the}} contract to design the train's extensive system of 98 CCTV cameras, Digital Video Recorders, Guard video display units, passenger information displays, emergency intercoms, audio servers, PA systems and hearing loops, which are linked together with Power over Ethernet. The audio and communication system supplied by Open Access Pty Ltd included 8 channels of audio per car with extensive DSP to optimize audio quality and intelligibility. The Hearing Loop system was a world first Class-D based amplifier and utilised 3 loops per car. Hearing loop coverage exceeded 90% of the vehicle. The CCTV cameras supplied by Axis Communications utilise Progressive scanning technology to allow capturing of events in clear high resolution, with no distortion in quick movement individual frames.The CCTV cameras are designed to withstand vibration and features technologies such as an in-built heater to prevent condensation and alarms to alert of removal or obstruction.The train flooring utilises Treadmaster TM8, made from a polymer-based material {{that is designed to}} be durable, <b>vandal</b> and graffiti <b>resistant.</b> They are also designed with safety in mind, being highly fire resistant with low smoke toxicity output.Carriage interiors were designed by Transport Design International ...|$|R
50|$|One of Friedberg's {{most notable}} {{projects}} was the Jacob Riis Plaza, {{undertaken in the}} mid 1960s. The Jacob Riis Complex {{is a series of}} 14-story buildings along the Lower East Side of Manhattan. The large open spaces between the blocks were poorly laid out, with little consideration of the residents' needs. Friedberg's redesign separated the space into human scaled areas using pergolas, terraces and mounds. Materials and features were selected for their robustness, for example large timbers, and <b>vandal</b> <b>resistant</b> lighting.|$|E
50|$|In {{building}} wiring, light switches {{are installed}} at convenient locations to control lighting and occasionally other circuits. By use of multiple-pole switches, multiway switching {{control of a}} lamp {{can be obtained from}} two or more places, such as the ends of a corridor or stairwell. A wireless light switch allows remote control of lamps for convenience; some lamps include a touch switch which electronically controls the lamp if touched anywhere. In public buildings several types of <b>vandal</b> <b>resistant</b> switches are used to prevent unauthorized use.|$|E
50|$|Some of the {{earliest}} signals produced by Wheelock were the A-1 series of AC-powered, dual-projector electromechanical horns. In the early 1970s, Wheelock introduced the 31 (AC-powered) and 34 (DC-powered) series of electromechanical horns. Around 1976, Wheelock created the 7001 (2-wire, flush-mount DC), 7002 (2-wire, surface-mount DC), 34+WS (4-wire, surface-mount DC), and 7004 (2-wire, surface-mount AC) electromechanical horn/strobes. These were the first fire alarm signals to use xenon strobes instead of incandescent lights. The horn and strobe on the 7001 and 7002 models are wired in series, causing the horn to stutter when the strobe flashes. Around 1983, Wheelock redesigned the horn's grilles, making them <b>vandal</b> <b>resistant.</b> This product line became extremely popular among third-party security companies, such as Honeywell, Ademco, and Cerberus Pyrotronics (now part of Siemens AG). In 1994, Wheelock discontinued this series, because their low-intensity strobes {{did not meet the}} new light distribution requirements of the ADA. The 31T is still in production today for general signaling purposes.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of 21 PV-powered low pressure sodium lighting systems on a multi-use {{has been documented}} in this paper. Specific areas for evaluation include the <b>vandal</b> <b>resistant</b> PV modules, constant voltage and on/off PV charge controllers, flooded deep-cycle lead-antimony and valve regulated lead-acid (VLRA) gel batteries, and low pressure sodium ballasts and lights. The PV lighting system maintenance intervals and lessons learned have been documented over the past 2. 5 years. The above performance data has shown that with careful hardware selection, installation, and maintenance intervals the PV lighting systems will operate reliably...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of fossil}} fuels to {{generate}} electricity has already {{been identified as a}} major contributor to global warming and climate change. Many countries have already made plans to reduce their fossil fuel consumption and increased the contribution of renewable energies in total energy supply. One of the commonly used renewable energy sources is the sun and the use of photovoltaic cells to convert solar radiation into electricity is rapidly expanding throughout the world. Photovoltaic cells available in the commercial market can be classified into two main categories-crystalline silicon cells and thin-film cells. Crystalline silicon cells are generally more popular than thin-film cells as they have been developed and in use for over 20 years. However, the demand for modern amorphous thin-film cells is increasing in recent years due to their low embodied energy resulting in a substantial saving in manufacturing cost. Furthermore, amorphous thin-film cells are lightweight, flexible and <b>vandal</b> <b>resistant</b> which made them particularly suitable to be used in buildings. Some overseas researches suggest that thin-film cells perform better in low irradiance and high temperature conditions. Coupling with the fact that flexible amorphous thin-film laminates are more aesthetically pleasing than their predecessors. The technology shows a great promise for the future. The paper will explore the potential application of adopting amorphous thin film technology {{as an integral part of}} building design and construction. The likely performance of amorphous thin-film cell operating under typical local conditions will also be discussed in the paper...|$|E
