5|$|On 6March 1429 Joan of Arc {{arrived at}} Château de Chinon. She claimed to hear heavenly <b>voices</b> <b>that</b> said Charles would grant her an army {{to relieve the}} siege of Orléans. While staying at the castle she resided in the Tour du Coudray. Charles met with her two days after her arrival and then sent her to Poitiers {{so that she could}} be cross-examined to ensure she was telling the truth. Joan {{returned}} to Chinon in April where Charles granted her supplies and sent her to join the army at Orléans.|$|E
5|$|Schizophrenia is {{a mental}} {{disorder}} characterized by abnormal social behavior {{and failure to}} understand what is real. Common symptoms include false beliefs, unclear or confused thinking, hearing <b>voices</b> <b>that</b> others do not hear, reduced social engagement and emotional expression, and a lack of motivation. People with schizophrenia often have additional mental health problems such as anxiety, depressive, or substance-use disorders. Symptoms typically come on gradually, begin in young adulthood, and last a long time.|$|E
5|$|Waugh's {{health in}} the winter of 1953–54 was indifferent, and he was beset with various {{personal}} anxieties that were stifling his ability to work. He was also consuming alcohol, bromide and chloral in large amounts. In search of a peaceful environment in which he could resume writing, he embarked on a sea voyage to Ceylon, but was driven to the point of madness by imagined <b>voices</b> <b>that</b> assailed him throughout the voyage. These experiences are mirrored in the novel by those of Pinfold, a successful writer in the Waugh mould who, as an antidote to his lassitude and chronic insomnia, is dosing himself with a similar regimen of drugs. This cocktail brings about a series of hallucinatory episodes during a sea voyage taken by Pinfold {{for the sake of his}} health; he hears <b>voices</b> <b>that</b> insult, taunt and threaten him. He leaves the ship, but his unseen tormentors follow him. On his return to England, his wife convinces him that the voices were imaginary, and his doctor diagnoses poisoning from the bromide and chloral mixture. Pinfold, however, also views the episode as a private victory over the forces of evil.|$|E
60|$|Stephen {{listened in}} scornful silence. She bows her old {{head to a}} <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she slights. To the <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> will shrive and oil for the grave all there is of her but her woman's unclean loins, of man's flesh made not in God's likeness, the serpent's prey. And to the loud <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> now bids her be silent with {{wondering}} unsteady eyes.|$|R

5000|$|Charles de Lint of The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction praised Parks' [...] "remarkable storytelling" [...] in a <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> is, [...] "{{sometimes}} lyrical, sometimes hard-edged; {{sometimes in}} a <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> sounds as ancient {{as the first}} stories told around our early ancestors' campfires; sometimes in a <b>voice</b> so new <b>that</b> {{we have yet to}} hear it." ...|$|R
5|$|Exasperated, Candace {{returns to}} the circus, where Jeremy has saved a spot for her, only for the boys to mistake her for Buford and include her in his act. She is sent flying through {{the roof of the}} tent, just as Doofenshmirtz and Perry are flying overhead. Doofenshmirtz's machine activates, giving {{everyone}} in the cirque audience high-pitched <b>voices</b> <b>that</b> cause the tent to rupture. The high velocity of Doofenshmirtz's flying machine propels the tent up into the air, destroying the machine and sending Doofenshmirtz flying off (with a high voice). Jeremy gives a CD to Candace, but Candace is not at the house, but Candace then gets the CD from Jeremy.|$|E
5|$|The {{harmonium}} {{was out of}} {{tune with}} everything. It wasn't even in tune with itself. She insisted on playing it on everything {{so we had to}} figure out ways to separate her voice from it as much as possible and then find instrumental <b>voices</b> <b>that</b> would be compatible with the harmonium track... As an arranger you're usually trying to take the songs and put a structure on them, but what I thought was valuable was when you took the centre out of the track and worked around the central core of the tonality and changes. That left you with a sort of floating free-form tapestry behind what she was doing, which is when things became more abstract.|$|E
5|$|Al-Azhar was not {{unaffected}} by the 2011 Egyptian revolution that saw the removal of Hosni Mubarak as president of Egypt. Student government elections {{in the months following}} the revolution resulted in an overwhelming victory for the once banned Muslim Brotherhood. Protests demanding that the military junta ruling Egypt restore the mosque's independence from the state broke out, and the mosque itself commissioned the writing of a draft law that would grant al-Azhar greater independence from the government. Within al-Azhar, debate on its future and rightful role within the state has replaced what had been a mollified single-voice in support of the policies of the Mubarak regime. The various views on al-Azhar's future role in Egypt come from several parties, including leading Islamist organizations such as the Muslim Brotherhood, liberal <b>voices</b> <b>that</b> wish to see al-Azhar stand as a bulwark against ultra-conservative Islamists (known as Salafists), and those that hope to see al-Azhar become wholly independent from the state and in complete control of its finances, leadership, and further that it be placed in charge of the religious ministries of the state.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the {{psychiatrist}} Kurt Schneider listed {{the forms of}} psychotic symptoms that he thought distinguished schizophrenia from other psychotic disorders. These are called first-rank symptoms or Schneider's first-rank symptoms. They include delusions of being controlled by an external force, the belief that thoughts are being inserted into or withdrawn from one's conscious mind, the belief that one's thoughts are being broadcast to other people, and hearing hallucinatory <b>voices</b> <b>that</b> comment on one's thoughts or actions or that {{have a conversation with}} other hallucinated voices. Although they have significantly contributed to the current diagnostic criteria, the specificity of first-rank symptoms has been questioned. A review of the diagnostic studies conducted between 1970 and 2005 found that they allow neither a reconfirmation nor a rejection of Schneider's claims, and suggested that first-rank symptoms should be de-emphasized in future revisions of diagnostic systems. The absence of first-rank symptoms should raise suspicion of a medical disorder, however.|$|E
5|$|Vampyr {{was filmed}} between 1930 and 1931. Everything being shot on location, as Dreyer {{believed}} {{it would be}} beneficial by lending the dream-like ghost world of the film as well as allowing them to save money by not having to rent studio space. Dreyer originally wanted Vampyr to be a silent film, as it uses many elements of the silent era such as title cards to explain the story. Dialogue in the film was kept to a minimum. For the scenes with dialogue, the actors mouthed their lines in French, German and English so their lip movements would correspond to the <b>voices</b> <b>that</b> {{were going to be}} recorded in post-production. There is no record of the English version being completed. The scenes in the chateau were shot in April and May 1930. The chateau also acted as housing for the cast and crew during the filming. Life in the chateau was unpleasant for them as it was cold and infested with rats. The church yard scenes were shot in August 1930. The church was not an actual church, but a barn with a number of tombstones placed around it. This set was designed by the art director Hermann Warm.|$|E
25|$|There {{were some}} <b>voices</b> <b>that</b> called for cabinet {{resignation}} among the Estonian public as well. The most aggressive criticism {{was made by}} members of the Center Party, who had been left out of the coalition talks during the then-recent elections.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} what perceptual differences existed between a natural recorded human voice and a synthetic <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> was created to sound like the same voice. This process was meant to mimic the differences between a <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> would be used for Message Banking and a <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> would be created by the ModelTalker system. Forty speech pathology graduate students (mean age = 23 years) rated voices on clarity, naturalness, pleasantness, and overall similarity. Analysis of data showed that the natural human voice was consistently rated as more natural, clear, and pleasant. In addition, participants generally rated the two voices as very different. This demonstrates that, at least in terms of perception, using the method of Message Banking results in a <b>voice</b> <b>that</b> is overall perceived more positively than the voice created using ModelTalker...|$|R

25|$|Within ghost {{hunting and}} parapsychology, {{electronic}} voice phenomena (EVP) are sounds found on elctronic recordings that are interpreted as spirit <b>voices</b> <b>that</b> have been either unintentionally recorded or intentionally requested and recorded. Parapsychologist Konstantīns Raudive, who popularized {{the idea in}} the 1970s, described EVP as typically brief, usually {{the length of a}} word or short phrase.|$|E
25|$|Music {{from the}} Basque Country {{nowadays}} caters to {{almost all the}} tastes of music, {{with a wide range}} of music being played in Basque, from choral music (Oldarra in Biarritz) to elaborate music bands (e.g. Bidaia) to ska or hardcore trends, while it's much praised lately for the fine bare <b>voices</b> <b>that</b> have arisen with the likes of Maddi Oihenart, Maialen Errotabehere or Amaren Alabak, to mention but a few.|$|E
25|$|The {{retention}} of original material (carving, woodwork, etc.) {{tended to be}} of little importance to the early restorers: appearance was all, and much good old work was discarded {{to be replaced by}} modern replacement in the chosen style. Different architects had different degrees of sympathy with original material, and as the century progressed greater care was generally taken; this was at least {{partly as a result of}} the increasingly louder <b>voices</b> <b>that</b> were raised in opposition.|$|E

25|$|Sutcliffe {{was charged}} at Dewsbury on 5 January. At his trial, he {{pleaded not guilty}} to 13 charges of murder, but guilty to {{manslaughter}} on the grounds of diminished responsibility. The basis of his defence was he claimed to be the tool of God's will. Sutcliffe claimed to have heard <b>voices</b> <b>that</b> ordered him to kill prostitutes while working as a gravedigger. He said the voices originated from a headstone of a deceased Polish man, Bronisław Zapolski, and that the voices were that of God.|$|E
25|$|Mermaids- Stubborn, yet {{loyal and}} true to their word, mermaids have amazing <b>voices</b> <b>that</b> can hypnotize giants and humans. They {{are not easy}} to strike a deal with, as they {{frequently}} want something in return and usually take people as hostages to ensure the deal is kept. They {{seem to be able to}} do some magic as well, as they owned a cap able to make humans breathe underwater (similarly to the caps worn by merfolk in faery tales to walk on the shore).|$|E
25|$|Not long after, Treyarch {{released}} the modding tools for Call of Duty: World at War. These tools {{were the same}} ones used to create all the other Call of Duty series games, but with slight changes version to version, which can be downloaded online. Kiefer Sutherland and Gary Oldman were cast as voice actors for the game. Sutherland voices the narrator and squad leader of the American campaign, Sergeant Roebuck, while Oldman <b>voices</b> <b>that</b> of the Soviet campaign, Sergeant Reznov. A full-sized replica PBY Catalina was constructed for motion capture use.|$|E

25|$|The dialogical part of ontological hermeneutics {{states that}} Dasein co-creates meaning from his self-interpretations and {{subjective}} experiences {{through the process}} of dialogue, i.e. conversing with others. Human beings are constantly engaged in dialogue with others and their world around them. Macmurray postulated that dialogue is our primary, if not only, source of knowledge. Bakhtin claimed that human beings are more than beings who engage in dialogue, but that they are dialogical beings composed of multiple simultaneous voices: <b>voices</b> <b>that</b> are their own and <b>voices</b> <b>that</b> belong to others. These voices represent who Dasein is, his or her dispositions, and his or her roles in society. In this case, the term voice is meant to signify a particular role Dasein takes up or a particular aspect of who Dasein is. These voices of human beings are not {{to be thought of as}} hallucinated voices, as in psychosis, but rather different elements of who Dasein is: I like Italian food as one voice and I do not like it when people interrupt me as another voice, or I am a therapist as one voice but I am a patient when I visit my primary care physician as another. That is not to say that these voices determine Dasein's actions or behaviors. On the contrary, Dasein is an agentic being (a being capable of choice) who thinks, acts, and chooses for himself. But this process “emerges through conversations among functionally independent elements within persons” (Lysaker & Lysaker: 2). The emergence of these multiple voices within us via multitudes of ongoing conversations with others is why Bakhtin described us as polyphonic beings, or “products of ongoing series of dialogues among distinct voices” (Lysaker & Lysaker: 2).|$|E
25|$|Among the few {{authentic}} <b>voices</b> <b>that</b> {{belonged to}} less experienced actors was the lead, Juraj Nvota, {{a student of}} theater directing at the University of Performing Arts in Bratislava. Sally Salingová had gained some performing experience as a singer with the then popular Braňo Hronec jazz band. Věra Bílá {{was born in the}} Czech Republic but her father, the musician Karol Giňa, and mother were born and grew up in eastern Slovakia (she herself moved there in 2005), which gave her experience with the language and her few Slovak and Romani lines were included. On the other hand, one of the film's most authentic-appearing characters, the granny Jakub feared dead, was actually played by the veteran actress Naďa Hejná from one of Slovakia's old, notable families who had a lifetime of amateur and professional experience on the stage in Martin.|$|E
25|$|In {{traditional}} Western notation, {{the scale}} {{used for a}} composition is usually indicated by a key signature at the beginning to designate the pitches that make up that scale. As the music progresses, the pitches used may change and introduce a different scale. Music can be transposed from one scale to another for various purposes, often to accommodate the range of a vocalist. Such transposition raises or lowers the overall pitch range, but preserves the intervallic relationships of the original scale. For example, transposition from the key of C major to D major raises all pitches of the scale of C major equally by a whole tone. Since the interval relationships remain unchanged, transposition may be unnoticed by a listener, however other qualities may change noticeably because transposition changes {{the relationship of the}} overall pitch range compared to the range of the instruments or <b>voices</b> <b>that</b> perform the music. This often affects the music's overall sound, as well as having technical implications for the performers.|$|E
