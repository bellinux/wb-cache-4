40|$|Methyl iodide (CH 3 I) is a <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>halogen</b> {{compound}} that contributes {{significantly to the}} transport of iodine from the ocean to the atmosphere, where it {{plays an important role}} in tropospheric chemistry. CH 3 I is naturally produced and occurs in the global ocean. The processes involved in the formation of CH 3 I, however, are not fully understood. In fact, there is an ongoing debate whether production by phytoplankton or photochemical degradation of organic matter is the main source term. Here, both the biological and photochemical production mechanisms are considered in a biogeochemical module that is coupled to a one-dimensional water column model for the eastern tropical Atlantic. The model is able to reproduce observed subsurface maxima of CH 3 I concentrations. But, the dominating source process cannot be clearly identified as subsurface maxima can occur due to both direct biological and photochemical production. However, good agreement between the observed and simulated difference between surface and subsurface methyl iodide concentrations is achieved only when direct biological production is taken into account. Production rates for the biological CH 3 I source that were derived from published laboratory studies are shown to be inappropriate for explaining CH 3 I concentrations in the eastern tropical Atlantic...|$|R
40|$|Production {{pathways}} of {{the prominent}} <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> <b>halogen</b> compound methyl iodide (CH 3 I) {{are not fully}} understood. Based on observations, production of CH 3 I via photochemical degradation of organic material or via phytoplankton production has been proposed. Additional insights could not be gained from correlations between observed biological and environmental variables or from biogeochemical modeling to identify unambiguously the source of methyl iodide. In this study, we aim {{to address this question}} of source mechanisms with a three-dimensional global ocean general circulation model including biogeochemistry (MPIOM–HAMOCC (MPIOM – Max Planck Institute Ocean Model HAMOCC – HAMburg Ocean Carbon Cycle model)) by carrying out a series of sensitivity experiments. The simulated fields are compared with a newly available global data set. Simulated distribution patterns and emissions of CH 3 I differ largely for the two different production pathways. The evaluation of our model results with observations shows that, on the global scale, observed surface concentrations of CH 3 I can be best explained by the photochemical production pathway. Our results further emphasize that correlations between CH 3 I and abiotic or biotic factors do not necessarily provide meaningful insights concerning the source of origin. Overall, we find a net global annual CH 3 I air–sea flux that ranges between 70 and 260 Gg yr − 1. On the global scale, the ocean acts as a net source of methyl iodide for the atmosphere, though in some regions in boreal winter, fluxes are of the opposite direction (from the atmosphere to the ocean) ...|$|R
40|$|Tap water {{typically}} contains numerous halogenated disinfection byproducts (DBPs) as {{a result}} of disinfection, especially of chlorination. Among halogenated DBPs, brominated ones are generally significantly more toxic than their chlorinated analogues. In this study, with the aid of ultra performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry by setting precursor ion scans of m/z 79 / 81, whole spectra of polar brominated DBPs in simulated tap water samples without and with boiling were revealed. Most polar brominated DBPs were thermally unstable and their levels were substantially reduced after boiling via decarboxylation or hydrolysis; the levels of a few aromatic brominated DBPs increased after boiling through decarboxylation of their precursors. A novel adsorption unit for <b>volatile</b> total <b>organic</b> <b>halogen</b> was designed, which enabled the evaluation of halogen speciation and mass balances in the simulated tap water samples during boiling. After boiling for 5 min, the overall level of brominated DBPs was reduced by 62. 8 %, of which 39. 8 % was volatilized and 23. 0 % was converted to bromide; the overall level of chlorinated DBPs was reduced by 61. 1 %, of which 44. 4 % was volatilized and 16. 7 % was converted to chloride; the overall level of halogenated DBPs was reduced by 62. 3 %. The simulated tap water sample without boiling was cytotoxic in a chronic (72 h) exposure to mammalian cells; this cytotoxicity was reduced by 76. 9 % after boiling for 5 min. The reduction in cytotoxicity corresponded with the reduction in overall halogenated DBPs. Thus, boiling of tap water can be regarded as a "detoxification" process and may reduce human exposure to halogenated DBPs through tap water ingestion...|$|R

40|$|An {{exhaustive}} {{characterization of}} the biogas from some waste disposal facilities has been carried out. The analysis includes the main components (methane, carbon dioxide, nitrogen and oxygen) as well as trace components such as hydrogen sulphide, ammonia and VOCs (<b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> compounds) including siloxanes and halogenated compounds. VOCs were measured by GC/MS (Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry) using two different procedures: thermal desorption of the Tenax TA and Carbotrap 349 tubes and SPME (Solid Phase Micro-Extraction). A method has been established to measure the total halogen content of the biogas with the AOX (adsorbable organically bound halogens) technique. The equipment {{used to analyze the}} samples was a Total <b>Organic</b> <b>Halogen</b> Analyzer (TOX- 100). Similar results were obtained when comparing the TOX (Total <b>Organic</b> <b>Halogen)</b> values with those obtained by GC/MS.

Composite-style indoor air quality references, which reflect the combined effects of multiple <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> compounds, {{can be used to}} determine ventilation rate requirements based on building material emissions. The lowest concentration of interest concept was adopted to implement the idea. Twenty-eight building materials selected from the National Research Council of Canada database were subjected to emission modelling, resulting in 101 <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> compounds as a starting <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> compound pool. A method was proposed to generate a <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> compound priority list that determines ventilation rate requirements while considering ozone-initiated reactions. Three priority lists were obtained based on three lowest concentration of interest schemes, i. e., AFSSET, AgBB and EU-LCI, with each consisting of 172 ̆ 01321 <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> compounds that were most likely to attribute to large ventilation rate requirements.

40|$|The brown {{macroalga}} Saccharina latissima (Linnaeus) C. E. Lane, C. Mayes, Druehl & G. W. Saunders (formerly Laminaria saccharina [L. ] Lamouroux) {{was exposed}} to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) in the mW UV-A and mW UV-B range in the laboratory for up to 28 days. The release rates of volatile organohalogens, such as chloroform, bromoform, dibromomethane and methyl iodide, were determined. From these rates, the total emission of reactive <b>organic</b> <b>halogens</b> was calculated. The results revealed that exposure to UVR significantly affected the emission of reactive <b>organic</b> <b>halogens</b> by the macroalga under investigation. An increase in the release of reactive organic iodine was observed for the algal species. In contrast, for reactive organic bromine and reactive organic chlorine, a decrease in emission by the macroalga was observed.

These areas include the postmortem interval (PMI), cadaver dogs, postmortem toxicology, search and rescue, human scent as a biometric measure, human scent as an attractant to mosquitoes, and cancer biomarkers. In the research of <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> compounds associated with human decomposition, a number of methods and techniques are being used, which leads to inconsistencies in the compounds detected. The difficulty in the procurement of human tissues for research also adds to the inconsistencies and the limitations of current research. The domestic pig is often used as a substitute for human research because it has been determined to be the best model corpse. Due to the many restrictions associated with testing on human cadavers, pigs are often substituted because of their anatomical and physiological similarities to humans. This study analyzed the <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> compounds associated with the decomposition of pig tissue {{as a model for the}} <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> compounds associated with human decomposition. Heated passive headspace concentration with activated carbon as the adsorbent material followed by analysis with GC/MS was tested for its reliability in recovering and detecting <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> compounds of decomposition. The <b>volatile</b> <b>organic</b> compounds detected were examined for their applicability in determining the postmortem interval and for their use as cadaver dog training aids.
