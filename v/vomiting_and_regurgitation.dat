5000|$|When a {{face mask}} {{is used in}} {{conjunction}} with a manual resuscitator, the intent is for the force-delivered air or oxygen to inflate the lungs. However air entering the patient also has access to the stomach via the esophagus, which can inflate if the resuscitator is squeezed too hard (causing air flow that is too rapid for the lungs to absorb alone) or too much (causing excess air to divert to the stomach)." [...] Gastric inflation can lead to vomiting and subsequent aspiration of stomach contents into the lungs, which has been cited as a major hazard of bag-valve-mask ventilation, with one study suggesting this effect is difficult to avoid even for the most skilled and experienced users, stating [...] "When using a self-inflatable bag, even experienced anesthesiologists in our study may have performed ventilation with too short inspiratory times and/or too large tidal volumes, which resulted in stomach inflation in some cases." [...] The study goes on to state that [...] "Stomach inflation is a complex problem that may cause regurgitation, acid aspiration, and, possibly, death." [...] When stomach inflation leads to vomiting of highly acidic stomach acids, delivery of subsequent breaths can force these caustic acids down into the lungs where they cause life-threatening or fatal lung injuries including Mendelson's syndrome, aspiration pneumonia, adult respiratory distress syndrome and [...] "pulmonary injuries similar to that seen in victims of chlorine gas exposure". [...] Apart from the risks of gastric inflation causing <b>vomiting</b> <b>and</b> <b>regurgitation,</b> at least two reports have been found indicating that gastric insufflation itself remains clinically problematic even when vomiting does not occur. In one case of failed resuscitation (leading to death), gastric insufflation in a 3-month-old boy put sufficient pressure against the lungs that [...] "precluded effective ventilation". [...] Another reported complication was a case of stomach rupture caused by stomach over-inflation from a manual resuscitator. [...] The causative factors and degree of risk of inadvertent stomach inflation have been examined, with one published study revealing that during prolonged resuscitation up to 75% of air delivered to the patient may inadvertently be delivered to the stomach instead of the lungs.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To come {{even closer}} to the {{functional}} composition of human milk, acidic oligosaccharides (AOS) from pectin were added to well known neutral prebiotics (galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) and long-chain fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS)). The effect of AOS and GOS/FOS/AOS on intestinal flora, stool characteristics as well as acceptance and tolerance was investigated. METHODS: Human milk contains 75 % to 85 % neutral and 15 % to 25 % acidic oligosaccharides. In this prospective, randomized, double blind study, a mixture of 80 % neutral oligosaccharides (from long-chain galacto- and long-chain fructo-oligosaccharides) with 20 % acidic oligosaccharides derived from pectin hydrolysis was investigated. Forty-six term infants were fed a standard formula supplemented with either maltodextrin as control (n= 15), or with 0. 2 g acidic oligosaccharides (n= 16), or with the latter plus 0. 6 g neutral oligosaccharides (mixture of galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharides; n= 15). Fecal flora using plating technique and pH were measured. Stool characteristics and possible side effects (crying, <b>vomiting,</b> <b>and</b> <b>regurgitation)</b> were recorded. RESULTS: There {{was no difference in}} the bifidobacteria counts between the control and the group supplemented with acidic oligosaccharides alone (8. 75 +/- 0. 50 vs. 8. 58 +/- 0. 94 log colony forming units [CFU]/g stool). In infants fed the combination of acidic and neutral oligosaccharides, bifidobacteria were increased (9. 61 +/- 0. 70 log CFU/g stool; P< 0. 01). The same pattern was observed with lactobacilli. Stool consistency was softest in infants fed the complete oligosaccharide mixture, but also in those fed formula supplemented with acidic oligosaccharides alone, the stool consistency was significantly softer compared with the control group. Fecal pH increased in the controls, remained constant in acidic oligosaccharides alone, and decreased in the complete mixture of oligosaccharides group. CONCLUSION: There was no difference in growth, crying, <b>vomiting,</b> <b>and</b> <b>regurgitation</b> patterns between the groups. In summary, acidic oligosaccharides from pectin hydrolysate are well tolerated as ingredient in infant formulae but do not affect intestinal microecology...|$|E

This is an {{open access}} article {{distributed}} under theCreativeCommonsAttribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in anymedium, provided the originalwork is properly cited. Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is very common in children due to immaturity of the antireflux barrier. In critically ill patients {{there is also a}} high incidence due to a partial or complete loss of pressure of the lower esophageal sphincter though other factors, {{such as the use of}} nasogastric tubes, treatment with adrenergic agonists, bronchodilators, or opiates and mechanical ventilation, can further increase the risk of GER. <b>Vomiting</b> <b>and</b> <b>regurgitation</b> are the most common manifestations in infants and are considered pathological when they have repercussions on the nutritional status. In critically ill children, damage to the esophageal mucosa predisposes to digestive tract hemorrhage and nosocomial pneumonia secondary to repeated microaspiration. GER is mainly alkaline in children, as is also the case in critically ill pediatric patients. pH-metry combined with multichannel intraluminal impedance is therefore the technique of choice for diagnosis. The proton pump inhibitors are the drugs of choice for the treatment of GER because they have a greater effect, longer duration of action, and a good safety profile. 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between gastroparesis and GERD is multi-factorial. The delay in gastric emptying associated with gastroparesis {{can lead to}} prolonged gastric retention of food that may have a propensity to reflux. Because gastroparesis allows material {{to remain in the}} stomach, there is an increase in the gastroesophageal pressure gradient, gastric volume, and the volume of potential refluxate. Additionally, the prolonged exposure of material in the stomach can increase gastric acid secretion. The onset of gastroparesis has been attributed to several causes, including comorbidities (mainly diabetes), surgical complications, and the use of specific medications (including anticholinergics, narcotics, tricyclic antidepressants, and calcium channel blockers). The etiology of some cases of gastroparesis remain unclear, a condition termed idiopathic gastroparesis. Symptoms commonly associated with gastroparesis or GERD, including nausea, <b>vomiting,</b> <b>and</b> <b>regurgitation,</b> may delay drug absorption. This has the potential to greatly impact systemic absorption and concentration of drugs. Several patient populations may benefit from the use of medication formulations that offer an alternative to swallowing a traditional tablet. In addition, prokinetic drugs, such as metoclopramide, are used in the first-line treatment of gastroparesis to improve the contractility of the gut muscles, as well as the movement of contents through the gastrointestinal system and regulate drug metabolism and absorption...|$|E
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a case of}} a pregnant female dog, of English bulldog breed, three years old, which was brought to Belgrade Faculty of Veterinary Medicine because of inability for normal parturition. Cesarean section is an urgent intervention both in human and in veterinary medicine. Anesthesia of a pregnant dog should be carried out very carefully, because of all the physiological changes that appear during pregnancy, as well as the impact of anesthetics on embryos themselves. Anesthetics, analgesics and sedatives pass through blood brain barrier, but also their transport goes through placenta to embryo, so for that reason {{it is not possible to}} anesthetize only mother and to avoid anesthesia effects on the embryo. Therefore, anesthetics with short time of action which metabolize quickly and have minimal negative effect on embryos are recommended. When choosing the right analgesics and anesthetics, there should be known that female dogs in which it is necessary to do Cesarean section belong to the group of high risk patients.

40|$|Background: Due to the {{increased}} prevalence of obesity in many countries, the number of bariatric surgeries is increasing. They are considered the most effective treatment for obesity. In the postoperative there may be difficulties {{with the quality of}} alimentation, tolerance to various types of food, as well as <b>vomiting</b> <b>and</b> <b>regurgitation.</b> Few surveys are available to assess these difficulties in the postoperative. Aim:To perform a systematic literature review about food tolerance in patients undergoing bariatric surgery using the questionnaire "Quality of Alimentation", and compare the results between different techniques. Method: A descriptive-exploratory study where the portals Medline and Scielo were used. The following headings were used in english, spanish and portuguese: quality of alimentation, bariatric surgery and food tolerance. A total of 88 references were found, 14 used the questionnaire "Quality of Alimentation" and were selected. Results: In total, 2745 patients were interviewed of which 371 underwent to gastric banding, 1006 to sleeve gastrectomy, 1113 to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, 14 to biliopancreatic diversion associated with duodenal switch, 83 were non-operated obese, and 158 non-obese patients. The questionnaire showed good acceptability. The biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch had the best food tolerance in the postoperative when compared to other techniques, but it was evaluated in a single article with a small sample. The longer the time after the operation, the better is the food tolerance. Comparing the sleeve gastrectomy and the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, there are still controversial results in the literature. The gastric banding had the worst score of food tolerance among all the techniques evaluated. Conclusion: The questionnaire is easy and fast to assess the food tolerance in patients after bariatric surgery.
