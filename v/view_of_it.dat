5|$|The {{shipping}} channel {{approaching the}} Fox River in Green Bay was changed {{a number of}} times in order to accommodate vessels of increasing draft. The Army Corps of Engineers also modified the channel in the mid 1920's. The Green Bay Harbor Entrance buoy was established in 1927 to mark this point until the Bureau of Lighthouses could obtain funds for a more permanent solution. The acetylene buoy emitted a flash of 0.3 seconds duration every 3 seconds and had a wave-activated bell. The light {{is one of the few}} on the Great Lakes still powered by submarine cable. It is issued from a pair of 300mm Tideland Signal ML300 acrylic optics mounted on the gallery railing. Because the light is too far out to be seen well from shore, the only good <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> is from a boat.|$|E

500|$|Other critics {{offered a}} more {{positive}} impression of the piece. The Examiner celebrated Etty's having [...] "outdone his former self, {{and most of his}} contemporaries". A reviewer in The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction said that [...] "few pictures have attracted or deserved more attention than this masterly production," [...] describing the figures as [...] "graceful and elegant". The Athenaeum thought it [...] "decidedly the most attractive picture in the whole Exhibition", noting that their review was delayed because in the opening week of the exhibition, [...] "the crowds which continually stood in front of it rendered it quite impossible to get such a <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> as would enable us to do it justice". Colburn's New Monthly Magazine considered it [...] "another instance of the rapid advances which this rising artist is making towards perfection." [...] The most effusive praise was offered in poetic form by [...] John Taylor, who in September 1828 imagined that if Milton and Nicolas Poussin were both alive to see the painting, Milton would view it with [...] "proud delight", while Poussin would suffer an [...] "envious thorn" [...] with the realization that Etty's abilities had surpassed his own.|$|E
500|$|The {{rest of the}} {{division}} made several efforts to reinforce Frost's men, but were unable {{to break through the}} German forces that surrounded the bridge. [...] The exact disposition of the British troops subsequently became more confused as the battle developed into house to house fighting. Tatham-Warter took command of 2nd Battalion on Tuesday 19, and Grayburn temporarily took command of A Company after Tatham-Warter's designated replacement was wounded. Grayburn led several fighting patrols that forced the Germans to commit more armour but as Wednesday 20 dawned, the British position was becoming untenable. As the Germans squeezed the perimeter they laid explosives on a section of the ramp crossing a road next to the riverbank, lest XXX Corps should break through and capture the bridge from the south. Grayburn led another patrol that forced the enemy away from the arch while Royal Engineers removed the fuzes. Grayburn was wounded again but quickly returned after being treated, now with his head bandaged and arm in a sling. German infantry later returned to relay the charges and a second patrol went out to remove them. A German tank had come forward to cover the arch, but in order to direct his men to better positions Grayburn stood up in full <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>it.</b> The tank's machine gun killed him instantly.|$|E

500|$|Churches of Christ {{consistently}} {{teach that}} in baptism a believer surrenders {{his life in}} faith and obedience to God, and that God [...] "by the merits of Christ's blood, cleanses one from sin and truly changes {{the state of the}} person from an alien to a citizen of God's kingdom. Baptism is not a human work; it is the place where God does the work that only God can do." [...] Baptism is a passive act of faith rather than a meritorious work; it [...] "is a confession that a person has nothing to offer God". While Churches of Christ do not describe baptism as a [...] "sacrament", their <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> can legitimately be described as [...] "sacramental". They see the power of baptism coming from God, who chose to use baptism as a vehicle, rather than from the water or the act itself, and understand baptism to {{be an integral part of}} the conversion process, rather than as only a symbol of conversion. A recent trend is to emphasize the transformational aspect of baptism: instead of describing it as nothing more than a legal requirement or sign of something that happened in the past, it is seen as [...] "the event that places the believer 'into Christ' where God does the ongoing work of transformation". There is a minority that downplays the importance of baptism in order to avoid sectarianism, but the broader trend is to [...] "reexamine the richness of the Biblical teaching of baptism and to reinforce its central and essential place in Christianity".|$|E

The Jacobite Army was a national force; many of its most effective units were Lowlanders, versus the traditional <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> as essentially one of Gaelic Highlanders.

2500|$|Christian Science {{teaches that}} prayer is a spiritualization of thought or an {{understanding}} of God and {{of the nature of}} the underlying spiritual creation. Adherents believe that this can result in healing, by bringing spiritual reality (the [...] "Kingdom of Heaven" [...] in Biblical terms) into clearer focus in the human scene. The world as it appears to the senses is regarded as a distorted version of the world of spiritual ideas. Prayer can heal the distortion. Christian Scientists believe that prayer does not change the spiritual creation but gives a clearer <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>it,</b> and the result appears in the human scene as healing: the human picture adjusts to coincide more nearly with the divine reality. Christian Scientists do not practice intercessory prayer as it is commonly understood, and they generally avoid combining prayer with medical treatment in the belief that the two practices tend to work against each other. (However, the choice of healing method is regarded as a matter for the individual, and the Christian Science Church exerts no pressure on members to avoid medical treatment if they wish to avail of it as an alternative to Christian Science healing.) Prayer works through love: the recognition of God's creation as spiritual, intact, and inherently lovable.|$|E
2500|$|Windows Vista and its successors added {{minor changes}} to the menu. Prior to Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, the Start menu {{consisted}} of a group of menus and sub-menus that cascaded and expanded, obscuring the initially visible portions of the screen beneath them. In Windows Vista, however, cascading menus were replaced by a sliding window in the left pane of the Start menu. Whenever All Programs item is clicked, the contents of the left pane slide off the left edge of the Start menu and the All Programs menu slides in from the right edge of the left column. This menu presents a tree <b>view</b> <b>of</b> <b>it</b> hierarchy that expands towards the bottom, with a vertical scrollbar whenever needed. Also added in Windows Vista is a Search box that allows users to search for the Start menu shortcuts or other files and folders. The search box features incremental search: If indexing is not turned off, the search box returns results on-the-fly as users type into it. Since the found items can be immediately opened, the Start menu search box replaces the function of Run command from previous versions of Windows. The Run command can also be added separately to the right column in the Start menu. In Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2, the search results pane covers both columns of the Start menu. The search box is extended to support searching Control Panel items. The right column in Windows 7 links to Libraries instead of ordinary folders. Most importantly, however, items on the Start menu support Jump lists through cascade buttons on their right. Unlike prior versions, the ability to revert to the [...] "Classic" [...] Start menu design is no longer available.|$|E
