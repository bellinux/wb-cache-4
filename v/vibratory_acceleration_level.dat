40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the International Space Station (ISS) {{is to provide a}} long-term quiescent environment for the conduct of scientific research for a variety of microgravity science disciplines. This paper reports to the microgravity scientific community the results of an initial characterization of the microgravity environment on the International Space Station for increments 2 through 4. During that period almost 70, 000 hours of station operations and scientific experiments were conducted. 720 hours of crew research time were logged aboard the orbiting laboratory and over half a terabyte of acceleration data were recorded and much of that was analyzed. The results discussed in this paper cover both the quasi-steady and <b>vibratory</b> <b>acceleration</b> environment of the station during its first year of scientific operation. For the quasi-steady environment, results are presented and discussed for the following: the space station attitudes Torque Equilibrium Attitude and the X-Axis Perpendicular to the Orbital Plane; station docking attitude maneuvers; Space Shuttle joint operation with the station; cabin de-pressurizations and the station water dumps. For the vibratory environment, results are presented for the following: crew exercise, docking events, and the activation/de-activation of both station life support system hardware and experiment hardware. Finally, a grand summary of all the data collected aboard the station during the 1 -year period is presented showing where the overall quasi-steady and <b>vibratory</b> <b>acceleration</b> magnitude <b>levels</b> fall over that period of time using a 95 th percentile benchmark.

Some specific quasi-steady and vibratory microgravity environment characterization analyses were performed for the following payloads: Structure of Flame Balls at Low Lewis-number- 2, Laminar Soot Processes- 2, Mechanics of Granular Materials- 3 and Water Mist Fire-Suppression Experiment. The Physical Science Division of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration sponsors the Orbital Acceleration Research Experiment and the Space Acceleration Measurement System for Free Flyer to support microgravity science experiments, which require microgravity acceleration measurements.

The Columbia reduced gravity environment analysis presented in this report uses acceleration data collected by these two sets of accelerometer systems: The Orbital Acceleration Research Experiment is a low frequency sensor, which measures acceleration up to 1 Hz, but the 1 Hz acceleration data is trimmean filtered to yield much lower frequency acceleration data up to 0. 01 Hz.

40|$|Experiments {{are sent}} to space {{laboratories}} {{in order to take}} advantage of the low-gravity environment. However, it is crucial to appreciate the distinction between the real microgravity environment and "weightlessness" or "simulated microgravity". The microgravity in space laboratories may be of much smaller magnitude than the gravitational acceleration on earth. However, it is not zero, nor even one microg (defined as 1 e- 6 earth gravity). Moreover, the orientation is not uniaxial, as on earth. The net acceleration that acts on a space experiment arises from, e. g., orbital mechanics, atmospheric drag, and thruster firings, and it can act on the experiments in gravity-like ways. In essence, a well-defined, stable 1 g acceleration on the earth's surface is substituted for a complex array of dynamically changing accelerations with ever-changing frequency content, magnitude and direction.

Current accelerometer designs offer very limited redundancy and high noise output. Furthermore they have latency in detection and are known to fail under lower than designed loads. ^ The focus of this study is on the threshold detection of such events using arrays of single crystal silicon micro g-switches. These switches respond to different <b>acceleration</b> <b>levels</b> by making solid-to-solid contacts at a discrete <b>acceleration</b> <b>level.</b> This has the potential to offer high redundancy and promises an adequate confidence level in the measured data. The g-switches in this study are designed for two categories, high-g switches for <b>acceleration</b> <b>levels</b> up to 40, 000 g and low-g switches (in the order of 100 g) both surviving impact conditions. The high-g switches were tested using a modified Hopkinson bar setup and successfully demonstrated up to 45, 000 g. Experimental and modeling results are used to examine the dynamic behavior of the switches. The modeling results found to be in close agreement with the experiment results with deviations below 9 μs (3 ̆c 20...|$|R

In this paper we extend the CLIK algorithm to the <b>acceleration</b> <b>level</b> {{to meet some}} applications that require the joint accelerations. The redundancy resolutions at the velocities and <b>acceleration</b> <b>levels</b> via pseudoinverse method are analyzed respectively. The objective function of joint limits avoidance (JLA) is combined into the redundancy resolution as an optimization approach of the null space motion.

A measurement {{campaign has been}} carried out to individuate vibration <b>acceleration</b> <b>levels</b> for different typologies of vehicles. Each vehicle passage has been considered as a single event. Vibration levels due to each single event have been measured by means of a data acquisition system. Measurement results allowed to individuate the relations among vibration levels, typology of vehicle, vehicle velocity and soil characteristics. Thus, <b>acceleration</b> <b>levels</b> may be estimated at different distances from the vibration source by adopting a propagation model which has been previously proposed for train induced soil vibrations [1]. 1...|$|R
