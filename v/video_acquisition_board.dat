40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{some aspects}} related to test process of an advanced video system used in remote IP surveillance. The system {{is based on}} a Pentium compatible architecture using the industrial standard PC 104 +. First the overall architecture of the system is presented, involving both hardware or software aspects. The acquisition board which is developed in a special, nonstandard architecture, is also briefly presented. The main purpose of this research was to set a coherent set of procedures in order to test all the aspects of the <b>video</b> <b>acquisition</b> <b>board.</b> To accomplish this, it was necessary to set-up a procedure in two steps: stand alone video board test (functional test) and an in-system test procedure verifying the compatibility with both OS: Linux and Windows. The paper presents also the results obtained using this procedure. Comment: 5 pages, 17 figure...|$|E
40|$|Several {{methods have}} been {{described}} to measure intraocular pressure (IOP) in clinical and research situations. However, the measurement of time varying IOP with high accuracy, mainly in situations that alter corneal properties, has not been reported until now. The present report describes a computerized system capable of recording the transitory variability of IOP, which is sufficiently sensitive to reliably measure ocular pulse peak-to-peak values. We also describe its characteristics and discuss its applicability to research and clinical studies. The device consists of a pressure transducer, a signal conditioning unit and an analog-to-digital converter coupled to a <b>video</b> <b>acquisition</b> <b>board.</b> A modified Cairns trabeculectomy was performed in 9 Oryctolagus cuniculus rabbits to obtain changes in IOP decay parameters and to evaluate the utility and sensitivity of the recording system. The device was effective {{for the study of}} kinetic parameters of IOP, such as decay pattern and ocular pulse waves due to cardiac and respiratory cycle rhythm. In addition, there was a significant increase of IOP versus time curve derivative when pre- and post-trabeculectomy recordings were compared. The present procedure excludes corneal thickness and error related to individual operator ability. Clinical complications due to saline infusion and pressure overload were not observed during biomicroscopic evaluation. Among the disadvantages of the procedure are the requirement of anesthesia and the use in acute recordings rather than chronic protocols. Finally, the method described may provide a reliable alternative for the study of ocular pressure dynamic alterations in man and may facilitate the investigation of the pathogenesis of glaucoma...|$|E

The set up includes a physical system (an inverted pendulum) as well as a local server fitted with a <b>video</b> camera, data <b>acquisition</b> <b>boards,</b> and network connectivity that permits interactions with remotely located clients. The paper discusses relevant issues of the design, and presents a paradigm for operation based on a client-server configuration and a standard/master-client mode of service. The information streams involved in the process are classified in four groups of different transmission priorities, namely, a parameter stream, a data stream, an administrative stream, and an audio/video stream. The paper analyzes the performance and requirements of the {{system based on}} the results of transatlantic tests. The results of the analysis show that real-time remote-control experimentation over the Internet is in fact a new kind of network application featuring its own requirements that are different from those of related technologies used for video-conferencing/broadcasting. In order to overcome the current lack of predictability of the Internet, the final section of the paper suggests improvements such as adapting the priority of the different streams to the Internet bandwidth and to the user’s needs. 1...|$|R

40|$|Unfortunately, {{measuring}} {{analog signals}} with a data <b>acquisition</b> <b>board</b> {{is not always}} as simple as wiring the signal source leads to the data <b>acquisition</b> <b>board.</b> Knowledge {{of the nature of}} the signal source, a suitable configuration of the data <b>acquisition</b> <b>board,</b> and an appropriate cabling scheme may be required to produce accurate and noise-free measurements. Figure 1 shows a block diagram of a typical data acquisition system. The integrity of the acquired data depends upon the entire analog signal path. Figure 1. Block Diagram of a Typical Data Acquisition System In order to cover a wide variety of applications, most data <b>acquisition</b> <b>boards</b> provide some flexibility in their analog input stage configuration. The price of this flexibility is, however, some confusion as to the proper applications of the various input configurations and their relative merits. The purpose of this note is to help clarify the types of input configurations available on data <b>acquisition</b> <b>boards,</b> to explain how the user should choose and use the configuration best for the application, and to discuss interference noise pick up mechanisms and how to minimize interference noise by proper cabling and shielding. An understanding of the types of signal sources and measurement systems is a prerequisite to application of good measurement techniques, so we will begin by discussing the same. Types of Signal Sources and Measurement Systems By far the most common electrical equivalent produced by signal conditioning circuitry associated with transducers is in the form of voltage. Transformation to other electrical phenomena such as current and frequency may be encountered in cases where the signal is to be carried over long cabling in harsh environments. Since in virtually all cases the transformed signal is ultimately converted back into a voltage signal before measurement, it is important to understand the voltage signal source.

The <b>acquisition</b> <b>board</b> is based on low cost 8 bit analogue to digital converters.

Hall-effect transducers are used for the current channels and fast differential amplifiers for the voltage channels. Both Aron and complete three-phase system configurations are available.

40|$|Thesis supervisor: Dr. Harry W. Tyrer. [ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Our {{laboratory}} {{has designed}} data acquisition systems to detect personnel activity using floor-based sensors, {{which we call}} the smart carpet. Therefore, we use a signal-scavenging technique, where the carpet sensor has two states: active or non active. Active state can occur when someone steps on a sensor otherwise it is non active. To improve the wireless communication between data <b>acquisition</b> <b>boards,</b> we implemented a Wi-Fi connectivity. We used two Wi-Fi boards, the Murata SN 8200 and the Spark Core. The Murata SN 8200 receives the sensors data from the data <b>acquisition</b> <b>board</b> and wirelessly displays it on an embedded webpage, unfortunately it was limited. The second board we used, the Spark Core board, sends the sensor data from the data <b>acquisition</b> <b>board</b> to the Internet then to the cloud. We developed carpet pads with four sensors {{as a source of}} the sensors data to the data <b>acquisition</b> <b>board.</b> We saved the sensor data with the timestamp on a local PC by using the Node JS code. Next, we sent TCP request to Google, received the request, and displayed it on the TCP Client using the command line interface. We also implemented a TCP Client/Server environment to exchange the sensor data between two Spark Core boards. Moreover, we tested the ability of powering the Spark Core from a 9 Volts battery. Later, we embedded the Spark Core with the data <b>acquisition</b> <b>board</b> in a one PCB board. In addition, we did an experiment to test our system. We activated the carpet pads by walking, used four carpet pads with four PCB boards, and placed them in four different locations. An HTML page displayed the sensor data from the four PCB boards.

This suggested the de nition of a new software interface, simpler to use than the previously existing OSS (Voxware) driver. The driver is backward compatible with the OSS API due to the large base of applications that use this API.
