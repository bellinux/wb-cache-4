25|$|Another {{major change}} to the Start menu in Windows Vista is {{that it no longer}} {{presents}} the All programs menu as a horizontally expanding cascading list which utilizes the entire screen space, but instead as a nested folder view with a fixed size. The list of submenus and single items appears over the left column contents with a Back button below it. Subfolders expand and collapse vertically within the list when single-clicked, in a tree-like fashion similar to Windows Explorer. Single items appear at the top and folders appear at the bottom. Hovering the mouse over a folder does not open it; the folder needs to be clicked. A limitation of the new Start menu is that subfolders inside the All Programs menu cannot be opened simply by searching or double clicking. Also, as more programs are installed, a <b>vertical</b> <b>scroll</b> <b>bar</b> appears between the two columns. A dynamically changing icon showing the user's display picture by default is present {{at the top of the}} right column. It changes as users hover over any other item to reflect that item's icon. The Power button's action is configurable through Power options in the Control Panel, though the default setting is to put the computer into Sleep mode. Users can quickly lock their user account by pressing the Lock button. Additional power and account related actions are listed in a sub-menu which appears when the small arrow next to the Lock button is clicked.|$|E

The relocation of the <b>vertical</b> <b>scroll</b> <b>bar</b> served as an alternative to the relocation of the prominent left aligned main navigation menu for most websites. Fifteen participants were recruited for the study. Each participant interacted with two versions of a web site in a modified browser to complete a set of ten short tasks. Participants completed tasks by interacting with a traditional and non-traditional vertical browser alignment. Left and right-handed participants were determined to be strikingly different in operation. Vertical scroll relocation produced some interesting results and responses...|$|E

In practice, most list boxes use right-oriented <b>scroll</b> <b>bars</b> to control left-justified text items. A two way interaction hypothesis favoring {{the use of a}} <b>scroll</b> <b>bar</b> orientation consistent with list box item justification was obtained for speed of use and user preference. Item selection was faster with a <b>scroll</b> <b>bar</b> orientation consistent with list item justification.

40|$|Even though <b>scroll</b> <b>bars</b> {{are often}} {{observed}} in meandering rivers, {{it is still}} not evident what exactly causes their formation. According to several studies on natural rivers, <b>scroll</b> <b>bars</b> only form when there are discharge variations and therefore pulses of outer bank erosion. Otherwise a flat point bar would develop as a continuous process. However, numerous flume experiments have reported on <b>scroll</b> <b>bar</b> formation while discharge is constant. Also, there are observations in natural rivers that sedimentation on the inner bank causes outer bank erosion. The objective of this research is to determine if erosion of the outer bank or variation in sediment supply is the leading process for the development of <b>scroll</b> <b>bars.</b> In order to study the development of <b>scroll</b> <b>bars</b> while controlling the boundary conditions, an experimental meandering river was created in a 3 x 11 m flume. Eight cases were performed in developed bends, which included the addition of sediment pulses and removal of part of the outer bend. Sediment pulses were added in order to determine if variations in sediment supply from upstream causes individual <b>scroll</b> <b>bars</b> to form and whether inner bend accretion is the dominant process in bend migration. This was done in an already migrating bend and in a bend that did not migrate before the perturbation. Part of the outer bend was removed several times in order to determine if outer bend erosion is the dominant process leading to <b>scroll</b> <b>bar</b> formation and bend migration. This corresponds to discontinuous outer bank erosion in nature. Also, in one bend the outer bank was fixated, in order to see if <b>scroll</b> <b>bars</b> would still develop if there is no erosion of the outer bend. In nature this corresponds to a meander bend with a high bank strength. In all cases the accretion of the inner bend and the erosion of the outer bend were monitored and flow velocities were measured. <b>Scroll</b> <b>bars</b> were observed in all bends that migrated and were formed by multiple bedforms that were deposited by secondary currents. Channel width increased downstream of the apex of these bends, causing flow velocities to decrease. Therefore, <b>scroll</b> <b>bars</b> were formed at the downstream end of a bend. Forced sediment pulses did not cause individual <b>scroll</b> <b>bars</b> to develop and had no significant effect on flow velocities and outer bend erosion. In the bend that was fixated, eventually no sediment was deposited on the point bar anymore and therefore also no <b>scroll</b> <b>bars</b> formed. However, each removal of part of the outer bend caused flow velocities to decrease at the inner bend due to the increase in width, which caused a <b>scroll</b> <b>bar</b> to develop. Erosion of the outer bend is thus the leading process in <b>scroll</b> <b>bar</b> formation and channel width variations are essential to explain sediment deposition and meander bend migration. Further research can be done on <b>scroll</b> <b>bars</b> in relatively sharp bends where flow separation zones are present. Also, in several natural rivers relatively wide <b>scroll</b> <b>bars</b> are observed, which differ with the <b>scroll</b> <b>bars</b> in the experiment...|$|R
