25|$|The organs mainly {{involved}} in heme synthesis are the liver (in which {{the rate of}} synthesis is highly variable, depending on the systemic heme pool) and the bone marrow (in which rate of synthesis of Heme is relatively constant and depends on the production of globin chain), although every cell requires heme to function properly. However, due to its toxic properties, proteins such as Hemopexin (Hx) are required to help maintain physiological stores of iron {{in order for them}} to be used in synthesis. Heme is seen as an intermediate molecule in catabolism of hemoglobin in the process of bilirubin metabolism. Defects in various enzymes in synthesis of heme can lead to group of disorder called porphyrias, these include acute intermittent porphyria, congenital erythropoetic porphyria, porphyria cutanea tarda, hereditary coproporphyria, <b>variegate</b> <b>porphyria,</b> erythropoietic protoporphyria.|$|E
25|$|The acute porphyrias are acute {{intermittent}} porphyria (AIP), <b>variegate</b> <b>porphyria</b> (VP), amino {{levulinic acid}} dehydratase deficiency (ALAD) and hereditary coproporphyria (HCP). These diseases primarily affect the nervous system, resulting in episodic crises known as acute attacks. The major symptom of an acute attack is abdominal pain, often accompanied by vomiting, hypertension (elevated blood pressure), and tachycardia (an abnormally rapid heart rate). The most severe episodes may involve neurological complications: typically motor neuropathy (severe dysfunction of the peripheral nerves that innervate muscle), which leads to muscle weakness and potentially to quadriplegia (paralysis of all four limbs) and central nervous system symptoms such as seizures and coma. Occasionally, there may be short-lived psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety, confusion, hallucinations, and, very rarely, overt psychosis. All these symptoms resolve once the acute attack passes. Porphyria is not a cause of chronic psychiatric illness, though an association with anxiety and depression has been suggested.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly before {{transferring}} to Tokyo in August 1968, Prince William was examined by a Royal Air Force doctor, Henry Bellringer, {{at the request}} of the prince's mother. William told the doctor that he had suffered from fever and cutaneous hepatic symptoms, beginning in December 1965 and lasting several months. He had subsequently noticed that his skin was prone to a blistering rash, particularly on exposure to sunshine. Bellringer tentatively diagnosed porphyria, prescribed sunblock cream and gave him a medical warning card regarding the need to avoid certain medications. Although he was aware of the theory of the royal family's history of porphyria then being proposed by Professor Ida Macalpine and Dr Richard Hunter, he stated he [...] "tried not to let it influence him...with all the symptoms, I was left with little option but to diagnose the Prince's condition as porphyria." [...] William was later examined by haematologists at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge and also by a Professor Ishihara in Tokyo, both of whom also concluded he was suffering from <b>variegate</b> <b>porphyria,</b> by then in remission.|$|E

50|$|<b>Variegate</b> <b>porphyria</b> {{is caused}} by {{mutations}} in the PPOX gene. More than 100 mutations that can cause <b>variegate</b> <b>porphyria</b> {{have been identified in}} the PPOX gene. One mutation, a substitution of the amino acid tryptophan for arginine at position 59 (also written as Arg59Trp or R59W), is found in about 95 percent of South African families with <b>variegate</b> <b>porphyria.</b> Mutations in the PPOX gene reduce the activity of the enzyme made by the gene, allowing byproducts of heme production to build up in the body. This buildup, in combination with nongenetic factors (such as certain drugs, alcohol and dieting), causes this type of porphyria.|$|E
50|$|<b>Variegate</b> <b>porphyria</b> is {{also known}} as mixed hepatic porphyria, mixed porphyria, South African genetic porphyria, and South African porphyria.|$|E
50|$|In South Africa, the {{prevalence}} of <b>variegate</b> <b>porphyria</b> is approximately 1 in 300. In Finland, {{the prevalence}} is approximately 1 in 75.000.|$|E
50|$|Photosensitivity is {{also found}} in some of the Porphyrias. Nearly all cases of Porphyria cutanea tarda exhibit blister {{formation}} on the skin within 2-4 days of light exposure. <b>Variegate</b> <b>porphyria</b> and Hereditary coproporphyria can also exhibit symptoms of light induced blisters.|$|E
50|$|Some {{people with}} <b>variegate</b> <b>porphyria</b> have skin that is overly {{sensitive}} to sunlight (photosensitive). Areas of skin {{exposed to the}} sun develop severe blistering, scarring, changes in pigmentation, and increased hair growth. Exposed skin becomes fragile and is easily damaged.|$|E
50|$|Mutations in the PPOX gene cause <b>variegate</b> <b>porphyria.</b> The PPOX gene makes a {{membrane}} bound mitochondrial enzyme called protoporphyrinogen oxidase, {{which is}} critical to the chemical process that leads to heme production. The activity of this enzyme is reduced by 50 percent in most people with <b>variegate</b> <b>porphyria.</b> In severe cases that begin early in life, the enzyme is almost completely inactive. Nongenetic factors such as certain drugs, stress, and others listed above can increase the demand for heme and the enzymes required to make heme. The combination of this increased demand and reduced activity of protoporphyrinogen oxidase disrupts heme production and allows byproducts of the process to accumulate in the liver, triggering an acute attack.|$|E

50|$|<b>Variegate</b> <b>porphyria</b> is {{inherited}} in an {{autosomal dominant}} pattern, {{which means the}} defective gene is located on an autosome, and inheriting one copy of the defective gene from an affected parent is sufficient to cause the disorder. More severe cases result from inheriting two copies of the defective gene.|$|E
50|$|Rarely, {{the signs}} and {{symptoms}} of <b>variegate</b> <b>porphyria</b> can begin in infancy or early childhood.

50|$|<b>Variegate</b> <b>porphyria,</b> {{also known}} by several other names, is an {{autosomal}} dominant porphyria {{that can have}} acute (severe but usually not long-lasting) symptoms along with symptoms that affect the skin.

50|$|Mechanisms {{other than}} allergen-antibody {{interactions}} {{are known to}} cause histamine release from mast cells. Many drugs, for example morphine, can induce direct histamine release not involving any immunoglobulin molecule.

Dominantly inherited cutaneous and neurocutaneous porphyrias (porphyria cutanea tarda, hereditary coproporphyria, <b>variegate</b> <b>porphyria</b> and erythropoietic protoporphyria) have been associated with solar urticaria. The occurrence of drug-induced solar urticaria may be associated with porphyrias. This may be caused by IgG binding, not IgE.|$|E
50|$|Acute {{and chronic}} hepatic porphyrias (acute {{intermittent}} porphyria, porphyria cutanea tarda, hereditary coproporphyria, <b>variegate</b> <b>porphyria)</b> and tyrosinemia type I are {{risk factors for}} hepatocellular carcinoma. The diagnosis of an acute hepatic porphyria (AIP, HCP, VP) should be sought in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma without typical risk factors of hepatitis B or C, alcoholic liver cirrhosis or hemochromatosis. Both active and latent genetic carriers of acute hepatic porphyriasare at risk for this cancer, although latent genetic carriers have developed the cancer at a later age than those with classic symptoms. Patients with acute hepatic porphyrias should be monitored for hepatocellular carcinoma.|$|E
50|$|In 1988, an American {{woman who}} had married a Shark Bay Aboriginal man {{contacted}} Dr Playford and described how her husband had died some years before from a disease called <b>variegate</b> <b>porphyria.</b> Playford found that the disease was genetically linked and largely confined to Afrikaners and that all cases of the disease in South Africa were traceable back to Gerrit Jansz and Ariaantjie Jacobs, who had married in The Cape in 1688. The Zuytdorp {{had arrived at the}} Cape in March 1712 where it took on more than 100 new crew. It was thought that one of the Jansz' sons could have boarded the ship at this time and thus become the carrier of the disease into the Australian Aboriginal population. In 2002, a DNA investigation into the hypothesis of a <b>variegate</b> <b>porphyria</b> mutation having been introduced into the aboriginal population by shipwrecked sailors was undertaken at the Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre in Nedlands, Western Australia and the Stellenbosch University in South Africa. The conclusion was that the mutations were not inherited from shipwrecked sailors. The SS Xantho and other late 19th century vessels brought hundreds of pearl divers to Western Australia from the islands occupied by the Dutch East India Company, where diseases (including genetic diseases) were introduced by the Dutch to the local population. Many of those pearl divers are known to have intermarried with Aboriginal people, so it is equally likely that any genetic links between Australian Aborigines and the Dutch can be traced to those sources and not to the Zuytdorp, despite the ship pictured on Walga Rock.|$|E

Later, Landon ends up in the hospital with the same symptoms. After learning that Landon was put into the camp for a relatively minor offense, further research reveals that Driscoll is Landon's father. It appears they have a genetic disease, and House eventually concludes it's <b>variegate</b> <b>porphyria.</b>|$|E
