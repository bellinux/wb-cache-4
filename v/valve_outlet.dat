5|$|This river {{valve system}} {{was one of}} the first parts of the dam to be built when the dam project started in 1961, because its initial purpose was to divert the river while the dam was under construction. After that, it served various purposes, {{including}} as a possible emergency release valve. Since the accident, DWR had implemented a standing order that prohibited the operation of the river outlet system and significantly limited access to the river valve chamber. Following the accident, DWR entered into a 2012 Agreement with CalOSHA to hire a third party expert to improve the safety of the River <b>Valve</b> <b>Outlet</b> System (RVOS) and make it operational again. In 2014, DWR embarked on an accelerated refurbishment program to respond to concerns about operational needs during the ongoing drought. The system was mostly refurbished and was used during 2014 and 2015 to meet Endangered Species Act temperature requirements for the Feather River. Some additional refurbishments were being made to portions of the RVOS and were expected to conclude in early 2017.|$|E
40|$|The present {{invention}} is a sorbent-based atmosphere revitalization (SBAR) system using treatment beds each {{having a}} bed housing, {{primary and secondary}} moisture adsorbent layers, and a primary carbon dioxide adsorbent layer. Each bed includes a redirecting plenum between moisture adsorbent layers, inlet and outlet ports connected to inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>valves,</b> respectively, and bypass ports connected to the redirecting plenums. The SBAR system also includes at least one bypass valve connected to the bypass ports. An inlet channel connects inlet valves to an atmosphere source. An outlet channel connects the bypass <b>valve</b> and <b>outlet</b> <b>valves</b> to the atmosphere source. A vacuum channel connects inlet valves, the bypass <b>valve</b> and <b>outlet</b> <b>valves</b> to a vacuum source. In use, one bed treats air from the atmosphere source while another bed undergoes regeneration. During regeneration, the inlet, bypass, and <b>outlet</b> <b>valves</b> sequentially open to the vacuum source, removing accumulated moisture and carbon dioxide...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} prevent the {{backward}} flow of piezoelectric pumps, this paper presents a single-active-chamber piezoelectric membrane pump with multiple passive check valves. Under the condition of a fixed total number of passive check valves, by means of changing the inlet <b>valves</b> and <b>outlet</b> valves’ configuration, the pumping characteristics in terms of flow rate and backpressure are experimentally investigated. Like the maximum flow rate and backpressure, the testing {{results show that the}} optimal frequencies are significantly affected by changes in the number inlet <b>valves</b> and <b>outlet</b> <b>valves.</b> The variation ratios of the maximum flow rate and the maximum backpressure are up to 66 % and less than 20 %, respectively. Furthermore, the piezoelectric pump generally demonstrates very similar flow rate and backpressure characteristics when the number of inlet valves in one kind of configuration is {{the same as that of}} <b>outlet</b> <b>valves</b> in another configuration. The comparison indicates that the backflow from the pumping chamber to inlet is basically the same as the backflow from the outlet to the pumping chamber. No matter whether the number of inlet valves or the number of <b>outlet</b> <b>valves</b> is increased, the backflow can be effectively reduced. In addition, the backpressure fluctuation can be significantly suppressed with an increase of either inlet <b>valves</b> or <b>outlet</b> <b>valves.</b> It also means that the pump can prevent the backflow more effectively at the cost of power consumption. The pump is very suitable for conditions where more accurate flow rates are needed and wear and fatigue of check valves often occur...|$|R

40|$|AbstractHigh Thrust Cryogenic Rocket Stages entail {{the use of}} a Vent and Relief Valve {{which can}} cater to a higher {{discharge}} rate. The Vent function is called for during ground servicing operations like tank chilling and pressurant replenishment and during flight {{to take care of the}} decrease in ambient pressure and boil-off losses. The Relief function acts as a redundant feature to protect the tanks from catastrophic failure due to structural damage caused by over-pressurization. Nevertheless, this valve needs to be characterized for both these functions during ground tests. This paper describes the modelling of and experimentation on an Inverted Type Pilot Operated Vent and Safety Valve. A mathematical model for simulating the dynamic behavior of this tank-mounted valve is developed. For this, a set of non-linear, first order, coupled ordinary differential equations, based on laws of conservation of mass and energy, are derived using fixed control volume approach. The numerical solution of these equations is obtained using fourth order Runge-Kutta method. The pressure, temperature, flow rate, seat stress and lift thus obtained are plotted to find the characteristic parameters such as cracking pressure, full flow pressure, reseal pressure, opening and closing response, tank pressure decay rate and full flow rate. The valve performance is studied for the effect of main <b>valve</b> <b>outlet</b> orifice and the pilot <b>valve</b> <b>outlet</b> orifice using these simulations. These results are validated by comparing it to the test results...|$|E

40|$|A multi-mesh {{numerical}} valve {{model has}} been developed to analyze the opening characteristic of highpressure safety valves. Newton’s law and the CFD result for the flow force are used to model {{the movement of the}} valve. In incompressible transient flow simulations a large force rise and collapse is caused by a redirection of the bulk flow. This flow-history effect cannot be incorporated in a quasi-steady approach. For real-gases at a set pressure of 40 bar oscillations have been observed during closing of the valve. They are caused by the interaction between the flow in the cavity of the valve disk and the flow towards the <b>valve</b> <b>outlet.</b> At a higher set pressure the flow force continually decreases, which indicates that only a sufficiently fast inlet pressure rise forces the valve to open. With this tool the operation characteristics of safety valves can be assessed to optimize the valve design...|$|E
