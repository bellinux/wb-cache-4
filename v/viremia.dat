5|$|In fatal {{cases of}} {{ordinary}} smallpox, death usually occurs between the tenth and sixteenth {{days of the}} illness. The cause of death from smallpox is not clear, but the infection is now known to involve multiple organs. Circulating immune complexes, overwhelming <b>viremia,</b> or an uncontrolled immune response may be contributing factors. In early hemorrhagic smallpox, death occurs suddenly about six days after the fever develops. Cause of death in hemorrhagic cases involved heart failure, sometimes accompanied by pulmonary edema. In late hemorrhagic cases, high and sustained <b>viremia,</b> severe platelet loss and poor immune response were often cited as causes of death. In flat smallpox modes of death {{are similar to those}} in burns, with loss of fluid, protein and electrolytes beyond the capacity of the body to replace or acquire, and fulminating sepsis.|$|E
5|$|Known as <b>viremia,</b> the {{presence}} of a virus in the bloodstream enables it to be widely distributed throughout the body. Poliovirus can survive and multiply within the blood and lymphatics for long periods of time, sometimes as long as 17 weeks. In a small percentage of cases, it can spread and replicate in other sites, such as brown fat, the reticuloendothelial tissues, and muscle. This sustained replication causes a major <b>viremia,</b> and leads to the development of minor influenza-like symptoms. Rarely, this may progress and the virus may invade the central nervous system, provoking a local inflammatory response. In most cases, this causes a self-limiting inflammation of the meninges, the layers of tissue surrounding the brain, which is known as nonparalytic aseptic meningitis. Penetration of the CNS provides no known benefit to the virus, and is quite possibly an incidental deviation of a normal gastrointestinal infection. The mechanisms by which poliovirus spreads to the CNS are poorly understood, but it appears to be primarily a chance event—largely independent of the age, gender, or socioeconomic position of the individual.|$|E
5|$|The Salk vaccine, or inactivated {{poliovirus}} vaccine (IPV), {{is based}} on three wild, virulent reference strains, Mahoney (type 1 poliovirus), MEF-1 (type 2 poliovirus), and Saukett (type 3 poliovirus), grown in a type of monkey kidney tissue culture (Vero cell line), which are then inactivated with formalin. The injected Salk vaccine confers IgG-mediated immunity in the bloodstream, which prevents polio infection from progressing to <b>viremia</b> and protects the motor neurons, thus eliminating the risk of bulbar polio and post-polio syndrome.|$|E

No differences occurred in infection rates of Ae. vexans and Culex pipiens (L.) fed on the same WNV viremic chicken.

Dissemination rates were similar in Ae. vexans 14 and 21 days post blood feeding (PBF). Likewise, transmission rates were similar in Ae. vexans 14 days and 21 days PBF. This indicated that, under laboratory conditions, Ae. vexans is a competent vector of WNV...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Eastern gray {{squirrels}} (Sciurus carolinensis) {{have shown}} high West Nile virus (WNV) seroprevalence, and WNV infection {{has been suggested}} {{as a cause of}} morbidity and mortality in this species. We experimentally infected nine eastern gray squirrels with WNV to determine the clinical effects of infection and to assess their potential role as amplifying hosts. We observed no morbidity or mortality attributable to WNV infection, but lesions were apparent in several organs. We detected mean <b>viremias</b> of 105. 1 and 104. 8 plaque-forming units (PFU) /mL on days 3 and 4 post-infection (DPI) and estimated that ∼ 2. 1 % of Culex pipiens feeding on squirrels during 1 – 5 DPI would become infectious. Thus, S. carolinensis are unlikely to be important amplifying hosts and may instead dampen the intensity of transmission in most host communities. The low <b>viremias</b> and lack of mortality observed in S. carolinensis suggest that they may be useful as sentinels of spillover from the enzootic amplification cycle...|$|R
40|$|Background: Storage and {{shipment}} {{conditions of}} clinical specimens affect {{the quality of}} nucleic acids and may interfere with molecular analysis. The aim of our study was to verify whether blood storage at room temperature affects single nucleotide polymorphisms analysis; moreover, we analysed the consequences of serum storage at 4 °C on viral load determination of hepatitis B and C viruses. Methods: For single nucleotide polymorphism screening, genomic DNA was extracted from EDTA whole blood samples stored at room temperature for different times, quantified photometrically, and Factor V Leiden point mutation analysis was performed. For viral load determination, serum samples with medium or low <b>viremias</b> were stored at + 4 °C for different times and analysed by Cobas AmpliPrep/Cobas TaqMan tests for hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA or hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA. Results: While mutation analysis was successfully performed on all samples tested, serum storage at + 4 °C of HBV- and HCV-infected sera decreased viral load, in particular for low <b>viremias.</b> Conclusions: Storage of blood samples at room temperature up to 1 month does not affect the feasibility of genetic analysis, while serum storage at + 4 °C affects viral load...|$|R
5|$|The {{incubation}} period between contraction {{and the first}} obvious symptoms of the disease is around 12 days. Once inhaled, variola major virus invades the oropharyngeal (mouth and throat) or the respiratory mucosa, migrates to regional lymph nodes, and begins to multiply. In the initial growth phase the virus seems to move from cell to cell, but around the 12th day, lysis of many infected cells occurs and the virus {{is found in the}} bloodstream in large numbers (this is called <b>viremia),</b> and a second wave of multiplication occurs in the spleen, bone marrow, and lymph nodes.|$|E
5|$|After {{the virus}} enters the body {{there is a}} period of rapid viral replication, leading to an {{abundance}} of virus in the peripheral blood. During primary infection, the level of HIV may reach several million virus particles per milliliter of blood. This response is accompanied by a marked drop in the number of circulating CD4+ T cells. The acute <b>viremia</b> is almost invariably associated with activation of CD8+ T cells, which kill HIV-infected cells, and subsequently with antibody production, or seroconversion. The CD8+ T cell response is thought to be important in controlling virus levels, which peak and then decline, as the CD4+ T cell counts recover. A good CD8+ T cell response has been linked to slower disease progression and a better prognosis, though it does not eliminate the virus.|$|E
5|$|In many respects, the {{neurological}} {{phase of}} infection {{is thought to}} be an accidental diversion of the normal gastrointestinal infection. The mechanisms by which poliovirus enters the CNS are poorly understood. Three nonmutually exclusive hypotheses have been suggested to explain its entry. All theories require primary <b>viremia.</b> The first hypothesis predicts that virions pass directly from the blood into the central nervous system by crossing the blood–brain barrier independent of CD155. A second hypothesis suggests that the virions are transported from peripheral tissues that have been bathed in the viremic blood, for example muscle tissue, to the spinal cord through nerve pathways via retrograde axonal transport. A third hypothesis is that the virus is imported into the CNS via infected monocytes or macrophages.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{error rate}} of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) affects the {{mutation}} frequency {{in a population}} of viral RNAs. Using chikungunya virus (CHIKV), we describe a unique arbovirus fidelity variant with a single C 483 Y amino acid change in the nsP 4 RdRp that increases replication fidelity and generates populations with reduced genetic diversity. In mosquitoes, high fidelity CHIKV presents lower infection and dissemination titers than wild type. In newborn mice, high fidelity CHIKV produces truncated <b>viremias</b> and lower organ titers. These results indicate that increased replication fidelity and reduced genetic diversity negatively impact arbovirus fitness in invertebrate and vertebrate hosts...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Following a 19 -year hiatus, Venezuelan equine {{encephalitis}} (VEE) reemerged in western Venezuela in December 1992. This outbreak {{is important in}} understanding VEE emergence because phylogenetic studies imply that sympatric, enzootic, subtype ID VEE viruses mutated to generate the epizootic/epidemic. Although the 1992 – 1993 strains belong to subtype IC, a serotype implicated in extensive outbreaks during the 1960 s and in 1995, relatively small numbers of human and equine cases occurred in 1992 – 1993. We, therefore, evaluated the pathoge-nicity of these Venezuelan enzootic ID and epizootic IC viruses to determine 1) if they exhibit phenotypes like those described previously for more distantly related enzootic and epizootic strains, and 2) if the 1992 – 1993 outbreak was limited by the inability of these IC viruses to exploit equines as amplification hosts. All strains were virulent in mice and guinea pigs, but were benign for cotton rats, natural hosts of enzootic viruses. However, only the IC strains produced equine disease, with mean peak <b>viremias</b> of 105 suckling mouse 50 % lethal doses per mL serum, and some titers exceeding 107. These <b>viremias</b> approximate those observed previously with VEE strains isolated during more extensive epizootics, suggesting that efficient equine amplification did not limit the scope and duration of the 1992 – 1993 outbreak. Enzootic ID virus infection protected all horses from challenge with epizootic strain P 676, supporting the hypothesis that epizootics bypass regions of enzootic transmission due to natural immunization of equines by enzootic VEE viruses...|$|R

Suboptimal PrEP adherence and HIV infection {{creates an}} opportunity for continued antiretroviral drug activity during undiagnosed infection. We previously showed that macaques infected with SHIV during PrEP with FTC/TDF display reduced acute plasma <b>viremias</b> and limited virus diversity. We investigated the effect of PrEP on acute SHIV DNA dynamics and {{on the size of}} the persistent virus reservoir in lymphoid tissues. Cell-associated SHIV DNA levels in PBMCs were measured in 8 macaques infected during PrEP with FTC/TDF or single-agent TAF and was compared to those seen in untreated infections (n = 10). PrEP breakthrough infections continued treatment with 1 - 2 weekly drug doses to model suboptimal drug exposure during undiagnosed HIV infection in humans. SHIV DNA was also measured in lymphoid tissues collected from FTC/TDF PrEP breakthroughs after 1 year of infection. Compared to untreated controls, PrEP infections had reduced plasma RNA <b>viremias</b> both at peak and throughout weeks 1 - 12 (p< 0. 005). SHIV DNA levels were also reduced at peak and during the first 12 weeks of infection (p< 0. 043) but not throughout weeks 12 - 20. At 1 year, SHIV DNA reservoirs in lymphoid tissues were similar in size among macaques that received PrEP or placebo. Antiviral drug activity due to PrEP limits acute SHIV replication but has only a transient effect on cell-associated SHIV DNA levels. Our model suggests that suboptimal drug exposure in persons that are taking PrEP and become infected with HIV may not be sufficient to reduce the pool of HIV-infected cells, and that treatment intensification may be needed to sustain potential virological benefits from the PrEP regimen...|$|R
5|$|Patients with {{abortive}} polio infections recover completely. In {{those who}} develop only aseptic meningitis, the symptoms {{can be expected}} to persist for two to ten days, followed by complete recovery. In cases of spinal polio, if the affected nerve cells are completely destroyed, paralysis will be permanent; cells that are not destroyed, but lose function temporarily, may recover within four to six weeks after onset. Half the patients with spinal polio recover fully; one-quarter recover with mild disability, and the remaining quarter are left with severe disability. The degree of both acute paralysis and residual paralysis is likely to be proportional to the degree of <b>viremia,</b> and inversely proportional to the degree of immunity.

Moreover, recently isolated WNV strains generate higher peak <b>viremias</b> and mortality in contemporary HOSPs compared to NY 99.

50|$|Usually {{secondary}} <b>viremia</b> {{results in}} higher viral shedding and viral loads within the bloodstream {{due to the}} possibility that the virus is able to reach its natural host cell from the bloodstream and replicate more efficiently than the initial site. An excellent example to profile this distinction is the rabies virus. Usually the virus will replicate briefly within the first site of infection, within the muscle tissues. Viral replication then leads to <b>viremia</b> and the virus spreads to its secondary site of infection, the central nervous system (CNS).

40|$|The {{intrinsic}} plasticity of RNA viruses {{can facilitate}} host range changes {{that lead to}} epidemics. However, evolutionary processes promoting cross-species transfers are poorly defined, especially for arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses). In theory, cross species transfers by arboviruses may be constrained by their alternating infection of disparate hosts, where optimal replication in one host involves a fitness tradeoff for the other. Accordingly, freeing arboviruses from alternate replication via specialization in a single host should accelerate adaptation. This hypothesis has been tested by using cell culture model systems with inconclusive results. Therefore, we tested it using an in vivo system with Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), an emerging alphavirus of the Americas. VEEV serially passaged in mosquitoes exhibited increased mosquito infectivity and vertebrate-specialized strains produced higher <b>viremias.</b> Conversely, alternately passaged VEEV experienced no detectable fitness gains in either host. These results suggest that arbovirus adaptation and evolution is limited by obligate host alternation and predict that arboviral emergence via host range changes may be less frequent than that of single host animal RNA viruses...|$|R
