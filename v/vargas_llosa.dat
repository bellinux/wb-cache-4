5|$|Like {{many other}} Latin American intellectuals, <b>Vargas</b> <b>Llosa</b> was {{initially}} {{a supporter of}} the Cuban revolutionary government of Fidel Castro. He studied Marxism in depth as a university student and was later persuaded by communist ideals after the success of the Cuban Revolution. Gradually, <b>Vargas</b> <b>Llosa</b> came to believe that socialism was incompatible with what he considered to be general liberties and freedoms. The official rupture between the writer and the policies of the Cuban government occurred with the so-called 'Padilla Affair', when the Castro regime imprisoned the poet Heberto Padilla for a month in 1971. <b>Vargas</b> <b>Llosa,</b> along with other intellectuals of the time, wrote to Castro protesting the Cuban political system and its imprisonment of the artist. <b>Vargas</b> <b>Llosa</b> has identified himself with liberalism rather than extreme left-wing political ideologies ever since. Since he relinquished his earlier leftism, he has opposed both left- and right-wing authoritarian regimes.|$|E

5|$|<b>Vargas</b> <b>Llosa's</b> fourth major novel, The War of the End of the World (La guerra del fin del mundo), was {{published}} in 1981 and was his first attempt at a historical novel. This work initiated a radical change in <b>Vargas</b> <b>Llosa's</b> style towards themes such as messianism and irrational human behaviour. It recreates the War of Canudos, an incident in 19th-century Brazil in which an armed millenarian cult held off a siege by the national army for months. As in <b>Vargas</b> <b>Llosa's</b> earliest work, this novel carries a sober and serious theme, and its tone is dark. <b>Vargas</b> <b>Llosa's</b> bold exploration of humanity's propensity to idealize violence, and his account of a man-made catastrophe brought on by fanaticism on all sides, earned the novel substantial recognition.|$|R

5|$|<b>Vargas</b> <b>Llosa</b> {{lived with}} his {{maternal}} family in Arequipa until a year after his parents' divorce, when his maternal grandfather was named honorary consul for Peru in Bolivia. With his mother and her family, <b>Vargas</b> <b>Llosa</b> then moved to Cochabamba, Bolivia, where he spent {{the early years of}} his childhood. His maternal family, the Llosas, were sustained by his grandfather, who managed a cotton farm. As a child, <b>Vargas</b> <b>Llosa</b> was led to believe that his father had died—his mother and her family did not want to explain that his parents had separated. During the government of Peruvian President José Bustamante y Rivero, Vargas Llosa's maternal grandfather obtained a diplomatic post in the northern Peruvian coastal city of Piura and the entire family returned to Peru. While in Piura, <b>Vargas</b> <b>Llosa</b> attended elementary school at the religious academy Colegio Salesiano. In 1946, at the age of ten, he moved to Lima and met his father for the first time. His parents re-established their relationship and lived in Magdalena del Mar, a middle-class Lima suburb, during his teenage years. While in Lima, he studied at the Colegio La Salle, a Christian middle school, from 1947 to 1949.|$|E
5|$|When <b>Vargas</b> <b>Llosa</b> was fourteen, {{his father}} {{sent him to}} the Leoncio Prado Military Academy in Lima. At the age of 16, before his graduation, <b>Vargas</b> <b>Llosa</b> began working as an amateur {{journalist}} for local newspapers. He withdrew from the military academy and finished his studies in Piura, where he worked for the local newspaper, La Industria, and witnessed the theatrical performance of his first dramatic work, La huida del Inca.|$|E
5|$|As for hobbies, <b>Vargas</b> <b>Llosa</b> is {{very fond}} of {{association}} football, and is a renowned supporter of Universitario de Deportes. The writer himself has confessed in his book A Fish in the Water since childhood {{he has been a}} fan of the 'cream colored' team from Peru, which was first seen in the field one day in 1946 when he was only 10 years old. In February 2011, <b>Vargas</b> <b>Llosa</b> was awarded with an honorary life membership of this football club, in a ceremony which took place in the Monumental Stadium of Lima.|$|E

5|$|From 1974 to 1987, <b>Vargas</b> <b>Llosa</b> {{focused on}} his writing, but also {{took the time to}} pursue other endeavors. In 1975, he co-directed an {{unsuccessful}} motion-picture adaptation of his novel, Captain Pantoja and the Secret Service. In 1976 he was elected President of PEN International, the worldwide association of writers and oldest human rights organisation, a position he held until 1979. During this time, <b>Vargas</b> <b>Llosa</b> constantly traveled to speak at conferences organized by internationally renowned institutions, such as the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the University of Cambridge, where he was Simón Bolívar Professor and an Overseas Fellow of Churchill College in 1977–78.|$|E
5|$|On November 18, 2010, <b>Vargas</b> <b>Llosa</b> {{received}} the honorary degree Degree of Letters from the City College of New York of the City University of New York, {{where he also}} delivered the President's Lecture.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} novel has been {{acclaimed}} in Brazil, it was initially poorly received because a foreigner {{was writing about}} a Brazilian theme. The book was also criticized as revolutionary and anti-socialist. <b>Vargas</b> <b>Llosa</b> says that this book is his favorite and was his most difficult accomplishment.|$|E

5000|$|Isaac Humala Núñez is a labour {{lawyer from}} Ayacucho and the ideological {{leader of the}} Movimiento Etnocacerista, a group of ethnic nationalists in Peru. He is a former {{communist}} leader {{who served as the}} model for a colourful character in Peruvian novelist Mario <b>Vargas</b> <b>Llosa's</b> novel [...] "Conversation in the Cathedral." [...] He was <b>Vargas</b> <b>Llosa's</b> teacher of Marxism-Leninism when the writer became a member of a university communist cell.|$|R
5|$|Because of the book's {{ambition}} and execution, critics {{have argued that}} this is one of <b>Vargas</b> <b>Llosa's</b> greatest literary pieces.|$|R
5|$|The {{novel is}} a {{combination}} of fact and fiction. Blending together these two elements is important in any historical novel, but especially in The Feast of the Goat because <b>Vargas</b> <b>Llosa</b> chose to narrate an actual event through the minds of both real and fictional characters. Some characters are fictional, and those that are non-fictional still have fictionalized aspects in the book. The general details of the assassination are true, and the assassins are all real people. While they lie in wait for the Dictator to arrive, they recount actual crimes of the regime, such as the murder of the Mirabal sisters. However, other details are invented by <b>Vargas</b> <b>Llosa,</b> such as Amadito's murder of the brother of the woman he loved.|$|E
5|$|The Latin American Boom was {{a flourishing}} of literature, poetry and {{criticism}} in Latin America during the 1960s and 1970s, when writers from this region explored {{new ideas and}} came to international renown {{in a way that}} had not happened previously. Major figures of the boom include Julio Cortázar, Gabriel García Márquez, Carlos Fuentes, Jorge Luis Borges, and Mario <b>Vargas</b> <b>Llosa.</b>|$|E
5|$|Former President of the United States Barack Obama {{has said}} that The Wire is his {{favorite}} television series.

5|$|In 2006, <b>Vargas</b> <b>Llosa</b> wrote The Bad Girl (Travesuras de la niña mala), which {{journalist}} Kathryn Harrison argues is a rewrite (rather {{than simply}} a recycling) of Gustave Flaubert's Madame Bovary (1856). In Vargas Llosa's version, the plot relates the decades-long obsession of its narrator, a Peruvian expatriate in Paris, {{with a woman}} with whom he first fell in love when both were teenagers.|$|E
5|$|Literary scholar M. Keith Booker {{argues that}} <b>Vargas</b> <b>Llosa</b> perfects the {{technique}} of interlacing dialogues in his novel The Green House. By combining two conversations that occur at different times, he creates {{the illusion of a}} flashback. <b>Vargas</b> <b>Llosa</b> also sometimes uses this technique as a means of shifting location by weaving together two concurrent conversations happening in different places. This technique is a staple of his repertoire, which he began using {{near the end of his}} first novel, The Time of the Hero. However, he does not use interlacing dialogues in the same way in all of his novels. For example, in The Green House the technique is used in a serious fashion to achieve a sober tone and to focus on the interrelatedness of important events separated in time or space. In contrast, Captain Pantoja and the Special Service employs this strategy for comic effects and uses simpler spatial shifts. This device is similar to both Virginia Woolf's mixing of different characters' soliloquies and Gustave Flaubert's counterpoint technique in which he blends together conversation with other events, such as speeches.|$|E
5|$|Rafael Trujillo, known also as The Goat, The Chief, and The Benefactor, is a fictionalized {{character}} {{based on}} the real dictator of the Dominican Republic from 1930 to 1961 and the official President of the Republic from 1930 to 1938 and 1943 to 1952. In The Feast of the Goat, <b>Vargas</b> <b>Llosa</b> imagines the innermost thoughts of the dictator, and retells The Goat's last hours from his own perspective.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} <b>Vargas</b> <b>Llosa's</b> works have been adapted for the screen, {{including}} The Time of the Hero and Captain Pantoja and the Special Service (both by the Peruvian director Francisco Lombardi) and The Feast of the Goat (by <b>Vargas</b> <b>Llosa's</b> cousin, Luis Llosa). Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter {{was turned into}} the English-language film, Tune in Tomorrow. The Feast of the Goat has also been adapted as a theatrical play by Jorge Alí Triana, a Colombian playwright and director.|$|R
500|$|The Feast of the Goat is {{only the}} second of <b>Vargas</b> <b>Llosa's</b> novels to be set outside Peru (the first being The War of the End of the World). [...] It is also unusual because it's the first to have a female protagonist: as critic Lynn Walford writes of the leading {{character}} in The Feast of the Goat, and also <b>Vargas</b> <b>Llosa's</b> subsequent book The Way to Paradise, [...] "both are utterly unlike any of the other female characters in his previous novels".|$|R

5|$|In her {{treatment}} of the novel, María Regina Ruiz claims that power gives its wielder {{the ability to make}} prohibitions; prohibitions that are reflected in history, the study of which reveals what is and what is not told. The government's actions in The Feast of the Goat demonstrate the discourse of prohibition: foreign newspapers and magazines were prohibited from entering Trujillo's country as they were seen {{as a threat to the}} government's ideas. Mario <b>Vargas</b> <b>Llosa</b> takes part in this discourse by recounting what was prohibited.|$|E
5|$|Many of Vargas Llosa's {{works are}} {{influenced}} by the writer's perception of Peruvian society and his own experiences as a native Peruvian. Increasingly, however, he has expanded his range, and tackled themes that arise {{from other parts of the}} world. In his essays, <b>Vargas</b> <b>Llosa</b> has made many criticisms of nationalism in different parts of the world. Another change over the course of his career has been a shift from a style and approach associated with literary modernism, to a sometimes playful postmodernism.|$|E
5|$|Mario <b>Vargas</b> <b>Llosa</b> {{was born}} to a middle-class family on March 28, 1936, in the {{southern}} Peruvian provincial city of Arequipa. He was {{the only child of}} Ernesto Vargas Maldonado and Dora Llosa Ureta (the former a radio operator in an aviation company, the latter the daughter of an old criollo family), who separated a few months before his birth. Shortly after Mario's birth, his father revealed that he {{was having an affair with}} a German woman; consequently, Mario has two younger half-brothers: Enrique and Ernesto Vargas.|$|E
