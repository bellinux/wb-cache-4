Saks and Yu (Proceedings of the 6 th ACM Conference on Electronic Commerce (EC' 05), 2005, 286 - 293) have shown that when the number of outcomes is finite and i's <b>valuation</b> <b>type</b> space is convex, nonnegativity of the length of all 2 -cycles is sufficient for the nonnegativity of the length of all k-cycles. In this article, it is shown that if each individual's <b>valuation</b> <b>type</b> space is a convex product space and a mild domain regularity condition is satisfied, then (i) the nonnegativity of all 2 -cycles implies that all k-cycles have zero length and (ii) all 2 -cycles having zero length is {{necessary and}} sufficient for dominant strategy implementability. 2 -cycle condition, dominant strategy implementation, mechanism design, revenue equivalence, Rockafellar-Rochet Theorem, Saks-Yu Theorem...|$|E

We compare this technique with the classic Max–Min valuation method of decision making. We discuss a generalization of the MMR method leading to a parameterized family of minimal regret methods. We study this class in detail. An approach to decision making which combines <b>valuation</b> <b>type</b> decision functions with regret based decision functions is introduced. We apply the minimal regret method of decision making to situations in which our uncertainty profile is represented by a Dempster–Shafer belief structure...|$|E
40|$|When {{a foreign}} {{monopolist}} sets a single market clearing price for its product, {{the sign of}} the optimal tariff is determined by the extent of pass through (also known as the terms of trade effect). However, when a foreign monopolist employs a second degree price discrimination mechanism in the domestic market the calculus of welfare maximization is very different. While there are still terms of trade effects from the imposition of a tariff, the existence of such effects are neither necessary nor sufficient to determine {{the sign of the}} optimal tariff. Instead the distribution of valuations within the population is the key determinant of the nature of policy intervention. This result differs significantly from the uniform price case and is driven by the incentive compatibility constraint which places the distribution of types {{at the center of the}} analysis. If there is a relatively large fraction of high <b>valuation</b> <b>types</b> in the population, then domestic information rents may be increased by subsidizing imports thereby increasing the consumption of the low <b>valuation</b> <b>types</b> and moving the incentive constraint in favor of the high <b>valuation</b> <b>types.</b> However, if the share of high types in the population is relatively small then the increase in information rents will also be small but the fiscal implications of a subsidy will be large. Consequently, the optimal policy will be to impose a trade tax. Terms of trade Trade policy Discrimination...|$|R

The standard travel cost survey design is enriched to include a contingent <b>valuation</b> <b>type</b> question about peoples ’ willingness to accept compensation to forgo a precisely defined recreational experience. It is hypothesized that individually revealed value of time more appropriately reflects the opportunity costs of time associated with a particular aspect of recreation than the wage rate which measures the trade-off between work and leisure generally. The results seem to indicate a better overall tit for the models with the elicited value of individual consumer’s time than for the models with the more traditional hourly earnings (wage rates). The importance of the correct measurement of the opportunity cost time is illustrated by showing that estimated consumer surpluses based on two different value of time measurements differ significantly.

In this paper, an uninformed contestant with valuation vx competes against an informed opponent with valuation, either high vh or low vl.

(ii) When the order of valuations is vx â‰¥ vh â‰¥ vl, there is no separation if vh and vl are close. Sandbagging is cheap due to the proximity of valuations.

40|$|Following bus {{deregulation}} in Britain, {{there has}} been an increased need to assess the case for maintaining unprofitable bus services, and for ranking priorities for subsidy. This paper considers the benefits which may be provided by maintaining a public transport service. Obviously, consumers ' surplus to existing users is a major benefit; however, in the context of lightly used unprofitable services benefits in terms of reduced congestion, environmental effects and accident savings are likely to be less relevant. On the other hand, non Muse benefits such as benefits arising from the provision of public transport to friends and relatives, option values and altruistic benefits from the provision of transport for the community at large may exist. We consider the problems with alternative survey methods to identify these benefits, paying particular attention to risks of bias, before describing the method adopted in our own surveys. These relied on an in-,depth discussion of actual journeys recorded in a travel diary, to identify the alternatives to the bus which were available and the fare level at which these would be taken up, followed by a contingent <b>valuation</b> <b>type</b> question on non-use benefits {{in the context of a}} discussion of priorities in terms of the use of subsidies. Surveys were undertaken in two very different types of community; a city housing estate and a rural village. It was found that users received an average consumers ' surplus of the order of lOOo/o on their trips, whilst inhabitants of the city housing estate were on average willing to pay some SOp per week for the non-use benefit...|$|E
40|$|Recommender {{systems such}} as Amazon, offer uses recommendations, or {{suggestions}} of items to try or buy. We propose a novel classification of reasons for including explanations in recommender systems. Our {{focus is on the}} aim of effectiveness, or decision support, and we contrast it with other metrics such as satisfaction and persuasion. In user studies, we found that people varied in the features they found important, and composed a short list of features in two domains (movies and cameras). We then built a natural language explanation testbed system, considering these features as well as the limitations of using commercial data. This testbed was used in a series of experiments to test whether personalization of explanations affects effectiveness, persuasion and satisfaction. We chose a simple form of personalization which considers likely constraints of a recommender system (e. g. limited meta-data related to the user) as well as brevity. In these experiments we found that: 1. Explanations help participants to make decisions compared to recommendations without explanations, we saw as a significant decrease in opt-outs in item ratings – participants {{were more likely to be}} able to give an initial rating for an item if they were given an explanation, and the likelihood of receiving a rating increased for feature-based explanations compared to a baseline. 2. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, our method of personalization could damage effectiveness for both movies and cameras which are domains that differ with regard to two dimensions which we found affected perceived effectiveness: cost (low vs. high), and <b>valuation</b> <b>type</b> (subjective vs. objective). 3. Participants were more satisfied with feature-based than baseline explanations. If the personalization is perceived as relevant to them, then personalized feature-based explanations were preferred over non-personalized. 4. Satisfaction with explanation was also reflected in the proportion of opt-outs. The opt-out rate for the explanations was highest in the baseline for all experiments. This was the case despite the different types of explanation baselines used in the two domains. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|Consider {{a seller}} with {{multiple}} digital {{goods or services}} for sale, such as movies, software, or network services, over which buyers may have complicated preferences. In order to sell these items through an incentive-compatible auction mechanism, this mechanism should have the property that each bidder is offered a set of prices that do {{not depend on the}} value of her bid. The problem of designing a revenue-maximizing auction is known in the economics literature as the optimal auction design problem [Myerson 1981]. The classical model for optimal auction design assumes a Bayesian setting in which players’ <b>valuations</b> (<b>types)</b> are drawn from some probability distribution that furthermore is known to the mechanism designer. For example, to sell a single item of fixed marginal cost, one should set the price that maximizes the profit margin per sale times the probability a random person would be willing to buy at that price. However, in complex or non-static environments, these assumptions become unrealistic. In these settings, machine learning can provide a natural approach to the design of near-optimal mechanisms without such strong assumptions or degree of prior knowledge. Specifically, notice that while a truthful auction mechanism should have the propert...|$|R
40|$|The Generalized Second Price (GSP) auction is {{the primary}} auction used for monetizing {{the use of the}} Internet. It is {{well-known}} that truthtelling is not a dominant strategy in this auction and that inefficient equilibria can arise. Edelman et al. and Varian show that an efficient equilibrium always exists in the full information setting.

The Generalized Second Price (GSP) auction gives rise to a further form of uncertainty: the selection of quality factors resulting in uncertainty about the behavior of the underlying ad allocation algorithm.

For the full information setting, we prove a surprisingly low upper bound of 1. 282 on the price of anarchy over pure Nash equilibria, nearly matching a lower bound of 1. 259 for the case of three advertisers. Further, we do not require that the system reaches equilibrium, and give similarly low bounds also on the quality degradation for any no-regret learning outcome. Our conclusion is that the number of advertisers in the auction has almost no impact on the price of anarchy, and that the efficiency of GSP is very robust with respect to the belief and rationality assumptions imposed on the participants.
