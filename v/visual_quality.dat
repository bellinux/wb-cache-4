5|$|At release, 1979 Revolution {{was well}} {{received}} by critics, with praise particularly {{directed at the}} narrative, characters and performances, and historical representations, though some criticism was directed at the quick-time sequences and <b>visual</b> <b>quality.</b> The game was also criticized by an Iranian journalist who declared it as propaganda. Khonsari felt afraid to reenter Iran as a result, {{and other members of}} the development team adopted aliases for protection. The game was nominated for multiple year-end accolades from several gaming publications.|$|E
5|$|The story follows Nero, a {{teenager}} possessing demonic powers {{who is on}} a mission to stop the series' main character, Dante, after he assassinates demons from the Order of the Sword including its leader. During the game, the player controls both Nero and Dante as they fight enemies in close combat using firearms, swords, and other weapons. Devil May Cry 4 was the first entry in the series to release for multiple consoles at the same time; during its development, Capcom focused on all versions achieving the same <b>visual</b> <b>quality.</b>|$|E
5|$|The title marked Codemasters' {{debut in}} {{developing}} a mobile game internally. The goal {{of the project was}} to create a core, rally racing experience for mobile devices. The development team chose to use Colin McRae Rally 2.0 as the foundation, taking its tracks, driving model, and pacenotes for the new title. Original vehicle models were reused however aspects of the game's graphics were enhanced to provide the higher <b>visual</b> <b>quality</b> expected by modern standards. Numerous sound assets were replaced with samples from other Codemasters driving games.|$|E

5|$|The game's {{original}} concept {{included an}} underground base that connected {{all of the}} levels, but this element was scrapped by publisher Psygnosis due to financial constraints. Several additional levels were also cut from the game due to time restrictions, including one inspired by Prince of Persia (1989). Following Walkers launch in February 1993, Dunlop began working on a port for the Mega Drive, which was cancelled shortly thereafter. Glancy was also recruited {{to work on a}} sequel, Walker 2, which would have overhauled the <b>visual</b> <b>quality</b> of the first game and include a customisable mech. Planned for release on the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, it was eventually cancelled.|$|E
5|$|One of Igarashi's {{prominent}} concerns during {{development was}} addressing the criticism expressed concerning Harmony of Dissonance. Igarashi {{noted that the}} music in Harmony of Dissonance had not been well received and Michiru Yamane, who had previously worked on the acclaimed music for Symphony of the Night, was hired in order to compose for Aria of Sorrow. The development team worked on the game's audio cycles, as well as delegating more cartridge space and processor cycles for the sound. Maintaining the <b>visual</b> <b>quality</b> of Harmony of Dissonance was a chief objective during development, as many reviewers had felt that Harmony of Dissonance had excelled in graphics {{at the cost of}} the audio. Furthermore, the staff tried to improve the series' gameplay system while retaining fan-favorite elements. Certain aspects that were missing in Harmony of Dissonance, such as hidden rooms, were incorporated into Aria of Sorrow. Igarashi added Soul trading via a link cable to assist players with collecting every soul in the game, which he believed would be cumbersome to accomplish alone.|$|E
5|$|When {{the game}} was renamed and changed platforms, the team chose Luminous Studio as the main game engine. The game's {{real-time}} graphics used 5,000 polygons per-frame, bringing its <b>visual</b> <b>quality</b> close to modern CGI cutscenes and to a level {{that would have been}} impossible for the previous generation's hardware. The game's native resolution was 1920 × 1080 pixels (1080p), with a frame rate of 30 frames per second: this was defined as being native to the game as opposed to upscaled games from the previous generation. For polygon models, the combined number of visible and occluded polygons was estimated as being 5,000,000. This number was approximately five times the amount of equivalent detail from last-generation games. Models used over 600 character bones: 150 bones were created for the face, 300 for the hair, and 150 for the body. A bone-based physical simulation technology was applied so that clothing would react to the body's movements. The polygon count for character hair was estimated as 20,000, the same number used in an entire character in last-generation games. All of these were achievable {{due to the fact that}} the eighth-generation console hardware had approximately sixteen times the amount of storage available in the previous generation.|$|E

Population of the survey contains 750 students studying in first semester of Elmi-Karbordi University of Kermanshah during 2009 - 2010 academic year so that 258 of them were chosen according to simple random sampling method. Emotional intelligence tools were bar-n and questionnaire made by researcher of visual literacy so that their formal content validity was analyzed according to theories of sensing and measurement professionals and the validity was achieved through. / 87 Cronbach's alpha coefficient. According to theoretical theories, main dimensions of emotional intelligence are categorized into five principles: internal intelligence, interpersonal intelligence, stress control and general morality. And main factors of visual literacy are divided into two general categories: a) visual elements such as dot, line, level, amount; b) <b>visual</b> <b>qualities</b> such as balance, harmony, rhythm, composition. For analyzing data, descriptive statistical methods such as average, median, view and inferential statistical tests such as correlation and variance analysis have been used.

In addition, the new client is less resource-intensive on the graphical processing unit and may improve frame rates. However, there are no current plans to upgrade to DirectX 12.

25|$|HD DVD competed {{primarily}} with Blu-ray Disc. Both formats were designed as successors to DVD, capable of higher quality {{video and audio}} playback, and of greater capacity when used to store video, audio, and computer data.

25|$|Being {{earlier than}} the {{mainstream}} use of 'gothic revival' designs for chapel architecture, and in all probability with the express intention of weakening the all too frequent association of gothic with 'high church' buildings, which was being advocated rather pompously by Augustus Pugin junior, a distinctly 'low gothic revivalist' style was gradually developed by Hosking and his clients, from a conventional gothic 'mister-like' starting point. Hosking was successful in producing a unique and careful interpretation of the gothic style which was well-suited to the 'low church sentiments' of his clients. For example, stock brick rather than traditional stone was used {{for much of the}} exterior, introducing a <b>visual</b> <b>quality</b> similar to the Brick Gothic style of Baltic countries, Sweden, Estonia etc. Moreover, neo-classical features (i.e. semi-circular arches) were carefully composited into the horse carriage entrance (porte cochere), and each viewing turret bore a simple romanesque oculus to let light onto its newel staircase, rather than a pointed or quatrefoil gothic window or an oculus whose aperture was in the gothic style.|$|E

40|$|Because {{design is}} often {{conceived}} of as a language, it is worthwhile {{to take a closer}} look at this relationship. It is especially interesting to look at the transition from the verbal to the visual in interpretations and analyses of design. This article discusses some salient topics appearing in this context. In particular, claims made in the books by Kress and van Leeuwen (1996) and Krippendorff (2006) are discussed, because their approaches are widely used in design discourses, in journals, schools, exhibition catalogues, etc. These texts probably influence design research, but, in the present author’s view, do not help interpretation of <b>visual</b> <b>qualities</b> in design. The underlying critical assumption in this article is that the language metaphor and concepts derived from linguistics do not do justice to the interpretations of design objects, especially concerning their <b>visual</b> <b>qualities.</b> When these qualities are underrated, it seems difficult to assess the cultural significance of design. </p...|$|R
