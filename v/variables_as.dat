5|$|Instances of the 2-satisfiability problem are {{typically}} expressed as Boolean formulas {{of a special}} type, called conjunctive normal form (2-CNF) or Krom formulas. Alternatively, they may be expressed as a special type of directed graph, the implication graph, which expresses the variables of an instance and their negations as vertices in a graph, and constraints on pairs of <b>variables</b> <b>as</b> directed edges. Both {{of these kinds of}} inputs may be solved in linear time, either by a method based on backtracking or by using the strongly connected components of the implication graph.|$|E
5|$|Before {{accretion}} {{of material}} pushes a white dwarf {{close to the}} Chandrasekhar limit, accreted hydrogen-rich material on the surface may ignite in a less destructive type of thermonuclear explosion powered by hydrogen fusion. These surface explosions can be repeated {{as long as the}} white dwarf's core remains intact. This weaker kind of repetitive cataclysmic phenomenon is called a (classical) nova. Astronomers have also observed dwarf novae, which have smaller, more frequent luminosity peaks than the classical novae. These are thought to be caused by the release of gravitational potential energy when part of the accretion disc collapses onto the star, rather than through a release of energy due to fusion. In general, binary systems with a white dwarf accreting matter from a stellar companion are called cataclysmic <b>variables.</b> <b>As</b> well as novae and dwarf novae, several other classes of these variables are known, including polars and intermediate polars, both of which feature highly magnetic white dwarfs. Both fusion- and accretion-powered cataclysmic variables have been observed to be X-ray sources.|$|E

25|$|The {{debugger}} allows setting breakpoints (which allow execution to {{be stopped}} temporarily at a certain position) and watches (which monitor the values of <b>variables</b> <b>as</b> the execution progresses). Breakpoints can be conditional, meaning they get triggered when the condition is met. Code can be stepped over, i.e., run one line (of source code) at a time. It can either step into functions to debug inside it, or step over it, i.e., {{the execution of the}} function body isn't available for manual inspection. The debugger supports Edit and Continue, i.e., it allows code to be edited as it is being debugged. When debugging, if the mouse pointer hovers over any variable, its current value is displayed in a tooltip ("data tooltips"), where it can also be modified if desired. During coding, the Visual Studio debugger lets certain functions be invoked manually from the Immediate tool window. The parameters to the method are supplied at the Immediate window.|$|E
25|$|Competitiveness between {{boats in}} the class is {{maintained}} by requiring the boats to be {{in compliance with the}} 12 Metre formula. Designers and builders are required to take into account such things as the sail area, the boat length at the waterline and the boat girth (the measurement around the boat from one sideboard, under the keel, and then over the top on the opposite side back to the original side). The measurements are then weighted in the formula. For example, the present formula takes the square root of the sail area rather than total area. The combination of weighted measurements must be {{less than or equal to}} 12 metres. Designers are free to change any of the component <b>variables,</b> <b>as</b> well as other details, such as the size of the rudder and keel, so long as the corresponding changes elsewhere produce an ultimate sum of 12 metres and the resulting boat is both seaworthy and safe. Though disparity between boats are minimized by the rule, enough variation exists so that races are as much about design and construction as they are about seamanship and tactics.|$|E

500|$|The {{estimates}} of carbon intensity {{for a given}} biofuel depend on the assumptions regarding several <b>variables.</b> <b>As</b> of 2008, multiple full life cycle studies had found that corn ethanol, cellulosic ethanol and Brazilian sugarcane ethanol produce lower greenhouse gas emissions than gasoline.

A controversial paper published in February 2008 in Sciencexpress by {{a team led by}} Searchinger from Princeton University concluded that such effects offset the (positive) direct effects of both corn and cellulosic ethanol and that Brazilian sugarcane performed better, but still resulted in a small carbon debt.|$|E
500|$|There are {{two other}} power {{conjugate}} systems on the same variables that are in use. [...] The mobility analogy maps mechanical force to electric current instead of voltage. [...] This analogy is widely used by mechanical filter designers and frequently in audio electronics also. [...] The mapping {{has the advantage of}} preserving network topologies across domains but does not maintain the mapping of impedances. [...] The Trent analogy classes the power conjugate <b>variables</b> <b>as</b> either across variables, or through variables depending on whether they act across an element of a system or through it. [...] This largely ends up the same as the mobility analogy except {{in the case of the}} fluid flow domain (including the acoustics domain). [...] Here pressure is made analogous to voltage (as in the impedance analogy) instead of current (as in the mobility analogy). [...] However, force in the mechanical domain is analogous to current because force acts through an object.|$|E
