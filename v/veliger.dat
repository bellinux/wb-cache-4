5|$|In the spring, {{the adult}} females {{of this species}} lay eggs in {{tower-shaped}} structures. The eggs hatch as <b>veliger</b> larvae, which can float in the plankton for up to 14 weeks before settling onto the seabed as tiny snails. Crabs are a predator of this sea snail. After {{the death of the}} snails, if the shells are still intact they are often used by hermit crabs.|$|E
5|$|Spiny {{scallops}} are dioecious, individuals being either male or female. They become mature {{at about}} 2 {{years old and}} usually live for about 4 years. Breeding {{takes place in the}} summer. Gametes are released into the water column and fertilisation is external. <b>Veliger</b> larvae begin to develop from the eggs in about 2 days and drift with the plankton for 40 days, growing to a maximum valve length of 240μ (0.01 inch). The larvae have a tuft of broad, compound cilia near the mouth. The velum, the locomotory and feeding organ, has bands of cilia running down it. The simple eyes and rudimentary gills start developing on about the 25th day. The foot becomes visible on the 15th day and the propodium (the projecting front end of the foot) develops on about the 28th. By the 34rd day, the larva is crawling about using its foot and its cilia. Metamorphosis takes place on about the 40th day. Over the course of 48 hours, the internal organs undergo a 90° rotation, the valves, hinge and ligament appear and the gills lengthen. A swimming <b>veliger</b> larva has become a benthic juvenile scallop.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} molluscan {{reproductive system}} relies on external fertilization, {{but with more}} complex variations. All produce eggs, from which may emerge trochophore larvae, more complex <b>veliger</b> larvae, or miniature adults. Two gonads sit next to the coelom, a small cavity that surrounds the heart, into which they shed ova or sperm. The nephridia extract the gametes from the coelom and emit them into the mantle cavity. Molluscs that use such a system remain of one sex all their lives and rely on external fertilization. Some molluscs use internal fertilization and/or are hermaphrodites, functioning as both sexes; both of these methods require more complex reproductive systems.|$|E
40|$|A {{critical}} step in understanding how temperature will affect biodiversity in coastal ecosystems is to {{gain insight into}} how the tolerances, and ultimately survival, of early life history stages will influence the distribution and abundance of adults. We assessed the thermal tolerance of encapsulated veliger-stage larvae of a common dogwhelk, Nucella ostrina, {{that occur in the}} rocky intertidal zone on the west coast of North America. Results showed that <b>veligers</b> collected from northern latitudes in Washington State were less tolerant of heat stress than those from central sites in California.

50|$|Like {{other species}} of Melampus, the coffee bean snail {{is one of the}} few pulmonate snails to {{reproduce}} via planktonic larvae called <b>veligers</b> (Ruppert & Barnes 1994). Upon hatching, the <b>veligers</b> will spend between 4-6 weeks in the plankton, and then return to the mangroves on a high tide, and metamorphose into juvenile snails.|$|R
5|$|The rate {{of growth}} of the Antarctic scallop is very slow {{compared}} to that of scallops living in warmer seas. It matures at 5 to 7 years old and spawning takes place in late summer. Little is known about the development of the <b>veliger</b> larvae but they may be planktonic for 4 or 5 months. Besides feeding on phytoplankton and small zooplankton, they may absorb dissolved organic matter and consume bacterioplankton. When they settle, metamorphosis takes place and the juveniles attach themselves with byssus threads, often attaching these to the upper valves of scallops, and remain attached for 3 to 5 years. While attached to the adult shell, the juveniles benefit from food particles in the fine detritus thrown up into the water column by movements of the adult. While studying the sizes and growth rates of adults, researchers came to realize that there were gaps in their records which were due to the fact that, in some years, no juveniles had survived.|$|E
5|$|Laevistrombus {{canarium}} is gonochoristic, {{which means}} that each individual animal is distinctly male or female. The breeding season starts in late November and continues until early March. After internal fertilization the female produces and spawns a long, gelatinous tubular structure containing multiple eggs. This structure then coils itself and compacts, forming a creamy-white egg mass. Each egg mass may contain 50,000–70,000 eggs; the females usually lay them on seagrass, where they remain attached. In about 110–130 hours the embryo of L.canarium grows from a single cell to a <b>veliger</b> (a larval form common to marine and fresh-water gastropod and bivalve mollusks) and then hatches. The hatching process takes 12–15 hours. After hatching, the larvae can be assigned to four distinct developmental stages throughout their short planktonic life (based on morphological features and other characteristics). Usually, larvae up to 3 days old are Stage I veligers; 4–8-day-old larvae are Stage II; 9–16-day-old larvae are Stage III, and larvae from 17 days to metamorphosis are Stage IV. L.canarium larvae develop faster compared to other species in the same family, including the West Indian fighting conch (Strombus pugilis) and the milk conch (Lobatus costatus). Larval development may be highly influenced by environmental conditions, such as temperature and the quality and availability of food. Metamorphosis in L.canarium can be recognised by loss of the larval velar lobes {{and the development of}} the typical leaping motion of juvenile true conches.|$|E
25|$|The {{size of the}} <b>veliger</b> larvae {{is about}} 0.15mm. When animals reached 0.7mm in size, gonads have been {{detected}} in them. Fully mature individuals are 0.8mm in size.|$|E

25|$|The {{next phase}} of {{biomineralisation}} does not commence until the competent <b>veliger</b> larva contacts an environmental cue that induces metamorphosis.

40|$|Since {{the present}} series of {{observations}} on the <b>veligers</b> of Japanese Opisthobranchs was started in 1960, six papers comprising the detailed descriptions of <b>veligers</b> of eighteen species have been published, and here is presented the seventh paper, in which the following three more species are given: Elysia (Elysia) trisinuata BABA of Elysiidae (Ord. Sacoglossa), and Dermatobranchus (Dermatobranchus) striatellus BABA of Arminidae and Aeolidiella japonica ELIOT of Facelinidae, both belonging to Ord. Nudibranchia. All of these species were collected from the seashore near the Seto Marine Biological Laboratory...|$|R
5000|$|Members of {{the order}} Neogastropoda are mostly gonochoric and {{broadcast}} spawners. Embryos develop into planktonic trocophore larvae and later into juvenile <b>veligers</b> before becoming fully grown adults ...|$|R
500|$|Fertilization {{is usually}} external. Typically, a short stage lasts {{a few hours}} or days before the eggs hatch into trochophore larvae. These later develop into <b>veliger</b> larvae which settle on the seabed and undergo {{metamorphosis}} into juveniles that are sometimes (for example {{in the case of}} oysters) known as [...] "spat". In some species, such as those in the genus Lasaea, females draw water containing sperm in through their inhalant siphons and fertilization takes place inside the female. These species then brood the young inside their mantle cavity, eventually releasing them into the water column as <b>veliger</b> larvae or as crawl-away juveniles.|$|E
500|$|During the spring, {{favorable}} food supplies, adequate light, and optimum {{water temperature}} provide conditions for breeding and early growth. At this time, the female deposits hundreds of egg capsules in tower-shaped structures about [...] high. The male fertilizes these eggs. After fertilization, the eggs develop into trochophore larvae, and the eggs subsequently hatch as free swimming microscopic <b>veliger</b> larvae, {{which can be}} carried some distance on ocean currents.|$|E
500|$|The {{main body}} cavity is a hemocoel through which blood circulates; their circulatory systems are mainly open. The [...] "generalized" [...] mollusc's feeding system {{consists}} of a rasping [...] "tongue", the radula, and a complex digestive system in which exuded mucus and microscopic, muscle-powered [...] "hairs" [...] called cilia play various important roles. The generalized mollusc has two paired nerve cords, or three in bivalves. The brain, in species that have one, encircles the esophagus. Most molluscs have eyes, and all have sensors to detect chemicals, vibrations, and touch. The simplest type of molluscan reproductive system relies on external fertilization, but more complex variations occur. All produce eggs, from which may emerge trochophore larvae, more complex <b>veliger</b> larvae, or miniature adults.|$|E

500|$|Queen conch embryos hatch 3–5 {{days after}} spawning. At {{the moment of}} hatching, the [...] protoconch (embryonic shell) is {{translucent}} and has a creamy, off-white background color with small, pustulate [...] markings. This coloration is different from other Caribbean Lobatus, such as Lobatus raninus and Lobatus costatus, which have unpigmented embryonic shells. Afterwards, the emerging two-lobed <b>veliger</b> (a larval form common to various marine and fresh-water gastropod and bivalve mollusks) spend several days developing in the plankton, feeding primarily on phytoplankton. Metamorphosis occurs some 16–40 days from the hatching, when the fully grown protoconch is about 1.2mm high. After the metamorphosis, L.gigas individuals {{spend the rest of}} their lives in the benthic zone (on or in the sediment surface), usually remaining buried during their first year of life.|$|E
500|$|The {{most basic}} {{molluscan}} larva is a trochophore, which is planktonic and feeds on floating food particles {{by using the}} two bands of cilia around its [...] "equator" [...] to sweep food into the mouth, which uses more cilia to drive them into the stomach, which uses further cilia to expel undigested remains through the anus. New tissue grows in the bands of mesoderm in the interior, so the apical tuft and anus are pushed further apart as the animal grows. The trochophore stage is often succeeded by a <b>veliger</b> stage in which the prototroch, the [...] "equatorial" [...] band of cilia nearest the apical tuft, develops into the velum ("veil"), a pair of cilia-bearing lobes with which the larva swims. Eventually, the larva sinks to the seafloor and metamorphoses into the adult form. While metamorphosis is the usual state in molluscs, the cephalopods differ in exhibiting direct development: the hatchling is a 'miniaturized' form of the adult.|$|E
500|$|Zebra mussel infestations in the Mississippi River, [...] Great Lakes {{and other}} Midwest rivers are also {{negatively}} affecting American paddlefish populations. [...] Zebra mussels are an invasive species well adapted for explosive population growth {{as a result}} of high rates of fecundity and recruitment. [...] As filter feeders, zebra mussels rely on plankton and can filter significant amounts of phytoplankton and zooplankton from the water, altering the availability of an important food source for paddlefish and native unionidae. [...] A few days after the fertilization of zebra mussel eggs, a microscopic larva emerges called a <b>veliger.</b> [...] During this initial stage of development, which usually lasts a few weeks, veligers are able to swim freely in the water column with other microscopic animals comprising zooplankton. [...] Veligers are poor swimmers, making them susceptible to predation by any animal that feeds on zooplankton. However, natural predation of zebra mussels at any stage of development has not made a significant contribution to the long-term reduction of zebra mussel populations.|$|E
5000|$|Embryos of Turris babylonia {{develop into}} free-swimming planktonic marine larvae (trocophore) and later into {{juvenile}} <b>veligers.</b> Adults feed on marine worms chased {{by means of}} their venom, similarly to the cone snails.|$|R

5|$|Growth is slow, and the <b>veligers</b> {{are carried}} by the ocean {{currents}} for up to 14 weeks. As the <b>veligers</b> mature, they develop their first shell (the smooth protoconch) and turn into very small juvenile snails, at which point they sink to the ocean floor. As {{is the case in}} all shelled mollusks, the mantle is what secretes the shell; shell growth begins at what will later become the apex of the shell, and typically rotates clockwise. As the animal gradually matures, the mantle continues to secrete shell material. Scotch bonnets complete maturation in one to six years. However, some have lived more than six years.|$|R
2500|$|Several major {{transitions}} in shell pattern and morphology {{can be observed}} during the life of Haliotis asinina. The species has a pelagobenthic life cycle that includes a minimal period of three to four days in the plankton. Biomineralisation begins shortly after hatching, with the fabrication of the larval shell (protoconch) over about a 10-hour period. The initial differentiation of biomineralising cells is likely to include a localised thickening of the dorsal ectoderm followed by an invagination of cells to form the shell gland. The shell gland then evaginates to form the shell field which expands through mitotic divisions to direct the precipitation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) via the secretion of organic molecules. In this way the larval shell (protoconch) is formed. The construction of the haliotid protoconch is complete following torsion. These structures allow the <b>veliger</b> larva to completely retract into a protective environment and rapidly {{fall out of the}} water column.: ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>veliger</b> is {{the second}} larval stage in the {{development}} of gastropods, following the earlier, trochophore, stage. In some species, including virtually all pulmonates, the <b>veliger</b> stage is passed within the egg capsule and the hatching stage is a juvenile rather than a free-living larva. In species with a larval stage, the <b>veliger</b> is exclusively aquatic. Free-living <b>veliger</b> larvae typically feed on phytoplankton; however, the larvae of some species are lecithotrophic (nourished by yolk from the egg that is retained within their bodies) and do not need to feed. In at least some cases, lecithotrophic veligers can also feed on phytoplankton.|$|E
50|$|<b>Veliger</b> larvae are hatched from eggs {{after four}} months of {{development}} from May to early July. <b>Veliger</b> is about 170 μm long (120-278 μm). Veligers feed on plankton (planktotrophic) and they are probably obligate planktotrophs. They can swim with ciliated foot and they are swimming probably for at least eight months. <b>Veliger</b> have pigmented eyespots. Maybe the same chemosensory mechanisms for detecting mussel beds {{can be used by}} its larvae. <b>Veliger</b> in size 600-700 μm can undergo metamorphosis into a snail. Only two protoconchs are known to be found in situ and they measured 630 μm and 615 μm in length.|$|E
