25|$|She {{has been}} {{practicing}} the flute {{for many years}} and is <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> so naturally she joins her school's music ensemble when she enters high school. While initially cold and distant from others, Yasuna gradually changes and becomes much easier to approach. Her friends in the musical ensemble tell her this, and ask her if she changed due to someone she likes, and Yasuna affirms this. Yasuna has shown herself to be very devoted to Hazumu, and in a conversation to Tomari, Yasuna tells her that she wants Hazumu all to herself.|$|E
25|$|Hurd-Wood {{attended}} Rodborough Technology College in Milford, Surrey from 2001 to 2006 for her GCSEs with Art, English Literature, Psychology and Philosophy as subjects. She had tutored lessons {{during the}} filming of Peter Pan in Australia during 2002 to 2003 as her work lasted for a span of 8 to 9 months. She later attended sixth-form Godalming College from 2006 to 2008 to study for her GCE Advanced Levels with Art, Psychology and Philosophy as subjects. Hurd-Wood had considered becoming a marine biologist because of her love for dolphins. She gave up on the idea when she discovered that it would require studying science because {{she thought she was}} not <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> She became interested in working with children who have special needs or disabilities. Hurd-Wood studied linguistics from 2008 at University College London, having completed her first year in 2009, but left the course incomplete before travelling to Australia for the filming of Tomorrow, When the War Began, when she decided to focus entirely on her career in acting.|$|E

When {{they arrived}} on Martha's Vineyard, Butler showed Spielberg {{how he could}} brace a handheld Panaflex camera and take the roll {{out of the boat}} rocking on the waves with his knees instead of using a 400-lb. gimbal. Spielberg embraced the idea. [...] "About 90% of the shots on the boat were handheld," [...] Butler says. [...] "Michael was intrigued by the idea and was <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> We did things that we probably wouldn't have tried without the lightweight camera. Michael even climbed the mast and shot from the top straight down. We also put him in a small boat." ...|$|E

She is assigned to him after the Creedish mass suicide, and generally leads a disappointing, unfulfilled life. Over the years, the caseworker diagnoses Tender with innumerable mental disorders from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (abbreviated [...] "DSM"). One day, she helps Tender clean the house of his employers. She becomes obsessed with cleaning to the point that she virtually takes over Tender's job, even though she isn't <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> The caseworker eventually dies by inhaling chlorine gas created from an ammonia and bleach mixture made by Tender's brother Adam, who intended the gas for Tender.|$|E

[...] However, band members expressed concern that they started out too fast and that they intentionally brought on too much media attention. Members also experienced increasing dissatisfaction with their label. Zehr said, [...] "It's not like the old days, where a label would spend years pumping money to develop an artist... Today it's up to the artists to ready themselves for the big time". He commented as well, [...] "At this point you're kind of turning the label into a bank".|$|E
2500|$|However, {{just before}} Socrates {{is about to}} leave, he is stopped by the [...] "familiar divine sign", his daemon, which always occurs and only just before Socrates is about to do {{something}} he should not. A voice [...] "from this very spot" [...] forbids Socrates to leave before he makes atonement for some offense to the gods. Socrates then admits that he thought both of the preceding speeches were terrible, saying Lysias' repeated itself numerous times, seemed uninterested in its subject, {{and seemed to be}} showing off. Socrates states that he is a [...] "seer". While he is not <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> he is good enough for his purposes, and he recognizes what his offense has been: if love is a god or something divine, as he and Phaedrus both agree he is, he cannot be bad, as the previous speeches have portrayed him. Socrates, baring his head, vows to undergo a rite of purification as a follower of the Muses, and proceeds to give a speech praising the lover.|$|E

60|$|By all the unwritten laws of savage warfare it {{is always}} the redskin who attacks, and with the wiliness of his race he does it just before the dawn, at which time he knows the courage of the whites to be at its lowest ebb. The white men have in the {{meantime}} made a rude stockade on the summit of yonder undulating ground, {{at the foot of}} which a stream runs, for it is destruction to be too far from water. There they await the onslaught, the inexperienced ones clutching their revolvers and treading on twigs, but the old hands sleeping tranquilly until just before the dawn. Through the long black night the savage scouts wriggle, snake-like, among the grass without stirring a blade. The brushwood closes behind them, as silently as sand into which a mole has dived. Not a sound is to be heard, save when they give vent to a wonderful imitation of the lonely call of the coyote. The cry is answered by other braves; and some of them do it even better than the coyotes, who are not <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> So the chill hours wear on, and the long suspense is horribly trying to the paleface who has to live through it for the first time; but to the trained hand those ghastly calls and still ghastlier silences are but an intimation of how the night is marching.|$|E

5000|$|Chakacha is a {{traditional}} music and dance style (a ngoma) of the Swahili people of coastal Kenya and Tanzania, originally associated with weddings and performed and watched by women. In the late 20th century, musical groups such as Mombasa Roots, Safari Sound Band and Them Mushrooms have adapted this style to afropop music. Basically, the women are dressed in very light transparent clothing and have a belt around their waists for ease of movement. Tanzanian ladies, especially around the coastal areas are <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>at</b> this dance. <b>It</b> is also somewhat associated with Taarab, another type of music style adapted in the coast and mainly performed by women.|$|R

The Northern Territory variant of P. fimbriata is not as good as the Queensland one as catching web spiders, but better than the Sri Lanka variant and some other species of Portia.
