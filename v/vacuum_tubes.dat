5|$|Amperex Electronic Corporation was a {{manufacturer}} of <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubes</b> and semiconductors.|$|E
5|$|Although {{other firms}} {{expressed}} interest to Kates and Rogers Majestic {{in using the}} tubes, issues with acquiring patents prevented him, Rogers Majestic, or the University of Toronto from patenting the tubes anywhere outside Canada until 1955, and the patent application was not accepted in the United States until March 1957, six years after filing. By then, research and use of <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubes</b> was heavily waning {{in the face of}} the rise of the superior transistor, preventing any re-visitation of Bertie or similar machines. Kates went on to a distinguished career in Canadian engineering, but did not return to working on <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubes</b> or computer games.|$|E
5|$|Integrated {{circuits}} {{and printed}} circuit boards increasingly feature copper in place of aluminium because of its superior electrical conductivity; heat sinks and heat exchangers use copper because of its superior heat dissipation properties. Electromagnets, <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubes,</b> cathode ray tubes, and magnetrons in microwave ovens use copper, as do waveguides for microwave radiation.|$|E
50|$|A <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> {{is based}} on current {{conduction}} through a <b>vacuum</b> (see <b>Vacuum</b> <b>tube).</b>|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{study on}} the {{installation}} of a <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> in intake manifold {{has been done by}} observation at the effect of variations engine rotation and composition of bioethanol mixture with regard to fuel consumption and exhaust gas composition. This study used fuel E 20, E 30 and E 40, the type of <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> 4 Y 2 and Posh. Tests carried out on variations of the engine rotation 3000, 3500, 4000, 4500 and 5000 rpm. As result fuel consumption tends to increase as increasing engine rotation, it is more efficient with increasing ethanol in the fuel mixture and use a <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube,</b> the most efficient happened on fuel E 40 with the installation of a <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> type Posh in engine rotation 3000 rpm with consumption 0, 21 L/hour. CO exhaust gas tends to decrease with increasing engine rotation, the ethanol in the fuel mixture with the installation of a <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube,</b> the lowest occurred on fuel E 40 with installation a <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> type Posh in engine rotation 5000 rpm with emission 0, 06 %. CO 2 tends to increase with increasing engine rotation, the ethanol in the fuel mixture and the installation of a <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube,</b> the highest on fuel E 40 with a <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> type Posh in engine rotation 5000 rpm with emission 13, 60 %. HC tends to decrease with increasing engine rotation, the ethanol in the fuel mixture and the installation of a <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube,</b> the lowest occurred on fuel E 40 with a <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> type Posh in engine rotation 5000 rpm with emission 90 ppm...|$|R
5000|$|... 1966 MQ-36 <b>Vacuum</b> <b>Tube</b> OTL Power Amplifier. The MQ-36 is an OTL (Output Transformer-Less) <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> amplifier. It {{became a}} {{long-term}} seller for its high-quality sound.|$|R
5|$|Lamps in {{this case}} also show how some of these {{experimental}} bulbs progressed into <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubes</b> {{that were used in}} radios and TVs. Below are some of the incandescent electric lamps that were in this display case. These were numbered 530 to 871.|$|E
5|$|Neon {{is used in}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubes,</b> {{high-voltage}} indicators, lightning arresters, {{wave meter}} tubes, television tubes, and heliumâ€“neon lasers. Liquefied neon is commercially used as a cryogenic refrigerant in applications not requiring the lower temperature range attainable with more extreme liquid helium refrigeration.|$|E
5|$|But it was Bohr who {{electrified}} {{the audience}} with his news from Europe of the discovery by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch of nuclear fission. Physicists rushed to confirm the results. Creutz built an ionization chamber and a linear amplifier out of radio <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubes,</b> coffee cans and motorcycle batteries, and with this apparatus the physicists at Princeton were able to confirm the results.|$|E
50|$|Other {{components}} in <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> circuitry can be damaged by EMP. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> equipment was damaged in the 1962 testing. The solid state PRC-77 VHF manpackable 2-way radio survived extensive EMP testing. The earlier PRC-25, nearly identical {{except for a}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> final amplification stage, was tested in EMP simulators, but was not certified to remain fully functional.|$|R
50|$|Forbes {{reported}} {{the replacement of}} the string galvanometer with a <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> to amplify the EEG in 1920. The <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> became the de facto standard by 1936.|$|R
25|$|Most {{small signal}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> devices have been {{superseded}} by semiconductors, but some <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> electronic devices {{are still in}} common use. The magnetron {{is the type of}} tube used in all microwave ovens. In spite of the advancing state of the art in power semiconductor technology, the <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> still has reliability and cost advantages for high-frequency RF power generation.|$|R
5|$|The team {{received}} {{a number of}} Western Electric Type 316A large acorn <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubes</b> in early 1937. These were suitable for building transmitter units of about 20W continual power for wavelengths of 1 to 10m (300 to 30MHz). Percy Hibberd built a prototype transmitter with pulses {{of a few hundred}} watts and fitted it to the Heyford in March 1937.|$|E
5|$|Barium, as a {{metal or}} when alloyed with aluminium, {{is used to}} remove {{unwanted}} gases (gettering) from <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubes,</b> such as TV picture tubes. Barium is suitable for this purpose because of its low vapor pressure and reactivity towards oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water; it can even partly remove noble gases by dissolving them in the crystal lattice. This application is gradually disappearing due to the rising popularity of the tubeless LCD and plasma sets.|$|E
5|$|Because {{titanium}} is {{resistant to}} corrosion by sea water, {{it is used}} to make propeller shafts, rigging, and heat exchangers in desalination plants; heater-chillers for salt water aquariums, fishing line and leader, and divers' knives. Titanium is used in the housings and components of ocean-deployed surveillance and monitoring devices for science and the military. The former Soviet Union developed techniques for making submarines with hulls of titanium alloys forging titanium in huge <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubes.</b>|$|E
50|$|His work led toward {{development}} of X-rays and cathode ray tubes. The measurement of current in a <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> {{was an important}} step towards {{the creation of a}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> diode.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} days of electronics, <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> devices (such as radios) were powered by batteries. Each battery had a {{different}} designation depending on which <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> element it was associated with.|$|R
25|$|Before the {{development}} of silicon semiconductor rectifiers, <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> thermionic diodes and copper oxide- or selenium-based metal rectifier stacks were used. With the introduction of semiconductor electronics, <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> rectifiers became obsolete, except for some enthusiasts of <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> audio equipment. For power rectification from very low to very high current, semiconductor diodes of various types (junction diodes, Schottky diodes, etc.) are widely used.|$|R
5|$|Construction at the {{two sites}} started between 1962 and 1963 with {{improvements}} in the TsSO-P test model being fed back into the deployed units. They gained an M-4 2-M computer with semiconductors, although {{the rest of the}} radar used <b>Vacuum</b> <b>tubes.</b> The radar systems were completed in late 1966 with the fourth Dnestr at Balkhash being used for testing. In 1968 the Dnepropetrovsk Sputnik target satellite, DS-P1-Yu, was used to test the ability of the system.|$|E
5|$|Electrons are {{important}} in cathode ray tubes, which have been extensively used as display devices in laboratory instruments, computer monitors and television sets. In a photomultiplier tube, every photon striking the photocathode initiates an avalanche of electrons that produces a detectable current pulse. <b>Vacuum</b> <b>tubes</b> use the flow of electrons to manipulate electrical signals, and they {{played a critical role}} in the development of electronics technology. However, they have been largely supplanted by solid-state devices such as the transistor.|$|E
5|$|Higinbotham {{designed}} {{a game that}} used an oscilloscope to display {{the path of a}} simulated ball on a tennis court viewed from the side. The attached computer calculated the path of the ball and reversed its path when it hit the ground. The game also simulated the ball hitting the net if it did not achieve a high enough arc as well as changes in velocity due to drag from air resistance. Two aluminum controllers were attached to the computer, each consisting of a button and a knob. Pressing the button hit the ball, and turning a knob controlled the angle of the shot. Originally, Higinbotham considered having a second knob to control the velocity of the shot, but decided it would make the controller too complicated. The device was designed in a few hours with the help of colleague Dave Potter and was assembled over three weeks with the help of technician Robert V. Dvorak. While most of the circuitry was based on <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubes</b> and relays, the circuits to display the graphics on the oscilloscope used transistors, then beginning to replace <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubes</b> in the electronics industry. Excluding the oscilloscope and controller, the game's circuitry approximately took up the space of a microwave oven.|$|E
5000|$|The RCA BIZMAC was a <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> {{computer}} {{manufactured by}} RCA from 1956 to 1962. Although RCA was noted for their pioneering work in transistors, RCA {{decided to build}} a <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> computer instead of a transistorized computer. [...] It was the largest <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> computer of its time in 1956, occupying 20,000 square feet of floor space with up to 30,000 tubes, 70,000 diodes, and 35,000 magnetic cores.|$|R
5000|$|Negative {{transconductance}} oscillators, {{such as the}} {{transitron oscillator}} invented by Cleto Brunetti in 1939, are similar negative resistance <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> oscillator circuits {{which are based on}} negative transconductance (a fall in current through one grid electrode caused by an increase in voltage on a second grid) in a pentode or other multigrid <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube.</b> [...] These replaced the dynatron circuit and were employed in <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> electronic equipment through the 1970s.|$|R
5000|$|SCR-79 Radiotelegraph- (BC-25), {{transmitting}} and receiving; {{consists of}} an electrostatically coupled <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> oscillator circuit for transmitting, and a <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> detector and 2 stage amplifier for receiving; requires a low resistance antenna. wavelength is 500 to 1.100 meters ...|$|R
5|$|Other {{potential}} {{or current}} uses of rubidium include a working fluid in vapor turbines, as a getter in <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubes,</b> {{and as a}} photocell component. Rubidium is also used as an ingredient in special types of glass, {{in the production of}} superoxide by burning in oxygen, in the study of potassium ion channels in biology, and as the vapor in atomic magnetometers. In particular, 87Rb is used with other alkali metals in the development of spin-exchange relaxation-free (SERF) magnetometers.|$|E
5|$|Supplies and {{materials}} {{of all kinds}} poured in: 2,157 carloads of electrical equipment, 1,219 of heavy equipment, 5,389 of lumber, 1,407 of pipe and fittings, 1,188 of steel, 257 of valves, and 11 of welding electrodes. The racetracks required 85,000 <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubes.</b> Where possible, off-the-shelf components were used, but all too many components of the calutrons were unique. Two purchasing departments were established, one in Boston near Stone & Webster for facility equipment, and the other at Oak Ridge for construction supplies.|$|E
5|$|The T series, {{produced}} from 1968 to 1975, {{was the last}} of the tonewheel spinet organs. Unlike all the earlier Hammond organs, which used <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubes</b> for preamplification, amplification, percussion and chorus-vibrato control, the T series used all-solid-state, transistor circuitry, though, unlike the L-100, it did include the scanner-vibrato as seen on the B-3. Other than the T-100 series models, all other T-Series models included a built-in rotating Leslie speaker and some included an analog drum machine, while the T-500 also included a built-in cassette recorder. It {{was one of the last}} tonewheel Hammonds produced.|$|E
25|$|Application of {{electronic}} amplifiers to protective relays {{was described as}} early as 1928, using <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> amplifiers and continued up to 1956. Devices using electron tubes were studied but never applied as commercial products, because {{of the limitations of}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> amplifiers. A relatively large standby current is required to maintain the tube filament temperature; inconvenient high voltages are required for the circuits, and <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> amplifiers had difficulty with incorrect operation due to noise disturbances.|$|R
40|$|In Proton Driver Study II (PD 2), a new {{technique}} is proposed by Weiren Chou to manufacture the <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube.</b> Basically, this smaller metal <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> {{will be used to}} replace the ceramic <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube,</b> saving magnetic space. Therefore the required magnets can be made smaller, and the operation cost can be reduced. In this engineering note we investigate the structural strength and displacement of the tube, the magnetic field inside the tube and the power loss...|$|R
50|$|Cary Audio Design is {{a company}} founded in May 1989 which {{originally}} designed and manufactured <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> audio amplifiers. Since the mid-1990s they have expanded into the home theater market, producing DVD players and surround sound processors {{in addition to their}} original <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> designs.|$|R
5|$|The ideal {{solution}} was a proximity fuze inside an artillery shell, {{but there were}} numerous technical difficulties with this. The radar set {{had to be made}} small enough to fit inside a shell, and its glass <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubes</b> had to first withstand the 20,000 g force of being fired from a gun, and then 500 rotations per second in flight. A special Section T of NDRC was created, chaired by Tuve, with Parsons as special assistant to Bush and liaison between NDRC and BuOrd.|$|E
5|$|The {{solid-state}} device came {{into its own}} with {{the invention of the}} transistor in 1947. Common {{solid-state device}}s include transistors, microprocessor chips, and RAM. A specialized type of RAM called flash RAM is used in USB flash drives and more recently, solid-state drives to replace mechanically rotating magnetic disc hard disk drives. Solid state devices became prevalent in the 1950s and the 1960s, during the transition from <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubes</b> to semiconductor diodes, transistors, integrated circuit (IC) and the light-emitting diode (LED).|$|E
5|$|A small {{fraction}} of the zircon is converted to the metal, which finds various niche applications. Because of zirconium's excellent resistance to corrosion, it is often used as an alloying agent in materials that are exposed to aggressive environments, such as surgical appliances, light filaments, and watch cases. The high reactivity of zirconium with oxygen at high temperatures is exploited in some specialised applications such as explosive primers and as getters in <b>vacuum</b> <b>tubes.</b> The same property is (probably) the purpose of including Zr nano-particles as pyrophoric material in explosive weapons such as the BLU-97/B Combined Effects Bomb.|$|E
50|$|There was an {{optional}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> detector, type DT-3-A, {{available for the}} SCR-54. It used a VT-1 <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> powered by a BA-2 battery. The type number was originally SCR-55, later changed to DT-3, then DT-3-A. The crystal proved more popular in field use.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> memory : A Williams tube used a {{cathode ray}} tube, and a Selectron tube used a large <b>vacuum</b> <b>tube</b> to store information. These primary storage devices were {{short-lived}} in the market, since Williams tube was unreliable and the Selectron tube was expensive.|$|R
