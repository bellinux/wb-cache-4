5|$|In 1936, Maurice Brodie, a {{research}} assistant at New York University, attempted to produce a formaldehyde-killed polio vaccine from ground-up monkey spinal cords. His initial attempts were hampered by the difficulty of obtaining enough virus. Brodie first tested the vaccine on himself {{and several of his}} assistants. He then gave the vaccine to three thousand children. Many of these children developed allergic reactions, but none developed immunity to polio. Philadelphia pathologist John Kolmer also claimed to have developed a <b>vaccine</b> <b>that</b> same year, but it too produced no immunity and was blamed for causing cases of paralytic polio, nine of them fatal.|$|E
5|$|Investigations on neuroprotection {{are at the}} {{forefront}} of PD research. Several molecules have been proposed as potential treatments. However, none of them have been conclusively demonstrated to reduce degeneration. Agents currently under investigation include anti-apoptotics (omigapil, CEP-1347), antiglutamatergics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (selegiline, rasagiline), promitochondrials (coenzyme Q10, creatine), calcium channel blockers (isradipine) and growth factors (GDNF). Preclinical research also targets alpha-synuclein. A <b>vaccine</b> <b>that</b> primes the human immune system to destroy alpha-synuclein, PD01A (developed by Austrian company, Affiris), has entered clinical trials in humans.|$|E
5|$|Before Dorne fully succumbs to the disease, they do {{tests on}} him {{to figure out a}} cure. They {{determined}} that the only possible way to fight it would be to make a <b>vaccine</b> <b>that</b> uses the original source of the disease. While the origin of the virus is tracked back to being on Roak itself, it is from Asmodeus, the King of the Demon World, who had been killed 300 years prior to the spread of the disease. Ronyx talks the group into using a Time Gate on the Planey Styx to go back 300 years into the past to track down Asmodeus back when he was still alive. While this works, Ilia trips while approaching the gate. As such, Ilia and Roddick have a delay from when they enter the time gate, and after the trip through time, they find themselves separated from Ronyx and Millie. The two groups work towards locating each other, and Asmodeus, in efforts to heal their family members and stop the war.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Claire is {{reunited with}} Sherry and discovers that the mutated Birkin has {{implanted}} his daughter with an embryo to produce offspring. Leon, Ada, Claire and Sherry advance through an abandoned factory connected to Umbrella's secret underground research facility. An attack by Birkin leaves Ada heavily wounded, and Leon explores the laboratory {{to find something}} to treat her wounds. He is interrupted by a psychotic Annette, who explains to him that Ada's relationship with John was only a means of getting information about Umbrella: Ada is a spy sent to steal the G-virus for an unknown organization. Just as Annette is about to shoot Leon, the Tyrant appears, and she is forced to retreat. Ada returns to save Leon and battles the Tyrant – which falls into a pit of molten metal – seemingly at the cost of her own life. She confesses her love to Leon, who leaves behind her motionless body. Meanwhile, Annette tries to escape with another sample of the G-virus but is fatally wounded by her mutated husband. However, before she dies, she tells Claire how to create a <b>vaccine</b> <b>that</b> will stop the mutations caused by the embryo within Sherry. After preparing the cure, Leon and Claire reunite at an emergency escape train and inject Sherry with the vaccine, which saves her life. En route, Leon is assisted in terminating the now-mutated Tyrant by a woman in shadow, implying Ada's survival and escape with the G-virus in the pendant. Birkin– now mutated into a large agglomeration of flesh and teeth– follows the protagonists, but is destroyed when a self-destruct system causes the train to explode. After escaping from the city with Sherry, Leon intends to take down Umbrella, while Claire continues to search for her brother. Hunk, one of the special agents sent by Umbrella, is able to successfully complete his G-virus retrieval mission.|$|E
25|$|Because cVDPV2 strains {{continued}} to arise from trivalent oral <b>vaccine</b> <b>that</b> included attenuated WPV2, in April and May 2016 this vaccine {{was replaced with}} a bivalent version lacking WPV2 as well as trivalent injected inactivated <b>vaccine</b> <b>that</b> cannot lead to cVDPV cases.

25|$|A {{number of}} safe and {{effective}} oral vaccines for cholera are available. Dukoral, an orally administered, inactivated whole cell vaccine, has an overall efficacy of about 52% {{during the first year}} after being given and 62% in the second year, with minimal side effects. It is available in over 60 countries. However, it is not currently recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for most people traveling from the United States to endemic countries.

25|$|While annual or semi-annual mass antihelminthic {{administration}} {{is a critical}} aspect of any public health intervention, many have begun to realize how unsustainable it is due to aspects such as poverty, high rates of re-infection, and diminished efficacy of drugs with repeated use. Current research, therefore, {{has focused on the}} development of a <b>vaccine</b> <b>that</b> could be integrated into existing control programs. The goal of vaccine development is not necessarily to create a vaccine with sterilizing immunity or complete protection against immunity. A <b>vaccine</b> <b>that</b> reduces the likelihood of vaccinated individuals developing severe infections and thus reduced blood and nutrient levels could still {{have a significant impact on}} the high burden of disease throughout the world.|$|E
25|$|As of 2016 {{there is}} no commercially {{available}} <b>vaccine</b> <b>that</b> is effective for hantavirus. A vaccine known as Hantavax has been under study since 1990. As of 2016, the development is in clinical phase 3 trial stage. This inactivated vaccine is thought not to be effective against European hantaviruses like the Puumala (PUUV) virus. There is no FDA approved vaccine available and a killed-virus vaccine is not being pursued because of the dangers associated with mass production under high containment {{as well as the}} unresolved questions about the efficiency of the vaccine. However, a number of labs have been working towards a <b>vaccine</b> <b>that</b> would deliver viral antigens by either DNA vectors or as recombinant proteins.

50|$|A vaccine {{trial in}} 1960s using a formalin-inactivated vaccine (FI-RSV) {{increased}} disease severity {{in children who}} had been vaccinated. Recent studies show that the presence of two different glycoproteins, prefusion (pre-F) and postfusion (post-F), is responsible for this behavior. Only <b>vaccines</b> <b>that</b> target the prefusion glycoprotein type are capable to induce a protective immune response. <b>Vaccines</b> <b>that</b> stimulate the postfusion glycoprotein type, like the formalin-inactivated vaccine (FI-RSV), aggravate a RSV infection.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Recently, {{the promise}} of a new {{universal}} long-term flu vaccine has become more tangible than ever before. Such a vaccine would protect against very many seasonal and pandemic flu strains for many years, making annual vaccination unnecessary. However, due to complacency behavior, it remains unclear whether the introduction of such vaccines would maintain high and stable levels of vaccination coverage year after year. Findings To predict the impact of universal long-term flu vaccines on influenza epidemics we developed a mathematical model that linked human cognition and memory with the transmission dynamics of influenza. Our modeling shows <b>that</b> universal <b>vaccines</b> <b>that</b> provide short-term protection are likely to result in small frequent epidemics, whereas universal <b>vaccines</b> <b>that</b> provide long-term protection are likely to result in severe infrequent epidemics. Conclusions Influenza <b>vaccines</b> <b>that</b> provide short-term protection maintain risk awareness regarding influenza in the population and result in stable vaccination coverage. <b>Vaccines</b> <b>that</b> provide long-term protection could lead to substantial drops in vaccination coverage and should therefore include an annual epidemic risk awareness programs in order to minimize the risk of severe epidemics. </p...|$|R
25|$|Typically immunocontraception {{involves}} {{the administration of}} a <b>vaccine</b> <b>that</b> induces an adaptive immune response which causes an animal to become temporarily infertile.

However, experts in the field believe that major innovations are required before immunocontraception can become a practical form of contraception for human beings.|$|E
25|$|Hepatitis B {{vaccine is}} a <b>vaccine</b> <b>that</b> {{prevents}} hepatitis B. The first dose is recommended within 24 hours of birth with either {{two or three}} more doses given after that.

25|$|The dengue viruses produce many {{millions}} of infections annually due to transmission by a successful global mosquito vector. As mosquito control has failed, several dengue vaccines are in varying stages of development. CYD-TDV, sold under the trade name Dengvaxia, is a tetravalent chimeric <b>vaccine</b> <b>that</b> splices structural genes of the four dengue viruses onto a 17D yellow fever backbone.

40|$|AbstractNew {{interventions}} {{are needed to}} reduce morbidity and mortality associated with malaria, {{as well as to}} accelerate elimination and eventual eradication. Interventions that can break the cycle of parasite transmission, and prevent its reintroduction, will be of particular importance in achieving the eradication goal. In this regard, <b>vaccines</b> <b>that</b> interrupt malaria transmission (VIMT) have been highlighted as an important intervention, including transmission-blocking <b>vaccines</b> <b>that</b> prevent human-to-mosquito transmission by targeting the sexual, sporogonic, or mosquito stages of the parasite (SSM-VIMT). While the significant potential of this vaccine approach has been appreciated for decades, the development and licensure pathways for <b>vaccines</b> <b>that</b> target transmission and the incidence of infection, as opposed to prevention of clinical malaria disease, remain ill-defined. This article describes the progress made in critical areas since 2010, highlights key challenges that remain, and outlines important next steps to maximize the potential for SSM-VIMTs to contribute to the broader malaria elimination and eradication objectives...|$|R

25|$|Thiomersal's main use is as an {{antiseptic}} and antifungal agent, {{due to the}} oligodynamic effect.
