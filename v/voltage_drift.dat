5000|$|Basic RVDT {{construction}} and operation {{is provided by}} rotating an iron-core bearing supported within a housed stator assembly. The housing is passivated stainless steel. The stator consists of a primary excitation coil {{and a pair of}} secondary output coils.A fixed alternating current excitation is applied to the primary stator coil that is electromagnetically coupled to the secondary coils. This coupling is proportional to the angle of the input shaft. The output pair is structured so that one coil is in-phase with the excitation coil, and the second is 180° out-of-phase with the excitation coil.When the rotor is in a position that directs the available flux equally in both the in-phase and out-of-phase coils, the output voltages cancel and result in a zero value signal. This {{is referred to as the}} electrical zero position or E.Z. When the rotor shaft is displaced from E.Z., the resulting output signals have a magnitude and phase relationship proportional to the direction of rotation.Because RVDTs perform essentially like a transformer, excitation voltages changes will cause directly proportional changes to the output (transformation ratio). However, the voltage out to excitation voltage ratio will remain constant. Since most RVDT signal conditioning systems measure signal as a function of the transformation ratio (TR), excitation <b>voltage</b> <b>drift</b> beyond 7.5% typically has no effect on sensor accuracy and strict voltage regulation is not typically necessary.

40|$|Abstract—The {{threshold}} <b>voltage</b> <b>drifts</b> {{induced by}} neg-ative bias temperature instability (NBTI) and positive bias tem-perature instability (PBTI) weaken PFETs and high-k metal-gate NFETs, respectively. These long-term drifts degrade SRAM cell stability, margin, and performance, and {{may lead to}} functional failure {{over the life of}} usage. Meanwhile, the contact resistance of CMOS device increases sharply with technology scaling, espe-cially in SRAM cells with minimum size and/or sub-ground rule devices. The contact resistance, together with NBTI/PBTI, cumula-tively worsens the SRAM stability, and leads to severe SRAM per-formance degradation. Furthermore, most state-of-the-art SRAMs are designed with power-gating structures to reduce leakage cur-rents in Standby or Sleep mode. The power switches could suffer NBTI or PBTI degradation and have large contact resistances. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis on the impacts of NBTI and PBTI on power-gated SRAM arrays with high-k metal-gate devices and the combined effects with the contact resistance on SRAM cell stability, margin, and performance.

The receiver is also designed to be programmable to operate using single-stage differential detection instead of double-stage differential detection at low Doppler rates to obtain optimum performance. Furthermore, the baseband can be employed in ei-ther direct subsampling or intermediate frequency (IF) -sampling front ends.
