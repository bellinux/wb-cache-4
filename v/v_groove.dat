Resonances in ringlike cavities defined by grooves patterned into circular shape, determined using the boundary-element method, are in agreement with calculations based on dispersion for linear <b>V</b> <b>grooves.</b> Cavity quality factors are relatively insensitive to cavity geometry (Q= 10 - 50) while mode volume is very sensitive to small differences in the cavity shape. The smallest mode volume V= 0. 00073 λ 03 is found for a ring with a 10 -nm wide, 100 -nm deep groove with straight sidewalls and a diameter of 180 nm. Purcell factors well above 2000 are found in the energy range from E= 1. 0 - 1. 8 eV depending on cavity geometry.

A MEMS device of this type would consist {{of a pair of}} oppositely sloped alignment wedges attached to linear actuators that would translate the wedges in the plane of a substrate, causing an optical fiber in contact with the sloping wedge surfaces to undergo various displacements parallel and perpendicular to the plane. In making it possible to accurately align optical fibers individually during the packaging stages of fabrication of the affected devices, this MEMS device would also make it possible to relax tolerances in other stages of fabrication, thereby potentially reducing costs and increasing yields. In a typical system according to the proposal (see Figure 1), one or more pair(s) of alignment wedges would be positioned to create a <b>V</b> <b>groove</b> in which an optical fiber would rest.

Ten experienced golfers (mean ± SD; age, 23. 0 ± 0. 67 yr; playing experience, 13. 2 ± 1. 6 yr; handicap, 1. 6 ± 1. 4) were required to play a total of 120 shots inside a state of the art golf simulator with 3 clubs consisting of ‘old’ pre 2010 U-groove design and ‘new’ post 2010 V-groove design.

Backspin (RPM) and, as a measure of accuracy, distance landed from the pin (yds) were recorded. Compared to the U-grooves, the newer V-groove design imparted significantly less backspin from both the fairway and rough surfaces (P < 0. 05), additionally, shots with all clubs were consistently further away from the pin (P < 0. 05). The newer groove design does not enable players to impart as much backspin on the ball as they previously could and our data suggest that the recent change in golf club design might therefore reward driving accuracy...|$|R

The effectiveness of riblets in reducing the drag of a simple wo-dimensional configuration is fairly we 11 established now.

In a subsequent study Subaschandar et al., who extending the work of Sundaram etal to higher angles of attack (by using the same NACA 0012 model 13; and the same wind tunnel), it was observed that the drag reduction decreased rapidly beyond a = 6 deg with virtually no drag reduction a = 12 deg.

40|$|There {{has been}} a strong {{presumption}} that the rodent vibrissae are fine tactile feature detectors, sensing position, shape, and texture of objects. However, how rat vibrissae extract fine surface features, and their quantitative acuity during texture discrimination remain unknown. The goal of this thesis is to elucidate {{the functions of the}} rat vibrissa system during fine texture discrimination at the behavioral level. The first goal of this thesis is to detail training strategies developed specifically for rodent vibrissa-dependent texture discrimination tasks. In Behavioral Setup 1, rats were trained to discriminate smooth <b>vs.</b> <b>grooved</b> aluminum surfaces, and to palpate across a moderate gap for water reward. In Behavioral Setup 2, rats were trained to discriminate between sandpaper of two different roughnesses, presented across a gap. Results showed that rats could learn texture discrimination in 8 weeks (Setup 1) and 2 - 10 weeks (Setup 2) of training. The second goal of the thesis was to examine the relative functional roles of the micro/macrovibrissa system during texture discrimination. The specific roles of the two systems are not known. We tested whether macrovibrissae are sufficient for fine texture discrimination by removing the microvibrissae. Microvibrissa trimming did not decrease performance indicating that macrovibrissae alone can support texture discrimination. We also investigated the acuity of the vibrissa system in identifying texture differences. Sandpapers were varied to measure the psychophysical limit of texture discrimination. Though results were only obtained in one rat, these observations suggest that rats can discriminate sandpapers with finer resolution than previously know...|$|R

40|$|Patterned {{surfaces}} {{direct cell}} spatial dynamics, yielding cells oriented along the surface geometry, {{in a process}} known as contact guidance. The Rho family of GTPases controls the assembly of focal adhesions and cytoskeleton dynamics, but its role in modulating bone-cell alignment on patterned surfaces remains unknown. This article describes the interactions of two human cell types involved in osseointegration, specifically mesenchymal stem cells and osteoblasts, with submicron- or nano-scale Ti 6 Al 4 <b>V</b> <b>grooved</b> surfaces generated by mechanical abrasion. The surface chemistry of the alloy was not affected by grinding, ensuring that the differences found in cellular responses were exclusively due to changes in topography. Patterned surfaces supported cell growth and stimulated mesenchymal stem cell viability. Anisotropic surfaces promoted cell orientation and elongation along the grates. Both cell types oriented on nanometric surfaces with grooves of 150 nm depth and 2 μm width. The number of aligned cells increased by approximately 30 % on submicrometric grooves with sizes of about 1 μm depth and 10 μm width. Cells were treated with drugs that attenuate the activities of the GTPase RhoA and one of its downstream effectors, Rho-associated kinase (ROCK), and contact guidance of treated cells on the grooved surfaces was investigated. The data indicate that the RhoA/ROCK pathway is a key modulator of both mesenchymal stem cell and osteoblast orientation on nanometric surface features. RhoA and its effector participate in the alignment of mesenchymal stem cells on submicrometric grooves, but not of osteoblasts. These findings show that RhoA/ROCK signaling is involved in contact guidance of bone-related cells on metallic substrates, although to a varying extent depending on the specific cell type and the dimensions of the pattern. © 2010 Acta Materialia Inc.

40|$|Presented in {{this thesis}} are optical fiber Fabry-Perot (FP) sensors and side-polished fibers. By vacuum deposition, {{aluminum}} films are formed directly onto the single mode fibers to serve as mirrors. FP cavities with Al mirrors {{are used in the}} experimental investigations. Typical finesse is about 4. However, finesse as high as 14 has been achieved. The transfer functions and polarization characteristics of single-mode fiber FP cavities are studied. To use optical fiber FP cavities as temperature and stress sensors, ways must be found to discern the direction of the change of the optical path length. Such a scheme has been developed and demonstrated. Theoretical study also shows two polarization modes are supported by FP cavities containing birefringent fibers, and the retardation between two polarization modes is varied when the fiber is stressed laterally. Taking advantage of the stress dependent retardation, optical fiber polarimetric sensors without using analyzers are proposed and demonstrated. The theoretical results are confirmed with the experimental investigations. ^ The main objectives of side-polished fiber research are to develop techniques to form and to characterize low-loss side polished single mode fibers. Theoretical calculations show that the polished surface has to be within 12 to 2 μm of the core if significant interaction with the fields guided by a single-mode fiber is desired. The study also reveals that the polishing depth must be determined accurately to within fractions of a micron for most applications. Therefore, stringent dimensional control is necessary if the polishing is to be successful. In this thesis, a reliable technique of fabricating side-polished fibers is established. Single mode fibers are embedded in the <b>V</b> <b>grooves</b> of silicon wafers and polished with 0. 05 μm colloidal silica slurries.
