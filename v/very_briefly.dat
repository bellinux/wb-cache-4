5|$|Imelda Staunton voiced the Tall Flower Faces. Though {{there are}} many flowers that appear around Underland, {{only one of them}} speaks {{and one of them is}} clearly a {{caricature}} of Staunton. Staunton only speaks three lines that are heard <b>very</b> <b>briefly</b> at the beginning of the film.|$|E
5|$|The {{second round}} {{began with the}} two fighters exchanging a flurry of strikes. Silva then {{attempted}} a takedown {{with a combination of}} a body lock and a trip, but Jackson reversed it into a takedown of his own. The action stayed in Silva's guard <b>very</b> <b>briefly,</b> until the two scrambled back to their feet.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{some initial}} success, the {{expedition}} of Boleslaw to Kiev in 1018 failed to establish Svyatopolk Vladimirovich (Boleslaw's son-in-law), Prince of Turov, on the Kievan throne. The Polish ruler did at least gain the Red Ruthenia (Czerwien Grody) <b>very</b> <b>briefly,</b> {{though that was}} recovered for the Ruthenians by Grand Prince Yaroslav and Mstislav Vladimirovich, Prince of Chernigov, in 1031.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the track}} was <b>briefly</b> <b>very</b> popular, some critics claimed its two-step beat and characterless vocals made it banal.|$|R
40|$|This article aims to contribute, {{with some}} notes on {{practical}} issues, to more easily understand {{the focus group}} technique. As it is introductory, its plan is <b>very</b> simple, <b>briefly</b> addressing the definition and technique characteristics and some basic procedures for its use, the most frequently considered advantages and disadvantages, and finally some clues to the data analysis...|$|R
50|$|A small dog (Boston Terrier) {{who shares}} some of Sparky's {{political}} sympathies. Normally <b>very</b> mellow, he <b>briefly</b> became a radical when steroids {{were put into}} his food when he was intended to replace the then-Republican Sparky.|$|R
5|$|Moving east-southeast into {{southern}} Middlesex County, it continued producing severe winds (gusting up to 90mph; 145km/h) and very heavy rain. Another tornado touched down <b>very</b> <b>briefly</b> in Norfolk County, {{followed by two}} more brief touchdowns in Plymouth County near 5:30PM. The storm then weakened, but still managed to produce 60mph (95km/h) winds on Cape Cod, before finally moving out into the Atlantic and dissipating.|$|E
5|$|This {{homophonic}} choral {{passage is}} followed by the first of three short four-bar orchestral ritornellos, with a texture that has already been heard <b>very</b> <b>briefly</b> in the bar when the chorus pause between the fugato and homophonic passages. As in the opening sinfonia, the instruments play in four distinct groups—alto recorders, oboes, upper strings and continuo—but the sparseness there is now replaced by a jubilant canzona-style flourish.|$|E
5|$|Watson {{enrolled}} at the University of Washington and played baseball for the Huskies under head coach Tubby Graves. He played <b>very</b> <b>briefly</b> with the Seattle Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League, amassing one hit {{in a total of}} two at-bats. He often blamed his lack of success in professional baseball on his inability to hit a curveball. He graduated from the university in 1942 with a bachelor's degree in communications. After leaving baseball, Watson worked in the Seattle-Tacoma Shipyard during World War II.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{coverage}} by the popular Nintendo Power video game magazine, the game sold relatively few copies in North America {{and was not}} widely released. Conversely the game received several highly positive reviews in Europe and was <b>briefly</b> <b>very</b> popular.|$|R
6000|$|The dictee now commenced. My three belles {{interrupted}} me perpetually {{with little}} silly questions and uncalled-for remarks, {{to some of}} which I made no answer, and to others replied <b>very</b> quietly and <b>briefly.</b> [...] "Comment dit-on point et virgule en Anglais, monsieur?" ...|$|R
60|$|From {{the opening}} address {{it did not}} seem to Captain Tremayne as if this case--which had been hurriedly {{prepared}} by Major Swan, chiefly that same morning would amount to <b>very</b> much. <b>Briefly</b> the major announced his intention of establishing to the satisfaction of the court how, {{on the night of the}} 28th of May, the prisoner, in flagrant violation of an enactment in a general order of the 26th of that same month, had engaged in a duel with Count Jeronymo de Samoval, a peer of the realm of Portugal.|$|R
5|$|Cowes Castle, {{also known}} as West Cowes Castle, is a Device Fort in Cowes on the Isle of Wight. Originally built by Henry VIII in 1539 to protect England against the threat of {{invasion}} from France and the Holy Roman Empire, it comprised a circular bastion, flanking wings and a keep, and in 1547 it housed 17 pieces of artillery. With its companion fortification at East Cowes, the castle overlooked {{the entrance to the}} River Medina, an important anchorage. The invasion threat passed but the fortification continued in use until the middle of the 19th century, <b>very</b> <b>briefly</b> seeing action in 1642 during the English Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Daly {{returned}} to Fairfield {{after he was}} discharged from the Army and began a business career. He worked <b>very</b> <b>briefly</b> as a salesman for an oil company before starting his own manufacturer's representative business, Michael Daly & Associates, in the Southport neighborhood. He was also involved in the operations of St. Vincent's Medical Center in Bridgeport, serving on the hospital's board of directors for more than thirty years, {{as well as being}} a trustee and helping to obtain financial support for the hospital. A Democrat, he also supported the political careers of his brother, Judge T. F. Gilroy Daly, and friend, city politician John J. Sullivan, but dismissed suggestions to run for office himself.|$|E
5|$|Lennon {{started a}} skiffle {{group that was}} <b>very</b> <b>briefly</b> called the Blackjacks, but changed the name before any public performances. Some {{accounts}} credit Lennon with choosing the new name; other accounts credit his close friend Pete Shotton with suggesting the name. The Quarrymen played at parties, school dances, cinemas and amateur skiffle contests before Paul McCartney joined the band in October 1957. George Harrison joined the band in early 1958 at McCartney's recommendation, though Lennon initially resisted because he felt Harrison (still 14 {{when he was first}} introduced to Lennon) to be too young. Both McCartney and Harrison attended the Liverpool Institute.|$|E
5000|$|Though he and {{his family}} have never been <b>very</b> religious, Lennox <b>briefly</b> {{attended}} Boston University where he majored in religion because of his interest in [...] "the concept of God". While a student at the university, Lennox starred in three student short films: Fish Sticks and Fecal Matters, both directed by Andrew Drazek; and Appy Halloween, directed by Black Nasty.|$|R
5000|$|In principle, {{there are}} several {{equation}} systems {{that could be used}} to set up a system of electrical quantities and units.Since the late 19th century, the fundamental definitions of current units have been related to the definitions of mass, length and time units, using Ampère's force law. However, the precise way in which this has [...] "officially" [...] been done has changed many times, as measurement techniques and thinking on the topic developed.The overall history of the unit of electric current, and of the related question of how to define a set of equations for describing electromagnetic phenomena, is <b>very</b> complicated. <b>Briefly,</b> the basic reason why μ0 has the value it does is as follows.|$|R
5000|$|The term Process Music (in the minimalist sense) {{was coined}} by {{composer}} Steve Reich in his 1968 manifesto entitled [...] "Music as a Gradual Process" [...] {{in which he}} <b>very</b> carefully yet <b>briefly</b> described the entire concept including such definitions as phasing {{and the use of}} phrases in composing or creating this music, as well as his ideas as to its purpose and a brief history of his discovery of it.|$|R
5|$|Grissom {{has been}} noted and remembered in many film and {{television}} productions. Before he became widely known as an astronaut, the film Air Cadet (1951) starring Richard Long and Rock Hudson briefly featured Grissom early in the movie as a U.S. Air Force candidate for flight school at Randolph Field, San Antonio, Texas. Grissom was depicted by Fred Ward in the film The Right Stuff (1983) and (<b>very</b> <b>briefly)</b> in the film Apollo 13 (1995) by Steve Bernie. He was portrayed in the 1998 HBO miniseries From the Earth to the Moon (1998) by Mark Rolston. Actor Kevin McCorkle played Grissom in the third-season finale of the NBC television show American Dreams. Bryan Cranston played Grissom as a nervous variety-show guest in the film That Thing You Do! Actor Joel Johnstone portrays Gus Grissom in the 2015 ABC TV series The Astronaut Wives Club.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{following}} six years, the ships had fairly uneventful careers. Missouri {{spent most of}} the time out of active service, only recommissioning for summer training cruises with midshipmen from the US Naval Academy. In 1914, Ohio was sent to Mexican waters to protect American interests in the country during the Mexican Revolution. After the United States entered World War I by declaring war on Germany on 6 April 1917, all three ships were used to train naval recruits for the expanding wartime fleet. Following the German surrender in November 1918, Missouri was used to ferry American soldiers back from France, though the other two vessels were not so employed, since their short range and lack of sufficient accommodations would have made them inefficient transports. The three ships remained in active service only <b>very</b> <b>briefly</b> after the war. Ohio was decommissioned in January 1919 and Missouri and Maine followed in September 1919 and May 1920, respectively. All three ships were sold for scrap, with Maine and Missouri going to the breakers' yard in January 1922 and Ohio joining them in March 1923.|$|E
5|$|Casino Royale {{also takes}} {{credit for the}} {{greatest}} number of actors in a Bond film either to have appeared or to go on to appear {{in the rest of the}} Eon series – besides Ursula Andress in Dr. No, Vladek Sheybal appeared as Kronsteen in From Russia with Love, Burt Kwouk featured as Mr. Ling in Goldfinger and an unnamed SPECTRE operative in You Only Live Twice, Jeanne Roland plays a masseuse in You Only Live Twice, and Angela Scoular appeared as Ruby Bartlett in On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Jack Gwillim, who had a tiny role as a British army officer, played a Royal Navy officer in Thunderball. Caroline Munro, who can be seen <b>very</b> <b>briefly</b> as one of Dr Noah's gun-toting guards, received the role of Naomi in The Spy Who Loved Me. Milton Reid, who appears in a bit part as the temple guard, opening the door to Mata Bond's hall, played one of Dr. No's guards and Stromberg's underling, Sandor, in The Spy Who Loved Me. John Hollis, who plays the temple priest in Mata Bond's hall, went on to play the unnamed figure clearly intended to be Blofeld in the pre-credits sequence of For Your Eyes Only. John Wells, Q's assistant, appeared in For Your Eyes Only as Denis Thatcher. Hal Galili, who appears briefly as a US army officer at the auction, had earlier played gangster Jack Strap in Goldfinger.|$|E

40|$|Complex {{networks}} are ubiquitous in the world. Many phenomena in nature {{can be described}} by the complex networks, such as brain structures, protein-protein interaction networks, scientific citation networks, food web, social interactions, the Internet, and so on. The study of complex networks is a young and active area of scientific research inspired largely by the empirical investigations of many real-world complex networks such as computer networks and social networks. It is <b>very</b> necessary to <b>briefly</b> review the main advances in the analysis, control and applications of complex networks over the last decade...|$|R
5|$|Earp was {{a lifelong}} gambler {{and was always}} looking for a quick way to make money. After leaving Tombstone, Earp went to San Francisco, where he reunited with Josephine Earp. She became his common-law wife. They joined a gold rush to Eagle City, Idaho, where they owned mining {{interests}} and a saloon. They left there to race horses and open a saloon during a real estate boom in San Diego, California. Back in San Francisco, Wyatt raced horses again, but his reputation suffered irreparably when he refereed the Fitzsimmons–Sharkey boxing match and called a foul that led many to believe that he fixed the fight. They moved briefly to Yuma, Arizona, before joining the Nome Gold Rush in 1899. In partnership with Charlie Hoxie, they opened a two-story saloon called the Dexter and made an estimated $80,000 (about $2 million in 2017 dollars). Returning to the lower 48, they opened another saloon in Tonopah, Nevada, the site of a new gold find. Around 1911, Earp began working several mining claims in Vidal, California, retiring in the hot summers with Josephine to Los Angeles. Earp made friends among early Western actors in Hollywood and tried to get his story told. He was portrayed in film only once before he died, and <b>very</b> <b>briefly,</b> in the 1923 film Wild Bill Hickok.|$|E

50|$|Stars on 45 was a Dutch novelty pop {{act that}} was <b>briefly</b> <b>very</b> popular {{throughout}} Europe {{and in the}} United Kingdom, the United States, and Australia in 1981. The group later shortened its name to Stars On in the U.S., while in the U.K. and Ireland it was known as Starsound. The band, which consisted solely of studio session musicians {{under the direction of}} Jaap Eggermont, formerly of Golden Earring, popularized medley recordings made by recreating hit songs as faithfully as possible and joining them together with a common tempo and underlying drum track.|$|R
50|$|From Saint-Pierre-les-Becquets to its {{junction}} with Autoroute 20, it runs southeasterly (except from a brief northeastern-bound concurrency with Route 226) {{until it}} reaches the Bécancour River, which it follows West on its North shore until Lyster, where it shares a concurrency with Route 116. From there it turns northeasterly toward a concurrency with Route 271 in Sainte-Agathe-de-Lotbinière and its junction with Route 269 between Saint-Patrice-de-Beaurivage and Saint-Gilles, with both routes following the Beaurivage River downstream before separating at Saint-Gilles, where Route 218 crosses the river toward Saint-Lambert-de-Lauzon, where it crosses the Chaudière River. From there it goes to <b>very</b> join <b>briefly</b> the lengthy concurrency between Routes 273 and Route 175 before Route 273 separate, leaving the two others going Northeast to cross the Etchemin River in Saint-Henri-de-Lévis, where Route 175 goes Northwest while Route 218 goes Southeast for a 1 km concurrency with Route 277. Finally, it goes again northeasterly, roughly following the Boyer River toward Saint-Charles-de-Bellechasse and its terminus just south of Autoroute 20.|$|R
40|$|The polymerase-encoding {{region of}} the genomic RNA of the {{coronavirus}} infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) contains two <b>very</b> large, <b>briefly</b> overlapping open reading frames (ORF), F 1 and F 2, {{and it has been}} suggested on the basis of sequence analysis that expression of the downstream ORF, F 2, might be mediated through ribosomal frame-shifting. To examine this possibility a cDNA fragment containing the F 1 /F 2 overlap region was cloned within a marker gene and placed {{under the control of the}} bacteriophage SP 6 promoter in a recombinant plasmid. Messenger RNA transcribed from this plasmid, when translated in cell-free systems, specified the synthesis of polypeptides whose size was entirely consistent with the products predicted by an efficient ribosomal frame-shifting event within the overlap region. The nature of the products was confirmed by their reactivity with antisera raised against defined portions of the flanking marker gene. This is the first non-retroviral example of ribosomal frame-shifting in higher eukaryotes...|$|R

50|$|Piercers live in {{colonies of}} 10 or so {{individuals}} (though very {{deep in the}} earth, colonies of hundreds are said to exist). When attacking prey, they often fall down in unison, making the area <b>briefly</b> <b>very</b> dangerous. Piercers, though nonintelligent, are aware of others in their colony. Piercers can go for days without food, having a second stomach which slowly digests and stores reserves of fat. They are often hunted for the substances involved in this, {{as it can be}} used to preserve foodstuffs. Piercers can also be eaten, having a taste similar to that of snails.|$|R
40|$|We use the F-term {{dynamical}} supersymmetry breaking {{models with}} metastable vacua {{in order to}} uplift the vacuum energy in the KKLT moduli stabilization scenario. The main advantage compared to earlier proposals is the manifest supersymmetric treatment and the natural coexistence of a TeV gravitino mass with a zero cosmological constant.

50|$|All {{the tests}} in Project 58 were one-point safety tests. They were {{intended}} to freeze device designs prior to full-scale tests at Operation Hardtack I. No significant yield was expected from either, but the second, Coulomb-C, a surface test conducted on December 9, produced an unanticipated yield of 500 tons. Shortly after detonation, fallout readings of fifty roentgens per hour were recorded on the Mercury Highway, and, as the cloud moved toward the southwest, personnel at Jackass Flats involved in construction for future nuclear rocket testing were forced to take cover. Eventually, the cloud reached the Los Angeles area where <b>very</b> low readings <b>briefly</b> caused some public concern.|$|R
