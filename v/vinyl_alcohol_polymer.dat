A 25 -year-old {{woman with}} a past medical history significant for pulmonary coccidioidomycosis and poorly controlled type I diabetes mellitus presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of 4 days of progressively worsening shortness of breath and 3 - 4 days of intermittent hemoptysis. Initial CT scan demonstrated progressive tree-in-bud and ground glass opacities in the right upper and lower lung lobes suggesting worsening of her ongoing coccidiomycosis (Figure 1). On hospital day 3 she began to have worsening hypoxemia and hemoptysis requiring transfer to the intensive care unit. Interventional radiology was consulted who performed an emergent right sided bronchial artery embolization with the ethylene <b>vinyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>polymer,</b> Onyxtm. After embolization her chest radiographs demonstrated evidence of the embolization material in the pulmonary vasculature (Figure 2). Ethylene <b>vinyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>polymer,</b> Onyxtm is a liquid embolic substance which solidifies after contact with ionic materials (1).

Polymer film samples were irradiated in air {{at room temperature}} by an electron beam accelerator at different doses: 0, 100, 150 and 200 kGy. The microstructural and surface properties of the irradiated PVA films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Atomic force microscopy (AFM). An unirradiated PVA film was used as reference.

40|$|In {{this study}} it was aimed to produce nano fibers of poly <b>vinyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> PVA <b>polymer</b> via electrospinning ES method and to {{investigate}} the role of PVA concentration in the spinning dope on diameter, beads and HHS of produced fibers. Spinning dopes with different concentrations of PVA at rang of 5 to 20 % (wt/wt on weight of solution) prepared. The requisite voltage for ES (30 kv) was supplied by a DC {{high voltage power supply}} and for collecting the fibers a grounded aluminum foil target placed 17 cm below the tip of capillary tube (spinning nozzle). The results showed that spinning dopes with PVA concentration between 8 to 12 % (wt/wt) are capable of producing PVA fibers, but those below 8 % (wt/wt) concentrations because of low viscosity formed droplets known as electrospray effect. Electrospinning suppressed at spinning dope concentrations above 12 % (wt/wt) due to high viscosity of dope. According to the SEM photographs of electrospun PVA fibers it revealed that in higher concentrations produced nanofibers have larger diameter with less beads and HHS in compare with lower concentrations...|$|R
40|$|In this work, we {{developed}} a mixed matrix membrane by incorporating 20 – 40 µm size iminodiacetic acid modified immobeads within porous Ethylene <b>vinyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> (EVAL) <b>polymer</b> matrix. The MMM were charged with copper ions for selective adsorption of bovine hemoglobin in presence of bovine serum albumin. EVAL membrane without immobead and immobead alone showed low non-specific adsorption towards bovine hemoglobin and bovine serum albumin. Use of buffers with pH ¿ 6. 8 i. e. pI of bovine hemoglobin resulted in high bovine hemoglobin adsorption. The developed mixed matrix membrane has a maximum static adsorption capacity of 219. 5 mg bovine hemoglobin per g bead and the adsorption isotherm curve is of a Langmuir type. Under similar flow rates, the mixed matrix membrane showed significant low pressure drop compared to a packed bed column containing equal amount of beads. Maximum and faster (6 h) adsorption of bovine hemoglobin can be achieved through dynamic mode only using mixed matrix membrane and not by packed bed column and static mode of mixed matrix membrane. The mixed matrix membrane has three times selective adsorption of bovine hemoglobin than bovine serum albumin, from a binary mixture containing equivalent amounts of both protein...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} adsorption {{of copper}} (Cu 2 +) ions from aqueous solutions using mixed matrix membrane (MMM) and its elution afterwards. The developed flat sheet MMM, comprises of chitosan beads incorporated in Ethylene <b>vinyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> (EVAL) <b>polymer</b> porous matrix and exhibits static Cu 2 + ion adsorption capacity of 410. 5 mg Cu 2 + ions per g chitosan bead, which {{is higher than}} earlier studies reported on chitosan as adsorbent (beads, membranes and hydrogel). Dynamic adsorption of Cu 2 + ions from aqueous solution with MMM is similar to static adsorption but it is achieved much faster (15 min versus 60 min). Attempts to desorb Cu 2 + ions from chitosan beads in packed bed column resulted in bead aggregation, restriction of Cu 2 + ion desorption and reusability of the column. Under similar experimental conditions, Cu 2 + ions desorbed successfully from the MMM without loss of beads from the membrane structure and the MMM was reusable. Overall, the MMM developed in this study shows superiority over packed bed columns in terms of low pressure drop, high adsorption capacity, successful desorption of Cu 2 + ions and reusability for few cycles...|$|R

In all over the world,industry is forced by the regulation body to diminish down the heavy metal content to the acceptable level in their wastewaters effluents. In the current research,cation exchanger mixed matrix membrane (MMM) was developed for the lead (Pb) removal from wastewater. A list of commercial cation resin was screened for highest Pb removal.

40|$|International audienceThe normal {{diffusion}} {{regime of}} many {{small and medium-sized}} molecules occurs on a time scale that is too long to be studied by atomistic simulations. Coarse-grained (CG) molecular simulations allow to investigate length and time scales that are orders of magnitude larger compared to classical molecular dynamics simulations, hence providing a valuable approach to span time and length scales where normal diffusion occurs. Here we develop a novel multi-scale method for the prediction of diffusivity in polymer matrices which combines classical and CG molecular simulations. We applied an atomistic-based method in order to parameterize the CG MARTINI force field, providing an extension {{for the study of}} diffusion behavior of penetrant molecules in polymer matrices. As a case study, we found the parameters for benzene (as medium sized penetrant molecule whose diffusivity cannot be determined through atomistic models) and Poly (<b>vinyl</b> <b>alcohol)</b> (PVA) as <b>polymer</b> matrix. We validated our extended MARTINI force field determining the self diffusion coefficient of benzene (2. 27 · 10 [*]m[*]s) and the diffusion coefficient of benzene in PVA (0. 263 · 10 [*]m[*]s). The obtained diffusion coefficients are in remarkable agreement with experimental data (2. 20 · 10 [*]m[*]s and 0. 25 · 10 [*]m[*]s, respectively). We believe that this method can extend the application range of computational modeling, providing modeling tools to study the diffusion of larger molecules and complex polymeric materials...|$|R

By means of dead-end filtration the poly (<b>vinyl</b> <b>alcohol)</b> solution deposited {{on the surface}} and entered the pores of porous substrate and thus an even poly (<b>vinyl</b> <b>alcohol)</b> gel layer was formed on both the external and internal surface. The effects of poly (<b>vinyl</b> <b>alcohol)</b> concentration, dynamic coating lime, additive concentration, cross-linking agent concentration, curing time and support membrane on pure water flux and protein rejection of the resultant membranes were studied. Membrane morphology was characterized by SEM studies. The modified membranes were investigated in ultrafiltration experiments with pepsin to assess their resistance to fouling. The experimental results prove that modified membranes with an even poly (<b>vinyl</b> <b>alcohol)</b> hydrogel layer show dramatically high anti-fooling characteristics compared to inadequately modified and unmodified membranes. Moreover, it is possible that a series of dynamic membranes within broader molecular weight cut-off can be readily obtained by suitable control and combination of various preparative conditions.
