In this paper, we present {{the results of an}} experimental program carried out during 2016 in order to demonstrate the efficiency of the <b>vertical</b> <b>collimation</b> system and measure the wakefields induced by such a system. Furthermore, a comparison of the measurements of the collimation system wakefield impact with CST PS numerical simulations and analytical calculations is also presented...|$|E
30|$|X-ray {{experiments}} {{were performed to}} check {{the quality of the}} OPA coating procedure. These {{experiments were}} performed at HZG by applying the X-ray diffractometer XRD 3003 PTS (Seifert & Co, Germany) using a Cu tube (CuKα radiation, λ= 1.541 Å) and a Göbel mirror for <b>vertical</b> <b>collimation</b> onto the sample to increase intensity. The scattering plane lies here in the horizontal direction. The measured intensity of the scattered beam was corrected for small angles due to over-illumination effects by the so-called footprint correction (a detailed description of the footprint correction {{can be found in a}} previous study [28]).|$|E

40|$|A tilted fiber Bragg grating (TFBG) was {{integrated}} as the dispersive {{element in}} a high performance biomedical imaging system. The spectrum emitted by the 23 mm long active region of the fiber is projected through custom designed optics consisting of a cylindrical lens for <b>vertical</b> beam <b>collimation</b> and successively by an achromatic doublet onto a linear detector array. High resolution tomograms of biomedical samples were successfully acquired by the frequency domain OCT-system. Tomograms of ophthalmic and dermal samples obtained by the frequency domain OCT-system were obtained achieving 2. 84 μm axial and 10. 2 μm lateral resolution. The miniaturization reduces costs and {{has the potential to}} further extend the field of application for OCT-systems in biology, medicine and technology...|$|R
40|$|A compact, fiber-based {{spectrometer}} for {{biomedical application}} utilizing a tilted fiber Bragg grating (TFBG) as integrated dispersive element is demonstrated. Based on a 45 ° UV-written PS 750 TFBG a refractive spectrometer with 2. 06 radiant/μm dispersion and a numerical aperture of 0. 1 {{was set up}} and tested as integrated detector for an optical coherence tomography (OCT) system. Featuring a 23 mm long active region at the fiber the spectrum is projected via a cylindrical lens for <b>vertical</b> beam <b>collimation</b> and focused by an achromatic doublet onto the detector array. Covering 740 nm to 860 nm the spectrometer was optically connected to a broadband white light interferometer and a wide field scan head and electronically to an acquisition and control computer.

40|$|High {{resolution}} powder X-ray diffraction beam lines {{operate at}} many synchrotron radiation sources, exploiting {{the very high}} intensity, <b>vertical</b> <b>collimation</b> and wavelength tunability of the beam. At ESRF in Grenoble, a powder diffraction beam line has operated since May 1996. Originally built on the BM 16 bending magnet source [1], the diffractometer was transferred six years ago to a new location at ID 31, where it is powered by three 11 -mm minimum gap undulators, to give very intense beams in the operational range of 6 keV – 60 keV (wavelength ≈ 2 Å – 0. 2 Å). The diffractometer, shown in Figure 1, {{is equipped with a}} bank of post-sample analyser crystals, Figure 2, to give very high angular resolution as well as accuracy. An analyser crystal, rather than inferring the 2 θ angle of diffraction from the position of a slit or pixel on a PSD, defines a true angle of diffraction, and thereby removes a number of systematic aberrations in the peak positions that affect standard configurations...|$|E
40|$|Relativistically blurred {{reflection}} {{from the}} accretion disc provides a powerful probe {{of the extreme}} environments close to supermassive black holes; the inner regions of the accretion flow and the corona that produces the intense X-ray continuum. Techniques by which the geometry and extent of the corona can be measured through the observed X-ray spectrum are reviewed along with the evolution {{in the structure of}} the corona that is seen to accompany variations in the X-ray luminosity both on long and short timescales. Detailed analyses of the narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxies Markarian 335 and 1 H 0707 - 495, over observations with XMM-Newton as well as Suzaku and NuSTAR spanning nearly a decade reveal that increases in the X-ray luminosity coincide with an expansion of the corona to cover a larger area of the inner accretion disc. Underlying this long timescale variability lie more complex patterns of behaviour on short timescales. Flares in the X-ray emission during a low flux state of Mrk 335 observed in 2013 and 2014 are found to mark a reconfiguration of the corona while there is evidence that the flares were caused by a <b>vertical</b> <b>collimation</b> and ejection of coronal material, reminiscent of an aborted jet-launching event. Measurements of the corona and reflecting accretion disc are combined to infer the conditions on the inner disc that lead to the flaring event. Comment: 6 pages, 5 figures.

40|$|Monitoring of {{the narrow}} line Seyfert 1 galaxy Markarian 335 (Mrk 335) with the Swift {{satellite}} discovered an X-ray flare beginning 2014 August 29. At the peak, the 0. 5 - 5 keV count rate had increased from that in the low flux state {{by a factor of}} 10. A target of opportunity observation was triggered with NuSTAR, catching the decline of the flare on 2014 September 20. We present a joint analysis of Swift and NuSTAR observations to understand the cause of this flare. The X-ray spectrum shows an increase in directly observed continuum flux and the softening of the continuum spectrum to a photon index of 2. 49 (- 0. 07,+ 0. 08) compared to the previous low flux observations. The X-ray spectrum remains well-described by the relativistically blurred reflection of the continuum from the accretion disc whose emissivity profile suggests that it is illuminated by a compact X-ray source, extending at most 5. 2 rg over the disc. A very low reflection fraction of 0. 41 (- 0. 15,+ 0. 15) is measured, unexpected for such a compact corona. The X-ray flare is, hence, interpreted as arising from the <b>vertical</b> <b>collimation</b> and ejection of the X-ray emitting corona at a mildly relativistic velocity, causing the continuum emission to be beamed away from the disc. As the flare subsides, the base of this jet-like structure collapses into a compact X-ray source that provides the majority of the radiation that illuminates the disc while continuum emission is still detected from energetic particles further out, maintaining the low reflection fraction.

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} reduce the {{background}} that could limit the precision of the diagnostics located in the ATF 2 post-IP beamline, a single <b>vertical</b> beam halo <b>collimation</b> system was installed in March 2016. In this paper we present the measurements done in March and May 2016 in order to characterize the collimation system performance. Furthermore, the collimator wakefield impact has also been measured and compared with theoretical calculations and numerical simulations {{in order to determine the}} most efficient operation mode of the collimation system in terms of halo cleaning and negligible wakefield impact...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a novel USAXS camera that combines {{the use of}} synchrotron radiation with collimation by perfect-crystal optics. The outstanding result is that high measuring intensities and extreme angular resolution are achieved even with a point-focusing geometry. Along {{the principles of the}} original design (U. Bonse and M. Hart, Z. Phys. 189, 151 1966)) which had to be operated at an x-ray tube, we employ two sets of pairs of multiply reflecting channel-cut crystals diffracting in the horizontal and <b>vertical</b> planes. The <b>collimation</b> characteristics thus obtained are equivalent to the point-focusing geometry of conventional SAXS cameras based on slit collimation. We present results from samples of polystyrene spheres which were used for test measurements performed with synchrotron radiation of DORIS at HASYLAB/DESY in Hamburg. Taking into account the number of reflections within the channel-cut crystals, the theoretical resolution was calculated and found to agree well with that derived from measured scattering patterns. Structures as large as about 1. 3 μm could easily be identified from the scattering curves. As expected with point-focusing geometry, desmearing of raw data was unnecessary...|$|R
40|$|To {{address the}} need for high {{resolution}} detection systems {{to be used in}} portal monitors and mobile search systems, an integrated gamma ray spectrometer, incorporating a germanium detector with integral mechanical cooling, digital signal processing electronics, MCA, and communications has been developed. This modular subsystem {{can be used in a}} wide variety of applications, including use in stationary or mobile systems for the detection of radioactive materials. To have the sensitivity needed for these applications the detectors must have good low and medium energy detection efficiency coupled with excellent spectral peak resolution. The resolution removes peak overlaps and helps to overcome the problems of masking with common nuclides. In a situation where either the spectrometer or the material is moving, the Field of View (FOV) determines the time the material contributes to the spectrum. The absolute efficiency and background determine the minimum detectable or identifiable quantity for the material in the FOV. To characterize the expected performance in a general system, the absolute efficiency was measured for several units over the energy range of 80 keV to 1. 8 MeV. The horizontal FOV is limited by collimators and was measured for several distances corresponding to the ANSI N 42. 38 test criteria. The <b>vertical</b> FOV (no <b>collimation),</b> important to determine the detector spacing, was also measured. The background was measured in a typical pedestrian portal situation. The measurements presented show this unit can be applied to a wide variety of monitoring situations...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesTo {{determine}} {{radiation exposure}} {{for members of}} an endovascular surgery team during imaging procedures by varying technique. MethodsDigital subtraction angiography imaging of the abdomen and pelvis (Innova 4100; GE, Fairfield, Conn) was performed on cadavers, varying positioning and technique within the usual bounds of clinical practice. Radiation exposure was monitored in real-time with dosimeters (DoseAware; Philips, Andover, Mass) to simulate {{the position of the}} operator, assistant, and anesthesiologist. The DoseAware system reports radiation exposure in 1 -second intervals. Three to five consecutive data points were collected for each imaging configuration. ResultsOperator radiation exposure is minimized with detector-to-patient distance < 5 cm (2. 1 mSv/h) in contrast to 10 to 15 cm (2. 8 mSv/h); source-to-image distance of < 15 cm (2. 3 mSv/h) in contrast to 25 cm (3. 3 mSv/h). Increasing image magnification from 0 (2. 3 mSv/h) to 3 (0. 83 mSv/h) decreases operator exposure by 74 %. Increasing linear image collimation from 0 (2. 3 mSv/h) to 10 cm (0. 30 mSv/h) decreases operator exposure by 87 %. The anesthesiologist’s radiation exposure is 11 % to 49 % of the operator’s, greatest in the left anterior oblique (LAO) 90 degree projection. The assistant's radiation exposure is 23 % to 46 % of the operator’s. The highest exposure to the operator was noted to be in the LAO 90 degree projection (30. 3 mSv/h) and lowest exposure with 10 -cm <b>vertical</b> <b>collimation</b> (0. 28 mSv/h). ConclusionsVarying imaging techniques results in different radiation exposure to members of an endovascular surgery team. Knowledge of the variable intensity of radiation exposure may allow modification of the technique to minimize radiation exposure to the team while providing suitable imaging. Clinical RelevanceThe increased utility of endovascular procedures has exposed interventionalists to potentially high levels of occupational radiation. This study demonstrates that the magnitude and distribution of scatter radiation can be measured to the operator, assistant, and anesthesiologist under various fluoroscopic imaging conditions and techniques. Knowledge of the various angiographic parameters and their impact in scatter radiation levels can help operators utilize the dose reduction techniques and incorporate them in their routine practices...|$|E
