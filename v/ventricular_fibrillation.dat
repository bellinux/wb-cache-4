5|$|Deaths usually occur from {{respiratory}} failure or <b>ventricular</b> <b>fibrillation</b> secondary to ongoing seizure activity; fatalities have occurred {{within a few}} hours of ingestion. Poisoned people who recover usually regain consciousness and seizures cease within 24 to 48hours of poisoning, although seizures may persist for up to 96 hours. There are occasional long-term effects such as retrograde amnesia of the events leading to intoxication and the intoxication itself. Other ongoing mild effects may include restlessness, muscle weakness, twitching, and anxiety. Complete resolution of symptoms may take a number of days or, in some cases, these ongoing symptoms may persist for months after poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Abnormalities in {{the normal}} sinus rhythm of the heart can prevent the heart from {{effectively}} pumping blood, and are generally identified by ECG. These cardiac arrhythmias can cause an abnormal but regular heart rhythm, such as a rapid heart rate (tachycardia, classified as arising from above the ventricles or from the ventricles) or a slow heart rate (bradycardia); or may result in irregular rhythms. Tachycardia is generally defined as a heart rate faster than 100 beats per minute, and bradycardia as a heart rate slower than 60. Asystole is the cessation of heart rhythm. A random and varying rhythm is classified as atrial or <b>ventricular</b> <b>fibrillation</b> depending if the electrical activity originates in the atria or the ventricles. Abnormal conduction can cause a delay or unusual order of contraction of the heart muscle. This can {{be a result of}} a disease process, such as heart block, or congenital, such as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveSudden death {{occurs in}} as many as 8 % of {{patients}} after repair of tetralogy of Fallot and has been attributed to arrhythmias. The {{purpose of this study was}} to establish an animal model to evaluate the individual contribution of different physiologic sequelae after tetralogy of Fallot repair in the development of late-onset arrhythmias. MethodsForty-nine piglets were divided into 5 groups: (1) pulmonary artery band; (2) pulmonary valvotomy; (3) pulmonary artery band plus pulmonary valvotomy; (4) infundibular scar; and (5) age-matched control animals. Baseline and follow-up electrocardiograms were obtained and recorded, as well as changes in QRS duration. A total of 45 animals underwent hemodynamic evaluation and programmed electrical stimulation at 5. 6 months postoperatively. ResultsSustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias (<b>ventricular</b> tachycardia/ventricular <b>fibrillation)</b> were induced in 31. 1 %, and atrial arrhythmias were induced in 33. 3 %. The pulmonary valvotomy group was 30 times more likely to evidence arrhythmias than control animals for sustained <b>ventricular</b> tachycardia/ventricular <b>fibrillation,</b> as well as atrial arrhythmias (P =. 01). The pulmonary artery band group was 15 times more likely to evidence atrial arrhythmias than control animals (P =. 02). Prolonged QRS duration was predictive of inducibility of both atrial arrhythmias (P <. 01) and sustained <b>ventricular</b> tachycardia/ventricular <b>fibrillation</b> (P =. 01). Mean right atrial (P =. 01) and capillary wedge (P =. 01) pressures predicted atrial arrhythmia inducibility. Right ventricular end-diastolic pressure predicted atrial arrhythmia (P=. 01) and sustained <b>ventricular</b> tachycardia/ventricular <b>fibrillation</b> inducibility (P =. 05). Right ventricular systolic pressure did not predict inducibility of either atrial arrhythmias (P =. 10) or sustained <b>ventricular</b> tachycardia/ventricular <b>fibrillation</b> (P =. 94). ConclusionsChronic right ventricular volume overload resulted in an increased incidence of inducible ventricular and atrial arrhythmias...|$|R
25|$|<b>Ventricular</b> <b>fibrillation</b> most {{commonly}} occurs within diseased hearts, and, {{in the vast}} majority of cases, is a manifestation of underlying ischemic heart disease. <b>Ventricular</b> <b>fibrillation</b> is also seen in those with cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, and other heart pathologies. In addition, it is seen with electrolyte imbalance, overdoses of cardiotoxic drugs, and following near drowning or major trauma. It is also notable that <b>ventricular</b> <b>fibrillation</b> occurs where there is no discernible heart pathology or other evident cause, the so-called idiopathic <b>ventricular</b> <b>fibrillation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Idiopathic <b>ventricular</b> <b>fibrillation</b> {{occurs with}} a reputed {{incidence}} of approximately 1% {{of all cases}} of out-of-hospital arrest, as well as 3%-9% of the cases of <b>ventricular</b> <b>fibrillation</b> unrelated to myocardial infarction, and 14% of all <b>ventricular</b> <b>fibrillation</b> resuscitations in patients {{under the age of}} 40. It follows then that, {{on the basis of the}} fact that <b>ventricular</b> <b>fibrillation</b> itself is common, idiopathic <b>ventricular</b> <b>fibrillation</b> accounts for an appreciable mortality. Recently described syndromes such as the Brugada Syndrome may give clues to the underlying mechanism of ventricular arrhythmias. In the Brugada syndrome, changes may be found in the resting ECG with evidence of right bundle branch block (RBBB) and ST elevation in the chest leads V1-V3, with an underlying propensity to sudden cardiac death.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ventricular</b> <b>fibrillation</b> (V-fib or VF) is {{when the}} heart quivers instead of pumping due to disorganized {{electrical}} activity in the ventricles.

40|$|We {{report a}} 55 -year-old female patient who {{presented}} with no P waves {{but with a}} wide QRS complex escape rhythm at 44 beats/min and prolonged QTc of 0. 55 seconds on ECG. The patient had recurrence of <b>ventricular</b> <b>fibrillations</b> and loss of consciousness, and underwent defibrillation and cardiopul-monary resuscitation (CPR) several times because of cardiac arrest. The transthoracic echocardiography showed dilated cardiomyopathy and enlargement of both atria. The Doppler echocardiography documented the absence of A wave in the tricuspid and mitral valve flow. An electrophysiologic study demonstrated electrical inactivity in {{the right and left}} atria. Atrial pacing with maximum output did not capture the atria.

25|$|Spontaneous {{conversion}} of <b>ventricular</b> <b>fibrillation</b> {{to a more}} benign rhythm is rare in all but small animals.

25|$|Normally, the heart’s {{pacemaker}} {{regulates the}} contraction of the heart’s ventricles. <b>Ventricular</b> <b>fibrillation</b> and ventricular tachycardia occur {{when there are}} irregularities in the electrical signals from the pacemaker, causing the heart’s ventricles to contract abnormally and preventing blood from circulating throughout the body. <b>Ventricular</b> <b>fibrillation</b> and tachycardia can lead to sudden cardiac death if not treated immediately.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes devices {{resembling}} pacemakers, called implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) are implanted. These {{devices are}} often used {{in the treatment of}} patients at risk from sudden cardiac death. An ICD has the ability to treat many types of heart rhythm disturbances by means of pacing, cardioversion, or defibrillation. Some ICD devices can distinguish between <b>ventricular</b> <b>fibrillation</b> and ventricular tachycardia (VT), and may try to pace the heart faster than its intrinsic rate in the case of VT, to try to break the tachycardia before it progresses to <b>ventricular</b> <b>fibrillation.</b> This is known as fast-pacing, overdrive pacing, or anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP). ATP is only effective if the underlying rhythm is ventricular tachycardia, and is never effective if the rhythm is <b>ventricular</b> <b>fibrillation.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractTo {{study the}} role of silent {{ischemia}} and the arrhythmic substrate in the genesis of sudden cardiac death, 67 patients were studied (mean age 62 ± 12 years). Of these, 14 patients (Group 1) had an in-hospital episode of <b>ventricular</b> tachycardia or <b>fibrillation</b> while wearing a 24 h Holter ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitor, 33 (Group II) had a documented episode of sustained <b>ventricular</b> tachycardia or <b>fibrillation,</b> or both, and 20 (Group III) had angina pectoris but no <b>ventricular</b> tachycardia or <b>fibrillation.</b> Eight Group I survivors underwent programmed electrical stimulation or ECG signal averaging, or both. All Group II patients underwent 24 h Holter monitoring and ECG signal averaging to detect late potentials before programmed electrical stimulation. Group III patients underwent both 24 h Holter recording and coronary angiography. The 24 h ECG tapes were analyzed for ST segment changes, prematurity index and characteristics of ventricular premature depolarizations. Any ST depression ≥ 1 mm for > 30 s {{was considered to be}} a reflection of silent ischemia, and the induction of <b>ventricular</b> tachycardia or <b>fibrillation</b> by programmed electrical stimulation or the presence of late potentials, or both, was considered to be a reflection of the arrhythmia substrate. Silent ischemia preceded ventricular tachycardia in only 2 (14 %) of the 14 Group I patients. The prematurity index was < 1 in only 18 % of ventricular tachycardia episodes. However, 14 (64 %) of 22 episodes of ventricular tachycardia in 9 (64 %) of the 14 patients were initiated by a ventricular premature depolarization preceded by a short-long sequence (sinus beat-ventricular premature depolarization-sinus beat) with a ratio of 0. 5 ± 0. 1. Six (75 %) of eight in-hospital survivors of <b>ventricular</b> tachycardia or <b>fibrillation</b> (Group 1) had an arrhythmic substrate. A significantly (p < 0. 0001) higher percent of the 33 Group II patients had an arrhythmic substrate (93 %) than had silent ischemic episodes (45 %). Silent ischemia resulted in ventricular tachycardia in only 1 (7 %) of 15 Group II patients. There {{was no significant difference between}} the incidence of silent ischemia (45 % versus 35 %) and the extent of coronary artery disease between Groups II and III. It is concluded that: 1) Silent ischemia was not a major determinant of ventricular tachycardia. 2) Although silent ischemia was common in survivors of <b>ventricular</b> tachycardia or <b>fibrillation,</b> its incidence was not significantly different from that in patients with angina pectoris and no sustained ventricular arrhythmias. 3) A high percent of patients (75 % to 93 %) with <b>ventricular</b> tachycardia and <b>fibrillation</b> have an arrhythmic substrate. 4) In the absence of acute myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death is frequently triggered by a ventricular premature depolarization, with a preceding short-long cycle that likely produces dispersion of refractoriness in the arrhythmic substrate...|$|R

40|$|AbstractEighty-two {{patients}} with drug-resistant <b>ventricular</b> tachycardia or <b>fibrillation</b> {{were treated with}} oral tocainide. Treatment in 54 patients, all with inducible <b>ventricular</b> tachycardia or <b>fibrillation</b> at baseline electrophysiologic testing, {{was based on the}} results of invasive electrophysiologic testing. Twenty-eight additional {{patients with}} frequent spontaneous ventricular tachycardia or no inducible arrhythmia during electrophysiologic testing were treated on the basis of the findings of electrocardiographic (ECG) Holter monitoring. Tocainide was effective in 7 (13 %) and partially effective in 5 (8 %) of the 54 patients in the electrophysiologic study group and was effective in 17 (61 %) of the 28 patients in the ECG monitoring group. History of previous myocardial infarction and failure of response to lidocaine correlated with failure to respond to tocainide. Side effects were common both during initial therapy and during long-term treatment and necessitated discontinuation of tocainide therapy in 17 % of the patients. At a mean follow-up period of 14 months, 13 patients are still receiving tocainide and are arrhythmia-free. In conclusion, the usefulness of oral tocainide in the management of drug-refractory sustained <b>ventricular</b> tachycardia or <b>fibrillation</b> is limited because of its low effectiveness and frequent side effects...|$|R
40|$|Grass pea {{seedling}} histaminase (a copper-diamine oxidase) {{was found}} to exert a significant cardioprotection against post-ischaemic reperfusion damage. Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings from the rats subjected in vivo to ischaemia and reperfusion showed ventricular tachycardia (VT) and <b>ventricular</b> <b>fibrillations</b> (VF) occurring in 9 out of 12 untreated rats whereas no ventricular arrhythmias were found under histaminase (80 U/kg body weight) treatment (n = 16 rats). Computer-assisted morphometry of the ischaemic reperfused hearts stained with nitroblue tetrazolium showed the extension of damaged myocardium (area at risk and infarct size) significantly reduced in rats treated with histaminase, {{in comparison with the}} non-treated rats, whereas no protection was found with the semicarbazide inactivated histaminase. Biochemical markers of ischaemia-reperfusion myocardial tissue damage: malonyldialdehyde (MDA), tissue calcium concentration, myeloperoxidase (MPO), and apoptosis indicator caspase- 3 were significantly elevated in untreated post-ischaemic reperfused rats, but significantly reduced under histaminase protection. In conclusion, plant histaminase appears to protect hearts from ischaemia-reperfusion injury by more than one mechanism, essentially involving histamine oxidation, and possibly as reactive oxygen species scavenger, presenting good perspectives for a novel therapeutic approach in treatment of ischaemic heart pathology.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In dilated {{cardiomyopathy}} (DCM), {{the clinical}} and prognostic implications of rare variants in sarcomeric genes remain poorly understood. To address this question, we analyzed {{the outcome of}} rare sarcomeric gene variants in patients enrolled in our Familial Cardiomyopathy Registry. METHODS: DCM families harboring rare sarcomeric variants in MYH 6, MYH 7, MYBPC 3, TNNT 2, and TTN were identified. Genotype-phenotype association analysis was performed, and long-term survival-free from death or heart transplant was compared between carriers and noncarriers. RESULTS: We found 24 rare variants (3 in MYH 6, 3 in MYH 7, 3 in MYBPC 3, 2 in TNNT 2, and 13 in TTN) affecting 52 subjects in 25 families. The phenotypes of variant carriers were severe (3 sudden deaths, 6 heart failure deaths, 8 heart transplants, 2 <b>ventricular</b> <b>fibrillations).</b> There {{was no difference in}} the overall long-term survival between carriers and the 33 noncarriers (p = 0. 322).
