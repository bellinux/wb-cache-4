40|$|Voluminous {{volcanism}} characterized Early Tertiary continental break-up on the mid-Norwegian continental margin. The {{distribution of}} the associated extrusive rocks derived from seismic volcanostratigraphy and potential field data interpretation allows us to divide the Møre, Vøring and Lofoten–Vesterålen margins into five segments. The central Møre Margin and the northern Vøring Margin show combinations of <b>volcanic</b> seismic <b>facies</b> units that are characteristic for typical rifted volcanic margins. The Lofoten–Vesterålen Margin, the southern Vøring Margin and the area near the Jan Mayen Fracture Zone show <b>volcanic</b> seismic <b>facies</b> units {{that are related to}} small-volume, submarine volcanism. The distribution of subaerial and submarine deposits indicates variations of subsidence along the margin. Vertical movements on the mid-Norwegian margin were primarily controlled by the amount of magmatic crustal thickening, because both the amount of dynamic uplift by the Icelandic mantle plume and the amount of subsidence due to crustal stretching were fairly constant along the margin. Thus, subaerial deposits indicate a large amount of magmatic crustal thickening and an associated reduction in isostatic subsidence, whereas submarine deposits indicate little magmatic thickening and earlier subsidence. From the distribution of <b>volcanic</b> seismic <b>facies</b> units we infer two main reasons for the different amounts of crustal thickening: (1) a general northward decrease of magmatism due to increasing distance from the hot spot and (2) subdued volcanism near the Jan Mayen Fracture Zone as a result of lateral lithospheric heat transport and cooling of the magmatic source region. Furthermore, we interpret small lateral variations in the distribution of <b>volcanic</b> seismic <b>facies</b> units, such as two sets of Inner Seaward Dipping Reflectors on the central Vøring Margin, as indications of crustal fragmentation...|$|R

40|$|The {{deep ocean}} floor between the Clarion and Clipperton {{fracture}} zones (NE equatorial Pacific) has the highest known manganese nodule abundance in the world oceans. A detailed analysis of MR 1 (Mapping Researcher 1, 11 – 12 kHz) sonar images and free-fall grab data in the Korean manganese nodule field areas reveals a close relationship between side-scan sonar characteristics of the seafloor and manganese nodule abundance. Eight sonar facies are identified based on back-scattering intensity and distribution patterns. These sonar facies {{can be interpreted as}} (1) <b>volcanic</b> seamounts (<b>facies</b> I- 1), (2) bounding faults of abyssal hills (facies I- 2 and II- 1), (3) lava flows or volcanoclastic mass-flow deposits around the <b>volcanic</b> seamounts (<b>facies</b> I- 3 and II- 2), (4) crests of abyssal hills (facies II- 1), (5) abyssal troughs between abyssal hills (facies III- 1), (6) relatively flat areas (facies II- 3 and III- 2). In the areas where facies II- 1 (abyssal hill crests with thin sediment cover) and II- 3 (relatively flat areas draped by thin sediments) are dominant, manganese nodules occur abundantly. In contrast, zones comprising facies III- 1 (abyssal troughs with thick sediment cover) and III- 2 (relatively flat areas covered by thick sediments) are characterized by low abundance of manganese nodules. This relationship between distribution of sonar facies and manganese nodule abundance implies that (1) the qualitative difference in acoustic reflectivity of long-range sidescan sonar with some ground truth data is useful for regional assessment of manganese nodule occurrence over wide areas in a reasonable time, and (2) seafloor topography and sediment thickness are important controlling factors for regional occurrences of manganese nodules...|$|R

The submarine volcaniclastic apron is well exposed for over 30 km along the coast. The apron records the depositional history of a marine basin at bathyal water depths and the onset of fan progradation due to volcanism. The exceptional exposure, variation in fan architecture (distal, lobe, upper slope and channel), facies (e. g. sandstone, pumice breccias, conglomerates and pillow lavas) and origin (primary, resedimented or epiclastic), allows analysis of a facies model for submarine volcaniclastic fans.

This {{is home to}} the Port of Tauranga, New Zealands largest export port. Studies conducted following an initial study by Davis and Healy (1993) have found complex distributions of the sediments within the dredged shipping channel. This research used 86 vibracores and limited seismic data to identify four main facies within the shallow subsurface of the dredged channel and establish their distribution. Four facies were identified within the shallow subsurface: the <b>Volcanic</b> Sand <b>facies,</b> a silt to fine sand volcaniclastic succession; the Silt facies, a silt to very fine sand lacustrine deposit; the Coastal Sands facies, a medium to coarse coastal sand deposit; and the Pumiceous Sand Facies, a medium to coarse sand succession with abundant pumice. Within the dredged shipping channel, the Volcanic Sands and Silt facies outcrop at the surface, and appear as ridges in the subsurface. Draped over these ridges is the Coastal Sands facies, which in some cores is overlain by Pumiceous Sands. The <b>Volcanic</b> Sands <b>facies</b> represents a succession of tephra deposits, with some reworking between depositional events. In the Maunganui Roads region of the harbour this is overlain by the lacustrine Silt facies, formed from the reworking of the Volcanic Sands. The region was then inundated by the Holocene marine transgression, leading to the deposition of the Coastal Sands facies, sourced from offshore. This Coastal Sands facies is then overlain in areas by Pumiceous Sands, small mobile sand waves that exist within the shipping channel. These are formed following the erosion of ignimbrite cliffs around the harbour, with some input from the outside the harbour. This represents a change in source for sedimentation in the harbour. An updated model of the paleogeographic development of the harbour is presented, using data from this and other studies. This model shows the presence of a braided river flowing through Stella Passage, before the development of a lake and the subsequent Holocene marine transgression leading to the evolution of the sand spit and Matakana barrier island...|$|R

40|$|The Upper Devonian to Lower Carboniferous volcanosedimentary {{rocks of}} the Yarrol terrane of the {{northern}} New England Fold Belt have previously been ascribed to a forearc basin setting. New data presented here, however, suggest that the Yarrol terrane developed as a backarc basin during the Middle to early Late Devonian. Based on field studies, we recognise four regionally applicable strati graphic units: (i) a basal, ?Middle to Upper Devonian submarine mafic volcanic suite (Monal <b>volcanic</b> <b>facies</b> association); (ii) the lower Frasnian Lochenbar beds that locally unconformably overlie the Monal <b>volcanic</b> <b>facies</b> association: (iii) the Three Moon Conglomerate (Upper Devonian - Lower Carboniferous) : and (iv) the Lower Carboniferous Rockhampton Group characterised {{by the presence of}} oolitic limestone. Stratigraphic and compositional differences suggest the Monal <b>volcanic</b> <b>facies</b> association post-dates Middle Devonian silicic-dominated magmatism that was coeval with gold-copper mineralisation at Mt Morgan. The Lochenbar beds, Three Moon Conglomerate and Rockhampton Group represent a near-continuous sedimentary record of volcanism that changed in composition and style from mafic effusive (Late Devonian) to silicic explosive volcanism (Early Carboniferous). Palaeocurrent data from the Three Moon Conglomerate and Rockhampton Group indicate dispersal of sediment to the west and northwest, and are inconsistent with derivation from a volcanic-are source situated to the west (Connors-Auburn Arch). Geochemical data show that the Monal <b>volcanic</b> <b>facies</b> association ranges from tholeiitic subalkaline basalts to calc-alkaline basaltic andesite. Trace and rare-earth element abundances are distinctly MORE-like (e. g, light rare earth element depletion), with only moderate enrichment of the large-ion lithophile elements in some units, and negative Nb anomalies, suggesting a subduction-related signature. Basalts of the Monal <b>volcanic</b> <b>facies</b> association are best described as transitional between calc-alkali basalts and N-MORB. The elevated high field strength element contents (e. g. Zr, Y, Ti) are higher than modern island-are basalts, but comparable to basalts that floor modern backarc basins. This geochemical study, coupled with stratigraphic relationships, suggest that the eruption of backarc basin basalts followed widespread Middle Devonian, extension-related silicic magmatism (e. g. Retreat Batholith, Mt Morgan), and floored the Yarrol terrane. The Monal <b>volcanic</b> <b>facies</b> association thus shows similarities in its tectonic environment to the Lower Permian successions (e. g. Rookwood Volcanics) {{of the northern}} New England Fold Belt. These mafic volcanic sequences are interpreted to record two backarc basin-forming periods (Middle - Late Devonian and Late Carboniferous - Early Permian) during the Late Palaeozoic history of the New England Orogen. Silicic-dominated explosive volcanism, occurring extensively across the northern New England Fold Belt in the Early Carboniferous (Varrol terrane, Campwyn Volcanics, Drummond and Burdekin Basins), reflects another period of crustal melting and extension, most likely related to the opening of the Drummond Basin...|$|E

Our aims are: (1) to provide a means of determining proportions of different <b>volcanic</b> <b>facies</b> without detailed examination of borehole data or where borehole data are limited; (2) to explore the relationship between onshore and offshore observations. The facies classification scheme providing the framework for this research includes tabular-classic lava flows, compound-braided lava flows, hyaloclastites and intrusions. We show how this scheme can increase our knowledge of the offshore succession and can be useful in hydrocarbon exploration. In the Faroe Islands, three different basalt formations display a range of facies onshore. Boreholes have been drilled through these, and several kilometres' depth of log data collected. The proximity of these boreholes to onshore observations allows the identification of different facies within the wireline log data. This work demonstrates that histograms of P-wave velocities provide an efficient method of identifying the different facies, and we also explore why these distributions are so different.

40|$|The early Palaeozoic Macquarie Arc, southeastern Australia, hosts {{a variety}} of major late Ordovician to {{earliest}} Silurian subduction-related deposits (e. g., Cadia East, Ridgeway, Cadia Hill, Cowal and Northparkes). However, there is uncertainty about whether coeval highsulfidation epithermal deposits, which occur in intraoceanic metallogenic belts elsewhere in the West Pacific, (e. g., Lepanto and Chinkuashih), are also present in the Macquarie Arc. This has led to suggestions that their absence {{may be due to}} the poor preservation potential of deposits that form at relatively shallow crustal levels in ancient rocks. We present here an interpretation for evolution of the Peak Hill Au–Cu deposit based on the distribution of alteration facies, sulfur isotope data from several textural forms of pyrite and barite, and an assessment of the regional <b>volcanic</b> and sedimentary <b>facies</b> architecture. These data show that the Peak Hill deposit displays a distinct sub-vertical zoning with a pyrophyllite and vuggy-quartz core, that today extends about 350 m east–west and at least 550 m north–south, which grades out through paragonite+muscovite, kaolinite to a chlorite+ epidote alteration zone at the margin. The alteration zoning reflects both lower temperatures and neutralisation of acid fluids with increasing distance from the core, which represents the conduit along which hot acidic hydrothermal fluids were channelled. Several temporally overlapping events of silicification, bladed-quartz-pyrite veining, brecciation and pyrite veining occurred during the last stages of hydrothermal alteration, although most appear to predate mineralisation. Au–Cu mineralisation was associated with late quartz-pyrite-barite veins, and the highest gold grades occur mainly in microcrystalline-quartz-altered rocks in the paragonite+muscovite alteration zone, generally within 50 m outward from the boundary of the pyrophyllite and vuggy-quartz core. Sulfur- and leadisotope data, and the characteristic zoning of ore minerals and alteration assemblages support a magmatic source for the hydrothermal fluids. Similarities in many of the isotopic signatures between Peak Hill and deposits such as Northparkes support generation of the high-sulfidation mineralisation during the Late Ordovician to earliest Silurian (possibly ca. 440 Ma) metallogenic event. The Late Ordovician to Early Silurian <b>volcanic</b> and sedimentary <b>facies</b> associations at Peak Hill are consistent with alteration and mineralisation occurring in rocks deposited in a submarine setting...|$|R

40|$|A {{mid to late}} Miocene {{volcanic}} {{sequence is}} well exposed along {{the west coast of}} the Northland Peninsula, New Zealand. The Waitakere Group are uplifted submarine apron deposits from offshore arc stratovolcanoes, and outcrop from Kaipara in the north, to Manukau Harbour in the south. The submarine coherent and clastic succession at Muriwai (the Muriwai volcanic succession) is well preserved and records the medial depositional environment of a volcaniclastic apron from one or more submarine to emergent stratovolcanoes. Several major Miocene volcanic centres have been identified offshore from Northland. The present location of Muriwai is closest to the Manukau (WSW) and Kaipara (NE) centres. The stratigraphy is dominated by resedimented volcaniclastics, thinly bedded fme sandstone, coherent lava and pyroclastic fallout. Six lithofacies groups were identified in the Muriwai volcanic succession, and each represents various transport and deposition process. Basal thinly bedded fine sandstone represents slow background sedimentation, prior to the onset of extensive eruptive activity. Scoriaceous and pumiceous <b>facies,</b> <b>volcanic</b> conglomerate <b>facies</b> and coarse granule sandstone facies record resedimentation of more proximal volcaniclastic deposits. Thin pumice and crystal rich facies record water-settled fallout from explosive eruptions. Coherent facies probably represent satellite vent eruptions on the volcano flanks. In general, the facies document rapid submarine deposition in the closing stages of the eruptive history of the source volcano(es). Transport and deposition of the pumice and scoria, conglomerates and granule sands was dominated by water-supported sediment gravity flows. Rounded to subangular volcanic clasts are a significant component of these deposits, which suggests they were sourced from existing deposits that became remobilised on the upper flanks of a volcanic edifice. Uncommon allochthonous pebbles suggest this depositional environment also incorporated a component of non-volcanic sediments, derived from the Northland Allochthon to the north. Pumice and scoria clasts record significant explosive eruptions, whereas coherent bodies and lava clasts record effusive eruptive activity. Bulk rock geochemistry defines the volcanic succession as a medium-K, calc-alkaline suite, a characteristic product of arc volcanism. Lavas and volcanic clasts have a compositional range from basalt to andesite. Representative sampling suggests each clast type corresponds to a distinct bulk rock composition. Lavas are basalt to basaltic andesite, pumice are basaltic andesite, and scoria and hyaloclastite are andesitic. The chemical variations suggest multiple eruptive events and varying degrees of fractionation. Many pumice clasts are compositionally banded, suggesting magma mingling and complexities in the magma chambers of the source stratovolcanoes. Stratigraphic relationships, facies types and comparison with other arc stratovolcanoes suggests that the bathymetry surrounding the source volcanoes once consisted of a series of radial erosional submarine canyons, separated by depositional highs. Towards the final stages of volcanism, mass wasting and edifice degradation disrupted background sedimentation in the marine basin. Resedimentation processes lead to the extension of a volcaniclastic apron, which in-filled submarine canyons at medial distances from the source volcano. The facies within the Muriwai volcanic succession form a thick canyon filling sequence and represents part of a clastic apron that formed in the basin adjacent to one or several volcanic centres...|$|R

The massive sulfide ore deposits {{occur in a}} felsic volcanic and sedimentary succession (VS Complex) of late Famennian (Upper Devonian) to late Visean (Middle Carboniferous) age. <b>Volcanic</b> <b>facies</b> analysis {{has been carried out}} on three areas in Portugal, including the Neves Corvo mine, and five sections in Spain. In all sections studied, the depositional setting during accumulation of the VS Complex was submarine and below wave base. The principal felsic <b>volcanic</b> <b>facies</b> are: (1) coherent rhyolite and dacite, associated with monomictic breccia; (2) fiamme-rich breccia (with variable amounts of dense volcanic and sedimentary clasts), fiamme-rich sandstone and fiamme-bearing mudstone; and (3) crystal-rich sandstone and mudstone. Mafic units are minor, dominated by coherent facies and have uncertain mode of emplacement (intrusions or lavas). Fiamme typically have lenticular shape and quartz- or quartz- and feldspar-phyric texture, and are interpreted to be altered and compacted pumice clasts. The <b>volcanic</b> <b>facies</b> are typically interleaved with, and regionally less voluminous than, the non-volcanic facies, which are dominated by mudstone. The felsic <b>volcanic</b> <b>facies</b> are interpreted to be the products of numerous, relatively small intrabasinal volcanic centres that generated abundant lavas, domes and pyroclastic units. Some volcanic centres are dominated by lavas, whereas others have similar proportions of lavas and pyroclastic units. The domes and lavas are more voluminous but less laterally extensive than the pyroclastic units. A sediment-matrix breccia typically occurs at the top contact of the felsic lavas with sedimentary units. This sediment-matrix breccia formed from the infiltration of fine sediment into interclast spaces in previously formed hyaloclastite, and could be misinterpreted as peperite. Felsic intrusions are less voluminous than lavas, and were emplaced as cryptodomes and partly extrusive cryptodomes, late {{in the evolution of the}} VS Complex. The architecture of the different study areas reflects differences in the eruption style, emplacement processes and proximity to source. Parts of the succession interpreted to be proximal are dominated by thick lavas/domes and intrusions, and coarse pyroclastic deposits. Medial parts comprise resedimented autoclastic facies derived from the lavas and domes, and relatively thin pyroclastic units. Distal parts comprise relatively thinly bedded crystal-rich sandstone and siliceous mudstone.

All these studies are at an early stage of development and represent MSc and PhD research by three students, supported by Bruce Gemmell, Rod Allen and Jocelyn McPhie. GEOCHEMICAL DATABASE FOR MRV The MRV database is partially completed, and a pre 1 iminary assessment of the primary geochemistry and alteration geochemistry are presented. A series of alteration vectors are presented and discussed, however, considerably more research is required to refine these vectors by including the regional traverses and ore deposit case studies into the database.

40|$|International audienceHaiti, {{located at}} the {{northern}} Caribbean plate boundary, records a geological history of terrane accretion from Cretaceous island arc formations to the Eocene to Recent oblique collision with the Bahamas platform. Little is presently known about the underlying crustal structure of the island. We analyze P-waveforms arriving at 27 temporary broadband seismic stations deployed over a distance of 200 km across the major terrane boundaries in Haiti to determine the crustal structure of western Hispaniola. We compute teleseismic receiver functions using the Extended-Time Multi-Taper method and determine crustal thickness and bulk composition (Vp/Vs) using the H-к stacking method. Three distinctive and fault-bounded crustal domains, defined by their characteristic Moho depth distributions and bulk crustal Vp/Vs, are imaged across Haiti. We relate these domains to three crustal terranes that have been accreted along the plate boundary during the northeastwards displacement of the Caribbean plate and are presently being deformed in a localized fold and thrust belt. In the northern domain, made up of <b>volcanic</b> arc <b>facies,</b> the crust has a thickness of ~ 23 km and Vp/Vs of 1. 75 ± 0. 1 typical of average continental crust. The crust in the southern domain {{is part of the}} Caribbean Large Igneous Province (Caribbean LIP), and is ~ 22 km thick with Vp/Vs of 1. 80 ± 0. 03 consistent with plume-related rocks of late Cretaceous age. Significantly thicker, the crust in central Haiti has values of Moho depths averaging ~ 41 km and with Vp/Vs of 1. 80 ± 0. 05. We propose that the central domain is likely constructed of an island arc upper crust with fragments of dense material originating from mafic lavas or LIP material. We produce a crustal profile along a N-S transect across Haiti accounting for the surface geology, shallow structural history, and new seismological constraints provided by variations of crustal thickness and bulk composition...|$|R
40|$|The sea-floor sediments of the Far North Section of the Great Barrier Reef Lagoon {{have been}} {{investigated}} by seismic traverse, and by detailed analysis of surface grab-samples and short (3 - 5 m) cores. Sample collection was along three transects; two from coast to reef, the third parallel to and near the shore from Cape York to Weymouth Bay. In total, 195 samples {{have been investigated}}, using binocular microscopy, size analysis, X-ray diffraction, bulk and trace geochemistry, scanning electron microscopy and electron microprobe analysis. The seismic data reveal an erosional unconformity ranging from at the sea bed to 12 m below the sediment surface, interpreted as the Holocene-Pleistocene unconformity, resulting from lowering of sea-level during the Pleistocene. Marine transgression since the last glacial maximum has allowed the deposition of terrigenous and marine sediment across the Lagoon. The sediment character differs {{above and below the}} unconformity. Above, the sediments are seismically transparent, dominated by Halimeda bioherms, whereas those below are almost seismically opaque, non-marine sediments. Areas of the lagoon north of Raine Island are devoid of Halimeda because of poor nutrient supply. From the reef to shore, the Halimeda bioherms decrease in thickness and character, forming thick mounds in the east, but becoming flatter and thinner westward, and eventually disappearing toward the inner shelf. The land bordering this section of the GBR Lagoon provides a narrow catchment between the Great Dividing Range and the coast. The area is subdued, erosion is minor, and both sediment and fresh water inputs to the lagoon are low. The source rocks for sedimentation into the Lagoon include quartzose sand dunes, lateritic regolith, Jurassic sediments and <b>volcanics.</b> <b>Facies</b> analysis shows the near shore inner shelf sediments are dominantly terrigenous, made up of quartz and clays with minor carbonate. Their detailed composition closely reflects the local sources. The clays include both kaolinite and smectite, derived from different sources; the kaolinite from the lower, more deeply weathered parts of the landscape, and smectite from the less mature high-lands and coastal volcanics. Sediments of the mangrove swamps are more clay-rich than others, and show the effects of post-depositional change as a result of changing physico-chemical conditions (redox). These changes include quartz grain fragmentation, growth of pyrite framboids, precipitation of secondary magnesian calcite and the conversion of kaolinite to smectite. Geochemical analysis allowed four factors to be developed from which a classification of the sediments of the lagoon was erected: Factor 1 : samples dominated by terrigenous sediment, Ga, Zn, Ni, Mn, Cr, Ti, Ba, Rb, Y, Nb, Al, NaO, SiO₂, K₂O and V. Factor 2 : carbonate factor: Ca, Mg, Sr, P₂O₂, Pb, Cr, Ni and Zn. Factor 3 : transition elements Ti, Fe, Ga, Mn, V, As,Y and Nb. Factor 4 : S and Fe These factors, plus the mineralogy, were used to establish sedimentary facies for the area and to map their distribution. Facies analysis delineate five facies: Facies 1 : Near shore terrigenous sandy mud facies, characteristic of swamp and mangrove intertidal zones. Facies 2 : Inner shelf shore sand, consisting largely of coastal dune sand. Facies 3 : Shelly beach sand, derived from both Pleistocene and Holocene beach ridges, mostly found in Newcastle Bay. Facies 4 : Halimeda generated carbonate Facies, occupying the mid-outer shelf. Facies 5 : Pure carbonate coral reef Facies, characteristically occurring in the outer shelf and parts of the middle shelf. Beyond the terrigenous dominated near shore region, carbonate sediments gradually increase in proportion, becoming very dominant as Halimeda and coralline algae Facies toward the outer shelf. The Halimeda Facies is shown by increased aragonite and higher Fe and Sr values. Coralline algae Facies has higher Mg-calcite. The distribution of these facies results from variations in nutrient supply for the Halimeda, and position relative to the reef itself and to the shore...|$|R

The sedimentary rocks are represented by six lithofacies grouped in three facies associations. They were deposited by mantled and gravitational flows modified by high-energy fluvial currents that evolved to low-energy fluvial and lacustrine environments. They constitute the Conglomerado del Río Blanco, which cover unconformably marine Carboniferous sequences. Five <b>volcanic</b> and volcaniclastic <b>facies</b> make up the beginning of volcanic activity. The first volcanic event in the Portezuelo del Cenizo is basaltic to andesitic lava-flows emplaced in the flanks of volcanoes. Lava collapse produced thick block and ash flows. Interbedding in the intermediate volcanic rocks, there are dacites of different geochemical signature, which indicate that the development of acidic volcanism was coetaneous with the first volcanic activity. The geochemistry of these rocks induces to consider that the Choiyoi Group Lower section belongs to a magmatic arc on continental crust. The age of this section is assigned to the lower Permian (277  ±  3. 0 Ma, Kungurian age) ...|$|R
40|$|An {{overview}} {{of the distribution of}} <b>volcanic</b> <b>facies</b> units was compiled over the North Atlantic region. The new maps establish the pattern of volcanism associated with breakup and the initiation of seafloor spreading over {{the main part of the}} North Atlantic Igneous Province (NAIP). The maps include new analysis of the Faroe–Shetlands region that allows for a consistent <b>volcanic</b> <b>facies</b> map to be constructed over the entire eastern margin of the North Atlantic for the first time. A key result is that the various conjugate margin segments show a number of asymmetric patterns that are interpreted to result in part from pre-existing crustal and lithospheric structures. The compilation further shows that while the lateral extent of volcanism extends equally far to the south of the Iceland hot spot as it does to the north, the volume of material emplaced to the south is nearly double of that to the north. This suggests that a possible southward deflection of the Iceland mantle plume is a long-lived phenomenon originating during or shortly after impact of the plume...|$|E

40|$|The late Miocene Farallon Negro volcanics, {{comprising}} basaltic to rhyodacitic volcano-sedimentary rocks, {{host the}} Bajo de la Alumbrera porphyry copper-gold deposit in northwest Argentina. Early {{studies of the}} geology of the district have underpinned the general model for porphyry ore deposits where hydrothermal alteration and mineralization develop in and around porphyritic intrusions emplaced at shallow depths (2. 5 - 3. 5 km) into stratovolcanic assemblages. The Farallon Negro succession is dominated by thick sequences of volcanosedimentary breccias, with lavas forming a minor component volumetrically. These volcaniclastic rocks conformably overlie crystalline basement-derived sedimentary rocks deposited in a developing foreland basin southeast of the Puna-Altiplano plateau. Within the FarallÃƒÂ³n Negro volcanics, volcanogenic accumulations evolved from early mafic to intermediate and silicic compositions. The younger and more silicic rocks are demonstrably coeval and comagmatic with the earliest group of mineralized porphyritic intrusions at Bajo de la Alumbrera. Our analysis of the <b>volcanic</b> stratigraphy and <b>facies</b> architecture of the Farallon Negro volcanics indicates that volcanic eruptions evolved from effusive to mixed effusive and explosive styles, as magma compositions changed to more intermediate and silicic compositions. An early phase of mafic to intermediate volcanism was characterized by small synsedimentary intrusions with peperitic contacts, and lesser lava units scattered widely throughout the district, and interbedded with thick and extensive successions of coarse-grained sedimentary breccias. These sedimentary breccias formed from numerous debris- and hyperconcentrated flow events. A later phase of silicic volcanism included both effusive eruptions, forming several areally restricted lavas, and explosive eruptions, producing more widely dispersed (up to 5 km) tuff units, some up to 30 -m thickness in proximal sections. Four key features of the volcanic stratigraphy suggest that the Farallon Negro volcanics need not simply record {{the construction of a}} large steep-sided polygenetic stratovolcano: (1) sheetlike, laterally continuous debris-flow and other coarse-grained sedimentary deposits are dominant, particularly in the lower sections; (2) mafic-intermediate composition lavas are volumetrically minor; (3) peperites are present throughout the sequence; and (4) fine-grained lacustrine sandstone-siltstone sequences occur in areas previously thought to be proximal to the summit region of the stratovolcano. Instead, the nature, distribution, and geometry of <b>volcanic</b> and volcaniclastic <b>facies</b> suggest that volcanism occurred as a relatively low relief, multiple-vent volcanic complex at the eastern edge of a broad, > 200 -km-wide late Miocene volcanic belt and on an active foreland sedimentary basin to the Puna-Altiplano. Volcanism that occurred synchronously with the earliest stages of porphyry- related mineralization at Bajo de la Alumbrera apparently developed in an alluvial to ring plain setting that was distal to larger volcanic edifices...|$|R

40|$|The Kohistan arc in {{the northwestern}} Himalayas records a dual history of intra-oceanic and {{continental}} subduction and represents a juvenile addition to the continental crust. Within western Kohistan, the roof-zone of the Kohistan batholith has a complex tectonomagmatic history that reflects fluctuations in the mechanisms of subduction. Five separate magmatic episodes are identified and although being temporally, spatially and morphologically distinct, each retains similar subduction-related chemical and petrological characteristics. Two calc-alkaline intrusive suites, each consisting of nested gabbroic-granitic plutons represent high level intrusions emplaced by predominantly brittle fracture mechanisms. The earliest, Stage 1, date from ca. 78 - 75 Ma and intrude into a variably deformed and metamorphosed island-arc forearc succession (Kalam Group). Unconformably overlying the earlier suite, but intruded by the Stage 2 suite (ca. 48 - 45 Ma) are the dismembered remnants of a subaerial volcanic arc (ca. 60 - 55 Ma). The Dir Group and its northern continuation the Shamran Volcanics, represent resumption of volcanic activity along the margin of Eurasia after a prolonged period of uplift and erosion. Two contrasting environments of deposition are identified; a distal deep-water marine forearc (Baraul Banda Slate Fm.) and a subaerial/rifted <b>volcanic</b> cone <b>facies</b> (Utror <b>Volcanic</b> Fm. and Shamran Volcanics). Sedimentary forearc thicknesses and the abundance of rhyolite lavas and pyroclastic-flows imply extensional tectonic control even though the arc developed at a convergent margin. Juxtaposition of the two facies along the Dir Thrust reveals that between ca. 75 Ma and 55 Ma the focus of magmatic activity within Kohistan migrated northwards. During the India-Eurasia collision the arc was tectonically thickened by SSE-directed thrusts which reworked unconformable and intrusive contacts. Calc-alkaline basaltic dykes exploited these collision-related fabrics. The final magmatic episode cross-cuts all structures and lithologies and consists of peraluminous leucogranite sheets. In adopting a multi-disciplinary approach, this study has not only documented the geotectonic history of the region but has also emphasised the importance of studying surface processes when investigating structurally complex magmatic arcs...|$|R
