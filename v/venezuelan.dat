5|$|A {{country that}} had been {{reported}} to be a likely early export customer for the modernized Su-35 was Venezuela. The <b>Venezuelan</b> government of Hugo Chavez in July 2006 placed an order for 24 Su-30MK2s to replace its fleet of F-16s that were subjected to a US arms embargo. The aircraft were delivered to the <b>Venezuelan</b> Air Force from 2006 to 2008. The country was expected to follow up with a second order for the same type, or make a purchase of the Su-35. Despite subsequent reports that the <b>Venezuelan</b> government were interested in the aircraft and had placed an order for the Su-35, the country was negotiating with Russia in 2016 for the Su-30 aircraft instead.|$|E

5|$|The {{meetings}} of the Puerto Rican Independence movement which met in St. Thomas were discovered by the Spanish authorities {{and the members of}} the movement were either imprisoned or exiled. In a letter dated October 1, 1824, which <b>Venezuelan</b> rebel leader José María Rojas sent to María de las Mercedes Barbudo, Rojas stated that the <b>Venezuelan</b> rebels had lost their principal contact with the Puerto Rican Independence movement in the Danish island of Saint Thomas and therefore the secret communication which existed between the <b>Venezuelan</b> rebels and the leaders of the Puerto Rican independence movements was in danger of being discovered.|$|E

Diphtheria, which had been eradicated from Venezuela in the 1990s, reappeared in 2016 due to the shortages of medicine.|$|R

5|$|The {{flags of}} Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela, can all trace their roots {{to the flag}} of the nation of Gran Colombia (1819–1830), the {{short-lived}} republic that encompassed the territories of all three. The Gran Colombian flag in turn was inspired by {{the flag of the}} First Republic of Venezuela, the first independent government of that nation.

5|$|Although Roberts won the 250cc Grand Prix, Sheene {{claimed the}} {{victory in the}} 500cc <b>Venezuelan</b> Grand Prix while Roberts' Yamaha {{suffered}} a mechanical failure on the starting line. In the second round at the Spanish Grand Prix, Roberts was leading the race by eight seconds when his throttle stuck, forcing him to settle for second place behind fellow American Pat Hennen. Roberts then won his first-ever 500cc Grand Prix with a win in Austria, quickly followed by two more victories in France and Italy, along with two second-place finishes in the Netherlands and Belgium. At the 1978 Swedish Grand Prix, Roberts crashed during practice for the 250cc race, sustaining a concussion and a thumb injury. Shaken up by the accident, he could do no better than seventh place in the 500cc race. Sheene had come down with a debilitating virus at the <b>Venezuelan</b> round, but a string of podium finishes and a victory at the Swedish Grand Prix combined with Roberts' failure to score any points in the Finnish Grand Prix, allowed him to close the points gap.|$|E
5|$|Carlo Alberto {{acted as}} the royal yacht for King Victor Emmanuel III when he {{attended}} the coronation ceremony for King Edward VII of the United Kingdom in 1902. Victor Emmanuel invited Guglielmo Marconi to accompany him and conduct radio experiments en route. When the coronation was delayed by Edward's illness, the ship took Victor Emmanuel to meetings with Tsar Nicholas II of Russia in Kronstadt. She then ferried Marconi across the Atlantic to Nova Scotia for experiments transmitting radio messages across the ocean. After 15 December, when Marconi successfully transmitted messages from Canada to England, Carlo Alberto was sent to <b>Venezuelan</b> waters during the <b>Venezuelan</b> crisis of 1902–03, when an international force of British, German, and Italian warships blockaded Venezuela over the country's refusal to pay foreign debts. From 1907 to 1910 she served as a gunnery and torpedo training ship.|$|E
50|$|According to Brabazon, businesses, {{families}} and friends gather money and put it aside for possibly being used to pay kidnapping ransoms. Wealthy <b>Venezuelans</b> invest in armored vehicles and bodyguards while middle class <b>Venezuelans</b> change routes to work, never wear jewelry in public and never travel by foot alone. Since police are not trusted by <b>Venezuelans,</b> kidnappings are usually not reported and cannot be combatted by authorities.|$|R

5|$|In May 2006, Livingstone welcomed <b>Venezuelan</b> President Hugo Chávez to London, hosting {{an event}} {{for him at}} City Hall. This was {{condemned}} by various Conservatives claiming that Chávez's democratic socialist government had undermined pluralistic democracy. Livingstone proceeded to accept {{the presidency of the}} pro-Chávez <b>Venezuelan</b> Information Centre. In November 2006, Livingstone travelled to Latin America to visit Chávez, during which he and his entourage stayed in Cuba at a cost of £29,000; many British sources condemned the visit as a waste of tax-payer's money. In August 2007, it was announced that Livingstone had come to an agreement with oil-rich Venezuela; Chávez's government would supply £16 million a year worth of free oil to TfL, who would use it to subsidise half priced bus fares for 250,000 Londoners on benefits. In return, London would provide expertise in running transport, as well as other services such as CCTV and waste management.|$|E

5|$|In October 1886 Britain {{declared}} the Line {{to be the}} provisional frontier of British Guiana, and in February 1887 Venezuela severed diplomatic relations. Proposals for a renewal of relations and settlement of the dispute failed repeatedly, and by summer 1894, diplomatic relations had been severed for seven years, the dispute having dragged on for half a century. In addition, both sides had established police or military stations at key points in the area, partly to defend claims to the Caratal goldfield of the region's Yuruari basin, which was within <b>Venezuelan</b> territory but claimed by the British. The mine at El Callao, started in 1871, was for a time {{one of the richest}} in the world, and the goldfields as a whole saw over a million ounces exported between 1860 and 1883. The gold mining was dominated by immigrants from the British Isles and the British West Indies, giving an appearance of almost creating an English colony on <b>Venezuelan</b> territory.|$|E
5|$|Leslie (Amy Poehler) and the Pawnee parks {{department}} {{prepares for}} a visit by park department officials from Boraqua, Pawnee's Sister City in Venezuela. Leslie warns her co-workers the <b>Venezuelan</b> government officials will likely be poor, simple people.

(Fred Armisen), Antonio, Jhonny and Elvis. There are cultural clashes right away, like when they mistake Tom (Aziz Ansari) for a servant and order him to get their bags. They also mistakenly believe they can choose any woman to have sex with; they all favor Donna (Retta). Raul and Leslie exchange gifts during a meet-and-greet party, where Raul and the Venezuelans act condescending toward the Pawnee residents, making offensive remarks about the town and mocking the gifts Leslie gives them. They continue to give orders to Tom, who follows along because they give him large cash tips.|$|E
