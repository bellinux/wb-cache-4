40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{reported}} that formula-fed preterm infants score lower on visual and developmental tests relative to breast-fed preterm infants. This phenomenon {{has been associated with}} the presence of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega- 3 fatty acid, in breast milk and its absence from infant formula. To investigate the possibility that DHA status of healthy, term infants is also related to neuronal function of the visual pathway, we studied the erythrocyte fatty acid profiles of 16 infants at 22. 3 +/- 3. 9 wk of age and related these to maturity of the visual pathway as assessed by visual-evoked potentials. Healthy, term infants fed breast milk had better <b>visual-evoked</b> <b>potential</b> acuity (p < 0. 05) and higher DHA levels (p < 0. 001) than infants who received infant formula as their major energy source. There was a positive correlation between erythrocyte DHA and <b>visual-evoked</b> <b>potential</b> acuity (p < 0. 01). The data are preliminary and the long-term effects as yet unknown. However, our results suggest that there is an urgent need to evaluate the dietary fatty acid supply of formula-fed term infants. Makrides, K Simmer, M Goggin, and R A Gibso...|$|E

40|$|The {{interaction}} between brightness and color causes {{there to be}} different color appearance when {{one and the same}} object is viewed against surroundings of different brightness. Brightness contrast causes color to be desaturated, as has been found in perceptual exper-iments on color induction and color-gamut expansion in human vision. However, it is not clear yet where in the cerebral cortex the brightness–color interaction that causes thesemajor perceptual effects is located. One hypothesis is that brightness and color signals are processed separately and in parallel within the primary visual cortex V 1 and only interact in extrastriate cortex. Another hypothesis is that color and brightness contrast interact strongly already within V 1. We localized the brightness–color interaction in human V 1 by means of recording the chromatic <b>visual-evoked</b> <b>potential.</b> The chromatic <b>visual-evoked</b> <b>potential</b> measurements decisively support the idea that brightness–color interaction arises in a recurrent inhibitory network in V 1. Furthermore, our results show that the inhibitory signal for brightness–color interaction is generated by local brightness contrast at the boundary between target and surround, instead of by the luminance difference between the interior of the color target and its large background.

In this work, the traditional average method was applied to extract the ERP directly, following the stimulus of a working memory task, while a technique named steady-state probe topography was utilized to estimate the SSVEP under the simultaneous stimulus of an 8. 3 -Hz flicker and a working memory task; a comparison between the ERP and SSVEP was completed.

40|$|While it is {{generally}} believed that interactions across long distances in the visual field occur only in the higher-order cortical areas, other results suggest that such interactions are processed very early.

Presently {{there is no}} strategy to prevent visual loss {{in this kind of}} tumour. This study evaluated the effects of nerve growth factor administration in protecting visual function in patients with optic pathway glioma-related visual impairment. A prospective randomized double-blind phase II clinical trial was conducted in 18 optic pathway glioma patients, aged from 2 to 23 years, with stable disease and severe visual loss. Ten patients were randomly assigned to receive a single 10 -day course of 0. 5 mg murine nerve growth factor as eye drops, while eight patients received placebo. All patients were evaluated before and after treatment, testing visual acuity, visual field, <b>visual-evoked</b> <b>potentials,</b> optic coherence tomography, electroretinographic photopic negative response, and magnetic resonance imaging. Post-treatment evaluations were repeated at 15, 30, 90, and 180 days Brain magnetic resonance imaging was performed at baseline and at 180 days. Treatment with nerve growth factor led to statistically significant improvements in objective electrophysiological parameters (electroretinographic photopic negative response amplitude at 180 days and <b>visual-evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> at 30 days), which were not observed in placebo-treated patients. Furthermore, in patients in whom visual fields could still be measured, visual field worsening was only observed in placebo-treated cases, while three of four nerve growth factor-treated subjects showed significant visual field enlargement. This corresponded to improved visually guided behaviour, as reported by the patients and/or the caregivers. There was no evidence of side effects related to nerve growth factor treatment. Nerve growth factor eye drop administration appears a safe, easy and effective strategy for the treatment of visual loss associated with optic pathway gliomas...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Cross-modal {{plasticity}} {{has been}} extensively studied in deaf adults with neuroimaging studies, yielding valuable results. A recent study in our laboratory with deaf-blind children found evidence of cross-modal plasticity, revealed in over-representation of median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP N 20) in left hemisphere parietal, temporal and occipital regions. This finding led to asking whether SEP N 20 changes are peculiar to deaf-blindness or are also present in sighted deaf children. OBJECTIVE: Assess cross-modal plasticity in deaf child cochlear implant candidates using neurophysiological techniques (visual evoked potentials and median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials). METHODS: Participants were 14 prelingually deaf children assessed in the Cuban Cochlear Implant Program. Flash <b>visual-evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> and SEP N 20 were recorded at 19 scalp recording sites. Topographic maps were obtained and compared to those of control group children with normal hearing. Analysis took into account duration of hearing loss. RESULTS: Topographic maps of flash <b>visual-evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> did not show changes in deaf child cochlear implant candidates. However, SEP N 20 from right median nerve stimulation did show changes from expansion of cortical activation into the left temporal region in deaf children aged > 7 years, which was interpreted as neurophysiological evidence of cross-modal plasticity, not previously described for this technique and type of somatosensory stimulus. We interpret this finding as {{due in part to}} duration of deafness, particularly related to handedness, since expansion was selective for the left hemisphere in the children, who were all right-handed. CONCLUSIONS: Cortical over-representation of SEP N 20 in the left temporal region is interpreted as evidence of cross-modal plasticity that occurs if the deaf child does not receive a cochlear implant early in life-before concluding the critical period of neural development- and relies on sign language for communication...|$|R
40|$|Contrast {{response}} functions (CRFs) from multifocal <b>visual-evoked</b> <b>potential</b> (mfVEP) and BOLD fMRI {{responses were}} obtained {{using the same}} stimuli {{to test the hypothesis}} of a linear relationship between the mfVEP and BOLD fMRI responses. Monocular mfVEP and BOLD fMRI responses were obtained using an 8 ° in diameter, dartboard pattern stimulus with reversing checkerboards. Six contrast conditions (4 %, 8 %, 16 %, 32 %, 64 %, and 90 %) were run. The mfVEP, largely generated in V 1, was compared to the BOLD fMRI signal from V 1 and extrastriate cortex. Retinotopic maps of each subject were acquired and used to localize the V 1 area. For all subjects, the CRFs for the mfVEPs and BOLD fMRI responses showed good agreement, suggesting that they both share the same functional relationship with underlying neural activity. In particular, this result is consistent with the assumption that the relationship between the BOLD response and underlying neural activity is linear, although the particular linear model proposed by D.

Methods: Affected family members underwent complete neuro-ophthalmological evaluation, including visual acuity testing, colour vision testing, tonometry, visual field testing, colour fundus photography, pattern <b>visual-evoked</b> <b>potential</b> (PVEP) testing, and pattern electroretinography (PERG). Patients and age-matched control subjects were scanned by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) to assess circumpapillary RNFL thickness. Results: All patients showed the characteristic optic disc pallor and central scotomas in the visual field. PVEP testing and PERG also showed alterations consistent with ADOA. The average circumpapillary RNFL thickness was thinner in ADOA patients than in control subjects (60. 87 [*]±[*] 6. 58 µm and 108. 13 [*]±[*] 6. 53 µm, respectively; p = 0. 0001). The visual acuity in patients with ADOA correlated significantly with the circumpapillary average RNFL thickness (r = - 0. 845, p = 0. 008).

The present study examined the temporal dynamics of electrocortical signals preceding a lapse of sustained attention. Twenty-one participants performed a continuous temporal expectancy task, which involved continuously monitoring a stream of regularly alternating patterned stimuli to detect a rarely occurring target stimulus whose duration was 40 % longer. The stimulus stream flickered {{at a rate of}} 25 Hz to elicit a steady-state <b>visual-evoked</b> <b>potential</b> (SSVEP), which served as a continuous measure of basic visual processing. Increasing activity in the band (8 - 14 Hz) was found beginning 20 s before a missed target. This was followed by decreases in the amplitude of two event-related components over a short pretarget time frame: the frontal P 3 (3 - 4 s) and contingent-negative variation (during the target interval). In contrast, SSVEP amplitude before hits and misses was closely matched, suggesting that the efficacy of ongoing basic visual processing was unaffected.

Transient stimuli normally elicit a short series {{of positive and negative}} deflections lasting between 300 and 500  ms [6 - 8]: the <b>visual-evoked</b> <b>potential</b> (VEP). Alpha oscillations, on the other hand, are generally suppressed by transient visual input [1, 8]; they only augment in response to periodic ("steady-state") inputs around 10  Hz [9, 10]. Here, we applied reverse-correlation techniques to the visual presentation of random, nonperiodic dynamic stimulation sequences and found that the brain response to each stimulus transient was not merely a short-lived VEP but also included a strong ∼ 10  Hz oscillation that lasted for more than 1 s. In other words, the alpha rhythm implements an "echo" or reverberation of the input sequence. These echoes are correlated in magnitude and frequency with the observer's occipital alpha rhythm, are enhanced by visual attention, and can be rendered perceptually apparent in the form of ∼ 10  Hz flicker.

Two experienced vascular sonographers performed the study by using B-mode transorbital sonography. <b>Visual-evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> were performed on the same day as the transorbital sonography and were evaluated by an expert neurophysi-ologist. Sonographers and the neurophysiologist were blinded to the status of the patient or control and to clinical information, including the side of the affected eye. RESULTS: The median optic nerve sheath diameter was thicker on the affected side (6. 3 mm; interquartile range, 5. 9 – 7. 2 mm) compared with the nonaffected side (5. 5 mm; interquartile range, 5. 1 – 6. 2 mm; P. 0001) and controls (5. 2 mm; interquartile range, 4. 8 – 5. 5 mm; P. 0001). The median optic nerve diameter was 3. 0 mm (range, 2. 8 – 3. 1 mm) on the affected side and 2. 9 mm (range, 2. 8 – 3. 1 mm) on the nonaffected side (P not significant.). Both sides were thicker than those in controls (2. 7 mm; interquartile range, 2. 5 – 2. 8 mm; P. 001 and. 009). No correlation was found between optic nerve sheath diameter and optic nerve diameter and amplitude and latency of visual...|$|R
40|$|A brain-computer {{interface}} (BCI) based on steady-state <b>visual-evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> (SSVEPs) {{is combined with}} a functional electrical stimulation (FES) system to allow the user to control stimulation settings and parameters. The system requires four flickering lights of distinct frequencies {{that are used to}} form a menu-based interface, enabling the user to interact with the FES system. The approach was evaluated in 12 neurologically intact subjects to change the parameters and operating mode of an abdominal stimulation system for respiratory assistance. No major influence of the FES on the raw EEG signal could be observed. In tests with a self-paced task, a mean accuracy of more than 90 % was achieved, with detection times of approximately 7. 7 s and an average information transfer rate of 12. 5 bits/min. There was no significant dependency of the accuracy or time of detection on the FES stimulation intensity. The results indicate that the system could be used to control FES-based neuroprostheses {{with a high degree of}} accuracy and robustness...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Hyperventilation {{is often}} {{associated}} with stress, an established trigger factor for migraine. Between attacks, migraine is associated with a deficit in habituation to <b>visual-evoked</b> <b>potentials</b> (VEP) that worsens just before the att-ack. Hyperventilation slows electroencephalographic (EEG) activity and decreases the functional response in the occipital cortex during visual stimulation. The neural mechanisms underlying deficient-evoked potential habituation in migrai-neurs remain unclear. To find out whether hyperventilation alters VEP habituation, we recorded VEPs before and after experimentally induced hyperventilation lasting 3 min in 18 healthy subjects and 18 migraine patients between attacks. We measured VEP P 100 amplitudes in six sequential blocks of 100 sweeps and habituation as the change in amplitude over the six blocks. In healthy subjects, hyperventilation decreased VEP amplitude in block 1 and abolished the normal VEP habituation. In migraine patients, hyperventilation further decreased the already low block 1 amplitude and worsened the interictal habituation deficit. Hyperventilation worsens the habituation deficit in migraineurs possibly by increasing dysrhythmia in the brainstem-thalamo-cortical network...|$|R
