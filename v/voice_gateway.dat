50|$|As of 2009, Internet via {{satellite}} had a steady {{growth rate of}} 10% to 15% per year. It was particularly in demand in remote areas {{that did not have}} either dialup or wireless online services. The local telecommunications company Dalkom Somalia provided internet over satellite, as well as premium routes for media operators and content providers, and international <b>voice</b> <b>gateway</b> services for global carriers. It also offered inexpensive bandwidth through its internet backbone, whereas bandwidth ordinarily cost customers from $2,500 to $3,000 per month through the major international bandwidth providers. The main clients of these local satellite services were internet cafes, money transfer firms and other companies, as well as international community representatives. In total, there were over 300 local satellite terminals available aross the nation, which were linked to teleports in Europe and Asia. Demand for the satellite services gradually began to fall as broadband wireless access rose. However, it increased in rural areas, as the main client base for the satellite services extended their operations into more remote locales.|$|E

We adopt an open source called OpenVXI as the VoiceXML interpreter. Our main effort for developing the voice browser is to incorporate OpenVXI with our SR, TTS, and CTI modules. In order to test whether our voice browser conforms to the VoiceXML specifications we build three VoiceXML applications including stock quotes querying, automatic call-transfer, and news-reading systems.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, Electrical and Computer Engineering. "May 2006. "Includes bibliographic {{references}} (leaves 60 - 63) Emerging {{voice over}} IP networks dictate {{a need for}} efficient network resource management schemes to mitigate the best-effort nature of IP. Traditional quality of service and call admission control mechanisms provide network resource allocation to static voice flows with parameters fixed by a selected voice codec. Frequently, the available bandwidth is not efficiently utilized, which results in a lower-than-possible average voice quality and potential wastage of resources. In this thesis, the author proposes a dynamic voice codec determination scheme that selects codec’s on per-call basis with respect to available resources. The proposed mechanism relies on continuous monitoring of a centrally managed IP network {{to determine the best}} voice codec selections for each pair of participating <b>voice</b> <b>gateways.</b> The determination process is modeled as a simple knapsack-like problem to take the fullest advantage of available resources, while maximizing the average voice quality. Overall, the new system is shown to achieve a better average voice quality and more efficient network resource utilization, when compared to traditional application centric QoS and all admission control solutions...|$|R

40|$|Today VoiceXML is the {{standard}} scripting language for rendering web pages over the telephone. Developing costs of an interactive phone application have changed dramatically with the new markup language. VoiceXML builds on the basic concept and rules set by XML. Interactive applications contain synthesized speech, pre-recorded audio, grammars defining words that could be recognised, and DTMF key input. By saying something or pressing the keypad on the phone the user transitions between different pages. VoiceXML {{could be used in}} many different ways. You can integrate it with your web page, letting people access it through a phone. It is simple to create services such as booking a ticket or looking up when the bus leaves. It can be used to create a voicemail from your phone or having your regular e-mail be read to you. Some vendors of <b>voice</b> <b>gateways</b> even offer SMS add-ons. The neat thing is that VoiceXML works both with the traditional PSTN system and the new technology of Voice over IP (VoIP). This paper describes how VoiceXML is defined and how it works. It also contains a short discussion between the differences in SALT, Microsoft’s voice language, and VoiceXML. We have tried to implement our own service and it is described in detail in chapter 6.

To Linda Achieving convergence by combining and integrating data and voice networks into {{a new form of}} communication presents a challenging aim for next generation IP networks. Therefore, standards have been defined to allow transportation of voice and multimedia calls over IP networks. At present, two signaling protocol families exist beside each other, SIP and H. 323. Both empower users to establish multimedia connections between two or more endpoints. Nevertheless they provide no means to facilitate communication between users of the different standards. As SIP and H. 323 are expected to coexist in the future, large effort is put into development of gateways allowing seamless communication between endpoints of the two standards. This master’s thesis examines the possibility of enhancing an existing carrier-grade ISDN/-H. 323 media gateway controller to a SIP/H. 323 gateway.
