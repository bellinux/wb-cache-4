30|$|In {{addition}} to ileocolonoscopy, the gastroenterologist can use other techniques {{to evaluate the}} small bowel. Double balloon enteroscopy can examine {{the whole of the}} small bowel, either under conscious sedation or general anaesthesia.

A recent meta-analysis [11] looking at nine studies comparing VCE to other techniques in the diagnosis of CD (i.e. ileocolonoscopy, CT enterography/enteroclysis, push enteroscopy and MRI) showed VCE gave a greater diagnostic yield due to its ability to detect mucosal abnormalities. However VCE is not possible in stricturing disease, hence radiological imaging is usually required first to exclude this (unless a patency capsule is used).|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to compare the {{kinematic}} features of motorcycles with those of passenger cars in urban traffic. The hypothesis that motorcycles' capability to swerve in urban traffic contributes to their seemingly assertive behaviour is examined.

In addition, a model describing the longitudinal following behaviour of motorcycles was employed to analyse the impacts of motorcycles' swerving behaviour. The model was calibrated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) numerical methods. The observable kinematic features show that in comparison to passenger cars, motorcycles have shorter safety gaps, higher speeds and severer acceleration and deceleration rates reflecting their generally much higher power to weight ratios and usage of available braking power. However, the data also support the hypothesis that motorcyclists maintain a considerable safety margin as they have the ability to avoid a collision by swerving away...|$|R
