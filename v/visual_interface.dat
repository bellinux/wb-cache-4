No signal conversion is necessary, nor is there a loss of video quality when a DVI-to-HDMI adapter is used. The CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) capability allows HDMI devices to control each other when necessary and allows the user to operate multiple devices with one handheld remote control device.|$|E
5|$|For {{external}} connectivity, the Mac Pro included five USB 2.0 ports, two FireWire 400 and two FireWire 800 (Late 2006 until Early 2008), respectively four FireWire 800 (Early 2009 until Mid 2012) ports. Networking {{was supported}} with two built-in Gigabit Ethernet ports. 802.11a/b/g/n Wi-Fi support (AirPort Extreme) required an optional module in the Mid 2006, Early 2008 and Early 2009 models, {{whereas in the}} 2010 model and later Wi-Fi was standard. Bluetooth also required an optional module in the Mid 2006 model, but was standard in the Early 2008 and newer models. Displays were supported by one or (optionally) more PCIe graphics cards. More recent cards featured two Mini DisplayPort connectors and one dual-link Digital <b>Visual</b> <b>Interface</b> (DVI) port, with various configurations of on-card graphics memory available.|$|E

5|$|The player flies {{around in}} a fighter with a first-person, in-cockpit view with a fully {{customizable}} fixed head-up display (HUD) as the <b>visual</b> <b>interface.</b> The HUD displays video communications and relevant data on the ship's status and performance, weapons, objectives, and targets. It can also warn players from which direction missiles are locking onto them from, thus becoming an aide for launching countermeasures or taking evasive maneuvers. Players have to maneuver into position and shoot through both shields and hull to destroy enemy ships. While hull damage is unrecoverable, shields recharge over time. With the game supporting force feedback technology, joystick players will find their controllers vibrating or putting up resistance when they engage the afterburners or collide with objects. Similarly, certain events, such as engaging afterburners and firing powerful weapons, will shake the screen {{as a form of}} visual feedback.|$|E

Windows ME incorporated <b>visual</b> <b>interface</b> enhancements from its Windows NT-based counterpart Windows 2000, had faster boot times than previous versions (which however, required {{the removal of}} the ability to access a real mode DOS environment, removing compatibility with some older programs), expanded multimedia functionality (including Windows Media Player 7, Windows Movie Maker, and the Windows Image Acquisition framework for retrieving images from scanners and digital cameras), additional system utilities such as System File Protection and System Restore, and updated home networking tools. However, Windows ME was faced with criticism for its speed and instability, along with hardware compatibility issues and its removal of real mode DOS support. PC World considered Windows ME {{to be one of the}} worst operating systems Microsoft had ever released, and the 4th worst tech product of all time.|$|E

Hardawar {{noted that the}} {{major changes in the}} release focus on features rather than the <b>visual</b> <b>interface.</b> He wrote that the lock screen is now [...] "far more customizable than before". He praised the new features added to 3D Touch, writing that it [...] "finally feels useful", where he likes that [...] "3D Touch works in almost every part of the OS". In regard to iMessage, he wrote that it has new features that are [...] "particularly useful", including [...] "Invisible ink" [...] that obscures text in a conversation when others might be looking, but criticized the user interface, writing that it [...] "needs some work". The [...] "Memories" [...] feature in the new Photos app [...] "usually turned out well", but wrote that [...] "they're still clearly a work in progress". Hardawar praised the new Apple Music app, but added that [...] "really, anything is better than the last iteration". He also liked lyrics support. He wrote that Siri's third-party support was [...] "actually starting to get useful", but did run into accuracy issues. He finished by writing that although iOS 10 does add features seen in Google's Android operating system before, the mobile industry is [...] "shamelessly getting [...] "inspired" [...] by the competition". His summary states that [...] "iOS 10 is a collection of useful changes to an already solid OS".|$|E
40|$|Abstract] Majority of the {{available}} digital information are associated with some location or regions on the Earth. Traditional <b>visual</b> <b>interfaces</b> to digital libraries were not designed {{to deal with the}} unique geospatial characteristics of data, nor did they take full advantage of the georeferencing as a mechanism for browsing and retrieving information. This paper highlights the trends of <b>visual</b> <b>interfaces</b> to geospatial information, and suggests major challenges towards effective visualization of multimedia geospatial document space. Citing recent research efforts, we review the attempts to integrate document visualization (developed in information science) with geovisualization techniques (developed in geographical information science) to support science, information access and decision making. We conclude by a set of spatial cognitive principles that influence future development of such <b>visual</b> <b>interfaces</b> to geographic information. 1...|$|R

Among the art team was Ensemble Studios' first artist Brad Crow, who had worked on every Age of Empires game produced by the studio. The team implemented several ideas to give the game an improved core <b>visual</b> <b>interface</b> over that of its predecessors such as; increasing the field of view so that the player was able to see more on the screen, a tighter user interface to allow more of the field of play to be visible, a new building design to make them encompass less screen space [...] while also making them look more recognizable, and giving each unit a unique look and animation making them more easily distinguishable from each other.|$|E

We build upon previous {{work on the}} performance of human/robotic systems by studying the effects of two different <b>visual</b> <b>interfaces.</b> Namely, we compare a world view with an eye-in-hand view and evaluate how these two different <b>visual</b> <b>interfaces</b> affect human performance and task completion. ...|$|R

The method provides coarse but rapid hand tracking results with the lowest possible number of samples on the wearable side, and can reduce latency which causes a decline in usability and performance of gesture-based interfaces. The method also provides the adaptive tracking mechanism by using the suficient number of samples and the hand-color modeling on the infmstructure side. This paper also describes three promising applications of the hand-gesture-based wearable <b>visual</b> <b>interfaces</b> implemented on our wearable systems. ...|$|R
