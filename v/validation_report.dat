40|$|For many {{macromolecular}} NMR ensembles {{from the}} Protein Data Bank (PDB) the experiment-based restraint lists are available, while other experimental data, mainly chemical shift values, are often {{available from the}} BioMagResBank. The accuracy and precision of the coordinates in these macromolecular NMR ensembles can be improved by recalculation using the available experimental data and present-day software. Such efforts, however, generally fail on half of all NMR ensembles due to the syntactic and semantic heterogeneity of the underlying data and {{the wide variety of}} formats used for their deposition.

50|$|The {{next step}} would be to hire an {{independent}} certifier to do the CCB audit and validate the project. Currently, eligible CCB certifiers are the CDM certifiers (Designated Operational Entities - DOEs), like SGS, TÜV SÜD, etc., or the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certifiers (e.g., Rainforest Alliance).Once an independent certifier is chosen, a project design document can be created, {{with the assistance of}} the CCB Validation Guidance document, and submitted to the CCBA for validation. The CCB audit and validation should take about two months or sometimes more depending on the audit findings. Typically, the CCB auditor reviews all the project documents and once they find that the documentation is sufficient and appropriate to proceed with an audit they forward the documents to the CCBA for the mandatory public comment period. Once the auditor evaluates the responses they write up the final audit & <b>validation</b> <b>report</b> and forward this with their statement of conformance to CCB Standards to the CCBA for publication on the CCBA website. Then the project would be deemed “CCB validated”.|$|E
5000|$|PROSESS (Protein Structure Evaluation Suite & Server) is a freely {{available}} {{web server}} for protein structure validation. [...] It is {{specifically designed to}} assist with the process of evaluating and validating protein structures solved by NMR spectroscopy. Structure validation is a particularly important component of the structure determination pipeline as many protein structures have small structural errors (i.e. distorted bond lengths or angles, incompatible torsion angles, overlapping atoms) that are not easily detected by visual inspection. For protein structures solved by NMR spectroscopy, where large numbers of structures are generated and where coordinate inaccuracies are common, this problem is particularly acute. Most NMR-based structure validation protocols primarily use NOE (Nuclear Overhauser Enhancement), J-coupling or residual dipolar coupling (RDC [...] ) data to assess or validate structures. In particular, they try to assess the agreement between the experimentally observed and the calculated NOEs, RDCs and/or J-couplings. Good agreement between the calculated and observed parameters normally indicates a good structure. Other methods for structure validation (such as ProCheck, MolProbity, ResProx and VADAR) focus on measuring coordinate data, rather than experimental data, to assess the quality of the bond or torsion angle geometry. PROSESS is unique among structure validation servers in that it evaluates both coordinate quality and experimental data quality. Furthermore PROSESS is also able to use NMR chemical shifts (as well as NOEs) to assess or validate protein structures. Chemical shifts are easily and very precisely measurable NMR observables that provide {{a great deal of information}} about protein structure and dynamics (see Protein Chemical Shift Prediction). Specifically, PROSESS assesses the agreement between observed chemical shifts and ShiftX-predicted HA, CA, CB, N, C, and HN NMR chemical shifts. In addition to its ability to validate structures using chemical shifts, PROSESS also checks many other protein structure parameters including covalent bond quality, non-covalent bond and atomic packing quality, torsion angle quality and NOE quality (i.e. measuring the model agreement with NOE-based distance restraints). A total of 8 different programs (see PROSESS sub-programs below) are used in the PROSESS evaluation and validation process. PROSESS generates a richly detailed and very colorful structure <b>validation</b> <b>report,</b> including tables, color-coded images and graphs or bar charts. Many of the tables contain embedded hyperlinks to additional details or carefully written explanations. For most all of its graphs and charts, PROSESS uses a simple RAG (red, amber, green) color scheme to indicate the quality of different structure parameters for the protein (as a whole), for different members of the structure ensemble, for specific residues and for specific atoms. Different shades of red indicate serious problems, different shades of yellow or amber indicate potential problems and different shades of green indicate that the protein model or its residues/atoms are free of problems. Each color is also assigned a number (ranging from 0 to 9 -- with 0 being bad and 9 being excellent) so that the structure quality assessment is more quantifiable. PROSESS’s quality indices and quality color scales have been designed specifically to help non-structural biologists to more easily and rapidly understand protein structure validation reports. In addition to being able to validate NMR protein structures, PROSESS can be used to validate or evaluate any protein model, regardless of how it was solved (X-ray, NMR, comparative modelling, etc.).
