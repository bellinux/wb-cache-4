40|$|Issue addressed: Modern health {{promotion}} practice needs {{to respond to}} complex health issues that have multiple interrelated determinants. This requires {{an understanding of the}} <b>values</b> <b>and</b> principles of {{health promotion}}. Methods: A literature review was undertaken to explore the <b>values</b> <b>and</b> principles evident in current health promotion theory and practice. Results: A broad range of <b>values</b> <b>and</b> principles are espoused as being integral to modern health promotion theory and practice. Although there are some commonalities across these lists, there is no recognised, authoritative set of <b>values</b> <b>and</b> principles accepted as fundamental and applicable to modern health promotion. There is a continuum of <b>values</b> <b>and</b> principles evident in health promotion practice from those associated with holistic, ecological, salutogenic health promotion to those more in keeping with conventional health promotion. Conclusion: There is a need for a system of <b>values</b> <b>and</b> principles consistent with modern health promotion that enables practitioners to purposefully integrate these <b>values</b> <b>and</b> principles into their understanding of health, as well as their needs assessment, planning, implementation and evaluation practice. So what?: A system of <b>values</b> <b>and</b> principles would assist practitioners to respond to complex health issues that have multiple interrelated determinants...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} couple of decades, it has become a commonplace to claim that “institutions matter” for {{economic}} development. Yet, institutions are not exogenous but the result of hu-man action. It is argued here that the <b>values</b> <b>and</b> norms held by substantial parts of society’s members are an important determinant of its institutions. It is further argued that <b>values</b> <b>and</b> norms have both a direct and an indirect effect on economic development: the direct effect materializes because the <b>values</b> <b>and</b> norms also contain the work ethic which, if transformed into behavior, should have direct consequences on economic development. The indirect effect is conjectured to work via the relevant institutions: if institutions are important for economic development and institutions are influenced by the <b>values</b> <b>and</b> norms, then this is a more indi-rect channel through which <b>values</b> <b>and</b> norms can display their impact.

40|$|The {{management}} of multiple-use public lands such as national {{forests in the}} U. S. is controversial because of {{the wide range of}} potential uses <b>and</b> contested public <b>values</b> for these lands. Previous research on national forest <b>values</b> <b>and</b> management preferences examined these relationships non-spatially. The development of public participation GIS (PPGIS) and volunteered geographic information (VGI) systems provide new opportunities to assess spatial relationships between perceived national forest <b>values</b> <b>and</b> preferred uses. This research used empirical data collected from a PPGIS/VGI study for three national forests in California to examine spatial and non-spatial relationships between place-based forest <b>values</b> <b>and</b> preferred uses. The relationships suggest public participants translated some of their non-spatial forest <b>values</b> <b>and</b> preferences into behavioral choices when mapping place-specific <b>values</b> <b>and</b> preferred uses. The empirical relationships between place-based forest <b>values</b> <b>and</b> uses were generally consistent with previous survey research results. Positive, non-spatial attitudes toward extractive uses of national forests were correlated with participant mapping of economic <b>values</b> <b>and</b> related extractive uses, while nonmaterial forest attitudes were correlated with participant mapping of amenity <b>values</b> <b>and</b> conservation-related uses. Further, spatial preferences for extractive forest uses such as timber harvesting were mapped proximate to economic values, while nonmaterial spatial preferences were mapped proximate to amenity-related forest values. PPGIS offers the potential to translate philosophical and ideology-based national forest preferences into place-specific discourse about forest management activities where public accommodation may be more achievable...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Relatively {{little is known about}} how concepts of human <b>values</b> <b>and</b> <b>value</b> interact during the construction design process. Whilst researchers of value management have expounded in this context upon the complexity of the design process, problem-solving and sense-making, little is said about the alignment and reconciliation of multiple-stakeholder <b>values</b> <b>and</b> <b>value</b> judgements. An abductive reasoning and a grounded theory approach was adopted that iterated between literature and empirical observation to obtain new insights. The initial phase created a <b>values</b> <b>and</b> <b>value</b> framework <b>and</b> <b>Value</b> in Design (VALiD) approach through seven unstructured interviews, a design workshop, four Schwartz Values Surveys (with 545 participants) and 55 semi-structured interviews. The <b>values</b> <b>and</b> <b>value</b> parts were then separately implemented, developed and validated through action research on five live education capital projects, involving over 250 participants. Subsequently, a middle-range theory of <b>values</b> <b>and</b> <b>value</b> is proposed through theoretical triangulation. This draws on seven related theories to provide greater explanatory pluralism, uncover hidden phenomena and enable convergence. The research findings are significant in focusing soft value management on underlying stakeholder <b>values</b> <b>and</b> subjective <b>value</b> judgements. A more nuanced and intertwined relationship between stakeholder <b>values,</b> attitudes, behaviours <b>and</b> qualities during the design process is offered that promotes compromise and sense-making...|$|R
