Methods: From January 2005 to June 2006, 33 patients (23 men; age range 39 – 90 years) with 36 occlusions were treated using ultrasound-enhanced thrombolytic therapy for acute and chronic arterial and <b>venous</b> <b>occlusions.</b> After diagnostic angiography, the occlusions were crossed with an appropriately sized Lysus infusion catheter for infusion of urokinase (80, 000 – 120, 000 IU/h). Results: Technical success and complete lysis was achieved in 96 % of the arterial and 83 % of the <b>venous</b> <b>occlusions.</b> Two patients with chronic occlusions (one superficial femoral artery and one iliac vein) were refractory to lytic therapy. Average time for complete lysis was 16. 4 hours (range 3 – 25) for arterial occlusions and 21. 2 hours (range 6 – 43) in patients with deep vein thrombosis.

40|$|Background. Near {{infrared}} spectroscopy (NIRS) is a new, non-invasive monitoring method in neonates, {{which has now}} become part of routine monitoring in many neonatal intensive care units (NICU). New, additional, non-invasive technical monitoring might have an influence on neonatal wellbeing. Objectives. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the wellbeing of neonates during peripheral and cerebral NIRS monitoring and <b>venous</b> <b>occlusions.</b> Methods. In the present study, secondary outcome parameters of prospective observational studies with NIRS in term and preterm neonates were analysed. Heart rate (HR), arterial oxygen saturation (SpO 2), respiratory rate (RR), mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), pain score and skin condition at four defined time points during NIRS measurements of regional tissue oxygenation were recorded and analysed. Results. Thirty-six term and preterm neonates were included (gestational age (GA) 36 ± 1 week, 2779 ± 930 g birth weight). SpO 2 and peripheral tissue oxygenation index (pTOI) increased and HR dropped while RR, mean MABP and pain scores remained unchanged during NIRS measurements.

50|$|Bacterial or {{occasionally}} {{fungal infection}} of the skull bones or air sinuses can spread to the subdural space, producing a subdural empyema. The underlying arachnoid and subarachnoid spaces are usually unaffected, but a large subdural empyema may produce a mass effect. Further, a thrombophlebitis may develop in the bridging veins that cross the subdural space, resulting in <b>venous</b> <b>occlusion</b> and infarction of the brain. With treatment, including surgical drainage, resolution of the empyema occurs from the dural side, and, if it is complete, a thickened dura {{may be the only}} residual finding. Symptoms include those referable to the source of the infection. In addition, most patients are febrile, with headache and neck stiffness, and, if untreated, may develop focal neurologic signs, lethargy, and coma. The CSF profile is similar to that seen in brain abscesses, because both are parameningeal infectious processes. If diagnosis and treatment are prompt, complete recovery is usual.|$|E
50|$|Acute {{compartment}} syndrome {{is a medical}} emergency requiring immediate surgical treatment, known as a fasciotomy, to allow the pressure to return to normal. Although only one compartment is affected, fasciotomy is done to release all compartments. For instance, if only the deep posterior compartment of a leg is affected, the treatment would be fasciotomy (with medial and lateral incisions) to release all compartments of the leg in question, namely the anterior, lateral, superficial posterior and deep posterior.An acute {{compartment syndrome}} has some distinct features such as swelling of the compartment due to inflammation and <b>venous</b> <b>occlusion.</b> Decompression of the nerve traversing the compartment might alleviate the symptoms (Rorabeck, 1984). Until definitive fasciotomy can be performed, the extremity should be placed {{at the level of}} the heart. Hypotension should also be avoided, as this decreases perfusion pressure to the compartment. Supplemental oxygen also optimizes tissue and neural oxygenation.|$|E

HISTORY AND SIGNS: A 34 -year-old Hispanic woman presented with a sudden visual loss of the right eye associated with shivers, high fever and arthritis which developed 2 months after a cat's bite. Fundus examination showed papillitis and a palor of the paramacular zone of the retina.

40|$|Abstract: Background. The {{purpose of}} this study was to an-alyze the causes of flap {{compromise}} and failure in head and neck free flap reconstruction. Methods. We retrospectively reviewed 1310 free flap recon-structions for head and neck defects performed between July 1995 and June 2006. Results. Forty-nine cases of flap compromise due to vascular obstruction (3. 7 %) were identified, and 27 flaps were lost (2 %). Ar-terial occlusions occurred in 12 flaps, with a salvage rate of 33 %. Eight flaps failedwithin the first 24 hours, and only 1 of thesewas sal-vageable. Five of the 8 flaps had intraoperative thrombosis due to technical difficulties. <b>Venous</b> <b>occlusions</b> occurred in 31 flaps, with a salvage rate of 58 %. Twenty-two <b>venous</b> <b>occlusions</b> occurred within the first 72 hours. The main reason for venous failure was mechani-cal obstruction due to compression, twisting, kinking, or stretching of the vein. The most common cause of late failures (after 7 days) was unrecognized failure of a buried flap owing to the lack of reliable monitoring. Overall, there was no correlation between surgeon ex-perience and flap failure, but the flap failure rate was lower in sur-geonswho hadperformedmore than 70 free flap procedures. Conclusion. Precise surgical techniques, avoidance of me-chanical obstruction, and better monitoring of buried flaps may further improve the success rate of free tissue transfer in com-plex head and neck reconstruction.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Many {{patients}} experience pain on {{injection of}} propofol. The use of lidocaine to prevent propofol injection pain is common.

Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the effectiveness of various <b>venous</b> <b>occlusion</b> times with lidocaine analgesia to prevent pain during propofol injection. Methods: In this prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled study, women aged 18 to 45 years, classifed as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical sta- tus I or II, who were scheduled to undergo elective surgery under general anesthesia induced with propofol, were randomly assigned to 1 of 5 groups: group 1, 2 % lidocaine 20 mg in saline in a total volume of 10 mL and no venous occlusion; group 2, 2 % lidocaine 20 mg in saline in a total volume of 10 mL plus <b>venous</b> <b>occlusion</b> for 15 seconds; group 3, 2 % lidocaine plus <b>venous</b> <b>occlusion</b> for 30 seconds; group 4, 2 % lidocaine plus <b>venous</b> <b>occlusion</b> for 60 seconds; and group 5, saline 10 mL and no <b>venous</b> <b>occlusion.</b> When the first 25 % of the calculated propofol dose was administered, patients were asked about propofol-induced pain using a verbal pain scale (0 = no pain; 1 = mild pain; 2 = moderate pain; and 3 = severe pain). All patients and the anesthesiologist who evaluated pain severity were blinded to the study preparation being used. Results: The study comprised 100 women who were randomly divided into 5 groups of 20 patients each. Significantly more patients in group 5 (18 [90 %] patients; P < 0. 05) reported pain compared with the other treatment groups. In groups 2, 3, and 4, in which <b>venous</b> <b>occlusion</b> was applied, pain was reported during propofol injection in 6 (30 %), 7 (35 %), and 2 (10 %) patients, respectively. The incidence of reported pain was significantly greater in group 1 (lidocaine without <b>venous</b> <b>occlusion)</b> than in group 4 (P < 0. 05); however, the incidence of pain was similar in group 1 compared with groups 2 and 3. Conclusions: The present study found that pretreatment with lidocaine 20 mg with or without <b>venous</b> <b>occlusion</b> significantly reduced the incidence and the severity of pain during the injection of propofol when compared with the group with no <b>venous</b> <b>occlusion</b> administered saline.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} in vivo {{the function}} of the microcirculation of the skin in pregnancy and pregnancy complicated with pre-eclampsia. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Academic Medical Centre. PARTICIPANTS: A group of 10 women with pre-eclampsia and a healthy control group of 10 pregnant women. METHODS: The microcirculation of the skin of the finger at rest and during <b>venous</b> <b>occlusion</b> was studied with laser Doppler fluxmetry and orthogonal polarisation spectral imaging. By inflating a cuff around the upper arm to a pressure of 50 mmHg, causing <b>venous</b> <b>occlusion,</b> the local sympathetic veno-arteriolar reflex was provoked. With laser Doppler fluxmetry the blood flow of the skin at a depth of 1 - 2 mm was measured at rest and during <b>venous</b> <b>occlusion.</b> Orthogonal polarisation spectral imaging was used to assess red blood cell velocity at rest and during <b>venous</b> <b>occlusion</b> of the nutritive capillaries of the skin. RESULTS: Laser Doppler fluxmetry showed {{no significant difference between the}} normotensive group and the group with pre-eclampsia. Using orthogonal polarisation spectral imaging, <b>venous</b> <b>occlusion</b> produced a significantly greater decrease in red blood cell velocity in the control group than in the women with pre-eclampsia: (84 % (81 - 88) (median and interquartile range) vs 58 % (45 - 88), P = 0. 0029). No differences in absolute red blood cell velocities were observed between groups either at rest or during <b>venous</b> <b>occlusion.</b> CONCLUSION: This study shows an impaired local veno-arteriolar reflex in pre-eclampsia at the nutritive, but not at the therrmoregulatory, level of the microcirculation of the ski...|$|E
