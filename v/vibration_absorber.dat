Rotating machines such as engines, motors, and pumps often incite vibration due to rotational imbalances. A dynamic absorber can be {{affixed to the}} rotating machine and tuned to oscillate {{in such a way}} that exactly counteracts the force from the rotating imbalance. This reduces the possibility that a resonance condition will occur, which can cause rapid catastrophic failure.

40|$|Abstract: Active-type dynamic <b>vibration</b> <b>absorbers</b> (ADVA) {{is a kind}} of damping system, {{installed}} an actuators in {{the dynamic}} <b>vibration</b> <b>absorbers</b> (DVA). According to the actual needs, vibration energy of the structure is transferred to <b>vibration</b> <b>absorbers</b> actively in the process of structural vibration for the effect of external excitation. Therefore, the energy is decayed or transferred quickly and the structural vibration is controlled. If the nature frequency of additional system is the same as external excitation frequency of the original system, actuators doesn’t start and the whole system behaves the property of DVA (passive damping). Otherwise, actuators starts, which makes the energy of original structure transfer to the <b>vibration</b> <b>absorbers</b> actively, achieving the purpose of energy consumed and vibration reduced.

This paper analyzes the prospect of using a <b>vibration</b> <b>absorber</b> for pos-sible energy harvesting. To achieve this goal, a <b>vibration</b> <b>absorber</b> is supplemented with a piezoelectric stack for both vibration confinement and energy harvesting. It is assumed that the original structure is sensitive to vibrations and that the absorber is the element where the vibration energy is confined, which in turn is harvested by means of a piezo-electric stack.

40|$|The {{classical}} {{problem for}} the application of a tuned <b>vibration</b> <b>absorber</b> is to minimize the response of a structural system, such as displacement, velocity, acceleration or to maximize the energy dissipated by tuned <b>vibration</b> <b>absorber.</b> The development of explicit optimal absorber parameters is challenging for a clamped structural system since the fixed points no longer exist in the frequency response curve. This paper aims at deriving a set of simple design formula of tuned <b>vibration</b> <b>absorber</b> with nonlinear viscous damping based on the frequency tuning for harmonic load for a damped structural system under white noise excitation. The vibration absorbers being considered include tuned mass damper (TMD) and liquid column <b>vibration</b> <b>absorber</b> (LCVA). Simple approximate expression for the standard deviation velocity response of tuned <b>vibration</b> <b>absorber</b> for damped primary structure is also derived in this study to facilitate the estimation of the damping coefficient of TMD with nonlinear viscous damping and the head loss coefficient of LCVA. The derived results indicate that the higher the structural inherent damping the smaller the supplementary damping provided by a tuned <b>vibration</b> <b>absorber.</b> Furthermore, the optimal damping of tuned <b>vibration</b> <b>absorber</b> is shown to be independent of structural damping when it is tuned using the frequency tuning for harmonic load. Finally, the derived closed form expressions are demonstrated to be capable of predicting the optimal parameters of tuned vibration absorbers with sufficient accuracy for preliminary design of tuned vibration absorbers with nonlinear viscous damping for a damped primary structure.

They are susceptible to disturbances caused by vibrations and other mostly unwanted excitations. Hence the performance, lifetime and system behavior of the structures are negatively influenced. It is useful to equip systems with tuned <b>vibration</b> <b>absorbers</b> (TVA) to overcome these disadvantages. Attaching multiple distributed TVAs over the whole structure it is favorable to consider the interactions between them when deciding on adequate positions and designing parameters for these devices. An optimization of the positioning and the design parameters is necessary which take the dynamic behavior of the structure {{in combination with the}} effects of the TVAs into account. In this contribution optimization procedures are presented that perform the discrete positioning and the continuous parameter optimization for a number of <b>vibration</b> <b>absorbers</b> fixed to a truss structure. As an abstraction of complex light weight structures a 3 D truss structure is considered and the designed optimization process is exemplarily shown. In a predefined frequency range of interest (between 130 - 170 Hz) four modes are present, the first bending mode, the phase shifted bending mode, the first torsional mode and one truss structure specific rhombic mode.
