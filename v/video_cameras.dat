50|$|Nikon's first digital <b>camera</b> (still <b>video</b> <b>camera,</b> with analog storage) was the Nikon Still <b>Video</b> <b>Camera</b> (SVC) Model 1, a {{prototype}} which was first presented at photokina 1986. The follower Nikon QV-1000C Still <b>Video</b> <b>Camera</b> was produced since 1988 mainly for professional press use. Both cameras used QV mount lenses, {{a variant of}} Nikon F-mount lenses. Via an adapter (QM-100) other F-mount lenses can be fitted.|$|R
40|$|An {{automatic}} focusing system {{applied in}} USB <b>video</b> <b>camera</b> is introduced. The computer calculates video images captured by USB <b>video</b> <b>camera</b> through FFT operation for differential operation, {{so as to}} obtain its frequency data or differential data. The computer judges whether the lens of USB <b>video</b> <b>camera</b> is in defocusing position and moves the lens to the focusing position with a motor. The paper further discusses measures to improve automatic focusing accuracy. Experimental {{results show that the}} automatic focusing is a very good approach. The system will make the <b>video</b> <b>camera</b> with USB interface become simpler and more convenient. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
5|$|As was {{the usual}} method of BBC {{television}} drama production at the time, the play was produced in a multi-camera electronic studio on <b>video</b> <b>cameras,</b> although it was recorded as a 35mm film telerecording rather than on videotape. This 35mm master was released for junking in 1968, and no copy of the play is known to exist.|$|E
5|$|In April 2012, the WWF and International Rhino Foundation added 120 <b>video</b> <b>cameras</b> to the {{existing}} 40 to better monitor rhino movements and judge {{the size of the}} animals' population. A recent survey has found far fewer females than males. Only four females among 17 rhinos were recorded in the eastern half of Ujung Kulon, which is a potential setback in efforts to save the species.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} team of Top Value Television produced the documentary, using Portapak <b>video</b> <b>cameras.</b> The TVTV team followed Maharaj Ji across the United States {{over a period}} of six weeks, and edited a large amount of tape down to the fifty-eight-minute piece. It was the first documentary made on in (13mm) video tape broadcast nationally, and also the first independent video documentary shown on national public television.|$|E
5000|$|Sensor {{sizes are}} {{expressed}} in inches notation {{because at the time}} of the popularization of digital image sensors they were used to replace <b>video</b> <b>camera</b> tubes. The common 1" [...] circular <b>video</b> <b>camera</b> tubes had a rectangular photo sensitive area about 16mm diagonal, so a digital sensor with a 16 mm diagonal size was a 1" [...] video tube equivalent. The name of a 1" [...] digital sensor should more accurately be read as [...] "one inch <b>video</b> <b>camera</b> tube equivalent" [...] sensor. Current digital image sensor size descriptors are the <b>video</b> <b>camera</b> tube equivalency size, not the actual size of the sensor. For example, a 1" [...] sensor has a diagonal measurement of 16mm.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a new approach}} to visualization of scenarios within the use case-based engineering of functional requirements – the so-called <b>Video</b> <b>Camera</b> metaphor. The <b>Video</b> <b>Camera</b> metaphor facilitates involvement of business people, customers, problem domain experts and other non-technical stakeholders into capturing and validating formal requirements models. The key tool, supporting the <b>Video</b> <b>Camera</b> metaphor is the so-called Interface Editor which allows to draft the prototype user interface and automatically generates a user-friendly front-end to the set of formal modelling tools. The essence of the <b>Video</b> <b>Camera</b> interface is to associate sequences of events on a UML Sequence Diagram or an ITU-T Message Sequence Chart with sequences of activations of the elements of the generated user interface. The <b>Video</b> <b>Camera</b> interface allows capturing scenarios through direct activation of both the input and the output elements of the generated user interface. The generated user interface is also used to replay scenarios for validation purposes...|$|R
50|$|Sound {{recording}} and video recording is often also possible. Most {{people do not}} walk around with a <b>video</b> <b>camera,</b> but do carry a phone.

5|$|Evidence {{gathering}} CCTV – Some ambulances are {{now being}} fitted with <b>video</b> <b>cameras</b> used to record activity either inside or outside the vehicle. They may also be fitted with sound recording facilities. This {{can be used as}} a form of protection from violence against ambulance crews, or in some cases (dependent on local laws) to prove or disprove cases where a member of crew stands accused of malpractice.|$|E
5|$|Later Myst titles {{improved}} on {{the integration}} of live action sequences in the prerendered environments of the games. s developers filmed all the scenes using standard definition cameras, which producer Dan Irish would look back on as a mistake; without using high definition <b>video</b> <b>cameras,</b> the video did not look crisp at high resolutions. For the next game, , Ubisoft allowed players to move the game camera and interact with the video while it is playing {{through the use of}} the ALIVE game engine.|$|E
5|$|The {{play was}} made with {{electronic}} <b>video</b> <b>cameras,</b> although recorded onto film rather than tape. The only known copy of the play was junked in 1968, as was the standard practice of the time, {{despite the fact that}} Dylan and lead actor David Warner were by then famous. Although extensive searches have been made by the BBC, only partial audio recordings of four songs sung by Dylan survive.|$|E
5000|$|A camera operator, {{sometimes}} informally {{called a}} cameraman or a camerawoman, {{is a professional}} operator of a film or <b>video</b> <b>camera.</b> In filmmaking, the person designing the lighting is the cinematographer or director of photography, who is also informally called a [...] "cameraman" [...] {{though it is a}} different job. A camera operator in a video production may be known as a television <b>camera</b> operator, <b>video</b> <b>camera</b> operator, or videographer, depending on the context and technology involved, usually operating a professional <b>video</b> <b>camera.</b>|$|R

5|$|Reports {{indicated}} that Holloway {{did not appear}} on any nighttime surveillance camera footage of her hotel's lobby; however, Twitty has made varying statements {{as to whether the}} cameras were operational that night. According to an April 19, 2006, statement made by Twitty, the <b>video</b> <b>cameras</b> at the Holiday Inn were not functioning the night Holloway vanished. Twitty has made other statements indicating that they were working, and has stated so in her book.

5|$|The Boys from Baghdad High, {{also known}} as Baghdad High, is a British-American-French {{television}} documentary film. It was first shown in the United Kingdom at the 2007 Sheffield Doc/Fest, before airing on BBC Two on 8 January 2008. It also aired in many other countries including France, Australia, the United States, Canada, Germany and the Netherlands. It documents the lives of four Iraqi schoolboys of different religious or ethnic backgrounds {{over the course of}} one year {{in the form of a}} video diary. The documentary was filmed by the boys themselves, who were given <b>video</b> <b>cameras</b> for the project.|$|E
5|$|Impact {{events are}} {{continually}} occurring on the lunar surface. The most common events are {{those associated with}} micrometeorites, as might be encountered during meteor showers. Impact flashes from such events have been detected from multiple and simultaneous Earth-based observations. Tables of impacts recorded by <b>video</b> <b>cameras</b> exist for years since 2005 {{many of which are}} associated with meteor showers. Furthermore, impact clouds were detected following the crash of ESA's SMART-1 spacecraft, India's Moon Impact Probe and NASA's LCROSS. Impact events leave a visible scar on the surface, and these could be detected by analyzing before and after photos of sufficiently high resolution. No impact craters formed between the Clementine (global resolution 100 metre, selected areas 7-20 metre) and SMART-1 (resolution 50 metre) missions have been identified.|$|E

5|$|Producers chose {{boys who}} were {{students}} of Tariq bin Ziad High School. The school was {{holding on to the}} notion of a united Iraq, even as the country was becoming increasingly racially and religiously segregated. Having worked in Iraq in 2003, Winter knew that the Baghdad district Karrada was mixed and integrated with high numbers of Shiites and Christians. She asked her former driver and translator, who had attended the school, if he would contact the principal. Initially the school was suspicious of their intentions, but decided to trust the judgement of Winter's translator. Principal Ra'ad Jawad selected eight boys {{to take part in the}} documentary because he knew they could be discreet about making the documentary, would not get bored, and would remain committed to filming their lives for a year. The producers wanted their cast to include girls, and had found a school and families willing to take part in the documentary, but the then-Minister of Education refused to let them take part. Jawad travelled to London to meet the producers and he was trained to operate the <b>video</b> <b>cameras</b> that the boys were to use. The cameras and tapes were sent into Iraq via the BBC News department, which were then passed onto the school. Jawad and two Iraqi associate producers trained the boys how to use the cameras. Two months into filming, four of the boys dropped out of the project, leaving Hayder Khalid, Anmar Refat, Ali Shadman, and Mohammad Raed. O'Mahoney and Winter never met the boys while the documentary was being produced because it was such a high-risk assignment.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This study {{reviews the}} usage of the <b>video</b> <b>camera</b> {{as an adjunct to}} the {{practice}} of drama therapy, beginning with a review of the development of <b>video</b> <b>camera</b> technology and its past usage in the mental health profession, up to the practical usage of a <b>video</b> <b>camera</b> in drama therapy in the present. Studies from various disciplines will be presented from the past with a connection to the ability to use the technology in drama therapy work, noting limitations throughout. Care shall be employed in offering an ethical perspective to the future usage of a <b>video</b> <b>camera</b> in drama therapy by providing a critical analysis of the history of <b>video</b> <b>camera</b> usage within the mental health profession, and providing samples of ethical guidelines present in the creative arts therapies highlighting the need for further discussion and research of the topic. This paper will encourage the drama therapy profession to capitalize on a medium that is a natural addition to the tools and techniques of drama therapy work...|$|R
