40|$|A {{diffusion}} model {{of heat and}} mass transfer in moist porous media is obtained for low intensity convection drying found typically in food products and <b>vegetable</b> <b>dehydration.</b> The effective diffusivity was analyzed based on the coupled effects of moisture content and temperature on mass transfer in capillary flow, evaporation-condensation, and transition regions. The temperature effect {{was found to be}} significant in the transition and evaporation-condensation regions. The model was solved numerically using the finite difference method. Physical properties of banana were determined. The results show that the most intensive heat and mass transfer occur in the transition region where both capillary flow and vapor diffusion play a significant role. The length of the transition region is determined clearly by analyzing the liquid flux distribution in the material, its value depends very much on the permeability of the material. The model proves that the assumption of evaporation front is valid for drying of very permeable materials.

ABSTRACT: Natural gas processing is a complex industrial process designed to reduce impurities from raw natural gas by separation process to produce gas which is known as pipeline quality dry natural gas. In Titas Gas Field (Location #A), natural gas process plant is mainly designed to separate {{the water from the}} raw gas and make the gas transmittable to the consumer. Natural gas dehydration for Titas Gas Field mainly includes the separation of water from gas by Glycol Dehydration Process. Besides, a little amount of condensate is also separated during the dehydration process. Condensate of Titas Gas Field mainly contents hydrocarbon of C 3 -C 4. As the absorbent, TEG (Tri-Ethylene Glycol) is the most preferable to use. In this paper, we represent the design of the equipment using in the glycol <b>dehydration</b> <b>plant</b> of Titas Gas Field, Location #A. Equipment sizing means calculating optimum height, diameter, number of tray, capacity, circulation rate etc. of each equipment.
