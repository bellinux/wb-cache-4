5000|$|The {{variability}} of genomes {{can make the}} developed of a vaccine very difficult, and antigen variation cannot match pathogen variation. Reverse <b>vaccinology</b> is a novel approach that may develop vaccines to combat pathogens more effectively. Reverse <b>Vaccinology</b> has already been successfully applied to Neisseria meningitides, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Chlamydia spp. [...] Reverse <b>Vaccinology</b> applies not only to strain specific vaccines, but also the development of pan-genome vaccines. Lastly, comparative <b>vaccinology</b> attempts to compare the differences between pathogen and non-pathogen variants of a microbe to filter genes that are unique to the pathogen version. There are several vaccines developed through reverse <b>vaccinology</b> that are currently in clinical trials.|$|E
5000|$|Reverse <b>vaccinology</b> is an {{improvement}} on <b>vaccinology</b> that employs bioinformatics, pioneered by Rino Rappuoli and first used against Serogroup B meningococcus. [...] Since then, {{it has been}} used on several other bacterial vaccines.|$|E
50|$|After Craig Venter {{published}} the genome {{of the first}} free-living organism in 1995, the genomes of other microorganisms became more readily available throughout {{the end of the}} twentieth century. Reverse <b>vaccinology,</b> designing vaccines using the pathogen’s sequenced genome, came from this new wealth of genomic information, as well as technological advances. Reverse <b>vaccinology</b> is much more efficient than traditional <b>vaccinology,</b> which requires growing large amounts of specific microorganisms as well as extensive wet lab tests.|$|E

5000|$|The major {{advantage}} for reverse <b>vaccinology</b> is finding vaccine targets quickly and efficiently. Traditional methods may take decades to unravel pathogens and antigens, diseases and immunity. However, In silico {{can be very}} fast, allowing to identify new vaccines for testing {{in only a few}} years. [...] The downside is that only proteins can be targeted using this process. Whereas, conventional <b>vaccinology</b> approaches can find other biomolecular targets such as polysaccharides.|$|E

50|$|During the {{development}} of the MenB vaccine, scientists adopted the same Reverse <b>Vaccinology</b> methods for other bacterial pathogens. A Streptococcus and B Streptococcus vaccines were two of the first Reverse Vaccines created. Because those bacterial strains induce antibodies that react with human antigens, the vaccines for those bacteria needed to not contain homologies to proteins encoded in the human genome in order to not cause adverse reactions, thus establishing the need for genome-based Reverse <b>Vaccinology.</b>|$|E

50|$|Though using bioinformatic {{technology}} to develop vaccines has become typical {{in the past}} ten years, general laboratories often do not have the advanced software that can do this. However, there are a growing number of programs making reverse <b>vaccinology</b> information more accessible. NERVE is one relatively new dataprocessing program. Though it must be downloaded and does not include all epitope predictions, it does help save some time by combining the computational steps of reverse <b>vaccinology</b> into one program. Vaxign, an even more comprehensive program, was created in 2008. Vaxign is web-based and completely public-access.|$|E
