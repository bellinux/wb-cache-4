5|$|An {{additional}} eight {{members of}} the parliament are elected from the twelfth constituency. It encompasses the entire country; candidates in this constituency are elected by voters belonging to 22 recognized minorities in Croatia: the Serb minority elects three MPs, the Hungarians and Italians elect one MP each, the Czech and Slovak minorities jointly elect one MP, and all other minorities elect the final two MPs. Minority MPs are elected by simple plurality system (candidates with the most number of votes are elected). The nationality of the voters is listed in the voter registry, which {{is provided by the}} registrar's office that maintains Croatia's <b>vital</b> <b>records.</b> Voter nationalities are normally officially declared by the parents at birth, but any citizen may declare or change that information later on at the registrar's office at least 14 days ahead of elections (not at the polling station). The voter's nationality need not be declared or may be declared as unknown. During elections, voters who have officially declared they belong to one of the recognized minorities in Croatia may choose to vote for either a territorially applicable list or a corresponding national minority list; a voter of unknown or non-declared nationality may vote for either a territorially applicable list or any minority list; a voter who has declared a nationality other than Croat or a recognized minority may vote only for a territorially applicable list (the same as someone who has declared themselves a Croat).|$|E
5|$|Historical {{records for}} Gardner Carpenter's life are sparse in detail, but the <b>Vital</b> <b>records</b> of Norwich, 1659-1848 Part II provide some information. Gardner Carpenter married Mary Huntington, {{daughter}} of Benjamin Huntington Jr., on October 29, 1791. Carpenter {{was a local}} business man who operated his mercantile business in a shop that was shared with his brother, Joseph Carpenter, the silversmith. The Carpenters' shared shop is historically significant and {{is known as the}} Joseph Carpenter Silversmith Shop. A 1906 paper titled Norwich: early homes and history identified Gardner Carpenter as the builder of the store and noted that Gardner Carpenter {{was one of the first}} traders of Norwich. In 1793, the house which is now known as the Carpenter House was constructed on the property after a previous house on the land was removed. Gardner and Mary Carpenter would have six children together; their first son, George, was born in 1795 and their first and only daughter, Mary Elizabeth, in 1797. Another son, Gardner Carpenter, was born in 1802 and was followed by Henry in 1804, John in 1807 and Charles in 1810. Gardiner Carpenter served as a pay master in the 17th Connecticut Regiment in the American Revolutionary War and he was the postmaster of Norwich from 1799 to 1814, shortly before his death in 1815. His wife, Mary Carpenter, died in 1838. The house was sold to Joseph Huntington after Carpenter's death, who would add a third story around 1816. The house was sold again to Reverend Hiram P. Arms in 1841.|$|E

25|$|William Shakespeare was an actor, playwright, poet, and theatre {{entrepreneur}} in London {{during the}} late Elizabethan and early Jacobean eras. He was baptised on 26 April 1564 in Stratford-upon-Avon in Warwickshire, England, in the Holy Trinity Church. At age 18 he married Anne Hathaway {{with whom he had}} three children. He died in his home town of Stratford on 23 April 1616 at the age of 52. Though more is known about Shakespeare's life than those of most other Elizabethan and Jacobean writers, few personal biographical facts survive about him, which is unsurprising in the light of his social status as a commoner, the low esteem in which his profession was held, and the general lack of interest of the time in the personal lives of writers. Information about his life derives from public instead of private documents: <b>vital</b> <b>records,</b> real estate and tax records, lawsuits, records of payments, and references to Shakespeare and his works in printed and hand-written texts. Nevertheless, hundreds of biographies have been written and more continue to be, most of which rely on inferences and the historical context of the 70 or so hard facts recorded about Shakespeare the man, a technique that sometimes leads to embellishment or unwarranted interpretation of the documented record.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the ruling}} did not {{immediately}} issue an injunction directing state officials to stop enforcing the ban, clerks in the state's largest two counties, Milwaukee and Dane, began marrying same-sex couples on their own volition based on Judge Crabb's declaration. By the following business day, June 9, forty-two counties were issuing licenses. Wisconsin Attorney General J. B. Van Hollen filed for an emergency stay from Crabb to stop further marriages and also requested a stay from the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago. Crabb denied the emergency stay because she had not yet issued an injunction that could be stayed. She {{said that she had}} yet to decide whether county clerks can issue marriage licenses and that it was for state courts to decide if county clerks were issuing licenses in violation of state law. The Seventh Circuit also denied a stay because Crabb had not yet issued a final ruling. After consultations with the state's department of <b>vital</b> <b>records,</b> Brown and Sheboygan counties began performing same-sex marriages on June 9, though Outagamie and Door counties placed a five-day waiting period on applicants before performing ceremonies. In the case of counties performing ceremonies, the waiting period was waived with a payment of $25 in addition to the license fee to the county clerk. Sixty of Wisconsin's seventy-two counties were issuing licenses during the eight-day window.|$|E
