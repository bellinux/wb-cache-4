40|$|During {{the last}} decade new {{techniques}} for producing impure superfluids with unique properties have been developed. This new class of systems includes superfluid helium confined to aerogel, Hell with different impurities (D- 2, N- 2, Ne, Kr), superfluids in <b>Vycor</b> <b>glasses,</b> and watergel. These systems exhibit very unusual properties including unexpected acoustic features. We discuss the sound properties of these systems and show that sound phenomena in impure superfluids are modified from those in pure superfluids. We calculate the coupling between temperature and pressure oscillations for impure superfluids and for superfluid He in aerogel. We show that the coupling between these two sound modes is governed either by cpartial derivativep/partial derivativec or sigmarho(a) rho(s) (for aerogel) rather than thermal expansion coefficient partial derivativerho/partial derivativeT, which is enormously small in pure superfluids. This replacement plays {{a fundamental role in}} all sound phenomena in impure superfluids. It enhances the coupling between the two sound modes that leads to the existence of such phenomena as the slow mode and heat pulse propagation with the velocity of first sound observed in superfluids in aerogel. This means {{that it is possible to}} observe in impure superfluids such unusual sound phenomena as slow pressure (density) waves and fast temperature (entropy) waves. The enhancement of the coupling between the two sound modes decreases the threshold values for nonlinear processes as compared to pure superfluids. Sound conversion, which has been observed in pure superfluids only by shock waves should be observed at moderate sound amplitude in impure superfluids. Cerenkov emission of second sound by first sound (which never been observed in pure superfluids) could be observed in impure superfluids...|$|R

The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} the photophysical and photochemical properties of embedded solutes in porous <b>Vycor</b> <b>glass.</b> The emission and excitation spectra of quinoline and 2, 3 -dichloroquinoxaline embedded in a calcined (600 °C) porous <b>Vycor</b> <b>glass</b> and dissolved in different solvents were recorded at various temperatures. The spectral characteristics and phosphorescence lifetimes of adsorbates were observed to be identical with those in a 0. 5 N sulfuric acid solution, indicating proton transfer from the surface to the N-heterocyclics. The strong surface-adsorbate interaction is further revealed by the dynamic study of adsorbates at 77 K and 4. 2 K. Emission spectra and lifetimes at 77 K are reported for samples prepared by adsorbing benzo(c) cinnoline (9, 10 -diazaphenanthrene; 9, 10 -dp) in calcined <b>Vycor</b> <b>glass.</b> For <b>Vycor</b> <b>glass</b> calcined at 300, 400, 600, and 900 °C, the embedded species are identified as hydrogen-bonded 9, 10 -dp, protonated 9, 10 -dp, protonated dihydro- 9, 10 -dp, and protonated carbazole, respectively. The transformations are explained as resulting from {{an increase in the}} surface Brønsted acidity of <b>Vycor</b> <b>glass</b> upon calcination. The observed transformation is shown to be surface-induced in nature and occurs readily inside the porous <b>Vycor</b> <b>glass.</b> The low-temperature (77 K) emission technique has also been used to examine the photophysical properties of embedded benzophenone (BP), acetophenone (AP), and p-methoxyacetophenon (MAP) in the calcined <b>Vycor</b> <b>glass.</b> For all calcining temperatures, the <b>Vycor</b> <b>glass</b> only provided different polar environments for BP and AP. However, at the calcining temperatures of 600 °C and 900 °C, the surface-induced transformation of MAP was observed.

40|$|The {{processes}} of melting and solidification {{are determined to}} a large extent by microscopic conditions at the liquid-solid interface.

Measurements of magnetisation have also been made. The observations show that the restricted geometry provided by the high surface-area solid glass substrate can have a profound effect : in particular, it induces a high density (ρ > solid), high entropy phase which, although disordered, is probably mobile.

Cylindrical naphthalene wires (5 - 5000 nm radius) show a definite one- to three-dimensional transition (about 25 nm for triplet excitons at 4 K; 40 nm at 77 K). Nuclear channel pore membranes (polycarbonate) serve as templates and calibrators. The triplet exciton migration (multiple hopping) length is 50 - 100 molecules.

An accurate experimental monitoring of permeating vapors and condensates in small pores of membranes is very desirable. The dynamic permeation method {{is one of the}} methods which can be used to perform a corresponding study. The following experimental arrangement was applied: a constant higher pressure P 1 was set on an open side of the membrane; on the opposite closed side the change of a lower pressure P 2 was measured. The dynamic permeation set-up was used at first in transport measurements of a noncondensable gas through a <b>Vycor</b> <b>glass</b> membrane (mean pore radius around 2 nm). The obtained data were compared with the results of alternatively performed steady state permeation measurements. Subsequently, the permeability was studied for the condensable gas butane through the <b>Vycor</b> <b>glass</b> membrane, particularly for elevator pressure conditions near the saturated vapor pressure.

40|$|Dielectric {{spectroscopy}} {{has often}} been used to study confinement effects in alkylcyanobiphenyl liquid crystals. In this paper, we highlight some of the effects that have been discovered previously and add new data and interpretation. Aerosil nanoparticles form a hydrogen bonded random porous network. In dispersions of alkylcyanobiphenyls with aerosils, an additional slow process arises, that we ascribe to the relaxation of liquid crystal molecules in close interaction with these nanoparticles. Their relaxation is retarded by a hydrogen bond interaction between the cyano group of the liquid crystals and an aerosil surface hydroxyl group. A similar surface process is also observed in <b>Vycor</b> porous <b>glass,</b> a random rigid structure with small pores. A comparison of the temperature dependence of the relaxation times of the surface processes in decylcyanobiphenyl and isopentylcyanobiphenyl is made, both for Vycor and aerosil confinement. In decylcyanobiphenyl, the temperature dependence for the bulk and surface processes is Arrhenius (in a limited temperature range above the melting point), except in Vycor, where it is a Vogel–Fulcher–Tamman dependence (over a much broader temperature range). In bulk and confined isopentylcyanobiphenyl, the molecular processes have a Vogel–Fulcher–Tamman dependence, whereas the surface processes have an Arrhenius one. Another effect is the acceleration of the rotation around the short molecular axis in confinement, and particularly in aerosil dispersions. This {{is a consequence of}} the disorder introduced in the liquid crystalline phase. The disorder drives the relaxation time towards a more isotropic value, resulting in an acceleration for the short axis rotation. status: publishe...|$|R

The three test methods, mentioned above, were {{used to measure the}} permeability of <b>Vycor</b> <b>glass</b> and portland cement paste and the results of the HDP test were compared with the results from the SDP and RFT tests.

40|$|On vycorization, {{borosilicate}} glasses {{undergo a}} phase separation. The resulting two portions are topologically continuous {{and the most}} soluble B 2 O 3 -rich phase may be leached out. The nature of this interconnected matrix has been investigated relative to the stability of phases within the miscibility gap. The separation procedure has been interpreted by two different mechanisms, namely: nucleation and growth, and spinodal decomposition. The geometrical nature of the interface has been examined, too. In {{most of the cases}} it was suggested that the surface is fractal, while in a few others it was alluded a Euclidean one. By scrutinising the geometry of the surface boundary, it is possible to gain information on the morphology of the pore structure; In this dissertation, we report results on <b>Vycor</b> 7930 porous <b>glass</b> obtained by adsorption in conjunction with small-angle scattering of neutrons and x-rays (SANS and SAXS). In both cases, a number of scattering curves at various relative pressures (p/p 0) was determined. Contrast matching at the solid/film interface was attained too. For SANS the adsorbate was a mixture of 65 % D 2 O and 35 % H 2 O, whereas for SAXS it was CH 2 Br 2. For dry samples, a fractal interface with a fractal dimension D~ 2. 6 was estimated. Leached glasses are expected to exhibit a silica surface consisting of many dangling bonds. For H 2 O, the SANS data indicates a very low upper cut-off for the fractality in Vycor. Thus, a reaction between H 2 O and silica yielding a soft hydrogel is assumed. On the way to the surface, H 2 O molecules pass through a batch of dangling bonds hasping by hydrogen bonding and hauling down to the base line. On the surface, the adsorbed molecules condense within small cavities initiating the gelation process locally; a smooth surface is observed As p/p 0 increases the gelation process advances from local regions to the whole extent of the silica surface resulting to a diffuse boundary, i. e. D< 2. Opposite, the SAXS data suggests that CH 2 Br 2 defractalizes the Vycor surface rather ploddingly. This may be explained as follows. If the base line has D< 2. 5, where 2. 5 is a critical exponent, the molecular tiling will affect only the rough character of the surface and will leave invariant the fractal one. Therefore, deroughening rather than defractalization occurs. At p/p 0 ~ 0. 76 the adsorbed film acquires liquid-like properties and thus a smooth surface is observed. The surface morphology of a <b>Vycor</b> porous <b>glass</b> was examined by a dynamic technique, too. To this end, the Vycor diaphragm was loaded with water at various relative pressures (p/p 0), and after that He diffusivities were recorded. The shape of the curve suggests a PR-maximum at p/p 0 = 0. 3. This maximum can not be resolved by a trivial application of Knudsen theory. As adsorption progresses an amount of adsorbed water is deposited on the pore walls. Therefore, diameter will decrease by a value t corresponding to the thickness of the adsorbed film. and subsequently a PR-curve would be expected to decrease steadily as p/p 0, increases. At p/p 0 = 0. 3 the amount of water adsorbed within the Vycor matrix is equal to about 3 % w/w. The internal surface of dry Vycor is probably disturbed by a number of dangling bonds which give rise to a fractal character. When wet, the dangling bonds fall dawn rendering the surface smooth. A series of controlled porous glasses (CPGs) with pore sizes from 17 to 300 nm has been examined by very-small-angle neutron scattering (VSANS). The scattering curves show a peak in a range of Q values, depending on the particle size to the average pore size ratio. The entrapment of mercury in CPGs having undergone a complete intrusion}extrusion cycle has also been examined by VSANS. The peak positions do not vary for the mercury-loaded samples suggesting no structural changes due to the high intrusion pressures involved (60, 000 psi). It was concluded that an amount of mercury blobs is trapped within the cavities of the glasses. ...|$|R
40|$|We present neutron inelastic {{scattering}} {{measurements of the}} low energy excitations of superfluid " 4 He. Measurements on three types of superfluid system have been taken: Bulk superfluid, superfluid {{in the presence of}} static disorder (" 4 He confined in porous glasses) and superfluid in the presence of dynamic disorder (dilute " 3 He-" 4 He mixtures). For the bulk liquid, we find that the temperature dependence of the roton may be described well by the generally accepted BPZ theory [Bedell 1984], over the temperature region 0. 4 - 1. 8 K. However we also find our results to be in agreement with the high-resolution measurements of Andersen et al who reported a deviation from the BPZ theory at temperatures below 1 K [Andersen 1996]. We find that the energy of the maxon does surpass that of two times the roton energy at elevated pressure. This result cannot be explained simply from a theoretical point of view and we offer an explanation in terms of a hybridisation between the single particle excitation and the two-roton continuum. A high-resolution study of the roton when the superfluid is confined in porous aerogel glass shows the excitation to remain sharp down to temperatures of 0. 07 K. This result contradicts the results of previous studies [Gibbs 1997, Plantevin 1998] who found that the roton exhibited an anomalous linewidth at low temperatures. We present the first successful neutron scattering measurements of the superfluid confined in porous <b>Vycor</b> and xerogel <b>glasses.</b> We observe a sharp excitation with a dispersion almost identical to that of the phonon-roton excitation of the bulk liquid. We also observe extra scattering at energies below that of the bulk-like excitation. This scattering has been attributed to two-dimensional layer excitations previously only observed in neutron scattering studies of thin films of the superfluid adsorbed onto various forms of graphite substrate. High resolution studies of S(Q,#omega#) of a 1 % mixture of " 3 He in superfluid " 4 He reveals no large asymmetry of the scattering of the type theoretically predicted by Weyrauch and Szprynger [Weyrauch 1995]. However the phonon-roton peak does show a large increase in width at a wave-vector of 1. 79 A"-" 1 and a shift in energy which varies with Q. Such changes can be accounted for qualitatively by considering the three-phonon scattering process. However we are not able to account for the magnitudes of both of the changes using the same atomic potential. Finally further investigations are proposed for each of these different aspects of the dynamics of superfluid " 4 He.
