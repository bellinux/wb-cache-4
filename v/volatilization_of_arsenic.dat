How to dispose hyperaccumulators safely {{has been one of}} the most important issues in the phytoextraction field. In this paper, incineration technology was studied in order to investigate the feasibility of incineration technology on disposal of the arsenic-containing hyperaccumulator Pteris vittata L [...] The tube furnace experiment examined the changes of arsenic in Pteris vittata L., studied the effects of factors including temperature, time, percentage of CaO on the incineration state. The results show that the most appropriate incineration condition was temperature of 400 °C, time of 30 min, percentage of CaO of 10 %, which solved the problem to reduce biomass of Pteris vittata L. and <b>volatilization</b> <b>of</b> <b>arsenic.</b> The result provide insight into developing harm-less disposal or resource-reuse-oriented methods for disposal of the plants used for large scale phytore-mediation application...|$|E

40|$|Lab-scale {{pyrolysis}} {{experiments with}} weathered CCA treated wood chips {{have been performed}} {{and the influence of}} particle size, residence time (10 min- 40 min), heating rate (5 °C/min- 20 °C/min), temperature (330 °C- 430 °C) and pressure (0 bar, 5 bar) has been investigated. Few data, covering the pyrolysis of weathered wood was found in the literature and the literature data on pyrolysis experiments with a controlled CCA wood input, showed that results were often highly affected by experimental uncertainty. In order to reduce the uncertainty on the results, a thorough characterization of the wood input has been performed and a ratio method has been proposed which allows to study the effect of particle size on arsenic and chromium volatilization. Larger wood particles show a higher arsenic and chromium retention during pyrolysis which is attributed to the higher mass transfer resistance in these particles. Residence time has a limited effect on arsenic retentions. Increasing heating rate results in a limited increase in arsenic retentions and a more profound increase in chromium retentions. The latter is attributed to a lower average particle temperature during heating caused by the thermal lag in larger particles. Elevated pressure results in a significant increase <b>of</b> <b>arsenic</b> retentions, which is probably due to higher mass transfer resistance. Increasing temperature results in a slight decrease in arsenic retentions till 390 °C, with a sharp decrease at higher temperatures. Chromium retentions are less affected by increasing temperature, especially at higher temperatures. To conclude, a mechanism is proposed for the <b>volatilization</b> <b>of</b> chromium and <b>arsenic</b> during low temperature pyrolysis of CCA wood.

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of pyrolysis {{as a possible}} technique for disposing of CCA (chromium, copper and arsenic oxide) -treated wood was studied. A CCA-treated sample given an extra heat treatment at 450 °C for 10 min was thoroughly investigated {{in order to establish}} the details of the reaction in which arsenic is captured in the pyrolysis residue prior to volatilization. Composition and structure of the metal compounds in the pyrolysis residue were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). A large number of particles were found of variable diameter between 10 and 100 nm. The smaller ones were mostly spherical, sometimes faceted. The larger ones were lumpy. CCA compounds and their reaction products like Cr 2 As 4 O 12 and As 2 O 3 were identified in conventional TEM by selected area electron diffraction. In high resolution, the nanoparticles exhibited lattice fringes as indication of their monocrystalline character, fitting, e. g., the d 2 1 0 = 0. 204 nm of Cr.

More than 20 % <b>of</b> <b>arsenic</b> was already lost at 300 °C, which may have been caused mainly by the <b>volatilization</b> <b>of</b> the unreacted <b>arsenic</b> compound after reduction of As(V) in As 2 O 5 to As(III) in As 2 O 3.

The use of phytoextraction and phytovolatilization of metals by plants offers a viable remediation on commercial projects. Arsenic is of great environmental concern due to its extensive contamination and toxicity. Ma et al. (2001) recently discovered the first known and extremely efficient arsenic hyperaccumulating plant, Pteris vittata. If we can use phytovolatilization for As-contaminated soils, it could minimize the production of As-laden plant material and the duration of remediation.

40|$|In China, coal, {{often with}} a high level of sulfur, is always mixed with {{municipal}} solid waste (MSW) in waste incineration plants due to the low heating value and high moisture content of MSW. The influence of sulfur compounds on the <b>volatilization</b> <b>of</b> heavy metals in MSW is of great concern for China’s waste incineration plants. In this study, the continuous dynamic <b>volatilization</b> process <b>of</b> Pb and Cd is investigated by adding different forms of sulfur compounds, elemental sulfur (S), and sodium sulfate (Na 2 SO 4), to the simulated MSW in a laboratory incinerator, at both 1 and 3 wt %, respectively. The experimental results show that the added S begins to affect the <b>volatilization</b> <b>of</b> Pb and Cd at about 700 °C; adding S can lead up to 49. 6 % reduction in the <b>volatilization</b> <b>of</b> Pb, as the produced sulfur dioxide is promoting the formation of a condensed sulfate phase, and part of Pb is fixed in the form of PbS in the bottom ash. But for Cd, adding S causes up to 15. 9 % increase in its volatilization as S seizes part of O 2 in the air, which is conducive to forming the reducing atmosphere. In the reducing atmosphere, CdO can be easily reduced to Cd, which volatilizes more easily than CdO at high temperatures.

To address concerns with arsenic release under these disposal conditions, this research characterized the stability <b>of</b> <b>arsenic</b> wastes during two alternative disposal strategies.

These results show that concrete stabilization can be a viable disposal option to limit arsenic release when low pH can be avoided. Cow dung mixing has been recommended based {{on the ability of}} microorganisms to create volatile arsine gases that can be subsequently diluted to safe levels in the atmosphere. However, {{little is known about the}} extent <b>of</b> <b>volatilization</b> or the microbial communities responsible for this transformation.

The free concentration of diazepam was 11 % in absence <b>of</b> <b>arsenic</b> whereas this release was up to 50 % when arsenic was added to BSA with an increasing concentration from 0. 5 x 10 - 5 to 10 x 10 - 5 M. This site-specific probe displacement data implied that site-I (warfarin site) is low affinity site while site-II (diazepam site) is high affinity site <b>of</b> <b>arsenic</b> to the BSA...|$|R
40|$|The {{concomitant}} occurrence {{and reported}} discrepant behavior <b>of</b> uranium and <b>arsenic</b> in water bodies {{is a major}} health and environmental concern. This study combined batch and column experiments, hydrogeochemical simulations and XAFS spectroscopy to uncover the exchange mechanisms governing uranium fate between water and scrap metallic iron, minerals and Shewanella putrefaciens surfaces in the presence <b>of</b> <b>arsenic.</b> The main results suggest that both water chemistry and the solid phase composition influence uranium fate in the presence <b>of</b> <b>arsenic.</b> The importance <b>of</b> uranyl-arsenate species as a major control of uranium behavior in the presence <b>of</b> <b>arsenic</b> is shown. The toxicity <b>of</b> <b>arsenic</b> {{and the presence of}} nitrate are interpreted as limiting factors of the enzymatic reduction of both toxins. Besides, XANES fingerprinting and EXAFS modeling have confirmed precipitation/co-precipitation of uranyl-arsenates as a major mechanism controlling uranium behavior in the presence <b>of</b> <b>arsenic...</b>|$|R
