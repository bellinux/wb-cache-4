Herein, we present a patient with progressive portal <b>vein</b> tumor <b>thrombosis</b> without liver parenchymal invasion following curative resection.|$|R
50|$|In non-parenchymal NBD, {{vascular}} complications such as cerebral {{venous thrombosis}} primarily occurs. Other distinct characteristics include intracranial aneurysm and extracranial aneurysm. In most cases, veins {{are much more}} likely to be affected than arteries. Venous sinus thrombosis is the most frequent vascular manifestation in NBD followed by cortical cerebral <b>veins</b> <b>thrombosis.</b> On the other hand, thrombosis and aneurysms of the large cerebral arteries are rarely reported.|$|R
40|$|A case of {{advanced}} multiple hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) with portal <b>vein</b> tumor <b>thrombosis</b> successfully treated by oral tegafur/uracil is reported. A 69 -year-old Japanese woman with advanced HCC with tumor thrombosis underwent transcatheter arterial infusion chemotherapy in April 2001. However, 1 year later, the patient experieced a recurrence with advanced multiple HCC with portal <b>vein</b> tumor <b>thrombosis</b> and ascites. Treatment with oral tegafur/uracil {{was started in}} May 2002 and resulted in the partial response of liver tumors and the complete improvement of ascites.

This case strongly suggests that oral tegafur/uracil is an effective treatment for some cases {{of advanced}} HCC with portal <b>vein</b> tumor <b>thrombosis...</b>|$|R
5|$|Pregnancy is {{associated}} with greater-than-normal risks in women with SCI, among them increased risk of deep <b>vein</b> <b>thrombosis,</b> respiratory infection, and urinary tract infection. Considerations exist such as maintaining proper positioning in a wheelchair, prevention of pressure sores, and increased difficulty moving due to weight gain and changes in center of balance. Assistive devices {{may need to be}} altered and medications changed.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{potential}} clinical {{consequences of the}} presence of an axillary arch including confusing the identification and palpation of enlarged or tumorous lymph nodes, the trapping of axillary structures including the axillary nerve and the axillary vein and causing potential problems in axillary surgery or breast reconstruction. There have also been reported instances of the axillary arch being involved in the development of deep <b>vein</b> <b>thrombosis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Deep <b>vein</b> <b>{{thrombosis}},</b> or deep {{venous thrombosis}} (DVT), is {{the formation of a}} blood clot (thrombus) within a deep vein, most commonly the legs. Nonspecific signs may include pain, swelling, redness, warmness, and engorged superficial veins. Pulmonary embolism, a potentially life-threatening complication, is caused by the detachment (embolization) of a clot that travels to the lungs. Together, DVT and pulmonary embolism constitute a single disease process known as venous thromboembolism. Post-thrombotic syndrome, another complication, significantly contributes to the health-care cost of DVT.|$|E
40|$|Thymic {{tumors are}} rare mediastinal tumors that can present {{with a wide}} variety of symptoms. They can cause distant manifestations and are {{frequently}} associated with paraneoplastic syndromes. In our case, we describe the evolution of a 68 -year-old male whose first manifestation was thrombosis of the inferior vena cava and renal <b>veins.</b> <b>Thrombosis</b> of large abdominal veins is rare, especially without being associated with any other comorbidity or risk factors...|$|R
50|$|Budd-Chiari {{syndrome}} is most commonly diagnosed using ultrasound {{studies of the}} abdomen and retrograde angiography. Ultrasound may show obliteration of hepatic <b>veins,</b> <b>thrombosis</b> or stenosis, spiderweb vessels, large collateral vessels, or a hyperechoic cord replacing a normal vein. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is sometimes employed although these methods are generally not as sensitive. Liver biopsy is nonspecific but sometimes necessary to differentiate between Budd-Chiari syndrome and other causes of hepatomegaly and ascites, such as galactosemia or Reye's syndrome.|$|R
30|$|Aggressive {{surgical}} resection {{should be}} considered in cases of portal <b>vein</b> tumor <b>thrombosis.</b> A good long-term prognosis could be obtained by a combination of curative resection and systemic chemotherapy.|$|R
5|$|The {{procedure}} {{should not}} be used without a medical indication, such as with a reason to expect that a person is at heightened risk of having deep <b>vein</b> <b>thrombosis.</b> This screening is not effective at diagnosing DVT in the absence of other indications that the patient may have this condition. A common example of overuse of this procedure is the practice of performing ultrasonography routinely on patients without indication after knee or hip replacement.|$|E
5|$|The {{vascular}} (blood) {{system can}} be impacted by solid tumors. Between 15 and 25 percent of deep <b>vein</b> <b>thrombosis</b> is caused by cancer (often by a tumor compressing a vein), {{and it may be}} the first hint that cancer is present. It causes swelling and pain in the legs, especially the calf, and (rarely) in the arms. The superior vena cava (a large vein carrying circulating, de-oxygenated blood into the heart) may be compressed by a tumor, causing superior vena cava syndrome, which can cause chest wall pain among other symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Thrombophilia (sometimes {{hypercoagulability}} or a prothrombotic state) is an abnormality {{of blood}} coagulation {{that increases the}} risk of thrombosis (blood clots in blood vessels). Such abnormalities can be identified in 50% of people who have an episode of thrombosis (such as deep <b>vein</b> <b>thrombosis</b> in the leg) that was not provoked by other causes. A significant proportion of the population has a detectable abnormality, but most of these only develop thrombosis in the presence of an additional risk factor.|$|E
50|$|Budd-Chiari {{syndrome}} {{is a condition}} caused by blockage of the hepatic <b>veins</b> (including <b>thrombosis)</b> that drain the liver. It presents with the classical triad of abdominal pain, ascites and liver enlargement.|$|R
40|$|In recent reports, {{cerebral}} <b>vein</b> and sinus <b>thrombosis</b> has had {{a better}} long-term prognosis than previously thought. However, there may be long-term problems that have not attracted enough attention. The aim of this chapter {{is to examine the}} literature for studies reporting long-term prognosis and outcome after cerebral <b>vein</b> and sinus <b>thrombosis.</b> The long-term prognosis after cerebral <b>vein</b> and sinus <b>thrombosis</b> mainly depends on underlying diseases, e. g. cancer. If no serious underlying disease is present, the long-term prognosis is generally good. However, death, impaired functional outcome, headache, epileptic seizures, cognitive impairment and recurrent thrombosis occur in some patients. Although the general long-term prognosis after cerebral <b>vein</b> and sinus <b>thrombosis</b> is good, the practicing clinician handling these patients should be aware of certain complications that are not uncommon. Follow-up of these patients is important, even if they initially seem to have recovered completely...|$|R
40|$|Over a 4 -year interval, 324 {{arteriovenous}} conduits {{were created}} in 256 patients with end-stage renal disease as access for chronic hemodialysis. These included 154 Cimino fistulae, 163 polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts, and seven miscellaneous grafts. Satisfactory patency rates were demonstrated {{for as long as}} 4 years for both Cimino fistulae and PTFE grafts by life-table analysis. Failures of Cimino fistulae usually occurred early in the postoperative period, secondary to attempts to use inadequate <b>veins.</b> <b>Thrombosis</b> caused the majority of PTFE graft failures and was generally the result of venous stenosis. Correction of such venous stenosis is mandatory to restore graft patency and can result in prolonged graft survival...|$|R
5|$|Warfarin, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Coumadin among others, is a {{medication}} that is used as an anticoagulant (blood thinner). It is commonly used to treat blood clots such as deep <b>vein</b> <b>thrombosis</b> and pulmonary embolism and to prevent stroke in people who have atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease or artificial heart valves. Less commonly it is used following ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and orthopedic surgery. It is generally taken by mouth but may also be used by injection into a vein.|$|E
5|$|A {{pulmonary}} embolism is {{a blood clot}} that becomes lodged in the pulmonary arteries. The majority of emboli arise because of deep <b>vein</b> <b>thrombosis</b> in the legs. Pulmonary emboli may be investigated using a ventilation/perfusion scan, a CT scan of the arteries of the lung, or blood tests such as the D-dimer. Pulmonary hypertension describes an increased pressure {{at the beginning of}} the pulmonary artery that has a large number of differing causes. Other rarer conditions may also affect the blood supply of the lung, such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis, which causes inflammation of the small blood vessels of the lungs and kidneys.|$|E
5|$|A {{very small}} {{proportion}} (those affected by SMAD4 (MADH4) mutations, see below) have multiple benign polyps {{in the large}} intestine, which may bleed or transform into colorectal cancer. A similarly small proportion experiences pulmonary hypertension, a state in which the pressure in the lung arteries is increased, exerting pressure {{on the right side}} of the heart and causing peripheral edema (swelling of the legs), fainting and attacks of chest pain. It has been observed that the risk of thrombosis (particularly venous thrombosis, in the form of deep <b>vein</b> <b>thrombosis</b> or pulmonary embolism) may be increased. There is a suspicion that those with HHT may have a mild immunodeficiency and are therefore at a slightly increased risk from infections.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} {{conditions}} associated with thrombophilia are deep <b>vein</b> <b>thrombosis</b> (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), which {{are referred to}} collectively as venous thromboembolism (VTE). DVT usually occurs in the legs, and is characterized by pain, swelling and redness of the limb. It may lead to long-term swelling and heaviness due to damage to valves in the veins. The clot may also break off and migrate (embolize) to arteries in the lungs. Depending on the size {{and the location of}} the clot, this may lead to sudden-onset shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations and may be complicated by collapse, shock and cardiac arrest.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} symptom of HIT is {{enlargement}} or extension of a previously diagnosed blood clot, or {{the development of}} a new blood clot elsewhere in the body. This may take the form of clots either in arteries or veins, causing arterial or venous thrombosis, respectively. Examples of arterial thrombosis are stroke, myocardial infarction ("heart attack"), and acute leg ischemia. Venous thrombosis may occur in the leg or arm in the form of deep <b>vein</b> <b>thrombosis</b> (DVT) and in the lung in the form of a pulmonary embolism (PE); the latter usually originate in the leg but migrate to the lung.|$|E
5|$|Stabilizing {{the person}} is the first priority. Those with a {{depressed}} level of consciousness {{may need to be}} intubated and mechanically ventilated. Blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and Glasgow Coma Scale are monitored frequently. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, admission to an intensive care unit may be preferable, especially since 15 percent may have further bleeding soon after admission. Nutrition is an early priority, with by mouth or nasogastric tube feeding being preferable over parenteral routes. In general, pain control is restricted to less-sedating agents such as codeine, as sedation may impact on the mental status and thus interfere with the ability to monitor the level of consciousness. Deep <b>vein</b> <b>thrombosis</b> is prevented with compression stockings, intermittent pneumatic compression of the calves, or both. A bladder catheter is usually inserted to monitor fluid balance. Benzodiazepines may be administered to help relieve distress. Antiemetic drugs should be given to awake persons.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAim of the workTo {{evaluate}} the cardiovascular findings in Behçet’s disease (BD) {{and assess the}} levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to study its relation {{to the extent of}} cardiovascular involvement. Patients and methodsThirty patients with BD were included in the study; 24 males and 6 females. Twenty age and sex matched healthy volunteers served as controls. All subjects were assessed clinically. The cardiovascular disorders were assessed by clinical examination, chest X-ray, electrocardiography, echocardiography, and lower extremity Doppler ultrasonography. Further investigations were performed for selected patients (stress ECG, chest computed tomography and coronary angiography). Routine laboratory investigations and serum level of VEGF were performed. Disease activity was assessed using Behçet’s Disease Current Activity Form (BDCAF). Results 40 % of our patients had vascular complications, where 25 % had only DVT, 16. 7 % had only large <b>veins</b> <b>thrombosis,</b> 16. 7 % had both deep and large <b>veins</b> <b>thrombosis,</b> 16. 7 % patients had both DVT and cardiac lesions, 10 % showed arteritis with aneurysms. Cardiac involvement was detected in 8 patients (26. 7 %), where 13. 3 % had mitral regurge, 3. 3 % had mitral valve prolapse, 3. 3 % had aortic regurge, 3. 3 % had tricuspid regurge, 3. 3 % had right ventricular thrombus with right bundle branch block and 3. 3 % had antro-septal myocardial infarction. Serum levels of VEGF were significantly higher (p< 0. 001) in patients (301. 2 ± 134. 5 pg/ml) than in controls (61. 4 ± 52. 5 pg/ml). The mean VEGF level significantly correlated with the BDCAF. ConclusionsAssessment of the cardiovascular system is advised in all patients with BD. The association between VEGF and cardiovascular involvement suggests a role for VEGF in the cardiovascular etiopathogenesis in Behçet’s disease...|$|R
5|$|The {{procedure}} requested, for {{an investigation}} into the hemodynamic changes in a patient with chronic venous insufficiency, which results in chronic venous disease, is quite different from an examination request made for suspected deep <b>vein</b> <b>thrombosis.</b> For a DVT investigation {{there is a need for}} guidance as to what to look for and to the intended treatment. An investigation performed with the intention of treating the patient by vein stripping or laser therapy for example is very different from the examination performed with the intention of executing a CHIVA. This French originated procedure is also spelt out as conservative hemodynamic treatment for chronic venous insufficiency. A CHIVA is an ultrasound guided, minimally invasive surgery strategic for the treatment of varicose veins, performed under local anaesthetic.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are used}} recreationally and by {{problematic}} drug misusers. Mortality is higher among poly-drug misusers that also use benzodiazepines. Heavy alcohol use also increases mortality among poly-drug users. Dependence and tolerance, often coupled with dosage escalation, to benzodiazepines can develop rapidly among drug misusers; withdrawal syndrome may appear after {{as little as}} three weeks of continuous use. Long-term use {{has the potential to}} cause both physical and psychological dependence and severe withdrawal symptoms such as depression, anxiety (often to the point of panic attacks), and agoraphobia. Benzodiazepines and, in particular, temazepam are sometimes used intravenously, which, if done incorrectly or in an unsterile manner, can lead to medical complications including abscesses, cellulitis, thrombophlebitis, arterial puncture, deep <b>vein</b> <b>thrombosis,</b> and gangrene. Sharing syringes and needles for this purpose also brings up the possibility of transmission of hepatitis, HIV, and other diseases. Benzodiazepines are also misused intranasally, which may have additional health consequences. Once benzodiazepine dependence has been established, a clinician usually converts the patient to an equivalent dose of diazepam before beginning a gradual reduction program.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) {{inhibits}} post-interventional stenosis in balloon-injured arteries, but causes thrombosis {{when applied}} to vein grafts. This may result from added free radicals produced during the hypoxiareperfusion injury of vein graft implantation. The {{purposes of this study}} were to determine whether a free radical scavenger could inhibit <b>vein</b> graft <b>thrombosis,</b> enabling PDT to inhibit intimal hyperplasia; and to investigate the role of neutrophils, also a source of radicals, in this setting. Methods: Jugular vein bypass grafts of the common carotid artery were performed in rats. PDT was administered in situ to the vein graft and artery in {{the presence or absence of}} deferoxamine (DFX), an OH scavenger. Results: PDT alone induced thrombosis in all untreated vein grafts. DFX administration or inhibition of neutrophil adhesion to the graft prevented PDT-induced <b>vein</b> graft <b>thrombosis.</b> Moreover, DFX given together with PDT significantly decreased vein graft intimal hyperplasia (0. 010 mm 2 0. 005 mm 2; P <. 002) as compared with DFX alone (0. 113 mm 2 0. 009 mm 2) or untreated control animals (0. 112 0. 007 mm 2). Conclusions: OH radicals and neutrophils both have key roles in PDT-induced <b>vein</b> graft <b>thrombosis.</b> By inhibiting free radical production or neutrophil adhesion to the graft, adequate PDT can be administered for successful inhibition of vein graft intimal hyperplasia.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the prevalence and morphologic helical computed tomography (CT) features of peripancreatic vascular abnormalities {{in patients with}} acute pancreatic inflammatory disease in correlation with {{the severity of the}} pancreatitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and fifty-nine contrast-enhanced helical CT scans of 100 consecutive patients with acute pancreatitis were retrospectively and independently reviewed by three observers. CT scans were scored using the CT severity index (CTSI) : pancreatitis was graded as mild (0 - 2 points), moderate (3 - 6 points), and severe (7 - 10 points). Interobserver agreement for both the CT severity index and the presence of peripancreatic vascular abnormalities was calculated (K-statistic). Correlation between the prevalence of complications and the degree of pancreatitis was estimated using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: The severity of pancreatitis was graded as mild (n = 59 scans), moderate (n = 82 scans), and severe (n = 18 scans). Venous abnormalities detected included splenic <b>vein</b> (SV) <b>thrombosis</b> (31 scans, 19 patients), superior mesenteric <b>vein</b> (SMV) <b>thrombosis</b> (20 scans, 14 patients), and portal <b>vein</b> (PV) <b>thrombosis</b> (17 scans, 13 patients). Arterial hemorrhage occurred in five patients (6 scans). In our series, no cases of arterial pseudoaneurysm formation were detected.
