50|$|A <b>Van</b> <b>Hove</b> <b>{{singularity}}</b> is a singularity (non-smooth point) in {{the density}} of states (DOS) of a crystalline solid. The wavevectors at which Van Hove singularities occur are {{often referred to as}} critical points of the Brillouin zone. For three-dimensional crystals, they take the form of kinks (where {{the density of}} states is not differentiable). The most common application of the <b>Van</b> <b>Hove</b> <b>singularity</b> concept comes in the analysis of optical absorption spectra. The occurrence of such singularities was first analyzed by the Belgian physicist Léon Van Hove in 1953 for the case of phonon densities of states.|$|E

Using Raman spectroscopy, we monitor {{the evolution of the}} electronic band structure upon doping using the G peak area which is enhanced when the laser photon energy is resonant with the energy separation of the <b>van</b> <b>Hove</b> <b>singularities.</b> Upon charge doping, the Raman G peak area initially increases for twist angles larger than a critical angle and decreases for smaller angles.

40|$|We have {{performed}} low-temperature photoluminescence and photoluminescence excitation (PLE) measurements on highly degenerate p-type GaAs and InyGa 1 -yAs quantum wells. In the PLE {{spectrum of the}} GaAs well, evidence of a second-order <b>van</b> <b>Hove</b> <b>singularity</b> in the joint density of states of the ground-state light-hole and electron bands is found. This singularity results from the equality of ground-state light-hole and electron effective masses near the G point, being a much more restrictive demand than the usual condition for a <b>van</b> <b>Hove</b> <b>singularity,</b> which requires only the equality of first derivatives of the subband dispersions. The second-order <b>van</b> <b>Hove</b> <b>singularity</b> {{gives rise to a}} power-law divergence at the singular point, whereas the corresponding usual <b>van</b> <b>Hove</b> <b>singularity</b> results in a steplike discontinuity in the joint density of states. The observed singularity could be described extremely well by a simple analytical model. The increased energy gap between light- and heavy-hole ground states in the compressively strained InyGa 1 -yAs well enhances the valence-band parabolicity, resulting in the disappearance of the <b>van</b> <b>Hove</b> <b>singularity.</b> Furthermore, it is shown that the anisotropic character of the heavy-hole ground state in GaAs is strongly suppressed in the InyGa 1 -yAs system.

We show theoretically that proximity to the <b>van</b> <b>Hove</b> <b>singularity</b> suppresses the inelastic scattering due to the gauge field and permits the formation of a d-wave RVB state in which the gap exists only near the van Hove points while finite regions of the Fermi surface remain gapless. This $d$-wave pairing provides a natural explanation of the pseudogap observed in photoemission. We also discuss the relation of the pseudogap observed in the spectral function to the pseudogaps observed in the magnetic susceptibility.

40|$|The charge instabilities of {{electron}} {{systems in}} the square lattice are analyzed near the <b>Van</b> <b>Hove</b> <b>singularity</b> {{by means of a}} wilsonian renormalization group approach. We show that the method preserves the spin rotational invariance at all scales, allowing a rigorous determination of spin and charge instabilities of the t-t' Hubbard model. For t' above ≈ 0. 276 t, repulsive interactions fall into two different universality classes. One of them has nonsingular response functions in the charge sector, while the other is characterized by the splitting of the <b>Van</b> <b>Hove</b> <b>singularity.</b> At the level of marginal perturbations, the Hubbard model turns out to be at the boundary between the two universality classes, while extended models with nearest-neighbor repulsive interactions belong to the latter class. In the case of open systems allowed to exchange particles with a reservoir, we show the existence of a range of fillings forbidden above and below the <b>Van</b> <b>Hove</b> <b>singularity.</b> This has the property of attracting the Fermi level in the mentioned range, as the system reaches its lowest energy when the Fermi energy is at the singularity.

A gradual enhancement of the electronic part of specific heat and a more drastic increase of the static magnetic susceptibility were observed in Sr 2 -yLayRuO 4 with increasing y. Furthermore, the quasi-two-dimensional Fermi-liquid behavior seen in pure Sr 2 RuO 4 breaks down near the critical concentration y(c) similar to 0. 20. Combined with a realistic tight-binding model with rigid-band shift of Fermi level, the enhancement of the density of states can be ascribed to the elevation of the Fermi energy toward a <b>van</b> <b>Hove</b> <b>singularity</b> of the thermodynamically dominant gamma Fermi-surface sheet. On approaching the <b>van</b> <b>Hove</b> <b>singularity,</b> the effective nesting vector of the gamma band shrinks and further enhances the susceptibility near the wave vector qsimilar to 0.
