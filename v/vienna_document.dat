50|$|The <b>Vienna</b> <b>Document</b> is an {{agreement}} between the participating states of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe which was intended to implement confidence and security building measures.

This exchange differs from the Global Exchange of Military Information {{in that it is}} limited to forces in Europe, while the Global Exchange of Military Information applies to all forces of the participating states, wherever located. The annual exchange of information was conducted concurrently with the annual exchange of information under the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty, in Vienna, Austria in December of each year.

In recent years, the Judenplatz museum has hosted contemporary art exhibitions with a spiritual or specifically Jewish theme, such as installations by notable Austrian artist Zenita Komad and several photography exhibitions, most recently a photo essay on Vienna's small but thriving Jewish community by Josef Polleross.|$|R

50|$|The Slovaks made {{demands that}} their culture be spared Magyarization {{and that they}} be given certain liberties and rights.

50|$|The Joint Arms Control Implementation Group (abbreviated as JACIG) is a {{specialist}} defence component affiliated to UK Joint Forces Command; which carries out {{a range of}} arms control and verification functions (including inspection, evaluation, escort and training duties). JACIG was originally based at RAF Scampton (just north of Lincoln); established in 1990, it was declared by the MOD as operational on 1 January 1991. Originally it was formed to performing treaty associated tasks {{as part of the}} UK's commitment to post Cold War confidence building associated with the <b>Vienna</b> <b>Document</b> and the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE Treaty).

50|$|On November 18, 1990, {{on the eve}} of the Paris Summit {{where the}} Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty and the <b>Vienna</b> <b>Document</b> on Confidence and Security-Building Measures (CSBMs) were signed, Soviet data were {{presented}} under the so-called initial data exchange. This showed a rather sudden emergence of three so-called coastal defence divisions (including the 3rd at Klaipėda in the Baltic Military District, the 126th in the Odessa Military District and seemingly the 77th Guards Motor Rifle Division with the Northern Fleet), along with three artillery brigades/regiments, subordinate to the Soviet Navy, which had previously been unknown as such to NATO. Much of the equipment, which was commonly understood to be treaty limited (TLE) was declared to be part of the naval infantry. The Soviet argument was that the CFE excluded all naval forces, including its permanently land-based components. The Soviet Government eventually became convinced that its position could not be maintained.|$|E
50|$|Zapad 2017 («Запад-2017», Захад-2017) is {{a planned}} joint {{strategic}} military {{exercise of the}} armed forces of the Russian Federation and Belarus (the Union State) scheduled for 14—20 September 2017, to be held in Belarus and Russia′s Kaliningrad Oblast and other north-western areas. According to the information made publicly available by Defence Minister of Belarus Andrei Ravkov in July 2017, fewer than 13,000 personnel of the Union State are {{to take part in the}} military maneuvers, a number that does not trigger mandatory formal notification and invitation of observers under the OSCE′s <b>Vienna</b> <b>Document.</b> Western analysts, however, believed in July 2017 that the total number of Russian troops, security personnel and civilian officials to be involved in the broader war-games will range from 60,000 to 100,000, which would make them Russia′s largest since the Cold War. Since 2016, concerns have been voiced in a number of NATO countries over Russia′s suspected ulterior motives and objectives in connection with the exercise.|$|E

50|$|Therefore, {{there is}} a {{persisting}} need to put arms control agreements into proper perspective. The central jurisprudential theme of this study adopts this perspective and investigates the role of -and interactions with- the institutions and mechanisms of general international law in the negotiation, operation, verification and enforcement of arms control agreements. The general jurisprudential thesis {{of the study is}} that, being part of and subject to general international law, the law of arms control cannot provide a technical guarantee against the occurrence of wars. This is because the weakness of general international law itself is not due to technical reasons: International law {{is a function of the}} political community of nations, the defects of which are due to the embryonic character of the community in which it functions, not due to its technical shortcomings. International law after more than four centuries of systematized experience cannot claim to have found an effective and consistently reliable anti-dote against determined aggressors or violators ultimately outside that of self-help. Arms control negotiations and agreements mitigate the insecurity in which the States in world arena find themselves as a result of this ultimately individual responsibility to self-preservation. If armaments are about deterrence, arms control is about reassurance, he stated, before he went on to an exhaustive study of the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty and the <b>Vienna</b> <b>Document</b> on Confidence and Security Building Measures in Europe.|$|E
5000|$|Against this background, {{he argued}} that [...] "the {{bountiful}} miscellany of arms control agreements provide a vast resource, for monitoring all the above courses of development in international law. Indeed, as far as new forms of obligations are concerned, the <b>Vienna</b> <b>Document</b> on Confidence and Security Building Measures in Europe concluded {{in the framework of}} a process based on a citadel of non-legally binding written arrangements: the Helsinki Final Act, distinguishes {{as one of the most}} pertinent politically binding agreements existing. The traditional approach, in this context, is represented by the 1990 CFE Treaty. Regarding new subject-areas, admittedly, the subject matter of these agreements is certainly not original. Their creative components are to be sought rather in their contents, although the contents of international agreements do not form part of international law per se. Arms control in general provides an original perspective into national security policy emphasizing cooperation and multilateralism in place of unconditional competition. Flowing from this pivotal idea, arms control agreements treat their contents in a systematic and cumulative fashion, each breakthrough being maintained and institutionalized not only at the follow-up agreements, but also at other arms control arenas. Ultimately, they are part of the effort contributing to the progressive development of international laws at a subject which is not yet covered by the classical definitions of international law. In so doing, they are not only reflecting thinking de lege feranda, but producing legally and politically binding international written agreements that create expectations and obligations for compliance (de lege lata) in an area as fundamental as national and international security." ...|$|E

From about 1870 onwards Millstatt developed from a sedate village to a fashionable summer resort for the nobility and the wealthy bourgeoisie of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
