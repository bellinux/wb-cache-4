50|$|There exist {{two main}} passive control types for satellites. The first one uses gravity gradient, and {{it leads to}} four stable states with the long axis (axis with {{smallest}} moment of inertia) pointing towards Earth. As this system has four stable states, if the satellite has a preferred orientation, e.g. a camera pointed at the planet, some way to flip the satellite and its tether end-for-end is needed. The other passive system orients the satellite along Earth's magnetic field thanks to a magnet. These purely passive attitude control systems have limited pointing accuracy, because the spacecraft will oscillate around energy minima. This drawback is overcome by adding damper, which can be hysteretic materials or a <b>viscous</b> <b>damper.</b> The <b>viscous</b> <b>damper</b> is a small can or tank of fluid mounted in the spacecraft, possibly with internal baffles to increase internal friction. Friction within the damper will gradually convert oscillation energy into heat dissipated within the <b>viscous</b> <b>damper.</b>|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the free motion of a single-degree-of-freedom damped linear {{dynamical}} system can be characterized as overdamped, underdamped, or critically damped. Using the methodology of phase synchronization, which transforms any system of linear second-order differential equations into independent second-order equations, this characterization of free motion is generalized to multi-degree-of-freedom damped linear systems. A real scalar function, termed the <b>viscous</b> <b>damping</b> function, is introduced {{as an extension of the}} classical damping ratio.

40|$|AbstractBy {{advancing}} the technologies regarding seismic control of structures {{and development of}} earthquake resistance systems in the past decades application {{of different types of}} earthquake energy dissipation system has incredibly increased. <b>Viscous</b> <b>damper</b> device as a famous and the simplest earthquake energy dissipation system is implemented in many new structures and numerous number of researches have been done on the performance of viscous dampers in structures subjected to earthquake. The experience of recent severe earthquakes indicates that sometimes the earthquake energy dissipation devices are damaged during earthquakes and there is no function for structural control system. So, damage of earthquake energy dissipation systems such as <b>viscous</b> <b>damper</b> device must be considered during design of earthquake resistance structures.
