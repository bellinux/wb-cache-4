5000|$|Recycled: Used {{paper is}} {{collected}} and sorted and usually mixed with <b>virgin</b> <b>fibres</b> {{in order to}} make new material. This is necessary as the recycled fibre often loses strength when reused; the added <b>virgin</b> <b>fibres</b> enhance strength. Mixed waste paper is not usually deinked (skipping the deinking stage) for paperboard manufacture and hence the pulp may contain traces of inks, adhesives, and other residues which together give it a grey colour. Products made of recycled board usually have a less predictable composition and poorer functional properties than virgin fibre-based boards. Health risks have been associated with using recycled material in direct food contact.

The recycled PP fibre was proven to have very good alkali resistance in the concrete and other alkaline environments. The recycled PP fibre showed excellent post-cracking performance in concrete, bringing in significant ductility. In the 40 MPa concrete the effectiveness of reinforcement of PP fibres depended on their Young's modulus and tensile strength in the crack mouth opening displacement (CMOD) test.

40|$|This study {{assesses the}} {{environmental}} impact of four alternatives for reinforcing 100 m² of concrete footpath (Functional Unit, FU) by using cradle to gate life cycle assessment (LCA), based on the Australian context. Specifically, the four options considered are a) producing steel reinforcing mesh (SRM), b) producing <b>virgin</b> polypropylene (PP) <b>fibre,</b> c) recycling industrial PP waste and d) recycling domestic PP waste. The FU yields 364 kg of SRM (in a) and 40 kg of PP fibres (in b, c and d), necessary to achieve the same degree of reinforcing in concrete. All the activities required to produce these materials are considered in the study, namely manufacturing and transportation, and also recycling and reprocessing in the case of industrial and domestic recycled PP waste fibres. These processes are individually analysed and quantified in terms of material consumption, water use, and emissions into the environment. This allows for the impacts from producing recycled fibres to be compared with those from producing <b>virgin</b> PP <b>fibre</b> and SRM, which are traditionally used.

Mechanical properties of nonwovens related to damage such as failure stress and strain at that stress depend on deformation and damage characteristics of their constituent fibres. Damage of polypropylene-fibre commercial low-density thermally bonded nonwovens in tension was analysed with tensile tests on single fibres, extracted from nonwovens bonded at optimal manufacturing parameters and attached to individual bond points at both ends. The same tests were performed on raw polypropylene fibres that were used in manufacturing of the analysed nonwovens to study quantitatively the effect of manufacturing parameters on tenacity of fibres. Those tests were performed with a wide range of strain rates. It was found that the fibres break at their weakest point, i. e. bond edge, in optimally bonded nonwovens. Additionally, failure stress and strain in tension of a fibre extracted from the fabric were significantly lower than those of <b>virgin</b> <b>fibre.</b> Since damage in nonwovens occurs by progressive failure of fibres, those experiments were used to establish damage initiation and propagation in thermally bonded nonwovens based on polypropylene fibres.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to investigate the potential use of recycled glass fibre composite materials as a replacement for virgin reinforcing materials in new thermoset composites. Specifically the closed-loop mechanical recycling of composites used heavily in the automotive sector known as dough and sheet moulding composites, DMC and SMC respectively, are investigated. The recycling of glass reinforced thermoset polymer composite materials has been an area of investigation for many years and composites used in the automotive industry are of particular interest due to legislative and social pressures on the industry. The mechanical recycling process and then collection of useful fibrous grades of recycled materials, recyclate, by a novel air separation technique were investigated first. The properties of these recyclate fibres were characterised and compared directly with the properties of <b>virgin</b> glass <b>fibres</b> they were to be used to replace. Single fibre tensile tests were employed to compare the strengths of the fibres and single fibre pull-out tests were used to investigate the strength of the interface between the fibres and a polyester matrix. These tests showed the recyclate fibres to be weaker and have a poorer interface with the polyester matrix than the <b>virgin</b> glass <b>fibres.</b> Understanding the properties of the recyclate materials meant their reformulation into new composites could be carefully considered for the production of new high performance materials. Two grades of the collected recyclate materials were then reformulated in to new DMC and SMC composites, replacing percentages of the <b>virgin</b> glass <b>fibre</b> reinforcement. The mechanical properties of the resulting manufactured composites were characterised throughout for direct comparison against one another and an unmodified control material, using both three-point flexural tests and Charpy impact tests. Through the modification of existing manufacturing techniques and the development of novel production equipment it has been possible to successfully manufacture both DMC and SMC composites with the recyclate materials used to replace <b>virgin</b> glass <b>fibres.</b> <b>Virgin</b> glass <b>fibres</b> have successfully been replaced by recyclate materials without disrupting standard production techniques and with minimal reduction of the mechanical properties of the resulting composites. As the loadings of recyclate materials used were greatly increased both the flexural and impact strengths were significantly degraded and it was found that chemical modification of the composite could be used to improve these formulations. It has been shown that the recyclate materials should be considered and treated as a distinct reinforcing ingredient, separately from the remaining <b>virgin</b> glass <b>fibres.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|In {{life cycle}} {{assessment}} (LCA) of paper products, {{it is common to}} either assume that the carbon impacts of forestry are neutral (i. e. no net emissions) or to credit harvested wood products as a carbon store. When comparing virgin and recycled materials, this means that forest carbon flows are either shown as nil or a net sequestration credit. However, harvested wood products typically account for {{less than half of the}} carbon stored in a forest, with additional stores in below ground biomass, deadwood, litter and soils. Each of these stores may be affected by changes in demand for virgin pulp and paper. In this study the countries likely to provide pulp displaced by moving to recyclate, or used when switching from recyclate were identified for both the UK and China (the largest export market for UK-derived recyclate). Changes in forest carbon stores in each country were then assessed and attributed to the extraction of a unit of timber in each country where demand for pulp and paper was identified as a driver for change. The analysis shows that when switching from virgin to recycled content within the UK and China, no additional biogenic CO emissions are avoided with the exception of Canadian pulp, where the data suggests that forests are being degraded, with associated carbon losses. When switching from recycled to virgin content, net biogenic CO emissions are seen from most relevant countries. In the example of newsprint, this is equivalent to 2 - 23 tonnes CO per tonne of newsprint. The exceptions to this are Chile and Russia, where demand for <b>virgin</b> <b>fibre</b> does not appear to be associated with deforestation.

40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the characterisation and reuse of fibres recovered from end of life thermoset composites by fluidised bed thermal processing. Emphasis is placed on the properties of recovered glass fibres and their reuse in a dough moulding compound and a tissue product. The need for a recycling process is demonstrated by a survey of the market for thermoset composites with particular consideration given to the potential growth in automotive applications. A study of processes developed to recycle such materials and the effect on the structural properties of composites containing such recyclate shows that a process capable of generating recyclate of greater value is required, particularly for the case of contaminated materials. A review of investigations into the effect of prior heat treatment on the mechanical properties of glass fibres shows that their strength will be reduced by a deterioration of the fibre surface during fluidised bed thermal recovery but that their stiffness is likely to be unaffected. The implications of these effects on possible applications for the recovered fibres are described. Tests are reported on the structural properties of laminates containing heat treated glass cloth which show that there is a strength reduction which is both time and temperature dependent but that modulus is not significantly affected. Strength loss increases with up to 20 minutes heating but then remains constant. In some cases the strength loss can be reduced by resizing the cloth. Measurement of the properties of fibres recovered using the fluidised bed process shows that the recovered fibre strength decreases with increasing processing temperature. Glass and carbon fibres recovered at 450 °C retain approximately 50 % and 80 % of their virgin strengths respectively. The Young's modulus of the recovered fibres is shown to be largely unaffected by the process for both glass and carbon fibres. Investigation of the lengths of the recovered glass fibres by image analysis techniques suggests that their distribution depends on the structure of the composite and the method of size reduction. A weighted mean fibre length of 3. 5 mm to 5. 5 mm is possible with the apparatus described in this thesis. The reduced reinforcement potential of the recovered fibres is confirmed by experiment. Recovered glass fibres are used to displace <b>virgin</b> <b>fibres</b> in a dough moulding compound. At replacement levels of up to 50 % there is no significant effect on the mechanical properties of a compression moulded plate. Above this level, tensile, flexural and impact strengths are reduced and with complete replacement the reduction is by approximately 40 %, 50 % and 70 % respectively. These results are confirmed on a pilot plant scale. Recovered glass fibres can be successfully incorporated with <b>virgin</b> <b>fibres</b> into a veil. Replacement of <b>virgin</b> <b>fibres</b> reduces both wet and dry strength because the recovered fibres are both shorter and weaker. The permeability of the veil is found to depend on its porosity and not its recovered fibre content. The experimental veils can be used to protect and improve the surfaces of mouldings...|$|R

Four recycling cases, including mechanical recycling, semi-mechanical recycling, back-to-oligomer recycling and back-to-monomer recycling were analysed. Three allocation methods are applied for open-loop recycling, i. e. the “cut-off” approach, the “waste valuation” approach and the “system expansion” approach. Nine environmental impact indicators were analysed, i. e. non-renewable energy use (NREU), global warming potential (GWP), abiotic depletion, acidification, eutrophication, human toxicity, fresh water aquatic ecotoxicity, terrestrial ecotoxicity and photochemical oxidant formation. The LCA results are compared with <b>virgin</b> PET <b>fibre</b> and other commodity fibre products, i. e. cotton, viscose, PP (polypropylene) and PLA (polylactic acid). The LCA results show that recycled PET fibres offer important environmental benefits over <b>virgin</b> PET <b>fibre.</b> Depending on the allocation methods applied for open-loop-recycling, NREU savings of 40 – 85 % and GWP savings of 25 – 75 % can be achieved.

Recycled fibres produced from chemical recycling allow to reduce impacts in six to seven out of a total of nine categories compared to <b>virgin</b> PET <b>fibres.</b> Note that while mechanical recycling has a better environmental profile than chemical recycling, chemically recycled fibres can be applied in a wider range of applications than mechanically recycled fibres...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the recovery of}} carbon fibres from a composite used in the aeronautical industry, via a combined process of thermolysis and gasification in an air atmosphere. The waste was thermolysed at 500 C, 600 C or 700 C in a pilot plant to determine the optimum thermolysis temperature. The solid residues produced - char covered carbon fibres - were characterized by SEM and XPS. The optimum time for the gasification of the char covering the fibres was determined in a combined thermolysis/gasification assay. After thermolysis at the optimum temperature (500 C), 12 l/h of pure air were injected into the reactor and char gasification performed at 500 C for 30 - 180 min. The optimum gasification time was 30 min. Longer gasification times led {{to the production of}} fibres of smaller diameter with oxidized surfaces and reduced tensile strength. The optimally recovered fibres showed about 70 % of the tensile strength of <b>virgin</b> <b>fibres</b> and some 90 - 96 % of their elasticity. © 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|AbstractA {{complete}} {{review of}} the different techniques {{that have been developed}} to recycle fibre reinforced polymers is presented. The review also focuses on the reuse of valuable products recovered by different techniques, in particular the way that fibres have been reincorporated into new materials or applications and the main technological issues encountered. Recycled glass fibres can replace small amounts of <b>virgin</b> <b>fibres</b> in products but not at high enough concentrations to make their recycling economically and environmentally viable, if for example, thermolysis or solvolysis is used. Reclaimed carbon fibres from high-technology applications cannot be reincorporated in the same applications from which they were recovered, so new appropriate applications have to be developed in order to reuse the fibres. Materials incorporating recycled fibres exhibit specific mechanical properties because of the particular characteristics imparted by the fibres. The development of specific standards is therefore necessary, as well as efforts in the development of solutions that enable reusers to benefit from their reinforcement potential. The recovery and reuse of valuable products from resins are also considered, but also the development of recyclable thermoset resins. Finally, the economic and environmental aspects of recycling composite materials, based on Life Cycle Assessment, are discussed...|$|R

50|$|Due to huge {{requirement}} of pulpwood for production <b>virgin</b> celluolosic <b>fibre</b> based paper, Pulp & Paper Industry {{have become a}} major demand driver for particular species of tree like Eucalyptus Eucalyptus, Acasia Acacia, Subabul Leucaena leucocephala and Casaurina Casuarina. As a rough estimate, total demand for pulp wood is approximately 10 million ADMT (i.e. wood having 10% moisture).

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} work was to verify the {{possibility}} to produce tray packages directly from pulp sheets using press forming techniques. The different existing raw materials of pulp, various sources of molded pulp and different methods of production of molded pulp were studied. Nine different raw materials which were used for experimental work were provided by Stora Enso mills, and Stora Enso Research Centre, Imatra, Finland. The laboratory tests were carried out using LUT Adjustable packaging line at Lappeenranta University of Technology. The results prove that long <b>virgin</b> <b>fibres</b> of pine pulp seems to have better formability with high moisture content compared to others. No significant improvements were noticed with conditioned samples, never the less far studies {{has to be done}} to find optimal conditions for production. The results indicated the possibility for making pressformed tray from two different pulp qualities (Sunila pulp and Enopine). The method could prove to be beneficiary as the production line could be shortened and investment in board machines could be avoided if the trays were pressed directly from pulp sheets. Also the labour costs would be reduced. However, there is much work to be done before the quality of a tray produced out of a pulp sheet is comparable to a tray produced out of tray board...|$|R
