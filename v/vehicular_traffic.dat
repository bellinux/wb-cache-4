5|$|The Forth Road Bridge is a {{suspension}} bridge in east central Scotland. The bridge, opened in 1964, spans the Firth of Forth, connecting Edinburgh, at Queensferry, to Fife, at North Queensferry. It replaced a centuries-old ferry service to carry <b>vehicular</b> <b>traffic,</b> cyclists and pedestrians across the Forth; railway crossings {{are made by}} the adjacent Forth Bridge, opened in 1890.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of the crossing to <b>vehicular</b> <b>traffic</b> was underpinned when the Great Britain road numbering scheme was drawn up in the 1920s. The planners wished the arterial A9 road to be routed across the Forth here, although the unwillingness to have a ferry crossing {{as part of this}} route led to the A90 number being assigned instead.|$|E
5|$|The {{president}} {{also has an}} official residence in Minsk surrounded by the streets of Marx, Engels, Kirov and Komsomol. Like the American White House, the streets close to the residence are closed off to <b>vehicular</b> <b>traffic</b> and are patrolled by police forces.|$|E

5|$|The tunnel was {{originally}} opened {{as a single}} bore in 1897 by the then Prince of Wales, as a major transport project to improve commerce and trade in London's East End, and supported a mix of foot, cycle, horse-drawn and <b>vehicular</b> <b>traffic.</b> By the 1930s, capacity was becoming inadequate, and consequently a second bore opened in 1967, handling southbound traffic while the earlier 19th century tunnel handled northbound.|$|E
5|$|Access and {{movement}} within the protected areas is restricted. In the lake area in particular, no motorized boats are permitted. Flying over the lakes is also discouraged except for scientific reasons. <b>Vehicular</b> <b>traffic</b> is {{banned in the}} reserved areas. Taking samples from the lake is to be kept to the minimum even for scientific studies and also the equipment brought from outside for sampling, {{and it must be}} thoroughly washed to avoid any type of contamination from outside. There are many more rules and regulations that are set by the authorities, which have to be strictly adhered to.|$|E
5|$|Darjeeling {{is a part}} of the Eastern Himalayan zoo-geographic zone. Flora around Darjeeling {{comprises}} sal, oak, semi-evergreen, temperate and alpine forests. Dense evergreen {{forests of}} sal and oak lie around the town, where a wide variety of rare orchids are found. The Lloyd's Botanical Garden preserves common and rare species of plants, while the Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park specialises in conserving and breeding endangered Himalayan species. The town of Darjeeling and surrounding region face deforestation due to increasing demand for wood fuel and timber, as well as air pollution from increasing <b>vehicular</b> <b>traffic.</b>|$|E

40|$|This monographÂ  {{presents}} a systematic {{treatment of the}} theory for hyperbolic conservation laws and their applications to <b>vehicular</b> <b>traffics</b> and crowd dynamics. In {{the first part of}} the book, the author presents very basic considerations and gradually introduces the mathematical tools necessary to describe and understand the mathematical models developed in the following parts focusing on <b>vehicular</b> and pedestrian <b>traffic.</b> The book is a self-contained valuable resource for advanced courses in mathematical modeling, physics and civil engineering. A number of examples and figures facilitate a better understanding of the underlying concepts and motivations for the students. Important new techniques are presented, in particular the wave front tracking algorithm, the operator splitting approach, the non-classical theory of conservation laws and the constrained problems. This book is the first to present a comprehensive account of these fundamental new mathematical advances. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{bridge is}} owned and {{maintained}} by the Tamar Bridge and Torpoint Ferry Joint Committee, a conglomerate between Plymouth City Council and Cornwall County Council. It has a main span of three lanes, which use a tidal flow arrangement to maximise traffic flow at rush hour, and two outer lanes. The north of these {{is used as a}} local access route from Saltash, while the south is used by cyclists and pedestrians, as it can no longer be used for <b>vehicular</b> <b>traffic</b> due to weight restrictions.|$|E
5|$|Visitors {{are allowed}} to snowshoe and do {{cross-country}} skiing and are not restricted to trails. The Teton Park Road between the Taggart Lake trailhead to Signal Mountain Campground is closed to <b>vehicular</b> <b>traffic</b> during the winter and {{this section of the}} road is groomed for skiing and snowshoeing traffic. The park service offers guided snowshoe tours daily from the main headquarters located in Moose, Wyoming. Overnight camping is allowed in the winter in the backcountry with a permit and visitors should inquire about avalanche dangers.|$|E
5|$|Work {{continued}} {{on the new}} expressway {{over the next several}} years, wrapping up in mid-1997. By then, a new Progressive Conservative government was in power, and committed $100 million towards the two projects. An opening ceremony was held on October5, 1997, with local, regional and provincial politicians in attendance. The new expressway opened to <b>vehicular</b> <b>traffic</b> ten days later on October15. The cost of the parkway, initially projected at $187 million, was under budget at $180 million.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to {{problems with the}} terminal building, both the airport's location and surrounding infrastructure were {{the subject of much}} complaint as well. For one, although some 1,700 cars visited the airport daily, the parking lot had only 129 slots, and could not be expanded any further. The airport complex likewise was located directly alongside major city thoroughfares, in particular the city's main highway, the Tomas Confesor Highway, which complicated the flow of traffic in and around the area. At one point, the ATO, which was already having difficulty managing <b>vehicular</b> <b>traffic</b> around the airport, proposed banning cargo and delivery trucks from passing through the road in front of the terminal building. However, the city government did not respond.|$|E
5|$|The village {{changed little}} in either {{character}} or structure {{after the end}} of World War II, though in 1965 plans were drawn for the further development of Durham Road which drew criticism from residents. By 1974, when the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead was formed, Low Fell had transformed from those early, village days and was by that time a bustling suburb with a considerable independent commercial hub attracting a high volume of <b>vehicular</b> <b>traffic.</b> That character is relatively unchanged today, but Low Fell {{remains one of the most}} attractive places to live in the North East of England, retaining a distinctive village feel and containing a thriving community of shops, restaurants, schools and churches.|$|E
5|$|Washington Park {{has many}} {{activities}} open to visitors and residents, some {{maintained by the}} city, others are spontaneously set up by individuals. Washington Park's open spaces are often used by visitors to play boccie, volleyball, and badminton games. Tennis, basketball, and handball courts are maintained by {{the city in the}} park, and ice skating is permitted on Washington Park Lake, though swimming is prohibited. Bicycling is popular on the many roadways, many of which are closed to <b>vehicular</b> <b>traffic.</b> Though skateboarding is legal throughout the park itself, the monuments and ball courts in the park fall under a citywide ban on skateboarding on public monuments, statues, and tennis/basketball courts.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} second order model based on the Aw, Rascle, Zhang model (ARZ) for <b>vehicular</b> <b>traffics</b> subject to point {{constraints}} on the flow, its motivation being, for instance, the modeling of traffic lights along a road. We first introduce a definition of entropy solution by choosing a family of entropy pairs analogous to the Kruzhkov entropy pairs for scalar conservation laws; then we apply the wave-front tracking method to prove existence and a priori bounds for the entropy solutions of constrained Cauchy problem for ARZ with initial data of bounded variation and piecewise constant constraints. The case of solutions attaining values at the vacuum is considered. We construct an explicit example to describe some qualitative features of the solutions...|$|R

5|$|On 10 May, an {{immediate}} vigil and protest {{was launched in}} light of international reports of the shelling of Tamil civilians in the Sri Lanka Army-declared safe zone in which 378 civilians had been killed, while protesters claimed it to be nearly 3,000. The protest began on Spadina Avenue but abruptly spread past police cordons onto the Gardiner Expressway, a busy freeway in the city, bringing all <b>vehicular</b> <b>traffic</b> to a halt. The protesters, including {{women and children in}} strollers, said they would not stop blocking the Gardiner Expressway until they met with a representative from Premier Dalton McGuinty's office and got a promise for a clear course of action to stop the civil war in Sri Lanka. Police subsequently shut-down the Gardiner Expressway and Toronto's Don Valley Parkway, causing heavy traffic congestions throughout other Toronto streets and highways.|$|E
5|$|On October27, 1934, the Meadowbrook and Lido Beach Loop causeways {{were opened}} to <b>vehicular</b> <b>traffic</b> by LISPC. A {{motorcade}} of cars was led across the new roadways by Robert Moses, then a Republican Party candidate for Governor of New York. The event {{was preceded by}} parades in Freeport and Rockville Centre. During a speech Moses cited praises to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation for donating the money and letting the LISPC and Jones Beach State Parkway Authority do the work without interference. Other speakers that afternoon praised Moses and the LISPC, and New York City Mayor Fiorello La Guardia showed up late to give his congratulations. Despite the opening ceremony, two-way traffic was not permitted on the Meadowbrook between the Southern State and Merrick Road until June1, 1935. Prior to that time, motorists {{had to use the}} renamed Wantagh Causeway to access Jones Beach.|$|E
5|$|As {{news about}} the arrest spread, there was {{violence}} {{in other parts of}} Maharashtra too. Sporadic incidents of stone pelting at municipal and private buses were reported in the reat of Maharashtra following the arrest of MNS chief Raj Thackeray in Ratnagiri. In Kothrud area, some alleged MNS activists damaged a company's bus that was taking its employees to workplace. Few Pune Municipal Transport (PMT) buses were stoned by miscreants, police said. Meanwhile, police have picked up around 100 MNS activists, including some corporators as a preventive measure. In Nashik, MNS activists set ablaze a truck near PWD minister Chhagan Bhujbal's farm and also damaged another truck at Vilholi-Phata area, police said. Incidents of stone pelting on MSRTC buses and other vehicles were reported in some areas, they said, adding <b>vehicular</b> <b>traffic</b> on the busy Mumbai-Agra-national highway was disrupted following the protest. Police rounded up 70 MNS activists in Nashik incidents and security was tightened in the city. In Solapur, incidents of stone pelting on state transport buses were also reported. In Nagpur MNS party leaders claimed to have damaged several MSRTC buses.|$|E

40|$|Accumulations {{of heavy}} metals in urban soils are highly spatial {{heterogeneity}} and affected by multiple factors including soil properties, {{land use and}} pattern, population and climatic conditions. We studied accumulation risks of Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn in unban soils of Beijing and their influencing based on the regression tree analysis and a GIS-based overlay model. Result shows that Zinc causes the most extensive soil pollution and Cu result in the most acute soil pollution. The soil's organic carbon content and CEC and population growth are the most significant factors affecting heavy metal accumulation. Other influence factors in land use pattern, urban landscape, and wind speed also contributed, but less pronounced. The soils in areas with higher degree of urbanization and surrounded by intense <b>vehicular</b> <b>traffics</b> have higher accumulation risk of Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

5|$|In 1859, six guns, four 12-pounders and two 12-pound carronades, were {{installed}} on the bastion, and four years later, five 32-pounders were mounted on the fortification. The earliest defences of {{the southern end of}} the city of Gibraltar included the 16th century Charles V Wall, Flat Bastion, South Bastion, Southport Gate, and Southport Ditch. The complex of defences also included Southport Ditch which was depicted in the 1627 map of Gibraltar by Spanish engineer Luis Bravo de AcuÃ±a. On that map which is held by the British Museum, the ditch is shown as a Fosso south of Southport Gate. It was a large trench which extended from the southwestern aspect of the 16th century South Bastion to the Flat Bastion at Prince Edward's Gate. The width of the ditch is now indicated by that of Ragged Staff Gates, which initially served as a water gate. By the late 19th century, the ditch was utilised as an ordnance depot, with a magazine constructed in the 1880s. However, by the early 20th century, that same magazine was used as a pump house. After World War I and reclamation of land, the Ragged Staff Gates were opened to <b>vehicular</b> <b>traffic.</b> Gibraltar's Sunken Gardens, a 19th-century market garden, were a remnant of the western portion of the Southport Ditch, and were filled in at the time of the 1967 Referendum Gate. Trafalgar Cemetery represents an eastern remnant of the ditch.|$|E
5|$|Serious issues {{concerning}} {{safety and security}} in the building arose after Donald Trump was declared as President-elect of the United States on November 8, 2016. Trump Tower {{had served as a}} rallying point for the protests against Donald Trump {{in the days after the}} election's results were announced, thus requiring extra deployments of security officials. The Federal Aviation Administration imposed a no-fly zone over Trump Tower until January 20, 2017, and the NYPD stated that it was projected to spend $35 million to provide security to the tower, of which $7 million would be repaid by Congress. The NYPD later revised its estimate to $24 million. Street closures were imposed along the east side of Fifth Avenue and on the north side of 56th Street, with NYPD officers stopping and questioning pedestrians on these sidewalks as to their destinations. The block of 56th Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues was closed completely to <b>vehicular</b> <b>traffic,</b> but part of the street west of Madison Avenue was later reopened to allow local deliveries. Customers to the Gucci and Tiffany's stores in Trump Tower's lobby were allowed to proceed, while other pedestrians were redirected to the opposite side of the street. During presidential visits, dump trucks from the New York City Department of Sanitation were parked outside the tower to prevent car bombs. The press nicknamed the now-heavily secured building White House North, comparing it to the White House's West Wing.|$|E

40|$|Rampant mobile traffic {{increase}} in modern cellular networks is mostly caused by large-sized multimedia contents. Recent advancements in smart devices {{as well as}} radio access technologies promote the consumption of bulky content, even for people in moving vehicles, referred to as vehicular heavy users. In this article the emergence of <b>vehicular</b> heavy user <b>traffic</b> is observed by field experiments conducted in 2012 and 2015 in Seoul, Korea. The experiments reveal that such traffic is becoming dominant, captured by the 8. 62 times increase in <b>vehicular</b> heavy user <b>traffic</b> while the total {{traffic increase}}d 3. 04 times. To resolve this so-called vehicular heavy user problem (VHP), we propose a cell association algorithm that exploits user demand diversity for different velocities. This user traffic pattern is discovered first by our field trials, which is convex-shaped over velocity, i. e. walking user traffic is less than stationary or <b>vehicular</b> user <b>traffic.</b> As the VHP becomes severe, numerical evaluation verifies the proposed user convexity aware association outperforms a well-known load balancing association in practice, cell range expansion (CRE). In addition to the cell association, several complementary techniques are suggested {{in line with the}} technical trend toward 5 G.
