Juan de Fuca Ridge is a medium rate spreading centre (~6cm/yr) forming the divergent boundary between the Pacific (to the west) and the Juan de Fuca (to the east) tectonic plates [...] At these divergent boundaries, convection currents in the mantle rise up as magma, emerge through the rifts as lava, and crystallise as new rock (basalts and gabbro). These processes continually create new ocean crust. Hydrothermal vents, which typically form along these mid-ocean ridges, are fissures from which geothermally heated water flows. The water flowing out of vents is dominantly seawater drawn into the system through the faults, porous sediments, and volcanic rocks. As the cool seawater moves through the sediment and rock towards the hot magma, the water becomes super heated (300-400°C) and rich in dissolved mineral elements (such as sulphur, iron, zinc and copper) from the young ocean crust. When the hot effluent is expelled, it encounters the cold, ambient seawater (about 2°C) minerals precipitate from the element-rich vent water.

But one major concern related to geological CO 2 storage {{is the possibility of}} leakage from the reservoir and subsequent effects on the environment, which cannot completely be excluded. This study aims at investigating the environmental impact of CO 2 release from reservoirs into near surface terrestrial environments. To understand the effect of CO 2 leakage on such an ecosystem, detailed knowledge on the abundance and diversity of plants and microorganisms is essential. Therefore, an ecosystem study has been conducted within the Network of Excellence “CO 2 GeoNet” on a natural CO 2 vent at the Laacher See, Germany. Near surface CO 2 conditions and CO 2 fluxes of the <b>venting</b> <b>area</b> were described by means of conventional soil gas measurement equipment, and brought up the difference between the CO 2 anomalies and their surroundings.

40|$|Gas {{hydrates}} {{have been}} found in the near-bottom sediments within gas venting structures in the southern basin of Lake Baikal. The Baikal basin consists of three subbasins, separated by accommodation zones: the Academician Ridge between the north and central basins, the Selenga Delta Accommodation Zone between the central and south basins. The venting structures are located south of the Posolskiy Bank, which is a basement ridge with a thick sequence of sediments on top, trending NE, oblique to the main border fault. The Posolskiy Bank belongs to the Selenga Delta Accommodation Zone. It is delimited at its south-eastern side by the Posolskiy Fault with a displacement of more than 1000 metres. The venting structures are located close to an ENE trending fault, parallel to the Posolskiy Fault. Besides the fault which is delimiting the <b>venting</b> <b>area</b> at its northern side, and which has a vertical offset of its northern footwall of 25 - 30 metres, a fault with a vertical offset of its eastern footwall is not more than 5 metres. The <b>venting</b> <b>area</b> corresponds to a zone of local elevation of the lake floor, which is delimited at its northern side by the ENE trending fault and which is gently dipping towards SW in its southern part. It consequently appears as a zone of updoming probably related to a fluid and gas flow from depth, finally disrupted along its northern and eastern sides. The updoming is interpreted as the consequence of the disruption of the deep gas hydrate layer resulting from fluid overpressure. This interpretation is favoured by the regional pattern of the BSR, which shows strong variations in depth over this part of the south Baikal basin: it reaches minimum depths in the <b>venting</b> <b>area</b> and drops abruptly down to significantly larger depths north of the fault delimiting the <b>venting</b> <b>area.</b> The upward migration of the BSR is interpreted as a consequence of a regional fluid flow at depth, resulting in heat transport, consequent upward migration of the gas hydrates stability zone, updoming of the area and finally disruption along a fault zone. The origin of the fluid flow is discussed. Folding structures in the lake sediments along a NW-SE to WNW-ESE trend have been described {{in different parts of the}} central and southern basins. These folding structures are assumed to be related to left-lateral strike-slip movements along the eastern side of the basin. In this assumption, the NE trending fault associated with the venting structures and the spatial alignment of the structures themselves would correspond to the direction of extension associated with the left-lateral strike-slip, whereas the NW oriented direction of compression would correspond to the fluid flow...|$|E

40|$|Contaminants from an instrument's self-generated sources or {{from sources}} {{external}} to the instrument may degrade its critical surfaces and/or create an environment which limits the instrument's intended performance. Analyses {{have been carried out}} on a method to investigate the required purging flow of clean, dry gas to prevent the ingestion of external contaminants into the instrument container volume. The pressure to be maintained and the required flow are examined in terms of their effectiveness in preventing gaseous and particulate contaminant ingestion and abatement of self-generated contaminants in the volume. The required <b>venting</b> <b>area</b> or the existing volume <b>venting</b> <b>area</b> is correlated to the volume to be purged, the allowable pressure differential across the volume, the external contaminant partial pressure, and the sizes of the ambient particulates. The diffusion of external water vapor into the volume while it was being purged was experimentally obtained in terms of an infiltration time constant. That data and the acceptable fraction of the outside pressure into the volume indicate the required flow of purge gas expressed in terms of volume change per unit time. The exclusion of particulates is based on the incoming velocity of the particles and the exit flow speed and density of the purge gas. The purging flow pressures needed to maintain the required flows through the vent passages are indicated. The purge gas must prevent or limit the entrance of the external contaminants to the critical locations of the instrument. It should also prevent self- contamination from surfaces, reduce material outgassing, and sweep out the outgassed products. Systems and facilities that can benefit from purging may be optical equipment, clinical facilities, manufacturing facilities, clean rooms, and other systems requiring clean environments...|$|E

The peak systolic transvalvar pressure gradient was significantly reduced from a mean (SD) of 104 (30) to 24. 3 (6) mm Hg. This haemodynamic improvement was maintained at six week follow up. In six patients pulmonary infundibular spasm developed immediately after valvotomy; however, these patients showed considerable haemodynamic improvement at the six week follow up. During balloon inflation the heart rate did not fall below 60 beats/minute and the systemic aortic pressure was maintained above 90 mm Hg.

40|$|Roof venting {{is often}} {{utilised}} in large warehouses to remove smoke {{in order to}} reduce damage to a building and its contents, and to maintain access for fire-fighters. In New Zealand, the Compliance Document for the New Zealand Building Code C clauses recommends 15 % opening area for unsprinklered single floor buildings. This opening area is required to be designed for effective fire venting. There is no justification for why 15 % is required, and no definition of how fire venting qualifies as being effective. Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) was used to simulate the performance of various roof venting strategies in two different-sized industrial warehouses (both larger than 1, 500 m²) with a 50 MW fire with both a rapid and an extreme t³ growth rate. In particular, roof venting areas of 15 %, 10 %, and 5 % of the floor area were tested with each of the following inlet areas for make-up air: 100 %, 50 %, and 0 % of roof <b>venting</b> <b>area.</b> In each of these cases, the vents were treated as permanently-open holes in the roof. It was shown that roof venting with 15 % geometric area is ample to provide and maintain tenability for fire-fighters. With sufficient inlet area for make-up air, smaller venting areas could also be employed. Further simulations were run to test the effect of square-shaped vents that opened simultaneously at 100 °C compared with square-shaped vents that opened sequentially at 100 °C, 200 °C, and 300 °C, and strip-shaped vents that opened progressively as each portion of a vent reached activation temperatures of 200 °C and 300 °C. Vents that opened at 100 °C were intended to represent mechanical vents, while vents opening at higher temperatures were intended to represent plastic sky-light or drop-out type vents. The activation temperature proved to be more influential than the opening sequence or shape: there was a significant advantage to be gained by having vents that activated at 100 °C as opposed to 200 °C or 300 °C. The role of downstands in aiding the effectiveness of roof venting was also investigated, with downstand depths of 10 %, 20 %, and 30 % of the ceiling height being simulated. Downstands were shown to be incredibly useful for exhausting smoke and hot gases, provided their installation was appropriately coordinated with placement of roof venting. It is concluded that a clear definition of effective fire venting must not only include the area of roof venting, but equally important is the definition of required inlet area for make-up air, as it plays {{a crucial role in the}} effectiveness of the specified roof <b>venting</b> <b>area.</b> In addition, the clear aerodynamic area should be specified. This could be achieved by use of a discharge coefficient that describes the proportion of the roof <b>venting</b> <b>area</b> that is clear aerodynamic area for a particular material, vent, and geometric area.

40|$|Flashover is a {{phenomenon}} describing a room fire changed from the growth stage to the development stage. There is a rapid increase in size and intensity. The radiant heat flux back to the fuel surface and {{the floor of the}} room is known {{to be one of the}} key parameters leading to flashover. Indeed, a heat flux (largely due to radiation) of 20 kW/m 2 to the room floor is often taken to be the condition of flashover. To understand the importance of radiation, a zone model is developed to simulate the transient fire growth in a compartment. Heat and mass transfer correlations available in the literature are used to simulate the non-radiative effect. A three-dimensional non-gray soot radiation model is used to simulate the radiative exchange between the fuel surface, the hot gas/particulate layer and the surrounding wall. Results show that the hot layer temperature alone may not be an effective indicator for flashover.

40|$|International audienceA Round Robin {{test was}} set up to obtain a cross {{comparison}} of participant's methods regarding a typical pressure relief device (bursting disc) sizing problem. The problem in question was a 'gassy' runaway reaction system: decomposition of 40 % w/w dicumyl peroxide in 2, 2, 4 -trimethyl- 1, 3 - pentanediol diisobutyrate. The objective of the Round Robin exercise was to highlight the disparities in the participant's approaches and identify barriers and research needs. Two broad methods were used: one was the implementation of the DIERS method; the other was to follow a similarity or scale-up approach. The scale-up approach consists experimentally determining a minimum safe <b>vent</b> <b>area</b> and scaling up maintaining the vent area/volume ratio. This approach is similar to the one adopted by the UN committee on the Transport of Dangerous Goods for vent sizing of peroxide tankers using a 10 litre vessel. Very different results in terms of <b>vent</b> <b>area</b> were obtained from the seven participants. Analysis of the vent sizing calculations based on calorimetric data showed that the experimental conditions and their interpretation can significantly influence the estimated gas production rate and therefore the final <b>vent</b> <b>area.</b> However, the calculation of the vented mass flux stays largely responsible for the differences in calculated <b>vent</b> <b>area.</b> The critical factor lies in the assumption of single-phase (gas only) venting or two-phase (liquid and gas) venting. The reasons for assuming single-phase venting, which gives a lower <b>vent</b> <b>area,</b> are unclear and may not be justified. The comparison showed that the calorimetric and the similarity approaches diverged significantly when two-phase only venting was assumed. The Round Robin test highlighted the need for more experimental and modelling work towards predicting the nature of the vented fluid at large scale, and in the use of adiabatic calorimetry to determine the maximum gas production rate. Large-scale tests would allow the comparison, the validation and the improvement of the calorimetric and similarity approaches...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} protect {{chemical}} reactors from runaway reactions, vent sizing methods, based on data obtained from adiabatic calorimetry and two-phase flow models, were built {{under the guidance of}} the DIERS (Design Institute for Emergency System Relief). Nevertheless, because of the simplifying assumptions used (mainly conservation of initial reactive mass and homogeneous vessel venting), DIERS methods often lead to unrealistically large <b>vent</b> <b>areas.</b> This is especially the case of non tempered systems (gas-generating and hybrid systems, peroxide decomposition for example). The United Nation Manual of Test and Criteria (UN) also proposes an experimental method to determine the minimum required <b>vent</b> <b>area</b> using a 10 dm vessel test. The <b>vent</b> <b>area</b> is scaled up on vessel volume. Prior mass loss and two phase flow being experimentally taken into account, this method provides a more realistic vent size.

40|$|Studies on the {{distribution}} of microbial sulfate reduction, {{and its impact on the}} global carbon and sulfur cycle, have mostly been conducted in shallow and deep-marine sediments. Little is therefore known about the ecological impact that sulfate reducing bacteria have on element cycling in ecosystems that is associated with the nutrient rich hydrothermal sediments. The chemical disequilibrium created by the mixing of hydrothermal fluids and seawater, nourish a diversity of primary producers that provide nutrients for the anaerobic heterotrophic community. Diffuse venting areas, such as the barite field on the eastern flank of the hydrothermal mound at Loki`s Castle, are promising target sites for exploring the impact of biogenic processes as temperatures are within the biological window. This study aims to characterize {{the distribution}} of sulfate reducing bacteria at this diffuse <b>venting</b> <b>area</b> by integrating direct measurement of sulfate reduction rates with geochemical analyses of pore fluids and microbiological methods. The spatial distribution of the fluid compositions and flow patterns seems to determine the distribution of the metabolically functional groups in the barite field, and functions as a geochemical constraint on the chemoautotrophic primary production. Hence, the divergent fluid pattern and energy supply determines the organic carbon production, which in turn determines the distribution of the heterotrophic community. This is reflected in the distribution of sulfate reduction, where sulfate reduction rates varied between 6 - 132 pmol/cm^ 3 d in substrate-poor parts of the mound to 110 nmol/cm^ 3 d in substrate-rich sediments. Sulfate reduction rate were also measured in a barite chimney, which was associated with effluent that was characterized by elevated concentrations of methane and H 2. The geochemical measurements show a high correlation between the hydrothermal fluid signature, organic carbon production and the distribution of the mesophilic heterotrophic sulfate reducing bacteria. The diffuse <b>venting</b> <b>area</b> displays temperatures that vary between 7. 8 °C in the sediments with low activity, to ~ 20 °C in the chimney effluent. This provides habitable conditions for mesophilic and psychrotolerant members of Desulfobacterales, Desulfarculales and Desulfuromonadales order, which were all affiliated with the Deltaproteobacteria phylum. One psychrophilic sulfate reducing bacteria, Desulfofaba gelida, was detected in sediments that were associated with the lowest rates. The variable CH 4 and H 2 concentration between areas with high flow rate and low flow rate give strong indications for an additional deep sub-surface sulfate reduction zone, where anaerobic oxidation of methane coupled with sulfate reducing bacteria are an important sulfate sink, in addition to H 2 consumption by chemoautotrophic sulfate reducers and/or methanogens at more elevated temperature...|$|E

Smoke venting logging, which represents the failure of smoke venting, was experimentally found from certain operating pressure called initial logging pressure. The CO concentration was found to increase after sprinkler was operated as the smoke is constrained in the spray region with horizontal momentum decreased. Negative pressure difference is caused at the vent when there is smoke venting logging, which might practically bring the exterior fresh air into the fire building.

Rare CO 2 vents offer {{a unique opportunity to}} investigate the response of benthic ecosystems to acidification. However, the benthic habitats investigated so far are mainly found at very shallow water (less than or equal to 5 m depth) and therefore are not representative of the broad range of continental shelf habitats. Here, we show that a decrease from pH 8. 1 to 7. 9 observed in a CO 2 vent system at 40 m depth leads to a dramatic shift in highly diverse and structurally complex habitats. Forests of the kelp Laminaria rodriguezii usually found at larger depths (greater than 65 m) replace the otherwise dominant habitats (i. e. coralligenous outcrops and rhodolith beds), which are mainly characterized by calcifying organisms. Only the aragonite-calcifying algae are able to survive in acidified waters, while high-magnesium-calcite organisms are almost completely absent. Although a long-term survey of the <b>venting</b> <b>area</b> would be necessary to fully understand the effects of the variability of pH and other carbonate parameters over the structure and functioning of the investigated mesophotic habitats, our results suggest that in addition of significant changes at species level, moderate ocean acidification may entail major shifts in the distribution and dominance of key benthic ecosystems at regional scale, which could have broad ecological and socio-economic implication...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} a combined experimental, analytical and numerical modelling investigation into hydrogen jet fires in a passively ventilated enclosure. The work {{was funded by}} the EU Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking project Hyindoor. It is relevant to situations where hydrogen is stored or used indoors. In such situations passive ventilation can be used to prevent the formation of a flammable atmosphere following a release of hydrogen. Whilst a significant amount of work has been reported on unignited releases in passively ventilated enclosures and on outdoor hydrogen jet fires, very {{little is known about the}} behaviour of hydrogen jet fires in passively ventilated enclosures. This paper considers the effects of passive ventilation openings on the behaviour of hydrogen jet fires. A series of hydrogen jet fire experiments were carried out using a 31  m 3 passively ventilated enclosure. The test programme included subsonic and chocked flow releases with varying hydrogen release rates and vent configurations. In most of the tests the hydrogen release rate was sufficiently low and the <b>vent</b> <b>area</b> sufficiently large to lead to a well-ventilated jet fire. In a limited number of tests the <b>vent</b> <b>area</b> was reduced, allowing under-ventilated conditions to be investigated. The behaviour of a jet fire in a passively ventilated enclosure depends on the hydrogen release rate, the <b>vent</b> <b>area</b> and the thermal properties of the enclosure. An analytical model was used to quantify the relative importance of the hydrogen release rate and <b>vent</b> <b>area,</b> whilst the influence of the thermal properties of the enclosure were investigated using a CFD model. Overall, the results indicate that passive ventilation openings that are sufficiently large to safely ventilate an unignited release will tend to be large enough to prevent a jet fire from becoming under-ventilated...|$|R

Biomarker distributions within two discrete zones of this silica–barite chimney indicate a considerable difference in abundance and diversity of microorganisms from the chimney exterior to the interior. Lipids in the active and inactive chimney barite and sediment were dominated by a range of 13 C-depleted unsaturated and branched fatty acids with δ 13 C values between − 39. 7 and − 26. 7 ‰, indicating the presence of sulfur-oxidizing and sulfate-reducing bacteria. The majority of lipids (99. 5 %) in the extinct chimney interior that experienced high temperatures were of archaeal origin. Unusual glycerol monoalkyl glycerol tetraethers (GMGT) with 0 – 4 rings were the dominant compounds suggesting the presence of mainly (hyper-) thermophilic archaea. Isoprenoid hydrocarbons with δ 13 C values as low as − 46 ‰ also indicated the presence of methanogens and possibly methanotrophs...|$|E
40|$|Methane hydrate {{close to}} the hydrate {{stability}} limit in seafloor sediment could represent {{an important source of}} methane to the oceans and atmosphere as the oceans warm. We investigate the extent to which patterns of past and future ocean-temperature fluctuations influence hydrate stability in a region offshore West Svalbard where active gas venting has been observed. We model the transient behavior of the gas hydrate stability zone at 400 – 500 m water depth (mwd) in response to past temperature changes inferred from historical measurements and proxy data and we model future changes predicted by seven climate models and two climate-forcing scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways RCPs 2. 6 and 8. 5). We show that over the past 2000 year, a combination of annual and decadal temperature fluctuations could have triggered multiple hydrate-sourced methane emissions from seabed shallower than 400 mwd during episodes when the multidecadal average temperature was similar to that over the last century (? 2. 6 °C). These temperature fluctuations can explain current methane emissions at 400 mwd, but decades to centuries of ocean warming are required to generate emissions in water deeper than 420 m. In the <b>venting</b> <b>area,</b> future methane emissions are relatively insensitive to the choice of climate model and RCP scenario until 2050 year, but are more sensitive to the RCP scenario after 2050 year. By 2100 CE, we estimate an ocean uptake of 97 – 1050 TgC from marine Arctic hydrate-sourced methane emissions, which is 0. 06 – 0. 67 % of the ocean uptake from anthropogenic CO 2 emissions for the period 1750 – 2011...|$|E
40|$|Sediment samples (2 cm 3 each) were {{obtained}} from Ocean Drilling Program Leg 139 Sites 857 and 858 in the Middle Valley of the northern Juan de Fuca Ridge for direct microscopic determination of bacterial depth distributions in a region influenced by hydrothermal activity. Site 857 (Holes 857 A and 857 B) was 1. 6 km away from Site 858, a hydrothermal <b>venting</b> <b>area,</b> but had a similar regional structural setting and thus provided a reference site. Hydrothermal samples {{were obtained}} from four holes drilled in a transect into the active vent field at Site 858. Temperatures increased from Hole 858 A to 858 C to 858 B to 858 D with approximate temperatures at 10 meters below seafloor (mbsf) of 20 °, 33 °, 100 °, and 105 °C, respectively, compared with approximately 8 °C at 10 mbsf in Holes 857 A and B. At Site 857 substantial bacteria populations, including dividing cells, were present in all samples (deepest sample 107. 5 mbsf) {{and there were no}} significant differences between data from the two holes approximately 10 m apart. This implies that there is considerable microbial homogeneity between these spatially close areas of the seafloor, and thus the data were combined. Bacterial numbers were highest, 1. 73 × 107 cells/cm 3, in the near-surface samples at 1. 51 mbsf and decreased linearly with increasing depth to 1. 07 × 106 cells/cm 3 at 107. 5 mbsf, a 16 -fold decrease. This distribution is similar to those at other sites previously studied, despite the low organic carbon concentration (0. 56...|$|E

30|$|On {{the surface}} of a GNSS {{instrument}} (REGMOS) installed by the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan (Fig.  2), ash fall tracks were recorded as grime formed by droplets of mud or mud rain (Fig.  10 b). The track direction implies that the droplets came from the <b>vent</b> <b>area.</b> From the tracks, the average droplet diameter is estimated to have been approximately 2  mm. Since the fall velocity of a droplet of this size is estimated to be approximately 7  m/s (Beard 1977) and the angle between the ash fall tracks and the vertical line was approximately 60 °, the wind velocity is estimated to have been 12  m/s (=[*] 7 [*]×[*]tan 60 °). We observed no such wind gusts during our stay in the area from 1  h later than this time. Based on this observation, we suspect that the <b>vent</b> proximal <b>area</b> may have been covered by a very dilute base surge, which contained droplets of mud. This is also implied by the sudden droplet fall on the time-lapse camera installed northwest of the <b>vent</b> <b>area,</b> while wind was generally blowing from the north on June 29.|$|R
40|$|In {{case of a}} {{terrorist}} bomb attack the influence and efficiency of <b>venting</b> <b>areas</b> in tubular structures like train carriages is of interest. The pressure-time function of an air blast wave resulting from a solid charge is first {{compared to that of}} a gas or dust explosion and the capability of a venting structure to fly away is assessed. Several calculations using fluid-structure interaction are performed. These show that after a certain distance from the explosion, the air blast wave inside a tubular structure becomes one-dimensional, and that the influence of <b>venting</b> <b>areas</b> parallel to the wave propagation direction is small. The pressure peak and the impulse at certain points in a tubular structure are compared for several opening sizes. The overall influence of venting devices is small. Their usefulness in mitigating internal explosion effects in trains is discussed. JRC. DG. G. 5 -European laboratory for structural assessmen...|$|R
