5|$|Amanita regalis has {{the ability}} to {{bioaccumulate}} the heavy metal <b>vanadium,</b> a phenomenon first reported in Amanita muscaria in 1931. A field study of Scandinavian specimens found <b>vanadium</b> contents ranging from 38 to 169mg of <b>vanadium</b> per kg of dry mushroom (average of 119mg/kg). For comparison, the <b>vanadium</b> concentration in most other mushrooms is typically less than 2mg/kg.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 85% of <b>vanadium</b> {{produced}} {{is used as}} ferrovanadium or as a steel additive. The considerable {{increase of}} strength in steel containing small amounts of <b>vanadium</b> was discovered in the early 20th century. <b>Vanadium</b> forms stable nitrides and carbides, resulting in {{a significant increase in}} the strength of steel. From that time on, <b>vanadium</b> steel was used for applications in axles, bicycle frames, crankshafts, gears, and other critical components. There are two groups of <b>vanadium</b> steel alloys. <b>Vanadium</b> high-carbon steel alloys contain 0.15% to 0.25% <b>vanadium,</b> and high-speed tool steels (HSS) have a <b>vanadium</b> content of 1% to 5%. For high-speed tool steels, a hardness above HRC 60 can be achieved. HSS steel is used in surgical instruments and tools. Powder-metallurgic alloys contain up to 18% percent <b>vanadium.</b> The high content of <b>vanadium</b> carbides in those alloys increases wear resistance significantly. One application for those alloys is tools and knives.|$|E
5|$|Large {{amounts of}} <b>vanadium</b> ions {{are found in}} a few organisms, {{possibly}} as a toxin. The oxide and some other salts of <b>vanadium</b> have moderate toxicity. Particularly in the ocean, <b>vanadium</b> is used by some life forms as an active center of enzymes, such as the <b>vanadium</b> bromoperoxidase of some ocean algae.|$|E
5|$|The {{isolation}} of <b>vanadium</b> metal proved difficult. In 1831, Berzelius reported {{the production of}} the metal, but Henry Enfield Roscoe showed that Berzelius had in fact produced the nitride, <b>vanadium</b> nitride (VN). Roscoe eventually produced the metal in 1867 by reduction of vanadium(II) chloride, VCl2, with hydrogen. In 1927, pure <b>vanadium</b> was produced by reducing <b>vanadium</b> pentoxide with calcium.|$|E
5|$|A <b>vanadium</b> {{nitrogenase}} {{is used by}} some nitrogen-fixing micro-organisms, such as Azotobacter. In this role, <b>vanadium</b> replaces {{more common}} molybdenum or iron, and gives the nitrogenase slightly different properties.|$|E
5|$|All <b>vanadium</b> {{compounds}} {{should be}} considered toxic. Tetravalent VOSO4 {{has been reported to}} be at least 5 times more toxic than trivalent V2O3. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set an exposure limit of 0.05 mg/m3 for <b>vanadium</b> pentoxide dust and 0.1 mg/m3 for <b>vanadium</b> pentoxide fumes in workplace air for an 8-hour workday, 40-hour work week. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has recommended that 35 mg/m3 of <b>vanadium</b> be considered immediately dangerous to life and health, that is, likely to cause permanent health problems or death.|$|E
5|$|Along with {{carnotite}} and roscoelite, vanadinite {{is one of}} {{the main}} industrial ores of the element <b>vanadium,</b> which can be extracted by roasting and smelting. Vanadinite is also occasionally used as a source of lead. A common process for extracting the <b>vanadium</b> begins with the heating of vanadinite with salt (NaCl) or sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) at about 850°C to produce sodium vanadate (NaVO3). This is dissolved in water and then treated with ammonium chloride to give an orange-coloured precipitate of ammonium metavanadate. This is then melted to form a crude form of <b>vanadium</b> pentoxide (V2O5). Reduction of <b>vanadium</b> pentoxide with calcium gives pure <b>vanadium.</b>|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that a small amount, 40 to 270ppm, of <b>vanadium</b> in Wootz steel and Damascus steel significantly improved {{the strength of the}} product, though the source of the <b>vanadium</b> is unclear.|$|E
5|$|Lithium <b>vanadium</b> oxide {{has been}} {{proposed}} {{for use as a}} high energy density anode for lithium ion batteries, at 745Wh/L when paired with a lithium cobalt oxide cathode. <b>Vanadium</b> phosphates have been proposed as the cathode in the Lithium <b>Vanadium</b> Phosphate Battery, another type of lithium ion battery.|$|E
5|$|The Pourbaix diagram for <b>vanadium</b> in water, {{which shows}} the redox {{potentials}} between various <b>vanadium</b> species in different oxidation states, is also complex.|$|E
5|$|The first {{large-scale}} {{industrial use}} of <b>vanadium</b> {{was in the}} steel alloy chassis of the Ford Model T, inspired by French race cars. <b>Vanadium</b> steel allowed for reduced weight while simultaneously increasing tensile strength (ca. 1905).|$|E
5|$|There {{is little}} {{evidence}} that <b>vanadium</b> or <b>vanadium</b> compounds are reproductive toxins or teratogens. <b>Vanadium</b> pentoxide was reported to be carcinogenic in male rats and in male and female mice by inhalation in an NTP study, although the interpretation of the results has recently been disputed. The carcinogenicity of <b>vanadium</b> has not been determined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.|$|E
5|$|<b>Vanadium</b> {{compounds}} {{are poorly}} absorbed through the gastrointestinal system. Inhalation of <b>vanadium</b> and <b>vanadium</b> compounds results primarily in {{adverse effects on}} the respiratory system. Quantitative data are, however, insufficient to derive a subchronic or chronic inhalation reference dose. Other effects have been reported after oral or inhalation exposures on blood parameters, liver, neurological development, and other organs in rats.|$|E
5|$|<b>Vanadium</b> is {{also present}} in bauxite and in {{deposits}} of crude oil, coal, oil shale and tar sands. In crude oil, concentrations up to 1200ppm have been reported. When such oil products are burned, traces of <b>vanadium</b> may cause corrosion in engines and boilers. An estimated 110,000 tonnes of <b>vanadium</b> per year are released into the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels.|$|E
5|$|<b>Vanadium</b> traces in diesel fuels are {{the main}} fuel {{component}} in high temperature corrosion. During combustion, <b>vanadium</b> oxidizes and reacts with sodium and sulfur, yielding vanadate compounds with melting points as low as 530°C, which attack the passivation layer on steel and render it susceptible to corrosion. The solid <b>vanadium</b> compounds also abrade engine components.|$|E
5|$|Amanita muscaria {{and related}} species of macrofungi {{accumulate}} <b>vanadium</b> (up to 500mg/kg in dry weight). <b>Vanadium</b> {{is present in}} the coordination complex amavadin in fungal fruit-bodies. The biological importance of the accumulation is unknown. Toxic or peroxidase enzyme functions have been suggested.|$|E
5|$|Deficiencies in <b>vanadium</b> {{result in}} reduced growth in rats. The U.S. Institute of Medicine has not {{confirmed}} that <b>vanadium</b> {{is an essential}} nutrient for humans, so neither a Recommended Dietary Intake nor an Adequate Intake have been established. Dietary intake is estimated at 6 to 18 µg/day, with less than 5% absorbed. The Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) of dietary <b>vanadium,</b> beyond which adverse effects may occur, is set at 1.8 mg/day.|$|E
5|$|Organometallic {{chemistry}} of <b>vanadium</b> is well developed, {{although it has}} mainly only academic significance. Vanadocene dichloride is a versatile starting reagent and even finds some applications in organic chemistry. <b>Vanadium</b> carbonyl, V(CO)6, is a rare example of a paramagnetic metal carbonyl. Reduction yields V (isoelectronic with Cr(CO)6), which may be further reduced with sodium in liquid ammonia to yield V (isoelectronic with Fe(CO)5).|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of <b>vanadium</b> is noteworthy for {{the accessibility of}} the four adjacent oxidation states 25. In aqueous solution, <b>vanadium</b> forms metal aquo complexes of which the colours are lilac 2+, green 3+, blue 2+, yellow VO3−. Vanadium(II) compounds are reducing agents, and vanadium(V) compounds are oxidizing agents. Vanadium(IV) compounds often exist as vanadyl derivatives, which contain the VO2+ center.|$|E
5|$|The cosmic {{abundance}} of <b>vanadium</b> {{in the universe}} is 0.0001%, making the element nearly as common as copper or zinc. <b>Vanadium</b> is detected spectroscopically in light from the Sun and sometimes {{in the light from}} other stars.|$|E
5|$|<b>Vanadium</b> foil {{is used in}} {{cladding}} titanium {{to steel}} because it is compatible with both iron and titanium. The moderate thermal neutron-capture cross-section and the short half-life of the isotopes produced by neutron capture makes <b>vanadium</b> a suitable material for the inner structure of a fusion reactor.|$|E
5|$|<b>Vanadium</b> is more {{important}} in marine environments than terrestrial.|$|E
5|$|<b>Vanadium</b> occurs {{naturally}} in about 65 different minerals and in fossil fuel deposits. It {{is produced in}} China and Russia from steel smelter slag; other countries produce it either from the flue dust of heavy oil, or as a byproduct of uranium mining. It is mainly used to produce specialty steel alloys such as high-speed tool steels. The most important industrial <b>vanadium</b> compound, <b>vanadium</b> pentoxide, {{is used as a}} catalyst for the production of sulfuric acid.|$|E
5|$|<b>Vanadium</b> stabilizes {{the beta}} form of {{titanium}} {{and increases the}} strength and temperature stability of titanium. Mixed with aluminium in titanium alloys, it is used in jet engines, high-speed airframes and dental implants. The most common alloy for seamless tubing is Titanium 3/2.5 containing 2.5% <b>vanadium,</b> the titanium alloy of choice in the aerospace, defense and bicycle industries. Another common alloy, primarily produced in sheets, is Titanium 6AL-4V, a titanium alloy with 6% aluminium and 4% <b>vanadium.</b>|$|E
5|$|German chemist Martin Henze {{discovered}} <b>vanadium</b> in {{the blood}} cells (or coelomic cells) of Ascidiacea (sea squirts) in 1911.|$|E
5|$|In astrobiology, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that discrete <b>vanadium</b> accumulations on Mars could be a potential microbial biosignature, when used in conjunction with Raman spectroscopy and morphology.|$|E
5|$|Manganese has no {{satisfactory}} substitute in {{its major}} applications in metallurgy. In minor applications, (e.g., manganese phosphating), zinc and sometimes <b>vanadium</b> are viable substitutes.|$|E
5|$|Muscazone {{is another}} {{compound}} {{that has more}} recently been isolated from European specimens of the fly agaric. It {{is a product of}} the breakdown of ibotenic acid by ultra-violet radiation. Muscazone is of minor pharmacological activity compared with the other agents. Amanita muscaria and related species are known as effective bioaccumulators of vanadium; some species concentrate <b>vanadium</b> to levels of up to 400 times those typically found in plants. <b>Vanadium</b> is present in fruit-bodies as an organometallic compound called amavadine. The biological importance of the accumulation process is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Vanadinite is a lead {{chlorovanadate}} {{with the}} chemical formula Pb5(VO4)3Cl. It is composed (by weight) of 73.15% lead, 10.79% <b>vanadium,</b> 13.56% oxygen, and 2.50% chlorine. Each structural unit of vanadinite contains a chlorine ion surrounded by six divalent lead ions {{at the corners}} of a regular octahedron, with one of the lead ions provided by an adjoining vanadinite molecule. The distance between each lead and chlorine ion is 317picometres. The shortest distance between each lead ion is 4.48Å. The octahedron shares two of its opposite faces with that of neighbouring vanadinite units, forming a continuous chain of octahedrons. Each <b>vanadium</b> atom is surrounded by four oxygen atoms {{at the corners of}} an irregular tetrahedron. The distance between each oxygen and <b>vanadium</b> atom is either 1.72 or 1.76Å. Three oxygen tetrahedrons adjoin each of the lead octahedrons along the chain.|$|E
5|$|Yttrium {{can be used}} to deoxidize <b>vanadium</b> {{and other}} {{non-ferrous}} metals. Yttria stabilizes the cubic form of zirconia in jewelry.|$|E
5|$|Because {{titanium}} is biocompatible (non-toxic and not {{rejected by}} the body), it has many medical uses, including surgical implements and implants, such as hip balls and sockets (joint replacement) and dental implants that can stay in place for up to 20 years. The titanium is often alloyed with about 4% aluminium or 6% Al and 4% <b>vanadium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many <b>vanadium</b> oxyhalides (formula VOmXn) are known. The oxytrichloride and oxytrifluoride (VOCl3 and VOF3) are {{the most}} widely studied. Akin to POCl3, they are volatile, adopt {{tetrahedral}} structures in the gas phase, and are Lewis acidic.|$|E
5|$|Mineral {{matter in}} oil shale {{contains}} fine-grained silicate and carbonate minerals such as calcite, dolomite, siderite, quartz, rutile, orthoclase, albite, anorthite, muscovite, amphipole, marcasite, limonite, gypsum, nahcolite, dawsonite and alum. Some oil-shale deposits also contain metals such as <b>vanadium,</b> zinc, copper, uranium among others.|$|E
5|$|Other {{materials}} are often {{added to the}} iron/carbon mixture to produce steel with desired properties. Nickel and manganese in steel add to its tensile strength and make the austenite form of the iron-carbon solution more stable, chromium increases hardness and melting temperature, and <b>vanadium</b> also increases hardness while making it less prone to metal fatigue.|$|E
5|$|The {{isotopes}} of titanium {{range in}} atomic weight from 39.99 u (40Ti) to 57.966 u (58Ti). The primary decay mode before {{the most abundant}} stable isotope, 48Ti, is electron capture and the primary mode after is beta emission. The primary decay products before 48Ti are element 21 (scandium) isotopes and the primary products after are element 23 (<b>vanadium)</b> isotopes.|$|E
5|$|The maximum nickel {{concentration}} in Mahanoy Creek is 895 micrograms per liter and the maximum silver concentration is 0.9 micrograms per liter. The concentration of thallium does not exceed 0.02 micrograms per liter and {{the concentration of}} <b>vanadium</b> does not exceed 1 microgram per liter. The maximum concentration of zinc is 3.2 milligrams per liter.|$|E
