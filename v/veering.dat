5|$|By {{early on}} October 6, a low {{pressure}} area and circulation persisted over eastern Cuba in the middle levels of the atmosphere. The low drifted westward, and interacted with Hurricane Klaus to its east.

To its east, Tropical Storm Klaus continued to weaken; the depression absorbed most of Klaus and became the dominant system.

5|$|Hurricane Diane was the costliest Atlantic {{hurricane}} of its time. One {{of three}} hurricanes to hit North Carolina during the 1955 Atlantic hurricane season, it formed on August7 from a tropical wave between the Lesser Antilles and Cape Verde. Diane initially moved west-northwestward with {{little change in}} its intensity, but began to strengthen rapidly after turning to the north-northeast. On August12, the hurricane reached peak sustained winds of 105mph (165km/h), making it a Category 3 hurricane. Gradually weakening after <b>veering</b> back west, Diane made landfall near Wilmington, North Carolina, as a strong tropical storm on August17, just five days after Hurricane Connie struck near the same area. Diane weakened further after moving inland, {{at which point the}} United States Weather Bureau noted a decreased threat of further destruction. The storm turned to the northeast, and warm waters from the Atlantic Ocean helped produce record rainfall across the northeastern United States. On August19, Diane emerged into the Atlantic Ocean southeast of New York City, becoming extratropical two days later and completely dissipating by August23.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Fay was {{the first}} {{hurricane}} to make landfall on Bermuda since Emily in 1987. The sixth named storm and fifth hurricane of the 2014 Atlantic hurricane season, Fay evolved from a broad weather disturbance several hundred miles northeast of the Lesser Antilles on October 10. Initially a subtropical cyclone with an expansive wind field and asymmetrical cloud field, the storm gradually attained tropical characteristics as it turned north, transitioning into a tropical storm early on October11. Despite being plagued by disruptive wind shear {{for most of its}} duration, Tropical Storm Fay steadily intensified. <b>Veering</b> toward the east, Fay briefly achieved Category 1 hurricane status while making landfall on Bermuda early on October12. Wind shear eventually took its toll on Fay, causing the hurricane to weaken to a tropical storm later that day and degenerate into an open trough early on October13.|$|E

5|$|The 1804 Antigua–Charleston {{hurricane}} {{was first}} sighted on 3September as it swept past Saint Barthélemy, Saint Kitts, and Antigua, drifting toward the west-northwest and soon approaching Puerto Rico and the Turks and Caicos Islands. The storm reached the Bahamas while turning northward on 4September, nearing the northern Floridan coast by 6September. It remained offshore on 7September, gradually approaching the coast throughout the day, and eventually made landfall that evening along {{the coasts of}} Georgia and South Carolina. Observations in Savannah, Georgia, indicated north-to-northeast winds throughout 8September, though other reports recorded northeast-to-easterly gusts; at Charleston, South Carolina, however, winds, initially northeast-to-east, curved southeastward later in the storm. Little information exists on the hurricane's whereabouts between North Carolina and New England, with a single report at Norfolk, Virginia of east-northeasterly winds <b>veering</b> east-to-east-southeast from 7to 9September, suggesting the disturbance's passage west of there. A severe gale arrived in New England on 11and 12September, though the long pause between {{the departure of the}} hurricane from the Carolinas and its arrival in the northeastern United States evidences the possibility that the two systems may have been unrelated.|$|E
5|$|Recorded {{following}} the death of Corgan's mother and his divorce, 1998's Adore represented a significant change of style from the Pumpkins' previous guitar-based rock, <b>veering</b> into electronica. The record, cut with assistance from drum machines and studio drummers including Matt Walker, was infused with a darker aesthetic than much of the band's earlier work. The group also modified its public image, shedding its alternative rock look for a more subdued appearance. Although Adore received favorable reviews and was nominated for Best Alternative Performance at the Grammy Awards, the album had only sold about 830,000 copies in the United States {{by the end of the}} year, which led the music industry to consider it a failure. The album nonetheless sold three times as many copies overseas. The band began a seventeen-date, fifteen-city charity North American tour in support of Adore. At each stop on the tour, the band donated 100 percent of tickets sales to a local charity organization. The tour's expenses were entirely funded out of the band's own pockets. All told, the band donated over $2.8million to charity as a result of the tour.|$|E
