5|$|In {{addition}} to restricting photography of public art, closing {{a public park}} for a private event has also been controversial. In 2005 and 2006, almost all of Millennium Park was closed for a day for corporate events. On both occasions, {{as one of the}} park's primary attractions, Cloud Gate was the focus of controversy. On September 8, 2005, Toyota Motor Sales USA paid $800,000 to rent most venues in the park including Cloud Gate on AT Plaza from 6a.m. to 11p.m. On August 7, 2006, Allstate paid $700,000 to rent the park. For this price, Allstate acquired the <b>visitation</b> <b>rights</b> to a different set of features and only had exclusive access to Cloud Gate after 4p.m. These corporate closures denied tourists access to Kapoor's public sculpture, and commuters who walk through the park were forced to take alternative routes.

2500|$|The typical 'deal' in Japan is that, upon divorce, {{the father}} pays {{nothing for the}} child's support, and he never sees his child. It is noted that the {{decision}} by family courts in Japan with regard to both visitation and child support are unenforceable. There are several consequences to this lack of enforcement. At first, the courts strongly prefer that divorcing couples agree to child custody arrangements in mediation. If mediation fails, the court can intervene and {{has the power to}} determine which parent shall have parental authority. Article 819 of Japanese Civil Code states that [...] "In the case of judicial divorce, the court shall determine which parent shall have parental authority." [...] The primary custodian, or caregiver, as defined by the Japanese legal system, is the parent who has physical possession of the child at the time the case is initially brought to court in Japan. In other words, the court will likely choose the parent who already has possession. Colin P.A. Jones, a professor at Doshisha Law School, states that parental rights are not recognised in Japanese law, pointing out an academic debate in Japan over whether <b>visitation</b> was a <b>right</b> of the parent or the child or something else. In regard to visitation/access, the Supreme Court held in 2000 that <b>visitation</b> was a <b>right</b> of neither parent nor child.|$|R

50|$|The {{dissenting opinion}} noted that Mr. Abbott's rights {{are limited to}} <b>visitation</b> and the <b>right</b> to {{restrict}} the child's travel outside of Chile. The dissent also emphasized the fact that Mrs. Abbott has the exclusive right {{to make decisions about}} the child's education, medical care and day-to-day life. Contrary to the majority view, the dissent concluded that Mr. Abbott's limited parental rights fall well short of the Hague Convention's requirements for compulsory return of a child. Mr. Abbott had neither a right to determine the child's residence nor a right to make decisions about the child's care; Mr. Abbott's limited rights do not elevate his status to that of a custodial parent. According to the dissent, Mr. Abbott is not a custodial parent and cannot satisfy the requirements set forth in the Hague Convention for compulsory return of a child to his home country.|$|R
2500|$|The main {{impediment}} to Japan's becoming {{a party to}} the convention was that it would require a change in attitude of the legal system towards child custody rights.

Furthermore, Japan does not recognise joint parental authority or shared [...] "residence" [...] after divorce. [...] As a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, however, Japan is supposed to recognize the right of a child to obtain non-custodial parent visitation. However, the Supreme Court of Japan has ruled before entry into force of the convention that this does not amount to the right of non-custodial parents to see their children (it has ruled that state-enforced <b>visitation</b> is the <b>right</b> of neither parent nor children).

40|$|Briefing Paper, Centre for Comparative and Public Law (University of Hong Kong); UNC Legal Studies Research Paper No. 2374875 Discussions in Hong Kong about {{same-sex}} couples’ rights often {{focus on}} the issue of same-sex marriage. However, marriage {{is not the only way}} the government could extend rights to same-sex couples. In other parts of the world, governments have conferred rights upon gay and lesbian couples without legalising same-sex marriage. Some governments have developed programs that grant same-sex couples a subset of the rights that married heterosexual couples enjoy, for example the <b>right</b> to hospital <b>visitation,</b> the <b>right</b> to inheritance, and the right to sue in cases of fatal accidents. Other governments have developed programs that give same-sex couples access to all the rights that married heterosexual couples have, without using the word “marriage”. These compromise legal solutions have been given a variety of different names, such as “registered domestic partnerships”, “civil unions”, and “civil partnerships. ” 1 We conducted a public opinion survey to investigate Hong Kong people’s attitudes towards granting same-sex couples a variety of rights, including but not limited to the right to marry. We found that only 27 % of the public completely agreed that same-sex couples should be permitted to marry, and 12 % said that they somewhat agreed. However, when we asked about rights more generally, our findings were substantially different: 74 % of the public supported granting samesex couples either all or some of the rights that are accorded to heterosexual couples.
