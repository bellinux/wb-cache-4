5|$|The upper incisors are opisthodont, {{with the}} chewing edge located behind the <b>vertical</b> <b>plane</b> of the incisors. As is usual for the genus, the molars are brachyodont, low-crowned, and bunodont, with the cusps {{higher than the}} {{connecting}} crests, and accessory crests such as mesolophs are present. On the upper first molar, the frontmost cusp, the anterocone, {{is divided into two}} small cusps in young individuals, connected by a crest, but the two fuse with wear.|$|E
5|$|In {{the upper}} incisors, the chewing edges are located behind the <b>vertical</b> <b>plane</b> of the incisors; thus, they are opisthodont. The {{microstructure}} of the enamel {{of the lower}} incisor was reported in a 2005 study. The inner portion (portio interna, PI) is much thicker than the outer portion (portio externa, PE). The PI consists of Hunter-Schreger bands, which are uniserial (consisting of a single enamel prism), as in all myomorph rodents. The PE consists of radial enamel, with flattened prisms that are almost parallel to the junction between the enamel and the dentine. The microstructure {{is similar to that}} of Holochilus brasiliensis and displays several characters seen only in Myomorpha.|$|E

5|$|The {{well-developed}} upper incisors have orange enamel {{at their}} front surfaces and are slightly opisthodont (with their cutting edge behind the <b>vertical</b> <b>plane</b> of the incisors). The molars are brachyodont (low-crowned) and bear crests and cusps {{arranged in pairs}} opposite each other. The front cusp of M1, the anterocone, {{is divided into two}} smaller cusps {{on each side of the}} tooth by a valley, the anteromedian flexus. Both M1 and the second molar (M2) have a well-developed mesoloph (a crest near the middle of the tooth). Although M3 is relatively large, its back part is reduced.|$|E
5|$|The {{finish of}} a race {{is marked by a}} white line 5cm wide. The {{finishing}} position of athletes is determined by the order in which any part of their torso (as distinguished from the head, neck, arms, legs, hands or feet) reaches the <b>vertical</b> <b>plane</b> of the nearer edge of the finish line. Fully automatic timing systems (photo timing) {{are becoming more and more}} common at increasingly lower levels of track meets, improving the accuracy, while eliminating the need for eagle-eyed officials on the finish line. Fully automatic timing (FAT) is required for high level meets and any time a (sprint) record is set (though distance records can be accepted if timed by three independent stopwatches).|$|E
5|$|While countersteering {{is usually}} {{initiated}} by applying torque {{directly to the}} handlebars, on lighter vehicles such as bicycles, {{it can also be}} accomplished by shifting the rider’s weight. If the rider leans to the right relative to the bike, the bike leans to the left to conserve angular momentum, and the combined center of mass remains nearly in the same <b>vertical</b> <b>plane.</b> This leftward lean of the bike, called counter lean by some authors, will cause it to steer to the left and initiate a right-hand turn as if the rider had countersteered to the left by applying a torque directly to the handlebars. This technique may be complicated by additional factors such as headset friction and stiff control cables.|$|E
50|$|Phase linear {{transmission}} was {{realized in}} the DM6 from 1976. In the DM6, the speakers are mounted in different <b>vertical</b> <b>planes.</b>|$|R
30|$|According to (42), we {{see that}} the effect of the {{crosstalk}} coefficient on the achievable ergodic SE is difficult to derive for the general case. Alternatively, we first observe that the normalized crosstalk coefficient depends on the number of BS antennas in the horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>planes,</b> inter-antenna spacing in the corresponding horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>planes,</b> and users’ AoD. In the following, we present the effect of users’ AoD and inter-antenna spacing on the normalized crosstalk coefficient.|$|R
40|$|We study {{singular}} integral operators {{induced by}} 3 -dimensional Calderón-Zygmund kernels in the Heisenberg group. We show that if such an operator is L^ 2 bounded on <b>vertical</b> <b>planes,</b> with uniform constants, {{then it is}} also L^ 2 bounded on all intrinsic graphs of compactly supported C^ 1,α functions over <b>vertical</b> <b>planes.</b> In particular, the result applies to the operator R induced by the kernel K(z) = ∇_H z ^- 2, z ∈H∖{ 0 }, the horizontal gradient of the fundamental solution of the sub-Laplacian. The L^ 2 boundedness of R is connected {{with the question of}} removability for Lipschitz harmonic functions. As a corollary of our result, we infer that the intrinsic graphs mentioned above are non-removable. Apart from subsets of <b>vertical</b> <b>planes,</b> these are the first known examples of non-removable sets with positive and locally finite 3 -dimensional measure...|$|R

25|$|Plaxton {{launched}} a new design - the Panorama Elite - at the 1968 Commercial Motor Show in London. This essentially set the basic design of British coaches for the next 14 years. The design was stylish, with long sleek lines and gentle curve in the <b>vertical</b> <b>plane.</b> The windows were gasket glazed and the glass gently curved in the <b>vertical</b> <b>plane</b> to suit the body curve. The rear again used the large soup plate lights of the Panorama I, and the front grill was also from the Panorama I.|$|E
25|$|Woodcock {{have large}} eyes located {{high in the}} head, and their visual field is {{probably}} the largest of any bird, 360° in the horizontal plane and 180° in the <b>vertical</b> <b>plane.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{playback}} configuration {{is equally}} flexible. Again in post-production, the B-format recording can be decoded to {{any number of}} speakers arranged in both the horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>planes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Wall-planes - are <b>vertical</b> <b>planes</b> {{that are}} {{positioned}} 90degrees from the poi-spinner's heading. In this arrangement, the poi {{can be either}} in front of or behind the poi spinner.|$|R

25|$|Most orb weavers {{construct}} webs in a <b>vertical</b> <b>plane,</b> {{although there}} are exceptions, such as Uloborus diversus, which builds a horizontal web. During {{the process of making}} an orb web, the spider will use its own body for measurements.|$|E
25|$|Overhead {{transmission}} lines form a catenary for which vibration is predominately in the <b>vertical</b> <b>plane.</b> When {{more than one}} plane of vibration is anticipated, Stockbridge dampers may be mounted {{at right angles to}} each other. This is common when the cable runs in a vertical or off-horizontal plane, for example in cable-stayed bridges or radio mast guy-wires.|$|E
25|$|The {{sagittal}} plane is {{the plane that}} divides the body or an organ vertically into right and left sides. If this <b>vertical</b> <b>plane</b> runs directly {{down the middle of}} the body, it is called the midsagittal or median plane. If it divides the body into unequal right and left sides, it is called a para{{sagittal plane}}, or less commonly a longitudinal section.|$|E
5000|$|A {{theodolite}} [...] is {{a precision}} instrument for measuring angles in the horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>planes.</b> Theodolites are used mainly for surveying applications, {{and have been}} adapted for specialized purposes such as meteorology and rocket launch.|$|R
5000|$|Parallel - {{also known}} as [...] "spinning on tracks," [...] are <b>vertical</b> <b>planes</b> that are {{positioned}} {{on either side of}} the poi spinner. In these scenarios, the poi spinner's heading and the poi's planes are parallel.|$|R
40|$|Electro-mechanical {{device for}} {{measuring}} tilt angles {{in order to}} establish level base without optical reference is described. Angular displacement is detected by movement of bubble in conducting fluid containing electrode network. Electrical signal causes compensation for small movements in horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>planes...</b>|$|R
25|$|Teachers, and {{especially}} {{those who work with}} small children, should realize that students will interact more comfortably with a teacher when they are in same <b>vertical</b> <b>plane.</b> Used in this way, an understanding of vertical distance can become a tool for improved teacher-student communication. On the other hand, a disciplinarian might put this information to use in order to gain psychological advantage over an unruly student.|$|E
25|$|When the {{mandible}} {{is moved}} into a lateral excursion, the working side condyle (the condyle {{on the side of}} the mandible that moves outwards) only performs rotation (in the horizontal plane), while the balancing side condyle performs translation. During actual functional chewing, when the teeth are not only moved side to side, but also up and down when biting of the teeth is incorporated as well, rotation (in a <b>vertical</b> <b>plane)</b> also plays a part in both condyles.|$|E
25|$|Most birds cannot {{move their}} eyes, {{although}} there are exceptions, such as the great cormorant. Birds with eyes {{on the sides of}} their heads have a wide visual field, useful for detecting predators, while those with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate distances when hunting. The American woodcock probably has the largest visual field of any bird, 360° in the horizontal plane, and 180° in the <b>vertical</b> <b>plane.</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} {{we deal with}} the flow of natural {{convection}} between two <b>vertical</b> <b>planes</b> with horizontal temperature gradient. We show that periodic steady flow occur when Rayleigh number increases. Critical values are obtained numerically and a nonlinear analysis is presented according to Center manifold method...|$|R
50|$|The main prey {{species are}} small jumping spiders {{of the family}} Salticidae, but {{members of the family}} Thomisidae will {{occasionally}} be used. This wasp will also hunt spiders found on vertical or nearly <b>vertical</b> <b>planes,</b> such as cliffs, walls and the overturned root plates of wind thrown trees.|$|R
40|$|Spontaneous {{ignition}} of {{compressed hydrogen}} release through {{a length of}} tube with different internal geometries is numerically investigated using our previously developed model. Four types of internal geometries are considered: local contraction, local enlargement, abrupt contraction and abrupt enlargement. The presence of internal geometries was found to significantly increase the propensity to spontaneous ignition. Shock reflections from the surfaces of the internal geometries and the subsequent shock interactions further increase {{the temperature of the}} combustible mixture at the contact region. The presence of the internal geometry stimulates turbulence enhanced mixing between the shock-heated air and the escaping hydrogen, resulting in the formation of more flammable mixture. It was also found that forward-facing <b>vertical</b> <b>planes</b> are more likely to cause spontaneous ignition by producing the highest heating to the flammable mixture than backward-facing <b>vertical</b> <b>planes...</b>|$|R
25|$|To {{make the}} {{transition}} between drivers as seamless as possible, system designers have attempted to time-align (or phase adjust) the drivers by moving one or more driver mounting locations forward or back so that the acoustic center of each driver {{is in the same}} <b>vertical</b> <b>plane.</b> This may also involve tilting the face speaker back, providing a separate enclosure mounting for each driver, or (less commonly) using electronic techniques to achieve the same effect. These attempts have resulted in some unusual cabinet designs.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} days in orbit, the {{asymmetry}} of vertical eye movements in response to moving visual scenes is inverted. A return to symmetry of the vestibulo-ocular and optokinetic reflexes is then observed. Some studies have shown increased latencies and decreased peak velocities of saccades, while others have found just the opposite. It is possible that these conflicting results depend on when the measures were obtained during the mission. There is also a serious disruption of smooth pursuit eye movements, especially in the <b>vertical</b> <b>plane.</b>|$|E
25|$|Spatial {{location}} (see: Sound localization) {{represents the}} cognitive placement {{of a sound}} in an environmental context; including the placement of a sound on both the horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>plane,</b> {{the distance from the}} sound source and the characteristics of the sonic environment. In a thick texture, it is possible to identify multiple sound sources using a combination of spatial location and timbre identification. It is the main reason why we can pick the sound of an oboe in an orchestra and the words of a single person at a cocktail party.|$|E
40|$|Não informadoThe author used model casts from dental arches of 68 {{children}} born in Piracicaba, aged about 3 and 6 years old, {{to observe the}} frequency relationship between arches of Type I and Type II; {{presence or absence of}} primate spaces; kinds of deciduous canine anteroposterior relation; overbite and overjet degrees, in the deciduous dentitions with <b>vertical</b> terminal <b>plane</b> and terminal mesial step. The sample was composed of 34 children with deciduous molars in <b>vertical</b> terminal <b>plane</b> and 34 children with deciduous molars in terminal mesial step, distributed equally by age and according to sexo The findings may be summarized as follows: 1) Arches of Type I occurred more in the maxila and arches of Type II occurred more in the mandible in both classes of dentition, in <b>vertical</b> terminal <b>plane</b> and in terminal mesial step. 2) In the mandible, both patterns of terminal relation presented the same frequency, in arches of Type I and Type II. 3) In the maxila, dentitions with terminal mesial step presented arches of Type I more frequently than did the dentitions with <b>vertical</b> terminal <b>plane.</b> The opposite occurred with the frequency of arches of Type II. 4) Dentitions of Type I (arches Type I in maxilla and mandible), were more usual when terminal mesial step appeared and dentitions of Type II (arches of Type II in the maxilla and mandible) were more frequent in <b>vertical</b> terminal <b>plane.</b> 5) Primate spaces were found more in terminal mesial step dentitions, than in dentitions with <b>vertical</b> terminal <b>plane.</b> In the mandible, more accentuated diversity was observed. All cases studies presented bilaterality. 6) Regarding the mandible and the maxilla, the greater frequency of primate spaces and the lesser frequency of their absence were usually found more in dentitions with terminal mesial step than in <b>vertical</b> terminal <b>plane</b> dentitions. 7) As revealed by the association between primate spaces and arch types, there were 11 combination patterns for dentitions with <b>vertical</b> terminal <b>plane</b> and 6 for dentitions with terminal mesial step. 8) Dentitions with terminal mesial step presented with more frequency, Type A occlusal relationship between deciduous canines. In <b>vertical</b> terminal <b>plane</b> dentitions, Type B occlusal relationship occurred with greater frequency. 9) <b>Vertical</b> terminal <b>plane</b> dentitions showed moderate and severe overbite more frequent 1 y, and slight overbite with less frequency, than dentitions with terminal mesíal step. 10) In dentitions with <b>vertical</b> terminal <b>plane,</b> ideal overjet occurred less frequently and increased overjet more frequently than in terminal mesial step dentition...|$|R
