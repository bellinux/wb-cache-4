40|$|VARIOUS {{methods have}} at {{different}} times been suggested for expressing the ventilation efficiency of the respiratory apparatus by some simple formula, but {{up to the present}} no great popularity has been attained by any of these. It is essential that the results obtained for various subjects shall be directly comparable, and such figures as minute volume of respiration or vital capacity present certain difficulties. For example, the former depends on various factors, such as the state of tissue metabolism, while a certain degree of reduction of the vital capacity is compatible with perfectly efficient pulmonary ventilation at rest. Simonson (1) attempted to over-come some of these drawbacks with his ' caloric ventilation equivalent' which represented the minute volume of respiration per calories used, while Herbst (2) called the amount of oxygen retained by the body out of one litre of inspired air the ' utilization coefficient'. We have chosen {{for the purposes of this}} paper the formula first described by Anthony (3) as the ' <b>ventilation</b> <b>equivalent</b> for oxygen '.

Montelukast is a specific cysteinyl-leukotriene receptor 1 antagonist without known effects on the pulmonary vessels, which in theory should be advantageous with respect to gas exchange. In addition to lung function, we investigated the effects of montelukast on parameters of gas exchange and physical performance in 16 asthmatics with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in a double-blind cross-over placebo-controlled study. Subjects were tested at an ambient temperature of - 15 degrees C with a tread mill exercise protocol consisting of consecutive workloads of 80 % V'O(2 max) (6 min), rest (4 min), 60 % V'O(2 max) (6 min) and step increments of exercise until exhaustion. Montelukast reduced the maximum post-exercise fall in FEV 1 (P < 0. 01), improved the running time to exhaustion in 11 of 16 test subjects (one unchanged) (P = 0. 03), and reduced the Borg score at exhaustion (P = 0. 03) and the breathing frequency after 3 min at 60 % V'O(2 max) (P = 0. 03).

MethodsProspective, observational study. Population: 16 patients divided into two groups: (A) outpatient protocol (n= 9); and (B) standard in-hospital initiation with an elective admission (n= 7). Instrumentation: at baseline condition and treatment starting, arterial blood gases and nocturnal pulse-oximetry were performed. At the end of follow-up, arterial blood gases and patient compliance (ventilator's built-in counter) was determined. Efficiency was evaluated by calculating cost savings per ventilated patient for the financier and accumulated days of hospitalization saved. ResultsNo differences in baseline conditions were observed. Ventilation was effective in the two groups: {{a significant decrease in}} PaCO 2 and an increase in mean nocturnal oxygen saturation were observed after initiating ventilation. (Group A: PaCO 2 : 42. 9 ± 1. 5; SpO 2 : 91. 9 ± 1. 9; Group B:PaCO 2 : 44. 3 ± 6; SpO 2 : 91. 9 ± 2. 7).

We therefore {{examined the effects of}} exogenous surfactant on inflammatory and apoptotic factors in the lung in a rat model of lung ischemia–reperfusion injury. MethodsThe left lung in rats was subjected to ischemia for 120 minutes and reperfusion for as long as 240 minutes. Sham-treated animals underwent sham surgery and mechanical <b>ventilation</b> for <b>equivalent</b> times. Rats received porcine surfactant or saline solution intratracheally either before or just after ischemia. Lungs were analyzed histopathologically and for expressions of inducible nitric oxide, cytokines, and caspase- 3. ResultsLung ischemia–reperfusion injury resulted in worse lung histopathologic characteristics than in sham-operation animals. At 2 hours of reperfusion, lung ischemia–reperfusion injury animals showed increased pulmonary caspase- 3 expression. Moreover, lung ischemia–reperfusion injury resulted in inducible nitric oxide expression at all time points. Exogenous surfactant resulted in less inflammatory cell infiltration and edema in the lungs relative to saline-treated animals. Surfactant decreased activated caspase- 3 expression and increased inducible nitric oxide expression relative to saline-treated animals. At 4 hours of reperfusion, surfactant increased interleukin 6 and 10 expressions in the lung.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVES: To {{compare the}} effect of {{montelukast}} and the long-acting beta(2) -agonist salmeterol on cardiopulmonary exercise economy and physical performance in adult patients with asthma during exercise. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Asthmatic patients (n = 18), aged 18 to 35 years with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB), using a double-blind, double-dummy cross-over design. Montelukast, 10 mg/d, was compared to inhaled salmeterol, 50 microg bid. The study medication was administered for at least 5 days prior to testing, with a washout period of at least 5 days. Treadmill exercise tests (5. 3 % inclination, - 15 degrees C ambient temperature) were performed at work loads of 80 % of maximal oxygen uptake (Vo(2) max) [6 min], rest (4 min), 60 % of Vo(2) max (6 min), and finally step increments until exhaustion. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: We investigated parameters of gas exchange, physical performance, and lung function. After montelukast, the oxygen pulse was higher than after salmeterol, at 80 % of Vo(2) max (p = 0. 035), and 6 min at 60 % of Vo(2) max (p = 0. 011).

Deficits in blood O 2 stores (O 2 B) were noted during LBNP with repayment of O 2 B during recovery being related to the intensity of LBNP stress.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundObstructive {{sleep apnea}} (OSA) is a {{disorder}} characterized by repetitive obstructions {{of the upper}} airway. Individuals with OSA experience intermittent hypoxia, hypercapnia, and arousals during sleep, resulting in increased sympathetic activation. Chemoreflex activation, arising from the resultant oscillatory disturbances in blood gases from OSA, exerts control over ventilation, and may induce increases in sympathetic vasoconstriction, contributing to increased long-term risks for hypertension (HTN) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). MethodsTo evaluate whether OSA elicits exaggerated ventilatory responses to exercise in young men, 14 overweight men with OSA and 16 overweight men without OSA performed maximal ramping cycle ergometer exercise tests. Oxygen consumption (VO 2), <b>ventilation,</b> (VE), ventilatory <b>equivalents</b> for oxygen (VE/VO 2) and carbon dioxide (VE/VCO 2), and VE/VCO 2 slope were measured. ResultsThe VO 2 response to exercise did not differ between groups. The VE, VE/VCO 2, VE/VO 2 were higher (p< 0. 05, 0. 002, and p< 0. 02, respectively) in the OSA group across all workloads. The VE/VCO 2 slope was greater in the OSA group (p< 0. 05). The VE/VCO 2 slope and AHI were significantly correlated (r= 0. 56, p< 0. 03). Thus, young, overweight men with OSA exhibit increased ventilatory responses to exercise when compared to overweight controls. This may reflect alterations in chemoreflex sensitivity, and contribute to increased sympathetic drive and HTN risk...|$|R

They show that wheels and wheel-housing flows are responsible for a substantial part of the total aerodynamic drag on passenger vehicles. Previous investigations have also shown that aerodynamic resistance moment acting on rotating wheels, sometimes referred to as ventilation resistance or ventilation torque is a significant contributor to the total aerodynamic resistance of the vehicle; therefore it should not be neglected when designing the wheel-housing area. This work presents a numerical study of the wheel ventilation resistance moment and factors that affect it, using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). It is demonstrated how pressure and shear forces acting on different rotating parts of the wheel affect the ventilation torque. It is also shown how a simple change of rim design can lead to a significant decrease in power consumption of the vehicle. A way of introducing ventilation torque into the driving resistance equation is discussed. The results show {{that it is possible to}} assess ventilation resistance moment using CFD.

40|$|ObjectiveSelected {{patients}} {{appear to}} benefit from off-pump coronary artery bypass compared with conventional coronary artery bypass with cardiopulmonary bypass. It is unknown whether elderly patients undergoing isolated {{coronary artery bypass graft}}ing operations derive any benefit when performed off-pump. We hypothesized that off-pump coronary bypass offers a greater operative benefit to elderly patients when compared with conventional coronary artery bypass. MethodsA total of 1993 elderly patients (age ≥ 80 years) underwent isolated, primary coronary artery bypass graft operations at 16 different statewide centers from 2003 to 2008. Patients were stratified into 2 groups: conven-tional coronary artery bypass (n =  1589, age =  82. 5  ± 2. 4 years) and off-pump bypass (n =  404, age =  83. 0  ± 2. 4 years).  Preoperative risk, intraoperative findings, postoperative complications, and costs were evaluated. ResultsPatients undergoing off-pump bypass grafting were marginally older (P = . 001) and had higher rates of preoperative atrial fibrillation (14. 6 % vs 10. 0 %; P = . 01) and New York Heart Association class IV heart failure (29. 7 % vs 21. 1 %; P < . 001) than did those having conventional coronary bypass grafting. Other patient risk factors and operative variables, including Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk of mortality, were similar in both groups (P = . 15). Compared with off-pump bypass, conventional coronary bypass incurred higher blood transfusion rates (2. 0  ± 1. 7 units vs 1. 6  ± 1. 9 units; P = . 05) as well as more postoperative atrial fibrillation (28. 4 % vs 21. 5 %; P = . 003), prolonged ventilation (14. 7 % vs 11. 4 %; P = . 05), and major complications (20. 1 % vs 15. 6 %; P = . 04). Importantly, postoperative stroke (2. 6 % vs 1. 7 %; P = . 21), renal failure (8. 1 % vs 6. 2 %; P = . 12), and postoperative length of stay (P = . 41) were no different between groups. Despite more complications in patients having conventional bypass, operative mortality (P = . 53) and hospital costs (P = . 43) were similar to those of patients having off-pump procedures. ConclusionsPerformance of coronary artery bypass grafting among octogenarian patients is safe and effective. Off-pump coronary artery bypass confers shorter postoperative <b>ventilation</b> but <b>equivalent</b> mortality to conventional coronary artery bypass.

Main conclusions from the new compilation are: (1) The Suigetsu atmospheric 14 C record on its varve counted time scale reflects all 14 C plateaus, their internal structures and relative length previously identified, but implies a rise in the average 14 C plateau age by 200 - 700 14 C yr during LGM and early deglacial times. (2) Based on different 14 C ages of coeval atmospheric and planktic 14 C plateaus, marine surface water Delta 14 C may have temporarily dropped to an equivalent of ~ 0 yr in low-latitude lagoon waters, but reached > 2500 14 C yr both in stratified subpolar waters and in upwelled waters such as in the South China Sea. These values differ significantly from a widely assumed constant global planktic Delta 14 C value of 400 yr. (3) Suites of deglacial planktic Delta 14 C values are closely reproducible in 14 C records measured at neighboring core sites. (4) Apparent deep-water 14 C <b>ventilation</b> ages (<b>equivalents</b> of benthic Delta 14 C), deduced from the sum of planktic Delta 14 C and coeval benthic-planktic 14 C differences, vary from 500 up to > 5000 yr in LGM and deglacial ocean basins...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{physiological}} responses of professional and elite road cyclists during an incremental cycle ergometer test. Twenty-five elite cyclists (EC; 23 ± 1 yr) and 25 professional cyclists (PC; 25 ± 2 yr) performed a ramp protocol (increases of 25 W. min- 1) during which the following parameters were measured: oxygen consumption (V̇O 2), pulmonary <b>ventilation</b> (VE), ventilatory <b>equivalents</b> for oxygen and carbon dioxide (VE. V̇O 2 - 1 and VE. V̇CO 2 - 1, respectively), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), ventilatory thresholds 1 and 2 (VT 1 and VT 2, respectively), blood lactate, and electromyographic activity (EMG) of the vastus lateralis. Significant differences existed between the two groups mainly at submaximal intensities, since both VT 1 and VT 2 occurred at a higher exercise intensity (p < 0. 001) in PC than in EC (VT 2 : 80. 4 ± 6. 6 vs 87. 0 ± 5. 9 % V̇O 2 max in EC and PC, respectively). Lactate levels showed a similar response in both groups at low-to-moderate intensities (< 300 W), and thereafter blood lactate was significantly higher in EC. Finally, the 'electromyographic threshold' (EMG(T)) occurred at a significantly higher intensity (p < 0. 05) in PC when compared to EC (64. 7 ± 14. 2 vs 56. 0 ± 14. 9 % V̇O 2 max, respectively). It was concluded that, in comparison with EC, PC exhibit some remarkable physiological characteristics such as a high VT 2, an important reliance on fat metabolism even at high power outputs, and several neuromuscular adaptations.

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: To {{test whether}} {{ventilatory}} thresholds, measured during an exercise test, could be assessed using time varying analysis of respiratory sinus arrhythmia frequency (f(RSA)). METHODS: Fourteen sedentary subjects and 12 endurance athletes performed a graded and maximal exercise test on a cycle ergometer: initial load 75 W (sedentary subjects) and 150 W (athletes), increments 37. 5 W/ 2 min. f(RSA) was extracted from heart period series using an evolutive model. First (T(V 1)) and second (T(V 2)) ventilatory thresholds were determined {{from the time}} course curves of <b>ventilation</b> and ventilatory <b>equivalents</b> for O(2) and CO(2). RESULTS: f(RSA) was accurately extracted from all recordings and positively correlated to respiratory frequency (r = 0. 96 (0. 03), p< 0. 01). In 21 of the 26 subjects, two successive non-linear increases were determined in f(RSA), defining the first (T(RSA 1)) and second (T(RSA 2)) f(RSA) thresholds. When expressed {{as a function of}} power, T(RSA 1) and T(RSA 2) were not significantly different from and closely linked to T(V 1) (r = 0. 99, p< 0. 001) and T(V 2) (r = 0. 99, p< 0. 001), respectively. In the five remaining subjects, only one non-linear increase was observed close to T(V 2). Significant differences (p< 0. 04) were found between athlete and sedentary groups when T(RSA 1) and T(RSA 2) were expressed in terms of absolute and relative power and percentage of maximal aerobic power. In the sedentary group, T(RSA 1) and T(RSA 2) were 150. 3 (18. 7) W and 198. 3 (28. 8) W, respectively, whereas in the athlete group T(RSA 1) and T(RSA 2) were 247. 3 (32. 8) W and 316. 0 (28. 8) W, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic analysis of f(RSA) provides a useful tool for identifying ventilatory thresholds during graded and maximal exercise test in sedentary subjects and athletes...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we {{explored}} {{the efficacy of}} upper-room ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) in reducing the concentration of Serratia marcescens and Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) aerosols in enclosed places. We constructed a facility (4. 5 m x 3 m x 2. 9 m) in which both ceiling- and wall-mounted UV fixtures (UV output: 10 W and 5 W respectively) were installed. The use of ceiling- and wall-mounted UV fixtures (total UV output: 15 W) without mixing fan reduced the concentration of S. marcescens aerosols by 46 % (range: 22 - 80 %) at 2 {{air changes per hour}} (ACH) and 53 % (range: 40 - 68 %) at 6 ACH. The use of ceiling- and wall-mounted UV fixtures with mixing fan increased the UV effectiveness in inactivating S. marcescens aerosols to 62 % (range: 50 - 78 %) at 2 ACH and to 86 % (81 - 89 %) at 6 ACH. For BCG aerosols, UV effectiveness in inactivating BCG aerosols at 6 ACH were 52 % (range: 11 - 69 %) by ceiling-mounted UV fixture only (total UV output: 10 W) and 64 % (51 - 83 %) by both ceiling- and wall-mounted UV fixtures (total UV output: 15 W). Our results indicated that the <b>equivalent</b> <b>ventilation</b> rate attributable to upper-room UVGI for BCG aerosols ranged from 1 ACH to 22 ACH for ceiling-mounted UV fixtures and from 6. 4 ACH to 28. 5 ACH for ceiling- and wall-mounted UV fixtures. Both generalized linear and generalized additive models were fitted to all our data. The regression results indicated that the number of UV fixtures, use of mixing fan, and air exchange rate significantly affected UV effectiveness (p < 0. 01, 0. 01, 0. 01 respectively). However, the strain difference (S. marcescens vs. BCG) appeared less important in UV effectiveness (p = 0. 26). Our results also indicated that UV effectiveness increased at higher temperature ((italic) p(/italic) < 0. 01), lower dry-bulb temperature ((italic) p(/italic) = 0. 21), and colder air from a supply grill located near the ceiling (p = 0. 22) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to examine the change in pulmonary <b>ventilation</b> (V_E), ventilatory <b>equivalent</b> of oxygen (VE_O_ 2) and lactic acid (LA) in relation to oxygen uptake (V_O_ 2) as predictors of the lactate threshold (LT). Eight healthy male (21. 9 ± 3. 0 years) subjects conducted three incremental-load tests. In each test the initial work rate consisted of 4 minutes of unloaded pedaling (" 0 " load) followed by incremental-load work of 360 Kgm • min^- 1 at 60 rpm for trial I and trial II, while during trial III the work rate consisted of 540 Kgm • min^- 1 of incremental-load work at 90 rpm. Work load was increased every third minute until the subject reached voluntary exhaustion. Blood samples from a forearm vein were collected during trial II (60 rpm) and trial III (90 rpm) and analyzed for lactic acid. In our subjects the measured (x̄ ± SD) lowest VE_O_ 2 for O_ 2 in relation to V_O_ 2 for trial I of 22. 9 ± 1. 9 occurred at a V_O_ 2 of 1. 27 ± 0. 8 L • min^- 1. For trial II the VE_O_ 2 of 22. 4 ± 1. 3 occurred at a V_O_ 2 of 1. 30 ± 0. 09 L • min^- 1, while for trial III a VE_O_ 2 of 24. 4 ± 2. 5 occurred at a V_O_ 2 of 1. 84 ± 0. 15 L • min^- 1. The lowest VE_O_ 2 and onset of LA accumulation as calculated from individual exponential equations relating V_E to V_O_ 2 yielded V_O_ 2 values at 1. 77 ± 0. 18 L • min^- 1 and 1. 74 ± 0. 25 L • min^- 1 for trial II, and 1. 83 ± 0. 19 L • min^- 1 and 2. 02 ± 0. 53 during trial III. Utilizing ln[LA]-ln V_O_ 2 equations, the LT occurred at a V_O_ 2 of 1. 30 ± 0. 07 L • min^- 1 during trial II and 1. 85 ± 0. 12 L • min^- 1 during trial III. It was concluded that during the 60 rpm test that the lactate threshold was best predicted by measured lowest VE_O_ 2 and the plot of the In[LA] to In V_O_ 2 relationship. The methods used in this study provide a valid and reliable estimate of the lactate threshold and support the use of measured lowest VE_O_ 2, a respiratory gas exchange measure, as an indirect measure of the lactate threshold...|$|R
