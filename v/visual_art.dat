40|$|<b>Visual</b> <b>arts</b> {{education}} in Australia has undergone significant changes since the 1950 s, {{particularly in the}} primary school years. An interest {{in the history of}} <b>visual</b> <b>arts</b> education, and how it has shaped <b>visual</b> <b>arts</b> pedagogy and curriculum, motivated a narrative inquiry research project to document the experiences of 21 <b>visual</b> <b>arts</b> educators in Western Australia. The participants’ stories were primarily documented through open-ended interviews; however, some participants also wrote letters to the researchers and shared documents from their lived experience in <b>visual</b> <b>arts</b> education. All of the participants had studied <b>visual</b> <b>arts</b> as school students, and gone on to become <b>visual</b> <b>arts</b> teachers, artist-teachers, senior <b>visual</b> <b>arts</b> advisors, researchers, policy and curriculum writers, and advocates for <b>visual</b> <b>arts</b> education. Sharing narratives of <b>visual</b> <b>arts</b> education from the past 66 years has illuminated the history of policy and teaching practice in primary school <b>visual</b> <b>arts,</b> including stereotypes and public perceptions, pedagogical models employed in curricula, and international influences that shaped <b>visual</b> <b>arts</b> education. Reflecting on these narratives has given rise to four ‘lessons’ that can be learnt from history and applied to contemporary <b>visual</b> <b>arts</b> education...|$|R

5|$|Scottish art in {{the eighteenth}} century is the body of <b>visual</b> <b>art</b> made in Scotland, by Scots, or about Scottish subjects, {{in the eighteenth century}}.

5|$|At {{least a dozen}} {{recordings}} {{were issued}} {{in the wake of}} the success of the Nonesuch recording, and the work enjoyed significant exposure in a number of artistic media worldwide. The work was repeatedly used by filmmakers in the 1990s and onwards to elicit a sense of pathos or sorrow, including as an accompaniment to a plane crash in Peter Weir's Fearless (1993), and in the soundtrack to Julian Schnabel's Basquiat (1996).

40|$|The {{research}} {{examined the}} relevance of the <b>visual</b> <b>arts</b> curriculum content with the view of assessing {{the extent to which it}} equips pre-service <b>visual</b> <b>arts</b> teachers with the knowledge and skills required for effective teaching. The study adopted a descriptive case study design. Data were collected from three purposively selected National Teacher Colleges (NTCs), six tutors and 90 final year pre-service <b>visual</b> <b>arts</b> teachers participated in this study. The research findings showed that teacher education institutions are inadequately preparing pre-service <b>visual</b> <b>arts</b> teachers because of the gaps in the <b>Visual</b> <b>Arts</b> Curriculum (VAC) used in NTCs. Some of these gaps are attributed to the structure of the <b>visual</b> <b>arts</b> curriculum tutors use in NTCs. The <b>visual</b> <b>arts</b> curriculum lacks explicit <b>visual</b> <b>arts</b> assessment strategies; it has wide and combined <b>visual</b> <b>arts</b> content to be covered within a short period of two years and the limited knowledge of the available art materials, tools and equipment. The research recommended the restructuring of the VAC to accommodate more practical; and the introduction of specialized knowledge in the <b>visual</b> <b>arts</b> education (VAE) to enable tutors decipher practical knowledge from the theory studied so as to adopt an integrated approach in VAE curriculum...|$|R

5|$|In archaeological nomenclature, Norte Chico is a pre-ceramic {{culture of}} the pre-Columbian Late Archaic; it {{completely}} lacked ceramics and apparently had almost no <b>visual</b> <b>art.</b> The most impressive achievement of the civilization was its monumental architecture, including large earthwork platform mounds and sunken circular plazas. Archaeological evidence suggests use of textile technology and, possibly, the worship of common god symbols, both of which recur in pre-Columbian Andean cultures. Sophisticated government is assumed to have been required to manage the ancient Norte Chico. Questions remain over its organization, particularly the influence of food resources on politics.|$|E

40|$|<b>Visual</b> <b>Arts</b> {{education}} {{is fundamental to}} an effective school curriculum for primary and secondary students. It provides students with opportunities for expression and personal growth, essential to a holistic education. Recently, in Perth, Western Australia (WA) several secondary <b>Visual</b> <b>Arts</b> educators expressed {{what they saw as}} a significant deficit in the outcomes of Making and Responding in <b>Visual</b> <b>Arts,</b> evidenced in their Year 7 students who had recently graduated from primary school. Consequently, this research investigated the extent of Year 7 students’ prior <b>Visual</b> <b>Arts</b> experiences upon entry into secondary school. The research engaged a qualitative research approach to gather rich narratives regarding <b>Visual</b> <b>Arts</b> experiences from both primary and secondary teachers. These teachers reflected on their own perceptions of <b>Visual</b> <b>Arts</b> education in contemporary Perth. This project provided new insights into the current state of <b>Visual</b> <b>Arts</b> education in the eastern suburbs of Perth. In particular, it identified what <b>Visual</b> <b>Arts</b> exposure the students have within primary education and, subsequently, implications for the secondary context. Although this is a relatively small study, the findings reinforce that there is a <b>Visual</b> <b>Arts</b> education deficit in local primary schools, particularly in the generalist classrooms investigated...|$|R
