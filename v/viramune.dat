40|$|Nevirapine (NVP) was {{the first}} nonnucleoside reverse {{transcriptase}} inhibitor (NNRTI) approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1996, {{for the treatment of}} HIV infection. Current treatment guidelines include NVP as a component of a recommended alternative NNRTI regimen, which may be the preferred regimen for patients with established cardiovascular risk factors since NVP has minimal untoward effects on serum lipids. Two randomized and controlled clinical trials established the noninferior virologic efficacy of twice-daily NVP versus ritonavir-boosted atazanavir (ATV/r), a protease inhi-bitor with limited effects on serum lipids, each drug on a background regimen of once-daily (QD) tenofovir (TDF) /emtricitabine (FTC). An extended-release (XR) formulation of NVP was developed since QD dosing and reduced pill burdens have been shown to improve regimen adherence.

40|$|It was {{previously}} found that certain nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) possess virucidal activity against {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1), and {{it was suggested that}} the tight-binding mode of inhibition of reverse transcriptase might be important for this virucidal activity (Borkow et al., J. Virol. 71 : 3023 - 3030, 1997). To test this, we compared six different NNRTI, including three tight-binding NNRTI, namely UC 781, efavirenz (EFV) (Sustiva), and 5 -chloro- 3 -phenylsulfonylindole- 2 -carboxamide (CSIC), and three rapid-equilibrium NNRTI, delavirdine (DLV) (Rescriptor), nevirapine (NVP) (<b>Viramune),</b> and UC 84, in a variety of virucidal tests. Incubation of isolated HIV- 1 virions with UC 781, EFV, or CSIC rapidly inactivated the virus, whereas DLV, NVP, and UC 84 were ineffective in this respect. Exposure of H 9 + cells chronically infected by HIV- 1 to the tight-binding NNRTI abolished the infectivity of nascent virus subsequently produced by these cells following removal of extracellular drug, thereby preventing cell-to-cell virus transmission in the absence of exogenous drug. In contrast, cell-to-cell transmission of HIV was blocked by DLV, NVP, and UC 84 only when the drug remained in the extracellular medium. Pretreatment of uninfected lymphocytoid cells with UC 781, EFV, or CSIC, but not DLV, NVP, or UC 84, protected these cells from subsequent HIV- 1 infection in the absence of extracellular drug. The protective effect was dependent on both the dose of NNRTI and the viral load. The overall virucidal efficacy of the tight-binding NNRTI tested was CSIC > UC 781 ≃ EFV. We conclude that the tight-binding mode of inhibition is an essential characteristic for virucidal NNRTI and that antiviral potency is an insufficient predictor for virucidal utility of NNRTI...|$|E
40|$|Generic {{antiretroviral}} {{therapy is}} {{the mainstay of}} HIV treatment in resource-limited settings, yet {{there is little evidence}} confirming the bioequivalence of generic and brand name formulations. We compared the steady-state pharmacokinetics of lamivudine, stavudine and nevirapine in HIV-infected subjects who were receiving a generic formulation (Triomune) or the corresponding brand formulations (Epivir, Zerit, and <b>Viramune).</b> An open-label, randomized, crossover study was carried out in 18 HIV-infected Ugandan subjects stabilized on Triomune- 40. Subjects received lamivudine (150 mg), stavudine (40 mg), and nevirapine (200 mg) in either the generic or brand formulation twice a day for 30 days, before switching to the other formulation. At the end of each treatment period, blood samples were collected over 12 h for pharmacokinetic analysis. The main outcome measures were the mean AUC(0 - 12 h) and C(max). Bioequivalence was defined as a geometric mean ratio between the generic and brand name within the 90 % confidence interval of 0. 8 - 1. 25. The geometric mean ratios and the 90 % confidence intervals were: stavudine C(max), 1. 3 (0. 99 - 1. 71) and AUC(0 - 12 h), 1. 1 (0. 87 - 1. 38); lamivudine C(max), 0. 8 (0. 63 - 0. 98) and AUC(0 - 12 h), 0. 8 (0. 65 - 0. 99); and nevirapine C(max), 1. 1 (0. 95 - 1. 23) and AUC(0 - 12 h), 1. 1 (0. 95 - 1. 31). The generic formulation was not statistically bioequivalent to the brand formulations during steady state, although exposures were comparable. A mixed random effects model identified about 50 % intersubject variability in the pharmacokinetic parameters. These findings provide support for the use of Triomune in resource-limited settings, although identification of the sources of intersubject variability in these populations is critical...|$|E

From 2000 to 2011, PMTCT programs included in the <b>Viramune</b> Donation Programme (VDP) were prospectively followed. Each institution included in the VDP provided data on program implementation, type of management institution, number of PMTCT sites, key programs outputs (HIV counseling and testing, NVP regimens received by mothers and newborns). Nevirapine Coverage Ratio (NCR), defined {{as the number of}} women who should have received nevirapine (observed HIV prevalence x number of women in antenatal care), was used to measure performance. Included programs were followed every six months through progress reports. A total of 64 programs in 25 sub-Saharan African countries were included. The mean program follow-up was 48. 0 months (SD = 24. 5); 20, 084, 490 women attended in antenatal clinics were included. The overall mean NCR was 0. 52 (SD = 0. 25), with an increase from 0. 37 to 0. 57 between the first and last progress reports (p<. 0001); NCR increased by 3. 26 % per year-program. Between the first and the last report, the number of women counseled and tested increased from 64. 3 % to 86. 0 % (p<. 0001), the number of women post-counseled from 87. 5 % to 91. 3 % (p = 0. 08). After mixed linear regression analysis, type of responsible institution, number of women attended in ANC, and program initiation in 2005 - 2006 were significant predictive factors associated with the NCR. The effect of the time period increased from earlier to later periods. A longitudinal assessment of large PMTCT programs shows that scaling-up of programs was increased in sub-Saharan African countries. The PMTCT coverage increased throughout the study period, especially after 2006. Performance may be better for programs with a small or medium number of women attended in ANC. Identification of factors that predict PMTCT program performance may help in the development and expansion of additional large PMTCT services in sub-Saharan Africa...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background HIV/AIDS {{incidence}} and mortality rates have decreased in the U. S. since 1996. Accompanying the longer life spans of those {{diagnosed with the}} disease, however, is a tremendous rise in expenditures on medication. The objective {{of this study is}} to describe the trends in utilization of, spending on, and market shares of antiretroviral medications in the U. S. Medicaid Program. Antiretroviral drugs include nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), protease inhibitors (PIs), nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), and fusion inhibitors (FIs). Methods Utilization and payment data from 1991 to 2005 are provided by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Descriptive summary analyses were used to assess quarterly prescription numbers and amounts of payment. Results The total number of prescriptions for antiretrovirals increased from 168, 914 in 1991 to 2. 0 million in 1998, and 3. 0 million in 2005, a 16. 7 -fold increase over 15 years. The number of prescriptions for NRTIs reached 1. 6 million in 2005. Prescriptions for PIs increased from 114 in 1995 to 932, 176 in 2005, while the number of prescriptions for NNRTIs increased from 1, 339 in 1996 to 401, 272 in 2005. The total payment for antiretroviral drugs in the U. S. Medicaid Program increased from US$ 30. 6 million in 1991 to US$ 1. 6 billion in 2005, a 49. 8 -fold increase. In 2005, NRTIs as a class had the highest payment market share. These drugs alone accounted for US$ 787. 9 million in Medicaid spending (50. 8 percent of spending on antiretrovirals). Payment per prescription for each drug, with the exception of Agenerase ®, increased, at least somewhat, over time. The relatively expensive drugs in 2005 included Trizivir ® ($ 1040) and Combivir ® ($ 640), as well as Reyataz ® ($ 750), Lexiva ® ($ 700), Sustiva ® ($ 420), <b>Viramune</b> ® ($ 370), and Fuzeon ® ($ 1914). Conclusion The tremendous growth in antiretroviral spending is due primarily to rising utilization, secondarily to the entry of newer, more expensive antiretrovirals, and, finally, in part to rising per-prescription cost of existing medications. </p...|$|E
40|$|Magister Pharmaceuticae - MPharmCo-crystals are a {{solid phase}} {{phenomena}} that could enhance the physicochemical properties {{of an active}} pharmaceutical ingredient. A co-crystal has never been incorporated into a liquid dosage form with the assurance of maintaining its co-crystal state until absorption under defined conditions. This study aims to develop a liquid formulation with a nevirapine co-crystal. A protocol was developed to investigate all the five co-formers {{that were used to}} make the nevirapine co-crystals to-date. The most appropriate co-former was selected for a liquid dosage form to study the integrity and the scaling up of the co-crystal in a suspension formulation. Co-formers used were viz. saccharin, glutaric acid, salicylic acid, rac-tartaric acid and maleic acid. These were characterized according to their physical, chemical, pharmacological and pharmaceutical properties. A grading scale was used to select the most appropriate co-former for a suspension formulation. Comparatively, saccharin produced the best combination of physical, chemical, pharmacological and pharmaceutical properties, especially with regard to the particle size and the specific gravity which proved to be very useful as optimal criteria for suspension formulation. Upon selection of the ideal co-former, scale-up of the nevirapine saccharin co-crystal was performed from a small scale of 350 mg to a large scale of 5 g. Nevirapine-saccharin (NVSC) co-crystals were prepared utilizing the slow evaporation technique, using methanol as the solvent and the percentage yield of the co-crystals were > 80 %. The identity of co-crystals was confirmed using hot stage microscopy (HSM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), fourier transform infra- red (FTIR) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Three co-crystal suspension formulations were prepared using the excipients identified in the branded, Viramune® suspension, with each formulation containing viscosity enhancers such as aerosil 200, carbopol 971 G and carbopol 974 P. To ascertain the co- crystal integrity in the suspension, it was filtered and the filtrate was identified with DSC and FTIR while the filtered solution was identified with ultraviolet spectroscopy (UV). The co-crystal suspension formulation with optimal pH, viscosity and assurance of co-crystal integrity was the carbopol 974 P formulation. The UV and DSC of the filtrate of the suspension revealed that the co-crystal had not separated into its individual components and remained intact while in suspension form irrespective of the excipients added. This formulation proceeded to the quality control stage. It was assessed for its pH, viscosity and dissolution according to the USP 32 standards and compared to the branded nevirapine suspension, <b>Viramune</b> ®, presently on the market. The suspension was characterized for particle size, zeta potential and polydispersity index. The dissolution results assayed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) revealed a drug release of 86 % in the Viramune® suspension while the NVSC co- crystal suspension achieved a drug release of 94 % within 30 minutes of dissolution.
