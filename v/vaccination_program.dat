5|$|By {{the end of}} 1975, {{smallpox}} persisted only in the Horn of Africa. Conditions {{were very}} difficult in Ethiopia and Somalia, where there were few roads. Civil war, famine, and refugees made the task even more difficult. An intensive surveillance and containment and <b>vaccination</b> <b>program</b> was undertaken in these countries in early and mid-1977, {{under the direction of}} Australian microbiologist Frank Fenner. As the campaign neared its goal, Fenner and his team {{played an important role in}} verifying eradication. The last naturally occurring case of indigenous smallpox (Variola minor) was diagnosed in Ali Maow Maalin, a hospital cook in Merca, Somalia, on 26 October 1977. The last naturally occurring case of the more deadly Variola major had been detected in October 1975 in a two-year-old Bangladeshi girl, Rahima Banu.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{both its}} {{effectiveness}} and safety, in 2009 the World Health Organization {{recommended that the}} rotavirus vaccine be offered to all children globally. Two commercial rotavirus vaccines exist and several more are in development. In Africa and Asia these vaccines reduced severe disease among infants and countries that have put in place national immunization programs have seen {{a decline in the}} rates and severity of disease. This vaccine may also prevent illness in non-vaccinated children by reducing the number of circulating infections. Since 2000, the implementation of a rotavirus <b>vaccination</b> <b>program</b> in the United States has substantially decreased the number of cases of diarrhea by as much as 80 percent. The first dose of vaccine should be given to infants between 6 and 15 weeks of age. The oral cholera vaccine {{has been found to be}} 50–60% effective over 2years.|$|E
5|$|Polio {{vaccination}} {{programs have}} received resistance from {{some people in}} Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nigeria (the three countries with remaining polio cases). There is distrust surrounding vaccines in Pakistan as in 2011 the CIA organized a fake <b>vaccination</b> <b>program</b> {{in order to help}} find Osama Bin Laden. Additionally, some people believe that the vaccines are secretly being used for sterilization of Muslims. In 2015, the World Health Organization announced a deal with the Taliban to encourage them to distribute the vaccine in areas they control. However, on September 11, 2016, two unidentified gunmen associated with the Pakistani Taliban, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, shot Zakaullah Khan, a doctor who was administering polio vaccines in Pakistan. The leader of the Jamaat-ul-Ahrar claimed responsibility for the shooting and says that the group will continue to keep doing these kinds of attacks. This resistance to and skepticism of vaccinations has consequently slowed down the polio eradication process within the three remaining countries.|$|E
40|$|Since 1998 Municipal Public Health Services (MPHSs) in The Netherlands {{carried out}} Hepatitis A (HAV) <b>vaccination</b> <b>programs</b> for Turkish and Moroccan {{children}} to reduce import and secondary HAV infections. The {{aim of this}} study was to assess the effects of the programs on HAV incidence. MPHSs were questioned about HAV <b>vaccination</b> <b>programs</b> for migrant children. Notification data of HAV over the period 1995 - 2006 were analysed. Since 1998, 19 MPHSs (58 %) organized <b>vaccination</b> <b>programs</b> for Turkish and Moroccan children. A large variation in the range of activities in HAV <b>vaccination</b> <b>programs</b> was observed. In The Netherlands, HAV incidence declined, from 6. 5 per 100, 000 inhabitants in 1995 to 1. 3 in 2005. HAV incidence in children of Turkish and Moroccan decent declined from 70. 3 per 100, 000 in 2000 to 13. 5 per 100, 000 in 2005. Regions where MPHSs organized vaccination campaigns had the steepest decline in HAV incidence. The decline in HAV incidence in The Netherlands coincided with that observed for the rest of Europe. Therefore, also other causes than the enhanced <b>vaccination</b> <b>programs</b> could have contributed to this effect. At present, low priority is placed on continuing these HAV <b>vaccination</b> <b>programs,</b> as in areas without enhanced programs the incidence also declined to very low levels. Because HAV is still endemic in Morocco and Turkey, it remains important that all travellers to these countries are vaccinated against HAV, regardless of their country of origi...|$|R

All accredited abattoirs in Queensland were surveyed to ascertain the number that conducted Q fever <b>vaccination</b> <b>programs.</b> Only ten of the 30 abattoirs had <b>vaccination</b> pro-grams. <b>Vaccination</b> <b>programs</b> were present at all abattoirs with more than 360 employees. Thirty-seven per cent of abattoir employees worked at abattoirs {{that did not have}} <b>vaccination</b> <b>programs.</b> Research is required into the attitudes and barriers to vaccination at smaller abattoirs so that vaccination coverage can be increased. Economic data, including litigation costs, should be considered in a cost-effectiveness study so that smaller abattoirs appreciate the benefits of implementing <b>vaccination</b> <b>programs.</b> The protocols for vaccination of new employees should be analysed for their capacity to provide appropriate worker coverage.

40|$|Vaccination {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} interventions available for preventing serious diseases among infants, children, and adults. <b>Vaccination</b> <b>programs</b> have resulted in the elimination of smallpox worldwide and the virtual elimination of indigenous poliomyelitis in the Western Hemisphere. In the United States, vaccinepreventable diseases predominately affecting children have been greatly reduced since the introduction of <b>vaccination</b> <b>programs</b> (Table 1). <b>Vaccination</b> <b>programs</b> are also highly cost-effective. For example, the benefit-cost ratio for the U. S. measles-mumps-rubella immunization program has been estimated at approximately 14 : 1 (1).

40|$|Thesis (M.

25|$|Overall, {{there were}} 1098 cases of GBS {{recorded}} nationwide by CDC surveillance, 532 of which occurred after vaccination and 543 before vaccination.

25|$|Phylodynamic {{approaches}} {{can also}} be useful in ascertaining the effectiveness of viral control efforts, particularly for diseases with low reporting rates. For example, the genetic diversity of the DNA-based hepatitis B virus declined in the Netherlands in the late 1990s, following the initiation of a <b>vaccination</b> <b>program.</b> This correlation was used to argue that vaccination was effective at reducing the prevalence of infection, although alternative explanations are possible.|$|E
25|$|Finland is {{considered}} successful particularly {{in regards to}} specialized medical care and the coverage of its screening and vaccination programs.

25|$|If a <b>vaccination</b> <b>program</b> {{successfully}} {{reduces the}} disease threat, it {{may reduce the}} perceived risk of disease as cultural memories {{of the effects of}} that disease fade.
