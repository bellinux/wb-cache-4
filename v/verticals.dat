5|$|As English cathedrals {{are often}} {{surrounded}} by an expanse of green lawn, the plan is usually clearly visible at ground level, {{which is not the}} case with the many European cathedrals that are closely surrounded by town or monastic buildings. The general impression is that the English cathedral sprawls across its site with many projecting limbs. These horizontal projections are visibly balanced by the strong <b>verticals</b> of the massive towers, which may be one, two or three in number. Many of the cathedrals, particularly those like Winchester, St. Albans and Peterborough where the towers are not particularly high, give an impression of tremendous length and have been described as resembling “aircraft carriers”.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{architecture}} of English cathedrals is so diverse and inventive, the internal appearances differ a great deal. However, in general, English cathedral interiors tend to give an impression of length. This is in part {{because many of the}} buildings are actually very long, but also because more than in the medieval architecture of any other country, the horizontal direction is given as much visual emphasis as the vertical. This is particularly the case at Wells where, unlike most Gothic buildings, there are no vertical shafts that continue from the arcade to the vault and there is a very strong emphasis on the triforium gallery with its seemingly endless and undifferentiated row of narrow arches. Salisbury has a similar lack of <b>verticals</b> while the course below the triforium and the undecorated capitals of Purbeck stone create strong visual horizontals. In the cases of Winchester, Norwich and Exeter the horizontal effect is created by the emphasis on the ridge rib of the elaborate vaults.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION In {{an ideal}} {{electron}} storage ring, the horizontal and <b>vertical</b> motions are independent, {{resulting in an}} extremely small beam height. In practice, ring imperfections result in a coupling of horizontal and <b>vertical</b> transverse oscillations (betatron coupling) as well as <b>vertical</b> motion associated with energy oscillations (<b>vertical</b> dispersion). The coupling and <b>vertical</b> dispersion then determine the beam height. The <b>vertical</b> emittance (e y /b y) characterizes the excitation of <b>vertical</b> betatron motion. As a result of coupling, both transverse oscillation modes include <b>vertical</b> motion, and both modes are excited by photon emission in bending magnets. With non-zero <b>vertical</b> dispersion in bending magnets, photon emission excites <b>vertical</b> motion {{even in the absence}} of coupling.

25|$|Hand G, {{who may or}} may {{not have}} been Jan van Eyck, paralleled the {{achievement}} and innovation of that artist's panel paintings in the miniature form, firstly in the technical development of the tempera medium and use of glazes to achieve unprecedented detail and subtlety, and also in his illusionist realism, especially seen in interiors and landscapes – the John the Baptist page shows both well. Many of the background portions of the attributed leaves seem concerned with the depiction of receding space, and it is often thought that in this aspect that the work of Hand G is most innovative. However, from the earlier pages he seems to be grappling with the techniques for the first time. He was successful early on in showing space receding over reflective water or within interior spaces, but appears to have experienced more difficulty with landscape. Early attempts, for example Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane in which three imposing figures in the foreground are presented before a distant hillscape, see him, perhaps crudely, eliminating the mid-ground to create the illusion of distance. Yet the underdrawing show him already experimenting with more effective and innovative techniques he was later to master, such as lowering the line of the horizon, and using radiating <b>verticals</b> to increase the sense of depth.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe goal of {{the present}} study is to compare the {{strengths}} of depth effects induced by different types of <b>vertical</b> disparity. We use a nulling task, in which the depth effects induced by <b>vertical</b> disparity are nulled by horizontal disparity. The advantage of this method is that it prevents cue conflicts from arising between disparity and other depth cues. The ratios between horizontal and <b>vertical</b> disparity that evoke the percept of a fronto-parallel stimulus vary per type of <b>vertical</b> disparity. The ratios determined for <b>vertical</b> scale and <b>vertical</b> quadratic mix (<b>vertical</b> scale with a horizontal gradient) vary strongly across subjects. The ratios for <b>vertical</b> shear are constant, since all subjects needed the same amount of horizontal and <b>vertical</b> shear to perceive a fronto-parallel plane. In these experiments, one conflict cannot be avoided, namely the conflict between <b>vertical</b> disparity and oculomotor signals. This conflict may cause differential weighting of <b>vertical</b> disparity and oculomotor signals, which could explain the individual differences. The different ratios for different types of <b>vertical</b> disparity suggest that weighting is specific for each type of <b>vertical</b> disparity and the associated oculomotor signal...|$|R
