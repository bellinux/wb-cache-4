40|$|Formation flying of {{multiple}} vehicles requires accurate {{information on the}} relative position and attitude between the <b>vehicles.</b> <b>Carrier</b> Phase Differential GPS (CDGPS) can provide the necessary accuracy in position and attitude sensing to successfully carry out such missions. In missions with little to no visibility to the NAVSTAR constellation, CDGPS can still be used by augmenting the available signals with onboard transmitters broadcasting the L_ 1 carrier signal modulated by a unique C/A code. The feasibility of this augmented GPS system is demonstrated with a two-vehicle formation in an indoor environment...|$|E
