2500|$|There {{are several}} types of pump mechanisms. Piston pumps draw a piston through a {{cylinder}} to create suction. These are generally considered top-of-the-line units. They have characteristics of low speed, high reliability, low noise, and long life. [...] Rotary <b>vane</b> <b>pumps</b> use a cam with retractable vanes to create suction. These rotary <b>vane</b> <b>pumps</b> are not widely used anymore. Fast diaphragm pumps use a diaphragm that is acted on by a lever, with thousands of cycles per minute.

[...] Pumps have also been designed that use venturi effects powered by a faucet or water stream, wall suction in hospitals, or pumps powered by oral suctioning.|$|E
50|$|In a {{hydraulic}} installation, one pump can serve several cylinders and motors. However, {{in that case}} a constant pressure system is required and the system always needs full power. It is more economic to give each cylinder and motor its own pump. In that case, multi-pump assemblies can be used. Gear pumps are often supplied as multi-pumps. The different chambers (sometimes of different sizes) are mounted in one body or built together. <b>Vane</b> <b>pumps</b> and gerotor pumps too are often available as multi-pumps. Screw pumps can be combined with gear or <b>vane</b> <b>pumps.</b> Axial piston swashplate pumps can be combined with a second pump, or {{with one or more}} gear pumps or <b>vane</b> <b>pumps</b> (the gear or <b>vane</b> <b>pumps</b> often serving as flush pumps for cooling larger units). Axial plunger pumps of the bent-axis design cannot be combined with other pumps.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vane</b> <b>pumps</b> are {{commonly}} used as high-pressure hydraulic pumps and in automobiles, including supercharging, power-steering and automatic-transmission pumps.

40|$|A {{platform}} for sliding <b>vane</b> <b>pump</b> and centrifugal pump tests is installed {{to study the}} series operation of them under different characteristics of pipeline. Firstly, the sliding <b>vane</b> <b>pump</b> and the centrifugal pump work independently, and the performance is recorded. Then, {{the two types of}} pumps are combined together, with the sliding <b>vane</b> <b>pump</b> acting as the feeding pump. Comparison is made between the performance of the independently working pump and the performance of series operation pump. Results show that the system flow rate is determined by the sliding <b>vane</b> <b>pump.</b> In order to ensure the stability of the series operation pumping system, the energy consumption required by the pipeline under the system flow should be greater than the pressure energy centrifugal pump can generate. Otherwise, the centrifugal pump can not operate stably, with reflux, swirl, gas-liquid two-phase flow in the runner and strong vibration and noise. The sliding <b>vane</b> <b>pump</b> can be in serial operation with the centrifugal pump under limited conditions...|$|R

5000|$|Rotary <b>vane</b> <b>pumps</b> (fixed {{and simple}} {{adjustable}} displacement) have higher efficiencies than gear pumps, {{but are also}} used for mid pressures up to [...] in general. Modern units can exceed [...] in continuous operation, although <b>vane</b> <b>pumps</b> are not regarded as [...] "high pressure" [...] components. Some types of <b>vane</b> <b>pumps</b> can change {{the centre of the}} vane body, so that a simple adjustable pump is obtained. These adjustable <b>vane</b> <b>pumps</b> are in general constant pressure or constant power pumps: the displacement is increased until the required pressure or power is reached and subsequently the displacement or swept volume is decreased until an equilibrium is reached. A critical element in vane pump design is how the vanes are pushed into contact with the pump housing, and how the vane tips are machined at this very point. Several type of [...] "lip" [...] designs are used, and the main objective is to provide a tight seal between the inside of the housing and the vane, {{and at the same time}} to minimize wear and metal-to-metal contact. Forcing the vane out of the rotating centre and towards the pump housing is accomplished using spring-loaded vanes, or more traditionally, vanes loaded hydrodynamically (via the pressurized system fluid).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paperdescribes the {{theoretical}} analysis on themechanical efficiencyof ahydraulic-balanced <b>vane</b> <b>pump</b> and presents a design concept to decide {{values such as}} vane thickness and cam lift to improve its mechanical efficiency. In this paper, the friction torque characteristics of the balanced <b>vane</b> <b>pump,</b> especially the friction torque caused by the friction between a camcon-tour and vane tips are both experimentally and theoretically investigated. Although the friction force increaseswith vane thickness increasedue to increase in the vane force, themechanical effi-ciency of the vane pumpdoes not decreasewhen the cam lift becomes large as the vane thickness is increased. An important parameter 1 defined as the ratio to be obtained by dividing the cam lift by the vane thickness determines essentially the mechanical efficiency of the <b>vane</b> <b>pump.</b> The pumps with the same 1 have the same mechanical efficiencies, even if the cam lift or the vane thickness varies. A larger value of 1 leads the <b>vane</b> <b>pump</b> to obtain a higher mechanical efficiency although the limit of vane strength governs the upper limit for 1. Additionally, reducing the friction coefficient of the vane tip contributes to improvement of the mechanical efficiency...|$|R

50|$|The most {{prevalent}} outgassing product in vacuum systems is water absorbed by chamber materials. It {{can be reduced}} by desiccating or baking the chamber, and removing absorbent materials. Outgassed water can condense in the oil of rotary <b>vane</b> <b>pumps</b> and reduce their net speed drastically if gas ballasting is not used. High vacuum systems must be clean and free of organic matter to minimize outgassing.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the major}} {{advantages}} of the <b>vane</b> <b>pump</b> is that the design readily lends itself to become a variable-displacement pump, rather than a fixed-displacement pump such as a spur-gear (X-X) or a gerotor (I-X) pump. The centerline distance from the rotor to the eccentric ring is {{used to determine the}} pump's displacement. By allowing the eccentric ring to pivot or translate relative to the rotor, the displacement can be varied. It is even possible for a <b>vane</b> <b>pump</b> to pump in reverse if the eccentric ring moves far enough. However, performance cannot be optimized to pump in both directions. This can make for a very interesting hydraulic-control oil pump.|$|R

50|$|The Quasiturbine or Qurbine {{engine is}} a {{proposed}} pistonless rotary engine using a rhomboidal rotor whose sides are hinged at the vertices. The volume enclosed between {{the sides of}} the rotor and the rotor casing provide compression and expansion in a fashion similar to the more familiar Wankel engine, but the hinging at the edges allows the volume ratio to increase. Unlike <b>vane</b> <b>pumps,</b> in which vane extension is generally important and against which the pressure acts to generate the rotation, the Quasiturbine contour seals have a minimal extension and the rotation does not result from pressure against these seals.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{problems}} with the historical design. The vane tips radially contact the cam ring elliptic surface and cause a significant friction as the rotor and vanes turn. This friction is both pressure dependent and speed squared dependent due to RPM-squared centripetal forces. The speed is limited to about 6-7,000 RPM and the pressure is limited to about 2,500 PSI. Another pressure-related {{problem is that the}} pressure forces into the axial rotor to stationary kidney endplate clearance and buckles the device ends thus increasing fluid blowby referred to as 'volumetric efficiency'. Typically, <b>vane</b> <b>pumps</b> and motors have two external ports but there are actually two separate sets of chambers which form two separate pumps and motors. The internal plumbing is y-connected to create only two external ports.|$|E
40|$|Abstract.

50|$|In {{the food}} sector, moving or {{transporting}} fluids is achieved {{with the aid}} of pump technology. Colloquially, this is known as filling or portioning.

The products are transported {{with the aid of}} a hopper with a feeding device, a vane cell feed system under a vacuum and appropriate volume expulsion in the pump housing.
