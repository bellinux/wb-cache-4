40|$|Air {{brake system}} has been widely used in heavy trucks and {{intercity}} buses for its great superiority over other brake system. The practical performance of air brake system may be greatly different from if we analyze it with static theory. Thus, {{it is necessary to}} build an integrate air brake system model to simulate the process of brake accurately. However, the dynamic mathematic model of air brake system is very complicate, which makes the model hard to be solved. In this paper, the components of air brake system are decomposed to several basic standard pneumatic components, and then build the system based on these basic standard pneumatic components. The standard pneumatic components which are built in the software-MWorks based on Modelica language include cylinder, nozzle, air reservoir, volume, and air pipe. An air brake system which contains brake <b>valve,</b> <b>relay</b> valve, brake chambers and pipelines is made based on the standard pneumatic components. The simulation results show the dynamic characteristics of air brake system...|$|E
50|$|With {{a service}} brake <b>relay</b> <b>valve</b> installed, the hose that {{connects to the}} primary delivery-port output of the foot-valve becomes a control-line (i.e., The air from the foot-valve “dead ends” at the <b>relay</b> <b>valve's</b> control-port.). Only low-volume air-signals are {{required}} to travel {{back and forth between}} the foot-valve's delivery port and the <b>relay</b> <b>valve's</b> control port; therefore, the air-volume supplied by the delivery port is now only a tiny-fraction of what otherwise would have been required had the <b>relay</b> <b>valve</b> not been installed. This reduces the delay between the application of the front and rear brakes to only a fraction of a second. When the driver depresses the brake pedal, a small amount of air momentarily opens the <b>relay</b> <b>valve's</b> supply port, which then directs air from the remote air-supply directly to the rear service brake chambers, and quickly applies the rear service brakes. The pressure delivered to the service brake chambers in this manner will equal the control-pressure delivered by the foot-valve to the <b>relay</b> <b>valve.</b> When the driver partially or fully releases the brake pedal, the control-pressure delivered by the foot-valve decreases; this causes the <b>relay</b> <b>valve's</b> supply port to close, and its exhaust port to momentarily open, thus preventing a pneumatic short-circuit from occurring while the air exhausts from all rear service brake chambers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Relay</b> <b>valves</b> {{are tested}} for {{durability}} before use through a seat test with air. In pressure at 80 psig or more, a 2-inch or smaller <b>relay</b> <b>valve</b> should not be tested for less than 15 seconds under pressure or for less than 30 seconds if it is at 3 inches in size.|$|R
50|$|Without <b>relay</b> <b>valves,</b> {{it would}} take too long for {{sufficient}} air to travel from the brake pedal valve {{to the rear of}} the truck or trailer in order to apply the rear service brakes concurrently with the front service brakes, resulting in a condition known as brake lag. To correct this condition on a long-wheel-base vehicle, a <b>relay</b> <b>valve</b> is installed near the rear service brake chambers. In tractors as well as straight-trucks, a remote air-supply is provided in the form of a large diameter pipe connected between the primary reservoir and the <b>relay</b> <b>valve</b> for remote service brake application.|$|R

40|$|Statistics {{indicate}} that defects in brake system {{contribute significantly to}} fatal crashes involving commercial vehicles. Hence {{there is a need}} for developing preventive and active safety measures for assessing the performance of an air brake system in trucks. Existing techniques for assessing the performance of brakes are infrastructure intensive, time and labor intensive. The premise of this thesis is that model-based diagnostic techniques can be employed to overcome these limitations of existing tech- niques. The design of a model-based diagnostic system requires the development and experimental corroboration of a mathematical model of the evolution of pressure in each brake chamber of a truck in response to the application of brake pedal input by the driver, when there are no faults or defects in the brake system. This thesis is aimed at modeling and experimentally corroborating a subsystem of an air brake system, namely the pneumatic <b>relay</b> <b>valve.</b> The pneumatic <b>relay</b> <b>valve</b> takes a input signal from the primary delivery of a treadle valve and meters air from a storage reservoir to Type 30 rear brake chambers.

50|$|A {{spring brake}} <b>relay</b> <b>valve</b> {{works on the}} same {{principle}} as the service brake <b>relay</b> <b>valve,</b> although it has the opposite effect. This type of <b>relay</b> <b>valve</b> responds to a major drop in pressure at its control-port by opening its exhaust port, which causes the air from each spring brake chamber under its control to remotely exhaust, thus applying the spring brakes much-more-quickly than would otherwise be possible if the air were required to discharge via the yellow parking-control valve on the dashboard. In a dual-circuit air brake system, air from both the primary and secondary reservoirs is fed into the supply-port of the parking-control valve, {{as well as the}} supply-port of this relay valve; it is merged via yet another two-way check valve. The delivery-port output of the parking-control valve connects to the control-port of this relay valve; this enables the spring brakes to be controlled via this valve. The merged air from the parking-control valve prevents air-loss from only one braking circuit from causing the spring brakes to automatically apply. This gives the driver more control, and prevents the vehicle from grinding to a halt in an unsafe location. However, with this increased control, comes increased responsibility {{on the part of the}} driver: If air is lost from the primary circuit alone, the spring brakes must be manually applied by the driver via the parking-control valve; otherwise, the front service brakes may not be enough to stop the vehicle safely in an emergency—especially if the vehicle is heavily loaded, and/or traveling at a high-speed. In fact, the driver's failure to manually apply the spring brakes in this situation could lead to catastrophic failure of the front brakes due to overheating, since it could cause the front service brakes to exceed their design-limit for energy absorption.QR1C air valve speeds up the process, with anti compounding, meaning trailer and service brakes will function 1 second between each other.The <b>relay</b> <b>valve's</b> function is analogous to the transistor used in electronic circuits.|$|R

25|$|An early {{development}} of sequential control was relay logic, by which electrical relays engage electrical contacts which either start or interrupt {{power to a}} device.

These were more flexible in their response than the rigid single-sequence cam timers. More complicated examples involved maintaining safe sequences for devices such as swing bridge controls, where a lock bolt needed to be disengaged before the bridge could be moved, and the lock bolt could not be released until the safety gates had already been closed.|$|R
50|$|The {{control system}} is further {{divided into two}} service brake {{circuits}}, the parking brake circuit, and the trailer brake circuit. The dual service brake circuits are further split into front and rear wheel circuits which receive compressed air from their individual reservoirs for added safety {{in case of an}} air leak. The service brakes are applied by means of a brake pedal air valve which regulates both circuits. The parking brake is the air operated spring brake type where its applied by spring force in the spring brake cylinder and released by compressed air via hand control valve. The trailer brake consists of a direct two line system: the supply line (marked red) and the separate control or service line (marked blue). The supply line receives air from the prime mover park brake air tank via a park brake <b>relay</b> <b>valve</b> and the control line is regulated via the trailer brake <b>relay</b> <b>valve.</b> The operating signals for the relay are provided by the prime mover brake pedal air valve, trailer service brake hand control (subject to local heavy vehicle legislation) and the prime mover park brake hand control.|$|R

40|$|Abstract In {{this thesis}} {{pre-stressed}} piezoelectric actuators for micro and fine mechanical applications have been developed. First, RAINBOW (Reduced And INternally Biased Oxide Wafer) and thick film actuators were manufactured and their electromechanical properties were characterised. In the second part, the novel pre-stressed piezoelectric actuator PRESTO (PRE-STressed electrOactive component {{by using a}} post-fired biasing layer) was developed and its electrical and electromechanical properties were measured. Commercial piezoelectric PZT 5 A and PZT 5 H discs {{were used in the}} RAINBOW and PRESTO actuators and PLZT paste for thick film actuators. The pre-stressing of the PRESTO actuators was based on the sintering shrinkage and different thermal expansion coefficient of the piezoelectric disc and passive material. Dielectric LTCC tape and AgPd paste were utilized as pre-stressing media and passive layer by using lamination and screen-printing, respectively. Different active and passive layer thicknesses and electrode materials were realized in order to obtain high displacements and good load bearing capability for actuators. The PRESTO actuators showed a significantly higher coercive electric field than their bulk counterparts, but a decreased remanent polarisation. The displacement as a function of load was measured under 0. 3 – 3  N loads and electric fields up to ± 0. 75 MV/m. The highest displacement of 118  μm was obtained with a 250  μm thick PZT 5 H actuator (Ø  25 mm) with LTCC tape (thickness ~ 96  μm) as the pre-stressing material. The corresponding actuator with AgPd pre-stressing material (thickness ~ 33  μm) produced 63  μm displacement. Additionally, PRESTO actuators were tested with a glued steel layer in a mechanical amplifier which obtained displacements up to 1. 2  mm. Effective d 31 coefficients of the PRESTO actuators were derived using an analysis based on unimorph model and measured displacement data. The actuators exhibited significantly enhanced effective d 31 coefficients (d 31 eff = - 690 pm/V and d 31 eff = - 994 pm/V for PZT 5 A and 5 H, respectively) comparable to the RAINBOW actuators. Mass-producible PRESTO actuators with high displacement, moderate load bearing capabilities and integration possibilities can be utilised in various micro and fine mechanical devices e. g. dosing devices, electromechanical locks, regulators, positioners vibrators, speakers, adjusters, pumps, <b>valves,</b> <b>relays,</b> dispensers, micromanipulators, etc...|$|R

RTL gates were used in early integrated circuits. For higher speed and better density, the resistors used in RTL were replaced by diodes resulting in diode-transistor logic (DTL). Transistor-transistor logic (TTL) then supplanted DTL. As integrated circuits became more complex, bipolar transistors were replaced with smaller field-effect transistors (MOSFETs); see PMOS and NMOS. To reduce power consumption still further, most contemporary chip implementations of digital systems now use CMOS logic.

50|$|Maintenance is {{an ongoing}} concern for the barometer, {{with one of the}} major issues being water vapour, which {{constantly}} enters the pump and could easily emulsify with the pump oil. Special provisions are made to prevent this. Since water vapour is extracted continuously, the water level in the reservoir needs to be topped up every day. In addition, the abundance of sunshine in the barometer's environment, combined with the presence of algae in the rainwater that is employed, leads to a risk of algae growing within the water pipe. To address this, the owners have employed chlorine to kill the algae, but the evaporation of the chlorine had to be specifically catered for. Wear and tear also places considerable strain on the vacuum system's vulnerable pump, its 11 solenoid <b>valves</b> and its <b>relays.</b> Finally, the barometer needs to be exclusively filled with pure rainwater, as tap water contains many minerals which may be detrimental to the barometer.|$|R
5000|$|Flowers {{proposed}} {{a more sophisticated}} alternative, using electronic system, which his staff called Colossus, using perhaps 1,800 thermionic valves (vacuum tubes) instead of 150, and having only one paper tape instead of two (which required synchronisation) by generating the wheel patterns electronically. Because the most complicated previous electronic device had used about 150 valves, some were sceptical that the system would be reliable. Flowers countered that the British telephone system used thousands of valves and was reliable because the electronics were operated in a stable environment with the circuitry on all the time. The Bletchley Park management were not convinced, however, and merely encouraged Flowers to proceed on his own. He did so at the Post Office Research Labs, using {{some of his own}} funds to build it. [...] Flowers had first met (and got on with) Turing in 1939, but was treated with disdain by Gordon Welchman, because of his advocacy of <b>valves</b> rather than <b>relays.</b> Welchman preferred the views of Wynn-Williams and Keene of BTM (who had designed and constructed the Bombe), and wanted Radley and “Mr Flowers of Dollis Hill” removed from work on Colossus for “squandering good valves”.|$|R
40|$|Inspection is an {{important}} element in the maintenance and reliable operation of many stochastically failing items/equipment, for which the state of failure can be discovered only through some form of action. Protective systems used in hazardous plants like chemical plants, nuclear plants, etc, are the prime examples, where the instruments therein need to be periodically inspected to discover their hidden failures. There are however many other systems where also inspection is necessary; for example, weapon systems, machinery needed to produce goods within specific tolerance limits (calibration), etc. In a typical protective system, say for a chemical plant, there are basically three types of instruments: initiators (e. g. various types of sensors), actuators (trip valves, used either singly or in combination with solenoid <b>valves),</b> and a <b>relay</b> to transmit signals from initiators to actuators.

30|$|Considering the {{hazardous}} nature of high-speed train operation, {{the assessment of}} vehicle reliability is essential to guarantee its safe operation. It is therefore necessary to assess the reliability of key components in high-speed trains, which represent issues that have been widely and thoroughly studied. Meng et al. [22] researched a reliability evaluation method using Markov model to describe the trend of the system reliability, and assessed the reliability of high-speed train traction transmission system. However, the system reliability needs research component reliability, which is statistical inference under small sample problem. Wang et al. [23] employed the least squares method to analyze {{the reliability of the}} key components of trains based on the Weibull distribution. The results of the study indicated that the sample size had a significant effect on the estimation precision. Wu et al. [24] assessed the reliability of <b>relay</b> <b>valves</b> based on the characteristic that the failure rate gradually increases according to an assumed Weibull distribution. Wang et al. [25] performed a durable test to evaluate the reliability of a brake unit for urban rail vehicles. The methods discussed above for the reliability assessment of high-speed trains can achieve satisfactory results under large sample size. Tian [26] employed a virtual expansion method to expand data sample size from n[*]=[*] 2 – 3 to n[*]=[*] 12, and then employed the method to analyze the reliability of the center sill and body bolster of a C 70 gondola car based on a Bayesian method. The authors assumed that the lifetimes of parts followed normal distributions, and the approach was demonstrated to improve the assessment precision. Zhu et al. [27] extended the Bayesian method to the Weibull distribution, and verified the robustness of the model by assessing the reliability of bearings in a high-speed train. Subjective selection was employed to define the prior distribution and its hyperparameters, and these estimators were solved using an analytical method. Dong [28] assessed the reliability of braking systems in urban railway vehicles using a goal-oriented (GO) methodology and Bayesian theory based on the assumption of an exponential distribution. The method was demonstrated to be suitable for analyzing conditions where a component follows the rule that the failure rate is constant. Akama [29] calculated the crack propagation rate of cracks in a Shinkansen vehicle axle using Bayesian analysis by combining crack propagation rates derived from small specimens with crack propagation rates derived from full-scale models. The results showed that the method can narrow the variance of the fatigue life distribution, and provide more confident failure probability values.|$|R
40|$|Among {{many other}} {{potential}} applications, intermittent solid slug feeders {{can be used}} to effectively inject biomass materials into fluidized bed reactors for pyrolysis. In particular, these feeders {{can be used to}} convey biomass materials that are highly cohesive to prevent plugging or undesirable reaction in the feeding tube. Although feeders of this design have been shown to work very effectively, they have not been studied in detail or optimized for the pyrolysis process. In addition, the operating conditions required to obtain predictable and consistent mass flow rates and slugs of desirable characteristics need to be established. The purpose of this work was to design, build and demonstrate the operation of a horizontal intermittent solid slug feeder and to test it with sawdust as the feed material. Sawdust is an extremely cohesive and difficult biomass to inject, but one that holds great potential as an important renewable feedstock for pyrolysis. The intermittent feeder designed for this work consisted of a pressurized vertical solids storage silo leading to a pneumatic pinch valve. The pinch valve, controlled by solenoid valves connected to a relay timer, released the feed into a horizontal feeding tube at a ninety degree angle. Within the silo, a rotating mixer prevented the bridging of solids. Intermittent pulses of gas from a control volume were fed into the horizontal feeding tube, as well as, in some cases, a continuous gas flow. The timing of the pulses was controlled by solenoid <b>valves</b> with a <b>relay</b> timer. While the pinch valve is opened, solids fall into the horizontal feeding tube forming a plug, which is then propelled by the pulsating gas into the reactor. The solid mass flow rate was experimentally measured by collecting the solids and continuously measuring the mass using a digital balance. Several variables were tested in order to optimize the performance of the feeder and the consistency of the feeding rate. They included the silo pressure, mixing rate, gas pulse pressure and volume, continuous gas mass flow rate, and the open pinch-valve time interval. The goals of this optimization were (a) to maximize the solid-to-gas ratio of mass flow rates, since the gas mass flux must be minimized to avoid wasting energy, and (b) to define operating conditions required to inject consistent biomass mass flow rates suitable for a laboratory scale pyrolysis reactor, and (c) to propose initial design criteria and a calibration procedure for intermittent solid slug feeders. The results demonstrated that the intermittent solid slug feeder system successfully achieved the desired objectives and showed how to efficiently select its optimum operating conditions...|$|R
