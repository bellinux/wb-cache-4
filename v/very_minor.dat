5|$|August 4, 1988- Tropical Storm Beryl {{forms to}} the south of Mississippi and moves slowly for several days over coastal areas of Louisiana. The outer bands of the storm drop over 7inches (175mm) of rain along the Florida Panhandle, {{resulting}} in <b>very</b> <b>minor</b> damage.|$|E
5|$|In {{research}} studies, {{the outcome}} from {{an episode of}} Guillain–Barré syndrome is recorded {{on a scale from}} 0 to 6, where 0 denotes completely healthy, 1 <b>very</b> <b>minor</b> symptoms but able to run, 2 able to walk but not to run, 3 requiring a stick or other support, 4 confined to bed or chair, 5 requiring long-term respiratory support, 6 death.|$|E

5|$|In northeastern Honduras, low-lying {{areas were}} {{evacuated}} and numerous homes were destroyed. Rainfall peaked at 7.9in (200mm), resulting in widespread flooding. Waves up to 7ft (2.1m) affected the coastline. An American tourist drowned off Cozumel after succumbing to rough seas. Only <b>very</b> <b>minor</b> impacts were observed along the northeastern coastline of the Yucatán Peninsula. The outer bands of Paula affected Cuba, where rainfall peaked at 7.32in (186mm) and winds reached 68mph (109km/h). The strong winds downed many trees, blocking roadways, and damaged {{the roofs of}} several homes. The rain, however, was regarded as generally beneficial to crops and low reservoirs. Rough seas removed concrete from Havana's sea wall and submerged coastal streets under 1–2ft (0.3–0.61m) of water.|$|E
5|$|Key held a {{character}} popularity poll between December 15–31, 2011 for every character from the game, even <b>very</b> <b>minor</b> ones. The top three winners would each get a downloadable wallpaper, and first place would get original artwork for the wallpaper. A voter could vote one time {{for up to}} three characters per day. While Sizuru led at first, Akane surged ahead near the end. The top three winners were Akane with 18,042 votes, Sizuru with 16,839 votes, and Lucia with 15,047 votes.|$|E
5|$|Phoenix is {{the radiant}} of two annual meteor showers. The Phoenicids, {{also known as}} the December Phoenicids, were first {{observed}} on 3 December 1887. The shower was particularly intense in December 1956, and is thought related to the breakup of the short-period comet 289P/Blanpain. It peaks around 4–5 December, though is not seen every year. A <b>very</b> <b>minor</b> meteor shower peaks around July 14 with around one meteor an hour, though meteors can be seen anytime from July 3 to 18; this shower {{is referred to as the}} July Phoenicids.|$|E

5|$|Ten {{returning}} {{characters from}} previous Crash titles star in Crash Bandicoot: The Wrath of Cortex along with five new characters. The protagonist of the game, Crash Bandicoot, is a genetically enhanced eastern barred bandicoot who must defeat the antagonist Doctor Neo Cortex {{and his new}} superweapon. Coco Bandicoot, Crash's younger sister, is a highly intelligent computer expert {{with an interest in}} Hong Kong martial arts films. Aku Aku is an omnipotent witch doctor who guides and aids Crash and Coco in stopping the plans of Doctor Neo Cortex. Pura, Coco's pet tiger cub, serves a <b>very</b> <b>minor</b> role and appears only in the introduction of the game.|$|E
5|$|It is a hairy {{biennial}} {{plant that}} can grow to 2 m tall or more. Its small, yellow flowers are densely grouped on a tall stem, which grows {{from a large}} rosette of leaves. It grows {{in a wide variety}} of habitats, but prefers well-lit, disturbed soils, where it can appear soon after the ground receives light, from long-lived seeds that persist in the soil seed bank. It is a common weedy plant that spreads by prolifically producing seeds, but it rarely becomes aggressively invasive, since its seeds require open ground to germinate. It is a <b>very</b> <b>minor</b> problem for most agricultural crops, since it is not a very competitive species, being intolerant of shade from other plants and unable to survive tilling. It also hosts many insects, some of which can be harmful to other plants. Although individuals are easy to remove by hand, populations are difficult to eliminate permanently.|$|E
5|$|Of the {{fin whale}} stomachs sampled off British Columbia between 1963 and 1967, euphausiids {{dominated}} the diet for {{four of the}} five years (82.3 to 100% of the diet), while copepods only formed a major portion of the diet in 1965 (35.7%). Miscellaneous fish, squid, and octopus played only a <b>very</b> <b>minor</b> part of the diet in two of the five years (3.6 to 4.8%). Fin whales caught off California between 1959 and 1970 fed on the pelagic euphausiid Euphausia pacifica (86% of sampled individuals), the more neritic euphausiid Thysanoessa spinifera (9%), and the northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax) (7%); only trace amounts (<0.5% each) were found of Pacific saury (C. saira) and juvenile rockfish (Sebastes jordani). In the Gulf of California, they have been observed feeding on swarms of the euphausiid Nyctiphanes simplex.|$|E

25|$|A Bedfordshire team {{competed in}} the <b>very</b> first <b>Minor</b> Counties Championship in 1895, with six other teams: it {{finished}} fourth. The county then missed the next four seasons before the present club rejoined the competition in 1900. It has not missed any seasons since.|$|R
5|$|As with {{previous}} Valkyira Chronicles games, Valkyria Chronicles III is a tactical role-playing game where players {{take control of}} a military unit and take part in missions against enemy forces. Stories are told through comic book-like panels with animated character portraits, with characters speaking partially through voiced speech bubbles and partially through unvoiced text. The player progresses {{through a series of}} linear missions, gradually unlocked as maps that can be freely scanned through and replayed as they are unlocked. The route to each story location on the map varies depending on an individual player's approach: when one option is selected, the other is sealed off to the player. Outside missions, the player characters rest in a camp, where units can be customized and character growth occurs. Alongside the main story missions are character-specific sub missions relating to different squad members. After the game's completion, additional episodes are unlocked, some of them having a higher difficulty than those found {{in the rest of the}} game. There are also love simulation elements related to the game's two main heroines, although they take a <b>very</b> <b>minor</b> role.|$|E
5|$|The {{localization}} {{proved more}} challenging than other Atlus projects for multiple reasons. As the characters' text bubbles {{were designed to}} use Japanese kanji characters—which compress {{a lot of information}} into a single symbol in a way impossible in the English alphabet—each text bubble had to be individually resized and sometimes shifted so they would not intrude on other elements within scenes. The sheer amount of voice acting in the game meant that dubbing took far longer than other similar projects, running past its projected time and requiring Atlus staff members to voice <b>very</b> <b>minor</b> characters to save time. The main characters were a major focus due to the storytelling style of multiple interlinked narratives, with each character's personal growth needing to be reflected in their voice performance. This was particularly true of Mercedes. The auto-scrolling nature of dialogue, which moved along at a set pace rather than through the player's button prompts, meant that performances needed to be correctly timed and balanced to the varying paces at which the actors read their lines. This led to lines being modified during recording to keep within schedule. During the last stages, the team needed to rerecord some lines of dialogue, but to keep the localization in budget and on schedule it was done outside a professional recording studio, resulting in an audible drop in quality.|$|E
5|$|Many of the {{characters}} from the graphic novel underwent significant changes for the film. V is characterized in the film as a romantic freedom fighter who shows concern {{over the loss of}} innocent life. However, in the graphic novel, he is portrayed as ruthless, willing to kill anyone who gets in his way. Evey Hammond's transformation as V's protégée is also much more drastic in the novel than in the film. At the beginning of the film, she is already a confident woman with a hint of rebellion in her; in the graphic novel, she starts off as an insecure, desperate young woman forced into prostitution. V and Evey's relationship, though not as obvious in the book, ends in the film with pledges of love. In the graphic novel's finale, she not only carries out V's plans as she does in the film, but also clearly takes on V's identity. In the film, Inspector Finch sympathizes with V, but, in the graphic novel, he is determined to stop V and goes as far as taking LSD to enter into a criminal's state of mind. Gordon, a <b>very</b> <b>minor</b> character in both adaptations, is also drastically changed. In the novel, Gordon is a small-time criminal who takes Evey into his home after V abandons her on the street. The two share a brief romance before Gordon is killed by a Scottish gang. In the film, however, Gordon is a well-mannered colleague of Evey's, and is later revealed to be gay. He is arrested by fingermen for broadcasting a political parody on his TV program, and is later executed when a Quran is found in his possession.|$|E

50|$|In the 1960s Vulkāns did {{not perform}} well in the league, however in 1964 when the club was managed by its former player Heinrihs Freimanis the club won the Latvian Cup, one of the <b>very</b> few <b>minor</b> Latvian city clubs to ever achieve the feat. In 1968, Vulkāns was relegated from the top league.|$|R
