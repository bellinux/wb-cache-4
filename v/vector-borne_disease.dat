25|$|Interactions between red {{imported}} {{fire ants}} and mammals have been rarely documented. However, deaths of live-trapped animals by red imported fire ants have been observed. Mortality rates in eastern cottontail (Sylvilagus floridanus) young range from 33 to 75% because of red imported fire ants. It {{is believed that}} red imported fire ants have a strong impact on many herpetofauna species; scientists have noted population declines in the Florida kingsnake (Lampropeltis getula floridana), and eggs and adults of the eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulatus) and six-lined racerunner (Aspidoscelis sexlineata) {{are a source of}} food. Because of this, eastern fence lizards have adapted to have longer legs and new behaviours to escape the red imported fire ant. Adult three-toed box turtles (Terrapene carolina triunguis), Houston toad (Anaxyrus houstonensis) juveniles, and American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) hatchlings are also attacked and killed by these ants. Despite this mostly-negative association, one study shows that red imported fire ants may be capable of impacting <b>vector-borne</b> <b>disease</b> transmissions by regulating tick populations and altering vector and host dynamics, thereby reducing transmission rates not only to animals, but to humans as well.|$|E
2500|$|Living {{in a rural}} community, {{whether in}} the United States, or around the globe, reduces access to medical services, health insurance, and changes health culture. Differentials exist between rural and urban communities, and some health {{disadvantages}} exist for impoverished rural residents. Since health of a population increases in geographical locations that have a higher prevalence of primary care physicians, rural areas face worse health. According to certain studies, measures of health and well-being indicate that rural populations have worse health outcomes. Rural residents have a greater rate of premature mortality (less than age 75 at death) than urban residents. According to certain studies in the United States, the death rate of individuals age 1–24 years was 31% higher than those in urban counties. The death rate of adults 25 to 64 years old was 32% higher among rural residents than those of suburban counties and of urban counties. These higher death rates were contributed to unintentional injuries, suicide, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In 1997 in the United States, 18% of adults in rural areas had chronic health conditions, compared to only 13% of suburban adults. The National Health Interview Survey indicated that in 1998, 16% of rural adults reported poor health. Poor rural residents have only 21% Medicaid coverage, while poor urban populations report 30% coverage. Demographic and socioeconomic factors vary between rural and urban areas, which contributes to some health disparities. For extremely poor rural communities, variables in the community, like ecological setting, including climate, soil, rainfall, temperature, altitude, and seasonality greatly impact health.

Past and current efforts at controlling most <b>vector-borne</b> <b>diseases</b> have relied solely on disease management [4]. As neither effective medication nor vaccines are available for some of these diseases, vector control remains pivotal.

40|$|This toolkit for {{integrated}} vector management (IVM) {{is designed}} to help national and regional programme managers coordinate across sectors to design and run large IVM programmes. It is an extension of earlier guidance and teaching material published by the World Health Organization (WHO) : Handbook for integrated vector management (1), Monitoring and evaluation indicators for integrated vector management (2), Guidance on policy-making for integrated vector management (3) and Core structure for training curricula on integrated vector management (4). The toolkit provides the technical detail required to plan, implement, monitor and evaluate an IVM approach. IVM can be used when the aim is to control or eliminate <b>vector-borne</b> <b>diseases</b> and can also contribute to insecticide resistance management. This toolkit provides information on where <b>vector-borne</b> <b>diseases</b> are endemic and what interventions should be used, presenting case studies on IVM as well as relevant guidance documents for reference. The diseases that are the focus of this toolkit are malaria, lymphatic filariasis, dengue, leishmaniasis, onchocerciasis, human African trypanosomiasis and schistosomiasis. It also includes information on other viral diseases (Rift Valley fever, West Nile fever, Chikungunya, yellow fever) and trachoma.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the degree of Masters of Arts in Governance and Development, 2014. Cataloged from PDF version of thesis. Includes bibliographical references (page 45 - 56). Background Climate change is an occurring phenomenon that creates extreme weather patterns and these weather patterns have {{a direct impact on}} <b>vector-borne</b> <b>diseases.</b> The relationship between climatic factors and <b>vector-borne</b> <b>diseases</b> is very important to determine parasite activity levels and disease risk. Therefore, the present study was conducted to explore the effect of climatic change on the transmission of <b>vector-borne</b> <b>diseases</b> in Bangladesh. Methods Thirty years climatic data (temperature, rainfall, and humidity) were collected from the meteorological department of Bangladesh. Morbidity and mortality data of different <b>vector-borne</b> <b>diseases</b> were collected from the office of Director General of Health (DG Health) of Bangladesh. Data were analyzed using SPSS to find out the association between climatic variables and <b>vector-borne</b> <b>diseases.</b> Results From linear regression analysis we found an upward trend of both in mean (r 2 = 0. 402), maximum (r 2 = 0. 225) and minimum (r 2 = 0. 412) temperature. Yearly average humidity failed to show a constant trend (r 2 = 0. 30). We did not found any upward or downward trend of rainfall (r 2 = 0. 03) in Bangladesh. From Pearson correlation test we found weak association between the climatic variables and the <b>vector-borne</b> <b>diseases.</b> We did not found significant relation with climatic variables and dengue (P> 0. 05), malaria (P> 0. 05) and Kala-azar (P> 0. 05) after generating mathematical model. Conclusion Our study demonstrates that the climatic variables do not have significant effect on the transmission of the aforementioned vector borne diseases in Bangladesh. Multiple environmental factors are may be responsible for diseases transmission. This study recommends government authority to cautiously consider complex nature of relationship between diseases and climatic factors. Detail studies of vector bionomics, continuous monitoring and disease transmission dynamics is essential for predicting outbreaks of diseases and if necessary, control of vectors in Bangladesh.
