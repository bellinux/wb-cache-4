40|$|Abstract — Image {{synthesis}} {{is highly}} dependent on rendering algorithm and optical properties of scenario objects. The goal of this work {{is to develop a}} methodology to obtain some illumination parameters of a real scenario represented by an acquired image, and use these parameters for a <b>virtual</b> <b>scenario</b> rendering with the same objects as the original. The proposed methodology consists, first, in acquiring an image of the working scenario, and by using a DE (Differential Evolution) algorithm to render images that gradually approximate to the real acquired image, by some <b>virtual</b> <b>scenario</b> parameter modification based on the DE optimization. We call it “ED Rendering in the loop”. Finally we use the obtained parameters to render an image to compare it with similar methods.

One way to represent common daily situations in distance education is {{through the use of}} <b>virtual</b> <b>scenarios</b> as an educational resource. These systems require several and specific features and quality attributes. Quality attributes are also known as non-functional requirements, but in many cases non-functional requirements are described poorly, and one way to solve this lack is through the usage of scenarios based on quality attributes.

40|$|The {{science of}} {{computer}} graphics and visualization is intertwined {{in many ways}} with Cognitive Sciences. On the one hand, computer graphics can lead to virtual environments {{in which a person}} is exposed to a <b>virtual</b> <b>scenario.</b> Typically, 3 D-capable display technology combined with tracking systems, which are capable of identifying where the person is located at, are deployed to achieve maximal immersion in that the persons point of view is recreated in the <b>virtual</b> <b>scenario.</b> As a result, an impressive experience is created such that that person is navigating the <b>virtual</b> <b>scenario</b> as if it was real. On the other hand, visualization techniques can be utilized to present the results from a cognitive science experiment to the user such that it provides easier access to the data. This could range from simple plots to more sophisiticated approaches, such as parallel coordinates. In addition, results from cognitive sciences can feed back into the visualization to make the visualization more user-friendly. For example, more intuitive input devices, such as cyber gloves which track the position of a users fingers, could be used to intuitively make selections or view modifications. The Appenzeller Visualization Laboratory is in a perfect position to enable research in all of these areas mentioned above. Sophisticated display systems are available which provide full immersion, ranging from single screens and head-mounted displays to full-size CAVE-type displays. This presentation will illustrate some examples for visualizations of data from the cognitive science realm and showcase display systems and some of their use cases...|$|E
