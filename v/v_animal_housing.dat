40|$|The {{effect of}} feeding {{intensity}} (standard vs. restricted ration) and housing system (males and females kept singly <b>vs.</b> <b>animals</b> kept in male-female pairs) on breeding body condition and whelping was studied in farm standard mink (Mustela vison). Dietary interventions lasted from 20 September to 31 January. The maximum body weights of minks fed the standard ration {{were higher than}} those fed the restricted ration, and, the weights of <b>animals</b> <b>housed</b> in pairs were {{higher than those of}} <b>animals</b> <b>housed</b> singly. Daily feed intake was only slightly lower for singly-housed minks. Singly-housed females came on heat slightly later than females housed with a male. No statistically significant differences were found in whelping success due to feeding intensity or housing system. Whelping results tended, however, to be best for the females on restricted feeding and housed with a male (4. 1 kits/mated female), and poorest for the females fed the standard ration but housed singly (3. 4 kits/mated fe-male). The conventional housing set-up, in which males and females are housed in pairs, is therefore recommended, but feeding from autumn onwards should be restricted. ...|$|R
40|$|Ammonia {{emissions}} from <b>animal</b> <b>houses</b> {{are an important}} environmental issue in the Netherlands. The current technique in the Netherlands to measure ammonia emissions in mechanically ventilated <b>animal</b> <b>houses</b> is the chemiluminescence method (using a NOx monitor after conversion of NH 3 to NO). During campaigns to measure {{emissions from}} <b>animal</b> <b>houses,</b> {{it became clear that}} management {{is an important factor in}} determining the emission level. Differences between <b>animal</b> <b>houses</b> of the same type and kind of animal may differ more than the variation in time and season within one <b>animal</b> <b>house.</b> These management related differences in emission factors point at the need to measure more <b>animal</b> <b>houses</b> during a shorter period. This stresses the need for development of flexible methods to be used in short term measurements, which allows monitoring the ammonia emission from a larger number of animal buildings per year. In this paper, a practical farm with different housing systems and two types of ventilation shafts (with and without a lid in the ventilation shaft to regulate the temperature inside the <b>animal</b> <b>house)</b> was selected to test theperformance of passive flux samplers to measure the ammonia emission from mechanically ventilated <b>animal</b> <b>houses.</b> A statistical t-test shows that the differences between passive flux samplers and the reference method are not significant at the 95 % significance level when combining all measurements. The use of a lid in the ventilation shaft improves the correlation between passive flux samplers and the reference method. As a result of these measurements, passive flux samplers are presented as an alternative to measure the ammonia emission from mechanically ventilated <b>animal</b> <b>houses...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} comply with the ammonia (NH 3) {{emission}} reduction assigned to the Netherlands development of new measures are needed, which should be supported by fast and accurate measurements to arrive at new estimates of the NH 3 emission from each agricultural source. This paper gives an overview of the current methods used in the Netherlands to measure NH 3 emissions from <b>animal</b> <b>houses,</b> and provides alternative methods for some particular situations. For mechanically ventilated <b>animal</b> <b>houses,</b> passive flux samplers placed in the ventilation shafts of the <b>animal</b> <b>house</b> are presented as alternative to measure a larger number of <b>animal</b> <b>houses</b> (replicates) with the same housing system at a low price. For naturally ventilated <b>animal</b> <b>houses,</b> when mixing in the <b>animal</b> <b>house</b> is not good enough to allow measurements within the <b>animal</b> <b>house</b> (internal tracer gas ratio method), two measurement methods are discussed: the Gaussian plume dispersion model, which is usually not suitable for agricultural situations, and the flux frame method, which is not always applicable because of distortion of the flow around the building. Finally, for <b>animal</b> <b>houses</b> with outside yards for the animals, there are at this moment no methods available to measure the NH 3 emissions from these complex situations, although quick box methods (for the outside yards) and a combination of a backward Lagrangian stochastic model with open-path concentration measurements with a tunable diode laser (TDL), look promising.

40|$|According to {{theoretical}} considerations, green buffers {{of trees}} placed around emission sources, the so-called ‘vegetative environmental buffers’ improve air quality {{by reducing the}} concentrations of fine dust from <b>animal</b> <b>housing.</b> The reduction occurs because particles deposit onto the vegetative environmental buffers. However, deposition can only occur when emissions enter the vegetative environmental buffers. The configuration of the vegetative environmental buffer, such as height, shape and distance to the source, affects the fraction of emitted pollution from the <b>animal</b> <b>housing</b> ventilators that actually is blown into the vegetative environmental buffer and thus is susceptible to deposition. To evaluate the efficiency of vegetative environmental buffers on the concentration of fine particles in the emitted pollution from <b>animal</b> <b>housing</b> by ventilators, this fraction needs to be estimated. The {{aim of this study}} is therefore: to determine the fraction of ventilated air from <b>animal</b> <b>housing</b> that is blown into a vegetative environmental buffer which totally surrounds the <b>animal</b> <b>housing,</b> at different wind directions and wind speeds...|$|R

By attending {{to a range of}} different sites such as the zoo, the laboratory, the farm and the animal shelter, to name a few, the book explores material technologies from the perspective that these are integrated parts of a larger biopolitical infrastructure and questions how <b>animal</b> <b>housing</b> systems, and the physical infrastructures that surround central human-animal practices, come into being. The contributions in the book　show in various ways how physical infrastructures of <b>animal</b> <b>housing</b> are always part of a much broader sociocultural and political infrastructure, where the material reality of housing systems combines with human and animal agents, with politics, and with practices. As such, the book explores what kind of practices and relations develop around the physical structures of <b>animal</b> <b>housing,</b> and by whom, and for whom, they are developed. This innovative collection will be of great interest to student and scholars in animal studies, more than human studies, geography, anthropology, and sociology...|$|R
