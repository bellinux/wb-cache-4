5|$|Alprazolam {{may be used}} in {{combination}} with other medications for chemotherapy-induced nausea and <b>vomiting.</b>|$|E
5|$|Antiemetic {{medications}} may {{be helpful}} for treating <b>vomiting</b> in children. Ondansetron has some utility, with a single dose being associated with less need for intravenous fluids, fewer hospitalizations, and decreased <b>vomiting.</b> Metoclopramide might also be helpful. However, the use of ondansetron might possibly be linked to an increased rate of return to hospital in children. The intravenous preparation of ondansetron may be given orally if clinical judgment warrants. Dimenhydrinate, while reducing <b>vomiting,</b> {{does not appear to}} have a significant clinical benefit.|$|E
5|$|Appendicitis {{may present}} with <b>vomiting,</b> {{abdominal}} pain, {{and a small}} amount of diarrhea in up to 33% of cases. This is in contrast to the large amount of diarrhea that is typical of gastroenteritis. Infections of the lungs or urinary tract in children may also cause <b>vomiting</b> or diarrhea. Classical diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and <b>vomiting,</b> but without diarrhea. One study found that 17% of children with DKA were initially diagnosed as having gastroenteritis.|$|E
50|$|The player navigates {{through five}} {{chapters}} and a bonus chapter as Spewer, a small creature that navigates through single-screen levels by utilizing its own <b>vomit</b> as a platform. Spewer can also walk, jump, and swim. The amount of <b>vomit</b> {{available to the}} player is represented by a meter, which can be replaced by Spewer eating food or its own <b>vomit.</b> There are four types of <b>vomit</b> in addition to normal <b>vomit</b> which are accessed by eating pills: white <b>vomit</b> that floats, allowing the player to swim in mid air, red <b>vomit</b> that pushes the player off objects at a faster speed with more power, black <b>vomit</b> hardens to become platforms, and yellow <b>vomit</b> that melts and burns objects. A level editor is included, allowing players {{to create their own}} custom levels.|$|R

5|$|Gastroenteritis {{is usually}} an acute and {{self-limiting}} disease {{that does not}} require medication. The preferred treatment in those with mild to moderate dehydration is oral rehydration therapy (ORT). For children at risk of dehydration from <b>vomiting,</b> taking a single dose of the anti <b>vomiting</b> medication metoclopramide or ondansetron, may be helpful, and butylscopolamine is useful in treating abdominal pain.|$|E
5|$|Inducing <b>vomiting</b> with syrup of ipecac has {{no role in}} {{paracetamol}} overdose {{because the}} <b>vomiting</b> it induces delays the effective administration of activated charcoal and oral acetylcysteine. Liver injury is extremely rare after acute accidental ingestion in children under 6 years of age. Children with accidental exposures do not require gastrointestinal decontamination with either gastric lavage, activated charcoal, or syrup of ipecac.|$|E
5|$|Gastroparesis {{is another}} common misdiagnosis. Like {{rumination}} syndrome, patients with gastroparesis often bring up food following the ingestion of a meal. Unlike rumination, gastroparesis causes <b>vomiting</b> (in contrast to regurgitation) of food, {{which is not}} being digested further, from the stomach. This <b>vomiting</b> occurs several hours after a meal is ingested, preceded by nausea and retching, and has the bitter or sour taste typical of vomit.|$|E

5|$|If bulb {{extracts}} {{come into}} contact with wounds, both central nervous system and cardiac symptoms may result. The scent can also cause toxic reactions such as headaches and <b>vomiting</b> from N. bulbocodium.|$|E
5|$|If {{cerebral}} edema {{is suspected}} because of confusion, recurrent <b>vomiting</b> or other symptoms, computed tomography may be performed to assess its severity and to exclude other causes such as stroke.|$|E
5|$|In {{a series}} of 500 {{consecutive}} obstetric patients, Boisvert and Hudon observed <b>vomiting</b> in 12 (4.8%) patients during or after administration of methoxyflurane anesthesia. These findings compared favorably with those reported for cyclopropane (42%), trichloroethylene (28%) and halothane (4.6%). In another study of 645 obstetric patients, Romagnoli and Korman observed 8 cases (1.2%) of postoperative <b>vomiting,</b> {{one of whom was}} retching before the administration of the anesthetic.|$|E
50|$|Fake <b>vomit</b> {{may also}} be made as a {{concoction}} of liquid non-staining substances {{made to look like}} more realistic human <b>vomit.</b> Children sometimes make fake <b>vomit</b> and leave it in the toilet or sink to convince their parents that they threw up so they can get a day off of school.|$|R

5|$|Other {{symptoms}} include: headache, {{nausea and}} <b>vomiting,</b> abdominal pain, muscle pain, or a scarlatiniform rash or palatal petechiae, {{the latter being}} an uncommon but highly specific finding.|$|E
5|$|Rotaviral {{enteritis}} is a mild {{to severe}} disease characterised by nausea, <b>vomiting,</b> watery diarrhoea and low-grade fever. Once {{a child is}} infected by the virus, there is an incubation period of about two days before symptoms appear. The period of illness is acute. Symptoms often start with <b>vomiting</b> followed by four to eight days of profuse diarrhoea. Dehydration {{is more common in}} rotavirus infection than in most of those caused by bacterial pathogens, and is {{the most common cause of}} death related to rotavirus infection.|$|E

5|$|The {{symptoms}} of poisoning are typically gastrointestinal and neurological. Symptoms occur within 6–12hours of consumption, although cases of more severe poisoning may present sooner—as little as 2 hours after ingestion. Initial symptoms are gastrointestinal, with sudden onset of nausea, <b>vomiting,</b> and watery diarrhea {{which may be}} bloodstained. Dehydration may develop if the <b>vomiting</b> or diarrhea is severe. Dizziness, lethargy, vertigo, tremor, ataxia, nystagmus, and headaches develop soon after; fever often occurs, a distinctive feature which does not develop after poisoning by other types of mushrooms. In most cases of poisoning, symptoms do not progress from these initial symptoms, and patients recover after 2–6 days of illness.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{involves}} reassuring {{the patient}} that the often frightening symptoms will pass, rehydration (fluid replacement) for fluid loss from <b>vomiting,</b> and monitoring for cardiac arrhythmias.|$|E
5|$|Two {{cases from}} Liberia {{experienced}} severe neurological symptoms, including ptosis, nausea, <b>vomiting,</b> tachycardia, and respiratory distress. A child in Ghana died within 20 minutes after being {{bitten by a}} snake suspected to be from this species.|$|E
5|$|During his {{military}} career he had blood <b>vomits,</b> such as before the Battle of Salta; {{he was almost}} too ill {{to participate in the}} battle. It is thought that those <b>vomits</b> originated in the digestive system and were caused by stress, and not in the respiratory system, because the <b>vomits</b> were sporadic, the condition did not become chronic, and it eventually cured itself. Nothing was revealed in the autopsy.|$|R
