5000|$|Thera (also called Santorini) is {{the site}} of a massive {{volcanic}} caldera with an island at its center. <b>Vulcanologists</b> have determined that the island was engulfed by a volcanic eruption, the Thera eruption, around 1600 BC. The event, referred to as the Minoan eruption, was among the most powerful eruptions occurring in the history of civilization, ejecting approximately 60 km³ of material, leaving a layer of pumice and ash 10 to 80 meters thick for 20 to 30 km in all directions and having widespread effects across the eastern Mediterranean region. Volcanic events of this magnitude are known to generate tsunamis and archaeological evidence suggests that such a tsunami may have devastated the coastal Minoan settlements on Crete. [...] Plato did not describe a volcanic eruption, although the events he described as [...] "sunk by an earthquake" [...] or [...] "violent earthquakes, and only a flood (in singular)", could perhaps be intrepreted as consistent with such an eruption and the resulting tsunami.|$|R
40|$|An {{attempt is}} made to {{understand}} the morphology, formation and operation of lava tube systems in pahoehoe lava flows from evidence contained in lava tube caves (landforms resulting from the segmental drainage of lava tube systems). Twelve caves from five contrasting lava flows in Tenerife, Iceland and Sicily (Mt. Etna) are described and the morphogenesis of each is worked out from relationships between flow structure and cave form. The structural evidence adds support to the tube-forming processes previously observed by <b>vulcanologists</b> during periods of effusive volcanic activity. No evidence is found to support the currently popular 'layered lava' theory of cave genesis; instead, each cave is seen {{to be derived from}} a lava tube system which is a network of varying tube types. Knowledge of cave forms enables a visualization of the morphology of lava tube systems and the dynamics of the lava rivers they transport. Ideally, each system is sinuous and partly braided along the flow axis and terminates at a delta-like front, though complexities frequently arise as a result of such processes as stream piracy, the development of overflow tubes and the extension of the axial tube across former deltaic regions of the flow. Discussion of channel forms, comparison with other fluvial systems and knowledge of the efficiency of lava tubes in maintaining flow temperature and mobility suggests that lava tube systems are 'adjusted' forms: it is only through their construction that temperature and mobility are maintained sufficiently to enable the continued advance of the flow front downslope. At the front lava emerges from the tube system as a jet flow. As a result, it is argued that the development of pahoehoe lava flows is predictable and amenable to future quantification through the application of jet theory...|$|R
