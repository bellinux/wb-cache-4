5|$|Gomphus clavatus is {{commonly}} known as pig's ears, alluding to the violet underside and yellowish cap of the fruit bodies, although this <b>vernacular</b> <b>name</b> is also used for Discina perlata. Other English common names for this species include clustered chanterelle and violet chanterelle. Gray coined the name clubbed gomphe. In the Sherpa language of Nepal the fungus is known as Eeshyamo ("mother-in-law"), as its imposing fruit body is reminiscent of a mother-in-law, who has a dominant role in the Sherpa family.|$|E
5|$|In {{parts of}} the range, the russet sparrow inhabits towns, and in most of its range, it occurs near cultivation, and is a minor pest of agriculture. Though it damages crops, it also feeds its nestlings largely on insect pests. In China, the russet sparrow has been {{recorded}} as a captive bird, kept with the Eurasian tree sparrow. In Japan it was eaten in the 1870s and sold in the Yokohama game market. The russet sparrow is known well enough in the Himalayas that in most languages it has a different <b>vernacular</b> <b>name</b> from the Eurasian tree sparrow. Examples of these vernacular names include lal gouriya in Hindi and kang-che-go-ma in Tibetan. The Japanese artist Hokusai portrayed the russet sparrow, and due to this, it has appeared on postage stamps featuring Japanese art in Japan, The Gambia, and Guyana.|$|E
5|$|B. pendula is {{distinguished}} from the related downy birch (B. pubescens, the other common European birch) in having hairless, warty shoots (hairy and without warts in downy birch), more triangular leaves with double serration on the margins (more ovoid and with single serrations in downy birch), and whiter bark often with scattered black fissures (greyer, less fissured, in downy birch). It is also distinguished cytologically, silver birch being diploid (with two sets of chromosomes), whereas downy birch is tetraploid (four sets of chromosomes). Hybrids between the two are known, but are very rare, and being triploid, are sterile. The two have differences in habitat requirements, with silver birch found mainly on dry, sandy soils, and downy birch more common on wet, poorly drained sites such as clay soils and peat bogs. Silver birch also demands slightly more summer warmth than does downy birch, which is significant in the cooler parts of Europe. Many North American texts treat the two species as conspecific (and cause confusion by combining the downy birch's alternative <b>vernacular</b> <b>name</b> 'white birch', with the scientific name B. pendula of the other species), but they are regarded as distinct species throughout Europe.|$|E

40|$|In {{conservation}} science, {{assessments of}} trends and priorities for actions often focus on species as the management unit. Studies on species coverage in online media are commonly conducted by using species <b>vernacular</b> <b>names.</b> However, {{the use of}} species <b>vernacular</b> <b>names</b> for web-based data search is problematic due to the high risk of mismatches in results. While the use of Latin names may produce more consistent results, it is uncertain whether a search using Latin names will produce unbiased results as compared to <b>vernacular</b> <b>names.</b> We assessed the potential of Latin names {{to be used as}} an alternative to <b>vernacular</b> <b>names</b> for the data mining within the field of conservation science. By using Latin and <b>vernacular</b> <b>names,</b> we searched for species from four species groups: diurnal birds of prey, Carnivora, Primates and marine mammals. We assessed the relationship of the results obtained within different online sources, such as Internet pages, newspapers and social media networks. Results indicated that the search results based on Latin and <b>vernacular</b> <b>names</b> were highly correlated, and confirmed that one may be used as an alternative for the other. We also demonstrated the potential of the number of images posted on the Internet to be used as an indication of the public attention towards different species...|$|R

500|$|Frédéric Cuvier had {{received}} the specimen he described from his brother's stepson, Alfred Duvaucel, who had sent it [...] "from the mountains north of India".

Panda is the French name for the Roman goddess of peace and travellers, who was called upon before starting a difficult journey. Whether this is the origin of the French <b>vernacular</b> <b>name</b> panda remains uncertain. Later publications claim the name was adopted from a Himalayan language.|$|E
500|$|The <b>vernacular</b> <b>name</b> cep {{is derived}} from the Catalan cep or its French name cèpe, {{although}} the latter is a generic term applying to several related species. In France, it is more fully cèpe de Bordeaux, derived from the Gascon cep [...] "trunk" [...] for its fat stalk, ultimately from the Latin cippus [...] "stake". Ceppatello, ceppatello buono, ceppatello bianco, giallo leonato, ghezzo, and moreccio are names from Italian dialects, and ciurenys or surenys is another term in Catalan. The French-born King Charles XIV John popularised B.edulis in Sweden after 1818, and is honoured in the local <b>vernacular</b> <b>name</b> Karljohanssvamp, as well as the Danish name Karl Johan svamp. The monarch cultivated the fungus about his residence, Rosersberg Palace. The Finnish name is herkkutatti, herkku from herkullinen, which means delicious, and tatti, describing the type of mushroom.

50|$|Since the {{pioneering}} work of Linnaeus, species of organisms have had recognized scientific names in Latin, Greek, or a modernized derivative {{of one or}} both of those languages. In most groups of organisms, the scientific names are sufficient, enjoying widespread use among academics and amateurs alike.

However, <b>vernacular</b> <b>names</b> change frequently and often vary from place to place. Consequently, there is a need to have a degree of consistency in the <b>vernacular</b> <b>names</b> used around the world.|$|R

500|$|Specimens were {{initially}} collected at King George Sound, and the splendid fairywren then described as Saxicola splendens by the French naturalists Jean René Constant Quoy and Joseph Paul Gaimard in 1830, {{three years before}} John Gould gave it the scientific name of Malurus pectoralis and <b>vernacular</b> <b>name</b> of banded superb-warbler.

500|$|The {{generic name}} Neotragus is {{constituted}} by two Greek words: neo ("new") and tragus ("he-goat"), while the specific name pygmaeus {{comes from the}} Greek pugmaios ("as small as a fist", {{in reference to the}} diminutive size of the antelope).
