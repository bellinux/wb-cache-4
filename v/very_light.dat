5|$|November 21, 2006: An eastward-moving weather system {{produces}} a <b>very</b> <b>light</b> dusting and snowflakes in central Florida. It {{is the first}} snow in November in the state since 1912.|$|E
5|$|Dreadnoughts {{also carried}} lighter weapons. Many early dreadnoughts carried a {{secondary}} armament of <b>very</b> <b>light</b> guns designed {{to fend off}} enemy torpedo boats. The calibre and weight of secondary armament tended to increase, as the range of torpedoes and the staying power of the destroyers expected to carry them also increased. From the end of World War I onwards, battleships had to be equipped with many light guns as anti-aircraft armament.|$|E
5|$|It {{is known}} that the {{silicate}} particles have a real index of refraction ranging between 1.5 and 1.6 for visible light. However, there is a spectrum of colors associated with samples of volcanic ash, from <b>very</b> <b>light</b> to dark gray. This makes for variations in the measured imaginary refractive index under visible light.|$|E

50|$|Nuclear fusion {{produces}} {{energy by}} combining the <b>very</b> <b>lightest</b> elements into more tightly bound elements (such as hydrogen into helium), and nuclear fission produces energy by splitting the heaviest elements (such as uranium and plutonium) into more tightly bound elements (such as barium and krypton). Both processes produce energy, because middle-sized nuclei are the most tightly bound of all.|$|R
5|$|Rare colours {{can appear}} {{unexpectedly}} in certain lines, for instance while an all-white cocker is usually bred by selective breeding of <b>very</b> <b>light</b> golden strains, {{they can still}} appear very uncommonly to parents who are dark colored. A noted occurrence of this happened in 1943, when a grandson of My Own Brucie, Best in Show at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 1940 and 1941, was born all-white.|$|E
5|$|Birds are {{tetrapods}} {{but though}} their hind limbs {{are used for}} walking or hopping, their front limbs are wings covered with feathers and adapted for flight. Birds are endothermic, have a high metabolic rate, a light skeletal system and powerful muscles. The long bones are thin, hollow and <b>very</b> <b>light.</b> Air sac extensions from the lungs occupy the centre of some bones. The sternum is wide and usually has a keel and the caudal vertebrae are fused. There are no teeth and the narrow jaws are adapted into a horn-covered beak. The eyes are relatively large, particularly in nocturnal species such as owls. They face forwards in predators and sideways in ducks.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, the Allies {{landed at}} Arawe on New Britain on 15 December, while the Australian 4th Infantry Brigade, having {{commenced}} its advance {{up the coast}} from Gusika on 3 December, continued on passing through Bald Hill, Lakona and Kiligia {{on its way to}} Fortification Point as it led the opening phase of the Australian advance towards Sio. In late December, the 20th Infantry Brigade, which had largely been rested during the advance on Wareo, took over from the 4th. After sweeping up the coast quickly against light Japanese resistance, they captured Sio in early January 1944, having suffered only <b>very</b> <b>light</b> casualties.|$|E
60|$|She {{stood before}} Amyntas, letting him gaze; then {{suddenly}} {{she lifted her}} eyes to his. Amyntas's heart gave a mighty beat against his chest. Her eyes, her eyes were the <b>very</b> <b>lights</b> of love, carrying passionate kisses on their beams. A sob of ecstasy choked the youth, and {{he felt that he}} could kneel down and worship before them.|$|R
50|$|The {{reciprocity}} law specifies the total exposure, but {{the response of}} a photographic material to a constant total exposure may not remain constant for very long exposures in <b>very</b> faint <b>light,</b> such as photographing a starry sky, or very short exposures in <b>very</b> bright <b>light,</b> such as photographing the sun. This is known as reciprocity failure of the material (film, paper, or sensor).|$|R

5|$|Final Fantasy is a media {{franchise}} {{created by}} Hironobu Sakaguchi and owned by Square Enix that includes video games, motion pictures, and other merchandise. The series began in 1987 as an eponymous role-playing video game developed by Square, spawning {{a video game}} series that became the central focus of the franchise. The music of the Final Fantasy series refers to the soundtracks of the Final Fantasy series of video games, {{as well as the}} surrounding medley of soundtrack, arranged, and compilation albums. The series' music ranges from <b>very</b> <b>light</b> background music to emotionally intense interweavings of character and situation leitmotifs.|$|E
5|$|In tsunami prone regions, strong {{earthquakes}} {{serve as}} familiar warnings, {{and this is}} especially true for earthquakes in Indonesia. Previous estimates of the tsunami hazard for the Java coastline may have minimized the risk to the area, and to the northwest along the Sumatran coast, the risk is substantially higher for tsunami, especially near Padang. Previous events along the coast of Java in 1921 and again in 1994 illustrate the need for an accurate assessment of the threat. The July 2006 earthquake had an unusually slow rupture velocity which resulted in minor shaking on land for around three minutes, but the intensity was <b>very</b> <b>light</b> relative to the size of the tsunami that followed.|$|E
5|$|The Allied {{casualties}} at the landings were <b>very</b> <b>light,</b> {{with only}} 95killed and 385 wounded. 40 of those casualties {{were caused by}} a rocket-boosted Henschel Hs 293 guided gliding bomb launched from a Do-217 bomber aircraft by a rare appearance of the bomber wing KG 100, which sank the tank landing ship USS LST-282. In conjunction with the sea landing, airborne and glider landings (Mission Albatross followed by Mission Dove, Mission Bluebird, and Mission Canary) around the area of Le Muy were carried out. They were as successful as the beach landings, with only 104 dead, 24 of which were caused by glider accidents and 18 by parachute accidents.|$|E

50|$|In 1957, the B2FH {{group showed}} the famous result {{that all of}} the {{elements}} except the <b>very</b> <b>lightest,</b> are produced by nuclear processes inside stars. For this they received the Warner Prize in 1959. In her later research {{she was one of the}} first to measure the masses, compositions, and rotation curves of galaxies and was one of the pioneers in the spectroscopic study of quasars.|$|R

5|$|The first dreadnoughts {{tended to}} have a <b>very</b> <b>light</b> {{secondary}} armament intended {{to protect them from}} torpedo boats. Dreadnought carried 12-pounder guns; each of her twenty-two 12-pounders could fire at least 15 rounds a minute at any torpedo boat making an attack. The South Carolinas and other early American dreadnoughts were similarly equipped. At this stage, torpedo boats were expected to attack separately from any fleet actions. Therefore, {{there was no need to}} armour the secondary gun armament, or to protect the crews from the blast effects of the main guns. In this context, the light guns tended to be mounted in unarmoured positions high on the ship to minimize weight and maximize field of fire.|$|E
5|$|Two-color {{varieties}} {{always have}} a white base color with areas of the second color. Tan and white {{is the most common}} two-color variety, but there is a wide range of other colors including lemon, a <b>very</b> <b>light</b> tan; red, a reddish, almost orange, brown; and liver, a darker brown, and black. Liver is not common and is not permitted in some standards; it tends to occur with yellow eyes. Ticked or mottled varieties may be either white or black with different colored flecks (ticking), such as the blue-mottled or bluetick beagle, which has spots that appear to be a midnight-blue color, similar to the coloring of the Bluetick Coonhound. Some tricolor beagles also have ticking of various colors in their white areas.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on May 14, which {{is believed to have been}} the impetus to Barbara. The wave axis crossed Central America on May 25 and emerged into the eastern North Pacific Ocean the next day. Interacting with the Intertropical Convergence Zone, a broad surface low pressure area developed within the area on May 27, and as it drifted northward the system maintained limited and disorganized convection. On May 29, convection increased and became concentrated near the low pressure center, and banding features developed in its eastern semicircle as the circulation became better defined. It is estimated the system formed into Tropical Depression Two-E at 1800UTC on May 29 about 115miles (185km) southeast of Puerto Escondido, Oaxaca. Upon becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression was stationary in an area with warm sea surface temperatures, <b>very</b> <b>light</b> wind shear, and favorable upper-level conditions.|$|E

Home-Hay saw a machine of another squadron which had lost its formation and was at a low altitude firing <b>Very</b> <b>lights</b> for assistance as it was being attacked. [...] Captain Home-Hay brought his formation down to 9,000 feet and picked this machine up in his formation, and escorted it to the lines." ...|$|R
50|$|Edward Wilson Very (October 26, 1847 - March 1, 1910) was an American {{naval officer}} who adopted and popularized a single-shot breech-loading snub-nosed flare gun that fired flares that bear his name (<b>Very</b> <b>lights).</b> During his naval career he captained a gunboat off {{the shores of}} Japan, held {{positions}} in engineering, naval ordnance, artillery and signal staff postings and saw diplomatic service with the U.S. Legation in Paris.|$|R

5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} lithium {{is composed}} of two stable isotopes, 6Li and 7Li, the latter being the more abundant (92.5% natural abundance). Both natural isotopes have anomalously low nuclear binding energy per nucleon (compared to the neighboring elements on the periodic table, helium and beryllium); lithium is the only low numbered element that can produce net energy through nuclear fission. The two lithium nuclei have lower binding energies per nucleon than any other stable nuclides other than deuterium and helium-3. As a result of this, though <b>very</b> <b>light</b> in atomic weight, lithium is less common in the Solar System than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements. Seven radioisotopes have been characterized, the most stable being 8Li with a half-life of 838 ms and 9Li with a half-life of 178ms. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are shorter than 8.6ms. The shortest-lived isotope of lithium is 4Li, which decays through proton emission and has a half-life of 7.6 × 10−23 s.|$|E
5|$|Ryder {{is sought}} after by the town's women but begins courting a <b>very</b> <b>light</b> mixed-race woman from Washington, DC named Molly Dixon. He plans to propose {{to her at}} the next Blue Vein ball, for which he is giving a speech. Before the talk, he meets an older, plain-looking black woman. Her name is 'Liza Jane, and she is searching for her husband Sam Taylor, whom she has not seen in 25 years. She says she was married to Sam before the Civil War, when she was enslaved and he was a hired {{apprentice}} to the family of her master. Despite Taylor's being a free black, the family tried to sell him into slavery. She assisted Sam in escaping, and he promised to return and free her, but she was sold to a different master. Ryder says that Taylor could have died, may have outgrown her, or could have remarried. However, she persists in saying that her husband has remained faithful, and refuses to stop looking. Ryder advises her that slave marriages did not count after the war; marriages had to be officially made legal. She shows him an old picture of Sam and leaves.|$|E
5|$|The ponies {{are most}} {{commonly}} bay, chestnut, or grey. Few coat colours are excluded: piebald, skewbald, and blue-eyed cream are not allowed; palomino and <b>very</b> <b>light</b> chestnut are only {{accepted by the}} stud book as geldings and mares. Blue eyes are never accepted. White markings {{on the head and}} lower legs are allowed, unless they appear behind the head, above the point of the hock in the hind leg, or above the metacarpal bone at the bend in the knee in the foreleg. Ponies failing to pass these standards may not be registered in the purebred section of the stud book, but are recorded in the appendix, known as the X-register. The offspring of these animals may not be registered as purebred New Forest ponies, as the stud book is closed and only the offspring of purebred-approved registered ponies may be registered as purebred.|$|E
