It's hard to come to foreign countries ‎and get decisions. It just means {{so much to me}} to come here and get the decision." [...] He then took the microphone to thank Klitschko, [...] "I'd like to say to Wladimir, you're a great champion. And thanks <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> me. It was all fun and games during the buildup." [...] Klitschko failed to throw his well-known right hand, mostly due to Fury's constant movement and mocking. He said, [...] "Tyson was the faster and better man tonight. I felt quite comfortable in the first six rounds, but I was astonished that Tyson was so fast in the second half as well. I couldn't throw my right hand because the advantage was the longer distance he had." [...] Klitschko had a rematch clause in place.|$|E

6000|$|In this {{condition}} of mind, he had determined that he {{owed it to}} himself to do or say something that should frighten his lordship into a more generous final arrangement. There had been, {{he said to himself}} again and again, such a confidence with a lady of so high a rank, that the owner of it ought not to be allowed to languish upon two or even upon three hundred a-year. If the whole thing could really be explained to the Marquis, the Marquis would probably see it himself. And to all this was to be added the fact that no harm had been done. The Marchioness owed him <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> wished to assist her in getting rid of an heir that was disagreeable to her. The Marquis owed him more for not having done it. And they both owed him very much in that he had never said a word of it all to anybody else. He had thought that he might be clever enough to make the Marquis understand something of this without actually explaining it. That some mysterious promise had been made, and that, as the promise could not be kept, some compensation should be awarded,--this was what he had desired to bring home to the mind of the Marquis. He had betrayed no confidence. He intended to betray none. He was very anxious that the Marquis should be aware, that as he, Mr. Greenwood, was a gentleman, all confidences would be safe in his hands; but then the Marquis ought to do his part of the business, and not turn his confidential Chaplain out of the house after {{a quarter of a century}} with a beggarly annuity of two hundred a-year! ...|$|E

Both their uncle and aunt <b>had</b> done <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> them, <b>had</b> been true to them in their need, and had submitted to endless discomforts in order that their nieces might have respectable shelter in their great need; but nevertheless their conduct had not been of a kind to produce either love or friendship. Each of the sisters felt that she had been much better off at Nuncombe Putney, and that either the weakness of Mrs. Stanbury, or the hardness of Priscilla, was preferable to the repulsive forbearance of their clerical host. He did not scold them. He never threw it in Mrs. Trevelyan's teeth that she had been separated from her husband by her own fault; he did not tell them of his own discomfort. But he showed it in every gesture, and spoke of it in every tone of his voice;--so that Mrs. Trevelyan could not refrain from apologising for the misfortune of her presence.|$|R

60|$|Now, as Polly was by {{no means}} a perfect creature, I am free to confess that the old temptation assailed her more than once that week, for, when the first {{excitement}} of the dodging reform had subsided, she missed the pleasant little interviews that used to put a certain flavor of romance into her dull, hard-working days. She liked Mr. Sydney <b>very</b> <b>much,</b> <b>for</b> he <b>had</b> always been kind and friendly since the early times when he had treated the little girl with a courtesy which the young woman gratefully remembered. I don't think it was his wealth, accomplishments, or position that most attracted Polly, though these doubtless possessed a greater influence than she suspected. It was that indescribable something which women are quick to see and feel in men who have been blessed with wise and good mothers. This had an especial charm to Polly, for she soon found that this side of his character was not shown to every one. With most girls, he was very like the other young men of his set, except perhaps in a certain grace of manner which was as natural to him as his respect for all womankind. But with Fanny and Polly he showed the domestic traits and virtues which are more engaging to womanly women than any amount of cool intellect or worldly wisdom.|$|R

60|$|Some time after, Pelias, the usurping king of Iolcus, {{was driving}} a mule-car through the market-place, {{when he saw a}} fine young man, with hair flowing on his shoulders, two spears in his hand, and only one sandal.

And this youth was really Jason, the son of his brother Æson, from whom he had taken the kingdom.

He had lost his shoe in the mud, while kindly {{carrying}} an old woman across a river, little knowing that she was really the goddess Juno, who had come down in that form to make trial of the kindness of men, and who was thus made his friend for ever.

Mrs. White---or, as her nieces could not help calling her among themselves, the Contessa di Rocca Marina---urged that her sister Jane should join the company, and bring Gillian to act as the other bridesmaid.

Mr. Flight, {{the only one of}} the party who had travelled before in the sense of being a tourist, was amused by the keen and intense delight of Miss Mohun as well as the younger ones in all they beheld, and he steered them with full experience of hotels and of what ought to be visited, so as to be an excellent courier.|$|R
40|$|Many water {{resources}} systems {{are characterized by}} multiple objectives. For multiobjective optimization, typically {{there can be no}} single optimal solution which can simultaneously satisfy all the goals, but rather a set of technologically efficient noninferior or Pareto optimal solutions exists. Generating those Pareto optimal solutions is a challenging task and often difficulties arise in using the conventional methods. In the optimization of reservoir systems, most of the times there is interdependence among one or more decision variables. Recently, it is emphasized that the evolutionary operators used in differential evolution algorithms are <b>very</b> <b>much</b> suitable <b>for</b> problems <b>having</b> interdependence among the decision variables. This paper utilizes this aspect and presents an efficient and effective approach for multiobjective optimization, namely multiobjective differential evolution (MODE) algorithm with an application to a case study in reservoir system optimization. The developed MODE algorithm is first tested on a few benchmark test problems and validated with standard performance measures by comparing them with the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-II. On achieving satisfactory performance for test problems, it is applied to generate Pareto optimal solutions to a multiobjective reservoir operation problem. It is found that MODE provides many alternative Pareto optimal solutions with uniform coverage and convergence to true Pareto optimal fronts. The results obtained show that the proposed MODE can be a viable alternative for generating optimal trade-offs in multiobjective optimization of {{water resources}} systems...|$|R
60|$|The Greeks of the Achaian League {{began to}} have quarrels among themselves, and when the Romans {{interfered}} a fierce spirit broke out, {{and they wanted to}} have their old freedom, forgetting how entirely unable they were to stand against the power of the Romans. Caius Cæcilius Metellus, a man of one of the best and most gracious Roman families, was patient with them and did his best to pacify them, being most unwilling to ruin the noble old historical cities; but these foolish Greeks fancied that his kindness showed weakness, and forced on the war, sending a troop to guard the pass of Thermopylæ, but they were swept away. Unfortunately, Metellus had to go out of office, and Lucius Mummius, a fierce, rude, and ignorant soldier, came in his stead to complete the conquest. Corinth was taken, utterly ruined and plundered throughout, and a huge amount of treasure was sent to Rome, as well as pictures and statues famed all over the world. Mummius was <b>very</b> <b>much</b> laughed at <b>for</b> <b>having</b> been told they must be carried in his triumph; and yet, not understanding their beauty, he told the sailors to whose charge they were given, that if they were lost, new ones must be supplied. However, he was an honest man, who did not help himself out of the plunder, as far too many were doing. After that, Achaia was made a Roman province.|$|R
60|$|I {{got your}} aunt's last letter at Boston yesterday, Christmas Day morning, when I was {{starting}} at eleven o'clock {{to come back}} to this place. I wanted it <b>very</b> <b>much,</b> <b>for</b> I <b>had</b> a frightful cold (English colds are nothing to those of this country), and was exceedingly depressed and miserable. Not that I had any reason but illness for being so, since the Bostonians had been quite astounding in their demonstrations. I never saw anything like them on Christmas Eve. But it is a bad country to be unwell and travelling in; you are one of say a hundred people in a heated car, with a great stove in it, and all the little windows closed, and the hurrying and banging about are indescribable. The atmosphere is detestable, and the motion often all but intolerable. However, we got our dinner here at eight o'clock, and plucked up a little, and I made some hot gin punch to drink a merry Christmas to all at home in. But it must be confessed that we were both very dull. I have been in bed all day until two o'clock, and here I am now (at three o'clock) a little better. But I am not fit to read, and I must read to-night. After watching the general character pretty closely, I became quite sure that Dolby was wrong on the length of the stay and the number of readings we had proposed in this place. I am quite certain that {{it is one of the}} national peculiarities that what they want must be difficult of attainment. I therefore a few days ago made a coup d'état, and altered the whole scheme. We shall go to Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, also some New England towns between Boston and this place, away to the falls of Niagara, and off far west to Chicago and St. Louis, before coming back for ten farewell readings here, preceded by farewells at Boston, leaving Canada altogether. This will not prolong the list beyond eighty-four readings, the exact original number, and will, please God, work it all out in April. In my next, I daresay, I shall be able to send the exact list, so that you may know every day where we are. There has been a great storm here for a few days, and the streets, though wet, are becoming passable again. Dolby and Osgood are out in it to-day on a variety of business, and left in grave and solemn state. Scott and the gasman are stricken with dumb concern, not having received one single letter from home since they left. What their wives can have done with the letters they take it <b>for</b> granted they <b>have</b> written, is their stormy speculation at the door of my hall dressing-room every night.|$|R
