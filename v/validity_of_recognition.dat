We demonstrate that, for 2 -alternative forced-choice decision tasks, less-is-more effects (reduced performance with additional learning) are not restricted to recognition-based inference but {{can also be seen}} in circumstances where inference is knowledge-based but item knowledge is limited. One reason why such effects may not be observed more widely is the dependence of the effect on specific values for the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> and knowledge cues.

Using a heterogeneous randomly stopped sum model, we first establish the relationship between consumers ’ actual attention to print ads, as measured through eye tracking, and subsequent ad recognition measures. We find ad recognition measures to be systematically biased because consumers infer prior attention from the ad layout and their familiarity with the brands in the ads. Such biases undermine the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> tests for advertising practice and theory development. Second, we quantify {{the positive and negative}} diagnostic value of ad recognition for prior attention. Third, we demonstrate how these diagnostic values can be used to develop bias-adjusted recognition (BAR) scores that more accurately reflect prior attention. Finally, we show that differences in the scores from ad recognition tests based on in-home versus lab exposure attenuate when our bias-adjustment procedure is applied...|$|E

However, {{there are some}} misidentifications in object recognition using a single camera. In this study, robust object instance registration method is proposed to detect misidentifications of object recog-nition. There are four types of properties for reasoning mechanisms: confidence of recognition of objects for statistical reasoning, inherent properties of object for ontological reasoning, spatial relation between objects for spatial reasoning and temporal relation of inter-vals between object detections for temporal reasoning. <b>Validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> of an object will be proved by using rules of reasoning mechanisms, since the object may not be assured to be correctly identified {{at the time of}} recognition.

40|$|According to the {{recognition}} heuristic (RH) theory, decisions follow {{the recognition}} principle: Given a high <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>recognition</b> cue, people should prefer recognized choice options compared to unrecognized ones. Assuming that the memory strength of choice options is strongly correlated {{with both the}} choice criterion and recognition judgments, the RH is a reasonable strategy that approximates optimal decisions {{with a minimum of}} cognitive effort (Davis-Stober, Dana, & Budescu, 2010). However, theories <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> memory are not generally compatible with this assumption. For example, some threshold models <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> presume that recognition judgments can arise from two types of cognitive states: (1) certainty states in which judgments are almost perfectly correlated with memory strength and (2) uncertainty states in which recognition judgments reflect guessing rather than differences in memory strength.

40|$|Background. Studies <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> {{depression}} in elderly (aged 65 or more) medical inpatients showed low <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> depression by attending physicians. However, {{few studies have}} compared different measures <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> depression. Objectives. To evaluate the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> four <b>recognition</b> indicators and a global measure <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> against a diagnosis of depression {{and the effect of}} patient characteristics on <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> depression. Methods. In a cohort of 264 medical inpatients 65 years and over (115 with major or minor depression, 78 with no depression), using data from two previous studies, sensitivities, specificities, and diagnostic odds ratios (DOR) of four indicators <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> (Diagnosis, Symptoms, Treatment and Referral) and a global measure <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> (any <b>of</b> the four indicators) were calculated. Stratified analysis was conducted to assess recognition by age, gender, history of depression, antidepressant use before admission, severity of depression, comorbidity, duration of hospitalization, disability and hospital of admission. The associations of patient characteristics with recognition were described among patients with major or minor depression using multiple logistic regression. Results. Less than half of the patients were recognized according to the global measure <b>of</b> <b>recognition.</b> The indicator with the highest sensitivity was Treatment (27. 8 %, 95 % CI: 20. 0 - 37. 0), while the indicator with the best specificity was Diagnosis (96. 6 %, 95 % CI: 91. 9 - 98. 7). The unadjusted DOR <b>of</b> global <b>recognition</b> was 2. 6 (95 % CI: 1. 5, 4. 4).

The {{vast majority of}} studies examining this causal relationship have used a social script interpretive bias training and have tested whether interpretations were indeed changed.

Six paper and pencil phonemic awareness (PA) tests, phoneme recognition among them, are administered groupwise to Dutch children a few months before the beginning of formal literacy education. Additional phonological tests and an early reading test are administered individually. Ten months later, children are tested again with PA and literacy tests. Structural equation modeling shows the relations among tests to correspond broadly with findings reported in the literature. The PA test scores are determined by one common factor, and the early PA factor influences later literacy through its influence on later PA skill. Phoneme segmentation has the highest loading on the PA factor, but phoneme recognition is its best paper and pencil representative. Unlike phoneme segmentation, phoneme recognition competence can develop in the absence of literacy skills.

40|$|H- 2 {{heterologous}} T cell hybridomas {{were used}} to study the genetic control of dual, anti-nominal antigen and anti-self H- 2 specificity of H- 2 restricted T cell factors. Each of four hybridoma clones produced two helper factors. One was restricted for the Ia type of the normal T cell partner (H- 2 b), whereas the other was restricted for the ia type of the lymphoma partner (H- 2 k) of the somatic hybrid. This was shown by affinity separation on parental type spleen cells and on monoclonal anti-I-A-Sepharose. Both factors had carrier (chicken gamma globulin; CGG) -specific helper effect, and both bound to anti-VH- 315 -Sepharose. Because the lymphoma (BW- 5147) partner could not contribute a CGG- specific locus, the H- 2 k-restricted, CGG-specific factor {{had to be the}} product of segregating anti-nominal and anti-self loci. This suggests that dual specificity is due to two independent loci and support the <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> dual <b>recognition</b> concepts.

By using a difference-in-difference approach, we provide empirical evidence that di- vergent paths of adjustment between family and non-family firms exist, with family firms systematically preferring to safeguard workplaces close to the firm's headquarters, compared to other plants. We offer a new theoretical framework consistent with these findings, that we define the social recognition motive, based on the psychological rela- tion linking the family owner with his community of reference. We investigate possible alternative explanations for the results, most of whom can be ruled out in our setting.
