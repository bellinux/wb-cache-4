In contrast, incremental cost is the composition of total cost from the surrogate of contributions, where any increment {{is determined by the}} contribution of the cost factors, not necessarily by single units.|$|E

The decision whether to take a car or train for a particular journey depends mostly on the marginal price per kilometer, not on the total cost.|$|E

30|$|More specifically, we regress the log {{of profits}} on the log of {{marginal}} <b>variable</b> <b>costs</b> year effects, firm-specific fixed effects, {{and with a}} time-varying coefficient on log <b>variable</b> <b>costs.</b> Marginal <b>variable</b> <b>costs</b> are defined as <b>variable</b> <b>costs</b> over turnover. We use information on all firms that file annual accounts for the whole year from January to December, except those firms that can be assumed not to maximise profits such as non-profit associations. We identify outliers as firms with <b>variable</b> <b>costs</b> over turnover below or above the 5 th and 95 th percentile of the distribution and we use the same criterion for profits over total assets.|$|R
25|$|Yield {{management}} is of especially high relevance {{in cases where}} the constant costs are relatively high compared to the variable costs. The less <b>variable</b> <b>cost</b> there is, the more the additional revenue earned will contribute to the overall profit. This is because it focuses on maximizing expected marginal revenue for a given operation and planning horizon. It optimizes resource utilization by ensuring inventory availability to customers with the highest expected net revenue contribution and extracting the greatest level of ‘willingness to pay’ from the entire customer base. Yield management practitioners typically claim 3% to 7% incremental revenue gains. In many industries this can equate to over 100% increase in profits.|$|E

[...] He offers a substitute, called throughput accounting, that uses throughput (money for goods sold to customers) in place of output (goods produced that may sell or may boost inventory) and considers labor as a fixed rather than as a <b>variable</b> <b>cost.</b> He defines inventory simply as everything the organization owns that it plans to sell, including buildings, machinery, and many other things in addition to the categories listed here.

2500|$|The {{portion of}} the {{marginal}} cost curve above its intersection with the average <b>variable</b> <b>cost</b> curve is the supply curve for a firm operating in a perfectly competitive market. (the {{portion of the}} MC curve below its intersection with the AVC curve {{is not part of}} the supply curve because a firm would not operate at price below the shut down point) This is not true for firms operating in other market structures. For example, while a monopoly [...] "has" [...] an MC curve it does not have a supply curve. [...] In a perfectly competitive market, a supply curve shows the quantity a seller's willing and able to supply at each price – for each price there is a unique quantity that would be supplied. The one-to-one relationship simply is absent in the case of a monopoly. With a monopoly there could be an infinite number of prices associated with a given quantity. It all depends on the shape and position of the demand curve and its accompanying marginal revenue curve.|$|E

2500|$|Marginal {{costs are}} not {{affected}} by changes in fixed cost. Marginal costs can be expressed as ∆C(q)∕∆Q. Since fixed costs do not vary with (depend on) changes in quantity, MC is ∆VC∕∆Q. Thus if fixed cost were to double, the cost of MC would not be affected, and consequently the profit maximizing quantity and price would not change. [...] This can be illustrated by graphing the short run total cost curve and the short run <b>variable</b> <b>cost</b> curve. The shape of the curves are identical. Each curve initially increases at a decreasing rate, reaches an inflection point, then increases at an increasing rate. The only difference between the curves is that the SRVC curve begins from the origin while the SRTC curve originates on the y-axis. The distance {{of the origin of}} the SRTC above the origin represents the fixed cost – the vertical distance between the curves. This distance remains constant as the quantity produced, Q, increases. MC is the slope of the SRVC curve. A change in fixed cost would be reflected by a change in the vertical distance between the SRTC and SRVC curve. Any such change would have no effect on the shape of the SRVC curve and therefore its slope at any point – MC.|$|E

40|$|Conventional hedonic {{analysis}} measures {{willingness to}} pay for attributes {{on the basis of}} marginal fixed costs. We argue that in many cases <b>variable</b> <b>costs</b> are also affected by these attributes and that this should be taken into account. We develop a simple model to show that the marginal {{willingness to pay}} for a quality attribute has to be equal to the full marginal cost, which includes marginal fixed as well as <b>variable</b> <b>costs.</b> The model is applied to Danish data on car ownership and use. We use a nonparametric estimation procedure to estimate hedonic price functions for fixed and <b>variable</b> <b>costs.</b> We recover each consumer's marginal willingness to pay, the marginal fixed costs, and the marginal <b>variable</b> <b>costs</b> for car attributes using first-order conditions for utility maximization. We show that the marginal fixed and <b>variable</b> <b>costs</b> have the same (positive) sign and that both contribute substantially to the marginal willingness to pay. Estimation results suggest that marginal <b>variable</b> <b>costs</b> are on average about 20 % of the full marginal costs. Finally, we estimate the distribution of the marginal rate of substitution between quality attributes and <b>variable</b> <b>costs,</b> which can be interpreted as a structural parameter, and we investigate how this marginal rate of substitution varies with household characteristics. durable goods, willingness to pay, hedonic analysis, nonparametrics, car market...|$|R
