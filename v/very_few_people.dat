5|$|The {{suburb of}} Beaumont, in the City of Burnside, was founded as a {{purpose-built}} village by Sir Samuel Davenport in 1848. The location of Beaumont to Adelaide, a rapidly developing settlement at the time, made {{land in the}} area extremely expensive. Although Adelaide as a new settlement was prospering during the mid-19th century, still <b>very</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> could afford the exclusivity of Beaumont.|$|E
5|$|No tornado watches or {{warnings}} {{were issued}} {{before the storm}} struck. This was later determined to be because of missing atmospheric sounding data, {{as well as an}} incorrect assessment of the height of the tropopause, which led to an underestimation of the strength of the thunderstorm which produced the tornado. Although a severe thunderstorm warning was issued at 2:57 pm, <b>very</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> received the warnings in time.|$|E
5|$|While Jenner was alive, <b>very</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> knew of him, and {{the effects}} of his evangelism were largely unrecognised. After his death, however, stories about his evangelism {{circulated}} widely. Stories of his evangelistic activities generated a largely oral tradition, and elements of some stories contradicted others. Many storytellers said that Jenner was small in stature and that he had white hair; this description is contradicted by interviews with family members.|$|E
50|$|Thus his exact {{profession}} is uncertain, {{but he is}} notable {{as one of the}} <b>very</b> <b>few</b> professional <b>people</b> who were thought worthy enough to be mentioned in the extant Gaelic-Irish annals.|$|R

50|$|The main {{occupation}} of this village is agriculture, especially mango, paddy, sugar cane, banana, cotton, and coconut. The majority of this village's people are depending upon agricultural sector. <b>Very</b> <b>few</b> countable <b>people</b> are government employees.|$|R
5|$|In 1885 Farsari had a daughter, Kiku, by a Japanese {{woman whom}} {{he may not}} have married. He {{described}} himself as living like a misanthrope, associating with <b>very</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> outside of business, and his correspondence indicates that he increasingly hoped to return to Italy. He tried to regain the Italian citizenship lost when he emigrated to the United States, and he even hoped to be made a cavaliere and thereby join the Italian aristocracy. His success in these endeavours is not clear. Nevertheless, in April 1890 he and his daughter left Japan for Italy. On 7 February 1898 Farsari died in his family home in Vicenza.|$|E
5|$|Two {{thirds of}} people with Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} have experienced an infection {{before the onset of}} the condition. Most commonly these are episodes of gastroenteritis or a respiratory tract infection. In many cases, the exact nature of the infection can be confirmed. Approximately 30% of cases are provoked by Campylobacter jejuni bacteria, which cause diarrhea. A further 10% are attributable to cytomegalovirus (CMV, HHV-5). Despite this, only <b>very</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> with Campylobacter or CMV infections develop Guillain–Barré syndrome (0.25–0.65 per 1000 and 0.6–2.2 per 1000 episodes, respectively). The strain of Campylobacter involved may determine the risk of GBS; different forms of the bacteria have different lipopolysaccharides on their surface, and some may induce illness (see below) while others will not.|$|E
5|$|At the time, <b>very</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> in Wales {{had seen}} an opera, {{and they had}} no idea what it was like. The opera {{programmes}} provided explanations, especially that the singers would wear costumes but would not be acting. Those who were members of Welsh nonconformist churches needed reassurance {{that this was not a}} theatrical performance, as acting and theatres were held in as much contempt as taverns. Parry was raised in the nonconformist Annibynwyr Chapel and adhered to the tenets of his faith for his entire life. The majority of participants in the first performance of Blodwen were music students of Parry; his two older sons were also part of the production, playing piano and harmonium. Before the performance, Parry spoke to the audience. He repeated what had been printed in the programmes: that the participants were not acting and explained to those gathered what an opera was. Despite this, there were some clergymen who were not pleased.|$|E
50|$|The program {{featured}} a magazine-type format with various subjects and guests. According to some sources, as the series aired {{during the early}} days of live television, <b>very</b> <b>few</b> famous <b>people</b> agreed to appear on the series.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the station}} is {{extremely}} busy at peak times, the flow is <b>very</b> one-sided. <b>Few</b> <b>people</b> enter the station when the majority are exiting, and vice versa; and when the four lifts are full when travelling in one direction, they often return with <b>few</b> <b>people</b> in them.|$|R
5000|$|Dan Jacobson {{wrote that}} Wheldon [...] "had {{a gift for}} friendship"; Melvyn Bragg used {{precisely}} the same words, adding that [...] "she {{was one of the}} <b>very</b> <b>few</b> clever <b>people</b> who was also good". Norman Podhoretz wrote: [...] "I have known a <b>few</b> <b>people</b> of genius... but of them all, she was the most luminous." ...|$|R

25|$|Independent {{stores will}} close, leading to massive job losses. Walmart employs <b>very</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> in the United States.

25|$|Huff was {{not well}} known in Seattle's rave scene. <b>Very</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> in the scene knew him or interacted with him.

50|$|In {{government}} report from 2005, {{the number of}} people speaking Kven in Norway is estimated to be between 2,000 and 8,000, depending on the criteria used. However, there are <b>very</b> <b>few</b> young <b>people</b> who speak it, making it an endangered language.|$|R
50|$|Due to the {{prevalence}} of English {{as a second language}} among the Japanese people, the lack of influence of the Dutch language, the Japanese companies sponsoring the Japanese school, and the temporary nature of the Japanese presence, <b>very</b> <b>few</b> Japanese <b>people</b> attend Dutch-language government schools.|$|R
25|$|She {{also had}} a talent for photography: she left an {{intriguing}} photographic archive from the years she spent living in Moscow during the 1930s and 40s. The archive is the more remarkable because it concerns a time and places where, for both economic and political reasons, <b>very</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> would have had access to photographic equipment.|$|E
25|$|While in the past, the {{majority}} of jumpers and other Aran garments were knitted by hand, today {{the majority}} of items for sale in Ireland and elsewhere are either machine knit or produced on a hand loom. There are <b>very</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> still knitting jumpers by hand on a commercial basis but hand knit jumpers are still available at local craft initiatives.|$|E
25|$|Sanctions {{required}} under H.R. 4587 would probably {{increase the number}} of people who would be denied a visa by the United States Secretary of State. Most visa fees are retained by the department and spent without further appropriation, but some fees are deposited in the Treasury as revenues. CBO estimates that implementing those sanction provisions would affect <b>very</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> and, thus, have an insignificant budgetary effect.|$|E

25|$|Both men {{and women}} were hired for the arts {{programs}} (such as music, theater and writing). The Social Security program was designed to help retired workers and widows, but did not include domestic workers, farmers or farm laborers, the jobs most often held by blacks. Social Security however was not a relief program and it was not designed for short-term needs, as <b>very</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> received benefits before 1942.|$|E
25|$|If a {{web page}} is not {{listed in the}} first pages of any search, the odds of someone finding it diminishes greatly (especially if there is other {{competition}} on the first page). <b>Very</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> go past the first page, and the percentage that go to subsequent pages is substantially lower.

25|$|Tolstoy caused much {{controversy}} with his scathing remarks aimed at contemporary government officials (Alexander Timashev, Vladimir Butkov, Ivan Veillot) whom he – {{a supporter of}} the monarch – considered real enemies of the State.
