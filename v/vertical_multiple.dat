40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{conductance}} probe with <b>vertical</b> <b>multiple</b> electrode array (VMEA), {{which can be}} used in oil-in-water two-phase pipe flow to measure the water volume fraction and axial velocity. The electrodes are flush mounted axially on the inside wall of an insulating duct. Using finite element analysis method, the evaluating indicators of uniform degree spatial sensitivity and information volume were used to investigate the performance of the VMEA. The optimized VMEA has enhanced spatial sensitivity and capability of obtaining the distributed information from two-phase flow. Due to the significant difference of conductance between oil and water, the VMEA {{can also be used to}} measure gas-liquid and liquid-solid two-phase flow with conductive continuous phase. The evaluating indicators used in this paper can be used extensively to investigate other types of conductive probe...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the static}} and seismic {{performance}} of some short span reinforced concrete arch bridges, {{before and after}} strengthening interventions, are evaluated. To verify whether retrofit strategies for the considered arch bridges, which were designed for resisting under permanent and service actions, were adequate for earthquake resistance, seismic analyses of the as-built model of the structures have been undertaken. To account for multiple input effects on arches, induced by out-of-phase motions at foundation levels as well as different boundary conditions at structural supports, the seismic response of the structures under correlated horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>multiple</b> excitations is calculated. The effects on arch bridges of conventionally used uniform input and partially correlated multiple inputs with phase shifts are compared. In all cases, the results are discussed with particular reference {{to the influence of}} structural configuration, secondary systems, cross-section thickness of the arch, and retrofit interventions...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss {{strategies}} concerning the implementation of an agent-based simulation of complex phenomena. The model we consider accounts for population decomposition and interaction in industrial districts. The approach we follow is twofold: on one hand, we implement progressively more complex models using different approaches (<b>vertical</b> <b>multiple</b> implementations); on the other hand, we replicate the agent-based simulation with different implementations using jESOF, JAS and plain C++ (horizontal multiple implementations). By using both different implementation approaches and a multiple implementation strategy, we highlight the benefits that arise when the same model is implemented on radically different simulation environments, comparing the advantages of multiple modeling implementations. Our findings provide some important suggestions in terms of model validation, showing how models of complex systems tend to be extremely sensitive to implementation details. Finally we point out how statistical techniques may be necessary when comparing different platform implementations of a single model.

40|$|Based on the {{assumption}} that the fundamental modes of the fluid transfer between subchannels are turbulent mixing, void drift and diversion crossflow in a developing (hydrodynamic nonequilibrium) two-phase flow, we have examined whether the following treatment is applicable or not, i. e., whether the turbulent mixing rate in such a flow can be considered to be equal to the rate in the equilibrium state that the flow will attain. In order to obtain the data needed for the examination, experiments were performed for hydrodynamic nonequilibrium air-water churn flows without pressure differential between the subchannels, using simple <b>vertical</b> <b>multiple</b> channels consisting of two circular subchannels. Data on tracer concentration distribution along the channel axis were obtained for both gas and liquid phases. The analysis of the data showed that {{the assumption}} and the treatment mentioned above are valid for all nonequilibrium flows tested. Furthermore, it has been clarified that the effect of turbulent mixing on tracer mass exchanges between the subchannels is more dominant than that of void drift...|$|E

To investigate seasonal {{variations in the}} flux of radiolarians in relation to sea ice and water masses, a time-series sediment trap system was moored at Station NAP (75 ° 00 ´ N, 162 ° 00 ´ W; bottom depth 1975 m) in the western Arctic Ocean during October 2010 –September 2012. The radiolarian flux was comparable {{to that in the}} North Pacific Ocean. Amphimelissa setosa was dominant during the season with open water {{as well as at the}} beginning and end of the seasons with sea-ice cover. During the sea-ice-cover season, however, oligotrophic and cold-water-tolerant actinommids were dominant, productivity of Radiolaria was lower, and species diversity was greater. These suggest that the dynamics of sea ice are a major factor affecting the productivity, distribution, and composition of the radiolarian fauna...|$|E
40|$|The well {{patterns}} and pattern types of well placement {{issue in a}} productive formation is {{an important aspect of}} the effective field development. The problem solution is impossible on the intuitive level due to the reservoir inhomogeneity. At present the well pattern is accepted to be located basing on the famous criteria, specialist experience and hydrodynamical simulation on a reservoir model. The designer should analyze many field development variants with different well spacing during limited time interval. The adjustment of large-scale multiwell field-development projects is challenging because the number of adjustment variables {{and the size of the}} search space can become excessive. This difficulty can be circumvented by considering well {{patterns and}} then optimizing parameters associated with pattern type and geometry. In this paper, we introduce a new framework for accomplishing this type of adjustment for vertical two or three reservoirs. The development of <b>vertical</b> <b>multiple</b> reservoirs were usually by a separate well pattern for every reservoir, or through reservoir-by-reservoir from bottom to top by only one well pattern. A separate well pattern for every reservoir requires drilling many more wells and higher investment costs, while development through reservoir-by-reservoir from bottom to top by one well pattern made oil recovery rate and development efficiency very low and uneconomic. Consideration on fully developing every reservoir well efficiently, firstly, an inverted-nine well pattern was designed for every reservoir and the well space was L (L was defined as an optimal well space for respective reservoir) and the distance between adjacent well patterns was L. Secondly, all wells were drilled to the bottom of the lowest reservoir. Thirdly, when average water-cut of producers in every two well patterns was greater than 80 %, the two well patterns interchanged reservoirs. Finally, when all reservoir interchange was completed, every reservoir was developed by the new equivalent infilled well pattern with well space of L. The adjustment strategy made the required number of drilling wells in the whole field can be reduced by 50 % and achieved better development effect. This strategy was put into practice on North Buzachi oil field in Kazakhstan and average oil rate of single well was increased by 20 %, oil recovery rate has an increment by 12 percent, the recovery factor was increased by 6. 7 %, economic profit is 1. 8 times that of one separate well pattern for every reservoir, the effect was perfect. This work analyzed the performance of this new strategy of well pattern design and adjustment to effectively develop <b>vertical</b> <b>multiple</b> series of reservoirs and the methods to determine the reasonable time of two well patterns interchanging reservoirs through simulation study and current application effects...|$|E

Who were the weavers, what materials and methods did they use in weaving and of what significance are the blankets today? The initial phase consisted of locating a source of blankets and making friends with an Indian who had access to the source. An analysis sheet was prepared in order to record the history of each blanket, the method of construction and the interpretation or descrip-tion of pattern designs. Slides were taken of all available blankets. It soon became apparent that most of the weaving was done by Mary Hunt, a Tlingit wQman who lived amongst the Kwakiuti. people of Fort Rupert. She developed an identifiable, atypical Chilkat blanket that is a Kwakiutl version of the Chilkat blanket.

40|$|Fine-scale {{vertical}} distribution patterns of Neocalanus flemingeri, Neocalanus cristatus, Eucalanus bungii and Metridia pacifica were studied by stratified sampling (9 strata between 0 and 1000 m) with a <b>vertical</b> <b>multiple</b> plankton sampler (VMPS) every 3 h for 24 h during 21 - 22 March 2005 in the Oyashio region. Most C 1 -C 5 stages of N. flemingeri and N. cristatus {{occurred in the}} 30 - 90 m and 70 - 200 m strata, respectively, both day and night. Irrespective of day and night, C 3 -C 6 E. bungii were distributed broadly in the 200 - 430 m stratum (C 5 inhabiting the shallowest layer). Thus, these three copepods exhibited vertical partitioning of their habitats in the upper layers. The C 1 -C 6 of M. pacifica were distributed broadly from 140 to 400 m during daytime and migrated up to the 100 - 180 m layer at night (except for non-migrant C 1 and C 6 males). The within-species zonation of copepodid stages was less marked, but older stages tended to occupy deeper zones (N. flemingeri, N. cristatus and M. pacifica) or shallower zones (E. bungii). Gut content analyses of N. flemingeri and N. cristatus revealed the predominance of diatoms in both species, but the proportion of broken cells was greater in the deep-dwelling N. cristatus than in the shallow-dwelling N. flemingeri, suggesting the importance of sinking phytoplankton aggregates as food source for the former species...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} vertical {{changes in}} the abundance, biomass, and community structure of copepods and their effect on material flux, stratified samples were collected at 15 discrete depths between 0 and 3, 000 m with a fine mesh size (60 μm) <b>Vertical</b> <b>Multiple</b> Plankton Sampler in the southern Bering Sea and northern North Pacific on 14 and 16 June 2006. Both copepod abundance and biomass decreased with increasing depth, and both decreases were described well with a power model. A total of 72 calanoid copepod species belonging to 34 genera and 15 families were identified in the Bering Sea and 63 species belonging to 32 genera and 13 families were identified in the northern North Pacific. At both stations, the copepod communities comprised five groups that had distinct vertical distribution patterns. The groups at 500 - 1, 500 m were adapted to the oxygen minimum zone, and copepod carcasses outnumbered living specimens at 500 - 750 m in the northern North Pacific and at 750 - 1, 000 m in the Bering Sea. Oxygen levels were very low in the minimum zone in both regions, so the occurrence of a specialized community and the abundance of carcasses {{are considered to be}} a special characteristics at these depth. Based on metabolic rates estimated from an empirical equation, copepods were estimated to consume 20 ± 13 % (mean±sd) of the particle organic carbon flux throughout the water column in the Bering Sea and 32 ± 19 % of the flux in the northern North Pacific. The feeding impact of copepods was estimated to be greatest at 0 - 100 m. As the fate of POC flux, heterotrophic bacteria was estimated to be important at 100 - 1, 000 m, while most of them were considered to be directly sinking a t 1, 000 - 3, 000 m...|$|E
