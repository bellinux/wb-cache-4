40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} how the degree of oligomerization of ellagitannins (ET) influences their ability to alter ruminal fermentation. Dimeric to heptameric ET were isolated from rosebay willowherb (Epilobium angustifolium) flowers and purified. Ellagitannins were tested in vitro on a mixture of grass silage and buffered rumen fluid. Total gas production was measured in real time using an automated pressure evaluation system. Methane production was monitored at regular interval by gas chromatography for 72 h. The effect of ET was evaluated on 2 sources of rumen fluid using a randomized block design. Ammonia nitrogen, <b>volatile</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> concentration, and pH were measured at the end of the experiment. Results show that oligomeric ET decreased gas production and total <b>volatile</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> concentration proportionally to their degree of oligomerization. Methane production was also decreased by all the tested compounds and dimer was less effective than the larger ET, which showed similar levels of activity. Additionally, willowherb’s oligomeric ET decreased ammonia-nitrogen and branched-chain <b>volatile</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> concentrations, thus indicating reduced protein degradation by ruminal bacteria. This effect showed a quadratic relationship with the degree of oligomerization and was maximal with the tetramer. In conclusion, this study shows that the degree of oligomerization of ET has more than a simple linear effect on fermentation parameters in vitro. Large oligomers, in fact, have more detrimental effects on <b>volatile</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> and gas production than small ones, while being similarly effective at inhibiting methane production...|$|R

Each of the 5 diets was fed to 4 weaner pigs and microbial characteristics of their ileal chyme and faeces were assessed. The NDO-pigs had lower ileal pH than the control pigs. Dietary NDO did not affect the ileal <b>volatile</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> concentration, though FOS-pigs had a higher concentration of lactic acid and relatively more iso-valeric acid and less acetic acid than TOS-pigs. The NDO-pigs had lower ileal aerobic bacterial counts than the control pigs, whilst the FOS-pigs had a larger ileal anaerobic bacterial counts than the TOS-pigs. The NDO-pigs had an higher faecal pH and their faecal <b>volatile</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> pool contained relatively more iso-butyric acid and iso-valeric acid than the control pigs. The TOS-pigs tended to have higher faecal anaerobic bacterial counts and had a smaller concentration of faecal <b>volatile</b> <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> than the FOS-pigs. We concluded that whilst effects at the faecal level may have been partly due to a reduced intake of cellulose, dietary NDO can exert precaecal prebiotic effects in weaner pigs...|$|R

The microbes inside the rumen also synthesize amino acids from non-protein nitrogenous sources, such as urea and ammonia.

These cells are then partially digested in the small intestines, allowing cattle to gain a high-quality protein source. These features allow cattle to thrive on grasses and other tough vegetation.|$|E
