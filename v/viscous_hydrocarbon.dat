5000|$|Production, transportation, and {{refining}} of {{heavy crude oil}} present special challenges compared to light crude oil. Generally, a diluent is added at regular distances in a pipeline carrying heavy crude to facilitate its flow. Dilbit (diluted bitumen) {{is a means of}} transporting highly <b>viscous</b> <b>hydrocarbon.</b> Per the Alberta Oil Sands Bitumen Valuation Methodology, [...] "Dilbit Blends" [...] means [...] "Blends made from heavy crudes and/or bitumens and a diluent usually condensate, for the purpose of meeting pipeline viscosity and density specifications, where the density of the diluent included in the blend is less than 800 kg/m3." ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{results of}} {{two-dimensional}} mathematical modeling {{of heat and}} mass transfer in a highly <b>viscous</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> liquid by inductive and radio-frequency (RF) electromagnetic (EM) heating are presented. The model {{takes into account the}} dependence of the liquid's viscosity and thermal conductivity on the temperature and also the presence of thermal convection effects. It is shown that the occurrence of volumetric heat sources inside the liquid caused by EM radiation yields an intensive deep heating as compared with inductive heating. Numerical calculations show that, in both these cases, the single vortex flow structure is formed in the whole volume of the liquid. However, RF EM heating provides a more homogeneous distribution of heat in the medium and requires three-fold less power consumption in comparison with induction heating...|$|E
40|$|A linear {{stability}} {{analysis is}} performed {{for a black}} lipid membrane. The hydrodynamic model consists of a <b>viscous</b> <b>hydrocarbon</b> film sandwiched between two aqueous phases. Attractive forces (van der Waals and electrical) and repulsive forces (sleric) are expressed as body forces in the equations of fluid motion in the three phases. The steric repulsion due to overlap of the hydrocarbon chains of the lipids at small film thicknesses is described via an exponentially decaying interaction potential. The dispersion equation displays two modes of vibrations: the bending mode with the two Film surfaces transversely in phase, and the squeezing mode with the two surfaces 180 ° out of phase. For symmetrical films, these two modes are uncoupled, and the squeezing mode (with thickness variations) is stabilized by the repulsive interactions. For nonsymmetrical films (different surface tensions, surface charges, etc.). these two modes are coupled and the asymmetry induces a shift of the marginal stability curve to shorter wavelengths. © 1983.

50|$|Tar is a {{dark brown}} or black <b>viscous</b> liquid of <b>hydrocarbons</b> and free carbon, {{obtained}} {{from a wide variety}} of organic materials through destructive distillation. Tar can be produced from coal, wood, petroleum, or peat.Production and trade in pine-derived tar was a major contributor in the economies of Northern Europe and Colonial America. Its main use was in preserving wooden sailing vessels against rot. The largest user was the Royal Navy. Demand for tar declined with the advent of iron and steel ships.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of research undertaken into the transport behaviour of coal carbonisation by-products (coal tar and creosote) in alluvial deposits in the Severn Estuary, UK. Coal tar, and its derivative creosote, comprise <b>viscous</b> multi-component <b>hydrocarbon</b> liquids with a low aqueous solubility. A number of former industrial sites located on the Severn Estuary have been investigated. The geology beneath these sites comprises deposits of alluvial clay in excess of 10 m thickness with subordinate peat bands. These deposits are conventionally assumed to be of low permeability. However, hydrocarbon contamination has been observed within and beneath the clay strata. Characterisation of alluvial deposits found the clay component to be dominated by silicate mineralogy. The alluvial clay typically has a low organic carbon component whilst subordinate peat horizons contains much higher levels of organic carbon. Detailed logging of alluvial soils identified vertical to sub-vertical fossil root structures penetrating the soil matrix. This network of macro-pores provides a preferential transport pathway for Dense Non-Aqueous Phase Liquids (DNAPLs). Organic Carbon Partition Coefficents (Koc) were derived for the polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon phenanthrene, which is a principal component in coal tar and creosote, to alluvial clay and peat. The Koc values were consistent with those reported by other authors for natural soil organic carbon. In the absence of water, creosote is wetting of alluvial clay, The soil matrix of alluvial clay has a low permeability and the fossil pore structures present a significantly higher permeability pathway. Soil sampling and preparation can significantly disturb the root structures in the soft alluvial deposits, leading to misleading geotechnical parameters...|$|R
40|$|The article {{presents}} the application {{results of the}} method of acoustic emission for quantitative assessment {{of the process of}} coating of porous textile materials. Under the influence of capillary pressure the wetting part of a viscous liquid can be absorbed by porous materials of clothes and also it can change its properties. To assess the adequacy of the use of the alternative method of acoustic emission in the assigned task the experimental studies based on the acoustic emission technique and the weight method were carried out. In the basis of the experimental equipment a special laboratory complex was used, which has a multichannel system for recording acoustic signals while monitoring mass variations of the samples in-parallel. On the basis of this method a number of experimental studies of modern textiles of different nature and structure was carried out, which allowed assessing the changes in their structure when interacting with <b>viscous</b> fractions of <b>hydrocarbon</b> compounds and establishing a connection with variation of their functional properties for the application conditions in the protective clothes for industrial purpose...|$|R
2500|$|The crude bitumen {{contained}} in the Canadian oil sands is described by the National Energy Board of Canada as [...] "a highly <b>viscous</b> mixture of <b>hydrocarbons</b> heavier than pentanes which, in its natural state, is not usually recoverable at a commercial rate through a well because it is too thick to flow." [...] Crude bitumen is a thick, sticky form of crude oil, so heavy and viscous (thick) {{that it will not}} flow unless heated or diluted with lighter hydrocarbons such as light crude oil or natural-gas condensate. At room temperature, it is much like cold molasses. [...] The World Energy Council (WEC) defines natural bitumen as [...] "oil having a viscosity greater than 10,000centipoise under reservoir conditions and an API gravity of less than 10° API". [...] The Orinoco Belt in Venezuela is sometimes described as oil sands, but these deposits are non-bituminous, falling instead into the category of heavy or extra-heavy oil due to their lower viscosity. [...] Natural bitumen and extra-heavy oil differ in the degree by which they have been degraded from the original conventional oils by bacteria. According to the WEC, extra-heavy oil has [...] "a gravity of less than 10° API and a reservoir viscosity of no more than 10,000centipoise".|$|R
30|$|Light {{natural gas}} {{condensate}} (pentane plus or C 5 +) is a low-density and less <b>viscous</b> mixture of <b>hydrocarbon</b> liquids, {{which is a}} by-product of natural gas processing. This condensate recovered from natural gas {{has been used to}} dilute heavy crude oil and bitumen in Canadian and Venezuelan oil fields in order to enhance their transport using pipeline. Though the viscosity of heavy crude oil and bitumen is reduced significantly on blending with the condensate, asphaltenes precipitation, segregation and aggregation cause instability during transportation and storage (Shigemoto et al. 2006). This is because asphaltenes present in the heavy crude oil are insoluble in alkanes such as n-pentane and heptanes, as the condensates are known to be paraffin-rich light oil. Additionally, asphaltenes have the tendency to interact and aggregate. The viscosity of the oil–condensate blended mixture depends on the properties of the heavy crude oil or bitumen, condensate, the dilution rate, heavy oil–condensate ratio and also the operating temperature. The limitations to the use of condensates includes: its availability depends on natural gas demand (Guevara et al. 1998); due to the growing production of heavy crude oil and bitumen, the production of condensate is not sufficient to sustain the demand for thinner; most of its components are not good solvents for asphaltenes and precipitation may arise; instability during storage.|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of overpressure observed in petroleum bearing basins {{must be understood}} in terms of generation and distribution in order to build up a fluid flow history. Overpressure influences expulsion and migration of hydrocarbons from source rocks. This thesis details and interprets observations and results of a case study into aspects of overpressure distribution, fluid flow patterns, causative mechanisms, palaeo- pressure and subsequent pressure history, the surface expression of overpressure and the mechanical strength relationships of sealing rocks. One of the principle study areas was the Alwyn field in the Northern North Sea. The overpressure distribution over the field area was seen not to be uniform. Organic geochemical data indicated that the source of reservoired hydrocarbons and associated fluids was the Viking Graben depocentre. Fluid inclusion data recorded in specific diagenetic mineral phases interpreted fluid flow conditions of hydrocarbons into the reservoir under normal pressures but elevated temperatures. When combined with computer generated pressure models, these diagenetic events were exclusive of modelled overpressure periods. The greatest contribution of overpressure was modelled as being a result of compaction disequilibrium but withalikely contribution from the thermal cracking of oil to gas which would also account for the present day distribution of overpressure across the Alwyn field area. The Uinta Basin with its relatively simple burial and thermal history allowed the production of a model. : involving a temporal history of overpressure generation, fracture development, regional tectonism, hydrocarbon maturation and expulsion and the process of Gilsonite emplacement. It is inferred that initial hydraulically induced fracturing of the Green River and overlying formations was a result of combined overpressure due to disequilibrium and regional extension with a possible contribution from the maturation of the source rock. This study recognised that the hydrocarbon was emplaced under a high pressure regime with evidence provide. by the existence of forcibly injected hydrocarbon sills. Hydrocarbons fractionated in the pre-existing vertical fractures to leave residual highly <b>viscous</b> and immobile <b>hydrocarbons</b> in veins seen at the present day. The third major component of this study detailed results from an assessment of the mechanical capacity of sealing rocks with respect to specific composition and mineralogy. It was found that increasing organic carbon decreased the compressive strength of the tested shale specimens. This relationship was interpreted as a possible result of the interaction of alkaline fluids to produce a dispersant which acts to reduce the cohesion of the organic rich shale...|$|R
