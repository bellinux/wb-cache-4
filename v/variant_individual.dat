5000|$|People {{are drawn}} to {{capitalism}} {{with the promise of}} choice, but as Galeano points out, those who are allowed to actually make those choices are limited often by money, gender, and race."This world, which puts on a banquet for all, then slams the door in the noses of so many, is simultaneously equalizing and unequal: equalizing in the ideas and habits it imposes and unequal in the opportunities it offers". Some of the ideas that Galeano puts forward as equalized are of what systems to reward and what to fear. For example, failure is condemned while injustices are often overlooked as a mere fact of life. Fear has taught us to look towards furthering security instead of justice. For example, Galeano references the relief that most feel every time a criminal is killed, therefore choosing security over justice. Furthermore, Galeano points out that the idea of [...] "equalization" [...] works against the beauty of <b>variant</b> <b>individual</b> identities and cultural identities, molding numerous people into a common identity that fits better with today's capitalistic society. As globalization continues, the difference between {{the rich and the poor}} of the world just keeps growing, and with this increased polarization has come a new vocabulary of degradation to describe class and racial differences.|$|E

40|$|Through the {{application}} of a specific oxidase stain to results of starch gel electrophoresis of human serum, three different electrophoretic forms of ceruloplasmin—denoted CpA (fast), CpB (intermediate), and CpC (slow) —have been defined. The electrophoretic differences are small and were first recognized through a rare <b>variant</b> <b>individual</b> who had only the fast and slow forms. Five phenotypes displaying different combinations of the three electrophoretic forms have been defined in American Negroes; these are called CpA, CpAB, CpB, CpAC, and CpBC. Twin, family, and population studies have yielded evidence indicating that the A and B electrophoretic forms are controlled by a pair of autosomal codominant alleles, designated Cp A and Cp B, and suggesting that the C form may be determined by a third allele, Cp C, at the same locus. The variants constitute a genetic polymorphism in American Negroes, but occur only rarely in Caucasians...|$|E

Future arrival management is expected to feature increasing interaction and data exchange between the aircraft and ground systems.

40|$|The Author(s) 2015. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract We study {{the dynamics of}} a predator–prey system where predators fight for captured prey besides searching for and handling (and digestion) of the prey. Fighting for prey is modelled by a continuous time hawk–dove game dynamics where the gain depends {{on the amount of}} disputed prey while the costs for fighting is constant per fighting event. The strategy of the predator-population is quantified by a trait being the proportion of the number of predator-individuals playing hawk tactics. The dynamics of the trait is described by twomodels of adaptation: the replicator dynamics (RD) and the adaptive dynamics (AD). In the RD-approach a <b>variant</b> <b>individual</b> with an adapted trait value changes the population’s strategy, and consequently its trait value, only when its payoff is larger than the population average.

The main aim is to compare the consequences of the two adaptation models. In an equilibrium predator–prey system this will lead to convergence to a neutral singular strategy, while in the oscillatory system to a continuous singular strategy where in this endpoint the resident population is not invasible by any variant population. In equilibrium (low prey carrying capacity) RD and AD-approach give the same results, however not always in a periodically oscillating system (high prey carrying-capacity) where the trait is density-dependent. For low costs the predator population is monomorphic (only hawks) while for high costs dimorphic (hawks and doves). These results illustrate that intra-specific trait dynamics matters in predator–prey dynamics...|$|E

40|$|Copy number {{variations}} (CNVs), which cover many functional genes, {{are associated}} with complex diseases, phenotypic diversity and traits that are economically important to raising chickens. The sex-determining region Y-box 6 (Sox 6) {{plays a key role}} in fast-twitch muscle fiber differentiation of zebrafish and mice, but it is still unknown whether SOX 6 plays a role in chicken skeletal muscle development. We identified two copy number polymorphisms (CNPs) which were significantly related to different traits on the genome level in chickens by AccuCopy® and CNVplex® analyses. Notably, five white recessive rock (CN = 1, CN = 3) <b>variant</b> <b>individuals</b> and two Xinghua (CN = 3) <b>variant</b> <b>individuals</b> contain a CNP 13 (chromosome 5 : 10, 500, 294 – 10, 675, 531) which overlaps with SOX 6. There is a disordered region in SOX 6 proteins 265 – 579 aa coded by a partial CNV overlapping region. A quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that the expression level of SOX 6 mRNA was positively associated with CNV and highly expressed during the skeletal muscle cell differentiation in chickens. After the knockdown of the SOX 6, the expression levels of IGFIR 1, MYF 6, SOX 9, SHOX and CCND 1 were significantly down-regulated. All of them directly linked to muscle development. These results suggest that the number of CNVs in the CNP 13 is positively associated with the expression level of SOX 6, which promotes the proliferation and differentiation of skeletal muscle cells by up-regulating the expression levels of the muscle-growth-related genes in chickens as in other animal species...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{technique}} for detecting electrophoretic and quantitative variants of group-specific component (Gc) proteins is described. The technique, in vitro labeling with radioactive vitamin D followed by {{polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis}} and autoradiography (PAGE autoradiography), permits sensitive, high resolution detection of Gc variants by virtue of a physiologically significant property: the ability of Gc to bind vitamin D and 25 -hydroxyvitamin D. Using this procedure, anodal Gc variants, with mobility similar to Gc Aborigine and Gc Eskimo, were observed in Chinese, Japanese, African Pygmies, and American Blacks. The gene frequency of these variants ranges from 2. 6 % to 15 %; they were not previously known to be polymorphic in these populations. In addition to qualitative <b>variants,</b> <b>individual</b> variation in Gc band density ratios is documented and discussed.
