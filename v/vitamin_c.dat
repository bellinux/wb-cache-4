5|$|Humans must consume {{vitamins}} periodically {{but with}} differing schedules, to avoid deficiency.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} whether a combined supplementation of <b>vitamins</b> <b>C</b> and E was able to modify the oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL), soluble form of CD 36 (sCD 36), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1 (sVCAM- 1), and nitrite/nitrate oxide (NOx) levels in pediatric nephrotic syndrome (NS) cases. The study included 36 children with NS. The patients were randomly allocated to either the treatment group or the placebo group (18 children each). The treatment group received a combined supplementation of <b>vitamins</b> <b>C</b> and E. The serum levels of ox-LDL, sCD 36, and sVCAM- 1 were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The serum levels of NOx were assayed by colorimetric assay. Results showed that the levels of ox-LDL, sVCAM- 1, and NOx were decreased after treatment with a combined supplementation of <b>vitamins</b> <b>C</b> and E, {{but there was no}} statistical difference (p >  0. 05). After treatment, there was an increase in the level of sCD 36 in both groups, although this was not significantly different (p >  0. 05). The level of ox-LDL was significantly lower in the remission-idiopathic NS (remission-INS) group compared with the nonremission-INS group (p <  0. 05). The levels of ox-LDL and sVCAM- 1 were significantly lower in the remission-treated group than in the nonremission-treated group (p <  0. 05). In conclusion, the combined supplementation of <b>vitamins</b> <b>C</b> and E cannot modify the ox-LDL, sCD 36, sVCAM- 1, and NOx levels in children with INS. In remission cases, the combined supplementation of <b>vitamins</b> <b>C</b> and E reduces the ox-LDL and sVCAM- 1 levels...|$|R
5|$|Many lemurs {{that eat}} leaves {{tend to do}} so during times of fruit scarcity, {{sometimes}} suffering weight loss as a result. Most lemur species, including most of the smallest lemurs and excluding some of the indriids, predominantly eat fruit (frugivory) when available. Collectively, lemurs have been documented consuming fruit from at least 86native plant families and 15alien plant families. As with most tropical fruit eaters, the lemur diet is dominated by fruit from Ficus (fig) species. In many anthropoid primates, fruit is a primary source of <b>vitamin</b> <b>C,</b> but unlike anthropoid primates, lemurs (and all strepsirrhines) can synthesize their own <b>vitamin</b> <b>C.</b> Historically, captive lemur diets high in vitamin C-rich fruits have been thought to cause hemosiderosis, a type of iron overload disorder, since <b>vitamin</b> <b>C</b> increases iron absorption. Although lemurs in captivity {{have been shown to}} be prone to hemosiderosis, the frequency of the disease varies across institutions and may depend on the diet, husbandry protocols, and genetic stock. Assumptions about the problem need to be tested separately for each species. The ring-tailed lemur, for instance, seems to be less prone to the disorder than other lemur species.|$|E

5|$|Like humans, {{but unlike}} most other mammals, guinea pigs cannot {{synthesize}} their own <b>vitamin</b> <b>C</b> and must obtain this vital nutrient from food. If guinea pigs do not ingest enough <b>vitamin</b> <b>C,</b> they can suffer from potentially fatal scurvy. Guinea pigs require about 10mg of <b>vitamin</b> <b>C</b> daily (20mg if pregnant), {{which can be}} obtained through fresh, raw fruits and vegetables (such as broccoli, apple, cabbage, carrot, celery, and spinach) or through dietary supplements. Healthy diets for guinea pigs require a complex balance of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and hydrogen ions; adequate amounts of vitamins E, A, and D are also necessary. Imbalanced diets {{have been associated with}} muscular dystrophy, metastatic calcification, difficulties with pregnancy, vitamin deficiencies, and teeth problems. Guinea pigs tend to be fickle eaters when it comes to fresh fruits and vegetables, having learned early in life what is and is not appropriate to consume, and their habits are difficult to change after maturity. They do not respond well to sudden changes in diet; they may stop eating and starve rather than accept new food types. A constant supply of hay or other food is generally recommended, as guinea pigs feed continuously and may develop habits such as chewing on their own hair if food is not present. Because guinea pigs' teeth grow constantly, they routinely , lest their teeth become too large for their mouths, a common problem in rodents. Guinea pigs also chew on cloth, paper, plastic, and rubber.|$|E

40|$|Background: Concomitant supplementation of <b>vitamins</b> <b>C</b> and E during {{pregnancy}} has been reportedly associated with low birth weight, the premature rupture of membranes and fetal loss or perinatal death in women {{at risk for}} preeclampsia; however, the cause is unknown. We surmise that hypoxia-reoxygenation (HR) within the intervillous space due to abnormal placentation is the mechanism and hypothesize that concomitant administration of aforementioned vitamin antioxidants detrimentally affects trophoblast cells during HR. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using villous explants, concomitant administration of 50 mM of <b>vitamins</b> <b>C</b> and E was observed to reduce apoptotic and autophagic changes in the trophoblast layer at normoxia (8 % oxygen) but to cause more prominent apoptosis and autophagy during HR. Furthermore, increased levels of Bcl- 2 and Bcl-xL in association with {{a decrease in the}} autophagy-related protein LC 3 -II were noted in cytotrophoblastic cells treated with <b>vitamins</b> <b>C</b> and E under standard culture conditions. In contrast, vitamin treatment decreased Bcl- 2 and Bcl-xL as well as increased mitochondrial Bak and cytosolic LC 3 -II in cytotrophoblasts subjected to HR. Conclusions/Significance: Our results indicate that concomitant administration of <b>vitamins</b> <b>C</b> and E has differential effects on the changes of apoptosis, autophagy and the expression of Bcl- 2 family of proteins in the trophoblasts between normoxia and HR. These changes may probably lead to the impairment of placental function and suboptimal growth of th...|$|R
40|$|Extensive {{research}} {{within the}} past half-century has indicated that curcumin (diferuloylmethane), a yellow pigment in curry powder, exhibits anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and pro-apoptotic activities. We investigated whether the anti-pre-cancer activities assigned to curcumin are mediated through an anti-oxidant and DNA-protecting mechanism. Patients with oral leukoplakia, oral submucous fibrosis or lichen planus, and healthy individuals (n = 25 for each group) aged 17 - 50 years were selected. Salivary and serum oxidative markers such as malonaldehyde (MDA), 8 -hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8 -OHdG), <b>vitamins</b> <b>C</b> and E were measured {{just prior to the}} intake of curcumin, after one week of curcumin intake and following clinical cure of precancerous lesions. Serum and salivary <b>vitamins</b> <b>C</b> and E showed increases, while MDA and 8 -OHdG levels showed decreases in patients with oral leukoplakia, submucous fibrosis and lichen planus after intake of curcumin for all categories of precancerous lesions. The changes in these values were observed to be statistically significant after clinical cure of the disease (P < 0. 05). The five-point rating scale for pain, as well as lesion size in oral leukoplakia, submucous fibrosis and lichen planus, improved significantly (P < 0. 05). In addition, in submucous fibrosis, mouth opening (P < 0. 05) recovered significantly. In oral leukoplakia, submucous fibrosis and lichen planus, the levels of serum and salivary <b>vitamins</b> <b>C</b> and E increased significantly, while MDA and 8 -OHdG levels decreased after 131 (15), 211 (17), and 191 (18) days, respectively. Values for serum and salivary <b>vitamins</b> <b>C</b> and E showed a significant decrease in oral leukoplakia, submucous fibrosis and lichen planus, in contrast to healthy individuals, but increased significantly in all groups subsequent to curcumin administration after clinical cure of lesions. Based on these results, we can conclude that curcumin mediates its anti-pre-cancer activities by increasing levels of <b>vitamins</b> <b>C</b> and E, and preventing lipid peroxidation and DNA damage. status: publishe...|$|R
