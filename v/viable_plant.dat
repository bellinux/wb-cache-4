40|$|Oil palm protoplasts are {{suitable}} {{as a starting}} material {{for the production of}} oil palm plants with new traits using approaches such as somatic hybridization, but attempts to regenerate <b>viable</b> <b>plants</b> from protoplasts have failed thus far. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, the regeneration of <b>viable</b> <b>plants</b> from protoplasts isolated from cell suspension cultures. We achieved a protoplast yield of 1. 14 × 106 per gram fresh weight with a viability of 82 % by incubating the callus in a digestion solution comprising 2 % cellulase, 1 % pectinase, 0. 5 % cellulase onuzuka R 10, 0. 1 % pectolyase Y 23, 3 % KCl, 0. 5 % CaCl 2 and 3. 6 % mannitol. The regeneration of protoplasts into <b>viable</b> <b>plants</b> required media optimization, the inclusion of plant growth regulators and the correct culture technique. Microcalli derived from protoplasts were obtained by establishing agarose bead cultures using Y 3 A medium supplemented with 10 M naphthalene acetic acid, 2 M 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 2 M ind ole- 3 -butyric acid, 2 M gibberellic acid and 2 M 2 [...] dimethylallylaminopurine.

40|$|Somatic {{embryogenesis}} is {{an attractive}} method of vegetative propagation of conifers. However, in many species of conifers are still problems in growing high quality cotyledonary somatic embryos. This {{is the reason for}} low quantity of <b>viable</b> <b>plants.</b> Somatic embryogenesis is an integrated process consisting of several consecutive steps. The right timing of individual steps and appropriate in vitro environment is very important to complete the whole process of somatic embryogenesis successfully. However, in many conifers is still necessary to examine the correct procedures and to create better conditions to achieve successfully grown plants. The aim of this thesis was to study the development of somatic embryos of conifers during the maturation and conversion into <b>viable</b> <b>plants.</b> We focused on the prevalence of abnormal cotyledonary somatic embryos created at the end stage of maturation and whether these somatic embryos have the potential to develop into <b>viable</b> <b>plants.</b> It was further found that if cotyledonary somatic embryos develop in the stage of maturation in a certain way, then it can not be changed the appearance or structure of the somatic embryos, thus encouraging the formation of meristem from which it began to develop a plant. Furthermore, in this work we tested the ability of embryogenic lines of Norway spruce (Picea abies) and silver fir (Abies alba) to start the process of maturation after 3 years of maintenance culture on proliferation medium...|$|R

40|$|To introgress {{resistance}} to Rotylenchulus reniformis from the East African wild diploid species Gossypium longicalyx Hutch & Lee into upland cotton, crosses involving G. hirsutum as the recipient species, G. longicalyx as the donor species and several D genome species (G. thurberi, G. harknessii, G. davidsonii, G. armourianum, G. gossypoïdes, G. aridum, G. raimondii) as bridge species were made. Only the combination [(G. hirsutum x G. thurberi) x G. longicalyx] gave seeds (10 seeds from 34 crosses) that produced <b>viable</b> <b>plants</b> (9 plants). These hybrids were denoted as HTL. The use of SSR markers revealed the {{presence in the}} hybrid of G. hirsutum, G. thurberi and G. longicalyx specific alleles proving {{the success of the}} crosses. GISH analysis confirmed this result showing the presence of 13 G. longicalyx chromosomes among the 52 of the hybrid. Three HTL hybrid plants evaluated under controlled conditions following inoculation revealed a high level of {{resistance to}} R. reniformis equivalent to that of the diploid donor species. All HTL hybrid plants were self-sterile and photoperiodic. Backcrosses achieved using them as female parents gave seeds that produced <b>viable</b> <b>plants.</b> A total of 13 HTL BC 1 plants were tested for their resistance to R. reniformis. Among them, nine were resistant (5 highly resistant and 4 resistant) and four were susceptible.

This widespread issue has been noted by the scientific community, and has created much confusion among both amateur and professional horticulturists alike. While T. ulmifolia is similar in appearance, its chemical constituents and ethnobotanical uses are distinctly different. Mature stems of T. diffusa are woody, with small, grayed green leaves 13 to 16 mm long, 4.5 to 5.5 mm wide, obtuse at the apex, and strongly aromatic when crushed. T. ulmifolia is differentiated by herbaceous stems, larger blue-green leaves that are strongly dentate with a pointed apex, and only weakly aromatic.|$|E
50|$|In 1998, Mark Westoby {{proposed}} a plant ecology strategy scheme (PESS) to explain species distributions based on traits. The dynamic model incorporated a three axes trade-off among specific leaf area (SLA), canopy height at maturity, and seed mass. SLA {{is defined as}} the area per unit dry mass of mature leaves, developed in the fullest natural light of the species. These traits were selected for incorporation because of their trade-off functionality. Resource allocation to one trait is only possible by diverting resources from the others. Similarly to Grime’s C-S-R triangle, each gradient represents different strategic responses to the environment; variation in disturbance adaptation is represented by canopy height and seed mass (Grime’s R-axis), whereas SLA reflects variation in growth in response to stress (Grime’s C-S axis). The L-H-S strategy avoids the assumption that high disturbance, high stress environments lack <b>viable</b> <b>plant</b> strategies, unlike Grime's model. However, Westoby's model is at a disadvantage when predicting potential variation in plant strategies since the axes only include single variables, compared to Grime's multivariable axes.|$|E

Regenerants of six genotypes were established in the greenhouse. The regeneration response reflected the taxonomic subdivision of the species in that P. acutifolius var. acutifolius was responsive whereas var. tenuifolius was not. The 'regeneration competence' trait was present in both the wild and the domesticated gene pools.

50|$|The oldest carbon-14-dated seed {{that has}} grown into a <b>viable</b> <b>plant</b> was Silene stenophylla (narrow-leafed campion), an Arctic flower native to Siberia. Radiocarbon dating has {{confirmed}} an age of 31,800 ±300 years for the seeds. In 2007, more than 600,000 frozen mature and immature seeds were found buried in 70 squirrel hibernation burrows 38 m below the permafrost near the banks of the Kolyma River. Believed to have been buried by Arctic ground squirrels, the mature seeds had been damaged to prevent germination in the burrow, however, three of the immature seeds contained viable embryos. Scientists extracted the embryos and successfully germinated plants in vitro which grew, flowered and created viable seeds of their own. The shape of the flowers differed from that of modern S. stenophylla with the petals being longer and more widely spaced than modern versions of the plant. Seeds produced by the regenerated plants germinated at a 100% success rate, compared with 90% for modern plants. Calculations of the γ radiation dose accumulated by the seeds since burial gave a reading of 0.07 kGy, the highest maximal dose recorded for seeds that have remained viable.|$|E
5000|$|The G'Quan Eth is a {{flowering}} plant burned as a ceremonial incense by the Narn {{people during the}} ritual which ends [...] "The Days of G'Quan"; the flower being the very symbol of the G'Quan faith. The plant is described as being difficult to grow, expensive to transport (and even to own), but is nonetheless vital to the Narn ceremony. When {{the seeds of the}} plant are mixed with the right ratio of alcohol it allows [...] "whole new universes to open up" [...] because of its narcotic properties (although the Narn seem to look distastefully upon those who use the plant for such purposes). Although never seen on-camera, the plant serves as the plot-point of a sub-plot in the episode [...] "By Any Means Necessary" [...] in which Ambassador G'Kar must find a replacement for his upcoming ceremony after the original shipment is destroyed in a cargo docking accident. G'Kar's search leads him to Londo Mollari, who, having the only <b>viable</b> <b>plant</b> obtainable {{before it is too late}} for the ceremony, demands an exorbitant amount of money for it only to reveal to G'Kar that he has no intention of selling it and was only dangling the G'Quan Eth before him so as to vex him as vengeance for the Narn invasion of Ragesh 3, where his nephew was imprisoned and abused. G'Kar is finally able to obtain the flower after bringing the affair to the attention of Captain Sinclair, who informs Mollari that because of the flower's chemical properties it is considered a controlled substance by Earth law (with the exception of use in medical or religious practices), Sinclair must confiscate it. Mollari, however, willingly surrenders the flower to the Captain as he believes (like G'Kar) that it is too late for the ceremony. Sinclair, however, provides a loophole for G'Kar's ceremony; the ritual must be performed when the sunlight touches the G'Quan mountains—however, because sunlight also travels through space, the sunlight that touched down on the G'Quan mountains 10 years ago is still 12 hours away from reaching Babylon 5, and as the ritual pre-date's Narn space travel, G'Kar is allowed to use that traveling sunlight to complete his ritual after the Captain turns the G'Quan Eth over to him.|$|E

50|$|Like Chardonnay, Viognier has the {{potential}} to produce full-bodied wines with a lush, soft character. In contrast to Chardonnay, the Viognier varietal has more natural aromatics that include notes of peach, pears, violets and minerality.
