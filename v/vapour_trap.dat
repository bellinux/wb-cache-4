40|$|Graduation date: 1958 This {{investigation}} {{is a study}} of how the magnitude and energy distribution of the photoelectric current from the light emergent side of thin silver films varies with film thickness. The Fowler-Dubridge graphical analysis of the energy distribution of photoelectrons is {{used to determine the}} energy of the most energetic of the emitted photoelectrons, at O°K. The experimental phototube is of the concentric: sphere type. The silver film was deposited {{on the inside of the}} sphere to act as a collector for the photoelectrons. The tube was mounted on a vacuum system consisting of a mechanical pump, an oil diffusion pump and an oil <b>vapour</b> <b>trap.</b> During the investigation the tube was left on the pumps at a pressure of approximately 2 x 10 ⁻⁷mm. Hg. The photocurrent from the silver film was amplified with a Brown and Dubridge circuit using a FP- 54 electrometer tube. The film was irradiated by light from a mercury arc lamp and a Bausch and Lomb monochromator. The intensity of light transmitted through the silver film was monitored by an R. C. A. IP 28 electron multiplier phototube. In order to determine the thickness of the silver film a separate experiment was carried out to determine the per cent light transmission through a film of known thickness. The main investigation consisted of depositing a layer of silver on the quartz disc mounted in the center of the experimental tube, and measuring the percentage of transmitted light, of wavelength 2483 A, through the film. The emitted photocurrent was then measured as a function of the light intensity at the light emergent side of the silver film, and as a function of the retarding potential across the experimental phototube. The film was increased in nineteen steps to a maximum thickness of 255 A, and the above data was recorded for each film thickness. The magnitude of the photocurrent increased with film thickness up to about 40 A and was then relatively constant for thicker films. The analysis of the energy distribution of the photocurrent showed an increase of the maximum energy of emission with film thickness up to about 50 A. This increase in maximum energy may be due to a change in contact potential between the collector and the silver film or to a decrease in the work function of the silver film as the thickness increases. A decrease in the work function of the silver film, with increasing thickness, would explain the increase in the emitted photocurrent, with increasing film thickness...|$|E

40|$|The {{response}} of a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) is considered using a wave equation for the substrate and the Navier-Stokes equations for a finite liquid layer under a slip boundary condition. It is shown {{that when the}} slip length to shear wave penetration depth is small, the first order effect of slip is only present in the frequency response. Importantly, in this approximation the frequency response satisfies an additivity relation with a net response equal to a Kanazawa liquid term plus an additional Sauerbrey "rigid" liquid mass. For the slip length to result in an enhanced frequency decrease compared to a no-slip boundary condition, it is shown that the slip length must be negative so that the slip plane {{is located on the}} liquid side of the interface. It is argued that the physical application of such a negative slip length could be to the liquid phase {{response of}} a QCM with a completely wetted rough surface. Effectively, the model recovers the starting assumption of additivity used in the trapped mass model for the liquid phase response of a QCM having a rough surface. When applying the slip boundary condition to the rough surface problem, slip is not at a molecular level, but is a formal hydrodynamic boundary condition which relates the response of the QCM to that expected from a QCM with a smooth surface. Finally, possible interpretations of the results in terms of acoustic reflectivity are developed and the potential limitations of the additivity result should <b>vapour</b> <b>trapping</b> occur are discussed...|$|R

The carbonization of some low volatile matter coals {{for the production of}} metallurgical coke in slot type ovens is accompanied by the exertion of pressures on the walls which can be dangerous and destroy the walls. It is generally accepted that coking pressure originates from the volatile matter released from the coal being retained as pressurized <b>vapours</b> <b>trapped</b> within the plastic layer of the carbonizing coal charge. Pressure during carbonization also influences the nature of the carbon texture and the porous structure of coke is strongly dependent on volatile matter release during the plastic stage of the carbonization process. There is therefore a possible association of coking pressure, coke porous structure and coke carbon texture. Seven coals giving a variety of wall pressures, as measured in a movable-wall oven,ranging from safe to dangerously coking, were carbonized in a small laboratory oven. The textural compositions of the resultant cokes were assessed by polarized light microscopy while pore structural parameters were measured by computerized image analysis. The textural compositions varied with volatile matter content of the coals while the porosities varied linearly with the internal gas pressures measured in a single plastic layer. In an attempt to investigate possible relations between the pore structure development and internal gas pressures generated in a single plastic layer, polished surfaces showing the coal-to-coke transformation were prepared after quenching carbonized single-wall oven charges. These surfaces were studied by image analysis techniques to obtain measurements of the pore sizes as carbonization proceeded. Pore sizes generally rose to a maximum within the plastic temperature range before falling to the almost constant value seen in the semicoke. No systematic variation between the pore structure development and the internal gas pressures could be established...|$|R

Due to the extreme nonlinearity of the volume oscillations, excess water <b>vapour</b> is <b>trapped</b> in the bubble during a rapid inertial collapse. Water vapour is prevented from exiting by relatively slow di¬usion and non-equilibrium conden-sation at the bubble wall.

The quantity and disposition of hydroxyl radicals produced within the bubble are studied in some detail, as this is of keen interest in sonochemistry. It was recently shown by Moss and co-workers that light emission from a sonoluminescence bubble depends sensitively on the water-vapour content.

40|$|There {{is a need}} in {{industry}} for a commodity polyethylene film with controllable degradation properties that will degrade in an environmentally neutral way, for applications such as shopping bags and packaging film. Additives such as starch {{have been shown to}} accelerate the degradation of plastic films, however control of degradation is required so that the film will retain its mechanical properties during storage and use, and then degrade when no longer required. By the addition of a photocatalyst it is hoped that polymer film will breakdown with exposure to sunlight. Furthermore, it is desired that the polymer film will degrade in the dark, after a short initial exposure to sunlight. Research has been undertaken into the photo- and thermo-oxidative degradation processes of 25 ìm thick LLDPE (linear low density polyethylene) film containing titania from different manufacturers. Films were aged in a suntest or in an oven at 50 °C, and the oxidation product formation was followed using IR spectroscopy. Degussa P 25, Kronos 1002, and various organic-modified and doped titanias of the types Satchleben Hombitan and Hunstsman Tioxide incorporated into LLDPE films were assessed for photoactivity. Degussa P 25 was found to be the most photoactive with UVA and UVC exposure. Surface modification of titania was found to reduce photoactivity. Crystal phase is thought to be among the most important factors when assessing the photoactivity of titania as a photocatalyst for degradation. Pre-irradiation with UVA or UVC for 24 hours of the film containing 3 % Degussa P 25 titania prior to aging in an oven resulted in embrittlement in ca. 200 days. The multivariate data analysis technique PCA (principal component analysis) was used as an exploratory tool to investigate the IR spectral data. Oxidation products formed in similar relative concentrations across all samples, confirming that titania was catalysing the oxidation of the LLDPE film without changing the oxidation pathway. PCA was also employed to compare rates of degradation in different films. PCA enabled the discovery of water <b>vapour</b> <b>trapped</b> inside cavities formed by oxidation by titania particles. Imaging ATR/FTIR spectroscopy with high lateral resolution was used in a novel experiment to examine the heterogeneous nature of oxidation of a model polymer compound caused by the presence of titania particles. A model polymer containing Degussa P 25 titania was solvent cast onto the internal reflection element of the imaging ATR/FTIR and the oxidation under UVC was examined over time. Sensitisation of 5 ìm domains by titania resulted in areas of relatively high oxidation product concentration. The suitability of transmission IR with a synchrotron light source to the study of polymer film oxidation was assessed as the Australian Synchrotron in Melbourne, Australia.

40|$|A {{review is}} given of {{techniques}} for sampling, extraction, separation {{and analysis of}} essential oils, {{and the effects of}} each upon the finally determined essential oil composition. It is concluded "that presently available techniques such as steam-distillation, solvent extraction, <b>vapour</b> <b>trapping</b> and even solid-sampling gas chromatographic injection procedures impose so many characteristic effects upon the volatile terpenoids in a plant sample, that it is not practicable to obtain instantaneous measurement of volatiles as they are released to the atmosphere. In addition, many of the well-known techniques and approaches to essential oil analysis lead to many losses and artifacts, and are so protracted as to mitigate against the feasibility of a routine analytical procedure for use in a survey of essential oils. A recommended routine analytical procedure was developed for use in surveys of essential oils, and its effectiveness is illustrated by the analysis of essential oils from 7 endemic Tasmanian plants. Details are given of the development of syringe-headspace gas chromatographic analysis, which is a novel method of identifying and monitoring components in vapours from comminuted plant tissue as they are released to the atmosphere at room temperature. The syringe-headspace technique is recommended as a means of directly using verified plant species from a botanical gardens as a source of reference terpenes, which otherwise may be too unstable to be stored as pure compounds. This technique allows the relative retention time of an authentic terpenoid to be measured in plant material for direct comparison with that of an unidentified compound. It thereby enables the worker to justify spending considerable effort in synthesizing, isolating or purchasing the suspected terpenoid. Successive injections of vapour from a single sample of comminuted foliage, by the syringe-headspace technique, often exhibit changes in the proportions of some components with respect to one another. Such changes were observed between terpenoids having a common hypothetical precursor according to the biosynthetic scheme by Ruzicka. This technique is a novel means of directly measuring biosynthetic changes. It considerably extends the usefulness of Zavarin's earlier advocated procedure for utilizing 'quantitative co-occurrence', which is a basically different procedure to supplement the results of tracer studies. Both the routine analytical procedure for analysis of essential oils, and the syringe-headspace technique were used to compare the compositions of terpenoids in 19 species of conifer susceptible to attack by the Woodwasp, Sirex noctilio. An investigation was also made of earlier inferred changes in the compositions of essential oils following the wounding of trees of Pinus radiata. Widely varying compositions are reported for the first time for oils distilled from bark of felled. trees. Variations in oil composition from a single injured tree trunk ranged from 15. 7 to 20. 3 percent a-pinene, 54. 8 to 68. 2 percent 8 -pinene, 9. 0 to 18. 3 percent limonene and 2. 5 to 6. 7 percent myrcene. The range of compositions of oils from within and between trees of a species was very wide, so that in a comparison of each species, no single insect-attractive optimum composition could be envisaged. It appeared more likely that S. noctilio could be attracted to one of the 'temporarily-released' components which appeared to cause qualitative changes in many oils...|$|R

A {{significant}} improvement in the PTR-MS instru-ment sensitivity to formaldehyde was obtained by drying the air sample to a dew point of − 30 ◦C using a cold trap to condense and freeze water <b>vapour.</b> At warmer <b>trap</b> tempera-tures there was significant uptake of formaldehyde and other water soluble organics, suggesting {{the presence of a}} quasi-liquid layer on the ice surface. By removing water vapour to a low constant dew point, the PTR-MS can be operated at low E/N ratios, significantly increasing normalized sensitivi-ties for all organics and removing their humidity dependence due to reactions with H+(H 2 O) 2. At an E/N ratio of 80 Td, the formaldehyde normalized sensitivity was 25 Hz/ppbv per MHz H 3 O+ with an estimated detection limit of 78 pptv. Field testing demonstrated good agreement between HCHO measurements made at ambient humidity and corrected for water vapour effects compared to dehumidified sampling at − 30 ◦C. Field testing also revealed that at an E/N ratio of 100 Td or lower there was a significant ion signal at m/z= 49, likely CH 3 OOH. Sampling drying and operation at low E/N ratios enables sensitive measurements of HCHO and poten-tially CH 3 OOH, both important tropospheric photoproducts. ...|$|R
30|$|Geothermal {{energy is}} stored as heat in rocks and <b>trapped</b> <b>vapour</b> or liquid {{such as water}} or brines (Muffler and Cataldi 1978; International Energy Agency 2011). The {{different}} possibilities for its utilization are also related to depth and subsurface temperatures and lead to the distinction of shallow and deep geothermal resources. Shallow geothermal energy refers to systems frequently using heat pumps for exploitation of near-surface environments characterized by temperatures < 20 °C and depths < 400  m (Stober et al. 2009). Deep geothermal energy refers to direct use of geothermal heat at temperatures > 20 °C (Líndal 1973; Saadat et al. 2010). Major applications are in spas and swimming pools for balneological purposes; in industry, for process heating, in agriculture for greenhouse or soil heating or in aquaculture for pond heating. For example, for greenhouse heating temperatures > 40 °C are required, and for district and space heating, temperatures > 60 °C (Pluymaekers et al. 2012). In order to efficiently use a wider temperature domain, different applications demanding successively lower temperatures are ideally implemented in a cascade (International Energy Agency 2011; Líndal 1973). Space cooling is also possible using geothermal heat with a minimum temperature of 60 °C to 70 °C as an energy source for heat-driven sorption chillers instead of electrically driven compression chillers (International Energy Agency 2011; Líndal 1973; Saadat et al. 2010). Another important field of application related to geothermal energy is the seasonal storage of solar energy or spare heat in deep aquifers (e.g., Stober and Bucher 2012).|$|R

However, the remote laser welding process of zinc-coated sheet metal parts in lap joint configuration poses a challenge due {{to the difference between}} the melting temperature of the steel (∼ 1500 C) and the vaporizing temperature of the zinc (~ 907 C). In fact, the zinc layer at the faying surface is vaporized and the <b>vapour</b> might be <b>trapped</b> within the melting pool leading to weld defects. Various solutions have been proposed to overcome this problem over the years. Among them, laser dimpling has been adopted by manufacturers because of its flexibility and effectiveness along with its cost advantages. In essence, the dimple works as a spacer between the two sheets in lap joint and allows the zinc vapour escape during welding process, thereby preventing weld defects. However, {{there is a lack of}} comprehensive characterization of dimpling process for effective implementation in real manufacturing system taking into consideration inherent changes in variability of process parameters. This paper introduces a methodology to develop (i) surrogate model for dimpling process characterization considering multiple–inputs (i. e. key control characteristics) and multiple–outputs (i. e. key performance indicators) system by conducting physical experimentation and using multivariate adaptive regression splines; (ii) process capability space (Cp–Space) based on the developed surrogate model that allows the estimation of a desired process fallout rate in the case of violation of process requirements in the presence of stochastic variation; and, (iii) selection and optimization of the process parameters based on the process capability space. The proposed methodology provides a unique capability to: (i) simulate the effect of process variation as generated by manufacturing process; (ii) model quality requirements with multiple and coupled quality requirements; and (iii) optimize process parameters under competing quality requirements such as maximizing the dimple height while minimizing the dimple lower surface area...|$|R
40|$|Quartz and pyrite {{samples from}} Pliocene-recent, sub-economic orogenic gold {{mineralisation}} in the Southern Alps and Mesozoic economic deposits in the Otago Schist Belt have been analysed for noble gases and halogens. Palaeo-hydrothermal fluids preserved in fluid inclusions were released by crushing and analysed by mass spectrometry. Helium isotope measurements confirm {{the absence of}} a mantle-derived fluid component in gold-bearing veins from the Southern Alps and at the large gold deposit at Macraes in Otago. A possible minor mantle helium component is observed in veins within 10 km of the Alpine Fault that do not contain gold. Halogen ratios support the absence of mantle-derived fluid and support the presence of a crustal fluid derived from sediments, indicated by high I/Cl ratios. Mixing trends between 40 Ar/ 36 Ar and Cl/ 36 Ar indicate mixing between a meteoric-derived fluid or air and crust-derived fluid in all sample types. A correlation between 40 Ar/ 36 Ar and 132 Xe/ 36 Ar shows that xenon is also sourced from the crustal fluid. Despite a strong crustal-radiogenic Ar signal in some samples, measured neon isotope ratios are atmosphere like. Noble gas elemental ratios show strongly fractionated 20 Ne/ 36 Ar away from air-saturated water and air values in deeper formed veins, suggesting air contamination is not dominant. Evidence for the presence of a significant <b>trapped</b> <b>vapour</b> phase is provided by calculated noble gas concentrations in water. Formation of this vapour phase using a two-stage model of de-gassing of meteoric water, and subsequent partial re-dissolution by a Rayleigh fractionation process could account for fractionated 20 Ne/ 36 Ar and atmospheric neon isotope ratios. In the Southern Alps, three main types of mineralisation can be identified by noble gas and halogen properties. Deep forming veins contain the most gold and are characterised by 20 Ne/ 36 Ar greater than air, 132 Xe/ 36 Ar ratios up to 75 times the air value, indicating metamorphic and meteoric fluid components. Some deep ankeritic type veins that display evidence of a CO 2 -rich component fluid show the highest 20 Ne/ 36 Ar ratios. Shallow, late veins have 20 Ne/ 36 Ar between air-saturated water and air values, and lower xenon and iodine contents. These veins formed from a boiling rock-exchanged meteoric fluid with a minor metamorphic fluid component and contain less gold. The characteristics of the Nenthorn deposit in Otago {{are similar to those of}} the shallow Alpine veins. The economically significant Macraes deposit possibly formed from a meteoric component and a strong metamorphic fluid component derived from the original sediments. This is indicated by the highest levels of excess xenon (relative to air) determined in this study. There is some potential for xenon to be used to fingerprint gold bearing fluids sourced from similar metasedimentary piles in orogenic belts.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} the dynamic properties of wide range of interfacial systems, from colloidal particles in solution, through the realm of aerosols and onto studies of molecular adsorption at an interface. The primary experimental technique utilized is optical tweezers. An exploration {{of the history of the}} use of radiation pressure to manipulate matter is presented, followed by an introduction to how optical tweezers work. Some of the more advanced methods of tweezing are discussed, with an emphasis on the use of spatial light modulators (SLMs) to realise dynamic holographic optical tweezers (DHOTs), an example of which has been constructed within our laboratory using off-the-shelf optical components, and combined with a spectrometer to facilitate high resolution spectroscopic studies of microscopic systems. The spectroscopic analysis of microparticles is greatly enhanced by optical feedback generated when the wavelength of light utilized is an integer number of wavelengths around the circumference of the microsphere. Enhanced signal occurs at these wavelengths, termed whispering gallery modes (WGMs). The absolute position of these resonances depends strongly upon the shape, size and refractive index of the particle, and is predicted by Mie theory. A discussion of the concepts behind Mie theory, as well as how to use an experimental WGM spectrum to deduce the size and composition of a microparticle, is provided. This technique is then put to use in a detailed study on the properties of single aerosols, comprised of sodium chloride solution, and generated using a handheld medical nebulizer. Studies have been carried out on both evaporating and growing droplets trapped with a Gaussian beam; in the latter case, periods of size stability are observed, owing to resonant absorption of radiation at the trapping laser wavelength. The SLM can be used to change the trapping laser to a Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) mode, and an investigation of how this affects the dynamics of the droplet is presented. It is found that the use of LG modes with $ellgeq 10 $ produced Raman spectra with significantly more intense WGMs, and also suppressed droplet evaporation. Through observations made with fluorescent polystyrene microspheres, it is argued that the LG modes are more efficient at coupling into WGMs of the droplets. Leading on from these experiments on salt water droplets, experiments have been conducted using ionic liquids (ILs). These fluids have many fascinating properties and potential applications. The optical trapping of droplets comprised of aqueous solutions of the ionic liquid ethylammonium nitrate (EAN) and water has been demonstrated for the first time. These droplets are analysed spectroscopically by illuminating them with the output from a broadband LED; WGMs that are observed in the backscattered light are used to determine their size and composition. The response of the droplets to conditions of varying relative humidity has also been investigated. In order to characterise the relative humidity experienced by both the salt water and IL droplets, the concentration of water <b>vapour</b> within the <b>trapping</b> cells has been measured using diode laser absorption spectroscopy. The spatially modulated laser beam is then utilized in a different fashion; instead of optically tweezing a sample, a low numerical aperture objective lens is utilized to focus the laser onto the surface of a gold coated microscope slide. When a colloidal sample is placed on this surface, the thermal gradients cause the particles to form two dimensional crystals. The SLM is utilized to form multiple nucleation sites, and the dynamics of the crystals are directly observed in real time using video microscopy. It is found that grain rotation-induced grain coalescence (GRIGC) occurs, with the rotation of both crystals before coalescence. Control over the grain size is achieved by altering the separation of the laser spots, and shows that the time scale for grain boundary annealing in our system is in good agreement with theoretical expressions formulated for nanocrystal growth. Finally, as a complimentary technique to the microparticle spectroscopy previously discussed, a bulk interface is probed by using evanescent wave broadband cavity enhanced absorption spectroscopy (EW-BBCEAS) specifically to study the adsorption of cytochrome c (cyt c) to a fused silica surface. Visible radiation from a supercontinuum source is coupled into an optical cavity consisting of a pair of broadband high reflectivity mirrors, and a total internal reflection (TIR) event at the prism/water interface. Aqueous solutions of cyt c are placed onto the TIR footprint on the prism surface and the subsequent protein adsorption is probed by the resulting evanescent wave. The time integrated cavity output is directed into a spectrometer, where it is dispersed and analysed. The broadband nature of the source allows observation of a wide spectral range (ca 250 nm in the visible). The system is calibrated by measuring the absorption spectra of dyes of a known absorbance. Absorption spectra of cyt c are obtained for both S and P polarized radiation, allowing information about the orientation of the adsorbed protein to be extracted.

40|$|An {{essential}} part of a gas chromatographic apparatus is a vapour detector capable of monitoring vapour concentrations in the gas stream emerging from the column. When this work was started (1958), there were three "high-sensitivity" detectors known, (capable of detecting less than 10 - 6 gms.) They were: 1) The flame ionisation detector; Vapour enters a small flame of hydrogen burning in air where it is thermally ionised. A polarising voltage is applied between two electrodes, {{one of which is}} usually the metal burner. The ion concentration in the flame allows a current to flow through an external circuit where it is made to drive a recorder. 2) The discharge tube detector: The potential drop across a low pressure gas discharge is very sensitive to small concentrations of impurities. Very small amounts of vapour can therefore be detected by passing the carrier gas into a continuously pumped discharge tube, and using the potential drop across the tube to drive a recorder. 3) The triode ionisation gauge: This piece of apparatus is normally used for low-pressure measurement. Molecules of gas or vapour in the gauge are ionised by electrons from a hot filament, which are accelerated by a positive potential on a suitable electrode. The ions are attracted to a negatively charged collector electrode. When applied to gas-chromatography, part of the carrier gas is fed into a continuously pumped ionisation gauge and the accelerating potential is adjusted so that it is insufficient to ionise the carrier gas molecules, but high enough to ionise molecules of vapour. The ion current constitutes the output from the detector. Detectors of each of these three types have been built and tested. This was done with the object of assessing their relative merits in various applications, in this laboratory and elsewhere, for which less sensitive detectors had been found inadequate. The parameters compared include simplicity of construction and operation, reliability under operating conditions, noise levels with, and suitability for, various types of sample, and sensitivities, both of one detector to a range of compounds, and of different detectors to the same compound. The flame ionisation detector has the merits of simple and rugged construction (although for the highest sensitivity the detector and the electronic "impedance converter" must be carefully made). It is highly sensitive, particularly to hydrocarbons, and has a low (potentially very low) noise level. Various detectors were built, differing in details of construction, and the merits of the different arrangements compared. The final form adopted incorporated a "concentric double burner" in which the sample in a stream of nitrogen was fed directly into the flame by a narrow tube inside the actual burner. This was to avoid the possibility of reaction between hydrogen and some of the samples, which might have occurred if nitrogen and hydrogen were mixed before the flame, as is the usual practice. The use of separate gas flows for flame and carrier allows them to be adjusted independently. With certain samples, in particular those, such as compounds of tin and silicon, which give involatile oxides on combustion or pyrolysis, there was considerable noise of a "spiky" kind. This could largely be eliminated by reversing the customary polarity of the high polarising voltage (the usual polarity is 'jet negative') and by using an unusual type of electrode - a wire ring or metal foil cylinder. This detector is not damaged by overload, and is completely insensitive to water: two properties which make it very suitable for biological problems. This has been shown by some work, on the scents of moths; the compounds of interest being present in trace amounts in excess of water. The response of the flame ionisation detector to the foll- owing compounds has been checked, and in most cases values for the sensitivity have been obtained: hydrocarbons, carbon tetrachloride, and many other organic compounds, mono-, di-, tri-, and hexa-silanes, silicones, phosphorus chloronitriles, silicon tetrachloride, stannic chloride, chlorine, bromine, iodine, hydrogen chloride, metal acetyl- acetonates, carbon disulphide, ammonia. For theoretical work on the flame ionisation detector a knowledge of the flame temperature under various conditions is needed. Measurements were made on the detector used in the rest of this work by the sodium line reversal method, and by small thermocouples. The value obtained was about 1380 Â°C at a large burner and about 1700 Â°C at a small one. (H 2 flow rate: 50 cc. /min.). The triode ionisation gauge is potentially very sensitive indeed to organic compounds and the noise level is low. However the filaments are very susceptible to "poisoning", and the requirements in vacuum apparatus are exacting. The discharge tube detector is very sensitive, but the noise level is high. The minimum detectable sample is roughly the same as that for the flame ionisation detector, though the absolute sensitivity is much greater. The detector overloads easily and the electrodes become contaminated and the discharge is extinguished, but samples smaller than 10 - 4 gms. have no adverse effect. After the work had begun a fourth high sensitivity detector was announced, the argon ionisation detector. Here vapour molecules carried in a stream of argon are ionised by collision with excited argon atoms. The excited argon atoms are produced by bombardment with electrons, accelerated by a potential of 1000 - 2000 volts. Radiation from a radioactive source within the detector provides the electrons by ionisation of argon atoms. The ion current is monitored. Some work was done on this detector, and it was seen to be capable of very high sensitivity along with a very low noise level, but to be liable to erratic behaviour if the samples were too large. It {{is the only one of}} the four detectors which is non- destructive (although the triode ionisation gauge usually take only a portion of the sample. The approximate response of the detector to some organic and inorganic compounds has been determined. They include mono- and di-silane, monogermane, ammonia, phosphine, and hydrogen sulphide. Two variant forms of this detector were also briefly investigated: a commercial all-glass detector, and an all-glass detector with the source of radiation outside the ionisation chamber, both of which may be useful for corrosive samples. Various methods of injection of known amounts of sample have been used: a capillary of known volume filled with sample, injection of <b>vapour</b> from a <b>trap</b> of known volume at a known pressure, injection from sample tubes filled with vapour at a known temperature and pressure and sealed, and continuous saturation of the gas stream with vapour from a sample at a known temperature. The last method was the most satisfactory where it was applicable. </p...|$|R
