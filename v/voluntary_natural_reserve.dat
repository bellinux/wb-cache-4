40|$|At the {{instigation}} of the CES (Conseil Economique et Social) of the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire, {{the natives}} and senior {{staff of the}} Yacolidabouo village decided to maintain and perpetuate the <b>Voluntary</b> <b>Natural</b> <b>Reserve</b> (VNR) of the aforesaid village. Such a project could be expanded to approximately twenty other sites of the region expressing a comparable status. For this purpose, {{the knowledge of the}} existing flora was necessary. The CES funded a mission from 20 to 22 September 2013. It mainly aimed the assessment of the man's influence on the environment represented by the VNR and the village plantations planted with cocoa tree associated with rubber tree and coffee tree. Methodology used was both based on review of the scientific literature and floristic itinerant inventory. It emerged from results that the environment represented by the village plantations was fundamentally damaged. In contrast, the VNR was relatively conserved environment. Within this latter, with respect to floristic, the present survey showed that this area consisted of 139 plant species, derived from 118 genus and 56 vascular plant families. In this same area, we met 2 types of plant formation: forest gallery and fallow. In such biotopes, we counted some species with particular status. These are 10 endemic species at the forest region of West Africa, 10 species are become rare for ivorian flora and recorded on the red list of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUNC). In addition, 70 useful species and 29 others used in trade in Côte d’Ivoire were counted there. Special status species, namely the medicinal ones, the threatened ones of extinction as well as the used ones as softwood lumber must be regenerated of emergency...|$|E

40|$|The major {{premise of}} this article is: {{accessibility}} in <b>natural</b> <b>reserves</b> could become {{a risk factor for}} protected natural elements, if the ways of access inside of <b>natural</b> <b>reserve</b> are not correlated with the preserve purposes. Moreover, the transport network density and quality are elements, which lead to landscape fragmentation. These parameters catalyze the visitors flux inside the <b>natural</b> <b>reserve,</b> and thus, they could be identified like reserve vulnerability vectors. In order to prove this hypothesis we analyzed two study cases: the <b>natural</b> <b>reserve</b> “The Lăpuşna epicea woodnatural reserve” (The Eastern Carpathians) and “The <b>natural</b> <b>reserve</b> Les Hauts de Chartreuse” (French Alps). Regarding the transport network, the two <b>natural</b> <b>reserves</b> are totally opposed: the Romanian reserve is located in a isolated area, and the French reserve is very accessible. In both cases, the transport infrastructure,road density and their connection with landscape fragmentation were studied...|$|R
