5|$|Loyalty, fidelity, and {{betrayal}} are significant {{themes in the}} book, explored {{against the background of}} both planetary and interplanetary relations. Genly Ai is sent to Gethen as an envoy of the Ekumen, whose mission is to convince the various Gethenian nations that their identities will not be destroyed when they integrate with the Ekumen. At the same time, the planetary conflict between Karhide and Orgoreyn is shown as increasing nationalism, making it hard for those in each country to <b>view</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> citizens of the planet.|$|E
5|$|Securely {{attached}} adults tend to {{have positive}} views of themselves, their partners and their relationships. They feel comfortable with intimacy and independence, balancing the two. Anxious-preoccupied adults seek high levels of intimacy, approval and responsiveness from partners, becoming overly dependent. They {{tend to be less}} trusting, have less positive views about themselves and their partners, and may exhibit high levels of emotional expressiveness, worry and impulsiveness in their relationships. Dismissive-avoidant adults desire a high level of independence, often appearing to avoid attachment altogether. They <b>view</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> self-sufficient, invulnerable to attachment feelings and not needing close relationships. They tend to suppress their feelings, dealing with rejection by distancing themselves from partners of whom they often have a poor opinion. Fearful-avoidant adults have mixed feelings about close relationships, both desiring and feeling uncomfortable with emotional closeness. They tend to mistrust their partners and <b>view</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> unworthy. Like dismissive-avoidant adults, fearful-avoidant adults tend to seek less intimacy, suppressing their feelings.|$|E
5|$|Mental health {{consists}} of a broad scope of measurements of mental well being including depression, stress and measurements of self-worth. Numerous factors affect the prevalence of mental health disorders among women in India, including older age, low educational attainment, fewer children in the home, lack of paid employment and excessive spousal alcohol use. There is also {{evidence to suggest that}} disadvantages associated with gender increase the risk for mental health disorders. Women who find it acceptable for men to use violence against female partners may <b>view</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> less valuable than men. In turn, this may lead women to seek out fewer avenues of healthcare inhibiting their ability to cope with various mental disorders.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{a decline}} in social {{mobility}} for those of less prominent clans, the local elites became far more integrated into a nationwide upper class social structure during the Eastern Han period, thus expanding the classification of who belonged to the upper class. The emerging gentry class—which became fully consolidated during the Eastern Han—consisted of unemployed scholars, teachers, students, and government officials. These men, although geographically separated and mired in local activities, started to <b>view</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> participants in wider national affairs of politics and scholarship. They recognized shared values of filial piety, deference, and emphasizing study in the Five Classics over holding public office. Emperors Yuan and Cheng were forced to abandon their resettlement schemes for officials and their families around the royal tombs settlement in 40 BCE and 15 BCE, respectively; unlike the days of Emperor Wu, historian Cho-Yun Hsu asserts {{that at this point}} officials and scholars had so much influence in both local and national-level politics that to forcibly relocate them became unthinkable.|$|E
5|$|Team {{effectiveness}} (also {{referred to}} as group effectiveness) is the capacity a team has to accomplish the goals or objectives administered by an authorized personnel or the organization. A team {{is a collection of}} individuals who are interdependent in their tasks, share responsibility for outcomes, and <b>view</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> a unit embedded in an institutional or organizational system which operates within the established boundaries of that system. Teams and groups have established a synonymous relationship within the confines of processes and research relating to their effectiveness (i.e. group cohesiveness, teamwork) while still maintaining their independence as two separate units, as groups and their members are independent of each other's role, skill, knowledge or purpose versus teams and their members, who are interdependent upon each other's role, skill, knowledge and purpose.|$|E

Some, like Salutati, were the Chancellors of Italian cities, but the majority (including Petrarch) were ordained as priests, and many worked as senior officials of the Papal court. Humanist Renaissance popes Nicholas V, Pius II, Sixtus IV, and Leo X wrote books and amassed huge libraries.|$|E

25|$|Quakers, or Friends, {{are members}} of a family of {{religious}} movements collectively known as the Religious Society of Friends. The central unifying doctrine of these movements is the priesthood of all believers. Many Friends <b>view</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> members of a Christian denomination. They include those with evangelical, holiness, liberal, and traditional conservative Quaker understandings of Christianity. Unlike many other groups that emerged within Christianity, the Religious Society of Friends has actively tried to avoid creeds and hierarchical structures.|$|E
25|$|Ahmadi thought {{emphasizes}} {{the belief that}} Islam is the final dispensation for humanity as revealed to Muhammad {{and the necessity of}} restoring to it its true essence and pristine form, which had been lost through the centuries. Ahmadiyya adherents believe that Ahmad appeared in the likeness of Jesus, to end religious wars, condemn bloodshed and reinstitute morality, justice, and peace. They believe that upon divine guidance he divested Islam of fanatical and innovative beliefs and practices by championing what is, in their view, Islam’s true and essential teachings as practised by Muhammad and the early Islamic community. Thus, Ahmadis <b>view</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> leading the revival and peaceful propagation of Islam.|$|E
25|$|In many cases, {{we believe}} that {{individuals}} like to <b>view</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> noble by offering help. This concept {{is related to the}} notion of self-awareness. If it is true that people focus on the impression they make on others, then public-awareness through the use of accountability cues can stimulate people to give help to each other. However, being surrounded by a lot of bystanders does not automatically create public self-awareness. In fact, in some cases being surrounded by bystanders allows an individual to hide within the crowd and feel anonymous. According to Dr. van Bommel, by introducing an accountability cue, the aim is to eliminate feelings of anonymity and increase the likelihood of them offering help.|$|E

25|$|The {{percentage}} of the population that utilizes chiropractic care at any given time generally falls into a range from 6% to 12% in the U.S. and Canada, with a global high of 20% in Alberta in 2006. In 2008, chiropractors were reported to be the most common CAM providers for children and adolescents, consuming up to 14% of all visits to chiropractors. In 2008, there were around 60,000 chiropractors practicing in North America. In 2002–03, the majority of those who sought chiropractic did so for relief from back and neck pain and other neuromusculoskeletal complaints; most do so specifically for low back pain. The majority of U.S. chiropractors participate in some form of managed care. Although the majority of U.S. chiropractors <b>view</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> specialists in neuroleptic malignant syndrome conditions, many also consider chiropractic as a type of primary care. In the majority of cases, the care that chiropractors and physicians provide divides the market, however for some, their care is complementary.|$|E
25|$|Developing {{a sexual}} {{self-concept}} {{is an important}} developmental step during adolescence. This is when adolescents {{try to make sense}} and organize their sexual experiences so that they understand the structures and underlying motivations for their sexual behavior. This sexual self-concept helps adolescents organize their past experiences, but also gives them information to draw on for their current and future sexual thoughts and experiences. Sexual self-concept affects sexual behavior for both men and women, but it also affects relationship development for women. Development of one’s sexual self-concept can occur even before sexual experiences begin. An important part of sexual self-concept is sexual esteem, which includes how one evaluates their sexuality (including their thoughts, emotions and sexual activities). Another aspect is sexual anxiety; this includes one’s negative evaluations of sex and sexuality. Sexual self-concept is not only developed from sexual experiences; both girls and boys can learn from a variety of social interactions such as their family, sexual education programs, depictions in the media and from their friends and peers. Girls with a positive self-schema {{are more likely to be}} liberal in their attitudes about sex, are more likely to <b>view</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> passionate and open to sexual experience and are more likely to rate sexual experiences as positive. Their views towards relationships show that they place high importance on romance, love and intimacy. Girls who have a more negative view often say they feel self-conscious about their sexuality and view sexual encounters more negatively. The sexual self-concept of girls with more negative views are highly influenced by other people; those of girls who hold more positive views are less so.|$|E
25|$|The modern Aes Sedai {{operate as}} self-appointed {{guardians of the}} One Power and are often viewed as above local and {{national}} politics. They <b>view</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>as</b> the rightful owners of all angreal and arbiters of {{anything to do with}} the One Power. They operate as advisers to kings and queens and are shown deference by most. Some nations, however, have banned channeling and view Aes Sedai as suspect, if not outright evil. Aes Sedai search the world for females with the inherent ability to channel, or the ability to be taught to channel, and bring any they find to the Tower. Untrained channelers can be a danger to themselves and others, often resulting in accidental deaths. Channelers of a certain age that have survived without Tower training are often derisively referred to as wilders by Aes Sedai. Wilders often experience blocks: an inability to access the One Power except through specific rituals or in specific situations. In many instances these wilders have no idea they are channeling or accessing the One Power at all. With training and time, blocks can often be overcome and the wilder can channel at will. Foreign lands outside the Aes Sedai's purview often handle channeling and channelers quite differently from Aes Sedai custom and tend to distrust their assumed authority. Aes Sedai consider them wilders as well, and not entirely without reason. Most foreign channeling traditions have more specific and more limited understanding of the One Power than do Aes Sedai. Additionally, most of these traditions trace their origins back to offshoots of the original Aes Sedai split off after the Breaking of the World. The Aes Sedai, however, can trace their history well back within the Age of Legends.|$|E
