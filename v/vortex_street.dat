25|$|Most of the {{whistles}} described generate nearly pure tones {{that can}} be heard. The mountain tones discussed above are examples of tones that are inaudible because they are below the frequency range of humans. There are others whose sound levels are below the audible range of humans. For example, the <b>vortex</b> <b>street</b> behind a stick underwater might radiate at audible frequencies but not sufficiently to be heard by a Scuba diver. There are others that are both below audible frequencies and below audible levels.|$|E
25|$|An {{example is}} shown in the figure on the right with a water jet. The laminar {{two-dimensional}} jet amplifies small disturbances at the orifice to generate a <b>vortex</b> <b>street.</b> For this case, the flow speed, in terms of Reynolds number, was graphed against the disturbance frequency, in terms of the Strouhal number for a variety of disturbance amplitudes to reveal the region of instability as shown in the figure on the left. The value of D in the figure represents the ratio of the lateral disturbance displacement to the nozzle width; the disturbances were minute.|$|E
25|$|Hydrodynamic {{feedback}} (Class I) {{influences the}} formation of new vortices and exerts a fluctuating force on the cylinder. The flow field {{is shown in the}} upper figure on the right (created by Gary Koopman). Theodor von Karman identified and analyzed the flow behind objects like a cylinder and since then this special flow has been called the Karman <b>vortex</b> <b>street.</b> Vincenz Strouhal was the first to scientifically investigate the sound emitted by flow around a rigid cylinder. At low Reynolds numbers the tone was pure and the frequency was proportional to the steady flow speed U and inversely proportional to the cylinder diameter d.|$|E

2500|$|Richard Feynman {{was among}} the most {{well-known}} physicists associated with Caltech, having published the Feynman Lectures on Physics, an undergraduate physics text, and a few other popular science texts such as Six Easy Pieces for the general audience. The promotion of physics made him a public figure of science, although his Nobel-winning work in quantum electrodynamics was already very established in the scientific community. Murray Gell-Mann, a Nobel-winning physicist, introduced a classification of hadrons and went on to postulate the existence of quarks, which is currently accepted as part of the Standard Model. Long-time Caltech President Robert Andrews Millikan was the first to calculate the charge of the electron with his well-known oil-drop experiment, while Richard Chace Tolman is remembered for his contributions to cosmology and statistical mechanics. 2004 Nobel Prize in Physics winner H. David Politzer is a current professor at Caltech, as is astrophysicist and author Kip Thorne and eminent mathematician Barry Simon. Linus Pauling pioneered quantum chemistry and molecular biology, and went on to discover the nature of the chemical bond in 1939. Seismologist Charles Richter, also an alumnus, developed the magnitude scale that bears his name, the Richter magnitude scale for measuring the power of earthquakes. One {{of the founders of the}} geochemistry department, Clair Patterson was the first to accurately determine the age of the Earth via lead:uranium ratio in meteorites. [...] In engineering, Theodore von Kármán made many key advances in aerodynamics, notably his work on supersonic and hypersonic airflow characterization. A repeating pattern of swirling vortices is named after him, the von Kármán <b>vortex</b> <b>street.</b> Participants in von Kármán's GALCIT project included Frank Malina, who helped develop the WAC Corporal which was the first U.S. rocket to reach the edge of space, Jack Parsons, a pioneer in the development of liquid and solid rocket fuels who designed the first castable composite-based rocket motor, and Qian Xuesen, who was dubbed the [...] "Father of Chinese Rocketry". More recently, Michael Brown, a professor of planetary astronomy, discovered many trans-Neptunian objects, most notably the dwarf planet Eris, which prompted the International Astronomical Union to redefine the term [...] "planet".|$|E

40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} to study the fluid dynamics of flow past two cylinders of diameter ratio 1 : 2 in a side-by-side arrangement with a gap spacing of T/D = 1. 5. Based on hot-wire measurements and flow visualization results, the most frequent mode of large-scale flow structures in the wake consists of two <b>vortex</b> <b>streets</b> developed from the two cylinders. Behind the big cylinder the "first" (outer) and "second" (inner) streets are isolated. The former has a higher convection velocity, {{which is the same}} as that of the small cylinder's vortices, while the latter convects with a lower velocity. The big and small <b>vortex</b> <b>streets</b> interact in two stages, resulting in lateral transport of fluid across the entire widths of the two wake regions. A locked repetitive pattern of four big vortices with 10 small vortices is observed. A third spectral component behind the gap portion of the small cylinder's wake region is the consequence of the first-stage interaction. The less frequent mode does not suggest interaction of the big and small vortices. © 1993. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} streamline patterns {{associated with}} single and double von Kármán point <b>vortex</b> <b>streets</b> {{on the surface}} of a sphere, with and without pole vortices. The full family of streamline patterns are identified and the topological bifurca-tions from one pattern to another are depicted as a function of latitude and pole strength. The process involves first finding appropriate vortex strengths so that the configuration forms a relative equilibrium, then calculating the angular rotation of the configuration about the center-of-vorticity vector. We next move in a rotating frame of reference so that the configuration is fixed, identify the separatrices in the flowfield and plot the global streamline patterns {{as a function of the}} pole strengths and latitudinal positions of the rings. We carry the procedure out for single and double von Kármán <b>vortex</b> <b>streets,</b> with and without pole vortices. The single von Kármán street configurations are comprised of n evenly spaced vortices on each of two rings that symmetrically straddle the equator and are skewed with respect to each other by half a wavelength, while the double von Kármán ring configurations are made up of four rings of n evenly spaced vortices symmetrically straddling the equator...|$|R
40|$|Turbomachinery flows are {{inherently}} unsteady. While this {{is necessary for}} the machine's operation, it also creates flow inefficiencies. In turbines that have blades with thick trailing edges an important source of unsteady flow is the shedding of <b>vortex</b> <b>streets</b> into the blade wake. The <b>vortex</b> <b>streets</b> cause a separation of the wake flow into areas of high and low energy. This energy separation is non-isentropic and is therefore a source of loss. Vortex shedding also causes the base pressure to fluctuate around a low level. A simplified wake, created by a circular cylinder in compressible cross flow, has been used to model the energy separation and base pressure fluctuation. Time-resolved total temperature and pressure measurements were made six cylinder diameters downstream of the cylinder along with the time-resolved surface pressure. These measurements have then been used to investigate the creation of entropy, and hence loss, in the wake flow and the effect vortex shedding has on the base pressure. The results showed that entropy creation is associated with vortex shedding and that vortex shedding has a very significant effect on the surface pressure over {{a large proportion of the}} cylinder circumference.
