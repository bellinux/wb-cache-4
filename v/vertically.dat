5|$|The larvae {{that emerge}} from the eggs, known as tadpoles (or {{occasionally}} polliwogs), typically have oval bodies and long, <b>vertically</b> flattened tails. As a general rule, free-living larvae are fully aquatic, {{but at least one}} species (Nannophrys ceylonensis) has semiterrestrial tadpoles which live among wet rocks. Tadpoles lack eyelids and have cartilaginous skeletons, lateral line systems, gills for respiration (external gills at first, internal gills later), and <b>vertically</b> flattened tails they use for swimming.|$|E
5|$|According to Li (2005), several {{morphological}} {{features of}} A. longicervia indicate {{a close relationship}} to Sarraceniaceae: both taxa exhibit one or two pitcher wings, a smooth peristome, and pitchers that extend <b>vertically</b> {{from the top of}} a short petiole.|$|E
5|$|Cylinders must {{be secured}} so that they cannot move during transport. They shall not project beyond the sides or ends of the vehicle. It is {{recommended}} that cylinders are transported <b>vertically,</b> secured in an appropriate pallet.|$|E
5|$|Flights are {{generally}} of short duration, rapid, low-leveled, and wavelike. The wings during flight are flapped rapidly, and are frequently used during foraging. They are also capable of flying <b>vertically</b> {{from the base}} of a tree to the top in a single wing assisted bound.|$|E
5|$|Gobioolithus {{eggs were}} {{probably}} laid in open nests {{on the banks}} of ephemeral rivers or lakes, which could frequently flood the nesting areas and bury the eggs. The distribution of the eggs suggests that they had a long-term colonial nesting site at the Khermeen Tsav locality in the Barun Goyot Formation. At the Bayn-Dzak locality, the eggs are typically arranged in clutches, whereas elsewhere they are scattered randomly, each oriented nearly <b>vertically</b> in the substrate. The solitary eggs may have been laid and buried individually, similar to the nesting habits of modern megapodes. It is also possible that they were originally laid in clutches, but flooding separated them and deposited them <b>vertically</b> as the water level dropped. Water damage would also explain why Gobioolithus shells are frequently heavily recrystallized.|$|E
5|$|John Newcomer led {{development}} again, {{which began}} {{to create a}} kit allowing arcade owners to convert an existing cabinet into another game. The original Joust used a horizontal monitor, but Williams chose a <b>vertically</b> oriented screen for the kit {{as a result of}} the design's popularity at the time.|$|E
5|$|Prince died in 1899 aged 88. His {{followers}} buried Prince in {{the grounds}} of the chapel, with his coffin positioned <b>vertically</b> so that he would be standing on the day of his resurrection.|$|E
5|$|Skeet Shoot {{still had}} {{glitches}} {{when it was}} released; one caused the image to flip <b>vertically.</b> Salvo learned of the glitch and fixed it, and the only cartridges that bear the bug are European versions.|$|E
5|$|Stream downcutting {{continued}} {{along with}} canyon-forming {{processes such as}} mass wasting; sediment-rich and abrasive flood stage waters would undermine cliffs until vertical slabs of rock sheared away. This process continues to be especially efficient with the <b>vertically</b> jointed Navajo Sandstone.|$|E
5|$|T-26 model 1938: new conical turret, {{small changes}} in hull parts, {{increased}} volume of fuel tanks. Tank gun mod. 1937 and mod. 1938 were equipped with an electric breechblock and a <b>vertically</b> stabilized TOP-1 telescopic sight (or a TOS telescopic sight on the 1938 model).|$|E
5|$|The club's home kit {{has always}} {{consisted}} of a black-and-white <b>vertically</b> striped shirt, with black shorts and white or black socks. The width of {{the black and white}} stripes has varied from season to season, as has the colour of the shirt numbers, which have usually been red, black, white or yellow. Atlético's traditional away kit is all-white shirts, shorts and socks, but has had slight variations. An all-black third kit was introduced in the 2000 season, being used again in 2015. In 2008, a black-and-gold <b>vertically</b> striped third kit was launched to commemorate the club's centenary, featuring the first crest. Squad number 12 is retired from the club's kits, dedicated to the fans.|$|E
5|$|The flag can {{be flown}} <b>vertically</b> or {{horizontally}} from public buildings, private homes, businesses, ships, town squares, or during official ceremonies. If the flag is flown horizontally, the yellow stripe {{must be at}} top; when flown <b>vertically,</b> the yellow stripe must be facing Left with the red stripe facing Right. While the flag should be flown from sunrise to sunset, government offices in Lithuania and abroad must fly the flag on a 24-hour basis. The flags must conform to the legal standards, and cannot be soiled or damaged in any way.|$|E
5|$|The king moves {{exactly one}} square horizontally, <b>vertically,</b> or diagonally. A special {{move with the}} king known as castling is allowed only once per player, per game (see below).|$|E
5|$|The north half is an unornamented {{vertical}} mass of purple-brown brick, flaring gently out at {{the base}} and top, with <b>vertically</b> continuous bay windows projecting out. The south half is <b>vertically</b> divided by brickwork at the base and rises to a large copper cornice at the roof. Projecting window bays in both halves allow large exposures of glass, giving the building an open appearance despite its mass. The Monadnock {{is part of the}} Printing House Row District, which also includes the Fisher Building, the Manhattan Building, and the Old Colony Building.|$|E
5|$|They are hung <b>vertically</b> {{above the}} floor at or a bit below the waist line, {{suspended}} by ropes fastened to structures like strong tree limb, beam of a house, ceiling, or gong stand.|$|E
5|$|They form {{over large}} lakes and oceans during cold air {{outbreaks}} while {{the water is}} still relatively warm, and {{can be an important}} mechanism in <b>vertically</b> transporting moisture. They are a component of sea smoke.|$|E
5|$|Treecreepers {{are small}} {{woodland}} birds, brown above and white below. They have thin, down-pointed, curved bills, which {{they use to}} extricate insects from bark. They have stiff tail feathers, like woodpeckers, which they use to support themselves <b>vertically</b> on trees.|$|E
5|$|Another habit {{the moth}} has {{in common with}} many {{butterflies}} is the night resting posture—the wings are held <b>vertically</b> over the back. During their migrations they roost in a group for the night. The moth flies over the crown of trees and in clearings. Sometimes because of high winds it is carried about 100m (300ft), it then falls, inert and wings closed, to the ground.|$|E
5|$|Between 1980 and 2000, Gulf {{moved from}} being a monolithic, <b>vertically</b> {{integrated}} multinational corporation to being more {{of a network of}} allied business interests. This has given the entire Gulf enterprise a high degree of strategic and operational flexibility. It is a move that reflects fundamental change in the economics of international business.|$|E
5|$|Crickets {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} insects with mostly cylindrical, somewhat <b>vertically</b> flattened bodies. The head is spherical with long slender antennae arising from cone-shaped scapes (first segments) and just behind {{these are two}} large compound eyes. On the forehead are three ocelli (simple eyes). The pronotum (first thoracic segment) is trapezoidal in shape, robust, and well-sclerotinized. It is smooth and has neither dorsal or lateral keels (ridges).|$|E
5|$|During this process, fungal spores {{germinate}} in the boreholes, {{a reaction}} {{caused by the}} dryness of the tree, creating an appropriate environment and an entry for air. The fungus breaks down the lignin, causing white rot. It moves towards the <b>vertically</b> aligned xylem. The vertical profile shows reddish and white streaks which run {{in the direction of}} growth.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{footprints}} {{show that}} pterosaurs stood {{with the entire}} foot {{in contact with the}} ground (plantigrade), {{in a manner similar to}} many mammals like humans and bears. Footprints from azhdarchids and several unidentified species show that pterosaurs walked with an erect posture with their four limbs held almost <b>vertically</b> beneath the body, an energy-efficient stance used by most modern birds and mammals, rather than the sprawled limbs of modern reptiles. Indeed, erect-limbs may be omnipresent in pterosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Grasshoppers {{have the}} typical insect body plan of head, thorax and abdomen. The head is held <b>vertically</b> {{at an angle}} to the body, with the mouth at the bottom. The head bears a large pair of {{compound}} eyes which give all-round vision, three simple eyes which can detect light and dark, and a pair of thread-like antennae that are sensitive to touch and smell. The downward-directed mouthparts are modified for chewing and there are two sensory palps in front of the jaws.|$|E
5|$|Lissitzky {{argued that}} as long as humans cannot fly, moving {{horizontally}} is natural and moving <b>vertically</b> is not. Thus, where there is not sufficient land for construction, a new plane created in the air at medium altitude should be preferred to an American-style tower. These buildings, according to Lissitzky, also provided superior insulation and ventilation for their inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|Many tall palms are {{herbaceous}} monocots; {{these do}} not undergo secondary growth and never produce wood. In many tall palms, the terminal bud {{on the main}} stem {{is the only one}} to develop, so they have unbranched trunks with large spirally arranged leaves. Some of the tree ferns, order Cyatheales, have tall straight trunks, growing up to , but these are composed not of wood but of rhizomes which grow <b>vertically</b> and are covered by numerous adventitious roots.|$|E
5|$|Meibomian glands, in the eyelids, secrete {{a form of}} sebum called meibum {{onto the}} eye, that slows the {{evaporation}} of tears. It also serves to create an airtight seal when the eyes are closed and its lipid quality also prevents the eyelids from sticking together. The meibomian glands are also known as tarsal glands, Zeis glands and palpebral glands. They attach directly to the follicles of the eyelashes, which are arranged <b>vertically</b> within the tarsal plates of the eyelids.|$|E
5|$|Near Adelaide, in South Australia, three {{bottlenose}} dolphins 'tail-walk', whereby they {{elevate the}} upper part of their bodies <b>vertically</b> out of the water, and propel themselves along the surface with powerful tail movements. Tail-walking mostly arises via human training in dolphinaria. In the 1980s, a female from the local population was kept at a local dolphinarium for three weeks, and the scientist suggests she copied the tail-walking behavior from other dolphins. Two other wild adult female dolphins have now copied it from her.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all {{butterflies}} are diurnal, {{have relatively}} bright colours, and hold their wings <b>vertically</b> above their bodies when at rest, unlike {{the majority of}} moths which fly by night, are often cryptically coloured (well camouflaged), and either hold their wings flat (touching the surface on which the moth is standing) or fold them closely over their bodies. Some day-flying moths, such as the hummingbird hawk-moth, are exceptions to these rules.|$|E
5|$|Open {{water is}} {{unrestricted}} water {{such as a}} sea, lake or flooded quarry, where the diver has direct vertical access {{to the surface of}} the water in contact with the atmosphere. Open water diving implies that if a problem arises, the diver can directly ascend <b>vertically</b> to the atmosphere to breathe air.|$|E
5|$|Operationally, {{the design}} of the cargo holds led to {{considerable}} difficulty for the ground crew, especially baggage handlers at the airports. The cargo hold had its doors located directly underneath the aircraft, so each item of baggage or cargo had to be loaded <b>vertically</b> upwards {{from the top of the}} baggage truck, then slid along the hold floor to be stacked inside. The individual pieces of luggage and cargo also had to be retrieved in a similarly slow manner at the arriving airport.|$|E
5|$|Predators {{include the}} leopard, serval, cats, the black-headed heron, dark {{chanting}} goshawk, African hawk-eagle and Wahlberg's eagle. In South Africa, newly hatched chicks {{were taken by}} a boomslang. If surprised, an African crake will leap <b>vertically</b> into the air before running away, a tactic believed to help it to evade snakes or terrestrial mammals.|$|E
5|$|Railways were {{privately owned}} and operated, until the Colonial Government {{established}} the <b>vertically</b> integrated Victorian Railways in 1883. This remained until corporatisation {{began in the}} 1970s, followed by privatisation in the 1990s. Passenger services today are operated by Metro Trains Melbourne in suburban Melbourne with electric multiple units, and V/Line in regional Victoria with diesel trains. Freight services are operated by Aurizon (interstate), Pacific National and SCT Logistics (interstate and intrastate), and Qube Logistics and TransVolution (intrastate).|$|E
5|$|Shadowrun was {{released}} in North America and Japan by Data East. In PAL regions, it was self-published by Beam Software as Laser Beam Entertainment. The 1994 Japanese version has a significantly longer introduction sequence than the English version {{of the game and}} also has a <b>vertically</b> uncompressed Shadowrun logo on the title screen. Other than that, it uses the same script as the North American and PAL editions, just with Japanese subtitles.|$|E
5|$|The Jain texts {{postulate}} four gatis, that is states-of-existence or birth-categories, {{within which}} the soul transmigrates. The four gatis are: deva (demi-gods), manuṣya (humans), nāraki (hell beings) and tiryañca (animals, plants and micro-organisms). The four gatis have four corresponding realms or habitation levels in the <b>vertically</b> tiered Jain universe: demi-gods occupy the higher levels where the heavens are situated; humans, plants and animals occupy the middle levels; and hellish beings occupy the lower levels where seven hells are situated.|$|E
