A VCA is a preamp that boosts (amplifies) the electronic signal before passing it on to an external or built-in power amplifier, as well as a means to control its amplitude (volume) using an attenuator.

Part {{of the appeal of}} this instrument over the early modular Moogs was that the Minimoog required no patch cables; its signal and control voltage path is hard-wired, or [...] "normalled". While this imposed the signal flow limitation outlined above (VCO → VCF → VCA), there are ways to tweak the sound. For example, in reality, the Minimoog has six sound sources. Five of these sound sources pass to a mixer with independent level controls: ...|$|E

50|$|The {{signal is}} then sent through a <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>amplifier</b> (or <b>VCA)</b> {{and a simple}} four-stage ADSR filter {{envelope}}. One unique feature of the envelope {{is its ability to}} also control the width of the pulse waveform.|$|R
50|$|Some higher-end {{consoles}} use <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>amplifier</b> (<b>VCA)</b> groups VCAs and DCAs function {{somewhat like}} subgroups but let the operator control {{the level of}} multiple input channels with a single fader. Unlike subgroups, no sub-mix is created. The audio signals from the assigned channels remain routed independently of VCA assignments. Since no sub-mix is created, {{it is not possible}} to insert processing such as compressors into a VCA/DCA group. In addition, on most VCA/DCA-equipped consoles, post-fader auxiliary send levels are affected by the VCA master. This is usually desirable, as post-fader auxiliary sends are commonly used for effects such as reverb, and sends to these effects should track changes in the channel signal level.|$|E
50|$|Usson {{is known}} for his DIY work with synthesizers, {{especially}} modular synthesizers. This is reflected in some design elements of the MiniBrute. For example, the MiniBrute includes an effect called Brute Factor, which is a form of overdrive. It is inspired by the technique of rerouting the <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>amplifier</b> (<b>VCA)</b> output on a Moog Minimoog to be processed through the synthesizer again. However, Brute Factor does not require any patching, as it is built into the MiniBrute. Additionally, Usson has made technical diagrams for the MiniBrute's circuitry available on his website, HackABrute, to encourage users to modify their machines. He has also included proposed modifications that have been tested. However, making modifications to the internal system, including those listed on the site, voids Arturia's product warranty.|$|E
5000|$|The {{voltage-controlled filter}} (VCF) and <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>amplifier</b> (<b>VCA)</b> each {{have their own}} ADSD {{envelope}} generator (or Attack-Decay-Sustain-Decay). Musicians {{who are familiar with}} more modern synthesizers might expect the last letter to be R for [...] "Release" [...] (as in ADSR). However, on the Minimoog, the envelopes are ADSD, as the decay setting also sets the time for what is regularly known as release. In other words, there are three knobs to control 4 sections of the sound (most modern synths have four knobs, one for each section) [...] - [...] a [...] "shortcoming" [...] that doesn't seem to diminish the Minimoog's popularity in any way. There is also a switch above the pitch and modulation wheels to engage the final decay stage as well as a switch for engaging the glide circuit.|$|E
50|$|At {{the age of}} 16, Watts {{began working}} at Trident on the mixer {{assembly}} line in their factory on the Shepperton Film Studios lot. In 1976, he showed company co-founder Malcolm Toft an idea he had for a computer-based mixer automation system, using a Sinclair Spectrum computer, which could change equalization settings automatically without using <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>amplifiers</b> (<b>VCA).</b> Toft liked the idea and it {{became the basis for}} the automation of the Trident Di-An (digitally controlled analog) mixer. Watts worked on most of Trident's product line in various engineering roles, including as chief engineer on the VECTOR series large-format analog mixing console and the Di-An mixer.|$|R
5000|$|Early analog synthesizers used {{technology}} from electronic analog computers and laboratory test equipment. They were generally [...] "modular" [...] synthesizers, {{consisting of a}} number of independent electronic modules connected by patch cables into a patchbay that resembled the jackfields used by 1940s-era telephone operators. Synthesizer modules in early analog synthesizers included voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs), voltage-controlled filters (VCFs), and <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>amplifiers</b> (<b>VCAs).</b> The control voltage varied frequency in VCOs and VCFs, and attenuation (gain) in VCAs. Additionally, they used envelope generators, low-frequency oscillators, and ring modulators.Some synthesizers also had effects devices, such as reverb units, or tools such as sequencers or sound mixers. Because many of these modules took input sound signals and processed them, an analog synthesizer could be used both as a sound-generating and sound-processing system.|$|R
40|$|A {{new digital}} beam {{position}} monitor (DBPM) {{system has been}} developed and successfully tested at the PSI proton accelerators. The DBPM hardware consists of an analogue RF front-end (RFFE), a VMEbus backplane module (VBM), and the PSI VME PMC Carrier board (VPC). The RFFE combines the 2 nd RF harmonic (101. 26 MHz) beam signals of pickup coils with a 101. 31 MHz pilot signal. The RFFE output signals are undersampled and down-converted to base-band (no analogue mixer) by ADCs and DDCs (Direct Digital Downconverters) on the VBM. The DDCs send the digitised beam and pilot signal amplitudes to a Virtex 2 Pro FPGA on the VPC board. The FPGA calculates the beam positions at different averaging rates, checks interlock limits, and provides triggered storage of beam position waveforms. Furthermore, the FPGA performs automatic gain control of <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>amplifiers</b> (<b>VCAs)</b> of RFFE and VBM. By continuous normalisation of beam to pilot signal, nonlinearities and temperature drifts of the electronics are eliminated. Compared to the old analogue BPM electronics, the new DBPMs offer an increased dynamic range (0. 2 µA to 2 mA instead of 5 µA to 2 mA) and larger bandwidth (10 kHz instead of 10 Hz) ...|$|R
50|$|Features include four voltage-controlled {{oscillators}} (VCOs) with tuning, footage (16, 8, 4, 2), waveshape (triangle, saw, pulse-width, and pulse-width modulated), and amplitude. The first oscillator is {{the master}} oscillator as far as fine tuning goes. Two direct modifiers to the VCOs are a detune control that only affects oscillators 2 and 4, and a Pulse Width control that goes to cancellation either side of 50% phase symmetry of a square wave; pulse width can be routed to MG1, MG2, or voltage-controlled filter (VCF) envelope. There is one independent noise generator with an amplitude control (frequency and shape is modified by the VCF). There is one 24/db octave exponential low-pass VCF with resonance, scaling and invertible envelope control shared across all four VCOs. One <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>amplifier</b> (<b>VCA)</b> envelope with triggering and dampering controls is shared across all four VCOs. There are two low frequency modulators: MG1 controls VCO Pitch/Pulse-width, 'EFFECTS' and VCF cutoff; MG2 controls the tempo of the arpeggiator, and Pulse-Width. There is one arpeggiator with on/off/latch control, up/down/up-down pitch control, and 1/2/full keyboard control (44 notes). The arpeggiator can cycle through each oscillator in POLY mode, or all four {{at a time in}} MONO. There is an 'EFFECTS' section which includes an amplitude modulator (X-MOD) with hard-sync control, and a frequency modulator with which the frequency of the modulator can be altered by the VCF envelope or MG1. For both modulators there is the option of single modulation of all oscillators, or two carriers, and two modulators (using the VCOs). Controller Interfaces are external inputs/outputs for CV/Trigger, VCF and VCO mod inputs, arpeggiator, portamento, and the pitch/MG1 mod wheels can be assigned to control VCO1 pitch, pitch or the filter. Bender goes to 2.5 octaves +/- for Pitch and full range for VCF cutoff. There are 5 different oscillator assignment modes: 'Hold' drones the oscillators until force dampered or Chord Memory is activated; 'Chord Memory (MONO)' allows 2-4 oscillators (VCOs) to be set to any arrangement across 44 keys (for example, in organ or rave chords); 'Unison (MONO)' stacks all 4 oscillators; and 'Unison/Share', which defaults to Unison with one note played, but divides the oscillators across the notes as 2 or more are played. Poly is without explanation, and oscillators always play in sequenced order from 1-4.|$|E
500|$|While {{designing}} {{sound for}} the musical Hair, Dugan began {{to appreciate the}} human operator's inability to act quickly enough to control multiple microphones. He saw the show's audio mixing person [...] "working rotary knobs for 16 area mics, 9 hand mics, and 10 mics in the band". Dugan thought that a microphone should not be turned on unless it was getting some worthwhile signal, {{more than just the}} room ambiance. His frustration with microphone mixing led him to experiment for a few years with microphone signals controlled automatically by <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>amplifiers</b> (<b>VCAs),</b> finally developing the [...] "Dugan Music System", shown to the AES at their 49th convention, held in New York in 1974. This system used a novel proportional gain algorithm whereby the total gain was divided between all active microphones. The microphones were [...] "continuously and automatically adjusted" [...] by a set of VCAs to bring each microphone up or down in the mix, based on how much signal it was sending relative to the signal received by a reference microphone placed somewhat distant from the other microphones. Dugan's patent application for a [...] "Control Apparatus for Sound Reinforcement Systems" [...] was accepted and published on June 4, 1974. This was the first useful automatic microphone mixing algorithm, the basis for all of Dugan's later systems.|$|R

50|$|Analog signal {{processing}} is for signals {{that have not}} been digitized, as in legacy radio, telephone, radar, and television systems. This involves linear electronic circuits as well as non-linear ones. The former are, for instance, passive filters, active filters, additive mixers, integrators and delay lines. Non-linear circuits include compandors, multiplicators (frequency mixers and <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>amplifiers),</b> <b>voltage-controlled</b> filters, voltage-controlled oscillators and phase-locked loops.|$|R
50|$|From the filter, {{there are}} two {{sequential}} voltage controlled <b>amplifiers</b> (<b>VCAs)</b> through which the signal must pass. And finally the audio is delivered {{to a variety of}} outputs: mono, stereo and six independent outputs (corresponding to the six voices).|$|R
50|$|The voice {{architecture}} of the MKS-80 is fully analog with 8 polyphonic voices with 2 voltage controlled oscillators (VCO) per voice, using the Curtis CEM3340 VCO integrated circuit.

The voltage controlled <b>amplifier</b> (<b>VCA)</b> was controllable only via a 3-stage ADR envelope controller (ADR short for Attack Decay Release). The Prodigy did not feature a white noise or pink noise generator.|$|R
50|$|Like the {{original}} Minimoog, the Voyager has six sound sources. Five of these (three voltage-controlled oscillators with switchable waveforms, a noise generator, and an external line input) pass to a mixer with independent level controls. The mixed {{output of the}} sources is then passed through the voltage-controlled filter and a <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>amplifier,</b> {{each of which has}} its own ADSR (Attack-Decay-Sustain-Release) envelope generator. The voltage-controlled filter can itself be made to oscillate, thus comprising the Voyager's sixth sound source.|$|R

Limitations as well as practical considerations of OTA based filters using commercially available bipolar OTAs are discussed. Applications of OTAs in continuous-time monolithic filters are considered...|$|R
50|$|The Taurus is monophonic, {{with its}} single voice {{generated}} by two oscillators running through one three-stage <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>amplifier.</b> For the Taurus I and Taurus III, only one waveform was available: a distorted sawtooth wave. The Taurus II introduced a second waveform, the pulse wave. All {{models of the}} Taurus use a 24db/octave resonant low pass filter with key tracking.

5000|$|The Little Brother had {{a single}} voltage {{controlled}} oscillator (VCO) with selectable waveforms, and a sub-octave divider that could produce up to three additional tones simultaneously at -1, -2 and -3 octave intervals. It also had an LFO, and a pitch bend/master tuning knob. However, it had no voltage controlled filter (VCF), voltage controlled <b>amplifier</b> (<b>VCA)</b> or envelope generator (EG or ADSR). When used with other ARP synths to [...] "fatten up" [...] their sounds, the Little Brother's audio output had to be patched into the external audio input of its companion synthesizer, essentially adding an extra VCO and LFO to the system.|$|R
50|$|Using this approach, Moog built a {{range of}} signal-generating, signal-modifying and {{controller}} modules, each {{of which could be}} easily inter-connected to control or modify the functions and outputs of any other. The central component was the voltage-controlled oscillator, which generated the primary sound signal, capable of producing a variety of waveforms including sawtooth, square and sine waves. The output from the VCO could then be modified and shaped by feeding the signal into other modules such as <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>amplifiers,</b> <b>voltage-controlled</b> filters, envelope generators, and ring modulators. Another customization as part of the Moog Modular Synthesizer is the sequencer, which provided a source of timed step control voltages that were programmed to create repetitive note patterns, without using the keyboard. The inputs and outputs of any module could be cross-linked with patch cords (using tip-sleeve ("mono") ¼-inch plugs) and, together with the module control knobs and switches, could create a nearly infinite variety of sounds and effects.|$|R
50|$|If one {{input of}} an analog {{multiplier}} is {{held at a}} steady state voltage, a signal at the second input will be scaled {{in proportion to the}} level on the fixed input. In this case the analog multiplier may be considered to be a voltage controlled amplifier. Obvious applications would be for electronic volume control and automatic gain control (AGC). Although analog multipliers are often used for such applications, <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>amplifiers</b> are not necessarily true analog multipliers. For example, an integrated circuit designed {{to be used as a}} volume control may have a signal input designed for 1 Vp-p, and a control input designed for 0-5 V dc; that is, the two inputs are not symmetrical and the control input will have a limited bandwidth.|$|R
50|$|To prevent {{digital signal}} {{overflow}} and its audible result, the digital output volume {{must be kept}} low enough so that bit 14 will never be used. On the first generation MT-32, this can simply be done by selecting a lower main volume on the unit's front panel, which directly controls the software main volume setting, which in turn directly translates into the amplitude of the digital output signal. On later generation units, this does not work, as the main volume knob and the software main volume setting only modify {{the volume of the}} analogue output using <b>voltage-controlled</b> <b>amplifiers</b> and have little effect on the amplitude of the digital signal. To prevent signal overflow, each individual part's volume (controller #7) must be kept low instead.|$|R
