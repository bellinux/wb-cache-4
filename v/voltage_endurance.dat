Hence, hydropower plants in Switzerland are in-creasingly selling peak energy in a liberalized European electrici-ty market. This development leads to higher start/stop-cycle frequencies of their hydrogenerators and some older machines are also subjected to more starts per year than they were origi-nally designed for. In consequence the high voltage insulation system in the stator conductor bars is stressed by a higher num-ber of thermal cycles which might shorten machine lifetimes sig-nificantly. In this paper a new test for assessing the impact of thermal cycling in modern mica/epoxy insulation systems is pre-sented. The new method isolates insulation aging exclusively caused by thermal cycling by the use of cycles with short heating intervals and a maximum temperature close to the glass transition point of the insulation system’s binder (epoxy) resin.

This work {{takes advantage of the}} large interfacial area between the matrix and the filler as a means to introduce chemistry that can further tailor the dielectric properties of the composite. Our studies show that particle dispersion as well as surface group chemistry contributes to property optimization. The large surface to volume ratio of the filler can be detrimental to dispersion as it can promote agglomeration. This obstacle is overcome by grafting polymer chains {{to the surface of the}} filler. Reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer, or RAFT polymerization, is utilized to graft polymer chains to the filler surface and control the molecular weight of the grafted polymer. Various electroactive small molecules (terthiophene, anthracene, and ferrocene) were synthesized and attached to the filler surface as well to create a bimodal type architecture. The filler consists of polyglycidyl methacrylate as matrix compatible long chains and short electroactive groups covalently attached to 15 nm silica nanoparticles.

Raman spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction are used for establishing the structural and compositional effects occurring under radiation. They have strong compositional dependence with the stoichiometric compositions being most stable showing less structural changes after radiation. These effects are associated with the availability of lone-pair electrons, their participation in the bonding configurations and the coupling of electron states in the bandgap.

It has been shown that addingnanoparticles to the EBA matrix changes the low frequency dispersion significantlyfor the dried samples. It was also indicated that the particle coatingused has very low impact on the resulting permittivity of the thoroughly driedsamples. From the dry DS studies it was suggested that the main cause ofthe scattering in data between the dry samples is most likely the influenceof the material inhomogeneity and possibly the moisture absorption. Thisleads to a possibility of using dielectric spectroscopy as a tool for probing thedispersion of nanoparticles in the polymer matrix.

40|$|Recent {{advancement}} {{in the field}} of thin film polymer insulations have brought limelight in the usage of bi-axially oriented dielectric thin films for high voltage capacitors and insulations. The reason of this popularity and extensive acceptance of bi-axially oriented thin films is their peculiar characteristics and optimum balance in the thermal, electrical and mechanical properties. Moreover, the demand of high energy density for capacitors and operation of dielectrics near breakdown voltage further prominent the importance of bi-axially oriented thin films as a dielectric material and insulation. In this thesis, the dielectric material under consideration is bi-axially oriented polypropylene (BOPP) thin film and its nanocomposite. BOPP has low dielectric loss with permittivity around 2. 2 and relatively high energy density because of the ability to operate near breakdown voltage because of self-healing property when used with in metallized electrodes. The focus of this thesis is to establish the optimum procedure of sample preparation of BOPP dielectric films for dielectric spectroscopy using Novocontrol device. It has been observed that thin film or the considered material behavior and characteristics vary with respect to the physical condition and potential stresses during experiments. Thus, to min-imize these stresses, various methods have been tried by varying different physical pa-rameters which are discussed in detail in chapter 5. An optimum testing procedure has also been proposed for precise experimental results. A detailed portion on estimating reliability and repeatability of the measurements has been introduced which tries to es-tablish the validity of measurements and comment on the possible sources of errors and uncertainties. After establishing the testing procedures, the next phase of the thesis includes the die-lectric characterization of BOPP and its nanocomposite. Since BOPP thin films can be customized by altering the polymer material composition resulting in nanocomposite and micro composites. The comparison of nanocomposites with respect to pure BOPP has also been made and explained. The effect of moisture and ambient humidity has been analyzed at different levels of relative humidity e. g. 0 %, 30 %, 75 %, 90 % and 100 % RH. The degradation of the dielectric properties of polymer due to moisture absorption is studied in Chapter 6. This chapter is also comprised of dielectric behavior of BOPP and its nanocomposite as a function of temperature, frequency and applied field. The operation of pure BOPP and its nanocomposite has been studied over a temperature range of - 60 °C to 130 °C. Moreover, the aging of BOPP w. r. t temperature has been ana-lyzed. The degradation of dielectric properties of thin film sample due to continuous application of wide range of temperatures from - 60 °C to 130 °C during temperature test has also been observed and discussed.

40|$|Discrete charge-trapping flash {{memories}} {{are more promising}} than their floating-gate counterparts due to their physically discrete-trapping and coupling-free nature. Si 3 N 4 is conventional material as charge-trapping layer (CTL) for charge storage. The shortcomings of Si 3 N 4 are its low dielectric constant and small barrier height at its interface with SiO 2 tunneling layer. Therefore, this research aims to investigate new materials as CTL for improving {{the performance of the}} memory devices. The charge-trapping characteristics of La 2 O 3 with and without nitrogen incorporation were investigated. Compared with the memory device with La 2 O 3 as CTL, the one with nitrided La 2 O 3 (LaON) showed larger memory window, higher program/erase (P/E) speeds and smaller charge loss, due to the nitrided La 2 O 3 film exhibiting less crystallized structure, higher trap density induced by nitrogen incorporation, and suppressed leakage by nitrogen passivation. In order to further improve the performance of the memory device with LaON CTL, a device with band-engineered LaTiON/LaON structure as CTL was also explored, and demonstrated to have better performance than the one with LaON CTL. This was ascribed to the variable tunneling path of charge carriers under P/E and retention modes (realized by the band-engineered charge-trapping layer), high trap density of LaTiON, and large barrier height at the LaTiON/SiO interface. SrTiO 3 and BaTiO 3,both ofwhich are typical perovskite-type dielectrics, also possess distinguished characteristics as CTL, including remarkably high dielectric constant and large conduction-band offset relative to SiO 2. The charge-trapping properties of SrTiO 3 with and without fluorine incorporation were studied. The device with fluorinated SrTiO 3 film showed promising performance in terms of higher P/E speeds at a low gate <b>voltage,</b> better <b>endurance</b> and data retention compared with that without fluorine treatment. These advantages were associated with generated deep-level traps, reduced leakage path, and enhanced strength of the film due to the highest electro-negativity of the fluorine atoms incorporated in the film. The charge-trapping properties of BaTiO 3 with and without Zr incorporation were also investigated, where Zr incorporated in BaTiO 3 could strengthen the dielectric film and improve its thermodynamic stability. The device with Zr incorporation exhibited similar memory window as the one without Zr incorporation, but higher program speed at low gate <b>voltage,</b> better <b>endurance</b> and data retention, due to the Zr-doped BaTiO 3 exhibiting higher charge-trapping efficiency and higher density of traps with deeper energy levels.

Moreover, compared with the device with Ga 2 O 3 NCs as CTL, the one with nitrided Ga 2 O 3 NCs showed larger memory window, higher operating speed and better data retention, mainly due to higher charge-trapping efficiency of the nitrided Ga 2 O 3 NCs and nitrogen-induced suppressed formation of interlayer at the Ga 2 O/SiO interface. published_or_final_versionElectrical and Electronic EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

It is shown that charge-retention time is longer, and program/erase (P/E) speeds are faster in doubly stacked devices than in single-layer devices, which seem to result from the optimization of device structure, the exclusion of unwanted defects {{due to the nature}} of UHV, and the suppression of charge leakage by the multiple barriers/NC layers in the doubly stacked devices. It is also found that the threshold <b>voltages</b> in the <b>endurance</b> characteristics anomalously increase with the P/E cycles, more strongly in the doubly stacked NC memories.

The device unit is composed of Al 2 O 3 /HfO 2 /Al 2 O 3 -based functional stacks on TiN-coated Si substrate. The cross-sectional HRTEM image and XPS depth profile of Al 2 O 3 /HfO 2 /Al 2 O 3 on TiN-coated Si confirm the existence of interfacial layers between trilayer structures of Al 2 O 3 /HfO 2 /Al 2 O 3 after 600 °C post-annealing. The memory units of Pt/Al 2 O 3 /HfO 2 /Al 2 O 3 /TiN/Si exhibit a typical bipolar, reliable, and reproducible resistive switching behavior, such as stable resistance ratio (> 10) of OFF/ON states, sharp distribution of set and reset <b>voltages,</b> better switching <b>endurance</b> up to 103  cycles, and longer data retention at 85 °C over 10  years.

40|$|Nonvolatile ferroelectric-gate field-effect {{transistors}} (Fe-FETs) memories with solution-processed ferroelectric polymers are {{of great}} interest because of their potential for use in low-cost flexible devices. In particular, {{the development of a}} process for patterning high-performance semiconducting channel layers with mechanical flexibility is essential not only for proper cell-to-cell isolation but also for arrays of flexible nonvolatile memories. We demonstrate a robust route for printing large-scale micropatterns of solution-processed semiconducting small molecules/insulating polymer blends for high performance arrays of nonvolatile ferroelectric polymer memory. The nonvolatile memory devices are based on top-gate/bottom-contact Fe-FET with ferroelectric polymer-insulator and micropatterned semiconducting blend channels. Printed micropatterns of a thin blended semiconducting film were achieved by our selective contact evaporation printing, with which semiconducting small molecules in contact with a micropatterned elastomeric poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) mold were preferentially evaporated and absorbed into the PDMS mold while insulating polymer remained intact. Well-defined micrometer-scale patterns with various shapes and dimensions were readily developed over a very large area on a 4 in. wafer, allowing for fabrication of large-scale printed arrays of Fe-FETs with highly uniform device performance. We statistically analyzed the memory properties of Fe-FETs, including ON/OFF ratio, operation <b>voltage,</b> retention, and <b>endurance,</b> {{as a function of the}} micropattern dimensions of the semiconducting films. Furthermore, roll-up memory arrays were produced by successfully detaching large-area Fe-FETs printed on a flexible substrate with a transient adhesive layer from a hard substrate and subsequently transferring them to a nonplanar surfaceclose 4...|$|R
40|$|Graphene {{and related}} {{materials}} (GRMs) are promising {{candidates for the}} fabrication of resistive random access memories (RRAM). Here, we analyze, classify and evaluate this emerging field, and summarize {{the performance of the}} RRAM prototypes using GRMs. Graphene oxide, amorphous carbon films, transition metal dichalcogenides, hexagonal boron nitride and black phosphorous can be used as resistive switching media, in which the switching can be governed either by the migration of intrinsic species or penetration of metallic ions from adjacent layers. Graphene can be used as electrode to provide flexibility and transparency, as well as an interface layer between the electrode and dielectric to block atomic diffusion, reduce power consumption, suppress surface effects, limit the number of conductive filaments in the dielectric, and improve device integration. GRMs-based RRAMs fit some non-volatile memory technological requirements like low operating <b>voltages</b> 10 years, <b>endurance</b> > 109 cycles and power consumption ~ 10 pJ/transition still remain a challenge. More technology-oriented studies including reliability and variability analyses may lead to the development of GRMs-based RRAMs with realistic possibilities of commercialization.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of the Flash memory devices in the past decades has translated into a constant shrinking of the floating gate transistors. This reduction of the device area will lead to cell planarization where the control gate no longer wraps the interpoly dielectric, causing an important loss of gate capacitance and an increment of the parasitic capacitance with neighboring cells. These problems may be solved by thinning down the interpoly dielectric, yielding to less parasitic coupling and larger gate capacity. However, {{in the near future}} it will not be possible to further thin down the dielectrics without compromising the retention of the memory devices, due to the exponential increase of the leakage currents when decreasing the thickness of the dielectrics. A solution to this problem can be to replace the actual dielectrics by high-k materials that will allow using physically thicker layers without diminishing the capacitances. However, normally the high-k materials present much larger densities of electrically active defects than the current SiO 2 -based dielectrics. These defects affect the retention, the threshold <b>voltage</b> stability, the <b>endurance</b> of the devices, etc. A deep understanding {{of the impact of the}} defects on the memory characteristics, their properties (density, location, charge) and their causes is thus crucial. This work presents a study of two high-k materials that could be used to replace the interpoly dielectric: Al 2 O 3 and HfAlO. First the impact of the fabrication conditions (thermal budget, PDA ambient, material precursor, composition) on the performance of floating gate devices is stated using standard figures of merit of the non-volatile memories, such as program and erase characteristics, retention and endurance. Physical analysis, simulations and other characterization techniques, such as the Stress I-V method, are presented as well, in order to obtain a more complete picture and relate the performance of the memories to the characteristics of the defects present in the layers. It is then concluded that, in order to further understand the impact of the defects on the memory characteristics, more elaborated defect-characterization techniques are needed. An evolved charge pumping technique, a new trap spectroscopy based on charging and sensing and the photo-depopulation technique are discussed in order to illustrate the state of the art in defect characterization. However, all these techniques present several problems such as very limited scanning range, or the need for complex structures in order to maximize its output. The author proposes a recently developed technique, together with a new physics model, to cope with the limitations of the other techniques and to help to further characterize the defects present in the high-k dielectrics. Using this new method, called two-pulse CV or 2 -PCV method, it is possible to obtain a more complete defect map than with the other techniques, since a wider area is scanned (in terms of distance in the dielectric as well as in energy range) using simple large area capacitors. The defect maps obtained from different crystalline-Al 2 O 3 layers show remarkable differences when the fabrication processes are modified. However, two sets of defects are always present: a uniform distribution of traps around 2 eV below the conduction band of the material, and deeper interfacial traps between the SiO 2 and the Al 2 O 3, around ~ 3 - 4 eV below the conduction band of the high-k material. The uniform defect distribution is attributed to the grain boundaries of the crystalline materials, rather than to oxygen or aluminum vacancies or impurities, in contrast with what is suggested in several publications. The deep interfacial defects, which are observed here for the first time, are attributed to impurities or intermixing of the Al 2 O 3 at the interface with the SiO 2 layer. These deep defects help to interpret several phenomena observed in the literature, which could not be easily explained so far. The study of the HfAlO reveals that the material is more affected than Al 2 O 3 by the fabrication processes, mainly the thermal budget, and by the composition of the material itself. The thermal budget can lead to total cell failure due to the large amount of defects created at the SiO 2 and gate interfaces, as revealed by the physical analysis, simulations and trap maps obtained with the 2 -PCV method. The conclusion is therefore that the newly proposed defect-characterization method (formed by the measurement mechanism and the physics model) is a strong tool in order to extract reliable information about the defects in dielectric layers and in order to make predictions about the material performance in memory devices.
