5|$|It is also {{possible}} to obtain a prenatal diagnosis for an embryo or fetus in the womb, using fetal genetic material acquired through chorionic <b>villus</b> sampling. An amniocentesis can be performed if the pregnancy is further along, within 14–18 weeks. This procedure looks at the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby for indicators of the HD mutation. This, too, can be paired with exclusion testing to avoid disclosure of parental genotype. Prenatal testing can be done when a parent has been diagnosed with HD, when they have had genetic testing showing {{the expansion of the}} HTT gene, or when they have a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. The parents can be counseled on their options, which include termination of pregnancy, and on the difficulties of a child with the identified gene.|$|E
25|$|Amniocentesis and {{chorionic}} <b>villus</b> sampling are procedures {{conducted to}} assess the fetus. A sample of amniotic fluid is obtained by the insertion of a needle through the abdomen and into the uterus. Chorionic <b>villus</b> sampling is a similar procedure {{with a sample of}} tissue removed rather than fluid. These procedures are not associated with pregnancy loss during the second trimester but they are associated with miscarriages and birth defects in the first trimester. Miscarriage caused by invasive prenatal diagnosis (chorionic <b>villus</b> sampling (CVS) and amniocentesis) is rare (about 1%).|$|E
25|$|During pregnancy, testing can be {{performed}} on the placenta (chorionic <b>villus</b> sampling) or the fluid around the fetus (amniocentesis). However, chorionic <b>villus</b> sampling has a risk of fetal death of one in 100 and amniocentesis of one in 200; a recent study has indicated this may be much lower, about one in 1,600.|$|E
25|$|Turner {{syndrome}} may {{be diagnosed}} by amniocentesis or chorionic <b>villus</b> sampling during pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|NF II can be {{diagnosed}} with 65% accuracy prenatally with chorionic <b>villus</b> sampling or amniocentesis.|$|E
25|$|Referral for {{counseling}} in a prenatal genetics clinic to discuss {{risks to the}} pregnancy (advanced maternal age, teratogen exposure, family history of a genetic disease), test results (abnormal maternal serum screen, abnormal ultrasound), and/or options for prenatal diagnosis (typically amniocentesis or chorionic <b>villus</b> sampling).|$|E
25|$|Prenatal diagnosis. If {{both parents}} are {{identified}} as carriers, prenatal genetic testing can determine whether the fetus has inherited a defective gene copy from both parents. Chorionic <b>villus</b> sampling (CVS), {{the most common form}} of prenatal diagnosis, can be performed between 10 and 14 weeks of gestation. Amniocentesis is usually performed at 15–18 weeks. These procedures have risks of miscarriage of 1% or less.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{excellent}} postnatal prognosis, 99% of Turner-syndrome conceptions {{are thought to}} end in miscarriage or stillbirth, {{and as many as}} 15% of all spontaneous abortions have the 45,X karyotype. Among cases that are detected by routine amniocentesis or chorionic <b>villus</b> sampling, one study found that the prevalence of Turner syndrome among tested pregnancies was 5.58 and 13.3 times higher, respectively, than among live neonates in a similar population.|$|E
25|$|Triple X {{syndrome}} can {{be diagnosed}} prenatally through amniocentesis or chorionic <b>villus</b> sampling. In Denmark, between 1970 and 1984, 76% of the prenatally diagnosed fetuses with triple-X were aborted. Between 1985-1987, this figure dropped to 56%. With improved information, {{the number of}} abortions diminished. In the Netherlands, between 1991 and 2000, 33% (18/54) of the couples that were confronted with a prenatal diagnosis of 47, XXX elected to abort. If balanced information is provided to prospective parents, prenatally, the incidence of voluntary termination (abortion) is reduced.|$|E
25|$|Whether {{the fetus}} is an {{affected}} girl {{can be determined}} by chorionic <b>villus</b> sampling at 9–11 weeks of gestation, or by amniocentesis at 15–18 weeks gestation. In each case the fetal sex can be determined quickly, and if the fetus is a male the dexamethasone can be discontinued. If female, fetal DNA is analyzed {{to see if she}} carries one of the known abnormal alleles of the CYP21 gene. If so, dexamethasone is continued {{for the remainder of the}} pregnancy at a dose of about 1mg daily.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis {{often can}} be made through {{clinical}} examination and urine tests (excess mucopolysaccharides are excreted in the urine). Enzyme assays (testing a variety of cells or body fluids in culture for enzyme deficiency) are also used to provide definitive diagnosis {{of one of the}} mucopolysaccharidoses. Prenatal diagnosis using amniocentesis and chorionic <b>villus</b> sampling can verify if a fetus either carries a copy of the defective gene or is affected with the disorder. Genetic counseling can help parents who {{have a family history of}} the mucopolysaccharidoses determine if they are carrying the mutated gene that causes the disorders.|$|E
25|$|To {{put this}} into a {{biological}} systems context, some physiology is required. In the gastrointestinal tract, epithelial cells proliferate and die rapidly. The division of these cells occurs {{at the base of}} villi, and cells are pushed upwards by subsequent divisions to the tip where they enter apoptosis and shed off into the lumen. Netrin-1 is produced in the base of the villi, so a gradient of netrin is present that is weakest at the tip. In normal physiology, the presence of netrin-1 inhibits DCC-mediated cell death until the epithelial cell reaches the tip of the <b>villus,</b> where the now unbound DCC causes the cell to enter apoptosis. In a cancer state, the absence of DCC prevents the gradient from having an effect on the cell, making it more likely to continue to survive.|$|E
25|$|Prenatal {{and other}} {{diagnostic}} techniques such as immunocytochemistry (ICC) evaluation are usually followed by FISH or Polymerase Chain Reaction to detect chromosomal aneuploidies. Maternal blood sampling for fetal cells, often used to identify risk of trisomies 18 or 21, poses less risk as compared to amniocentesis and chorionic villous sampling (CVS). Chorionic <b>villus</b> sampling utilizes placental tissue to give information about fetal chromosome status and has been used since the 1970s. In addition to CVS, amniocentesis {{can be used to}} obtain fetal karyotype by examining fetal cells in amniotic fluid. It was first performed in 1952 and became standard practice in the 1970s. The odds of having a child with polysomy increases as the age of the mother increases, so pregnant women over the age of 35 are tested.|$|E
25|$|Severe {{monogenic}} diseases {{for which}} prenatal diagnosis is more commonly applied to include cystic fibrosis, beta-thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, spinal muscular atrophy, myotonic dystrophy, fragile-X syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Hemophilia. Both autosomal dominant and recessive disorders {{have been detected}} noninvasively by analyzing paternally inherited DNA. Limitations to single gene disorders are autosomal recessive mutation or when the fetal autosomal dominant mutation is maternally inherited. There are also large sequence mutations that include duplication, expansion, insertion of DNA sequences. cffDNA is fragmented with 200-300bp in length, thus these are harder to detect. One example is achondroplasia, a common autosomal dominant form of dwarfism, caused by FGFR3 gene point mutations. Two pregnancies were examined in this study, one fetus {{was found to have}} the paternally inherited G1138A mutation and the other with a G1138A de novo mutation. Another example is the Huntington's disease. It is currently diagnosed at 10–13 weeks at gestation with chronic <b>villus</b> sampling for polymorphic repeats. With qRT-PCR, there has been detection of CAG repeats at 17, 20 and 24, all normal levels.|$|E
25|$|Prenatal diagnosis: Used {{to detect}} {{changes in a}} fetus's genes or {{chromosomes}} before birth. This type of testing is offered to couples with {{an increased risk of}} having a baby with a genetic or chromosomal disorder. In some cases, prenatal testing can lessen a couple's uncertainty or help them decide whether to abort the pregnancy. It cannot identify all possible inherited disorders and birth defects, however. One method of performing a prenatal genetic test involves an amniocentesis, which removes a sample of fluid from the mother’s amniotic sac 15 to 20 or more weeks into pregnancy. The fluid is then tested for chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome (Trisomy 21) and Trisomy 18, which can result in neonatal or fetal death. Test results can be retrieved within 7–14 days after the test is done. This method is 99.4% accurate at detecting and diagnosing fetal chromosome abnormalities. Although there is a risk of miscarriage associated with an amniocentesis, the miscarriage rate is only 1/400. Another method of prenatal testing is Chorionic <b>Villus</b> Sampling (CVS). Chorionic villi are projections from the placenta that carry the same genetic makeup as the baby. During this method of prenatal testing, a sample of chorionic villi is removed from the placenta to be tested. This test is performed 10–13 weeks into pregnancy and results are ready 7–14 days after the test was done. Another test using blood taken from the fetal umbilical cord is percutaneous umbilical cord blood sampling.|$|E

This new maternal blood test {{has the potential}} {{to reduce the number of}} women referred for invasive testing for Down's syndrome by 98 percent. Developed by Chinese researchers in Hong Kong in 2008, this is hailed as a breakthrough.|$|E

2500|$|These {{tests can}} also be {{performed}} prenatally to detect aneuploidy in a pregnancy, through either amniocentesis or chorionic <b>villus</b> sampling. [...] Pregnant women of 35 years or older are offered prenatal diagnosis because the chance of chromosomal aneuploidy increases as the mother's age increases.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{application}} of PCR was for genetic testing, where {{a sample of}} DNA is analyzed {{for the presence of}} genetic disease mutations. [...] Prospective parents can be tested for being genetic carriers, or their children might be tested for actually being affected by a disease. [...] DNA samples for prenatal testing can be obtained by amniocentesis, chorionic <b>villus</b> sampling, or even by the analysis of rare fetal cells circulating in the mother's bloodstream. [...] PCR analysis is also essential to preimplantation genetic diagnosis, where individual cells of a developing embryo are tested for mutations.|$|E

60|$|Section 30. The {{walls of}} {{the whole of the}} small {{intestine}} are engaged in the absorption of the soluble results of digestion. In the duodenum, especially, small processes, the villi project into the cavity, and being, like the small hairs of velvet pile, and as thickly set, give its inner coat a velvety appearance. In a <b>villus</b> we find (Figure IX., Sheet 3) a series of small blood-vessels and with it another vessel called a lacteal. The lacteals run together into larger and larger branches until they form a main trunk, the thoracic duct, which opens into the blood circulation at a point near the heart; but of this we shall speak further later. They contain, after a meal, a fluid called chyle.|$|E

5000|$|Intestinal villi (singular: <b>villus)</b> are small, finger-like {{projections}} {{that extend}} into the lumen {{of the small}} intestine. Each <b>villus</b> is approximately 0.5-1.6 mm in length (in humans), and has many microvilli projecting from the enterocytes of its epithelium which collectively form the striated or brush border. Each of these microvilli are much smaller than a single <b>villus.</b> The intestinal villi are much smaller {{than any of the}} circular folds in the intestine.|$|E
5000|$|The primary {{advantage}} of MaterniT21 PLUS {{over the other}} major high accuracy tests for Down syndrome, Amniocentesis and Chorionic <b>villus</b> sampling, is that MaterniT21 PLUS is noninvasive. [...] Because amniocentesis and chorionic <b>villus</b> sampling are invasive, {{they have a chance}} of causing miscarriage.|$|E
50|$|The {{circular}} folds {{slow the}} passage of the food along the intestines, and afford an increased surface for absorption. They are covered with small fingerlike projections called villi (singular, <b>villus).</b> Each <b>villus,</b> in turn, is covered with microvilli. The microvilli absorb fats and nutrients from the chyme.|$|E

50|$|There {{are also}} enzymes (enterocyte {{digestive}} enzyme) {{on the surface}} for digestion. <b>Villus</b> capillaries collect amino acids and simple sugars {{taken up by the}} villi into the blood stream. <b>Villus</b> lacteals (lymph capillary) collect absorbed chylomicrons, which are lipoproteins composed of triglycerides, cholesterol and amphipathic proteins, and are taken {{to the rest of the}} body through the lymph fluid.|$|E

50|$|It is {{possible}} to determine who the biological father of the fetus is while the woman is still pregnant through procedures called chorionic <b>villus</b> sampling or amniocentesis. Choronic <b>villus</b> sampling (CVS) retrieves choronic <b>villus</b> (placental tissue) in either a transcervical or transabdominal manner. Amniocentesis retrieves amniotic fluid by inserting a needle through the pregnant mother's abdominal wall. These procedures are highly accurate because they are taking a sample directly from the fetus; however, {{there is a small}} risk for the woman to miscarry and lose the pregnancy as a result. Both CVS and Amnio require the pregnant woman to visit a genetic specialist known as a maternal fetal medicine specialist who will perform the procedure.|$|E
