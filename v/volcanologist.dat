5|$|Harry Glicken (March 7, 1958– June 3, 1991) was an American <b>volcanologist.</b> He {{researched}} Mount St. Helens in the United States {{before and}} after its 1980 eruption, and blamed himself {{for the death of}} fellow <b>volcanologist</b> David A. Johnston, who had switched shifts with Glicken so that the latter could attend an interview. In 1991, while conducting avalanche research on Mount Unzen in Japan, Glicken and fellow volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft were killed by a pyroclastic flow. His remains were found four days later, and were cremated in accordance with his parents' request. Glicken and Johnston remain the only American volcanologists known to have died in volcanic eruptions.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogeologist Philip LaMoreaux {{asserted}} in 1995 {{that the}} eruption caused significant climatic {{changes in the}} eastern Mediterranean region, Aegean Sea {{and much of the}} Northern Hemisphere, but that was forcefully rebutted by <b>volcanologist</b> David Pyle a year later.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, Canadian <b>volcanologist</b> Catherine Hickson {{revealed}} that the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field {{is not part of}} the Anahim Volcanic Belt, but rather a separate centre that most likely represents an area of lithospheric decompression melting caused by rifting along pre-existing crustal fractures. The Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field has since not been considered part of the Anahim Volcanic Belt and the Anahim hotspot is now believed to be in the area of Nazko Cone.|$|E

5|$|Active for millennia, Mount Redoubt has erupted {{four times}} {{since it was}} first observed: in 1902, 1966, 1989 and 2009, with two {{questionable}} eruptions in 1881 and 1933. The eruption in 1989 spewed volcanic ash to a height of 45,000ft (14,000m). It caught KLM Flight 867, a Boeing 747 aircraft, in its plume. After the plane descended 13,000 feet, the pilots restarted the engines and landed the plane safely at Anchorage. The ash blanketed an area of about 7,700sqmi (20,000km2). The 1989 eruption is also notable for being the first ever volcanic eruption to be successfully predicted by the method of long-period seismic events developed by Swiss/American <b>volcanologist</b> Bernard Chouet. As of August 2015, the Alaska Volcano Observatory has rated Redoubt as Aviation Alert Level Green and Volcano Alert Level Normal.|$|E

5|$|Ancient Hawaiians {{were the}} first to {{recognize}} the increasing age and weathered state of the volcanoes to the north as they progressed on fishing expeditions along the islands. The volatile state of the Hawaiian volcanoes and their constant battle with the sea was a major element in Hawaiian mythology, embodied in Pele, the deity of volcanoes. After the arrival of Europeans on the island, in 1880–1881 James Dwight Dana directed the first formal geological study of the hotspot's volcanics, confirming the relationship long observed by the natives. 1912 marked the founding of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory by <b>volcanologist</b> Thomas Jaggar, initiating continuous scientific observation of the islands. In the 1970s, a mapping project was initiated to gain more information about the complex geology of Hawaii's seafloor.|$|E
5|$|Barry Voight (born 1937) is an American geologist, <b>volcanologist,</b> author, and engineer. He is {{also the}} brother of actor Jon Voight and {{songwriter}} Chip Taylor, and the uncle of actress Angelina Jolie. After completing a five-year intensive dual-degree program at the University of Notre Dame, Voight became a teaching assistant there while pursuing his master's degree. He then studied at Cornell University for a year before transferring to Columbia University, where he earned his Ph.D. in geology in 1965. Voight worked {{as a professor of}} geology at several universities, including Pennsylvania State University, where he taught from 1964 until his retirement in 2005; he remains an emeritus professor there. He still conducts research, focusing on rock mechanics, plate tectonics, disaster prevention, and geotechnical engineering.|$|E
5|$|Several {{volcanic}} {{features in}} the Mount Cayley field were illustrated by <b>volcanologist</b> Jack Souther in 1980, including Mount Cayley, Cauldron Dome, Slag Hill, Mount Fee, Ember Ridge and Ring Mountain, which was titled Crucible Dome at the time. This resulted {{in the creation of}} a geologic map that showed the regional terrain and locations of the volcanoes. The most detailed study of Mount Cayley took place during this period. Little Ring Mountain at the northernmost end of the field had not been studied at the time and was not included on Souther's 1980 map. Ember Ridge at the southern end of the field was originally mapped as a cluster of five lava domes. The sixth lava dome, Ember Ridge Northeast, was discovered by Ph.D. student Melanie Kelman during a period of research in 2001.|$|E

5|$|The massif was {{identified}} by the crash mapping program of Operation Stikine in 1956. This program, masterminded by Canadian <b>volcanologist</b> Jack Souther, was carried out over the Stikine River area using a Bell helicopter. Reconnaissance mapping in 1962 by Jack Souther and Hu Gabrielse identified a sequence of lavas of late Tertiary to Quaternary age. Level Mountain was then studied by T. S. Hamilton in the 1970s who produced a detailed map and the first petrochemical study of the lavas. The andesites described in the 1920s were mapped as early Tertiary age, long before Level Mountain formed. Hamilton recognized the four sequences of alkali basalt flows and tuffs in the lava plateau {{as well as the}} overlying bimodal package of alkali basalt and peralkaline lavas and tuffs.|$|E
5|$|Exposed {{along the}} Cheakamus River {{and its tributaries}} are the Cheakamus Valley basalts. Although not {{necessarily}} mapped {{as part of the}} Cayley field, this sequence of basaltic lava flows is geologically similar and comparable in age to volcanic features that are part of this volcanic field. At least four basaltic flows comprise the sequence and were deposited during periods of volcanic activity from an unknown vent between 0.01and 1.6million years ago. Pillow lava is abundant along the bases the flows, some of which are underlain by hyaloclastite breccia. In 1958, Canadian <b>volcanologist</b> Bill Mathews suggested that the lava flows were erupted during periods of subglacial activity and traveled through trenches or tunnels melted in glacial ice of the Fraser Glaciation. Mathews based this on the age of the underlying till, the existence of pillow lava close to the bottom of some lavas, indicating subaqueous volcanism, the columnar jointing {{at the edges of the}} lavas, indicating rapid cooling, and the absence of apparent palaeogeography.|$|E
5|$|In April 1980, Voight's {{publications}} on landslides and avalanches {{and other}} mass movements {{attracted the attention}} of Rocky Crandell of the United States Geological Survey (USGS), who asked him to look at a growing bulge on the Mount St. Helens volcano in the state of Washington. Voight foresaw the collapse of the mountain's north flank as well as a powerful eruption. His predictions came true when St. Helens erupted in May 1980; Voight was then hired by the USGS to investigate the debris avalanche that initiated the eruption. After his work at St. Helens brought him international recognition, Voight continued researching and guiding monitoring efforts at several active volcanoes throughout his career, including Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia, Mount Merapi in Indonesia, and Soufrière Hills, a volcano on the Caribbean island of Montserrat. For his research, publications, and disaster prevention work as a <b>volcanologist</b> and engineer, Voight has been honored with numerous awards, appointments, and medals.|$|E

5|$|Johnston {{spent the}} summer after college in the San Juan {{volcanic}} field of Colorado working with <b>volcanologist</b> Pete Lipman {{in his study of}} two extinct calderas. This work became the inspiration for the first phase of his graduate work at the University of Washington in Seattle, in which he focused on the Oligocene Cimarron andesitic volcanic complex in the western San Juans. Johnston's reconstruction of the eruptive history of the extinct volcanoes prepared him to study active volcanoes. Johnston's first experience with active volcanoes was a geophysical survey of Mount Augustine in Alaska in 1975. When Mount Augustine erupted in 1976, Johnston raced back to Alaska, shunting his former work on the Cimmaron Volcano into a master's thesis, and making Mount Augustine the focus of his Ph.D. work. He graduated in 1978 with his Ph.D., having shown that (1) the emplacement mechanism of the pyroclastic flows had changed over time, as they became less pumaceous, (2) the magmas contained high quantities of volatile water, chlorine, and sulfur, and (3) underground mixing of the felsic (silicic) magmas with less-viscous mafic (basaltic) magmas could have triggered eruptions. Mount Augustine was also the site of an early near-disaster for Johnston, when he became trapped on the mountain during an eruption after high winds grounded the first two evacuation aircraft.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, Canadian <b>volcanologist</b> Jack Souther {{gave the}} {{informal}} name Maitland volcanics {{for the remaining}} lava flows and volcanic plugs of Maitland Volcano. Evenchick et al. (2005) proposed Maitland Volcanics as a formal name for these volcanic rocks.|$|E
25|$|The overall flat-topped {{topography}} of Hoodoo Mountain led Canadian <b>volcanologist</b> Jack Souther to refer Hoodoo Mountain as a tuya, which are flat-topped, steep-sided subglacial volcanoes formed when lava erupts through a thick glacier or ice sheet. However, Hoodoo Mountain {{does not fit}} the normal tuya model because of its complex layering of rocks, although Hoodoo's unusual structure obviously results from frequent interactions between volcanic activity and Pleistocene ice sheets over the past 100,000years.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{examines}} the philosophy {{and evolution of}} volcanological science in recent years, particularly {{in relation to the}} growth of volcanic hazard and risk science. It uses the lens of Science and Technology Studies to examine the ways in which knowledge generation is controlled and directed by social forces, particularly during eruptions, which constitute landmarks in the development of new technologies and models. It also presents data from a survey of <b>volcanologists</b> carried out during late 2008 and early 2009. These data concern the felt purpose of the science according to the <b>volcanologists</b> who participated and their impressions of the most important eruptions in historical time. It demonstrates that <b>volcanologists</b> are motivated both by the academic science environment and by a social concern for managing the impact of volcanic hazards on populations. Also discussed are the eruptions that have most influenced the discipline and the role of scientists in policymaking on active volcanoes. Expertise in volcanology can become the primary driver of public policy very suddenly when a volcano erupts, placing immense pressure on <b>volcanologists.</b> In response, the epistemological foundations of volcanology are on the move, with an increasing volume of research into risk assessment and management. This requires new, integrated methodologies for knowledge collection that transcend scientific disciplinary boundaries...|$|R
