Indeed, Monsanto may have created (or resurrected) as many new questions as it answered, a phenomenon characteristic of most prior opinions in this area. At least {{part of the reason for}} this unsettled state is that, from the outset, the Supreme Court has been reluctant to apply a comprehensive analysis to vertical restraints of trade. Rather, in each case it has applied a simple principle or rule of thumb to a discrete aspect of the <b>vertical</b> <b>restraint</b> problem. Because of its piecemeal approach, the Court has failed to appreciate the incompatibility of these various principles. Hence, in each case one problem may have been resolved, but one or more new ones were created.

A model of the decision-making process in this situation based on the concept of cognitive appraisal of imminent threat is proposed here. The aim of the study reported here was to test this model by examining the patient, staff, and environmental factors {{associated with the use of}} horizontal (as opposed to <b>vertical)</b> <b>restraint.</b> Logistic regression analysis of secondary data on the first-recorded episode of restraint of 261 patients occurring over a three-year period (1999 - 2001) in an acute care psychiatric trust in the UK was conducted, followed by a ROC analysis of the discriminative ability of the derived model to predict horizontal restraint. It was found that patients admitted under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act, those committing self-harm, and those with unclear thoughts and increased vocal volume prior to the incident were more likely to be restrained horizontally. Older people, those with perceived rational causation such as bad news and personal gain, and those with no obvious warning signs were less likely to be restrained horizontally.

40|$|The Chicago School of {{antitrust}} {{analysis has}} exerted {{a strong influence}} over the law of <b>vertical</b> <b>restraints</b> {{in the past two}} decades, leading the Supreme Court to abandon much of its traditional hostility toward such agreements. Chicago 2 ̆ 7 s success has provoked a vigorous response from Populists, who support the traditional approach. Chicago, Populists claim, has improperly relied upon neoclassical price theory to inform the normative and descriptive assumptions that drive its analysis of trade restraints generally and of <b>vertical</b> <b>restraints</b> in particular. This reliance is misplaced, Populists assert, because the real world departs from that portrayed by price-theoretic models and, at any rate, the Congress that enacted the Sherman Act did not understand the price-theoretic concept of allocative efficiency that Chicagoans employ as their normative benchmark. Instead, Populists assert, Congress meant to ensure an open competitive process, free of the sort of coercive abridgments of trader freedom represented by <b>vertical</b> <b>restraints,</b> which manufacturers impose through an exercise of market power. As a result, Populists conclude that the Supreme Court should revert to its traditional hostility toward such agreements. In this Article, Professor Alan Meese demonstrates that the Populist critique of Chicago 2 ̆ 7 s prescriptions regarding <b>vertical</b> <b>restraints</b> is unfounded. As an initial matter, Chicago 2 ̆ 7 s descriptive approach to such agreements does not depend upon price theory, but instead upon the New Institutional Economics, which embraces many real world departures from price theoretic models. Moreover, even if one adopts the normative premise advanced by the Populists, that is, that coercive restraints should be condemned regardless of anticompetitive effect, {{there is no reason to}} repudiate recent developments in the law of <b>vertical</b> <b>restraints.</b> The New Institutional Economics demonstrates that <b>vertical</b> <b>restraints</b> can attenuate certain market failures that result from a manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s decision to rely upon dealers to distribute its goods. Contrary to the Populist assumption, ironically founded on price theory, that such arrangements are foisted on dealers through an exercise of market power, restraints that do, in fact, mitigate market failure can be the result of a purely voluntary process of contractual integration. Absent an empirical showing that most such agreements are not entered into voluntarily, or, in the alternative, a new definition of coercion, the Populist attempt to rehabilitate the traditional hostility toward <b>vertical</b> <b>restraints</b> must be rejected in favor of the sort of 2 ̆ 2 Rule of Reason 2 ̆ 2 approach advocated by many in the Chicago School...|$|R
