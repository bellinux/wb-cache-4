40|$|Pressure <b>controlled</b> <b>{{ventilation}}</b> is {{a common}} mode of ventilation used to manage both adult and pediatric populations. However, {{there is very little}} evidence that distinguishes the efficacy of pressure <b>controlled</b> <b>ventilation</b> over that of volume <b>controlled</b> <b>ventilation</b> in the adult population. This gap in the literature {{may be due to the}} absence of a consistent and systematic algorithm for managing pressure <b>controlled</b> <b>ventilation.</b> This article provides a brief overview of the applications of both pressure <b>controlled</b> <b>ventilation</b> and volume <b>controlled</b> <b>ventilation</b> and proposes an algorithmic approach to the management of patients receiving pressure <b>controlled</b> <b>ventilation.</b> This algorithmic approach highlights the need for clinicians to have a comprehensive conceptual understanding of mechanical ventilation, pulmonary physiology, and interpretation of ventilator graphics in order to best care for patients receiving pressure <b>controlled</b> <b>ventilation.</b> The objective of identifying a systematic approach to managing pressure <b>controlled</b> <b>ventilation</b> is to provide a more generalizable and equitable approach to management of the ICU patient. Ideally, a consistent approach to managing pressure <b>controlled</b> <b>ventilation</b> in the adult population will glean more reliable information regarding actual patient outcomes, as well as the efficacy of pressure <b>controlled</b> <b>ventilation</b> when compared to volume <b>controlled</b> <b>ventilation...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new <b>ventilation</b> <b>control</b> {{strategy}} applied to multiple spaces subject to variable occupancy. The strategy specified for real-time, online <b>ventilation</b> <b>control</b> takes advan-tage of uninitiated air from some overventilated spaces {{to be used}} as fresh outdoor air in order to reduce system energy use while maintaining the indoor air quality (IAQ) in each space. This proposed strategy maintains a supply CO 2 concentration setpoint low enough to dilute CO 2 generated by full occupancy in critical zones. The supply CO 2 concentration setpoint could be determined online using the monitored zone airflow rates. It is tested and evaluated by making comparisons with other known control strategies. An existing VAV system installed at the École de technologie supérieure is used to evaluate this new strategy. The outdoor air fraction and associated energy use of investigated <b>ventilation</b> <b>control</b> strategies are calculated using the VAV system component models that are developed and validated against the monitored data...|$|E

The survey aimed at investigating the current situation of sleeping thermal environment and bedroom air conditioning, in order to gather relevant background information to develop strategies for bedroom air conditioning in the subtropics. It focused on the use patterns and types of bedroom air conditioning systems used, human factors {{such as the use of}} bedding and sleepwear during sleep, preference for indoor air temperature settings in bedrooms, <b>ventilation</b> <b>control</b> at nighttime with room air conditioner (RAC) turned on, etc. The results of the survey showed that most of the respondents would prefer a relatively low indoor air temperature at below 24 °C.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{development}} and the evaluation of hybrid <b>ventilation</b> <b>control</b> strategies, using both natural and mechanical modes, in residential buildings using a graphical simulation tool. The description of a library of airflow components and macroscopic pollutants models used to simulate the demand controlled ventilation based on indoor pollutant concentrations is provided. The paper discusses the issue of implementation of <b>ventilation</b> <b>control</b> strategies based on occupancy and indoor air quality using “Stateflow ” and integration into thermal-airflow modelling using “Simulink”. The case study is a single family dwelling that is used within the European project RESHYVENT. Two demand control strategies {{have been developed for}} the hybrid ventilation system. Yearly simulations have been performed in four European climates using the SIMBAD Building and HVAC toolbox, for the evaluation of hybrid <b>ventilation</b> <b>control</b> strategies. The assessment criteria used, are related to indoor air quality, to thermal comfort, to energy consumption and to the stability of control strategies. This work shows the possibility of using a graphical simulation environment for thermal-airflow computation. It is applied to the assessment of hybrid ventilation systems and concludes that the latter can improve indoor air quality and to reduce fan energy consumption with respect to reference system while maintaining the same building energy consumption for heating...|$|E
40|$|There are {{a number}} of {{challenges}} arising from changes to regulations covering <b>ventilation</b> <b>control</b> devices in Queensland. There is a paucity of information on the appropriate selection and use of stopping and seals in mines. Compounding this until recently there was no prospect of the development of a full-scale test facility within Australia. The paper describes recent research undertaken to both develop, evaluate and calibrate a full-scale pressure test facility for <b>ventilation</b> <b>control</b> devices (VCD) within Australia, and examine a number of important aspects of stopping and seal performance, usage, design and application for the coal mining industry. A review of the safety of coal mining operations after the Moura Number 2 explosion resulted in changes to mining regulations in Queensland. Under the new regulations, <b>ventilation</b> <b>control</b> devices are required to be tested at “an internationally recognised mine testing explosion gallery ” to achieve pressure ratings of 14, 35, 70, 140 or 345 kPa.

30|$|The {{yields of}} some of the most toxic gases from {{unwanted}} fires (such as CO, HCN and some organic irritants) have been demonstrated to be directly related to the combustion conditions (Purser 2002). In the case of flaming combustion, one of the most important factors relating to the toxic product yield is the fuel/air ratio which, as defined earlier, can be expressed as an equivalence ratio (ϕ). As the availability of oxygen becomes lower in proportion to the amount of fuel, the yields of certain toxic gases will increase. In <b>ventilation</b> <b>controlled</b> fires (such as those occurring in a room, building or other enclosure), the yields of these gases from the flaming combustion of polyurethane foams generally follow the same trend. As a result of this, studies that use <b>ventilation</b> <b>controlled</b> conditions, such as those using the steady state tube furnace (ISO/TS 19700 2013), are more likely to give a realistic representation of these reduced oxygen environment fire conditions.|$|R

40|$|System dynamic {{simulation}} {{has been}} adopted to test and evaluate the local and supervisory control of air-conditioning systems for over twenty years, while the modeling of the space ventilation was usually simulated using perfect mixing models. However, the complete-mixing air model fails to consider the impact of non-uniform air temperature stratifications. This paper presents a CFD-based virtual test method for control and optimization of indoor environment by combining a ventilated room with a <b>ventilation</b> <b>control</b> system. The ventilated room and its dynamic <b>ventilation</b> <b>control</b> system are represented by a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model and models of the temperature sensor, PID controller and actuator and VAV damper model respectively. The ventilation and its control system are programmed using the user defined function program and interfaced with the CFD model. A space temperature offset model is developed to improve the accuracy of temperature measurement and control at the occupied zone as a virtual sensor. Case {{studies show that the}} <b>ventilation</b> <b>control</b> models can interoperate with the CFD simulation of the space online which presents a new application approach of CFD simulation for testing and developing control and optimal control strategy before a system is constructed practically. The use of the virtual sensor can effectively compensate the effect of non-uniform stratification on the temperature control and improve system control reliability in a mechanical ventilated room.

This paper identifies design parameters for fuzzy-based control of these staged {{ventilation systems}}.

Difficulties with implementation of conventional staged <b>ventilation</b> <b>control,</b> and the proposed fuzzy inference technique, arise because of the discontinuous nature of these highly non-linear systems.
