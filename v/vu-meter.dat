5000|$|The second version had a {{corrected}} keyboard but sacrificed {{the right}} SHIFT key. This version also added a cassette-player <b>VU-meter</b> and volume control, a very helpful feature in loading software from cassettes.|$|E
50|$|This IC was {{introduced}} by National Semiconductor in 1980 and is still available as of 2013 from Texas Instruments. There are also two variants of it produced, the only difference being using 3dB logarithmic (LM3915) or <b>VU-meter</b> (LM3916) scale.|$|E
50|$|The rise time, {{defined as}} {{the time it takes}} for the needle to reach 99% of the {{distance}} to 0 VU when the <b>VU-meter</b> is submitted to a signal that steps from 0 to a level that reads 0 VU, is 300 ms.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The Organ and Augmented Reality (ORA) {{project has}} been {{presented}} to public audiences at two immersive concerts, with both visual and audio augmentations of an historic church organ. On the visual side, the organ pipes displayed a spectral analysis of the music using visuals inspired by LED-bar <b>VU-meters.</b> On the audio side, the audience was immersed in a periphonic sound field, acoustically placing listeners inside the instrument. The architecture of the graphical side of the installation is made of acoustic analysis and calibration, mapping from sound levels to animation, visual calibration, real-time multi-layer graphical composition and animation. It opens new perspectives to musical instrument augmentation where {{the purpose is to}} make the instrument more legible while offering the audience enhanced artistic content...|$|R
5000|$|Lyrically, [...] "The Witch" [...] was {{originally}} {{intended to be a}} composition about a local dance craze; however, it was re-written to describe a tale of a treacherous female. The song is also marked by its pounding, stop-start melody, and a relentlessly aggressive tempo. One music critic writing for Penn's Picks advises listeners to take notice to [...] "how Gerry Roslie’s raw, gravly vocals, Larry Parypa’s 'dark, overdriven' guitar (that rivals Dave Davies in tone) and Rob Linds raw saxophone work in perfect unison with one another in creating one hell on an intense song". Recording in Ormsby's Audio Recording Studio in Seattle, Washington, the Sonics were only satisfied when all the <b>VU-meters</b> were continuously in the red, much to the dismay of the sound engineers.|$|R
5000|$|A {{volume unit}} (VU) meter or {{standard}} volume indicator (SVI) is a device displaying {{a representation of}} the signal level in audio equipment. The Acoustical Society of America standardized it in 1942 (ANSI C16.5-1942) for use in telephone installation and radio broadcast stations. Consumer audio equipment often features VU meters, both for utilitarian purposes (e.g. in recording equipment) and for aesthetics (in playback devices).The original VU meter is a passive electromechanical device, namely a 200 µA DC d'Arsonval movement ammeter fed from a full wave copper-oxide rectifier mounted within the meter case. The mass of the needle causes a relatively slow response, which in effect integrates the signal, with a rise time of 300 ms. 0 VU is equal to +4 dBu, or 1.228 volts RMS, a power of about 2.5 milliWatts when applied across a 600 ohm load. 0 VU {{is often referred to as}} [...] "0 dB". The meter was designed not to measure the signal, but to let users aim the signal level to a target level of 0 VU (sometimes labelled 100%), so it is not important that the device is non-linear and imprecise for low levels. In effect, the scale ranges from −20 VU to +3 VU, with −3 VU right in the middle. Purely electronic devices may emulate the response of the needle; they are <b>VU-meters</b> in as much as they respect the standard.|$|R
50|$|The <b>VU-meter</b> was {{originally}} developed in 1939 by the combined effort of Bell Labs and broadcasters CBS and NBC. In the 1970s-80s, neon-filled, planar dual display dekatrons {{with up to}} 201 segments per stereo channel were popular among broadcasters as fast bar graph VU meters.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>VU-meter</b> (intentionally) [...] "slows" [...] measurement, {{averaging}} out {{peaks and}} troughs of short duration, and reflects more the perceived loudness of the material than the more modern and initially more expensive PPM meters. For this reason many audio practitioners prefer it to its alternatives, though the meter indication does not reflect {{some of the key}} features of the signal, most notably its peak level, which in many cases, must not pass a defined limit.|$|E
50|$|By 1980, ABC {{had about}} 100 PPMs {{in use in}} control rooms in New York and its Washington News Bureau, and was {{ordering}} new consoles with PPMs fitted. These were Type II PPMs with the seven marks labelled −22, −16, −12, −8, −4, 0 and +4. ABC found that {{a modified version of}} the EBU meter based on the <b>VU-meter</b> 'A scale' was best, since it let operators use their usual jargon such as 'zero level' etc. The appearance is similar to an EBU scale except that the numbers are 8 dB lower.|$|E
5000|$|The F760X 'Compex' limiter {{was made}} up of three main parts; a compressor, limiter and a 'noise reducing' expander/gate. All of these parts could be used {{separately}} or together for well controlled sound limiting. This combination came about from client feedback. From the feedback ADR designed and built the first units, these were labelled as F760X-RS (RS meaning rack-mount stereo). Later modifications were made and another version was released with a better, ergonomically designed, front panel. This later model was labelled as the 'Compex'.The 'Compex' limiter provided peak limiting with a multi-ratio, variable threshold compressor. Ratio settings ranged from 1:1 to 20:1 and there were controls for threshold and release time. The inclusion of an expander/gate provided attenuation of the gain during pauses in the audio signal to reduce noise caused by compression; the expander/gate could also be used for special 'punchy' effects, favoured on drum and percussive sounds. Noise gates were often criticised at the time for 'hunting' around the threshold point. The 'Compex' used clever hysteresis around the gate, this was important to stop unpredictable opening and closing of the gate; the open threshold was higher than the close threshold.The gain reduction controlled by the 'Compex' was monitored from two meters located {{to the right of the}} front panel. There were two light indicators; a red light lit when the signal level reached its peak, and when in expand mode a green light was lit. There were a set of lights for each channel, depending if the unit was the stereo or mono version.There were some different models of the 'Compex' available; one of these included a smaller console module named the F760-N. This version was built without the expander/gate, it later had an expander/gate added and was then known as the F760X-N. There is also a rare version called F760X-RS/T. One of the visible differences are the <b>VU-meters,</b> which got the brand [...] "Audio & Design Recording LTD." [...] and if you look on the rear, there you can see the type.The [...] "T" [...] stands for transformer, which are said to add harmonics to the sound.The [...] "T" [...] version was mainly used in broadcasting stations, mainly because of its SNR and headroom. ADR also built an F760 version for the Helios mixing consoles.|$|R
50|$|Studio Session is a 1986 {{software}} program for Macintosh computers, for music creation and playback. It {{was created by}} Macintosh and Newton pioneer Steve Capps and musician Ed Bogas. The program was published by Impulse, Inc..The software differed from other audio creation packages as it used 8-bit audio samples of real instruments rather than sounds generated by the Macintosh sound chip, as did packages such as MusicWorks and Deluxe Music Construction Set (DMCS). It was capable of playing back 6 tracks simultaneously in the original version, updated later to 8. There were two modes or screens, the authoring screen and the playback-only screen. In the authoring screen, the user entered notes on a staff with treble and bass clef using the mouse, and selecting {{the duration of the}} note with on-screen buttons or keyboard shortcuts.In the playback screen, an animated simulation of a <b>VU-meter</b> was displayed for each track.|$|E
50|$|Note {{that the}} {{specification}} mentions only sinusoid waveforms. Given the electromechanical {{principle of the}} meter, the deviation of the needle is actually approximately proportional to {{the average of the}} part of the signal with more than approximately 0.4 V instantaneously because of the two copper-oxide rectifiers always in series, which transfer function curve has a knee around 0.2 V. Signals generally do not have a sinusoidal waveform by far, even if they all fall within the <b>VU-meter</b> bandpass. The reading is the average of the voltage, and is not an indication {{of the power of the}} signal, which is proportional to the average of the square of the voltage, or the root-mean-square (RMS) value. As a conventional VU reading, however, it served its purpose as an indication a) of the overall level and dynamics of the signal and b) of the proximity to the maximum admitted level, to the operators of recording and broadcasting equipment. Maintenance staff could also use it as a measurement apparatus, to check for losses in transmissions and level alignment, provided that they used exclusively sine waves as test signals.|$|E
