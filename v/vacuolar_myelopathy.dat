40|$|The {{post-mortem}} pathology in 20 spinal cords {{of human}} immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients with <b>vacuolar</b> <b>myelopathy</b> was quantified by evaluating (i) the intensity of myelin change, vacuolation and macrophage density; and (ii) the areas of white matter covered by each feature. Severity scores were constructed for (i) the anterior, lateral, and posterior white matter columns; (ii) each level of spinal cord; and (Hi) the whole spinal cord [Cord Total and Cord Average Severity Scores (CTSS, CASS) ]. Astroglial activation was scored separately. In 14 cords with mild-moderate <b>vacuolar</b> <b>myelopathy</b> (CASS = 23 - 259), macrophages were the most prominent pathological feature, and level severity scores were higher at mid-thoracic than cervical levels (P = 0. 009).

40|$|Unless {{treated with}} {{effective}} antiretroviral therapy many AIDS patients develop a characteristic <b>vacuolar</b> <b>myelopathy</b> of {{the spinal cord}} associated with moderate clinical disability. Opinion is divided as to whether <b>vacuolar</b> <b>myelopathy</b> is causally linked to HIV myelitis. To investigate this further, spinal cord pathology was assessed in 41 drug users, 33 homosexual men and 16 other patients, all with AIDS. Previous work has shown that HIV encephalitis {{is more common in}} Edinburgh drug users than in homosexual men. In the present study HIV myelitis (10 % overall) was more common in drug users (17 %) than in homosexual men (3 %) (P = 0. 05), whereas the incidence of opportunistic infections (7 % v. 9 %) and lymphomas (2 % v. 6 %) was comparable in the two groups, but with a slight trend in the reverse direction, reflecting similar findings in the brain. However, moderate or severe <b>vacuolar</b> <b>myelopathy</b> was equally represented in both groups (20 % of drug users and 21 % of homosexual men). The HIV proviral load, assessed by polymerase chain reaction in frozen samples of thoracic spinal cord in 37 cases, correlated closely with the presence of giant cells and/or with immunocytochemical evidence of productive HIV infection. In 13 cases, the proviral load was measured in cervical, thoracic and lumbar samples and proved to be uniformly high or low in individual cases.

40|$|To the Editor: The {{isolation}} of the retrovirus human T-cell lymphotropic virus Type III (HTLV-III) from brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerve, and cerebrospinal fluid, as reported by Ho et al. (Dec. 12 issue), 1 provides substantial support for the theory that this virus is neurotropic as well as lymphotropic. The authors report the {{isolation of}} HTLV-III from the lumbar spinal cord of a patient (their Patient 10) who had pathologically verified <b>vacuolar</b> <b>myelopathy,</b> 2 and they conclude that the <b>vacuolar</b> <b>myelopathy</b> {{may have been a}} direct result of HTLV-III infection.

40|$|Spinal cord {{disease is}} common in {{patients}} infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1), and a characteristic <b>vacuolar</b> <b>myelopathy</b> is present at autopsy in approximately one-fourth of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients. Pathologic examination of the spinal cord shows vacuolation of white matter and infiltration by macrophages, a process distinct from HIV- 1 encephalopathy. To determine the presence and localization of HIV- 1 RNA in the spinal cords of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients with <b>vacuolar</b> <b>myelopathy,</b> we used the technique of combined in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical staining on the same slide. Spinal cord tissue sections were stained with markers for macrophages, endothelial cells, oligodendroglia, astrocytes, and myelin and then hybridized in situ with HIV- 1 -specific RNA probes. Combined in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical staining on three spinal cords showed HIV- 1 expression in mononuclear and multinucleated macrophages localized mainly to areas of myelopathy in spinal cord white matter. Immunohistochemical staining and electron microscopy showed myelin within macrophages and electron microscopy revealed HIV- 1 budding from macrophages. These data suggest a role for HIV- 1 -infected macrophages locally in the pathogenesis of <b>vacuolar</b> <b>myelopathy</b> {{and add to the}} body of evidence that these cells play a role systemically in the development of HIV- 1 -related disease...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{human immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) pathogenesis in infected individuals and examine the correlation of HIV- 1 expression with extent of clinical and pathologic disease, we studied spinal cords from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients {{with a wide range}} of spinal cord pathology. By performing in situ hybridization with HIV- 1 -specific riboprobes, we detected HIV- 1 RNA in all 10 cords from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients with a common, characteristic pathologic entity called <b>vacuolar</b> <b>myelopathy</b> but not in 10 control cords from HIV- 1 -infected and uninfected patients. In the cords from individuals with <b>vacuolar</b> <b>myelopathy,</b> the level of HIV- 1 RNA expression correlated directly with extent of spinal cord pathology and clinical findings.

40|$|Certain {{aspects of}} the {{clinical}} syndrome of dementia, cerebral atrophy, predominantly sensory neuropathy, and <b>vacuolar</b> <b>myelopathy</b> in AIDS resemble those seen in vitamin B 12 deficiency. Pathologically, there are similarities {{not only in the}} changes in the spinal cord, but also in the brain and peripheral nerves. The pathogenesis of <b>vacuolar</b> <b>myelopathy</b> may be secondary to a combination of immune mediated myelin and oligodendrocyte injury, and simultaneous impairment of repair mechanisms due to a deficiency of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). Products derived from macrophages may interfere directly with the methyl transfer cycle through the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates and reactions involving nitric oxide and peroxynitrite which may limit the supply of methionine for conversion to SAM, both by direct interaction as well as through inhibition of methionine synthase. Macrophage activation with secretion of cytokines and other biologically reactive substances within the nervous system is sustained in the late stages of HIV infection by the general effects of immune depletion, including loss of T cells (with concomitant reduction of macrophage regulatory molecules) and recurrent opportunistic infections, and may be further augmented by the local presence of the virus itself (or its surface glycoprotein gp 120). This would account for the common, but not exclusive, occurrence of <b>vacuolar</b> <b>myelopathy</b> in AIDS. The ability of the virus and its products to stimulate macrophage and microglial activation may also explain the association between severity ofvacuolar myelopathy and the presence of HIV encephalitis. A similar mechanism may underlie the pathogenesis of dementia, cerebral atrophy, and peripheral neuropathy. Local factors or differential susceptibility between the central and peripheral nervous system may determine whether myelinotoxic or neurotoxic processes predominate; the prominence of myelin involvement in the spinal cord, and axonal involvement peripherally may reflect both ends of this range, with the brain manifesting a more equal balance of both processes. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{central nervous}} system (CNS) and the immune system are {{considered}} major target organs for HIV infection. The neurological manifestations directly related to HIV are acute viral meningitis, chronic meningitis, HIV associated dementia, <b>vacuolar</b> <b>myelopathy</b> and involvement of the peripheral nervous system. Changes in diagnosis and clinical management have changed the aspect of HIV infection {{so that it is}} no longer a fatal disease, and has become a chronic disease requiring sustained medical management. After HAART the incidence of most opportunistic infections, including those affecting the CNS, has dropped markedly. Some studies suggest that neurological involvement of infected patient occur with different frequency, depending on HIV subtype involved in the infection. Subtype C may have reduced neuroinvasive capacity, possibly due to its different primary conformation of HIV transactivating regulatory protein (Tat), involved in monocyte chemotaxis.

40|$|<b>Vacuolar</b> <b>myelopathy</b> (VM) is a {{frequent}} central nervous system complication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) infection. We report here that transgenic (Tg) mice expressing even low levels of Nef in oligodendrocytes under the regulation of the myelin basic protein (MBP) promoter (MBP/HIVNef) developed VM similar to the human disease in its appearance and topography. The spinal cords of these Tg mice showed lower levels of the myelin proteins MAG and CNPase and of the 21 -kDa isoform of MBP prior {{to the development of}} vacuoles. In addition, Tg oligodendrocytes in primary in vitro cultures appeared morphologically more mature but, paradoxically, exhibited a less mature phenotype based on O 4, O 1, CNPase, and MBP staining. In particular, mature CNPase+ MBP+ Tg oligodendrocytes were less numerous than non-Tg oligodendrocytes. Therefore, Nef appears to affect the proper differentiation of oligodendrocytes. These data suggest that even low levels of Nef expression in human oligodendrocytes may be responsible for the development of VM in HIV- 1 -infected individuals...|$|E
40|$|HIV-infected {{patients}} are at markedly {{increased risk for}} neurological dysfunction, which may occur at any level of the neuraxis (see Table 1). The most common syndromes- AIDS dementia complex, <b>vacuolar</b> <b>myelopathy,</b> and possibly distal symmetric peripheral neuropathy- appear {{to be related to}} HTV infection within the nervous system, rather than due to the immunoincompe-tence caused by HIV. However, the mechanism(s) by which HIV causes these syndromes, e. g., infecting neurons or oligodendroglia directly, interfering with neurotrophic factors, effecting toxic monokine production, etc., is unknown. Early, albeit incomplete, success with azido-thymidine is encouraging. Less commonly, neurological syndromes may be secondary to the immunoincompetence produced by HIV. Many different etiologies- most of which are treatable- have been encoun-tered, but a few of these (cerebral toxoplasmosis, cryptococcal meningitis, primary CNS lym-phoma, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy) are responsible for most of the opportunistic complications. Marked differences in symptoms and signs between AIDS patients and immunologically normal patients may complicate recognition of some of these diseases (e. g., herpes simplex encephalitis). Finally, some HIV-associated syndromes, e. g., inflammatory demyelinating polyradi-culoneuropathy and retinal raicrovasculopathy, are of unknown etiology...|$|E
40|$|The wide {{usage of}} highly active {{antiretroviral}} therapy (HAART) leads to {{reduction of the}} occurence rate of focal or diffuse neurological damage caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, which prominently improves the living quality of HIV-infected patients. Despite this progress, about 70 % of HIV-infected patients develop neurological complications. Although neurological disease typically occurs in the advanced stage of the disease or after severe damage of immune functions, it may also occur during early stage of the infection. HIV-associated myelopathy is a common complication of immunodeficiency syndrome and its typical pathological appearence is vacuolar degeneration. In many patients the clinical manifestations of <b>vacuolar</b> <b>myelopathy</b> are in fact limited to non-specific sphincter or sexual dysfunction, and may remain completely asymptomatic.

40|$|Infection {{with the}} AIDS virus itself (HIV, HTLV-III, LAV, ARV) is {{associated}} with a full spectrum of neurological disorders. The application of diagnostic studies for HTLV-III infection has demonstrated that these neurologic disorders can be the first manifestation of AIDS or occur in the absence of AIDS. The most common conditions associated with HTLV-III infection alone are a subacute encephalopathy (AIDS dementia) and peripheral neuropathy; however, <b>vacuolar</b> <b>myelopathy</b> and both acute and chronic aseptic meningitis are also common. Congenital (or neonatal) transmission of the virus can result in a mental retardation syndrome of delayed onset. The AIDS virus is neurotropic as well as targeting T-helper lymphocytes. The virus has been readily identified in neural tissues and cerebrospinal fluid, including instances in which other central nervous system infections, such as toxoplasmosis, coexist. Hence, recognition of an appropriate syndrome, neurodiagnostic studies, and exclusion (or treatment) of other infections, as well as evidence for HTLV-III infection are required for diagnosis. The development of successful therapy will require agents which cross the blood-brain barrier.

40|$|The {{central nervous}} system (CNS) has been {{examined}} at autopsy in 89 patients who died of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), including 14 patients who died primarily of neurologic complications of the disease. A total of 66 brains (74 %) showed significant pathologic abnormalities, with opportunistic infections including cytomegalovirus (14) and cryptococcal (11) infections, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (6), toxoplasmosis (6), and histoplasma microabscesses (1). Incidental Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare infection was found in 4 cases. Simultaneous CNS infection {{by more than one}} microorganism was encountered in 5 patients. Subacute (microglial nodule) encephalitis-related to cytomegalovirus infection or possibly brain infection by the causative agent of AIDS was present in 56 cases. Primary CNS lymphoma was noted in 3 patients. Secondary CNS deposits of lymphoma were found in 1 patient, and another patient had lymphomatoid granulomatosis. Vascular complications were not infrequently seen, and included infarcts secondary to vessel occlusion and disseminated intravascular coagulation in 4 patients and intracranial hemorrhage of variable severity in 13. White matter changes included <b>vacuolar</b> <b>myelopathy</b> (3 cases), central pontine myelinolysis (1 case), and foci of calcified, necrotizing leukoencephalopathy in pontocerebellar fibers of the basis pontis (2 cases).

40|$|Myeloneuropathy is a {{frequently}} encountered {{condition and}} often poses a diagnostic challenge. A variety of nutritional, toxic, metabolic, infective, inflammatory, and paraneoplastic disorders can present with myeloneuropathy. Deficiencies of vitamin B 12, folic acid, copper, and vitamin E {{may lead to}} myeloneuropathy with a clinical picture of subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Among infective causes, chikungunya virus {{has been shown to}} produce a syndrome similar to myeloneuropathy. <b>Vacuolar</b> <b>myelopathy</b> seen in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is clinically very similar to subacute combined degeneration. A paraneoplastic myeloneuropathy, an immune-mediated disorder associated with an underlying malignancy, may rarely be seen with breast cancer. Tropical myeloneuropathies are classified into two overlapping clinical entities — tropical ataxic neuropathy and tropical spastic paraparesis. Tropical spastic paraparesis, a chronic noncompressive myelopathy, has frequently been reported from South India. Establishing the correct diagnosis of myeloneuropathy is important because compressive myelopathies may pose diagnostic confusion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord typically reveals characteristic signal changes on T 2 -weighted images of the cervical spinal cord. Once the presence of myeloneuropathy is established, all these patients should be subjected to a battery of tests. Blood levels of vitamin B 12, folic acid, vitamins A, D, E, and K, along with levels of iron, methylmalonic acid, homocysteine, and calcium should be assessed. The pattern of neurologic involvement and results obtained from a battery of biochemical tests often help in establishing the correct diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|Infectious human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) was recovered from 30 of 48 cerebrospinal fluid specimens from seropositive persons with and without neurologic symptoms or disease. Of 16 patients with only neurologic problems or other HIV-related conditions, but not the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), 11 had virus recovered; over half of those with AIDS also had virus isolated. Patients with headache or altered mental status had the highest recovery rate of HIV from cerebrospinal fluid. Although virus was primarily found in patients with detectable neurologic disease, it was also isolated from 5 of 8 patients with normal neurologic examinations. Two of these patients had fever alone. The presence of virus in cerebrospinal fluid did not necessarily correlate with isolation of virus from the serum. These findings suggest that HIV may at times replicate preferentially {{in the brain and}} that its presence may not immediately cause neurologic signs or symptoms. N E U R O L O G I C COMPLICATIONS are being recognized with increasing frequency in persons infected with the {{human immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) (1). The evidence sug-gests that HIV itself is responsible for the subacute en-cephalopathy, polyneuropathy, and <b>vacuolar</b> <b>myelopathy</b> seen in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (2).
