40|$|The {{operation}} of air-cooled chillers accounts for significant energy consumption in local commercial buildings, and low operational efficiency especially under partial load conditions and poor control {{are part of}} reasons for such huge energy consumption. Chiller efficiency can be improved by enhancing heat transfer rate in condensers. This paper considers how the chiller performance can be improved by using water mist to pre-cool ambient air entering the condensers to decrease compressor power. A simulation analysis on an air-cooled chiller equipped with a water mist pre-cooling system under head pressure control shows that applying water mist precooling enables the coefficient of performance (COP) to increase. Variable condensing temperature control is superior to head pressure control, where condenser effectiveness is enhanced by staging all condenser fans to decrease the condensing temperature. When the chiller with a water mist pre-cooling system operates under condensing temperature control, the analysis indicates that the COP improvements would be more considerable.

40|$|New {{innovations}} and integrations {{of existing}} cooling methods {{are needed to}} enable high performance operation of high power electronic equipment. Air-cooled solutions are attractive due to their simplicity; however these solutions are normally limited to low power dissipation rates. Through a novel design and integration of a blower and a compact heat exchanger, low thermal resistance and high efficiency heat transfer can be achieved. This device combines the increased surface area of a finned geometry with the isothermal heat transfer of a heat pipe and the low speed operation of integrated fan blades to dissipate 1000 W using 30 W of input electrical power in a 10 x 1 Ox 10 cm 3 volume. This thesis focuses on the design and experimental validation of the 2. 5 mm thick, 200 cm 2 surface area flat plate condenser repeated in parallel in the loop heat pipe structure. The condenser was designed to ensure even mass flow distribution and phase-separation within each layer. To better understand the physics and governing parameters within the thin geometry of the condenser, an experimental setup was designed and fabricated that allowed for visualization and measurement of the condensing flow. Experimental studies were conducted to explore condensation within open and sinter channel geometries while varying flow rate, backside cooling, and gravitational orientation. Open channel flow exhibited sensitivity to cooling heat transfer and orientation resulting in a <b>variable</b> <b>condensing</b> length connected to {{a sharp drop in}} surface temperature and gravity-dominated flow patterns. In contrast, testing with sinter wick in the channel demonstrated an isothermal surface over the length of the condenser and gravitationally independent flow stability due to separation of the liquid and vapor phases. The addition of a sub-cooling length within the sinter channel was shown to retain high isothermal temperatures upstream while reducing condensate temperature below saturation before the condenser outlet. However, to prevent large pressure drops incurred by flow through the sinter, balance is required between desired sub-cooling and sinter permeability. This work demonstrates the potential for a condenser design with a sintered wick and a sub-cooling section to mitigate the failure modes of parallel condensers. These results serve as guidelines for the continued development of the parallel plate condensers for the loop heat pipe integrated into the compact heat exchanger. by Catherine Helene Koveal.

Ukraine has a number of fields Bioactive Water Type “Naftussya” focused on the Ukrainian Carpaty: Truskavets’, Skhidnytsya, Shklo, Mrazhnytsya, Opaka, Mizun’, Selyatyn, Guta etc and Podillya: Sataniv, Husyatyn, Makiv etc. Until now conducted comparative studies of their effects only on clinical symptoms as well as excretion of urine and bile. The aim of this study – compare immediate effects of Bioactive Water Naftussya from layers Truskavets’, Pomyarky and Skhidnyts’a on neuro-endocrine-immune complex. Methods. The object of observation were 15 volunteers-men without clinical diagnose but with moderate disfunction of neuroendocrine-immune complex (disadaptation). In basal conditions and after drinking Control (distillated, filtered, well) and Bioactive Waters recorded EEG (“NeuroCom Standard”) and HRV (“Cardiolab+VSR”). In blood counted up Leukocytogram, on the basis of which determined Popovych’s Adaptation Index and Strain Index. In serum of venous blood determined content of principal adaptation Hormones: Cortisol, Testosterone and Triiodothyronine (ELISA) as well as Na+ and K+ (flaming photometry) for evaluation of Mineralocorticoide activity. Immune status evaluated on a set of I and II levels recommended by the WHO. Results. Observed cohort characterized disadaptation documented high frequentlyties of Disharmonious General Adaptation Reactions (53, 7 %) as well as Distress (11, 1 %), decreased Popovych’s Adaptation Index, plasma level of Triiodothyronine, Vagal tone, Completeness of Phagocytose, blood level of “Active”, Theophilline resistance and CD 4 + T-Lymphocytes, CD 16 + NK-Lymphocytes as well as IgA while increased Popovych’s Strain Index, plasma level of Cortisol, Mineralocorticoide activity, Bayevskiy’s Stress and Activity Regulatory Systems Indexes, Sympathetic tone, blood level of CD 8 + T-Lymphocytes as well as IgM. By method od discriminant analysis it is detected 38 variables specific to Basal level and after 1, 5 h after drink Control Waters (CW) and Bioactive Waters Naftusssya (BAWN). Discriminant variables divided on four clusters. First cluster reflects caused by BAWN reversion of activating trend after CW for 17 variables (changes in Euklidian Units relative to Basal Level makes - 0, 14 ± 0, 03 and + 0, 45 ± 0, 06 respectively) while second cluster reflects reversion of inhibiting trend for 12 variables (changes relative to Basal Level makes + 0, 38 ± 0, 09 and - 0, 20 ± 0, 07 respectively). Information about these 29 <b>variables</b> <b>condensed</b> in major canonical root (62, 6 % discriminant properties). Means of its makes for Basal Level (n= 54) + 0, 05 ± 0, 13 Mahalanobis’ Units, after CW (n= 15) - 3, 10 ± 0, 31 while after BAWN in total (n= 39) + 1, 12 ± 0, 20, separately for layers Truskavets’ (n= 12) + 1, 28 ± 0, 28, Pomyarky (n= 12) + 1, 13 ± 0, 28 and Skhidnyts’a (n= 15) + 0, 99 ± 0, 29. Third cluster reflects attenuation of activating trend for 4 variables (changes relative to Basal Level makes + 0, 47 ± 0, 08 and + 0, 25 ± 0, 02 respectively) while fourth cluster reflects reduction of inhibiting trend for 5 variables (changes relative to Basal Level makes - 0, 31 ± 0, 04 and - 0, 10 ± 0, 03 respectively). Information about these 9 <b>variables</b> <b>condensed</b> in minor canonical root (37, 4 % discriminant properties). Means of its makes for Basal Level + 1, 03 ± 0, 14, for CW - 0, 94 ± 0, 20, for layers Truskavets’ - 1, 03 ± 0, 30, Pomyarky - 1, 28 ± 0, 28 and Skhidnyts’a - 0, 93 ± 0, 30. Conclusion. Bioactive Water Naftussya from layers Truskavets’, Pomyarky and Skhidnyts’a causes approximately equal immediate effects on 29 parameters of neuro-endocrine-immune complex different from effects of Control (distillated, filtered, well) Waters.

40|$|Vapor {{compression}} cycles are {{the primary}} method by which refrigeration and air-conditioning systems operate, and thus constitute {{a significant portion of}} commercial and residential building energy consumption. This thesis presents a data-driven approach to find the optimal operating conditions of a multi-evaporator system in order to minimize the energy consumption while meeting operational requirements such as constant cooling or constant evaporator outlet temperature. The experimental system used for controller evaluation is a custom built small-scale water chiller with three evaporators; each evaporator services a separate body of water, referred to as a cooling zone. The three evaporators are connected to a single <b>condenser</b> and <b>variable</b> speed compressor, and feature variable water flow and electronic expansion valves. The control problem lies in development of a control architecture that will minimize the energy consumed by the system without prior information about the system in the form of performance maps, or complex mathematical models. The control architecture explored in this thesis relies on the data collected by sensors alone to formulate a function for the power consumption of the system in terms of controlled <b>variables,</b> namely, <b>condenser</b> and evaporator pressures, using recursive least squares estimation. This cost function is then minimized to attain optimal set points for the pressures which are fed to local controllers...|$|R
40|$|Sainfoin is a forage legume {{adapted to}} cool climates, {{thriving}} well on basic and dry soils. It is much appreciated by farmers {{due to its}} high palatability, high nutritional value and non bloating properties. Sainfoin herbage contains <b>variable</b> amounts of <b>condensed</b> tannins that are implied in its nutritional characteristics and confer anthelmintic properties. Thus, their precise quantification, along with others parameters of chemical composition becomes crucial. The use of NIR technology for this characterisation is particularly relevant, especially since huge numbers of sainfoin samples are being generated by the efforts under way to select accessions from different European conditions. The aim of this work is to evaluate the suitability of NIRS for predicting the chemical composition {{and the content of}} condensed tannins of a collection of sainfoin sample...|$|R
40|$|Communication {{available}} online at [URL] audienceTube support plate clogging of steam generators affects their operating and requires frequent maintenance operations. A diagnosis method based on dynamic behaviour analysis is under development at EDF to provide means of optimisation of maintenance strategies. Previous work showed that the dynamic response to a power transient of the wide range level measurement contains informations about the clogging state of steam generators. The diagnosis method consists of comparisons of the measured dynamic response with simulations on a mono-dimensional dynamic steam generator model for various input clogging configurations. In order to assess the potential of this method, a sensitivity analysis has been conducted through a quasi-Monte Carlo scheme to compute sensitivity indices for each half tube support plate's clogging ratio. Sensitivity indices are usually defined for scalar model outputs. Principal component analysis {{has been used to}} determine a small subset of <b>variables</b> that <b>condense</b> the information about the shape of the response curves. Finally, estimation variability was assessed by construction of bootstrap confidence intervals. The results showed that half of the preselected input variables have negligible influence and allowed to rank the most important ones. Interactions of input variables have been estimated to exert only a small influence on the output. The effects of clogging on the steam generator dynamics has been characterised qualitatively and quantitatively...|$|R
