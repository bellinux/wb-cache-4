40|$|This paper {{incorporates}} expectations-based reference-dependent preferences {{into the}} canonical Lucas-tree asset-pricing economy. Expectations-based loss aversion increases the equity premium and decreases the consumption-wealth ratio, because uncertain fluctuations in consumption {{are perceived to}} be more painful. Moreover, because unexpected cuts in consumption are particularly painful, the agent wants to postpone such cuts to let his reference point decrease. Thus, even though shocks are i. i. d., loss aversion induces <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> consumption-wealth ratio, which generates <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> equity premium, expected returns, and predictability. <b>The</b> level and <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> equity premium and <b>the</b> predictability <b>in</b> returns match historical moments, but <b>the</b> associated <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> intertemporal substitution motives results <b>in</b> excessive <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> risk-free rate. This effect can be partially offset with <b>variation</b> <b>in</b> expected consumption growth, heteroskedasticity in consumption growth, or time-variant disaster risk. As a key contribution, I show that the preferences resolve the equity-premium puzzle and simultaneously imply plausible risk attitudes towards small and large wealth bets. ...|$|R
