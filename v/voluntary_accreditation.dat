25|$|The use of ECT in the UK has {{continued}} to fall, from about 23,000 courses in 1986 to about 11,000 in 2002. There is still marked variation in use, both in prescribing and in standards of administration. The Royal College of Psychiatrists produced three more sets of guidelines, and carried out two more surveys. The National Health Service produced guidelines on ECT use in 2003 and the following year the Royal College of Psychiatrists set up a <b>voluntary</b> <b>accreditation</b> scheme for ECT clinics.|$|E
25|$|The {{guidance}} {{received a}} mixed reception. It was welcomed by {{an editorial in}} the British Medical Journal but the Royal College of Psychiatrists launched an unsuccessful appeal. The NICE guidance, as the British Medical Journal editorial points out, is only a policy statement and psychiatrists may deviate from it if they see fit. Adherence to standards has not been universal in the past. A survey of ECT use in 1980 found {{that more than half of}} ECT clinics failed to meet minimum standards set by the Royal College of Psychiatrists, with a later survey in 1998 finding that minimum standards were largely adhered to, but that two-thirds of clinics still fell short of current guidelines, particularly in the training and supervision of junior doctors involved in the procedure. A <b>voluntary</b> <b>accreditation</b> scheme, ECTAS, was set up in 2004 by the Royal College, but as of 2006 only a minority of ECT clinics in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland have signed up.|$|E

40|$|The {{efforts of}} Queensland's parents, {{government}} officials, and early childhood professionals {{to raise the}} quality of child care by developing a <b>voluntary</b> process for <b>accreditation</b> of early childhood programs are described. The envisioned accreditation process would begin with collaborative self-study by child caregivers of the exz. ent to which their programs realized 10 program components. Each component would be defined by a goal, a brief rationale, and several crateria. Components defined were: (1) interactions among staff and children; (2) curriculum/program for children; (3) interaction, between staff and parents; (4) staff qunl-cications and development; (5) staffing patterns; (6) physical environment and setting; (7) health and safety factor [...] ); / 9) food and nutrition issues; (9) managemen, and administration; and (10) evaluation. The self-study was {{to be followed by}} validation and consideration for accreditation. It is argued that many community benefits accrue from a <b>voluntary</b> program <b>accreditation</b> system built on clear regulations. The self-study facilitates staff development, parent education, and accountability to the community, and raises awareress of young children's needs for appropriate programs.

30|$|Following the {{expansion}} and diversification of higher education, {{the question of}} quality assurance began to be raised. The first steps towards a quality assurance system were taken in the mid- 1990 s {{with the creation of}} the Education Council, which started implementing a compulsory licensing system for some educational institutions. In the late 1990 s and early 2000 s, institutions were created to develop <b>voluntary</b> program <b>accreditation</b> at the undergraduate and graduate levels, including the Commission for the Evaluation of Undergraduate Programs (CEUP) in 1999 and the Commission for the Evaluation of Postgraduate Programs in 2000. In 2004, CEUP also started implementing accreditation at the institutional level. After this learning period, in 2006, Law 20.129 set up the National Higher Education Quality Assurance System, creating new quality assurance institutions and functions.|$|R
