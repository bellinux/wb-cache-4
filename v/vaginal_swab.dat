The manuscript of the workbook report from the Chemical Examination Laboratory shows over-writing in four places. Using a whitener and a different ink, the word ‘‘not’’ has been added to the word ‘‘detected,’. The lab explained that it was quite normal to make corrections in the manuscript. Even Varghese P Thomas, the first investigating officer, said the post mortem and lab reports had ruled out rape, leaving no scope for suspicions on the veracity of the report.|$|E

40|$|Isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes from <b>vaginal</b> <b>swabs</b> of {{children}} with vulvovaginitis received at Nottingham Public Health Laboratory during 1986 - 9 were studied. A total of 159 isolates was made during the 4 years, increasing from 17 in 1986 to 64 in 1989 and accounting for 11 % of all <b>vaginal</b> <b>swabs</b> received from children. The numbers of throat swabs yielding S. pyogenes also showed an increase from 974 in 1986 to 1519 in 1989. A winter peak of isolates was noted for both <b>vaginal</b> <b>swabs</b> and throat swabs. A total of 98 strains from <b>vaginal</b> <b>swabs</b> were serotyped: 22 different types were identified, 61 % of which were the common types M 4, M 6, R 28 and M 12.

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to {{identify}} thebacteria which {{are found in the}} reproductive tract of dairy cows during parturient and to find the appropriate treatment. The area of study was Khartoum University Farm at Shambat, Khartoum North, Khartoum State. The cows examinedwere 4 – 8 years old cross-bred dairy cows (Friesian × Kenana). A total of 80 <b>vaginal</b> <b>swabs</b> were collected from 55 postparturient cows. These swabs were collected within 3 days after delivery. Thirty <b>vaginal</b> <b>swabs</b> were collected 1 – 3 days after parturition. Twenty – five <b>vaginal</b> <b>swabs</b> were collected from cows 1 - 3 days after parturition before treatment with antiseptic 1 % Lugol's iodine and then <b>vaginal</b> <b>swabs</b> were collected from the same twenty – five cows 24 hours after treatment with the antiseptic 1 %Lugol's iodine. The vagina of postparturient cow was sampled by sterile cotton wool. The collected swabs were inoculated on blood agar and MacConkey's agar. The isolated bacteria were identified by their cellular morphology, arrangement, staining reaction and biochemicalproperties. The antibacterial sensitivity of the isolated bacteria was examined to Ampicillin, Gentamysin, Chloramphincol, Cloxacillin, Erythromycin, Pencillin, Tetracycline, Streptomycin, Naladixic acid, Nitrofurantol, Cloistin and Cotrimoxazole and 1 % Lugol'siodine. The indentified bacteria were Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Corynobacterium, Bacillus, Escherichia, Kelbsielle, Aerococcus, Micrococcus and Proteus. The Gram positive bacteria isolated from 30 postpartum <b>vaginal</b> <b>swabs</b> within 1 - 3 days after parturition were Staphylococcus spp, Streptococcus spp,Bacillus spp, Micrococcus spp, Aerococcus spp, Lactobacillusspp and Corynobacterium spp. The Gram- positive bacteria isolated from 25 postpartum <b>vaginal</b> <b>swabs</b> before treatment with 1 % Lugol’s Iodine wereStaphylococcus spp, Streptococcus spp, Bacillus spp, Micrococcus spp and Corynobacteriumspp. The Gram-positive bacteria isolated from 25 postpartum vaginalswabs after 1 - 3 days after treatment with 1 % Lugol’s Iodine were Staphylococcus spp, Streptococcus spp, Bacillus spp, and Corynobacteriumspp. The Gram- negative bacteria isolated from 30 postpartum <b>vaginal</b> <b>swabs</b> within 1 – 3 days after parturition were E. coli, Klebsiella spp, Protues spp, Enterobacter spp. The Gram- negative bacteria isolated from 25 postpartum <b>vaginal</b> <b>swabs</b> before treatmentwith 1 % Lugol’s Iodine were E. coli, Klebsiella spp and Protues spp. The Gram- negative bacteria iv isolated from 25 postpartum <b>vaginal</b> <b>swabs</b> after treatment with 1 % Lugol’s Iodine were E. coli, Klebsiella spp and Protues spp. The sensitivity ofthe isolates to antibacterial agents was variable. They were less sensitive to the commonly used drugs like Tetracycline and Cloxacillin. This may be due to misuse of these drugs, while they were highly sensitive to others like Gentamysin and Ampicillin which are less commonly used. The sensitivity of the isolates to 1 %Lugol's iodine was variable. Some isolates were resistant and a few were sensitive...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAbstract Self-sampling using <b>vaginal</b> <b>swabs</b> {{could be}} a {{valuable}} alternative to screen for cervical cancer for women who do not attend regular cytological screening. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the prevalence of high and low-risk HPV types and of HPV type 16 and 18 DNA load in self-collected <b>vaginal</b> <b>swabs</b> from 35 - to 69 -year-old Southern French women of low socioeconomic level or migrant populations who do not attend regular cervical screening. A good concordance (93. 1 %) was found between cervical brush and <b>vaginal</b> <b>swabs</b> in 29 samples. Self-collected <b>vaginal</b> <b>swabs</b> were examined from 120 women. HPV infection was found in 28 women (23. 3 %; median age 48 years), 17 (14. 1 %) of whom harboured high-risk HPV types. HPV type 16 was the high risk type found most frequently, followed by types 53, 31, 18, 58, and 66. The low-risk type detected most frequently was HPV type 6, followed by types 61, 70, and 81. The mean HPV 16 and 18 load was 6. 3 log 10 copies/ 106 cells and 2. 4 log 10 copies/ 106 cells, respectively. These results suggest that vaginal self-swabs can be a reliable tool for cervical cancer screening in non-attending and inadequately screened elderly women...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundSelf-administered swabs {{are used}} to sample vaginal {{contents}} {{for a variety of}} clinical purposes including detection of sexually transmitted infections, condom breakage, and vaginal product use. The goal {{of this study was to}} determine whether a quantitative glycogen assay can be used to assess whether a swab has been exposed to the vagina to assure study compliance. Study DesignBuccal, skin, or vaginal samples were tested to determine whether a commercial quantitative glycogen assay can differentiate vaginal specimens. In addition, archived remnant de-identified <b>vaginal</b> <b>swabs</b> from clinical trials were tested. Periodic acid 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 cSchiff stain was used to identify glycogen-positive cells as a confirmation test. ResultsGlycogen concentrations in eluates of <b>vaginal</b> <b>swabs</b> from reproductive-aged women were significantly higher than those from unused swabs (mean 21 SE, 964 21 135 /mL vs. 14. 7 21 2. 5 /mL, P < 0. 001) and swabs exposed to buccal and finger/hand epithelia (40. 3 21 4. 8 and 18. 5 21 5. 4 /mL, P < 0. 001).
