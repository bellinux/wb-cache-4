40|$|<b>Volunteer</b> tourism, {{which is}} a {{combination}} of travelling and <b>volunteer</b> work in the global “South”, is increasing and {{there is a need for}} more knowledge of the local context. There is a need to examine the constructions of <b>volunteer</b> tourism in the interpretations of people invol-ved on a local level and the implications of these constructions. It is also important to study power dimensions in the relation between local staff and <b>volunteers.</b> The purpose of the study is to examine what image of <b>volunteers</b> and <b>volunteer</b> tourism is constructed by <b>volunteers</b> and local staff. It aims to study what view of the <b>volunteer’s</b> role and what image of the function of <b>volunteer</b> tourism is constructed by local staff and <b>volunteers.</b> Another aim is to examine power relations in the relation between <b>volunteers</b> and local staff. The theoretical framework is social constructivism using discourse analysis. My analysis shows that the volun-teer takes the role of an educator. The image of <b>volunteer</b> tourism that is constructed revolves around the <b>volunteer</b> and the <b>volunteer</b> experience and the function of <b>volunteer</b> tourism as an international internship. <b>Volunteer</b> organisation involves an imbalance in power between <b>volunteers</b> and local staff since <b>volunteers</b> are customers and being western means to have a symbolic capital in this environment...|$|R

40|$|In {{times of}} budget constraints, public gardens explore ways to {{maintain}} existing services without increasing expenditures. Therefore, <b>volunteer</b> programs {{are an important}} component of the human resources at many organizations and should be managed to optimize their efficiency. A <b>volunteer</b> program model to help manage and decrease <b>volunteer</b> turnover was created based on current literature and interviews with coordinators of <b>volunteers</b> at selected public gardens. This model was compared to the horticulture <b>volunteer</b> programs at three case study sites: Chicago Botanic Garden, Dallas Arboretum and Botanical Garden, and Holden Arboretum. The <b>volunteer</b> program model includes: a philosophy statement, policy for operation of the program, a <b>volunteer</b> manual, needs assessment for <b>volunteers</b> at the organization, work descriptions, recruitment, interviewing and inviting <b>volunteers</b> to the program, orientation and training, evaluation, dismissal of problematic <b>volunteers,</b> record keeping, recognition, and maintenance of healthy relationships between paid staff and <b>volunteers.</b> Coordinators of <b>volunteers</b> were interviewed regarding the management of their horticulture <b>volunteer</b> programs and retention at their gardens. The results indicate the case study gardens are not actively managing horticulture <b>volunteer</b> turnover. However, the selected public gardens are currently implementing some of the components in the <b>volunteer</b> model. The results of this study will provide coordinators of <b>volunteers,</b> public garden directors, and human resource personnel with the necessary information to understand <b>volunteer</b> retention and should help decrease the <b>volunteer</b> turnover rate at their public gardens...|$|R
