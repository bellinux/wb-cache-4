40|$|Using a {{procedure}} that borrowed from both a quantitative and a qualitative research approach to psychotherapy, this study investigated audiotaped recordings of six sessions of Gestalt therapy conducted by five distinguished therapists. This in-depth, discovery-oriented research explored the interrelations between in-session client conditions, therapist operations and <b>very</b> <b>good</b> moments. In {{the first phase of}} the study, composite descriptions of six categories of <b>very</b> <b>good</b> moments were generated, based on the identification and the subsequent descriptions of 17 instances of <b>very</b> <b>good</b> moments made by a team of twelve judges. The six categories of <b>very</b> <b>good</b> moments were: From Neutral to Strong Feeling; Strong Expression Directly Toward Therapist; Extratherapy Behavior Change Intention; Acceptance of Problem-Self; State of General Well-Being; and New, Deeply Felt Personality Process-State. In the second phase of the investigation, judges identified explicit therapist operations and methods which, when carried out under identified client conditions or states, were judged as being instrumental in the subsequent occurrence of the given category of <b>very</b> <b>good</b> moments. The main finding was as follows: (a) The skilled and competent use of specific therapist operations, (b) with a client who is ready and willing to use the operations, and to move toward that <b>very</b> <b>good</b> moment, (c) appeared to result in the occurrence of that <b>very</b> <b>good</b> moment. For practitioners who value these categories of <b>very</b> <b>good</b> moments, the findings may be used as provisional suggestions for ways of facilitating the occurrence of these <b>very</b> <b>good</b> moments. For researchers, the findings are illustrative of continuing explorations into how psychotherapy works, into the relations between in-session client conditions or states, therapist operations, and consequent in-session <b>very</b> <b>good</b> moments. By means of careful, in-depth examination, researchers can learn what practitioners do to help bring about important and useful in-session client events...|$|R
40|$|Digital Communication System 1800 is a {{derivative}} standard system of GSM 900. A low transmission power {{is required for}} a short network and a propagation condition on 1800 MHz band. Level value of receptivity is an indicator to see a signal quality on the BTS coverage. The {{purpose of the present}} research is to analyze receptivity level on DCS 1800 system using Okumura-Hatta, Cost 231 - Hatta, and Walfisch-Ikegami propagation model. This research took place in the city center by measuring receptivity level which was radiated by using a software namely G-Net Track Lite Signal 4 G. Results of the calculation and measurement compared with RSRP standard located in DARATSKIP are presented as follows. Results from Okumura-Hatta propagation model were categorized <b>Very</b> <b>Good</b> - 58. 04 dBm, - 48. 58 dBm, and - 66. 77 dBm. Cost 231 -Hatta were categorized <b>Very</b> <b>Good</b> - 62. 39 dBm, - 52. 92 dBm, and - 77. 11 dBm. Further, Walfisch-Ikegami were categorized Fairly Good - 88, 44 dBm, <b>Very</b> <b>Good</b> - 71. 66 dBm, - 81, 49, G-Net Track Lite Not Good - 93 dBm, <b>Very</b> <b>Good</b> - 78 dBm, and Good - 87 dBm. Comparisons of calculation and measurement at BTS Benua Melayu Darat using Okumura-Hatta propagation model were categorized <b>Very</b> <b>Good</b> - 70. 68 dBm, - 59. 28 dBm, and - 64. 21 dBm. Cost 231 - Hatta were categorized <b>Very</b> <b>Good</b> - 71. 79 dBm, - 60. 38 dBm, - 68. 57 dBm and G-NetTrack Lite were ranked <b>Very</b> <b>Good</b> - 77 dBm and Good - 83 dBm, 85 dBm. Further, Walfisch-Ikegami were categorized <b>Very</b> <b>Good</b> - 79. 8 dBm, Good - 83. 51 dBm, - 86. 67 dBm. Comparisons of calculation and measurement at BTS Gajah Mada Mall using Okumura-Hatta propagation model were categorized <b>Very</b> <b>Good</b> - 64. 97 dBm, - 58. 59 dBm, and - 71. 22 dBm.
