5|$|A snail {{does not}} have a dart to fire the <b>very</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> it mates, because the first mating is {{necessary}} to trigger the process of dart formation. Once a snail has mated, it fires a dart before some, but not all, subsequent matings. A snail often mates without having a dart to use, because it takes time to create a replacement dart. In the case of the garden snail Cornu aspersum, it takes a week for a new dart to form.|$|E

40|$|ENGLISH: The {{long-lasting}} episcopate of Aganone (837 - 867), {{a learned}} Frankish bishop strictly {{connected to the}} imperial court and {{to some of the}} most important intellectual of his time, represented a real turning point in Bergamo's history during Early Middle Ages, both in political and social fields, and for a whole regarding cultural expressions. The paper aims at pointing out the connections between the process of the definitive strengthening of Carolingian power in town and the innovations verifiable in the local literacy, which since the <b>very</b> <b>first</b> <b>times</b> of Aganone is characterized by a sudden and uniform adherence to the Caroline minuscule canon, so overcoming the graphic particularism and the cursive writing tendencies of the previous period. The hypothesis that Aganone's and his entourage's installation in Bergamo coincided with the formation of a graphic 'school' (or, at least, with the strong affirmation of an unitary cultural trend) seems to be confirmed by the appearance, in the subscriptions, of notae tachigraphicae and other special chancellery signs, which from bishop's curia will spread later on also among notaries and other outstanding laymen, as a distinctive mark of urban élites...|$|R
40|$|I {{remember}} I {{was quite}} shocked when, {{one of the}} <b>very</b> <b>first</b> <b>times</b> I went to the MTG, Perfecto Herrera suggested that I work on the automatic identification of versions of musical pieces. I had played versions (both amateur and professionally) since I was 13 but, although being familiar with many MIR tasks, I {{had never thought of}} version identification before. Furthermore, how could they (the MTG people) know that I played song versions? I don’t think I had told them anything about this aspect [...] . Before that meeting with Perfe, I had discussed a few research topics with Xavier Serra and, after he gave me feedback on a number of research proposals I had, I decided to submit one related to the exploitation of the temporal information of music descriptors for music similarity. Therefore, when Perfe suggested the topic of version identification I initially thought that such a suggestion was not related to my proposal at all. However, subsequent meetings with Emilia Gómez and Pedro Cano made me realize that I was wrong, up to the point that if now I had to talk about the work in this thesis I would probabl...|$|R

5000|$|In 1942, at age 19, Jacquet soloed on the Hampton Orchestra's {{recording}} of [...] "Flying Home", {{one of the}} <b>very</b> <b>first</b> <b>times</b> a honking tenor sax was heard on record. The record became a hit. The song immediately became the climax for the live shows and Jacquet became exhausted from having to [...] "bring down the house" [...] every night. The solo was built to weave {{in and out of}} the arrangement and continued to be played by every saxophone player who followed Jacquet in the band, notably Arnett Cobb and Dexter Gordon, who achieved almost as much fame as Jacquet in playing it. It is one of the very few jazz solos to have been memorized and played very much the same way by everyone who played the song. He quit the Hampton band in 1943 and joined Cab Calloway's Orchestra. Jacquet appeared with Cab Calloway's band in Lena Horne's movie Stormy Weather. In the earlier years of Jacquet's career, his brother Linton Jacquet managed him on the chitlin circuit Linton's daughter Brenda Jacquet-Ross sang in jazz venues in the San Francisco Bay Area in the 1990s to early 2000s, with a band called the Mondo Players.|$|R

40|$|This {{extended}} {{essay is}} about sound produced by stringed instruments, specifi-cally guitar. There will be 2 different parts which are about two different charac-teristics of sound. One is pitch and second is timbre (quality {{and characteristics of}} sound). Pitch will be examined by changing length and timbre by changing thick-ness of string. I chose this experiment because I am interested in both sound and physics. I wanted know more about sound and audio. In this experiment, I learnt a lot about sound, especially guitar sound. On the other hand, I {{did not know how}} to analyze sound and this essay gave me a chance to learn it. At <b>very</b> <b>first</b> <b>times</b> of this exper-iment it was very hard to analyze because, I did not know what to look at. The procedure and most of the measurements are done by same steps only, be-cause of independent variables, the data collected is different. Also uncertainties for length, diameter of string; frequency and hold time are same for both part 1 and part 2. This is why some of the uncertainties are not mentioned in part 2. Finally yet importantly, the instruments are same for part 1 and part 2. Be-cause of this while collecting different data, the instruments are resettled for avoiding errors and measurements are done in same conditions...|$|R
