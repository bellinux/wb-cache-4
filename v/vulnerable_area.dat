5|$|Charles I, {{who ruled}} from 1331 to 1357, {{and was the}} son of François Grimaldi's cousin Rainier I, {{significantly}} enlarged the fortress by adding two large buildings: one against the eastern ramparts and the second looking out over the sea. This changed the appearance of the fortress, making it appear more of a fortified house than a fortress. The fortifications remained very necessary, for during the next three decades the fortress was alternately lost and regained by the Grimaldi to the Genoese. In 1341 the Grimaldi took Menton and then Roquebrune, thus consolidating their power and strength in the area. Subsequently they strengthened not only the defences of the harbour but also their fortress on the Rocher. The Grimaldi's stronghold was now a power base from which the family ruled a large but very <b>vulnerable</b> <b>area</b> of land.|$|E

25|$|German armour-piercing shells {{were far}} more {{effective}} than the British ones, which often failed to penetrate heavy armour. The issue particularly concerned shells striking at oblique angles, which became increasingly the case at long range. Germany had adopted trinitrotoluene (TNT) as the explosive filler for artillery shells in 1902, while the United Kingdom was still using a picric acid mixture (Lyddite). The shock of impact of a shell against armour often prematurely detonated Lyddite in advance of fuze function while TNT detonation could be delayed until after the shell had penetrated and the fuze had functioned in the <b>vulnerable</b> <b>area</b> behind the armour plate.|$|E

40|$|Radiocaesium is an {{important}} and persistent environmental contaminant that can be deposited f o l l o w i n g nuclear accidents. It became apparent after the Chernobyl accident that some regions were vulnerable to radiocaesium deposition. Prior identification of <b>vulnerable</b> <b>areas</b> using spatial models that incorporate variation i n radiocaesium soil-to-plant transfer {{as a function of}} soil properties would allow post-accident management options to be prioritised and effectively implemented. In this paper, an assessment of the influence of different input soil property data sets for Hungary upon spatial model predictions of cow milk 1 3 7 Cs activity concentrations and the identification of <b>vulnerable</b> <b>areas</b> is presented. Although predictions of cow m i l k 1 3 7 Cs activity concentrations after Chernobyl made using the three input soil property data sets are all broadly similar and i n reasonable agreement w i t h national monitoring data, the identification of <b>vulnerable</b> <b>areas</b> is greatly influenced by the input soil property data set used.

40|$|Abandonment of {{agricultural}} land {{is one of}} the main changes in Mediterranean land use. To mitigate runoff and erosion from abandoned land, it is necessary to identify locations that are vulnerable to erosion as a result of land abandonment. The objective of our study was to identify <b>vulnerable</b> <b>areas</b> for gully erosion using different scenarios of land abandonment in Southeast Spain. The study area was the Carcavo basin, a semi-arid catchment in the province of Murcia (Southeast Spain). A preliminary field survey confirmed the assumption that abandoned fields have more gully erosion compared to cultivated fields. This can be explained by the quicker concentration of runoff on abandoned land due to crust formation and reduced surface storage capacity. Next we simulated the spatial dynamics of land abandonment with a spatially explicit land use change model for the period 2004 to 2015 for four different land use change scenarios. The results of the simulation were used to identify <b>vulnerable</b> <b>areas</b> for gully erosion by a simple GIS-model based on the controlling factors of gully erosion. The potentially <b>vulnerable</b> <b>areas</b> for gully erosion increased for the different scenarios ranging from 18 ha to 176 ha. Most of the <b>vulnerable</b> <b>areas</b> are located around channel heads or along channel walls. The combination of more gully erosion on abandoned fields and an expected increase of land abandonment are potentially a big problem in relation to land degradation and reservoir sedimentation. The identification of <b>vulnerable</b> <b>areas</b> enables soil conservationists and engineers to mitigate gully erosion by applying preventive conservation practices...|$|R
