25|$|As well {{as sexual}} {{reproduction}} by seed, many butterworts can reproduce asexually by <b>vegetative</b> <b>reproduction.</b> Many {{members of the}} genus form offshoots during or shortly after flowering (e.g., P.vulgaris), which grow into new genetically identical adults. A few other species form new offshoots using stolons (e.g., P. calyptrata, P. vallisneriifolia) while others form plantlets at the leaf margins (e.g., P. heterophylla, P. primuliflora).|$|E
25|$|Many trees, shrubs, vines, {{ferns and}} other {{herbaceous}} perennials form clonal colonies naturally. Parts {{of an individual}} plant may become detached by fragmentation and grow on to become separate clonal individuals. A common example is in the <b>vegetative</b> <b>reproduction</b> of moss and liverwort gametophyte clones by means of gemmae. Some vascular plants e.g. dandelion and certain viviparous grasses also form seeds asexually, termed apomixis, resulting in clonal populations of genetically identical individuals.|$|E
25|$|Cell {{division}} {{involves a}} single cell (called a mother cell) dividing into two daughter cells. This leads to growth in multicellular organisms (the growth of tissue) and to procreation (<b>vegetative</b> <b>reproduction)</b> in unicellular organisms. Prokaryotic cells divide by binary fission, while eukaryotic cells usually undergo {{a process of}} nuclear division, called mitosis, followed by division of the cell, called cytokinesis.

25|$|Organism cloning (also called {{reproductive}} cloning) {{refers to}} the procedure of creating a new multicellular organism, genetically identical to another. In essence this form of cloning is an asexual method of reproduction, where fertilization or inter-gamete contact does not take place. Asexual reproduction is a naturally occurring phenomenon in many species, including most plants (see <b>vegetative</b> <b>reproduction)</b> and some insects. Scientists have made some major achievements with cloning, including the asexual reproduction of sheep and cows. There {{is a lot of}} ethical debate over whether or not cloning should be used. However, cloning, or asexual propagation, has been common practice in the horticultural world for hundreds of years.|$|E
25|$|The first root {{that comes}} from a plant is called the radicle. A root's four major {{functions}} are 1) absorption of water and inorganic nutrients, 2) anchoring of the plant body to the ground, and supporting it, 3) storage of food and nutrients, 4) <b>vegetative</b> <b>reproduction</b> and competition with other plants. In response to the concentration of nutrients, roots also synthesise cytokinin, which acts as a signal as to how fast the shoots can grow. Roots often function in storage of food and nutrients. The roots of most vascular plant species enter into symbiosis with certain fungi to form mycorrhizae, and a large range of other organisms including bacteria also closely associate with roots.|$|E
25|$|The term clone {{is used in}} {{horticulture}} {{to refer}} to descendants of a single plant which were produced by <b>vegetative</b> <b>reproduction</b> or apomixis. Many horticultural plant cultivars are clones, having been derived from a single individual, multiplied by some process other than sexual reproduction. As an example, some European cultivars of grapes represent clones that have been propagated for over two millennia. Other examples are potato and banana. Grafting {{can be regarded as}} cloning, since all the shoots and branches coming from the graft are genetically a clone of a single individual, but this particular kind of cloning has not come under ethical scrutiny and is generally treated as an entirely different kind of operation.|$|E
50|$|CAT {{biology is}} not {{completely}} understood. Initially, conidia are induced to form CATs. Once they are formed, they grow homing toward each other, and eventually they fuse. Once fusion occurs, the respective nuclei can pass through the fused CATs from one conidium to the other. These are events of fungal <b>vegetative</b> growth (asexual <b>reproduction)</b> and not sexual reproduction. Part of the CAT fusion (cell fusion) have been show to be a coordinated behaviour.|$|R
50|$|Soils are thin, coarse and {{relatively}} nutrient-poor, {{owing to the}} unproductive climate and repeated glaciation events during the Pleistocene. Moisture retention is usually high, due {{to the presence of}} underlying granite bedrock, and soils often become waterlogged early in the growing season. However, because very little precipitation falls during the summer months, soils can dry quickly once snow melts and <b>vegetative</b> growth and <b>reproduction</b> is limited late in the growing season by drought.|$|R
40|$|Project No. 14 - 48 - 0001 - 96749 Wetland prairies of the Willamette Valley, {{considered}} {{among the}} rarest of Oregon’s ecosystems, are threatened by invasion of woody species and non-native species. Because of its historical importance, fire is a top choice of managers for preventing the encroachment of woody species. However, the effects of prescribed burning on present day wetland communities, with their mix of native and non-native species, are not clear. The present study investigated some of the mechanisms [...] survival, growth, and reproduction [...] that determine the response of plants to fire for seven dominant wetland species. The approach was to compare survival, aboveground vegetative biomass, reproductive biomass, and flowering intensity between burned and unburned plots one growing season after the burn treatment, using before-burning measurements as a covariate in the analysis. The experiment was conducted in the Willamette Floodplain Research Natural Area of the William L. Finley National Wildlife Refuge, Oregon. The responses of seven study species show four patterns of response to burning: Poor survivors: Species with reduced survival, aboveground <b>vegetative</b> biomass, and <b>reproduction</b> (Rosa spp., Veronica scutellata). Decreasers: Species with no change in survival but reduced aboveground <b>vegetative</b> biomass and <b>reproduction</b> (Deschampsia cespitosa, Carex unilateralis). Unaffected: Species with little changes in survival, aboveground <b>vegetative</b> biomass, and <b>reproduction</b> (Hordeum brachyantherum, Holcus lanatus). Increasers: Species with increases in survival, aboveground <b>vegetative</b> biomass, and <b>reproduction</b> (Beckmannia syzigachne). Management strategies for conservation of Willamette Valley native wetlands require the reduced abundance of woody species, the reduction or prevention of increase in non-native pest plant abundance, and the increase {{or at least the}} maintenance of native species’ abundance. The results {{of this study indicate that}} prescribed burning can achieve the first objective of decreasing the abundance of woody species (Rosa spp.). Long-term rose control would require repeated burning. Fire neither reduced nor promoted the abundance of the non-native herbaceous species measured (Holcus lanatus). The results were mixed for the native species. The abundance of two native species was maintained (Hordeum brachyantherum) or promoted (Beckmannia syzigachne). The abundance of the other three native species measured was reduced (Veronica scutellata, Deschampsia cespitosa, Carex unilateralis). These results are for first year responses to a single fire. Responses of plants may change with timing of burning (e. g., fall vs. summer burn), with frequency of fires, and may not be evident the first year after burning. More definite management recommendations can be made after long term effects become clear from continuing research programs...|$|R
500|$|Box {{huckleberry}} is self-sterile, so single plants cannot reproduce sexually. Instead, {{they form}} colonies which spread by <b>vegetative</b> <b>reproduction</b> along rootstocks. A colony of G.brachycera at Losh Run, Pennsylvania {{was found to}} be [...] long when surveyed. If this colony grew clonally from a seed deposited along the Juniata River at the rate of [...] per year, it would be about 13,000 years old, the oldest living organism in the United States and second oldest in the world, eclipsed only by Lomatia tasmanica. However, this is believed now to be an overestimate on climatic grounds. At that time, the site was covered by a boreal forest thought to be too cold for the box huckleberry to survive; the current forest did not begin to appear at the site until about 8,000 years ago. This age would still make it the oldest woody plant in North America east of the Rocky Mountains. Recent studies have attempted to determine whether, in fact, the reproduction of the colony (since heavily damaged by a forest fire in 1963 and road construction in the 1970s) has been entirely clonal. Two genotypes were found in samples taken from the colony, but they are thought to have arisen through somatic mutation rather than sexual reproduction. Unfortunately, the destruction of about 80% of the colony by fire and construction makes it impossible to definitively settle the question.|$|E
2500|$|Seeds of this species, {{like other}} orchids, lack an endosperm. [...] The {{extremely}} small seeds must {{come in contact}} with appropriate soil fungi in order to germinate.

2500|$|The rate of ageing varies {{substantially}} {{across different}} species, and this, {{to a large}} extent, is genetically based.

Taken together, our data show that H. polymorpha Pex 11 p is not only important for peroxisome proliferation but is also required for proper peroxisome segregation during cell division. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn recent years, {{considerable}} {{progress has}} been made in the elucidation of photoresponses and the mechanisms responsible for their induction in species of the genus Trichoderma. Although an influence of light on these fungi had already been reported five decades ago, their response is not limited to photoconidiation. While early studies on the molecular level concentrated on signaling via the secondary messenger cAMP, a more comprehensive scheme is available today. The photoreceptor-orthologs BLR 1 and BLR 2 are known to mediate almost all known light responses in these fungi and another light-regulatory protein, ENVOY, is suggested to establish the connection between light response and nutrient signaling. As a central regulatory mechanism, this light signaling machinery impacts diverse downstream pathways including <b>vegetative</b> growth, <b>reproduction,</b> carbon and sulfur metabolism, response to oxidative stress and biosynthesis of peptaibols. These responses involve several signaling cascades, for example the heterotrimeric G-protein and MAP-kinase cascades, resulting in an integrated response to environmental conditions...|$|R
2500|$|Unlike animals, {{plants are}} limited {{in their ability to}} seek out {{favorable}} conditions for life and growth.

2500|$|Kudzu spreads by <b>vegetative</b> <b>reproduction</b> via stolons (runners) that root at the nodes to form {{new plants}} and by rhizomes. [...] Kudzu will also spread by seeds, which are {{contained}} in pods and mature in the autumn, although this is rare. One or two viable seeds are produced per cluster of pods. The hard-coated seeds can remain viable for several years, and will successfully germinate only when soil is persistently soggy for five to seven days, with temperatures above 20°C (68°F). [...] Once germinated, saplings must be kept in a well-drained medium that retains high moisture. During this stage of growth, it is critical for kudzu to receive as much sunlight as possible. Kudzu saplings are sensitive to mechanical disturbance, and are damaged by chemical fertilizers. They do not tolerate long periods of shade, or high water tables.|$|E
2500|$|Elm {{propagation}} methods {{vary according}} to elm type and location, and the plantsman's needs. Native species may be propagated by seed. In their natural setting native species, such as wych elm and European White Elm in central and northern Europe and Field Elm in southern Europe, set viable seed in ‘favourable' seasons. Optimal conditions occur after a late warm spring. After pollination, seeds of spring-flowering elms ripen and fall {{at the start of}} summer (June); they remain viable for only a few days. They are planted in sandy potting-soil at a depth of one centimetre, and germinate in three weeks. Slow-germinating American Elm will remain dormant until the second season. Seeds from autumn-flowering elms ripen in the Fall and germinate in the spring. Since elms may hybridize within and between species, seed-propagation entails a hybridisation risk. In unfavourable seasons elm seeds are usually sterile. Elms outside their natural range, such as Ulmus procera in England, and elms unable to pollinate because pollen-sources are genetically identical, are sterile and are propagated by <b>vegetative</b> <b>reproduction.</b> <b>Vegetative</b> <b>reproduction</b> is also used to produce genetically identical elms (clones). Methods include the winter transplanting of root-suckers; taking hardwood cuttings from vigorous one-year-old shoots in late winter, taking root-cuttings in early spring; taking softwood cuttings in early summer; grafting; ground and air layering; and micropropagation. A bottom heat of 18 degrees and humid conditions are maintained for hard- and softwood cuttings. The transplanting of root-suckers remains the easiest and commonest propagation-method for European Field Elm and its hybrids. For 'specimen' urban elms, grafting to wych-elm root-stock may be used to eliminate suckering or to ensure stronger root-growth. The mutant-elm cultivars are usually grafted, the ‘weeping' elms 'Camperdown' and 'Horizontalis' at , the dwarf cultivars 'Nana' and 'Jacqueline Hillier' at ground level. Since the Siberian Elm is drought-tolerant, in dry countries new varieties of elm are often root-grafted on this species.|$|E
