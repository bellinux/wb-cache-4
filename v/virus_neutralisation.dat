This study was oriented around this pathogen; it’s structural proteins in particular, namely viral proteins 2 and 3 (VP 2 and VP 3). Two VP 2 fragments were expressed in E. coli and full length VP 3 was expressed in Pichia. These proteins were tested for their abilities to confer protection against IPNV in an Atlantic salmon trial. The serum was analysed by ELISA against whole <b>virus,</b> and in <b>neutralisation</b> assays. Differences in level of response were found between the groups at the various timepoints depending on the vaccination group in all analyses. The findings from this trial suggested that VP 3 had the strongest virus neutralising abilities as indicated from the 1 / 320 serum dilutions. VP 2 has been the protein that has attracted most interest for its potential as a vaccine component. The findings of this project suggest that the importance of VP 3 in protection of Atlantic salmon against IPNV has been underestimated. Another aspect of this study involved the investigation of signal sequence selection on the expression levels of the viral proteins. The outcome of this work indicated that expression of the viral proteins using the alpha mating factor signal could not be optimised. A random signal sequence library was constructed with the view to finding a novel signal(s) that was capable of yielding a higher VP 3 protein expression level than that obtained by using the alpha mating factor.

40|$|Equine herpesvirustype 1 (EHV- 1) is {{the most}} {{frequent}} viral cause for abortion in horses and also induces respiratory diseases as well as equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (Kydd et al. 2006). In order to minimise economic losses due to EHV- 1 -infection, a number of vaccines were developed, which however do not sufficiently stimulate cellular immune responses that are considered vital for protection against disease (Minke et al. 2006). Consequently, we compared the efficiency of two commercial vaccines against EHV- 1 -abortions. The aim was to investigate which vaccine rather induces cell-mediated immunity and better protection. All subjects were immunized regularly with the inactivated combination vaccine Duvaxyn®EHV 1, 4 before start of the study. In the study, 150 mares were continueously immunized with Duvaxyn®EHV 1, 4. In contrast, a group of 192 mares were immunized with the modified live virus vaccine Prevaccinol®, were mares immunized with Prevaccinol® {{were divided into two}} groups – one group that received the modified live virus vaccine for one year following the Duvaxyn®EHV 1, 4 regimen (DPS mares) and one that received Prevaccinol® treatment for two consecutive years (PPS mares). Serum samples taken at various times after vaccination were analysed in a <b>virus</b> serum <b>neutralisation</b> test (SNT). The results show that mares immunized with Prevaccinol® (especially the PPS-group) had significantly higher average SN titers in comparison to the animals immunized with Duvaxyn®EHV 1, 4. The foals of the immunized mares presented with very similar results. However, it was noticeable that the SN titers of foals declined dramatically in the third month of life irrespective of the applied vaccine. However, the major focus was on the analysis of the IgG isotpes (IgG 1, IgG 3 / 5 and IgG 4 / 7) induced by the vaccines by means of the ELISA. The ratio of different IgG isotypes is considered a surrogate for either a Th 1 (in case of IgG 1 and IgG 4 / 7) or a Th 2 based (in case of IgG 3 / 5) immune response. The ELISA should, therefore, clarify which of the vaccines induced a stronger cell-mediated immunity and, theoretically, would offer better protection against abortions caused by EHV- 1. As we obtained virtually identical results it was impossible to detect a difference between the two vaccines concerning the type of immunity induced. Finally, the number of abortions in the breeding season 2009 / 2010 was recorded. In total 55 out of 775 gestating mares aborted. By means of PCR, EHV- 1 induced abortion could be attested in nine cases. Seven mares suffering from an EHV- 1 -induced abortion were immunized with Duvaxyn®EHV 1, 4, whereas the remaining two mares had been immunized with Prevaccinol®. Although the difference was not significant, the result led us to conclude that, from a clinical viewpoint, the modified live virus vaccine Prevaccinol® offered a better protection against EHV- 1 abortions when compared to the inactivated combination vaccine Duvaxyn®EHV 1, 4...|$|R

40|$|Understanding the {{mechanisms}} used by HIV- 1 to evade antibody neutralisation {{may contribute to}} the design of a high-coverage vaccine. This thesis explores the mechanism used by a Tier 3 virus leading to its high antibody neutralisation resistance phenotype. This thesis also describes how the glycans {{at the base of the}} V 3 loop contribute to (i) breadth and potency in a cohort of unselected HIV- 1 -infected individuals and (ii) the selective pressures resulting from the V 3 /glycans shielding the <b>virus</b> from <b>neutralisation</b> and the glycans themselves being targets of broad antibody responses. HIV- 1 isolates that are highly resistant to broadly neutralising antibodies could limit the efficacy of an antibody-based vaccine. For this reason, it is important to understand {{the mechanisms}} behind high HIV- 1 resistance to neutralising antibodies. Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 of this thesis describe virus 253 - 11, a highly <b>neutralisation</b> resistant <b>virus,</b> which is particularly resistant to commonly-elicited, anti-membrane proximal external region (MPER) antibodies in sera. To further understand its resistance, mutations in the MPER were introduced that are known to delay fusion following CD 4 -binding and thus increase the time the virus spends in the open conformation. Interestingly, we found that these mutations affect the 253 - 11 Envelope (Env) spike before CD 4 -binding by destabilising the closed trimer structure. From these data, we hypothesized that the neutralisation resistance of 253 - 11 was due to an unusually tight, compact pre-fusion Env trimer that resists transient changes to the open conformation. The open conformation frequently exposes narrowly-neutralising antibody epitopes. Because the unliganded 253 - 11 Env presumably transitions infrequently into the open conformation, it would be able to evade these responses. 253 - 11 was sensitive to most but not all of the most potent broadly neutralising antibodies (bnAbs) tested, most likely because those broadly neutralising antibodies can access their epitopes in the pre-fusion Env conformation. To gain further information about the structure of the 253 - 11 Env, we designed a recombinant 253 - 11 SOSIP trimer and found it to be stable and predominantly adopt a closed conformation. The crystal structure of the SOSIP trimer revealed structural elements likely responsible for 253 - 11 Env compactness including the inward disposition of the heptad repeat helices and gp 120 protomers towards the trimer axis. Taken together, the data from Chapter 2 and Chapter 3 highlight an underappreciated Env compactness mechanism of HIV- 1 resistance to neutralising antibodies and these data may be useful in HIV- 1 immunogen design research. Previous candidate HIV vaccines have failed to induce wide-coverage neutralising antibodies capable of substantially protecting vaccinees. A key approach in HIV immunogen development has been to define and model epitopes recognised by anti-HIV bnAbs. Candidate immunogen models identified by bnAbs include the V 3 /glycans, the V 2 /apex and the MPER epitopes. Autoreactivity and polyreactivity of anti-V 3 /glycan and anti-MPER antibodies are thought to pose both direct and indirect barriers to achieving neutralisation breadth. Chapter 4 of this thesis explored which of these bnAb epitopes were associated with breadth and potency in a South African cohort of chronically HIV-infected individuals. The study found that antibodies targeting the V 3 /glycans were associated with breadth and potency. In contrast, antibodies to the V 2 /apex were not associated with neutralisation breadth/potency. This suggests that auto/polyreactivity are not critical factors in the development of breadth and potency and that the V 3 /glycans should remain a high-priority vaccine candidate. Since targeting the V 3 /glycans was associated with breadth and potency in this cohort, the study continued to look at this epitope to investigate the role of these glycans in neutralisation resistance of Tier 2 viruses. The HIV- 1 Env is surrounded by glycans that often prevent antibody neutralisation, leading to the term the "glycan shield", however some bnAbs have evolved to recognise these carbohydrates. Chapter 4 of this thesis describes how the N-linked glycan at position N 301 is critical for maintaining neutralisation resistance of one subtype C virus (Du 156. 12), but not for another subtype-matched virus (CAP 45. 2. 00. G 3). Thus, the loss of the N 301 glycan may have a substantial antibody-related fitness cost for some viruses but not others. The N 301 glycan, as well as glycans at positions 332 and 334, are the primary targets of the anti-V 3 /glycan class of neutralising antibodies, which may select for loss of the targeted glycan. The evidence presented in Chapter 4 suggests that in some viruses, loss of the N 301 glycan may result in evasion of anti-V 3 /glycan antibody responses while maintaining overall neutralisation resistance. This phenomenon may impair efficacy of passively-infused anti-V 3 /glycan bnAbs or a therapeutic vaccine...|$|R
40|$|Upon {{entry of}} the {{respiratory}} tract avian influenza virus (AIV) triggers early immune {{responses in the}} host that are aimed to prevent or in case of already established infection control this infection. Although much research is performed to elucidate {{the course of events}} that follow after AIV infection, the interactions between the virus and the host at molecular level at an early stage of infection are unclear. More insight in the mechanisms underlying innate and adaptive immune responses leading to pathogenesis or elimination of the AIV may contribute {{to a better understanding of}} AIV induced pathogenesis and new concepts for vaccine development. In this thesis we unravelled several aspects of early host responses after primary AIV infection and viral challenge in immunised chickens at host transcriptional level. The use of genome-wide microarray analysis in combination with more classical techniques allowed us to elucidate possible correlates of protection or pathogenesis at cellular and transcriptional level. This last chapter summarises the findings in this thesis. Respiratory epithelial cells are the first target of AIV infection and their initial response will affect the development of the host immune response. In mammals early host responses to AIV infection have been investigated using respiratory epithelial cell lines and primary epithelial cell cultures. Since chicken respiratory epithelial cell lines or primary cell cultures were not available at the time, we decided to explore the use of tracheal organ cultures (TOC) for this purpose as described in chapter 2. Although H 9 N 2 AIV was able to infect and replicate in TOC, virus specific gene expression profiles were masked by wound healing responses that are induced by preparation of TOC independent of the virus infection. Therefore only a small overlap was found in host response genes between infected TOC and in vivo infected trachea. We were able to keep TOC in culture for a longer time period, but histopathological changes occurred which would also affect host responses at transcriptional level. This implies that although TOC is a suitable model for culturing of virus and lectin or virus binding studies, it is not suitable for measuring early immune responses upon viral infection at transcriptional level. Upon entry of the respiratory tract AIV encounters several barriers that are able to block the virus from entering epithelial cells. One of these barriers are collectins which in mammals can bind and neutralize a wide range of pathogens including influenza A virus. Mammalian collectins have been implicated to play an important role in the early defense against influenza A virus infection, but for chicken collectins this is not yet clarified. In chapter 3 recombinant chicken Lung Lectin (cLL) was used to characterize structural and functional properties of this collectin. Purified recombinant cLL has lectin activity, but failed to neutralise influenza virus infectivity of the human isolates, while for an avian <b>virus</b> isolate <b>neutralisation</b> was seen once. On the other hand recombinant cLL proved to have haemagglutination inhibiting activity to at least one human influenza virus strain. How expression of chicken collectins is affected by influenza virus infection in the chicken is unknown and this was analyzed in chapter 4. Collectin mRNA expression was down regulated in lung and up regulated in trachea after AIV inoculation, indicating tissue specific expression. We also detected that the effect of AIV inoculation on collectin mRNA expression was age specific in both the trachea and lung and viral RNA expression only correlated with collectin mRNA expression in the lung of 1 -wk-old but not in 4 -wk-old birds. Without knowing the exact function of chicken collectins in innate defenses, it is difficult to relate the observed changes in gene expression to a biological effect. However, these findings indicate that in lung collectins may play a role in limiting respiratory infection in neonatal chickens. Before we could start with the in vivo analysis of early host responses to AIV infection in the respiratory tract at the molecular level, there was a simple question unanswered in literature. It was described that differences in influenza virus deposition in the lung of macaque had an affect on host responses at transcriptional level. Whether this uneven virus deposition occurred in the chicken was unknown. In chapter 5 we investigated whether differences in anatomy and airflow in the avian respiratory tract affected deposition of virus and subsequent host responses. Although the upper trachea contained more viral RNA than the lower trachea there were no significant differences in gene expression. Lung was divided into 4 segments according to airflow and anatomy, which proved to affect virus deposition in that lung segments containing the larger airways and the bifurcations to the secondary bronchi contained highest viral RNA levels. In lung differences in viral RNA distribution enhanced the differences in gene expression that were already seen in noninfected birds. Host responses shared by trachea, lung L 1 (cranial) and L 4 (caudal) have been previously described as common response to pathogens in mouse, rat, macaque and human indicating that these are common responses independent of the amount of viral RNA or the type of respiratory inflammatory disease. These common responses involved chemokine activity and inflammatory responses correlating to massive KUL- 01 + macrophage influxes. However, in trachea and L 1 more genes were expressed due to infection and larger KUL- 01 +, CD 4 + and CD 8 α+ cell influxes were found compared to L 4. These findings suggest that an unequal deposition of pathogens throughout an organ will induce localised responses and sampling at specific sites will affect the outcome of the study. The development of the avian immune system starts early during embryogenesis and reaches maturity several weeks after hatching. It is unknown to what extent and through which mechanisms the host responses to AIV infection are affected by age. For replication and transcription of the influenza virus genome, the virus uses both viral and cellular host factors. Whether age affects expression of these host factors and thereby AIV replication is also unknown. In chapter 6 the effect of age on early host responses to AIV and on host factors affecting replication in the respiratory tract were analyzed. Gene expression between 1 - and 4 -wk-old birds was compared in PBS inoculated control birds and in H 9 N 2 AIV inoculated birds early after inoculation. When comparing 1 - and 4 -wk-old control birds, most genes were expressed at a higher rate in 4 -wk-old birds, while genes related to innate responses and development of the respiratory immune system were expressed at a higher rate in 1 -wk-old birds. These differences in gene expression between the age groups related to differences in tissue development and maturation of the immune system. In AIV inoculated birds gene expression was most affected at 16 h. p. i. in 1 -wk-old birds, and at 16 and 24 h. p. i. in 4 -wk-old birds. Furthermore, in 1 -wk-old birds less genes were affected by AIV inoculation than in 4 -wk-old birds and which might be due to age-dependent reduced functionality of APC, T cells and NK cells. Expression of cellular host factors that block virus replication by interacting with viral factors was independent of age or tissue for most host factors. These data show that differences in development are reflected in gene expression and suggest that the strength of host responses at transcriptional level may be a key factor in age-dependent susceptibility to infection, and the cellular host factors involved in virus replication are not. To gain more insight in the mechanisms leading to protection after vaccination with different adjuvants, w/o, Al(OH) 3 and CpG, we investigated correlates of protection after AIV challenge, described in chapter 7. H 9 N 2 +w/o and H 9 N 2 +Al(OH) 3 vaccinated birds were protected based on low viral RNA expression. We found that protection after AIV challenge correlated to a lower number of genes induced after challenge and gene expression patterns with a low amplitude of change. The gene expression profile of protected birds showed that expression was especially up regulated at 1 d. p. c., while in unprotected birds higher and prolonged gene expression was found. Protected birds had smaller cellular influxes en high neutralizing antibody titers. These findings suggest that lack of immune activation is the most important correlate of protection after challenge with AIV most likely due to high neutralizing antibody titers resulting in lower viral RNA expression. Early host responses to respiratory virus infections are complex processes providing the first defense against AIV infection and are influenced by various factors as discussed in this thesis. The research into host responses is influenced by the sampling method, because airflow and anatomy affect virus distribution in the lung enhancing differences in host responses between different segments in the lung already seen in uninfected birds. This points out the importance of sampling approach which has to be taken into account when investigating in vivo responses to respiratory virus infections in large organs. Host responses themselves are directly affected by the age and adjuvants. Prolonged and enhanced responses relate to the maturation of the respiratory immune system and may be key factors in age-dependent susceptibility to infection and induction of protective responses. A high neutralizing antibody titer is a know correlate of a protective response. This correlate of protection relates to lower gene expression levels and less cellular influxes indicating that a lack of immune activation is the most important correlate of protection after AIV challenge. The findings presented in this thesis enhance our knowledge on the course of events that follow early after AIV infection leading to pathogenesis or elimination of AIV...|$|R

The virus which proved to be pathogenic for dogs, was characterised as canine distemper virus on the basis of immunofluorescence, <b>virus</b> <b>neutralisation</b> and electron microscopical studies...|$|E
40|$|Rapid {{serotyping}} of {{bluetongue virus}} (BTV) isolates {{is required to}} facilitate the choice of an appropriate serotype-specific vaccine in a disease situation or to improve surveillance of BTV serotype prevalence. This communication describes the development and validation of a bluetongue virus fluorescent inhibition test (BTV FIT) as a rapid method to serotype Australian BTV isolates. The BTV FIT uses <b>virus</b> <b>neutralisation</b> principles {{similar to those used}} in the rabies rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test. The BTV FIT has the ability to provide an accurate serotype identification within 24 h thereby abbreviating the serotyping process by 3 - 4 days relative to conventional <b>virus</b> <b>neutralisation</b> assays and making the BTV FIT comparable time-wise with the polymerase chain reaction technique. The development of the BTV FIT is described using BTV reference viruses which have been isolated in Australia, and validation of the assay by assessment of five Australian BTV isolates of unknown serotype by comparison with the plaque inhibition method. The use of the BTV FIT readily facilitated rapid and accurate serotype identification of Australian BTV reference viruses and five unknown BTV isolates with results indicating full agreement with the plaque inhibition method...|$|E
40|$|The woylie (Bettongia penicillata ogilbyi) is a {{critically}} endangered small Australian marsupial {{that is in}} a state of accelerated population decline for reasons that are currently unknown. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the involvement of several viral pathogens through strategic serological testing of several wild woylie populations. Testing for antibodies against the Wallal and Warrego serogroup of orbiviruses, Macropod herpesvirus 1 and Encephalomyocarditis virus in woylie sera was undertaken through <b>virus</b> <b>neutralisation</b> tests. Moreover, testing for antibodies against the the alphaviruses Ross River virus and Barmah Forest virus and the flaviviruses Kunjin virus and Murray Valley encephalitis virus was undertaken through <b>virus</b> <b>neutralisation</b> tests and ELISA mainly because of the interest in the epidemiology of these important zoonoses as it was considered unlikely to be the cause of the decline. Between 15 and 86 samples were tested for each of the four sites in south-western Australia (Balban, Keninup, Warrup and Karakamia). Results indicated no exposure to any of the viral pathogens investigated, indicating that all populations are currently naïve and may be at risk if these pathogens were to be introduced...|$|E
40|$|Sets of serum {{and milk}} samples were {{collected}} from various countries and prepared, lyophilised and distributed by 1 laboratory to 12 reference laboratories in Europe. The serum sets contained the three European bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV 1) reference serum samples (EU 1, EU 2 and EU 3), serum samples from naturally and experimentally BHV 1 -infected cattle, from vaccinated, and vaccinated-challenged cattle, from uninfected cattle, {{and a series of}} serum dilutions. In addition, sets of milk samples were distributed. The samples were tested for antibodies against BHV 1 in <b>virus</b> <b>neutralisation</b> tests, in gB-specific ELISAs, in indirect ELISAs and in gE-specific ELISAs. It was found that the <b>virus</b> <b>neutralisation</b> test and the gB-specific ELISAs were most sensitive for the detection of antibodies in serum, whereas for assaying milk samples the indirect ELISAs were the tests of choice. The results show that the quality of most laboratories appeared to be adequate, but that one laboratory performed considerably below an acceptable level of quality. Four samples from the panel have been proposed that might be selected as reference sera in addition to the three European reference sample...|$|E
40|$|In total, 14 608 pig sera, {{collected}} between 2008 and 2011, {{were tested}} with ELISA using antibodies specific for {{bovine viral diarrhoea}} virus (BVDV). All doubtful and positive samples were retested by <b>virus</b> <b>neutralisation</b> test (neutralising peroxidase-linked assay). The BVDV seroreagents were detected in 11 (68. 75 %) out of 16 provinces, the seroprevalence varied from 0. 1 % to 1. 04 % (average 0. 31 %). The obtained {{results indicate that the}} prevalence of BVDV infection in pig population in Poland is low...|$|E
40|$|Background: Chicken {{red blood}} cells (RBCs) are {{commonly}} used in hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests to measure hemagglutinating antibodies against influenza viruses. The use of horse RBCs in the HI test can reportedly increase its sensitivity when testing human sera for avian influenza antibodies. This study aims to compare the proportion of positives detected and the agreement between two HI tests using either chicken or horse {{red blood cells}} for antibody detection in sera of ducks experimentally infected or naturally exposed to Indonesian H 5 subtype avian influenza virus. In addition, comparison with a <b>virus</b> <b>neutralisation</b> (VN) test was conducted with the experimental sera...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To examine {{flying foxes}} (Pteropus spp.) for {{evidence}} of infection with Menangle virus. Design: Clustered non-random sampling for serology, virus isolation and electron microscopy (EM). Procedure: Serum samples were collected from 306 Pteropus spp. in northern and eastern Australia and tested for antibodies against Menangle virus (MenV) using a <b>virus</b> <b>neutralisation</b> test (VNT). Virus isolation was attempted from tissues and faeces collected from 215 Pteropus spp. in New South Wales. Faecal samples from 68 individual Pteropus spp. and four pools of faeces were examined by transmission EM following routine negative staining and immunogold labelling. Results: Neutralising antibodies (VNT titres ≥ 8) against MenV were detected in 46...|$|E
40|$|Feline sera from Bursa {{province}} (Turkey) were assayed for coronavirus antibody {{using an}} {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA). The study was performed on 100 sera collected from cats belonging to catteries or community shelters and to households. The serum samples were initially tested with the <b>virus</b> <b>neutralisation</b> (VN) test {{and the results were}} then compared with the ELISA. The VN yielded 79 negative and 21 positive sera but the ELISA confirmed only 74 as negative. The ELISA-negative sera were also found to be free of feline coronoviruses-specific antibodies by Western blotting. Using the VN as the gold standard test, ELISA had a sensitivity of 100...|$|E
40|$|We {{analysed}} 304 serum samples {{drawn from}} Tanzanian {{dogs in the}} widely used fluorescent antibody <b>virus</b> <b>neutralisation</b> assay (FAVN) and a neutralisation assay using pseudotypes bearing rabies G-proteins. An overall specificity of 100 %, sensitivity of 94. 4 % and strong correlation (r 2 = 0. 915) were observed. Using lacZ as the pseudotype reporter did not effect the correlation (r 2 = 0. 918) and allowed detection {{without the need for}} expensive reagents or equipment. Freeze-thaw cycles decreased rabies pseudotype viral titre by 3. 7 %/cycle and storage at room temperature for a week resulted in a 22. 6 % decrease. This robust assay can also be applied to other highly pathogenic infections...|$|E
40|$|Berrimah (BRH) {{virus is}} a {{rhabdovirus}} closely related antigenically to bovine ephemeral fever (BEF) virus. Two cows were given two doses of purified BRH virus with Qui! A adjuvant, 22 days apart. There was no clinical reaction and a minimal skin reaction.
