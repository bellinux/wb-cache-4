50|$|Political {{opposition}} in the USSR was barely visible and, with rare exceptions, of little consequence. Instead, {{an important element of}} dissident activity in the Soviet Union was informing society (both inside the Soviet Union and in foreign countries) about violation of laws and human rights.

40|$|Philosophers, and theorists {{in other}} disciplines, have {{disagreed}} over the character, function and mechanisms of emotions. Amongst the persistent {{issues that have}} arisen {{is the question of}} what exactly emotions are. Are they a <b>vivid</b> perceptual <b>awareness</b> of physiological processes? Evaluative judgments? Dispositions? Neurophysiological states? Or perhaps an aggregate of {{some or all of the}} above? Typically, theorists who study the emotions have tended to divide into two camps. On the one hand there are those who adopt a broadly biological / adaptationist perspective, which emphasises the corporeal nature of emotions. On the other side of the divide are those who adopt a socio-constructivist perspective, which emphasises the cognitive nature of emotions. Proponents of the biological stance have tended to favour universal, basic emotions whilst socio-constructivists tend to favour the more exotic. In support of the latter approach a significant literature has emerged from ethnography, anthropology and cognitive linguistics. This literature adopts a “lexicocentric” perspective on the emotions. The biological/adaptationist perspective seems to capture something important and right about the essential nature of emotions. However, the aim of my thesis is to demonstrate that the basic emotions theory, as characterised by Ekman, is weakened by its failure to pay attention to, and fully to engage with, the literature regarding the effect of language on our emotional landscape, an area which has ostensibly been the domain of the social constructionist. I argue that what is required is a linguistically inclusive theory of emotion. Such a theory acknowledges that any coherent and comprehensive theory of emotion must include a robust linguistic and cultural element...|$|R
40|$|Amputees may {{experience}} stump pain (SP), phantom limb (PL) sensations, pain, and/or a general {{awareness of the}} missing limb. The mechanisms underlying these perceptions could involve nervous system neuroplasticity and be reflected in altered sensory function of the residual limb. Since {{little is known about}} the progression of post-amputation sensory phenomena over time, we longitudinally evaluated the stability of, and relationships among: 1) subjective reports of PL sensations, pain, awareness, and SP, 2) stump tactile and tactile spatial acuity thresholds, and 3) use of a functional vs. a cosmetic prosthesis in 11 otherwise healthy individuals with recent unilateral, traumatic upper-extremity amputation. Subjects were evaluated within 6 months and at 1 – 3 years after amputation. Processing of tactile sensory information from the stump remained stable over the study time period. PL awareness was frequent, stable over time, intense, and occurred with or without PL sensations. Functional prosthetic use correlated with stable vividness of PL awareness whereas subjects who used a cosmetic prosthesis had less <b>vivid</b> PL <b>awareness</b> at follow-up. Initial SP correlated with follow-up SP, the initial PL pain correlated with follow-up PL pain but neither initial nor follow-up SP appear to be related to follow-up PL pain after accounting for initial PL pain intensity. Neither limb temperature nor prosthesis-use correlated with the initial vs. follow-up change in PL pain intensity. These data provide evidence that PL pain described 1 – 3 years after an amputation is not related in any simple way to peripheral sensory function, SP, or limb temperature; and PL awareness but not PL pain may be influenced by the frequent use of a functional prosthesis...|$|R
50|$|While touring with La Barraca, García Lorca {{wrote his}} now best-known plays, the Rural Trilogy of Blood Wedding, Yerma and The House of Bernarda Alba, which all rebelled against {{the norms of}} bourgeois Spanish society. He called for a rediscovery of the roots of European theatre and the {{questioning}} of comfortable conventions such as the popular drawing room comedies of the time. His work challenged the accepted {{role of women in}} society and explored taboo issues of homoeroticism and class. García Lorca wrote little poetry in this last period of his life, declaring in 1936, “theatre is poetry that rises from the book and becomes human enough to talk and shout, weep and despair.” Travelling to Buenos Aires in 1933 to give lectures and direct the Argentine premiere of Blood Wedding, García Lorca spoke of his distilled theories on artistic creation and performance in the famous lecture Play and Theory of the Duende. This attempted to define a schema of artistic inspiration, arguing that great art depends upon a <b>vivid</b> <b>awareness</b> of death, connection with a nation's soil, and an acknowledgment of the limitations of reason.|$|E

40|$|Equity (diversity, anti-oppression) {{training}} {{refers to}} teaching self-awareness of social location, privilege/disadvantage that mainstream culture perpetuates, and working self-reflectively for equity in everyday interactions amid diversity. This paper investigates {{the efficacy of}} equity training {{on the basis of}} mindfulness, compassion, and an intersectional/complex identity. Mindfulness refers to a <b>vivid</b> <b>awareness</b> of the present moment, of one’s own embodiment, thoughts, and emotions, fostering self-awareness and compassion. A complex conception of identity in an intersectional approach recognizes that people hold multiple statuses and I propose that this helps them self-identify with both privilege and disadvantage beyond dichotomic notions, finger pointing, and angry reactions. I first discuss the relevant theory of intersectionality and compassion, and consider the significance of this kind of approach to equity training. I then report the outcome of my pilot study that compares the impressions of two small groups of trainees in different equity workshops who were interviewed: The target group attended a workshop based on mindfulness exercises within an intersectional framework, and the comparison group attended a workshop not based on mindfulness, but that included information about privilege, disadvantage, and compassion. The findings point to an enhanced and emotionally involved self-awareness in respondents that participated in the target group workshop, based on mindfulness and empathy enhancing exercises...|$|E
40|$|If machine {{audition}} {{can recognize}} an auditory scene containing simultaneous and moving talkers, {{what kinds of}} awareness will people gain from an auditory scene visualizer? This paper presents the design and implementation of 3 D Auditory Scene Visualizer based on the visual information seeking mantra, i. e., “overview first, zoom and filter, then details on demand”. The machine audition system called HARK captures 3 D sounds with a microphone array, localizes and separates sounds, and recognizes separated sounds by automatic speech recognition (ASR). The 3 D visualizer implemented in Java 3 D displays each sound stream as a beam originating {{from the center of}} the microphones (overview mode), shows temporal snapshots with/without specifying focusing areas (zoom and filter mode), and shows detailed information about a particular sound stream (details on demand). In the details-ondemand mode, ASR results are displayed in a “karaoke” manner, i. e., character-by-character. This three-mode visualization will give the user auditory awareness enhanced by HARK. In addition, a face-tracking system automatically changes the focus of attention by tracking the user’s face. The resulting system is portable and can be deployed in any place, so it is expected to give more <b>vivid</b> <b>awareness</b> than expensive high-fidelity auditory scene reproduction systems. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract When {{crossing}} {{borders to}} foreign lands in Europe {{to look for}} opportunities of bettering their lives, African women often carry with them a <b>vivid</b> <b>awareness</b> and after taste of their history of subordination by their colonizers {{during the period of}} colonization as well as an awareness of the subordination by men, which is part of their cultural heritage from their countries which favor patriarchy. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine how these women adapt and learn through self development in the new culture which is different from their own. By sharing their experiences of acquiring knowledge in formal and informal settings in the original and the new host culture through in-depth interviews, it is hoped that the women brought an awareness and understanding to the host culture as well as a degree of self awareness and self appreciation as they come into terms with the events of their past which shaped them to be who they are, whilst they negotiate the present to prepare for a better future through self development. To analyze the data and to understand the different perspectives of the participants as well as to explain the different strategies which the participants employed whilst adapting to the Norwegian society alongside literature review, the following theories were used, the constructivist epistemology, discourse analysis, the theory of transformative learning and the standpoint feminist theory. The sample of this qualitative case study was made up of ten participants from eight Anglophone African countries and two teachers from the Norwegian Language School. The study revealed that through socialization by enculturation and acculturation in the home and the school, the women learnt how to be vocal in informal settings and silent in formal settings. By moving to the new culture the women had to learn to find their voice and break that silence. They also learnt to break the pattern of subordination brought about by colonization and patriarchy to struggle for a position as well as recognition in the new culture, which misconstrues the discourse of silence as lack of knowledge. The findings revealed that the silence and the reluctance to express themselves especially in formal settings has cultural interpretations and originated from their early socialization. Silence is regarded as a way of showing respect for authorities; it does not necessarily mean that the women are unknowledgeable. The study also showed that the women employed different strategies in adjusting to the constructivist approach to acquiring knowledge in formal settings, as well as certain strategies to adapt to their new situation in a culture that is very different from their own. Whilst the women experienced constructivism only in the informal settings in their countries of origin it became a disorienting phenomenon when they had to learn to adjust to this approach of knowledge acquisition in the formal setting, which they found in the Norwegian education system as opposed to what they had been socialized to in their countries. The findings revealed that most of the women are still frustrated by the failed efforts in their endeavors to try and get satisfying employment which they feel they deserve due to their academic achievements. This phenomenon present in the labor market is a hindrance to the successful adaptation of the African women. Another important finding in this study is the strategies that the women employed to negotiate gender roles, which they faced in the new culture that were different from what they were used to in their original cultures. Whilst the egalitarian structures in Norway placed the women in the same footing as men, the women in this study remained aware that they had to incorporate their culture and find the balance between the two cultures which have opposing values...|$|E
