30|$|On these grounds, the {{government}} approved in July 2011 {{a new law}} for <b>Vocational</b> <b>Studies</b> aimed precisely at enabling the transition from secondary degree in ESO to professional programs for {{students who did not}} complete their degree. Hence, the new law facilitates the transition to specific programs for professional training. Until now, those were limited to those individuals aged 16 or older who did not complete ESO. Instead, under the new law, individuals aged 15 can have access to these programs for professional training and, if they succeed they can continue towards <b>Vocational</b> <b>Studies.</b> Similarly, the new law enables individuals moving from Medium <b>Vocational</b> <b>Studies</b> to High <b>Vocational</b> <b>Studies</b> without the need of completing secondary non-compulsory school (Bachillerato), and after taking a special course. For that, around 20 - 30 % places in High <b>Vocational</b> <b>Studies</b> will be reserved. All these new measures will probably contribute in reducing the high incidence of dropout and are quite in line with our findings.|$|R

30|$|We observe, for example, that Austria and Czech Republic are characterised {{by a high}} {{proportion}} of <b>vocational</b> <b>studies</b> in upper education and they also have a high rate of vocational programs that combine school and work. Other countries with a relatively high prevalence of <b>vocational</b> <b>studies</b> are Belgium, the Netherlands and Finland. On the lower spectrum are located Greece, United Kingdom and Portugal. 4 The educational system in each country is the result of educational reforms that took place over the last century (see next section). In this sense, it is very interesting to analyse the implementation of the Spanish educational reform in 1990. The new law somehow moved against this principle by abolishing the possibility of undertaking <b>vocational</b> <b>studies</b> at earlier stages.|$|R
