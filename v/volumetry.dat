In each patient, the volumes of the upper limbs were estimated by three physical therapists using circumference measurements, water displacement and optoelectronic <b>volumetry.</b> One of the physical therapists performed each measure twice. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), relative differences, and limits of agreement were determined. Intrarater and interrater reliability ICCs ranged from 0. 94 to 1.

Multidetector computed tomography and MR images were reconstructed using different slice thicknesses (2, 4, 6, and 8 mm). Total liver volumes (TLVs) were measured by 2 independent readers based on different slice thicknesses using semiautomatic software. Results were compared with TLVs based on 2 -mm slices that served as standard of reference. The time to perform each <b>volumetry</b> was recorded. RESULTS: For MDCT <b>volumetry,</b> a statistical difference was seen only between TLVs based on 2 -mm versus 8 -mm slices (P = 0. 012 and P = 0. 002 for readers 1 and 2, respectively). For MR <b>volumetry,</b> no statistical difference was seen between TLVs of the standard of reference and TLVs based on 4 -, 6 -, and 8 -mm slices. Regarding the time to perform <b>volumetry,</b> there was a significant gain of time for both readers when <b>volumetry</b> was performed on 6 - and 8 -mm MDCT slices and on 4 -, 6 -, and 8 -mm MR slices (P < 0. 0167) when compared with the standard of reference.

Ocular volumetrywas performed in 15 volunteers twice in 1 week by using contiguous axial images of the globeswhile the subjects stared at a target, and images were acquired in 2 seconds before the subjects were instructed to blink, with this process repeated as necessary.

Aim of the present work {{was to investigate the}} reproducibility of optoelectronic leg <b>volumetry</b> over 3 weeks' time period and to eliminate daytime related within-individual variability. Methods Optoelectronic leg <b>volumetry</b> was performed in 63 hairdressers (mean age 45 ± 16 years, 85. 7 % female) in standing position twice within a minute for each leg and repeated after 3 weeks. Both lower leg (leg BD) and whole limb (limb BF) <b>volumetry</b> were analysed. Reproducibility was expressed as analytical and within-individual coefficients of variance (CV A, CV W), and as intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC). Results A total of 492 leg volume measurements were analysed. Both leg BD and limb BF <b>volumetry</b> were highly reproducible with CV A of 0. 5 % and 0. 7 %, respectively. Within-individual reproducibility of leg BD and limb BF <b>volumetry</b> over a three weeks' period was high (CV W 1. 3 % for both; ICC 0. 99 for both). At both visits, the second measurement revealed a significantly higher volume compared to the first measurement with a mean increase of 7. 3 ml ± 14. 1 (0. 33 % ± 0. 58 %) for leg BD and 30. 1 ml ± 48. 5 ml (0. 52 % ± 0. 79 %) for limb BF volume.

Computer assisted tumor <b>volumetry</b> requires time-consuming slice-by-slice manual or semi-automated segmentation.

Methods: In contrast-enhanced diagnostic CT scans of 74 patients with incident advanced HNSCC, manual slice-by-slice segmentation <b>volumetry</b> of primary tumor, total- and largest suspect cervical LN served as the reference method.

Nodules were independently double read by two readers using commercially available <b>volumetry</b> software. The software offers readers three different analysing algorithms. We compared the inter-observer variability of nodule <b>volumetry</b> when the readers {{used the same}} and different algorithms. RESULTS: Both readers were able to correctly segment and measure 72 % of nodules. In 80 % of these cases, the readers chose the same algorithm.

When the readers used different algorithms, 83 % of measurements showed a difference of > 25 %. CONCLUSION: Modern volumetric software failed to correctly segment {{a high number of}} screen detected nodules. While choosing a different algorithm can yield better segmentation of a lung nodule, reproducibility of volumetric measurements deteriorates substantially when different algorithms were used.

However, the diagnostic value of visual inspection and <b>volumetry</b> of medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) on MRI in a clinical setting is insufficiently known.  METHODS—Medial temporal lobe atrophy in 143 patients was visually rated from hard copies, using a 0 - 4 rating scale and a comparison was made with the volumes (cm 3) of the medial temporal lobe as estimated with <b>volumetry,</b> using a stereological method. All patients were recruited in an unselected way in a clinical setting in the centre for memory impairments at the Huddinge University Hospital. Patients with Alzheimer's disease (n= 41), patients with other dementias (vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and unspecified dementia; n= 36) as well as non-demented subjects (n= 66) were included. Medial temporal atrophy and <b>volumetry</b> were evaluated as a diagnostic tool by performing logistic regression analysis including age, sex, and mini mental state examination (MMSE) score and calculating the sensitivity and specificity and percentage correct classification.  RESULTS—Visual and volumetric analysis yielded statistically significant differences between patients with Alzheimer's disease and non-demented subjects, as well as between those with other dementias and non-demented subjects. Combining MMSE scores and visually rated MTA ratings yielded a sensitivity of 95 % for Alzheimer's disease, 85 % for other dementias.
