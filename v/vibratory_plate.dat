40|$|This study {{investigates the}} motion of micro parts on several <b>vibratory</b> <b>plates</b> with {{saw-tooth}} surface profile driven by a piezoelectric actuator. The surfaces are made of carbide, brass, and zirconia with the same profiles as a saw-tooth. The velocity and position of micro-parts are time-dependently measured by the particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) method where the Canny edge detection technique is used. In the present experiment, 2012 -type micro-parts whose dimensions are 2. 0 × 1. 2 × 0. 6 mm 3 in length, width, and depth, respectively, are employed. The mass of each micro-part is 7. 5 mg. Using a high-speed camera, the tracked longitudinal displacement resolution {{is found to be}} about 0. 01 mm, which is small in comparison with the length of each micro-part. The obtained results show that unidirectional motion can be attained by the present feeder system. For the same oscillating frequencies and amplitudes applied to the saw-tooth surfaces, the motion behavior of micro-parts varies for different experiments and surfaces. This implies that {{the motion of}} micro-parts is affected by uncertain causes. However, the probability distribution of the micro-parts’ velocity can be approached by a Gaussian distribution...|$|R
40|$|Compaction of {{backfill}} in confined spaces on highway {{projects is}} often performed with small <b>vibratory</b> <b>plates,</b> {{based solely on}} the experience of the contractor, leading to inadequate compaction. As a result, the backfill is prone to erosion and often exhibits excessive settlements, causing loss of support beneath pavements. The scope of this project includes developing standard specifications for two alternative hydraulic compaction methods, flooding and jetting, which additionally are suitable in confined spaces. During flooding, or compaction by drainage, the backfill layer is saturated with water from the surface and allowed to drain. During jetting, a probe emitting a high pressure jet of water is inserted into the layer, and the backfill is allowed to drain. In both cases the energy of the flowing water and residual suction upon drainage increase the effective stress and move the grains into a denser arrangement. The results in the lab indicate that for compaction by drainage applications, uniform, rounded soils achieve the highest relative density due to their minimal particle interlocking upon deposition and subsequent high drainage capacity. Meanwhile during jetting applications, soils liquefy locally around the jet of water, and their compactness upon drainage is highly dependent on the hydraulic gradient, or the energy with which water drains from the pore space. Greater hydraulic gradient during the drainage phase of jetting has been observed to produce more compact soil structure...|$|R

40|$|The {{object of}} the {{research}} {{was to examine the}} possibilities of using fast, new test procedures in service trench construction, to consider the validity of the information provided by such procedures, and to provide a comparison between the new test procedures and existing procedures embodied in the legislation and guidelines. In the course of the study, the new spot-based fast processes (dynamic plate loading test, sounding by means of service trench probe) were employed in addition to the established spot-based procedures (density measurement to DIN 18 125, radiometric density measurement, static plate loading test to DIN 18 134, soundings to DIN 4 094). The use of wide-area dynamic test procedures using vibratory rollers and vibratory compactors was also studied. The fast test methods, particularly dynamic plate loading test and wide-area dynamic density monitoring, are subject to influence not only from the ground type (grain distribution, grain quality, water content, etc.), but also from the trench geometry. Variations in the stiffness around the measuring point and the distance from trench fittings (pipes, manholes, trench irregularities) also have a bearing. Provided certain side constraints are taken into consideration, the service trench probe and dynamic plate loading equipment can be used for density monitoring, even in narrow service trenches. The dynamic loading plate can also be used for testing stiffness. Good correlations were often reached between the conventional and the new test results on the ground types tested. Wide-area dynamic density monitoring in service trenches can at present be used with vibratory rollers only if large distances are maintained between the acceleration recorder and interferences (trench irregularities, trench slopes, manholes, pipes, etc.). <b>Vibratory</b> <b>plates</b> caused technical measurement problems which could not be solved {{in the course of this}} research project.

40|$|Introduction: Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), {{which occurs}} after {{eccentric}} exercises, maycause some reduction in ability in sport activities. For this reason, numerous recovery strategies have beenused {{in an attempt}} to control the inflammatory-type response. Physical modalities have demonstrated noeffect on the alleviation of muscle soreness or other DOMS symptoms. Whole-body vibration (WBV) hasbeen suggested as a viable warm-up in sport fields. However, {{there is a lack of}} scientific evidence tosupport the protective effects of WBV-Training (WBVT) on muscle damage. Material and Methods: Thirty-two healthy untrained volunteers randomly assigned into two groups:WBVT (n= 15) and control (n= 17). Subjects performed 6 sets of 10 maximal isokinetic (60 °. s- 1) eccentriccontractions of knee extensors with dominant limb on a dynamometer. In the WBVT group before eccentricexercise, whole body vibration was applied using a <b>vibratory</b> platform (Power <b>Plate,</b> 35 Hz, 5 mm peak-topeakamplitude), with 100 ° knee flexion for 60 seconds while no vibration was applied in the control group. DOMS criteria (serum creatine kinase (CK), pressure pain threshold (PPT), muscle soreness, thighcircumference and maximal voluntary isometric exertion) were recorded at baseline, immediately after, 1 to 14 days postexercise. Results: WBVT group showed significant reduction of DOMS symptoms in terms of lower CK levels,less PPT, less muscle soreness and lower maximal isometric voluntary strength loss compared to the controlgroup (P 0. 05). Conclusions: The findings of this study showed that WBVT administered before eccentric exercise maycontrol and prevent DOMS and enhance the quadriceps muscle activity. Further investigation should beundertaken to ascertain the effectiveness of WBVT in athlete...|$|R
40|$|Vibratory rollers are {{commonly}} used for compaction of embankments and landfills. This task is time consuming and constitutes {{a significant part of}} most large construction and infrastructure projects. By improving the compaction efficiency, the construction industry would reduce costs and environmental impact. This research project studies the influence of the vibration frequency of the drum, which is normally a fixed roller property, and whether resonance can be utilized to improve the compaction efficiency. The influence of frequency on roller compaction has not before been studied but the concept of resonance compaction has previously been applied successfully in deep compaction of fills and natural deposits. In order to examine the influence of vibration frequency on the compaction of granular soil, small-scale compaction tests of sand were conducted under varying conditions with a vertically oscillating plate. Subsequently, full-scale tests were conducted using a vibratory soil compaction roller and a test bed of crushed gravel. The results showed that resonance can be utilized in soil compaction by <b>vibratory</b> rollers and <b>plates</b> and that the optimum compaction frequency from an energy perspective is at, or slightly above, the coupled compactor-soil resonant frequency. Since rollers operate far above resonance, the compaction frequency can be significantly reduced, resulting in a considerable reduction in fuel consumption, environmental impact and machine wear. The thesis also presents an iterative equivalent-linear method to calculate the frequency response of a vibrating foundation, such as a compacting plate or the drum of a roller. The method seems promising for predicting the resonant frequency of the roller-soil system and can be used to determine the optimum compaction frequency without site- and roller-specific measurements.

40|$|Peaking {{deflection}} {{caused by}} compacting the sidefill, {{referred to as}} the maximum change of the pipe diameter divided by the undeformed diameter, is an important parameter in the design and safety check of buried pipelines. However, quantitative equations on the deflection useful for engineering practice are very limited. In this paper, a two-dimensional finite element analysis is used to investigate the peaking deflection of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipes. In the analyses, the pipe¿soil interaction is rationally modeled. A field trial is conducted and the finite-element modeling is evaluated by using the data measured in the field test. Parametric studies are also conducted to investigate the effects of pipe diameter, pipe stiffness, soil modulus, trench width, and compactor type on the peaking deflection of buried HDPE pipes. A new estimating tool is developed that considers the major influencing factors: pipe diameter, pipe stiffness, soil modulus, and compactor type (<b>vibratory</b> <b>plate</b> or rammer) to predict the peaking deflection of HDPE pipes, and the proposed method is finally verified by data reported in published studies. The comparison of the calculated and measured peaking deflections demonstrates a reasonably good prediction of the peaking deflection...|$|E
40|$|The {{inadequate}} of compaction of backfills near abutments, approach {{areas of}} culverts, and smaller widened portions of roads result in settlement of layers and premature failure of pavement. Compaction in these constrained areas {{is difficult because}} of the difficulty in maneuvering of compacting equipment such as heavy rollers. Various types of light compacting equipment like rammers, <b>vibratory</b> <b>plate</b> compactors, single-drum walk-behind rollers, and double-drum walk-behind rollers are being used for compaction of the materials in constrained areas. Locally available loamy soil was compacted to different layer thicknesses of 50, 100, 150, and 200 mm using selected plate compactors, single-drum walk-behind rollers, and double-drum walk-behind rollers. Field moisture-density relationships for this equipment are established. The studies indicate that the roller optimum moisture content (ROMC) is higher than the optimum moisture content (OMC) of Proctor compaction even after 10 passes for all the light compacting equipment used. The regression equations developed for predicting field density as a function of compacting moisture content in the field, number of passes, and thickness of layer for all the light compacting equipment can be used during construction.

40|$|Laboratory {{and field}} {{hydraulic}} conductivity tests {{have been conducted}} on soil samples to develop and verify the zone of acceptance for liner placement. Compaction testing and flexible wall hydraulic conductivity tests were performed on fifteen (15) samples to determine the dry unit weight, molding water content, and laboratory permeability. Five of the fifteen samples were compacted at Standard proctor energy, five were compacted at 75 percent of Standard proctor energy, and five were compacted at 50 percent of Standard proctor energy. The results obtained from the laboratory portion of the testing program (the zone of acceptance) are presented. A ten foot-long by ten foot-foot wide by four foot tall box was created in an environmentally controlled environment (indoor lab). Six inches of sand {{were placed in the}} bottom of the box and overlain with a geotextile filter fabric. An eight-inch thick loose lift of clay was then placed, and compacted into a six-inch thick lift using two passes of a <b>vibratory</b> <b>plate</b> compactor. Five nuclear density tests were conducted on the first lift to ensure the soil was compacted within the zone of acceptance. This procedure was then continued for the remaining three lifts.

Two of the landfill liner tests pads were covered with tents while one was not covered. The results obtained from the environmentally controlled TSB did not display the same changes in hydraulic conductivity associated with diurnal cycles of direct sunlight that were observed in the landfill test pads.

40|$|Nitrates {{pollution}} represents nowadays {{a serious}} issue related {{to the quality of}} groundwater; continuous growth of industrial-scale agricultures lead to an increase of nitrates content in groundwater in the last years. Several technologies have been validated as capable to promote in situ biological nitrates remediation, such as permeable reactive barriers (PRB), biotrench, biobarriers etc. These technologies are all characterised by the use of organic substrate that act as a slow release carbon source. In free dissolved oxygen absence, such organic carbon is further oxidised, by heterotrophic bacteria naturally present in soil, in compliance to anoxic metabolism by using nitrates bound oxygen. Such dissimilatory reaction converts nitrates in elemental nitrogen. Organic substrates capable to sustain this reaction are various and easily recoverable (e. g. sawdust, cotton, woodchips etc.); thus, several carbon source has been already tested. The present paper reports the results of batch test carried out on four organic substrates used to promote biological denitrification; in details the organic matters tested were: sawdust, pine bark, cork and olive pomace. The first step of experimental study was focused to evaluate the organic carbon release capability of each substrate; particularly, organic matter has been keep in contact with tap water for almost 10 days; thus, samples of water has been periodically collected to measure Total Organic Carbon (TOC). Further, microcosm batch test has been carried out to reproduce in situ biological groundwater denitrification. In details, each batch reactor was prepared with a mixture of organic matter and agricultural soil, used to provide heterotrophic bacteria capable to promote biological denitrification, kept in contact with tap water artificially spiked at 60 mg NO 3 -N L- 1.

40|$|Due to the {{findings}} of extensive damage on geogrids used in a road embankment in northern Sweden, the Swedish Transport Administration (TRV) started to investigate the reason of these damages. Since the geogrids were installed at low temperature, below 0 °C, it was suspected that the damages were connected the low temperature. To analyse whether low temperatures have an influence on the extent of installation damages, both a half-scale setup and temperature controlled tensile tests have been carried out on geogrids. In total five different types of geogrids have been tested; 3 extruded polypropylene geogrids, 1 woven PET geogrid, and 1 welded PET geogrid. All geogrids had an aperture size of approximately 35 mm and specified tensile strength of approximately 40 kN/m. The Half-scale tests was conducted by building a small road embankment inside a freeze container, at the Luleå University of Technology (LTU). The embankment contained crushed aggregate, type 0 - 70 mm, and geogrids. The purpose of the half-scale test was to simulate installation of geogrids at different temperatures and thereby investigate whether low temperatures have an influence on the rate of installation damages. The half-scale test was done for each type of geogrid at the temperatures: + 20 °C, - 20 °C and - 30 °C. First, the geogrid was covered by 150 mm of crushed aggregate. Then a <b>vibratory</b> <b>plate</b> (160 kg) was used to compact the crushed aggregate. After each installation, the crushed aggregate was removed carefully by vacuum suction. The geogrid was removed and then analysed by visual control and tensile tests conducted according to ISO 10319 : 2008 (wide width tensile test). Results from the half-scale tests indicate that 2 out of 5 of the tested geogrids were affected by the testing procedure. The results indicate that: -        one of the geogrids of polyprophylene (here referred to as G 2) was more damaged at lower temperatures compared to installation at + 20 ° C. -        the geogrid of woven PET (here referred to as G 5) was less damaged at lower temperatures compared to installation at + 20 ° C. Results for the other geogrids are either inconsistent or shows no significant variation of the measured parameters as function of temperature. Hence, these results cannot be interpreted as damage during installation. Temperature controlled tensile tests were done by tensile testing single strands from the geogrids to failure, inside a temperature controlled chamber. The purpose of these tests was to investigate how the strength properties of the geogrids are affected by low temperature. The test was repeated 5 times for each geogrid and temperature (+ 20 °C, 0 °C, - 10 °C and - 20 °C). Force and strain was measured during the tests. The results from the temperature controlled tensile tests show that the maximum strain decreases with lower temperature for all tested geogrids. The maximum strain decreased by 16 % - 49 % when the temperature dropped from + 20 °C to - 20 °C. The results show that the tensile strength increases with lower temperature for all tested geogrids except for the welded PET geogrid (here referred to as G 1). For G 1 the tensile strength decreased by approximately 7 % at a temperature drop from + 20 °C to - 20 °C. For the woven PET geogrid (G 5) and the polypropylene geogrids (G 2 -G 3) the tensile strength increased between 13 %- 45 % at a temperature drop from + 20 °C to - 20 °C. The E-modulus increased at lower temperature for all tested geogrids. The secant E-modulus at 2 % strain increased by 13 %- 71 % at a temperature drop from + 20 °C to - 20 °C. Summarized conclusions from the tests: Strength properties changed for all tested geogrids as the temperature decreased. All tested geogrids got stiffer at lower temperatures. The magnitude of the effects is different for different geogrids. The tensile strength increased with lower temperature for all tested geogrids except for the welded PET geogrid, which got lower tensile strength at lower temperature. The half-scale test indicates that the amount of installation damages at geogrids can be dependent of the temperature at installation. However, these indications can only be seen at two out of five tested geogrids. The effect cannot be connected to a specific step in the installation procedure and cannot be explained by the results from the temperature controlled tensile tests. The results from the half-scale test have a statistically low reliability since only one installation for each temperature and geogrid type was done. The compaction equipment used during the test was small, and had low compaction energy compared to a vibratory roller compactor commonly used in construction work. With respect to the discussion above, further studies should be focusing on developing the half-scale test. It is suggested that the test is scaled up to a full-scale test in order to simulate a real installation as close as possible. The test should also be conducted several times for each geogrid at each temperature in order to enable statistical analyses...|$|E
