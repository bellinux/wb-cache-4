40|$|We {{describe}} the complex global structure of giant components in directed multiplex networks which generalizes the well-known bow-tie structure, generic for ordinary directed networks. By definition, a directed multiplex network contains vertices of one type and directed edges of $m$ different types. In directed multiplex networks, we distinguish {{a set of}} different giant components based {{on the existence of}} directed paths of different types between their vertices, such that for each type of edges, the paths run entirely through only edges of that type. If, in particular, $m= 2 $, we define a strongly <b>viable</b> <b>component</b> as a set of vertices, in which for each type of edges, each two vertices are interconnected by at least two directed paths in both directions, running through the edges of only this type. We show that in this case, a directed multiplex network contains, in total, $ 9 $ different giant components including the strongly <b>viable</b> <b>component.</b> In general, the total number of giant components is $ 3 ^m$. For uncorrelated directed multiplex networks, we obtain exactly the size and the emergence point of the strongly <b>viable</b> <b>component</b> and estimate the sizes of other giant components.

40|$|Technical {{changes in}} air and sea {{transport}} since the 1950 S have had differential effects within the Pacific Islands region. Many islands are now disadvantaged {{in relation to}} a few main centers and core areas. Social, political, and economic changes have occurred, in part as concomitants of transport changes. New patterns of locational advantage for agricultural and commercial activity, education, and aid dependence have fostered internal and international migration, which has been accompanied by considerable social disruption. Overall economic prospects are limited, but the possibilities for niche manufacturing for export are demonstrated by recent Fijian and Samoan experience. Economic and spatial changes have led to modification of de facto land tenure and labor arrangements that may undermine the bases of sociopolitical systems.

The result is a model-based architecture and approach for developing software systems by piecemeal adaptation with the goal that they become adaptive systems at runtime. Software built in this manner is called Viable Software. Viable Software represents a unifying class of self-controlling software that is an intelligent control system. Cybernetics, Control Theory, and Complexity Theory are the background for this work, and aspects relevant to this work are presented. These results are related to software architecture and software engineering. Rationale for the selection of the Viable System Model as a basis for software systems is given.

However the real life situation often, differs from the theoretical one. In the allocation of resources one often has to consider various other influencing parameters which play a dominant role in the decision making process. The decision is often not only minimization of costs or maximization of profits but could be as complex as maximization of profit through minimization of costs which can be achieved through in-house production of the <b>viable</b> <b>components</b> and outsourcing of the non-viable ones.

40|$|BACKGROUND. In Oregon, adult {{foster care}} (AFC) homes, which are private residences where a live-in manager cares {{for one to}} five {{disabled}} residents, have been covered by Medicaid since 1981 and seem to offer a mainstream alternative to nursing homes. They house almost 6000 older people, two thirds of which pay privately. METHODS. In a cross-sectional study, we interviewed 400 AFC and 400 nursing home residents. Data analyses included descriptive cross-tabulations; hierarchial loglinear models for judging the effects of care setting and payment status on resident characteristics; and logit analyses for predicting care setting and payment status within care settings. RESULTS. On average, nursing home residents were more physically and cognitively impaired than AFC residents, but there was considerable overlap in patterns of frailty in the two settings. Medicaid AFC residents were less disabled than privately paying AFC residents. AFC residents reported more social activity, even when we controlled for disability status. AFC residents and their families {{were more likely to}} value privacy and homelike settings when choosing a care setting, whereas nursing home residents were more likely to value rehabilitation and organized activity programs. CONCLUSIONS. Both AFC and nursing homes are <b>viable</b> <b>components</b> of a long-term care repertoire.

RNA Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (RNA-FISH) has been successfully applied for phylogenetic identification of the <b>viable</b> <b>components</b> of the microbial communities colonizing artworks both in situ and ex situ. Until recently, it was time-consuming, taking not less than 6 h for the analysis. We have developed an RNA-FISH in suspension protocol that allowed ex situ analysis of microorganisms involved in artworks’ biodeterioration in 5 h. In this work, three modified protocols, involving microwave heating, were evaluated for further shortening two of the four main critical steps in RNA-FISH: hybridization and washing. The original and modified protocols were applied in cellular suspensions of bacteria and yeast isolates. The results obtained were evaluated and compared in terms of detectability and specificity of the signals detected by epifluorescence microscopy. One of the methods tested showed good and specific FISH signals for all the microorganisms selected and did not produce signals evidencing non-specific or fixation-induced fluorescence. This 3 h protocol allows a remarkable reduction of the time usually required for performing RNA-FISH analysis in Cultural Heritage samples. Thus, a rapid alternative for analyzing yeast and bacteria cells colonizing artworks’ surfaces by RNA-FISH is presented in this work...|$|E

40|$|Within {{the field}} of dental tissue engineering, the {{establishment}} of adequate tissue vascularization {{is one of the}} most important burdens to overcome. As vascular access within the tooth is restricted by the apical foramen, it is of major importance to implement effective vascularization strategies in order to recreate <b>viable</b> <b>components</b> of teeth and periodontal tissues. However, while the current regenerative approaches focus on the use of dental stem cells (DSCs), little is known about these cells and their ability to promote angiogenesis. Therefore, the present study aimed to elucidate the paracrine angiogenic properties of postnatal DSCs, in particular dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs), stem cells from the apical papilla (SCAPs) and dental follicle precursor cells (FSCs). An antibody array, together with RT-PCR and ELISA, pointed out the differential expression of pro-angiogenic as well as anti-angiogenic factors by cultured DSCs and human gingival fibroblasts (HGF- 1). Despite the secretion of proliferation-promoting factors, DSCs caused no notable increase in the proliferation of human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC- 1). With regard to other aspects of the angiogenic cascade, DPSCs, SCAPs and HGF- 1 significantly promoted endothelial migration in a transwell migration assay. DPSCs also had a pronounced effect on endothelial tubulogenesis, as was shown by an in vitro Matrigel™ assay. In the last part of this study, a chorioallantoic membrane assay demonstrated a sustained pro-angiogenic impact of DPSCs and SCAPs in an in vivo setting. Collectively, these data indicate a predominant pro-angiogenic influence of DPSCs and SCAPS in vitro and in vivo in comparison to FSCs, suggesting that both stem cell populations could potentially promote the vascularization of regenerated dental tissues. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the design, analysis, fabrication am evaluation of integrated optic lenses which are inhomogeneous either in physical shape or in refractive index profile. The thesis has nine chapters. Chapter one, the introduction, illustrates the importance of these lenses within the domain of integrated optiCS, where the complicated mathematical functions required to describe the lens profiles are most easily realised. Connections are made between the study of these lenses and the exciting new field of optical computing. A special class of non-uniform lenses which are conceptually perfect optical instruments forms the main area of interest in the present study. Historically, the development of these lenses has followed two distinct lines, related to two possible methods of physically obtaining the required variation in path of light rays passing through the lens. In one method the optical path is made to vary directly, whilst the other method involves controlling the fi'lysical path, and thus the optical path, through the principle of equivalence. The dual development has been continued in the field of integrated optiCS, where lenses based on direct control of the optical path are termed variable-index lenses and those based on physical path control are termed geodesic lenses. The perfect variable-index lens studied in this work was the well-known Luneburg lens. Perfect geodesic lens designs have also been published. The design formulae for both types of lens are presented in chapter two. A simpler lens, of spherical geometry, is also presented which is easily analyzed and characterised and which serves as an archetypal model against which the performance of the more sophisticated lenses can be assessed. Chapter three investigates the problems involved in modelling fabrication conditions in a thermal-evaporation-invacuum environment so that lens profiles can actually be constructed. Chapter four goes into methods of tracing rays through these lenses in some detail. Ray-tracing has long been the classical tool of optical designers, providing a useful guide to optical performance. Ray methods, which effectively provide image error evaluations, are not entirely-appropriate for those lenses which are conceptually perfect within the geometrical optics approximation. Diffraction effects prevent the lenses from attaining true perfection. In such cases the wave-field produced by the lenses in the image space is the important quantity. In chapter five, the beam-propagation method (BPM) is used to study diffraction arrl associated effects in inhomogeneous lenses. '!he method allows the propagation of complicated waveshapes in lnhomogeneous media, normally a difficult task. Furthermore, anlsotropic effects and the interaction between acoustic waves aoo optical waves can be studied with the method. Negative focal shifts are reported which are not predicted by geometrical optics or the usual approximate diffraction theories. The fabrication of lenses is considered in chapter six. Planar waveguide measurements car r ied out on the var ious materials used in the study are presented. A major problem in the fabrication of geodesic lenses, that of obtaining a uniform wavegulde layer over the complete lens area, is dealt with in some detail in chapter seven. In chapter eight, extensive tests on the experimental performance of several lenses are reported. Near diffraction-limited performance is reported for geodesic lenses. More limited performance figures are obtained for Luneburg lenses though the possibility of high performance is lndicated if profile resolution can be improved. The themes of the thesls are pulled together for discussion in chapter nine and conclusions are drawn as to the relative merits of the various lenses. Possible means of improving fabrication procedures, thus driving lenses closer to ultimate resolution limits, are presented. The greatest problem faced is that of scatter ing in the waveguide, which appears to be accentuated as the waveguide traverses the lens surface. If the scattering problem can be successfully dealt with it is concluded that integrated optical lenses could be important and <b>viable</b> <b>components</b> in addresslng the problem of fast, high-throughput data processing...|$|E

This renders the reuse of adaptation strategies faster and easier for course authors.
