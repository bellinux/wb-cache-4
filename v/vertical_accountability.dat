Merkel uses Robert Dahl's definition of political equality, which includes equality [...] "before the law and in the political process." [...] While equality can infringe upon freedom, an embedded democracy should establish a balance between equality and freedom; to preserve the equality-freedom equilibrium, there must be checks on government power (horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>accountability).</b>|$|E
5000|$|Within Merkel's {{model of}} {{embedded}} democracy, {{the regime of}} horizontal accountability works to constitutionally ensure that an appropriate amount of power is shared among the different institutions, which helps secure {{the civil rights of}} the people of the state. There should be agencies with the legal power to expose and punish governmental institutions for corruption or other unlawful actions. This ensures that no one branch gains a preponderance of power and is able to unduly influence the policies and governance of the state. This horizontal accountability works in tandem with <b>vertical</b> <b>accountability,</b> which is the systems by which citizens check the power of the government elections, the media, or civil society. However, horizontal accountability carries more weight in ensuring the internal embeddedness of democracy, as it is more frequently used than <b>vertical</b> <b>accountability</b> and has a more substantial support from the constitution of a state.

This article builds a theory-driven historical case study to describe the influence of path-dependent administrative, fiscal and political decentralization processes on development of the district health system and district manager decision-space. Methods included a non-exhaustive literature review of democratic governance in Ghana, and key informant interviews with high-level health system officials integral {{to the development of}} the district health system. Through our analysis we identified four periods of district health system progression: (1) development of the district health system (1970 - 85); (2) Strengthening District Health Systems Initiative (1986 - 93); (3) health sector reform planning and creation of the Ghana Health Service (1994 - 96) and (4) health sector reform implementation (1997 - 2007). It was observed that district manager decision-space steadily widened during periods (1) and (2), due to increases in managerial profile, and concerted efforts at managerial capacity strengthening. Periods (3) and (4) saw initial augmentation of district health system financing, further widening managerial decision-space. However, the latter half of period 4 witnessed district manager decision-space contraction. Formalization of Ghana Health Service structures influenced by self-reinforcing tendencies towards centralized decision-making, national and donor shifts in health sector financing, and changes in key policy actors all worked to the detriment of the district health system, reversing early gains from bottom-up development of the district health system. Policy feedback mechanisms have been influenced by historical and contemporary sequencing of local government and health sector decentralization. An initial act of administrative decentralization, followed by incomplete political and fiscal decentralization has ensured that the balance of power has remained at national level, with strong <b>vertical</b> <b>accountabilities</b> and dependence of the district on national level. This study demonstrates that the rhetoric of decentralization does not always mirror actual implementation, nor always result in empowered local actors. </p...|$|R

40|$|How to hold {{autonomous}} {{schools and}} school governing boards {{accountable for their}} decisions and performance has become a particularly pressing question for central governments in many OECD countries. Increasing complexity in education systems {{has led to a}} greater degree of freedom in decision making for many local authorities, school governing boards and schools. However despite this increasing decentralisation, central governments are still held responsible by the general public for ensuring high quality education. During the last ten years, school accountability has become a critical topic, triggered by the results of international benchmarks such as the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). This paper analyses trends in accountability mechanisms and processes and argues that <b>vertical</b> measures of <b>accountability,</b> that is, regulatory and school performance accountability, can be usefully augmented by horizontal measures involving multiple stakeholders.

40|$|It {{has been}} argued that "institutionalization" {{facilitates}} <b>vertical</b> <b>accountability</b> by providing for strong national parties, with somewhat deep roots in the society. In such settings, citizens with varying combinations of societal characteristics (i. e. race, religion, income, etc.) would be able to identify which party represents their cleavage-generated interests and vote for them, or vote them out of office if they fail their 'mandate. ' Voting for the party that represents one's cleavage-generated interests would make the system more stable, since there would be regularity in the way people vote. However, that may not provide the flexibility in voting behavior necessary for <b>vertical</b> <b>accountability</b> to occur. Instead of voters with strong (affective) attachment to a party, <b>vertical</b> <b>accountability</b> would rather require voters that cast their vote based on less stable characteristics of a party such as its past performance, president's evaluation, candidates' quality, and other issues argued by rational-choice theorists to be more important than an affective attachment. This dissertation research tested this hypothesis using survey data from Honduras that registered the voting behavior of different partisans during the national elections of 1997 and 2001. This research found that 'rational" voters (moderate partisans and independents) did incorporate the electoral flexibility necessary for electoral accountability. They also exhibited distinctive characteristics that confirm their responsibility for electoral accountability. Rational voters were more likely than affective voters to have higher levels of education and political knowledge and to be more critical of the president's performance, among other related attitudes. Notwithstanding the fact that Honduras has a highly institutionalized party system, the mechanisms through which electoral accountability came about were mainly abstention to vote for one's party and, to a much lesser extent, vote-switching. Thus, voting abstention may not necessarily be an undesirable voting behavior since it may actually {{play a key role in}} the realization of electoral accountability. In summary, this research proved that "affective" voters may provide the system with stability, but that "rational" voters are necessary for the flexibility required for electoral accountability...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to use an accountability framework to explain the emerging tensions in accountability and how an intended bottom-up approach became progressively supplanted. This paper is set within an emerging Zambian microfinance organisation moving into crisis. Design/methodology/approach – A series of semi-structured interviews were conducted with key local microfinance specialists, managers and accountants, clients and past and current loan officers. Live observation of the client-loan officer interface and internal meetings provided triangulation on accountability relationships in the midst of crisis. Data were analysed using NVIVO, a qualitative computer software package. Findings – The findings show that tensions between <b>vertical</b> and horizontal <b>accountability</b> in practice can be directly translated into heightened pressure and stresses on both the non-governmental organisation (NGO) and its loan officers, which constrain overall accountabilities to other stakeholders and disguise other potential dysfunctions. Research limitations/implications – This study focussed on accountability at the grassroots in microfinance NGOs with a social mission. It reveals potential for further personal, community and socially constituted accounting research within microfinance in particular. Originality/value – The paper adds to the literature on NGO accountability.

40|$|It {{has been}} long debated whether regime types have impacts on human development. More specifically, {{compared}} to authoritarianism, are democracies {{more likely to}} provide public goods, including infrastructure that improve food provision and health care, and thus enhance health? Some studies support an optimistic view, and argue that with the accountability mechanisms of democratic elections, democracy is helpful in improving health. Some recent studies challenge the optimistic argument, and point out good governance, rather than regime types, as a more crucial determinant of human development. Using a newly collected dataset that covers 173 countries over the years 1900 - 2012 and contains more nuanced measures than commonly used, we intend to disentangle the debate. The results suggest that across models with various specifications, regime types have more consistent effects than quality of government on health outcomes throughout the entire period. Furthermore, {{we find that the}} mixed results of extant studies are due to that 1) the commonly used governance indicators are measured only for the recent decades, and the sample does not reflect the entire range of variation; 2) the positive effects of democracy are especially salient once the level of democracy has achieved certain threshold; 3) the positive effects of democracy are especially stable when both <b>vertical</b> and horizontal <b>accountability</b> mechanisms are improved.

This is exemplified in the California Delta, where critical needs such as flood control do not fall exclusively within the purview of any one entity and therefore must be addressed through coordination and collaboration at multiple scales. Yet CALFED, recent effort to produce integrated, collaborative governance in the Delta, has had mixed results. In this paper, we examine accountability within the existing governance system in the Delta. As a thought experiment we ask how accountability would function in a hypothetical governance system that incorporates principles from the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) into {{the context of the}} Delta. Network-based governance approaches such as CALFED blur the lines between public and private authority. They challenge traditional notions of vertical, top-down / down-up accountability by instead adopting a logic of accountability that is more horizontal, relationship-oriented, and diffused among multiple actors and organizations. We use the case of the Dutch Slough salt marsh restoration project in the Delta to understand the fragmented institutional landscape in which such projects are embedded, to ask how this landscape shapes the pathways of accountability in governance, and to reflect on the rise of alternative models in the European Union may offer lessons for California. The case study reveals the need for governance efforts to more effectively embed both <b>vertical</b> and horizontal <b>accountability.</b> To understand the applicability of the WFD to California, we compare the European and American social and political contexts as they relate to water.

This study aims {{to analyze}} the {{conceptualization}} of democracy by Celal Bayar and Adnan Menderes. Given the basic assumption of this dissertation, which is that ‘political agency’ is the decisive factor for the democratization path of a country, it is particularly concerned with Bayar’s and Menderes’ conceptualization of democracy. Since they were the main figures of Turkish politics between the year 1945, when the transition decision to democracy was made, and the year 1960, when the Democratic Party government was overthrown by the Turkish military, {{it is important to}} examine the understanding of democracy that shaped their political actions and decisions {{in order to understand the}} extent to which they contributed to Turkish democracy. Taking the agency approach as its theoretical background, this dissertation analyzes their political discourse and praxis based on the distinction between minimalist and maximalist democracy. While the minimalist dimension emphasizes the <b>vertical</b> <b>accountability</b> dimension of democracies and finds the presence of the electoral dimension of political regimes sufficient to define a regime as democratic, the maximalist dimension additionally considers the horizontal accountability dimension and takes the political opposition aspect as interdependent with <b>vertical</b> <b>accountability,</b> and thus as an indispensable aspect of democracies. This analysis is made using the minutes of the Turkish Grand National Assembly and group meetings of the Democratic Party, selected newspapers and periodicals of the period, speeches and articles of Bayar and Menderes, and the biographies written by their friends or journalists. In addition to the data gathered through these written sources, data collected through interviews with people that witnessed the period is also used. All data is categorized under these two main dimensions of democracy and analyzed according to the extent to which these two dimensions of democracy can be considered crucial for these two political leaders’ understanding of democracy. The analysis of the political discourse and praxis of Bayar and Menderes indicates that Bayar and Menderes accepted both vertical and horizontal dimensions of democracy. However, they did not see them as interdependent and they attached priority to the <b>vertical</b> <b>accountability</b> dimension. Thus, as they disregarded the horizontal accountability dimension, it is found that democracy came under threat and finally collapsed. Sütçü, GülizPh. D...|$|E

40|$|Kenya {{has been}} going {{through a period of}} {{political}} reform since 1991, when section 2 A of the constitution, which had made Kenya a de jure one-party state, was repealed. This reform followed a prolonged struggle on the part of citizens {{both inside and outside the}} country, and their call for democracy was one that, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, was embraced by Western countries. Via diplomatic pressure and conditionality on aid, Western donors played an important role in the repeal of section 2 A, the return of multiparty elections, and the creation and reform of a number of political institutions and offices via a separation of powers. But although these changes were supported by the political opposition and much of civil society in Kenya, they did not rise organically from the national struggle over political power. Nor did these reforms lead to a determination in the country to hold the political elite accountable for their transgressions. This article argues that modern Kenya’s history of economic and political inequality has resulted in a population whose very divisions make it difficult for politicians to be disciplined. Accountability has two dimensions: the horizontal accountability among branches of government that is assured by checks and balances, and the <b>vertical</b> <b>accountability</b> of the state to its citizens. <b>Vertical</b> <b>accountability</b> depends on a constituency of like-minded citizens defending broad national interests, or an electorate with a collective identity or set of identities attached to the Kenyan nation.

Current scholarship on accountability has identified a distinct mechanism {{through which the}} introduction of political competition may affect such institutions: the electoral connection or <b>vertical</b> <b>accountability</b> mechanism. This connection {{is not expected to}} be effective in new democracies, because political competition is found to be volatile and nonprogrammatic. Another strand of the literature focuses on the effect of power alternation. Government turnover is expected to generate incentives for the creation and strengthening of autonomous institutions. By exploring a unique data set on 33 state audit insti-tutions, the authors bring together these distinct claims and provide systematic empirical tests for them. They find a negative effect of volatility on their insti-tutional activism and a positive (direct and indirect) influence of power alterna-tion on their levels of autonomy and sanctioning patterns...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the relationship}} between checks and balances and democracy, focusing on Turkey in comparative perspective. In a large-N setting, the effects {{of checks and balances}} on the quality of democracy are examined. The findings reinforce the essential relationship between democracy and checks and balances. The article then discusses the implications of the the findings for Turkey. It stresses the need for horizontal accountability via checks and balances vested in different state agencies. In addition to state-level checks and balances, the importance of societal actors as sources of accountability is also elaborated. The study identifies the need for <b>vertical</b> <b>accountability,</b> not only through free elections but also by creating a political setting in which pluralistic media and civil society can thrive. In light of findings, the article stresses the need for a new constitutional framework that can embrace both state- and societal-level checks and balances. © 2015 Taylor & Francis...|$|E
30|$|The three {{facets of}} {{democracy}} contribute to determining what Morlino defines as “quality democracy”, namely “that stable institutional order which through correctly functioning institutions and mechanisms creates freedom and equality of citizens” (Morlino 2003 : 228). Conceived in this way, {{the quality of}} democracies may be empirically analyzed in eight analytical dimensions. Five are procedural dimensions, since they prevalently concern the rules and only indirectly the contents: rule of law, participation, competition, <b>vertical</b> <b>accountability</b> (which binds the electors to the elected) and horizontal accountability (which links, {{in a game of}} reciprocal checks and balances, the constitutional organs). To these are added two substantive dimensions, since they specifically concern the content of democratic government action: enjoyment of fundamental freedom rights (civil, political and socio-economic) and conditions of equality, on both the political plane and the socio-economic one. The last dimension is defined as an “outcome dimension”, as it concerns the political system’s capacity to respond (responsiveness) to citizens’ questions (Morlino 2011).|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} and discusses what evidence exists about initiatives to promote transparency among legislators, {{members of parliament}} (MPs), and legislative processes and what impact this has had on legislative accountability. In this report we distinguish between two types of accountability: vertical (in which citizens play a direct role in holding the powerful to account) and horizontal (in which legislators hold the executive to account). With regard to <b>vertical</b> <b>accountability,</b> the effects of three policy initiatives are reviewed: i) increased information about MPs including through ICTs; ii) disclosure of MPs’ assets; and iii) disclosure of MPs’ election expenses and funders. Compared to more recent transparency initiatives, such as registers of beneficial ownership information, these initiatives have had {{a few years to}} generate some evidence about impact. In relation to horizontal accountability, the impact of transparency on the effectiveness of Public Accounts Committees is reviewed. The choice to focus on this Committee was also {{made on the basis of}} available research...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the big welfare administration reform in Norway. The reform is a merger of the employment and national insurance administrations {{into a new}} employment and welfare administration, combined with more formal collaboration between this new administration and the local government social services administration. A central component of the reform is {{the introduction of a}} mandatory partnership between central and local government. In this paper we argue that the partnership model chosen is a hybrid of hierarchy and network. A substantial dilemma in the partnership is how to enhance <b>vertical</b> <b>accountability</b> and control within the welfare state administration {{at the same time as}} sustaining the autonomy of local government in this policy area. The partnership model created to solve this dilemma represents a delicate and ambiguous balance, a balance first between accountability to the central government and the local council and than between sectorial and territorial specialization. The balance has yet to be tried out in practice...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this article}} are to map and describe the formal accountability relationships of Foundation Trusts (FTs) and to probe the interpretations of these relationships by the key actors. The research methods included documentary analysis and interviews with Chief Executives, Chairs, Directors and Governors in six Acute Trusts and two Strategic Health Authorities. It was found that athough <b>vertical</b> <b>accountability</b> to DH (via SHAs) has, in formal terms, been removed, some FTs continue {{to be held accountable}} by SHAs (albeit informally). Directors of FTs perceive strong accountable to Monitor, particularly for financial performance, but there is some confusion about where accountability for quality of care rests. Horizontal lines of accountability to the local population through LINks and OSCs remain weak. Contrary to the major policy {{objectives of}} giving greater autonomy to FTs and making them more accountable to the local population, FTs continue to look up rather than down. The accountability of FTs needs to be simplified, clarified and strengthened. ...|$|E
