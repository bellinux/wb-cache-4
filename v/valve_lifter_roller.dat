5000|$|All K {{series are}} non-crossflow engines - the inlet and exhaust {{manifolds}} {{are on the}} same side. They have cast iron blocks and aluminium alloy heads, with a crankshaft supported by five main bearings. K series motors have both hydraulic tappet or hydraulic <b>valve</b> <b>lifters,</b> solid lifters and 1.5 ratio rockers with an adjustment thread for tappet clearance. 7k engines were released with only the hydraulic <b>valve</b> <b>lifters</b> from factory, whereas 4k and 5k engines were made with both hydraulic and solid lifters (depending on year and which model vehicle.) ...|$|R
50|$|From 1954 to 1963, the {{high-pressure}} 235 engine with mechanical <b>valve</b> <b>lifters</b> {{was used}} in some trucks. From 1956 to 1962, all 235 engines used in cars had hydraulic lifters.|$|R

50|$|Hydraulic tappets {{require more}} complex and more {{expensive}} cylinder head design. A number of subcompact car manufacturers prefer solid <b>valve</b> <b>lifters</b> due to lower design and production cost rather than hydraulic tappets.|$|R
25|$|The {{diaphragm}} is {{a flexible}} cover to the medium (intermediate) pressure chamber. When the diver consumes {{gas from the}} second stage, the pressure falls in the medium pressure chamber and the diaphragm deforms inwards pushing against the <b>valve</b> <b>lifter.</b> This opens the high pressure valve permitting gas to flow past the valve seat into the medium-pressure chamber. When the diver stops inhaling, pressure in the medium pressure chambers rises and the diaphragm returns to its neutral flat position and no longer presses on the <b>valve</b> <b>lifter</b> shutting off the flow until the next breath is taken.|$|R
5000|$|Compared {{with the}} M40, the M42 {{features}} a DOHC valvetrain, a timing chain, hydraulic <b>valve</b> <b>lifters</b> {{and an increased}} 10:1 compression ratio. Later versions of the M42 also feature a dual length intake manifold (called [...] "DISA").|$|R
50|$|The initial {{engine was}} the Ford 170 CID L straight-6, {{modified}} with solid <b>valve</b> <b>lifters,</b> a 6 USqt L oil pan, heavy-duty fuel pump, oil-bath air cleaner, and a carburetor with a float bowl compensated against tilting.|$|R
50|$|The 6-cylinder engine {{crankshaft}} {{had seven}} main bearings (five in four-cylinders) and the generous (if not redundant) {{size of its}} inner moving parts attributed to its durability and exceptional smoothness. The hydraulic <b>valve</b> <b>lifters</b> made for easy maintenance.|$|R
25|$|The Rebel's engine also {{differed}} from the 327s installed in the 1957 Ambassador and Hudson Hornet models because it used mechanical <b>valve</b> <b>lifters</b> and a higher compression ratio. Since both engines were rated at 255hp, {{it is probable that}} the Rebel's was underrated.|$|R
5000|$|All G-engines used solid <b>valve</b> <b>lifters</b> {{through the}} 1980 model year, with the {{exception}} of a small production test of hydraulic lifters in the 1978 model year. For model year 1981, all North American G-engines received top-fed hydraulic lifters. Retrofitment in both directions is possible.|$|R
50|$|A {{hydraulic}} <b>valve</b> <b>lifter,</b> {{also known}} as a hydraulic tappet or a hydraulic lash adjuster, is a device for maintaining zero valve clearance in an internal combustion engine. Conventional solid <b>valve</b> <b>lifters</b> require regular adjusting to maintain a small clearance between the valve and its rocker or cam follower. This space prevents the parts from binding as they expand with the engine's heat, but can also lead to noisy operation and increased wear as the parts rattle against one another until they reach operating temperature. The hydraulic lifter was designed to compensate for this small tolerance, allowing the valve train to operate with zero clearance—leading to quieter operation, longer engine life, and eliminating the need for periodic adjustment of valve clearance.|$|R
50|$|A single {{timing belt}} drives the {{intake and exhaust}} camshaft. The cam {{journals}} are supported on five points between the <b>valve</b> <b>lifters</b> of each cylinder and {{on the front of}} the cylinder head, and are lubricated by an oiler port located in the middle of the camshaft.|$|R
50|$|A direct-injection turbo version (101 bhp) {{with four}} valves per cylinder, called the DiTD was {{introduced}} in the June 1998 Mazda 626 Wagon 2.0 DiTD. Engine has SOHC valve train with rocker arms and mechanically adjusted screws (no hydraulic <b>valve</b> <b>lifters),</b> with Denso V5 rotary injection pump and Denso PCM.|$|R
50|$|The LU3 also {{received}} a quiet cam to help reduce vibration at both idle and high engine speeds. This camshaft used the same lift and duration as the older design, but the cam was reprofiled to keep the <b>valve</b> <b>lifters</b> in full contact with the cam lobes as the cam ramps down.|$|R

It was offered without a reduction system. Starting is electric starter only.|$|R
50|$|The new 1KR-VE engine now {{features}} variable-valve timing {{with intelligence}} (VVT-i) on the intake valves. Several minor changes and refinements were also introduced for increased fuel efficiency and more linear power delivery. Notable changes include a higher 11.5:1 compression ratio, a high-tumble intake port, a longer intake manifold, micro fuel spray injection and low-friction <b>valve</b> <b>lifters.</b>|$|R
50|$|Vauxhall now {{appeared}} to have a serious rival for the Volkswagen Golf at just about every level. The car featured a new unified engine for Vauxhall/Opel, featuring an all-aluminium head, overhead camshaft and hydraulic <b>valve</b> <b>lifters,</b> and it quickly became popular with buyers. A 1200 cc version which used the older Opel OHV engine was also available.|$|R

5000|$|A 322 cuin L [...] "monobloc" [...] {{engine was}} used in 1936's Series 60. It was {{designed}} to be the company's next-generation powerplant at reduced cost from the 353 and Cadillac V12. The monobloc's cylinders and crankcase were cast as a single unit, [...] and it used hydraulic <b>valve</b> <b>lifters</b> for durability. This design allowed the creation of the mid-priced Series 60 line.|$|R
5000|$|In 1984, Saab added a 16 valve {{cylinder}} head with double overhead camshafts. They retroactively renamed the 8-valve version the B201 and used B202 {{as the name}} of the new multi-valve unit. Another notable addition to the B202 was hydraulic <b>valve</b> <b>lifters</b> and Ecopower ("ep" [...] in Italy, [...] "(900)S" [...] elsewhere), with a pre-heated catalytic converter for reduced emissions.|$|R

50|$|All {{versions}} {{feature a}} {{grey cast iron}} block and an aluminum head with a single or double overhead chain driven camshafts. SOHC engines use two valves per cylinder and DOHC versions use four valves per cylinder with a pentroof chamber, the valve angle being 22 degrees from vertical. All engines use flat inverted bucket type <b>valve</b> <b>lifters,</b> hydraulic {{in the case of}} DOHC engines.|$|R
50|$|The Powerplus had twist grips on both handles; the {{throttle}} {{was controlled by}} the left twist grip while the right twist grip advanced or retarded the spark. Three controls were {{on the right side}} of the gas tank, a vertically-operated shifter, an exhaust <b>valve</b> <b>lifter,</b> and a hand clutch lever. The clutch lever was linked to the clutch pedal positioned on the left side of the bike.|$|R
50|$|Minor {{changes were}} made to the unit during its production, {{including}} an uprated oil pump around mid-1997, with the addition of larger oilways in the head machining (T-Vents), and modified <b>valve</b> <b>lifters</b> to reduce top-end valve noise, at which point the cam belt arrangement also changed with the lower idler moving. Around 1998, the spin-on metal canister oil filter was changed to a disposable paper element.|$|R
50|$|The AMC 327 {{is similar}} to the 287, but {{displaces}} 327 CID L due to the bore increase to 4.0 in.

50|$|In 1923, at age 21, Sunnen {{applied for}} his first of nearly 100 patents, a <b>valve</b> <b>lifter</b> tool, marking the {{beginnings}} of Sunnen Company. However that same year he was nearly killed in a work explosion which burnt most of his body, and spent a year recovering. He returned to his brother's garage for employment and while in Mexico, Missouri, met and married Miss Cornelia Miller.https://web.archive.org/web/20110718203122/http://www.ja.org/nested/stlouis/Sunnen.pdf They moved to St. Louis to pursue Sunnen's manufacturing ambitions in 1924. There Sunnen converted a 1916 Hupmobile into a camper and {{set out on the}} road to sell 500 of his new <b>valve</b> <b>lifter</b> tools. They sold two or three tools a day until they reached Mankato, Minnesota where a large distributor of shop tools bought his remaining stock and placed an order for 1,000 additional tools. Following the trip Sunnen returned home to build his manufacturing business around the auto engine rebuilding trade.https://web.archive.org/web/20070927025751/http://www.manufacturingcenter.com/metlfax/archives/0701/0701lct.asp The Sunnen Company grew to become a renowned global manufacturer of precision honing devices, and holds a position of global prominence to this day.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{left off}} of NASCAR's schedule, {{the race was}} added late in the season. Richard Petty led the most laps but fell out late and {{finished}} 15th. Bobby Allison took the win in Roger Penske's AMC Matador but was fined $9,100 for unapproved <b>valve</b> <b>lifters</b> in postrace inspection. The race lead changed 38 times officially (a track record for stock cars) while several laps saw up to four lead changes in one circuit.|$|R
50|$|In 2011, a {{class action}} lawsuit was filed in United States District Court in New Jersey against Daimler AG, Mercedes-Benz, Mercedes-AMG for alleged defects in the M156 engine {{contained}} in AMG vehicles built in 2007-2011 model years leading to premature wear. The plaintiff claimed the combination of cast nodular iron camshafts and 9310 grade steel <b>valve</b> <b>lifters</b> contributed to the premature wear, but the defendants had known about the defect since 2007.|$|R
50|$|Valve {{clearance}} {{refers to}} the small gap between a <b>valve</b> <b>lifter</b> and a <b>valve</b> stem that ensures that the valve completely closes. On engines with mechanical valve adjustment, excessive clearance causes noise from the valve train. A too small valve clearance can result in the valves not closing properly, {{this results in a}} loss of performance and possibly overheating of exhaust valves. Typically, the clearance must be readjusted each 20000 mi with a feeler gauge.|$|R
