5|$|The {{highlight}} of the Nobel Prize Award Ceremony in Stockholm occurs when each Nobel laureate steps forward to receive the prize {{from the hands of}} the King of Sweden. In Oslo, the Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee presents the Nobel Peace Prize {{in the presence of the}} King of Norway. At first, King Oscar II did not approve of awarding grand prizes to foreigners. It is said that his mind changed once his attention had been drawn to the publicity <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prizes</b> for Sweden.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} period (1518–1587), the beylerbeys were admirals of the sultan, {{commanding}} great fleets and conducting war operations for political ends. They were slave-hunters and their methods were ferocious. After 1587, the sole object of their successors became plunder, on land and sea. The maritime operations were conducted by the captains, or reises, who formed a class or even a corporation. Cruisers were fitted out by investors and commanded by the reises. Ten percent of the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prizes</b> was paid to the pasha or his successors, who bore the titles of agha or dey or bey.|$|E
25|$|There she was {{refitted}} {{and transformed}} into a brig. She went on a second campaign from September 1805 to January 1806. Caroline captured the ships Waldegrave and Commerce in the Indian Ocean, and Melville and Prince de Galles in the Gulf of Bengal, teaming up with Perroud's Bellone and Henry's Henriette. Surcouf appears to have left Caroline after this voyage. When Caroline was paid off, her 117 officers and crew men shared a payment of 46,566.42 piasteres, divided into 241 shares, representing one-third of the net <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prizes</b> she had taken. Nicholas Surcouf had 12 shares, Lacaze Ranly, her second captain, had 10 shares. The least was a half-share, which was the lot of the cabin boys {{and a couple of}} the officers' servants. Each seaman had from three-quarters of a share to 1½ shares.|$|E
40|$|We analyze equilibria of two-player {{contests}} where {{players have}} intention-based preferences. We find that players invest more effort {{compared to the}} case with selfish preferences and are even willing to exert effort when <b>the</b> monetary <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prize</b> converges to zero. As a consequence, overdissipation occurs if <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prize</b> is sufficiently small...|$|R
50|$|In an all-pay auction, the Nash {{equilibrium}} is {{such that}} each bidder plays a mixed strategy and their expected pay-off is zero. The seller's expected revenue is equal to <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prize.</b> However, some economic experiments have shown that over-bidding is common. That is, the seller's revenue frequently exceeds that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prize,</b> and in repeated games even bidders that win <b>the</b> <b>prize</b> frequently will most likely take a loss in the long run.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{competitive bidding}} via sealed tenders {{for the case}} in which the bidders have different sources and amounts of information available about <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prize.</b> <b>The</b> equilibrium pure strategies are characterized and computational methods are derived.

500|$|Saumarez's {{convoy of}} prizes stopped first at Malta, where Saumarez {{provided}} assistance to a [...] rebellion {{on the island}} among the Maltese population. It then sailed to Gibraltar, arriving on 18 October to the cheers of the garrison. Saumarez wrote that, [...] "We can never {{do justice to the}} warmth of their applause, and the praises they all bestowed on our squadron." [...] On 23 October, following the transfer of the wounded to the military hospital and provision of basic supplies, the convoy sailed on towards Lisbon, leaving Bellerophon and Majestic behind for more extensive repairs. Peuple Souverain also remained at Gibraltar: The ship was deemed too badly damaged for the Atlantic voyage to Britain and so was converted to a guardship under the name of HMS Guerrier. The remaining prizes underwent basic repairs and then sailed for Britain, spending some months at the Tagus and joining with the annual merchant convoy from Portugal in June 1799 under the escort of a squadron commanded by Admiral Sir Alan Gardner, before eventually arriving at Plymouth. Their age and battered state meant that neither Conquérant nor Aquilon were considered fit for active service in the Royal Navy and both were subsequently hulked, although they had been bought into the service for £20,000 (the equivalent of £ as of [...] ) each as HMS Conquerant and HMS Aboukir to provide a financial reward to the crews that had captured them. Similar sums were also paid out for Guerrier, Mercure, Heureux and Peuple Souverain, while the other captured ships were worth considerably more. Constructed of Adriatic oak, Tonnant had been [...] built in 1792 and Franklin and Spartiate were less than a year old. Tonnant and Spartiate, both of which later fought at the Battle of Trafalgar, joined the Royal Navy under their old names while Franklin, considered to be [...] "the finest two-decked ship in the world", was renamed HMS Canopus. The total <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prizes</b> captured at the Nile and subsequently bought into the Royal Navy was estimated at just over £130,000 (the equivalent of £ as of [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|Although the English {{probably}} first {{experimented with}} raffles and similar games of chance, the first recorded official lottery was chartered by Queen Elizabeth I, {{in the year}} 1566, and was drawn in 1569. This lottery was designed {{to raise money for}} the [...] "reparation of the havens and strength of the Realme, and towardes such other publique good workes". Each ticket holder won a prize, and the total <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prizes</b> equalled the money raised. Prizes were in the form of silver plate and other valuable commodities. The lottery was promoted by scrolls posted throughout the country showing sketches of the prizes.|$|E

2500|$|After {{revaluation}} and {{the introduction}} of the new franc, many French people continued to use old francs (anciens francs), to describe large sums (throughout the 1980s and well in to the 1990s and virtually until the introduction of the euro, many people, old and young [...] even those who had never used the old franc [...] were still referring to the old franc, confusing people). For example, lottery prizes were most often advertised in amounts of centimes, equivalent to the old franc, basically to inflate the perceived <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prizes</b> at stake. Multiples of 10NF were occasionally referred to as [...] "mille francs" [...] (thousand francs) or [...] "mille balles" [...] ("balle" [...] being a slang word for franc) in contexts where {{it was clear that the}} speaker did not mean 1,000 new francs.|$|E
60|$|When Cyaxares {{reached the}} frontiers, he concluded, instead of contenting {{himself and his}} party with hunting wild beasts, to make an {{incursion}} for plunder into the Assyrian territory, that being, as Zenophon expresses it, a more noble enterprise than the other. The nobleness, it seems, consisted in the greater imminence of the danger, in having to contend with armed men instead of ferocious brutes, and in the higher <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prizes</b> which they would obtain in case of success. The idea of there being any injustice or wrong in this wanton and unprovoked aggression upon the territories of a neighboring nation {{seems not to have}} entered the mind either of the royal robber himself or of his historian.|$|E
60|$|Terence smiled vaguely, {{as if he}} {{understood}} that the captain was pleased with them, but did not otherwise catch his meaning. They arrived at Brest without further adventure. As they neared the port, the captain asked Terence if he and his companion would enter upon the books of the privateer and after much difficulty made, as he believed, Terence understand his question. The latter affected to consult Ryan, and then answered {{that they would be}} both willing to do so. The captain then put the names they gave him down on the ship's roll, and handed each of them a paper, certifying that Juan Montes and Sebastian Peral belonged to the crew of the Belle Jeanne, naming the rate of wages that they were to receive, and their share in the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prizes</b> taken. He then gave them eighty francs each, as an advance on their pay from the date of their coming on board, and signified to them that they must buy clothes similar to those worn by the crew, instead of the heavy fishermen's garments they had on.|$|E

6000|$|Three of the frigates, whose {{presence}} {{would have been}} so essential a few weeks sooner, joined the squadron on the twelfth day after the action. The fourth joined a few days after them. Nelson thus received despatches, which rendered it necessary for him to return to Naples. Before he left Egypt he burned three of the prizes; they could not have been fitted for a passage to Gibraltar in less than a month, and that at a great expense, and with the loss of the services of at least two sail of the line. [...] "I rest assured," [...] he said to the Admiralty, [...] "that they will be paid for, and have held out that assurance to the squadron. For if an admiral, after a victory, is to look after the captured ships, and not to the distressing of the enemy, very dearly, indeed, must the nation pay for the prizes. I trust that L60,000 will be deemed a very moderate sum for them: and when the services, time, and men, with the expense of fitting the three ships for a voyage to England, are considered, government will save nearly as much as they are valued at. Paying for prizes," [...] he continued, [...] "is no new idea of mine, and would often prove an amazing saving to the state, even without taking into calculation what the nation loses by the attention of admirals to the property of the captors; an attention absolutely necessary, as a recompence for the exertions of the officers and men. An admiral may be amply rewarded by his own feelings, and by the approbation of his superiors; but what reward have the inferior officers and men but the <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prizes?</b> If an admiral takes that from them, on any consideration, he cannot expect to be well supported." [...] To Earl St. Vincent he said, [...] "If he could have been sure that government would have paid a reasonable value for them, he would have ordered two of the other prizes to be burnt, for they would cost more in refitting, and by the loss of ships attending them, than they were worth." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper reconsiders Tullock's {{analysis}} of rent seeking and wasteful overdissipation. <b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> {{this paper is}} to point out that even though his original {{analysis of}} overdissipation is technically flawed, <b>the</b> definition <b>of</b> overdissipation can be modified to explain instances in which rational rent-seekers spend more to win a <b>prize</b> than <b>the</b> <b>prize</b> is worth. We showed before that equilibrium mixed strategies in the Tullock game do not permit overdissipation in expectation: the expected total amount spent competing for rents cannot exceed <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prize.</b> However, since <b>the</b> equilibrium involves mixed-strategies for particular realizations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mixed strategies the total amount spent competing for rents can exceed <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>prize!</b> In fact, we show that <b>the</b> cross-sectional incidence <b>of</b> overdissipation may be quite high. For a symmetric perfectly discriminating contest (R = &inf;), <b>the</b> probability <b>of</b> overdissipation in a symmetric equilibrium ranges from exactly one-half in the two player case to approximately. 44 as <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> players approaches infinity...|$|R
