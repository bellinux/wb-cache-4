40|$|The {{design of}} {{effective}} glyphs for visualisation involves {{a number of}} different visual encodings. Since spatial position is usually already specified in advance, we must rely on other <b>visual</b> <b>channels</b> to convey additional relationships for multivariate analysis. One such relationship is the apparent order present in the data. This paper presents two crowdsourcing empirical studies that focus on the perceptual evaluation of orderability for <b>visual</b> <b>channels,</b> namely Bertin’s retinal variables. The first study investigates the perception of order in a sequence of elements encoded with different <b>visual</b> <b>channels.</b> We found evidence that certain <b>visual</b> <b>channels</b> are perceived as more ordered (for example, value) while others are perceived as less ordered (for example, hue) than the measured order present in the data. As a result, certain <b>visual</b> <b>channels</b> are more/less sensitive to disorder. The second study evaluates how visual orderability affects min and max judgements of elements in the sequence. We found that <b>visual</b> <b>channels</b> that tend to be perceived as ordered, improve the accuracy of identifying these value...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In this chapter, we {{consider}} the need in multi-field visualization to depict information contained in two or more fields in a compositional manner. There are many different <b>visual</b> <b>channels,</b> {{some of which are}} more commonly seen in visualization than others. Channel fusion occurs when two or more visual entities have to share the same screen space. By applying appropriate constructive operations on <b>visual</b> <b>channels</b> in the composition, one may encode the integration as well as separation of the underlying information depicted by the original channels. One special situation is where multiple fields are a set of fields from different temporal steps, which imposes additional constraints on the use of <b>visual</b> <b>channels.</b> It is inevitable that the availability of <b>visual</b> <b>channels</b> {{will not be able to}} scale up to a large number of <b>visual</b> <b>channels.</b> Hence {{we consider}} briefly several general-purpose data mapping methods that can be used to reduce the complexity of visual mapping. ...|$|R
40|$|As an {{extension}} of the singular value decomposition based ap-proaches, a novel metric based on Tucker decomposition for color image quality assessment is proposed in this paper. It extracts both the spacial and chromatic information of a color image with Tucker decomposition. As compared to most of the other existing quality metrics for color images, the key ad-vantage of the proposed metric is that it treats the color image as a whole entity instead of an assembly of three independent <b>visual</b> <b>channels,</b> and thus the interrelation among the different <b>visual</b> <b>channels</b> is well involved. Experimental results on the LIVE Database Release 2 demonstrate that the proposed met-ric can generally achieve similar or better performance than other metrics.

50|$|The {{auditory}} channel {{deals with}} {{information that is}} heard, and the <b>visual</b> <b>channel</b> processes information that is seen. The <b>visual</b> <b>channel</b> holds less information than the auditory channel. If both the visual and auditory channels are presented with information, more knowledge is retained. However, if too much information is delivered it is inadequately processed, and long term memory is not acquired. Multimedia learning seeks to give instructors the ability to stimulate both the visual and auditory channels of the learner, resulting in better progress.|$|E

40|$|Glyph-based {{visualization}} {{can offer}} elegant and concise presentation of multivariate information while enhancing speed and ease in visual search experienced by users. As with icon designs, glyphs are usually created {{based on the}} designers’ experience and intuition, often in a spontaneous manner. Such a process does not scale well {{with the requirements of}} applications where a large number of concepts are to be encoded using glyphs. To alleviate such limitations, we propose a new systematic process for glyph design by exploring the parallel between the hierarchy of concept categorization and the ordering of discriminative capacity of <b>visual</b> <b>channels.</b> We examine the feasibility of this approach in an application where there is a pressing need for an efficient and effective means to visualize workflows of biological experiments. By processing thousands of workflow records in a public archive of biological experiments, we demonstrate that a cost-effective glyph design can be obtained by following a process of formulating a taxonomy with the aid of computation, identifying <b>visual</b> <b>channels</b> hierarchically, and defining application-specific abstraction and metaphors...|$|R
40|$|The {{apparent}} {{contrast of}} a texture is reduced {{when it is}} surrounded by another texture with high contrast. This contrast-contrast illusion has been {{thought to be a}} result of spatial interactions between <b>visual</b> <b>channels</b> that encode contrast energy. In the present study, we show that the contrast-contrast is selective to the luminance polarity by using texture patterns composed of sparse elongated blobs. The apparent contrast of a texture of bright (dark) elements was substantially reduced only when it was surrounded by a texture of elements with the same polarity. This polarity specificity was not found for textures of dense elements, which was similar to those used in previous studies, probably because such stimuli should inevitably activate both on- and off-type sensors. The polarity selective suppression decreased as the difference in orientation between the centre and surround elements increased, but still remained as for orthogonally-oriented elements. These results suggest that the contrast-contrast illusion largely depends on spatial interactions between <b>visual</b> <b>channels</b> that are selective to the luminance polarity and partially to the orientation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractGratings appear {{of higher}} spatial {{frequency}} {{when they are}} viewed peripherally rather than foveally. To test the hypothesis that this effect is an artefact of particular laboratory conditions, we manipulated the contrast, luminance and presentation duration, manipulations which have {{also been shown to}} increase the apparent spatial frequency of foveally presented gratings. It has been argued that such shifts reflect an attempt to increase sensitivity by changing the receptive field properties of spatially tuned <b>visual</b> <b>channels,</b> while keeping their size labels constant. If so, and peripheral channels are not otherwise mislabelled, {{it should be possible to}} find conditions under which the apparent spatial frequency of peripherally viewed gratings matches that of foveal gratings of the same spatial frequency. In this study, manipulations of contrast, luminance, and duration had no effect on the size of the perceived spatial frequency shift in peripheral vision. Thus the putative inappropriate size labelling of peripheral <b>visual</b> <b>channels</b> is constant over a wide range of stimulus values. We speculate that this apparent constant error may result from a mechanism which normally compensates for another factor such as blur, which may otherwise lead to an overestimation of size...|$|R

3000|$|Given the {{presented}} comprehensive literature review, it {{has been}} observed that developments of NR methods that consider visual attention are rather limited, especially, in the case of videos. As noted in[199], visual attention models can be integrated into existing NR methods to make them more robust. Generally, the advantage of including visual attention-based modeling appears to be larger for methods designed for video quality assessment than for image quality assessment methods. Visual attention becomes more significant in scenarios of audio-visual stimuli, as it is required to account for the cues from <b>visual</b> <b>channels</b> as well as auditory channels.|$|R

Nowadays, there are many interesting applications which communicate via the short-rang wireless communication channel (such as Bluetooth or WiFi).

In order to build a secure authentication mechanism, protocols are proposed using human control <b>visual</b> <b>channels.</b> However, this method brings many challenges, the main one being the burden placed on humans. Therefore, in this thesis, these protocols are optimized using visible light communication techniques, which significantly reduce the work faced by humans...|$|R
40|$|Photo {{aesthetic}} quality evaluation {{is a fundamental}} yet under addressed task in computer vision and image processing fields. Conventional approaches are frustrated by the following two drawbacks. First, both the local and global spatial arrangements of image regions {{play an important role}} in photo aesthetics. However, existing rules, e. g., visual balance, heuristically define which spatial distribution among the salient regions of a photo is aesthetically pleasing. Second, it is difficult to adjust visual cues from multiple channels automatically in photo aesthetics assessment. To solve these problems, we propose a new photo aesthetics evaluation framework, focusing on learning the image descriptors that characterize local and global structural aesthetics from multiple <b>visual</b> <b>channels.</b> In particular, to describe the spatial structure of the image local regions, we construct graphlets small-sized connected graphs by connecting spatially adjacent atomic regions. Since spatially adjacent graphlets distribute closely in their feature space, we project them onto a manifold and subsequently propose an embedding algorithm. The embedding algorithm encodes the photo global spatial layout into graphlets. Simultaneously, the importance of graphlets from multiple <b>visual</b> <b>channels</b> are dynamically adjusted. Finally, these post-embedding graphlets are integrated for photo aesthetics evaluation using a probabilistic model. Experimental results show that: 1) the visualized graphlets explicitly capture the aesthetically arranged atomic regions; 2) the proposed approach generalizes and improves four prominent aesthetic rules; and 3) our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in photo aesthetics prediction...|$|R

The chosen features all allow a real- or near real-time processing and can therefore not only be applied to offline browsing, but also for a remote meeting assistant. ...|$|R
