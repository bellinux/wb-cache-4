25|$|A flow bench {{consists}} of an air pump of some sort, a metering element, pressure and temperature measuring instruments such as manometers, and various controls. The test piece is attached in series with the pump and measuring element and air is pumped through the whole system. Therefore, all the air passing through the metering element also passes through the test piece. Because the <b>volume</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> through the metering element is known and the flow through the test piece is the same, it is also known. The mass flow rate can be calculated using the known pressure and temperature data to calculate air densities, and multiplying by the <b>volume</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{refrigeration}} system's {{coefficient of}} performance (CoP) {{is very important in}} determining a system's overall efficiency. It is defined as refrigeration capacity in kW divided by the energy input in kW. While CoP is a very simple measure of performance, it is typically not used for industrial refrigeration in North America. Owners and manufacturers of these systems typically use performance factor (PF). A system's PF is defined as a system's energy input in horsepower divided by its refrigeration capacity in TR. Both CoP and PF can be applied to either the entire system or to system components. For example, an individual compressor can be rated by comparing the energy needed to run the compressor versus the expected refrigeration capacity based on inlet <b>volume</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rate.</b> It {{is important to note that}} both CoP and PF for a refrigeration system are only defined at specific operating conditions, including temperatures and thermal loads. Moving away from the specified operating conditions can dramatically change a system's performance.|$|E

Although these flow values {{are thought to be}} effected by anatomic variations in the circle of Willis, few reports have described the effect. This study reports on the relationship between variations in the circle of Willis and <b>volume</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> in the bilateral internal carotid and basilar arteries of normal volunteers. METHODS: We prospectively examined 125 healthy volunteers by MR imaging. Variations in the circle of Willis were classified as “textbook ” type, hypoplasia of the precommunicating segment of the anterior cerebral artery (A 1), hypoplasia of the precommunicating segment of the posterior cerebral artery (P 1), or “other. ” <b>Volume</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> were measured by 2 D cine phase-contrast MR imaging.

RESULTS: Of the 117 subjects (61 men, 56 women; mean age, 23. 6 years) considered suitable for flow measurement, 105 showed textbook type, and 6 each showed A 1 hypoplasia and P 1 hypoplasia.

Herein, a hydrodynamic electrochemical method is explored {{for use as a}} continuous method to produce H 2 O 2 at the point-of-use.

Mass transfer measurements were performed at different temperatures and <b>flow</b> <b>rates.</b> The residual content of THF in the eluate was quantified with high precision (< 0. 1 %) via density measurements.

The latex parameters used for evaluation were initial <b>volume,</b> initial <b>flow</b> <b>rate,</b> final <b>volume</b> and plugging index with tree dryness {{as the dependent}} factor. Estimates of direct and indirect effects {{of each of the}} latex parameters on tree dryness were calculated through linear correlation and path analysis. The correlation coefficient between initial <b>volume</b> and initial <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> was 1. 00 and both characters had the same correlation coefficients with other latex parameters and tree dryness. This implies that initial <b>volume</b> and initial <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> are alternatives for evaluation of correlation between latex parameters and tree dryness.
