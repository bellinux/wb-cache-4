50|$|Frequent and {{thorough}} <b>vacuuming</b> is also helpful. The vacuum {{must be used}} around everything the animal frequents, to pick up all the larvae and eggs. Traditional advice recommends disposing of the bag after each <b>vacuuming.</b> One very limited experiment (only one vacuum sweeper used on a single type of carpeted surface) found that <b>vacuuming</b> killed 96% of adult fleas and 100% of younger fleas. This preliminary study's applicability to other circumstances is unclear.|$|R
500|$|For {{staple fiber}} production, {{there are a}} number of ways to {{manufacture}} the fiber. [...] The glass can be blown or blasted with heat or steam after exiting the formation machine. [...] Usually these fibers are made into some sort of mat. [...] The most common process used is the rotary process. [...] Here, the glass enters a rotating spinner, and due to centrifugal force is thrown out horizontally. [...] The air jets push it down vertically, and binder is applied. [...] Then the mat is <b>vacuumed</b> to a screen and the binder is cured in the oven.|$|E
500|$|The tour's set, {{described}} at {{the time}} as [...] "the largest touring set ever," [...] was designed to look like a giant spider. It was 60 feet (18.3m) high, 64 feet (19.5m) wide and included giant <b>vacuumed</b> tube legs that were lit from the inside with 20,000' (6,096m) of color-changing lights. A single set took 43 trucks to move and was estimated to weigh 360 tons. 16' x 20' (4.9m x 6m) video screens displayed video and images from the show to those in the audience who were further away from the stage. The system required to run the show included two separate sound systems, 260 speaker cabinets, 1,000 lights (with an output total of 600,000 watts) and three computers. Mark Ravitz, the set designer, had previously designed Bowie's 1974 Diamond Dogs Tour set.|$|E
2500|$|The {{conditions}} required for display of textiles are largely {{those that have}} already been discussed in the Storage and Environment sections.

[...] Textiles should be <b>vacuumed</b> before and after display.|$|E
40|$|Deoxidation {{of steel}} with carbon under reduced {{pressure}} {{is often used}} for increasing the steel purity. Suitable units for this purpose in foundries are vacuum induction furnaces. Possibilities of increasing the steel purity by deoxidation with carbon in the vacuum induction furnace were studied for the steel for the petrochemistry of specific composition 25 Cr/ 35 Ni. The charge composed of the return material only was melted in the air. During melting the charge oxidized and the oxidizing slag formed. Chemical composition of steel, morphology, chemical composition of inclusions in the steel and chemical composition of slag after <b>vacuuming</b> were studied {{on the basis of}} samples taken before and after <b>vacuuming.</b> Temperature and oxygen activity were measured before and after <b>vacuuming.</b> Globular inclusions with dominant content of silicon and manganese were observed in steel before and after <b>vacuuming.</b> Contents of total oxygen in steel didn’t change significantly during <b>vacuuming.</b> On the basis of composition of inclusions and measured oxygen activity the activity of Cr 2 O 3 in inclusions was calculated. A slag sample was taken after <b>vacuuming</b> and equilibrium oxygen activity in steel with regard to the Cr 2 O 3 content in the slag was estimated from the slag composition. Equilibrium oxygen activity in relation to the Cr 2 O 3 content in the slag was higher than equilibrium activity measured in the steel. For this reason it is not possible, under the studied conditions, to decrease oxygen content in steel during <b>vacuuming...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Once {{the best}} {{cleaning}} {{process has been}} determined, the piece should be prepared for washing. [...] Usually, this involves vacuuming to remove any surface dirt. [...] Linings and backing should also be removed, <b>vacuumed,</b> and washed separately. [...] This {{is not only to}} prevent colour bleeding, but to avoid trapping dirt between the layers, which may cause discolouration from the inside. [...] Additionally, different fibres react to cleaning in different ways, and fabrics may shrink or stretch, which, if they are still attached together, may cause rippling and distortion in the lining and outer layer of the textile.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the safest}} and easiest ways to clean {{textiles}} is to vacuum them. [...] The fabric is placed on a clean, flat work surface. [...] If the specimen is particularly delicate, or simply as a precaution, a fibreglass screen edged with twill tape may be placed over the textile. [...] The screen allows dirt and dust to pass through, but prevents individual threads from being pulled loose or unravelled further by the suction. [...] Using a vacuum attachment and the lowest power setting, move the suction over the screen until the entire area has been cleaned. [...] If needed, move the screen to a new area and begin again. [...] Always remember to vacuum {{both sides of the}} textile, as dirt may filter through to the other side. [...] Hanging textiles will need to be <b>vacuumed</b> less often than horizontal pieces, as there are fewer places where dust can collect.|$|E

40|$|Temporal {{databases}} {{facilitate the}} support of historical information by providing functions for indicating the intervals during which a tuple was applicable (along one or more temporal dimensions). Because data are never deleted, only superceded, temporal databases are inherently append-only resulting, over time, in a large historical sequence of database states. Data <b>vacuuming</b> in temporal databases allows for this sequence to be shortened by strategically, and irrevocably, deleting obsolete data. Schema versioning allows users to maintain a history of database schemata without compromising the semantics of the data {{or the ability to}} view data through historical schemata. While the techniques required for data <b>vacuuming</b> in temporal databases have been relatively well covered, the associated area of <b>vacuuming</b> schemata has received less attention. This paper discusses this issue and proposes a mechanism that fits well with existing methods for data <b>vacuuming</b> and schema versioning...|$|R

2500|$|In 2015, Italian {{researchers}} published [...] a {{new study}} in Scientific Reports. They examined the human and non-human DNA found when the shroud and its backing cloth were <b>vacuumed</b> in 1977 and 1988. They found traces of 19 different plant taxa, including plants native to Mediterranean countries, Central Europe, North Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Asia (China) and the Americas. Of the human mtDNA, sequences were found belonging to haplogroups that are typical of various ethnicities and geographic regions, including Europe, North and East Africa, the Middle East and India. A few non-plant and non-human sequences were also detected, including various birds and one ascribable to a marine worm common in the Northern Pacific Ocean, next to Canada. After sequencing some DNA of pollen and dust found on the shroud, they confirmed that many people from many different places {{came in contact with}} the shroud. According to the scientists, [...] "such diversity does not exclude a Medieval origin in Europe but it would be also compatible with the historic path followed by the Turin Shroud during its presumed journey from the Near East.

2500|$|The fully wool cloth {{is usually}} green, with a {{directional}} nap {{running from the}} baulk {{end of the table}} towards the end with the black ball spot. The cloth is often called [...] "baize"; however baize is a much inferior type of cloth sometimes used on pool tables. The nap will affect the direction of the cue ball depending on which direction the cue ball is shot and also on whether left or right side (spin) is placed on the ball. Even if the cue ball is hit in exactly the same way, the nap will cause a different effect depending on whether the ball is hit down table (towards the black ball spot) or up table towards the baulk line. The cloth on a snooker table is not <b>vacuumed,</b> as this can destroy the nap. The cloth is brushed in a straight line from the baulk end to the far end with multiple brush strokes that are straight in direction (i.e. not across the table). Some table men will also then drag a dampened cloth wrapped around a short piece of board (like a two by four), or straight back of a brush to collect any remaining fine dust and help lay the nap down. The table is then ironed. Strachan cloth as used in official snooker tournaments is made up of 100% wool. Some other cloths include a small percentage of nylon.|$|E
