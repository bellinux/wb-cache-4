In {{this paper}} a 6 -DOF(Degree of Freedom) {{vibration}} isolation platform with structural configuration of 3 CPS (3 Cylindrical-Prismatic-Spherical) - 1 UPS (1 Universal-Prismatic-Spherical) parallel mechanism is proposed. Firstly, the dynamic model is developed through virtual work principle. The transfer function and the complex {{frequency response function}} {{were obtained from the}} dynamical equation. Then, 36 amplitude frequency diagrams are obtained from the frequency response function. By analyzing the 36 amplitude frequency diagrams, 10 <b>vibration</b> <b>coupling</b> terms were chosen. The range of the spring stiffness coefficient and the range of the damping coefficient of the magneto-rheological damper are determined by analyzing the acceleration transmissibility of the 10 <b>vibration</b> <b>coupling</b> terms. At last, an integrated optimization combining structural and controller optimization is developed. The optimal parameters of the parallel mechanism are obtained through Genetic Algorithm (GA). This work is significant for the prototype design and verification of the vibration isolator...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical and {{experimental study of}} the in-plane and out-of-plane coupling of a matched piezoelectric sensor/actuator pair bonded on a beam. Both the sensor and actuator are triangularly shaped polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) transducers and are intended to provide a compact sensor/actuator system for beam vibration control. The measured sensor-actuator frequency response function has shown an unpredicted increase in magnitude with frequency, which was found, {{to be due to}} in-plane <b>vibration</b> <b>coupling.</b> An analytical model has been developed to decompose the sensor-actuator response function into an in-plane contribution and an out-of-plane contribution. This in-plane coupling can limit the feedback control gains when a direct velocity feedback control is applied. A method called the jωs compensation method is proposed to identify the effect of the in-plane <b>vibration</b> <b>coupling</b> at low frequencies. Even after this compensation, however, there was unexpected strong out-of-plane coupling at even modes, which may have been caused by a lack of accuracy in the shaping of the PVDF sensor and actuator. Numerical simulations have confirmed the sensitivity of the matched sensor/actuator pair with shaping errors...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{model for}} the coupled lateral and {{torsional}} vibrations of a vertical unbalanced rotor is developed. The equation of motion is obtained using Lagrangian dynamics without considering the external actuating forces and torque. The equation showed coupling and nonlinear interaction between the rotor lateral and torsional vibrations. Most of the earlier work on <b>coupled</b> <b>vibrations</b> has been done for the horizontal rotor model. The <b>coupled</b> <b>vibrations</b> for a vertical rotor have not {{been reported in the}} past. An attempt is made to reveal dynamic characteristics of vertical rotor. The results of the simulation showed the coupled between torsional and lateral vibrations is induced by mass eccentricity. <b>Coupled</b> <b>vibrations</b> have appeared in the start period of the vibration. After a transient vibration process, the <b>vibrations</b> are not <b>coupling.</b> The lateral <b>vibration</b> becomes equal amplitude with shafting speed. And the torsional vibration keeps on attenuating until it stops. When the <b>vibration</b> is <b>coupled,</b> the coupling effect on which torsional vibration to lateral vibration is evident. But there’s no coupling effect on the lateral to the torsional. It is also shown that for some operational parameters, the controlling action may excite large lateral <b>vibrations</b> due to <b>coupling</b> with the torsional motion. ...|$|R

40|$|Doped {{metal oxides}} are {{plasmonic}} materials that boast both synthetic and postsynthetic spectral tunability. They have already enabled promising smart window and optoelectronic technologies {{and have been}} proposed for use in surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRA) and sensing applications. Herein, we report {{the first step toward}} realization of the former utilizing cubic F and Sn codoped In 2 O 3 nanocrystals (NCs) to couple to the C–H vibration of surface-bound oleate ligands. Electron energy loss spectroscopy is used to map the strong near-field enhancement around these NCs that enables localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) coupling between adjacent nanocrystals and LSPR-molecular <b>vibration</b> <b>coupling.</b> Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy measurements and finite element simulations are applied to observe and explain the nature of the coupling phenomena, specifically addressing coupling in mesoscale assembled films. The Fano line shape signatures of LSPR-coupled molecular vibrations are rationalized with two-port temporal coupled mode theory. With this combined theoretical and experimental approach, we describe the influence of coupling strength and relative detuning between the molecular vibration and LSPR on the enhancement factor and further explain the basis of the observed Fano line shape by deconvoluting the combined response of the LSPR and molecular vibration in transmission, absorption and reflection. This study therefore illustrates various factors involved in determining the LSPR–LSPR and LSPR–molecular <b>vibration</b> <b>coupling</b> for metal oxide materials and provides a fundamental basis for the design of sensing or SEIRA substrates...|$|E
