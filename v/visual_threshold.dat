This means that each composition originates from a serial process transversing the painting and which the painting is only a detail of. And the famous disturbing Freudian strangeness emanating from each work has no other motive but this situation where we are facing {{the framework of a}} process unfolding outside all dimension. If, therefore, the ordinate accumulation of details in a painting which itself is but a detail serves first as a purely visual provocation, viewed again, Joubert-Cordiers paintings accomplish an original, exotic, and unexpected synthesis of modern tradition especially. Pointillism, surrealism, all-over expressionism, all the principles of the great movements of the century are convoked, collected, in order to draw out the image of a digital labyrinth. Because, here, vision {{seems to me to be}} but an inductive threshold, [...] "aperitif" [...] if I may say so, of a sensorial space very rarely utilized in the history of painting, that of the Touch. This so rare sensation is discernable in the complementarity of the formal characteristic of the works and of the Story of these same works. This great proliferating vegetation screened framed in a series of sites, and details therefore of an infinite process, is first of all the product of a proliferation of marks, touches, streaks. And the eye convoked in Joubert-Cordiers paintings as the synthetic sum of marks, in identifying the sumptuous microcellular carpet, identifies at the same time the procedural passage of the repetition of touches, rather than of the painted, the brushed. From which follows, considering these paintings and their disturbing strangeness: that it is not so much the visual aspect of this flora which inspires strangeness; the coherent and masterly application of touches; the quality of the tones, the organic unit of the ensemble, on the contrary, confers upon these works a great visual savour. But beyond the global <b>visual</b> <b>threshold,</b> I well believe that it is the spectators hand which is, through these paintings, grabbed, the unconscious hand seized by the delicate touch of these great digital surfaces. It is not the eye here that is in danger, but through the recourse to vision, it is the body that is aimed at, the hand first, on this score of teeth, these stringy mosses, these carnivorous flowers, this vegetal cancer. This painting sees itself on the scale of the forbidden it forces on touch, and by extension, on the body.

40|$|Banding {{is one of}} {{the image}} {{artifacts}} for electrophotographic (EP) printers. Due to its origin within the EP process, it can also be viewed as an intrinsic signature of the specific printer. Modulating the EP process to generate banding signals that are below the human <b>visual</b> <b>threshold</b> but can be detected by effective detection approach can further extend the signature capacity. This deliberate banding signal can be viewed as extrinsic signature of a printer. Since modulating the printing process provides significant barrier of entry, it is effective in limiting the attack possibilities and can be an effective method to embed needed information regarding the document and the device it was printed on to provide unprecedented forensic information. One of the key issues with embedding extrinsic signature is the information should not be detectable by the human observer. However, the signature needs to be detectable by a suitable detection algorithm. In this paper, we will propose one method to modulate the exposure of the EP process to embed controlled quasi-periodic signature into a document. Based on the system level modeling and experimental verification of the EP process, machine detectable signatures that are below the human <b>visual</b> <b>threshold</b> can be embedded into a printed document without any perceivable degradation in image quality.

40|$|An image {{watermark}} parameter optimization {{procedure is}} proposed for selecting {{the most effective}} DCT coefficients for watermark embedding. Using this set of coefficients improves the watermark robustness and reliability against attack while it maintains the transparency of the embedded watermark. With the aid of prior knowledge of attacks, the visual masking effect and the attack distortion on each (DCT) transform coefficient are pre-calculated so that a maximum strength watermark within <b>visual</b> <b>threshold</b> can be inserted. There are two stages in the design phase. First, {{taking into account the}} combined effect of watermark embedding and attack, we pick up the robust coefficients that resist a specific type of attacks and in the meanwhile we keep the distortion lower than the <b>visual</b> <b>threshold.</b> Although typically the watermark detection reliability increases with the increasing number of embedded coefficients, the less effective coefficients may degrade the overall detection performance. Thus, in the second stage, some initially selected coefficients are discarded by an iterative process to reduce the overall error detection probability. Since digital images are often compressed for efficient storage and transmission, we adopt JPEG compression as the attacking source. The simulation results show that the detection error probability is significantly reduced when the selected robust coefficients are in use. These coefficients with watermark embedded on them can also survive color reduction, Gaussian filtering, and frequency mode Laplacian removal (FMLR) attacks...|$|E
