5|$|Due to A. rubrums {{very wide}} range, there is {{significant}} variation in hardiness, size, form, time of flushing, onset of dormancy, and other traits. Generally speaking, individuals from the north flush the earliest, have the most reddish fall color, set their buds the earliest and take the least winter injury. Seedlings are tallest in the north-central and east-central part of the range. In Florida, at the extreme south of the red maple's range, it is limited exclusively to swamplands. The fruits also vary geographically with northern individuals in areas with brief, frost-free periods producing fruits that are shorter and heavier than their southern counterparts. As {{a result of the}} variation there is much genetic potential for breeding programs with a goal of producing red maples for cultivation. This is especially useful for making urban cultivars that require resistance from <b>verticillium</b> <b>wilt,</b> air pollution, and drought.|$|E

40|$|Tomato {{production}} characteristics In Morocco, early tomato {{for export}} is grown mainly under plastic cover (tunnels and greenhouses). There has been, {{with the introduction}} of this new production system, a revolution in the greenhouse production technology: Greenhouse type, quality of the plastic cover, ferti-irrigation, plastic mulch, new high yielding cultivars, specific pesticides, soil fumigation particularly with Methyl Bromide etc…However, the intensification of the protected crops production has created new optimal conditions for the development of many pests. Soil-borne diseases problems were relatively simple in the early years, but they increased in importance as intensive cultivation continued. Soil fumigation with Methyl bromide to control soil borne fungi and root knot nematodes is considered as one of the main factors for the production success in greenhouses. Tomato is grown from July to may (10 months) and most of the production is exported. Main tomato soil borne pathogens Tomato is attacked by many soil-borne pathogens such as Fusarium (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici, race 1 and race 2) and <b>Verticillium</b> <b>wilts</b> (<b>Verticillium</b> dahliae, races 1 and 2), Clavibacter michiganense (bacterial canker), Pseudomonas syringae p. v tomato (bacterial speck), Orobanche (Orobanche ramosa), root knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.). However, the key soil-borne pathogens are Fusarium, Verticillium and root knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.). These pathogens are used to be controlled by Methyl Bromide (98 % Methyl Bromide and 2 % Chloropicrin). At the moment, tomato represents about 58 % of the total area fumigated by this chemical.

40|$|Verticillium dahliae and V. alfalfae (formerly Verticillium albo-atrum) are two {{important}} agricultural pathogens that affect many crops {{around the world}} and cause a distinct type of vascular wilt, which are known as <b>Verticillium</b> <b>wilts.</b> Several V. alfalfae and V. dahliae genomes have been sequenced, and are among the smaller genomes from filamentous ascomycetes. The number of predicted protein-encoding genes is similar to the saprobe Neurospora crassa. Perhaps reflective of their particular hemibiotrophic life styles, some gene families are expanded in the V. alfalfae and V. dahliae genomes. These include the gene families encoding glycoside hydrolases GH 88, necrosis and ethylene-inducing-like proteins (NLPs), LysM effectors, proteins with chitin-recognition motifs, and cutinases. But the number of predicted secreted proteins was less than half that of the related Colletotrichum species, the agents of anthracnose diseases. V. dahliae strains generally contain lineage-specific regions (LS regions), which may {{play an important role in}} virulence and pathogenicity. Examples for horizontal transfer into Verticillium ancestors include the virulence factor Ave 1, a glucan glucosyltransferase, and potentially some of the retrotransposons.

30|$|To have {{a deeper}} {{understand}} functions of microRNA, we subjected the identified target genes to gene ontology (GO) analysis ([URL] {{a method for}} identifying relevant miRNA–gene regulatory networks based on biological processes and molecular functions (Ashburner & Bergman 2005). KEGG is the major public pathway-related database (Elliott et al. 2008) {{and it was also}} used to estimate the potential functions of predicted target gene candidates of the novel miRNAs. Analysis of regulatory networks and biochemical pathways help understand the biological functions of the miRNA targets. Some miRNA families had multiple target genes, which were usually different function with homologous sequences. For these target genes, binding sites of the putative miRNA were often located in the highly conserved regions. It is notable that two miRNAs, ghr-miR 8156 - 3 p and ghr-miR 8170 - 3 p, potentially target disease resistance genes such as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 17, Nbs-lrr resistance protein, and plant viral-response family proteins. These targets include genes involved in plant–pathogen interactions, endocytosis, terpenoid backbone biosynthesis, isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis, primary bile acid biosynthesis, the MAPK signalling pathway, and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites.

40|$|The {{vascular}} <b>wilt</b> fungi <b>Verticillium</b> dahliae and V. albo-atrum infect over 200 plant species, causing {{billions of}} dollars in annual crop losses. The characteristic wilt symptoms are a result of colonization and proliferation of the pathogens in the xylem vessels, which undergo fluctuations in osmolarity. To gain insights into the mechanisms that confer the organisms 2 ̆ 7 pathogenicity and enable them to proliferate in the unique ecological niche of the plant vascular system, we sequenced the genomes of V. dahliae and V. albo-atrum and compared them to each other, and to the genome of Fusarium oxysporum, another fungal wilt pathogen. Our analyses identified a set of proteins that are shared among all three wilt pathogens, and present in few other fungal species. One of these is a homolog of a bacterial glucosyltransferase that synthesizes virulence-related osmoregulated periplasmic glucans in bacteria. Pathogenicity tests of the corresponding V. dahliae glucosyltransferase gene deletion mutants indicate that the gene is required for full virulence in the Australian tobacco species Nicotiana benthamiana. Compared to other fungi, the two sequenced Verticillium genomes encode more pectin-degrading enzymes and other carbohydrate-active enzymes, suggesting an extraordinary capacity to degrade plant pectin barricades. The high level of synteny between the two Verticillium assemblies highlighted four flexible genomic islands in V. dahliae that are enriched for transposable elements, and contain duplicated genes and genes that are important in signaling/transcriptional regulation and iron/lipid metabolism. Coupled with an enhanced capacity to degrade plant materials, these genomic islands may contribute to the expanded genetic diversity and virulence of V. dahliae, the primary causal agent of <b>Verticillium</b> <b>wilts.</b> Significantly, our study reveals insights into the genetic mechanisms of niche adaptation of fungal wilt pathogens, advances our understanding of the evolution and development of their pathogenesis, and sheds light on potential avenues for the development of novel disease management strategies to combat destructive wilt diseases...|$|R
40|$|The {{effective}} management of <b>Verticillium</b> <b>wilts</b> (VW), diseases affecting many crops and caused by some {{species of the}} soil-borne fungus Verticillium, is problematic. The use of microbial antagonists to control these pathologies fits modern sustainable agriculture criteria. Pseudomonas fluorescens PICF 7 is an endophytic bacterium isolated from olive roots with demonstrated ability to control VW of olive caused by the highly virulent, defoliating (D) pathotype of Verticillium dahliae Kleb. However, {{the study of the}} PICF 7 -V. dahliae-olive tripartite interaction poses difficulties because of the inherent characteristics of woody, long-living plants. To overcome these problems we explored the use of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Results obtained in this study showed that: (i) olive D and non-defoliating V. dahliae pathotypes produce differential disease severity in A. thaliana plants; (ii) strain PICF 7 is able to colonize and persist in the A. thaliana rhizosphere but is not endophytic in Arabidopsis; and (iii) strain PICF 7 controls VW in Arabidopsis. Additionally, as previously observed in olive, neither swimming motility nor siderophore production by PICF 7 are required for VW control in A. thaliana, whilst cysteine auxotrophy decreased the effectiveness of PICF 7. Moreover, when applied to the roots PICF 7 controlled Botrytis cinerea infection in the leaves of Arabidopsis, suggesting that this strain is able to induce systemic resistance. A. thaliana is therefore a suitable alternative to olive bioassays to unravel biocontrol traits involved in biological control of V. dahliae by P. fluorescens PICF 7.

40|$|The European Commission {{requested}} the EFSA Panel on Plant Health {{to perform a}} pest categorisation of Verticillium albo-atrum Reinke and Berthold, the causal agent of <b>Verticillium</b> <b>wilts.</b> V. albo-atrum causes wilt and plant death, impairing the growth and shortening the lifespan of its hosts. V. albo-atrum was recently split into three species, V. albo-atrum sensu stricto, V. alfalfae and V. nonalfalfae, for which reliable detection and identification methods exist. V. albo-atrum sensu lato is present {{in most parts of}} the EU. The new taxonomic status of the pathogen, and the confusion that existed in the past between V. albo-atrum sensu lato and V. dahliae, cause uncertainty on its distribution worldwide and in the EU. Based on recent studies, the presence of each of the new species (V. albo-atrum sensu stricto, V. alfalfae, V. nonalfalfae) has so far been confirmed in a relatively small part of the EU. The pathogen has a wide host range. In the EU, it affects many cultivated and non-cultivated plant species, including some very important crops (alfalfa, cotton, hop, potato and tomato). However, the so far known host range of each of the above-mentioned new species is more restricted than that of V. albo-atrum sensu lato. There are no obvious ecoclimatic factors limiting the potential establishment and spread of the pathogen in the non-infested part of the EU where hosts are present. Once established, the pathogen can spread by natural and human-assisted means. Movement of infected host plants for planting, especially asymptomatic plants, can introduce the pathogen into new areas. Integrated management strategies may reduce impacts of V. albo-atrum sensu lato in the EU, but they do not eliminate the pathogen.
