2500|$|For the US market, two limited {{production}} GTV-6 models stand out. The Balocco (named {{after the}} famous Balocco test track in Italy) appeared in 1982 with a production run of only 350 cars. The Balocco was {{available only in}} red with sunroof and black interior, leather-wrapped steering wheel and red piping on the seats. There were also two green Quadrifoglio badges fixed on the rear quarter trim pieces above a badge with the [...] "Balocco SE" [...] designation. A plaque inset in the glove box door designated {{the number of the}} car out of the series of 350 (XXX of 350). Later there was the GTV6 2.5 Maratona, of which only 150 were built. The Maratona model included a more aggressive aerodynamic trim package, lightweight Speedline wheels, clear engine <b>view</b> <b>port,</b> sunroof, wood steering wheel and shift knob, rear louvers and Carello fog lamps. All 150 cars were available only painted silver and with a black leather interior; and came with [...] "Maratona" [...] badging on the rear decklid, front fenders and glove box door. (The most notable feature of the Maratona, its aerodynamic kit, was also available as a dealer-installed option on other GTV-6 models.) ...|$|E

While horizontal scrolling is expected to present {{the illusion of a}} <b>view</b> <b>port</b> moving left and right across a wide panoramic scene made of screen memory, ANTIC's automatic memory scan increment conflicts with this idea that the rows of screen data is wider than the display. Presenting screen memory as long horizontal lines requires an LMS modifier for every Display List Text or Map Mode instruction in the scrolling region. A horizontal step is accomplished by incrementing or decrementing all the LMS addresses of the scrolling region.|$|E

40|$|NASA {{plans to}} use a number of onboard <b>viewing</b> <b>ports</b> to measure lunar {{regolith}} in situ and to monitor robotic and human activities on the lunar or Martian surface. Because of the size and abundance of dust particles on these bodies, the potential for dust to occlude <b>viewing</b> <b>ports</b> and windows is high enough to threaten system lifetime and reliability, especially when activities rely on relaying video to either a habitat module or controllers on Earth. This project uses a technology being developed by KSC's Electrostatics and Surface Physics Laboratory to remove dust from windowlike surfaces. The technology applies an alternating electric potential to interlaced electrodes. In this application, we use indium tin oxide (ITO) to create various electrode patterns {{in order to determine}} the most reliable pattern for dust removal. This technology has application to systems where optical clarity is important. Specifically, this project considers the in situ resource utilization (ISRU) application of a <b>viewing</b> <b>port</b> for Raman spectroscopy, where the electrode pattern on glass would be coated with a scratch-resistant sapphire film (Al 2 O 3) ...|$|R

50|$|Before video {{displays}} became a common {{part of the}} user interface many computers used a teletype—a printer usually with continuously-fed paper. User input and the computer generated output were printed on the paper fed through the printer. This widely understood interface for user input and computer output continued {{with the introduction of}} {{video displays}} as computers presented a metaphor of the screen as a <b>view</b> <b>port</b> over an imagined, infinite roll of paper. Information is displayed on screen beginning at the top until it reaches {{the bottom of the screen}} and when the computer needs to introduce new information it shifts all the screen information up providing an empty space at the bottom for the new information and consequently erasing the topmost information.|$|E
5000|$|Vertical coarse {{scrolling}} is {{the easiest}} feature to exercise. The first Text or Map Mode instruction in every Display List always includes the LMS instruction modifier specifying the start of screen memory. As it generates the display, ANTIC automatically increments its memory scan pointer from Mode line to Mode line to display memory contiguously. Therefore, a display can be [...] "moved" [...] by merely updating the initial LMS modifier's address; adding the number of bytes used for {{a line in the}} current Text or Map Mode shifts the screen contents up one line while subtracting the same amount moves the screen down. So, the display is actually a <b>view</b> <b>port</b> that is moved to look at a different areas of memory rather than moving the memory into a fixed screen map.|$|E
50|$|All viewports of Sea Pole class bathyscaphe have a {{circular}} truncated cone shape.

The two additional smaller side viewports of 12 cm diameter are mounted on portside and starboard side, closer to the front than other bathyscaphes. The advantage of this arrangement is that it enables navigation while both the pilot and the scientists simultaneouslyobserve an objective in front of the vehicle. However, the side views have limited field of vision. There are two onboard life supporting system based on that of Shenzhou 6 spacecraft, and additionally, there are two onboard oxygen generating systems independent of life supporting system for additional safety.

5000|$|The {{flight of}} Yuri Gagarin on April 12, 1961 was humanity's maiden spaceflight. While {{the mission was}} a {{necessary}} first step, Gagarin {{was more or less}} confined to a chair with a small <b>view</b> <b>port</b> from which to observe the cosmos - {{a far cry from the}} possibilities of life in space. Following space missions gradually improved living conditions and quality of life in low Earth orbit. Expanding room for movement, physical exercise regimens, sanitation facilities, improved food quality, and recreational activities all accompanied longer mission durations. Architectural involvement in space was realized in 1968 when a group of architects and industrial designers led by Raymond Loewy, over objections from engineers, prevailed in convincing NASA to include an observation window in the Skylab orbital laboratory. [...] This milestone represents the introduction of the human psychological dimension to spacecraft design. Space architecture was born.|$|E
5000|$|Uzbl's design {{focuses on}} {{keyboard}} control and hot keys, although it also supports mouse and other pointing device input. Like the pentadactyl and vimperator [...] Firefox extensions, Uzbl employs a mode-based interface {{derived from the}} vi and Vim text editors. Rather than move the cursor to an address bar or a link, a user presses a hotkey to switch to [...] "command" [...] mode. From this mode the user may: select links in the <b>view</b> <b>port</b> through assigned keys (0 through 9 by default) or through typing an unambiguous string of the link text; navigate to another web page by typing its URL; modify settings; and perform other normal web-browsing tasks. While this mode-based interface creates an initially steep learning curve, once learned it typically allows a user greater speed and convenience than many other browsers. Uzbl allows configuration of the hot keys used.|$|E
