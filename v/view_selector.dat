It includes installation of a new system and upgrade and expansion of existing functionality with new data. The system is based on Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition (hereafter OBIEE) 11 g. Existing system was developed using OBIEE 10 g which encompassed information from more business functions of a given company. The existing system was expanded with reports of planned and actual data of business functions. The reformed system also provides insight {{into the details of}} individual projects and information on their performance, long-term and short-expected results, an overview of income and expenditure, and their deviation from the planned values. Reports are dynamic and interactive. Various building blocks were used and their combinations thereof: table, pivot table, graph, filter, prompt, master-detail linking, column selector, <b>view</b> <b>selector</b> and others. Reports were compiled with these building blocks and then they were logically allocated on the control panel...|$|E

40|$|Density level {{sets are}} mainly {{estimated}} {{using one of}} three methodologies: plug-in, excess mass, or a hybrid approach. The plug-in methods are based on replacing the unknown density by some nonparametric estimator, usually the kernel. Thus, the bandwidth selection is a fundamental problem from a practical point of <b>view.</b> Recently, specific <b>selectors</b> for level sets have been proposed. However, if some a priori information about the geometry of the level set is available, then excess mass algorithms can be useful. In this case, a density estimator is not necessary, {{and the problem of}} bandwidth selection can be avoided. The third methodology is a hybrid of the others. As in the excess mass method, it assumes a mild geometric restriction on the level set and, like the plug-in approach, requires a pilot nonparametric estimator of the density. One interesting open question concerns the practical performance of these methods. In this work, existing methods are reviewed, and two new hybrid algorithms are proposed. Their practical behaviour is compared through extensive simulations...|$|R
40|$|The study {{endeavored}} to analyze recruitment and selection process of primary teachers {{in view of}} Quality Management (QM) in AJ&K. The study involved triangulation method by using analysis of policy documents and collection of quantitative data through survey instrument from primary teachers and their selectors. Study was delimited to primary teachers of high schools and their selectors in all public sector ten school districts of AJ&K. Major objectives of study were to analyze existing selection process, find criteria of recruitment, subject knowledge competencies, professional knowledge competencies, personality traits, prior experience of teaching and various selection methods for primary teachers. Relationship of existing and proposed recruitment and selection was also determined with Quality Management. Sample of study comprised 122 selectors and 850 primary teachers of {{both male and female}} categories. Data was collected both by postages and personal visits of respective high schools. Eight parameters of Quality Management (PQM) were determined for this study which were analysis of existing system, finding recruitment criteria, recruitment process, selection process, subject knowledge competencies,, professional knowledge competencies, personality traits and prior experience of teaching. Data was analyzed through SPSS by using Kruskal Wallis H-test and Mann Whitney U-test to meet the objectives. Findings revealed that there were diversed <b>views</b> of <b>selectors</b> and teachers for existing as well as future selection. There was a significant correlation among all PQM except existing selection with future recruitment and personality traits. All PQM has a strong correlation with one another. Future recommendations were proposed as to establish a separate human resource department or delegation of power to National Testing Service (NTS) or Public Service Commission (PSC), de-politicization of complete system, extinction of all types of biases, 21 - 25 years age, Bachelors educational qualification, B. Ed professional qualification, minimum 1 - 3 years of teaching experience, 25 years retiring age and training and monitoring of already selected primary teachers. A framework of Quality Management for recruitment and selection in future and a model of selection were also proposed on the basis of study...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper offers}} a {{predictive}} approach for {{the selection of}} a fixed number (= t) of treatments from k treatments with the goal of controlling for predictive losses. For the ith treatment, independent observations X(ij) (j = 1, 2, [...] ., n) can be observed where X(ij) 's are normally distributed N(theta(i);sigma 2). The ranked values of theta(i) 's and X(i) BAR's are theta(1) less-than-or-equal-to [...] . less-than-or-equal-to theta((k)) and X[1]BAR less-than-or-equal-to [...] . less-than-or-equal-to X[k]BAR and the selected subset S = {[k], [k - 1], [...] ., [k - t + 1]) will be considered. This paper distinguishes between two types of loss functions. A type I loss function associated with a selected subset S is the loss in utility from the <b>selector's</b> <b>view</b> point and is a function of theta(i) with i is-an-element-of S. A type II loss function associated with S measures the unfairness in the selection from candidates' viewpoint and is a function of theta(i) with i is-an-element-of S. This paper shows that under mild assumptions on the loss functions S is optimal and provides the necessary formulae for choosing n so that the two types of loss can be controlled individually or simultaneously with a high probability. Predictive bounds for the losses are provided. Numerical examples support the usefulness of the predictive approach over the design of experiment approach...|$|R
40|$|Biochemical {{processes}} in living organisms {{rely on a}} plethora of molecular reactions and interactions involving chiral molecules, and these processes often show different responses to the enantiomers of exogenous or endogenous chemicals. The interaction of enantiomeric drugs with a target receptor is a paradigmatic example of chirality effects on general biological action and {{is directly related to}} the formation of a drug-receptor supramolecular complex. In particular the drug-receptor model can be used to explore the relation of chirality to at least three important issues encountered in supramolecular chemistry: complementarity, preorganization, and (enantio) selectivity. A detailed understanding of those factors governing enantioselectivity of biological receptors is facilitated by the study at molecular level of model systems with simplified structures that are amenable to physico-chemical investigations. Liquid chromatography on chiral stationary phases offers the opportunity to study enantioselective interactions between surface immobilized chiral <b>selectors,</b> <b>viewed</b> as minimalist mimics of macromolecular receptors, and a large set of chiral guests, under a variety of experimental conditions. Indeed, for a significant number of systems, close agreement has been found between retention data gathered by chromatography and association constants measured by spectroscopy in free solution. Chiral supramolecular selectors featuring highly preorganized, medium-sized macrocyclic structures are attractive in this context because they often afford high levels of enantioselectivity and yet have relatively low molecular complexity, thus facilitating the understanding of operative enantioselective recognition mechanisms from easily collected chromatographic data. In the present chapter we first illustrate the general principles of supramolecular chemistry and their integration into the design of liquid chromatographic systems, with particular focus on enantioselective variants based on chiral macrocyclic selectors of natural or synthetic origin. In the second part we discuss the elaboration of enantioselective recognition models from chromatographic data and how these models can be extended to and studied with non-chromatographic systems (free solution by nuclear magnetic resonance, gas phase by mass spectrometry) ...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to uncover what went into the provision of books of fiction to schools; to examine the construction of readers by book selectors; to find out how children saw themselves as readers and what their own feelings were about reading; and to speculate {{on the extent to which}} policies are changing or can be changed. In order to do this I have looked at the situation in two schools with very different histories in the Western Cape. I have tried to establish what the conditions were that created their situation. Through speaking to various book selectors and to children to discover their responses to books, I have gathered material to comment on their perceptions. The schools were chosen as representative of two systems. The children are readers who speak for themselves and, to a certain extent, for their schoolmates. A basic assumption of this work is that both texts and readers are socially constructed. A second assumption, drawing on Wolfgang Iser, is that both texts and readers are active in the reading process. I am, therefore, interested in the "two basic thrusts" in recent research into children's literature identified by Joel Taxel (1989 : 32). The first is textual and assumes that meaning is determined by the text itself; the second is reader focused. Taxel contends that they can both be accommodated within a sociological perspective, as "literature constitutes an important source of children's knowledge about and orientation to the social world" (1989 : 33). Another influence on this work is what Charles Sarland has written about young people's reading in terms of culture and response. He has built on the research of Donald Fry, and recorded the voices of children responding to the voices of authors in order to understand the social meaning of what they say. In trying to set a frame within which to study the reading behaviour of children, I have drawn on Margaret Meek's work dealing with children's reading and the meaning of literacy. Ultimately, this thesis is a comment on and an analysis of the state of affairs at two schools at a time when the educational system is in a state of flux. It is an attempt to examine the dominant <b>views</b> of book <b>selectors</b> and to discuss them in relation to those of the children for whom they choose books...|$|R
40|$|Educational {{transitions}} in the UK {{are related to}} social background characteristics such as social class and, to a lesser extent, ethnicity and gender. This thesis presents {{a case study of}} admission to the University of Oxford to understand why, conditional on application, admissions patterns into selective higher eduction in Britain show an advantage for already privileged strata of society. Specifically, net of attainment, the professional middle class, white, male and state school applicants fare particularly well in securing offers for undergraduate study at Oxford. With the exception of the state school effect, the admissions privilege advantages already privileged strata of society. In the first empirical section, the analysis of purposefully generated survey data on 1, 929 applicants for admission to the University of Oxford finds that quantifiable measures of merit fail to fully explain differential admissions patterns. The logistic regression models also uncover that while applicants from the private sector initially have similar gross chances of gaining an offer to their state school educated peers, they actually face a penalty in the selection process when taking into account their higher levels of prior academic attainment. Furthermore, the analysis shows that while measures of cultural capital, motivation, aspiration and learning style are meaningfully related to selection decisions, they do not explain the lower transition rates for ethnic minority applicants, those from non-professional class backgrounds, female applicants and private school applicants. The second step in the empirical investigations then aims to understand the generative mechanisms behind these findings {{from the perspective of the}} decision makers in the selection process. This section draws on interviews with 25 admissions tutors and the observation of eight admissions meetings. The analysis here finds that <b>selectors</b> <b>view</b> the admissions exercise as involving risks and uncertainties. Also, many participating tutors routinely considered schooling in their selection decisions and discounted the performance of applicants who had come from very high achieving schools but who were not top achievers within this peer group. The mechanism of homo-social reproduction in decisions involving uncertainty is then put forward as a possible explanation for the unequal transition patterns. Finally, the third empirical analysis section investigates links between degree performance in final university examinations and admissions relevant factors. This section includes the degree performance of Oxford students as well as those who subsequently embarked on their degree course at universities other than Oxford. The most striking finding is that among the Oxford graduates, female and private school students are less likely to achieve first class degrees than their male and state school educated peers. One interpretation of this finding is that the discounting that selectors apply in the admissions process for these applicants is not only justified but may not even go far enough. But it is also possible, in particular with regard to the female effect, that the Oxford study environment or the examination system, or both are more conducive to male achievements. This thesis contributes to sociological theory by showing that existing models of educational transition have paid insufficient attention to the role of gatekeepers and their individual preferences in generating aggregate selection patterns. Incorporating selectors as actors in transition models increases our understanding of unequal access to educational institutions and the challenges faced in striving towards equal opportunities in an education based meritocracy. The findings presented here have implications for other fields of sociological inquiry that need to account for the role of individual decision makers such as labour market research. The work presented here has implications for policy making regarding selection processes within the University of Oxford and British higher education more generally. It could also aid university systems such as Germany, that are moving towards selective admission, to think about the challenges of designing truly equitable selection processes.
