5|$|In a fatal attack, however, it manifests very quickly. In {{a number}} of cases, death has {{occurred}} within 24 hours of {{the onset of the}} infection, while other cases do not last longer than around five days. The <b>virus</b> <b>attacks</b> endothelial cells, rupturing capillaries and causing blood loss and haemorrhaging; once this reaches the heart, the haemorrhage kills quickly through shock. Symptoms include lethargy and an unwillingness to eat, a rapid heartbeat, and decreased blood-cell count, as well as cyanosis of the tongue, mouth ulcers, and oedema of the head and trunk.|$|E
25|$|Plantar warts are benign {{epithelial}} tumors generally {{caused by}} infection by human papilloma virus types 1, 2, 4, 60, or 63, but {{have also been}} caused by types 57, 65, 66, and 156. These types are classified as clinical (visible symptoms). The <b>virus</b> <b>attacks</b> compromised skin through direct contact, entering through possibly tiny cuts and abrasions in the stratum corneum (outermost layer of skin). After infection, warts may not become visible for several weeks or months. Because {{of pressure on the}} sole of the foot or finger, the wart is pushed inward and a layer of hard skin may form over the wart. A plantar wart can be painful if left untreated.|$|E

The <b>virus</b> <b>attacks</b> {{the heart muscle}} and the puppy often dies suddenly or after {{a brief period of}} breathing difficulty due to pulmonary edema. On the microscopic level, there are many points of necrosis of the heart muscle that are associated with mononuclear cellular infiltration. The formation of excess fibrous tissue (fibrosis) is often evident in surviving dogs. Myofibers are the site of viral replication within cells. The disease {{may or may not be}} accompanied with the signs and symptoms of the intestinal form. However, this form is now rarely seen due to widespread vaccination of breeding dogs.|$|E

2500|$|Dogs become {{infected}} through oral contact with CPV2 in feces, infected soil, or fomites that carry the virus. Following ingestion, the virus replicates in the lymphoid {{tissue in the}} throat, and then spreads to the bloodstream. From there, the <b>virus</b> <b>attacks</b> rapidly dividing cells, notably those in the lymph nodes, intestinal crypts, and the bone marrow. There is depletion of lymphocytes in lymph nodes and necrosis and destruction of the intestinal crypts. Anaerobic bacteria that normally reside in the intestines can then cross into the bloodstream, {{a process known as}} translocation, with [...] bacteremia leading to sepsis. The most common bacteria involved in severe cases are Clostridium, Campylobacter and Salmonella species. This can lead to a syndrome known as systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). SIRS leads to a range of complications such as hypercoagulability of the blood, endotoxaemia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Bacterial myocarditis has also been reported secondarily to sepsis. Dogs with CPV are at risk of intussusception, a condition where part of the intestine prolapses into another part. Three to four days following infection, the virus is shed in the feces for up to three weeks, and the dog may remain an asymptomatic carrier and shed the virus periodically. The virus is usually more deadly if the host is concurrently infested with worms or other intestinal parasites.|$|E

40|$|Computer viruses pose a {{real threat}} to {{businesses}} {{in terms of their}} potential for wreaking havoc with one of a company's most valuable resources, its information. The responses of firms to this threat have varied widely from doing almost nothing to greatly enhancing their computer security measures. Most people view the probability of a computer <b>virus</b> <b>attack</b> as very low; however, many also recognize that the risk is very high. This study explores how managers make decisions regarding how to protect the company's information resource from a computer <b>virus</b> <b>attack.</b> A behavioral model of decision making is presented and tested through an empirical study of managers. Four major findings include (1) awareness of the computer virus problem in general is most influenced by experience with a computer <b>virus</b> <b>attack</b> (either in one's company or in a friend's firm) and by attendance at a conference concerning computer viruses; (2) awareness of protective options varies according to position of the individual within the firm; (3) awareness of curative measures that have been implemented within the firm is relatively low for managers; and (4) a major influence on the decision to take protective action comes from colleagues, supervisors and friends. Policy implications are discussed regarding what steps should be taken based on these results to help businesses protect themselves from the extensive damage that could result from a computer <b>virus</b> <b>attack.</b> decision making computer virus low-probability high-risk behavioral model expected utility...|$|R

40|$|With the {{explosive}} {{popularity of the}} Internet, the number of accessible web servers has proliferated as well.

Faced with <b>attack</b> from <b>viruses,</b> it is important to master virus spreading behaviors in multi-hop network. It can help us to take measures to reduce the loss caused by <b>viruses</b> <b>attack.</b> Therefore, devising <b>virus</b> spreading models for multi-hop network is an important research area. In this paper, classic susceptible-infected (SI) model, susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model, and susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model are applied to multi-hop network based on random way-point (RWP) model [7 – 9] to analyze virus spreading behaviors. Simulation results show a special node speed that can lead network to appear the fastest-spreading virus phenomenon is approximately equal to the ratio of communication radius of node to contact duration of virus. Distribution density of node and the number of initial infected nodes almost do not affect the special speed. Simulation results of this paper are of practical value for the analysis of virus spreading and give a deeper understanding of virus spreading behaviors in multi-hop network.|$|R
