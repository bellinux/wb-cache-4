40|$|Abstract—Sparse signal {{recovery}} finds use in {{a variety}} of practical applications, such as signal and image restoration and the recovery of signals acquired by compressive sensing. In this paper, we present two generic VLSI architectures that implement the approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm for sparse signal recovery. The first architecture, referred to as AMP-M, employs parallel multiply-accumulate units and is suitable for recovery problems based on unstructured (e. g., random) matrices. The second architecture, referred to as AMP-T, takes advantage of fast linear transforms, which arise in many real-world applications. To demonstrate the effectiveness of both architectures, we present corresponding VLSI and FPGA implementation results for an audio restoration application. We show that AMP-T is superior to AMP-M with respect to silicon area, throughput, and power consumption, whereas AMP-M offers more flexibility.

40|$|<b>Very-Large</b> <b>Scale</b> <b>Integration</b> (<b>VLSI)</b> is {{the problem}} of {{arranging}} components on the surface of a circuit board and developing the wired network between components. One methodology in VLSI is to treat the entire network as a graph, where the components correspond to vertices and the wired connections correspond to edges. We say that a graph G has a rectangle visibility representation if we can assign each vertex of G to a unique axis-aligned rectangle in the plane such that two vertices u and v are adjacent if and only if there exists an unobstructed horizontal or vertical channel of finite width between the two rectangles that correspond to u and v. If G has such a representation, then we say that G is a rectangle visibility graph. Since it is likely that multiple components on a circuit board may represent the same electrical node, we may consider implementing this idea with rectangle visibility graphs. The rectangle visibility number of a graph G, denoted r(G), is the minimum k such that G has a rectangle visibility representation in which each vertex of G corresponds to at most k rectangles. In this thesis, we prove results on rectangle visibility numbers of trees, complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, and (1,n) -hilly graphs, which are graphs where there is no path of length 1 between vertices of degree n or more...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a multi-mode soft-output multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) signal detector that is ef-ficient in hardware cost and energy consumption. The detector {{is capable of}} dealing with spatial-multiplexing (SM), space-division-multiple-access (SDMA), and spatial-diversity (SD) signals of 4 × 4 antenna and 64 -QAM modulation. Implementation-friendly algorithms, which reuse most of the mathematical operations in these three MIMO modes, are proposed to provide accurate soft detection information, i. e., log-likelihood ratio (LLR), with much reduced complexity. A unified reconfigurable VLSI architecture has been developed to eliminate the implementation of multiple detector modules. In addition, several block level technologies, such as parallel metric update and fast bit-flipping, are adopted to enable a more efficient design. To evaluate the proposed techniques, we implemented the triple-mode MIMO detector in a 65 -nm CMOS technology. The core area is 0. 25 mm 2 with 83. 7 K gates. The maximum detecting throughput is 1 Gb/s at 167 -MHz clock frequency and 1. 2 -V supply, which archives the data rate envisioned by the emerging long-term evolution advanced (LTE-A) standard. Under frequency-selective channels, the detector consumes 59. 3 pJ, 10. 5 pJ, and 169. 6 pJ energy per bit detection in SM, SD, and SDMA modes, respectively.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} reduction of computation cost by introducing redundancy {{in the number of}} ports {{as well as in the}} input and output sequences of computation modules. Using our formulation, the classical "communication scenario" is the case when a computation module has to recompute the input sequence at a different location or time with high fidelity and low bit-error rates. We then consider communication with different computational cost objective than that given by bit-error rate. An example is communication over deep submicrometer <b>very-large</b> <b>scale</b> <b>integration</b> (<b>VLSI)</b> buses where the expected energy consumption per communicated information bit is the cost of computation. We treat this scenario using tools from information theory and establish fundamental bounds on the achievable expected energy consumption per bit in deep submicrometer VLSI buses as a function of their utilization. Some of our results also shed light on coding schemes that achieve these bounds. We then prove that the best tradeoff between the expected energy consumption per bit and bus utilization can be achieved using codes constructed from typical sequences of Markov stationary ergodic processes. We use this observation to give a closed-form expression for the best tradeoff between the expected energy consumption per bit and the utilization of the bus. This expression, in principle, can be computed using standard numerical methods. The methodology developed here naturally extends to more general computation scenarios...|$|E
40|$|Complementary-Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) {{feature size}} scaling has {{resulted}} in significant improvements in the performance and energy efficiency of integrated circuits in the past 4 decades. However, {{in the last decade}} and for technology nodes below 90 nm, the scaling of threshold and supply voltages has slowed, as a result of subthreshold leakage, and power density has increased with each new technology node. This has forced a move toward multi-core architectures, but the energy efficiency benefits of parallelism are limited by the sub-thresahold leakage and the minimum energy point for a given function. Avoiding this roadblock requires an alternative device with more ideal switching characteristics. One promising class of such devices is the electro-statically actuated micro-electro-mechanical (MEM) relay which offers zero leakage current and abrupt turn-on behavior. Although a MEM relay is inherently slower than a CMOS transistor due to the mechanical movement, we have developed circuit design methodologies to mitigate this problem at the system level. This thesis explores such design optimization techniques and investigates the viability of MEM relays as an alternative switching technology for <b>very-large</b> <b>scale</b> <b>integration</b> (<b>VLSI)</b> applications. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, the feasibility of MEM relays for power management applications is discussed. Due to their negligibly low leakage, in certain applications, chips utilizing power gates built with MEM relays can achieve lower total energy than those built with CMOS transistors. A simple comparative analysis is presented and provides design guidelines and energy savings estimates as a function of technology parameters, and quantifies the further benefits of scaled relay designs. We also demonstrate a relay chip successfully power-gating a CMOS chip, and show a relay-based pulse generator suitable for self-timed operation. Going beyond power-gating applications, this work also describes circuit techniques and trade-offs for logic design with MEM-relays, focusing on multipliers which are commonly known as the most complex arithmetic units in a digital system. These techniques leverage the large disparity between mechanical and electrical time-constants of a relay, partitioning the logic into large, complex gates to minimize the effect of mechanical delay and improve circuit performance. At the component design level, innovations in compressor unit design minimize the required number of relays for each block and facilitate component cascading with no delay penalty. We analyze the area/energy/delay trade-offs vs. CMOS designs, for typical bit-widths, and show that scaled relays offer 10 - 20 x lower energy per operation for moderate throughputs (< 10 - 100 MOPS). In addition to this analysis, we demonstrate the functionality of some of the most complex MEM relay circuits reported to date. Finally, considering the importance of signal generation and transmission in VLSI systems, this thesis presents MEM relay-based I/O units, focusing on design and demonstration of digital to analog converters (DAC). It also explores the concept of faster-than-mechanical-delay signal transmission. by Hossein Fariborzi. Thesis (Ph. D.)
