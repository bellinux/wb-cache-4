25|$|A {{piezoelectric}} transformer {{is a type}} of AC voltage multiplier. Unlike {{a conventional}} transformer, which uses magnetic coupling between input and output, the piezoelectric transformer uses acoustic coupling. An input voltage is applied across a short length of a bar of piezoceramic material such as PZT, creating an alternating stress in the bar by the inverse piezoelectric effect and causing the whole bar to vibrate. The <b>vibration</b> <b>frequency</b> is chosen to be the resonant frequency of the block, typically in the 100kilohertz to 1megahertz range. A higher output voltage is then generated across another section of the bar by the piezoelectric effect. Step-up ratios of more than 1,000:1 have been demonstrated. An extra feature of this transformer is that, by operating it above its resonant frequency, it can be made to appear as an inductive load, which is useful in circuits that require a controlled soft start. These devices can be used in DC–AC inverters to drive cold cathode fluorescent lamps. Piezo transformers {{are some of the most}} compact high voltage sources.|$|E

Interaction curves for cylinders subjected to axial compressive loadings and low natural <b>vibration</b> <b>frequencies</b> indicate that transverse shearing effects are less important in predicting low natural <b>vibration</b> <b>frequencies</b> than in predicting axial compressive buckling loads. The effects of anisotropy are more important than the effects of transverse shear deformation for most strongly anisotropic laminated cylinders in predicting natural <b>vibration</b> <b>frequencies.</b> However, transverse-shear deformation effects are important in predicting high natural <b>vibration</b> <b>frequencies</b> of thick-walled laminated cylinders.

In this study, Gaussian mixture model (GMM) combining with novelty detection was proposed to eliminate the effect of environmental temperature on <b>vibration</b> <b>frequencies</b> of bridges. Firstly, GMM was applied to classify the monitoring modal parameters, obtained by using the long-term monitoring data of bridges, into different clusters.
