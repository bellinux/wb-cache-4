40|$|The {{properties}} of latent herpesvirus of turkey (HVT) and Marek's disease <b>virus</b> (MDV) <b>genomes</b> {{have been studied}} in virus-non-producer MDCC-BOI(T) cells, a T-lymphoblastoid cell line derived from spleen cells of an HVT-vaccinated chicken. The numbers of the two <b>virus</b> <b>genomes</b> in BO 1 (T) cells remained stable at 1. 6 to 1. 8 HVT genome equivalents/cell and 3. 4 to 3. 8 MDV genome equivalents/cell throughout a number of passages and were not decreased {{by the presence of}} phosphonoacetic acid in the culture. When the culture temperature of the MDV-producer MDCC-MSB 1 cell line was shifted from 41 to 37 °C, the cells cultured at 37 °C contained about five times as many <b>virus</b> <b>genomes</b> as those cultured at 41 °C.

5|$|During viral replication, the {{integrated}} DNA provirus is transcribed into RNA, {{some of which}} then undergo RNA splicing to produce mature mRNAs. These mRNAs are exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where they are translated into the regulatory proteins Tat (which encourages new virus production) and Rev. As the newly produced Rev protein accumulates in the nucleus, it binds to full-length, unspliced copies of virus RNAs and allows them to leave the nucleus. Some of these full-length RNAs function as new copies of the <b>virus</b> <b>genome,</b> while others function as mRNAs that are translated to produce the structural proteins Gag and Env. Gag proteins bind to copies of the virus RNA genome to package them into new virus particles.|$|E
5|$|Once {{inside the}} skin, dengue virus binds to Langerhans cells (a {{population}} of dendritic {{cells in the}} skin that identifies pathogens). The virus enters the cells through binding between viral proteins and membrane proteins on the Langerhans cell, specifically the C-type lectins called DC-SIGN, mannose receptor and CLEC5A. DC-SIGN, a non-specific receptor for foreign material on dendritic cells, {{seems to be the}} main point of entry. The dendritic cell moves to the nearest lymph node. Meanwhile, the <b>virus</b> <b>genome</b> is translated in membrane-bound vesicles on the cell's endoplasmic reticulum, where the cell's protein synthesis apparatus produces new viral proteins that replicate the viral RNA and begin to form viral particles. Immature virus particles are transported to the Golgi apparatus, the part of the cell where some of the proteins receive necessary sugar chains (glycoproteins). The now mature new viruses are released by exocytosis. They are then able to enter other white blood cells, such as monocytes and macrophages.|$|E
5|$|Co-evolution {{hypothesis}} : This is {{also called}} the virus-first hypothesis and proposes that viruses may have evolved from complex molecules of protein and nucleic acid {{at the same time}} as cells first appeared on Earth and would have been dependent on cellular life for billions of years. Viroids are molecules of RNA that are not classified as viruses because they lack a protein coat. However, they have characteristics that are common to several viruses and are often called subviral agents. Viroids are important pathogens of plants. They do not code for proteins but interact with the host cell and use the host machinery for their replication. The hepatitis delta virus of humans has an RNA genome similar to viroids but has a protein coat derived from hepatitis B virus and cannot produce one of its own. It is, therefore, a defective virus. Although hepatitis delta <b>virus</b> <b>genome</b> may replicate independently once inside a host cell, it requires the help of hepatitis B virus to provide a protein coat so that it can be transmitted to new cells. In similar manner, the sputnik virophage is dependent on mimivirus, which infects the protozoan Acanthamoeba castellanii. These viruses, which are dependent on the presence of other virus species in the host cell, are called satellites and may represent evolutionary intermediates of viroids and viruses.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} the derivation {{of a novel}} T-cell-defective virus vector employing the human herpesvirus 7 (HHV- 7). The new vector, designated Tamplicon- 7, replicates in CD 4 + T cells. The system is composed of a helper virus and defective <b>virus</b> <b>genomes</b> derived by the replication of the input Tamplicon vector. There are two cis-acting functions required for the replication and packaging of the defective <b>virus</b> <b>genomes</b> {{in the presence of}} the helper virus: the viral DNA replication origin and the composite cleavage and packaging signal, which directs the cleavage and packaging of defective <b>virus</b> <b>genomes.</b> Viral DNA replication is compatible with the rolling circle mechanism, producing large head-to-tail concatemers of the Tamplicon vector. Thus, {{in the presence of the}} helper virus, the replicated vectors are packaged and secreted into the medium. Furthermore, we have shown that the vector can be employed to express a foreign gene, encoding the green fluorescent protein, in the T cells infected with the HHV- 7 helper virus. We predict that the Tamplicon- 7 vector might be potentially useful for gene therapy of diseases affecting the human CD 4 + T cells, including autoimmune diseases, T-cell lymphomas, and AIDS...|$|R

25|$|The {{central core}} of a virion {{contains}} the viral genome and other viral proteins that package and protect the genetic material. Unlike the genomes of most organisms (including humans, animals, plants, and bacteria) which {{are made up of}} double-stranded DNA, many viral genomes are made up of a different, single-stranded nucleic acid called RNA. Unusually for a virus, though, the influenza type A <b>virus</b> <b>genome</b> is not a single piece of RNA; instead, it consists of segmented pieces of negative-sense RNA, each piece containing either one or two genes which code for a gene product (protein). The term negative-sense RNA just implies that the RNA genome cannot be translated into protein directly; it must first be transcribed to positive-sense RNA before it can be translated into protein products. The segmented nature of the genome allows for the exchange of entire genes between different viral strains.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, many cancers {{originate}} from a viral infection; {{this is especially}} true in animals such as birds, but less so in humans. 12% of human cancers can be attributed to a viral infection. The mode of virally induced tumors can be divided into two, acutely transforming or slowly transforming. In acutely transforming viruses, the viral particles carry a gene that encodes for an overactive oncogene called viral-oncogene (v-onc), and the infected cell is transformed as soon as v-onc is expressed. In contrast, in slowly transforming viruses, the <b>virus</b> <b>genome</b> is inserted, especially as viral genome insertion is obligatory part of retroviruses, near a proto-oncogene in the host genome. The viral promoter or other transcription regulation elements, in turn, cause over-expression of that proto-oncogene, which, in turn, induces uncontrolled cellular proliferation. Because viral genome insertion is not specific to proto-oncogenes and the chance of insertion near that proto-oncogene is low, slowly transforming viruses have very long tumor latency compared to acutely transforming virus, which already carries the viral-oncogene.|$|E
40|$|SummaryRIG-I {{is a key}} {{mediator}} of antiviral immunity, able {{to couple}} detection of infection by RNA viruses to the induction of interferons. Natural RIG-I stimulatory RNAs have variously been proposed to correspond to <b>virus</b> <b>genomes,</b> <b>virus</b> replication intermediates, viral transcripts, or self-RNA cleaved by RNase L. However, the relative contribution {{of each of these}} RNA species to RIG-I activation and interferon induction in virus-infected cells is not known. Here, we use three approaches to identify physiological RIG-I agonists in cells infected with influenza A virus or Sendai virus. We show that RIG-I agonists are exclusively generated by the process of virus replication and correspond to full-length <b>virus</b> <b>genomes.</b> Therefore, nongenomic viral transcripts, short replication intermediates, and cleaved self-RNA do not contribute substantially to interferon induction in cells infected with these negative strand RNA viruses. Rather, single-stranded RNA viral genomes bearing  5 ′-triphosphates constitute the natural RIG-I agonists that trigger cell-intrinsic innate immune responses during infection...|$|R
