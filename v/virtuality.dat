Grimes is described by the Montreal Gazette as [...] "an art-pop phenomenon" [...] and part of [...] "a long tradition of fascination with the pop star as artwork in progress", with particular attention drawn to role of the Internet and digital platforms in her success. In a 2012 piece for Dummy, critic Adam Harper described an accelerationist zeitgeist in contemporary art-pop characterized by an ambiguous engagement with elements of contemporary capitalism. He mentions the Internet-based genre vaporwave as consisting of underground art-pop musicians [...] "exploring the technological and commercial frontiers of 21st century hyper-capitalism's grimmest artistic sensibilities."

We first integrate out hard modes with <b>virtualities</b> of order m_b^ 2 (m_b being the heavy quark mass), and then hard-collinear modes with <b>virtualities</b> m_b Lambda (Lambda being the strong interaction scale).
