5|$|Stalin was <b>very</b> <b>disappointed</b> and infuriated by {{the early}} reports of heavy Soviet losses in the battle, and {{on the evening of}} 12 July he scolded Rotmistrov via a phone call. He {{considered}} sacking Rotmistrov and having him court-martialed, but ended up not doing so. The same evening, he dispatched Zhukov, who had been overseeing Operation Kutuzov, to Vatutin's headquarters as Stavka representative, in order to assume control of coordinating the operations of the Voronezh and Steppe Fronts.|$|E
5|$|Joining Mikulski as an {{advocate}} for servicing Hubble was NASA's Chief Scientist, physicist John Grunsfeld, who {{was present at the}} meeting when O'Keefe announced the cancellation of the mission. A veteran astronaut of four shuttle missions, including two Hubble servicing missions, Grunsfeld had devoted years to Hubble, and was <b>very</b> <b>disappointed</b> when O'Keefe canceled the mission. He briefly considered retiring from NASA, but realized if he stayed, he could continue to advance physics in other ways. Instead, Grunsfeld dedicated himself to finding alternate ways to service the telescope, possibly by sending a robot into orbit to do the job. When O'Keefe announced his resignation as Administrator in December 2004, five days after a National Academy of Sciences committee opposed O'Keefe's position regarding servicing Hubble, the media and science community saw hope for the telescope's servicing mission to be reinstated.|$|E

5|$|Jerry still {{worries about}} Elaine, but Harold and Manny inform him {{that someone else}} has bid higher than Elaine and will get the {{apartment}} unless Elaine is able to pay $5,000. Elaine is <b>very</b> <b>disappointed</b> when she hears the news. However, Kramer convinces Jerry to lend Elaine the money. When Elaine, Jerry and George {{go to a party}} of a friend of Elaine, Elaine asks Jerry if it would be uncomfortable for them to live so close to each other, but Jerry says he does not worry. George's wedding ring plan backfires, as he discovers that wearing the ring is actually causing women who would otherwise date him to reject him. Jerry feels stupid for not telling Elaine the truth, but, the following day, Kramer informs him that he found somebody who is willing to pay $10,000 for the apartment. However, Kramer's friend, a musician, plays loud music all day long, and Jerry regrets not letting Elaine rent the apartment.|$|E

25|$|I am <b>very</b> <b>disappointed</b> {{that this}} {{decision}} was not communicated to me personally {{but that it was}} faxed to my lawyers. I find it shameful that, after so many years of good cooperation and after all I have done for the team, I am being treated as a fax number.|$|E

25|$|Many DPP {{supporters}} were <b>very</b> <b>disappointed</b> {{with the results}} of the election. Various DPP members went on stage at the party's Central Headquarters in Taipei and apologised to the Taiwanese people.

He pledged he would never again run for public office. The DPP leaders ended the day by bowing down to the crowd.|$|E
25|$|While glad {{to regain}} his freedom, Hoffa was <b>very</b> <b>disappointed</b> with the {{condition}} imposed on his release by President Nixon, which prevented Hoffa from engaging in union activities until March 1980. He accused senior Nixon administration figures, including Attorney General John N. Mitchell and White House Special Counsel Charles Colson, of depriving him of his rights by initiating this clause; Mitchell and Colson both denied this. It was likely imposed upon Hoffa {{as the result of}} requests from the Teamsters' leadership, although IBT President Frank Fitzsimmons also denied this.|$|E
5000|$|... "To me, the Runaways is my baby, so {{you have}} to {{understand}} my perspective. If there’s gonna be a Runaways movie, it should be about what we accomplished, the tours we did, the bands we played with, the people we inspired. I’m not gonna participate in a Jerry Springer fest, bottom line. With any band, you’re gonna have interpersonal conflicts, but if that’s what they thought the Runaways were about—about breaking a bass or putting on make-up—well, it’s <b>very</b> <b>disappointing.</b> <b>Very,</b> <b>very</b> <b>disappointing.</b> I {{wanted nothing to do with}} it because that’s not the band I was in. film was a totally different take on what went down." ...|$|R

25|$|England won the toss, {{chose to}} bat {{and made an}} {{impressive}} start to their innings, with the opening stand being worth 133 in 39 overs. Michael Vaughan played some exquisite shots, bringing back memories of his performances against India and Australia in 2002 {{when he reached the}} top of the world rankings. It took a freakish dismissal to remove him, the ball getting caught in the trousers of the short leg fielder who then managed to grab it before it hit the ground. Vaughan had made 87, and was <b>very</b> <b>disappointed</b> to have to leave the crease when he had the potential to make a very large score.|$|E
25|$|In the election, Taylor won 47.3% of {{the popular}} vote and a {{majority}} of the electoral vote, giving the Whigs control of the presidency. Cass won 42.5% of the vote, while Van Buren finished with 10.1% {{of the popular}} vote, more than any other third party presidential candidate at that time. Despite the increasingly polarizing slavery debate, Taylor and Cass both won a mix of northern and southern states. However, much of Van Buren's support came from northern Democrats. Polk was <b>very</b> <b>disappointed</b> by the outcome as he had a low opinion of Taylor, seeing the general as someone with poor judgment and few opinions. Polk left office on March 4, 1849, and departed Washington on March 6.|$|E

The Brumbies also suffered a loss at | home to the Bulls whereas the controversial game of the round saw the Waratahs draw with the Western Force because of a blunder by Waratahs utility back Sam Norton-Knight who decide to run with the ball in the final minute instead of taking the penalty shot which could have won them the game and for his mistake Lote Tuqiri shoved him and walked off the pitch looking <b>very</b> <b>disappointed.</b>|$|E

25|$|Early in 1913, Deakin {{resigned}} as Leader of the Opposition. Forrest and Joseph Cook contested the leadership, with Cook winning {{by a single}} vote. Forrest was <b>very</b> <b>disappointed,</b> especially since Deakin, whom he considered a friend, had voted against him. Five months later, in the May 1913 federal election, the Liberal Party returned to power, with Cook as Prime Minister. Forrest was appointed treasurer for the third time. However, the government's majority of just one seat in the House of Representatives, along with Labor's large majority in the Senate, {{made it difficult to}} get anything done. In June 1914, Cook asked the Governor-General for a double dissolution, and Australia was sent back to the polls. Forrest retained his seat, but the Liberal Party was soundly defeated and Forrest was again relegated to the crossbenches.|$|E
25|$|On June 6, Woods {{stated that}} he would remain with {{longtime}} agent Mark Steinberg after the agent's contract was not renewed by the International Management Group. The following day, {{he announced that he}} would not be playing in the 2011 U.S. Open, set to begin June 16, due to continued pain in his left Achilles tendon and left anterior cruciate ligament. Woods stated he was <b>very</b> <b>disappointed</b> to be unable to play in the season's second major championship, but that he was listening to his doctors, continuing to work on his recovery, and planning for the long term. Woods also missed the 2011 British Open, still recovering from injury. He fired his longtime caddy Steve Williams following the AT National in early July; Williams now caddies for Adam Scott.|$|E
25|$|After Joan Crawford's third divorce, Gable and she {{resumed their}} affair and lived {{together}} for a brief time. Gable was acclaimed for his performance in The Hucksters (1947), a satire of postwar Madison Avenue corruption and immorality. A very public and brief romance with Paulette Goddard occurred after that. In 1949, Gable married Sylvia Ashley, a British model and actress who was previously married to Douglas Fairbanks. The relationship was profoundly unsuccessful; they divorced in 1952. Soon followed Never Let Me Go (1953), opposite Gene Tierney. Tierney was a favorite of Gable and he was <b>very</b> <b>disappointed</b> when she was replaced in Mogambo (because of her mental health problems) by Grace Kelly. Mogambo (1953), directed by John Ford, was a somewhat sanitized remake of his earlier Pre-Code film Red Dust, with Jean Harlow and Mary Astor, which had been a greater success. Gable's on-location affair with Grace Kelly (1929–1982), who was {{young enough to be}} his daughter, gradually ended after filming was completed.|$|E
5000|$|In 2012, Lester {{was again}} {{the opening day}} starter for the Red Sox. Lester's season was <b>very</b> <b>disappointing,</b> posting a 9-14 record, a sub-par 4.82 ERA, and a [...]273 batting average against.|$|R

25|$|Powell next competed at the DKF Bislett Games in Oslo, Norway {{where he}} powered to a splendid victory with a wind-aided 9.72s. A week later, he competed at the Golden Gala in Rome, Italy, where he overcame {{a very poor}} {{reaction}} time at the start to take another victory in a World Leading time of 9.82s.It was reported that Powell ended his six-year contract with leading sports brand, Nike, due to sponsorship problems and rumours spread {{that he has a}} new contract with fast upcoming Chinese sports brand, Li-Ning. Asafa next competed in the 200m of the Jamaican Senior Trials where he won the final in 19.97s, his second fastest ever. There, for the first time, he promoted his new Li Ning outfit. Powell next competed in Gateshead where he got off to a terrific start, but lost to fast finishing Tyson Gay, who took the victory in 9.94s to Powell's 9.96s in a strong 1.7m/s headwind. Powell was not <b>very</b> <b>disappointed</b> as he mentioned that he got too relaxed, thus allowing Gay to outdo him in the final strides. The next race in Paris against Usain Bolt was a disappointing one. Although he had a good start, Bolt caught him at halfway point, and Asafa began to lose his fluent running form. He finished 2nd to Bolt in 9.91s, 0.07s slower than his rival, also into a slight headwind. Asafa said that he had a very bad race, which he hoped to improve in his upcoming races. Unfortunately for Powell, there was not a 'next race' for him. He picked up strains from his Paris meeting which aggravated to hamstring and back problems. Powell missed his next two outings where he was scheduled to clash against Bolt and Gay. Powell ended his splendid 2010 season on a disappointing note although he expressed satisfaction on the races that he competed for the year.|$|E

[...] Moran blocked federal funding for an HOV ramp directly to the Mark Center citing the impact upon Winkler Preserve.|$|E

I think the problem is that she wants control over {{everything}} – that's one of the themes of the book, and secondly she seems to be almost disowning her past at the moment. She's reinventing herself as an upper-class, English aristocrat, and the former vegetarian who now goes hunting, fishing and shooting. My door's always open – Madonna's welcome to my house for a cup of tea.|$|E
