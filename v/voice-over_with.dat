The relationship [...] "footage" [...] is played straight, while the <b>voice-over</b> (<b>with</b> its most often wildly inaccurate theories) and elaborate visual metaphors add comedy. Among other themes the film explores the possibility that, whenever describing their interpretations of other species' acts and feelings, humans may get everything wrong.|$|E

5000|$|The episode {{starts with}} the ever-present into <b>voice-over,</b> <b>with</b> Meredith {{reflecting}} on memories. We quickly learn {{that they are a}} tricky business, as she reflects back on a day we’ve seen before, Richard breaking up with Ellis at the carousel. She remembers calling the ambulance when Ellis slit her wrists, and a doctor advising her that she saved her mother’s life. What she doesn’t realize is that her memories aren’t completely accurate. We hear a baby cry and Ellis say she doesn’t want to see [...] "her." [...] Meredith remembers it as the same day, but we see her in a different dress outside the hospital curtain. We, as viewers, now know the timeline of Maggie’s birth, but clearly Meredith has suppressed the memory.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the late}} 1960s, visual artists have used slide shows in museums and {{galleries}} as a device, either for presenting specific information about an action or research or as a phenomenological form in itself. According {{to the introduction}} of Slide Show, an exhibition organized at the Baltimore Museum of Art: “Through the simple technology of the slide projector and 35 mm color transparency, artists discovered a tool that enabled the transformation of space through the magnification of projected pictures, texts, and images.” Although some artists have not necessarily used 35 mm or color slides, and some, such as Robert Barry, have even abandoned images for texts, 35 mm color film slides are most commonly used. The images are sometimes accompanied by written text, either in the same slide or as an intertitle. Some artists, such as James Coleman and Robert Smithson, have used a <b>voice-over</b> <b>with</b> their slide presentations.|$|E

5000|$|Crumes and Ford {{are enjoying}} some bottled water when the Battle of Khafji begins and a unit needs a Corpsman. Crumes {{is able to}} save one soldier's life, but {{reflects}} to Ford on the terror of war and asks if Vietnam was as bad. Ford replies that the all-volunteer U.S. military in Iraq is better trained than the U.S. military in Vietnam, but adds that the Marines will still go in first, this time like the last. [...] After another news report and video of Scuds falling on Israel, which although attacked, must remain neutral {{for the sake of}} maintaining the international coalition including Egypt and Syria, the Patriot anti-missile system is introduced. Phoebe Jeter's battery saves Gary Buckholz's base. Meanwhile, Beverly Clark and Mary Rhoads are at a processing center for incoming U.S. soldiers, in Dhahran, which will later be hit by a Scud. Meanwhile, Private Steven Shaefer has volunteered for Desert Storm duty, and quickly upon arriving in Kuwait meets Specialist Jonathan Alston. When an explosion is heard in the distance, Alston knows that Shaefer is inexperienced in combat, and questions him about his training. Sure enough, Steven has not been prepped on chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear warfare or even on land mines, merely his basic training. When Jonathan demands to know how the Army messed up sending him into danger, Steven drops his bombshell. Alston is impressed and says they will win medals like Alston's uncles did in the Second World War. The ground war starts. Marine Captain Michael Shupp (played by Kevin Kilner) instructs Ford and Crumes' unit to fight professionally to keep one another safe, but to reserve compassion for Saddam's draftees deliberately sacrificed by Saddam to keep his Republican Guard in reserve, and promises them that they will all make it through and go home. Precision weapons save their unit when the enemy is [...] "danger close". Shupp orders his men only to fire in self-defense after the enemy surrenders. Indeed, another news reporter voices over video of long lines of Iraqi prisoners of war who had been forced to fight with death squads and land mines to prevent desertion. Guy Hunter, Jr., gets tortured again after a coalition strike that scares him, and probably did more than scare his captors. Threatened with execution and blindfolded, Hunter shows no fear, and says [...] "just do it." [...] Meanwhile, Beverly Clark is winning at trivia, but pauses long enough to get a soda and chat with her best friend Mary Rhoads. Beverly tells Mary she has come to peace about being deployed in a danger zone, and Mary invites Beverly to join her for fresh air, though Beverly declines. Suddenly there is a Scud alarm. Mary starts putting on chemical warfare gear, and Beverly instructs others to do the same. However, the Patriot is not successful in annihilating the Scud, and Mary watches in horror as Beverly and her comrades are hit by the incoming warhead. Another news reporter <b>voice-over</b> <b>with</b> video of the aftermath. It is not long before the Clarks in Pennsylvania are summoned to Army Reserve headquarters, where a tactful notification of families is under way, but taking too long for the Clark parents. Beverly's mother found out what her husband, weeping in the senior officer's office, already heard from him, and despite her initial denial, she understands the truth. Alston and Shaefer get their medals when they volunteer to kill an Iraqi suicide squad ready to detonate an ammunition dump in the way of U.S. forces in Objective Utah, western Kuwait, and overcome various dangers including land mines and trip wires. Shaefer distracts the squad with his M-16 while Alston, above the trench, tosses in a hand grenade. [...] The Basra-Kuwait [...] "Highway of Death" [...] is depicted next with more videos and voice-overs, indicating that the intent is not to destroy, but to disable the Iraqi retreat. Nevertheless, in contrast to the funeral of Beverly Clark in Pennsylvania, a significant amount of death exists on the Highway for a U.S. Army chaplain, announced by the newscaster as a rabbi, to provide appropriate Muslim rights for. [...] By now, Hunter has been reunited with other American POWs, including Larry Slade: when one hugs Hunter, it is evident the Iraqis broke his ribs. When the Iraqis come back, they come back with cheap perfume. Hunter challenges the captors, and enraged, one threatens to shoot him, but Hunter is not going to give them the satisfaction of showing fear this time either. He replies, [...] "God bless America." [...] The U.S. troops return home to widespread jubilation, including one Linda Buckholz in her wedding gown. The celebration contrasts with Phoebe Jeter at the grave site of her grandmother.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} the forming of an essayistic voice {{in an online}} interactive documentary called Grey Skies/Blue Skies. Made {{in the context of}} project-based research Grey Skies/Blue Skies combines an essayistic <b>voice-over</b> <b>with</b> a collection of short video clips, where each clip has multiple possible relations to other video clips within the documentary.

Directed by Chantal Akerman. New York: Criterion Collection] News from Home is an essay film which opens a distance between voice-over and panoramic shots of New York City to invite the viewer to think that I will use to see how Grey Skies/Blue Skies realises voice in a multilinear context. From the combined perspectives of multilinear documentary and the essay film this paper will provide a concept of essayistic voice specific to the implications of the network as a particular site for documentary practice...|$|E
