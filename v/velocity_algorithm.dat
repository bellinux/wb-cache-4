40|$|The {{velocity}} {{of climate change}} is an elegant analytical concept {{that can be used}} to evaluate the exposure of organisms to climate change. In essence, one divides the rate of climate change by the rate of spatial climate variability to obtain a speed at which species must migrate over the surface of the earth to maintain constant climate conditions. However, to apply the algorithm for conservation and management purposes, additional information is needed to improve real-ism at local scales. For example, destination information is needed to ensure that vectors describing speed and direc-tion of required migration do not point toward a climatic cul-de-sac by pointing beyond mountain tops. Here, we present an analytical approach that conforms to standard <b>velocity</b> <b>algorithms</b> if climate equivalents are nearby. Other-wise, the algorithm extends the search for climate refugia, which can be expanded to search for multivariate climate matches.
