40|$|Most MR {{angiography}} (MRA) techniques use macroscopic blood {{motion to}} characterize the flowing spins. A different approach {{is represented by the}} use of contrast enhancement of blood pooling agents. The intravenous injection of one of these agents, namely Gd-DTPA polylysine, produces a shortening of the blood T 1 below the T 1 values of fat and soft tissues. In this study on experimental MRA in rabbits, we used an imaging sequence with a 90 degrees saturation pulse and a 180 degrees inversion recovery pulse. Both the saturation and inversion recovery times were adjusted to suppress the signals of soft tissues and fat. The remaining ultrashort T 1 blood was imaged with a projective velocity refocused spin echo or gradient echo sequence. Magnetic resonance angiography provided excellent <b>vessel</b> <b>detail</b> with a 30 - 60 s acquisition time. In addition, {{there was no need for}} further processing after image acquisition because the projection was obtained immediately.

40|$|A {{significant}} amount of variability exists between observers in designating cup/diac (C/D) ratios. Further, different methods are used for evaluating {{the size of the}} cup. On method uses a combination of contour and color, the other specifically measures contour and pallor separately. This study confirms that these methods yeild different numerical results. Interestingly, the "cupping/pallor" observers show no significant difference among one another in C/D determination which may support the notion that cupping observations are more consistent than "standard" C/D ratios. Though both groups feel the cup is larger on stereo compared to monocular viewing, the "cupping/pallor" group demonstrated much greater differences in this regard. However, the evaluation of pallor by the latter group corresponded closely to the C/D ratios of the "standard" group both for nonstereo and stereo. An individual observer is reasonably consistent on repeat evaluation, but at times, inconsistency is quite substantial. These inconsistencies lead to the conclusion that C/D ratios are an inexact method of recording the status of a disc. Except for considerable changes over time, this numerical method is probably not reliable in checking for small disc changes. However, the disc alone can provide clues as to whether it is physiologic or pathologic. Nevertheless, even with expert observers, significant variability exists in interpretation of an optic disc in this regard. Individuals who evaluate the disc cup by cupping and pallor tend to call discs more pathologic than other observers. The clinical implications {{of this study suggest that}} certain observers are more accurate than others and certain discs are more easily evaluated than others. Yet, no one method seems foolproof and no specific criteria can as yet distinguish a normal from an abnormal disc. Stereo color transparencies are evaluated more accurately than are nonstereo color prints. <b>Vessel</b> <b>detail</b> and pallor patterns are probably the most useful disc characteristics to observe. In this regard, a C/D ratio does nothing to indicate whether a disc is normal or not. A statement as to the observer's opinion should be made for each disc evaluation in addition to recording the appearance of the disc...|$|E
40|$|The Shuweihat Water Transmission Scheme (SWTS, UAE) {{consists}} of a twin DN 1600 DI PN 25 pipeline transmitting 150 MIGD over 250 km from Shuweihat Desalination plant to Mussafah (Abu Dhabi city). The Scheme is divided in two subsequent systems, each with a tank farm and a pump station delivering water to downstream terminal reservoirs and direct consumers. The first system (Lot A) transmits water from Shuweihat to Mirfa (100 km). The second (Lot C) is from Mirfa to Mussafah (150 km). The pipeline follows roughly the UAE coastline and the profile is generally flat with a few local high points. The surge study of the Lot C system investigated {{a large number of}} scenarios and resulted in the design of surge protection equipments and control systems. The surge protection equipment {{consists of}} 16 x 121 m 3 (1936 m 3) innovative vertical non-vented air vessels, invented by Deltares. The innovation includes a passive air release valve at a strategic elevation on the air vessel. This air release valve opens if the water level drops below the float level. At this water level the air pressure is super-atmospheric so that air is released from the air vessel to prevent draining. This innovation was driven by the initial findings of the surge analysis where it became apparent that 22 x 220 m 3 (4840 m 3) air vessels would have been required. These large vessels were the result of a double constraint. On the one hand, the initial air mass had to be sufficient to allow a proper expansion of the vessels and thus the protection of the pipeline against excessive negative pressures. On the other hand, a very small initial air mass was required {{due to the lack of}} backpressure. This meant that the air pocket was expanding by a factor exceeding 20, resulting in the emptying of the vessels. In this paper, we will describe the hydraulic model of the hybrid air <b>vessel,</b> <b>detail</b> the benefits of the new design and discuss the cost savings compared to conventional air vessels. It is concluded that the hybrid air vessel has saved over 50 % of the required air vessels total volume. Considering the size of air vessels initially required, the costs savings in terms of surge protection of the SWTS Lot C system were cut in excess of 60 %.

40|$|Thymosin β 4 (Tβ 4) is a 43 {{amino acid}} peptide encoded by the Tmsb 4 x gene {{located on the}} X-chromosome. It has {{previously}} been shown {{to act as a}} secreted factor from the myocardium to the overlying epicardium of the developing murine heart, to mediate transformation of epicardial derived progenitor cells (EPDCs) into the coronary vasculature. This PhD project seeks to build on these studies and characterises the function of Tβ 4 in the developing systemic vasculature, using the mouse as a model system. Expression analyses demonstrated specific localisation of Tβ 4 /Tβ 4 in the endothelial cells of the embryonic vasculature. In order to ascertain the function of vascular Tβ 4, global and endothelial cell specific in vivo Tβ 4 loss of function models were examined. Both global and endothelial-specific Tβ 4 mutant embryos displayed a reduced recruitment of vascular mural cells to developing blood <b>vessels.</b> <b>Detailed</b> phenotypic examination revealed that the mural cell deficit could be attributed to impaired differentiation of mature mural cells from undifferentiated mesoderm. This process was modelled in vitro, and it was discovered that treatment of the mural progenitor cell lines 10 T 1 / 2 and A 404 with exogenous Tβ 4 could promote their differentiation into mural cells. This process correlated with an increase in Smad phosphorylation and increased activity of the TGF-β pathway. Decreased levels of TGF-β target genes in vivo in Tβ 4 β null embryos indicated that TGF-β signalling was perturbed in the absence of Tβ 4. These findings suggest a model whereby Tβ 4 is secreted by the developing endothelium to stimulate the differentiation of uncommitted mesoderm into mature peri-vascular mural cells, via activation of the TGF-β pathway in the target cell population. As a consequence, Tb 4 plays an essential role in vascular stability through mural cell support which has implications for vascular dysfunction in disease...|$|R
