Ken Ramsey takes particular pride in the farm's water, which is taken from springs and creeks that are on farm property, and used for both human and horse consumption. However, the horses are also given luxury treatment when needed—the farm also has an equine spa that has an underwater treadmill with whirlpool jets.

40|$|Abstract: In {{the search}} of new {{strategies}} {{to improve the quality}} of life of Parkinson’s disease patients, recent work has reported an amelioration of Parkinsonian symptoms using Whole Body Vibration (WBV). A double-blinded, placebo controlled design was used to evaluate the effect of a 12 WBV sessions-pro-gramme on a number of motor and clinical tests in 23 Parkin-son’s disease patients. Patients were assigned to one of two groups, one receiving WBV and the other a placebo group. At the end of the programme as well as during intra-session evalu-ation, there was no difference between the experimental (vibra-tion) and placebo groups in any outcomes.

50|$|<b>Vibrating</b> <b>platforms</b> {{fall into}} different, {{distinct}} categories. The type of platform used is a moderator {{of the effect}} and result of the training or therapy performed (Marin PJ, Rhea MR, 2010). Main categories of machine types are: 1. High Energy Lineal, found mostly in commercial vibration training studios and gyms. The vibration direction is lineal/upward eliciting a strong stretch-reflex contraction in muscle fibres targeted by the positions of training program. 2. Premium Speed Pivotal, (teeter-totter movement) used for physiotherapy work at lower speeds and exercise workouts at “premium” speed, up to 36 Hz. Both commercial and home units are available. 3. Medium Energy Lineal, the majority of lineal platforms produced. These are usually made of plastic; some have 3-D vibration which is low quality. They give slower and less consistent results. 4. Low Speed Pivotal units. These can give “therapy” benefits. Other machine types are low Energy/Low amplitude lineal and Low energy/High amplitude lineal with varying uses from osteoporosis prevention, therapy for improved blood circulation and flexibility and limited fitness training.|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} elicit a stretch reflex in the muscles, the major {{contributing}} factor {{to the training}} results {{that can be achieved}} with <b>vibrating</b> <b>platforms,</b> the up-down movement is the most important. The <b>platform</b> is <b>vibrated</b> upwards to work directlyagainst gravity and therefore is called [...] "hyper-gravity". High Energy Lineal Machines can overload the muscles up to 6 times(6G), high energy pivotal Machines up to 30g in the upward phase; meaning the person on the platform is weight training using their own body mass. Nevertheless, the internal forces in the joints during vibration training stay in the range of walking (1.2 times body weight). The training frequency (Hz) is another of the important factors involved. The human body is designed to absorb vertical vibrations better due to the effects of gravity; however, many machines vibrate in more than one direction: sideways (x), front and back (y) and up and down (z). The z-axis has the largest amplitude and is the most defining component in generating and inducing muscle contractions.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} whole-body vibration (WBV) training in individuals after stroke. DESIGN: A double-blind randomized controlled study with assessments pre- and posttraining. SETTING: A university hospital rehabilitation department. PARTICIPANTS: Participants (N= 31; mean age ± SD, 62 ± 7 y; 6 - 101 mo poststroke) were randomized to an intervention group or a control group. INTERVENTIONS: Supervised WBV training (2 sessions/wk for 6 wk; 12 repetitions of 40 - 60 s WBV per session). The intervention group trained on a <b>vibrating</b> <b>platform</b> with a conventional amplitude (3. 75 mm) and the control group on a "placebo" <b>vibrating</b> <b>platform</b> (0. 2 mm amplitude); the frequency was 25 Hz on both platforms. All participants and examiners were blinded to the amplitudes of the 2 platforms. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measures were isokinetic and isometric knee muscle strength (dynamometer). Secondary outcome measures were balance (Berg Balance Scale), muscle tone (Modified Ashworth Scale), gait performance (Timed Up & Go, comfortable gait speed, fast gait speed, and six-minute walk tests), and perceived participation (Stroke Impact Scale). RESULTS: There {{were no significant differences}} between the 2 groups after the WBV training. Significant but small improvements (P<. 05) in body function and gait performance were found within both groups, but the magnitude of the changes was in the range of normative variation.

40|$|This {{experimental}} study {{was done to}} determine pathological feature of vibration injury to the peripheral nerves in the hind limbs of rats exposed to 7 days of vibration. Materials and Methods Animals: Twenty four male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 350 - 400 grams were randomly divided into two groups: sham control group and vibrated group. To document vibration-induced changes in the experimental model, the sciatic nerve was used because it contains both motor and sensory fibers and is relatively superficial in the posterior thigh. Customized Vibrating Platform: The hind limbs of the rats in the vibrated group were exposed to vibration in a custom-built vibrating apparatus consisting of two platforms: a smaller <b>vibrating</b> <b>platform</b> on which the hind limbs of the rat are secured, and a larger platform on which {{the remainder of the}} body rests. The vibration parameters (frequency 43. 5 Hz, amplitude 1. 5 mm, acceleration 4. 75 G, velocity 6 cm/sec., and displacement of 3. 0 mm) of this model were measured. Methods: Rats were anesthetized with 35 mg/kg of intraperitoneal Nembutal (phenobarbital) and their hind limbs fixed to the <b>vibrating</b> <b>platform</b> by Velcro loops. Both hind limbs rest on the <b>vibrating</b> <b>platform</b> while the remainder of the body rests on the larger platform. The rats were vibrated 4 hours a day, for 7 days, with close monitoring of the vibration parameters. The 4 -hour duration of hazardous vibration was based on recommendations from the British Standards Institution. The sciatic nerve of rats not exposed to vibration, but similarly anesthetized and secured to the <b>vibrating</b> <b>platform,</b> acted as controls. At the end of seven days of exposure to vibration, nerves from both the vibrated rats and the control rats were harvested after perfusion of {{the lower half of the}} body using glutaraldehyde as described below. Neural Fixation: The aorta was cannulated, and the inferior vena cava was nicked and the animal was initially perfused with 0. 9 % buffered sodium chloride. This was followed by perfusion of a filtered mixture of 3 % glutaraldehyde and 3 % paraformaldehyde fixation solution, The tissue was subjected to post fixation by routine. The neural tissue was then submitted for light and electron microscopy.

There is little data on the use of an isolated program using vibration platform training on functional capacity in these patients, which is an area that deserves investigation. Aim: To investigate the effect of training on a <b>vibrating</b> <b>platform</b> (whole-body vibration [WBV]) on functional performance and quality of life of subjects with COPD. Methods: A randomized controlled crossover pilot study with eleven subjects with COPD (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV 1]% predicted = 14. 63 ± 11. 14; forced vital capacity [FVC]% predicted = 48. 84 ± 15. 21; FEV 1 /FVC = 47. 39 ± 11. 63) underwent a 12 -week WBV training program. Participants were randomized into the intervention group (IG) undergoing three sessions per week for a total of 12 weeks and control group (CG) without intervention. We evaluated the 6 -minute walk test (6 MWT), distance walked (DW), duration of the walk (TW), and index of perceived exertion (IPE), quality of life using St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and developed a 12 -week program of training on a <b>vibrating</b> <b>platform.</b> Results: The mean age was 62. 91 ± 8. 82 years old (72. 7 % male). The DW increased at the end of training with a difference between groups of 75 m; all domains of the SGRQ improved at the end of training.

RESULTS: (1) Comparing WBV to no vibration, sEMGRMS of the calf muscles was significantly higher with an additional load of 33  kg independently of the displacement and the frequency (P <  0. 05). During WBV, (2) muscle activity at 40  Hz WBV {{was significantly higher than}} at 25  Hz for the gastrocnemius lateralis (GL) for all loads, and for the vastii medialis and lateralis using the 33  kg load (P <  0. 05); (3) sEMGRMS of all lower limb muscles was significantly increased with the 2  mm compared to the 1. 2  mm peak-to-peak displacement (P <  0. 05); (4) an effect of additional load was found in the GL, with significantly higher neuromuscular activation for the 33  kg load than no load (P <  0. 05).

The <b>platform</b> from which control is effected consists of a network of smart sensors, each referred to as a node. Each node possesses its own computational capability, sensor, actuator and the ability to communicate with other nodes via a wired or wireless network. The primary focus of this work is to employ existing group management middleware concepts to enable vibro-acoustic control with such a distributed network. Group management middleware is distributed software that provides for the establishment and maintenance of groups of distributed nodes and that provides for the network communication among such groups. The control objective is met by designing distributed feedback compensators that take advantage of node groups in order to effect their control. The node groups are formed based on physical proximity. The global control objective is to minimize the radiated sound power from a rectangular plate. Results of this investigation demonstrate that such a distributed control system can achieve attenuations comparable to those achieved by a centralized controller...|$|R
