5000|$|A multi-groove, <b>V-Ribbed,</b> or polygroove belt {{is made up}} of usually between 3 and 24 [...] "V" [...] shaped {{sections}} alongside each other. This gives a thinner belt for {{the same}} drive surface, thus it is more flexible, although often wider. The added flexibility offers an improved efficiency, as less energy is wasted in the internal friction of continually bending the belt. In practice this gain of efficiency causes a reduced heating effect on the belt, and a cooler-running belt lasts longer in service. Belts are commercially available in several sizes, with usually a 'P' (sometimes omitted) and a single letter identifying the pitch between grooves. The 'PK' section with a pitch of 3.56 mm is commonly used for automotive applications.|$|E

The results of experimental studies to identify the belt operating conditions associated with belt noise are presented, together with {{the results of}} analytical studies to identify the mechanism of noise generation. It is concluded that tangential slip <b>V-ribbed</b> belt noise generation is controlled only by the amount of slip, and that the mechanism of noise generation is harmonic excitation of the fundamental vibration mode of the belt, with stick¿slip frictional behaviour providing the impetus for the vibratio...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. An {{experimental}} study on heat transfer enhancement in a heat exchanger square-duct fitted diagonally with 45 ° <b>V-ribbed</b> tapes has been conducted. The tested duct has a square section and uniform heat-fluxed {{walls and the}} flow rate of air used as the test fluid is presented in terms of Reynolds number from 4000 to 25, 000. The insertion of the <b>V-ribbed</b> tape is performed with a rib-pitch to duct-height ratio, (P/H=PR= 0. 75 and 2) at the rib attack angle of 45 ° {{with respect to the}} main flow direction. The <b>V-ribbed</b> tape inserted diagonally in the duct is expected to generate a longitudinal vortex flow pair in each tape side through the heated duct. Influences of four rib-to-duct height ratios (e/H=BR= 0. 1, 0. 15, 0. 2 and 0. 25) on the heat transfer and pressure drop in terms of respective Nusselt number and friction factor are investigated. The experimental result indicates that the BR and PR of the V-ribs provide a significant effect on the thermal performance of the test duct. The results reveal that at smaller PR, the V-rib with BR= 0. 25 provides the highest heat transfer and friction factor but the one with BR= 0. 2, PR= 0. 75 yields the best thermal performance...|$|E
50|$|Majority {{of species}} have a V-shaped ridge (<b>V-rib)</b> {{positioned}} {{just ahead of}} the posterior rim on their scales. Also made of silica, the <b>V-rib</b> extends further towards the distal end and stops close to the dome (if present) or at the perimeter of the scale. Near the distal ends of the <b>V-rib,</b> some species have two additional ridges called anterior submarginal ribs, but they’re quite small and terminate at the distal end. Species with <b>V-ribs</b> also have the two anterior submarginal ribs, and the junction between the two is of taxonomic significance, defining some of the many species within this genus.|$|R
50|$|The {{anterior}} submarginal {{ribs and}} the <b>V-rib</b> divide the scale into regions {{that are in}} turn ornamented differently for each species. The section of the base plate that is between the submarginal rib and the <b>V-rib</b> {{is referred to as}} the shield while the section that is outside both the <b>V-rib</b> and the anterior submarginal ribs {{is referred to as the}} posterior flange and the anterior flange, respectively.|$|R

40|$|AbstractAn {{experimental}} work on heat transfer enhancement {{in a round}} tube by insertion of double twisted tapes in common with 30 ° V-shaped ribs has been conducted. Air as the test fluid flowed through the test tube having a constant wall heat-flux with Reynolds number (Re) from 5300 to 24, 000. The combined vortex generators (called “V-ribbed twisted tape”) were obtained by incorporating V-shaped ribs into the edges of double co-twisted tapes having a similar twist ratio of 4. The effect of pertinent V-rib parameters such as four relative rib heights, (called “blockage ratio”, BR=b/D= 0. 07, 0. 09, 0. 14 and 0. 19) and a relative rib pitch, (PR=P/D= 1. 9) at an attack angle of rib, α= 30 ° on thermal characteristics was investigated. The experimental results reveal that the heat transfer and pressure drop {{in terms of the}} respective Nusselt number and friction factor for the <b>V-ribbed</b> twisted tapes show the increasing trend with the rise of Re and BR. The <b>V-ribbed</b> twisted tape with BR= 0. 19 yields the highest heat transfer and friction factor. However, the maximum thermal enhancement factor is about 1. 4 for the <b>V-ribbed</b> twisted tape at BR= 0. 09 but is around 1. 09 for the twisted tape with no rib...|$|E

40|$|Efficient belts {{can provide}} the same {{magnitude}} of energy savings as energy-efficient motors. Therefore, belt drives deserve greater attention, so that their losses should be minimized. The belt drive power losses are a combination of torque losses and speed losses. However, the determination of belt drive behavior in terms of power losses requires extensive experimental investigations. Therefore, in this study, belt slip and torque losses were investigated experimentally with a laboratory constructed test bench. Measurement System Analysis (MSA) was performed in order to investigate the test rig reliability. Special attention was paid for experimental test setup, testing and modeling of torque loss behavior of <b>V-ribbed</b> belt drive systems. Significant design parameters were investigated...|$|E

50|$|The {{anterior}} submarginal ribs, <b>V-rib,</b> and posterior rim {{are considered}} to be secondary structures in regards to the perforated base plate; however, some species also have other secondary structures such as additional ribs or papillae. Rib placement is dependent upon pore placement, as ribs protrude from between pores. Irregular pore patterns lead to irregular rib placement. Papillae consist of small protrusions sticking out of the dome, shield, or anterior flanges that are regularly spaced, vary in density, and can be solid or hollow.|$|R

40|$|The most {{efficient}} technique {{to increase the}} performance of solar air heater is to enhance the heat transfer by using artificial roughness in form of repeatedly used ribs on the absorbing heated absorber plate. In order to analyse the thermal performance and flow pattern of rectangular duct with aspect ratio (W/H) of 8, the present experimental investigation is performed with <b>V-rib</b> with Symmetrical Gap and Staggered Rib. The experiment has covered a Reynolds number (Re) range of 3000 - 14000, rib height 2 mm, pitch (P) 24 mm, relative roughness pitch (P/e) of 12, gap width (g) 8 mm, relative gap width (g/e) as 4 and angle of attack (α) 60 o, number of gaps on each sides of <b>V-rib</b> (Ng) 3, relative roughness height (e/Dh) 0. 045, staggered rib pitch (P’) 15. 6 mm, relative staggered rib pitch (P’/P) 0. 65, staggered rib size (w) 20 mm and relative staggered rib size (w/g) 2. 5.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{investigation has}} been carried out to examine the periodic laminar flow and heat transfer characteristics in a three-dimensional isothermal wall square duct with 20 ° inline <b>V-ribs.</b> The computations are based on the finite volume method, and the SIMPLE algorithm has been implemented. The fluid flow and heat transfer characteristics are presented for Reynolds numbers based on the hydraulic diameter of the square duct ranging from 100 to 2000. To generate main streamwise vortex flows through the tested section, <b>V-ribs</b> with an attack angle of 20 ° are mounted in tandem with inline arrangement, pointing downstream (V-Downstream) and pointing upstream (V-Upstream) placed on both the upper and lower walls. Effects of different blockage ratio (b/H, BR) with a single pitch ratio (P/H, PR) of 1 on heat transfer, pressure loss, and performance in the ribbed tube are studied. Apparently in each of the main vortex flows, streamwise twisted vortex flows can induce impinging flows {{on the walls of the}} interbaffle cavity leading to drastic increase in heat transfer rate over the square duct. In addition, the rise in the V-baffle height results in the increase in the Nusselt number and friction factor values. The computational results show that the optimum thermal enhancement factor is about 4. 2 at BR= 0. 20 and 0. 15 for the V-Downstream and V-Upstream, respectively...|$|R

Scale shapes are circular, elliptical, or ovate, {{generally}} rhombic in nature, {{but they are}} wider than the scales of their sister genus Synura. Scales without domes exhibit bilateral symmetry, except for the collar scales, which are different in terms of shape all together. Scales with domes exhibit slight asymmetry due to the dome shape {{in regards to the}} poster rim and the <b>V-rib.</b> Instead of being flat, scales are curved so they can conform to the cell shape.

40|$|The taxonomic {{concept of}} the algal genus Mallomonas (Synurales, Synurophyceae) {{was based on an}} {{extraordinary}} morphological diversity of their siliceous scales. The main aims of this study were elucidation of phylogenetic relationships among its representatives and reconstruction of shape evolution of particular siliceous structures of their scales. Molecular data for six species were acquired for the first time, enabling a successful assessment of their phylogenetic relationships with the other representatives of the genus. On the basis of molecular data, the genus Mallomonas can be divided in two evolutionary lineages and this division is also reflected morphologically (with only a few exceptions) through presence or absence of a <b>V-rib</b> structure. Fine ornamentation of siliceous scales is species-specific and interestingly, the overall differences in morphology of siliceous scales are mostly reflecting phylogenetic relationships among representatives of the genus. In this context, morphological species concept of Mallomonas seems to be justified. Morphologically-based sections of the genus are often paraphyletic, because small sections (frequently containing only single species) tend to be nested within particular larger sections. The main reason for this discrepancy is accelerated morphological [...] ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe pulleys of an {{automotive}} {{front engine}} accessory drive are driven in rotation by a poly-V belt itself {{driven by the}} crankshaft pulley. This driving pulley is often used as a torsional vibration damper (TVD) for the crankshaft. Three elements compose the pulley: the hub, a rubber ring and an inertia steel ring with <b>v-ribs</b> on its outer diameter. Although the crankshaft torsional vibrations are dampen, they are transmitted to the belt transmission and therefore to the driven accessories. Hence, recent developments have conducted to add a decoupling function to these pulleys. The decoupling is realized by an other rubber ring. The TVD pulley components are designed in order to dampen crankshaft vibrations over a given frequency range, i. e. stiffness and damping characteristics are determined for the rubber ring. These expected characteristics have to be checked after manufacturing for product certification but also to give some real measured data input for simulation models. An experimental characterization method is presented and discussed for {{the determination of the}} stiffness and damping coefficients of the rubber rings used in such pulley.

40|$|The {{tools of}} {{geometric}} morphometrics (GM) {{were used to}} examine morphological variation of silica-scales in four Mallomonas species (M. calceolus, M. kalinae, M. flora and M. striata). Relative warps analysis revealed {{the main trends in}} morphological variation {{to be associated with the}} width, length and shape of the <b>V-rib,</b> while the proximal border region was found to be more stable. Almost all of the scales investigated were successfully differentiated and assigned to an individual species by means of multivariate statistics, the classification experiments were done in a pairwise manner. Geometric morphometric based analyses did not corroborate the classification of these species into traditionally defined sections. M. kalinae and M. striata were found to be the most similar, although they are classified into different sections of the genus, while M. kalinae and M. calceolus that are both traditionally classified as belonging to the section Papillosae, proved to be the most dissimilar species pair. The genus Mallomonas (Synurophyceae, Stramenopila) comprises unicellular freshwater flagellates. One of the main distinctive features of this genus is the presence of bilaterally symmetric and heteropolar scales forming a scale case around the cell. The ultrastructure of silica scales and bristles is crucial for species determination, and the taxonomy of Mallomonas is based almost exclusively on it. Since the middle of the 20 th century, about 150 species and infraspecific taxa have been described. Scale morphology is species-specific and a single scale will usually suffice for making a species determination. Taxa with narrow ecolo-gical optimum may be considered valuable bioindicators of both recent and historical environments (Siver 1995, Smo...|$|R
