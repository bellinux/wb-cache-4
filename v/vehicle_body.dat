5|$|In 1852, James Alexander Holden {{emigrated to}} South Australia from Walsall, England and in 1856 {{established}} J.A. Holden & Co, a saddlery business in Adelaide. In 1885, German-born H. A. Frost joined the {{business as a}} junior partner and J.A. Holden & Co became Holden & Frost Ltd. Edward Holden, James' grandson, joined the firm in 1905 {{with an interest in}} automobiles. From there, the firm evolved through various partnerships and, in 1908, Holden & Frost moved into the business of minor repairs to car upholstery. The company began to produce complete motorcycle sidecar bodies in 1913, and Edward experimented with fitting bodies to different types of carriages. After 1917, wartime trade restrictions led the company to start full-scale production of <b>vehicle</b> <b>body</b> shells. J.A. Holden founded a new company in 1919, Holden's Motor Body Builders Ltd (HMBB) specialising in car bodies and using a facility on King William Street in Adelaide.|$|E
5|$|With {{the design}} process complete, four street-ready race cars were constructed, with each vehicle {{possessing}} 65 panels and costing $250,000 to build. Two of the four cars were specialized versions. One version was the flap version, which had hydraulics and flaps to detail the close-up shots where the vehicle propelled itself through the air. The other version was the jet version, in which an actual jet engine was mounted onto the vehicle, fueled by six propane tanks. The visibility inside the vehicle was poor, so monitors were connected to cameras on the <b>vehicle</b> <b>body.</b> The professional drivers for the Tumblers practiced driving the vehicles for six months before they drove {{on the streets of}} Chicago for the film's scenes.|$|E

25|$|The <b>vehicle</b> <b>body</b> was {{extended}} upward and generally enlarged {{to form a}} van-like structure holding 31 passengers. Each car had three sets of automated doors, entering into a set of facing seats. This divided the internal area into sections; {{it was not possible}} to walk the length of the vehicle, nor were there provisions for standing. They were normally operated in trains of two or four cars.|$|E
25|$|In 1930 {{cars had}} {{dashboards}} of rigid metal, non-collapsible steering columns, and protruding knobs, buttons, and levers. Without seat belts, passengers in a frontal collision could be hurled against {{the interior of}} the automobile or through the windshield. The <b>vehicle</b> <b>body</b> itself was rigid, and impact forces were transmitted directly to the vehicle occupants. As late as the 1950s, car manufacturers were on public record as saying that vehicle accidents simply could not be made survivable because the forces in a crash were too great.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of dual carriageway roads now have barriers. Some are heavy concrete obstructions which can bounce a vehicle {{back into the}} path of other traffic; others are made from steel ropes mounted on moderately weak posts, where the rope cuts into the <b>vehicle</b> <b>body</b> to slow the vehicle while keeping it against the barrier until it has stopped. Often on urban dual carriageways where the road has been converted from a four-lane single carriageway the central reservation will not be substantial: often just a small steel divider to save space.|$|E
25|$|U.S. data on nonfatal work-related crashes are limited. Through {{a sample}} survey of employers, the Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses (SOII), BLS generates annual {{estimates}} of nonfatal occupational injuries by {{variables such as}} industry, source of injury (e.g., a motor <b>vehicle),</b> <b>body</b> part(s) injured, age, and median lost work days. SOII provides little incident-level detail that can help to guide MVC prevention initiatives. Further, because SOII does not cover certain worker groups such as agricultural workers on farms with fewer than 11 employees and the self-employed, it undoubtedly underestimates the number of work-related MVCs and other events.|$|E

25|$|After {{the boom}} in orders during the First World War, the lack of new work in peacetime caused severe {{financial}} problems and in August 1920, 68.5% of the company's shares were acquired by nearby Crossley Motors which had an urgent need for more factory space for automotive <b>vehicle</b> <b>body</b> building. In 1924, the Company left Alexandra Park Aerodrome in south Manchester where test flying had taken place during the period since 1918 and the site {{was taken over by}} a mixture of recreation and housing development. A rural site to the south of the growing city was found at New Hall Farm, Woodford in Cheshire, which continued to serve aviation builders BAE Systems until March 2011, (the site has now been earmarked for a mixed use development). In 1928, Crossley Motors sold AVRO to Armstrong Siddeley Holdings Ltd. In 1928, A.V.Roe resigned from the company he had founded and formed the Saunders-Roe company that after World War II developed several radical designs for combat jets, and, eventually, a range of powerful hovercraft. In 1935, Avro became a subsidiary of Hawker Siddeley.|$|E
25|$|In addition, NIOSH {{researchers}} are pursuing {{a line of}} research related to ambulance safety. In the U.S., an ambulance {{may be one of}} a number of <b>vehicle</b> <b>body</b> types, and there are no comprehensive safety standards that specify requirements for safety and crashworthiness. Of special concern is the safety of workers in the ambulance patient compartment, where work tasks are not compatible with the use of occupant restraints and where equipment and interior layout put workers at high risk of injury in the event of a crash. Sled and crash tests of ambulances conducted by NIOSH and partners show that retrofitting patient compartments with redesigned occupant restraints will allow EMS workers the level of mobility needed to care for patients and at the same time afford greater protection from injury than standard lap belts. NIOSH work in this area has led to development of new voluntary standards for crash-testing of ambulances. The research program has now expanded to address the full range of human-factors concerns about worker safety in ambulance patient compartment, with a number of other manufacturing standards and testing standards in progress.|$|E
