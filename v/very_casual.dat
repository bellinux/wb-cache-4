Five buttons are unusual and are a modern fashion innovation. The number of buttons is primarily a function of the formality of the suit; a <b>very</b> <b>casual</b> summer sports jacket might traditionally (1930s) have had only one button, while tweed suits {{typically have}} three and city suits four. In the 1970s, two buttons were seen on some city suits. Today, four buttons are common on most business suits and even casual suits.|$|E

25|$|The kitchen area {{reflects}} {{the original design}} concept; it includes separate stations for baking and pastries and was never reduced when the original project was downsized. High quality kitchen appliances were installed so the hotel could compete with fine dining establishments, and the facility was specifically constructed to handle special events and functions. The wood beames {{in the dining room}} are actually hollow, with steel beams going through them for fire safety reasons. Every detail was carefully thought out. The alcove window {{at the end of the}} room perfectly framed Yosemite Falls when the hotel was completed. The dining room is 130 feet long and 51 feet wide, with a 34-foot ceiling supported with rock columns creating a cathedral like atmosphere. While the dress code for the park is usually <b>very</b> <b>casual,</b> the Ahwahnee Dining Room used to require a jacket for men, but it later relaxed that tradition. Now collared shirts for men are allowed and women may wear either a dress or slacks and a blouse.|$|E
2500|$|The use {{of pattern}} and colour is also significant. [...] Originally, in the Edwardian era, when the modern shirt emerged, all shirts were white. [...] Gradually more colours were introduced, {{including}} blue, {{the most popular}} colour, particularly in lighter shades such as Wedgwood. A full range of colours is now worn, from pink to yellow. Less traditional shirts are also made with darker colours, even black, and bright or lighter colours and prints for <b>very</b> <b>casual</b> wear were popularised after the War by light holiday clothes such as Hawaiian shirts.|$|E
2500|$|In the US, {{ready-to-wear}} {{sizes of}} dress shirts traditionally consist of two numbers [...] such as 15½34, {{meaning that the}} shirt has a neck [...] in girth (measured from centre of top button to centre of corresponding buttonhole) and a sleeve [...] long (measured from midpoint of the back and shoulders to the wrist). However, {{to reduce the number}} of sizes needed to be manufactured and stocked, an average sleeve length is sometimes given in the form 15½34/35 (indicating a neck [...] in girth and a [...] sleeve). Since the cuff frequently features two buttons, the cuff diameter can be reduced so that the cuff does not come down over the hand, allowing the shirt to fit the shorter length. Since the sleeve and neck size do not take into account waist size, some shirts are cut wide to accommodate large belly sizes. Shirts cut for flat stomachs are usually labeled, [...] "fitted", [...] "tailored fit" [...] "athletic fit" [...] or [...] "trim fit". The terms for fuller cut shirts are more varied ("Traditional", [...] "Regular" [...] etc.) and are sometimes explained on a shirt maker's website. Additionally, [...] "Portly" [...] or [...] "Big" [...] are often used for neck sizes of [...] or more. <b>Very</b> <b>casual</b> button-front shirts are often sized as small, medium, large, and so on.

2500|$|In 2002, J. C. C. Mays {{pointed out}} that [...] "Coleridge's {{claim to be a}} great poet lies in the {{continued}} pursuit of the consequences of 'The Ancient Mariner,' 'Christabel' and 'Kubla Khan' on several levels." [...] Adam Sisman, in 2006, questioned the nature of the poem itself: [...] "No one even knows whether it is complete; Coleridge describes it as a 'fragment,' but there is a case for doubting this. Maybe it is not a poem at all. Hazlitt called it 'a musical composition' ... Though literary detectives have uncovered some of its sources, its remains difficult to say what the poem is about." [...] In describing the merits of the poem and its fragmentary state, he claimed, [...] "The poem stands for itself: beautiful, sensuous and enigmatic." [...] During the same year, Jack Stillinger claimed that [...] "Coleridge wrote only a few poems of the first rank – perhaps no more than a dozen, all told – and he seems to have taken a <b>very</b> <b>casual</b> attitude toward them ... he kept 'Kubla Khan' in manuscript for nearly twenty years before offering it to the public 'rather as a psychological curiosity, than on the grounds of any supposed poetic merits'". Harold Bloom, in 2010, argued that Coleridge wrote two kinds of poems and that [...] "The daemonic group, necessarily more famous, is the triad of The Ancient Mariner, Christabel, and 'Kubla Khan.'" [...] He goes on to explain the [...] "daemonic": [...] "Opium was the avenging daemon or alastor of Coleridge's life, his dark or fallen angel, his experiential acquaintance with Milton's Satan. Opium was for him what wandering and moral tale-telling became for the Mariner – the personal shape of repetition compulsion. The lust for paradise in 'Kubla Khan,' Geraldine's lust for Christabel – these are manifestations of Coleridge's revisionary daemonization of Milton, these are Coleridge's countersublime. Poetic genius, the genial spirit itself, Coleridge must see as daemonic when it is his own rather than when it is Milton's." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{first issue}} also {{generated}} criticism {{in using the}} obscure, and tepidly reviewed, PlayStation 2 game Stretch Panic as its cover feature. The writers had scored an exclusive preview of the game, and the developer, Treasure, was held on a high throne by the hardcore gaming community for a string of high-quality, arcade style games (i.e.: Gunstar Heroes & Radiant Silvergun), so the cover was chosen in order to differentiate the magazine from its competitors and attract the niche market segment. Since the general gaming community {{had never heard of}} the game, nor had any interest in finding out about it, the magazine attracted <b>very</b> few <b>casual</b> readers when displayed on store shelves. This {{was one of the main}} problems that led to the magazine's demise.|$|R

50|$|Another {{point of}} dissension of dancehall from reggae, and from its non-western roots in Jamaica, {{is on the}} focus on materialism. Dancehall has also became popular in regions such as Ghana and Panama. Prominent males in the dancehall scene are {{expected}} to dress in <b>very</b> expensive <b>casual</b> wear, indicative of European urban styling and high fashion that suggest wealth and status. Since the late 1990s, males in the dancehall culture have rivalled their female counterparts to look fashioned and styled. The female dancehall divas are all scantily clad, or dressed in spandex outfits that accentuate more than cover one's nakedness. In the documentary It's All About Dancing, prominent dancehall artist Beenie Man argues that one {{could be the best}} DJ or the smoothest dancer, but if one wears clothing that reflects the economic realities {{of the majority of the}} partygoers, one will be ignored.|$|R

6000|$|The first {{fact that}} one realises about Shaw (independent of all one has read and often contradicting it) is his voice. Primarily it {{is the voice of}} an Irishman, and then {{something}} of the voice of a musician. It possibly explains much of his career; a man may be permitted to say so many impudent things with so pleasant an intonation. But the voice is not only Irish and agreeable, it is also frank and as it were inviting conference. This goes with a style and gesture which {{can only be described as}} at once <b>very</b> <b>casual</b> and very emphatic. He assumes that bodily supremacy which goes with oratory, but he assumes it with almost ostentatious carelessness; he throws back the head, but loosely and laughingly. He is at once swaggering and yet shrugging his shoulders, as if to drop from them the mantle of the orator which he has confidently assumed. Lastly, no man ever used voice or gesture better for the purpose of expressing certainty; no man can say [...] "I tell Mr. Jones he is totally wrong" [...] with more air of unforced and even casual conviction.|$|E
60|$|I {{think he}} {{believed}} me, and his believing me made this unexpected respite very welcome to him. There was no knowing {{what might happen}} in the interval, and he passed {{a large part of}} it in looking for an issue. And yet, at the same time, he kept up the usual forms with the girl whom in his heart he had renounced. I was told more than once (for I had lost sight of the pair during the summer and autumn) that these forms were at times <b>very</b> <b>casual,</b> that he neglected Miss Bernardstone most flagrantly, and had quite resumed his old intimacy with Lady Vandeleur. I don't exactly know what was meant by this, for she spent {{the first three months of}} her widowhood in complete seclusion, in her own old house in Norfolk, where he certainly was not staying with her. I believe he stayed some time, for the partridge shooting, at a place a few miles off. It came to my ears that if Miss Bernardstone did n't take the hint it was because she was determined to stick to him through thick and thin. She never offered to let him off, and I was sure she never would; but I was equally sure that, strange as it may appear, he had not ceased to be nice to her. I have never exactly understood why he didn't hate her, and I am convinced that he was not a comedian in his conduct to her,--he was only a good fellow. I have spoken of the satisfaction that Sir Edmund took in his daughter-in-law that was to be; he delighted in looking at her, longed for her when she was out of his sight, and had her, with her mother, staying with him in the country for weeks together. If Ambrose was not so constantly at her side as he might have been, this deficiency was covered by his father's devotion to her, by her appearance of being already one of the family. Mr. Tester was away as he might be away if they were already married.|$|E

2500|$|Ranch (also known as; American ranch, California ranch, rambler, or rancher) is a {{domestic}} architectural style {{originating in the}} United States.

The house style [...] fused modernist ideas and styles with notions of the American Western period of wide open spaces to create a <b>very</b> informal and <b>casual</b> living style. While the original style of the ranch was very informal and basic in design, starting around the early 1960s, many ranch homes constructed in the United States (particularly in the Sun Belt region) were increasingly built with more dramatic features like varying roof lines, cathedral ceilings, sunken living rooms, and extensive landscaping and grounds.|$|R

60|$|There was no {{candle in}} any window, {{and when she}} pushed in {{and stood in the}} hall, {{listening}} a moment, her step awakened no answering sound. Her heart failed her; Verena's staying out in a boat from ten o'clock in the morning till nightfall was too unnatural, and she gave a cry, as she rushed into the low, dim parlour (darkened on one side, at that hour, by the wide-armed foliage, and on the other by the veranda and trellis), which expressed only a wild personal passion, a desire to take her friend in her arms again on any terms, even the most cruel to herself. The next moment she started back, with another and a different exclamation, for Verena was in the room, motionless, in a corner--the first place in which she had seated herself on re-entering the house--looking at her with a silent face which seemed strange, unnatural, in the dusk. Olive stopped short, and for a minute the two women remained as they were, gazing at each other in the dimness. After that, too, Olive still said nothing; she only went to Verena and sat down beside her. She didn't {{know what to make of}} her manner; she had never been like that before. She was unwilling to speak; she seemed crushed and humbled. This was almost the worst--if anything could be worse than what had gone before; and Olive took her hand with an irresistible impulse of compassion and assurance. From the way it lay in her own she guessed her whole feeling--saw it was a kind of shame, shame for her weakness, her swift surrender, her insane gyration, in the morning. Verena expressed it by no protest and no explanation; she appeared not even to wish to hear the sound of her own voice. Her silence itself was an appeal--an appeal to Olive to ask no questions (she could trust her to inflict no spoken reproach); only to wait till she could lift up her head again. Olive understood, or thought she understood, and the woefulness of it all only seemed the deeper. She would just sit there and hold her hand; that was all she could do; they were beyond each other's help in any other way now. Verena leaned her head back and closed her eyes, and for an hour, as nightfall settled in the room, neither of the young women spoke. Distinctly, it was a kind of shame. After a while the parlour-maid, <b>very</b> <b>casual,</b> in the manner of the servants at Marmion, appeared on the threshold with a lamp; but Olive motioned her frantically away. She wished to keep the darkness. It was a kind of shame.|$|E
6000|$|A {{little more}} than an hour after this he stood in the parlour of Doctor Tarrant's {{suburban}} residence, in Monadnoc Place. He had induced a juvenile maid-servant, by an appeal somewhat impassioned, to let the ladies know that he was there; and she had returned, after a long absence, to say that Miss Tarrant would come down to him in a little while. He possessed himself, according to his wont, of the nearest book (it lay on the table, with an old magazine and a little japanned tray containing Tarrant's professional cards--his denomination as a mesmeric healer), and spent ten minutes in turning it over. It was a biography of Mrs. Ada T. P. Foat, the celebrated trance-lecturer, and was embellished by a portrait representing the lady with a surprised expression and innumerable ringlets. Ransom said to himself, after reading a few pages, that much ridicule had been cast upon Southern literature; but if that was a fair specimen of Northern!--and he threw it back upon the table with a gesture almost as contemptuous as if he had not known perfectly, after so long a residence in the North, that it was not, while he wondered whether this was the sort of thing Miss Tarrant had been brought up on. There was no other book to be seen, and he remembered to have read the magazine; so there was finally nothing for him, as the occupants of the house failed still to appear, but to stare before him, into the bright, bare, common little room, which was so hot that he wished to open a window, and of which an ugly, undraped cross-light seemed to have taken upon itself to reveal the poverty. Ransom, as I have mentioned, had not a high standard of comfort and noticed little, usually, how people's houses were furnished--it was only when they were very pretty that he observed; but what he saw while he waited at Doctor Tarrant's made him say to himself that it was no wonder Verena liked better to live with Olive Chancellor. He even began to wonder whether it were for the sake of that superior softness she had cultivated Miss Chancellor's favour, and whether Mrs. Luna had been right about her being mercenary and insincere. So many minutes elapsed before she appeared that he had time to remember he really knew nothing to the contrary, as well as to consider the oddity (so great when one did consider it) of his coming out to Cambridge to see her, when he had only a few hours in Boston to spare, {{a year and a half}} after she had given him her <b>very</b> <b>casual</b> invitation. She had not refused to receive him, at any rate; she was free to, if it didn't please her. And not only this, but she was apparently making herself fine in his honour, inasmuch as he heard a rapid footstep move to and fro above his head, and even, through the slightness which in Monadnoc Place did service for an upper floor, the sound of drawers and presses opened and closed. Some one was [...] "flying round," [...] as they said in Mississippi. At last the stairs creaked under a light tread, and the next moment a brilliant person came into the room.|$|E
6000|$|It {{happened}} that {{shortly after his}} arrival, riding an unruly horse which Euphemia had with shy admiration watched him mount in the castle-yard, he was thrown with a violence which, without disparaging his skill, made him for a fortnight an interesting invalid lounging in the library with a bandaged knee. To beguile his confinement the accomplished young stranger was repeatedly induced to sing for him, which she did with a small natural tremor that might have passed for the finish of vocal art. He never overwhelmed her with compliments, but he listened with unfailing attention, remembered all her melodies and would sit humming them to himself. While his imprisonment lasted indeed he passed hours in her company, making her feel not unlike some unfriended artist who has suddenly gained the opportunity to devote a fortnight {{to the study of}} a great model. Euphemia studied with noiseless diligence what she supposed to be the [...] "character" [...] of M. de Mauves, and the more she looked the more fine lights and shades she seemed to behold in this masterpiece of nature. M. de Mauves's character indeed, whether from a sense of being so generously and intensely taken for granted, or for reasons which bid graceful defiance to analysis, had never been so much on show, even to the <b>very</b> <b>casual</b> critic lodged, as might be said, in an out-of-the-way corner of it; it seemed really to reflect the purity of Euphemia's pious opinion. There had been nothing especially to admire in the state of mind in which he left Paris--a settled resolve to marry a young person whose charms might or might not justify his sister's account of them, but who was mistress, at the worst, of a couple of hundred thousand francs a year. He had not counted out sentiment--if she pleased him so much the better; but he had left a meagre margin for it and would hardly have admitted that so excellent a match could be improved by it. He was a robust and serene sceptic, and it was a singular fate for a man who believed in nothing to be so tenderly believed in. What his original faith had been he could hardly have told you, for as he came back to his childhood's home to mend his fortunes by pretending to fall in love he was a thoroughly perverse creature and overlaid with more corruptions than a summer day's questioning of his conscience would have put to flight. Ten years' pursuit of pleasure, which a bureau full of unpaid bills was all he had to show for, had pretty well stifled the natural lad whose violent will and generous temper might have been shaped by a different pressure to some such showing as would have justified a romantic faith. So should he have exhaled the natural fragrance of a late-blooming flower of hereditary honour. His violence indeed had been subdued and he had learned to be irreproachably polite; but he had lost the fineness of his generosity, and his politeness, which in the long run society paid for, was hardly more than a form of luxurious egotism, like his fondness for ciphered pocket-handkerchiefs, lavender gloves and other fopperies by which shopkeepers remained out of pocket. In after-years he was terribly polite to his wife. He had formed himself, as the phrase was, and the form prescribed to him by the society into which his birth and his tastes had introduced him was marked by some peculiar features. That which mainly concerns us is its classification of the fairer half of humanity as objects not essentially different--say from those very lavender gloves that are soiled in an evening and thrown away. To do M. de Mauves justice, he had in the course of time encountered in the feminine character such plentiful evidence of its pliant softness and fine adjustability that idealism naturally seemed to him a losing game.|$|E

We also show that this model allows for agent heterogeneity in languages, applications and architectures. Then, we illustrate this model by appying it to a classic market-like organization. 1 Introduction Whereas organization has been presented as a major issue of multi-agent systems, very few works have attempted to develop model of such systems using organizational approaches.
