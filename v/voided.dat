40|$|We {{study the}} {{possible}} magnetization of cosmic <b>voids</b> by <b>void</b> galaxies. Recently, observations revealed isolated starforming galaxies within the <b>voids.</b> Furthermore, a major {{fraction of a}} <b>voids</b> volume {{is expected to be}} filled with magnetic fields of a minimum strength of about $ 10 ^{- 15 }$ G on Mpc scales. We estimate the transport of magnetic energy by cosmic rays (CR) from the <b>void</b> galaxies into the <b>voids.</b> We assume that CRs and winds are able to leave small isolated <b>void</b> galaxies shortly after they assembled, and then propagate within the <b>voids.</b> For a typical <b>void,</b> we estimate the magnetic field strength and volume filling factor depending on its <b>void</b> galaxy population and possible contributions of strong active galactic nuclei (AGN) which border the <b>voids.</b> We argue that the lower limit on the <b>void</b> magnetic field can be recovered, if {{a small fraction of the}} magnetic energy contained in the <b>void</b> galaxies or <b>void</b> bordering AGNs is distributed within the <b>voids.</b> Comment: 5 pages, 2 figures, accepted to MNRAS Letters after moderate revisio...|$|R
40|$|Using a <b>void</b> catalog {{from the}} SDSS survey, we present the first {{measurements}} of <b>void</b> clustering {{and the corresponding}} <b>void</b> bias. Over the range 30 - 200 Mpc/h the <b>void</b> auto-correlation is detected at 5 -sigma significance for <b>voids</b> of radius 15 - 20 Mpc/h. We also measure the void-galaxy cross-correlation at higher signal-to-noise and compare the inferred <b>void</b> bias with the autocorrelation results. <b>Void</b> bias is constant with scale for <b>voids</b> of a given size, but its value falls from 5. 6 +/- 1. 0 to below zero as the <b>void</b> radius increases from 15 to 30 Mpc/h. The comparison of our measurements with carefully matched galaxy mock catalogs, with no free parameters related to the <b>voids,</b> shows that model predictions can be reliably made for <b>void</b> correlations. We study the dependence of <b>void</b> bias on tracer density and <b>void</b> size {{with a view to}} future applications.

Featured {{in the center of the}} green stripe was the Zulfiqar, the legendary Islamic sword of Ali, with the blade in white and the hilt multicolored. The red and yellow stripes each contained five equidistant symbols, whose order was alternated between each stripe. These symbols were divided into two categories: one red six-sided star <b>voided</b> with a disk of a different color in the center—either a red star and green disk or a white star and blue disk—, and a large disk <b>voided</b> in its lower right by a small disk of different color, with the combination being either a small red disk within a larger blue disk or a small yellow disk within a larger red disk. The first yellow stripe contains three red stars and two blue disks. The second stripe, red in color, contains three green disksand two white stars. The third stripe (second yellow one) is identical to the first, with the exception that the star in its center is white, while the fourth stripe (second white one) is identical to the second stripe.|$|E

5|$|By the {{outbreak}} of World War I in 1914, Bayer was facing competition in all its major markets from local ASA producers {{as well as other}} German drug firms (particularly Heyden and Hoechst). The British market was immediately closed to the German companies, but British manufacturing could not meet the demand—especially with phenol supplies, necessary for ASA synthesis, largely being used for explosives manufacture. On 5 February 1915, Bayer's UK trademarks were <b>voided,</b> so that any company could use the term aspirin. The Australian market was taken over by Aspro, after the makers of Nicholas-Aspirin lost a short-lived exclusive right to the aspirin name there. In the United States, Bayer was still under German control—though the war disrupted the links between the American Bayer plant and the German Bayer headquarters—but phenol shortage threatened to reduce aspirin production to a trickle, and imports across the Atlantic Ocean were blocked by the Royal Navy.|$|E

5|$|In Europe, formal futures markets {{appeared}} in the Dutch Republic during the 17th century. Among the most notable centered on the tulip market, {{at the height of}} Tulipmania. At the peak of tulip mania, in February 1637, some single tulip bulbs sold for more than 10 times the annual income of a skilled craftsworker. Research is difficult because of the limited economic data from the 1630s—much of which come from biased and very speculative sources. Some modern economists have proposed rational explanations, rather than a speculative mania, for the rise and fall in prices. For example, other flowers, such as the hyacinth, also had high initial prices {{at the time of their}} introduction, which immediately fell. The high asset prices may also have been driven by expectations of a parliamentary decree that contracts could be <b>voided</b> for a small cost—thus lowering the risk to buyers.|$|E

30|$|<b>Voids</b> {{are crucial}} point defects that are {{inevitable}} during fabrication and deformation of materials. Nanocrystals with <b>voids</b> have many unique properties, including lattice orientation sensitivity [6 – 8], size-dependent yielding stresses [6, 9, 10], <b>void</b> volume fraction-dependent elastic modulus [11], and <b>void</b> shape effect on stress concentration [11]. Considerable {{efforts have been}} devoted to investigate the nucleation, growth, and coalescence of <b>voids.</b> Specifically, <b>void</b> growth has been proven to be governed by a dislocation-emission-based mechanism [12]. It is found that dislocation loops carrying outward flux of matters are nucleated at <b>void</b> surfaces [9, 13]. Simulations performed by Seppala et al. are focused on <b>void</b> coalescence, involving both single and double <b>voids</b> cases [14]. It is revealed that the onset of <b>void</b> coalescence occurs when the intervoid ligament distance reaches approximately one <b>void</b> radius. However, the deformation mechanisms associated with <b>voids</b> in nanostructured crystals with internal boundaries, especially coherent TBs, are yet to be understood.|$|R
40|$|Nucleation of <b>voids</b> via the {{stochastic}} {{accumulation of}} vacancies is considered when one-dimensionally migrating self-interstitials are present. A system instability signaling a non-equilibrium phase transition {{is found to}} occur when the mean free path of the one-dimensionally moving self-interstitials becomes comparable with the average distance between the <b>voids</b> at a sufficiently high void-number density. At this point, due to the exponential dependence of <b>void</b> nucleation probability on the net vacancy flux, the nucleation of <b>voids</b> is much more favored at the <b>void</b> lattice positions. At the same time, <b>voids</b> initially nucleated at positions where neighboring <b>voids</b> are non-aligned will shrink away. The shrinkage of non-aligned <b>voids</b> is caused entirely by the stochastic fluctuations in point-defect fluxes received by the <b>voids.</b> These two processes leave the aligned <b>voids</b> to form a regular lattice. The formation of the <b>void</b> lattice in this way can be accomplished at a <b>void</b> swelling of below 1 %, in agreement with experimental observation.
