5|$|Austin Dickinson was {{the lead}} singer in metalcore band Rise to Remain until their {{break-up}} in 2015, at which point he formed a new group, As Lions. Griffin Dickinson, who previously worked as a stage carpenter for Iron Maiden during their tours, is the vocalist in melodic hardcore band SHVPES (formerly known as Cytota). Dickinson's cousin, Rob Dickinson, {{was the lead}} singer of British alternative rock band Catherine Wheel and founded Singer <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Design</b> who specialise in upgrading classic Porsche 911s.|$|E
5|$|Sir Clive Sinclair's {{interest}} in the possibilities of electric vehicles originated in the late 1950s during a holiday job for the electronics company Solatron. Fifteen years later, in the early 1970s, he {{was the head of}} his own successful electronics company, Sinclair Radionics, based in St Ives in Cambridgeshire. He tasked one of his employees, Chris Curry – later a co-founder of Acorn Computers – to carry out some preliminary research into electric <b>vehicle</b> <b>design.</b>|$|E

25|$|Williams Advanced Engineering {{announced}} in August 2017 a collaboration with Singer <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Design.</b> The first fruit {{of this work}} is a modified, naturally aspirated, air-cooled, flat-six Porsche 911 engine with a 4.0L capacity, four-valves per cylinder and four cam-shafts, rated at 500HP.|$|E
25|$|Stout's other {{innovations}} {{included the}} Skycar, an automobile/airplane hybrid and a Pullman Railplane and Club Car. He {{is also known}} as the originator of prefab housing and the sliding car seat. All of these innovations were modern in design, incorporating many features new in both appearance and function, features not yet available in <b>vehicle</b> <b>design.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Hawk {{prototype}} {{was named}} Best New Design for 1982 at Sun 'n Fun in March 1982. At the EAA Convention in Oshkosh, Wisconsin {{that same year}} the Hawk was named Outstanding New Design and also Reserve Grand Champion. At Oshkosh 1983, the Hawk won the Dupont Kevlar Air Recreational <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Design</b> Competition against more than 126 other aircraft designs in the competition.|$|E
50|$|Lifting {{bodies were}} {{wingless}} <b>vehicles</b> <b>designed</b> to generate lift and aerodynamic stability from {{the shape of}} their bodies. They were flown at Dryden to study and validate the concept of safely maneuvering and landing a low lift-over-drag <b>vehicle</b> <b>designed</b> for reentry from space.

25|$|The {{application}} of new parts and concepts onto the <b>vehicle</b> <b>design</b> {{are easier to}} include when in the design stage of a vehicle, rather than in aftermarket (automotive) parts, however, the fabrication of these parts assists in the streamlining of the vehicle and can help greatly reduce the drag of the vehicle. Most vehicles with very low drag coefficients, such as race cars and high efficiency concept cars, apply these ideas to their design.|$|E
25|$|Aerodynamics were a {{focus of}} the <b>vehicle</b> <b>design.</b> The flat plastic {{undertray}} is used for ground effect aerodynamics and the rear bumper - {{in conjunction with the}} aerodynamically shaped muffler - forms a diffuser to reduce rear lift. The front end reportedly induces a high-pressure zone just forward of the front wheels to increase front-wheel traction. The Z1 has a drag coefficient of 0.36Cd with the top up or 0.43Cd with it down.|$|E
25|$|Witnessing {{the events}} of the war, U.S. Army {{observers}} realized that they would need a self-propelled artillery vehicle with sufficient firepower to support armored operations. Lessons learned with half-tracks (such as the T19 Howitzer Motor Carriage (HMC) with a 105mm howitzer on the M3 Half-track chassis) also showed that this vehicle would have to be armored and fully tracked. It was decided to use the M3 Lee chassis as the basis for this new <b>vehicle</b> <b>design,</b> which was designated T32.|$|E

25|$|BMT-72 – Ukrainian T-72 upgrade. The unique {{compact design}} of the Ukrainian-developed BMT-72 power pack, based on that of the T-84, made it {{possible}} not only to considerably increase the power capabilities of the vehicle, but also to introduce into the <b>vehicle</b> <b>design</b> a troop compartment. The troop compartment is located between the fighting compartment and the power pack compartment. In the troop compartment roof there {{is a set of}} three hatches in slightly raised portion of the hull roof behind turret that allow the troops to get in or dismount the vehicle. There are also steps on the end of each catwalk at rear of vehicle. The main visual difference between BMT-72 and T-72 is a seventh pair of roadwheels.|$|E
25|$|BMP-3F – Specially {{designed}} for operations at sea, with improved seaworthiness and buoyancy, capability to move afloat at sea state 3 and fire with the required accuracy at sea state 2. Compared {{to the basic}} model, the <b>vehicle</b> <b>design</b> features changes increasing floatability and vehicle stability: the self-entrenching equipment is omitted, a lightweight anti-surge vane and an air intake tube are introduced; the BMP-3F turret is also protected by anti-surge vanes. Water jet propellers develop a speed of 10km/h when afloat. The BMP-3F design allows the vehicle to come ashore under rough sea conditions and to tow the same-type vehicle. A new main sight, the SOZH, which has an integrated laser range finder and an ATGM guidance channel, is installed. This version can endure continuous amphibious operation for seven hours with the running engine.|$|E
25|$|Aerodynamics is {{important}} {{in a number of}} applications other than aerospace engineering. It is a significant factor in any type of <b>vehicle</b> <b>design,</b> including automobiles. It {{is important}} in the prediction of forces and moments acting on sailing vessels. It is used in the design of mechanical components such as hard drive heads. Structural engineers also use aerodynamics, and particularly aeroelasticity, to calculate wind loads in the design of large buildings and bridges. Urban aerodynamics seeks to help town planners and designers improve comfort in outdoor spaces, create urban microclimates and reduce the effects of urban pollution. The field of environmental aerodynamics describes the ways atmospheric circulation and flight mechanics affect ecosystems. The aerodynamics of internal passages {{is important in}} heating/ventilation, gas piping, and in automotive engines where detailed flow patterns strongly affect the performance of the engine.|$|E

25|$|As {{with most}} European standards, {{compliance}} by the member {{countries of the}} European Union is purely voluntary, and to be determined {{at the level of}} the member country, usually by means of legislation, or by its own standards organization. To illustrate, this standard, which has been accepted by the United Kingdom, is known locally as BS EN 1789:2007, with the 'BS' referring to British Standards. As a result, the adoption of this standard has varied considerably from one country to another. Most countries, for example, have adopted the sections dealing with <b>vehicle</b> <b>design</b> and performance, while only a few (the UK, Ireland, and Sweden at this writing), have fully adopted the colour, warning system, and livery schemes for such vehicles. To further complicate matters, some countries have adopted some portion of the visual identity standards, but not all. In the Netherlands, Belgium, and some parts of Germany, the conversion to the basic identifying colour (yellow) is occurring, but the balance of visual identity provisions are not. In addition, some countries which are not currently members of the European Union, such as Norway are adopting some portions of the standards, primarily because few other good standards exist for this purpose, particularly those that reflect European realities. The rate and degree of compliance with the standard is a conscious choice by individual countries, while in others, compliance is a matter of the priorities for the changing of older, country specific, legislation. As previously stated, compliance with the standard is purely voluntary. There are no untoward financial implications to compliance, since only ambulances purchased after ratification of the standard by each country are required to be compliant. There is no mandatory provision for the retrofitting of existing ambulances.|$|E

500|$|Sinclair {{realised}} {{that his}} electric <b>vehicle</b> <b>design</b> {{could easily be}} adapted to meet the new legislation. As the [...] "electrically assisted pedal cycle" [...] category was so new, there were no existing vehicles on the market that would meet the standards prescribed by the new legislation. However, it imposed a number of restrictions that limited the performance of any vehicle that would qualify under the new standards. The maximum legal {{speed of the vehicle}} would be limited to only it could not weigh any more than , including the battery; and its motor could not be rated at any more than 250 watts.|$|E
