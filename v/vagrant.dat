5|$|Matsuno, the game's {{producer}} and director, preferred {{to create a}} new game title from scratch and use design ideas from staff collaborations, rather than reusing popular characters and designs that are found in sequels. <b>Vagrant</b> Story is regarded as a mixture of genres, as it contains elements of role-playing in its battles and platform games when in the field map.

5|$|The populations seen in Final Fantasy Tactics and <b>Vagrant</b> Story are {{essentially}} human. The other intelligent races who appear are hostile or monster-like, such as Goblins or Ogres. Friendly intelligent races appear in later games set in Ivalice, where {{the human race}} is called Humes. Monsters and the like are thought not to exist by the general populace in <b>Vagrant</b> Story, with the monsters in the isolated Leá Monde all stemming from the Dark. The races are sorted by appearance and then according to the alphabetical order.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no direct}} mention of Ivalice in <b>Vagrant</b> Story. However, several {{references}} are made; the Kingdom of Valendia, {{the setting for}} <b>Vagrant</b> Story, shares its name with a continent of Ivalice appearing in Final Fantasy XII. The Kiltia religion, featured in Final Fantasy XII, was {{the religion of the}} ghost town Leá Monde, in which the story takes place. Additionally, a quotation from Arazlam J. Durai, a famous historian of Ivalice who lived 400 years after the War of the Lions (and narrator of the Zodiac Brave Story told in Final Fantasy Tactics), is used {{at the beginning of the}} game, and the descriptions of several items make direct reference to the same story. This would seem to place <b>Vagrant</b> Story latest in the timeline, given its direct references to the events of Final Fantasy Tactics. Matsuno has said that he never intended <b>Vagrant</b> Story to be in the same world as Tactics and Final Fantasy XII, though he noted that Square Enix advertising might not agree.|$|E

5|$|<b>Vagrant</b> Story was {{conceived}} {{during a time}} when most games had made the transition into three-dimensional graphics. Games with real-time polygons were the mainstream, and it was decided for <b>Vagrant</b> Story to follow this trend. Murata, the main programmer, expressed his concerns in working towards a large-scale three-dimensional game for the first time. To avoid discrepancies in the frame rate caused by the large number of polygon models, the modeling team had to select an aspect of each character to focus their attention. Art director Minagawa mentioned that painstaking detail were given to each individual model, even to characters that only appear for a few seconds in the game. The same character models were used throughout the game to create a seamless transition between event cutscenes and actual gameplay. The sound effects of <b>Vagrant</b> Story are credited to Minoru Akao, the game's sound programmer; and Tomohiro Yajima, the sound editor and engineer.|$|E

5|$|After {{the release}} of Red Letter Day, Dewees became a {{full-time}} member as the band began recording their second studio album in Los Angeles in June 1999 with producer Alex Brahl. Before the album went into production, <b>Vagrant</b> Records co-owner John Cohen borrowed money from his parents, who had mortgaged their house in order to fund {{the production of the}} album. On September 21, 1999, the band released Something to Write Home About on <b>Vagrant</b> Records. The album's lyrics reflected the record label strife the band had experienced and their distance between friends and family back home after their move to Los Angeles. Something to Write Home About has been singled out as the band's only 'true' emo album, as the album's aesthetic fit more into the contemporary definition of the genre. Furthermore, the album single-handedly turned the struggling <b>Vagrant</b> label into one of the top indie labels in the country, selling over 140,000 copies after its release. Not only did the album make The Get Up Kids the poster children for emo, but it also launched the genre into a public consciousness broader than the scattered local scenes that had previously embraced it. The album gave <b>Vagrant</b> Records the financial backing to grow and sign a string of other bands. At the same time, the addition of keyboards alienated some fans who thought it moved the band away from the contemporary punk scene's DIY ethic.|$|E
