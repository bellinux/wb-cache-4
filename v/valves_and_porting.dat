40|$|A {{rotating}} spool compressor {{is a novel}} compressor {{technology that}} was recently introduced by Kemp et al. (2008). To accelerate {{the development of the}} technology, a breakdown of the key losses within the device is presented. The losses include flow losses associated with leakage and over/under compression due to <b>valves</b> <b>and</b> <b>porting.</b> Additionally, frictional losses associated with the key sealing elements and moving components are calculated. All of these losses are combined into Pareto of losses for the spool compressor. This Pareto identifies the dynamic sealing elements as key components to continue development on to achieve the best improvement in efficiency...|$|E

5000|$|Once {{the flow}} has stopped, the booster is started, {{and as the}} piston withdraws along the cylinder, {{increasing}} the volume between the cylinder head and the piston crown, the pressure in the cylinder will drop, and gas will flow in from the inlet port. On the return cycle, the piston moves toward the cylinder head, decreasing {{the volume of the}} space and compressing the gas until the pressure is sufficient to overcome the pressure in the outlet line and the opening pressure of the outlet valve. At that point, the gas will flow out of the cylinder via the outlet <b>valve</b> <b>and</b> <b>port.</b>|$|R

50|$|In 1920s, {{superheating}} was trialled on ten engines. Operation {{of these}} superheated engines proved costly despite tests proving savings in coal and water consumption. The principal problem was lubrication of slide valves {{with the higher}} temperatures. This caused wear and cutting of the <b>valve</b> <b>and</b> <b>port</b> faces with resultant steam leaks. The original cast iron valves were replaced with bronze ones but produced little improvement. In 1929, {{it was decided to}} not to superheat any more slide <b>valve</b> engines <b>and</b> those so fitted reverted to saturated steam as boiler renewals became necessary. Eleven engines were loaned to the Commonwealth Railways in 1942 for use on the Central Australia Railway as NMB55-NMB65, returning in 1944.|$|R
30|$|In a port-fuel-injected engine, {{the fuel}} is {{generally}} injected at {{the backside of}} a closed intake valve {{to take advantage of}} the warm <b>valve</b> <b>and</b> <b>port</b> surfaces for vaporization [22, 23, 24]. However, a large part of the injected spray is deposited on the intake manifold surfaces and forms a layer of liquid film on the <b>valve</b> <b>and</b> <b>port</b> surfaces. The film needs to be re-atomized by the shearing airflow as the intake valves open. If these fuel layers are not well atomized, they enter the cylinder as drops and ligaments [25, 26, 27]. These phenomena occur in varying degrees and depend upon the engine design, injector location and engine operation. Previous experiments on the same engine fuelled by gasoline and BU 20 demonstrated that the injector sprayed the fuel towards the plate between the intake <b>valves</b> <b>and</b> on the intake valves stems [28, 29, 30]. The droplet impingement induced fuel layer formation on the intake manifold walls. The fuel layers were drawn by gravity to the <b>valve</b> head <b>and</b> gap, where they remained as film due to surface tension. The stripping of the squeezed fuel film created fuel deposits on the optical window. When the injection occurred in open-valve condition, part of the droplets was carried directly into the combustion chamber by the gas flow. These droplets, sucked in the combustion chamber, stuck on the cylinder walls. In both injection conditions, the fuel deposits on the combustion chamber walls created fuel-rich zones on the piston surfaces that influenced the composition of the mixture charge and, hence, the combustion process. During the normal combustion process, only a fraction of the fuel deposits was completely burned. Thus, more fuel should be injected to reach the selected air-fuel ratio measured at the exhaust [23].|$|R

The reaction was stopped after 10  min. The product was recuperated from the machine after 20  min until the temperature reached 20  °C. The option of cooling is composed of <b>valves</b> <b>and</b> <b>ports</b> necessary to direct a gas of cooling (nitrogen or clean air) towards the containers in the cavity of the system. This option will decrease the temperature from 150 to 50  °C in less than 120  s.|$|R

The steady flow bench is standard equipment, widely used for engine design and development.

50|$|Slide valves were fitted {{underneath}} the cylinders, and were driven directly by eccentrics {{on the leading}} driving axle through Stephenson valve gear. This position had the advantage that, when the regulator was closed and steam pressure shut off, the valves would drop away from the steam ports, thus reducing wear on the <b>valves</b> <b>and</b> <b>port</b> faces. Dean's earlier designs had used slide valves mounted vertically between the cylinders; the new position allowed an increase in cylinder diameter from 17 in to 20 in in the Armstrong Class. The Dukes had 18 in diameter cylinders, possibly due to permanent way weight restrictions and a reduced supply of steam from the Dukes' smaller boilers.|$|R

40|$|The electrohydrostatic {{actuator}} (EHA) is {{an efficient}} type of linear actuator {{commonly found in}} aerospace applications.

50|$|The IOE design {{allows the}} use of larger valves than a sidevalve (or L-head) or {{overhead}} valve engine. Its advantages over the sidevalve/flathead also include a compact combustion chamber, a well-located spark plug, and a cooling effect from the mixture swirl, along with better intake mixture flow.. Disadvantages include a combustion chamber of more complex shape than that of an overhead valve engine, which affects combustion rates and can create hot spots in the piston head, <b>and</b> inferior <b>valve</b> location, which hinders efficient scavenging. Due to the added complications of rocker arms and pushrods, it is also more complex and expensive to make than a sidevalve engine, {{as well as being}} physically larger due to the rocker arms being placed over the cylinder head, and it requires an inlet <b>valve</b> <b>and</b> <b>ports</b> in the cylinder head, while the cylinder of a sidevalve engine is simply a closed-end cylinder.|$|R

5000|$|The {{cylinder}} head {{design for the}} 335 series engines is its most definitive aspect. All {{cylinder head}}s were two-valve heads that use large ports with poly-angle or 'canted' valves. [...] This resulted in the intake <b>and</b> exhaust <b>valves</b> being at separate angles. Canting the valves allowed for very large valves to be installed, while reducing the <b>port</b> length <b>and</b> minimizing sharp turns within the port. The end result was a cylinder head that had <b>valves</b> <b>and</b> <b>ports</b> much larger <b>and</b> freer flowing than the Ford Windsor V8s, {{and in some cases}} larger than some of the Ford FE and 385 Series V8s. [...] This same basic cylinder head design was used on the Ford Boss 302 engine, after it was modified to work with the Windsor engine block. [...] Most 335 series engines used stamped rocker arms with cast fulcrums that made for a nonadjustable valve train. Only the Boss 351 and 351 HO had adjustable valve train which had rocker arms mounted on screw-in studs and used guide plates.|$|R
5000|$|The {{cylinder}} heads {{were made of}} RR50 aluminium alloy due to that material's high rate of heat conduction and light weight, the latter estimated by Bill Heynes to give a weight saving of some 70 lb compared with a similar head made of cast iron. Special {{attention was paid to}} the gas flow, with Harry Weslake designing a curved inlet port to impart swirl to the air-fuel mixture for improved combustion. The same basic cylinder head layout was preserved throughout the production life of the engine but with many detail changes. <b>Valve</b> <b>and</b> <b>port</b> sizes <b>and</b> angles, camshaft lift, compression ratio and carburetion were frequently amended from model to model, depending upon whether power or torque was being emphasised. [...] Very early XK engines fitted to the XK 120 sports car and Mark VII saloon lacked fixing studs at the front part of the cam covers, where they covered the timing chains, which leaked oil as a result. From 1951 onwards, all XK engines had studs around the full perimeter of the cam covers.|$|R

Measurements of steady engine performance, fuel consumption and exhaust emissions were first collected using an automated test facility {{for a wide range}} of cam and spark timings vs. throttle position and engine speed. Simulations were performed for a significant number of measured operating points at full and part load by using a coupled Gamma Technologies GT-POWER/GT-COOL engine model for gas exchange, combustion and heat transfer. The fluid model was made up of intake and exhaust systems, oil circuit, coolant circuit and radiator cooling air circuit. The thermal model was made up of finite element components for cylinder head, cylinder, piston, <b>valves</b> <b>and</b> <b>ports</b> <b>and</b> wall thermal masses for pipes. The model was validated versus measured steady state air and fuel flow rates, cylinder pressure parameters, indicated and brake mean effective pressures, and temperature of metal, oil and coolant in selected locations. Computational results agree well with experiments, demonstrating the ability of the approach to produce fairly accurate steady state maps of BMEP and BSFC, as well as to optimize engine operation changing geometry, throttle position, cam and spark timing. Measurements of the transient performance and fuel consumption of the full vehicle were then collected over the NEDC cycle. Simulations were performed by using a coupled Gamma Technologies GT-POWER/GT-COOL/GT-DRIVE model for instantaneous engine gas exchange, combustion and heat transfer and vehicle motion. The full vehicle model is made up of transmission, driveshaft, axles, and car components and the previous engine model. The model was validated with measured fuel flow rates through the engine, engine throttle position, and engine speed and oil and coolant temperatures in selected locations. Instantaneous engine states following a time dependent demand for torque and speed differ from those obtained by interpolating steady state maps of BSFC vs. BMEP and speed. Computational results agree well with experiments, demonstrating the utility of the approach in providing a more accurate prediction of the fuel consumption over test cycles. <br /...|$|R

A modeling {{study was conducted to}} investigate the impact of ethanol addition on the performance, combustion and emission characteristics of a Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engine fueled by diesel. One dimensional simulation was conducted using the renowned commercial software for diesel and its blend fuels with 5 % (E 5) and 10 % ethanol (E 10) (in vol.) under full load condition at variable engine speed ranging from 1000 to 2750 rpm with 250 rpm increment. The model was then validated with other researcher’s experimental result. Model consists of intake and exhaust systems, cylinder, head, <b>valves</b> <b>and</b> <b>port</b> geometries. Performance tests were conducted for volumetric efficiency, brake engine torque, brake power, brake mean effective pressure, brake specific fuel consumption, and brake thermal efficiency, while exhaust emissions were analyzed for carbon monoxide (CO) and unburned hydrocarbons (HC. The results showed that blending diesel with ethanol increases the volumetric efficiency, brake specific fuel consumption and brake thermal efficiency, while it decreases brake engine torque, brake power and brake mean effective pressure. In term of emission characteristics, the CO emissions concentrations in the engine exhaust decrease significantly with ethanol as additive. But for HC emission, its concentration increase when apply in high engine speed. In conclusion, using Ethanol as fuel additive blend with Diesel operating in HCCI shows a good result in term of performance and emission in low speed but not recommended to use in high speed engine. Ethanol-diesel blends need to researched more to make it commercially useable...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access until 7 th March 2018. Flow {{coefficients}} of intake <b>valves</b> <b>and</b> <b>port</b> combinations were determined experimentally for a compressed nitrogen engine under steady-state and dynamic flow conditions for inlet pressures up to 3. 2 MPa. Variable valve timing was {{combined with an}} indexed parked piston cylinder unit for testing valve flows at different cylinder volumes whilst maintaining realistic in-cylinder transient pressure profiles by simply using a fixed area outlet orifice. A one-dimensional modelling approach describing three-dimensional valve flow characteristics has been developed {{by the use of}} variable flow coefficients that take into account the propagation of flow jets and their boundaries as a function of downstream/upstream pressure ratios. The results obtained for the dynamic flow cases were compared with steadystate results for the cylinder to inlet port pressure ratios ranges from 0. 18 to 0. 83. The deviation of flow coefficients for both cases is discussed using pulsatile flow theory. The key findings include: 1. For a given valve lift, the steady-state flow coefficients fall by up to 21 percent with increasing cylinder/manifold pressure ratios within the measured range given above; 2. Transient flow coefficients deviated from those measured for the steady-state flow as the valve lift increases beyond a critical value of approximately 0. 5 mm. The deviation can be due to the insufficient time of the development of steady state boundary layers, which can be quantified by the instantaneous Womersley number defined by using the transient hydraulic diameter. We show {{that it is possible to}} predict deviations of the transient valve flow from the steady-state measurements alone...|$|R
