5|$|A {{bill was}} {{introduced}} into the Maryland General Assembly in 2012 which would allow a casino in Prince George's County. The two likely spots were National Harbor or Rosecroft. The bill passed the Senate, but the House did not <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> The bill was passed and signed by the Governor in August 2012 to allow a casino in Prince George's County, which was passed via referendum in November 2012. After one season of live racing, Penn National and Cloverleaf reached an agreement to extend live racing at Rosecroft {{for the next two}} years. The only exception is if National Harbor becomes the location for the Prince George's County casino.|$|E

25|$|The problem—which also {{exists in}} the State Senate—can be boiled down to a single {{overarching}} issue: The Assembly speaker has too much power. He controls everything, from the legislation that can be voted on to how his normally docile members <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> He decides what the Assembly will accept in a state budget. He negotiates secretly {{with the other two}} leaders to hammer out important, expensive and far-reaching laws. And he ignores the wishes of less-exalted lawmakers.|$|E

25|$|In modern {{parliamentary}} procedure, {{the usual}} practice {{is having a}} proposal first, then discussion on this proposal with any modifications to it, and finally a <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> with majority vote deciding the issue {{if there are any}} disagreements. An alternative to this process is consensus decision-making. In this alternative, discussion of potential proposals is held first, followed by the framing of a proposal, and then modifying it until the group reaches a consensus, when {{there is no longer any}} disagreement.|$|E
25|$|During September 2011 the Palestinian Authority led a {{diplomatic}} campaign aimed at getting {{recognition of the}} State of Palestine within the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital, by the Sixty-sixth session of the United Nations General Assembly. On September 23 President Mahmoud Abbas submitted a request to recognize the State of Palestine as the 194th UN member to the Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. The Security Council has yet to <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> The decision was labeled by the Israeli government as a unilateral step.|$|E

25|$|The Keep Your Health Plan Act of 2013 was {{introduced}} into the United States House of Representatives on October 28, 2013 by Rep. Fred Upton (R-MI). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the United States House Committee on Ways and Means. On November 8, 2013, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced that the Keep Your Health Plan Act of 2013 would be considered {{during the week of}} November 11, 2013. The House was scheduled to <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> on November 15, 2013. On November 15, the House passed the bill 261-157, with 39 Democrats voting with the Republicans in favor of it.|$|E
25|$|It was {{originally}} {{expected that the}} National Assembly would vote on the bill on 20 October {{in order to allow}} enough time for the National Council of Provinces to debate and <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> ahead of the 1 December deadline. The vote was repeatedly delayed as the Portfolio Committee on Home Affairs was still involved in discussions. In response to the argument that 'separate but equal' civil partnerships would not comply with the Constitutional Court's ruling, the Portfolio Committee amended the bill to allow either marriages or civil partnerships, and to allow them to both same- and opposite-sex couples. The chapter dealing with the recognition of domestic partnerships was also removed.|$|E
25|$|Although Churchill {{claimed to}} have lost sleep the night of Eden's resignation, they were not allies and did not see eye-to-eye until Churchill became Prime Minister. Churchill {{maintained}} that and detailed how Eden resigned over Chamberlain's affront to Roosevelt, who had offered earlier in February to mediate the growing dispute in Europe. There was much speculation that Eden would become a rallying point for all the disparate opponents of Neville Chamberlain, but his position declined heavily amongst politicians as he maintained a low profile, avoiding confrontation, though he opposed the Munich Agreement and abstained in the <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> in the House of Commons. However, he remained popular {{in the country at}} large, and in later years was often wrongly supposed to have resigned as Foreign Secretary in protest at the Munich Agreement.|$|E

500|$|Emanuel {{was elected}} after the October 2002 joint Congressional {{resolution}} authorizing the Iraq War, {{and so did}} not <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> However, in the lead up to the resolution, Emanuel spoke out strongly {{in support of the}} war, urging a United States' [...] "muscular projection of force" [...] in Iraq. Emanuel {{has been the focus of}} anti-war protests for his support of funding bills for the war in Iraq, and his support, during Democratic party primaries, of Democratic candidates that were more hawkish.|$|E
500|$|On January 21, 2015, Harpole {{announced}} that he would run for a third term in the upcoming mayoral election. In his announcement, priorities that he cited included highway beautification, creating an additional Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone, and adding to the city's water rights. He was opposed by Roy McDowell, who criticized Harpole's plan to build a ballpark, saying [...] "We didn't get to <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> <b>it,</b> but I am going to make sure from here on out that people get to vote on all major issues". He also mentioned red light cameras, hand-held cell phones, animal control, and the drainage tax as additional issues he wished to put to a vote. Harpole won the May 9 election with 7568 votes, or 54%.|$|E

50|$|In 1774, Thomas Townshend again re-introduced the Madhouses Bill. The Bill was {{presented}} to the Commons for its first reading on 2 March, and was amended in committee on 23 March. The Lords <b>voted</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> 21 April, and made two amendments (the addition of s.19 and s.31) on 6 May, before the bill returned to the Commons on 10 May. The bill then received the Royal Assent on 20 May.|$|R
500|$|After his dismissal, Peale petitioned Congress for $30,000 as {{payment for}} {{improvements}} and inventions {{he had made}} for the government. [...] The Senate twice, in 1858 and 1860, passed legislation to pay Peale $10,000, but the House of Representatives declined to <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b> [...] In 1870, it {{was introduced in the}} Senate again, but did not pass. [...] Legislation to compensate Peale in the amount of $10,000 was enacted on March 3, 1873, after his death—the act was, according to its title, in relief of Anna E. Peale, Franklin Peale's daughter. The following month, Caroline Peale, Franklin's widow, gave the Mint a marble bust of her late husband, [...] "to be set upon a pedestal, in some position, where it may be open to the inspection of visitors and preserve his memory to future generations." [...] Taxay, writing in 1966, stated that he had been unable to ascertain the bust's whereabouts.|$|E
500|$|The 14-team playoff {{proposal}} remained tabled until December 2014, when no {{team in the}} NFC South {{could finish}} better than [...]500; Goodell stated that the league would <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> at the March 2015 Owners' Meetings. One proposed 14-club system includes giving first-round byes for the teams with {{the best record in}} each conference, two division champions in each conference receiving home games, and the remaining eight teams would be seeded by win-loss record. However, by the following February 2015, the Washington Post reported that support among team owners has eroded, and league leaders expressed reluctance to make a change until the one-year extension with CBS to televise Thursday Night Football expired {{at the end of the}} 2015 season. [...] The proposal lost all interest, and as of 2017, has not been raised again. [...] It is likely that no movement will be made on expanding either the playoffs or the regular season until at least 2020, when the current collective bargaining agreement expires.|$|E
500|$|Senator Will Espero {{offered an}} {{amendment}} to the bill that would have reduced the number of benefits granted, stating this would remove concerns that civil unions were similar to marriage. Passing an amended bill would have required the House to <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> again or to establish a conference committee to negotiate differences between versions of both chambers. Supporters of civil unions stated they would not support the compromise, and a senator argued that [...] "an amendment will kill it." [...] Hawaii Senate Majority Leader Gary Hooser stated in March 2009 he would try to bring the bill to a vote if no other senator did so {{by the end of the}} legislative session in May 2009. It was not clear how many senators supported Hooser and opposing groups announced protests if action was taken. On March 25, 2009, the attempt to bring the bill before the full Senate failed when six senators supported the measure instead of the required nine senators. Senate President Colleen Hanabusa and JGO chairman Brian Taniguchi had opposed recalling H.B. 444 from Taniguchi's committee, citing unwillingness to change the traditional lawmaking process.|$|E
50|$|The miracle {{needed for}} his beatification was {{investigated}} in Naples due to the cure of an individual dating 1998.

But the board could not come to a conclusive verdict so nominated the miracle to be discussed at a later date; the board - on 16 January 2014 - {{voted in favor of}} the miracle.|$|R
25|$|When it was tabled in the Parliament, {{there was}} {{significant}} concerns from civil libertarians and the Opposition that the Bill was passed far too quickly for those <b>voting</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> to actually read the document closely, and that insufficient physical {{copies of the}} bill {{had been given to}} the Opposition to read before a vote was held.|$|R
50|$|However, the Alignment {{still had}} an {{important}} role to play, as it helped pass the Camp David Accords and the Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty in the Knesset. This was necessary as many Likud MKs had broken away to form opposition parties (One Israel, Rafi - National List, Tehiya and Yosef Tamir as an independent) and several others (including Ariel Sharon and Yitzhak Shamir) abstained from <b>voting</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
500|$|The Maryland Senate, as {{the upper}} {{house of the}} {{bicameral}} Maryland General Assembly, shares with the Maryland House of Delegates the responsibility for making laws {{in the state of}} Maryland. Bills are often developed in the period between sessions of the General Assembly by the Senate's standing committees or by individual Senators. They are then submitted by Senators to the Maryland Department of Legislative Services for drafting of legislative language. Between 2000 and 2005, an average of 907 bills were introduced in the Senate annually during the three-month legislative session. The bill is submitted, and receives the first of three constitutionally mandated readings {{on the floor of the}} Senate, before being assigned to a committee. The decision about whether legislation passes is often made in the committees. Committees can hold legislation and prevent it from reaching the Senate floor. The recommendations of committees on bills carry tremendous weight; it is rare for the Senate as a whole to approve legislation that has received a negative committee report. Once a committee has weighed in on a piece of legislation, the bill returns to the floor for second hearing, called the [...] "consideration of committee" [...] report, and a third hearing, which happens just before the floor <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On 19 October, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy {{confirmed}} that the Spanish government would trigger Article 155 and move to suspend Catalonia's autonomy after a cabinet meeting scheduled for 21 October, following a letter from Puigdemont {{in which he said}} that the independence declaration remained suspended but that the Catalan parliament could choose to <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> if Spain continued its [...] "repression". Subsequently, Rajoy announced the Spanish government would take direct control over the Generalitat of Catalonia, proceeding to remove Puigdemont and the entire Catalan government from their offices and call a regional election within six months, pending Senate approval.|$|E
2500|$|Dennett {{returned}} to lobbying Congress in 1922, {{pointing out that}} private opinion {{of members of congress}} must be in favor of birth control since the average number of children of a member of congress was 2.7. [...] She continued to have difficulty finding sponsors for the bill, but in 1923 finally succeeded, when Senator Albert B. Cummins introduced the straight repeal bill in the Senate. [...] However, the bill made no further progress during that session, since Cummins was unable to succeed in getting the rest of the Senate to <b>vote</b> <b>on</b> <b>it</b> due to mass absenteeism when it came up for a vote.|$|E
50|$|The JCP {{involves}} the use of Java Specification Requests (JSRs) - the formal documents that describe proposed specifications and technologies for adding to the Java platform.
