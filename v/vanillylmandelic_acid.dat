40|$|BACKGROUND: Urine catecholamines, <b>vanillylmandelic,</b> and homovanillic <b>acid</b> are {{recognized}} biomarkers for {{the diagnosis and}} follow-up of neuroblastoma. Plasma free (f) and total (t) normetanephrine (NMN), metanephrine (MN) and methoxytyramine (MT) could represent a convenient alternative to those urine markers. The primary objective {{of this study was}} to establish pediatric centile charts for plasma metanephrines. Secondarily, we explored their diagnostic performance in 10 patients with neuroblastoma. PROCEDURE: We recruited 191 children (69 females) free of neuroendocrine disease to establish reference intervals for plasma metanephrines, reported as centile curves for a given age and sex based on a parametric method using fractional polynomials models. Urine markers and plasma metanephrines were measured in 10 children with neuroblastoma at diagnosis. Plasma total metanephrines were measured by HPLC with coulometric detection and plasma free metanephrines by tandem LC-MS. RESULTS: We observed a significant age-dependence for tNMN, fNMN, and fMN, and a gender and age-dependence for tMN, fNMN, and fMN. Free MT was below the lower limit of quantification in 94 % of the children. All patients with neuroblastoma at diagnosis were above the 97. 5 th percentile for tMT, tNMN, fNMN, and fMT, whereas their fMN and tMN were mostly within the normal range. As expected, urine assays were inconstantly predictive of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: A continuous model incorporating all data for a given analyte represents an appealing alternative to arbitrary partitioning of reference intervals across age categories. Plasma metanephrines are promising biomarkers for neuroblastoma, and their performances need to be confirmed in a prospective study on a large cohort of patients.

50|$|Neuroblastoma is an {{aggressive}} cancer of immature neuroblastic cells (precursors of neurons), {{and is one}} of the most common pediatric cancers, with a median age at diagnosis of two years. Adrenal neuroblastoma typically presents with a rapidly enlarging abdominal mass. Although the tumor has often spread to distant parts of the body at the time of diagnosis, this cancer is unusual in that many cases are highly curable when the spread is limited to the liver, skin, and/or bone marrow (stage IVS). Related, but less aggressive tumors composed of more mature neural cells include ganglioneuroblastoma and ganglioneuroma. Neuroblastic tumors often produce elevated levels of catecholamine hormone precursors, such as <b>vanillylmandelic</b> <b>acid</b> (VMA) and homovanillic acid, and may produce severe watery diarrhea through production of vasoactive intestinal peptide. Treatment of neuroblastoma includes surgery and radiation therapy for localized disease, and chemotherapy for metastatic disease.|$|E
50|$|Moclobemide is a benzamide, {{derivative}} of morpholine, which acts pharmacologically as a selective, reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (RIMA), {{a type of}} monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), and increases levels of norepinephrine (noradrenaline), dopamine, and especially serotonin. in neuronal cells {{as well as in}} synaptic vesicles; extracellular levels also increase which results in increased monoamine receptor stimulation and suppression of REM sleep, down regulation of 3-adrenoceptors. A single 300 mg dose of moclobemide inhibits 80% of monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) and 30% of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), blocking the decomposition of norepinephrine, serotonin and, to a lesser extent, dopamine. There is also some evidence pointing towards moclobemide possessing neuroprotective properties. There is no cumulative effect of moclobemide centrally when taken long-term. With long-term use of moclobemide, there is a significant down-regulation of B-adrenoceptors. Single or repeated dosing with 100-300 mg of moclobemide leads to a reduction in deaminated metabolites of amines such as 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethylglycol as well as 5-HIAA. Excretion of homovanillic acid and <b>vanillylmandelic</b> <b>acid</b> via urine is also reduced. There is also a temporary increase in prolactin during initial intake of 100-300 mg of moclobemide. L-dihydroxyphenylalanine is also reduced. However, suppression of the serotonin metabolite is less pronounced than the inhibition of the metabolite of noradrenaline which suggest there are other major metabolic pathways for serotonin other than MAO-A.|$|E

DESIGN [...] Prospective study of mass screening in four clearly defined geographical areas. SETTING [...] Four health districts of the Northern region of England.

INTERVENTIONS [...] Collection of urine on filter paper for analysis of content of homovanillic and <b>vanillylmandelic</b> <b>acid</b> in relation to urinary creatinine concentrations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Derivation of reference range. Identification of babies with homovanillic or <b>vanillylmandelic</b> <b>acid</b> > 3 SD above the mean (positive cases). Investigation of positive cases for evidence of neuroblastoma. RESULTS [...] The upper limit of normal (3 SD above the mean) for <b>vanillylmandelic</b> <b>acid</b> was 15 mumol/mmol creatinine and for homovanillic acid 24 mumol/mmol creatinine. Of the 20, 829 babies screened, 2537 (12. 2 %) required a second sample to be taken because the first sample was inadequate. Of these, 527 (2. 5 %) provided a liquid urine specimen and 10 (0. 04 %) had positive results for neuroblastoma. Two of them had neuroblastoma (true positives) and eight did not (false positives).

Male CD- 1 mice were continuously exposed to 0, 4. 7, 19. 5, and 95. 2 mg phenol/l {{in drinking water}} for 4 weeks. Various immune functions were evaluated and levels of selected neurotransmitters and metabolites measured in discrete brain regions. The doses of phenol did not produce any overt clinical signs of toxicity; peripheral red blood cell counts and hematocrits decreased.
