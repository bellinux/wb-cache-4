40|$|For many {{ornamental}} plants {{there are}} no fertilization tables in Brazil and growers use, inappropriately, the same fertilizing for different species of ornamental plants. A {{first step is to}} know the nutrient uptake by these plants. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the concentration and to characterize the accumulation of nutrients of the main tropical ornamental plants grown in the Ribeira Valley region, São Paulo state, Brazil: Clusia fluminensis, Dracaena marginata, Dypsis lutescens, Gardenia jasminoides, Ixora coccinea, Ligustrum sinense, Murraya paniculata, Podocarpus macrophyllus, Rhapis excelsa e <b>Viburnum</b> <b>prunifolium.</b> The plants were donated by local farmers and after sorting, these were divided into roots, stems and leaves, and, subsequently, washed, dried and was determined their concentration of nutrients. The experimental design was randomized using four repetitions and the species of ornamental plants were considered as treatments. The results were submitted to analysis of variance and compared by Scott-Knott test (5 %). For the macronutrient, the greater accumulation of N was in Podocarpus macrophyllus. The Clusia fluminensis tree had the highest calcium and magnesium accumulations. The largest amounts of P and S were accumulated in Rhapis excelsa and Podocarpus macrophyllus. The greatest accumulation of K was in Rhapis excelsa, Dracaena marginata, Podocarpus macrophyllus, Murraya paniculata and Ixora coccinea. Smaller amounts of macronutrients were accumulated in Dypsis lutescens and <b>Viburnum</b> <b>prunifolium.</b> As for the macronutrients, the largest accumulation of Cu was observed in broad leaf Rhapis excelsa. Clusia fluminensis tree and Dracaena marginata accumulated the largest amounts of Mn. Regarding the Zn, Rhapis excelsa, Dracaena marginata and Ligustrum sinense were plants with higher accumulation. Smaller amounts of B were accumulated in <b>Viburnum</b> <b>prunifolium,</b> Dracaena marginata and Dypsis lutescens. Ligustrum sinense, Dypsis lutescens and Ixora coccinea accumulated lower amounts of Fe in relation to others. The accumulation of nutrients by ornamental plants is very different between species and this information should be used to adjust fertilizer recommendations.

40|$|Ethnopharmacological relevance: <b>Viburnum</b> <b>prunifolium</b> is a North America shrub used in ethnomedicine {{because of}} its spasmolytic, sedative, and {{anti-asthmatic}} properties. Aim of the study: Contrasting results were reported in past literature about the active principles of this plant. Our aim was to clarify this matter by evaluating the relaxant and spasmolytic activities of the main constituents obtained from the drug. Materials and methods: The pharmacological assays were carried out on rabbit jejunum spontaneous contractions and on guinea-pig carbachol-precontracted trachea. Results: Cumulative concentration (1 - 100 μg/ml) of <b>Viburnum</b> <b>prunifolium</b> methanolic extract (MeOH extract), its purified fractions soluble in ethylacetate (EtOAc fraction) and in n-butanol (BuOH fraction), and the iridoid glucosides (2 × 10 - 5 to 4 × 10 - 4 M) : 2 ′-O-acetyldihydropenstemide (1), 2 ′-O-trans-p-coumaroyldihydropenstemide (2), 2 ′-O-acetylpatrinoside (3), and patrinoside (4), isolated from EtOAc fraction (1 and 2) and BuOH fraction (3 and 4), induced both relaxant effect of rabbit jejunum spontaneous contractions and spasmolytic effect on guinea-pig carbachol (5. 5 × 10 - 7 M) -precontracted trachea. Propranolol (10 - 6 M) antagonised all <b>Viburnum</b> <b>prunifolium</b> tested components relaxant and spasmolytic effects. At non-relaxing concentrations (0. 5 μg/ml), MeOH extract and its fractions induced a potentiating effect of isoprenaline cumulative concentrations also in both isolated tissues. Conclusion: In both tissues, the order of potency was EtOAc fraction > BuOH fraction > MeOH extract and 1 > 2 > 3 > 4 suggesting that the major iridoids of EtOAc fraction may be considered among the most active compounds. HPLC analysis of the bioactive iridoids indicates that 1 and 2 are present for 7. 38 % and 14. 90 % in EtOAc fraction, and 3 and 4 for 18. 47 % and 8. 86 % in BuOH fraction. By comparing the values of EC 50 of the fractions and compounds isolated from them, we may assume that the iridoids {{play a significant role}} in the biological activity of the corresponding fractions. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|The enemy release {{hypothesis}} {{predicts that}} invasive plant species {{may benefit from}} a lack of top-down control by co-evolved herbivores, particularly specialists, in their new range. However, to benefit from enemy escape, invasive plants must also escape or resist specialist or generalist herbivores that attack related species in the introduced range. We compared insect herbivore damage on the exotic shrub, Lonicera maackii, the native congener Lonicera reticulata, and the native confamilial <b>Viburnum</b> <b>prunifolium</b> in North America. We also compared the laboratory preference and performance of a North American honeysuckle specialist sawfly (Zaraea inflata) and the performance of a widespread generalist caterpillar (Spodoptera frugiperda) on cut foliage from native and exotic Lonicera species. L. maackiireceived significantly lower amounts of foliar herbivory than L. reticulata across three seasons, while damage levels observed on V. prunifolium for two seasons was generally intermediate between L. reticulata and L. maackii. The specialist sawfly damaged L. reticulata heavily, but was not detected on L. maackii in the field. There were few statistical differences in the performance of sawfly larvae on L. reticulata and L. maackii, but the sawfly achieved higher pupal masses on L. reticulata than on L. maackii, and they strongly preferred L. reticulata over L. maackii when given a choice. The sawfly was unable to complete development on native L. sempervirens and non-native L. japonica. In contrast, the generalist caterpillar performed similarly on all Lonicera species. While L. maackii experienced little herbivory in the field compared to native relatives in the same habitat, laboratory assays indicate L. maackii appears to be a suitable host that escapes selection by the specialist, but L. japonica and L. sempervirens are highly resistant to it. These findings indicate that both enemy escape and resistance (to a specialist, but not a generalist herbivore) may contribute to the success of exotic Lonicera species...|$|E
40|$|Background/Question/Methods Understanding {{the impact}} of {{invasive}} species on native ecosystems is important both ecologically and economically. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate potential outcomes of novel interactions of native insect herbivores with invasive plants. We investigated interactions of the specialist honeysuckle sawfly (Zaraea inflata) with native (Lonicera reticulata and Symphoricarpos albus) and invasive (Lonicera maackii and Lonicera japonica) honeysuckle species. We also examined the interactions of the generalist fall webworm (Hyphantria cunea) with native (L. reticulata, <b>Viburnum.</b> <b>prunifolium,</b> Ulmus americana, and Prunus serotina) and invasive (L. maackii, L. japonica, Lonicera tatarica, Pyrus calleryana, and Elaeagnus umbellata) plant species. Adult Z. inflata sawflies and H. cuneamoths were captured and reared in a laboratory to observe oviposition rates and preferences on native and invasive species. Next, no-choice bioassays were conducted with Z. inflata larvae and H. cunea caterpillars to determine how well they utilize various native and invasive plant species. Lastly, choice bioassays were conducted to determine host preference of Z. inflata larvae and H. cuneacaterpillars. Results/Conclusions The honeysuckle sawfly adults strongly preferred to oviposit on native honeysuckle species compared to invasive honeysuckle. However, larvae of this insect had similar survival and performance on L. reticulata, S. albus, and L. maackii. The larvae performed the worst on L. japonica. When the larvae were given a choice between native and invasive plant leaves, the larvae strongly preferred the native species. Fall webworm adults oviposited equally on native and invasive plants. Larvae of this insect displayed some variation in performance on native and invasive honeysuckle species. When given a choice between native and invasive plants, however, they preferred native plants. Overall, both the honeysuckle sawfly and the fall webworm generally prefer familiar native plants over novel invasive plants even, in some instances, when they can perform equally well on the invasive plants. Understanding factors that influence host choices of adults and larvae could benefit efforts at using native insects as biocontrol agents...|$|E
40|$|Invasion by {{non-native}} {{species is}} a complicated process and many hypotheses have been proposed to explain how invasive plant species are often poor competitors in their native range, but dominant in their novel range including the enemy release and novel weapons hypotheses. Additionally, many invasive species are characterized as being tolerant and/or resistant to both damage and limitations in abiotic resources. These hypotheses are based on plant-plant, plant-microbial, and plant-herbivore interactions in the invaders novel range and are not mutually exclusive. The genus Lonicera (Caprifoliaceae) includes approximately 200 species worldwide, with 18 native and 16 introduced species in North America. Some Asiatic species like Lonicera maackii, L. tatarica, and L. japonica are particularly successful invaders in North America, while North American natives are relatively uncommon or not abundant where they are found. I investigated the plant-insect interactions and defensive strategies of non-native Lonicera species, with particular focus on L. maackii in Ohio. I first quantified the amounts of arthropod herbivore damage occurring on L. maackii across two seasons. I expanded this assessment to include a co-occurring native congener L. reticulata and the confamiliar <b>Viburnum</b> <b>prunifolium.</b> Additionally, I included feeding bioassays to assess {{the performance of a}} specialist and generalist herbivore on native and non-native Lonicera species. Tolerance of mature shrubs was evaluated through measures of growth responses after repeated clipping. Greenhouse experiments with real and simulated herbivory were completed to determine the tolerance of juvenile L. maackii plants to herbivory and how this may be affected by changes in resource availability. Resistance traits were also evaluated in this experiment through measures of secondary metabolites with and without herbivory. Finally, resistance traits were further evaluated through a common garden experiment including multiple native and non-native Lonicera species, where herbivore damage, generalist herbivore performance, and both qualitative and quantitative analyses of defensive chemistry were evaluated in high and low nutrient treatments. Lonicera maackii and other non-native Lonicera species receive insignificant amounts of arthropod herbivore damage in the field and the damage they receive is much less than amounts incurred on native Lonicera and confamiliar V. prunifolium. Mature L. maackii shrubs are highly tolerant to large amounts of simulated herbivore damage, juvenile L. maackii is both tolerant and resistant to high amounts of real and artificial damage, and limiting light and soil nutrients did not limit their ability to tolerate herbivory. A honeysuckle specialist avoids L. maackii in the field, but can develop on L. maackii in the laboratory. Plants in the Lonicera genus that display resistance to arthropod herbivores can be characterized as being chemically well defended, and are generally poor hosts to generalist herbivores. Although native/non-native origin did not explain the chemical profiles of species, native Lonicera tended to produce more iridoid glycosides and non-native Lonicera produced more phenolic compounds. Lonicera maackii and other non-natives appear to not only escape damage from arthropod herbivores, they are also able to tolerate and resist the damage they do incur suggesting that a combination of mechanisms contribute to the success of these non-native Lonicera in North America...|$|E
