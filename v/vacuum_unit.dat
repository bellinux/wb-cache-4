40|$|Auricular pseudocysts {{are rare}} lesions that present as an {{asymptomatic}} cystic {{swelling of the}} anterior surface of the auricle, particularly the antihelix. Typically, the pseudocysts contain viscous straw-yel-low fluid similar in appearance to olive oil; however, a clear pale yellow serous transudate may also be encountered. Various therapeutic approaches have been used with variable success. We describe a sim-ple small vacuum device called the Chulalongkorn University vacuum device, which was developed in our center. The device can be easily made any-where by any surgeon. We report the outcome in 17 patients treated by means of needle aspiration plus application of the Chulalongkorn University vacuum device for 5 days. A complete resolution of the lesion was obtained in 15 (88. 2 %) patients. Because the procedure is safe and effective and does not require an operating room setting, it may be accepted as an option {{in the treatment of}} auricular pseudocysts. (Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg 2001; 124 : 213 - 6.) Auricular pseudocysts are rare lesions that present as an asymptomatic cyst-like swelling of the lateral surface of the auricle, mainly the antihelix. Typically, the pseudo-cysts contain viscous straw-yellow fluid that is similar to olive oil in appearance. 1 However, a clear pale yellow serous fluid without cells lacking growth on bacterial cul-ture, which characterized the fluid as a transudate, may be encountered and may {{be thought of as a}} seroma. 2 Whatever it is, the aims of treatment of this rare entity are to eliminate the fluid, to prevent reaccumulation, and to avoid an infection, thereby resulting in a cure. In an attempt to eliminate the swelling, a new device, the Chulalongkorn University vacuum device (CU-VAC), has been developed in our center. The pur-poses of this study are to describe the CU-VAC and its application and to evaluate the efficacy of needle aspi-ration plus CU-VAC application in treating the auricu-lar pseudocysts. The device is composed of 2 parts: the catheter unit and the <b>vacuum</b> <b>unit.</b> The catheter unit is the intra-venous catheter-needle unit. The <b>vacuum</b> <b>unit</b> is made with a piece of No. 200 collapsible Kent’s latex tubing (Kent Latex Product, Inc, Kent, OH) of about 12 to 14 cm in length.

40|$|Abstract: In {{refining}} and petrochemical industries, {{there is}} a growing demand for efficient model identification methods in MPC commissioning and maintenance. Recently, APC vendors started to respond to this demand. In this work we will introduce a modern identification technology. Key components of the method are: 1) automatic, multivariable and closed-loop tests, 2) automatic parametric model estimation and 3) automatic model validation/selection. The advantages of the technology include reduced test time (70 %), reduced process disturbance, accurate models and user-friendliness. A <b>vacuum</b> <b>unit</b> identification will be used to validate the technology. During the test, an existing MPC controller was online for stabilizing the operation. All MV's were tested simultaneously. The whole identification work took only few days. The performance of the new controller meets the client expectations. ...|$|E
