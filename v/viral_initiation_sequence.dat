The mechanism of origin recognition in higher eukaryotes is not well understood but it is thought that the ORC1-6 proteins depend on unusual DNA topology for binding.|$|R

40|$|The {{single-stranded}} mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) displacement-loop <b>initiation</b> <b>sequence</b> (7 S mtDNA) is hydrogen-bonded at {{the origin}} of replication in animal cell mtDNA. Analysis of 7 S mtDNA from several cell sources indicates that this <b>initiation</b> <b>sequence</b> exists as a family of fragments of relatively discrete lengths. mtDNA from both mouse L cells and mouse liver has four major sizes of 7 S mtDNA fragments, ranging from 500 to 580 nucleotides in length. The 5 ′-end region {{of each of these}} species is the same; thus, the size heterogeneity is due primarily to differences in length at the 3 ′-end of these molecules. By contrast, 7 S mtDNA from both human KB cells and human liver exists in three major forms, ranging from 555 to 615 nucleotides in length, due to differences at both terminal regions. The mtDNA <b>initiation</b> <b>sequence</b> from Xenopus laevis oocytes also exists in at least two forms, 1350 and 1510 nucleotides in length. Thus, the maintenance of multiple forms of mtDNA <b>initiation</b> <b>sequence</b> appears to be a general phenomenon of animal cells, although the precise mechanism of synthesis or processing of these forms is variable...|$|R

40|$|Several {{aspects of}} Rous sarcoma virus gene expression, {{including}} transcription, translation, and protein processing, can occur within Escherichia coli containing cloned viral DNA.

Pr 76 is processed into gag structural proteins in E. coli in a process which is dependent upon the gag product p 15. These observations suggest that E. coli can be used for the introduction and analysis of mutations in sequences relevant to viral gene expression...|$|R

40|$|We have {{designed}} ribozymes {{based on a}} self-splicing group I intron that can trans-splice exon sequences into a chosen RNA target to create a functional chimeric mRNA and provide a highly specific trigger for gene expression. We have targeted ribozymes against the coat protein mRNA of a widespread plant pathogen, cucumber mosaic virus. The ribozymes were designed to trans-splice the coding sequence of the diphtheria toxin A chain in frame with the <b>viral</b> <b>initiation</b> codon of the target sequence. Diphtheria toxin A chain catalyzes the ADP ribosylation of elongation factor 2 and can cause the cessation of protein translation. In a Saccharomyces cerevisiae model system, ribozyme expression was shown to specifically inhibit the growth of cells expressing the virus mRNA. A point mutation at the target splice site alleviated this ribozyme-mediated toxicity. Increasing the extent of base pairing between the ribozyme and target dramatically increased specific expression of the cytotoxin and reduced illegitimate toxicity in vivo. Trans-splicing ribozymes may provide {{a new class of}} agents for engineering virus resistance and therapeutic cytotoxins...|$|R
