The semiconductor panel must have an open circuit point such that the current and <b>voltage</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> a <b>maximum</b> and an open circuit voltage Voc. In addition, the maximum power point can be determined using the maximum current and voltage calculation immediately after capturing a HDP [38, 41].

40|$|Due to {{semiconductor}} technology advancements, the static power dissipation caused by leakage currents in CMOS circuits <b>is</b> growing <b>at</b> a much {{faster rate than}} dynamic power; the dominant power component. As a result, controlling and limiting static power becomes as crucial as controlling dynamic power. Out {{of a number of}} introduced circuit techniques addressing the leakage issue, power gating shows the most promising results, achieving 100 x leakage reduction. Several power-gating techniques have been proposed to date, however, no single one is ideal for all design scenarios. In order to minimize power and maximize performance, selecting the most appropriate power-gating technique for a given design scenario is of paramount importance. This thesis gives guidelines on how to choose the appropriate power-gating technique, depending on design parameters such as performance, power, area, and logic circuit behavior. When large logic blocks are idle {{for long periods of time}} and do not need to be activated quickly, power gating employing power switch overdrive should be used. The total power in sleep mode is often minimized when the overdrive <b>voltage</b> <b>is</b> <b>at</b> the <b>maximum</b> level allowed by the {{semiconductor technology}}. To deal with the issue of process parameter variations, when generating maximum overdrive voltages, a new generator is proposed. Circuit-level remedies to emerging and harmful leakage mechanisms [...] -most notably gate leakage [...] -are also discussed. Existing power-gating techniques are re-evaluated and compared, with an emphasis on total (subthreshold and gate) leakage power. Subsequently, a new power-gating technique for gate-leakage suppression is proposed. Finally, an approach to accurately capture and characterize emerging leakage mechanisms in SRAM arrays for accurate high-level modeling is proposed...|$|R

Reproducible, negative mode ASGDI spectra of saturated headspace perfluoro- 1, 3 -dimethylcyclohexane (PDCH) have been recorded on a home-built quarter-sized cylindrical ion trap mass spectrometer (CIT-MS). The fragment ions m/z 169 and m/z 181 were observed. The total abundance {{as a function of}} CIT float <b>voltage</b> <b>was</b> a <b>maximum</b> <b>at</b> 5 volts. This suggests the mean kinetic energy of the ASGDI is near 5 eV. The m/z 169 is the base peak which matches similar PDCH mass spectra from a Griffin miniature CIT-MS. Qualitative and quantitative, positive mode, GDEI mass spectra for toluene have been recorded. Qualitative GDEI mass spectra in continuous glow discharge and pulsed glow discharge have recorded. Pulsed GDEI eliminates photonic noise during detection. Electrons from the ASGDI added noise to the baseline. Electron suppressor plates reduced electrons so that a six-fold increase in signal-to-noise was observed. GDEI mode is suitable for extended, remote use with oxidizing samples under high vibration or high pressure conditions. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{engineering}} note provides {{background information}} regarding the control dewar secondary vacuum container. The secondary vacuum container has it's origin with the CDP control dewar design. The name secondary vacuum container replaced the CDP term 'Watt can' which was named after Bob Watt (SLAC), a PAC/DOE review committee member who participated {{in a review of}} CDP and recommended a secondary vacuum enclosure. One of the most fragile parts of the control dewar design is the ceramic electrical feed throughs located in the secondary vacuum container. The secondary vacuum container is provided to guard against potential leaks in these ceramic insulating feed throughs. The secondary vacuum container has a pumping line separate from the main solenoid/control dewar insulating vacuum. This pumping line is connected to the inlet of the turbo pump for initial pumpdown. Under normal operation the container is isolated. Should a feedthrough develop a small leak, alternate pumping arrangements for the secondary vacuum container could be arranged. The pressure in the secondary vacuum container should be kept in a range that the breakdown <b>voltage</b> <b>is</b> kept <b>at</b> a <b>maximum.</b> The breakdown <b>voltage</b> <b>is</b> known to be a function of pressure and is described by a Paschen curve. I cannot find a copy of the curve at this time, but from what I remember, the breakdown <b>voltage</b> <b>is</b> a minimum somewhere around 10 - 3 torr. Ideally the pressure in the secondary vacuum can should be kept very low, around 10 E- 6 or 10 E- 7 torr for maximum breakdown voltage. If however a leak developed and this was not possible, then one could operate at a pressure higher than the minima point...|$|R

40|$|In {{the recent}} years, {{there has been}} a trend to run {{metallic}} pipelines carrying petroleum products and high voltage AC power lines parallel to each other in a relatively narrow strip of land. The case of electromagnetic interference between high voltage transmission lines and metallic pipelines has been a topic of major concern since the early 60 ’s. The main reasons for that are: • The ever increasing cost of right-of-ways, suitable for power lines and pipelines, along with recent environmental regulations, aiming to protect nature and wildlife, has forced various utilities to share common corridors for both high voltage power lines and pipelines. Therefore, situations where a pipeline <b>is</b> laid <b>at</b> close distance from a transmission line for several kilometers have become very frequent. • The rapid increase in energy consumption, which has led to the adoption of higher load and short circuit current levels, thus making the problem more acute. Due to this sharing of the right-of-way, overhead AC power line ﬁeld may induce voltages on the metallic pipelines running in close vicinity leading to serious adverse effects. This electromagnetic interference is present both during normal operating conditions as well as during faults. The coupling of the ﬁeld with the pipeline takes place either through the capacitive path or through the inductive or conductive paths. In the present work, the induced voltages due to capacitive and inductive coupling on metallic pipelines running in close vicinity of high voltage power transmission lines have been computed. The conductor surface ﬁeld gradients calculated for the various phaseconﬁgurations have been presented in the thesis. Also the electric ﬁelds under transmission lines, for both single circuit and double circuit (various phase arrangements) have been analysed. Based on the above results, an optimum conﬁguration giving the lowest ﬁeld under the power line as well as the lowest conductor surface gradient has <b>been</b> arrived <b>at</b> and for this conﬁguration induced voltage on the pipeline has been computed using the Charge Simulation Method (CSM). For comparison, induced voltages on the pipeline have been computed for the various other phase conﬁgurations also. A very interesting result is that the induced voltage on the pipeline becomes almost negligible at a critical lateral distance {{from the center of the}} powerline and beyond which the induced voltage again increases. This critical distance depends on the conductor conﬁguration. Hence it is suggested that the pipeline be located close to the critical distance so that the induced <b>voltage</b> would <b>be</b> close to zero. For calculating the induced voltage due to the inductive coupling, electromotive force (EMF),induced along the pipeline due to the magnetic ﬁeld created by the transmission line has been calculated. The potential diﬀerence between the pipeline and the earth, due to the above induced EMFs, is then calculated. As the zones of inﬂuence are generally formed by parallelism, approaches, crossings as well as removals, the computation involves subdividing the zone into several sections corresponding to these zones. The calculation of <b>voltages</b> <b>is</b> carried out <b>at</b> both the ends of the sections. Each section is represented by an equivalent π electrical network, which is inﬂuenced by the induced EMF. The induced EMF is calculated during faulted conditions as well as during steady state conditions. Inductive coupling calculations have been carried out for the following cases: •Perfect parallelism between powerline and pipeline. •zone of inﬂuences formed by parallelism, approaches, crossings and removals. It has been observed that when the pipeline is approaching the HV transmission line at an angle, then running parallel for certain distance and ﬁnally deviating away, the induced <b>voltage</b> <b>is</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>at</b> the point of approach or removal of the pipeline from the transmission line corridor. The induced <b>voltage</b> <b>is</b> almost negligible near to the midpoint of the zone of inﬂuence. The proﬁle of the induced voltage also depend on whether the pipeline is grounded or left open circuited at the extremities of the zone of inﬂuence. Effect of earth resistivity and anti-corrosive coatings on induced <b>voltage</b> has also <b>been</b> studied. For mitigating the induced voltage on the pipeline,numerous low resistive earthings have been suggested. Results show that signiﬁcant reduction in induced <b>voltage</b> can <b>be</b> achieved as the number of earth points is increased...|$|R
