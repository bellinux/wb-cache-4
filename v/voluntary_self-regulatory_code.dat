These companies have generated concerns leading to the legal reform of corporate governance in America, and to the revision of <b>voluntary,</b> <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>codes</b> in Europe. The passage of time since the Enron debacle shows that critics were too quick to criticize, since the required adjustments have more the nature of minor adjustments to regulations.

40|$|Indonesia’s {{performance}} in implementing corporate governance based on formal {{law has been}} poor because of weaknesses in its formal legal system. This thesis examines possible alternative approaches to the regulation of disclosure to achieve a better standard of corporate governance including the Indonesian Good Corporate Governance Code. The study considers the regulatory space corporate governance codes can occupy as an alternative regulatory strategy in the Indonesian context. Specifically, it evaluates {{the ways in which}} they can improve accountability for disclosure and corporate governance and also strengthen formal law and regulation. Different sources of data from the literature and media data bases and the interviews are used to be triangulated. It first explores the ideas and models in the literatures reviewed on disclosure, <b>voluntary</b> <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>codes,</b> alternative regulatory theories, the relationship between formal and informal law concepts, and comparative law on legal transplants. It examines how Indonesia’s corporate governance codes accommodate these ideas, and in which areas their use may play a more significant role in strengthening formal law and regulation so that regulation becomes more effective, responsive, flexible, legitimate and transparent. It identifies relevant issues in political, social and business cultures which produced problems for formal law and regulation and the way in which the code as a form of alternative regulation may remedy such problems. And then these reviews are triangulated with business media data bases and empirical, semi-structured interviews...|$|R
30|$|Some scholars, {{argue that}} these {{reporting}} are primarily carried out for public image building purposes. A key concern is therefore whether firms’ reporting practices reflect substantive or symbolic behaviour, the latter {{often referred to as}} “green washing” (Delmas and Burbano, 2011). Perez-Batres et al. (2012) examine the question of what determines a firm’s strategic choice toward more symbolic or substantive CSR action. They empirically investigate two <b>voluntary</b> <b>self-regulatory</b> codes: the United Nations Global Compact and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). First, the empirical results show that not all stakeholders are equally relevant when firms decide to engage in <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>codes.</b> Instead, {{it is important to consider}} the degree of power of individual stakeholder groups. Second, the authors show that high stakeholder scrutiny has a positive effect on firm decisions to engage substantively, not only symbolically. Substantive involvement reflects true commitment to sustainability whereas symbolic engagement means the firm’s CSR actions are decoupled from actual implementation within the organisation. Third, the authors find even though a firm has slack resources, it still may consider the symbolic option. Fourth, the results suggest that firms from perceived “dirtier” industries are more likely to join substantive <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>codes</b> than firms from perceived “cleaner” industries.|$|R
40|$|Most {{models of}} <b>voluntary</b> <b>self-regulatory</b> actions {{designed}} to preempt environmental regulations assume certainty regarding {{the likelihood of}} the regulatory threat. We examine industry <b>voluntary</b> <b>self-regulatory</b> behavior under uncertainty of two sorts: first, the likelihood that an advocacy group triggers legislative action, and second, the likelihood that legislation passes once a legislative proposal has been put forward. We find that increasing the uncertainty of either type can decrease or increase self-regulatory actions. The latter result calls into question conventional wisdom, which suggests that a strong and credible regulatory threat is needed to induce industry to take <b>voluntary</b> <b>self-regulatory</b> actions. ...|$|R

50|$|In Australia, {{there is}} a <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>code</b> toward children’s {{exposure}} to food advertising. This study was {{that the proportion of}} non-core foods advertised decrease by eighteen percent from a previous study from before the <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>code</b> was introduced. This code was created because of the negative impact that the advertising of unhealthy food has on children. The <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>code</b> regulates the use of promotion, popular characters and unsuitable material during time periods dedicated for children’s television programs. The code does not monitor the types of food that may be advertised to children, and does not apply to times when high number of children are viewing such as a sports match. Since the code was introduced the rate of non-core fast food advertising has decreased as seen in the other study mentioned. The <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>code</b> only covers a small time period and range of food. An improved marketing approach would be limiting advertising on a wider range on fast food not just those designated as children’s meals. This study also saw that advertisement which promote healthier alternatives often still have some non- core foods present.|$|R

Academic researchers have found there to be such a weak correlation between directors pay and their performance, that the remuneration received, in many cases, can no longer be justified. As a consequence, various <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>codes</b> and regulations have been formed to tighten the link between pay and performance through "full disclosure" Ward 1998. These increased requirements will mean that directors will be more accountable for their actions when serving at such a high rank within public listed companies.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of new media—including branded websites, social media and mobile applications—has created additional touch points for unhealthy food and beverage companies to target children and adolescents. The {{aim of this study}} was to perform an audit of new media for three top selling food and beverage brands in Australia. The top selling brand in three of the most advertised food and beverage categories was identified. Facebook, websites and mobile phone applications from these three brands were assessed using a combination of descriptive analyses and structured data collection during June and July 2013. Information on target audience, main focus of the activity, marketing strategies employed and connectivity were collected. Promotional activities were assessed against industry <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>codes.</b> McDonald 2 ̆ 7 s, Coca-Cola and Cadbury Dairy Milk were audited, with 21 promotional activities identified. These promotional activities appeared to use a number of marketing strategies, with frequent use of indirect product association, engagement techniques and branding. We identified strategic targeting of both children and adolescents. We found that while all promotional activities technically met <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>codes</b> (usually due to media-specific age restrictions) a number appeared to employ unhealthy food or beverage marketing directed to children. Brands are using engaging content via new media aimed at children and adolescents to promote unhealthy food and beverages. Given the limitations of <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>codes</b> in the context of new media, strategies need to be developed to reduce exposure of children and adolescents to marketing of unhealthy food and beverage products via these avenues...|$|R

This paper reviews literature on self-regulation, primarily focusing on factors that influence the net private benefits of environmental programmes.

40|$|There is {{substantial}} evidence that {{children and youth}} are exposed to and recall alcohol advertising, and increasing evidence of associations between liking alcohol advertisements and under-age drinking. Alcohol advertising in Australia, as in many industrialized countries, is subject to a <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>code</b> developed and administered by the alcohol industry. The {{purpose of the current}} study was to investigate young people’s perceptions of the messages in recent alcohol advertisements and whether these perceptions support the industry view that self-regulation is effective in protecting young people from inappropriate messages about alcohol. Six print and six television advertisements were selected for the study, and 287 respondents aged 15 – 24 years viewed two alcohol advertisements (one print and one television) and completed a questionnaire immediately after viewing each advertisement. The respondents perceived messages in the advertisements regarding several social benefits of consuming alcohol, including that the advertised product would make them more sociable and outgoing, help them have a great time, help them fit in, help them feel more confident, help them feel less nervous, and help them succeed with the opposite sex. All of these messages transgress the terms of the <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>code</b> for alcohol advertising. There was also a strong association between emotional responses to the advertisements and stated intentions to try the advertised products...|$|R

40|$|From the {{perspective}} of the sociology of professions, every professional activity should have its own clearly circumscribed and regulated sphere of action. Such an articulation facilitates the regulation of the production of a given profession as well as {{the way in which it}} is practiced. The purpose of the research reported here was to provide a comprehensive review and evaluation of the regulatory framework governing the advertising sector in Spain. To this end, the authors analysed external regulatory legislation and <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>codes</b> extracted from the data base of the Asociación para la Autoregulación de la Comunicación Comercial (Autocontrol) that had been enacted or adopted between 1988, the year that Law 11 / 1998 on General Telecommunications entered into force, and 2003 as well as other relevant documents retrieved from the Boletin Oficial del Estado (BOE) pertaining to the same period. Findings indicate that although there has been a groundswell of legislation governing advertising practices in Spain since 1988, especially at the regional level, lawmakers have focused on the content of advertising messages and shown very little interest in regulating the professions of advertising and public relations. Furthermore, Spanish legislation enacted in 2003 and EU policies appear to have encouraged the adoption of voluntary codes of ethics. Sectors traditionally subject to mandatory advertising regulation, either due to the vulnerability of their target audiences or the potential impact of their commercial messages on public health or the environment, are more likely to develop <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>codes</b> of conduct than other...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. This study {{evaluated}} {{the impact of}} the Australian Food and Grocery Council (AFGC) self-regulatory initiative on unhealthy food marketing to children, introduced in January 2009. The study compared patterns of food advertising by AFGC and non-AFGC signatory companies in 2009, 2007 and 2006 on three Sydney commercial free-to-air television channels. Methods. Data were collected across seven days in May 2006 and 2007, and four days in May 2009. Advertised foods were coded as core, non-core and miscellaneous. Regression for counts analyses was used to examine change in rates of advertisements across the sampled periods and differential change between AFGC-signatory or non-signatory companies between 2007 and 2009. Results. Of 36 food companies that advertised during the 2009 sample period, 14 were AFGC signatories. The average number of food advertisements decreased significantly from 7. 0 per hour in 2007 to 5. 9 in 2009. There was a significant reduction in non-core food advertising from 2007 to 2009 by AFGC signatories compared with non-signatory companies overall and during peak times, when the largest numbers of children were viewing. There was no reduction in the rate of non-core food advertisements by all companies, and these advertisements continue to comprise the majority during peak viewing times. Discussion. While some companies have responded to pressures to reduce unhealthy food advertising on television, {{the impact of the}} <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>code</b> is limited by the extent of uptake by food companies. The continued advertising of unhealthy foods indicates that this <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>code</b> does not adequately protect children. <br /...|$|R

It is need-of-the-hour that each profession should create its set of codes that is a system of self-regulation. In absence of such <b>self-regulatory</b> <b>codes,</b> governments fill the gaps by imposing legal rules which are far less appropriate and suffer from serious shortcomings. The number of professionals working in the field of forensic science is relatively low in comparison to those working in other fields such as medicine and law.

The Code of Marketing Practices of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association of Canada (PMAC) has serious weaknesses in all of these areas. Although the Pharmaceutical Advertising Advisory Board's Code of Advertising Acceptance avoids many of the deficiencies of the PMAC code, it, too, has weaknesses.
