The same three circles form one of the standard drawings of the Borromean rings, three mutually linked rings that cannot, however, be realized as geometric circles. Parts of these same circles are used to form the triquetra, a figure of three overlapping semicircles (each two of which form a vesica piscis symbol) that again has a Reuleaux triangle at its center; just as the three circles of the <b>Venn</b> <b>diagram</b> may be interlaced to form the Borromean rings, the three circular arcs of the triquetra may be interlaced to form a trefoil knot.|$|E

25|$|In the 20th century, <b>Venn</b> <b>diagrams</b> {{were further}} developed. D.W.Henderson showed in 1963 that the {{existence}} of an n-Venn diagram with n-fold rotational symmetry implied that n was a prime number. He also showed that such symmetric <b>Venn</b> <b>diagrams</b> exist when n is 5 or 7. In 2002 Peter Hamburger found symmetric <b>Venn</b> <b>diagrams</b> for n = 11 and in 2003, Griggs, Killian, and Savage showed that symmetric <b>Venn</b> <b>diagrams</b> exist for all other primes. Thus rotationally symmetric <b>Venn</b> <b>diagrams</b> exist if and only if n is a prime number.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} drawing <b>Venn</b> <b>diagrams</b> for which each region’s area is proportional to some weight (e. g., population or percentage) assigned to that region. These area-proportional <b>Venn</b> <b>diagrams</b> have an enhanced ability over traditional <b>Venn</b> <b>diagrams</b> to visually convey information about data sets with interacting characteristics. We develop algorithms for drawing area-proportional <b>Venn</b> <b>diagrams</b> for any population distribution over two characteristics using circles and over three characteristics using rectangles and near-rectangular polygons; modifications of these algorithms are then presented for drawing the more general Euler diagrams. We present results concerning which population distributions can be drawn using specific shapes. A program to aid further investigation of area-proportional <b>Venn</b> <b>diagrams</b> is also described. ...|$|R
25|$|Venn {{diagrams}} {{are similar}} to Euler diagrams. However, a <b>Venn</b> <b>diagram</b> for n component sets must contain all 2n hypothetically possible zones that correspond to some combination of inclusion or exclusion {{in each of the}} component sets. Euler diagrams contain only the actually possible zones in a given context. In Venn diagrams, a shaded zone may represent an empty zone, whereas in an Euler diagram the corresponding zone is missing from the diagram. For example, if one set represents dairy products and another cheeses, the <b>Venn</b> <b>diagram</b> contains a zone for cheeses that are not dairy products. Assuming that in the context cheese means some type of dairy product, the Euler diagram has the cheese zone entirely contained within the dairy-product zone—there is no zone for (non-existent) non-dairy cheese. This means that as the number of contours increases, Euler diagrams are typically less visually complex than the equivalent <b>Venn</b> <b>diagram,</b> particularly if the number of non-empty intersections is small.|$|E

40|$|Proportional <b>Venn</b> <b>diagrams</b> {{have a wide}} {{application}} background. They {{can be used to}} visually {{demonstrate the}} magnitudes and relationships among subgroups. Within our SAS community, there has been a highly demanding for a new SAS procedure that can generate proportional Venn diagrams[1]. In this presentation, we will propose a SAS macro %pVenn. This SAS macro will be capable of drawing two-circle or three-circle <b>Venn</b> <b>diagrams</b> that are area-proportional {{to the size of the}} sets.

This paper is prepared for an intermediate and advanced audience. BACKGROUND <b>Venn</b> <b>diagrams</b> was proposed for representing logical positions by John Venn in 1880. A proportional <b>Venn</b> <b>diagrams</b> typically has three circles representing for three subsets from the same population. Each circular area stands for the relative size of each subset (like number of count or percentage); the overlap area of two circles implies the sharing amount between the coresponding subsets. The intersection areas, or the set relationships, are particularly intereste...|$|R

25|$|A <b>Venn</b> <b>diagram</b> is a {{representation}} of a Boolean operation using shaded overlapping regions. There is one region for each variable, all circular in the examples here. The interior and exterior of region x corresponds respectively to the values 1 (true) and 0 (false) for variable x. The shading indicates {{the value of the}} operation for each combination of regions, with dark denoting 1 and light 0 (some authors use the opposite convention).|$|E
25|$|The <b>Venn</b> <b>diagram</b> is {{constructed}} with {{a collection of}} simple closed curves drawn in the plane. The principle of these diagrams is that classes be represented by regions in such relation to one another that all the possible logical relations of these classes can be indicated in the same diagram. That is, the diagram initially leaves room for any possible relation of the classes, and the actual or given relation, can then be specified by indicating that some particular region is null or is notnull.|$|E
25|$|Venn {{diagrams}} normally comprise overlapping circles. The {{interior of}} the circle symbolically represents {{the elements of the}} set, while the exterior represents elements that are not members of the set. For instance, in a two-set <b>Venn</b> <b>diagram,</b> one circle may represent the group of all wooden objects, while another circle may represent the set of all tables. The overlapping region or intersection would then represent the set of all wooden tables. Shapes other than circles can be employed as shown below by Venn's own higher set diagrams. Venn diagrams do not generally contain information on the relative or absolute sizes (cardinality) of sets; i.e. they are schematic diagrams.|$|E

500|$|Two {{varieties}} of inequality violate {{the doctrine of}} reasonable classification: over-inclusiveness and under-inclusiveness. If a classification is over-inclusive, the net cast by the legislature catches a class of persons not contemplated as falling within {{the objectives of the}} Act. Conversely, an under-inclusive classification arises if the net cast does not catch a class of persons who clearly do fall within the mischief sought to be addressed. Tussman and tenBroek represent the two inequalities in a <b>Venn</b> <b>diagram,</b> an adaptation of which is reproduced on the right. Between the two inequalities, over-inclusiveness is a more egregious violation of the equal protection provision in the Constitution, for it affects the [...] "innocent bystander, the hapless victim of circumstance or association". In comparison, under-inclusiveness should not be fatal. The Court of Appeal in Taw Cheng Kong held that, keeping in mind practical considerations, [...] "the enactment of a provision need not be seamless and perfect to cover every contingency". The legislature is reasonably entitled to address the mischief [...] "in a piecemeal fashion", as the equal protection clause is not [...] "a pedagogic requirement of the impracticable".|$|E

2500|$|A <b>Venn</b> <b>diagram</b> (also called primary diagram, set diagram or logic diagram) is {{a diagram}} that shows all {{possible}} logical relations between a finite collection of different sets. [...] These diagrams depict elements as {{points in the}} plane, and sets as regions inside closed curves. [...] A <b>Venn</b> <b>diagram</b> consists of multiple overlapping closed curves, usually circles, each representing a set. [...] The points inside a curve labelled S represent elements of the set S, while points outside the boundary represent elements not in the set S. [...] Thus, for example, the set of all elements that are members of both sets S and T, S∩T, is represented visually by the area of overlap of the regions S and T. [...] In Venn diagrams the curves are overlapped in every possible way, showing all possible relations between the sets. [...] They are thus a special case of Euler diagrams, which do not necessarily show all relations. Venn diagrams were conceived around 1880 by John Venn. They are used to teach elementary set theory, as well as illustrate simple set relationships in probability, logic, statistics, linguistics and computer science.|$|E
