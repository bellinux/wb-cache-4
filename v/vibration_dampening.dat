2500|$|Ice {{hockey pucks}} of {{regulation}} [...] diameter and [...] thickness {{may be used}} as mechanical <b>vibration</b> <b>dampening</b> isolators in places such as feet for light industrial air compressors, and air conditioning units because they are of regulation materials and therefore consistent manufacture, size and shape, and are constructed of a repeatable and consistent vulcanized rubber material. [...] Since the material is rubber, it may be drilled out or milled easily to a fixed depth as rubber feet or used as rubber spacer or gasket material. [...] A very common use of a slotted hockey puck is as an adaptor between the metal foot of a trolley jack and the sill (rocker panel) of an automobile. [...] The sill has a spot-welded lip which fits into the slot of the puck and would otherwise be bent or marked by the metal foot. [...] Hockey pucks have been used to level furniture, beverage refrigeration systems, and as paper weights or door stops. [...] The hockey puck has many uses other than its original, intended purpose by virtue of its consistent physical properties.|$|E

50|$|Stainless {{steel is}} often {{preferred}} for kitchen sinks {{because of its}} ruggedness, durability, heat resistance, and ease of cleaning.

5000|$|Head's latest <b>vibration</b> <b>dampening</b> {{system is}} EDS (Electronic Dampening System) {{which is being}} {{implemented}} into the newer rackets, such as the HEAD Protector. It works by using piezoelectric fibers, which convert mechanical into electronic energy, controlled by a microchip. EDS recognizes the damping mode and electronically creates a cancelling counter vibration. This reduces shock impact by more than 50% and residual vibrations {{twice as fast as}} in a conventional racquet period.|$|E
50|$|Like {{metallic}} {{gear and}} disc couplings, grid couplings {{have a high}} torque density. A benefit of grid couplings, over either gear or disc couplings, is the ability their grid coupling spring elements have to absorb and spread peak load impact energy over time. This reduces the magnitude of peak loads and offers some <b>vibration</b> <b>dampening</b> capability. A negative of the grid coupling design is that it generally is very limited {{in its ability to}} accommodate the misalignment.|$|E
50|$|The SQUID {{itself is}} mounted onto a {{cantilever}} and operated either in {{direct contact with}} or just above the sample surface. The position of the SQUID is usually controlled by some form of electric stepping motor. Depending on the particular application, different levels of precision may be required in the height of the apparatus. Operating at lower-tip sample distances increases the sensitivity and resolution of the device, but requires more advanced mechanisms in controlling the height of the probe. In addition such devices require extensive <b>vibration</b> <b>dampening</b> if precise height control is to be maintained.|$|E

5000|$|Maple is {{traditionally}} {{used for the}} backs and sides of violin family instruments. It is also frequently seen in acoustic guitars and mandolins. Most Fender electric guitars feature maple necks (it {{is one of the}} hardest and most stable tonewoods, so it is often used in the neck because of its ability to withstand high tension). Hard-rock maple is commonly used for wooden tripods for its <b>vibration</b> <b>dampening</b> properties. Variations of maple (commonly maple wood with flamed or quilted grains) are used on the tops of electric guitars for aesthetic purposes. The very sturdy frame of the modern piano is usually made of maple or of beech.|$|E
50|$|The November class attack {{submarines}} were considerably noisier than diesel submarines and {{the early}} American nuclear-powered submarines, despite the streamlined torpedo-like hull, limited number of holes in the hull, special low-noise variable-pitch propellers, <b>vibration</b> <b>dampening</b> of main equipment, and antisonar coating of the hull (used {{for the first time}} on nuclear-powered submarines). Soviet reactors were superior to American ones in compactness and power-to-weight ratio, but the vibrations of Soviet reactors were much more pronounced. Novembers detected submarine targets during active service (for example, there were 42 detections in 1965 when regular cruises of Soviet nuclear-powered submarines began). The Soviet hydroacoustic equipment on the Novembers was not intended for submarine hunting, and had relatively limited capabilities.|$|E

40|$|Riveting {{operations}} in aircraft manufacturing {{involves the use}} of power tools for manually drilling holes for the rivets, power drills for the setting of the holes for the rivets, as well as rivet guns to drive and set the rivets. To close the rivet, the rivet is driven against a metallic bar commonly called a bucking bar. The bucking bars are typically held firmly to increase the quality of the riveting, as well as keep the bucking bar from dancing against the metal piece being riveted. Thus, employees in aircraft manufacturing involved in riveting are exposed to hand-arm vibration from several sources, and epidemiological evidence suggests that vibration-related musculoskeletal disorders are associated with long term exposure to riveting tasks in the aircraft manufacturing of aircraft. 1, 2 Recently, tungsten technology has been introduced into aircraft manufacturing for bucking bars, which are heavier than traditional steel bucking bars of the same size. Rivet guns with tungsten pistons instead of steel pistons have also recently been introduced with the objective of reducing vibration exposure to the riveter. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess vibration characteristics of steel and tungsten bucking bars and rivet guns to identify the combination that simultaneously reduced the combined exposure to both the riveter and bucker. Methods Vibration (10 g tri-axial accelerometer, Biometrics S 2 - 10 G-MF Series 2) was measured from eight experienced employees using seven different rivet guns on size 6 rivets, with the same person bucking for all subjects. Vibration was also measured on two different bucking bars for these same eight subjects, with the same person driving the rivets using the various rivet guns. The rivet guns consisted of three E 4 steel piston guns with different RPMs (Guns A-E 4, B-E 4, C-E 4), an E 4 <b>vibration</b> <b>dampened</b> rivet gun (Gun D-E 4 D), an E 3 steel piston rivet gun (Gun E-E 3) and an E 3 and E 4 tungsten piston rivet guns (Guns F-E 3 T and G-E 4 T). The bucking bars were made of 90 % tungsten (1694 g) and cold-rolled steel (843 g), and were the same shape and size. A two-way repeated measures analysis of variance was performed on the vibration (mean frequency weighted resultant acceleration) on both the rivet gun side and the bucking bar side, and mean rankings were used to assess the vibration simultaneously for the rivet gun and bucking bars to investigate which combinations provided the lowest vibration exposure. Results Frequency weighted resultant acceleration was significantly lower on the E 3 tungsten (F-E 3 T) rivet gun than the E 4 steel piston (B-E 4) and the E 4 tungsten piston (G-E 4 T) rivet guns (Figure 1). When measuring vibration on the bucking bar, the E 4 (A-E 4) steel piston rivet gun resulted in lower vibration on the bucking bars than the E 4 tungsten piston (G-E 4 T) and E 4 <b>vibration</b> <b>dampened</b> (D-E 4 D) rivet guns (Figure 2). Additionally, use of tungsten bucking bars resulted in a 35 % decrease in resultant frequency weighted acceleration than when using steel bucking bars...|$|R

50|$|Before the Second World War, metal was the {{standard}} material used for surface plates, however, the war efforts of various countries put {{a strain on}} the availability of metal. A monument and metal shop owner (Wallace Herman) in Dayton, Ohio, along with his inventive employee Donald V. Porter, started using granite in place of metal for his surface plates. Today most surface plates continue to be made of black granite, more accurately referred to as black diabase, with the more wear-resistant surface plates being made of quartz-bearing granite. The quartz content of these granite surface plates increases the wear resistance of the plate as quartz is a harder stone. Black granite is dominantly used in machine bases, granite accessories, and custom applications for its superior stiffness, excellent <b>vibration</b> <b>dampening,</b> and improved machinability. Quartz-bearing granite (usually pink, white, or grey) is often made thicker than black granite to provide equal load-bearing capabilities of the types of material used for surface plates as it is not as stiff as black granite.|$|E
