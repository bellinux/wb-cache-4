5|$|She {{suffered}} from bulimia <b>very</b> <b>badly.</b> That's not, like, a revelation – you knew {{just by looking}} at her… She would have died eventually, the way she was going, but what really killed her was the bulimia… I think that it left her weaker and more susceptible. Had she not had an eating disorder, she would have been physically stronger.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{bombardment}} began, the German 916th Grenadiers reported their positions {{to be under}} particularly heavy fire, with the position at WN-60 <b>very</b> <b>badly</b> hit. Although the Rangers at Pointe-du-Hoc were greatly assisted in their assault of the cliffs by the Satterlee and Talybont, elsewhere the air and naval bombardment was not so effective, and the German beach defenses and supporting artillery remained largely intact.|$|E
5|$|Although Niémen was <b>very</b> <b>badly</b> damaged, Amethyst {{was almost}} {{uncontrollable}} and despite Seymour's best efforts, {{he was unable}} to close with Niémen to ensure her surrender. Dupotet meanwhile was overseeing hasty repairs in the hope of getting away before Amethyst could recover. At 03:45, however, a new ship emerged from the darkness, soon revealed to be the British frigate HMS Arethusa. Arethusa was deployed as part of the force blockading the ports of Northern Spain and her commander, Captain Robert Mends, was a successful officer who had been commended just two weeks earlier for raiding the French-held port of Lekeitio. Mends immediately pulled alongside Niémen and Dupotet fired a single shot each at Amethyst and Arethusa. The shot at Amethyst missed its target, but the one at Arethusa struck the ship and threw up splinters. Mends was struck on the forehead and badly wounded, the only man to be hit. Both Amethyst and Arethusa then opened fire, Niémen surrendering immediately.|$|E

50|$|Their {{task was}} to {{manufacture}} the mortar, during the work and carry it to the bricklayers. The work was <b>very</b> hard, <b>badly</b> reputed and, though the salary was possible to live on, it was very low. According to an investigation from 1897, {{most of the women}} active in the profession were uneducated destitute unmarried women, often unmarried mothers. As they were very little construction work during winter time, the mursmäckas, just as their male colleagues, were forced to live on other work, in their case often charring.|$|R
25|$|The Cure {{were known}} for their abhorrence for miming their songs whilst on TOTP and on several {{occasions}} made it obvious they were not playing their parts – using such stunts as playing guitar left-handed, miming <b>very</b> <b>badly</b> out of synch and dressing their instruments up in clothes.|$|E

50|$|Different {{types of}} objects have {{different}} requirements, and many museums have specialized storage areas.

60|$|I was sorely puzzled how {{to answer}} him. All that he had said against himself, I had thought of him in my own mind. And why not? He had behaved infamously--he was a fit object for righteous indignation. And yet--and yet--it is {{sometimes}} so <b>very</b> hard, however <b>badly</b> a man may have behaved, for women to hold out against forgiving him, when they know that a woman {{is at the bottom}} of it.|$|R

Of course, they had lived together. But [...] everybody knew all about it. Some time before June,--early, I should [...] say, in that autumn,--there had been a quarrel. I am sure they were [...] at daggers drawn with each other all that April and May in respect [...] to certain mining shares, as to which Euphemia Smith behaved <b>very</b> [...] <b>badly.</b> I don't think it possible that they should ever have come [...] together again; but in May '73,--which is the date I have heard [...] named,--they certainly were not man and wife.|$|R
25|$|After {{the raid}} there were worries in April about the still <b>very</b> <b>badly</b> {{undermanned}} west coast and Chief of Staff George Marshall discussed a possible {{attack by the}} Japanese upon our plants in San Diego and then a flight by those Japs down into Mexico after they have made their attack. So Secretary Stimson asked State to touch base with their people south of the border, and Marshall flew to the West Coast on 22 May.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} two film {{versions}} of O Crime do Padre Amaro, a Mexican one in 2002 and a Portuguese version in 2005 which was edited out of a SIC television series, released shortly after the film (the film was by then the most seen Portuguese movie ever, though <b>very</b> <b>badly</b> received by critics, but the TV series, maybe due to being a slightly longer {{version of the same}} thing seen by a big share of Portuguese population, flopped and was rather ignored by audiences and critics).|$|E
25|$|Two years later, Straffen {{moved to}} Besford Court, a senior school. He was noted as a solitary boy who took {{correction}} <b>very</b> <b>badly.</b> In one incident when Straffen was 14, he was strongly {{suspected of being}} responsible for strangling two prize geese owned {{by one of the}} officers of the school; however, no proof was found, and it was not noted on his records. At the age of 16, the school authorities undertook a review which found his I.Q. was 64 and his mental age nine years six months and recommended his discharge.|$|E
60|$|A {{long strip}} of wood fell to his ax--long enough to require cutting in two. He turned it, and stooped over it. Something caught his eye--letters carved in the wood. He looked closer. The letters were <b>very</b> faintly and <b>badly</b> cut. He could only make out the first three of them; and even of those he was not quite certain. They looked like C L A--if they looked like anything. He threw down the {{strip of wood}} irritably.|$|R
5000|$|Harold Kalant, {{professor}} emeritus of toxicology and pharmacology at the University of Toronto, reviewed several of Skinner's trial documents. Based on his review, Kalant wrote [...] "I wouldn't {{be surprised if the}} heavy drinker would be able to move about somewhat, but he would be <b>very</b> confused and <b>badly</b> impaired, and would have difficulty standing or walking in a coordinated manner". Kalant based his calculations on the assumption that Skinner consumed the alcohol and codeine at 9:30 the evening of the murders.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{framework}} for acquiring and restoring images of warped documents. The purpose of our restoration {{is to create a}} planar representation of a once planar document that has undergone an arbitrary and unknown rigid deformation. To accomplish this restoration, our framework acquires and flattens the 3 D shape of a warped document to determine a nonlinear image transform that can correct for image distortion caused by the document's shape. Our framework is designed for use in library and museum digitization efforts where <b>very</b> old and <b>badly</b> damaged manuscripts are imaged...|$|R
25|$|In many cathedral {{churches are}} {{additional}} dignitaries, as the praelector, subdean, vice-chancellor, succentor-canonicorum, and others, whose roles {{came into existence}} to supply the places of the other absent dignitaries, for non-residence was the fatal blot of the secular churches, and in this they contrasted <b>very</b> <b>badly</b> with the monastic churches, where all the members were in continuous residence. Besides the dignitaries there were the ordinary canons, each of whom, as a rule, held a separate prebend or endowment, besides receiving {{his share of the}} common funds of the church.|$|E
25|$|Giachino was not dead, but <b>very</b> <b>badly</b> wounded. An Argentine paramedic, Corporal Ernesto Urbina, {{attempted}} {{to get to}} Giachino but was wounded by a grenade. Giachino, seeing what had happened, pulled the pin from a hand grenade and threatened to use it. The Royal Marines then {{attempted to}} persuade the officer {{to get rid of}} the grenade so that they could give him medical treatment, but he refused, preventing them from reaching his position. After the surrender of the British forces at Government House, some three hours later, Giachino was taken to Stanley Hospital but died from loss of blood.|$|E
25|$|The {{fighting}} in Sicily swung {{in favor of}} Carthage in 387 BC. After winning a naval battle {{off the coast of}} Catania, Himilco laid siege to Syracuse with 50,000 Carthaginians, but yet another epidemic struck down thousands of them. Dionysius then launched a counterattack by land and sea, and the Syracusans surprised the enemy fleet while most of the crews were ashore, destroying all the Carthaginian ships. At the same time, Dionysius's ground forces stormed the besiegers' lines and routed the Carthaginians. Himilco and his chief officers abandoned their army and fled Sicily. Himilco returned to Carthage in disgrace and was <b>very</b> <b>badly</b> received; he eventually committed suicide by starving himself.|$|E

Dr. Holt and his family finally sold the property to the commissioners for the National Zoological Park in 1889 for $40,000. By the time the Zoo purchased the property in 1889, Holt House was <b>very</b> dilapidated and <b>badly</b> in need of extensive repair. In helping plan the new zoological park, Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr. advised the park’s planners {{to look to the}} graceful architecture of Holt House as a source of inspiration.|$|R

50|$|Outside of {{the church}} {{building}} the ruins were in a <b>very</b> poor state, <b>badly</b> eroded, overgrown and at risk of collapse. But {{with the help of}} the Heritage Lottery Fund the site has been rejuvenated: the ruins conserved, footpaths reinstated and a wasteland transformed into a community garden with a monastic theme, concentrating on plants with culinary, medicinal, and aromatic properties. There are also interpretation boards, explaining the hundreds of years of history contained within its walls, while a year-long education programme engaged schools and community groups in many diverse activities relating to the Priory and its conservation.|$|R
