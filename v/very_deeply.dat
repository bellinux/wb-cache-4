Persistent and lasting recruitment policies boosted the number of redundant public servants. Risky credit, public debt creation, and European structural and cohesion funds were mismanaged across almost four decades.

5|$|World-class {{match play}} (i.e., {{a series of}} games between the same two opponents) often {{involves}} one or both players preparing one or two openings <b>very</b> <b>deeply,</b> and playing them repeatedly during the match. Preparation for such a match also involves analysis of those opening lines known to be played by the opponent. Fischer had been famous for his unusually narrow opening repertoire: for example, almost invariably playing 1. as White, and almost always playing the Najdorf Variation of the Sicilian Defence as Black against 1.e4. He surprised Spassky by repeatedly switching openings, and by playing openings that he had never, or only rarely, played before (such as 1. as White, and Alekhine's Defence, the Pirc Defence, and the Paulsen Sicilian as Black). Even in openings that Fischer had played before in the match, he continually deviated from the variations he had previously played, almost never repeating the same line twice in the match.|$|E
5|$|Unhexquadium {{should be}} a soft metal like mercury, and {{metallic}} unhexquadium should have a high melting point as it is predicted to bond covalently. It {{is also expected to}} be a soft Lewis acid and have Ahrlands softness parameter close to 4eV. It should also have some similarities to oganesson {{as well as to the}} other group 12 elements. Unhexquadium {{should be a}}t most moderately reactive, having a first ionization energy that should be around 685kJ/mol, comparable to that of molybdenum. Due to the lanthanide, actinide, and superactinide contractions, unhexquadium should have a metallic radius of only 158pm, very close to that of the much lighter magnesium, despite its being expected to have an atomic weight of around 474u, about 19.5times as much as that of magnesium. This small radius and high weight cause it to be expected to have an extremely high density of around 46g·cm−3, over twice that of osmium, currently the most dense element known, at 22.61g·cm−3; unhexquadium should be the second most dense element in the first 9 periods of the periodic table, with only its neighbour unhextrium (element 163) being more dense (at 47g·cm−3). Metallic unhexquadium should be quite stable, as the 8s and 8p1/2 electrons are <b>very</b> <b>deeply</b> buried in the electron core and only the 7d electrons are available for bonding. Metallic unhexquadium should have a very large cohesive energy due to its covalent bonds, most probably resulting in a high melting point.|$|E

In the summer months, drought can be a significant viticultural hazard, though since the late 1990s irrigation has been permitted. Temperatures in the summer typically reach 35°C (95 °F). A number of the vineyards are actually located in nearby Navarra but the wine produced from those grapes belongs to the Rioja appellation. Unlike the typically pale Rioja wine, Baja wines are <b>very</b> <b>deeply</b> coloured and can be highly alcoholic with some wines at 18% alcohol by volume.

25|$|The main {{scenario}} writer was Naoki Yamamoto, {{who had previously}} written the scripts for Tales of Hearts and the Xillia games. He wrote the script keeping {{the concept of a}} long and fun journey in mind, and developed Sorey as a mature character representing the game's central theme. Yamamoto worked closely with the team to ensure the story and gameplay relations between human and Seraphim characters were consistent. The concept of the Seraphim being a race invisible to humans was established early in development. This created difficulties in fitting a normal quest structure around this. The story was constructed around Alisha's departure from the party, with the development team adjusting the outfits sold for her as downloadable content (DLC) could also be worn by Rose. While Alisha's DLC scenario hinted at a continuation of the story, Zestiria and its story DLC were a self-contained experience, with no subsequent DLC scenarios planned. The final script covered six script books, including one for battle dialogue. In hindsight, there were concerns from staff that the scenario had not gone <b>very</b> <b>deeply</b> into the characters' psychologies, lessening its potential appeal, with Baba saying that they would attempt to take a more involved approach in future titles.|$|E

25|$|Khalil Gibran's The Prophet is a {{book that}} has touched many people <b>very</b> <b>deeply</b> since its {{publishing}} in 1923. It has been translated into more than twenty languages, and the American edition alone {{has sold more than}} four million copies. It is considered both by Gibran himself, and by the general public to be his literary masterpiece. The Prophet is about a man who is leaving a small town called Orphalese where he has made his home for the past twelve years. He has, for that time period, been waiting for a boat to take him back to the land of his youth. We are not told where that land is, only that he has been waiting to return there for twelve years. The entire book occurs on the date of his departure. As he is about to leave, the townsfolk stop him in the town and request that he tell them about certain things. He talks to them about life's lessons and imparts his wisdom to them. He is asked about giving, and he tells the people to give without recognition, because their reward is their own joy. He also talks about things like marriage, work, friendship and also love. He speaks about each, and more, describing the way that people should deal with each issue. This book is an interesting book. It is ninety-three pages of life's lessons set down in writing. These are words to live by, and tell others to live by. This book is certainly a book that everyone should read. Even if people don't agree with some of the beliefs, they should still read the book, if only to get their mind thinking about life, and its many quandaries from a different perspective. This book is not unlike the musings of an aging man imparting his life's lessons to an audience of just about anyone whom he can gather to listen to him. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Its lessons and stories are wise beyond the ages, and still hold up to be as true today as they were when Gibran wrote them in 1923. The lessons enumerated within this pages are lessons that one would hope were followed by the general population, and I know that if more people read this book, then {{the world as a whole}} might become a more easily survivable place.|$|E

The state formerly known as East Pakistan (and before that, East Bengal) had suffered an estimated 300,000 casualties when the Bhola cyclone hit its shores on 12 November 1970, and the indifference shown by the ruling government in West Pakistan, particularly by President Yahya Khan, was just one reason the Bengali national movement sought independence on 25 March 1971. This declaration resulted in an immediate military crackdown by Khan's troops, and three days later the Bangladesh Liberation War began. By 13 June, details of the systematic massacre of citizens were beginning to emerge internationally via the publication in London's Sunday Times of an article by Anthony Mascarenhas.

Patients and Methods: All consecutive, completely resected stage I-III LPS (as {{determined by the}} American Joint Committee on Cancer staging guidelines), treated at the Groningen University Hospital from 1977 - 2000, were analyzed. Results: A total of 69 patients, 35 males and 34 females, median age 51 (range 11 - 80) years, were reviewed. After a median follow-up of 71 (range 5 - 231) months, the overall local recurrence and metastasis rate at five years after diagnosis were 27 % and 16 %, respectively. Retroperitoneal localization was a significant negative prognostic factor regarding local recurrence; dedifferentiation, grade II-III, and deep location regarding distant metastasis; and dedifferentiation, grade II-III, stage II-III, size > 20 cm and non-radical resection regarding survival. Conclusions: LPS have a relatively mild biologic behavior, {{with the exception of}} <b>very</b> large, <b>deeply</b> located, dedifferentiated and/or grade II-III LPS.
