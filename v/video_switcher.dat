The HDVS range was launched in April 1984, with the HDC-100 camera, HDV-100 video recorder and HDS-100 <b>video</b> <b>switcher</b> all working in the 1125-line component video format with interlaced video and a 5:3 aspect ratio.|$|E
2500|$|Engelbart, {{with the}} help of his {{geographically}} distributed team, and with Bill English directing the presentation's technical elements, demonstrated NLS's functions. The presentation used an Eidophor video projector that allowed the video output from the NLS computer to be displayed on a large 6.7-metre high screen so the audience could see what Engelbart was doing. Additionally, live video of him and his associates from ARC in Menlo Park, about 48 kilometers away, was combined with the computer's output on the Eidophor. [...] The Augment researchers also created two customized homemade modems at 1200 baud which were high-speed in 1968, linked via a leased line to transfer data from the computer workstation keyboard and mouse at Brooks Hall [...] to their Menlo Park headquarter's SDS-940 computer. [...] In order to provide live two-way video between the lab and the conference hall, two microwave links were used, relayed by a microwave van near the summit of a hill that overlooked both sites. English also commanded a <b>video</b> <b>switcher</b> that controlled what was displayed on the big screen. The camera operator in Menlo Park was Stewart Brand—at the time, a non-computer person, best known as the editor of the Whole Earth Catalog—who also advised Engelbart and the team about how to present the demo.|$|E

5000|$|The {{devices in}} the chain depend on the service {{required}} under the contact with the Channel. Typically a standard television channel would require a Master Control <b>Video</b> <b>switcher,</b> and/or a Video router to allow switching of live sources. This <b>video</b> <b>switcher</b> may include other functions such as keying (graphics) (also known as Down Stream Keyers), Audio Overs for mixing in voice overs (VO) or announcements, and facilitate transitions between events, such as a fade through black or crossfade (also known as mix).

5000|$|As {{with all}} <b>video</b> <b>switchers</b> that use a frame buffer to create DVEs (digital video effects), the video {{path through the}} Toaster {{hardware}} introduced delays in the signals when the signal was in [...] "digital" [...] mode. Depending on the video setup of the user, this delay could be quite noticeable when viewed along with the corresponding audio, so some users installed audio delay circuits to match the Toaster's video-delay lag, as is common practice in video-switching studios.|$|R
2500|$|... 3M's Mincom {{division}} introduced several {{models of}} {{magnetic tape recorders}} for instrumentation use and for studio sound recording. An example of the latter is the model M79 recorder, which still has a following today. 3M Mincom was also involved in designing and manufacturing video production equipment for the television and video post-production industries in the 1970s and 1980s, with such items as character generators and several different models of <b>video</b> <b>switchers,</b> from models of audio and video routers to video mixers for studio production work.|$|R

50|$|In a {{television}} studio, a tally light {{is a small}} signal-lamp on a professional video camera or monitor. It is usually located just above the lens or on the electronic viewfinder (EVF) and communicates, {{for the benefit of}} those {{in front of the camera}} as well as the camera operator, that the camera is 'live' - i.e. its signal is being used for the 'main program' at that moment. Tally (also known as the 'on-air' indication) lights are typically red, although some cameras and <b>video</b> <b>switchers</b> accept a preview tally signal, which is typically green.|$|R
50|$|Video editing {{reached its}} full {{potential}} in the late 1970s when computer-controlled minicomputer edit controllers along with communications protocols were developed, which could orchestrate an edit based on an EDL, using timecode to synchronize multiple tape machines and auxiliary devices using a 9-Pin Protocol. The most popular and widely used computer edit systems came from Sony, Ampex and the venerable CMX. Systems such as these were expensive, especially when considering auxiliary equipment like VTR, <b>video</b> <b>switchers</b> and character generators (CG) and were usually limited to high-end post-production facilities.|$|R

50|$|A {{vision mixer}} (also called <b>video</b> <b>switcher,</b> video mixer or {{production}} switcher) is a device {{used to select}} between several different video sources {{and in some cases}} compositing (mix) video sources together to create special effects. This is similar to what a mixing console does for audio.|$|E
5000|$|The vision mixer, or {{technical}} director (TD) in the United States, switches between video sources—such as camera shots and video inserts. They also maintain colour and contrast {{balance between the}} studio cameras. A vision mixer (<b>Video</b> <b>Switcher)</b> is, confusingly, also {{the name of the}} equipment the technical director operates.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Video</b> <b>Switcher</b> - The video matrix {{switcher}} sends video from a selected source the appropriate display. AMX uses {{a variety of}} proprietary technologies (such as SmartScale for image resolution scaling and InstaGate Pro for HDCP key handing) to ensure fast, reliable switching of video while maintaining source video quality.|$|E
50|$|In {{most of the}} world, {{both the}} {{equipment}} and its operator are called a vision mixer or video mixer; however, in the United States, the equipment is called a <b>video</b> production <b>switcher,</b> and its operator {{is known as a}} technical director (TD).|$|R
50|$|Modern {{real-time}} multi-source HD {{facilities have}} many {{pieces of equipment}} that all output HD-SDI video. If this baseband video is to be mixed, switched or luma keyed with any other sources, then {{they will need to}} be synchronous, i.e. the first pixel of the first line must be transmitted at the same time (within a few microseconds). This then allows the switcher to cut, mix or key these sources together with a minimal amount of delay (~1 HD video line 1/(1125×25) seconds for 50i video). This synchronization is done by supplying each piece of equipment with either a tri-level sync, or black-and-burst input. There are <b>video</b> <b>switchers</b> that do not require synchronous sources, but these operate with a much bigger delay (~1 video frame).|$|R
50|$|Echolab was {{a digital}} cinema company founded in 1974 and based in Billerica, Massachusetts. It {{designed}} and developed <b>video</b> production <b>switchers</b> for digital media markets, such as broadcasting, live production, and events.

5000|$|Digital Video Effects, {{commonly}} called DVEs, are visual effects that provide comprehensive video image manipulation, {{in the same}} form as optical printer effects in film. DVEs differ from standard <b>video</b> <b>switcher</b> effects (often referred to as [...] "analog effects") such as wipes or dissolves, in that they deal primarily with resizing, distortion or movement of the image.|$|E
50|$|The Spectra Ace was {{introduced}} to the market in 1986, and won the company an Emmy Award. The proprietary system for off-line editing incorporates an edit controller, a <b>video</b> <b>switcher,</b> single and dual-headed laser disc players, video monitors, videotape recorders, terminal equipment and associated software. It operated Laser Edit, Inc. as a marketing arm. Laser Edit became a post production house over time.|$|E
50|$|A user {{still needs}} {{at least three}} VTRs and a {{controller}} to perform A/B roll linear video editing (LE), as the Toaster serves merely as a switcher (which can be triggered through general-purpose input/output (GPIO) to switch on cue in such a configuration), as the Toaster itself has no edit-controlling capabilities. The frame delays passing through the Toaster and other low-cost <b>video</b> <b>switchers</b> make precise editing a frustrating endeavor. Internal cards and software from other manufacturers are available to control VTRs; the most common systems go through the serial port to provide single-frame control of a VTR as a capture device for LightWave animations. A Non-linear editing system (NLE) product was added later, with {{the invention of the}} Video Toaster Flyer, though the product has never really worked to professional standards because it cannot consistently play video without jitters. As a result, the Flyer never caught on as a viable product.|$|R
