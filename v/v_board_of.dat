Starting in the 1960s, Manual began to face problems associated with inner city schools in the United States as economically advantaged families moved towards Louisville's suburbs. Manual was exempt from court-ordered busing in the 1970s because its racial makeup already met federal guidelines.|$|E
5|$|He {{believed}} that the First Amendment erected a metaphorical wall of separation between church and state. During his career Black wrote several important opinions relating to church-state separation.

5|$|McCarthyism {{declined}} in late 1954 after television journalist Edward R. Murrow and others publicly chastised McCarthy.

5|$|Not {{everyone}} {{accepted the}} Brown <b>v.</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> Education decision. In Virginia, Senator Harry F.

5|$|On May 17, 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court {{handed down}} its ruling in Brown <b>v.</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> Education, {{in which the}} {{unanimous}} court held that separate public schools for {{black and white students}} was unconstitutional. Although agitation for an end to racial segregation in schools (and society at large) had been building in the United States since the end of World War II, Brown sparked the modern American civil rights movement.|$|E

5|$|Black's {{majority}} opinion in McCollum <b>v.</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> Education (1948) {{held that the}} government could not provide religious instruction in public schools. In Torcaso v. Watkins (1961), he delivered an opinion which affirmed that the states could not use religious tests as qualifications for public office. Similarly, he authored the {{majority opinion}} in Engel v.

5|$|In 1963, three African-American {{students}} {{brought a}} case against the Mobile County School Board for being denied admission to Murphy High School. This was nearly {{a decade after the}} United States Supreme Court had ruled in Brown <b>v.</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> Education (1954) that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional. The federal district court ordered that the three students be admitted to Murphy for the 1964 school year, leading to the desegregation of Mobile County's school system.|$|E
5|$|Racial {{tensions}} increased {{after the}} United States Supreme Court's 1954 decision in Brown <b>v.</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> Education to end segregation in public education, which it ruled as unconstitutional. Many segregationists believed the ruling {{would lead to}} interracial dating and marriage. Whites strongly resisted the court's ruling; one Virginia county closed all its public schools to prevent integration. Other jurisdictions simply ignored the ruling. In other ways, whites used stronger measures to keep blacks politically disenfranchised, {{which they had been}} {{since the turn of the}} century. Segregation in the South was used to constrain blacks forcefully from any semblance of social equality.|$|E

5|$|The First Amendment protects public {{employees}} from retaliation by their employer when speaking {{on matters of}} public concern. In Pickering <b>v.</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> Education (1968), the Court first articulated the right of {{public employees}} {{to be protected from}} dismissal for exercising their right to free speech. There, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of a teacher who was fired after writing a letter to a local newspaper critical of its handling of a recent bond issue. Eight years later, this protection from dismissal was extended to cover partisan political ideology and affiliation in Elrod v. Burns.|$|E
5|$|The Fourteenth Amendment, {{particularly}} {{its first}} section, {{is one of}} the most litigated parts of the Constitution, forming the basis for landmark decisions such as Brown <b>v.</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> Education (1954) regarding racial segregation, Roe v. Wade (1973) regarding abortion, Bush v. Gore (2000) regarding the 2000 presidential election, and Obergefell v. Hodges (2015) regarding same-sex marriage. The amendment limits the actions of all state and local officials, including those acting on behalf of such an official.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Civil Rights Movement {{challenging}} the restrictions and discrimination practiced against blacks exercise of constitutional rights, a series of US Supreme Court cases, beginning with Brown <b>v.</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> Education in 1954, the 24th Amendment, and federal legislation: the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 had overturned the most controversial aspects of the 1902 Constitution – the provisions restricting voting by African Americans and mandating school segregation. Combined with the election of Governor Mills Godwin in 1965, there was impetus for governmental change. Godwin strongly advocated the loosening of the strict constitutional restrictions on state-issued bonds and borrowing, and used his power and popularity to push for a new constitution. In 1968 a joint resolution of the Virginia General Assembly approved a new commission, chaired by former Governor Albertis Harrison, to revise the constitution.|$|E
