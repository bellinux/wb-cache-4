25|$|At 2 a.m. on 7 July 1880 a fire {{occurred}} in the upper floor workroom-library of Mommsen's house at Marchstraße 6 in Berlin. After being burned while attempting to remove <b>valuable</b> <b>papers,</b> he was restrained from returning to the blazing house. Several old manuscripts were burnt to ashes, including Manuscript 0.4.36, which was on loan from the library of Trinity College, Cambridge. There is information that the important Manuscript of Jordanes from Heidelberg University library was burnt. Two other important manuscripts, from Brussels and Halle, were also destroyed.|$|E
25|$|The Department {{continued}} to receive materials for preservation until the copyright function was {{transferred from the}} Library to the Department of the Interior in 1859 {{and then to the}} Library of Congress in 1870. In recognition of a growing national role for the Library of Congress, the Congress and the President agreed in 1903 to a law that gave government agencies the authority to transfer materials no longer needed for their use to the Library of Congress. Among the very special documents transferred that year from State to the Library of Congress were the papers of Washington, Hamilton, Jefferson, Monroe, and Madison, and Franklin. State was no longer able to house and service these <b>valuable</b> <b>papers,</b> acquired for a total cost of $155,000 throughout the nineteenth century.|$|E

60|$|After dinner we adjourned to the drawing-room, {{which served}} also for study and library. Against the wall {{on one side}} was a long writing- table, with drawers; surmounted by a small cabinet of {{polished}} wood, with folding doors richly studded with brass ornaments, within which Scott kept his most <b>valuable</b> <b>papers.</b> Above the cabinet, {{in a kind of}} niche, was a complete corslet of glittering steel, with a closed helmet, and flanked by gauntlets and battle-axes. Around were hung trophies and relics of various kinds: a cimeter of Tippoo Saib; a Highland broadsword from Flodden Field; a pair of Rippon spurs from Bannockburn; and above all, a gun which had belonged to Rob Roy, and bore his initials, R.M.G., an object of peculiar interest to me at the time, as it was understood Scott was actually engaged in printing a novel founded on the story of that famous outlaw.|$|E
60|$|The adventurer {{had no time}} to lose. He darted {{from his}} bedraggled victim, sprang into his own seat, and with his foot on the {{accelerator}} shot swiftly off down the road. Some way down there was a narrow side lane, and into this the fugitive turned, cracking on his high speed and leaving a good five miles between him and any pursuer before he ventured to stop. Then, in a quiet corner, he counted over his booty of the evening--the paltry plunder of Mr. Ronald Barker, the rather better-furnished purses of the actresses, which contained four pounds between them, and, finally, the gorgeous jewellery and well-filled note- book of the plutocrat upon the Daimler. Five notes of fifty pounds, four of ten, fifteen sovereigns, and a number of <b>valuable</b> <b>papers</b> made up a most noble haul. It was clearly enough for one night's work. The adventurer replaced all his ill-gotten gains in his pocket, and, lighting a cigarette, set forth upon his way with the air {{of a man who has}} no further care upon his mind.|$|E
60|$|The {{difficulty}} was {{solved by}} supposing {{that the narrator}} {{had made a mistake}} of one day in the date of the occurrence; so that our friend did not hesitate to introduce the story at every tavern and country store along the road, expending a whole bunch of Spanish wrappers among at least twenty horrified audiences. He found himself invariably the first bearer of the intelligence, and was so pestered with questions that he could not avoid filling up the outline, till it became quite a respectable narrative. He met with one piece of corroborative evidence. Mr. Higginbotham was a trader; and a former clerk of his, to whom Dominicus related the facts, testified that the old gentleman was accustomed to return home through the orchard about nightfall, with the money and <b>valuable</b> <b>papers</b> of the store in his pocket. The clerk manifested but little grief at Mr. Higginbotham's catastrophe, hinting, what the pedlar had discovered in his own dealings with him, that he was a crusty old fellow, as close as a vice. His property would descend to a pretty niece who was now keeping school in Kimballton.|$|E
