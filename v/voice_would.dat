5|$|Tony Todd, {{who played}} Candyman in the 1992 film Candyman, was cast as {{mortician}} William Bludworth. Morgan initially wanted Todd {{for the role}} because he felt his deep <b>voice</b> <b>would</b> give the film an eerie tone.|$|E
5|$|According to Vid Gaković, who was {{a member}} of National Unity in 1914, Stojanović was an ambitious and talented young man. He was {{determined}} that his <b>voice</b> <b>would</b> be heard and he liked being the centre of attention. He was severe to younger members of the association, whom he sometimes sharply criticised. Nevertheless, younger students liked being around him. Gaković described him as a tall and handsome man who greatly cared about his appearance; he wore a bow tie and a broad-brimmed hat.|$|E
5|$|The game {{opens with}} the witch Cackletta and her {{assistant}} Fawful (disguised as good-will ambassadors) arriving to steal Princess Peach's voice {{and replace it}} with explosives. After being summoned to the palace by Toad, Mario and Luigi confront and subdue Bowser, who coincidentally was attempting to kidnap Peach. Bowser decides against doing so, and teams up with Mario and Luigi to take her voice back from Cackletta, who has fled to the Beanbean Kingdom, with the intention of kidnapping Peach afterward when her <b>voice</b> <b>would</b> not destroy his castle.|$|E
5000|$|However, Baradwaj Rangan of The Hindu wrote [...] "The film {{opens with}} a {{dedication}} to legends like S. G. Kittappa and K. B. Sundarambal, but a soundtrack filled with those kinds of <b>voices</b> <b>would</b> be booed off the screen today. The singers sound lighter, more contemporary, even while rendering bits like Kaayadha Kaanagathe, which was immortalised on screen by T. R. Mahalingam - again, a <b>voice</b> that <b>would</b> most likely make the audience collapse into giggles." ...|$|R
50|$|These <b>voices</b> <b>would</b> also replace {{actors who}} left their roles {{from the first}} two series, but these roles are {{currently}} difficult for fans to identify who played which role, as the series 3 credits only listed the actors names and not the roles they played.|$|R
50|$|During Wish's halcyon years, {{the station}} {{had only two}} announcers for the 24-hour {{broadcast}} day...program director and morning announcer Joe Fenn and afternoon announcer Tom Malloy. Both men would work a live four-hour on-air shift, but their pre-recorded <b>voices</b> <b>would</b> be heard for the remaining 8 hours.|$|R
25|$|Any script {{calling for}} a child's <b>voice</b> <b>would</b> usually go to Elliott.|$|E
25|$|In {{an ironic}} twist, The Village <b>Voice</b> <b>would</b> award The Old Glory with five of their Obie Theater Awards (as noted above) a year {{following}} their publication of Herschberger's negative article.|$|E
25|$|Three {{actors in}} the film have been {{involved}} in other Pocahontas-related projects. Gordon Tootoosis, who voiced Kekata the shaman, acted as Chief Powhatan in , released the same year as this film. Christian Bale, who voiced Thomas, and Irene Bedard, who provided Pocahontas's speaking <b>voice,</b> <b>would</b> ten years later portray John Rolfe and Pocahontas's mother respectively in The New World.|$|E
5000|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the bridge}} of the song, the words [...] "Yeah, You!" [...] were {{recorded}} at half speed, so the <b>voices</b> <b>would</b> play back at a higher pitch. King Curtis plays the tenor saxophone during the instrumental and the fade out of the record.|$|R
6000|$|The {{absurdity of}} these great capitalists going to his mother's threadbare little {{apartment}} for counsel in ways to win millions made Victor smile. He said, with a mock sigh, [...] "I wish these <b>Voices</b> <b>would</b> tell me where {{to find a job}} that would pay fifteen dollars a week." ...|$|R
5|$|Several of the film's <b>voice</b> actors <b>would</b> <b>voice</b> {{characters}} in later Pixar films: Foley returned for Monsters University, Kind for Cars, Cars 2, Toy Story 3, and Inside Out; and Garrett for Finding Nemo and Ratatouille.|$|R
25|$|In 2012, the BBC out-bid ITV for {{the rights}} to The Voice UK, which had already proved to be popular in other countries. The BBC paid £22 million {{for the rights}} to {{broadcast}} the show in the UK for two years. The Voice UK achieved good ratings for the BBC but ratings dropped {{towards the end of the}} first series and the second series. In 2013, The Voice was rescheduled to avoid a clash, and as a result, ratings have improved. In November 2015, it was announced that The <b>Voice</b> <b>would</b> be moving to ITV from 2017.|$|E
500|$|Ayumi Ito/Rachael Leigh Cook as Tifa Lockhart. Nomura {{felt that}} Ito's [...] "husky" [...] <b>voice</b> <b>would</b> offer a good {{contrast}} with Maaya Sakamoto.|$|E
500|$|To gauge how an actor's <b>voice</b> <b>would</b> {{fit with}} a character, Lasseter {{borrowed}} a common Disney technique: animate a vocal monologue from a well-established actor to meld the actor's voice {{with the appearance}} or actions of the animated character. This early test footage, using Hanks' voice from Turner & Hooch, convinced Hanks {{to sign on to}} the film. [...] Toy Story was both Hanks' and Allen's first animated film role.|$|E
50|$|A {{canon of}} two voices {{may be called}} a canon in two, {{similarly}} a canon of x <b>voices</b> <b>would</b> be called a canon in x. This terminology {{may be used in}} combination with a similar terminology for the interval between each voice, different from the terminology in the following paragraph.|$|R
5000|$|... "Univ. Head in the Eights. Univ, though Balliol {{came near}} them were never in danger...The Eight supped with Snell {{and the rest}} of us joined them after supper, and had a glorious evening. Singing and {{shouting}} as well as our <b>voices</b> <b>would</b> let us — Everything went off well no one being drunk." ...|$|R
5000|$|Tenney has {{suggested}} the piece be [...] "regenerated" [...] with {{the distance between}} successive voices, the minor sixth (1.6 in just intonation, 1.587 in equal temperament), being tuned to golden ratio phi (1.618). This is desirable because then all first-order difference tones between adjacent <b>voices</b> <b>would</b> be present in lower voices [...]|$|R
500|$|Describing {{the real}} Seymour Skinner, Keeler remarked, [...] "It {{would have been}} easy to make him a really horrible, nasty, dislikeable guy, but we didn't do that. We made him just not quite right, not quite Skinner, and a little bit off." [...] Bill Oakley said the idea behind the {{character}} was that he [...] "just lacked pizzazz". The producers selected Martin Sheen to voice the character because they admired his performance in Apocalypse Now and felt his <b>voice</b> <b>would</b> be appropriate for a Vietnam veteran.|$|E
500|$|Drake began {{recording}} {{his debut}} album Five Leaves Left later in 1968, with Boyd assuming {{the role of}} producer. The sessions took place in Sound Techniques studio, London, with Drake skipping lectures to travel by train to the capital. Inspired by John Simon's production of Leonard Cohen's first album, Boyd was keen that Drake's <b>voice</b> <b>would</b> be recorded in a similar close and intimate style, [...] "with no shiny pop reverb". He sought to include a string arrangement similar to Simon's, [...] "without overwhelming... or sounding cheesy".|$|E
500|$|Several {{lines in}} the episode were re-recorded. During post-production, editors feared that Rich's mumbly <b>voice</b> <b>would</b> {{make it hard for}} viewers to {{understand}} what he was saying, so he was brought back in to re-record his dialogue, which was then dubbed over the footage. In addition, during the scene wherein Mulder tells Scully Bobby's nickname at school, the original version featured Mulder saying [...] "Dickweed". Fox's standards and practices department made the show change the name to [...] "Dorkweed", which required David Duchovny to re-dub his line.|$|E
50|$|Some men, in falsetto {{voice or}} {{as a result}} of certain rare {{physiological}} conditions, can sing in the same range as women. These do not fall into the female categories, instead called countertenors within classical music. Within contemporary music, however, {{the use of the term}} tenor for these male <b>voices</b> <b>would</b> be more appropriate.|$|R
50|$|Later, VOCANESE {{confirmed}} {{that they had}} previously contacted some voice actresses and considered them to be less risky and had better efficiency. However, they refused to ignore any other potential voices for their new vocal, thus the audition was launched. In another response, Shanghai HENIAN stated that the participants' <b>voices</b> <b>would</b> be posted on the official Ling Weibo page.|$|R
60|$|The {{windows were}} without glass, {{which was in}} those days an {{expensive}} article in America, and the mildness of the climate of Virginia rendered glass a luxury rather than a necessity. Confident that even the murmur of their <b>voices</b> <b>would</b> not be overheard if they spoke in their usual way, Jake and Harold were enabled to converse comfortably.|$|R
500|$|By {{the time}} The Circus was released, Hollywood had {{witnessed}} {{the introduction of}} sound films. Chaplin was cynical about this new medium and the technical shortcomings it presented, believing that [...] "talkies" [...] lacked the artistry of silent films. He was also hesitant to change the formula that had brought him such success, and feared that giving the Tramp a <b>voice</b> <b>would</b> limit his international appeal. He, therefore, rejected the new Hollywood craze and began work on a new silent film. Chaplin was nonetheless anxious about this decision and remained so throughout the film's production.|$|E
500|$|Modulation {{can also}} be used to {{transmit}} the information of low-frequency analog signals at higher frequencies. This is helpful because low-frequency analog signals cannot be effectively transmitted over free space. Hence the information from a low-frequency analog signal must be impressed into a higher-frequency signal (known as the [...] "carrier wave") before transmission. There are several different modulation schemes available to achieve this [...] An example of this process is a disc jockey's voice being impressed into a 96MHz carrier wave using frequency modulation (the <b>voice</b> <b>would</b> then be received on a radio as the channel [...] "96FM"). In addition, modulation has the advantage that it may use frequency division multiplexing (FDM).|$|E
500|$|In {{writing about}} this period in his memoir, Adler {{mentions}} attending and admiring performances by Israel Grodner, a Brody singer and improvisational actor who would soon {{become one of}} the founders of professional Yiddish theater. A song of Grodner's about an old father turned away by his children would later be the germ of the idea for The Yiddish King Lear. He writes that he would have become a Brody singer, like Grodner, except [...] "I had no voice". This lack of a singing <b>voice</b> <b>would</b> be a major factor in the direction of his acting career: according to Rosenfeld, although Yiddish theater was long dominated by vaudevilles and operettas, [...] "He was the only Yiddish actor to rely entirely on classics and translations of modern European plays." ...|$|E
50|$|The duo {{made their}} first TV {{appearance}} in GMA Network's Bubble Gang on June 27, 2008, and {{have since been}} regulars in that show. Aside from Bubble Gang, they have been seen in MTV's Campus Crashers. In their TV interviews, their real voices were masked using high-pitched tones or other voices through the microphone so that their real <b>voices</b> <b>would</b> remain a mystery.|$|R
50|$|The {{second part}} opens with an alto aria that also appears in BWV 34. It {{includes}} an accompaniment of flute and muted violin in octaves. A brief secco soprano recitative leads into the closing chorus for which only soprano and bass parts are extant. As a result, {{it is unclear}} what role the other <b>voices</b> <b>would</b> play in the movement.|$|R
2500|$|In {{some ways}} the General Assembly was an {{improvement}} upon {{the institutions of the}} mother country. In 1639, noting that Parliament had not been summoned in England for a decade, the free men of Maryland passed an act to the effect that [...] "assemblies were to be called once in every three years at the least", ensuring that their <b>voices</b> <b>would</b> be regularly heard.|$|R
500|$|Lord Strathcona awarded Gauthier a {{scholarship}} in 1906 that {{allowed her to}} return to Europe and continue her vocal studies. [...] She returned there and continued both to study and give performances. [...] Her first operatic performance came in 1909 in Pavia, Italy as Micaëla in Bizet's Carmen. [...] She landed a second operatic role as Mallika in Delibes' Lakmé, which was being performed by the London Covent Garden opera company. [...] The opera opened in June 1910. [...] Supposedly, Luisa Tetrazzini, the prima donna soprano of the company, feared that Gauthier's <b>voice</b> <b>would</b> outshine her own, and demanded that Gauthier {{be removed from the}} opera. [...] The company's director acquiesced to Tetrazzini's demands, informing Gauthier on opening night that she would not be performing. Rather than give in to artistic blackmail, Gauthier quit opera entirely.|$|E
500|$|In October 2012 {{during an}} interview, Milian spoke of her Young Money debut: [...] "Wayne just gets his artists, which is great, I {{have a very}} {{one-on-one}} business relationship with everybody from Mack Maine to Wayne. They're just very {{involved in the project}} as far as bringing the music, playing songs, just giving their input. [...] I really want to pick the perfect single though. It's been a second since I've been out musically, so I do not want to fail and I don't believe in failure, so I just try new things and figure out the pieces. That's one thing that's great about Wayne. He's like, 'Work with different producers, take your time, but at the same time, try new things. Don't be stuck on one thing.'" [...] In July 2013, it was discovered that her contract with The <b>Voice</b> <b>would</b> be ended.|$|E
500|$|New {{recurring}} {{characters were}} also introduced in season five. The character of Jillian Fisher, Brian's new dimwitted girlfriend, {{was introduced in}} the episode [...] "Whistle While Your Wife Works". She provided an ironic counterpoint to Brian's intellectualism. Her final character personality was designed to be a stereotypical blonde, [...] "a bulimic cheerleader," [...] and [...] "not the brightest bauble on the tree." [...] Her <b>voice</b> <b>would</b> later play upon the bulimic cheerleader element, with actress Drew Barrymore providing the voice of Jillian in eight episodes, five of which would be in season five. Other guest stars who made multiple appearances as recurring characters from previous seasons were Carrie Fisher as Peter's boss, Angela, and Phyllis Diller as Peter's mother. Seth MacFarlane's sister, Rachael MacFarlane, also made an appearance as Olivia, the child actress, when her character was apparently killed by Stewie in the episode [...] "Chick Cancer".|$|E
6000|$|Newcomers kept {{arriving}} {{from the south}} with the question, [...] "What's up?" [...] until it got on Grubb's nerves. Londonward the crowd was constantly losing people; they would mount their various wheels with the satisfied manner of spectators who have had the best. Their <b>voices</b> <b>would</b> recede into the twilight; one would hear a laugh {{at the memory of}} this particularly salient incident or that.|$|R
5|$|The word mermaid is a {{compound}} of the Old English mere (sea), and maid (a girl or young woman). The equivalent term in Old English was merewif. They are conventionally depicted as beautiful with long flowing hair. As cited above, they are sometimes equated with the sirens of Greek mythology (especially the Odyssey), half-bird femmes fatales whose enchanting <b>voices</b> <b>would</b> lure soon-to-be-shipwrecked sailors to nearby rocks, sandbars or shoals.|$|R
