2500|$|Over {{the course}} of any {{construction}} project, the work scope may change. Change is a normal and expected part of the construction process. Changes can {{be the result of}} necessary design modifications, differing site conditions, material availability, contractor-requested changes, <b>value</b> <b>engineering</b> and impacts from third parties, to name a few. Beyond executing the change in the field, the change normally needs to be documented to show what was actually constructed. This is referred to as change management. Hence, the owner usually requires a final record to show all changes or, more specifically, any change that modifies the tangible portions of the finished work. The record is made on the contract documents – usually, but not necessarily limited to, the design drawings. The end product of this effort is what the industry terms as-built drawings, or more simply, [...] "as built." [...] The requirement for providing them is a norm in construction contracts. Construction document management is a highly important task undertaken with the aid an online or desktop software system, or maintained through physical documentation. The increasing legality pertaining to the construction industries maintenance of correct documentation has caused the increase in the need for document management systems.|$|E

2500|$|The {{feasibility}} of water savings in Egyptian agriculture was first assessed through pilot projects under the USAID-supported Egypt Water Use and Management Project (EWUP) begun in 1977. The pilots {{showed that in}} order to achieve water savings, it was important to allow farmers to participate more in irrigation management through water user associations, to provide continuous [...] flow instead of rotational flow in Mesqas, to replace individual by collective pumping, and to create an irrigation advisory service. The 1980 [...] "Strategy for Irrigation Development in Egypt up to the year 2000" [...] already envisaged the improvement of control and distribution of irrigation water as a first phase of the strategy. This was to be followed by the development of field irrigation systems and direct pricing of irrigation water. Based on the lessons of EWUP [...] and the irrigation strategy the government set out the National Irrigation Improvement Program (IIP) in 1984, which was approved by the National Assembly in 1985. Its implementation began, again with support from USAID, in eleven pilot areas, beginning with the Serri Canal with 120,000 feddan (50,400 hectares) in Minya Governorate. The project replaced the old low-lying Mesqas either with raised Mesqas, from which water would flow to the fields via gravity, or with buried pressurized pipes. The <b>Value</b> <b>Engineering</b> techniques have been used to evaluate the optimum Mesqa alternative targeting the minimum cost without affecting the quality of the alternative. By 1998 about 1,100 water user associations had been formed and systems irrigating 129,000 feddan had been modernized. The project reduced water losses, improved water quality {{at the tail end of}} mesqas, made more water available to farmers at the tail end of canals, saved land due to the smaller size of the new mesqas, reduced pumping costs by more than 50% and increased yields between 5% and 30%. Building on this success the concept of farmer participation in irrigation management was extended to branch canals with the creation of Branch Canal Water Users Association (BCWUAs) beginning in 1997 in Qemri, Bahr el Dahram and Balaqtar branch canals (Lower Egypt) and El Reity canal (Upper Egypt), as well as in Fayoum. This process was supported by two USAID-funded projects, the LIFE (Livelihood and Income from the Environment) project (2005-2008) and the Integrated Water Resources Management II project (2009-2012).|$|E

With spectrum in the 800 and 900 MHz bands coverage can be provided with fewer base station sites compared to higher frequency bands like 2. 1 and 2. 6 GHz. With more spectrum, i. e. wider bandwidth, operators can offer higher capacity and data rates. Larger bandwidths means that capacity can be provided with fewer base station sites, i. e. with lower cost. Operators that acquire more spectrum in existing or new bands can re-use existing sites for capacity build out. <b>Engineering</b> <b>value</b> {{is one way to}} estimate the marginal value of spectrum.
