40|$|Traditional {{financial}} asset lease operates in an asset provider centred mode, in which financiers passively provide financial {{solutions to the}} customers of their allied asset vendors. To capture the highly customised asset lease demands from the mass market, this paper advocates adopting a financier-led asset lease model shifting the asset lease to be customer-oriented. In this model, a financier evolves to a service integrator which can create highly customised lease options by buying proper assets from and outsourcing related services to the constituent organisations of a <b>virtual</b> <b>asset</b> network. To cater for {{the dynamics of the}} <b>virtual</b> <b>asset</b> network and customer requests, an asset delivery algorithm is proposed to ensure the on-demand asset delivery. Further, a service planning mechanism is established with a scheduling algorithm to automatically detect the changes of the business environment, and actively adapt the service outsourcing plans to these changes. Thereby, the financier can easily selects the most cost efficient outsourcing actions along the asset lease lifecycle. A hypothetical example has been conducted in the vehicle leasing domain to demonstrate how the two proposed mechanisms can be integrated to effectively and efficiently manage service outsourcing for on-demand asset delivery...|$|E

40|$|Massively {{multiplayer}} online role-playing {{games are}} growing in popularity {{with millions of}} people participating in these persistent online environments on a daily basis. Accompanying the ever-increasing subscription numbers {{is an increase in}} real money trade transactions stemming from these game worlds. The research question to be addressed in this thesis is whether transactions stemming from virtual worlds have real-world taxation consequences. The goal of this research is to determine the taxability of <b>virtual</b> <b>assets</b> obtained in structured as well as unstructured virtual environments and to attempt to establish the differences between capital and revenue receipts in these virtual realms, taking into account the nature of a receipt. The general deduction formula is applied to establish the deductibility of expenditure incurred whilst participating in these virtual environments. Sundry matters such as Value-Added Tax, donations tax, the withholding tax on gambling gains and tax avoidance will also be addressed. The methodology adopted for the research could best be described as interpretative, aimed at analysing and interpreting the relationship between real world taxes and persistent virtual worlds and the transactions that stem from participation therein. The research is based purely on documentary evidence. After applying relevant tax legislation to virtual economies it became evident that merely because <b>virtual</b> <b>assets</b> only exist in virtual reality does not necessarily preclude them real world tax consequences. It was concluded, however, that it is not practical for the South African Revenue Service to monitor all virtual world transactions or for participant taxpayers to calculate the real world value of each and every asset acquired in-world. As a result, it was concluded that real world tax consequences should only be applied in situations where participants actually convert their <b>virtual</b> <b>assets</b> into real world currency. ...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays, the {{business}} globalisation trend drives organisations to spread their busi-ness worldwide, {{which in turn}} generates vast asset demands. In this context, broader asset channels and higher financial capacities are required to boost the asset lease sector to meet the increasing asset demands [1, 2]. In this background, with the reli-able financial sources and extensive information channels, financiers are expected to take the pivot role in integrating world-wide asset information {{with the help of}} ad-vanced cooperative information systems [3, 4]. As reported by Leasing World [5], the mass market possesses vast asset lease demands that are unexplored by current lease industry. Different from conventional lease customers, the customers of the mass market prefer to lease assets with a limited volume for a short period. Furthermore, these requests substantially vary in terms of geographic locations, desired asset pack-ages, bundled services, financial assistances, etc. Unfortunately, these customer re-quests do not match with {{the business}} of traditional asset lease industry.

40|$|Different {{forecasting}} behaviors affect investors’ trading {{decisions and}} lead to qualitatively different asset price trajectories. It {{has been shown in}} the literature that the weights that investors place on observed asset price changes when forecasting future price changes, and the nature of their confidence when price changes are forecast, determine whether price bubbles, price crashes, and unpredictable price cycles occur. In this paper, we report the results of behavioral experiments involving multiple investors who participated in a market for a <b>virtual</b> <b>asset.</b> Our goal is to study investors’ forecast formation. We conducted three experimental sessions with different participants in each session. We fit different models of forecast formation to the observed data. There is strong evidence that the investors forecast future prices by extrapolating past price changes, even when they know the fundamental value of the asset exactly and the extrapolated forecasts differ significantly from the fundamental value. The rational expectations hypothesis seems inconsistent with the observed forecasts. The forecasting models of all participants that best fit the observed forecasting data were of the type that cause price bubbles and cycles in dynamical systems models, and price bubbles and cycles ended up occurring in all three sessions...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the phenomenon of buying ‘virtual assets’ for game avatars. Virtual Assets are items that are bought with real-world money for an avatar in-game; weapons, items, pets, mounts and skin customisations the most popular examples.

IPA was chosen because of its emphasis on lived experience, and each participant had subjective experiences of gaming and purchase behaviour.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is the {{valuation}} and hedging of defaultable bonds and options on defaultable bonds. The Heath/Jarrow/Morton-framework is used to model the interest rate risk, and the time of default is determined by the first jump time of a point process. In the first part, we consider valuation and hedging of a defaultable bond. The firm value process is modelled explicitly, and is used to determine the default intensity or the payout ratio after default. This means that default intensity or payout ratio are not exogenously given, but determined implicitly by the specification of the firm value process. Incompleteness of markets arises naturally, and therefore we apply the local risk-minimizing methodology introduced by Foellmer, Schweizer and Sondermann to determine a martingale measure and to calculate hedging strategies. In incomplete markets, the total risk of a contingent claim can be divided into traded risk and totally non-tradeable (intrinsic) risk. Therefore, a contingent claim cannot be hedged perfectly. We can only reduce the risk to the intrinsic component. In our model, we can hedge partly against the risk of default because we assume that the firm value is a traded asset. In the second part, we consider the valuation and hedging of options on defaultable bonds. Again, we are in an incomplete market. In addition to the traded assets, we introduce a <b>virtual</b> <b>asset</b> to the market which represents non-hedgeable risk. We derive the partial differential equation which is satisfied by the value process of the option and show how the risk-minimizing hedging strategy can be computed. (orig.)

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{two classes}} of models of boundedly rational decision makers - one with application to finance {{and the other to}} pricing. It consists of three parts. The first part of the thesis investigates the impact of investors' boundedly rational forecasting on asset price bubbles. We present a class of models, called extrapolation-correction models, of boundedly rational investor behavior. That is, the investors in our model, quite reasonably, use data available to them, i. e. past price data, to form forecasts about future prices. We relate the model parameters to various behavioral aspects like investor memory, caution/confidence, and panic. We present the resulting dynamical system model of asset price bubbles and relate the behavior of the dynamical system to the parameters capturing investor forecasting behavior. We show that, depending on the behavioral parameters, the associated dynamical system can converge to the fundamental value, go into predictable price cycles, or go into unpredictable price cycles. In particular, we find that the greater the weight investors' forecasts put on the most recent observations, the greater the tendency for the asset prices to exhibit cycles, forming positive and negative bubbles. We also find that when forecasts are strongly affected by recent prices, the price process becomes chaotic and it becomes increasingly difficult to forecast future prices accurately. The second part of the thesis addresses the question: How do investors make their price forecasts? We present the design of an experiment where investors participate in a <b>virtual</b> <b>asset</b> market run over a computer network. During the course of the experiment, the participants report their price forecasts and enter buy and sell orders. The computer software determines the market clearing prices. Despite full disclosure of the assets' dividends and the fundamental value, the price trajectories in all three experimental sessions exhibited cycles. We calibrated various models, including rational expectations based models and the extrapolation-correction family of models presented {{in the first part of}} the thesis. The results indicate that rational expectations hypothesis does not provide an accurate model of forecast formation. Moreover, a simple one-parameter exponential smoothing model is much better at modeling forecast formation, with the extrapolation-correction models making the fit slightly better. The third part of the thesis explores a different aspect of customer rationality - that of customer impatience - and its effect on pricing of product versions. We consider a setting in which impatient customers are faced with frequent product introductions, for example, products like Apple iPhones. This raises the following questions regarding customers: Given the pricing strategy of the firm, what are the optimal buying behaviors of the customers? How does customer buying behavior change in relation to impatience? We consider two settings. In the first setting, the firm offers a trade-in price for existing customers and a higher full price for new customers. In the second setting, the firm offers the same prices to new and existing customers, however there is an introductory full price and a discounted price later in the product cycle. We model the customer's problem in these two settings and characterize their optimal actions as a function of the price parameters. We also analyze the bilevel program for the firm's pricing decisions. We see that in both settings considered there are certain well-defined regions in the price space wherein the firm's optimal decision lies. We also provide some numerical computations to study the behavior of the optimal prices as the cost per unit increases. Ph. D...|$|E
