50|$|Robert <b>van</b> <b>t</b> <b>Hoff</b> (November 5, 1887 - April 25, 1979), born Robbert <b>van</b> <b>t</b> <b>Hoff,</b> was a Dutch {{architect}} and furniture designer. His Villa Henny, designed in 1914, {{was one of}} the earliest modernist houses {{and one of the first}} to be built out of reinforced concrete. From 1917 he was an influential member of the De Stijl movement.|$|E
5000|$|Although he {{was born}} to a {{comfortable}} middle-class background, married a wealthy heiress, {{and for a while}} was able to subsidise the publication of the De Stijl journal, <b>van</b> <b>t</b> <b>Hoff</b> {{was a member of the}} Communist Party of the Netherlands in the years following World War I. Following the failure of Pieter Jelles Troelstras call for a socialist revolution in the Netherlands in 1919, <b>van</b> <b>t</b> <b>Hoff</b> split from De Stijls founder Theo van Doesburg and withdrew from artistic activity, declaring himself an [...] "ex-architect" [...] in 1922, and spending much of the rest of his life promoting experimental anarchist communities.|$|E

50|$|The {{concept of}} tetrahedrally bound carbon in organic {{compounds}} stems {{back to the}} work by <b>van</b> <b>t</b> <b>Hoff</b> and Le Bel in 1874.

40|$|We {{present a}} study of the {{adsorption}} of a positively charged protein to a positively charged spherical polyelectrolyte brush SPB by isothermal titration calorimetry ITC. ITC is used to determine the adsorption isotherm as a function of temperature and of salt concentration at physiological pH 7. 2. At low ionic strength, RNase A is strongly adsorbed by the SPB particles despite the fact that both the SPB particles and the protein are positively charged. Virtually no adsorption takes place when the ionic strength is raised through added salt. This is strong evidence for counterion release as the primary driving force for protein adsorption. We calculated that amp; 8764; 2 counterions were released upon RNase A binding. The adsorption of RNase A into like charged SPB particles is entropy driven, and protein protonation was not significant. Temperature dependent measurements showed a disagreement between the enthalpy derived via the <b>van</b> <b>t</b> <b>Hoff</b> equation and the calorimetric enthalpy. Further analysis shows that <b>van</b> <b>t</b> <b>Hoff</b> analysis leads to the correct enthalpy of adsorption. The additional contributions to the measured enthalpy are potentially sourced from unlinked equilibria such as conformational changes that do not contribute to the binding equilibriu...|$|E

Their vapor pressure, solubility and indirectly Henry. s law constants {{are the most important}} parameters defining their fate during transport of these compounds. Especially in the air-water exchange process, Henry. s law constant plays an important role. Therefore accurate and direct measurement of the Henry. s law constant are required for the most of the compound present in the environment. In this study 17 organochlorine pesticides. Henry. s law constants were measured by a dynamic equilibration method at 5, 15, 20, 25 and 35 a 1 C in deionized water. The variation in H with temperature was expressed using the <b>van.</b> <b>t</b> <b>Hoff</b> type Gibbs-Helmhotz equation. Calculated enthalpy of phase change for each compound, which helps to describe how sensitive is the partitioning between air and water, within the range of the values reported in the literature. In Gibbs-Helmhotz plots, H values of a compound in saline water were always higher than the H values of that compound in deionized water. Therefore, it was concluded that in the saline water, the air-water partition of these chemicals is shifted to air phase...|$|E

Based on batch adsorption studies, {{it was observed that}} the phenol was completely adsorbed by coal depending on time of adsorption and the S/L ratio. From these results, the maximum adsorption values on the time axis at various S/L ratios were used and the fractions of phenol receptive adsorption sites on coal surfaces were calculated as 60 % and 43 % for Soma and Yataan coals, respectively. Freundlich adsorption isotherm was found to describe the adsorption of phenol on lignitic coals well. The Langmuir model did not describe the system as good as Freundlich model most probably due to the monolayer coverage assumption on this model. Activation energy and the maximum heat of adsorption calculated using adsorption data at different temperatures by the Arrhenious and <b>Van.</b> <b>t</b> <b>Hoff</b> equations were 10. 3 and - 20. 2 kJ/mol, respectively. The low energies suggest that the adsorption of phenol on these lignitic coals were through physical interactions. An adsorption mechanism of phenol on lignite was discussed based on these findings. Residual water quality following adsorption in terms of major elements and heavy metals was within acceptable limits defined for wastewaters. The amount of organic matters dissolved from coals were also negligable. The presence of heavy metals as Cu, Zn etc. in water as a contaminant was also found to affect the removal of phenol by about 10 - 20 %...|$|E
