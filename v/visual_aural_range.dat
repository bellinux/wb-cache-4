Designed in 1937 at the Bureau of Air Commerce's research center, this system operated in the VHF band around 63 mHz and was an incremental improvement over prior aviation navigation systems such as the four-course radio range. VAR was later redeveloped into VOR.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine {{preferred}} learning styles of undergraduate medical students at King Saud Bin Abdul Aziz University for Health Sciences, King Fahad Medical College, Saudi Arabia. Methods: A cross sectional study of preclinical students with 74 male and 72 female (n= 146) was performed. The validated VARK questionnaire was used to categorize the learning styles of students. The questionnaire consists of 16 items which identify four different learning styles: <b>visual,</b> <b>aural,</b> reading/writing and kinesthetic. Descriptive statistics were used to identify the learning styles of students. Results: The response rate was 70 The results showed that 5. 5 11. 6 2. 1 and 8. 2 of students only preferred the <b>visual,</b> <b>aural,</b> reading/writing and kinesthetic modes, respectively. A further analysis showed that 72. 6 of students preferred multiple learning styles. Conclusions: The results of this study can provide useful information for improving the quality of the teaching and learning experiences of students. However, more research on this topic needs to be undertaken before the association between learning style preferences and teaching and learning strategies is more clearly understood...|$|R

50|$|In Word-Music, Professor Guetti draws {{attention}} to two aspects of modern literature: <b>visual</b> and <b>aural.</b> With <b>visual</b> reading, the reader looks for a sensible meaning in the narrative. Scenes, colors, and other visual images are understood as being in a sequence. The reader's mind thereby actively creates a story that {{can be understood as}} an arrangement of a meaningful series of <b>visual</b> events. <b>Aural</b> reading, on the other hand is receptive. The reader is listening to a story. Elements of the narrative are not necessarily sequential. There can be repetitions or variations on a theme, as in music. The story is more playful than purposeful. Most works of modern fiction combine <b>visual</b> and <b>aural</b> ways of reading, being not exclusively one or the other. This analysis of the complicated response of the individual reader is in contrast to the usual concern with plot, characterization, and other textual topics.|$|R

An aesthetic model is developed to integrate <b>visual</b> and <b>aural</b> cues (aesthetic fields) to evaluate the aesthetic intensity curve which is associated with the film’s narrative structure.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{audiovisual}} presentation system, called PhotoSense, to enrich photo navigation experience by associating emotionally harmonic {{music with a}} given photo collection. Different from many conventional photo visual-ization systems which predominantly focus on the visual ele-ments for presentation, we explore both <b>visual</b> and <b>aural</b> per-spectives which can enhance the browsing experience from each other. This is achieved by building an emotion space shared by <b>visual</b> and <b>aural</b> domains, {{and a set of}} emotion classifiers which can associate each <b>visual</b> and <b>aural</b> element with this space. Furthermore, we design a sequence match-ing algorithm to associate a set of music with a photo collec-tion by maximizing similarity in the emotion space. Photo-Sense represents one of the first mash-up applications which build a natural connection between the ever increasing per-sonal photo collections on the Web and music-sharing sites. Experiments show that PhotoSense provides better browsing experience for photo collections. Index Terms — Multimedia presentation, affective con-tent analysis, emotion...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The aims of {{our study}} were to measure the {{learning}} style preferences of chiropractic students and to assess whether they differ across the 5 years of chiropractic study. Methods: A total of 407 (41. 4 % females) full-degree, undergraduate, and postgraduate students enrolled in an Australian chiropractic program {{agreed to participate in}} a cross-sectional survey comprised of basic demographic information and the <b>Visual,</b> <b>Aural,</b> Read/Write, Kinesthetic (VARK) questionnaire, which identifies learning preferences on four different subscales: <b>visual,</b> <b>aural,</b> reading/writing, and kinesthetic. Multivariate analysis of variance and the X² test were used to check for differences in continuous (VARK scores) and categorical (VARK category preference) outcome variables. Results: The majority of chiropractic students (56. 0 %) were found to be multimodal learners. Compared to the other learning styles preferences, kinesthetic learning was preferred by a significantly greater proportion of students (65. 4 %, p <. 001) and received a significantly greater mean VARK score (5. 66 ± 2. 47, p <. 001). Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} chiropractic students have been shown to be largely multimodal learners with a preference for kinesthetic learning. While this knowledge may be beneficial in the structuring of future curricula, more thorough research must be conducted to show any beneficial relationship between learning style preferences and teaching methods 7 page(s...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{two related}} pedagogies for design education – one for teaching visual {{design and the}} other for teaching sound composition – in which the symbols and organizational principles of aural experience are transformed to the visual domain and vice versa. The purpose of the pedagogies is to develop in the student the ability to visualize and auralize from direct observation as an alternative to copying and modifying existing designs. The paper begins with a discussion of <b>visual</b> and <b>aural</b> perception and their relationship to thinking and imagination. The author then describes the use of semiotic transformation in teaching courses in sound composition and visual design. 1 Educating the <b>Visual</b> and <b>Aural</b> Designer Teachers in the <b>visual</b> and <b>aural</b> arts often misunderstand the principles of education required for applied designers in contrast to those used to train fine artists. Although fine artists often base their work on self expression, playful novelty, or conscious copying from an established tradition, the applied artist is usually in the position of designing a structure which communicates information {{to meet the needs of}} an external client. Thus training for the designer, whether a designer of sound or image, must include learning to think of <b>visual</b> and <b>aural</b> structures as solutions to design problems.
