5|$|Cervical {{agenesis}} {{is a rare}} congenital {{condition in}} which the cervix completely fails to develop, often associated with the concurrent failure of the <b>vagina</b> to develop. Other congenital cervical abnormalities exist, often associated with abnormalities of the <b>vagina</b> and uterus. The cervix may be duplicated in situations such as bicornuate uterus and uterine didelphys.|$|E
5|$|Females {{have two}} {{openings}} located under {{the edge of}} the mantle in the mantle cavity: the opening of the <b>vagina</b> and an opening for laying eggs. The <b>vagina</b> accepts the sperm during copulation. The <b>vagina</b> is connected to the bursa copulatrix and to the spermatheca (for storing sperm). The other opening is for laying eggs. Egg cells originate in the ovary. Egg cells travel through the oviduct to the fertilization chamber, where fertilization occur. Eggs then develop in the glandular uterus. A capsule is formed in the diverticulum next to the uterus. The eggs are then laid.|$|E
5|$|In Bruce Bagemihl's {{survey of}} The Zoological Record (1978–1997)– which {{contains}} {{over a million}} documents from over 6,000 scientific journals– 539 articles focusing on the penis were found, while 7 were found focusing on the clitoris. In 2000, researchers Shirley Ogletree and Harvey Ginsberg concluded {{that there is a}} general neglect of the word clitoris in common vernacular. They looked at the terms used to describe genitalia in the PsycINFO database from 1887 to 2000 and found that penis was used in 1,482 sources, <b>vagina</b> in 409, while clitoris was only mentioned in 83. They additionally analyzed 57 books listed in a computer database for sex instruction. In the majority of the books, penis was the most commonly discussed body part– mentioned more than clitoris, <b>vagina,</b> and uterus put together. They last investigated terminology used by college students, ranging from Euro-American (76%/76%), Hispanic (18%/14%), and African American (4%/7%), regarding the students' beliefs about sexuality and knowledge on the subject. The students were overwhelmingly educated to believe that the <b>vagina</b> is the female counterpart of the penis. The authors found that the students' belief that the inner portion of the <b>vagina</b> is the most sexually sensitive part of the female body correlated with negative attitudes toward masturbation and strong support for sexual myths.|$|E

5|$|Adjuvant {{radiotherapy}} {{is commonly}} used in early-stage (stage I or II) endometrial cancer. It can be delivered through vaginal brachytherapy (VBT), which is becoming the preferred route due to its reduced toxicity, or external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). Brachytherapy involves placing a radiation source in the organ affected; {{in the case of}} endometrial cancer a radiation source is placed directly in the <b>vagina.</b> External beam radiotherapy involves a beam of radiation aimed at the affected area from outside the body. VBT is used to treat any remaining cancer solely in the <b>vagina,</b> whereas EBRT can be used to treat remaining cancer elsewhere in the pelvis following surgery. However, the benefits of adjuvant radiotherapy are controversial. Though EBRT significantly reduces the rate of relapse in the pelvis, overall survival and metastasis rates are not improved. VBT provides a better quality of life than EBRT.|$|E
5|$|Brachytherapy {{can also}} be used in the {{treatment}} of tumours of the brain, eye, head and neck region (lip, floor of mouth, tongue, nasopharynx and oropharynx), respiratory tract (trachea and bronchi), digestive tract (oesophagus, gall bladder, bile-ducts, rectum, anus), urinary tract (bladder, urethra, penis), female reproductive tract (uterus, <b>vagina,</b> vulva), and soft tissues.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Previous {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that a recently described anaerobic bacterium, Atopobium <b>vaginae</b> is associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV). Thus far the four isolates of this fastidious micro-organism were found to be highly resistant to metronidazole and susceptible for clindamycin, two antibiotics preferred for the treatment of BV. Methods Nine strains of Atopobium <b>vaginae,</b> four strains of Gardnerella vaginalis, two strains of Lactobacillus iners and one strain each of Bifidobacterium breve, B. longum, L. crispatus, L. gasseri and L. jensenii were tested against 15 antimicrobial agents using the Etest. Results All nine strains of A. <b>vaginae</b> were highly resistant to nalidixic acid and colistin while being inhibited by low concentrations of clindamycin (range: G. vaginalis strains were also susceptible for clindamycin (256 μg/ml) but susceptible to clindamycin (0. 023 – 0. 125 μg/ml). Conclusion Clindamycin has higher activity against G. vaginalis and A. <b>vaginae</b> than metronidazole, but not all A. <b>vaginae</b> isolates are metronidazole resistant, as seemed to be a straightforward conclusion from previous studies on a more limited number of strains. </p...|$|R

5|$|Physical sexual {{stimulation}} of the clitoris {{is the most common}} way for women to achieve orgasm; general statistics indicate that 70–80 percent of women require direct clitoral stimulation (consistent manual, oral or other concentrated friction against the external parts of the clitoris) to reach orgasm, though indirect clitoral stimulation (for example, via vaginal penetration) may also be sufficient for female orgasm. The area near the entrance of the <b>vagina</b> (the lower third) contains nearly 90percent of the vaginal nerve endings, and there are areas in the anterior vaginal wall and between the top junction of the labia minora and the urethra that are especially sensitive, but intense sexual pleasure, including orgasm, solely from vaginal stimulation is occasional or otherwise absent because the <b>vagina</b> has significantly fewer nerve endings than the clitoris.|$|E

40|$|Background: Atopobium <b>vaginae</b> and Gardnerella vaginalis {{are major}} markers for {{bacterial}} vaginosis. We aimed {{to determine the}} MIC and MBC range of the broad-spectrum anti-infective and antiseptic dequalinium chloride for 28 strains, belonging to 4 species of the genus Atopobium, i. e. A. <b>vaginae,</b> A. minutum, A. rimae and A. parvulum. Methods: The MIC was determined with a broth microdilution assay. Results: The MIC and MBC for Atopobium spp. for dequalinium chloride ranged between < 0. 0625 and 2 μg/ml.

5|$|Female {{cats are}} {{seasonally}} polyestrous, {{which means they}} may have many periods of heat {{over the course of}} a year, the season beginning in spring and ending in late autumn. Heat periods occur about every two weeks and last about 4 to 7 days. Multiple males will be attracted to a female in heat. The males will fight over her, and the victor wins the right to mate. At first, the female rejects the male, but eventually the female allows the male to mate. The female utters a loud yowl as the male pulls out of her because a male cat's penis has a band of about 120–150 backwards-pointing penile spines, which are about 1mm long; upon withdrawal of the penis, the spines rake the walls of the female's <b>vagina,</b> which acts to induce ovulation. This act also occurs to clear the <b>vagina</b> of other sperm in the context of a second (or more) mating, thus giving the later males a larger chance of conception.|$|E

40|$|As {{bacterial}} vaginosis (BV) {{is a potential}} cause of obstetric complications and gynecological disorders, there is substantial interest in establishing the most effective treatment. Standard treatment - metronidazole or clindamycin, by either vaginal or oral route – is followed by relapses in about 30 % of cases, within a month from treatment completion. This inability to prevent recurrences reflects our lack of knowledge {{on the origins of}} BV. Atopobium <b>vaginae</b> has been recently reported to be associated with BV in around 80 % of the cases and might be involved in the therapeutic failures. This review looks at the potential benefits of nifuratel against A. <b>vaginae</b> compared to the standard treatments with metronidazole and clindamycin. In vitro, nifuratel is able to inhibit the growth of A. <b>vaginae,</b> with a MIC range of 0. 125 - 1 µg/mL; it is active against G. vaginalis and does not affect lactobacilli. Metronidazole is active against A. <b>vaginae</b> only at very high concentrations (8 - 256 µg/mL); it is partially active against G. vaginalis and also has no effect on lactobacilli. Clindamycin acts against A. <b>vaginae</b> with an MIC lower than 0. 125 µg/mL and is active on G. vaginalis but it also affects lactobacilli, altering the vaginal environment. These observations suggest that nifuratel is probably the most valid therapeutic agent for BV treatment...|$|R
