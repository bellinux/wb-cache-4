40|$|Introduction: Various grafts {{have been}} used in the {{treatment}} of urinary incontinence and pelvic prolapse. Autologous materials such as muscle and fascia were first utilized to provide additional anatomic support to the periurethral and pelvic tissues; however, attempts to minimize the invasiveness of the procedures have led to the use of synthetic materials. Complications such as infection and erosion or extrusion associated with these materials may be troublesome to manage. We review the literature and describe a brief overview of grafts used in pelvic floor reconstruction and focus on the management complications specifically related to synthetic materials. Materials and Methods: We performed a comprehensive review of the literature on grafts used in pelvic floor surgery using MEDLINE and resources cited in those peer-reviewed manuscripts. The results are presented. Results: Biologic materials provide adequate cure rates but have associated downfalls including potential complications from harvesting, variable tissue quality and cost. The use of synthetic materials as an alternative graft in pelvic floor repairs has become a popular option. Of all synthetic materials, the type I macroporous polypropylene meshes have demonstrated superiority in terms of efficacy and fewer complication rates due to their structure and composition. Erosion and extrusion of mesh are common and troublesome complications that may be managed conservatively with observation with or without local hormone therapy, with transvaginal debridement or with surgical exploration and total mesh excision, dependent upon the location of the mesh and the mesh type utilized. Conclusions: The ideal graft would provide structural integrity and durability with minimal adverse reaction by the host tissue. Biologic materials in general tend to have fewer associated complications, however, the risks of harvesting, <b>variable</b> <b>integrity</b> of allografts, availability and high cost has led to the development and use of synthetic grafts. Synthetic grafts have a tendency to cause higher rates of erosion and extrusion; however, these complications can be managed successfully...|$|E

40|$|The {{presynaptic}} protein α-synuclein {{is involved}} in several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD). In rare familial forms of PD, causal mutations (PARK 1) as well as multiplications (PARK 4) of the α-synuclein gene have been identified. In sporadic, idiopathic PD, abnormal accumulation and deposition of α-synuclein might also cause degeneration of dopaminergic midbrain neurons, the clinically most relevant neuronal population in PD. Thus, cell-specific quantification of α-synuclein expression-levels in dopaminergic neurons from idiopathic PD patients in comparison to controls would provide essential information about contributions of α-synuclein to the etiology of PD. However, a number of previous studies addressing this question at the tissue-level yielded varying results regarding α-synuclein expression. To increase specificity, we developed a cell-specific approach for mRNA quantification that also took into account the important issue of <b>variable</b> RNA <b>integrities</b> of the individual human postmortem brain samples. We demonstrate that PCR –amplicon size can confound quantitative gene-expression analysis, in particular of partly degraded RNA. By combining optimized UV-laser microdissection- and quantitative RT–PCR-techniques with suitable PCR assays, we detected significantly elevated α-synuclein mRNA levels in individual, surviving neuromelanin- and tyrosine hydroxylase-positive substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons from idiopathic PD brains compared to controls.

At present, nonbioresorbable and bioresorbable membranes are the two main types of barrier membranes available [10].

However, neither is ideal for use in GBR. Although the e-PTFE membrane has been confirmed to have excellent biocompatibility in many studies, it requires a second surgical procedure for its removal because of its nonresorbability. On the other hand, the collagen membrane is resorbable, but it has inherent disadvantages, such as poor structural <b>integrity,</b> <b>variable</b> degradation rates and host immune reactivity [13].

Little research has been done in South Africa into the construct of integrity. Employee performance and productivity are vital for companies and employers should be made aware of the risks of unethical behaviour within such companies. Attempts should be made to reduce these risks. Research has been focused on two sets of factors that prompt counterproductive behaviour, namely personality dimensions and situational factors. Limited sources that describe the association between integrity and personality are available on the African continent. Research has indicated that individuals who score lower on integrity indicate a greater likelihood of committing theft and vandalism than individuals with higher scores. The objective of this research was to determine the relationship between integrity and personality traits. The study population consisted of 145 individuals who formed part of the same recruitment process for appointment as security guards. The Contextual Performance Scale, a newly developed South African measure of integrity in the work setting, and the Work Style Questionnaire were administered. Canonical correlation and moderated regression analyses were carried out to assess the relationship of personality <b>variables</b> to <b>integrity.</b> The results indicate that a person with high integrity is someone who is relatively persuasive and very self-assured; he will be very much focused on detail - systematic, precise, accurate and able to pick up omissions quickly, he will respect authority, be hardworking, conscientious and trustworthy. This person was further shown to be able to plan and prepare ahead, and to take into consideration the consequences of decisions. A person with integrity can readily adapt to new situations and accept change without adapting his moral values. This employee can be relied upon and is unlikely to engage in counterproductive behaviour. Master...|$|R

The framework provides a ‘cradle-to-grave’ approach to structural analysis of a component, where structural integrity encompasses all phases of its lifespan. The methodology examines the holistic structural design of aircraft components by integrating fatigue and damage tolerance methodologies. It accomplishes this by marrying the load inputs from a fatigue analysis for new design, into a risk analysis for an existing design. The risk analysis incorporates the variability found from literature, including recorded defects, loadings, and material strength properties. The methodology is verified via formal conceptualization of the structures, which are demonstrated on an actual hydraulic accumulator and an engine nacelle inlet. The hydraulic accumulator is examined for structural integrity utilizing different base materials undergoing <b>variable</b> amplitude loading. <b>Integrity</b> is accomplished through a risk analysis by means of fault tree analysis. The engine nacelle inlet uses the damage tolerance philosophy for a sonic fatigue condition undergoing both constant amplitude loading and a theoretical flight design case. Residual strength changes are examined throughout crack growth, where structural integrity is accomplished through a risk analysis of component strength versus probability of failure. Both methodologies can be applied to nearly any structural application, not necessarily limited to aerospace. M. S...|$|R

Further, cannabis-related changes may be moderated by FAAH genotype (rs 324420). We examined {{the association between}} cannabis use and FAAH genotype on frontolimbic WM integrity in adolescents and emerging adults. We then tested whether observed WM abnormalities were linked with depressive or apathy symptoms. MethodsParticipants included 37 cannabis users and 37 healthy controls (33 female; ages 18 – 25). Multiple regressions examined the independent and interactive effects of <b>variables</b> on WM <b>integrity.</b> ResultsRegular cannabis users demonstrated reduced WM integrity in the bilateral uncinate fasciculus (UNC) (MD, right: p = . 009 and left: p = . 009; FA, right: p = . 04 and left: p = . 03) and forceps minor (fMinor) (MD, p = . 03) compared to healthy controls. Marginally reduced WM integrity in the cannabis users {{was found in the}} left anterior thalamic radiation (ATR) (FA, p = . 08). Cannabis group ∗ FAAH genotype interaction predicted WM integrity in bilateral ATR (FA, right: p = . 05 and left: p = . 001) and fMinor (FA, p = . 02).

40|$|Claimed {{benefits}} of riparian forest {{cover for the}} aquatic ecosystem include purification, thermal control, organic matter input and habitat provision, which may improve physicochemical and biotic quality. However, these beneficial effects might be flawed by multiple stressor conditions of intensive agriculture and urbanization in upstream catchments. We {{examined the relationship between}} riparian forest cover and physicochemical quality and biotic integrity indices in extensive large scale datasets. Measurements of hydromorphological conditions and riparian forest cover across different buffer widths for 59  ×  103 river stretches covering 230  ×  103 km of the French river network were coupled with data for physicochemical and biotic variables taken from the national monitoring network. General linear and quantile regression techniques were used to determine responses of physicochemical <b>variables</b> and biological <b>integrity</b> indices for macroinvertebrates and fish to riparian forest cover in selections of intermediate stress for 2 nd to 4 th order streams. Significant responses to forest cover were found for the nutrient variables and biological indices. According to these responses a 60 % riparian forest cover in the 10 m buffer corresponds to good status boundaries for physicochemical and biotic elements. For the 30 m buffer, the observed response suggests that riparian forest coverage of at least 45 % corresponds with good ecological status in the aquatic ecosystem. The observed consistent responses indicate significant potential for improving the quality of the aquatic environment by restoring riparian forest. The effects are more substantial in single-stressor environments but remain significant in multi-stressor environments...|$|R
40|$|Selective Laser Melting (SLM) as {{a method}} of netshape {{manufacture}} is of growing interest within the aerospace industry. There is currently a lack of understanding of the influence of process <b>variables</b> on the <b>integrity</b> and properties of the as fabricated material. The research presented investigates the SLM fabrication of three nickel superalloys: Primarily CM 247 LC and CMSX 486 /IN 625 as secondary alloys. CM 247 LC is Ni-base superalloy hardenable by the precipitation of the coherent γ'phase. It presents a particular challenge due to weld-crack susceptibility. This research aims to establish a processing route for CM 247 LC components via SLM: Parametric studies are presented to quantitatively assess the cracking behaviour based on microstructural observations; Hot Isostatic Pressing HIPping) has been investigated as a retro-fix solution to cracking; Electron BackScatter Diffraction (EBSD), MicroCT Tomography and microscopy have been used to characterise the SLM microstructure. The γ' evolution through the manufacturing stages (SLM & Heat Treatment) has been examined. Mechanical testing creep/tensile) was performed for comparison against cast material. Research was extended to two additional alloys: CMSX 486 and IN 625. Statistical design of experiments methodology was used to rapidly establish process parameters for these two alloys and assess them by mechanical testing. In conclusion a processing route capable of yielding fully dense material with a satisfactory γ' structure is presented; however, it involves significant post-fabrication processing which reduces the attractiveness of SLM. Further research is suggested, specifically into modelling and thermal measurement of SLM...|$|R
40|$|Information {{security}} is a complex issue, which is very critical for success of modern businesses. It can be implemented {{with the help of}} well-tested global standards and best practices. However, it has been studied that the human aspects of information security compliance pose significant challenge to its practitioners. There has been significant interest in the recent past on how human compliance to information security policy can be achieved in an organization. Various models have been proposed by these researchers. However, there are very few models that have tried to link human commitment attributes with information security governance of an organization. The research problem {{of this study was to}} identify the security controls and mechanisms to govern information security effectively. The proposed model was based on agency theory and comprises a relationship between human commitment <b>variables</b> (ethics, <b>integrity</b> and trust) with security governance variables (structural, relational and process) referred as systemic variables in the research. The resulting correlation is further related with governance objectives (goal congruence and reducing information asymmetry) to hypothesize an effective information security in an organization. The research model proposed was tested employing confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM). There were four models tested in this research. The first model (initial measurement model) comprised human variables linked with relational and the systemic variables linked with goal congruence and information asymmetry. This model could not get through the CFA tests. A modified model comprising human and systemic attributes related with goal congruence and information asymmetry, separately, was taken forward to SEM. This model returned low model fitment scores and hence two alternate models were tested. In the first alternative, the human attributes were related with goal congruence and systemic attributes were linked with information asymmetry. In the second alternative, the relationships of the first alternatives were retained and two alternate relationships were introduced - integrity was linked with information asymmetry and structural was linked with goal congruence. Both models are very close to good model fitment scores. However, the second alternative returned better results and hence, was chosen as the final outcome of the research. The model reflects that human attributes and systemic attributes are fairly independent in an effective information security framework, and drive goal congruence and information asymmetry, respectively. However, integrity is an important human commitment for ensuring information asymmetry and the right organizational structure and roles are important for ensuring goal congruence...|$|R
40|$|AIM: Veredas and {{the aquatic}} and {{semi-aquatic}} communities {{play a key}} role in watershed protection in the Cerrado Biome. Information about the effects of physical and chemical <b>variables</b> and habitat <b>integrity</b> on benthic communities has been increased in recent years; however, there is no study evaluating the influence of urbanization on macroinvertebrates of Vereda streams. Thus, improving the knowledge of the relationship between abiotic properties and benthic fauna is very important for understanding the functioning of ecological processes and health of aquatic ecosystems. This study investigated the influence of physical and chemical variables on benthic macroinvertebrate communities along a gradient of anthropogenic disturbance in four Vereda streams in Uberlândia (MG), one in a preserved area and three in the urban area; METHODS: samplings were collected during the dry and rainy seasons; RESULTS: principal component analysis separated the stream in the preserved area from those in the urban area by having lower values of BOD, COD, sediment size, conductivity, detergents, pH, deposited solids and total dissolved solids. Pollution sensitive groups (e. g., Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera) were associated to the stream in the preserved area, and more tolerant groups (e. g., Chironomidae and Oligochaeta) had greater abundance in the streams of the urban area. Canonical Correspondence Analysis indicated that dissolved oxygen, conductivity, BOD, oil and grease, and turbidity explained 56 % of the variance in the distribution and abundance of macroinvertebrates; CONCLUSIONS: Benthic communities of Vereda streams in urban areas in the Cerrado Biome seem to be highly affected by human activities that increase water organic pollution and sedimentation...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{heaviest}} {{period of}} cannabis use coincides with ongoing white matter (WM) maturation. Further, cannabis-related changes may be moderated by FAAH genotype (rs 324420). We examined {{the association between}} cannabis use and FAAH genotype on frontolimbic WM integrity in adolescents and emerging adults. We then tested whether observed WM abnormalities were linked with depressive or apathy symptoms. Methods: Participants included 37 cannabis users and 37 healthy controls (33 female; ages 18 – 25). Multiple regressions examined the independent and interactive effects of <b>variables</b> on WM <b>integrity.</b> Results: Regular cannabis users demonstrated reduced WM integrity in the bilateral uncinate fasciculus (UNC) (MD, right: p = . 009 and left: p = . 009; FA, right: p = . 04 and left: p = . 03) and forceps minor (fMinor) (MD, p = . 03) compared to healthy controls. Marginally reduced WM integrity in the cannabis users {{was found in the}} left anterior thalamic radiation (ATR) (FA, p = . 08). Cannabis group ∗ FAAH genotype interaction predicted WM integrity in bilateral ATR (FA, right: p = . 05 and left: p = . 001) and fMinor (FA, p = . 02). In cannabis users, poorer WM integrity was correlated with increased symptoms of depression and apathy in bilateral ATR and UNC. Conclusions: Consistent with prior findings, cannabis use was associated with reduced frontolimbic WM integrity. WM integrity was also moderated by FAAH genotype, in that cannabis-using FAAH C/C carriers and A carrying controls had reduced WM integrity compared to control C/C carriers. Observed frontolimbic white matter abnormalities were linked with increased depressive and apathy symptoms in the cannabis users...|$|R
