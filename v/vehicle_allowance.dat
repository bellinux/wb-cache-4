5000|$|In 2009, U.S. District Judge Susan Illston {{ruled against}} the BLM's {{proposed}} designation of additional off-road <b>vehicle</b> use <b>allowance</b> {{in the western}} Mojave Desert. According to the ruling, the BLM violated its own regulations when it designated approximately 5000 mi of off-roading routes in 2006. According to Judge Ilston, the BLM's designation was significantly [...] "flawed {{because it does not}} contain a reasonable range of alternatives" [...] to limit damage to sensitive habitat. Judge Illston found that the bureau had inadequately analyzed the routes' impacts on air quality, soils, plant communities, riparian habitats, and sensitive species such as the endangered Mojave fringe-toed lizard, pointing out that the desert and its resources are [...] "extremely fragile, easily scarred, and slowly healed." ...|$|R

The purpose of the quantitative correlation study was to explore gender-based compensation inequities within the U. S. construction industry using archived survey data gathered in 2007 during the Construction Management Association of America annual conference in Las Vegas, Nevada. By employing descriptive and correlation analysis, compensation factors were analyzed that found gender-wage inequities for specific compensation factors in the construction industry and four significant relationships between compensation factors and gender. Inequities were identified in the descriptive analysis of compensation factors that included (a) base salary; (b) additional compensation; (c) base increase per year; (d) educational background; (e) time off; (f) tuition benefits; (g) vehicle allowance; and (h) retirement benefits. The compensation factors that favored men were additional compensation, base increase per year, educational background, time-off, and <b>vehicle</b> <b>allowance,</b> while base salary and retirement benefits favored women.

5000|$|Vaughn cut to {{the crux}} of the matter when he met with Peace Corps Staff in Nigeria. [...] "I never get letters of {{complaint}} from Volunteers who are busy doing something," [...] Vaughn said, [...] "who are teaching thirty hours a week." [...] Vaughn thought that too many volunteers were more concerned with proposed reductions in the living <b>allowances,</b> <b>vehicle</b> restrictions, and the closing of hostels than with the work they had come to do. [...] "Stay where the Nigerians stay," [...] said Vaughn. [...] "The Peace Corps is not in the hotel business. Forget the motorbikes the Peace Corps gave you in a period of misguided generosity. Travel with the Africans or better yet stay in your town and get to know the people rather than escaping on weekends to visit other volunteers." [...] Vaughn traveled with two reporters from the [...] "Peace Corps Volunteer" [...] magazine, a monthly magazine that went out to Peace Corps Volunteers worldwide. [...] The December, 1966 issue of [...] "Peace Corps Volunteer" [...] contained a report on Vaughn's trip and the issues in Nigeria.|$|R
