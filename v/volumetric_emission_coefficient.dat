40|$|A {{new test}} case, using a quasi-similar {{methodology}} and experimental set-up than previous test case 1, {{is presented in}} this paper. An inductively coupled plasma torch, work-ing at atmospheric pressure, is used to create CO 2 –N 2 Martian-like plasma (97 % CO 2 – 3 % N 2). The operating frequency and power are 64 MHz and 3 kW respectively. This kind of apparatus allows obtaining plasma in chem-ical and quasi-thermal equilibrium. The plasma charac-terization will consist firstly to determining the chemi-cal composition; a calculation code based on the Gibbs free energy minimization is used. Secondly, the radial temperature profiles will be given through Abel inversion of atomic and molecular systems. The spectral measure-ments cover the [250 – 800] nm range and are performed inside the induction coil. Each interesting spectrum is Abel-inverted and calibrated {{in order to determine}} the <b>volumetric</b> <b>emission</b> <b>coefficient.</b> These spectra are then compared to the line-by-line spectral code SESAM used for the simulation of the radiative emission of entry-type plasma. 1...|$|E

40|$|The main aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the role of {{different}} factors responsible for CO 2 emission from Indian road passenger transport with the help of Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index over the period of 1971 - 2011. CO 2 emission increase is decomposed into five major factors - <b>emission</b> <b>coefficient,</b> transport energy intensity, transport activity, economic growth, and population.

40|$|International audienceThe net <b>emission</b> <b>coefficient</b> of plasmas {{containing}} argon {{and iron}} at atmospheric pressure is calculated and analysed {{for the case}} of cylindrical geometry. Its values are obtained by integrating the monochromatic net <b>emission</b> <b>coefficient</b> taking into account continuous and line radiation. The width of the spectral lines is determined by Doppler broadening, natural, resonance, van der Waals, electron and ion Stark broadening. As Stark broadening {{is the most important}} broadening mechanism in the considered pressure and temperature range, the electron Stark widths are calculated following the semi-empirical Stark broadening theory. Additionally, the electron Stark widths of Ar, Ar +, Fe and Fe + are multiplied by scaling factors in order to reproduce experimental electron Stark widths. The scaling factor is determined for each species separately. For small plasma radii the net <b>emission</b> <b>coefficient</b> determined here shows good agreement with literature values where spherical geometry is considered while they decrease faster with increasing plasma radius. This behaviour is caused by the increase of the irradiation of the symmetry axis when cylindrical instead of spherical geometry is considered. For radii and temperatures typical of the metal filled core of arcs occurring in gas metal arc welding processes, i. e. radii between 1 and 2 × 10 − 3 m and temperatures between 5000 and 10000 K, the scaling of the Stark widths increases the net <b>emission</b> <b>coefficient</b> of iron plasmas by between 2 and 23 %. In this parameter range the net <b>emission</b> <b>coefficient</b> of iron plasmas for cylindrical geometry is between 30 and 37 % smaller than values calculated for spherical geometry...|$|R

The sheath size is found to decrease with the pressure, the voltage and the secondary <b>emission</b> <b>coefficient.</b> There is a strong effect of the secondary <b>emission</b> <b>coefficient</b> and the pressure on the voltagecurrent characteristics. The discharge resistance is found to be several hundreds of k&# 937; and decreases with the discharge current, the pressure and the secondary <b>emission</b> <b>coefficient.</b> A comparison between the matrix sheath model and experiments suggests that both the secondary <b>emission</b> <b>coefficient</b> and the surface area on which the current is collected at the cathode increase with the discharge current.

The dc bias formation can be understood from a particle-flux balance applied to each electrode, and results from two main effects: (1) the larger effective ion flux at each electrode due to the emission of secondary electrons and (2) ion-flux multiplication within the sheath due to ionization from these emitted secondary electrons. By making use of an empirical fit to the simulation data, the possibility of non-invasively estimating secondary electron <b>emission</b> <b>coefficients</b> in CCP systems is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Measuring {{the light}} emitted by a plasma often offers a {{convenient}} way {{to obtain information}} on the plasma properties. To procure these plasma properties, {{as well as their}} spatial distribution in a volume discharge, the local <b>emission</b> <b>coefficient</b> is required. However, the intensity recorded by a detector is a lateral scan of the emission integrated along a line-of-sight. A commonly used technique to retrieve radial dependence in case of cylindrical symmetry is Abel inversion. When the discharge structure exhibits a more complex symmetry or no symmetry at all, a more generalised approach is required: the inverse Radon transform. Since optical access from numerous angles is now required, this technique is especially applicable to discharges in open air. A brief explanation of the Radon and inverse Radon transforms is given and the reconstructed local <b>emission</b> <b>coefficient</b> of a structured volume dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) in open air is presented.

40|$|A Computationally Assisted Spectroscopic Technique {{to measure}} {{secondary}} electron <b>emission</b> <b>coefficients</b> (γ-CAST) in capacitively-coupled radio-frequency plasmas is proposed. This non-intrusive, sensitive diagnostic {{is based on}} a combination of Phase Resolved Optical Emission Spectroscopy and particle-based kinetic simulations. In such plasmas (under most conditions in electropositive gases) the spatio-temporally resolved electron-impact excitation/ionization rate features two distinct maxima adjacent to each electrode at different times within each RF period. While one maximum is the consequence of the energy gain of electrons due to sheath expansion, the second maximum is produced by secondary electrons accelerated towards the plasma bulk by the sheath electric field at the time of maximum voltage drop across the adjacent sheath. Due to these different excitation/ionization mechanisms, the ratio of the intensities of these maxima is very sensitive to the secondary electron <b>emission</b> <b>coefficient</b> γ. This sensitvity, in turn, allows γ to be determined by comparing experimental excitation profiles and simulation data obtained with various γ-coefficients.
