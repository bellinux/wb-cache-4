40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was the design and analysis of broadband antennas {{to be used with}} sounders for trans-equatoria! propagation research. Sites have been identified in Oahu and Rarotonga. A four step process is used {{in the design of the}} antennas. The four steps are: theoretical design, preliminary analysis with ELNEC software, detailed analysis with NECA software and finally terrain modeling with PAINT, MN and TA software. Preliminary work led to the decision to use two antennas at each site. On Oahu a HF log-periodic antenna is used for the 2 - 25 MHz band and a VHF log-periodic antenna is used for the 25 - 60 MHz band. On Rarotonga a VHF log-periodic antenna is also used for the 25 - 60 MHz band, however a sloping <b>V</b> <b>antenna</b> is used for the 2 - 25 MHz band.

40|$|Antennas are {{essential}} components in any wireless communication system. To evaluate them is challenging, especially when new technologies are emerging. Future intelligent transport systems, where vehicular communications {{play an important}} role will cover important aspects such as traffic safety and traffic efficiency. These applications will be covered by technologies such as IEEE 802. 11 p and LTE. For these emerging technologies, traditional methods for measuring the vehicular antennas such as anechoic chamber measurements or expensive and time-consuming field measurements may not be enough or suitable. Thus a new method for evaluating the antennas performance is desirable. A method that includes the multipath environment to give an idea of the antenna performance in the whole system {{and at the same time}} be able to be applied at early stages of product development. This thesis aims to provide such method. The thesis is divided in two parts. The first part contains an overview and background of important concepts needed for development of methods for evaluation of vehicular antennas. In the second part, the papers that constitute the core of this work are appended. In Paper A, we evaluate the vehicle’s antenna performance using only simulations. We start by defining the multipath environment for vehicle-tovehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V 2 X) communication. Then, the V 2 X environment is simulated using a multipath simulation tool to evaluate the vehicle’s antennas radiation patterns placed at different positions on the vehicle. This will result in the received power cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) for the voltage samples at the receiving antennas port. In Paper B, we present the design and evaluation of an antenna module for IEEE 802. 11 p and LTE technologies. The module is designed taking into consideration the available space and suitable placement on the vehicle. The proposed module is in accordance with the requirements for LTE and IEEE 802. 11 p technologies. This is validated with the analysis of the antenna efficiencies, S-parameters, radiation patterns, and diversity performance for the simulated and measured antenna module. Finally, Paper C presents a method for the evaluation of <b>V</b> 2 <b>V</b> <b>antennas</b> in a simulated measurement-based multipath environment. Here, a measurement campaign is performed to obtain the parameters (i. e., the angular received power spectrum) that define a realistic V 2 V multipath environment. These parameters are then introduced in a multipath simulation tool where the antennas radiation patterns are evaluated. Results are expressed in terms of received power CDFs. This method is validated by comparing the simulated and measured received power for two roof-top vehicle antennas...|$|R
