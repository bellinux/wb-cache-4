5|$|The Battle of Britain proved for {{the first}} time that the Junkers Ju 87 was {{vulnerable}} in hostile skies against well-organised and determined fighter opposition. The Ju 87, like other dive bombers, was slow and possessed inadequate defences. Furthermore, it could not be effectively protected by fighters because of its low speed, and the very low altitudes at which it ended its dive bomb attacks. The Stuka depended on air superiority, the <b>very</b> <b>thing</b> being contested over Britain. It was withdrawn from attacks on Britain in August after prohibitive losses, leaving the Luftwaffe without precision ground-attack aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Fate is a {{theme that}} often occurs in Greek writing, tragedies in particular. The idea that {{attempting}} to avoid an oracle is the <b>very</b> <b>thing</b> which brings it about is a common motif in many Greek myths, and similarities to Oedipus can for example {{be seen in the}} myth of the birth of Perseus.|$|E
25|$|As mentioned, {{imperfect}} {{information in}} a leadership game reduces to Cournot competition. However, some Cournot strategy profiles are sustained as Nash equilibria but can be eliminated as incredible threats (as described above) by applying the solution concept of subgame perfection. Indeed, it is the <b>very</b> <b>thing</b> that makes a Cournot strategy profile a Nash equilibrium in a Stackelberg game that prevents it from being subgame perfect.|$|E

25|$|In the {{judgment}} of these Orthodox, the Roman Catholic Church is in fact teaching {{as a matter of}} Roman Catholic dogma that the Holy Spirit derives his origin and being (equally) from both the Father and the Son, making the Filioque a double procession.

25|$|REBT {{posits that}} the client must work hard to get better, and in therapy this {{normally}} includes {{a wide array of}} homework exercises in day-to-day life assigned by the therapist.

By doing so, the client is actively acting against the belief that often is contributing significantly to the disturbance.|$|E
25|$|Considerable {{work has}} been {{published}} {{on the evolution of}} ant dulosis and almost all of it has at least some empirical evidence to defend its positions. Notably, that nearly all raiding ant species have is an adaptation of their mandibles that make them big or piercing or both. It makes sense that the <b>very</b> <b>thing</b> that enables an ant to be a better raider causes that same ant to become dependent on others; the parasite loses the use of its mandibles for actual work. On this and other evidence, it has been proposed that predation is the precursor to slavery. It has also been suggested that colony multiplication by adoption and budding followed by temporary parasitism can lead to dulosis. While observations indicate that colony multiplication can lead to temporary parasitism, it is apparently very questionable that temporary parasitism leads to dulosis.|$|E

25|$|Again {{the pure}} being of Hegel {{is a mere}} abstraction,--a {{hypothesis}} illegitimately assumed, which he has nowhere sought to vindicate. The very point to be established {{is the possibility of}} reaching being per se or pure being; yet in the Hegelian system this is the <b>very</b> <b>thing</b> assumed as a starting-point. Besides this, of course, objections might be made to the method of development, as not only subverting the principle of contradiction, but as galvanizing negation into a means of advancing or developing the whole body of human knowledge and reality. The intellectual intuition of Schelling, as above consciousness, the pure being of Hegel, as an empty abstraction, unvindicated, illegitimately assumed, and arbitrarily'developed, are equally useless as bases of metaphysics. This led Cousin, still holding by essential knowledge of being, to ground it in an analysis of consciousness,--in psychology.|$|E
500|$|Avicenna anticipates {{that one}} could reject the {{argument}} {{by saying that the}} collection of contingent things may not be contingent. A whole does not automatically share the features of its parts; for example, in mathematics a set of numbers is not a number. Therefore, the objection goes, the step in the argument that assumes that the collection of contingent things is also contingent, is wrong. However, Avicenna dismisses this counter-argument as a capitulation, and not an objection at all. If the entire collection of contingent things is not contingent, then it must be necessary. This also leads to the conclusion that there is a necessary existent, the <b>very</b> <b>thing</b> Avicenna is trying to prove. Avicenna remarks, [...] "in a certain way, this is the <b>very</b> <b>thing</b> that is sought".|$|E
500|$|In {{the fifth}} chapter, Atri asks Yajnavalkya whether someone {{pursuing}} Brahman can be without the sacred thread. According to the translation by Paul Deussen, {{a professor and}} German Indologist, Yajnavalkya answers that [...] "this <b>very</b> <b>thing</b> is sacred thread, namely the Atman". A renouncer [...] or Parivrajaka (another term for renouncer) performs a sacrifice to the Atman whenever he feeds himself or rinses his mouth with water. Feeding and dressing his Prana (life force) is the only duty of the renouncer.|$|E

500|$|Avnet and Conran {{spent two}} years working on the screenplay, which {{included}} numerous genre-related references and homages, and developing a working relationship. Then, the producer took the script and the trailer and began approaching actors. In order to protect Conran's vision, Avnet decided to shoot the movie independently {{with a lot of}} his own money. The producer realized that [...] "the <b>very</b> <b>thing</b> that made this film potentially so exciting for me, and I think for an audience, which was the personal nature of it and the singularity of the vision, would never succeed and never survive the development process within a studio." ...|$|E

[...] AllMusic compared the songs to ambient music by the Aphex Twin, while Exclaim! noted that [...] "Quique follows a similar path as Aphex Twin's Selected Ambient work but with structures that a more rock-based band like Chapterhouse dreamed of matching." [...] The members of Seefeel were fans of Aphex Twin and said after playing shows with him and Autechre that they felt [...] "more affinity with them {{than many of the}} bands we'd met – Robin Guthrie and the Cocteau Twins excepted!" ...|$|E
500|$|After meeting Brian, they recruit {{him to be}} a contestant. He signs up for {{the free}} martinis and food, but ends up falling in love with the reality starlet, Brooke Roberts. Quagmire and Brian are the final two contestants on The Bachelorette. Brooke's visits to the Griffin house is catastrophic, but not nearly as bad as the dinner she had with Quagmire and his mom. Brian wins her heart and the final rose, but when the cameras are turned off, Brooke tells Brian that it was nice [...] "working with him", and it is {{apparent}} that the show really is scripted, as Brian thought. Brian quickly becomes obsessed with Brooke and leaves several messages on her answering machine, even though she never gets back to him. Brooke gets angry at Brian for stalking her and throws her telephone at him when he attempts to serenade her outside her apartment. Brian is upset that he became the <b>very</b> <b>thing</b> he was mocking in the beginning.|$|E

500|$|In Karnick's eyes, {{contemporary}} {{critics have}} failed {{to see how the}} film has affected audiences and subsequently branded the film series as [...] "both irresponsible (for numbing audiences to violence) and puritanical (for showing the murders of sexually active teens)". Quoting director John Carpenter, Karnick emphasized that [...] "teens thus dispatched became victims not as punishment for sexual activity but simply because they were too preoccupied to notice the presence of a murderer". Pointing to Roger Ebert as a prime example of how critics have misunderstood the films (Ebert wrote that during a screening of Friday the 13th Part 2, he noticed that the audience had no sympathy for the victims and cheered during death scenes), Karnick explains that Ebert's remarks show how the film series forces [...] "audiences to experience the <b>very</b> <b>thing</b> that motivates the murders: a lack of compassion". In closing, Karnick suggested that these films were not puritanical, but proved that audiences [...] "could be just as indifferent and callous as the characters in the films".|$|E
500|$|Asked {{about the}} {{greatest}} challenge in filming the battle, Sapochnik said: [...] "Every time we charge the horses it takes 25 minutes to reset all the fake snow {{on the field and}} rub out the horseshoe prints. So how many times can we afford to charge the horses each day knowing we need to give time for a reset that's 10 times longer than the actual shot? Another thing was how to make 500 extras look like 8,000 when you are shooting in a field where there's just nowhere to hide your shortfall. It becomes a bit like a bonkers math equation. And finally: How do you get these guys riled up enough to run at each other and get covered in mud and stand in the rain and then run at each other again and again for 25 days, 10 hours a day, without them just telling you to piss off?" [...] In an interview, he said that the single most difficult thing he was asked to depict was [...] "having 3,000 horses running at each other, especially after we discovered that horses cannot touch each other. It’s illegal — it’s a very valid rule about protecting the horses. So the <b>very</b> <b>thing</b> we were trying to do was not allowed. And we only had 70 horses ... you would have one guy run into the frame, and then the horse rider would pull the horse, which means make the horse fall and lie down on its side. Later we would digitally superimpose another C.G.I. horse and make it seem like it had impacted the live one." ...|$|E
500|$|During the two {{or three}} years that Mary Shelley spent writing the Spanish and Portuguese Lives from 1834 or 1835 to 1837, she also wrote a novel, Falkner (1837), {{experienced}} the death of her father, William Godwin, started a biography of him, and moved to London after her son, Percy Florence Shelley, entered Trinity College, Cambridge. She had more difficulty with these Lives than with the other volumes' biographies, writing to her friend Maria Gisborne: [...] "I am now about to write a Volume of Spanish & Portugeeze [...] Lives – This is an arduous task, from my own ignorance, & the difficulty of getting books & information". According to Lisa Vargo, a recent editor of the Spanish and Portuguese Lives, Spanish books were hard to come by in England and not much was known regarding Shelley's subjects. However, Shelly ended one plaintive letter to another friend: [...] "The best is that the <b>very</b> <b>thing</b> which occasions the difficulty makes it interesting – namely – the treading in unknown paths & dragging out unknown things – I wish I could go to Spain." [...] While living in Harrow, she refused to go to the British Library in London, writing: [...] "I would not if I could – I do not like finding myself a stray bird among strange men in a character assimililating [...] to their own". At this time, the British Library had special tables for women in the reading room. While some scholars see her refusal to work there as a mark of [...] "feminist protest" [...] others see it as [...] "matter of comfort and practicality", since the reading rooms were [...] "noisy, badly lit, and poorly ventilated". Shelley's continual problems with finding sources mean that her biographies are based on relatively few works. However, Vargo writes that [...] "there is always a sense of an engaged and intelligent mind at work weighing what should be included, what seems accurate". Shelley tended to focus on obtaining accounts written by people who knew the authors, and when translations of the authors' works were unavailable or poor, she provided her own.|$|E
