To avoid the disadvantages of the known solutions we designed a novel sensor element using monocrystalline Lithiumniobate actuators as monolithic bimorph acoustic resonators. Such sensor elements have nearly no inner friction and can be practically used nearly up to their Curie temperature of Tc= 1100 degrees C.

By using global analysis of both parallel and perpendicular polarized fluorescence intensity decays involving deconvolution, the rotational correlation times of NATA {{in the tens}} of picosecond range are accurately recovered. Since rotational correlation times are directly proportional to viscosity, we have used these correlation times to derive the (relative) microscopic viscosity of increasing concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) in buffered water. GuHCl is a well-known chaotropic agent of protein denaturation. We give a step-by-step description how to obtain the final results.

In this case the relation between longitudinal viscosity measured by ultrasound and shear viscosity measured by flow tests was very simple leading {{to the conclusion that}} ultrasound could replace rotating <b>viscosimeters</b> for specific applications.

5000|$|The quartz {{viscometer}} is {{a special}} type of vibrational viscometer. Here, an oscillating quartz crystal is immersed into a fluid and the specific influence on the oscillating behavior defines the viscosity. The principle of quartz viscosimetry {{is based on the}} idea of W.P. Mason. The basic concept is the application of a piezoelectric crystal for the determination of viscosity. The high-frequent electrical field that is applied to the oscillator causes a movement of the sensor and results in the shearing of the fluid. The movement of the sensor is then influenced by the external forces (the shear stress) of the fluid which affects the electrical response of the sensor. The calibration procedure as a pre-condition of viscosity determination by means of a quartz crystal goes back to B. Bode who facilitated the detailed analysis of the electrical and mechanical transmission behavior of the oscillating system. [...] On the basis of this calibration, the quartz <b>viscosimeter</b> was developed which allows continuous viscosity determination in resting and flowing liquids.|$|E

40|$|In {{a recent}} paper by Levine and Carpenter, {{there is a}} plea for a {{standardized}} method for ascertaining the change in vis-cosity of gelatin culture media. They suggest the use of Ost-wald's <b>viscosimeter,</b> and that the readings be made at 40 °C. It was later shown by Levine and Shaw, at {{the meeting of the}} Detroit Section of the Society of American Bacteriologists, October 5, 1923, that within certain limits of time and tempera-ture of storage the viscosity of gelatin will give a constant read-ing at 40 °C., irrespective {{of the history of the}} gelatin. The work cited above was done by the use of ordinary culture tubes. The viscosity readings were preformed by pouring the gelatin solution or culture into an Ostwald <b>viscosimeter.</b> This method caused the gelatin culture to be useless after one read-ing, and it also caused contamination of the gelatin cultures which interferes with long readings. Direct imoculation of sterilized gelatin culture media in Ost-wald's viscosimeters was tried, by the writer, for a period of three months and found to give satisfaction. The longest con-tinuous reading for any one <b>viscosimeter</b> was twenty days. Readings were made at least once each day, and at times several readings were taken in a day without contamination of the gelatin.

40|$|Investigations of {{the flow}} {{properties}} of colloidal substances by viscometry and rheometry are a valuable tool in understanding many transport processes of importance in biology, medicine and industrial treatment of materials. The streaming of cytoplasm, blood, micellar solutions or crude oil emulsions are but some obvious examples. One {{of the most intriguing}} properties of colloidal systems is their ability of thinning or thickening under shear. To characterise this non-Newtonian flow behaviour different visco- and rheometric experiments have been devised, the capillary viscometer being one of the classical instruments. The underlying physical mechanisms of non-linear rheometry are the shear-induced formation and destruction of long range positional and orientational order. Since only in rare cases comprehensive structure and velocity information is accessible from inside a <b>viscosimeter,</b> generally, homogeneous samples are assumed. However, there are indications of a geometry dependent evolution of inhomogeneous phase and flow behaviour from recent experiments on colloidal model systems, in particular for denser systems of strongly interacting particles.

We give a detailed study of the local structures and shear rates in an optical model capillary <b>viscosimeter.</b> As a function of the overall flux several different flow scenarios are observed within the <b>viscosimeter</b> and the most striking feature is the simultaneous existence of up to four concentrically arranged phases under conditions of stationary flow...|$|E

Following these studies for gum tragacanth and C. M.

The results obtained may be summarized in the following: (I) Effects of 5 sorts of polyphosphates such as sodium pyrophosphate, sodium tripoly phosphate, sodium hexametaphosphate and their mixtures on the about 1. 0 [...] 1. 5 % aqueous solution of locust bean gum as one of plant mucilage and on the about 3 % aqueous solution of gum tragacanth as one of plant gum are studied and the considerable increase of their viscosity are observed. (II) In both cases, each curve relating the viscosity-quantities added has maximum and the orders for the increassing effect with these polyphosphates resembled each other. (III) It appears that this increasing of the viscosity will be partly ascribed to the increased formation of aggregation of the linear negative ions and may be partly based on the untwisting of somewhat kinked linear macromolecule having many hydroxyl groups probably caused by the adsorption of these polyphosphate ions kindred with that group. 浅岡が従来行って来ている重合燐酸塩の利用に関連した多くの研究のうちで発表済のものは若千に過ぎない。しかしその中に高分子物質水溶液の粘度に対する添加物の影響の研究としてトラガントゴム水溶液についての報告があるので，ゴム類ではないが或意味ではこれと類似とも云える植物粘質物であるローカストゴムについて同様の実験を行ったものである。このローカストゴムは食品，化粧品，繊維加工，製紙，医薬用ゼリーなどの方面の用途が知られているので，これに対する添加物効果はその利用面からも主要である。更に既報ではトラガントゴム水溶液の粘度測定が落球式であったので，今回はローカストゴム水溶液と同じく回転粘度計によって測定可能の粘度まで低下させるために，前の約半分の濃度である約 3 %にして同種の実験を行ったものである...|$|E

A general and good working viscosity model would help all scientists and engineers, who have to simulate and optimise these processes.

As part of this PhD thesis a new high-temperature high-pressure rotational <b>viscosimeter</b> is developed for measurements up to 1600 °C and 20 bar. Particularly in relation to the coal gasification process this two parameters are really important, because coal gasification occurs under high temperatures and high pressures. With this new <b>viscosimeter</b> it is possible to measure slag viscosities under realistic gasification conditions. To show that the new <b>viscosimeter</b> works quite good viscosity measurements of four real slags have been done. The influence of pressure and atmosphere on viscosity have been examined. The measurements are also compared with different viscosity models.
