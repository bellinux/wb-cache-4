5|$|Momolo {{came home}} to find the {{apartment}} empty apart from <b>Vitta,</b> Marianna's brother (also called Angelo Padovani), the two policemen and Edgardo himself. At about 20:00 the carabinieri arrived, in two carriages—one for Lucidi and his men, and another in which Agostini would drive Edgardo. Lucidi entered the apartment and took Edgardo from his father's arms, prompting the two policemen who had guarded him to shed tears. Momolo followed the police {{down the stairs to}} the street, then fainted. Edgardo was passed to Agostini and driven away.|$|E
5|$|The Mortaras {{spent the}} morning of 24 June {{attempting}} to have Feletti's order overruled by either the city's cardinal legate, Giuseppe Milesi Pironi Ferretti, or the Archbishop of Bologna, Michele Viale-Prelà, but they found that neither was in the city. Around noon, the Mortaras decided {{to take steps to}} make the separation as painless as possible. Edgardo's siblings were taken to visit relatives while Marianna reluctantly agreed to spend the evening with the wife of Giuseppe <b>Vitta,</b> a Jewish family friend. Around 17:00 Momolo visited San Domenico to make one last plea to Feletti. The inquisitor repeated all he had said to Padovani and Moscato the previous night and told Momolo not to worry as Edgardo would be well cared for, under the protection of the Pope himself. He warned that it would benefit no-one to make a scene when the carabinieri returned that evening.|$|E

In Prologue, a euhemerized account of Germanic history is given, including that Woden put three of his sons in charge of Saxony. The ruler of eastern Saxony was Veggdegg, one of whose sons was Vitrgils, the father of <b>Vitta,</b> the father of Hengist.|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} the color patterns of elytral <b>vittae</b> by sex in adults of Diabrotica virgifera virgifera leConte. Our study examined 3 ̆e 1000 beetles {{taken from a}} field population, a laboratory colony, and a reference collection containing 712 specimens from 15 of the United States and from the province of Ontario, Canada. The humeral and sutural <b>vittae</b> of each beetle 2 ̆ 7 s elytra were classified as being separate, partially confluent, or totally confluent with each other. The distribution of these elytral patterns was not independent of sex. Males tended to have confluent or partially confluent <b>vittae,</b> whereas females largely had separate <b>vittae.</b> Nonetheless, all three patterns of elytral <b>vittae</b> were found in both sexes of D. v. virgifera, and many beetles of each sex had partially confluent <b>vittae.</b> This data shows that sexing D. v. virgifera beetles by simple examination of elytral <b>vittae</b> alone is unreliable...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{three-dimensional}} {{structure of}} the <b>vittae</b> and crystals of Steganotaenia araliacea was studied {{for the first time}} to allow a rigorous comparison with members of the subfamily Saniculoideae, where these two characters are of diagnostic value. The irregular <b>vittae</b> were found to be branching and anastomosing and druse crystals dispersed in the mesocarp. Both these states are predominant in the Saniculoideae but very rare in Apioideae. In the subfamily Apioideae, regular <b>vittae</b> (vallecular and commissural, or cyclic) are present and druse crystals, if present, occur in the commissural side only. The absence of regular <b>vittae</b> and the presence of irregular <b>vittae</b> and dispersed druse crystals further support the exclusion of Steganotaenia from the subfamily Apioideae but support its hypothesized relation to the Saniculoideae, where large rib ducts combined with irregular <b>vittae</b> (branching or anastomosing) and dispersed druse crystals are typical. This study has led to a better understanding of the taxonomic value of irregular <b>vittae</b> and crystals...|$|R
25|$|The {{important}} elements of the Vestal costume include the stola and the <b>vittae.</b> It {{is important to note}} that these two items are closely related to the traditional attire of Roman brides and the Roman matron, and therefore are not unique to the Vestals. The <b>vittae</b> that the Vestals wore was a cloth ribbon worn in the Vestals’ hair. It is closely associated with status of Roman matron. <b>Vittae</b> were worn by a wider range of woman at different stages of life and therefore cannot be accepted as unique to just one stage. Unmarried girls, matrons, as well as the Vestal virgins all wore them.|$|R
25|$|Denia under Mujāhid's successors did {{not ignore}} Sardinia. In 1044 {{and again in}} 1056 an Andalusian Muslim scholar who had {{embarked}} at Denia was killed in action off Sardinia. Probably both academics were participating in jihād. There are likewise two Sard saint's lives dating from the late eleventh century which depict Islamic persecution on the island. San Saturno di Cagliari, an adaption of a life of Saint Saturninus, incorporates a prayer for deliverance from Muslim piracy. The local legend of Saint Gavin and his martyrdom during the Roman persecutions was transformed about this time into Sa <b>vitta</b> et sa morte et passione de Sanctu Gavinu Prothu et Januariu, an account of his persecutions by Muslims. It would take a century for peace {{to come to the}} sea lanes around Sardinia. In 1150 Pisa and the taifa of Valencia, which included Denia, signed a treaty whereby the latter would not exact tribute from Pisan ships on their way to Sardinia.|$|E

50|$|The {{species name}} {{is derived from}} the Latin a (not, without), added to the male {{morphological}} structure <b>vitta</b> (ribbon, band), in reference to a principal apomorphy of this species, the absence of an extruded vesica or <b>vitta</b> (sensu Philpott, 1928).|$|E
50|$|The fruits are schizocarps of two mericarps {{derived from}} mature fused carpels, often narrow-oblong with 4-5 mm {{in length and}} 1-1.5 mm in diameter. A single seed is formed with each mericarp. When mature, it is {{dispersed}} by wind. The cremocarp of the fruits is narrow-oblong and slightly flat. The oil tubes in the fruit, 3 or 4 <b>vittae,</b> form in wrinkles of ridges of the fruit, while 4 to 8 <b>vittae</b> {{can be found in}} commissure. The plant bears fruit from August to September.|$|R
50|$|Umbonia spinosa can be {{distinguished}} from other members of its genus {{by the appearance of}} its dorsal horn. Its dorsal horn pronotum is located between or just behind its humerais and they possess a short metopidium. Dorsal horn pronotum itself is straight and the base of the plate is yellow, testaceous or pale green, with red or yellow <b>vittae</b> each side, though sometimes U. spinosa can be characterized by black <b>vittae.</b> The dorsal horn gradually tapers to a point from base to summit, similar to a thorn in appearance.|$|R
50|$|The palla {{supposedly}} signified {{the dignity}} and sexual modesty of a married woman, but due to its encumbering nature as a veil, {{there has been much}} debate whether it was only worn in public by the aristocracy, or if at all by working women of lower classes. <b>Vittae</b> were woollen fillets that bound a married woman's hair. They were another indication of a wife's modesty and purity and were seen as part of the clothing and presentation of a matron. <b>Vittae</b> could be inset with precious stones, {{or in the case of}} the Flaminicae, they would be purple in colour.|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{anatomical}} and palynological {{properties of}} Chaerophyllum astrantiae Boiss. & Bal. and C. aureum L. were determined {{for the first}} time. Cross sections of roots, stems, stem leaves and fruits of both species were examined. The leaves are amphistomatic and mesophyll is bifacial. The fruit has 2 <b>vittae</b> on commissural face and 4 <b>vittae</b> on lateral and dorsal faces in both species. The palynological studies revealed that, C. astrantiae and C. aureum have tricolporate pollen type and perforate exine ornamentation under light microscope. Ratio of polar axis to equatorial axis is 2. 15 in C. astrantiae and 2. 05 in C. aureum. Thus, pollen shape is perprolate for both of the species...|$|R

40|$|Background and objectives: Heracleum persicum {{aerial parts}} {{have been used}} in Iranian folk {{medicine}} for their therapeutic activities and as a spice and flavoring agent in Iranian foods and pickles. The present research was conducted to evaluate the pharmacognostic profile of H. persicum which will be useful in standardization for quality, purity, and sample identification. Methods: For quality control, phytochemical and physicochemical parameters such as macroscopic and microscopic evaluations, loss on drying, total ash value, acid insoluble ash, fluorescence standards of the drug and other tests were carried out using the flowers, fruits, stems and leaves of the plant. Results: Light microscopic studies showed various characteristic features including, collateral vascular bundle, oil ducts (<b>vittae)</b> and uniseriate, unicellular trichomes in leaf; collateral and closed vascular bundles, <b>vittae</b> and kidney shaped strands of collenchymatous tissue in stem; parenchymatous cells, commissural and solitary <b>vittae</b> in fruit; and tapetum tissue, pollen grains and fragments of stamens and styles in flower. Phytochemical screening of the aerial plant parts revealed the presence of flavonoids, tannins and steroids. Conclusion: The pharmacognostic characters observed in this study will be helpful in correct identification and characterization of H. persicum. Preliminary phytochemical studies may be helpful in further isolation and purification of lead compounds...|$|R

40|$|Ferula communis L. {{plants were}} {{collected}} {{all over the}} island of Sardinia (Italy) with the object of determining their poisonousness through UV microscopy examinations of the <b>vittae</b> fluorescence of fresh samples. The same fresh samples examined under UV light were subjected to TLC analyses to check {{the validity of the}} microscopical conclusions of the poisonousness of giant fennel plants, morphologically and caryologically identical. The results evidenced a positive correlation between the microscopical evaluation of the <b>vittae</b> fluorescence intensity and the presence of the chemical compounds responsible of the poisonousness of Ferula communis. These data suggest the employment of UV microscopy as a rapid tool to distinguish “poisonous” and “non-poisonous” giant fennel quite easily, complementing the chemical analysis of the latex.
