40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} nitrification inhibitors (NIs) 3, 4 -dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) and 3 -methylpyrazole 1, 2, 4 -triazole (3 MP + TZ), on N 2 O emissions and yield from a typical vegetable rotation in sub-tropical Australia we monitored soil N 2 O fluxes continuously over an entire year using an automated greenhouse gas measurement system. The temporal variation of N 2 O fluxes showed only low emissions over the <b>vegetable</b> <b>cropping</b> phases, but significantly higher emissions were observed post-harvest accounting for 50 - 70 % of the annual emissions. NIs reduced N 2 O emissions by 20 - 60 % over the <b>vegetable</b> <b>cropping</b> phases; however, this mitigation was offset by elevated N 2 O emissions from the NIs treatments over the post-harvest fallow period. Annual N 2 O emissions from the conventional fertiliser, the DMPP treatment, and the 3 MP + TZ treatment were 1. 3, 1. 1 and 1. 6 (sem = 0. 2) kg-N ha- 1 year- 1, respectively. This study highlights {{that the use of}} NIs in vegetable systems can lead to elevated N 2 O emissions by storing N in the soil profile that is available to soil microbes during the decomposition of the vegetable residues. Hence the use of NIs in vegetable systems has to be treated carefully and fertiliser rates need to be adjusted to avoid an oversupply of N during the post-harvest phase...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{nitrification}} inhibitors, {{in combination}} with ammonium based fertilisers, has been promoted recently as an effective method to reduce nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions from fertilised agricultural fields, whilst increasing yield and nitrogen use efficiency. <b>Vegetable</b> <b>cropping</b> systems are often characterised by high inputs of nitrogen fertiliser and consequently elevated emissions of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) can be expected. However, to date only limited data {{is available on the}} use of nitrification inhibitors in sub-tropical vegetable systems. A field experiment investigated the effect of the nitrification inhibitors (DMPP & 3 MP+TZ) on N 2 O emissions and yield from a typical vegetable production system in sub-tropical Australia. Soil N 2 O fluxes were monitored continuously over an entire year with a fully automated system. Measurements were taken from three subplots for each treatment within a randomized complete blocks design. There was a significant inhibition effect of DMPP and 3 MP+TZ on N 2 O emissions and soil mineral N content directly following the application of the fertiliser over the <b>vegetable</b> <b>cropping</b> phase. However this mitigation was offset by elevated N 2 O emissions from the inhibitor treatments over the post-harvest fallow period. Cumulative annual N 2 O emissions amounted to 1. 22 kg-N/ha, 1. 16 kg-N/ha, 1. 50 kg-N/ha and 0. 86 kg-N/ha in the conventional fertiliser (CONV), the DMPP treatment, the 3 MP+TZ treatment and the zero fertiliser (0 N) respectively. Corresponding fertiliser induced emission factors (EFs) were low with only 0. 09 - 0. 20 % of the total applied fertiliser lost as N 2 O. There was no significant effect of the nitrification inhibitors on yield compared to the CONV treatment for the three vegetable crops (green beans, broccoli, lettuce) grown over the experimental period. This study highlights that N 2 O emissions from such <b>vegetable</b> <b>cropping</b> system are primarily controlled by post-harvest emissions following the incorporation of vegetable crop residues into the soil. It also shows that the use of nitrification inhibitors can lead to elevated N 2 O emissions by storing N in the soil profile that is available to soil microbes during the decomposition of the vegetable residues over the post-harvest phase. Hence the use of nitrification inhibitors in vegetable systems has to be treated carefully and fertiliser rates need to be adjusted to avoid excess soil nitrogen during the postharvest phase...|$|E

30|$|Wetland {{smallholder}} {{farmers in}} subtropical Africa commonly apply manure in small doses in each <b>vegetable</b> <b>cropping</b> event while others apply large doses once in 3 – 4 cropping occasions. Results {{in this study}} have clearly demonstrated that small dose manure application per crop can only reduce losses of N by gaseous emissions of N 2 O at least {{up to the second}} cropping event. This trend in the N 2 O flux responses to the treatments clearly suggested that the single applications of 15 and 30  Mg manure ha− 1 provided substantially higher masses of organic substrate (Markewich et al. 2010) for the microbial degradation processes in aerated macro-pores of the soil profile during the first two <b>vegetable</b> <b>cropping</b> events. In studies related to N transformations in soils Markewich et al. (2010) reported significant accumulations of mineralized N (NH 4 -N and NO 3 -N) in microbially driven organic matter decomposition. Upon flooding of the macro-pores with soil water in the wetland (Johnson et al. 2005; Berdad-Haughn et al. 2006) some of the NO 3 -N is subjected to denitrification (Ma et al. 2007) associated with emissions of N 2 O in soil. In addition to that, the application of cattle manure to wetland soil enhances its potential for emissions of N 2 O gas by stimulating increased microbial respiration, causing rapid oxygen consumption and consequently an increase of anaerobic conditions for the onset of denitrification processes (Yates et al. 2006; Jassal et al. 2011). Wetland soils have aerobic and anaerobic sites that allow nitrification and denitrification to take place simultaneously (Johnson et al. 2005). Since the first process produces the substrate for the second, N losses through emissions of N 2 O can be high when the two processes are associated (Snyder et al. 2009). Evidently, the application of cattle manure to wetland cropping systems has the potential of increasing the contribution of agriculture to atmospheric N 2 O loading (Markewich et al. 2010; Kamaa et al. 2011).|$|E

Field experiments and on-farm surveys were conducted in several regions of France in order to assess the effects of different tillage systems on soil fertility (physical, chemical, biological) and on weed and crop development. Conservation tillage techniques induced a more compact soil, an increase of carbon and microorganisms in the first soil layer, and an increase of earthworm biomass for very superficial tillage. Weed control was only a major problem for the very superficial tillage, which in turn generated lower crop yields than conventional tillage.
