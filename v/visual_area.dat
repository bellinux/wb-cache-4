25|$|A {{recent study}} has {{obtained}} evidence that could support {{the existence of}} an intermediate visual store with characteristics of both iconic memory and VSTM (Sligte et al., 2008). This intermediate store is proposed to have high capacity (up to 15 items) and prolonged memory trace duration (up to 4 seconds). It coexists with VSTM but unlike it visual stimuli can overwrite the contents of its visual store (Pinto et al., 2013). Further research suggests an involvement of <b>visual</b> <b>area</b> V4 (Sligte et al., 2009).|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} {{attributes}} of stimulus: modality, intensity, location, and duration. The neocortex in the mammalian brain has parcellations that primarily process sensory input from one modality. For example, primary <b>visual</b> <b>area,</b> V1, or primary somatosensory area, S1. These areas mostly deal with low-level stimulus {{features such as}} brightness, orientation, intensity, etc. These areas have extensive connections {{to each other as}} well as to higher association areas that further process the stimuli and are believed to integrate sensory input from various modalities. However, recently multisensory effects have been shown to occur in primary sensory areas as well.|$|E
40|$|Visual {{experience}} {{plays an}} important role in the development of the visual cortex; however, recent functional imaging studies have shown that the functional organization is preserved in several higher-tier <b>visual</b> <b>areas</b> in congenitally blind subjects, indicating that maturation of <b>visual</b> <b>areas</b> depend unequally on visual experience. In this study, we aim to validate this hypothesis using a multimodality MRI approach. We found increased cortical thickness in the congenitally blind was present in the early <b>visual</b> <b>areas</b> and absent in the higher-tier ones, suggesting that the structural development of the visual cortex depends hierarchically on visual experience. In congenitally blind subjects, the decreased resting-state functional connectivity with the primary somatosensory cortex was more prominent in the early <b>visual</b> <b>areas</b> than in the higher-tier ones and were more pronounced in the ventral stream than in the dorsal one, suggesting that the development of functional organization of the visual cortex also depends differently on visual experience. Moreover, congenitally blind subjects showed normal or increased functional connectivity between ipsilateral higher-tier and early <b>visual</b> <b>areas,</b> suggesting an indirect corticocortical pathway through which somatosenroy information can reach the early <b>visual</b> <b>areas.</b> These findings support our hypothesis that the development of <b>visual</b> <b>areas</b> depends differently on visual experience...|$|R

The extent of these changes in the jugglers reduced during a subsequent three-month period in which they did not practice juggling. To further resolve the time course of these changes, the experiment was repeated with another young cohort scanned in shorter intervals, and the by then typical changes in V5 could already be found after just seven days of juggling practice. Interestingly, the observed changes were larger in the initial learning phase than during continued training.|$|E
25|$|Visual {{field and}} acuity tests measure {{and compare the}} size of the patient's field of vision and the clarity of their visual {{perception}} with the standard visual measurements associated with healthy 20/20 vision. Clinical diagnostic features indicative of Retinitis Pigmentosa include a substantially small and progressively decreasing <b>visual</b> <b>area</b> in the visual field test, and compromised levels of clarity measured during the visual acuity test. Additionally, optical tomography such as fundus and retinal (optical coherence) imagery provide further diagnostic tools when determining an RP diagnosis. Photographing the back of the dilated eye allows the confirmation of bone spicule accumulation in the fundus, which presents during the later stages of RP retinal degeneration. Combined with cross-sectional imagery of optical coherence tomography, which provides clues into photoreceptor thickness, retinal layer morphology, and retinal pigment epithelium physiology, fundus imagery can help determine the state of RP progression.|$|E
40|$|The {{perception}} of global visual shapes entails {{the integration of}} local image features into global configurations. Traditionally, the visual system {{is thought to be}} hierarchically organized in early <b>visual</b> <b>areas</b> (V 1, V 2, V 3, V 4) that are involved in the analysis of simple local features and higher <b>visual</b> <b>areas</b> (regions in the inferotemporal cortex) that are implicated in the processing of complex global shapes. We investigated the integration of local image features into global shapes across <b>visual</b> <b>areas</b> in the monkey and the human brain using fMRI. An adaptation paradigm was used, in which stimulus selectivity was deduced by changes in the course of adaptation of a pattern of randomly oriented elements. Accordingly, we observed stronger activity after adaptation when orientation changes in the adapting stimulus resulted in a collinear shape than a different random pattern. This selectivity to collinear shapes was observed not only in higher <b>visual</b> <b>areas,</b> but also in early <b>visual</b> <b>areas</b> where selectivity depended on the receptive field size. These findings suggest that unified shape perception in both monkeys and humans involves multiple <b>visual</b> <b>areas</b> that may integrate local elements to global shapes at different spatial scales...|$|R
50|$|Zeki's {{early work}} was mainly {{anatomical}} {{in nature and}} consisted in charting <b>visual</b> <b>areas</b> in the primate (monkey) brain by studying their connections, leading him to define several <b>visual</b> <b>areas</b> lying anterior to the primary <b>visual</b> cortex (<b>area</b> V1) of the brain. This was followed by recording from single cells in these areas, which {{led him to the}} view (a) that there is a functional specialisation in the visual cortex, with different <b>visual</b> <b>areas</b> undertaking different <b>visual</b> tasks, such as the processing of colour, motion and form and (b) that the visual brain processes these different attributes in parallel.|$|R
40|$|The {{borders of}} human <b>visual</b> <b>areas</b> V 1, V 2, VP, V 3, and V 4 were {{precisely}} and non-invasively determined. Functional magnetic resonance images were recorded during phase-encoded retinal stimulation. This volume data set was then sampled with a cortical surface reconstruction, {{making it possible}} to calculate local visual field sign (mirror vs. non-mirror image representation). This method automatically and objectively outlines area borders because adjacent areas often have the opposite field sign. Cortical magnification factor curves for striate and extrastriate cortical areas were determined, which showed that human <b>visual</b> <b>areas</b> have a greater emphasis on the center of gaze than their counterparts in monkeys. Retinotopically organized <b>visual</b> <b>areas</b> in humans extend anteriorly to overlap several areas previously shown to be activated by written words.

25|$|This {{is an area}} {{within the}} visual cortex that {{has been found to}} play an {{important}} role in the target selection of saccades. In other words, this area is important for determining which objects our eyes shift to when they move. Studies have shown that there is a large amount of activation within the <b>visual</b> <b>area</b> V4 before the saccade even takes place. This occurs in the form of shrinking receptive fields. The receptive fields of these brain cells tend to shift towards the object that the eye is about to move towards, generally more so if the object is close to the original fixation point. This dynamic change in receptive fields is thought to enhance the perception and recognition of objects in a visual scene. Because the receptive fields become smaller around the targeted objects, attention within the visual scene is very focused on these objects. Increased attention to target objects within a visual scene help direct eye movements from one object to another. Understanding of the visual scene becomes more efficient because these attention shifts guide the eyes towards relevant objects as opposed to objects that may not be as important.|$|E

The interaction is mediated by recurrent connections between higher order <b>visual</b> <b>areas</b> and V 1, manifested in the longlatency context-sensitive activities often observed in neurophysiological experiments, and {{is responsible for the}} re-integration of information analysed by the higher <b>visual</b> <b>areas.</b> Specifically, we considered the case of integrating `what' and `where' information from the ventral and dorsal streams.

[...] Ultimately, however, {{it appears that the}} size of a patch of cortical tissue in <b>visual</b> <b>area</b> V1 [...] that processes a given location in the visual field (a concept known as cortical magnification) is equally important in determining visual acuity.

5000|$|However, Bender’s theory {{does not}} account for recent studies in which {{fixation}} did not change and no eye movements were produced while polyopia was experienced, therefore polyopic images were not a result of involuntary eye movements.

The report of polyopic images of complex objects at fixation suggests that the disorder is not limited to lower-order <b>visual</b> <b>areas</b> in occipital cortex (in which simple features such as borders and angles are encoded), but rather it involves the interaction between lower-order <b>visual</b> <b>areas</b> in the occipital lobe and higher-order <b>visual</b> <b>areas</b> in the temporal lobe that is postulated to code whole objects.|$|R

2500|$|Many {{previous}} fMRI {{studies have}} seen that spontaneous activation of functionally connected brain regions occurs during the resting state, {{even in the absence}} of any sort of stimulation or activity. Human subjects presented with a visual learning task exhibit changes in functional connectivity in the resting state for up to 24 hours and Dynamic functional connectivity studies have even shown changes in functional connectivity during a single scan. By taking fMRI scans of subjects before and after the learning task, as well as on the following day, it was shown that the activity had caused a resting-state change in hippocampal activity. [...] Dynamic causal modeling revealed that the hippocampus also exhibited a new level of effective connectivity with the striatum, though there was no learning-related change in any <b>visual</b> <b>area.</b> Combining fMRI with DCM on subjects performing a learning task allows one to delineate which brain systems are involved in various sorts of learning, whether implicit or explicit, and document for long these tasks lead to changes in resting-state brain activation.|$|E

Area V4 was initially suggested by Semir Zeki to be exclusively dedicated to color, but this is now thought to be incorrect.

Activity patterns evoked by single faces and single houses reliably predicted which of the 2 overlapping stimulus types was being attended with high accuracy (80 – 90 % correct).

Across individual blocks, the strength of the attentional bias signal in early <b>visual</b> <b>areas</b> was highly predictive of the modu-lations found in high-level object areas, implying that pattern-specific attentional filtering at early sites can determine the quality of object-specific signals that reach higher level <b>visual</b> <b>areas.</b> Through compu-tational modeling, we show how feedback of an average template to V 1 -like units can improve discrimination of exemplars belonging to the attended category.

"One day, {{having given}} my {{creditors}} the slip, and feeling more than usually dejected, I continued {{for a long}} time to wander about the most obscure streets without object whatever, until at length I chanced to stumble against the corner of a bookseller's stall. Seeing a chair close at hand, for the use of customers, I threw myself doggedly into it, and, hardly knowing why, opened the pages of the first volume which came within my reach. It proved to be a small pamphlet treatise on Speculative Astronomy, written either by Professor Encke of Berlin or by a Frenchman of somewhat similar name. I had some little tincture of information on matters of this nature, and soon became more and more absorbed in the contents of the book, reading it actually through twice before I awoke to a recollection of what was passing around me. By this time it began to grow dark, and I directed my steps toward home. But the treatise had made an indelible impression on my mind, and, as I sauntered along the dusky streets, I revolved carefully over in my memory the wild and sometimes unintelligible reasonings of the writer. There are some particular passages which affected my imagination in a powerful and extraordinary manner. The longer I meditated upon these the more intense grew the interest which had been excited within me. The limited nature of my education in general, and more especially my ignorance on subjects connected with natural philosophy, so far from rendering me diffident of my own ability to comprehend what I had read, or inducing me to mistrust the many vague notions which had arisen in consequence, merely served as a farther stimulus to imagination; and I was vain enough, or perhaps reasonable enough, to doubt whether those crude ideas which, arising in ill-regulated minds, have all the appearance, may not often in effect possess all the force, the reality, and other inherent properties, of instinct or intuition; whether, to proceed a step farther, profundity itself might not, in matters of a purely speculative nature, be detected as a legitimate source of falsity and error. In other words, I believed, and still do believe, that truth, is frequently of its own essence, superficial, and that, in many cases, the depth lies more in the abysses where we seek her, than in the actual situations wherein she may be found. Nature herself seemed to afford me corroboration of these ideas. In the contemplation of the heavenly bodies it struck me forcibly that I could not distinguish a star with nearly as much precision, when I gazed on it with earnest, direct and undeviating attention, as when I suffered my eye only to glance in its vicinity alone. I was not, of course, at that time aware that this apparent paradox was occasioned by the center of the <b>visual</b> <b>area</b> being less susceptible of feeble impressions of light than the exterior portions of the retina. This knowledge, and some of another kind, came afterwards in the course of an eventful five years, during which I have dropped the prejudices of my former humble situation in life, and forgotten the bellows-mender in far different occupations. But at the epoch of which I speak, the analogy which a casual observation of a star offered to the conclusions I had already drawn, struck me with the force of positive conformation, and I then finally made up my mind to the course which I afterwards pursued.|$|E

To this end, anatomical maximum probability maps (aMPM) derived from individual cytoarchitectonic maps of striate and extrastriate <b>visual</b> <b>areas</b> were compared with functional localisers for the early <b>visual</b> <b>areas.</b> Using fMRI, we delineated dorsal and ventral human retinotopic areas V 1, V 2, and V 3, {{as well as a}} quarter-field visual field representation lateral to V 3 v, V 4 (v), in 24 healthy subjects. Based on these individual definitions, a functional maximum probability map (fMPM) was then computed in analogy to the aMPM. Functional and anatomical MPMs were highly correlated at group level: 78. 5 % of activated voxels in the fMPM were correctly assigned by the aMPM. The group aMPM was less effective in predicting functional retinotopic areas in the individual brain due to the large inter-individual variability in the location and extent of <b>visual</b> <b>areas</b> (mean overlap 32 - 69 %).
