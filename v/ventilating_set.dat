In all containers, each live weed plant was counted and identified according to Pignatti [24] and Tutin et al. [25, 26]. On the last three measuring dates (29 July, 29 August, and 23 October), four containers per treatment (one per block) were sampled and all the weed plants collected, separated by species and their dry weight measured after they were dried to constant weight in a <b>ventilated</b> oven (<b>set</b> at 60  °C).|$|R

40|$|Objective During {{mechanical}} ventilation, the heart–lung interaction induces a cyclic oscillation of the arterial pulse pressure. The {{measure of}} this respiratory changes, called pulse pressure variation (PPV), {{is one of}} the most reliable index of fluid responsiveness. It is used as a functional hemodynamic monitoring in several conditions (general anesthesia, sepsis, ALI/ARDS). During cardiac surgery, midline thoracotomy significantly alters heart–lung interaction and, consequently, PPV. The aim of the study was the evaluation of the effects of sternotomy on PPV during pressure-control ventilation (PCV). Methods Nineteen patients (age 62 ± 10 years) undergoing elective CABG in a tertiary university hospital were enrolled. A Swan–Ganz catheter, an arterial catheter and a central venous catheter was inserted in order to collect pressure waveforms. After the induction of general anesthesia all the patients were mechanically <b>ventilated</b> (PCV), <b>setting</b> pressure values in order to obtain a tidal volume of 8 ml/kg. Hemodynamic data were collected 5 min before and after sternotomy. PPV was calculated offline from the collected waveforms, according to the formula reported by Michard and colleagues [1]. Results The PPV, cardiac index, stroke volume, mean arterial pressure, airway pressure and tidal volume did not change after sternotomy. We subsequently differentiated patients according to PPV values (Fig. 1). In the subgroup of patients with PPV > 13...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical ventilation, often {{required}} to maintain normal gas exchange in critically ill patients, may itself cause lung injury. Lungprotective ventilatory strategies with low tidal volume {{have been a major}} success in the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Volutrauma causes mechanical injury and induces an acute inflammatory response. Our objective was to determine whether neutrophil elastase (NE), a potent proteolytic enzyme in neutrophils, would contribute to ventilator-induced lung injury. NEdeficient (NE 2 / 2) and wild-type mice were mechanically <b>ventilated</b> at <b>set</b> tidal volumes (10, 20, and 30 ml/kg) with 0 cm H 2 O of positive end-expiratory pressure for 3 hours. Lung physiology and markers of lung injury were measured. Neutrophils from wild-type and NE 2 / 2 mice were also used for in vitro studies of neutrophil migration, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) - 1 cleavage, and endothelial cell injury. Surprisingly, in the absence of NE, mice were not protected, but developed worse ventilator-induced lung injury despite having lower numbers of neutrophils in alveolar spaces. The possible explanation for this finding is that NE cleaves ICAM- 1, allowing neutrophils to egress from the endothelium. In the absence of NE, impaired neutrophil egression and prolonged contact between neutrophils and endothelial cells leads to tissue injury and increased permeability. NE is required for neutrophil egression from the vasculature into the alveolar space, and interfering with this process leads to neutrophil-related endothelial cell injury...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2005 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} any ostelogical features which might prevent paradoxical movement (=lateral collapse) of the abdominal air sacs in birds during inhalation. A combination of 26 fresh and frozen adult bird carcasses representing 10 avian orders were procured from local sources. Dissections of each specimen first entailed the inflation of the respiratory system via a tracheal tube. The trachea was then sealed off to prevent deflation of the air sacs. Next, the abdominal and thoracic cavities were carefully dissected to expose the inflated air sacs. Using a set of Whitworth electronic digital calipers, a series of two measurements were taken on each carcass: 1. from the posterior sternal tip to the posterior end of the abdominal air sacs, and 2. from the posterior sternal tip to the tip of the pubic bone. Results indicated a strong correlation between the post-sternal length and position of the abdominal air sacs and the post-sternal extension of the pubic bones, such that lateral support of the abdominal air sacs was provided by the pubic bones. These data suggest that during inhalation the pubic bones probably serve to prevent the lateral collapse of these air sacs. The pubic bones of theropod dinosaurs, and even Archaeopteryx, were vertically orientated and distally fused. Therefore, it is unlikely that these taxa <b>ventilated</b> a <b>set</b> of abdominal air sacs and where unlikely to have possessed an avian lung-air sac system...|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} dilemma {{in the diagnosis}} of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) based on only clinical findings is overdiagnosis. The aim {{of the study is}} to prospectively evaluate the Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) in relation to VAP diagnosis. Design. Prospective, in a cohort of mechanically <b>ventilated</b> patients. <b>Setting.</b> The intensive care unit of a university hospital. Patients. Fifty patients, on mechanical ventilation therapy for more than 48 hours, suspected of having VAP were enrolled in the study and bacteriologic confirmation was done by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) culture. Interventions. Bronchoscopy with BAL fluid culture after establishing a clinical suspicion of VAP in patients having no prior antibiotic therapy or no change in current antibiotic therapy within last three days before BAL. CPIS scores during diagnosis were 6 ± 2 (3 - 9) (median±QR, maximum-minimum) and it was 7 ± 2 (2 - 9) at the 72 nd hour, in 41 cases with a diagnosis of VAP. In cases with no diagnosis of VAP, the CPIS scores were found to be 6 ± 2 (4 - 8) and 5 ± 3 (2 - 7), respectively. There {{was no significant difference between}} the VAP group and the non-VAP group at diagnosis, but was significant at 72 nd hour (respectively, p= 0. 551 and p= 0. 025). CPIS scores during diagnosis were 6 ± 3 (4 - 8) (median± QR, maximum-minimum) and 7 ± 4 (2 - 8) at the 72 nd hour, in 14 cases with a diagnosis of early-onset VAP. In cases with a diagnosis of late-onset VAP, the CPIS scores were found to be 6 ± 2 (3 - 9) and 7 ± 2 (3 - 9), respectively. There was no significant difference between the early-onset VAP group and the late-onset VAP group. In conclusion, the CPIS results should be evaluated carefully in the clinical setting during the diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} whether hypercapnic acidosis, induced by adding CO 2 to inspired gas, would be protective effect against ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), we ventilated 55 normal white rabbits for 6 hr or until PaO 2 /FIO 2 < 200 mmHg. Control group (n= 15) was ventilated with peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of 15 cm H 2 O, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 3 cm H 2 O, an inspiration-to-expiration ratio of 1 : 2, and an inspired oxygen fraction (FIO 2) of 0. 40. High pressure hypercapnic group (HPHC; n= 20) was ventilated with PIP of 30 cm H 2 O, PEEP of 0 cm H 2 O, and FIO 2 of 0. 40. Carbon dioxide was {{introduced into the}} inspiratory limb of the ventilator circuit, as necessary to maintain hypercapnia (PaCO 2, 65 to 75 mmHg). High pressure normocapnic group (HPNC; n= 20) was <b>ventilated</b> with same <b>setting</b> of HPHC, except normocapnia (PaCO 2, 35 to 45 mmHg). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, interleukin- 8 were significantly higher in high pressure ventilator group than control group (p< 0. 05). Wet weight to dry weight (WW/DW) and histologic scores were significantly higher in high pressure ventilator group than control group (p< 0. 05). However, {{there were no significant}} differences in oxygenation, BALF inflammatory markers, WW/DW and histologic scores between HPHC and HPNC groups. These findings suggest that hypercapnic acidosis at least induced by CO 2 insufflation would not be protective effect against VILI in this model...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundSpontaneous {{ventilation}} (SV) is {{used for}} adeno/tonsillectomy in children. However, inhalational anesthetics produce dose dependent decrease in minute ventilation. We tested the impact of PSV on awakening time, and length of PACU stay. Methods 34 patients were randomized into two groups; PS ventilation group and SV group. Premedication and induction were similar in both groups. Patients in PS group were <b>ventilated</b> with Pinsp <b>set</b> to deliver 8 ml/kg VT, keeping ETCO 2 between 35 and 45 mmHg. Any episodes of hypoventilation were recorded and corrected by manual support of ventilation. Upon completion of surgery, time-to-extubate was recorded. Length of PACU stay, agitation and CHEOPS scores, PONV and desaturation episodes were also recorded. Results are presented as mean (SD), median (interquartile range), or number of patients as appropriate. A P value< 0. 05 was considered significant. ResultsExtubation time (min) [mean (SD) ] was longer in SV group than PS group [7. 8 (2. 1) vs. 5. 5 (1. 4), P< 0. 001]. In the SV group 9 patients had episodes of hypoventilation that necessitated manual assist of ventilation. Pain scores were higher in SV group than PS group. Duration of stay in PACU [mean (SD) ] in minutes was longer in SV group than PS group [44. 3 (7. 4) vs. 39. 4 (5. 7), P= 0. 02]. All but one patient in the PS group needed postoperative rescue meperidine analgesia. The mean (SD) time needed for rescue meperidine analgesia was 27. 1 (8. 9) in PS group and 21. 8 (9. 4) in SV group (P= 0. 04). ConclusionPSV carries the advantages of overcoming the effects of narcotics and inhaled anesthetics on spontaneously ventilated adeno-tonsillectomy patients. They suffer less pain and spend less time in the PACU...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundHyperinflation (HI) is {{performed}} following open endotracheal suctioning (OES), whose goals include: to stimulate a cough, recover oxygenation and improve compliance. However, {{it may also}} induce unintended consequences, including: lung stress and strain, failure to maintain high distending pressure, and subsequently cycling recruitment and derecruitment. Here, {{our aim was to}} investigate the effects of hyperinflation after repeated OES on sequential alteration of arterial oxygenation and lung injury profile using a saline lavage-induced surfactant depleted ARDS rabbit model. MethodsBriefly, 30 Japanese White Rabbits were anesthetized and <b>ventilated</b> in pressure-controlled <b>setting</b> with a tidal volume of 6 - 8 ml/kg. Animals were divided into four groups, i. e.; Control, ARDS, OES, and HI. Saline-lavage-induced lung injury was induced except for Control group. Thereafter, rabbits were ventilated with positive-end expiratory pressure (PEEP) at 10 cm H 2 O. The ARDS group received ventilation with the same PEEP without derecruitment. As intervention, OES and HI were performed in ARDS animals. OES was performed for 15 seconds at 150 mm Hg, whereas HI was performed with PEEP at 0 cm H 2 O and peak inspiratory pressure at + 5 cm H 2 O for a minute. Total duration of the experiment was for 3 hours. OES and HI were performed every 15 minutes from beginning of the protocol. ResultsPaO 2 was maintained at about 400 mm Hg in both control and ARDS groups for the duration of this study, while in both OES and HI groups, PaO 2 decreased continuously up to 3 hours, dropped to a mean (±SD) of 226 [*]±[*] 28. 9 and 97. 0 [*]±[*] 30. 7 mmHg at 3 h, respectively. HI group had the lowest PaO 2 in the present investigation. Histological lung injury score was the highest in HI group than other three groups. Pulmonary TNF-α and IL- 8 levels were the highest in HI group compared to other groups, but without significant alterations at circulatory level in all the experimental groups. ConclusionsWe show in the present study that hyperinflation following repeated OES deteriorate arterial oxygenation and the severity of lung injury in a rabbit model of ARDS undergoing mechanical ventilation...|$|R
40|$|School {{buildings}} {{are among the}} most important building types that integrate significant aspects of sustainability research: building performance, energy efficiency, indoor environmental quality and the benefits of a healthy and productive environment. Providing thermal comfort in classrooms is an obvious necessity because students spend up to one-third of the day in school. Elevated air temperature is a common problem in most school classrooms during periods of increased thermal load; however, it could lead to a reduction in children’s schoolwork performance. In addition, school {{buildings are}} major energy consumers due to significant demands for heating and cooling to provide acceptable thermal comfort conditions. Thermal comfort studies and widely used standards have largely concentrated on research with adults. It is argued here that a re-examination of current approaches to thermal comfort for children could inform improved design of school buildings and thereby optimize conditions for students’ performance. To examine the thermal perceptions of children in naturally <b>ventilated</b> classrooms, three <b>sets</b> of field experiments were conducted in primary schools in Shiraz, Iran. The field work procedures consisted of thermal comfort surveys designed for the target age group and concurrent measurements of indoor and outdoor environmental variables. The analysis of the results addresses children’s thermal perception, gender differences, the relationship between children’s indoor comfort temperature and outdoor climate, and adaptive behaviour in classrooms. It is shown that the PMV-PPD model underestimates children’s actual thermal sensation and the percentage dissatisfied in the investigated classrooms. Moreover, the sampled children feel comfortable at lower temperatures than predicted by the ASHRAE Adaptive model during the warm season. The analysis suggests that children may be slightly less sensitive to indoor temperature change but less tolerant to high temperatures than adults. Overall, it appears that children have a warmer thermal sensation than would be expected based on adult-based models and that they require cooler indoor operative temperatures to achieve thermal comfort in the classroom. The results imply that the thermal comfort models given in the standards do not accurately address children’s thermal sensation in the classroom, and they highlight a lack of comprehensive understanding of children’s thermal perception, including metabolism and other physiological factors...|$|R
40|$|Driven by {{research}} studies and national targets, sedation practices in Intensive care Units (ICU) are undergoing change. Traditionally, ventilated patients in ICUs were kept deeply sedated and only gradually ‘weaned off’ sedation. However, current evidence supports a more ‘wakeful’ patient {{with the introduction}} of ‘sedation holds’ encouraging them to regain consciousness (Kress et al. 2000). There is little research exploring ICU nurses’ assessment and management of sedation. Employing a Heideggerian, hermeneutic phenomenological approach to enquiry, the study sought to provide insights into the world of the critical care nurse, nursing with technology, and specifically their beliefs surrounding sedation practices and how organisational factors, knowledge and personal experiences influence their clinical decisions in the care of the <b>ventilated</b> patient. The <b>setting</b> was the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, ICU and the purposive sample consisted of 16 ICU nurses with diverse critical care nursing experience. Bedside interviews, utilising an aide memoir, elicited narratives about the nurses’ experiences of sedation practice and a novel sedation monitor (responsiveness). The phenomenological analysis drew upon a number of existing frameworks to guide enquiry. The researcher engaged with the ‘hermeneutic circle’, acknowledging her pre-understandings and using these as a platform to move between the whole of the research and the parts, the descriptions and narratives offered, to develop new knowledge. Themes emerged that demonstrated patients’ sedation status directly impacted upon the nurses’ ICU lived experiences and left them in a state of disequilibrium regarding the requirement to deliver research based care, the desire to deliver holistic care and the duty to deliver safe care. The nurses perceived sedation holds and ‘wakefulness’ as resulting in patient agitation and distress which affected patient safety and comfort. However, the nurses equally felt a pressure of obligation to the doctors to perform such evidence based sedation holds. They described the struggling to maintain patient safety and manage their own fears and anxieties and organisational constraints, whilst experiencing guilt, blame and failure associated with their behavioural discordance with the prescribed decisions and their own clinical decision making processes and strategies. Team work between the two professions and effective leadership is evidently less than ideal. Consequently the implementation of changes in sedation practice is failing to meet either the national targets or to respond to the nurses’ concerns regarding their patient’s short term wellbeing. On both counts this potentially impairs the pursuit of best practice...|$|R
