In addition, the music played by the orchestra during that scene is Max Steiner's original score for the 1933 film.|$|E
5|$|The {{collision}} {{occurs at}} the termination shock, which is roughly 80–100AU from the Sun upwind of the interstellar medium and roughly 200AU from the Sun downwind. Here the wind slows dramatically, condenses and becomes more turbulent, forming a great oval structure known as the heliosheath. This structure is thought to look and behave <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> comet's tail, extending outward for a further 40AU on the upwind side but tailing many times that distance downwind; evidence from Cassini and Interstellar Boundary Explorer spacecraft has suggested that it is forced into a bubble shape by the constraining action of the interstellar magnetic field.|$|E
25|$|A {{hypervelocity}} railgun works <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> {{particle accelerator}} {{insofar as it}} converts electrical potential energy into kinetic energy imparted to the projectile. A conductive pellet (the projectile) is attracted down the rails by electric current flowing through a rail. Through the magnetic forces that this system achieves, a force is exerted on the projectile moving it down the rail. Railguns can generate muzzle-velocities in excess of 2.4 kilometers per second.|$|E

25|$|In 1990, the Agreement was {{supplemented}} by the Schengen Convention which proposed the complete abolition of systematic internal border controls {{and a common}} visa policy. The Schengen Area operates <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> single state for international travel purposes with external border controls for travellers entering and exiting the area, and common visas, but with no internal border controls. It currently consists of 26 European countries covering a population of over 400 million people and an area of 4,312,099 square kilometres (1,664,911 sq mi).|$|E
25|$|In 2011, Noten {{used the}} large taxi driver {{community}} of the UK industrial city of Middlesbrough to promote the exhibition The Modern Jewel - In time and the mind of others at MIMA, the Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art. He thought of working with taxi drivers after seeing the landmark bridge in the area, the Middlesbrough Transporter Bridge, that was celebrating its centenary. The transporter bridge operates <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> ferry and during the lengthy crossing taxi drivers usually have nothing much else to do than {{to talk to their}} passenger(s).|$|E
25|$|There {{was much}} comment in the Press box {{as to the}} {{legitimacy}} of this delivery but Meckiff certainly generated {{a considerable amount of}} pace. It is always difficult to assess exactly whether a bowler is throwing and it is something of which one must be sure before being too dogmatic. Once a bowler is condemned for throwing his career is finished and it is a great step to take by any umpire, especially so in a Test match...he certainly looks <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> thrower. The umpires, however, are satisfied that he is all right and they are the judges.|$|E

25|$|A {{collection}} {{of people can}} also exhibit swarm behaviour, such as pedestrians or soldiers swarming the parapets. In Cologne, Germany, two biologists from the University of Leeds demonstrated flock like behaviour in humans. The group of people exhibited similar behavioural pattern to a flock, where if {{five percent of the}} flock changed direction the others would follow. If one person was designated as a predator and everyone else was to avoid him, the flock behaved <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> school of fish. Understanding how humans interact in crowds is important if crowd management is to effectively avoid casualties at football grounds, music concerts and subway stations.|$|E
25|$|How {{the brush}} is held {{depends on the}} {{calligrapher}} and which calligraphic genre is practiced. Commonly, the brush is held vertically straight gripped between the thumb and middle finger. The index finger lightly touches {{the upper part of}} the shaft of the brush (stabilizing it) while the ring and little fingers tuck under the bottom of the shaft, leaving a space inside the palm. Alternatively, the brush is held in the right hand between the thumb and the index finger, <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Western pen. A calligrapher may change his or her grip depending on the style and script. For example, a calligrapher may grip higher for cursive and lower for regular script.|$|E
25|$|A {{supporting}} {{character to}} the story, Erica is Kilala's {{best friend and}} a model student in her school. Erika is very friendly, cute, and kind, she is <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> princess. After she is crowned princess at the 'Princess Contest', she is kidnapped by two cloaked men (later revealed to be humanoids) and {{it is up to}} Kilala and her newfound companions to retrieve her. Soon after Kilala and Rei's adventure in Snow White's world, the duo find Erica, but she's behaving quite abnormally and even tries to steal the tiara of the seventh princess because the men hypnotized Erica to steal the tiara for them. In volume 2, it is revealed that she is not the seventh princess.|$|E

500|$|Indeed, Fenwick resembled his creator in {{more than}} belief. To T. H. S. Escott, who was {{personally}} acquainted with Trollope, Fenwick—generous, outspoken, broad-minded, and a bit pugnacious—was <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> portrait of the author in clerical dress. Puddleham's discomfiture [...] "proves, to Trollope's naively undisguised satisfaction, that Providence {{is on the side}} of the State Church".|$|E
500|$|Governor John W. Bricker of Ohio, who {{did become}} the Republican vice-presidential nominee in 1944, helped Willis in his race. Upon Willis' victory, Bricker wired {{a friend to}} express jubilation, {{which turned out to}} have been unfounded: [...] "Election showed {{definite}} trend in all areas against New Deal. I was not surprised at the outcome particularly in Kentucky because the thinking {{of the people of the}} Middle West is in line with results down there. It looks <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Republican victory next year." ...|$|E
500|$|Whether {{the actions}} in {{these stories are}} actual events, or symbolic, is not clarified; and, {{director}} Darren Aronofsky emphasized that the storylines in their time periods and their respective convergences were open to interpretation. The director has said of The Fountains intricacy and underlying message, [...] " [...] <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Rubik's Cube, where you can solve it in several different ways, but ultimately there's only one solution at the end." [...] In a 2012 interview outlining the path of life depicted, Aronofsky stated that [...] "ultimately the film is about {{coming to terms with}} your own death" [...] oftentimes driven by love.|$|E

25|$|A flow-sensitive device {{may be used}} {{to close}} a valve if the flow of gas exceeds <b>a</b> set {{threshold}} (<b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> electrical circuit breaker). This device will operate independently of seismic motion, but will not respond to minor leaks which may be caused by an earthquake.|$|R
500|$|The {{crescent}} moon {{shape in the}} middle of the sky looks <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> circumzenithal arc, which is parallel to the horizon but centred at and located near zenith. [...] However, they only form when the sun is located lower than 32.2° and are at their brightest when the sun is located at 22°, which is not consistent with other haloes depicted in the painting. [...] Furthermore, one of the most striking features of circumzenithal arcs is their rainbow colours, and the shape in the painting is perfectly devoid of any colours. It is however not a complete circle (see Kern arc), and it is facing the sun, which are both correct properties for this phenomenon.|$|E
500|$|Clocking in at {{over two}} hours in length and {{containing}} 34 tracks, The Astonishing was planned as an immersive experience that would be best enjoyed as a full album {{as opposed to a}} collection of singles. The album plays out similarly to a film, with Loudwire observing, [...] "It’s an enormous amount of music to absorb in one sitting, but when you think about it, most movies are around {{two hours in}} length, and The Astonishing is <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> movie in the way it delivers the storyline." [...] Certain songs, such as [...] "A Savior in the Square" [...] and [...] "Our New World", have reoccurring themes, while others stand more on their own in order to move the plot along.|$|E
500|$|Critics also {{disagreed}} sharply regarding {{whether the}} game was a large step forward for the series. Parish said that less enemy variety was balanced by changes he considered the most experimental things Bungie had done for years. Edge and Bramwell praised {{the contrast between the}} Rookie's nighttime segments and the more fast-paced flashback vignettes. Edge added that while the narrative design was not groundbreaking, it served as a structure for exploring every possible weapon choice and strategy in the series. While Parish considered the ODST's abilities much {{different from those of the}} Chief, other critics such as Jackson wrote that the Halo feel was barely changed and that this was not detrimental. Brett Molina of USA Today felt that the game disappointed by not spending more time in the Rookie's open environment; [...] "instead," [...] Molina wrote, [...] "roughly two-thirds of ODSTs combat feels <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> traditional Halo game" [...] instead of exploring new mechanics.|$|E
50|$|The Barn is {{a mysterious}} {{structure}} that {{little is known}} about, except that both Sarah and Lucy went into it and did not return for twenty-seven years, with no memory of the past. It appears <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> old barn in Robinson's Corner, Nova Scotia. Very near Chester.|$|R
50|$|The second {{movement}} is 54 bars long and in 3/4 time, sounding <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> andante. The opening minuet consists of 26 bars before transitioning to a trio, lasting a mere eight bars, which repeats and then closes with the finished minuet. It {{is written in}} a very typical 18th-century minuet fashion.|$|R

He looks and behaves <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>an</b> alien, and Kokkuri {{believes}} {{him to be}} one, but Kohina is convinced {{that he is a}} [...] "normal Earthling." [...] Although he appears to be an alien, he is friendly and interacts with his schoolmates normally.|$|R
500|$|Cinematographer Gabriel Beristain, {{returning}} from the One-Shot, used a combination of modern digital technology and traditional analog techniques to replicate the feel of classic films that are set in the 1940s, but to also have the convenience and consistency of modern technology. Beristain uses the Arri Alexa digital camera, along with Leica Lenses and silk-stocking diffusion nets, the latter on which he recalled [...] "I had last used in the 1980s in England on videos and commercials. I remembered that they were fantastic. In combination with the Leica lenses, the look is very classic, <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> 1940s film. When I saw it, I said, 'This is absolutely Marvel,' and [...] agreed." [...] For the series' lighting, Beristain again mixed modern and traditional, using LED fixtures to recreate classic Hollywood lighting. He called his lighting of Atwell [...] "an homage to the great cinematographers who lit Lauren Bacall and Grace Kelly." ...|$|E
500|$|Ni no Kuni {{follows the}} journey of Oliver, a {{resident}} of Hotroit. While trying out a new vehicle designed by his friend Mark, Oliver almost drowns, but is saved by his mother Allie; however, she immediately dies from heart problems after saving him. As Oliver cries, his tears cause his doll, a gift from his mother, to come to life and reveal itself as a fairy named Shizuku, who tells Oliver that he is from another world where an evil wizard named Jabou took control. He also tells Oliver that each person from his world has a [...] "soulmate", a person that shares a link with someone in Oliver's world, and that his mother looks <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> great sage, Alicia, who was captured by Jabou. Realizing that Alicia must have been Allie's soulmate, Oliver sets out with Shizuku {{to travel to the}} other world and rescue Alicia in the hope that doing so will bring Allie back in his world.|$|E
500|$|Writing in the New Statesman, George Eaton {{stated that}} he was {{surprised}} by the moderate stance that Chomsky took in Occupy, remarking that the [...] "self-described anarchist sounds <b>very</b> <b>much</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> social democrat", offering the [...] "cautious, provisional response one might expect from a Labour shadow cabinet minister" [...] rather than the words of a radical revolutionary. Arguing that he was exhibiting [...] "passionate sanity" [...] at a time when much of the Left was gripped by conspiracy theories, he also criticized Chomsky for being [...] "maddeningly banal" [...] at points during the book, but ultimately thought that there was [...] "much to commend Chomsky's radical pessimism." [...] In a brief review in The Independent, Arifa Akbar highlighted that although Chomsky's claims regarding class war carried with them [...] "the ring of an old Marxist manifesto", the notion that we ourselves need to change in order to allow the state to change was [...] "very contemporary".|$|E
