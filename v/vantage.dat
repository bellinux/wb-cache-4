50|$|Three {{types of}} {{relationship}} between <b>vantages</b> have been identified: near synonymy, coextension, and inclusion, plus {{the relationship of}} complementation obtaining between the dominant <b>vantages</b> of distinct categories. The relationships are found synchronically in the world's languages but also follow a diachronic sequence in that order. The process {{has to do with}} progressively greater differentiation of categories along with greater emphasis placed on difference at the expense of similarity. The relationships are idealized segments of a continuum. The most intriguing of the four is coextension, first observed in the WARM category of Uspantec (Uspanteco), a Mayan language of Guatemala. In coextension, the ranges of each of two root terms used to name a category overlap substantially, but the range of one encompasses the focus of the other.|$|R
50|$|In the American {{comic book}} industry, the penciller {{is the first}} step in {{rendering}} the story in visual form, and may require several steps of feedback with the writer.

5|$|A {{possible}} {{issue with}} the causeway's identification as a Roman structure {{in the latter half}} of the twentieth century was its incorporation of many small bends along its course. Roman military roads are usually straight in both their overall course, and also typically from one <b>vantage</b> point to the next. Both the Foss Way and the Stanegate, roads of established Roman provenance, have sinuous courses similar to Wade's causeway, so the objection is not conclusive.|$|E

5|$|If {{a spider}} walks under a P. schultzi female's capture web and the {{vertical}} distance {{is less than}} 8centimetres, the P. schultzi often drops onto the prey too fast for a human eye to follow.

Most drops cover two to four centimetres, as longer drops are often obstructed by the web.|$|E
5|$|If the {{large-scale}} universe appears isotropic as viewed from Earth, the cosmological principle {{can be derived}} from the simpler Copernican principle, which states that there is no preferred (or special) observer or <b>vantage</b> point.

5000|$|The {{film was}} shot with Arri Alexa digital cameras and Panavision C-Series {{anamorphic}} lenses. The film's lighting {{was designed to}} accommodate black and white screening, and was converted from color to black and white in post-production because Payne {{said he wanted to}} produce an [...] "iconic, archetypal look". According to cinematographer Phedon Papamichael, the choice was to use [...] "the poetic power of the black and white in combination with these landscapes and of course the landscapes are playing a huge role in this story". The choice of black and white was made against distributor Paramount <b>Vantage's</b> wishes. A color version of the film was also produced in an effort to satisfy distributor Paramount <b>Vantage's</b> concerns; Payne said that he hopes no one ever sees it. Despite this, the network Epix announced in August 2014 that it would show the color version as a [...] "limited time showing".|$|R

5|$|Most puzzles {{are located}} on {{recognizable}} eye-level panels scattered around the island, often connected with power cables that light up once a puzzle is solved and guiding the player to the next puzzle. Some puzzles incorporate the game's architecture, such as one that requires the player to view background elements through a semi-transparent puzzle panel to determine the solution. There are also non-obvious puzzles built into the environment itself, requiring the player to find the correct <b>vantage</b> point to complete the puzzle. At any time, the player can engage the maze-drawing mode, which {{is marked by a}} white border on screen. While in this mode, the player's avatar is prevented from moving and instead allows the player to use their controls to trace the path through a presented maze. The mode ends once the player solves the puzzle or cancels the mode. Normally, this mode is activated in front of a panel, moving the player's view directly to the panel to solve it, {{but it can also be}} activated at any other time to engage those puzzles that are based on <b>vantage</b> points. Nearly all puzzles provide immediate feedback if they have been solved correctly or not through sound effects or visual indication.|$|E
