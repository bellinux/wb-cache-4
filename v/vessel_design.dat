25|$|The 200-mile {{fishing limit}} has changed fishing {{patterns}} and, in recent times, fishing boats {{are becoming more}} specialised and standardised. In the United States and Canada more use is made of large factory trawlers, while the huge blue water fleets operated by Japan and the Soviet-bloc countries have contracted. In western Europe, fishing <b>vessel</b> <b>design</b> is focused on compact boats with high catching power.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of the torpedo boat resulted {{in a flurry of}} activity in navies around the world, as smaller, quicker-firing guns were added to existing ships to ward off the new threat. In the mid-1880s there were developed torpedo gunboats, the first <b>vessel</b> <b>design</b> for the explicit purpose of hunting and destroying torpedo boats. Essentially very small cruisers, torpedo gunboats were equipped with torpedo tubes and an adequate gun armament, intended for hunting down smaller enemy boats.|$|E
25|$|Infernal {{was among}} the last bomb vessels to be built to a two-masted ketch rig design. Over the {{preceding}} decade the Navy Board had considered {{ways to improve the}} handling and seaworthiness of its bomb vessels, including using a three-masted ship rig instead of the ketch. To test this concept, the Board resolved that four Infernal-class bombs, including Infernal herself, would be ketch-rigged and the other three ship-rigged, and that their relative performance would determine future bomb <b>vessel</b> <b>design.</b>|$|E

25|$|On 25 March 2008, in an {{announcement}} that cancelled the bidding {{process for the}} Joint Support Ship Project for Canadian Forces Maritime Command, the Government of Canada placed the coast guard's Mid Shore Patrol Vessel Project on hold due to bids that {{were significantly higher than}} budgeted allocations. The Canadian Coast Guard submitted a modified <b>vessel</b> <b>design</b> based on reduced capabilities and cost. On 26 February 2009, the Government of Canada reissued a call for bids for twelve mid shore patrol vessels.|$|E
2500|$|MV Dartmouth Castle {{was built}} to a classic motor {{passenger}} <b>vessel</b> <b>design,</b> with open decks forward and aft of a lower deck saloon, and an open promenade deck above, with the wheelhouse at its forward end. [...] This wheelhouse was considerably older than the ship, having been originally fitted to the previous Dartmouth Castle - a 1907 vintage paddle steamer. [...] The promenade deck also featured {{a number of very}} tall ventilators, a canopy above, and a rather ugly landing deck - a raised deck allowing passengers to board from a high quayside at low tide.|$|E

Bately then added to Hollond's hull design by lengthening the [...] "fore-rake" [...] – the area of the bow that extended beyond the keel – in order to improve the sloop's stability in heavy swell.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, the KDM {{required}} replacements for three classes of minor war vessel, {{but could not}} afford to replace all 22 ships on a one-for-one basis. Instead of building dedicated replacements for each role, the KDM {{came up with the idea}} for a single <b>vessel</b> <b>design</b> which could be modified to assume a particular role when needed. Equipment common to all roles would be built into the ship, while mission specific payloads would be built into modules, which could be fitted into standardised slots aboard the ship when needed. This modular payload system came to be known as [...] "Standard Flex", or [...] "StanFlex" [...] for short.|$|E

2500|$|The {{primary role}} {{foreseen}} for the RNZN was fisheries protection, particularly following {{the introduction of}} a [...] Exclusive Economic Zone by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea; this was thought to require a minimum of six vessels to effectively police. Peace campaigners claimed that the purchase of the Anzacs was a politically motivated decision made under pressure from Australia, which was trying to support its shipbuilding industry, and stated that the Fourth Labour Government was undermining its commitment to reduce the nation's deficit by spending so much on high-tech warships (although figures of $NZ20 billion for purchase and 20 years of operation was misquoted as an upfront lump sum). There were also concerns that by possessing modern warships, New Zealand would be [...] "dragged" [...] back into ANZUS. One proposal suggested to avoid this was that the New Zealand Anzacs be fitted with inferior engines that would reduce the vessels' top speed and make it impossible to operate with United States Navy fleets. However, these changes would have incurred major additional expenses. A recurring alternate proposal was the purchase of the British Castle-class patrol <b>vessel</b> <b>design.</b> Two months after tenders for the project closed, the managing director of Svendborg Skibsværft began to campaign for the construction of the Danish IS-86 patrol vessel (later designated the Thetis-class frigate) for the RNZN. In response to these proposals, the government indicated that it was committing to purchasing Australian ships, and that interoperability with the RAN (which the alternate ship designs were incapable of) was a major element in the decision.|$|E
