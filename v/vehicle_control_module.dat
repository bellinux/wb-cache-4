The applied software update also improves the car’s on-board range calculation system, which several Leaf owners reported was overestimating the number of miles left. In addition, the update changes the state-of-charge bars display to provide a true reserve capacity; the driver now has up to five miles to find a charging spot after the car reaches the zero miles remaining mark.|$|E
50|$|Delco Electronics, then a {{subsidiary}} of GM Hughes Electronics, developed a version of Modula-2 for embedded control systems starting in 1985. Delco named it Modula-GM. It was the first high level language used to replace machine language code for embedded systems in Delco's engine control units (ECUs). This was significant because Delco was producing over 28,000 ECUs per day in 1988 for GM; this was then the world's largest producer of ECUs. The first experimental use of Modula-GM in an embedded controller was in the 1985 Antilock Braking System Controller {{which was based on}} the Motorola 68xxx microprocessor, and in 1993 Gen-4 ECU used by the CART (Championship Auto Racing Teams) and IRL (Indy Racing League) teams. The first production use of Modula-GM was its use in GM trucks starting with the 1990 model year VCM (<b>Vehicle</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Module)</b> used to manage GM Powertrain's Vortec engines. Modula-GM was also used on all ECUs for GM's 90° Buick V6 family 3800 Series II used in the 1997-2005 model year Buick Park Avenue. The Modula-GM compilers and associated software management tools were sourced by Delco from Intermetrics.|$|E

5000|$|A form {{of fraud}} is {{to tamper with}} the reading on an mileometer/odometer and {{presenting}} the incorrect number of miles/kilometers traveled to a prospective buyer; this {{is often referred to}} as [...] "clocking" [...] in the UK and [...] "Busting miles" [...] in the US. This is done to make a car appear to have been driven less than it really has been, and thus increase its apparent market value. Most [...] new cars sold today use digital odometers that store the mileage in the <b>vehicle's</b> engine <b>control</b> <b>module</b> making it difficult (but not impossible) to manipulate the mileage electronically. With mechanical odometers, the speedometer can be removed from the car dashboard and the digits wound back, or the drive cable can be disconnected and connected to another odometer/speedometer pair while on the road. Older vehicles can be driven in reverse to subtract mileage, a property that provides the premise for a classic scene late in the comedy film Ferris Bueller's Day Off, but modern odometers add mileage driven in reverse to the total as if driven forward, thereby accurately reflecting the true total wear and tear on the vehicle.|$|R

40|$|This work {{introduces}} the main aspects related {{with a new}} architecture defined for an ongoing research project named RAUVI (i. e. Reconfigurable AUV for Intervention Missions). Two initially independent architectures for the underwater vehicle and the robotic arm have been combined into a new schema that allows for reactive and deliberative behaviours on both subsystems. Reactive actions are performed through a low-level control layer in communication with the robot hardware via an abstraction interface. On the other hand, the intervention mission is supervised at a high-level by a Mission Control System (MCS), implemented using the Petri net formalism. Both, the arm and <b>vehicle</b> perception and <b>control</b> <b>modules</b> communicate with the MCS by means of actions and events. They also share a centralized database where some sensor data is stored. The proposed architecture allows for the supervised execution of intervention missions requiring a tight coordination between the vehicle and the manipulator.

40|$|Environmental {{perception}} and information processing are two key steps of active safety for vehicle reversing. Single-sensor environmental perception cannot meet {{the need for}} vehicle reversing safety due to its low reliability. In this paper, we present a novel multi-sensor environmental perception method using low-rank representation and a particle filter for vehicle reversing safety. The proposed system consists of four main steps, namely multi-sensor environmental perception, information fusion, target recognition and tracking using low-rank representation and a particle filter, and <b>vehicle</b> reversing speed <b>control</b> <b>modules.</b> First of all, the multi-sensor environmental perception module, based on a binocular-camera system and ultrasonic range finders, obtains the distance data for obstacles behind the vehicle when the vehicle is reversing. Secondly, the information fusion algorithm using an adaptive Kalman filter is used to process the data obtained with the multi-sensor environmental perception module, which greatly improves the robustness of the sensors. Then {{the framework of a}} particle filter and low-rank representation is used to track the main obstacles. The low-rank representation is used to optimize an objective particle template that has the smallest L- 1 norm. Finally, the electronic throttle opening and automatic braking is under control of the proposed <b>vehicle</b> reversing <b>control</b> strategy prior to any potential collisions, making the reversing control safer and more reliable. The final system simulation and practical testing results demonstrate the validity of the proposed multi-sensor environmental perception method using low-rank representation and a particle filter for vehicle reversing safety...|$|R
40|$|Nonlinear <b>vehicle</b> <b>control</b> {{allocation}} {{is achieved}} through distributing {{the task of}} <b>vehicle</b> <b>control</b> among individual tire forces, which are constrained to nonlinear saturation conditions. A high-level sliding mode control with adaptive upper bounds is considered to assess the body yaw moment and lateral force for the vehicle motion. The proposed controller only requires the online adaptation of control gains without acquiring the knowledge of upper bounds on system uncertainties. Static and dynamic control allocation approaches have been formulated to distribute high-level control objectives among the system inputs. For static control allocation, the interior-point method is applied to solve the formulated nonlinear optimization problem. Based on the dynamic control allocation method, a dynamic update law is derived to allocate <b>vehicle</b> <b>control</b> to tire forces. The allocated tire forces are fed into a low-level <b>control</b> <b>module,</b> where the applied torque and active steering angle at each wheel are determined through a slip-ratio controller and an inverse tire model.
