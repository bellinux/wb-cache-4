25|$|In weightlessness, astronauts {{must rely}} {{much more on}} vision to {{maintain}} their spatial orientation, because the otolith organs can no longer signal the “down” direction. During prolonged exposure, however, reliance seems to shift toward an intrinsic, body <b>vertical</b> <b>reference.</b> The erroneous illusions of self-motion during head movements performed during and after return to Earth gravity are presumably due to a re-interpretation of vestibular inputs. Ground-based {{studies suggest that the}} CNS resolves the “tilt-translation” ambiguity based on the frequency content of the linear acceleration detected by the otolith organs, with low frequency indicating “tilt” and high frequency indicating “translation”. A crossover exists at about 0.3Hz where the otolith signals are then ambiguous. Exposure to weightlessness presumably results in a shift of this crossover frequency, which could then contribute to spatial disorientation and SMS.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – VDatum is a {{software}} tool {{developed by the}} National Ocean Service that allows users to transform geospatial data among a variety of geoidal, ellipsoidal, and tidal vertical datums. This is important to coastal applications that rely on vertical accuracy in bathymetric, topographic, and coastline data sets. The VDatum software {{can be applied to}} a single point location or to a batch data file. Applying VDatum to an entire data set can be particularly useful when merging multiple data sources together, where they must first all be referenced to a common vertical datum. Emerging technologies, such as lidar and kinematic GPS data collection, can also benefit from VDatum in providing new approaches for efficiently processing shoreline and bathymetric data with accurate <b>vertical</b> <b>referencing.</b> Given the numerous applications that can benefit from having a vertical datum transformation tool, the goal is to develop a seamless nationwide VDatum utility that would facilitate more effective sharing of vertical data and also complement a vision of linking such data through national databases...|$|R

40|$|Sea level {{observations}} {{made in the}} Venice Lagoon between 1751 and 1792 {{have been}} recovered, consisting of two time series of daily data on high and low waters in Venice and Chioggia. From comparisons with modern observations, {{the quality of the}} 18 th century data appears to be good enough to allow a useful analysis. A composite time series of daily mean sea level is obtained by merging the 18 th century data and 1872 – 2004 observations in Venice Punta della Salute. The absence of reliable information on <b>vertical</b> <b>references</b> prevents the connection of the two 18 th century time series {{with each other and with}} modern observations. However, daily sea level anomalies relative to the mean sea level enable us to recognize storm surge events that appear to occur more frequently in the second half of the 18 th century than in the late 19 th and 20 th centuries, particularly during the 1751 – 1769 period. The record-breaking storm surge of 4 November 1966 turns out to be a remarkable event even in comparison to the events extracted from the 18 th century time series. Further work is required to fill the gap between the old and modern observations...|$|R

40|$|Wetland loss in Louisiana {{has been}} {{accelerating}} due primarily to anthropogenic and nature processes, {{and is being}} advocated as a problem with national importance. Accurate measurement or modeling of wetland-wide water level changes, its varying extent, its storage and discharge changes resulting in part from sediment loads, erosion and subsidence are fundamental to assessment of hurricane-induced flood hazards and wetland ecology. Here, we use innovative method to integrate interferometric SAR (InSAR) and satellite radar altimetry for measuring absolute or geocentric water level changes and applied the methodology to remote areas of swamp forest in coastal Louisiana. Coherence analysis of InSAR pairs suggested that the HH polarization is preferred {{for this type of}} observation, and polarimetric analysis can help to identi:fy double-bonnce backscattering areas in the wetland. Envisat radar altimeter-measured 18 - Hz (along-track sampling of 417 m) water level data processed with regional stackfile method have been used to provide <b>vertical</b> <b>references</b> for water bodies separated by levees. The high-resolution (approx. 40 m) relative water changes measured from ALOS PALSAR L-band and Radarsat-l C-band InSAR are then integrated with Envisat radar altimetry to obtain absolute water level. The resulting water level time series were validated with in situ gauge observations within the swamp forest. Furthermore, we compare our water elevation changes with 2 D flood modeling from LISFLOOD hydrodynamic model. Our study demonstrates that this new technique allows retrospective reconstruction and concurrent monitoring of water conditions and flow dynamics in wetlands, especially those lacking gauge networks...|$|R

40|$|The {{choice of}} a {{reference}} posture is important when investigating rearfoot motion in clinical populations. The reference posture used may affect {{the magnitude of the}} peak angles and therefore may not enable comparison of the rearfoot kinematics across different populations. This study examined the relationship between the rearfoot frontal plane pattern of motion and three reference postures during the stance phase of walking in healthy and patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) subjects. The three reference postures investigated were: Relaxed Standing posture, subtalar joint neutral position (STJN) and when the calcaneus and the lower leg were vertically aligned (Vertical Alignment). The rearfoot inversion/eversion during the stance phase was measured in 14 healthy subjects and 13 subjects with diagnosed PFPS using three dimensional motion analysis with the three different reference postures. The graphs of rearfoot inversion/eversion motion were overlaid with the angle at the rearfoot in the static posture and any intersection between the static angle and rearfoot motion was noted. An ANOVA showed significant differences in static posture between the groups for Relaxed Standing (p = 0. 01), and STJN (p = 0. 02). For both groups, with Relaxed Standing as a reference posture, the mean rearfoot pattern of motion did not intersect the Relaxed Standing static angle during the stance phase. The use of <b>Vertical</b> Alignment <b>reference</b> posture, however, showed an intersection of this reference posture through the rearfoot pattern of motion. The use of the <b>Vertical</b> Alignment <b>reference</b> posture also generated a typical rearfoot motion pattern for both groups and therefore it may be an appropriate reference posture for both healthy and PFPS individual...|$|R
