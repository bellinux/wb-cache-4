40|$|Architecture design, {{also thought}} of more loosely as layout design {{within the context}} of {{conceptual}} design, is one stage of the mechanical design process that significantly impacts product performance in terms of manufacturing, assembly, modularity, product family <b>variety,</b> <b>maintenance,</b> etc. This design step is special because it marks an occasion when many effects, including geometric concerns, come into play simultaneously on a large scale. The purpose of this research is to investigate the architecture design phase and develop a new design method as there is currently no consensus regarding a best strategy for dealing with architecture design. The resulting method is based primarily on the development of a formal representation and a set of guidelines derived from an empirical product study. Each of these three main deliverables are assessed and validated as part of their development. Based on the concept of a mental model, a representation is developed which consists of a lexicon and a six element notation known as the architecture workframe. Terms of the lexicon provide a well-defined means to describ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{preliminary results}} from {{research into the}} current sociolinguistic situation in the three areas {{that make up the}} Val de Xálima (Extremadura, Spain). Since the Middle Ages three linguistic varieties pertaining to the Galician-Portuguese language system have existed in this area. This community constitutes a sociolinguistic laboratory in which to observe the behaviour of languages in contact (i. e. the local varieties and Spanish), with regard to issues such as identity construction, social cohesion, language maintenance and loss. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present an analysis of practices, attitudes and ideologies in this linguistic community, especially among the young population, to determine what factors promote ongoing local <b>variety</b> <b>maintenance.</b> The data were collected through a questionnaire. The results of the study suggest that, unlike many community enclaves, the Valley shows very high indicators of language vitality because of continued intergenerational transmission as well as the community’s deep-rooted appreciation of local speech varieties. However, the linguistic vitality of this enclave is now challenged by accelerating economic growth and increasingly intensive trade with outside areas ensuing from structural changes in the region over the past two decades...|$|E
40|$|The {{need for}} an {{appropriate}} research strategy to build upon the knowledge of sorghum farmers in north-east Ghana in terms of diversity management and <b>variety</b> <b>maintenance</b> was identified in a previous diagnostic study. A joint experimental framework was established to encourage interaction between the knowledge systems of farmers and scientists. The paper focuses on outlining the process and outcome of the joint learning approach adopted. Researchers and farmers used scientific experimentation both to investigate inter-varietal, intra-varietal and random variation in sorghum. For better understanding and exchange of ideas, researchers sought to understand farmers' concepts of a variety and how they perceive diversity (i. e. researchers sought to enter into and interrogate the farmer knowledge system). Results provide evidence that farmers' management practices are shaped by local perceptions of diversity, and that systematic exploration of both scientific and local ideas, aimed at points of convergence might help farmers better to link their management practices to variation revealed through experimentation. It has been widely reported that African farmers are willing experimenters, but the present study offers specific evidence on the advantages of using a joint experimental approach to enhance farmers' capacity to understand complex phenomena associated with plant variation...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{sought to}} address two basic questions: (1) How should maintenance practices {{be designed to}} accommodate specific characteristics of different production technologies? (2) How does the fit between production technology and the management of maintenance impact maintenance performance? Production technology was described by three characteristics: technical complexity, interdependence and technical <b>variety.</b> <b>Maintenance</b> performance was measured by total maintenance cost and by maintenance contributions to reductions in production costs and improvements in product quality and equipment availability. ^ Eleven hypotheses were developed and tested using data collected from sample of 180 manufacturing plants. Data were obtained using a survey that {{was sent to the}} Production Manager and Maintenance Manager in each plant. Chi-square tests were used to test hypotheses that certain maintenance practices would be closely associated with higher levels of technical complexity, interdependence and technical variety. Analysis of variance and analysis of covariance were used to test the performance hypotheses. These hypotheses predicted that maintenance performance would be higher when high technical complexity, interdependence or technical variety was accompanied by maintenance practices that increased communication and coordination, improved technical expertise or supported equipment failure response and prevention. ^ Of the three characteristics of production technology, technical complexity was found to have the greatest association with the use of different maintenance practices. The performance hypotheses received little support. However, the use of cross-functional maintenance teams and the use of preventive and predictive maintenance programs were found to result in improved maintenance performance regardless of the type of production technology in use. ...|$|E
40|$|Product {{modularity}} {{is often}} seen as {{a means by which}} a product system can be decomposed into smaller, more manageable chunks in order to better manage design, manufacturing and after-sales complexity. The most common approach is to decompose the product down to component level and then group the components to form modules. The rationale for module grouping can vary, from the more technical physical and functional component interactions, to any number of strategic objectives such as <b>variety,</b> <b>maintenance</b> and recycling. The problem lies with the complexity of product modularity under these multiple (often conflicting) objectives. The research in this thesis presents a holistic multi-objective computer aided modularity optimisation (CAMO) framework. The framework consists of four main steps: 1) product decomposition; 2) interaction analysis; 3) formation of modular architectures and; 4) scenario analysis. In summary of these steps: the product is first decomposed into a number a basic components by analysis of both the physical and functional product domains. The various dependencies and strategic similarities that occur between the product s components are then analysed and entered into a number of interaction matrixes. A specially developed multi-objective grouping genetic algorithm (MOGGA) then searches the matrices and provides a whole set of alternative (yet optimal) modular product configurations.

However, in an effort to phonetically switch to a more standard variety of Spanish in the read-aloud task, speakers' overgeneralization of the tap led to neutralization of the tap/trill contrast and partial loss of their native Spanish variety's intervocalic phonemic contrast...|$|R
40|$|Low {{productivity}} of groundnut-based systems, afl atoxin regulations, and stricter grades and standards have lowered {{the competitiveness of}} the West African groundnut in the domestic, regional and international markets. To regain its market, groundnut productivity has to increase through the adoption of new technologies {{and the development of}} sustainable seed systems. The availability and uptake of high quality seed by farmers is fundamental to the transformation of predominant traditional agricultural production practices to achieve increased stability and sustainable food production in West Africa. New seeds with higher yield potential or ability to relieve constraints faced by farmers in using traditional varieties form part of the improved inputs required to increase crop production. Previous support by the CFC and ICRISAT has been largely successful in germplasm conservation, <b>variety</b> <b>maintenance</b> and the development of appropriate groundnut varieties that meet farmers’ preferences and market requirements. Governments have attempted to develop seed multiplication and distribution schemes through state seed projects. However, in the light of increased liberalization of economies and structural adjustment policies, governments are disengaging from seed production and distribution activities. There is therefore a need to rethink alternative and sustainable arrangements for seed production and delivery schemes. This technical paper summarizes information on the structure, conduct and performance of formal and informal groundnut seed supply systems in the four countries of West Africa namely Mali, Niger, Nigeria and Senegal. It highlights a range of technical, socioeconomic, institutional and policy constraints facing the groundnut seed industry in West Africa. Low and inconsistent supply of breeder seed, poor seed demand estimation, lack of or non-functional national variety release committees, inappropriate institutional arrangements and the biological features of groundnut have limited the private sector entry and the performance of the groundnut seed industry. Options likely to be sustainable should focus on local village seed schemes whereas small-scale private seed entrepreneurs or community-based seed systems should be encouraged to become seed entrepreneurs or engaged in the seed industry. There is evidence of vertical integration between inputs and product markets. Appropriate linkages between seed and grain producers, and grain producers and processors are necessary to drive the private sector entry in the seed industry. It is our hope and expectation that this report will provide valuable information towards improving the performance of groundnut seed markets and offer alternative and sustainable seed multiplication and delivery options to smallholder farmers throughout Sub-Saharan Africa where the economies are still agriculture-dependen...|$|E
40|$|In every time, {{the genetic}} basis of maize {{production}} {{is represented by}} the varieties and hybrids grown on the greatest area. It is interesting to note that, compared with the number of races and varieties available, there has always been {{only a small number of}} varieties that dominated the given maize production era. Chronologically, the Old Hungarian Yellow Flint group of varieties was popular from 1610 – 1914, American dent varieties (Iowa Goldmine, Queen of the Prairie, etc.) from 1900 – 1920, Bánkúti (Late) Dent from 1910 – 1935 and the varieties developed by Fleischmann from 1935 – 1960. Hybrid maize production was based on Mindszentpusztai Yellow Dent up till 1983 and on Iodent from 1983 onwards. Among the varieties previously popular for human consumption (porridge) in Eastern Central Europe, varieties related to Cinquantino and Pignoletto dominated variety use for a long period, and varieties in the Lapusnyaki group for a shorter time. The group of popular varieties, which were originally improved varieties, and others related to them, make up the “useful” part, or “heart core” of the genetic variability of maize in Eastern Central Europe. Due to the special methods employed for variety development and <b>variety</b> <b>maintenance</b> in this region, it is not difficult to identify variants of these previously popular varieties on the basis of morphological traits. These are of potential value. In many cases variety collections also include varieties developed by breeders or farmers, which differ genetically and morphologically from the popular varieties, but only increase the number of items in the collection. Experience shows that the adapted varieties that remained popular for a long period were used in maize breeding as sources of heterosis, while these latter were used as simple gene sources. The pure line method has been used widely and still holds the promise of success. As yet there does not appear to be any fundamentally new method that could replace it to make breeding more efficient. In each era, creative breeders developed competitive new varieties by exploiting the useful genetic variability available, so from the evolutionary point of view, new varieties should be regarded as foundation populations. Banning or restricting the re-utilisation of these populations could block the human regulation of evolution and limit increases in food production. The key question in maize breeding is always the active possession, practical preservation and systematic improvement of the type of biodiversity that is useful from the economic point of view in breeding...|$|E

Moench, small-scale farmers, seed quality. Sub-optimal {{impact of}} agricultural research {{is connected to}} lack of involvement of farmers. This {{is especially true for}} Africa where problems are diverse and complex. Farmer participation might help research to become better focused and resulting technologies more adopted. However, linking researchers and farmers effectively in research is not easy. Even though African farmers are often very innovative, technology development is influenced by other stakeholders and takes place within a wide institutional context and policy framework over which farmers have little control. Convergence of Sciences offers an alternative way of organizing research whereby the agricultural innovation process is recognized as a multi-stakeholder process. This thesis situates science and farmer initiative within the context of sorghum genetic resource management. Sorghum plays a pivotal role in the agrarian life and culture of small farmers in north-east Ghana. The value of genetic diversity for farmers provides strong justification for placing emphasis on, and pursuing research into, two main areas: the need to support farmers' own efforts in diversity management and <b>variety</b> <b>maintenance,</b> and - as an important component of that aspect - the need to pay attention to farmers' seed management and storage practices. The thesis shows how farmers and scientists can effectively engage in agricultural research towards a sustainable use and management of sorghum genetic resources. Convergence is explored between researchers and farmers and between the biosciences and social sciences. The possibility for convergence between farmers, public sector researchers and private sector interests under market-driven conditions for sorghum production is also explored. The results indicate that joint learning and experimentation under local conditions is a useful and effective means through which unschooled small-scale farmers and scientists can actively engage in the research process. Such an approach provides the opportunity for an intensive and sustained interaction between both farmers and scientists. Going along the pathway of experimentation has shown that farmers are capable of joining in scientific research, have an indigenous capacity for astute observation, and are capable of forming a good working notion of science as it is practised in the formal sector. However, a conscious effort must be made to embed these scientific principles in the farmers' local and cultural context {{in order to make the}} capability of farmers as co-researchers become more apparent. Through farmers' own analysis (facilitated and stimulated by researchers) of test data, they correctly infer that in order to improve the physiological seed quality of their early maturing varieties, they need to pay closer attention to the conditions under which harvesting, seed selection, and storage occur. Scientific methods and tools from the biological and social science disciplines are used for gathering and analysing qualitative and quantitative data during the joint learning and experimentation phase of the study and for generating knowledge. Molecular marker techniques from bioscience helped to determine the extent of diversity used by farmers, while anthropological information provided a deeper understanding of how cultural and socio-economic factors influence farmers' use and management of sorghum varieties. The case of contract farming provided the important lesson that making contract farming work is often contingent upon mobilizing both technical and farmer knowledge for technological problem solving. Making technology part of the contracting process helps reinforce among all contracting parties the need to work jointly towards effective solutions to production problems in an uncertain world where effective new knowledge is at a premium. This requires the recognition by contracting companies of the fact that where the technology is an important problem, offering ways of negotiating about the various contributions of relevant parties in the contract would lead to better application of technology. Sorghum remains an important crop for farmers who stand to gain a lot more if researchers commit and apply themselves to partnership with farmers as co-researchers. This thesis has thrown some light on how such partnerships for new and effective knowledge might evolve. Convergence of Sciences, as an alternative approach to the linear model of planning, designing and implementing research, appears to hold much promise for small farmers such as those found in the north-eastern part of Ghan...|$|E
