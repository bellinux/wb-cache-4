25|$|The key {{principle}} of plate tectonics {{is that the}} lithosphere exists as separate and distinct tectonic plates, which ride on the fluid-like (<b>visco-elastic</b> solid) asthenosphere. Plate motions range up to a typical 10–40mm/year (Mid-Atlantic Ridge; about as fast as fingernails grow), to about 160mm/year (Nazca Plate; about as fast as hair grows). The driving mechanism behind this movement is described below.|$|E

A sealed enclosure prevents transmission of the sound emitted {{from the rear of}} the loudspeaker by confining the sound in a rigid and airtight box. Techniques used to reduce transmission of sound through the walls of the cabinet include thicker cabinet walls, lossy wall material, internal bracing, curved cabinet walls—or more rarely, <b>visco-elastic</b> materials (e.g., mineral-loaded bitumen) or thin lead sheeting applied to the interior enclosure walls.|$|E

For instance, in 2003 the techniques of optical tweezers were applied in the field of cell sorting; by creating a large optical intensity pattern over the sample area, cells can be sorted by their intrinsic optical characteristics. Optical tweezers have also been used to probe the cytoskeleton, measure the <b>visco-elastic</b> properties of biopolymers, and study cell motility.

50|$|Memory foam {{mattresses}} use conforming <b>visco-elastic</b> foam over firmer polyurethane base foam. Some innerspring mattresses have {{memory foam}} in their upholstery layer. Different feels and comfort levels are achieved by varying the thickness, weight and {{formulation of the}} <b>visco-elastic</b> foams and the base foams. Latex and memory foam mattresses each provide a unique feel. This type of mattress is good at relieving pressure on painful joints. Many memory foam mattresses are more expensive than standard spring mattresses.|$|E
50|$|The {{polyanionic}} form, {{commonly referred}} to as hyaluronan, is a <b>visco-elastic</b> polymer found in the aqueous and vitreous humour of the eye and in the fluid of articulating joints.|$|E
50|$|Muscles contain many {{different}} systems {{on which the}} evolutionary selection of preflex stabilization can operate. The deltoid muscle, for example, consists of at least seven segments with different bone attachments and neural control. Within each muscle segment, there exists a complex internal structure that goes down to one in which each muscle unit consists of a tendon, aponeurosis, and a fascicle of active contractile and passive elements. Another source of variation is in the internal architecture of the fiber orientation relative to a muscle’s line of action, for example, as found in pennate muscles. The complexities of the different <b>visco-elastic</b> length- and velocity-force relationships of these subparts provides the opportunity for the adaptive selection of structurally complex muscle biocomposites with highly task-tuned nonlinear <b>visco-elastic</b> length- velocity- force relationships. This nature of muscles to be composite structures thus provides the adaptive opportunity for evolution to modify the <b>visco-elastic</b> reactions of the musculoskeletal system so they counteract perturbations {{without the need for}} spinal or higher levels of control.|$|E

50|$|In North America {{the typical}} {{mattress}} sold today is an innerspring; however {{there is increasing}} interest in all-foam beds and so-called hybrid beds, which include both an innerspring and high-end foams such as <b>visco-elastic</b> or latex in the comfort layers.

50|$|Muscles possess {{nonlinear}} <b>visco-elastic</b> properties {{when they}} contract. This property can autocorrect movements when a muscle {{is forced to}} change its length, and at a velocity different from that with which it was originally commanded. Such automatic correction is useful when a commanded action is perturbated, for example, if a step goes into a hole as this causes the foot to unexpectedly stretch down. The nonlinear <b>visco-elastic</b> properties of muscles interact with these perturbation induced velocity and length differences such that they counteract directly, as they happen, the effects upon {{the body of the}} perturbation.Part of the resistance to perturbation is passive, by means of the nonlinear increase in passive tension and joint torques produced by muscular and other soft tissues. Tissue prestress is a preflexive property that constitutes a basal level of passive tension which, due to its presence in antagonistic tissues of a joint, increases joint passive stiffness and stability.|$|E
50|$|A unique use for Reference Point Indentation {{measurements}} is {{to measure}} dynamic changes of a material by cyclic indentation at a set rate. The {{change in the}} load-displacement curve {{as a function of}} cycle can be used to calculate <b>visco-elastic</b> properties of materials, such as tan delta or dynamic phase-change. These capabilities are being used to investigate materials which undergo dynamic loading such as bone, cartilage, and spinal disc.|$|E
50|$|Most {{of these}} polysaccharides exhibit useful <b>visco-elastic</b> {{properties}} when dissolved in water {{at very low}} levels. This makes various liquids used in everyday life, such as some foods, lotions, cleaners, and paints, viscous when stationary, but much more free-flowing when even slight shear is applied by stirring or shaking, pouring, wiping, or brushing. This property is named pseudoplasticity or shear thinning; the study of such matters is called rheology.|$|E
5000|$|Seismic inverse Q-filtering {{employs a}} wave {{propagation}} reversal procedure that compensates for energy absorption and corrects wavelet distortion due to velocity dispersion. [...] By compensating for amplitude attenuation {{with a model}} of the <b>visco-elastic</b> attenuation model type, seismic data can provide true relative-amplitude information for amplitude inversion and subsequent reservoir characterization. By correcting the phase distortion due to velocity dispersion, seismic data with enhanced vertical resolution can yield correct timings for lithological identification.|$|E
5000|$|Preflexes are {{the latent}} {{capacities}} in the musculoskeletal system that auto-stabilize movements {{through the use}} of the nonlinear <b>visco-elastic</b> properties of muscles when they contract. The term [...] "preflex" [...] for such a zero-delay, intrinsic feedback loop was coined by Loeb. [...] Unlike stabilization methods using neurons such as reflexes and higher brain control, it happens with minimal time delay. Its chief disadvantage is that it works only to stabilize the main movements of the musculoskeletal system.|$|E

The dog's paw contains {{a number of}} <b>visco-elastic</b> pads oriented along the middle and distal foot.

Humans possess a tough fibro and elastic pad of fat that is anchored to the skin and bone of the rear portion of the foot.|$|E

50|$|Helmeted {{guineafowl}} {{like many}} other bipedal birds walk upon rough ground. When a guineafowl's leg steps into a hole (a common disruption against which evolution has tuned the nonlinear <b>visco-elastic</b> properties of its musculoskeletal system), a momentarily uncommanded velocity and length change in the muscles that span its leg joints occurs. This length/velocity discrepancy interacts with the nonlinear length and velocity-force relationships that have evolved in response to such a disruption {{with the result that}} the leg extends further into the hole, and thus keeps the bird’s body stable and upright.|$|E
5000|$|For {{the first}} time it is shown that double bonds at {{specific}} sites in the hydrocarbon side-chains of liquid crystals strongly broaden the range of LC-mate-rial parameters, especially the elastic- and <b>visco-elastic</b> constants. First correlations between alkenyl molecules, material parameters and display performance are presented. Numerous new classes of alkenyl liquid crystals - designed and patented in our laboratories between 1984 and 1995 - are based on these findings. Alkenyl liquid crystals have become key components for achieving high information content super-twisted nematic (STN)-LCDs and fast responding, thin-film transistor (TFT)-addressed monitor- and television -LCDs.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the degree}} to which the {{lithosphere}} relaxes over time is still controversial, most workers (Allen & Allen 2005, Flemings & Jordan 1989) accept an elastic or <b>visco-elastic</b> rheology to describe the lithospheric deformation of the foreland basin. Allen & Allen (2005) describe a moving load system, one in which the deflection moves as a wave through the foreland plate before the load system. The deflection shape is commonly described as an asymmetrical low close to the load along the foreland and a broader uplifted deflection along the forebulge. The transport rate or flux of erosion, as well as sedimentation, is a function of topographic relief.|$|E
5000|$|A {{mattress}} pad, mattress topper, or underpad {{is designed}} to lie atop a mattress. Made primarily from foam, its function {{is to provide a}} layer of comfort and warmth between the user and the mattress. It is of particular benefit when the existing mattress is worn or uncomfortable. Toppers quite often have a contoured profile to facilitate airflow. <b>Visco-elastic</b> foam toppers are regularly used in medical institutions because of their pressure relieving properties. The foam used in the construction of these memory foam toppers reacts to both pressure and temperature. This, combined with its greater density, are properties that give them their characteristic [...] "weightlessness" [...] sensation.|$|E
50|$|Shape {{change of}} {{erythrocytes}} under applied forces (i.e., shear forces in blood flow) is reversible and the biconcave-discoid shape, which is normal for most mammals, is maintained after {{the removal of}} the deforming forces. In other words, erythrocytes behave like elastic bodies, while they also resist to shape change under deforming forces. This viscoelastic behavior of erythrocytes is determined by the following three properties: 1) Geometry of erythrocytes; the biconcave-discoid shape provides an extra surface area for the cell, enabling shape change without increasing surface area. This type of shape change requires significantly smaller forces than those required for shape change with surface area expansion. 2) Cytoplasmic viscosity; reflecting the cytoplasmic hemoglobin concentration of erythrocytes. 3) <b>Visco-elastic</b> properties of erythrocyte membrane, mainly determined by the special membrane skeletal network of erythrocytes.|$|E
50|$|Sound damping {{tapes and}} other {{materials}} {{have been used to}} reduce both vibration and sound transmission through materials since the early 1930s. Although the applications of sound damping was largely limited to defense and industrial applications such as naval vessels and aircraft in the past, recent research has proven the effectiveness of damping in interior sound isolation in buildings. Constrained-layer damping gypsum wallboard panels increase sound isolation in building partitions by drastically reducing the vibration of panels and, incidentally, the radiation of sound through panels. The shear loading of a highly <b>visco-elastic</b> interlayer sandwiched between two more rigid constraining layers causes decreased displacement due to vibration, reducing the amount of sound energy radiated through a panel between enclosures. Damped gypsum wallboard panels are effective in reducing sound transmission over a broad range of frequencies and especially useful for achieving high levels of speech privacy between partitions.|$|E
