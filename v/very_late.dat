5|$|At {{the time}} of its discovery, astronomers {{believed}} Sakurai's Object to be a slow nova. Later spectroscopic analysis suggested that the star was not a nova, but had instead undergone a <b>very</b> <b>late</b> thermal pulse similar to that of V605 Aquilae, causing it to vastly expand. V605 Aquilae, which was discovered in 1919, is the only other star known to have been observed during the high luminosity phase of a <b>very</b> <b>late</b> thermal pulse, and models predict that Sakurai's Object, over the next few decades, will follow a similar life cycle.|$|E

However, it is possible that it was executed even later (van der Weyden died in 1464).|$|E

5|$|As indicated, hospice is {{frequently}} under-utilized and often not {{taken advantage of}} until <b>very</b> <b>late</b> in a patient's illness.

5|$|The mass {{extinction}} of marine plankton {{appears to have}} been abrupt and right at the K–Pg boundary. Ammonite genera became extinct at or near the K–Pg boundary; however, there was a smaller and slower extinction of ammonite genera prior to the boundary that was associated with a late Cretaceous marine regression. The gradual extinction of most inoceramid bivalves began well before the K–Pg boundary, and a small, gradual reduction in ammonite diversity occurred throughout the <b>very</b> <b>late</b> Cretaceous.|$|E

Along with Terry and Milly, several of the main enemies, including Mortamor, reappear, however, their previous roles have been eliminated, making them appear as just normal enemies.
