2500|$|The {{theory of}} proxemics is often {{considered}} {{in relation to}} the impact of technology on human relationships. While physical proximity cannot be achieved when people are connected virtually, perceived proximity can be attempted, and several studies have shown that it is a crucial indicator in the effectiveness of <b>virtual</b> <b>communication</b> technologies. [...] These studies suggest that various individual and situational factors influence how close we feel to another person, regardless of distance. [...] The mere-exposure effect originally referred to the tendency of a person to positively favor those who they have been physically exposed to most often. [...] However, recent research has extended this effect to <b>virtual</b> <b>communication.</b> [...] This work suggests that the more someone communicates virtually with another person, the more he is able to envision that person's appearance and workspace, therefore fostering a sense of personal connection. [...] Increased communication has also been seen to foster common ground, or the feeling of identification with another, which leads to positive attributions about that person. [...] Some studies emphasize the importance of shared physical territory in achieving common ground, while others find that common ground can be achieved virtually, by communicating often.|$|E

40|$|Past {{research}} in virtualisation technology has mainly focused on increasing isolation of co-resident virtual machines. At {{the same time}} network intensive applications, such as web services or database applications are being consolidated onto a single physical platform. The isolation properties of virtualisation, however, demand a strict separation of the shared resources. Co-resident virtual machines are therefore forced to fallback to inefficient network emulation for <b>communication.</b> Many inter <b>virtual</b> machine <b>communication</b> methods proposed recently, introduced shared memory, customised libraries or APIs. This is not only unpractical but can also undermine a system’s integrity; moreover transparency and live migration is commonly neglected. Therefore {{in this paper we}} discuss the challenges and requirements for inter <b>virtual</b> machine <b>communication</b> and examine available solutions proposed by academia and industry. We also discuss how the current evolution of virtualisation and modern CPUs pose new challenges for inter <b>virtual</b> machine <b>communication.</b> Finally, we consider the possibility of utilising previously unused CPU capabilities to accommodate an inter <b>virtual</b> machine <b>communication</b> mechanism. ...|$|R

This paper describes the basic concepts {{as well as a}} prototypical implementation of such an environment based on a virtual office metaphor.

5000|$|Emotions in <b>virtual</b> <b>communication</b> {{differ in}} a variety of ways from those in {{face-to-face}} interactions due to the characteristics of computer-mediated communication (CMC).

50|$|The lack {{of social}} and {{emotional}} cues over <b>virtual</b> <b>communication</b> platforms can result in increased instances of misinterpreting emotion and intentions. Kruger, Epley, Parker, and Ng (2005) found that individuals overestimate both their ability to clearly relay and interpret emotions via email.
