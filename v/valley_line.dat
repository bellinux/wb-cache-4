5|$|Sheffield {{does not}} have as {{extensive}} a suburban and inter-urban railway network as other comparable British cities. However, there are several local rail routes running along the city's valleys and beyond, connecting it with other parts of South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, Lincolnshire and Derbyshire. These local routes include the Penistone Line, the Dearne <b>Valley</b> <b>Line,</b> the Hope <b>Valley</b> <b>Line</b> and the Hallam Line. As well as the main stations of Sheffield and Meadowhall, there are five suburban stations, at Chapeltown, Darnall, Woodhouse, and Dore and Totley.|$|E

5|$|The {{east end}} of the Cleveland Railway, from Loftus to Brotton plus the {{connection}} to the Tees <b>Valley</b> <b>Line</b> west of Saltburn, is still in use as a mineral railway serving Boulby Mine. There are no passenger services. The short connection from the Tees <b>Valley</b> <b>Line</b> to Normanby Jetty survived until 1966 as the Normanby Branch of the Tees <b>Valley</b> <b>Line,</b> serving the Normanby brickworks and Eston railway station. It is now a public footpath, the South Bank Walkway, which links Flatts Lane Country Park to South Bank. The middle section of the line from Normanby to Guisborough is in private ownership or has been built on, though the former railway's embankment can still be clearly seen running alongside the A171 Middlesbrough Road. The section from Guisborough to Slapewath has {{been converted into a}} public footpath, the Guisborough Branch Walkway.|$|E
5|$|A line to Horsham, {{now part}} of the Arun <b>Valley</b> <b>Line,</b> was opened on 14 February 1848. A station was {{provided}} next to Crawley High Street from that date. A new station was constructed slightly to the east, in conjunction with the Overline House commercial development, and replaced the original station which closed on 28 July 1968. The ticket office and Up (London-bound) platform waiting areas form the ground floor of the office building.|$|E
5|$|Passenger service {{along the}} Wallkill <b>Valley</b> <b>line</b> ceased in 1937, {{due to the}} {{increased}} usage of automobiles. By December 1958 the building (then owned by the New York Central Railroad) was no longer used as a railroad station. It was sold off in 1959, and hosted a number of local endeavors, serving as a chapter house for the Knights of Columbus and as an office for a public-access television station. Under the ownership of the television station, the roof and floorboards were repaired.|$|E

5|$|Shepton Mallet had railway {{stations}} on two lines, {{both now}} closed. The first station, called Shepton Mallet (High Street) in British Railways days, {{was on the}} East Somerset Railway branch line from Witham and opened in 1859. The line was extended to Wells in 1862 and later connected to the Cheddar <b>Valley</b> <b>line</b> branch of the Bristol and Exeter Railway from Yatton to Wells via Cheddar. Through services between Yatton and Witham started in 1870. The line was absorbed into the Great Western Railway in the 1870s.|$|E

5|$|The {{bridge was}} rebuilt between 1895 and 1896 {{to convert it}} from iron to steel. It was {{repeatedly}} reinforced throughout its existence. When Conrail closed the Wallkill <b>Valley</b> <b>line</b> in 1977, {{the stability of the}} trestle had been one of its primary reasons for doing so. Conrail had tried to sell the bridge as early as 1983, and in 1986 the trestle was sold to a private businessman, John Rahl, for one dollar.|$|E
5|$|The station {{burned down}} in 1907 and was rebuilt later that year. The {{rise of the}} {{automobile}} caused the railroad to end passenger service in 1937; by 1959 the station was completely closed and sold off. After closure, it was used {{for a variety of}} businesses, including serving as a public-access television station. Freight service along the Wallkill <b>Valley</b> <b>line</b> continued until 1977, when the corridor was shut to regular rail traffic.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} reopened by the Great Western Railway in 1926, now called Long Ashton Platform; Ashton by then {{was the name}} of a station on the Teign <b>Valley</b> <b>Line</b> in Devon. Again, the exact date of opening is disputed: most sources state 12 July 1926, but some say 20 September the same year. It was located on the same site as the first station.|$|E

The scheme was to provide an hourly service to Cardiff beginning in 2005, followed by an hourly service to Newport beginning in 2009. The display included artists' impressions of the six new stations, envisaged to be built at Ebbw Vale Parkway Victoria, Llanhilleth, Newbridge, Crosskeys, Risca and Rogerstone. Proposed stations at Crumlin and Ebbw Vale Centre were shown in the Rail Atlas Great Britain and Ireland 11th edition, published 2007. The project was forecast to cost £28,583,544 in October2003.|$|E
5|$|Route 120 passes {{between the}} Meadowlands Racetrack and New Jersey Transit's Meadowlands Rail Line on the East Rutherford {{side of the}} road and {{commercial}} and industrial areas on the Carlstadt {{side of the road}}, intersecting with Gotham Parkway. The route has a southbound exit and entrance to the Meadowlands Sports Complex before it crosses Berrys Creek. Upon crossing the creek, Route 120 continues northwest through industrial and commercial areas, intersecting with Murray Hill Parkway. A short distance past this intersection, the road becomes a four-lane undivided road that crosses New Jersey Transit’s Pascack <b>Valley</b> <b>Line</b> before coming to an interchange with Route 17. Here, Route 120 ends and County Route 120 continues to the west as Paterson Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Route59 {{begins at}} a four-way {{intersection}} with Union County Route610 (CR610; South Avenue) {{in the community}} of Cranford. Route59 heads northwestward, passing a couple of businesses in both directions. The route crosses under the New Jersey Transit-owned Raritan <b>Valley</b> <b>Line</b> at which point the border of Cranford and Garwood runs along the center of the road. The route continues to the northwest, passing businesses before ending at a signalized T-intersection with Route28 (North Avenue). The pavement ends at the intersection though a state-constructed bridge carrying the intersection over a small creek is angled such that a road could continue northwest. Throughout {{the entire length of the}} route, it is four lanes wide (two in each direction). There is no signed speed limit on any portion of the route.|$|E

5|$|The {{area was}} {{originally}} {{settled in the}} late 17thcentury by Jacob Rutsen, a merchant from Albany, but did not become a major population center until the 1825 discovery of Rosendale cement in the region; {{the development of the}} cement industry, and the growth of the Delaware and Hudson Canal along the Rondout Creek and Main Street, gave rise to substantial economic development in Rosendale. The town's cement was used in the construction of numerous national landmarks.
