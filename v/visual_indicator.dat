5|$|MagSafe, a {{magnetic}} charging connector, {{has been replaced}} with USB-C charging. Unlike MagSafe, which provided an indicator light within the user’s field of view to indicate the device's charging status, the USB-C charger has no <b>visual</b> <b>indicator.</b> Instead, the MacBook Pro emits a chime when connected to power. The Macintosh startup chime {{that has been used}} since the first Macintosh in 1984 is now disabled by default. The laptop now boots automatically when the lid is opened.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, the UK's most {{disastrous}} SPAD ever {{occurred at}} Harrow and Wealdstone, in which No. 46242 City of Glasgow was severely damaged. The {{lack of an}} ATC system on most of Britain's railways was at last seen as an urgent issue. From 1956 the BR-designed Automatic Warning System (AWS) was installed. It was similar to ATC but relied on an induced magnetic field rather than an electric current and featured a <b>visual</b> <b>indicator</b> in the cab. The receiving system was installed on the Coronation class locomotives from 1959 onwards. The outward evidence of on-board AWS comprised a protective shield behind the front screw coupling, a box to house the necessary batteries immediately {{in front of the}} cab on the right-hand side and a cylindrical vacuum reservoir above the right-hand running plate.|$|E
25|$|The {{end point}} of most titrations is {{detected}} {{by the use}} of <b>visual</b> <b>indicator</b> but the method can be inaccurate in very dilute or colored solutions. However under the same conditions, a potentiometric method for the detection of the equivalence point can yield accurate results without difficulty. The electrical apparatus required consists of a potentiometer or pH meter with a suitable indicator and reference electrode. The other apparatus consists of a burette, beaker and stirrer.|$|E

500|$|A <b>visual</b> <b>indicator</b> was {{developed}} based on vibrating reeds, which provided a simple panel-mounted [...] "turn left-right" [...] indicator. It was reliable, {{easy to use}} and more immune to erroneous signals than the competing audio based system. Pilots who had flown with both aural and visual systems strongly preferred the visual type, according to a published report. The reed-based solution was passed over by the U.S. government, however, and the audio signals became standard for decades to come.|$|E
500|$|Flying at , {{the pilot}} located his target through a bombsight {{window in the}} cockpit floor. The pilot moved the dive lever to the rear, {{limiting}} the [...] "throw" [...] of the control column. The dive brakes were activated automatically, the pilot set the trim tabs, reduced his throttle and closed the coolant flaps. The aircraft then rolled 180°, automatically nosing the aircraft into a dive. Red tabs protruded from the upper surfaces of the wing as a <b>visual</b> <b>indicator</b> to the pilot that, {{in case of a}} g-induced black-out, the automatic dive recovery system would be activated. The Stuka dived at a 60-90° angle, holding a constant speed of 500–600km/h (350-370mph) due to dive-brake deployment, which increased the accuracy of the Ju 87's aim.|$|E
500|$|The Game Boy's {{black-and-white}} graphics {{resulted in}} changes to Samus's gear that eventually became permanent. In the original Metroid, color {{was used to}} differentiate between Samus's Power Suit and her Varia Suitan upgraded version. However, without color on the Game Boy, the two suits would have appeared similar, requiring the developers to develop a <b>visual</b> <b>indicator</b> for players to determine which suit Samus is wearing. They also updated her Varia Suit, adding round metal shoulders that {{have been a part}} of the suit in every game in the series since then. Nintendo R was also involved in developing the Game Boy Color, a successor to the original Game Boy with a color screen. Nintendo of America's Dan Owsen noted that Nintendo R included a special [...] "Metroid palette" [...] in the Game Boy Color's hardware, which [...] "makes Metroid II look really, really nice on Game Boy Color", remarking that this made the game's graphics comparable to the original Metroid on the Nintendo Entertainment System.|$|E
25|$|Lymph nodes {{may become}} {{discolored}} and inflamed {{with the presence}} of tattoo pigments, but discoloration and inflammation are also <b>visual</b> <b>indicators</b> of melanoma; consequently, diagnosing melanoma in a patient with tattoos is made difficult, and special precautions must be taken to avoid misdiagnoses.|$|R
50|$|A {{graphical}} {{user interface}} (GUI) {{is a type of}} interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices or programs through graphical icons and <b>visual</b> <b>indicators</b> such as secondary notation, as opposed to text-based interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation. GUIs are easier to learn than command-line interfaces (CLIs), which require commands to be typed on the keyboard.|$|R
5000|$|RoHS did {{not require}} any {{specific}} product labeling, however many manufacturers have adopted their own compliance marks to reduce confusion. <b>Visual</b> <b>indicators</b> have included explicit [...] "RoHS compliant" [...] labels, green leaves, check marks, and [...] "PB-Free" [...] markings. Chinese RoHS labels, a lower case [...] "e" [...] within a circle with arrows, can also imply compliance.|$|R
2500|$|The Type C wing {{was fitted}} as standard. Some mid and most late {{production}} Spifire Mk IXs and all Mk XVI were fitted with the Type E wing. While Spitfire IXs converted from Mk VCs had the large teardrop fairings {{on the upper}} surfaces, on the majority of Mk VIIs, VIIIs, IXs and XVIs the teardrop shaped blisters covering the Hispano feed motors were reduced in size and more streamlined than those on the Mk VC. According to A.P 1565J P & L (Spitfire IX, XI and XVI Pilot's Notes) the red painted undercarriage indicator rods, which projected through {{the tops of the}} wings when the undercarriage was down, were used only on early production Mk IXs. When fitted these rods supplemented an [...] "Electric visual indicator" [...] mounted on the instrument panel. The indicator rods seemed to be fitted on all Mk VIIs and VIIs, supplementing the electric <b>visual</b> <b>indicator.</b> A light for the retractable tailwheel was mounted on the instrument panel, just below the main <b>visual</b> <b>indicator.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A {{team led}} by Sottos and Wenle Li has {{developed}} polymeric structural materials that can indicate the presence of damage by changing color. Such self-reporting materials {{can act as a}} color changing warning system. The researchers created a polymer that contained microcapsules of epoxy resin and PH-sensitive dye. Damage to the polymer causes the capsules to break open and the epoxy and dye to mix. The resulting reaction causes the color of the material to change from yellow to red. The deeper the damage, the more intense the color change. [...] This autonomous <b>visual</b> <b>indicator</b> can enable engineers to detect mechanical damage and intervene before a structure is compromised.|$|E
2500|$|Located {{outside of}} the testing chamber {{adjacent}} to the central section, a control room houses fan mechanism controls and the measuring instruments. Outside of the chamber is a large dial [...] "Scala Convenzionale" [...] or [...] "Conventional Scale" [...] to indicate the varying degree of resistance offered by the motorcycle (and rider) to the passing air. Around the circumference of the dial, red lights at each degree provide a <b>visual</b> <b>indicator</b> to the rider and test personnel. This large scale remains visible to the rider in the tunnel during testing and by repositioning himself on the bike he can determine the changing and optimal resistance. A second measurement tool was an alcohol-filled micro-manometer connected to a Pitot tube placed at a 90degree angle to the airflow in the tunnel.|$|E
40|$|Advances in our {{knowledge}} of the structure of working memory suggest that under some circumstances, effectively more processing capacity is available to learners if instructional materials use multiple information modes (e. g. auditory and visual) instead of equivalent single mode formats. This paper examined this modality effect from a cognitive load perspective in three experiments using geometry instruction. In accordance with cognitive load theory, it was predicted that the additional processing capacity provided in an audio/visual format would only enhance learning if mental resources were not devoted to extensive visual based search in order to coordinate auditory and visual information. Using two different areas of geometry, Experiments 1 and 2 found that if visual search was clearly high, then audio-visual instruction was only beneficial if <b>visual</b> <b>indicators</b> in the form of electronic flashing were incorporated into the instructional format. Under high search conditions, a standard audio/visual format without the aid of flashing proved no better than visual only instruction. Experiment 3 attempted to clarify earlier results by using instructional materials trivially low in visual search. Data indicated that a standard, audio-visual format resulted in superior learning to a visual only format. There was no beneficial effect of electronic flashing in Experiment 3, suggesting that <b>visual</b> <b>indicators</b> were not necessary in areas of low visual search. It was concluded that cognitive load as determined by visual search established the effectiveness of <b>visual</b> <b>indicators...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} Malay {{houses are}} built using simple timber-frame structure. They have pitched roofs, porches in the front, high ceilings, many openings {{on the walls}} for ventilation, and are often embellished with elaborate wood carvings. The beauty and quality of Malay wood carvings were meant to serve as <b>visual</b> <b>indicators</b> of the social rank and status of the owners themselves.|$|R
2500|$|The {{graphical}} {{user interface}} (GUI [...] ), {{is a type of}} user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and <b>visual</b> <b>indicators</b> such as secondary notation, instead of text-based user interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation.

50|$|This {{feature is}} also {{frequently}} called (and abbreviated) as visual message waiting indicator (VMWI). A VMWI, {{as defined in}} Telcordia GR-1401-CORE, is a stored program controlled switching (SPCS) system feature that activates and deactivates a <b>visual</b> <b>indicator</b> on customer-premises equipment (CPE) to notify the customer that new messages are waiting. VMWI differs from existing features that use other message indicators, such as audible stuttered dial tone, in that it activates a <b>visual</b> <b>indicator</b> on the CPE. The <b>visual</b> <b>indicator</b> may {{be as simple as}} lighting or flashing a light-emitting diode (LED), or as advanced as displaying a special message on a liquid-crystal display (LCD).|$|E

50|$|Some {{aircraft}} {{provide a}} <b>visual</b> <b>indicator</b> of propeller synchronization in the cockpit. Pilots {{can use this}} indicator {{to decide whether or}} not to engage propeller synchronization, or to help them synchronize propeller speeds manually.|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} a {{dashboard}} is more loosely defined. Dashboards are usually a series of graphics, charts, gauges and other <b>visual</b> <b>indicators</b> that can be monitored and interpreted. Even {{when there is a}} strategic link, on a dashboard, it may not be noticed as such since objectives are not normally present on dashboards. However, dashboards can be customized to link their graphs and charts to strategic objectives.|$|R

40|$|A {{maneuver}} envelope {{warning system}} for an aircraft having operating limits, operating condition sensors and an indicator driver. The indicator driver has {{a plurality of}} <b>visual</b> <b>indicators.</b> The indicator driver determines a relationship between sensed operating conditions and the operating limits; such as, a ratio therebetween. The indicator driver illuminates {{a number of the}} indicators in proportion to the determined relationship. The position of the indicators illuminated represents to a pilot in an easily ascertainable manner whether the operational conditions are approaching operational limits of the aircraft, {{and the degree to which}} operational conditions lie within or exceed operational limits...|$|R
50|$|Two fifty-metre arcs: a {{circular}} arc {{at each end}} of the field drawn between the boundary lines at a distance of 50m from the centre of the goal-line.

5000|$|Power {{output is}} [...] at 7700 rpm for {{a top speed}} of 137 mph (220 km/h). Smaller Weber 34 DCNF carburetors, a lower final drive ratio and skinnier tires {{completed}} the technical changes for the 208. Chrome (rather than black) accents outside and the lack of fog lights were external <b>visual</b> <b>indicators</b> of the smaller-engined GT4. Inside the 208 GT4 featured a black rather than silver dash facing.|$|R
40|$|A {{dashboard}} is a visualization {{technique that}} provides an immediate view or snapshot of {{exactly where you}} are in a specific process relative to your stated goals and objectives. <b>Visuals</b> <b>indicators,</b> such as temperature gauges, traffic lights and speedometers, help give you a real-world sense of your present progress and assist you in making decisions, adapting to current conditions or drilling into more detailed information. In a previous paper (Wright, 2008), we outlined technologies {{that can be used to}} build dashboards and we further that discussion with information that will help you build your first dashboard. We then walk through the process of building your first dashboard step by step by step, beginning with design considerations and SAS options for creating dashboards, then continue with defining some key performance indicators (KPIs), connecting our data, customizing the <b>visual</b> <b>indicators</b> and then learning more about ways to make the dashboard actionable through drill down and click-through. Finally, we will conclude with a discussion of additional customizations that can be performed with the SAS Enterprise Business Intelligence Platform...|$|R
30|$|Due {{to limited}} time and funds, {{the sample size}} {{of this study was}} small and may not be {{representative}} of all Chinese drivers; this methodological flaw means that the results may be not statistically sound. Moreover, driver’s <b>visual</b> <b>indicators</b> are highly sensitive to individual physiological and psychological conditions (Das et al. 2015), which can be dramatically affected by ambient stimulus, and consequently, the collected visual data may potentially contain inaccuracies due to temporary environmental effects.|$|R
50|$|A cue mark, {{also known}} as a cue dot, a {{changeover}} cue or simply a cue is a <b>visual</b> <b>indicator</b> used with motion picture film prints, usually placed on the right-hand upper corner of a frame of the film.

50|$|Natively, polipo {{comes as}} a highly {{specialized}} command-line interface (CLI) software application, which requires commands to be typed on the keyboard and parameters stored in configuration text files. Alternatively, polipo allows users to run the program automated and non-interactively, such as in a shell script. By starting a GUI wrapper application users can intuitively interact with polipo, start and stop it and change its working parameters, through graphical icons and <b>visual</b> <b>indicators.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Visual</b> Glide Slope <b>Indicator</b> or <b>Visual</b> Glideslope <b>Indicator</b> (VGSI) is {{a ground}} device that uses lights to assist a pilot in landing an {{airplane}} at an airport. The lights define a vertical approach path {{during the final}} approach to a runway and can help the pilot determine if the airplane is too high or too low for an optimum landing.|$|R
5000|$|Result: Light is {{received}} from multiple directions with each light source producing overlapping shadows which cancel-out each other. This dulls {{the area and}} removes indicators such as tones and contrast, {{making it difficult to}} discern similarly coloured slope features. The loss of <b>visual</b> <b>indicators</b> of shape and edge detail results in objects and features seeming to blend into each other, producing a flat featureless vista. An effect of visual blending may be a loss of depth of field resulting in disorientation.|$|R
