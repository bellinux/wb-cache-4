40|$|High power, high-energy, rare-earth-doped {{fiber laser}} sources are now {{considered}} a suitable option {{for a number}} of applications in Medicine, Telecom, LIDAR and industrial applications. Regarding the generation of high-energy pulses, there is a compromise between gain <b>volume</b> <b>and</b> M² <b>value</b> <b>or</b> beam parameter product for the generation of pulses with useful energy content, for the aforementioned applications and good pulse shape and even a Gaussian output. In this paper, we will present a set of large mode area fiber designs along with full optical characterization data will be presented. Results on energy per pulse from 4 to 20 KHz repetition rate and up to 1. 3 mJ energy for a 350 um inner cladding LMA fiber will be discussed among other fiber designs. All fibres were made from proprietary procedures and will be employed in micromachining applications such as metal deposition in applications where laser-assisted cold spraying processes are used. A full review of our LMA fibre designs will be presented...|$|R

40|$|The {{oxidative}} ratio (OR) {{of the net}} ecosystem {{carbon balance}} is the ratio of net O 2 and CO 2 fluxes resulting from photosynthesis, respiration, decomposition, and other lateral and vertical carbon flows. The OR of the terrestrial biosphere must be well characterized to accurately estimate the terrestrial CO 2 sink using atmospheric measurements of changing O 2 and CO 2 levels. To estimate the OR of the terrestrial biosphere, measurements are needed {{of changes in the}} <b>OR</b> of aboveground <b>and</b> belowground carbon pools associated with decadal timescale disturbances (e. g., land use change <b>and</b> fire). The <b>OR</b> of aboveground pools can be measured using conventional approaches including elemental analysis. However, measuring the OR of soil carbon pools is technically challenging, <b>and</b> few soil <b>OR</b> data are available. In this paper we test three solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques for measuring soil OR, all based on measurements of the closely related parameter, organic carbon oxidation state (Cox). Two of the three techniques make use of a molecular mixing model which converts NMR spectra into concentrations of a standard suite of biological molecules of known Cox. The third technique assigns Cox values to each peak in the NMR spectrum. We assess error associated with each technique using pure chemical compounds and plant biomass standards whose Cox <b>and</b> <b>OR</b> <b>values</b> can be directly measured by elemental analyses. The most accurate technique, direct polarization solid-state 13 C NMR with the molecular mixing model, agrees with elemental analyses to ± 0. 036 Cox units (± 0. 009 OR units). Using this technique, we show a large natural variability in soil Cox <b>and</b> <b>OR</b> <b>values.</b> Soil Cox values have a mean of − 0. 26 and a range from − 0. 45 to 0. 30, corresponding to <b>OR</b> <b>values</b> of 1. 08 ± 0. 06 and a range from 0. 96 to 1. 22. We also estimate the OR of the carbon flux from a boreal forest fire. Analysis of soils from nearby intact soil profiles imply that soil carbon losses associated with the fire had an OR of 1. 091 (± 0. 003). Fire appears to be a major factor driving the soil C pool to higher oxidation states <b>and</b> lower <b>OR</b> <b>values.</b> Episodic fluxes caused by disturbances like fire may have substantially different ORs from ecosystem respiration fluxes and therefore should be better quantified to reduce uncertainties associated with our understanding of the global atmospheric carbon budget...|$|R
