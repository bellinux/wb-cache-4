Although capsaicin-related drugs gained renewed interest as a therapeutic tool, there is also controversy as whether neurogenic inflammation actually takes place in humans. In this study, we verified the involvement of capsaicin in vascular responses that are regarded to be implicated in the cascade of neurogenic inflammatory mechanisms. By means of ex vivo functional experiments on human nasal mucosal vascular beds, the effect and mechanism of action of capsaicin was assessed in the absence and presence of various agents that interfere with potentially related transduction pathways. Ten micromolars of capsaicin induced <b>vasodilatations</b> that were reduced by the selective EP(1) prostanoid receptor antagonist SC 19220 (10 mu M) and almost abolished by the selective COX- 2 inhibitor NS 398 (1 mu M) and the EP(1 / 3) receptor agonist sulprostone (0. 1 - 10 nM), but not affected by the TRPV 1 -antagonists capsazepine (5 mu M), the neurokinin NK(1) receptor antagonist GR 20517 A (1 mu M), and the calcitonin-gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist CGRP 8 - 37 (100 nM).

40|$|Endothelial cells, under given circumstances, can {{initiate}} contraction (constriction) of the vascular {{smooth muscle}} cells that surround them. Such endothelium-dependent, acute increases in contractile tone can {{be due to}} the withdrawal of the production of nitric oxide, to the production of vasoconstrictor peptides (angiotensin II, endothelin- 1), to the formation of oxygen-derived free radicals (superoxide anions) and/or the release of vasoconstrictor metabolites of arachidonic acid. The latter have been termed endothelium-derived contracting factor (EDCF) as they can contribute to moment-to-moment changes in contractile activity of the underlying vascular smooth muscle cells. To judge from animal experiments, EDCF-mediated responses are exacerbated by aging, spontaneous hypertension and diabetes. To judge from human studies, they contribute to the blunting of endothelium-dependent <b>vasodilatations</b> in aged subjects and essential hypertensive patients. Since EDCF causes vasoconstriction by activation of the TP-receptors on the vascular smooth muscle cells, selective antagonists at these receptors prevent endothelium-dependent contractions, and curtail the endothelial dysfunction in hypertension and diabetes. © 2005 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|Aging is an {{independent}} risk factor for cardiovascular disease {{that is associated with}} chronic inflammation. The turnover of the endothelial layer is accelerated in aged subjects and endothelial dysfunction is observed after regeneration. Such dysfunction is the first stage of vascular disease. It is characterized by a reduced availability of nitric oxide (NO, an important mediator that inhibits vasomotor tone), thrombosis and vascular inflammation. The reduced availability of NO associated with aging not only results in blunted endothelium-dependent <b>vasodilatations,</b> but also leads to sequential oxidative and pro-inflammatory events that ultimately facilitate the occurrence of atherosclerosis. Increased intracellular oxidative stress is due not only to the augmented expression of oxidant-generating enzymes, such as NADPH oxidase, xanthine oxidase and uncoupled endothelial NO synthase, but also to the down-regulation of endothelial anti-oxidative enzymes, in particular mitochondrial superoxide dismutases. Consequently, the accumulated oxidative stress causes modifications of key proteins (nitrosylation by peroxynitrite), facilitation of the production of endothelium-dependent vasoconstrictor prostanoids and activation of stress-responsive mechanisms (transcription factors in particular nuclear factor kB). These events initiate a proinflammatory response, a key initial event in the genesis of the atherosclerotic plaque...|$|R

High-performance liquid chromatography (LC) analysis demonstrated that bovine coro-nary arterial endothelial cells can metabolize DHA via lipoxyge-nases, and one of the major products was confirmed to be 17 S-HDHA by LC-tandem mass spectrometry. In isolated per-fused small bovine coronary arteries, 17 S-HDHA (109 to 105 M) caused a concentration-dependent dilation with a maximum dilator response of 87. 8 2. 5 %, which is much more potent than the dilator response of its precursor, DHA.

In the inside-out mode, but not in the cell-attached mode, 17 S-HDHA dramatically increased the BKCa channel activity, which was substantially blocked by ibe-riotoxin.

40|$|The {{endothelium}} can evoke relaxations (dilatations) of {{the underlying}} vascular smooth muscle, by releasing vasodilator substances. The best characterized endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) is nitric oxide (NO). The endothelial cells also evoke hyperpolarization of the cell membrane of vascular smooth muscle (endothelium-dependent hyperpolarizations, EDHF-mediated responses). Endothelium-dependent relaxations involve both pertussis toxin-sensitive G i (e. g. responses to serotonin and thrombin) and pertussis toxin-insensitive G q (e. g. adenosine diphosphate and bradykinin) coupling proteins. The release of NO by the endothelial cell can be up-regulated (e. g. by oestrogens, exercise and dietary factors) and down-regulated (e. g. oxidative stress, smoking and oxidized low-density lipoproteins). It is reduced {{in the course of}} vascular disease (e. g. diabetes and hypertension). Arteries covered with regenerated endothelium (e. g. following angioplasty) selectively loose the pertussis toxin-sensitive pathway for NO release which favours vasospasm, thrombosis, penetration of macrophages, cellular growth and the inflammatory reaction leading to atherosclerosis. In addition to the release of NO (and causing endothelium-dependent hyperpolarizations), endothelial cells also can evoke contraction (constriction) {{of the underlying}} vascular smooth muscle cells by releasing endothelium-derived contracting factor (EDCF). Most endothelium-dependent acute increases in contractile force are due to the formation of vasoconstrictor prostanoids (endoperoxides and prostacyclin) which activate TP receptors of the vascular smooth muscle cells.

Thus, we have aimed to compare skin capillary structure and functional density, cutaneous vasomotion (spontaneous oscillations of arteriolar diameter), which ensures optimal blood flow distribution to skin capillaries) and cutaneous microvascular blood flow and reactivity between ten men with lepromatous leprosy (without any other comorbidity) and ten age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Orthogonal polarization spectral imaging was used to evaluate skin capillary morphology and functional density and laser Doppler flowmetry to evaluate blood flow, vasomotion and spectral analysis of flowmotion (oscillations of blood flow generated by vasomotion) and microvascular reactivity, in response to iontophoresis of acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside.

METHODS: Isolated renal arteries were mounted on a wire myograph apparatus were tissues treated with the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N-omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (NAME; 100 mumol/L) and indomethacin (10 mumol/L) and precontracted with phenylephrine (0. 1 mumol/L). NAME and indomethacin treated Carbachol (0. 01 - 10 mumol/L) - or sodium nitroprusside (SNP; 1 - 300 nmol/L) -induced mediated relaxations were observed {{in the presence of}} gap junction inhibitors. RESULTS - Carbachol produced a concentration-dependent relaxation in tissues treated with NAME (100 mumol/L) and indomethacin (10 mumol/L). This relaxation was not affected by hemoglobin (3 mumol/L), but was inhibited by charybdotoxin (200 mumol/L) and ouabain (30 mumol/L). The putative gap junction inhibitors, GAP 27 peptides with sequence homology to connexins 40 and 43 respectively reduced carbachol- but not SNP-induced relaxations mediated by endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) -mediated relaxations. The inhibition by the connexin 43 inhibitor was greater than that of the connexin 40 inhibitor. CONCLUSION - Tne results indicate the presence of gap junctions sensitive to (43) GAP 27 and (40) GAP 27 in the rat renal artery and each of these different types of gap junctions plays a role in the NO- and PGI(2) -independent relaxations induced by carbachol in this blood vessel.

40|$|GABAergic interneurons {{are local}} integrators of {{cortical}} activity {{that have been}} reported {{to be involved in the}} control of cerebral blood flow through their ability to produce vasoactive molecules and their rich innervation of neighboring blood vessels. They form a highly diverse population among which the serotonin 5 -hydroxytryptamine 3 A receptor (5 -HT 3 A) -expressing interneurons share a common developmental origin, in addition to the responsiveness to serotonergic ascending pathway. We have recently shown that these neurons regroup two distinct subpopulations within the somatosensory cortex: Neuropeptide Y (NPY) -expressing interneurons, displaying morphological properties similar to those of neurogliaform cells, and Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) -expressing bipolar/bitufted interneurons. The aim of the present study was to determine the role of these neuronal populations in the control of vascular tone by monitoring blood vessels diameter changes, using infrared videomicroscopy in mouse neocortical slices. Bath applications of 1 -(3 -Chlorophenyl) biguanide hydrochloride (mCPBG), a 5 -HT 3 R agonist, induced both constrictions (30 %) and dilations (70 %) of penetrating arterioles within supragranular layers. All vasoconstrictions were abolished in the presence of the NPY receptor antagonist (BIBP 3226), suggesting that they were elicited by NPY release. Vasodilations persisted in the presence of the VIP receptor antagonist VPAC 1 (PG- 97 - 269), whereas they were blocked in the presence of the neuronal Nitric Oxide (NO) Synthase (nNOS) inhibitor, L-NNA.

The contribution of NO produced directly in the vasculature by endothelial cells to the hypotension seen in these conditions, vs. the broader systemic increase in NO, is unclear. To determine the specific role of endothelium derived NO in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced vascular dysfunction we administered LPS to mice deficient in endothelial cell tetrahydrobiopterin (BH 4), the essential co-factor for NO production by NOS enzymes. Mice deficient in endothelial BH 4 production, through loss of the essential biosynthesis enzyme Gch 1 (Gch 1 (fl/fl) Tie 2 cre mice) received a 24 hour challenge with LPS or saline control. In vivo LPS treatment increased vascular GTP cyclohydrolase and BH 4 levels in aortas, lungs and hearts, but this increase was significantly attenuated in Gch 1 (fl/fl) Tie 2 cre mice, which were also partially protected from the LPS-induced hypotension. In isometric tension studies, in vivo LPS treatment reduced the vasoconstriction response and impaired endothelium-dependent and independent <b>vasodilatations</b> in mesenteric arteries from wild-type mice, but not in Gch 1 (fl/fl) Tie 2 cre mesenteric arteries. Ex vivo LPS treatment decreased vasoconstriction response to phenylephrine in aortic rings from wild-type and not in Gch 1 (fl/fl) Tie 2 cre mice, even in the context of significant eNOS and iNOS upregulation. These data provide direct evidence that endothelial cell NO has a significant contribution to LPS-induced vascular dysfunction and hypotension and may provide a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of systemic inflammation and patients with septic shock...|$|R
