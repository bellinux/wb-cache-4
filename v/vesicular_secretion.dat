A {{method of}} {{studying}} boar seminal gel has been devised which enables investigation {{to be made}} on the chemical and physical properties of the gel formed in vitro from the bulbo-urethral (Cowper's) gland mucin and either <b>vesicular</b> <b>secretion</b> or seminal plasma.

Adult males of carapace of width 1. 6 – 2. 2 cm were collected from along the estuarine regions of Kanyakumari District, India. Posteriorly, the male reproductive system receives several sac-like structures, referred to as AGs. Histologically, the AG is internally lined by cuboidal epithelium and the lumen encloses eosinophilic <b>vesicular</b> <b>secretions,</b> apparently glycopreoteinaceous in nature.

40|$|Summary. The authors analyse some of {{the results}} of {{examination}} of 607 sterile patients, in which probatory excision from the testicles had been performed. They have reached the following conclusions. Testicular biopsy is a decisive diagnostic method {{in the case of a}} repeated finding of azoospermia. In these cases, the following three conditions must be satisfied before probatory excision is carried out: (1) The spermatic fluid must contain <b>vesicular</b> <b>secretions.</b> (2) The long axis of the testes must be longer than 30 mm. (3) The patient must not have suffered from epididymitis of tuber¬ culous origin. In the cases of obstructive azoospermia, the authors recommend a careful evaluation of the germinal tissue before an eventual vaso-epididymal anastomosis. In cases of repeated findings of oligozoospermia gravis, they do not examine the germinal epithelium as in a majority of ninety-eight patients with this finding the state of germinal tissue was markedly deficient and not suitable for treatment. From the therapeutic point of view, the authors exclude by means of testicular biopsy from long-term and expensive treatment those cases in which the histopathological picture in the testes does not justify any hope of a favourable result of therapy...|$|R

Details {{in the development of}} pigment granules in wild type flies and in three eye color mutants are described. Four different types of pigment granules have been found. Type I granules, which carry ommochrome pigment and occur in both primary and secondary pigment cells of ommatidia, are believed to develop as <b>vesicular</b> <b>secretions</b> by way of the Golgi apparatus. :The formation of Type II granules, which are restricted to the secondary pigment cells and contain drosopterin pigments, involves accumulation of 60 - to 80 -A fibers producing an clliptical granule.

40|$|In {{regulated}} exocytosis {{the merger}} between the vesicle and the plasma membranes {{leads to the}} formation of an aqueous channel (a fusion-pore), through which <b>vesicular</b> <b>secretions</b> exit into the extracellular space. A fusion pore was thought to be a short-lived intermediate preceding full-fusion of the vesicle and the plasma membranes (full-fusion exocytosis). However, transient exocytic events were also observed, where the fusion-pore opens and closes repetitively. Here we asked whether there are different discrete states of the open fusion-pore. Unitary exocytic events were recorded by the high-resolution cell-attached patch-clamp method in pituitary lactotrophs and brain astrocytes. We monitored reversible unitary exocytic events, characterized by an on-step, which is followed by an off-step in membrane capacitance (Cm), a parameter linearly related to the membrane area. The results revealed three categories of reversible exocytic events (transient fusion-pore openings), which do not end with the complete integration of the vesicle membrane into the plasma membrane. These were categorized according to the observed differences in the amplitude and sign of the change in the real (Re) parts of the admittance signals: in case I events (Re≈ 0) fusion pores are relatively wide; in case II (Re > 0) and case III (Re < 0) events fusion pores are relatively narrow. We show that case III events are more likely to occur for small vesicles, whereas, case II events are more likely to occur for larger vesicles. Case III events were considerably more frequent in astrocytes than in lactotrophs...|$|R

40|$|Summary 1. Here {{we review}} recent work on <b>vesicular</b> <b>secretion,</b> {{with a focus}} on the control of post-fusion events as a means of {{regulating}} secretory output. 2. In the classical model of secretion each fused vesicle releases the entirety of its content in an all-or-none manner. In this way the secretory output of a cell is controlled by regulating the numbers of fused vesicles. The realization that post-fusion events can control secretory output leads to a distinct model of partial release of vesicle content. 3. Recent work shows that post-fusion events are under cellular control. Further, new data from our laboratory demonstrates agonist-dependent regulation of fusion pore behaviour. 4. We conclude that post-fusion events are not epiphenomena but are likely an important mechanism of secretory control...|$|E

40|$|The {{plant hormone}} auxin is {{secreted}} in root apices via phospholipase Dζ 2 (PLDζ 2) activity which produces specific population of phosphatidic acid that stimulates secretion of vesicles enriched with auxin.

There are several implications of this <b>vesicular</b> <b>secretion</b> of auxin. In root apices, auxin emerges as plant neurotransmitter-like signal molecule which coordinates activities of adjacent cells via electric and chemical signaling.

As auxin transport across plant synapses is tightly linked with integrated sensory perception of environment, especially of omnipresent gravity and light, this process is proposed to mediate the plant perception of environment.

50|$|The {{cell cycle}} begins with {{interphase}} when the DNA replicates, the cell grows and prepares to enter mitosis. Mitosis includes four phases, prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. Prophase is the initial phase when spindle fibers appear that function {{to move the}} chromosomes toward opposite poles. This spindle apparatus consists of microtubules, microfilaments and a complex network of various proteins. During metaphase, the chromosomes line up using the spindle apparatus {{in the middle of}} the cell along the equatorial plate. The chromosomes move to opposite poles during anaphase and remain attached to the spindle fibers by their centromeres. Animal cell cleavage furrow formation is caused by a ring of actin microfilaments called the contractile ring, which forms during early anaphase. Myosin is present in the region of the contractile ring as concentrated microfilaments and actin filaments are predominant in this region. The actin filaments here are both pre-existing and new. Cleavage is driven by these motor proteins, actin and myosin, which are the same proteins involved with muscle contraction. During cellular cleavage, the contractile ring tightens around the cytoplasm of the cell until the cytoplasm is pinched into two daughter cells. During the final phase of mitosis, telophase, the furrow forms an intercellular bridge using mitotic spindle fibers. Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) has been shown to be present during this time which indicates that is may play a role in movement between the plasma membrane and contractile ring. The bridge is then broken and resealed to form two identical daughter cells during cytokinesis. The breakage is formed by microtubules and the resealing is negated by Calcium dependent exocytosis using Golgi vesicles. In comparison, the plant cell septum and the animal cell mid-zone are analogous. Both require <b>vesicular</b> <b>secretions</b> by the Golgi apparatus for resealing and formation of the cytoskeletal network in addition to microtubules and microfilaments for division and movement. The cleavage furrow mechanism in animal cells is a complex network of actin and myosin filaments, Golgi vesicles and Calcium dependent channels enabling the cell to break apart, reseal and form new daughter cells with complete membranes.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Protein {{secretion}} is {{a universal}} cellular process involving vesicles which bud and fuse between organelles to bring proteins to their final destination. Vesicle budding is mediated by protein coats; vesicle targeting and fusion depend on Rab GTPase, tethering factors and SNARE complexes. The Génolevures II sequencing project made available entire genome sequences of four hemiascomycetous yeasts, Yarrowia lipolytica, Debaryomyces hansenii, Kluyveromyces lactis and Candida glabrata. Y. lipolytica is a dimorphic yeast and has good capacities to secrete proteins. The translocation of nascent protein through the endoplasmic reticulum membrane was well studied in Y. lipolytica and is largely co-translational as in the mammalian protein secretion pathway. Results We identified S. cerevisiae proteins involved in <b>vesicular</b> <b>secretion</b> and these protein sequences {{were used for the}} BLAST searches against Génolevures protein database (Y. lipolytica, C. glabrata, K. lactis and D. hansenii). These proteins are well conserved between these yeasts and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We note several specificities of Y. lipolytica which may be related to its good protein secretion capacities and to its dimorphic aspect. An expansion of the Y. lipolytica Rab protein family was observed with autoBLAST and the Rab 2 - and Rab 4 -related members were identified with BLAST against NCBI protein database. An expansion of this family is also found in filamentous fungi and may reflect the greater complexity of the Y. lipolytica secretion pathway. The Rab 4 p-related protein {{may play a role in}} membrane recycling as rab 4 deleted strain shows a modification of colony morphology, dimorphic transition and permeability. Similarly, we find three copies of the gene (SSO) encoding the plasma membrane SNARE protein. Quantification of the percentages of proteins with the greatest homology between S. cerevisiae, Y. lipolytica and animal homologues involved in vesicular transport shows that 40 % of Y. lipolytica proteins are closer to animal ones, whereas they are only 13 % in the case of S. cerevisiae. Conclusion These results provide further support for the idea, previously noted about the endoplasmic reticulum translocation pathway, that Y. lipolytica is more representative of <b>vesicular</b> <b>secretion</b> of animals and other fungi than is S. cerevisiae. </p...|$|E
40|$|Activation {{of protein}} kinase C (PKC) {{increases}} <b>vesicular</b> <b>secretion</b> in many cell types. We determined the calcium dependence of secretion {{and the size}} of the readily releasable pool of secretory granules in pituitary gonadotropes by photorelease of caged-calcium. The calcium affinity for exocytosis was roughly doubled by activation of PKC by a phorbol ester, whereas the size of the readily releasable pool was not greatly increased. The effect was due to activation of PKC, because it was blocked by a PKC inhibitor and was not mimicked by an inactive phorbol ester analogue. A similar increase in calcium sensitivity was induced by preincubation with gonadotropin-releasing hormone, the physiological releasing hormone. These findings provide direct evidence for physiological regulation of secretion by enhancement of Ca 2 +-sensing steps. Because exocytosis depends on the third- to fourth-power of intracellular free Ca 2 + concentration, this mechanism ensures a powerful up-regulation of hormone release and may explain how PKC can stimulate exocytosis without an increase of Ca 2 + above the resting level...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Vesicular</b> <b>secretion</b> (exocytosis) {{involves}} the release and then compensatory recy-cling of vesicle components through endocytosis. This fundamental cellular process is con-trolled by the coordinated assembly and interactions {{of dozens of}} proteins at the plasma membrane.

Here we develop a high-resolution and high-throughput fluorescence imaging–based approach for the unbiased mapping of 78 proteins at single exocytic vesicles and endocytic structures in neuroendocrine PC 12 cells. This analysis uses two-color single-frame images to provide a systems-level map of the steady-state distributions of proteins at individual exocytic and endocytic structures in the cell. Along with this quantitative map, we find that both calcium-regulated exocytic vesicles (dense core vesicles) and endocytic structures (clathrin-coated structures) and the proteins associated with these structures exhibit a random spatial distribution in unstimulated neuroendocrine PC 12 cells. This approach is broadly applicable for quantitatively mapping the molecular composition and spatial organization of discrete cellular processes with central molecular hubs...|$|E

Since wild cormorants are exposed to these compounds simultaneously, mixture toxicities of them are of concern. To understand the potential toxic effects of these contaminants, we constructed an oligo array and analyzed the gene expression profiles in common cormorant livers.

40|$|AbstractADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs) {{regulate}} coatomer assembly on the Golgi {{as well as}} {{recruitment of}} clathrin adapter proteins and are therefore involved in vesicle budding from the Golgi and vesicular transport.

Arfaptin 1 is an ARF binding protein that inhibits PLD activation, <b>vesicular</b> trafficking and <b>secretion.</b> In the present report, we show that arfaptin 1 interacts with ‘high speed’ membranes independently of ARF. However, addition of myristoylated ARF 3 (myrARF 3) increases the association of arfaptin 1 with the membranes, suggesting that arfaptin 1 and ARF form a complex on the Golgi. Utilizing several deletion mutants of arfaptin 1 it is shown that the association of arfaptin 1 with myrARF 3 is mediated via two binding sites on arfaptin 1.

40|$|Fast neuromodulatory {{effects of}} 17 -β-estradiol (E 2) on cytosolic calcium {{concentration}} ([Ca(2 +) ](i)) {{have been reported}} in many cell types, but little is known about its direct effects on <b>vesicular</b> neurotransmitter <b>secretion</b> (exocytosis). We examined the effects of E 2 on depolarization-evoked [Ca(2 +) ](i) in PC 12 cells using fluorescence measurements. Imaging of [Ca(2 +) ](i) with FURA- 2 revealed that depolarization-evoked calcium entry is inhibited after exposure to 10 nM and 10 μM E 2. Calcium entry after exposure to 50 μM E 2 decreases slightly, but insignificantly. To relate E 2 -induced changes in [Ca(2 +) ](i) to functional effects, we measured exocytosis using amperometry. It was observed that E 2 in some cells elicits exocytosis upon exposure. In addition, E 2 inhibits depolarization-evoked exocytosis with a complex concentration dependence, with inhibition at both physiological and pharmacological concentrations. This rapid inhibition amounts to 45 % at a near physiological level (10 nM E 2), and 50 % at a possible pharmacological concentration of 50 μM. A small percentage (22 %) of cells show exocytosis during E 2 exposure ("Estrogen stimulated"), thus vesicle depletion could possibly account (at least partly) for the E 2 -induced inhibition of depolarization-evoked exocytosis. In cells that do not exhibit E 2 -stimulated release ("Estrogen quiet"), the E 2 -induced inhibition of exocytosis is abolished by a treatment that eliminates the contribution of N-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) to exocytosis. Overall, the data suggest that E 2 can act on N-type VGCCs to affect secretion of neurotransmitters. This provides an additional mechanism for the modulation of neuronal communication and plasticity by steroids...|$|R

40|$|<b>Vesicular</b> <b>secretion</b> is a {{fundamental}} process in the body with vesicle fusion releasing vesicle contents to the outside. This process called exocytosis is usually thought of as leading to an all-or-none release of content; regulation of secretory output dependent on regulating the numbers of fused vesicles. However, it is well established that the fusion pore that forms when the vesicle membrane fuses with the cell membrane is dynamic. More recent evidence indicates the dynamic opening and closing, {{and the size of}} the fusion pore, are limiting factors to the release of vesicle content. What remains unclear is whether these fusion pore behaviors are under cellular control and therefore relevant to cell physiology. Accumulating evidence over the last two years points to myosin 2 as one regulator of fusion pore behavior. This is interesting since myosin 2 activity is in turn controlled by kinases and phosphatases, well known to be under cellular control. We conclude that fusion pore behavior is likely a genuine control point for vesicle content release. This leads to a model for secretion with secretory output controlled not only by the numbers of vesicles fused but also by the regulation of the behavior of individual vesicles...|$|E
40|$|Viruses usually {{induce a}} {{profound}} remodeling of host cells, including the usurpation of host machinery {{to support their}} replication and production of virions to invade new cells. Nonetheless, recognition of viruses by the host often triggers innate immune signaling, preventing viral spread and modulating the function of immune cells. It conventionally occurs through production of antiviral factors and cytokines by infected cells. Virtually all viruses have evolved mechanisms to blunt such responses. Importantly, {{it is becoming increasingly}} recognized that infected cells also transmit signals to regulate innate immunity in uninfected neighboring cells. These alternative pathways are notably mediated by <b>vesicular</b> <b>secretion</b> of various virus- and host-derived products (miRNAs, RNAs, and proteins) and non-infectious viral particles. In this review, we focus on these newly-described modes of cell-to-cell communications and their impact on neighboring cell functions. The reception of these signals can have anti- and pro-viral impacts, as well as more complex effects in the host such as oncogenesis and inflammation. Therefore, these “broadcasting” functions, which might be tuned by an arms race involving selective evolution driven by either the host or the virus, constitute novel and original regulations of viral infection, either highly localized or systemic...|$|E
40|$|The growing {{importance}} of vesicular trafficking and cytoskeleton dynamic reorganization during plant development requires {{the exploitation of}} novel experimental approaches. Several genetic and cell biological studies have used diverse pharmaceutical drugs that inhibit <b>vesicular</b> trafficking and <b>secretion</b> to study these phenomena. Here, proteomic and cell biology approaches were applied to study effects of brefeldin A (BFA), an inhibitor of vesicle recycling and secretion, in Arabidopsis roots. The main {{aim of this study}} was to obtain an overview of proteins affected by BFA, but especially to identify new proteins involved in the vesicular trafficking and its cross-talk to the actin cytoskeleton. The results showed that BFA altered vesicular trafficking and caused the formation of BFA-compartments which was accompanied by differential expression of several proteins in root cells. Some of the BFA-up-regulated proteins belong to the class of the vesicular trafficking proteins, such as V-ATPase and reversibly glycosylated polypeptide, while others, such as profilin 2 and elongation factor 1 alpha, are rather involved in the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. Upregulation of profilin 2 by BFA wa...|$|R
40|$|PtdIns- 4, 5 -bisphosphate is a lipid {{messenger}} of eukaryotic cells playing critical roles in {{processes such as}} cytoskeleton organization, intracellular <b>vesicular</b> trafficking, <b>secretion,</b> cell motility, regulation of ion channels and nuclear signalling pathways. The enzymes responsible for the synthesis of PtdIns(4, 5) P 2 are phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases (PIPKs). The moss Physcomitrella patens contains two PIPKs, PpPIPK 1 and PpPIPK 2. To study their physiological role, both genes were disrupted by targeted homologous recombination {{and as a result}} mutant plants with lower PtdIns(4, 5) P 2 levels were obtained. A strong phenotype for pipk 1, but not for pipk 2 single knockout lines, was obtained. The pipk 1 knockout lines were impaired in rhizoid and caulonemal cell elongation, whereas pipk 1 - 2 double knockout lines showed dramatic defects in protonemal and gametophore morphology manifested by the absence of rapidly elongating caulonemal cells in the protonemal tissue, leafy gametophores with very short rhizoids, and loss of sporophyte production. pipk 1 complemented by overexpression of PpPIPK 1 fully restored the wild type phenotype whereas overexpression of the inactive PpPIPK 1 E 885 A did not. Overexpression of PpPIPK 2 in the pipk 1 - 2 double knockout did not restore the wild type phenotype demonstrating that PpPIPK 1 and PpPIPK 2 are not functionally redundant. In vivo imaging of the cytoskeleton network revealed that the shortened caulonemal cells in the pipk 1 mutants {{was the result of the}} absence of the apicobasal gradient of cortical F-actin cables normally observed in wild type caulonemal cells. Our data indicate that both PpPIPKs play a crucial role in the development of the moss P. patens, and particularly in the regulation of tip growth...|$|R
40|$|The key host {{cellular}} pathway(s) {{necessary to}} control the infection caused by inhalation of the environmental fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans are still largely unknown. Here we have identified that the sphingolipid pathway in neutrophils is required for them to exert their killing activity on the fungus. In particular, using both pharmacological and genetic approaches, we show that inhibition of sphingomyelin synthase (SMS) activity profoundly impairs the killing ability of neutrophils by preventing the extracellular release of an antifungal factor(s). We next found that inhibition of protein kinase D (PKD), which controls <b>vesicular</b> sorting and <b>secretion</b> and is regulated by diacylglycerol (DAG) produced by SMS, totally blocks the extracellular killing activity of neutrophils against C. neoformans. The expression of SMS genes, SMS activity and the levels of the lipids regulated by SMS (namely sphingomyelin (SM) and DAG) are up-regulated during neutrophil differentiation. Finally, tissue imaging of lungs infected with C. neoformans using matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS), revealed that specific SM species are associated with neutrophil infiltration {{at the site of}} the infection. This study establishes a key role for SMS in the regulation of the killing activity of neutrophils against C. neoformans through a DAG-PKD dependent mechanism, and provides, for the first time, new insights into the protectiv...|$|R
