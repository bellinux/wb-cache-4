5000|$|Video door-phone [...] (also {{known as}} video door entry or <b>video</b> <b>intercom)</b> is a {{stand-alone}} intercom system used to manage calls {{made at the}} entrance to a building (residential complex, detached family home, workplace, etc.) with access controlled by audiovisual communication between the inside and outside. The main feature of video door entry is that it enables the person indoors to identify the visitor and, if (and only if) they wish, engage in conversation and/or open the door to allow access to the person calling.|$|E
40|$|In the {{this highly}} {{competitive}} market, a company's capacity to generate and market creative and original ideas {{is a key}} for success. But most companies have limited resources and so, knowledge creation can not be generated solely from within the firm. In order to expand their knowledge base, organizations begun to implicate stakeholders in all phases of the new product development process, from idea generation, selection, development and eventually, even to marketing the new products or services. In this context, the Internet and the new technologies represent a valuable instrument for companies, {{due to the fact}} that they can enhance the firms’ ability to actively engage all their stakeholders in collaborative innovation. Our paper presents and evaluates the development and implementation of an online co-creation platform – E-PICUS addressed to multiple stakeholders of a new electronic product - <b>Video</b> <b>Intercom</b> providing insights into the specific capabilities a firm needs in order to manage co-creation and into partial results obtained through costumers’ involvement in the innovation process...|$|E
50|$|The {{company is}} part of the International Group Legrand and {{operates}} both on the Italian market and on the Worldwide one with over 60 offices abroad.The main products in the field of electrical equipment are traditional and domotics switches, plates, residual current devices, <b>intercoms</b> and <b>video</b> <b>intercoms.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{main office}} is in Varese, {{where there are}} 1500 employees, split between design, production, quality, test, marketing, {{administrative}} and commercial offices. In Milan there is the administrative headquarters. Other important locations are Erba, where all the domotics products and <b>video</b> <b>intercoms</b> are developed and produced; Ospedaletto Lodigiano where is located the central warehouse; Bodio, where the plaques are made; Azzano San Paolo and Torre del Greco, where are developed and manufactured devices industrial and residual current device.|$|R

50|$|The cameras, which weighed {{hundreds}} of pounds on their own, were only {{one component of}} the TK-40/41 system. There were also backend devices placed in the control rooms (camera control units and colorplexers) to generate both full NTSC outputs routed to the program switchers as well as signals for the cameras for both <b>video</b> and <b>intercom</b> communication among crew members (the cameras integrated an audio system so that camera operators could talk to others via headsets). This combined chain was {{required in order to}} produce images. The TK-41's camera head weighed 300 lb and had to be carried by at least two people when setting up for remote broadcasts.|$|R
50|$|The E/V Nautilus {{satellite}} system uses a very-small aperture terminal (VSAT) to enable two-way Internet connectivity between ship and shore. The maximum uplink capability {{is up to}} 46 Mbit/s, depending on the ship’s location and the satellite being used. The signal is sent from Nautilus to a geosynchronous satellite, and then down to a ground station in Andover, Maine. The ground station passes the signals to the Inner Space Center (ISC) at the University of Rhode Island Graduate School of Oceanography. From the ISC, the multicast video streams are distributed to the Internet and used in highlight reels and webcasts. During expeditions, Nautilus can send broadcast-quality <b>video</b> streams, associated <b>intercom</b> traffic and data back to shore in real time.|$|R
50|$|At first {{all these}} cameras used tube based sensors, but Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) imagers {{came on the}} scene in the mid-80s, {{bringing}} numerous benefits. Early CCD cameras could not match the colour or resolution of their tube counterparts, but the benefits of CCD technology, such as introducing smaller and lightweight cameras, a better and more stable image (that was not prone to image burn in or lag) and no need for calibration meant development on CCD imagers quickly took off and, once rivaling and offering a superior image to a tube sensor, began displacing tube-based cameras - the latter of which were all but disused by the early 1990s. Eventually, cameras with the recorder permanently mated to the camera head became the norm for ENG. In studio cameras, the camera electronics shrank, and CCD imagers replaced the pickup tubes. The thick multi-core cables connecting the camera head to the CCU were replaced in the late seventies with triax connections, a slender video cable that carried multiple <b>video</b> signals, <b>intercom</b> audio, and control circuits, and could be run for a mile or more. As the camera innards shrunk, the electronics no longer dictated the size of the enclosure, however the box shape remained, as it is necessary to hold the large studio lenses, teleprompters, electronic viewfinder (EVF), and other paraphernalia needed for studio and sports production. Electronic Field Production cameras were often mounted in studio configurations inside a mounting cage. This cage supported the additional studio accessories.|$|R
5000|$|Living {{near the}} poverty line and rubbing {{shoulders}} with the area’s vast homeless community stirred political activist feelings in Sherman, and his songwriting turned activist. He created a fictional alter ego named Jeff Joad (after the family in Steinbeck’s The Grapes of Wrath). [...] Taking Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger as models, Sherman began playing his folk protest songs at soup kitchens and homeless encampments, just himself and an acoustic guitar. Appalled at the disparity {{between rich and poor}} in Ronald Reagan’s America and the intentional dismantling of social safety nets, he started working with the Frontline Foundation and Xela-Aid distributing food and other necessities to those in need. [...] In 1990 he released Time for a Change as Jeff Joad on his own Relentless Pursuit Records, with profits donated to charity. He traveled to Guatemala in 1991 and 1992 as part of Xela-Aid's in-country effort, providing music for the crowds waiting in line to see the volunteer doctors and nurses. In 1999 he released a second Jeff Joad album entitled Judgment of the Flame with several of his ex-bandmates. A video from this album, entitled Shine On, won a 1995 music <b>video</b> award from <b>INTERCOM,</b> the INTERnational COMmunications program of the Chicago International Film Festival.|$|R
