50|$|To {{produce the}} material, the {{silicone}} rubber {{is mixed with}} the curing agent or <b>vulcanizing</b> <b>agent.</b> Usually the mixing ratio is a few percent. In order for the RTV silicone to reproduce the surface texture, {{attention is paid to}} the cleanliness of the original. Vacuum de-airing removes entrained air bubbles from the mixed silicone and catalyst to ensure optimal tensile strength, which affects reproduction times. In casting and mold-making, RTV silicone rubber reproduces fine details and is suitable for a variety of industrial and art-related applications including prototypes, furniture, sculpture, and architectural elements. RTV silicone rubber can be used to cast materials including wax, gypsum, low melt alloys/metals and urethane, epoxy or polyester resins (without using a release agent). A more recent innovation is the ability to 3D Print RTV silicones. RTV silicones' industrial applications include aviation, aerospace, consumer electronics, and microelectronics. Some aviation and aerospace product applications are cockpit instruments, engine electronics potting, and engine gasketing. RTV silicones are used for their ability to withstand mechanical and thermal stress.|$|E

Even with natural rubber, large amounts of sulfur, as well as high temperatures and long heating periods are necessary and one obtains to an unsatisfactory crosslinking efficiency with unsatisfactory strength and aging properties.

The combined cure package in a typical rubber compound consists of sulfur together with an assortment of compounds that modify the kinetics of crosslinking and stabilize the final product. These additives include accelerators, activators like zinc oxide and stearic acid and antidegradants. The accelerators and activators are catalysts. An additional level of control is achieved by retarding agents that inhibit vulcanization until some optimal time or temperature.

The dimethylol phenolic resin was prepared in our laboratory. The blends were compounded in mixer- 60 attached to a Haake rheochord meter- 90. The rheological properties were measured at temperatures 140, 160, 180 and 200 Â°C. The linearity of the flow curve appeared for 5 % of the <b>vulcanizing</b> <b>agent.</b> The shear stress and shear viscosity have increased upon increasing the shear rate over a range of loading levels of <b>vulcanizing</b> <b>agent</b> of 1 %, 3 %, 5 %, 7 % and 10 %.

40|$|EPDM rubber {{is widely}} used in a diverse type of applications, such as the automotive, {{industrial}} and construction sectors among others. Due to its appealing features, the consumption of vulcanized EPDM rubber is growing significantly. However, environmental issues are forcing the application of devulcanization processes to facilitate the recovery, which has led rubber manufacturers to implement strict quality controls. Consequently, {{it is important to}} develop methods for supervising the vulcanizing and recovering processes of such products. This paper deals with the supervision process of EPDM compounds by means of Fourier transform mid-infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and suitable multivariate statistical methods. A nondestructive and expeditive classification approach was applied to a sufficient number of EPDM samples with different applied processes, that is, with and without application of <b>vulcanizing</b> <b>agents,</b> <b>vulcanized</b> samples and microwave treated samples.

Finally, the k-NN (k nearest neighbor) algorithm was used in the classification stage.

40|$|The {{morphology}} {{and mechanical}} and viscoelastic properties {{of a series}} of blends of natural rubber (NR) and styrene butadiene rubber (SBR) latex blends were studied in the uncrosslinked and crosslinked state. The morphology of the NR/SBR blends was analyzed using a scanning electron microscope. The morphology of the blends indicated a two phase structure in which SBR is dispersed as domains in the continuous NR matrix when its content is less than 50 %. A cocontinuous morphology was obtained at a 50 / 50 NR/SBR ratio and phase inversion was seen beyond 50 % SBR when NR formed the dispersed phase. The mechanical properties of the blends were studied with special reference to the effect of the blend ratio, surface active <b>agents,</b> <b>vulcanizing</b> system, and time for prevulcanization. As the NR content and time of prevulcanization increased, the mechanical properties such as the tensile strength, modulus, elongation at break, and hardness increased. This was due to the increased degree of crosslinking that leads to the strengthening of the 3 -dimensional network. In most cases the tear strength values increased as the prevulcanization time increased. The mechanical data were compared with theoretical predictions. The effects of the blend ratio and prevulcanization on the dynamic mechanical properties of the blends were investigated at different temperatures and frequencies. All the blends showed two distinct glass-transition temperatures, indicating that the system is immiscible. It was also found that the glass-transition temperatures of vulcanized blends are higher than those of unvulcanized blends. The time-temperature superposition and Cole-Cole analysis were made to understand the phase behavior of the blends.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A novel UFNBRP/EPDM blend was pre-pared by {{compounding}} ultra-fine full-vulcanized acryloni-trile {{butadiene rubber}} particles (UFNBRP) with ethyleneâ propyleneâdiene monomer (EPDM) matrix. The morphol-ogy, dynamic property, and curing {{property of the}} blend were discussed in detail. TEM and SEM observations showed that, no matter how high the blend ratio of UFNBRP to EPDM matrix was, UFNBRP particles always kept being in the dispersion phase because of its extremely high viscos-ity resulting from self-crosslinking, but were not dispersed as nanosize units, as expected. Dynamic properties, illus-trated by DMTA, further demonstrated that two phases exhibited two separate glass transition temperatures, indi-cating distinct phase separation and weak phase interaction. Rubber processing analyzer results showed that inorganic filler as well as UFNBRP particles in EPDM matrix formed a network and blocked the flow properties of the compound. At the same time, the introduction of UFNBRP particles evidently affected the vulcanization of EPDM, when sulfur {{was used as a}} <b>vulcanizing</b> <b>agent,</b> and improved the mechan-ical properties of EPDM.

40|$|The {{effects of}} Carbon Black fillers loading on the Tensile Strength of Natural rubber (SMR) {{compound}} were investigated in this study. In this study, 5 KN forces {{were used to}} determine Tensile Strength for each ingredient of Rubber compounds are reinforced with filler such carbon black. In general, Natural Rubber (SMR) prepare in range 10 phr, 30 phr and 50 phr of Carbon Black N 220 filler loading. The Natural Rubber (SMR) composition also filled with additives such as stearic acid,CBS, zinc white and antioxidant like Aromatic oil meanwhile vulcanization accelerator, and <b>vulcanizing</b> <b>agent</b> like sulphur after 3 hour cool down under room temperature. After 24 hour cooled under room temperature, molding process should be run. After molding, the sample should be cooled under room temperature around 2 days before tensile process. In generally, the amount of the filler added is around 50 parts by weight per 165 parts by weight of the rubber component based on standard ingredient. When the amount of the filler is less by weight, the reinforcing property is insufficient and the wear resistance is poor, while when it exceeds 200 parts by weight, the tensile Strength really strong and the sample become waste because too hard for processing...|$|E
