40|$|The {{evolution}} of the anisotropic void microstructure of plasma-sprayed yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) deposits has been observed {{as a function of}} temperature by small-angle neutron scattering. Scattering experiments were carried out in-situ, in a furnace between 600 and 1400 °C. The terminal slope (Porod scattering) of the scattering spectra was used to derive the specific surface area of the voids. For samples with sufficient scattering anisotropy, the two major <b>void</b> <b>systems</b> - intersplat (inter-lamellar) pores and intrasplat cracks - could be characterized separately. The pore and crack specific surface areas were found to depend on temperature differently. The specific surface area of the intrasplat cracks decreased markedly at temperatures below 1000 °C, whereas the specific surface area of the intersplat pores began to decrease above 1000 °C. This indicates important differences in the sintering of these two <b>void</b> <b>systems</b> probably related to their size and shape. Changes in the void surface were observed at temperatures as low as 800 °C, a temperature comparable to, or less than, the usual operational temperature for this material...|$|E

The alumina and yttria-stabilized zirconia deposits studied were produced by two different atmospheric plasma-spraying methods - using gas-stabilized and water-stabilized plasma systems.

The surface area of the anisotropic voids was determined using SANS. By varying the spray technique and material, deposits with different dominant <b>void</b> <b>systems</b> were produced. The alumina deposits, manufactured by a high-power water-stabilized plasma-spray system, consisted of a microstructure dominated by intralamellar cracks; the same material deposited by a standard lower-power gas-stabilized plasma-spray system has about equal surface area in the intralamellar cracks and interlamellar voids. However, the zirconia deposit microstructure is always dominated by inerlamellar voids...|$|E

Highly integrated, underground drainage systems in some very young lava flows in Iceland exemplify the potentially complex, fissured and conduit aquifers which may exist. Similarities between such aquifers and easily polluted, karstic conduit aquifers suggest greater research and more careful and protective management of some volcanic aquifers are warranted.

40|$|Major highway {{concrete}} pavements in Iowa have exhibited premature deterioration attributed to effects of ettringite formation, alkali-silica expansive reactions, and to frost attack, {{or some combination}} of them. These pavements were constructed in the mid- 1980 s as non-reinforced, dual-lane, roads ranging in thickness between 200 mm and 300 mm, with skewed joints reinforced with dowels. Deterioration was initially recognized with a darkening of joint regions, which occurred for some pavements as soon as four years after construction. Pavement condition ranges from severe damage to none, and there appeared to be no unequivocal materials or processing variables correlated with failure. Based upon visual examinations, petrographic evaluation, and application of materials models, the deterioration of concrete highway pavements in Iowa appear related to a freeze-thaw failure of the coarse aggregate and the mortar. Crack patterns sub-parallel to the concrete surface transecting the mortar fraction and the coarse aggregate are indicative of freeze-thaw damage of both the mortar and aggregate. The entrained air <b>void</b> <b>system</b> was marginal to substandard, and filling of some of the finer-sized voids by ettringite appears to have further degraded the air <b>void</b> <b>system.</b> The formation of secondary ettringite within the entrained air voids probably reflects a relatively high degree of concrete saturation causing the smaller voids to be filled with pore solution when the concrete freezes. Alkali-silica reaction (ASR) affects some quartz and shale in the fine aggregate, but is not considered to be a significant cause of the deterioration. Delayed ettringite formation was not deemed likely as no evidence of a uniform paste expansion was observed. The lack of field-observed expansion is also evidence against the ASR and DEF modes of deterioration. The utilization of fly ash {{does not appear to have}} affected the deterioration as all pavements with or without fly ash exhibiting substantial damage also exhibit significant filling of the entrained air <b>void</b> <b>system,</b> and specimens containing fly ash from sound pavements do not have significant filling. The influence of the mixture design, mixing, and placing must be evaluated with respect to development of an adequate entrained air <b>void</b> <b>system,</b> concrete homogeneity, longterm drying shrinkage, and microcracking. A high-sand mix may have contributed to the difficult mixture characteristics noted upon placement and exacerbate concrete heterogeneity problems, difficulty in developing an adequate entrained air <b>void</b> <b>system,</b> poor consolidation potential, and increased drying shrinkage and cracking. Finally, the availability of moisture must also be considered, as the secondary precipitation of ettringite in entrained air voids indicates they were at least partially filled with pore solution at times. Water availability at the base of the slabs, in joints, and cracks may have provided a means for absorbing water to a point of critical saturation...|$|R

Durability assurance requires consistent provision {{of an air}} <b>void</b> <b>system</b> comprised of small, well-distributed bubbles in sufficient quantity for durability and a quality control method for testing tie freeze-thaw durability. Manufacturing processes at three concrete manufacturing plants were investigated {{in order to determine}} the effects of process variability on resulting concrete air <b>void</b> <b>system</b> variability. Variation in the concrete air <b>void</b> <b>system</b> and other rheological properties occurred as results of the manufacturing process and vibration. Freezing and thawing durability testing of prestressed concrete ties is currently performed by applying ASTM C 666 on 3 x 4 x 11 to 16 in. specimens cut from the shoulders of concrete ties. However, excising these specimens from prestressed concrete could lead to stress changes in the sample and cracking, potentially causing false interpretations of results. Therefore, testing was undertaken to understand the effects of prestressing and sample extraction on freeze-thaw durability measured by ASTM C 666. In order to assess the effects of sampling and testing procedures on freeze-thaw quality control testing results of prestressed concrete railroad ties, full ties, half ties, and 3 x 4 x 11 in. excised samples were tested. Freeze-thaw testing included determination of the optimal method to measure freeze-thaw deterioration in large sections, the effects of saw-cutting, and the presence of reinforcement. Results indicated that the Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity accurately represented deterioration in large sections. The presence of reinforcement in excised samples led to faster deterioration compared to cast ASTM C 666 samples, while saw-cutting without reinforcement did not significantly affect freeze-thaw durability...|$|R

40|$|The {{understanding}} of failure mechanisms in plasma sprayed 7 wt% yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) {{is a key}} step toward optimizing thermal barrier coating (TBC) usage, design, and life prediction. The {{purpose of the present}} work is to characterize and understand the stress relaxation behavior occurring in plasma-sprayed YSZ coatings, so that the correlating magnitude of unfavorable tensile stress, which coatings experienced upon cooling, may be reduced through microstructural design. ^ The microstructure and properties of as-sprayed coatings changes immensely during service at high temperature, and therefore the effects of long heat-treatment times, and the concomitant change within the microstructure, on the time-dependent mechanical behavior of stand-alone YSZ coatings was studied in parallel with the as-sprayed coating condition. Aside from influencing the mechanical properties, stress relaxation also affects the insulating efficiency of plasma-sprayed 7 wt% YSZ coatings. ^ Directionally dependent changes in microstructure due to stress relaxation of a uniaxially applied stress at 1200 °C were observed in plasma-sprayed coatings. Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) investigation of coatings after stress relaxation displayed a 46 % reduction in the specific surface area connected to the load-orientation dependent closure of void surface area perpendicular to the applied load when compared to coatings sintered in air, i. e. no applied load. These anisotropic microstructural changes were linked to the thermal properties of the coating. For example, a coating stress relaxed from 60 MPa for 5 -min at 1200 °C exhibited a thermal conductivity of 2. 1 W/m-K. A coating that was only heat-treated for 5 -min at 1200 °C (i. e. no stress applied) exhibited a thermal conductivity of 1. 7 W/m·K. ^ In the current study, uniaxial stress relaxation in plasma-sprayed 7 wt% YSZ coatings was determined the result of: (1) A more uniform distribution of the applied load with time, (2) A reduction in the SSA associated with <b>void</b> <b>systems</b> due to sintering, specifically the closing and healing of intralamellar cracks perpendicular to the applied stress, and (3) A compaction and closure of <b>void</b> <b>systems</b> under the applied load.

A full characterization of their air <b>void</b> <b>systems</b> {{from the moment of}} casting until the freeze/thaw test was also done. Due to the presence of the highly AEA adsorptive fly ash an increased AEA dosage (7. 0 ml/kg binder) was needed to achieve an adequate air void system in terms of air content and spacing factor to keep salt scaling within acceptable limits. For the novel non-air entrained concrete type with SAPs, which are able to absorb up to 500 times their weight in fluids, the salt scaling resistance is surprisingly high. The microstructural analysis revealed the formation of macro-pores due to these SAPs, creating an air void system as can be found in air-entrained concrete. Another advantage is that the strength of concrete with SAPs is much higher than for a conventional air-entrained concrete. This substantiates the further use of these SAPs as admixture in precast concrete road elements...|$|E

However, interlayer noise complaints, such as footsteps or dragging items in apartment housing, are an inevitable problem in apartment dwelling conditions, because each household in an apartment shares walls and ceilings with other households. This paper presents the results acquired from the field test of the floor impact sound insulation performance of a <b>voided</b> slab <b>system</b> as applied to a commercial residential-complex building in South Korea. The results have shown that adopting the <b>voided</b> slab <b>system</b> for a commercial residential-complex building increased floor impact sound insulation performance. The test results show that the sound insulation performance of the <b>voided</b> slab <b>system</b> applied in the building for lightweight and heavyweight floor impact sound reached (47 and 41) dB, respectively. Based on the results of the field tests, it is expected that the application of the <b>voided</b> slab <b>systems</b> to the slabs of the apartment dwellings would be effective, and offer outstanding sound insulation performance. Moreover, it is expected that the floor impact sound insulation performance would be further improved, if the floor finishing materials, such as carpet or other types of flooring material, would first be installed onto the floor.|$|R

40|$|Concrete {{pavements}} are {{an important}} part of our national infrastructure. In recent years the relatively small number of reported joints deteriorating prematurely in concrete pavements around Indiana has increased. Changes over the past 45 years in INDOT specification, pavement materials, designs and construction practices, and current de-icing materials were examined and related to the durability of concrete at the joints of existing pavements. A survey of concrete pavements across the state revealed that no pavements from the two southern districts less than 40 years old showed this distress except in more recently placed patches. Cores were retrieved from the joints and mid-panel of 11 pavement sections that represented different materials, ages, construction, deicer exposure, and different levels of deterioration, from non-deteriorated concrete to concrete with severe deterioration at the joints. The pavement base drained well at the mid-panel of most pavements but was reduced at the joints for over half the pavements with the most severe joint deterioration associated with the slowest drainage. None of the concrete had an air <b>void</b> <b>system</b> that met all the criteria recommended for FT durable concrete but was better at the mid-panel than at the joints. Infilling and lining of the entrained air voids with ettringite and some Friedel’s salt was more common near the joints and could account for the reduced air <b>void</b> <b>system.</b> The FT testing did not correlate directly with the air void parameters but generally mid-panel samples did test as more durable than joints. Evidence from the presence of unhydrated cement grains suggested that the concrete at the joint face was not fully cured. One pavement section that did not have fly ash had worse deterioration than the panels nearby that had fly ash and calcium hydrate was more noticeable in the concrete from joints with severe deterioration. Several variables were identified that influence the durability of the concrete at the joints and there may be other variables that were beyond the scope or capacity of this study. In summary this study identified the following variables likely influenced the durability of the concrete at the joints: the drainability of the base at the joints, original air <b>void</b> <b>system,</b> reduced air <b>void</b> parameters due to lining and infilling of the air voids with secondary minerals, poor hydration of the concrete at the joint face and increased moisture at the joint...|$|R
