40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedWhen a community is plagued by violence, the natural {{tendency is to}} determine how to change or reduce the violence levels. In the process, an equally important question of why violence occurs is often overlooked. This thesis analyzes the why with respect to violence levels in Salinas, California. In order to determine specific environmental factors that affect violence in Salinas, the authors postulate nine broad independent variables (IVs) for analysis: Economy; Population; Housing; Education; Police Force; Prison Influence; Gang Rivalry; Social Service Programs; and Community Involvement. Components of these independent variables were compared to the violence rate per capita in Salinas to determine which environmental factors influence violence in Salinas. Although data was not available for all of the IVs, the authors determined that the following factors influence violence in Salinas: the unemployment rate, average persons per household, <b>vacant</b> <b>housing</b> <b>units,</b> <b>housing</b> <b>units</b> per capita, the high school dropout rate, the high school graduation rate, the school average daily attendance, and the school budget. To lower overall violence levels, officials in Salinas should focus on: reducing the unemployment rate, the number of <b>vacant</b> <b>housing</b> <b>units,</b> and the high school dropout rate; and increasing the high school graduation rate and average daily attendance.

40|$|This study {{examines}} geographic patterns and geographic factors of residential burglary at the Nashville, TN {{area for a}} twenty year period at five year interval starting in 1988. The {{purpose of this study}} is to identify what geographic factors have impacted on residential burglary rates, and if there were changes in the geographic patterns of residential burglary over the study period. Several criminological theories guide this study, with the most prominent being Social Disorganization Theory and Routine Activities Theory. Both of these theories focus on the relationships of place and crime. A number of spatial analysis methods are hence adopted to analyze residential burglary rates at block group level for each of the study year. Spatial autocorrelation approaches, particularly Global and Local Moran 2 ̆ 7 s I statistics, are utilized to detect the hotspots of residential burglary. To understand the underlying geographic factors of residential burglary, both OLS and GWR regression analyses are conducted to examine the relationships between residential burglary rates and various geographic factors, such as Percentages of Minorities, Singles, <b>Vacant</b> <b>Housing</b> <b>Units,</b> Renter Occupied <b>Housing</b> <b>Units,</b> and Persons below Poverty Line. The findings indicate that residential burglaries exhibit clustered patterns by forming various hotspots around the study area, especially in the central city and over time these hotspots tended to move in a northeasterly direction during the study period of 1988 - 2008. Overall, four of the five geographic factors under examination show positive correlations with the rate of residential burglary at block group level. Percentages of <b>Vacant</b> <b>Housing</b> <b>Units</b> and Persons below Poverty Line (both are indicators of neighbor economic well-being) are the strong indicators of crime, while Percentages of Minorities (ethnic heterogeneity indictor) and Renter Occupied <b>Housing</b> <b>Units</b> (residential turnover indictor) only show modest correlation in a less degree.

40|$|In {{numerous}} East German cities extreme imbalances in {{the housing}} market have developed with the consequence of extensive housing vacancies. Primarily inner city <b>housing</b> <b>units</b> constructed in the late 19 th and early 20 th century and <b>housing</b> <b>units</b> constructed within the period of the socialist regime are concerned. The causes for these imbalances can be found in decisions of socialist urban planning, in demographic factors, in oversized federal promotion of new housing construction after the German unification, and in income increases of private households. The commission “Structural Change in the Housing Economy of the New Länder“, installed by the federal government, has examined this problem and submitted preliminary political recommendations on the federal level {{in order to reduce the}} housing market imbalances. The commission recommends federal subsidies for tearing off <b>vacant</b> <b>housing</b> <b>units</b> within a period of ten years. A measure like this raises the question how the risk can be handled that too many flats are torn down. In addition, the commission recommends to double the subsidies for households acquiring already existing flats for own use and to halve the subsidies for households investing in newly built owner-occupied housing in East Germany. These incentives to acquire existing <b>housing</b> <b>units</b> might prove too weak because of the strong preferences of East German households to live in single-family houses.

40|$|Rats are {{ubiquitous}} in urban environments and, as established reservoirs for infectious pathogens, present a control priority {{for public health}} agencies. New York City (NYC) harbors {{one of the largest}} rat populations in the United States, but surprising little study has been undertaken to define rat ecology across varied features of this urban landscape. More importantly, factors that may contribute to increased encounters between rats and humans have rarely been explored. Using city-wide records of rat sightings reported to the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, this investigation sought to identify sociodemographic, housing, and physical landscape characteristics that are associated with increased rat sightings across NYC census tracts. A hierarchical Bayesian conditional autoregressive Poisson model was used to assess these associations while accounting for spatial heterogeneity in the variance. Closer proximity to both subway lines and recreational public spaces was associated with a higher concentration of rat sightings, as was a greater presence of older <b>housing,</b> <b>vacant</b> <b>housing</b> <b>units,</b> and low education among the population. Moreover, these aspects of the physical and social landscape accurately predicted rat sightings across the city.

40|$|In the 1970 s, {{cities across}} the country began {{implementing}} urban homesteading programs, in which they transferred surplus <b>vacant</b> <b>housing</b> <b>units</b> to hopeful homeowners for the low cost of $ 1 and a two-year commitment to rehabilitating and occupying the unit as a primary residence. The goals of these programs were varied, but typically included neighborhood stabilization, affordable housing, and incentivizing the return of wealthier households back to urban neighborhoods. This thesis argues that, while homesteading programs achieved mixed results in regards to these goals, they did achieve historic preservation outcomes. In order to support this proposition, this thesis examines the history of homesteading in Baltimore City, Maryland. Although Baltimore was not the first city to launch a program, it was the most influential and its program had long-lasting impact. Baltimore pursued two different approaches: scattered-site and neighborhood-wide homesteading. Based on archival research, interviews, and site visits, this thesis finds that the former often created home ownership opportunities for more moderate-income households, and that the latter achieved significant preservation outcomes. This thesis also argues that, given the ongoing loss of population in many Rust Belt cities; the nationwide abundance of housing abandoned following the foreclosure crisis; and the simultaneous shortage of affordable housing opportunities, the time is ripe for homesteading programs to be re-examined. Preservationists should recognize homesteading as a powerful tool for vernacular preservation, and join planners and affordable housing advocates in promoting the potential for homesteading to address many urban challenges at once...|$|R
40|$|Depression is a {{major public}} health {{challenge}} affecting millions of people worldwide, particularly women. Intra-individual explanations of gender differences in depression include biology (e. g., neurotransmitters, genes, hormones) and psychological factors (e. g., self-concept and esteem, mastery). Social explanations focusing on exposure to stressors (e. g., low socioeconomic status) and social role occupancy (e. g., marital and employment status) also have been considered. The recognition that environmental factors may influence mental health {{has given rise to}} studies examining the relationship between neighborhood conditions and risk for depression and psychological distress, but gender differences in neighborhood effects have yet to receive the needed research attention. This dissertation sought an understanding of: (a) gender differences in neighborhood effects on depressive symptoms, and (b) neighborhood influences on variation in depressive symptoms among women. The research is guided by the neighborhood stress process framework focusing on stressors and psychosocial resources as mediators and moderators of the relationships among neighborhood conditions and depressive symptoms. Individual-level cross-sectional data come from the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS: baseline, 2006 / 2008 interviews and psychosocial questionnaire supplement). The HRS is a U. S. national probability sample of adults over the age of 50. Analyses are performed within a multilevel framework and urban neighborhood data come from the 2000 U. S. Census. Among eight indicators of neighborhood disadvantage, including neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage (NSD), and five measures of neighborhood advantage examined for gender differences in their effects on depressive symptoms, two were statistically significant but not in the expected direction. Neighborhood proportion non-family households was associated with fewer depressive symptoms among women and it had no effect among men. Neighborhood proportion married-couple households was not significantly related to depressive symptoms among women, but among men, living in a neighborhood with more married-couple households with children was associated with fewer symptoms. Overall, the impact on depressive symptoms of neighborhood characteristics do not differ for men and women. Gender differences in neighborhood effects on three individual-level stressors and three individual-level psychosocial resources also were examined. Nine interactions were statistically significant. Consistent with expectations, people who reside in neighborhoods with more <b>vacant</b> <b>housing</b> <b>units</b> perceived more disorder and less social cohesion in their neighborhoods, and the effects were larger for women than men. Relative to men, women's perceptions of neighborhood social cohesion and social support are more sensitive to neighborhood economic conditions. In general, with a few notable exceptions, neighborhood effects on stressors and psychosocial resources do not vary by gender. In analyses that only included women, NSD was positive and significantly associated with depressive symptoms and neighborhood proportion adults aged 65 and older was negative and significantly associated with symptoms. Perceived neighborhood social cohesion fully mediated the effect of NSD- and partially mediated the effect of neighborhood proportion older adults- on depressive symptoms. The effect on depressive symptoms of neighborhood disadvantage did not vary significantly by levels of stressors and psychosocial resources except for three significant cross-level interactions. Living in a neighborhood with more <b>vacant</b> <b>housing</b> <b>units</b> was associated with more depressive symptoms, and the effect was greater among women who perceived high levels of disorder in the neighborhood than those who perceived less disorder. Also as hypothesized, NSD had the largest positive effect on depressive symptoms among women with less social support than women with more support. However, mastery did not function as a stress-buffer. The effect on depressive symptoms of neighborhood advantage varied significantly by psychosocial factors. Living in a neighborhood with higher proportions of older adults was associated with fewer depressive symptoms more so for women who report low levels of perceived neighborhood physical disorder than women who report average levels of disorder. Also consistent with expectations, higher neighborhood proportion of affluent households and owner-occupied <b>housing</b> <b>units</b> were associated with fewer depressive symptoms, and the effects were larger for women with high levels of mastery than women with low mastery. However, these neighborhood characteristics were less beneficial to the mental health of women with high than low levels of social support. The findings from this dissertation largely indicate that relationships among components of the neighborhood stress process model do not differ by gender or by levels of stressors and psychosocial resources. However, the significant results that emerged make a valuable contribution to the research literature by identifying urban neighborhood conditions that are consequential to the mental health of middle-aged and older adults and that should be the target of interventions...|$|R
