40|$|Gaucher disease, {{the most}} common {{lysosomal}} storage disease, can be treated with enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), in which defective acid-β-glucosidase (GlcCerase) is supplemented by a recombinant, active enzyme. The X-ray structures of recombinant GlcCerase produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells (imiglucerase, Cerezyme®) and in transgenic carrot cells (prGCD) have been previously solved. We now describe the structure and characteristics of a novel form of GlcCerase under investigation {{for the treatment of}} Gaucher disease, Gene-ActivatedTM human GlcCerase (<b>velaglucerase</b> <b>alfa).</b> In contrast to imiglucerase and prGCD, <b>velaglucerase</b> <b>alfa</b> contains the native human enzyme sequence. All three GlcCerases consist of three domains, with the active site located in domain III. The distances between the carboxylic oxygens of the catalytic residues, E 340 and E 235, are consistent with distances proposed for acid–base hydrolysis. Kinetic parameters (Km and Vmax) of <b>velaglucerase</b> <b>alfa</b> and imiglucerase, as well as their specific activities, are similar. However, analysis of glycosylation patterns shows that <b>velaglucerase</b> <b>alfa</b> displays distinctly different structures from imiglucerase and prGCD. The predominant glycan on <b>velaglucerase</b> <b>alfa</b> is a high-mannose type, with nine mannose units, while imiglucerase contains a chitobiose tri-mannosyl core glycan with fucosylation. These differences in glycosylation affect cellular internalization; the rate of <b>velaglucerase</b> <b>alfa</b> internalization into human macrophages is at least 2 -fold greater than that of imiglucerase...|$|E

We report {{the assessment of}} <b>velaglucerase</b> <b>alfa</b> ERT in pediatric GD 1 patients who participated in a long-term extension study (HGT-GCB- 044, ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier NCT 00635427). Methods Safety and efficacy were evaluated in pediatric patients receiving <b>velaglucerase</b> <b>alfa</b> 30 – 60 U/kg by intravenous infusion every other week. In addition to key hematological and visceral efficacy assessments, exploratory assessments conducted specifically in pediatric patients included evaluation of height, bone age, bone marrow burden, and Tanner stage of puberty. Results The study included 24 pediatric patients. Fifteen patients were naïve to ERT on entry into the preceding trials TKT 032 (12 -month trial) or HGT-GCB- 039 (9 -month trial) : in the preceding trials, ten of these 15 patients received <b>velaglucerase</b> <b>alfa</b> and five patients received imiglucerase ERT. Nine patients {{in the study were}} previously treated with imiglucerase for 3 ̆e 30 months and were switched to <b>velaglucerase</b> <b>alfa</b> in the preceding trial TKT 034 (12 -month trial). Cumulative ERT exposure in the clinical studies ranged from 2. 0 to 5. 8 years.

We used state-of-the-art tools to develop a panel of assays for detection and characterization of antibody responses to <b>velaglucerase</b> <b>alfa</b> and imiglucerase. Highly-sensitive, direct bridging electrochemiluminescence screening assays were developed using samples from treatment-naïve individuals with type 1 Gaucher disease to set cut points. A mouse anti-glucocerebrosidase monoclonal antibody used as a calibrator was shown to have similar affinity and binding kinetics for anti-velaglucerase alfa and anti-imiglucerase antibodies. A quantitative radioimmunoprecipitation assay for IgG antibodies was developed to eliminate false-positives from the highly sensitive screening assay. Using 59 samples from treatment-naïve individuals with type 1 Gaucher disease, the confirmatory cut points were calculated to be 1. 42 ng/mL for anti-velaglucerase alfa antibodies and 3. 23 ng/mL for anti-imiglucerase antibodies. Isotype-specific indirect electrochemiluminescence assays were developed for IgE, IgA, and IgM subclasses. The IgE subclass assay was shown to be more sensitive than the confirmatory assay using sheep anti-glucocerebrosidase polyclonal antibody cross-linked with fragments specific to human IgE, with cut points for anti-velaglucerase alfa or anti-imiglucerase antibodies determined to be 0. 53 and 0. 55 ng/mL, respectively. An assay that detects inhibition in vitro of <b>velaglucerase</b> <b>alfa</b> and imiglucerase hydrolysis of a synthetic substrate in the presence of antibodies was developed to test for neutralizing antibodies. Using 52 individual healthy human donor samples and 35 samples from treatment-naïve individuals with type 1 Gaucher disease, cut points for the <b>velaglucerase</b> <b>alfa</b> and imiglucerase neutralizing antibody assays were determined to be 20 %, such that a sample with greater than 20 % inhibition of enzyme activity in the presence of antibodies was considered positive for neutralizing antibodies.

There are three commercially available enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) products {{for the treatment of}} GD type 1 (GD 1) : imiglucerase, <b>velaglucerase</b> <b>alfa,</b> and taliglucerase alfa. Imiglucerase and <b>velaglucerase</b> <b>alfa</b> are produced in different mammalian cell systems; imiglucerase requires postproduction deglycosylation to expose terminal α-mannose residues, which are required for mannose receptor-mediated uptake by target macrophages. These steps are {{critical to the success of}} ERT for the treatment of visceral and hematologic manifestations of GD. Taliglucerase alfa is the first US Food and Drug Administration-approved plant-cell-expressed recombinant human protein, using carrot root cell cultures. Furthermore, it does not require postproduction glycosidic modifications. It is indicated for treatment of adults with GD 1 in the US, Israel, Australia, Canada, Chile, Brazil, and other countries, and it is additionally approved for the treatment of pediatric patients in the US, Australia, and Canada and for the treatment of hematologic manifestations in pediatric patients with Type 3 GD in Canada and other countries. Our review focuses on the role of taliglucerase alfa in the pediatric population. A literature search through PubMed (from 1995 up till November 2016) of English language articles was performed with the following terms: Gaucher disease, lysosomal storage disease, taliglucerase. Secondary and tertiary references were obtained by reviewing related articles as well as the website www. Clinicaltrials. gov.

40|$|Background Gaucher disease, a rare disorder, {{is caused}} by {{inherited}} deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. It is unique among the ultraorphan disorders in that four treatments are currently approved by various regulatory authorities for use in routine clinical practice. Hitherto, because of the relatively few people affected worldwide, many of whom started therapy during a prolonged period when there were essentially no alternatives to imiglucerase, these treatments have not been systematically evaluated in studies such as randomized controlled trials now considered necessary to generate {{the highest level of}} clinical evidence. Objectives To summarize all available randomized controlled study data on the efficacy and safety of enzyme replacement therapies and substrate reduction therapy for treating Gaucher disease. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register. Additional searches were conducted on ClinicalTrials. gov for any ongoing studies with potential interim results, and through PubMed. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles and reviews. Date of last search: 07 August 2014. Selection criteria All randomized and quasi-randomized controlled studies (including open-label studies and cross-over studies) assessing enzyme replacement therapy or substrate reduction therapy, or both, in all types of Gaucher disease were included. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias in the included studies, and extracted relevant data. Main results Of the 488 studies retrieved by the electronic searches, eight met the inclusion criteria and were analysed (300 participants). Response parameters were restricted to haemoglobin concentration, platelet count, spleen and liver volume and serumbiomarkers (chitotriosidase and CCL 18). Only one publication reported a 'lowrisk of bias' score in all parameters assessed, and all studies included were randomized. Four studies reported the responses to enzyme replacement therapy of previously untreated individuals with type 1 Gaucher disease. Two studies investigated maintenance enzyme replacement therapy in people with stable type 1 Gaucher disease previously treated for at least two years. One study compared substrate reduction therapy, enzyme replacement therapy and a combination thereof as maintenance therapy in people with type 1 Gaucher disease previously treated with enzyme replacement therapy. One study examined substrate reduction therapy in people with chronic neuronopathic (type 3) Gaucher disease who continued to receive enzyme replacement therapy. Treatment-naive participants had similar increases in haemoglobin when comparing those receiving imiglucerase or alglucerase at 60 units/kg, imiglucerase or <b>velaglucerase</b> <b>alfa</b> at 60 U/kg, taliglucerase alfa at 30 units/kg or 60 units/kg, and <b>velaglucerase</b> <b>alfa</b> at 45 units/g or 60 units/kg. For platelet count response in participants with intact spleens, a benefit for imiglucerase over <b>velaglucerase</b> <b>alfa</b> at 60 units/kg was observed, mean difference - 79. 87 (95 % confidence interval - 137. 57 to - 22. 17). There were no other significant differences in platelet count response when comparing different doses of <b>velaglucerase</b> <b>alfa</b> and of taliglucerase alfa, and when comparing imiglucerase to alglucerase. Spleen and liver volume reductions were not significantly different in any enzyme replacement therapy product or dose comparison study. Although a dose effect on serum biomarkers was not seen after nine months, a significantly greater reduction with higher dose was reported after 12 months in the velaglucerase study, mean difference 16. 70 (95 % confidence intervaI 1. 51 to 31. 89). In the two enzyme replacement therapy maintenance studies comparing infusions every two weeks and every four weeks, {{there were no significant differences}} in haemoglobin concentration, platelet count, and spleen and liver volumes over a 6 to 12 month period when participants were treated with the same cumulative dose. A total of 25 serious adverse events were reported, nearly all deemed unrelated to treatment. There are, as yet, no randomized trials of substrate reduction therapy in treatment-naive patients that can be evaluated. Miglustat monotherapy appeared as effective as continued enzyme replacement therapy for maintenance of hematological, organ and biomarker responses in people with type 1 Gaucher disease previously treated with imiglucerase for at least two years. In those with neuronopathic Gaucher disease, no significant improvements in haemoglobin concentration, platelet count or organ volumes occurred when enzyme replacement therapy was augmented with miglustat. One randomized controlled study assessing substrate reduction therapy was published immediately prior to producing the final version of this review, and this, along with a further ongoing study (expected to be published in the near future), will be assessed for eligibility in a future update of the review. Authors' conclusions The results reflect the limitations of analysing evidence restricted to prospective randomized controlled trials, especially when dealing with chronic rare diseases. This analysis suggests that, during the first year of treatment, different recombinant glucocerebrosidases are bio-similar and non-inferior in safety and efficacy for surrogate biological response parameters. Enzyme replacement therapy given at 30 to 45 units/kg body weight every two to four weeks was generally as effective as the 60 unit/kg dose for the assessed clinical outcomes. The analysis emphasise the need to determine whether it is realistic to carry out multi-decade prospective clinical trials for rare diseases such as type 1 Gaucher disease. With large treatment effects on the classical manifestations of the disorder, therapeutic investigations in Gaucher disease mandate innovative trial designs and methodology to secure decisive data concerning long-term efficacy and safety with the realization that knowledge about disease-modifying actions that are sustained are of crucial importance to people with this chronic conditio...|$|E

About 80 +% of either enzyme localized to the liver interstitial cells and < 5 % was recovered in spleens and lungs after bolus i. v. injections. Glucosylceramide (GC) levels and storage cell numbers were reduced in a dose (5, 15 or 60 U/kg/wk) dependent manner in livers (60 - 95 %) and in spleens (approximately 10 - 30 %). Compared to Vela, Imig (60 U/kg/wk) had lesser effects at reducing hepatic GC (p = 0. 0199) by 4 wks; this difference disappeared by 8 wks when nearly WT levels were achieved by Imig. Anti-GCase IgG was detected in GCase treated mice at 60 U/kg/wk, and IgE mediated acute hypersensitivity and death occurred after several injections of 60 U/kg/wk (21 % with Vela and 34 % with Imig). The responses of GC levels and storage cell numbers in Vela- and Imig-treated Gaucher mice at various doses provide a backdrop for clinical applications and decisions...|$|E
40|$|The Gaucher Outcome Survey (GOS) is an {{international}} disease-specific registry established in 2010 for patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Gaucher disease (GD), regardless of GD type or treatment status. Historically, {{there has been a}} limited understanding of type 3 GD (GD 3) and its natural history in patients irrespective of their treatment status. Here, we describe the disease characteristics of patients with GD 3 enrolled in GOS. As of October 2015, 1002 patients had been enrolled, 26 of whom were reported as GD 3. The majority of patients with GD 3 were from the US (13; 50. 0 %), seven (26. 9 %) were from the UK, three (11. 5 %) from Israel, and three (11. 5 %) from Brazil. No patients were of Ashkenazi Jewish origin. Median age of symptom onset was 1. 4 (interquartile range: 0. 5 – 2. 0) years. The most common GBA 1 mutation genotype was L 444 P/L 444 P, occurring in 16 (69. 6 %) of 23 patients who had genotyping information available. Nine patients reported a family history of GD (any type). Of 21 patients with treatment status information, 20 (95. 2 %) had received GD-specific treatment at any time, primarily imiglucerase (14 patients) and/or <b>velaglucerase</b> <b>alfa</b> (13 patients). Hemoglobin concentrations and platelet counts at GOS entry were within normal ranges for most patients, and there were no reports of severe hepatomegaly or of splenomegaly in non-splenectomized patients, most likely indicative of the effects of treatment received prior to GOS entry. This analysis provides information on the characteristics of patients with GD 3 that could be used as the baseline for longitudinal follow-up of these patients...|$|E
40|$|Background: Registers are an {{effective}} tool for tracing {{the dynamics of}} patients with rare pathologies. Objective: Our aim {{was to examine the}} demographic, clinical and genetic features of child Gaucher disease patients in Russia. Methods: We held a retrospective survey of the pediatric register data with regard to children suffering from Gaucher disease. The period of data accounting was from 2006 to 2016. Results: 115 children with Gaucher disease aged from 3 months to 17 years (the median age of diagnosis is 5 years) were registered; 62 them (53. 9 %) are girls. The prevalence of the disease was 0. 32 cases for 100, 000 children. 95 (82. 6 %) children had 1 st type of Gaucher disease, 6 (5. 2 %) — 2 nd, and 1 (12. 2 %) — 3 rd. Maximum morbidity was in Central (27; 23. 5 %) and Volga (27; 23. 5 %) Federal Districts; minimal — in the Far East (3; 2. 6 %). By the time of diagnosis all the patients were suffering from splengomegaly. The genotype and phenotype correlations in 90 children with Gaucher disease were as follows: in case of 1 st type (n = 77), in 21 (27. 3 %) cases, the p. N 370 S/р. L 444 P genotype was set, in 12 (15. 6 %) — the р. N 370 S/other mutation; in case of 2 nd and 3 rd types, in 13 children with neuropathic forms, in 9 (62. 9 %) cases — the p. L 444 P/p. L 444 P, in 3 (231 %) — the p. L 444 P/p. D 409 H. The rest of genotypes were presented by other mutations, 13 of which were revealed for the first time. The p. W 223 R (p. W 184 R) mutation is specific for Russian patients. Enzyme replacement therapy was carried out for 109 patients (94. 8 %) : in 105 (96. 3 %) children (1 st and 3 rd types of Gaucher disease) with imiglucerase, in 4 (3. 7 %) children with 1 st type — with <b>velaglucerase</b> <b>alfa.</b> Pathogenetic treatment stops the main symptoms in most patients. Conclusion: The pediatric Gaucher disease register allows to systemize the data concerning the disease course in children and optimizing the approaches to its monitoring in Russia. </p...|$|E
