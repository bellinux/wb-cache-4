40|$|The {{identification}} of the infectious agents is pivotal for appropriate care of patients with viral diseases. Current viral diagnostics rely on selective detection of viral nucleic acid or protein components. In general, detection of proteins rather than nucleic acids is technically more suitable for rapid tests. However, protein-based <b>virus</b> <b>identification</b> methods depend on antibodies limiting the practical applicability of these approaches. Aptamers rival antibodies in target selectivity and binding affinity, and excel in terms of robustness and cost of synthesis. Although aptamers have been generated for <b>virus</b> <b>identification</b> in laboratory settings, their introduction into routine virus diagnostics has not been realized, yet. Here, we demonstrate that the rationally designed SELEX protocol can be applied on whole virus to select aptamers, which can potentially be applied for viral diagnostics. This approach does not require purified virus protein or complicated virus purification. The presented data also illustrate that corroborating the functionality of aptamers with various approaches is essential to pinpoint the most appropriate aptamer amongst the panel of candidates obtained by the selection. Our protocol yielded aptamers capable of detecting respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), an important pathogen causing severe disease especially in young infants, at clinically relevant concentrations in complex matrices...|$|E

The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has become the method of choice for <b>virus</b> subtype <b>identification.</b> However, designing subtype-specific PCR primer pairs is a very challenging task: on one hand, selected primer pairs must result in robust amplification {{in the presence of}} a significant degree of sequence heterogeneity within subtypes, on the other, they must discriminate between the subtype of interest and closely related subtypes. In this article, we present a new tool, called PrimerHunter, that can be used to select highly sensitive and specific primers for virus subtyping. Our tool takes as input sets of both target and nontarget sequences. Primers are selected such that they efficiently amplify any one of the target sequences, and none of the nontarget sequences. PrimerHunter ensures the desired amplification properties by using accurate estimates of melting temperature with mismatches, computed based on the nearest neighbor model via an efficient fractional programming algorithm. Validation experiments with three avian influenza HA subtypes confirm that primers selected by PrimerHunter have high sensitivity and specificity for target sequences. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: An {{oligonucleotide}} array (microarray) incorporating 13, 000 elements representing selected {{strains of}} hepatitis A virus (HAV), human coxsackieviruses A and B (CVA and CVB), genogroups I and II of Norovirus (NV), and human rotavirus (RV) gene segments 3, 4, 10, and 11 was designed {{based on the}} principle of tiling. Each oligonucleotide was 29 bases long, starting at every 5 th base of every sequence, resulting in an overlap of 24 bases in two consecutive oligonucleotides. The applicability of the array for <b>virus</b> <b>identification</b> was examined using PCR amplified products from multiple HAV and CV strains. PCR products labeled with biotin were hybridized to the array, and the biotin was detected using a brief reaction with Cy 3 -labeled streptavidin, the array subjected to laser scanning, and the hybridization data plotted as fluorescence intensity against each oligonucleotide in the array. The combined signal intensities of all probes representing a particular strain of virus were calculated and plotted against all virus strains identified on a linear representation of the array. The profile of the total signal intensity identified the strain that is most likely represented in the amplified cDNA target. The results obtained with HAV and CV indicated that the hybridization profile thus generated can be used to identify closely related viral strains. This represents a significant improvement over current methods for <b>virus</b> <b>identification</b> using PCR amplification and amplicon sequencing...|$|E

The PCR assay was compared to isolation and electron microscopy for the detection of herpes simplex (HSV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in clinical samples.

In the present study, two New Zealand rabbits were orally immunized with extracts from cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) plants systemically infected with Cowpea severe mosaic virus (CPSMV) and with extracts from papaya (Carica papaya) infected with Papaya lethal yellowing virus (PLYV). The leaf extracts were prepared in saline solution 0. 15 M in the rate of 1 : 1 (w/v) and clarified by a centrifugation of 10, 000 g for 10 min.
