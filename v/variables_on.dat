25|$|A {{common goal}} for a {{statistical}} research {{project is to}} investigate causality, and in particular to draw a conclusion {{on the effect of}} changes in the values of predictors or independent <b>variables</b> <b>on</b> dependent variables. There are two major types of causal statistical studies: experimental studies and observational studies. In both types of studies, the effect of differences of an independent variable (or <b>variables)</b> <b>on</b> the behavior of the dependent variable are observed. The difference between the two types lies in how the study is actually conducted. Each can be very effective.|$|E
25|$|Choice-based {{sampling}} {{is one of}} the stratified sampling strategies. In choice-based sampling, {{the data}} are stratified on the target and a sample is taken from each stratum so that the rare target class will be more represented in the sample. The model is then built on this biased sample. The effects of the input <b>variables</b> <b>on</b> the target are often estimated with more precision with the choice-based sample even when a smaller overall sample size is taken, compared to a random sample. The results usually must be adjusted to correct for the oversampling.|$|E

[...] Here, the twin assumptions of rationality and market efficiency lead to modern portfolio theory (the CAPM), and to the Black–Scholes theory for option valuation; it further studies phenomena and models where these assumptions do not hold, or are extended.

2500|$|The Fourier {{transform}} can be formally {{defined as}} an improper Riemann integral, making it an integral transform, although this definition is not suitable for many applications requiring a more sophisticated integration theory. For example, many relatively simple applications use the Dirac delta function, {{which can be treated}} formally {{as if it were a}} function, but the justification requires a mathematically more sophisticated viewpoint. The Fourier transform can also be generalized to functions of several <b>variables</b> <b>on</b> Euclidean space, sending a function of [...] space to a function of [...] momentum (or a function of space and time to a function of 4-momentum). This idea makes the spatial Fourier transform very natural in the study of waves, as well as in quantum mechanics, where it is important to be able to represent wave solutions as functions of either space or momentum and sometimes both. In general, functions to which Fourier methods are applicable are complex-valued, and possibly vector-valued. Still further generalization is possible to functions on groups, which, besides the original Fourier transform on [...] or [...] (viewed as groups under addition), notably includes the discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT, group = [...] ), the discrete Fourier transform (DFT, group = [...] ) and the Fourier series or circular Fourier transform (group = , the unit circle ≈ closed finite interval with endpoints identified).
