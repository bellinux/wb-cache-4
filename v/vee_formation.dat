25|$|During World War II {{the wreck}} of the vessel was used as a target by Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) bomber pilots from the nearby Garbutt Airfield. On 22 October 1942, six RAAF Bristol Beaufort bombers of 100 Squadron were {{participating}} in a coordinated mock torpedo attack on Townsville Harbour followed by a coordinated practice bombing of the wreck. Following a successful mock attack on Townsville Harbour, the six bombers climbed to approximately 1,000feet (305 meters) and proceeded in a <b>vee</b> <b>formation</b> towards Cockle Bay. Several of the aircraft dived upon the wreck in a bombing run, during which one of the aircraft appeared to strike one of the masts of the sunken vessel, before crashing into the shallow ocean waters approximately 700 meters &765 yards) from the vessel. The plane′s fuselage disintegrated on impact instantly killing three RAAF officers and a United States Navy officer aboard the bomber.|$|E

40|$|The {{function}} of formation flight in Canada Geese {{and other large}} waterfowl is unknown, although two hypotheses have be en proposed. One hypothesis suggests that formation types are a {{function of}} visual and spatial needs; the other suggests that these birds are able to reduce induced drag by formation flight. Published data propose that if formation flight can reduce drag, energy could be saved on long migrations. In this study, autumnal migrating flocks of Canada Geese (Branta c. canadensis) were filmed at a refuge in upstate New York during early October, 1971. The Super- 8 mm films were analyzed to determine the types of formations utilized, the number of birds per flock, the relationship between wind conditions and flight direction, the angles of <b>Vee</b> and Jay <b>formations,</b> the distance between adjacent birds along the legs of <b>Vee</b> <b>formations,</b> and wing-beat frequencies and phase relationships among the birds in a formation. This study describes a technique to measure the angles of <b>Vee</b> <b>formations,</b> {{by the use of}} three-dimensional descriptive geometry, and is the first study in which formation angles have been measured empirically. The results show formation angles much more acute than previously hypothesized, similar wing-beat frequencies among all birds, variable spacing between adjacent birds, and an apparent preference {{of the majority of the}} flocks for flight with crosswinds, and at low wind speeds. Due to the variable, and generally large, spacing between adjacent birds along the legs of the formations analyzed, it seems doubtful that these formations could be using the Vee for an aerodynamic advantage. Although the flocks filmed in this study may be more representative of daily movements than of migratory flights, it is possible that the primary function of formation flight may be to maintain flock unity, thus aiding in navigation. Further work is proposed which might resolve the question of a possible aerodynamic advantage to formation flight...|$|R
5000|$|The center {{squadron}} (known as Able Box) of {{the first}} unit was a composite formation of six aircraft containing the group leader, with the deputy leader flying on its wing. The other four aircraft of Able Box were from the two squadrons assigned to the unit for that mission, with the six bombers formed in two <b>vee</b> <b>formations</b> in trail and stepped lower in altitude. On {{each side of the}} lead squadron were seven-bomber boxes called Baker Box (to the right) and Charlie Box (to the left), each box made up of bombers of one squadron, also in vees of three, with one additional bomber flying in the slot of the center rear (sixth position) of each squadron box, and known as [...] "Tail-end Charlie". This position was usually flown by the least experienced crew in the squadron and was vulnerable to fighter attack, so perilous that it was commonly called the [...] "coffin corner". The second unit of the group formation was configured identically, except that its boxes were named Dog, Easy, and Fox. Each position within a box was numbered, so that the group leader flew the Able One position while the Tail-end Charlie of the leftmost rear squadron flew Fox Seven. The second unit flew at an altitude approximately 500 ft lower than the first unit.|$|R

Because {{they were in}} trail and not in close <b>formation</b> <b>vees,</b> the tugs and gliders were able to penetrate the clouds without losing formation. The columns drew ground fire, however, and one C-47 and its glider went down near Pont l'Abbé on the Douve River, west of the landing zone. Seven transports and several gliders also incurred damage.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{influence}} on the fleet of the drag of multiple towed prolate spheroids to determine the hydrodynamic effect of the viscous interaction between hulls and to study {{the influence of the}} configuration?s shape of multiple hulls in the <b>vee</b> and echelon <b>formations.</b> A series of CFD RANS-SST simulations has been performed at the Reynolds Number 3. 2 × 106 by a commercial code ANSYS CFX 12. 1. Mesh convergence is tested and then validated with experimental and empirical results. The drag of each spheroid is compared against the benchmark drag of a single hull. The results show that the spacing between two hulls determines the individual drag and combined drag. The dominant spacing has been classified into seven zones based on the drag characteristic of twin towed models. Regions are characterised to parallel, echelon, no gain, push, drafting, low interaction, and no interaction. Both the multi-vehicle vee and echelon configurations show limited influence against that of the entire fleet?s energy budget. For an individual spheroid where a lower propulsion cost is required, then the use of three/four in <b>vee</b> or echelon <b>formation</b> should be considered. Based on this numerical information, operators can determine the optimal fleet configuration based on energy considerations...|$|R

50|$|The {{first ten}} {{missions}} of the Eighth Air Force from England in August 1942 were shallow penetrations of France strongly supported by Royal Air Force Spitfire fighter escorts. B-17 Flying Fortresses flew in six-plane squadrons with {{two to four}} miles between squadrons, to avoid mid-air collisions between the inexperienced crews. Although unable to support each other, the six-plane squadrons had the virtues of simplicity and ease of control. The bombers within a squadron were stacked at three altitudes with approximately 150 ft between the highest and lowest, and except for the lead pair, were not in mutually supporting elements. As missions grew larger in size, deeper in penetration, and faced increasingly effective defenders, the AAF recognized that more compact formations were needed {{and returned to the}} three-aircraft <b>vee</b> <b>formation</b> that had been standard before the war. Squadrons consisted of three such vees, all flying at the same altitude, with two such squadrons in a group formation, the second higher, trailing, and staggered to the right. The entire formation was 600 ft high, 500 ft deep, and nearly 2500 ft across. It proved cumbersome to maneuver, as did a 36-plane alternative, and left many bomber gunners with restricted fields of fire.|$|E
5000|$|One major {{advantage}} {{enjoyed by}} the German Jagdgeschwadern {{was the use of}} better tactics. In the late 1930s Fighter Command were not expecting to be facing single-engine fighters over Britain, only bombers. With this in mind a series of [...] "Fighting Area Tactics" [...] were formulated, involving manoeuvres designed to concentrate a squadron's firepower to bring down bombers: with no apparent prospect of escorting fighters to worry about, RAF fighter pilots flew in tight, vee-shaped sections of three. [...] The pilots were forced to concentrate on watching each other, rather than being free to keep a lookout for enemy aircraft. [...] "Fighting Area Tactics" [...] also stipulated that RAF fighter pilots were to open fire at long-range, usually 300 to 400 yards (274 to 365 m), and then break off without closing in. The usual practice was to bore-sight their guns on the ground to create a shotgun pattern at this distance.Luftwaffe fighter pilots, flying combat formations perfected in Spanish Civil War, and utilizing proved principles of the First World War, entered the Second using the basic unit of a pair (Rotte) of widely spaced fighters. They were separated by about two hundred yards. The leader was followed to starboard and to the rear by his wingman, who was trained to stay with his leader at all times. While the leader was free to search for enemy aircraft, and could cover his wingman's blind spots, his wingman was able to concentrate on searching the airspace in the leader's blind spots, behind and below. Two of these sections were usually teamed up into a flight (Schwarm), where all of the pilots could watch what was happening around them. Because the four 109s were spread out four-abreast the Schwarm was hard to spot, unlike the RAF <b>vee</b> <b>formation,</b> and all of the 109s were able to attack and defend, or retreat in pairs, whereas the RAF formations were often split up into individual aircraft which were then extremely vulnerable. The loose Schwarm, because of the reduced risk of collision between aircraft, were also able to climb faster and higher than the tightly grouped RAF fighters, {{which is one of the}} reasons why RAF formations often found themselves being [...] "bounced" [...] from above. When the Luftwaffe fighter units flew as a squadron (Staffel) the three Schwarme were staggered in height and wove back and forth as a means of mutual search and protection.|$|E
40|$|Formation {{flight of}} birds {{improves}} aerodynamic efficiency. Theoretically, 25 birds {{could have a}} range increase of about 70 percent as compared with a lone bird, the advantage being more pronounced {{when there is a}} tail wind. A <b>vee</b> <b>formation</b> is required to equally distribute the drag saving, and, contrary to other statements, the lead bird does not necessarily have the most strenuous position. The angle of the predicted vee compares with that observed in nature; stability mechanisms are described which make it easy and natural for the bird to sense optimal formations...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} much {{speculation}} {{about the significance of}} avian formation flight, yet it 2 ̆ 7 s purpose is still unknown. To explain the phenomenon, two hypotheses have been proposed. The first describes linear formations, such as vee formations, {{as a function of the}} visual, social and spacial needs of the particular bird. The second hypothesis proposes that formation flight exists to conserve flight energy for the formation as a whole. The proposed conservation of flight energy is achieved by an overall reduction of in-flight drag, or by taking advantage of lift components of the vortex wake produced by the preceeding bird in the formation. To confirm basic aerodynamic considerations of flapping bird flight, and to clarify the sequential wing actions during such flight, a Budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus) was taught to fly in a wind tunnel. Airflow characteristics around the bird were made visible by directing a stream of chemical smoke into the tunnel. The bird was photographed during flight. The photographic flight data were used in conjunction with data on formation flight geometry to construct a hypothetical model of a five bird <b>vee</b> <b>formation.</b> The model was subjected to analysis using standard aerodynamic principles to determine the extent of drag savings available to the birds in the formation. The reduction in aerodynamic drag was much less than previously hypothesized, and the use of a fixed wing analogy for flapping flight was determined as an oversimplication. Previous aerodynamic studies of formation flight are discussed and compared to the results of this study, and investigation methods are proposed for further work which may provide answers to the question of a possible aerodynamic advantage to formation flight...|$|E
