There is a need for quantitative evaluation procedures for documenting the performance of video detection technologies.

This research makes use of two new evaluation procedures for video detection, with several measures of performance. The first of these evaluation procedures involves the comparison of the occupancy times of inductive loop <b>detectors</b> and <b>video</b> <b>detectors</b> to find the amount of discrepancy between the two.

40|$|Many {{agencies}} nationwide {{have adopted}} video vehicle detection technology {{as an alternative}} to inductive loops. While many product evaluations have been performed, the majority of these evaluations have concentrated on freeway applications where speed and volume were the primary evaluation criteria. At an actuated intersection, the metrics of speed and volume do not necessarily represent how well a device will operate as a presence detector. Video detection was evaluated at two signalized intersections in West Lafayette, Indiana and Noblesville, Indiana. A camera on each approach was located at the vendor recommended position, at a height of 40 feet and offset so that the camera was approximately inline with the lane line dividing the left-turn lane and through lane. Two additional cameras were located on each approach at less optimal horizontal and vertical locations. Additionally at the West Lafayette site, a fourth camera was located directly above the stop bar so that it looked down onto the detection zone. Inductive loops were used as baseline data to screen for discrepancies. Each time the loop detectors were not in agreement with a specific <b>video</b> <b>detector,</b> a discrepancy was noted. A digital video recording was later observed to determine whether the <b>video</b> <b>detector</b> or the loop detector was in error. An analysis of the data showed video detection was found to produce statistically significantly more false detections and missed detections than the loop detectors on most phases. Generally, only very small variations in <b>video</b> <b>detector</b> performance were observed at the different camera locations. The video detection was also evaluated in terms of its’ consistency of detector turn-on and turn-off times. The video detection displays an undesirable inconsistency between night periods and day periods where it tends to activate 1 to 3 seconds earlier during the night period due to headlight reflections on the pavement. However, the camera at West Lafayette located directly above the stop bar displayed very consistent behavior between the night and day periods...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: While the <b>Video</b> Image <b>Detector</b> {{became a}} popular choice for data {{gathering}} device of freeway management system, {{the outcome of}} operational experience for past years looks dismal. Occupancy data produced was found less accurate while speed data seemed reasonable and, when occupancy data from two consecutive stations were compared and the time lag of measurement was corrected, discrepancy under stable flow conditions went up to 30 %. As a result, poor performance of automatic incident detection algorithms was revealed. This paper tackles on a practical issue faced by many agencies that dominantly deployed <b>Video</b> Image <b>Detectors</b> along its freeway. The main objective is to lower FAR for Automatic Incident Detection algorithms while keeping DR above reasonable performance criterion. High FAR often puts unbearable burden on TMC operators.

Arterial data from Southern California are used in testing the algorithm performance. The test results show that the algorithm can reidentify vehicles with an accuracy of over 95. 9 % when using 92. 4 % of total vehicles, calculate individual travel times with approximately 1 % mean error using the most effective time window and derive travel time distributions that fit actual distributions at a 99 % confidence level...|$|R

Smoke and fire detectors installed in today’s building are considered as point detectors. In case of fire, dependend upon {{the location of the}} fire origin, it may take sometimes for the room temperature to rise to the detector setting point or for the smoke to reach the detector. In recent years, the application of image processing algorithms for automatic video smoke detection continued to gain a momentum due to its capability to overcome the major drawbacks of the traditional smoke and fire detection methods. This paper explains the laboratory experimental works on smoke optical density measurement and video image processing of early smoke plume release.

40|$|We are {{developing}} the super broad band interferometer {{by applying the}} Fourier Transform Spectrometer(FTS) to aperture synthesis system in mm and sub-mm bands. We have constructed a compact system based on the Martin and Puplett type Fourier Transform spectrometer (MP-FT). We call this equipment Multi-Fourier Transform interferometer (MuFT). The band width of the system can be extended as large as one wants contrary to the severely limited band width of the usual interferometer due to {{the speed of the}} AD converter. The direct detectors, e. g. bolometer, SIS <b>video</b> <b>detector,</b> can be used as the focal plane detectors. This type of detectors have a great advantage in FIR band since they are free from the quantum limit of the noise which limits the sensitivity of the heterodyne detectors used in the usual interferometers. Further, the direct detectors are able to make a large format array contrary to the heterodyne detectors for which construction of a large format array is practically difficult. These three characteristics make one be possible to develop high sensitive super broad band FIR interferometer with wide field of view. In the laboratory experiments, we have succeeded in measuring the spectroscopically resolved 2 D image of the source in 150 GHz- 900 GHz band. The future application of this technique to the observations from the space could open new interesting possibilities in FIR astronomy.

Replacing ectopic s. c. implantation with organ-specific orthotopic implantation reproduces human tumor growth and metastasis. Strong fluorescent labeling with green fluorescent protein along with inexpensive <b>video</b> <b>detectors,</b> positioned externally to the mouse, allows the monitoring of details of tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastatic spread. However, the sensitivity of external imaging is limited by light scattering in intervening tissue, most especially in skin. Opening a reversible skin-flap in the light path markedly reduces signal attenuation, increasing detection sensitivity many-fold. The observable depth of tissue is thereby greatly increased and many tumors that were previously hidden are now clearly observable. This report presents tumor images and related quantitative growth data previously impossible to obtain. Single tumor cells, expressing green fluorescent protein, were seeded on the brain image through a scalp skin-flap.
