5000|$|Static dischargers, {{commonly}} known as static wicks or static discharge wicks, are installed on the trailing edges of aircraft, including (electrically grounded) ailerons, elevators, rudder, wing, horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer</b> <b>tips.</b> Fitted on almost all civilian aircraft today, they are high electrical resistance (6-200 megaohm) devices with a lower corona voltage than the surrounding aircraft structure. They control the corona discharge into the atmosphere, isolating noise and preventing it from interfering with aircraft communication equipment. They are used on aircraft to allow the continuous satisfactory operation of onboard navigation and radio communication systems during precipitation (p-static) conditions. Precipitation static is an electrical charge on an airplane caused by flying through rain, snow, ice, or dust particles. When the aircraft charge is great enough, it discharges into the surrounding air. The discharge path is through pointed aircraft extremities, such as antennas, wing <b>tips,</b> <b>vertical</b> and horizontal <b>stabilizers,</b> and other protrusions. The discharge creates a broad-band radio frequency noise from DC to 1000 MHz. This RF noise can affect aircraft communication. During adverse charging conditions (air friction), static dischargers limit the potential static buildup on the aircraft and control interference generated by static charge. Static dischargers are not lightning arrestors and do not reduce or {{increase the likelihood of}} an aircraft being struck by lightning. Static dischargers are subject to damage as a result of lightning strike to the aircraft, and should be inspected after a lightning strike to ensure proper static discharge operation. Static dischargers will not function if they are not properly bonded to the aircraft. There must be a conductive path {{from all parts of the}} airplane to the dischargers, otherwise they will be useless. Access panels, doors, cowls, navigation lights, antenna mounting hardware, control surfaces, etc., can create static noise if they cannot discharge through the static wick.|$|R
500|$|The Akutan Zero {{was loaded}} into the [...] and transported to Seattle, {{arriving}} on August 1. From there, it was transported by barge to Naval Air Station North Island near San Diego where repairs were carefully carried out. These repairs [...] "consisted mostly of straightening the <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer,</b> rudder, wing <b>tips,</b> flaps, and canopy. The sheared-off landing struts needed more extensive work. The three-blade Sumitomo propeller was dressed and re-used." [...] The Zero's red Hinomaru roundel was repainted with the American blue circle-white star insignia. The whole time, the plane was kept under 24-hour military police guard in order to deter would-be souvenir hunters from damaging the plane. The Zero was fit to fly again on September 20.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the use of}} a <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer</b> is most common, it is {{possible}} to obtain directional stability with no discrete <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer</b> {{is mounted}} exactly vertically, and the {{horizontal}} stabilizer is directly mounted to the empennage (the rear fuselage). This {{is the most}} common <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer</b> configuration.|$|R
40|$|Results {{of tests}} on a slender delta wing will be {{presented}} to describe the effect <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizers</b> have on vortex breakdown at high angles of attack. The test will consist of flow visualization using Laser Induced fluorescence. The experimental test will vary <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizers</b> to compare the effect on the flow. It is anticipated that the presence of <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizers</b> will spatially lock the position of vortices thereby reducing the wing-rock. Using the experimental data, the geometry of the <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizers</b> will Be altered to provide for a well behaved flow. Tests were conducted on a modified delta wing to analyze vertical tail influence on delta wing roll oscillation...|$|R

50|$|An {{interesting}} {{feature of}} the YA-19 design was its horizontal stabiliser located forward of the vertical tail. The small size of the <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer</b> caused some directional instability (about the yaw axis) so the last YA-19 (S/N 38-555) was equipped with enlarged <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the structural repairs in the radio compartment and tail gunner position, numerous repairs {{have been made to}} the horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizers</b> and related fairings. The <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer</b> is ready for remounting. Radio mounting brackets and landing light housings have been refabricated from scratch.|$|R

50|$|A {{variation}} on the twin tail, it has three <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizers.</b> An example of this configuration is the Lockheed Constellation. On the Constellation it was done to give the airplane maximum <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer</b> area while keeping the overall height low enough {{so that it could}} fit into maintenance hangars.|$|R
50|$|The PZL.37 was {{designed}} in the mid-1930s at the PZL factory in Warsaw by Jerzy Dąbrowski.The first PZL.37/I prototype, fitted with a single <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer,</b> flew on 13 December 1936. The second prototype PZL.37/II, with twin <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizers</b> and other improvements, was accepted for production. The first 10 serial aircraft were produced in 1938 as the PZL.37A variant with a single <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer,</b> however. The next 19 interim aircraft were built as PZL.37A bis, with a twin tail. They all were powered by Bristol Pegasus XII B radial engines produced in Poland under licence.|$|R
25|$|According to the {{official}} accident report, after the first officer made his initial rudder pedal input, he {{made a series of}} alternating full rudder inputs. This led to increasing sideslip angles. The resulting hazardous sideslip angle led to extremely high aerodynamic loads that resulted in separation of the <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer.</b> If the first officer had stopped making these inputs at any time before the <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer</b> separation, the natural stability of the airplane would have returned the sideslip angle to near 0°, and the accident would have been avoided. The airplane performance study indicated that when the <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer</b> separation began, the aerodynamic loads were about two times the loads defined by the design envelope. It can be determined that the <b>vertical</b> <b>stabilizer's</b> structural performance was consistent with design specifications and exceeded certification requirements.|$|R
