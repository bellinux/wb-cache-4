5|$|When in 1952 Messiaen {{was asked}} to provide a test piece for flautists at the Paris Conservatoire, he {{composed}} the piece Le merle noir for flute and piano. While he had long been fascinated by birdsong, and birds had made appearances in several of his earlier works (for example La Nativité, Quatuor and <b>Vingt</b> regards), the flute piece was based entirely on {{the song of the}} blackbird.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, Messiaen wrote Visions de l'Amen ("Visions of the Amen") for two pianos for Yvonne Loriod {{and himself}} to perform. Shortly {{thereafter}} he composed the enormous solo piano cycle <b>Vingt</b> regards sur l'enfant-Jésus ("Twenty gazes upon the child Jesus") for her. Again for Loriod, he wrote Trois petites liturgies de la présence divine ("Three small liturgies of the Divine Presence") for female chorus and orchestra, {{which includes a}} difficult solo piano part.|$|E

5|$|In the 1930s, Cowell's student Lou Harrison {{utilized}} keyboard clusters {{in several}} {{works such as}} his Prelude for Grandpiano (1937). At least {{as far back as}} 1942, John Cage, who also studied under Cowell, began writing piano pieces with cluster chords; In the Name of the Holocaust, from December of that year, includes chromatic, diatonic, and pentatonic clusters. Olivier Messiaen's <b>Vingt</b> regards sur l'enfant Jésus (1944), often described as the most important solo piano piece {{of the first half of}} the twentieth century, employs clusters throughout. They would feature in numerous subsequent piano works, by a range of composers. Karlheinz Stockhausen's Klavierstück X (1961) makes bold, rhetorical use of chromatic clusters, scaled in seven degrees of width, from three to thirty-six semitones, as well as ascending and descending cluster arpeggios and cluster glissandi. Written two decades later, his Klavierstück XIII employs many of the same techniques, along with clusters that call for the pianist to sit down on the keyboard. George Crumb's Apparitions, Elegiac Songs, and Vocalises for Soprano and Amplified Piano (1979), a setting of verse by Walt Whitman, is filled with clusters, including an enormous one that introduces three of its sections. The piano part of the second movement of Joseph Schwantner's song cycle Magabunda (1983) has perhaps the single largest chord ever written for an individual instrument: all 88 notes on the keyboard.|$|E

A two-year move to Paris in 1970, working for <b>Vingt</b> Ans and Photo magazines, and continuing to correspond for the British publications, let Lee expand his contacts and reputation in the fashion industry.|$|E
50|$|In 1869 he left Indonesia for the Netherlands, {{where he}} studied in Delft and Amsterdam. In 1880 he became {{a student at the}} Rijksakademie in Amsterdam. From 1882 to 1886 he lived in Brussels where he joined Les XX (Les <b>Vingts),</b> a group of artists centred on James Ensor. Toorop worked in various styles during these years, such as Realism, Impressionism Neo-Impressionism and Post-Impressionism.|$|R
50|$|The {{agents of}} her father-in-law, {{who had been}} tasked with {{acquiring}} her remains and having them temporarily buried until they could be interred in Dreux, reportedly {{mixed in with the}} crowd {{in order to be able}} to gain possession of it. They averted the intentions of the crowd to display the remains before the home of de Lamballe and her father-in-law at the Hôtel de Toulouse by saying that she had never lived there, but at the Tuileries or the Hôtel Louvois. When the carrier of the head, Charlat, entered an alehouse, leaving the head outside, one agent, Pointel, took the head and had it interred at the cemetery near the Hospital of the Quinze <b>Vingts.</b>|$|R

There were a handful of pioneering large-scale enterprises at the edge of the city; the Antony candle factory and a large factory making printed cotton fabrics, directed by the German-born Christophe-Philippe Oberkampf at Jouy-en-Josas, ten miles from the center of the city. Opened in 1762, this plant was one of the most modern factories in Europe; at its peak in 1774, it employed two thousand workers and produced sixty four thousand pieces of fabric.|$|R
50|$|The armed {{rebellion}} continued the next day. From 2 {{o'clock in the}} morning, the call to arms had sounded in the Quinze <b>Vingts.</b> The tocsin tolled before 10 o'clock in Fidelite (Hotel de Ville) and Droits de l'Homme. In these two sections and in Arcis, Gravilliers, and Popincourt illegal assemblies were held. The three sections of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine sprang to arms and marched on the Convention, led by Guillaume Delorme, a wheelwright and captain of the gunners of Popincourt. Supported by some sections of the center, they appeared on the Place du Carrousel at 3:30 in the afternoon, loaded guns and trained them on the Convention. General Dubois, who commanded the Convention forces, had 40,000 men under him; the insurgents may have numbered 20,000. It was the largest display of military force drawn up for battle that had been seen in Paris since the Revolution began. But no shots were fired: when the Convention's gunners and gendarmerie deserted to the opposing side, the insurgents failed to follow up the advantage. Towards evening negotiations began; petitioners were received at the bar of the Assembly, repeated their demands for bread and the Constitution of 1793 and received the presidential embrace. Lulled by vain hopes of promises to be fulfilled, the insurgents thereupon retired to their various sections.|$|R
