5000|$|Garry Moore was {{the next}} to appear, declaring [...] "when Dr. Stanton sees me in color he'll say to himself, 'For this I went to the Supreme Court?'" [...] During his {{appearance}} Moore showcased several commercial products, including Tenderleaf tea, Duz laundry soap, Ivory soap and Chase and Sanborn coffee. He was also joined by Durward Kirby in a well-received comedy skit in which Moore played a pitchman who attempted to demonstrate a hopelessly useless <b>vegetable</b> <b>slicer.</b>|$|E
50|$|The clue {{following}} the Detour instructed teams {{to head to}} Bai Sha Market where they had to locate a marked stall and convince 10 locals to buy a <b>vegetable</b> <b>slicer</b> for no less than ¥5 each, to receive their next clue. The clue told teams to travel for their next destination city: Brisbane. Upon arriving in Brisbane, teams had to search the airport car park for a marked vehicle containing their next clue, sending them to Kangaroo Point and find Captain Burke Park to search their next clue, directing them to Boggo Road Gaol.|$|E
5000|$|Later, Ratner {{would use}} {{television}} to sell products directly to consumers {{in a manner}} similar to later telemarketers such as Ron Popeil. For example, if he was selling a <b>vegetable</b> <b>slicer</b> for $2.98, he would offer consumers who called within the next fifteen minutes a bonus peeler [...] "worth" [...] an additional $2.98. And the first 100 callers got a bonus french fry slicer [...] "worth" [...] $2, offering $7.96 of value for only $2.98. In reality, the three products combined only cost Ratner about 40¢, leaving plenty of profit. The $2.98 price point (which was also used for d-CON) was chosen because his research showed that products above $3 were unappealing to many consumers. [...] As of 1954, Ratner was spending more than $1 million a year on 10-minute infomercials across 300 TV stations.|$|E

50|$|A modern chef's knife is a {{multi-purpose}} knife {{designed to}} perform well at many differing kitchen tasks, rather than excelling at any one in particular. It {{can be used for}} mincing, <b>slicing,</b> and chopping <b>vegetables,</b> <b>slicing</b> meat, and disjointing large cuts.|$|R
50|$|A {{sandwich}} is a food typically {{consisting of}} <b>vegetables,</b> <b>sliced</b> cheese or meat, placed on or between slices of bread, or more generally any dish wherein {{two or more}} pieces of bread serve as a container or wrapper for another food type. The sandwich began as a portable finger food in the Western world, though over time it has become prevalent worldwide.|$|R
30|$|Five {{bunches of}} {{unblemished}} fruits from each cultivar were selected at random and harvested. The maturity of fruits chosen {{for this study}} was ‘full three-quarters’, meaning that the individual fingers had less prominent angles i.e. fully mature but green: this criterion for maturity is based on the Jamaican practice (Simmonds 1966). The harvesting of bunches was done three times depending on the availability of fruits that reached the required stage of maturity. This means that each variety had 15 bunches for analysis. The harvested bunches were stored at ambient conditions (28 – 31  °C, 56 – 62  % RH) on a wooden platform. Twenty fruits at the proximal, midsection and distal hand position from the five bunches were randomly selected, washed and peeled. The peeled fruits were cut into slices of 0.5  cm thick disc using a <b>vegetable</b> <b>slicer</b> (Qualheim-electro-cut, model 101, Qualheim Inc. USA). The slices were then diced, thoroughly mixed thoroughly with a Hobart cutter (model 84142, The Hobart manufacturing Co Ltd, Don Mills Ont. Canada). The sample was freeze-dried using an Edward’s bench freeze-drier (Edwards Instrument Ltd., Hornchurch, Essex, UK). Prior to analysis the freeze-dried samples were ground with a Hammer Mill (Christy and Morris Ltd., England) equipped with a 250 μm sieve. The flour samples obtained were packaged into polypropylene bags and kept under cold storage (4  °C).|$|E
50|$|Pakoras {{are popular}} across South Asia and Great Britain (particularly in Scotland). They are {{sometimes}} {{served in a}} yogurt-based gravy (curry), as a main dish pakora curry, {{rather than as a}} separate snack. In this case, the pakoras are generally doughier and are made from chopped potato, onion, and chili mixed into the batter, instead of individual fried <b>vegetable</b> <b>slices.</b>|$|R
50|$|Nakiri bocho and usuba bocho are Japanese-style {{vegetable}} knives. They {{differ from}} the deba bocho in their shape, as they have a straight blade edge suitable for cutting {{all the way to}} the cutting board without the need for a horizontal pull or push. These knives are also much thinner. While the deba bocho is a heavy blade for easy cutting through thin bones, the blade is not suitable for chopping vegetables, as the thicker blade can break the <b>vegetable</b> <b>slice.</b> The nakiri bocho and the usuba bocho have much thinner blades, and are used for cutting vegetables.|$|R
5000|$|Tahdig (ته دیگ, tah [...] "bottom" [...] + dīg [...] "pot") is a {{specialty}} of Iranian cuisine consisting of crisp rice {{taken from the}} bottom of the pot in which the rice (chelow) is cooked. It is traditionally served to guests at a meal.Ingredients commonly added to tahdig include yogurt and saffron, bread, potato and tomato.Variations of tahdig include placing thin <b>vegetable</b> <b>slices</b> at the bottom of the pot, so they crisp up instead of the rice. Common vegetables include potato, carrots, and lettuce. Iranians also apply this crisping method to spaghetti as well, providing a hardened base.|$|R
50|$|Mi caluk is {{a typical}} Aceh food which is often found in {{traditional}} markets and food courts in Pidie Regency and Pidie Jaya Regency). It is a noodle dish served with a splash of thick spicy chili sauce, peanuts and little pieces of <b>vegetables,</b> <b>sliced</b> cucumber and krupuk. The presentation of mi caluk is slightly similar to spaghetti. Each serving of mi caluk is not large, so it is more precisely categorised as a snack. Thus, sellers of mi caluk are often found in makeshift stalls, {{and do not have}} stalls in a food court as is usual for food and drink stalls in Aceh.|$|R

40|$|Vacuum frying {{may be a}} good {{alternative}} for the production of dehydrated fruit and <b>vegetable</b> <b>slices.</b> In this study, a relationship between water losses with frying time during vacuum frying process of potato chips has been developed. A first order kinetic model was used, in which drying rate constant {{is a function of the}} main process variables, i. e. oil temperature, sample thickness and vacuum pressure. The experimental data of Garayo and Moreira (2000) have been used to validate the model. Generally there was a good agreement between the calculated results and the experimental data. Then, the effect of initial water content and vacuum pressure has been studied. Keywords: kinetic model, potato, vacuum frying, water los...|$|R
5000|$|In Cooking Mama, {{the player}} is tasked with cooking various meals using the device's touch screen. Following the {{instructions}} of the titular [...] "Mama", the player uses the stylus or their finger to perform different kitchen tasks, including chopping <b>vegetables,</b> <b>slicing</b> meat, flipping food in pans, and arranging the final {{items on the}} plate. The version of the game for iOS also {{takes advantage of the}} accelerometer in its devices with some similar gameplay to Cooking Mama: Cook Off. Each of these tasks is performed by completing a mini-game which usually lasts less than 10 seconds. The gameplay structure consists of the player progressing through a series of short minigames. The game features a total of 96 different dishes.|$|R

40|$|The {{polymorphic}} region sequences in the iap gene {{were analyzed}} in 25 strains of Listeria monocytogenes isolated from cheeses {{in the state}} of Rio Grande do Sul, and compared with reference strains. This investigation distinguished two clusters of L. monocytogenes: I (20 strains) and II (5 strains). Key words: Listeria monocytogenes; iap gene; cheese; TN amino acids. Listeria monocytogenes is an important foodborne pathogen responsible for causing outbreaks of listeriosis in humans and many animal species (10). The major clinical symptoms of L. monocytogenes infections in humans are abortion, septicemia, and meningitis (4). Listeria monocytogenes has been isolated from foods such as milk, dairy products, <b>vegetables,</b> <b>sliced</b> vacuum-packaged meat products, chickens, and meat (3, 12). Outbreaks of listeriosis show a correlation between infection and the ingestion of food, mainly dairy product...|$|R

Other typical main dishes are ssalbap (steamed rice), seariban (steamed three grains), japgokbap (steamed various grains), kimchibap (steamed rice with kimchi), and bijibap (rice with soy pulp, residue {{in the preparation}} of tofu).|$|R
40|$|A model {{describing}} {{the heat and}} mass transfer involved in food drying is presented. The aim {{is to determine the}} effect of air temperature on the performance of the drying process applied to fresh-cut <b>vegetable</b> <b>slices,</b> but other effects can be easily incorporated in the model. The model allows to disregard one of the most limiting parameters in such modeling, i. e. the average heat and mass transfer coefficients at the food/drying substrate interface, which are generally taken from the literature. Such assumptions are limiting {{in the sense that they}} are referred to average transfer conditions and general geometries. The presented model relies upon a finite-element solution of time-dependent differential equations for simultaneous and conjugate heat and moisture transfer in a two-dimensional domain, without any inference in such empiricism. A special formulation for drying kinetic of the substrate is also exploited, and a treatment of the dependence of the properties upon the residual moisture content is included. After proper validation with the available experimental measurements, the numerical solution is discussed by presenting each involved field variables, emphasizing on the conjugate nature of the drying process. Due to its flexibility and generality, the model can be used in common industrial driers’ optimization, even in the assumption of a laminar flow field...|$|R
