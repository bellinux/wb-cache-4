Without the forbidding example of Buck Weaver to haunt them, it is unlikely Mann and Sand would have snitched on their fellow players. After Landis' unforgiving treatment of the popular and basically honest Weaver they dared not to. And once prospectively crooked players knew that honest players would no longer shield them, the scandals stopped.|$|E
5|$|Clements {{began his}} {{campaign}} for re-election in 1956 by defeating Joe Bates, the candidate favored by Chandler, in the Democratic senatorial primary. On April 30, 1956, Kentucky senator Alben Barkley died suddenly of a heart attack. With the Democratic primary already over, the Democratic State Central Committee was charged with selecting a candidate to run for Barkley's seat. They chose Wetherby, Clements' former lieutenant governor. Journalist John Ed Pearce later recorded that Clements had favored Chandler's choice, Joseph Leary, as a candidate rather than Wetherby. Clements didn't think Leary had a <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> of winning, but he felt Leary's selection would keep Chandler from throwing his support to the Republican candidates.|$|E
25|$|Chee contested in the Bukit Batok by-election, 2016. He {{garnered}} 38.8% of {{the total}} votes cast, bringing a swing of -11.78% to the votes favouring the ruling party's hold in the Bukit Batok constituency {{as compared to the}} 2015 general elections result. On his election loss, Chee was more opinionated than introspective. In an interview immediately after the announcement of the election results, Chee was critical of the 'vicious campaign' and personal attacks by leaders from the ruling party and the mainstream media. Sympathizers of this view have started an online petition (Singaporeans Against Gutter Politics) during the period leading up to the polling day. He asserts that he would have had a <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> if Singapore were a fair and democratic society.|$|E

According to some pollsters, the FRITZ had <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>chances</b> {{of getting into}} parliament, and the LIF with its founder Schmidt as its leading candidate, as well; the conditions were {{as good as they}} had never been before for smaller parties, according to some. Analysts agreed that apart from LIF and FRITZ, all others would fail to enter parliament. Analysts furthermore asserted that the candidacy of the FRITZ would likely make the race for third place between Greens and FPÖ very competitive, as the FRITZ would likely gain protest votes which would otherwise go to the FPÖ. The critical time for the extraparliamentary parties was stated to be the very first phase of the campaign, when the larger parties had not yet really started campaigning and the smaller parties had a chance to gain publicity.|$|R
50|$|The first {{fifteen minutes}} {{of the second half}} {{featured}} a complete onslaught by the undermanned Germany. With chances coming one after another, confused and disorganized Serbia was completely pushed back despite having an extra player on the pitch. The German offensive culminated in the 60th minute when Vidić needlessly handled the ball in the Serbian penalty area leading to the penalty shot being awarded to Germany. However, Lukas Podolski's low shot was parried by Stojković while Subotić then provided a key clearance to deny Mesut Özil a chance to get a shot away off the rebound. The penalty save provided an injection of confidence for Antić's team as it finally began to play in the second half. Even then, 10-man Germany still had the initiative but Serbia created a few <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>chances</b> as well such as Žigić's header bouncing off the crossbar. Serbia eventually won the match 1-0 and brought back hopes of progression with it.|$|R

50|$|They {{were away}} to Welsh side Swansea City, in their next league game. For the first time, United visited Swans new home, Liberty Stadium. United {{dominated}} {{for the first}} 15 minutes and, at 11 minutes, Hernández scored from a pass from the left by Ryan Giggs. The home side had a <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> {{a few minutes later}} after a cross from the right saw the striker in front of an open goal, but was not able to shoot and Jonny Evans prevented him from doing it. For the rest of the first half it was an end to end affair, but with no real danger from any of the two. The second half started and Swansea got off as the better side. For 35 minutes they dominated the game and had a couple of good opportunities to score, but United were defending slidly. For the last ten minutes United got back to their feet and had <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>chances</b> of scoring. Rooney shot from outside the box a few times but he wasn't successful. Antonio Valencia also had a shot from outside the box going just out. Phil Jones had a forward run which almost ended in goal, but his shot hit the far post. The game ended 0-1 for United, their third consecutive win by this score.|$|R

Most of her life, her parents had her to West Jerusalem {{several times a week}} for treatment by Israeli doctors. She had been waiting to receive a transplant for two years. Yoni's brother Ari spoke to the media about the family decision. He said: [...] "I think the most important principle here is that life was given to another human being." [...] Scott Simon commented on the symbolism of Yoni's wish to become a doctor never becoming a reality, yet still saving a life even in his death: [...] "Yoni Jesner will not live to become a doctor, but just as surely, he will be remembered as a healer. Yasmin Rumeileh's father, Abu, who runs a tea and coffee shop in East Jerusalem, said this week, [...] "We are one family. They saved my daughter. Part of their son is living in my daughter.

50|$|The goalkeeper's primary task is {{to prevent}} the other team from scoring a goal, which is {{achieved}} when the ball fully passes the goal line. The game {{has become much more}} fast-paced over the years which demands that the goalkeeper has to bring the ball back into play very fast, leading to fast breaks or turnovers which provide <b>very</b> <b>good</b> scoring <b>chances.</b> Strategies like the second wave or the so-called schnelle Mitte, a fast action play intended to catch the opposing team off guard. After having conceded a goal the keeper passes the ball immediately to the centre of the court for a throw-off. In some situation the goalkeeper even scores a goal himself by taking advantage {{of the fact that the}} other team's goalie is too far away from his own goal and throwing the ball across the whole field into the empty goal. The German goalkeeper Johannes Bitter managed to score two goals in that manner over the course of his 112 international games.|$|R

5000|$|... 2 October 2012 saw Sheffield Wednesday face Burnley at Turf Moor, {{with the}} Owls hoping {{to bring a}} stop to their six {{consecutive}} defeats. With Wednesday having conceded seventeen goals in eleven games, and Burnley fifteen goals in eleven games, the clash was anticipated to include many goals. After starting the better side, Sheffield Wednesday found themselves behind against the run of play, in-form Charlie Austin scoring on the twenty-second minute for Burnley. Less than a minute later though Chris O'Grady had equalised for the Owls with Michail Antonio assisting. Seven minutes before the break and Sheffield Wednesday found themselves behind again, Charlie Austin getting his second of the game. Nearly halfway through the second half and Chris O'Grady scored again to make the scores 2-2. Wednesday had several <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>chances</b> to win the game, but Charlie Austin managed to grab his hat-rick, and the Owls could have been heading for their seven consecutive defeat, but Michail Antonio hit a magnificent twenty-five yard strike {{less than a minute}} later, and the game ended in a very entertaining 3-3 draw. The following Friday, the day before the home match against Hull City, it was confirmed that Wednesday Academy product Mark Beevers was to join Millwall on an emergency loan deal for 28-days, Beevers has so far made eight appearances this season for the Owls. The day after Mark Beevers' one-month departure, Sheffield Wednesday faced Hull City at home, with the team looking to build on their dramatic draw from mid-week. The first-half went by without much action to report, with both teams seemingly to concentrate on their defensive duties, due to the amount of goals each team has let in within recent games. The second-half saw a decision go against winger Michail Antonio, which could have arguably been given, and therefore ended up being a penalty kick. However, with the game going towards a simple goalless draw, neat work by Hull City saw substitute Aaron McLean's shot creep into the far corner, and give Hull City the one goal victory.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of pulmonary edema is divided in cardiogenic and non-cardiogenic. Cardiogenic edema pathogenically {{is caused by}} elevated hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary capillaries due to left sided congestive heart failure. Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema is categorized depending on the underlying pathogenesis in low-alveolar pressure, elevated permeability or neurogenic edema. Some important examples of causes are upper airway obstruction like in laryngeal paralysis or strangulation for low alveolar pressure, leptospirosis and ARDS for elevated permeability, and epilepsy, brain trauma and electrocution for neurogenic edema. The differentiation between cardiogenic versus non-cardiogenic genesis is not always straightforward, but most relevant, because treatment markedly differs between the two. Of further importance is {{the identification of the}} specific underlying cause in non-cardiogenic edema, not only for therapeutic but particularly for prognostic reasons. Depending on the cause the prognosis ranges from <b>very</b> poor to <b>good</b> <b>chance</b> of complete recovery...|$|R

This gentleman would insist on conducting the witnesses' examination on the basis that he knew all about the fraud practised with reference to the supposed death of Arthur Heigham.

5000|$|United's next league {{match was}} on 9 December at the City Ground against Nottingham Forest. Despite being {{bottom of the}} table, Forest held the {{visitors}} to a 0-0 draw [...] - [...] Newcastle's first goalless draw in 74 matches [...] - [...] {{in the first game}} in which Shearer and Ferdinand had played together since the 5-0 win against Manchester United. The result left Keegan's side five points behind leaders Arsenal albeit with a game in hand. The result confirmed Newcastle's loss of form; they had taken six points from their last six matches. The poor run continued on 17 December when they lost 2-1 at Coventry City. The hosts established as two-goal lead inside the first half an hour thanks to a goal and an assist from Darren Huckerby, who was transferred to Coventry from Newcastle a month earlier due to Keegan's decision to withdraw the reserve side out of the reserve league. As the season moved into the festive period of fixtures, Newcastle welcomed league leaders Liverpool to St James'. Such was the home side's poor form, they entered this match as underdogs [...] - [...] the first time they had done so at home under Keegan. Shearer gave United the lead after a Ferdinand header was saved by David James on 28 minutes, only for Fowler to equalise seconds before the half-time whistle. Despite several chances, neither side scored in the second half and both teams had to settle for a 1-1 draw which left Liverpool three points clear of Arsenal in second at Christmas and Newcastle level with Manchester United on 31 points but seven adrift of Liverpool in sixth place. Newcastle's run of games without a win continued on Boxing Day when they were beaten 1-0 by Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park where Shearer was subjected to abuse from home fans on his return to his former club. The defeat prompted the manager to say: [...] "we didn't deserve to win but we still had two or three <b>very</b> <b>good</b> <b>chances.</b> We are not playing well - we can't kid anyone about that". The defeat prompted journalist Alan Nixon to comment that Keegan's side [...] "appear to be fading from the Championship race", however, United re-found their best form just two days later at home when winning their first league game in almost two months by beating Tottenham Hotspur. Two goals each from Shearer, Ferdinand and Lee saw United overwhelm their opponents, though The Independent noted that: [...] "the fulcrum of much of Newcastle's sweeping play was the brilliant Peter Beardsley, restored to the central attacking support role in which he schemes [...] - [...] even three weeks short of his 36th birthday [...] - [...] like a classic inside-forward." [...] Assistant manager Terry McDermott told reporters afterwards: [...] "that's what I would call a classic Newcastle United performance. We have come in for a lot of criticism and this was the perfect answer. It was a magnificent performance and the score could easily have reached double figures. We hadn't had a good Christmas but those seven goals have changed all that. We never believed we had blown the title. We're certainly not out of the race. People will write us off at their peril." [...] The result meant that Newcastle finished 1996 by moving back to within five points of leaders Liverpool, with Manchester United in second place.|$|R
