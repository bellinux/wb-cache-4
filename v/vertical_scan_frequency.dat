40|$|Abstract. Electromagnetic optical {{scanning}} mirrors for both horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>scanning</b> of a Laser Projection Display have been proposed. Electromagnetic actuation is selected {{because of the}} millimeter-sized mirror. For low cost reason, the glass and PMMA films are respectively used as the main structure of horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>scanning</b> mirrors. A mathematical model considering the operation frequency of the Laser Projection Display has been derived to fast design the geometry of the scanning mirror. In order to machine scanning mirrors with high quality geometry, the 193 nm excimer laser is used as the major machine tool. Different control circuits {{have been developed to}} control both horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>scanning.</b> The <b>scanning</b> <b>frequencies,</b> 4. 15 kHz and 260 Hz respectively for horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>scanning</b> mirrors, have been measured by laser Doppler vibrometer. Comparing to other optical scanners, 193 nm excimer laser machined {{optical scanning}} mirrors have advantages in low cost and easy to fabricate. In this paper, a Laser Projection Display consisting of the horizontal and <b>vertical</b> <b>scanning</b> mirrors has also been built to show the application potential.

50|$|The Graphics Card (HGC) was {{essentially}} an MDA-compatible monochrome card with an added all-points-addressable graphics mode.

In the text mode, which the Hercules card reverted to when the PC was reset, it was almost exactly like the IBM MDA and could be treated by software as if it was an MDA. For full MDA compatibility, thr HGC used a 6845 CRT controller (CRTC) chip like the one found on the MDA. The HGC was so compatible with the MDA in this regard that it did not provide its own BIOS ROM and was recognized and operated by the standard PC system board BIOS as an MDA.|$|R

A laser beam scans laterally from left-to-right at a <b>scanning</b> <b>frequency</b> of ωx, then rapidly moves back to the left, and scans the next line. During this time, the vertical position increases steadily downward at a slow <b>scanning</b> <b>frequency</b> of ωy. The lateral and <b>vertical</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>frequencies</b> determine the line resolution and the frame rate, respectively. This raster scanning provides a rectangular FOV {{as well as a}} simple reconstruction of the scanned images by synchronizing the position of a scanning beam spot with the operational signals. However, raster MEMS scanners have some technical limitations due to high driving voltages or low mechanical stability for the slow axis. In other words, the fast and slow scanning can be often achieved by operating at either resonance or non-resonant frequency. However, the non-resonant motion requires relatively much higher operation voltage than the resonant motion [10]. Rivera et al. have orthogonally attached two piezoelectric bimorphs to a single mode fiber, which shows a resonant motion for the fast lateral axis and a non-resonant motion for the slow vertical axis. Piyawattanametha et al. have successfully demonstrated raster scanning with two resonant MEMS mirrors [11] but the MEMS mirror with a low resonant frequency is vulnerable to the external mechanical shock due to a small spring constant. Do et al. also presented raster scanning endomicroscope using a non-resonant tubular piezoelectric actuator [12]. The non-resonant raster scanner readily changes the FOV with both uniform scanning density and a stable orthogonal shape but it still requires high driving voltages. The bottom image of Fig.  2 b indicates the microscopic image of ex vivo mouse tissue based on the raster scanning [10].|$|R
40|$|A high {{performance}} micro scanner {{is a critical}} element to enable efficient beamsteering in miniature laser projection displays. Such scanner requires a large mirror size, large scan angles, and a high frequency to ensure good optical resolutions. However, these conditions also induce large dynamic deformations on the mirror plate, resulting in optical aberrations. This dissertation describes a new design of two-dimensional micro scanner with good dynamic atness. The design targeted to achieve a resolution analogue to VGA video requirements (640 pixels x 480 pixels) with a modulation transfer function (MTF) value of 0. 5. Another portion of the dissertation {{is dedicated to the}} fracture strength investigations of single crystal silicon torsion springs. The fracture strength knowledge will contribute to the design of a reliable micro scanner under high frequency, large angle actuation conditions. The demonstrated two-dimensional micro scanner has a high horizontal <b>scanning</b> <b>frequency</b> of 30. 84 kHz and a low <b>vertical</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>frequency</b> of 335 Hz. It has two special features to enhance the mirror plate atness: 1. the backside islands to increase rigidity and 2. the multiple-joint torsion springs to evenly distribute forces onto the mirror plate. A novel DRIE-TMAH combination process was developed to fabricate the backside islands with an average height of 86 um and > 96 % within-wafer uniformity. When operated with a mechanical scan angle of 4. 8 °, the 1 mm diameter mirror plate had a root-mean-square dynamic deformation of 13. 86 nm. This translates to a 25 nm deformation at +- 10 °, which is less than 1 / 20 wavelength of the 635 nm light source. The MTF of the scanner was calculated based on the deformations and proved the scanner's ability to achieve a VGA resolution with 0. 5 MTF. Another part of the dissertation documents the findings of the fractures strength experiments performed with single crystal silicon torsion springs. Three types of specimens with different sizes and stress distributions were fabricated for the experiments. The specimens were actuated to different angles to determine the stress levels at which the springs fracture. Fitting the fractures stress data with a two-parameter Weibull distribution function, the characteristic stresses of the three specimen types were found to be 3. 10 GPa, 2. 51 GPa, and 4. 76 GPa. Among them, the design with the highest stress concentration and lowest surface roughness exhibits the highest fracture strength. This indicates a high stress concentration to be desirable for torsion spring designs. A normalized characteristic stress was implemented to attempt the fracture strength prediction of a new device. However, the analyses demonstrated such predictions to be unreliable if the surface condition of the new device is {{different from that of the}} known and tested specimens...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. White light {{interferometry}} {{has become}} an important method for measuring micro surface profiles with a long vertical range and nano-scale resolution. However, environmental vibration encountered in in-field optical inspection is usually unavoidable and it affects measurement performance significantly. Isolating vibration sources from the measurement system sometimes is not completely effective, especially within complicated in-field fabrication environment. Therefore, in this research we aim to develop a novel method in achieving white-light fringe-locking condition during <b>vertical</b> <b>scanning</b> processes.

There are increasing needs for measurements of such items as machined surfaces, contact lenses, paint texture, cell structure, and integrated circuit devices, to name a few.

This work provides a new algorithm, which called here "PSI on the Fly" technique, as a solution for improving height resolution of <b>vertical</b> <b>scanning</b> interferometers. This dissertation begins with a review of white-light interference microscopes. The height and lateral resolutions are derived based on scalar diffraction theory. Next, various well-established. algorithms for finding a topographic map of the small object surface are discussed. The work proceeds with a discussion of the phase change upon reflection and its influence on the coherence envelope. Then phase measurement interferometry methods are reviewed. The emphasis is in errors in phase measurement resulting from using a white light source instead of a monochromatic light source as in the usual case. The following chapter describes and examines an often-observed artifact of vertical-scanning interferometry when applied to step heights. The artifact is called "bat wings" because of its appearance. The physical cause of the "bat wings" artifact is discussed through a diffraction model. The next chapter proposes an improved vertical-scanning interferometry algorithm.
