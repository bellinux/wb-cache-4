40|$|Includes bibliography. Mobile video {{transmission}} poses many challenges in standard wireless network like Wireless Local Area Network or IEEE 802. 11. The challenges range from handover, delay, packet loss, jitter, fading and signal loss. Some {{studies have suggested}} an increase in network resources {{as a way to}} cater for the huge demands and reduce congestion in the network, while others suggest that optimizing the available resources might also reduce these challenges. In line with the optimization approach, this study proffers a solution to the <b>video</b> <b>loss</b> in IEEE 802. 11 networks. It uses the Single-Queue Priority Scheduler to rearrange the video frames based on their importance. An MPEG frame (trace file) was rearranged by assigning weights to the video frames I, B and P. These frames were then prioritized and arranged in a single queue. A parameter to actively arrange the queue () was deduced from three metrics- deadline, priority and cost. This value Sn was used to arrange the video trace or frames from the lowest to the highest. The arranged video trace or frames were injected into the queue and transmitted in that order. The results show that the implementation of Single-Queue Priority Scheduler algorithm improves the {{video transmission}} in Wireless Local Area Network. Without Single-Queue Priority Scheduler algorithm, the buffer overflow loss is 22. 8 % of the total load, but with SQPS algorithm, it is 8 % of the total load. Without SQPS algorithm, the Packet Loss Ratio is about 61 %; but with the SQPS algorithm, the PLR reduces to 34 %. Although, this scheduling algorithm produced better results with a reduction in packet loss, there were still some losses in the network...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThanks to its {{cost-effectiveness}} {{and wide}} deployment, the 802. 11 WLAN is considered {{today as the}} de-facto wireless access network for the last mile connection. In this regards, QoS provisioning in 802. 11 WLAN for multimedia services is becoming a main objective that should be enforced to enable reliable commercial offers. To reach this goal, the different mechanisms proposed by 802. 11 standards, including fragmentation, physical rate variation, retransmission, and transmission power adjustment, should be exploited intelligently by the application using a cross-layer interaction. This would allow service scalability by improving resources availability and enhancing QoS provisioning. In this paper, we propose an adaptive cross layer fragmentation technique aiming to provide a reliable and QoSbased IPTV service delivery over 802. 11 WLAN. In our architecture, the link layer fragmentation is controlled automatically by the application layer in a cross-layer interaction to find a trade-off between the video quality degradation and the overhead ratio introduced by the MAC fragmentation.

30|$|Another {{subset of}} ML {{techniques}} are considered by Demirbilek et al. [114] {{and used to}} develop no-reference models to predict QoE for audiovisual services. These techniques include: decision tree ensemble methods (RF and BG), and deep learning (DNN). Genetic programming (GP) is also considered and compared against the ML techniques. All models are trained and validated through 4 ∼ 10 -fold cross-validation on the INRS dataset [113]. The dataset includes user-generated MOS on audiovisual sequences encoded and transmitted with varying video frame rates, quantization parameters, filters and network packet loss rates. 34 no-reference application- and network-level features are considered. Experiments with different feature sets show that, apart from the DNN model, all models perform better with the complete set of features, and hence do not require feature processing. On the contrary the DNN model performs better when trained only with 5 independent features, namely: video frame rate, quantization, noise reduction, <b>video</b> packet <b>loss</b> rate, and audio packet loss rate. Also, the one-hidden layer DNN model outperforms the model with 20 hidden layers in terms of RMSE (0.403 vs. 0.437) and PCC (0.909 vs. 0.894). The conducted experiments also show that all models perform quite well and that the RF model with complete set of features performs the best (lowest RMSE 0.340 and highest PCC 0.930).

With more redundant packets, the receiver can recover from more severe losses, {{at the cost of}} larger end-to-end delays and higher loads imposed on networks. Therefore, in the design of FRA-JSCC, the goal is to use ‘just enough’ FEC redundancy to meet the <b>video</b> application’s <b>loss</b> requirement (Δ).

We identify the time boundaries of activities on the channel (called channel slot boundaries) and derive a Markov Renewal Process of the contending nodes on these epochs. This is achieved {{by the use of}} attempt probabilities of the contending nodes as those obtained from the saturation fixed point analysis of [2]. Regenerative analysis on this MRP yields the desired steady state performance measures. We then use the MRP model to develop an effective bandwidth approach for obtaining a bound {{on the size of the}} buffer required at the video queue of the AP, such that the streaming <b>video</b> packet <b>loss</b> probability is kept to less than 1 %. The results obtained match well with simulations using the network simulator, ns- 2. We find that, with the default IEEE 802. 11 e EDCA parameters for access categories AC 1, AC 2 and AC 3, the voice call capacity decreases if even one streaming video session and one TCP file download are initiated by some wireless station. Subsequently, reducing the voice calls increases the video downlink stream throughput by 0. 38 Mbps and file download capacity by 0. 14 Mbps, for every voice call (for the 11 Mbps PHY).
