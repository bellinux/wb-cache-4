The next four issues were dated October 1952, December 1952, January 1953 and February 1953, and then a monthly run began with April 1953 that lasted without a break until the July 1955 issue. The next issue was October 1955, which inaugurated another bimonthly period that ran with perfect regularity until the last issue, October 1958. The price remained at 35cents throughout.|$|E

25|$|Because most gases are {{difficult}} to observe directly, they are described {{through the use of}} four physical properties or macroscopic characteristics: pressure, <b>volume,</b> <b>number</b> of particles (chemists group them by moles) and temperature. These four characteristics were repeatedly observed by scientists such as Robert Boyle, Jacques Charles, John Dalton, Joseph Gay-Lussac and Amedeo Avogadro for a variety of gases in various settings.

25|$|However, , {{there was}} still a {{significant}} amount of policy-driven distortion in global agricultural product prices. The three agricultural products with the greatest amount of trade distortion were sugar, milk and rice, mainly due to taxation. Among the oilseeds, sesame had the greatest amount of taxation, but overall, feed grains and oilseeds had much lower levels of taxation than livestock products. Since the 1980s, policy-driven distortions have seen a greater decrease among livestock products than crops during the worldwide reforms in agricultural policy. Despite this progress, certain crops, such as cotton, still see subsidies in developed countries artificially deflating global prices, causing hardship in developing countries with non-subsidized farmers. Unprocessed commodities (i.e. corn, soybeans, cows) are generally graded to indicate quality. The quality affects the price the producer receives. Commodities are generally reported by production quantities, such as <b>volume,</b> <b>number</b> or weight.|$|E

2500|$|The modern-era Kurjer Lubelski, {{without an}} obvious {{connection}} to the original revolutionary broadsheet, commenced publication {{with the issue of}} 18(30)December 1865, with the frequency of publication of two issues per week: it was founded by Julian Konrad Liedtke (18351870). [...] The first publisher of the newspaper was Władysław Jan Kossakowski (18331870), with Liedtke as the first editor-in-chief. The editorship was taken over by Lucjan Dembowski in 1869 (beginning with vol.4, No.1), and again in the same year by Władysław Wdowiński (beginning with vol.4, No.97). [...] From 1875 onwards the editor-in-chief was Teofil Głębocki. [...] The paper was often published with extra supplements with separate mastheads that read, Dodatek do Nr... Kurjera Lubelskiego ("Supplement to No... of The Kurjer Lubelski"), etc. [...] The frequency (as well as the format) of publication underwent significant variations throughout the newspaper's history, {{but it was not a}} daily newspaper (excluding Sundays and bank holidays) until 1878. [...] From 1875 the newspaper appeared without the <b>volume</b> <b>number</b> being indicated in the masthead. [...] In 1879 the publication merged with the Gazeta Lubelska and continued publication under the latter title [...] not to be reactivated independently as Kurjer Lubelski until 1906 when this was done on the initiative of Mieczysław Biernacki whose efforts spelled the beginning of a golden age in the newspaper's life. [...] The first issue of the revived Kurjer Lubelski, published on 4January 1906 under the editorship of Władysław Stodolnicki, was initially followed by only 15 additional numbers. [...] However, the newspaper survived, rising to the premier position among the press of the Lublin Land, until it was banned by the censorship of the Russian Empire on 27June 1913. [...] During its second phase the publication was associated with such personages who served on the editorial board as Stefan Żeromski, Witold Chodźko, Mieczysław Biernacki, the well-known physician and social activist Aleksander Staniszewski (18581926), and most memorably the philosopher Jan Hempel (18771937) who acted as secretary to the Board.|$|E
