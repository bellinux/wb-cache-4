5|$|La Guairita stream {{flows into}} the Guaire in northeastern El Hatillo. The Guaire river is the eastern limit of the municipality, {{separating}} it from Sucre and Paz Castillo in the southeastern sector of El Hatillo. La Guairita serves as the northern boundary between El Hatillo and the municipalities of Baruta and Sucre. Limiting Baruta to the west, {{the boundaries of the}} municipality follow El <b>Volcán,</b> Pariaguán, La Mata and other peaks until they meet Turgua range in southeastern El Hatillo.|$|E
5|$|Only a {{few months}} after the failed {{offensive}} against the capital, major dissensions in the FROLINAT shattered all vestiges of unity and badly weakened Libyan power in Chad. On the night of 27 August, Ahmat Acyl, leader of the <b>Volcan</b> Army, attacked Faya-Largeau with the support of Libyan troops in what was apparently an attempt by Gaddafi to remove Goukouni from the leadership of the FROLINAT, replacing him with Acyl. The attempt backfired, as Goukouni reacted by expelling all Libyan military advisors present in Chad, and started searching for a compromise with France.|$|E

5|$|The Barranca Blanca and Carachi Ignimbrites {{are covered}} by lavas from <b>Volcán</b> Carachipampa and are thus older than 0.75 mya. They contain pumices of various colours and lithic fragments, {{including}} mylonite and schist. The Barranca Blanca ignimbrite is white in colour and contains rhyodacitic white pumice with subordinate amounts of grey trachyandesitic pumice. The Carachi Ignimbrite overlies the Barranca Blanca ignimbrite. It is weakly welded and contains white pumice and crystals with fiamme. Both of these are pyroclastic density currents that were still hot {{at the time of}} deposition.|$|E
5|$|The volcano {{appears to}} be part of a north-south {{trending}} group of rhyolitic, silicic Quaternary volcanoes (including Puelche Volcanic Field, Laguna del Maule, and <b>Volcán</b> Domuyo) that veers off the north-northeast direction of the rest of the Andes. The directional formation of this belt corresponds to the fold-and-thrust movement of the nearby Malargüe fault, which formed in the Tertiary and remained active until the early Pliocene or late Miocene. This may suggest that Calabozos' activity is more dependent on local processes than subduction of the Nazca Plate.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{signing the}} Kano Accord, Libya was incensed that the GUNT {{did not include}} any {{of the leaders of}} the <b>Volcan</b> Army and had not {{recognized}} Libyan claims on the Aouzou Strip. Since 13 April there had been some minor Libyan military activity in northern Chad, and support was provided to the secessionist movement in the south. However, a major response came only after 25 June, when the ultimatum of Chad's neighbors for the formation of a new, more inclusive coalition government expired. On 26 June, 2,500 Libyan troops invaded Chad, heading for Faya-Largeau. The Chadian government appealed for French help. The Libyan forces were first stymied by Goukouni's militiamen, and then forced to retreat by French reconnaissance planes and bombers. In the same month, the factions excluded by the GUNT founded a counter-government, the Front for Joint Provisional Action (FACP), in northern Chad with Libyan military support.|$|E

5|$|Located at {{the highest}} point of the Municipality lies El <b>Volcan,</b> a small {{mountain}} of about 1500 meters from sea level. This mountain has a Downhill course that has about 500 meters of vertical drop, it is used by hundreds of riders a day during dry and wet weather, mostly on weekends. The course {{is open to the}} public and riding is neither specifically allowed nor prohibited by law. The trails are also used by hikers all week long. Shuttles are about 10 Venezuelan bolivars per trip, they run from the parking lot of a Farmatodo drug store in La Boyera, up to the summit using public avenues and paved roads, taking from 15 minutes to 30 minutes depending on traffic on the area. The course apart from being used mostly for recreational purpose, also has been used for irregularly scheduled downhill races due to the lack of organisation in the riders community.|$|E
25|$|The two volcanoes (known as <b>Volcán</b> Concepción and <b>Volcán</b> Maderas) {{are joined}} by a low isthmus to form one island {{in the shape of}} an hourglass, {{dumbbell}} or peanut. Ometepe has an area of 276km2. It is 31km long and 5 to 10km wide. The island has an economy based on livestock, agriculture, and tourism. Plantains are the major crop.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the eleven}} {{municipalities}} which {{are classified as}} highly marginalized economically, only three have a significant indigenous population (Temoac, Miacatlán and Tetela del <b>Volcán).</b> However, within larger municipalities such as Cuernavaca and Jiutepec, indigenous communities tend to be highly marginalized.|$|E

25|$|All {{major cities}} {{are located in}} the {{highlands}} and Pacific coast regions; by comparison, Petén is sparsely populated. These three regions vary in climate, elevation, and landscape, providing dramatic contrasts between hot, humid tropical lowlands and colder, drier highland peaks. <b>Volcán</b> Tajumulco, at , is the highest point in the Central American countries.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} higher demand for zinc by Asian {{countries}} and higher international prices in 2006, the Peruvian zinc industry produced 1.2 Mt of zinc in concentrates, which remained {{about the same}} level as that of 2005. Of the total output, the main producers’ contributions were, in order of tonnage, <b>Volcan</b> (232,645 t), Empresa Minera Los Quenuales S.A. (199,600 t), CMA (178,180 t), Compañía Minera Milpo S.A. (79,600 t), El Brocal (69,800 t), Empresa Administradora Chungar S.A.C. (62,230 t), Atacocha (59,800 t), and others (320,000 t).|$|E
25|$|The {{southeast}} half of {{the island}} consists of <b>Volcán</b> Maderas, which has a crater lake and supports a diverse rainforest environment. Maderas is also believed to have risen in the Holocene epoch and rises 1,394m above sea level. It is considered extinct or possibly dormant. The large lagoon in its crater was discovered on April 15, 1930, by the farmer Casimiro Murillo. The sides of the volcano are mainly covered with coffee and tobacco plantations while the remainder is rain forest. Much {{of this part of}} the island is now a nature reserve.|$|E

25|$|A seminal {{event in}} Alajuela's history was the 1968 {{eruption}} of <b>Volcán</b> Arenal. Residents previously {{referred to it}} as Mount Arenal. In the years before the eruption, residents reported rises in the temperature of ground water and small tremors. Beginning on 28 July 1969, residents of surrounding towns reported constant tremors. The eruptions began on 29 July, spewing ash into the neighboring provinces and launching boulders into the sky. The initial explosions were so strong that three craters were instantaneously created. The cities of Tabacón, Pueblo Nuevo and San Luís were buried, killing 87 people. Crops were destroyed and livestock were killed.|$|E

During the preliminary round of the event, which took place on August 14, Morales {{was placed in the}} first heat against two other athletes. She finished the race in 2:14.54, placing second ahead of last place heat finalist Erin Nicole <b>Volcan</b> Smith of Venezuela (2:15.58) and behind heat leader Kang Yeongseo of South Korea (2:14.52). Overall, 34 athletes finished in the event, and Morales ranked in 27th place. She did not advance to the next round.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, <b>Volcan</b> was {{the first}} ranked zinc {{producer}} {{in the country with}} an output of 232,645 t of zinc, 65,540 t of lead, and 413.5 t of silver from its operations in the Cerro de Pasco property located in the Department of Cerro de Pasco, and the San Cristobal, Carahuacra, and Andaychahua base-metal mines located in the Department of Junin. Empresa Minera Los Quenuales S.A. was the second ranked zinc producer from its operations in Casapalca and Iscaycruz Mines, which produced 199,540 t of zinc, 21,600 t of lead, and 183.4 t of silver from the Iscaycruz, the Pachangara, and the yauliyacu Mines. CMA was the third ranked zinc producer from its operations in the Antamina Mine, which produced 178,180 t of zinc and 301.5 t of silver (Ministerio de Energía y Minas, 2007a).|$|E
25|$|Due to its {{location}} near Mexico City, {{the state has}} one of the lower rates of economic marginalization, ranking 20th of 33 units in economic marginialzation, based on housing and education. The most urbanized areas of the state are the strongest economically, with the least urbanized being the poorest. Two of the factors {{in the development of the}} state's economy since the 1960s are the opening of the Mexico City-Acapulco highway through the state in 1952 and the creation of the CIVAC (Ciudad Industrial Valle de Cuernavaca) industrial complex in 1965. This concentrated the population growth into the northern part of the state. Only eleven of the states 33 municicpalities are considered to have any serious degree of marginalization: Tlalnepantla, Totolapan, Tlayacapan, Tetela del <b>Volcán,</b> Ocuituco, Zaculapan, Temoac, Tepalcingo, Amacuzac, Coatlán del Río, Miacatlán and some parts of Puente de Ixtla.|$|E
