5|$|Tohari's second novel, Kubah {{was written}} in two months {{and based on the}} events {{surrounding}} the Communist Party and the 30September Movement coup in 1965. Published in 1980 by Pustaka Jaya, Kubah came at a time when literary works with similar themes– the <b>victimisation</b> of Communist Party members– were scarce. The novel has also been characterised as dawah (Islamic preaching). Reception of Kubah was mostly mixed; critics praised the novel for its subject matter and criticised it for its predictability. It received a literary award in 1981, and in 1986 it was translated into Japanese.|$|E
5|$|At a May Day rally, held on Sunday 6 May in Eastville, local Trades Council members {{publicly}} criticised the TGWU. On {{the same}} day Paul Stephenson had organised a demonstration march to St Mary Redcliffe church, {{but there was a}} poor turnout. Some local West Indians said they should not ripple the water and, according to Roy Hackett, they may have feared <b>victimisation.</b> The dispute led to what has been described as one of the largest mailbags that the Bristol Evening Post had ever received, with contributors writing in support of both sides of the issue.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1998 Act, whistleblowers in the United Kingdom had no {{protection}} against being dismissed by their employer. Although they could avoid being sued for {{breach of confidence}} thanks to a public interest defence, this did not prevent subtle or open <b>victimisation</b> in the workplace, including disciplinary action, dismissal, failure to gain promotion or a pay rise. During the early to mid-1990s, interest in whistleblower protection grew, partially because {{of a series of}} financial scandals and health and safety accidents, which investigations into showed could have been prevented if employees had been permitted to voice their concerns, and partially because of the work of the Committee on Standards in Public Life. In 1995 and 1996, two private member's bills dealing with whistleblowers were introduced to Parliament, by Tony Wright and Don Touhig respectively, but both efforts fell through. When Richard Shepherd proposed a similar bill, however, he got government support for it on the condition that it be an amendment to the Employment Rights Act 1996 rather than a new area of law in its own right. Public Concern at Work, a UK-based whistleblowers charity, was involved in the drafting and consultation stages of the bill. The case of Graham Pink added to the pressure to introduce whistleblower protection legislation.|$|E
25|$|Gang {{bullying}} {{or group}} bullying — is a serial bully with colleagues. Gangs can occur anywhere, but flourish in corporate bullying climates. It {{is often called}} mobbing and usually involves scapegoating and <b>victimisation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Both {{positions}} are <b>victimisation</b> narratives. One depicts the Chinese as helpless victims of brutal Japanese imperialism {{in the winter}} of 1937–38, while the other depicts the gullible Japanese, innocent in the ways of the world, as victims of Chinese machinations and propaganda in the post-war era.|$|E
25|$|Constitutional scholar Pierre de Vos has {{questioned}} {{the notion that}} the legalisation of same-sex marriage in South Africa represents the pinnacle of the human rights struggle of members of the LGBT community. He argues that those who are not involved in long term monogamous relationships and those who cannot {{come out of the closet}} and get married because of the threat of <b>victimisation</b> may not see any benefit from the legislation.|$|E
25|$|BME LGB {{communities}} are disproportionately affected by homophobic violence, abuse and harassment. In {{a study conducted}} in London, BME LGB people {{were more likely to}} experience physical abuse, more likely to experience harassment from a stranger and were equally likely to have experienced verbal abuse as their White British LGB counterparts, and due to the pressures of discrimination and <b>victimisation,</b> {{are more likely to have}} poorer mental health.|$|E
25|$|Aneurin Bevan {{also joined}} the Tredegar {{branch of the}} South Wales Miners' Federation and became a trade union activist: he was head of his local Miners' Lodge at only {{nineteen}} years of age. Bevan became a well-known local orator and was seen by his employers, the Tredegar Iron Company, as a troublemaker. The manager of the colliery found an excuse to get him sacked. But, {{with the support of}} the Miners' Federation, the case was judged as one of <b>victimisation</b> and the company was forced to re-employ him.|$|E
25|$|The Coalition Government fell in 1965, {{due to the}} {{desertion}} {{of several}} members. However, the number of votes won by the LSSP increased at the general election held that year. After the election, supporters of the party were subject to a vicious campaign of <b>victimisation</b> by the new seven-party coalition led by the UNP. In 1968, the LSSP joined the SLFP and the CP in a United Front (Sri Lanka). That year's joint May Day rally {{was said to be}} the biggest ever to take place in Sri Lanka.|$|E
25|$|Moves to {{community}} living and services {{have led to}} various concerns and fears, from both the individuals themselves {{and other members of}} the community. Over a quarter of individuals accessing community mental health services in a US inner-city area are victims of at least one violent crime per year, a proportion eleven times higher than the inner-city average. The elevated victim rate holds for every category of crime, including rape/sexual assault, other violent assaults, and personal and property theft. <b>Victimisation</b> rates are similar to those with developmental disabilities.|$|E
25|$|Often {{there is}} a {{noticeable}} difference between the perceived risk of becoming a victim of crime and the statistical probability. However, hearing about events in the media or knowing others who have been victimised increases public perception {{of the risk of}} <b>victimisation.</b> In some western countries, crime accounts for up to 25% of news coverage. The formation of a ‘fear of crime' feedback loop allows more citizens to be surveyed as fearful, more politicians {{to be able to use}} crime fear as a political issue, in an ever increasing spiral that crime is out of control.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the last}} 25 years, prison populations have {{increased}} significantly {{in these countries}} despite widespread declines in reported crime, evident in both recorded crime statistics and victim surveys. In the United States for instance, the rate of imprisonment has risen dramatically despite a National Crime <b>Victimisation</b> Survey in 2007 which showed that property and violent crime rates in the United States were the lowest they had been since 1973. In England and Wales, between 2006 and 2008 the prison population increased by 7% despite the British Crime Survey revealing in 2008 that crime was the lowest {{it had been in}} since 1981 when the victim survey was first published.|$|E
25|$|The government's <b>victimisation</b> of the Isaaq was {{not only}} limited to {{northern}} regions susceptible to SNM attacks. During the period of unrest {{in the north of}} the country, the government started arresting civilian Isaaq residents of the capital, Mogadishu. Those arrested Isaaqs included businessmen, Somali Airlines staff, army officers, employees of relief agencies, and civil servants. Similar to the case in Berbera, Erigavo, Sheikh and other towns in the north, there was no SNM activity in Mogadishu, moreover, Mogadishu was geographically removed from the situation in the north of the country due to its position in the southern regions, nevertheless the Somali government committed to its policy of persecution of Isaaq civilians in Mogadishu.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{implied term}} of an {{employment}} contract {{that may be}} broken is mutual trust and confidence. In Johnson v Unisys Ltd the House of Lords held by 4 to 1 that damages for breach of mutual trust and confidence {{at the point of}} dismissal should not exceed the statutory limit on unfair dismissal claims, because otherwise the statutory limits would be undermined. This limit was £74,200 in 2013, though the median award was merely £4,560. This meant a computer worker who developed a psychiatric illness following a wrongful dismissal procedure could not claim his total economic losses, which would have amounted to £400,000 in damages. However, if the breach occurs while the employment relationship subsists, that limit is inapplicable. So in Eastwood v Magnox Electric plc, a school teacher who also suffered psychiatric injury, but as a result of harassment and <b>victimisation</b> while he still worked, could claim for a full measure of damages for the breach of mutual trust and confidence. In any event the limit is merely implied and depends on construction of the contract, so that it may be opted out of by express words providing for a higher sum, for example, by expressly providing for a disciplinary procedure. A notable absence of an implied term at common law historically (i.e. before the development of mutual trust and confidence) was that an employer would have to give any good reasons for a dismissal. This was recommended to be changed in the Donovan Report 1968, and it launched the present system of unfair dismissal.|$|E
25|$|In 1992 a {{campaign}} was organised against poorings {{out by a}} vocal minority of students who claimed <b>victimisation.</b> College authorities banned poorings out {{on the basis of}} legal liability in 1993. Rather than simply disappearing, the tradition of the pooring out has merely evolved to suit the contemporary climate. Today, pooring out is an honour generally reserved for students elected to prominent positions in the college, particularly the Student Heads. Both men and women may now be poored out; however the actual practice is most often gender segregated. For example, a man of college is defended by men and poored out by men, while a woman of college is defended by women and poored out by women. On account of the administration’s aforementioned hostility to the practice, they are no longer supposed to take place on college grounds and are absolutely forbidden in Strachan Hall. Rather, poorings-out now often occur during The Lit. However, their actual form has changed little. The student selected to be poored out lies across a table while three of his fellow students lie across him to defend him. The assemblage is then rushed by the upper year students, who shred the gown of the person, while removing his or her defenders. Once a student has been poored out, they wear the remains of their gown bound as a sash. The gown is never to be washed, mended or sewn and must be worn in its original state as a sign of pride for the experiences of the student whilst at Trinity.|$|E
25|$|Originally a {{sub-category}} {{of direct}} discrimination, harassment {{is now an}} independent tort which requires no comparator. The Protection from Harassment Act 1997, and now the Equality Act 2010 sections 26 and 40, define harassment as where a person's dignity is violated, or the person is subject to an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment. An employer will be liable for its own conduct, but also conduct of employees, or customers if this happens on 2 or more occasions and the employer could be reasonably expected to have intervened. In a straightforward case, in Majrowski v Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Trust a gay man was ostracised and bossed about by his supervisor {{from the very start}} of his work as a clinical audit co-ordinator. The House of Lords held the laws create a statutory tort, for which (unless a statute says otherwise) an employer is automatically vicariously liable. Under the Equality Act 2010 section 27, an employer must also ensure that once a complaint is brought by a worker, even if it ultimately proves to be unfounded, that worker should not be victimised. This means the worker should not be subject to anything that a reasonable person would perceive as detrimental. In St Helen’s MBC v Derbyshire the House of Lords held a council victimised female staff who were pursuing an equal pay claim when it sent letters warning (without much factual basis) that if the claim went ahead, the council would be forced to cut school dinners and make redundancies. Because it attempted to make the workers feel guilty, a reasonable person would have regarded this as a detriment. By contrast, in Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police v Khan, a sergeant with a pending race discrimination claim was denied a reference by the employer that he was suing. The House of Lords held this could not be considered <b>victimisation</b> because the Constabulary was only seeking to protect its legitimate interests by not giving a reference, so as to not prejudice its own future case in the discrimination hearings.|$|E
500|$|The {{campaign}} against Boycott became a [...] in the British press after {{he wrote a}} letter to The Times. Newspapers sent correspondents to the West of Ireland to highlight what they viewed as the <b>victimisation</b> of a servant of a peer of the realm by Irish nationalists. Fifty Orangemen from County Cavan and County Monaghan travelled to LordErne's estate to harvest the crops, while a regiment of the 19th Royal Hussars and more than 1,000 men of the Royal Irish Constabulary were deployed to protect the harvesters. The episode was estimated to have cost the British government and others at least £10,000 to harvest about £500 worth of crops.|$|E
500|$|Bigelow was {{motivated}} to start work on Strange Days shortly {{after a series}} of cultural incidents that occurred in the United States in the early nineties, such as the Lorena Bobbitt trial and the 1992 Los Angeles riots that followed the Rodney King verdict. Referring to the latter, she noted, [...] "I was involved in the downtown cleanup, and I was very moved by that experience. You got a palpable sense of the anger and frustration and economic disparity in which we live." [...] She also developed the character of Mace from Cameron's original script to make [...] "valuable connections between female <b>victimisation</b> and racial oppression." [...] Both Strange Days and Cameron's 1994 action film True Lies were part of a multimillion-dollar production deal between Lightstorm Entertainment and 20th Century Fox. However, the financing was unevenly divided between the two films, with Strange Days being initially budgeted at $30 million and True Lies at $70 million.|$|E
500|$|The initialisms LGBT or GLBT are not {{agreed to}} by {{everyone}} that they encompass. For example, some argue that transgender and transsexual causes {{are not the same}} as that of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people. This argument centers on the idea that transgenderism and transsexuality have to do with gender identity, or a person's understanding of being or not being a man or a woman irrespective of their sexual orientation. LGB issues can be seen as a matter of sexual orientation or attraction. These distinctions have been made in the context of political action in which LGB goals, such as same-sex marriage legislation and human rights work (which may not include transgender and intersex people), may be perceived to differ from transgender and transsexual goals. Another problem associated is that people may not always identify with the given labels. One study conducted in Australia discovered that all the participants had experienced microaggressions, bullying and anti-social behaviours. However, not all of the participants believed their <b>victimisation</b> to be motivated by anti-LGBTIQ beliefs. What it did establish is that many of these microaggressions occurred due to misconceptions and conflicting opinions on what these labels entailed (in particular, transsexual and bisexual). Evidently, by placing blanket labels on many people, who all experience difference narratives, there are inconsistencies.|$|E

More specific legislation, with the Data Protection Act 1998 sections 17-19 and the Employment Relations Act 1999 (Blacklists) Regulations 2010, penalises a practice of recording or blacklisting union members, and potentially leads to criminal sanctions for employers and agencies who do so.|$|E

2500|$|On 22 April 2005, the AUT Council {{voted to}} boycott two Israeli universities: the University of Haifa and Bar-Ilan University.

The AUT Council voted to boycott Bar-Ilan because it runs courses at colleges in the occupied West Bank (referring to Ariel College) and [...] "is thus directly involved with the occupation of Palestinian territories contrary to United Nations resolutions". It boycotted Haifa because it was alleged that the university had wrongly disciplined a lecturer. The action against the lecturer was supposedly for supporting a student who wrote about attacks on Palestinians during {{the founding of the}} state of Israel (despite the fact that the student's research had been proved false in court and the University denied having disciplined the lecturer). The boycott, which was not compulsory, was set to last until Haifa [...] "ceases its <b>victimisation</b> of academic staff and students who seek to research and discuss the history of the founding of the state of Israel,".|$|E
2500|$|The Communist Party of India, {{the third}} largest {{political}} force at the time, extended full support to the naval ratings and mobilised the workers in their support, hoping to end British rule through revolution rather than negotiation. The two principal parties of British India, the Congress and the Muslim League, refused to support the ratings. The class content of the mass uprising frightened them and they urged the ratings to surrender. Patel and Jinnah, two representative faces of the communal divide, were united on this issue and Gandhi also condemned the 'Mutineers'. The Communist Party gave a call for a general strike on February 22nd. There was an unprecedented response and over a lakh students and workers {{came out on the}} streets of Calcutta, Karachi and Madras. The workers and students carrying red flags paraded the streets with slogans : 'Accept the demands of the ratings', 'End British and Police zoolum'. Upon surrender, the ratings faced court-martial, imprisonment and <b>victimisation.</b> Even after 1947, the governments of Independent India and Pakistan refused to reinstate them or offer compensation. The only prominent leader from Congress who supported them was Aruna Asaf Ali. Disappointed with the progress of the Congress Party on many issues, Aruna Asaf Ali joined the Communist Party of India(CPI) in the early 1950s.|$|E
2500|$|Harassment and <b>victimisation</b> {{cannot be}} justified, but in {{principle}} {{there are exceptions}} or justifications for all forms of direct and indirect discrimination. Apart from direct age discrimination which can also be objectively justified, the general rule for direct discrimination, elaborated in EA 2010 Schedule 9, is that an employer may only be exempt if it can show that having a worker fit a particular description is a [...] "genuine occupational requirement". This means the (otherwise) discriminatory practice must pursue a legitimate aim {{in terms of the}} nature of the occupation itself (not the employer's business needs generally) and the practice must be proportionate. The test is stringent. In Etam plc v Rowan a man was turned down for a job at a woman's clothing store, with the excuse that a man should not operate women's change rooms. But this did not count as a genuine occupational requirement because the shift allocation could have been easily changed. By contrast, it was held in Wolf v Stadt Frankfurt am Main that a requirement to be under 30 years old when joining the fire service could be a genuine occupational requirement, to ensure fitness. Controversially, the European Court of Justice has repeatedly said that it is within a member state's margin of discretion to say being male is a genuine occupational requirement for work in the military. This was even so, in Sirdar v The Army Board & Secretary of State for Defence, for a lady who applied to work as a chef in the Royal Marines, because the policy on [...] "interoperability" [...] meant every member had to be capable of combat. Cases involving religion are subject to a special provision, so that if a job's functions require adherence to an organisation's ethos, the organisation has an exemption from direct discrimination. In an action for judicial review of the legislation, Richards J rejected that a faith school would be exempt in any way, rather than an actual religious establishment like a church. Even there, it was rejected that a gay person could be dismissed from a job as a cleaner or bookshop worker, if that was incompatible with the religious [...] "ethos", because the ethos would not be a genuine requirement to carry out the job.|$|E

And the recognition carried with it a sense of depression. Would he always remain youthful and keen on gaiety and revelling while she grew staid and retiring? She had thrust the lively intractable Comus out of her mind, as by his perverseness he had thrust himself out of her heart, and she had chosen the brilliant young man of affairs as her husband. He had honestly let her see the selfish side of his character while he was courting her, but she had been prepared to make due sacrifices to the selfishness of a public man who had his career to consider above all other things. Would she also have to make sacrifices to the harlequin spirit which was now revealing itself as an undercurrent in his nature? When one has inured oneself {{to the idea of a}} particular form of <b>victimisation</b> it is disconcerting to be confronted with another.
