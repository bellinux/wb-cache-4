Predictive maintenance requires detailed information on the condition of turbines. Due to the high costs of dedicated condition monitoring systems based on mainly vibration measurements, the use of data from the turbine Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition (SCADA) system is appealing.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the extent of soil contamination within and around the vicinity of an open dumpsite located within Ago-iwoye of Ogun State, Nigeria. The study utilizes the geochemical technique of ICP-MS and quantitative index of contamination degree and factor (Cdeg/Cf) to determine trace element concentration in the soils nearby the dumpsite, and the overall level of geochemical contamination. Seven dumpsite soil samples were analyzed for twenty (24) trace elements such as La, Cr, Ba, Sc, Ti, Se, Ga, Mo, Cu, Pb, Zn, Ag, Ni, Co, Mn, As, U, Au, Th, Sr, Cd, Sb, Bi and <b>V.</b> <b>Assessment</b> of trace element contaminants in the soil samples using the laboratory and quantitative techniques showed that the areas around the vicinity of the dumpsite have been moderately polluted with some heavy metals such as selenium, lead and Zinc.

40|$|A {{framework}} to estimate coastal vulnerability to storm impacts at a regional scale is presented. It assesses the physical coastal vulnerability to storm impacts by separately estimating two components: flooding and erosion. It covers the following steps: (i) {{characterization of the}} forcing, (ii) evaluation of the induced beach response – inundation and erosion – (hazards quantification), (iii) coastal zone characterization, (iv) definition of a coastal vulnerability index to storms – a composite of two partial vulnerability estimations, the flood vulnerability and the erosion vulnerability indices-, and (<b>v)</b> <b>assessment</b> of the coastal vulnerability. Instead of assessing the vulnerability associated with a given storm, the forcing is {{defined in terms of}} representative storms which are obtained by classifying storms in the area using a 5 -class system similar to that used for hurricanes (weak, moderate, significant, severe and extreme). Later, a vulnerability assessment for the entire coast to each storm category is produced. The method has been derived for and applied to the Catalan coast (NW Mediterranean) but can be easily adapted to other coasts. It permits managers to identify 3 coastal stretches sensitive to a given storm class for a given induced hazard (flooding, erosion or combination of both) to decide where to take actions.

40|$|Introduction: This paper reports an {{evaluation}} of the West Midlands Key Skills initiative that provides a framework for learning during vocational training (VT). Method:The 48 vocational dental practitioners (VDPs) who began their VT in August 2001 in the West Midlands were surveyed at the start and end of training (45 completed both surveys). They rated their confidence and experience in the 31 components of the Six Key Skills on visual analogue scales. Views were elicited in a survey of both VDPs (47 returns) and their general practice trainers (44 returns). Semi-structured interviews were also held with a stratified sample of 9 trainers and all four VT advisors. Results: In terms of VDP progress, a statistically significant increase in confidence and experience was found in each of the 31 components. Six themes were identified in the views data.

40|$|Background: Non-contrast CT-based surrogates of {{regional}} ventilation derived from pulmonary images acquired at multiple inflation levels {{have been proposed}} as alternatives to established modalities. However, their physiological accuracy {{has yet to be}} validated prior to clinical translation. Purpose: To address the hypothesis that these surrogates can provide information comparable to a direct measure of ventilation from hyperpolarised gas MRI ventilation via: i. 	development of a methodology for registering CT and gas MRI. ii. 	comparison of these surrogates with gas MRI at the lobar level. iii. 	evaluation of the impact of inflation levels when comparing gas MRI and ventilation CT. iv. 	development of an image acquisition and analysis framework to facilitate spatial correlations of both techniques. <b>v.</b> 	<b>assessment</b> of the effect of using different gases on the correlation. Methods: i. 	A method to indirectly register gas MRI to CT via same-breath 1 H-structural MR images was developed and its accuracy was assessed. ii. 	A ventilation model based on expansion of lobar CT segmentations was compared with gas MRI lobar ventilation measurements. iii. 	The spatial overlap of ventilation CT was compared to gas MRI acquired at two different inflation levels. iv. 	An image acquisition protocol was designed to minimise differences in acquisition settings between scans such as posture and breathing manoeuvre and analysis methods were developed to enable direct regional and voxel level correlations. v. 	The effect of using two different noble gases, namely, 3 He and 129 Xe, on correlation with ventilation CT was assessed. Results: i. 	The indirect method of registration was more accurate than direct registration. ii. 	Despite subtle differences, lobar ventilation measurements derived from CT and hyperpolarised gas MRI were comparable. iii. 	Comparison of ventilation CT and gas MRI varied with inflation state. iv. 	The spatial correlation between ventilation CT and gas MRI increased at coarser levels. v. 	A marked improvement in correlation was observed for 3 He and 129 Xe MRI in contrast to when ventilation CT was compared with either 3 He and 129 Xe MRI. Conclusion: Although CT-based surrogates of ventilation show promise for replacing established ventilation modalities such as hyperpolarised gas MRI, particularly at coarser levels, they cannot be assumed to be equivalent to the techniques they purport to replace. ...|$|E
40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2012. Includes bibliographical references. Wildfire {{management}} in Hawaii {{is complicated by}} the synergistic influences of nonnative invasive grasses and increased human ignitions. The frequent, high severity fires that often result threaten surrounding ecosystems and developed areas. The overarching goal of this research was to improve wildfire {{management in}} guinea grass (Megathyrsus maximus) dominated ecosystems in Hawaii using in situ fuels data collection, fire behavior modeling, remote sensing, and ecological restoration. Specific objectives included: i) quantification of rates of land cover conversion at the grass/forest ecotone from 1950 - 2011; ii) an accurate assessment of the spatial and temporal variability in guinea grass fuels; iii) use of in situ fuels data to parameterize a custom fuel model for guinea grass dominated ecosystems; iv) use of MODIS-based vegetation index data to accurately predict real-time fuel moisture content; and <b>v)</b> <b>assessment</b> of whether native species restoration can simultaneously compete with guinea grass and decrease fire potential. The results of this research provide tools to better predict and manage wildfire. The historical analysis showed that type conversion associated with grass invasion and subsequent fire occurred widely prior to active fire management, and that predicted rates of fire spread are 3 - 5 times higher in grasslands than in forests. Guinea grass total fine fuel loads ranged widely, from 3. 26 to 34. 29 Mg ha- 1, highlighting the importance of real-time, site-specific data for fire management. Field data were used to parameterize a custom fuels model, which better predicted fire behavior than national standard or previous custom fuel models for guinea grass. MODIS-based models better predicted live fuel moisture (R 2 = 0. 46) than the currently used National Fire Danger Rating System (R 2 = 0. 37), providing managers with an improved method for assessing this critical component of fire behavior. Native outplant survival averaged 51 % twenty-seven months after planting, and outplant treatments successfully suppressed guinea grass (P< 0. 001). Predicted fire behavior in outplant and untreated control plots, however, did not differ, likely due to the low moisture content of D. viscosa which dominated the restoration trails. Together, this research provides the foundation for improved fire management in guinea grass ecosystems in Hawaii, and can inform similar work throughout the tropics...|$|E
40|$|Tidal {{meandering}} {{channels are}} ubiquitous features of tidal landscapes {{and play a}} fundamental role on the eco-morphodynamic evolution of these environments. However, {{only a handful of}} papers provide details on tidal meander planimetric shape, morphometric characteristics and morphodynamic evolution, and the internal achitecture of tidal meanders has not been explored in detail. Moreover, the morphodynamic evolution of tidal meanders and the related sedimentary products have often been interpreted {{on the basis of the}} well developed models and theories existing for their fluvial counterparts, despite a number of differences were a priori identifiable. Toward the goal of improving current understanding of the morphodynamic evolution of tidal meanders, five main issues have been investigated in the present work: i) rates of migration and evolutionary dynamics of tidal meanders; ii) assessment and quantification of differences and analogies existing between the planform features of tidal and fluvial meanders; iii) variations of tidal meander hydrodynamics in response to different tidal phases, and the role that these variations exert on tidal meander sedimentary products; iv) role played by bidirectional flows, tidal asymmetries and lateral tributaries; <b>v)</b> <b>assessment</b> of influence of tide amplitude, basin slope and initial shoreline configuration on tidal channel network ontogeny and evolution via laboratory experiment. A multidisciplinary approach has been adopted, with different methodologies encompassing remote sensing techniques, field observations, numerical modelling and physical-laboratory experiments. Activities have been carried out in parallel with sedimentological studies, in order to provide a comprehensive framework. The main results from this work highlighted that: I) once conveniently scaled with channel width, tidal meander migration rates are very similar to those displayed by fluvial meanders, thus challenging the paradigm of tidal meanders as a stable landscape features; II) differences and analogies between tidal and fluvial meander planforms can be addressed in a quantitative way, and different metrics exist thta allow one to successfully quantify these differences; III) strong asymmetries exist between different tidal phases, exerting a crucial role on the depositional patterns of tidal meanders; IV) under certain conditions, lateral tributaries can strongly influence the evolution of bends modifying local mechanisms of flow and sediment distribution; V) tidal channel network features evolve differently in response to different tidal ranges, basin slopes and relative sea level changes, whereas the number of breaches along the initial shoreline seems to have little effect on the evolution of the network itself...|$|E

40|$|Access to {{adequate}} {{water and}} sanitation is fundamental to enhancing {{the quality of life}} for rural populations. Over the past few decades substantial amounts of money have been spent and efforts made to provide rural water supply services in various developing countries. However, the provision of such. services to date is largely unsustainable and it is unlikely that the Millennium Development Goal target for. safe drinking water in rural areas will be met. This is particularly so in sub-Saharan Africa, which has the lowest coverage of water services in the world. The question, therefore, is why, despite all the monies spent and efforts made, is the sustainability of rural water services in low-income countries currently poor, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, and what can be done to improve this situation? The papers on which this research submission is based used selected case studies of countries in sub-Saharan Africa to critically evaluate and assess the key factors contributing to this state of rural water supply services. This was achieved through (i) content analysis of rural water supply policy documents from a range of sub-Saharan African countries; (ii) community sampling, focus group discussions and key informant interviews in several countries; (iii) comprehensive review of management models implemented across the subcontinent; (iv) detailed financial analysis of long-term operational costs for rural water supply systems; (<b>v)</b> <b>assessment</b> of the performance of different rural water supply technologies; (vi) technical analysis of drilling data and water source sustainability; and (vii) analysis of supply chain viability. The policy analysis revealed a range of common themes that may impact on the sustainability of rural water provision, including decentralisation, privatisation and community management. The community sampling, focus group discussions and key informant interviews in several countries showed that communities require more information from implementing agencies, greater choice in relation to technology and management options, and sustained institutional support. A review of management models implemented across the sub-continent identified the need for greater flexibility III management approaches, and the need to explore alternatives based on sustainable incentives, such as indigenous private sector service delivery. Detailed financial 8 [...] . _-~-;_. -~ -. -. ~~ f fI analysis of long-tenn operational costs for rural water supply systems revealed that costings are generally insufficient and communities are not provided with sufficient information on financial implications to make infonned decisions. Technology performance assessments demonstrated that the rope-pump outperfonns the conventional handpump as an appropriate water supply technology for hand-dug wells. It was also demonstrated that the initial measured yield of a borehole is the single largest factor that influences subsequent borehole failure, and that the likelihood of borehole failure increases by a factor of six when drilling occurs during the wet season. Supply chain analysis revealed that stand-alone supply chains for handpump spare parts are commercially unviable in rural sub-Saharan Africa. From the critical evaluation of the outcomes of these studies, it is concluded that in order to achieve truly sustainable rural water supply services greater interconnectedness between technology, environment, supply chains, financing and management is needed within co-ordinated programmes, supported by enabling policies.

40|$|Introduced {{plants can}} {{have a variety of}} impacts in {{ecosystems}} in which they become invasive. These impacts can include the disruption of interactions between native plant and animal species, such as seed dispersal and pollination. Subsequently, other interactions and mutualisms can be affected, both {{at the site of the}} plant invasion and elsewhere. Interactions can also become established between the invasive plant and native and invasive animal species. The removal of an invasive plant has the potential to disrupt these newly formed interactions, thus disadvantaging some fauna and potentially affecting subsequent interactions involving these species. While control of invasive plants is typically a goal of conservation management, the consequences of control for other species are rarely fully considered or investigated. In this study, I have tested several hypotheses regarding the interaction of an invasive plant with fauna, and the effects of the plant’s invasion and control on plant-animal interactions. Bitou Bush (Chrysanthemoides monilifera ssp. rotundata) is an invasive plant in coastal New South Wales (NSW), Australia. South African in origin, it has now spread to occupy at least 80 % of the NSW coastline. Fruit production in C. monilifera is prolific and fruits are consumed and dispersed by vertebrates, especially birds. In addition to other effects of C. monilifera, this plant-animal interaction has the potential to affect the seed dispersal of other vertebratedispersed plants and also the composition of the bird community, which may subsequently affect other plant-bird interactions. In order to quantify the magnitude of these possible effects, I designed this study with the following five major components: (i) comparison of the fruiting characteristics of C. monilifera with those of co-occurring birddispersed native plant species; (ii) description of the plant-bird interactions that involve flowers and fruits in vegetation that has been invaded or is at risk of invasion by C. monilifera; (iii) measurement of the rate of removal of C. monilifera fruits and those of some co-occurring bird-dispersed plant species in: habitat dominated by C. monilifera, where C. monilifera had been eliminated by the application of herbicide, and uninvaded vegetation; (iv) assessment of the effect of C. monilifera removal by herbicide application on the species composition and abundance of the bird community; and (<b>v)</b> <b>assessment</b> of the effect of dominance of the vegetation community by C. monilifera on the species composition and abundance of the bird community. I found that the fruits of C. monilifera are within the range of physical dimensions and nutrient composition of those of co-occurring native species. The greatest distinction in fruit characteristics is in phenology and the combination of phenology and morphology, as peak production of C. monilifera fruits occurs when native fruits are scarce. Consequently, C. monilifera fruits are attractive to vertebrate dispersers, especially birds. At least 25 species of birds feed on C. monilifera fruits in NSW, most of which are indigenous and are likely to disperse viable seeds. In an experimental study using feeding stations, I found that the rate of removal of fruits of native plant species was unaffected by either dense infestation of C. monilifera, or its elimination. This is likely to be due to highly facultative relationships between frugivorous birds and plants, combined with differences in phenology and, in some cases, the morphology of fruits of native plants and C. monilifera. Consequently, in this system there has been little impact of an invasive plant on this plant-bird interaction. The rate of removal of C. monilifera fruits, however, was less in herbicide-treated habitat. This has implications for long-term C. monilifera control, because herbicide treatment often leaves scattered individual plants alive, which would have poorer seed dispersal than plants in dense C. monilifera stands. The removal of C. monilifera affected the bird community, with the overall abundance of birds declining in herbicide-treated areas after the C. monilifera died. Only those birds that consume C. monilifera fruits were affected, while other groups of birds that do not directly use C. monilifera resources were unaffected. Although this impact was minor, it illustrates that removal of an invasive plant can affect bird communities, and these impacts should be considered before control programs are implemented. Dominance of the vegetation by C. monilifera also affected bird communities, with overall bird abundance, specifically that of insectivorous birds, and at some locations nectarivorous birds, being lower in C. monilifera than native habitat. The quantity of remaining native vegetation, particularly of nectar-producing plants widely used by birds, appears to be important in determining bird community composition in invaded areas. In this study, I have demonstrated that both dominance of the vegetation by an invasive plant, and the control of an invasive plant, can induce change in fauna communities, and disrupt some plant-animal interactions. These changes will need to be considered carefully in planning management actions to conserve coastal bird communities and their interactions with plants. While continued efforts to control C. monilifera are clearly justified, these should form part of a broad strategy for coastal community conservation, including consideration of other threats to native communities that act independently or in concert with C. monilifera invasion. These considerations should include the potential impacts of other invasive plant species, targeted sites and species for control efforts, and other forms of habitat loss and degradation...|$|E
