5|$|The Pennsylvania Turnpike {{uses the}} ticket system of tolling between the Warrendale and Neshaminy Falls toll plazas, {{as well as}} on the Northeast Extension to Wyoming Valley. When {{entering}} the turnpike, motorists receive a ticket listing the toll for each exit; the ticket is surrendered when exiting, and the applicable toll is paid. If the ticket is lost, motorists are charged the maximum toll for that exit. Cash, credit cards, and E-ZPass are accepted at traditional toll plazas. An eastbound mainline toll plaza is located at Gateway near the Ohio border, charging a flat toll using cash or E-ZPass, and an all-electronic westbound mainline toll gantry is located at the Delaware River Bridge near the New Jersey border, charging a flat toll using TOLL BY PLATE (which uses automatic license plate recognition to take a photo of the vehicle's license plate and mail a bill to the <b>vehicle</b> <b>owner)</b> or E-ZPass at highway speeds. There is no toll between Gateway and Warrendale and between Neshaminy Falls and the Delaware River Bridge. The PA29 interchange and the westbound Virginia Drive and eastbound Street Road interchanges only accept E-ZPass.|$|E

50|$|The Norwegian Institute of Transport Economics {{conducted}} in March 2016 a survey among over 8,000 <b>vehicle</b> <b>owners</b> in Norway. The study's {{aim was to}} identified how the plug-in vehicles are used, why they are bought and how the technology is rated compared to owners of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. The sample consisted of 3,111 all-electric <b>vehicles</b> (BEV) <b>owners,</b> 2,065 private plug-in hybrid (PHEV) owners, and 3,080 ICE <b>vehicle</b> <b>owners.</b> The study found that buyers of BEVs and PHEVs have different transport needs but both are motivated by economy of use and environment, whereas all-electric <b>vehicle</b> <b>owners</b> are also motivated by the free toll road incentive. The survey showed that normally diesel and gasoline vehicles are replaced with {{the purchase of a}} plug-in vehicle, but a larger share of battery electric vehicles become extra vehicles in households. BEV owners are younger, have more children, travel a longer distance to work and own more vehicles than other <b>vehicle</b> <b>owners.</b>|$|R
25|$|The fee {{for testing}} and {{retesting}} {{is at the}} discretion of the proprietor of the test facility, subject to legal maximum prices.

25|$|Gap {{insurance}} {{covers the}} excess amount on your auto loan in an instance where {{your insurance company}} does not cover the entire loan. Depending on the company's specific policies it {{might or might not}} cover the deductible as well. This coverage is marketed for those who put low down payments, have high interest rates on their loans, and those with 60-month or longer terms. Gap insurance is typically offered by a finance company when the <b>vehicle</b> <b>owner</b> purchases their vehicle, but many auto insurance companies offer this coverage to consumers as well.|$|E
25|$|Battery {{swapping}} {{is common}} in warehouses using electric forklift trucks. The concept of an exchangeable battery service was first proposed as early as 1896, in order to overcome the limited operating range of electric cars and trucks. It was first put into practice between 1910 and 1924, by Hartford Electric Light Company, through the GeVeCo battery service, and was initially available for electric trucks. The <b>vehicle</b> <b>owner</b> purchased the vehicle, without a battery, from General Vehicle Company (GeVeCo), part-owned by General Electric, and the electricity was purchased from Hartford Electric {{through the use of}} an exchangeable battery. Both vehicles and batteries were modified to facilitate a fast battery exchange. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover maintenance and storage of the truck. During the period of the service, the vehicles covered more than 6 million miles.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} {{overcome}} the limited operating range of electric vehicles, {{and the lack of}} recharging infrastructure, an exchangeable battery service was first proposed as early as 1896. The concept was first put into practice by Hartford Electric Light Company through the GeVeCo battery service and initially available for electric trucks. The <b>vehicle</b> <b>owner</b> purchased the vehicle from General Vehicle Company (GVC, a subsidiary of the General Electric Company) without a battery and the electricity was purchased from Hartford Electric through an exchangeable battery. The owner paid a variable per-mile charge and a monthly service fee to cover maintenance and storage of the truck. Both vehicles and batteries were modified to facilitate a fast battery exchange. The service was provided between 1910 and 1924 and during that period covered more than 6 million miles. Beginning in 1917 a similar successful service was operated in Chicago for owners of Milburn Light Electric cars who also could buy the vehicle without the batteries.|$|E
500|$|From the northwest, {{the road}} {{passes through the}} Reedy Creek Mitigation Bank—a conserved area of wetlands—where it crosses a [...] bridge, then makes a turn to the south. South of the bridge, the parkway has grade-separated partial intersections (southbound exits, {{northbound}} entrances) with Marigold Avenue and KOA Street and terminates at an at-grade T-intersection with Cypress Parkway. Electronic-only toll gantries are located between the RCMB bridge and Marigold Avenue and between Marigold Avenue and KOA Street; all tolls are collected using either wireless transponders (SunPass or E-Pass) or using [...] "pay by plate" [...] billing, in which {{a photo of the}} license plate is captured and the <b>vehicle</b> <b>owner</b> is sent a bill by mail for the appropriate toll.|$|E
2500|$|On-board {{diagnostics}} (OBD) is an automotive term {{referring to}} a vehicle's self-diagnostic and reporting capability. OBD systems give the <b>vehicle</b> <b>owner</b> or repair technician access {{to the status of}} the various vehicle subsystems. The amount of diagnostic information available via OBD has varied widely since its introduction in the early 1980s versions of on-board vehicle computers. Early versions of OBD would simply illuminate a malfunction indicator light or [...] "idiot light" [...] if a problem was detected but would not provide any information as {{to the nature of the}} problem. Modern OBD implementations use a standardized digital communications port to provide real-time data in addition to a standardized series of diagnostic trouble codes, or DTCs, which allow one to rapidly identify and remedy malfunctions within the vehicle.|$|E

50|$|Vehicle insurance, in the United States and elsewhere, is {{designed}} to cover risk of financial liability or {{the loss of a}} motor vehicle the owner may face if their vehicle is involved in a collision resulting in property or physical damages. Most states require a motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>owner</b> to carry some minimum level of liability insurance. States that do not require the <b>vehicle</b> <b>owner</b> to carry car insurance include Virginia, where an uninsured motor vehicle fee may be paid to the state; New Hampshire, and Mississippi which offers vehicle owners the option to post cash bonds (see below). The privileges and immunities clause of Article IV of the U.S. Constitution protects the rights of citizens in each respective state when traveling to another. A motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>owner</b> typically pays insurers a monthly fee, often called an insurance premium. The insurance premium a motor <b>vehicle</b> <b>owner</b> pays is usually determined by a variety of factors including the type of covered vehicle, the age and gender of any covered drivers, their driving history, and the location where the vehicle is primarily driven and stored. Credit scores are also taken into consideration. Most insurance companies offer premium discounts based on these factors.|$|E
50|$|California law {{requires}} the tow company to immediately and unconditionally release a vehicle if the driver arrives prior to it being towed {{from the private}} property and in transit.
