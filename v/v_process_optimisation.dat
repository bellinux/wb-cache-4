40|$|The {{objective}} of this master’s thesis is to determine methods for improving a company’s business processes without investing in new technology and whether a relatively small company can benefit from investing in technology. This study determines the meaning of <b>process</b> <b>optimisation</b> and {{how it should be}} conducted. Using existing theory and the case of a logistics company operating in Finland, this research attempts to identify hindrances and find opportunities for the company to develop their <b>processes</b> through <b>process</b> <b>optimisation</b> without technology. Different public bodies in Finland (such as the Finnish government and Statistics Finland) have stated that Finnish logistics requires development and have recommended new technology as a solution to the issue. However, the lack of information on the Finnish logistics business sector makes such statements by public bodies difficult to analyse. <b>Process</b> <b>optimisation</b> has been revealed to be more complex than expected. Many theories available today examine and recommend different technological solutions to execute companies’ work processes. However, a theory is needed on how <b>process</b> <b>optimisation</b> can be carried out at a company lacking technology. <b>Process</b> <b>optimisation</b> consists of <b>process</b> modelling and process analysis. Process modelling appears to be the most significant and crucial aspect of <b>process</b> <b>optimisation.</b> Order-to-delivery <b>processes</b> cannot be optimised within a company if the company does not understand the entirety of such processes. Knowledge of the process has been highlighted as being key to understanding a company’s processes at a high level. The case company in this study showed that <b>process</b> <b>optimisation</b> is possible without implementing new technology; instead, optimisation required additional human capital and a stronger focus on a company’s internal business processes. Technology-based solutions for <b>process</b> <b>optimisation</b> are tempting to implement as doing so may be believed to save time, but no automated solution is able to reveal a company’s critical information if the company does not know what it is looking for and cannot identify its problem areas. This research includes a single case study. The results indicate that whether a relatively small company could benefit from investing in technology is unclear, and the lack of research on <b>process</b> <b>optimisation</b> at Finnish companies resulted in limited findings and analysis. Several different scientific articles presented technology implementation successes and failures, but did not reveal information on the steps taken by the companies...|$|R

40|$|Process {{modelling}} {{refers to}} the development of a process model that serves to provide the input-output relationship of a <b>process,</b> while <b>process</b> <b>optimisation</b> provides the optimum operating conditions of a process for a high-yield, low cost and robust operation. Normally, process modelling is a starting point of <b>process</b> <b>optimisation.</b> In this paper, a method of integrating artificial neural networks with a gradient search method for <b>process</b> modelling and <b>optimisation</b> is presented. Artificial neural networks are used to develop process models while a gradient search method is used in <b>process</b> <b>optimisation.</b> Application of the method to the modelling and optimisation of epoxy dispensing for microchip encapsulation is described.

Employing a cross sectional field study, this exploratory study analyses how key defining features of enterprise systems environment—integration, <b>process</b> <b>optimisation,</b> and best practices—affect agility. Standardisation of processes has mixed effect on agility and depends on the extent of standardisation implemented and whether it included prior simplification. Rather than the ERP-system enabled environment, the inadequacies in implementation and poor <b>process</b> <b>optimisation</b> prior to ERP implementation are restricting process agility...|$|R

40|$|Organisations face many {{challenges}} in their battle {{to survive in}} the current economic climate. A major challenge facing an organisation is the need to change and change rapidly to remain competitive. This imperative to change can be categorised as a key to survival. A major change agent in the current economic climate is the optimisation of resources and business <b>processes.</b> Consequently, <b>optimisation</b> has become an essential part in the strategy for survival. An important prerequisite in achieving optimisation is the elimination of waste and as a result adding value to business processes, products and services companywide. Recent research postulates that to be successful, organisations must implement strategies to boost <b>process</b> <b>optimisation</b> objectives that achieve customer satisfaction and competitiveness. This paper explores and investigates the interrelationship between lean agility implementation and <b>process</b> <b>optimisation</b> decisions. It particularly focuses on the impact of lean application in terms of speed, flexibility, reliability, quality and cost in an attempt to create value to survive and attain customer satisfaction...|$|R

40|$|<b>Process</b> <b>optimisation,</b> the {{generation}} of CO 2 and consumption of energy and water on mining operations are critical issues for mining companies. Most companies have targeted significant improvements in energy, water and CO 2 emission levels over the next 10 years. In order to achieve these targets the design and management of a mining operation should be analysed as an integrated extraction process (‘Geology-Mine-Plant’). In partnership with Anglo Platinum the W H Bryan Mining and Geology research centre and JKtech are developing an integrated <b>process</b> <b>optimisation</b> tool that considers key eco-efficiency attributes. The software tool involves the integration of functionality from JKTech’s JKSimBlast, JKSimMet and JKSimFloat software packages. The Geology-Mine-Plant management tool provides an integrated software and technology system for the optimisation of energy, water and greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, the software provides the optimisation link between a 3 D geometallurgical model and mine evaluation techniques. Ultimately this may change the way mineral deposits are valued and operated. This <b>process</b> <b>optimisation</b> project is aiming at extending the traditional mine to mill model into a holistic analysis of energy consumption and the sustainability footprint on a mining operation. The paper will overview the research project as well as Anglo Platinum’s case study results. Initial site application has demonstrated significant value and the paper will discuss the benefits associated with Geology-Mine-Plant integration and management. Copyright 2009 GECAMIN Ltda...|$|R

The objective of the present paper is to describe <b>process</b> <b>optimisation</b> techniques for the gas metal arc (GMA) welding process, based on experimental results generated by the process. Back-propagation (BP) neural network and multiple regression methods are employed to study relationships between process parameters and top bead height for robotic multipass welding process, and to select a suitable model that provides the weld final configuration and properties as output and employs the process parameters as input. The process parameters, namely pass number, arc current, welding voltage and welding speed are optimised to produce the required top bead height. These techniques have achieved good agreement with the experimental data and yielded satisfactory results. Also, the BP neural network that was developed was compared to the empirical equations for predicting top bead height through additional experiments, and {{it was evident that}} the BP neural network was considerably more accurate than multiple regression techniques...|$|R

40|$|Most of {{the current}} {{attempts}} for business <b>process</b> <b>optimisation</b> are manual without involving any formal automated methodology. This paper proposes a framework for multi-objective <b>optimisation</b> of business <b>process</b> designs. The framework uses a generic business process model that is formally defined and specifies process cost and duration as objective functions. The business process model is programmed and incorporated into a software platform where a selection of multi-objective optimisation algorithms is applied {{to a range of}} test designs including a real example. The test business process designs are of varying complexity and are optimised with three popular optimisation techniques (Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA 2), Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm II (SPEA 2) and Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimisation (MOPSO) algorithms). The results indicate that although business <b>process</b> <b>optimisation</b> is a highly constrained problem with fragmented search space; multi-objective optimisation algorithms such as NSGA 2 and SPEA 2 produce a satisfactory number of alternative optimised business process designs. However, the performance of the optimisation algorithms drops sharply as the complexity of the process designs increases.

Optimisation is achievable through well-defined systems and supporting processes that guide organisations towards excellence.

Effective optimisation impacts strategically on quality cost, revenue, investment, and capabilities. Business Process Capability measurements forces organisational leaders, managers and employees to critically analyse existing business processes, and determine gaps identifying existing performances and sub-optimal states. Many organizations in South Africa misunderstand business process capability and measure success on revenue and profits generated hiding inefficiencies that could be concealed by the profits. One of the contributing factors might be that some companies in South Africa lack international competitiveness, do not optimize their business processes nor align business processes and available resources to adhere to organizational goals and calls for radical redesign of business processes resulting from end-to-end fulfilling internal and external customer needs.
