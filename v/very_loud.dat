5|$|Deep Purple's live {{shows were}} from the start <b>very</b> <b>loud</b> and hard rocking and their stage set {{included}} stacks of custom purple vinyl Marshall amps and fancy dresses. The dualism between Blackmore's flamboyant guitar playing, which he had honed in many years of daily practice and experimented on tour with Sutch, and Lord's rocking Hammond solos was still in an embryonic stage, but it would soon {{become an integral part}} of the band's dynamics.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{residents}} on farming properties {{to the west}} of York heard a large aircraft flying low over the area. The aircraft seemed to be in trouble because the noise from the engines was changing significantly. At times the engines seemed to be operating normally but on at least one occasion all engine noise ceased for a brief time and then returned as a <b>very</b> <b>loud,</b> high-pitched noise. One resident reported that when all engine noise ceased he could hear a rushing sound until the scream from the engines returned. Several residents reported seeing a bright flash of white light in the distance, followed by a loud crashing and scraping noise. Those closest to the crash could then see the yellow glow of a major fire.|$|E

6000|$|How came it {{that all}} of a sudden Mrs. Bingley began to raise her voice and bellow like a bull of Bashan? Whence was it that Bingley, flinging off his apathy, darted about the stage and yelled like Dean? Why did Garbetts and Rowkins and Miss Rouncy try, each of them, the force of their charms or graces, and act and swagger and scowl and spout their <b>very</b> <b>loudest</b> at the two gentlemen in box No. 3? ...|$|R
60|$|Accompanying {{these words}} {{with a gentle}} rap {{on the head of}} the young gentleman before noticed, who, {{unconscious}} of his close vicinity to the person in request, was screaming 'Weller!' with all his might, Sam hastened across the ground, and ran up the steps into the hall. Here, the first object that met his eyes was his beloved father sitting on a bottom stair, with his hat in his hand, shouting out 'Weller!' in his <b>very</b> <b>loudest</b> tone, at half-minute intervals.|$|R
5|$|As the {{aircraft}} flew eastwards over the outer suburbs of Perth numerous witnesses observed {{that it was}} flying at a lower altitude than usual for the daily Skymaster services, {{and at least one}} of the engines was running roughly and backfiring at regular intervals. In the minutes before it crashed, witnesses heard a number of different engine noises â€“ sometimes operating normally, sometimes all engine noise ceased, only to be replaced by a <b>very</b> <b>loud,</b> high-pitched scream. When the wrecked engines were examined many weeks after the accident a significant amount of corrosion product was found in the fuel system within two of the engines. After a preliminary investigation, Investigators from the Department of Civil Aviation believed the water responsible for the corrosion was also responsible for rough running of at least one engine, and ultimately temporary loss of power from all engines on at least one occasion. The Investigators did not find a likely source for the water.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{that of the}} pied currawong, {{the grey}} currawong's call does not sound like its name. It {{is best known for}} making a sound {{variously}} transcribed as p'rink, clink, cling, ker-link or tullock, either in flight or when gathered in any numbers. The call has been described as <b>very</b> <b>loud</b> and ringing in the Tasmanian and Kangaroo Island subspecies; Edwin Ashby wrote that in Tasmania it was akin to the squeaking of a wheelbarrow and Gregory Mathews that it was like the kling of an anvil. Elsewhere, their call has been likened to the screech of ungreased metal grinding in Victoria and South Australia (races versicolor and melanoptera are noted as similar to each other), and as a harsh squeak in Western Australia. The clinking call resembles that of the superb lyrebird, which imitates the currawong call at times.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to other}} mammals, {{primates}} {{in general are}} very vocal, and lemurs are no exception. Some lemur species have extensive vocal repertoires, including the ring-tailed lemur and ruffed lemurs. Some {{of the most common}} calls among lemurs are predator alarm calls. Lemurs not only respond to alarm calls of their own species, but also alarm calls of other species and those of non-predatory birds. The ring-tailed lemur and a few other species have different calls and reactions to specific types of predators. With mating calls, {{it has been shown that}} mouse lemurs that cannot be discerned visually respond more strongly to the calls of their own species, particularly when exposed to the calls of other mouse lemurs that they would encounter normally within their home range. Lemur calls can also be <b>very</b> <b>loud</b> and carry long distances. Ruffed lemurs use several loud calls that can be heard up to 1km (0.62mi) away on a clear, calm day. The loudest lemur is the indri, whose calls can be heard up to 2km (1.2mi) or more and thus communicate more effectively the territorial boundaries over its 34 to 40hectares (0.13 to 0.15sq mi) home range. Both ruffed lemurs and the indri exhibit contagious calling, where one individual or group starts a loud call and others within the area join in. The song of the indri can last 45seconds to more than 3minutes and tends to coordinate to form a stable duet comparable to that of gibbons.|$|E

6000|$|As they proceeded, {{the professors}} of music {{composed}} marches, {{and when one}} was finished, they gave the manuscript to the Head-man, who, commanding silence, blew the tune on his horn, and then the whole army struck up and played it grandly. Of these, the [...] "Giant's Grand March" [...] was the best. It was {{what might be called}} good, loud music. If it had thundered, it is not likely {{that it would have been}} heard in the grand final burst, when all the drums and trumpets beat and blew their <b>very</b> <b>loudest.</b>|$|R

6000|$|A {{leader of}} a party is nothing without an organ, and an organ came forward to support Mr. Bonteen,--not very creditable {{to him as a}} Liberal, being a Conservative organ,--but not the less gratifying to his spirit, inasmuch as the organ not only {{supported}} him, but exerted its <b>very</b> <b>loudest</b> pipes in abusing the man whom of all men he hated the most. The People's Banner was the organ, and Mr. Quintus Slide was, of course, the organist. The following was one of the tunes he played, and was supposed by himself to be a second thunderbolt, and probably a conclusively crushing missile. This thunderbolt fell on Monday, the 3rd of May:-- ...|$|R

60|$|I had no money, as I said, and {{was sitting}} very disconsolately over {{a platter of}} rancid bacon and mouldy biscuit, which was served to us at mess, {{when it came to}} my turn to be helped to drink, and I was served, like the rest, with a dirty tin noggin, {{containing}} somewhat more than half a pint of rum-and-water. The beaker was so greasy and filthy that I could not help turning round to the messman and saying, 'Fellow, get me a glass!' At which all the wretches round about me burst into a roar of laughter, the <b>very</b> <b>loudest</b> among them being, of course, Mr. Toole. 'Get the gentleman a towel for his hands, and serve him a basin of turtle-soup,' roared the monster, who was sitting, or rather squatting, on the deck opposite me; and as he spoke he suddenly seized my beaker of grog and emptied it, in the midst of another burst of applause.|$|R

50|$|The jez kernei is 1-2 m long {{longitudinal}} trumpet with/without a mouthpiece. Faucet diameter is 20 cm. The {{similarity between}} the jez kernei and the Uzbek and Uigur karnai is accounted by the territorial nearness of South Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan.

25|$|The biggest {{downside}} to the 200B was the noise the driver {{would have to}} endure. The 2-litre overhead cam engine could be <b>very</b> <b>loud</b> when pushed up through the rev range, and {{to make matters worse}} there was always plenty of drive line vibration. These issues prompted an exhaustive correction programme to be undertaken by the parent company in Japan, and thankfully later models were somewhat improved.|$|E

25|$|In January 2012, after {{strong winds}} caused <b>very</b> <b>loud</b> humming, the architect, who {{lives at the}} top of the building, apologised.

As of 2015, the noise issue still remains, and the building now has its own parody accounts on Twitter, 'Angry Beetham' and 'Happy Beetham', who each claim responsibility when the howling begins. The humming noise occurred again during Storm Doris in February 2017.|$|E

She was a pretty weak woman in body and mind about that time. But from the moment I told her, {{and she knew that}} you not only loved her, but were willing to say so, she began to mend. And how she did talk about you, and how she did long that the two ships might come together again! She kept asking me what I thought about the condition of your vessel and whether {{it would be like to}} sink if a storm came on. I could not help thinking that, as far as I knew anything about ships, you'd be likely to float for weeks after we'd gone down, but I didn't say that to her. And then she began to wonder if you had understood that she had received your message and was glad to get it. And I told her over and over and over again that you must have heard me, for I screamed my <b>very</b> <b>loudest.</b> I am <b>very</b> glad that I didn't know that you only caught those two words." ...|$|R
