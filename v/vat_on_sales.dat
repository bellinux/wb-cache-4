50|$|VAT is {{the largest}} source of federal revenue (32 percent in 2008). VAT on imports (13 percent of federal revenue) is 18 percent (10 percent on {{selected}} foodstuffs) prior to release from the customs warehouse. VAT on domestic goods is calculated as the difference of <b>VAT</b> <b>on</b> <b>sales</b> (at the earliest of cash receipt or shipment of goods on credit) and input VAT on accrued costs.|$|E

Sales of books have been continuously decreasing from 2008 due to increasing rates of VAT on books in this study. The theoretical part is focused on VAT, consumer behavior on the market of books and influence of substitution effect and income effect on demand of books. It has been found out only a slight price increase of books by comparing the prices of books {{before and after the}} VAT increase. Econometric analysis of sales of Czech and Slovak bookshops did not confirm the impact of <b>VAT</b> <b>on</b> <b>sales</b> of bookshops. The bookshop sales are influenced by a number of other aspects, particularly GDP...|$|E
40|$|In {{almost all}} {{countries}} that operate a value-added tax (VAT), the VAT “zero-rates ” exports, meaning that exporting firms can claim credit for VAT on their inputs, but pay no <b>VAT</b> <b>on</b> <b>sales</b> of exports. This is necessary when {{the goal is}} to make the base of the tax domestic consumption. A consequence is that firms can reduce their tax burdens by misreporting some of their sales to domestic consumers as exports. In principle, reported exports from country i to country j should match up with reported imports into country j from country i, except for measurement errors, and costs of insurance and freight that are included in import value but not export value. VAT evasion can be another source of discrepancy which would tend to cause reported exports to exceed reported imports for trade flows in the same direction. We use data on such discrepancies in trade flows between pairs of European Union member countries during 1984 through 2011 to infer whether higher VAT rates are associated with greater over-reporting of exports. A difference-in-differences identification strategy, exploiting the fact that VAT rates changed in different ways over time in different countries, suggests that each percentage point increase in the exporting country’s standard VAT rate increases the discrepancy of exports over imports by about 1. 1 percent of exports. For the typical EU- 15 country, this implies that at the margin, about 15 percent of the static revenue gain from a VAT rate increase would be lost due to this particular channel for VAT evasion...|$|E

5000|$|The {{mechanism}} for achieving {{this result is}} as follows. The exporting member state zero-rates the VAT. This means that the member state of the exporting merchant does not collect <b>VAT</b> <b>on</b> the <b>sale,</b> but still gives the exporting merchant a credit for the <b>VAT</b> paid <b>on</b> the purchase by the exporter (in practice this often means a cash refund). The importing member state [...] "reverse charges" [...] the VAT. This means that the importer is required to pay VAT to the importing member state at its rate. In many cases a credit is immediately given for this as input VAT. The importer then charges <b>VAT</b> <b>on</b> resale in the normal way.|$|R

As with the other nations, <b>VAT</b> raised <b>on</b> <b>sales</b> will be collected by the Government. Retailers can choose how the money raised from bag sales is used. The Government is however planning on publishing information yearly on the scheme, encouraging retailers to donate the proceeds to charities.|$|R
50|$|Following changes {{introduced}} on 1 July 2003, non-EU businesses providing digital {{electronic commerce}} and entertainment {{products and services}} to EU countries are also required to register with the tax authorities in the relevant EU member state, and to collect <b>VAT</b> <b>on</b> their <b>sales</b> at the appropriate rate, according {{to the location of}} the purchaser. Alternatively, under a special scheme, non-EU and non-digital-goods businesses may register and account for <b>VAT</b> <b>on</b> only one EU member state. This produces distortions as the rate of VAT is that of the member state of registration, not where the customer is located, and an alternative approach is therefore under negotiation, whereby VAT is charged at the rate of the member state where the purchaser is located.|$|R

5000|$|Missing trader fraud (also called {{missing trader}} intra-community, MTIC, or {{carousel}} fraud) is {{the theft of}} Value Added Tax (VAT) from a government by organised crime gangs who exploit the way VAT is treated within multi-jurisdictional trading where the movement of goods between jurisdictions is VAT-free. This allows the fraudster (person who commits fraud) to charge <b>VAT</b> <b>on</b> the <b>sale</b> of goods, and then instead of paying this over to the government's collection authority, to simply abscond, taking the VAT with him.

40|$|A {{perspective}} on the externalities of road usage in South Africa is discussed. The road system and road users are causing enormous positive externalities to society. These include access to economic activities, health services, education, retail facilities, and recreation. Road users pay a variety of taxes and levies to the state, such as <b>VAT</b> <b>on</b> vehicle <b>sales,</b> <b>VAT</b> <b>on</b> vehicle part sales/car repair services, import duties on vehicles/parts, and fines. A report for Cape Town reveals that the two major routes in the city, N 1 and N 2, experience heavy congestion every weekday, which could equal 50 % of all congestion in the city. A recent report on congestion costs for Canada reveals that more than 90 % of this cost is time lost in traffic by drivers and passengers, 7 % is attributable to increased fuel consumption and 3 % is attributable to green house gas emissions under congested conditions. The positive external value of the road network {{is estimated to be}} in excess of R 150 billion per annum and by far exceeds the negative externalities. Revie...|$|R
50|$|Under EU rules, {{there can}} only be two reduced VAT rates from the general minimum VAT of 15% (both of which have to be above a minimum of 5%). As of 2008, there were reduced VAT rates of 12% for yard sale wine and 10% for food, rent, books, works of art and flowers; should the <b>VAT</b> <b>on</b> food be reduced to 5%, the reduced <b>VAT</b> <b>on</b> yard <b>sale</b> wine would either have to be {{abolished}} or reduced further to 10%, according to some; however, a reduction to 10% is impossible as the minimum VAT for yard sale wine is 12%, which is itself an exemption from the general rule banning VAT reductions for alcoholic beverages. The SPÖ argued that the reduced VAT rate for yard sale wine was a special exemption agreed upon in the Act of Accession and did therefore not qualify as the second reduced VAT rate; the ÖVP-led finance ministry claimed that this exemption had been converted into Austria's official second reduced VAT rate since the accession, and this was confirmed on 8 September 2008 by the spokeswoman of the European Commission.|$|R
5000|$|All {{businesses}} that provide [...] "taxable" [...] {{goods and services}} and whose taxable turnover exceeds the threshold must register for VAT. The threshold was £77,000 since April 2012, and as of 2016 it is £83,000, by far the highest VAT registration threshold in the world. Businesses may choose to register even if their turnover is less than that amount. All registered businesses must charge <b>VAT</b> <b>on</b> the full <b>sale</b> price of the goods or services that they provide unless exempted or outside the VAT system. The default VAT rate is the standard rate, currently 20%. Some goods and services are charged lower rates (reduced or zero).|$|R
50|$|This {{conspirator}} then {{sells the}} goods {{to a third}} conspirator for £1,200,000, charging <b>VAT</b> <b>on</b> that <b>sale.</b> The third conspirator pays £1,440,000 to the second. This may continue for many conspirators; however, three will suffice for an example.The third trader now sells the telephones to a German company, which may well be innocent. No <b>VAT</b> is charged <b>on</b> the export, and the sales price of £1,500,000 is paid by the German company without VAT.So far the conspirators have made a profit of £500,000 perfectly legitimately on buying and selling mobile telephones.In an honest operation, the first trader would pay £220,000 to HM Revenue and Customs (the UK's VAT collection agency).The second trade has collected £240,000 in VAT but paid £220,000 in VAT and therefore has to pay only the difference (£20,000) to HM Revenue and Customs.The third trader has charged no tax <b>on</b> its <b>sale</b> but has paid £240,000 in VAT and can therefore reclaim £240,000 from HM Revenue and Customs.In the fraud, the first business vanishes without paying the VAT to HM Revenue and Customs. When the last business in the chain collects £240,000 on the export, all of the businesses can vanish, £220,000 better off {{at the expense of}} HM Revenue and Customs. As this business is removed from the vanishing party, it is difficult for HM Revenue and Customs to show the links in the chain and thereby refuse to refund the <b>VAT</b> <b>on</b> the export.|$|R

2500|$|By {{the method}} of [...] collection, VAT can be accounts-based or invoice-based. Under the invoice method of collection, each seller charges <b>VAT</b> rate <b>on</b> his output and passes the buyer a special invoice that {{indicates}} the amount of tax charged. Buyers who are subject to <b>VAT</b> <b>on</b> their own <b>sales</b> (output tax), consider the tax on the purchase invoices as input tax and can deduct the sum from their own VAT liability. The difference between output tax and input tax is paid to the government (or a refund is claimed, {{in the case of}} negative liability). Under the accounts based method, no such specific invoices are used. Instead, the tax is calculated on the value added, measured as a difference between revenues and allowable purchases. Most countries today use the invoice method, the only exception being Japan, which uses the accounts method.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{economic}} implications of disruptions {{of one to}} ninety days to the supply of natural gas in Ireland. We {{assess the impact of}} a hypothetical gas supply disruption in both winter and summer in 2008 (with observed market characteristics) and in 2020 (with projected market characteristics). The cost of a natural gas outage includes the cost of natural gas being unavailable for heating and other purposes in the industrial and commercial sectors, lost consumer surplus in the residential sector, the cost of lost electricity in all sectors and lost <b>VAT</b> <b>on</b> the <b>sale</b> of gas and electricity. Ireland generates much of its electricity from natural gas and the loss of this electricity accounts {{for the majority of the}} cost of a natural gas outage. Losing gas-fired electricity would cost 0. 1 – 1. 0 billion euro per day, depending on the time to the week, the time of year and rationing. Industry should be rationed before households to minimise economic losses, but current emergency protocols do the opposite. If gas-fired electricity is unavailable for three months, the economic loss could be up to 80 billion euro, about half of Gross Domestic Product. Losing gas for heating too would add up to approximately 8 billion euro in economic losses. We also discuss some options to increase Ireland’s security of supply, and find that the cost is a small fraction of the avoided maximum damage...|$|R
