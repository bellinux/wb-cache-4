50|$|Ambient modal identification, {{also known}} as Operational Modal Analysis (OMA), aims at {{identifying}} the modal properties of a structure based on <b>vibration</b> <b>data</b> collected when the structure is under its operating conditions, i.e., no initial excitation or known artificial excitation. The modal properties of a structure include primarily the natural frequencies, damping ratios and mode shapes. In an ambient vibration test the subject structure can be {{under a variety of}} excitation sources which are not measured but are assumed to be 'broadband random'. The latter is a notion that one needs to apply when developing an ambient identification method. The specific assumptions vary from one method to another. Regardless of the method used, however, proper modal identification requires that the spectral characteristics of the measured response reflect the properties of the modes rather than those of the excitation.|$|E

30|$|To {{develop the}} approach, {{the first step}} was to collect {{multiple}} sets of data and perform experiments.

One month of leak data was collected via acoustic noise loggers and analyzed to form the acoustic leak database.

50|$|The {{operating}} principle {{is based on}} the Doppler effect, which occurs when light is back-scattered from a vibrating surface. Both velocity and displacement can be determined by analyzing the optical signals in different ways. A scanning laser vibrometer integrates computer-controlled X,Y scanning mirrors and a video camera inside an optical head. The laser is scanned point-by-point over the test object’s surface to provide a large number of very high spatial resolution measurements. This sequentially measured <b>vibration</b> <b>data</b> can be used to calculate and visualize animated deflection shapes in the relevant frequency bands from frequency domain analysis. Alternatively, data can be acquired in the time domain to, for example, generate animations showing wave propagation across structures. In contrast to contact measuring methods, the test object is unaffected by the vibration measuring process. Today, vibrometry covers a huge range of applications such as the study of microstructures moving only a few pm at frequencies up to 30 MHz, {{all the way up to}} the intense dynamics occurring in Formula 1 engines with vibration velocities approaching 30 m/s.|$|E
