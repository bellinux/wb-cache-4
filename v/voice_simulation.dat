40|$|Voice {{production}} all the {{way from}} muscle activation to sound - are we there yet? Three-dimensional (3 D) numerical simulations of the entire process of voice generation appear to be very challenging. Muscle activations position the articulators, which define a vocal tract geometry and posture the vocal folds. Air emanating from the lungs induces self-oscillations of the vocal folds, which result in aeroacoustic sources and the subsequent propagation of acoustic waves inside the vocal tract (VT). There, many things could happen. For instance, the air could resonate to generate vowels, or, at constrictions, airflow may be accelerated to create turbulent sounds such as fricatives. The vocal tract walls are flexible and react to the inner acoustic pressure. Also, articulators can change the vocal tract geometry to generate vowel-vowel utterances or syllables. Sound is finally radiated from the mouth. Attempting unified 3 D numerical simulations of all the above processes, which involve coupling of a biomechanical model and the mechanical, fluid and acoustic fields, may seem unwise. Most research to date has addressed a few selected aspects of voice production. Unified approaches have been shunned for their daunting complexity and high-performance parallel computation requirements. This situation now seems to be changing. In this paper, we briefly review recent approaches towards 3 D realistic <b>voice</b> <b>simulation</b> that unify, at least to some extent, some of the involved physical fields. Remaining challenges will be highlighted. We will focus on those works which end with the production of a given sound, thus leaving aside the huge amount of literature solely devoted to the complex simulation of phonation.

Five studies aimed to change professionals' attitudes and responses by using <b>voice</b> <b>simulation</b> experiences and demonstrated positive outcomes such as increased positive attitudes. In general there was a scarcity of literature on the topic. No studies included carers or used a model to investigate the field therefore the present study addressed this. Research Report. Objectives: Part 1. To investigate pertinent issues when discussing the content of voices with people who hear voices. Part 2. To find out what predicts Intention to discuss the content and meaning of voices. Design: Part 1. Interview study with carers and health and social care staff. Part 2. A cross-sectional questionnaire study with carers and health and social care staff. Methods: Part 1. Interviews were conducted with 3 carers and 10 staff who care for people who hear voices. These were based upon a Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) framework and assessed 1) advantages/disadvantages; 2) barriers/facilitators; 3) those who approve/disapprove and 4) feelings when discussing the content of voices. The interviews were categorised into the most frequently occurring issues in relation to each of the four areas. Part 2 : A TPB questionnaire was constructed based upon the categories identified from the interviews in part 1. This was completed by 142 carers and health and social care staff. Results: A hierarchical multiple regression analysis found the TPB was able to significantly predict Intention to discuss the content of voices. No other variables added significantly to the model of prediction. The final model accounted for 58. 8 % of variance in Intention. Conclusions: The TPB is an effective model in predicting Intention to discuss the content of voices. Intervention studies targeting the issues highlighted could be used to increase Intentions to discuss the content of voices with people who hear voices.

Mobile nodes such personal digital assistants (PDAs), notebooks and cell phones are nowadays used in human’s daily life. MANETs are networks consisting of two or more mobile nodes equipped with wireless communication and networking capabilities, but they don’t have any network centrilized infrastructure. In last few years, MANETs have been emerged to be an important researched subject in the field of wireless networking. MANETs are autonomous; however they can communicate with other external networks such the internet. They are linked to such external networks by mobile nodes acting as gateways. This kind of networks is known as hybrid MANETs. Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), is a technology that allows you to make voice calls using a Internet connection instead of a regular (or analog) phone line. The goal of this thesis is evaluate the performance of VoIP strategies for hybrid MANETs. Two different aspects are evaluated, the session establishment performance and the voice quality.

We propose and analyze a novel reservation arbitrated (RA) access method which provides isochronous voice transport over dual-bus MAN's while enabling statistical multiplexing among voice calls. In combination with a new cyclic capturing (CC) mechanism, RA access allows stations to capture and reserve isochronous voice channels in a fair and distributive manner.

40|$|To date, {{although}} much {{attention has been}} paid to the estimation and modeling of the voice source (ie, the glottal airflow volume velocity), the measurement and characterization of the supraglottal pressure wave have been much less studied. Some previous results have unveiled that the supraglottal pressure wave has some spectral resonances similar to those of the voice pressure wave. This makes the supraglottal wave partially intelligible. Although the explanation for such effect seems to be clearly related to the reflected pressure wave traveling upstream along the vocal tract, the influence that nonlinear source-filter interaction has on it is not as clear. This article provides an insight into this issue by comparing the acoustic analyses of measured and simulated supraglottal and <b>voice</b> waves. <b>Simulations</b> have been performed using a high-dimensional discrete vocal fold model. Results of such comparative analysis indicate that spectral resonances in the supraglottal wave are mainly caused by the regressive pressure wave that travels upstream along the vocal tract and not by source-tract interaction. On the contrary and according to simulation results, source-tract interaction has a role in the loss of intelligibility that happens in the supraglottal wave with respect to the voice wave. This loss of intelligibility mainly corresponds to spectral differences for frequencies above 1500 Hz...|$|R

40|$|The current {{programme}} {{of research}} had two main aims. First, {{in response to}} a gap in the literature on implicit measures in the context of psychosis, the current thesis sought to determine the utility of the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) in this regard (N= 309). We opted to focus specifically on the IRAP because of the level of concept precision it has demonstrated previously in the context of depression, cocaine dependence and OCD. Second, we used the IRAP as a step toward bringing a broad, functional approach to understanding psychosis, by focusing on the specific phenomenon of voice hearing. On this path, we created a taxonomy of the critical features of voice hearing as identified in the literature (i. e. stigma, locus of control, evaluations of voices, normality of voices, acceptance of self and other people hearing voices, fear of voices, valence and acceptance of voices). It was our hope that outcomes in this regard might lead us one step closer to a functional analytic understanding of the psychological nature of the experience of hearing voices. The experimental designs and analytic strategies adopted in Experiments 1 - 3 were identical. All three studies involved control (non-voice hearing) participants completing one IRAP each. The six IRAPs employed across the studies had broadly similar trial-types that juxtaposed positive versus negative evaluations of various aspects of psychological suffering. Participants subsequently completed a battery of explicit measures which assessed psychological well-being and stigma. Experiment 1 investigated the broad stigmatisation of psychological suffering using three IRAPs (n= 36 undergraduate students), namely a Depression IRAP, an Anxiety IRAP and a Mental Illness IRAP. Participants were assigned into one of the three IRAPs, in which they were required to relate suffering-as-positive and suffering-as-negative on alternative trial blocks. Overall, the three IRAPs in Experiment 1 produced similar patterns of responding, which, surprisingly, indicated that all three forms of suffering (i. e. depression, anxiety and mental illness) were implicitly evaluated as both positive and negative. Similarly, all three IRAPs also showed significant pro-normality effects, although an anti-normality effect was recorded on the Mental Illness IRAP. The correlations revealed that IRAP trial-types predicted some aspects of explicit. For example, positivity toward depression correlated with low anxiety and low stigma, while negativity correlated with stigma. Positivity toward normality also correlated with high distress. And pro-normality effects in the context of anxiety correlated with overall distress. Overall, these correlations suggested that psychological distress impacts upon implicit evaluations to suffering and normality, and thus, may influence stigmatisation. Experiment 2 investigated the locus of control in psychological suffering versus illness (n= 40). We developed two IRAPs, namely an Illness IRAP and a Weakness IRAP, to investigate internal versus external locus of control. Participants were assigned into one of the two IRAPs, in which they were required to relate suffering-as-positive and suffering-as-negative on alternative trial blocks. Both IRAPs produced similar patterns of responding, in which suffering (as illness or weakness) was evaluated as both positive and negative. Significantly strong positivity toward health was also recorded. The correlations revealed that positivity toward health correlated with high stigma on the Illness IRAP and high distress and stigma on the Weakness IRAP, on which negativity toward weakness also correlated with low distress. Experiment 3 investigated stigmatisation of hearing voices by a non-voice hearing student population using a simple Evaluation IRAP (n= 29). On the IRAP, participants were required to relate voices-as-positive and voices-as-negative on alternative trial blocks. Overall, hearing voices was positively evaluated. Surprisingly, implicit positivity toward voice hearing correlated with high stigma, but again negativity correlated with high distress. Experiment 4 investigated potential changes in implicit stigmatisation or fear of hearing voices in non-voice hearing student participants subjected to a hearing <b>voices</b> <b>simulation</b> and a Fear IRAP (N= 28). On the IRAP, participants were required to relate voices-as-positive and voices-as-negative on alternative trial blocks. Subsequently, participants were exposed to a hearing <b>voices</b> <b>simulation</b> procedure, prior to completing the IRAP for a second time. Participants subsequently completed a battery of explicit measures. At baseline and post-simulation, hearing voices was implicitly evaluated as both positive and fearful, although positivity toward voices reduced and fear increased after the simulation. Experiment 5 investigated implicit evaluations of non-clinical voice hearers’ and non-voice hearing control participants (all from a student population) using the Normality IRAP (n= 36). On the IRAP, participants were required to relate voices-as-normal and voices-as-abnormal on alternative trial blocks. Participants subsequently completed a battery of explicit measures. Both non-clinical voice hearers and controls implicitly evaluated voice hearing as normal, and most importantly this effect was stronger for the voice hearers. Evaluations of voice hearing as normal correlated with behavioural engagement with voices as well as voice acceptance, while evaluations of voice hearing as abnormal correlated with high voice benevolence and high emotional engagement with voices and other psychotic-like experiences. Experiment 6 investigated the potential stigma of non-voice hearing participants and non-clinical voice hearers (all from a student population) toward voices as heard by the self (i. e. “If I heard voices”) and others (i. e. “If Other People heard voices”), and presented these two groups with a Self IRAP and an Others IRAP (n= 48). Participants were assigned into one of the two IRAPs, in which they were required to relate voices-as-positive and voices-as-negative on alternative trial blocks. Participants subsequently completed a battery of explicit measures. Overall, hearing voices was evaluated positively by both groups on both IRAPs, although control participants were more positive on the Self IRAP. Interestingly, control participants were also more fearful on the Self IRAP, while the voice hearers were more fearful on the Others IRAP. Furthermore, voice hearers who were less positive on the Self IRAP correlated with high depressive psychotic-like symptoms and those who were fearful on the Others IRAP correlated with low voice acceptance. Experiment 7 attempted to explore implicit evaluations by using a more broadly fear-based IRAP, and most notably by now including our first recruitment of clinical voice hearers (n= 37). Clinical voice hearers were recruited from a psychiatric facility and the non-clinical voice hearers and non-voice hearing controls were recruited from a student population. On the IRAP, participants were required to relate voices-as-positive and voices-as-negative on alternative trial blocks. Participants subsequently completed a battery of explicit measures. As expected, controls and non-clinical voice hearers showed implicit positivity and only marginal fear on the IRAP. But, most interestingly, the clinical voice hearers were much less positive in this regard. The correlations also showed that implicit fear correlated with higher voice severity. Once again, these effects supported those we had observed previously, but critically showed that the clinical voice hearers were implicitly less positive than the other two groups. Experiment 8 sought to further explore the potentially different reactions of clinical and non-clinical groups to voices, and in doing so we attempted to parse out emotional versus behavioural responses (n= 55). In a Valence IRAP, participants were required to relate voices-as-positive and voices-as-negative on alternative trial blocks, and an Acceptance IRAP required to relate avoidance and acceptance of positive and negative voices on alternative trial blocks. Clinical voice hearers were recruited from a psychiatric facility and the non-clinical voice hearers and non-voice hearing controls were recruited from a student population. Participants subsequently completed a battery of explicit measures. As expected, controls evaluated voice hearing positively on the Valence IRAP, but for the first time, non-clinical voice hearers showed implicit negativity, and we had now recorded for the second time, negativity by the clinical voice hearers. Clinical and non-clinical voice hearers implicitly accepted positive voices and avoided negative voices. Furthermore, acceptance of positive voices correlated with high psychological inflexibility, and acceptance of negative voices correlated with overall voice acceptance. This study provided the level of psychological precision that we had been working towards using the IRAP throughout the thesis. The refinements and the systematic manipulations of the IRAP have led us steadily from simple assessments of valence by control participants to distinguishing between the different types of reactions that different groups of voice hearers might have toward different types of voices, which largely coincides with the psychosis literature and thus suggests the validity of the IRAP within this domain...|$|R
