40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we analyse how <b>vertical</b> <b>industry</b> {{linkages}} may work as channels for ex-ternalities. We test for activity based externalities stemming from output growth and output level in vertically linked industries. Moreover, by comparing results on localised inter-industry externalities {{as well as}} significance of local sales linkages, we try to reveal the strength of self-reinforcing ag-glomeration forces. A number of Norwegian maritime transport and services sectors are analysed. The results are promising {{in the sense that}} the model allows us to distinguish empirically between different sources of externalities, and unveils the extent to which <b>vertical</b> <b>industry</b> linkages give rise to self-reinforcing agglomeration.

The solution called for by the healthcare industry involves the continuous development and diffusion of healthcare industry vertical standards to enable seamless electronic integration. Our proposed research project is an exploratory case study which will address the following research question: What are the processes taking place as the Canadian healthcare industry develops and diffuses <b>vertical</b> <b>industry</b> standards to achieve interoperability and integration? By taking a socio-technical perspective to answering this question, we will further research on standards development and diffusion enabling us to assist in the development of relevant guidelines to serve the practitioner community in developing and diffusing <b>vertical</b> <b>industry</b> standards...|$|E

40|$|Wireless {{industry}} nowadays {{is facing}} two major challenges: 1) how {{to support the}} <b>vertical</b> <b>industry</b> applications so that to expand the wireless industry market and 2) how to further enhance device capability and user experience. In this paper, we propose a technology framework to address these challenges. The proposed technology framework is based on end-to-end vertical and horizontal slicing, where vertical slicing enables <b>vertical</b> <b>industry</b> and services and horizontal slicing improves system capacity and user experience. The technology development on vertical slicing has already started in late 4 G and early 5 G and is mostly focused on slicing the core network. We envision this trend {{to continue with the}} development of vertical slicing in the radio access network and the air interface. Moving beyond vertical slicing, we propose to horizontally slice the computation and communication resources to form virtual computation platforms for solving the network capacity scaling problem and enhancing device capability and user experience. In this paper, we explain the concept of vertical and horizontal slicing and illustrate the slicing techniques in the air interface, the radio access network, the core network and the computation platform. This paper aims to initiate the discussion on the long-range technology roadmap and spur development on the solutions for E 2 E network slicing in 5 G and beyond...|$|E
