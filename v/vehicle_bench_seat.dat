50|$|In 1944, {{the last}} <b>vehicles</b> with {{longitudinal}} <b>bench</b> <b>seats</b> entered service. These five four-axle motor tramcars and six four-axle trailer cars {{were also the}} last vehicles to be procured by the SSB. The motor tramcars were unusual, in that on one side there were modern air-operated folding doors, {{but on the other}} side only basic sliding doors were provided.|$|R
50|$|Each seated car had 50 {{reclining}} {{seats in}} a 2+1 configuration across the aisle, with room for luggage underneath. Each sleeper car had 20 beds, split over 10 cabins (two per cabin). All cabins had an en-suite toilet and basinette, while six cabins had an en-suite shower. The beds could be folded {{into the wall}} to provide seating. The service <b>vehicle</b> had <b>bench</b> style <b>seating</b> for 15 passengers in a lounge area, a catering area, large luggage area and staff accommodation in the centre, and a large cabin with two beds, designed to be accessible to wheel chair users, at the other end. The seated area would have been coupled to the seated cars and the cabin end to the sleeper cars.|$|R
5000|$|Booster seats - The earlier {{described}} combination seat {{can become}} a high back belt positioning booster. There is also a high back belt positioning booster that is available for that purpose only. The other type of belt positioning booster is the low back or no back booster. The major differences between the low and high back booster seats are head support and improved protection in side-impact collisions. <b>Vehicles</b> with a <b>bench</b> <b>seating</b> and no headrest are required to use a high back booster. The purpose of the booster seats is to provide elevation to the child so the shoulder belt rests appropriately on the shoulder blade and does not ride up the child’s neck. It also provides “hips” that the seat belt can rest securely across and remain on the large bones of the child instead of resting across the soft tissue of the abdomen. This seat is available for children over 40 lb up to over 100 lb. From the ages of eight to twelve, children may have outgrown their booster seats and can be permitted to use regular adult seat restraints. It is suggested that, {{until the age of}} thirteen, the child remains in the back seat.|$|R

To this day, the Falcon Ute is still offered with a <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> and column {{shift in the}} front and {{availability}} of a front <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> in the Falcon sedan and wagon lineups was only discontinued with the introduction of the FG Falcon in 2008. Holden offered a <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> on the Commodore in the 1990s, originating with the VG Ute and ending with the end of VS series III production in 2000.|$|R

Seat width is 440 mm per person for the three-person <b>bench</b> <b>seats</b> in five-door cars and 450 mm per person for the ten-person <b>bench</b> <b>seats</b> in three-door cars. As with the 9050 series EMUs introduced around the same time, these sets featured LCD passenger information screens above the doorways, but these were subsequently removed.|$|R

5000|$|The front <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> {{typically}} allowed {{three people}} to sit abreast, or six passengers in most four-door sedans {{with this type}} of arrangement.

[...] In 1972, the Jeep Commando's center console for the automatic transmission was replaced with a steering column mounted shifter, [...] "making the much-requested <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> an option." [...] The [...] " [...] innovative but unusual [...] " [...] 1975 AMC Pacer introduced numerous designs that included the [...] "cab forward" [...] and [...] "room for three upfront on the bench seat." ...|$|R

50|$|The {{interior}} configuration broadly {{followed that}} of the 326 initially. In later models the individual front seats were replaced by a single <b>bench</b> <b>seat,</b> and available seating space was further increased by the deletion of the central arm rest from the rear <b>bench</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|R

50|$|The <b>bench</b> <b>seat</b> was the {{traditional}} seat installed in American and Australian automobiles. This seat featured a continuous pad running the full {{width of the}} cabin.
