50|$|Vacuum nozzles are {{commonly}} used for handling all the components during the placement operations. There {{are a variety of}} <b>vacuum</b> <b>nozzle</b> sizes for different component sizes. For handling small components, positive pressure is often supplied in addition to vacuum at the moment of placement so that the component would be completely release from the nozzle.|$|E
50|$|A {{system under}} the JBC brand uses {{extractor}} shields that concentrates heat where {{it needs to}} be, protect surrounding components and avoids damage to the board or the QFP. The system {{takes advantage of the}} properties of solder by melting it with hot air. The extractor has a spring system that gently pulls the IC upward when the liquid stage of solder has been reached. The IC is held by a <b>vacuum</b> <b>nozzle</b> similar to the ones used in pick & place machines. This system prevents damage to the pads on the PCB, the IC, avoids overheating surrounding components and blowing them off and also removes the risk of having operator errors by using tweezers or other tools that damage the PCB or IC.|$|E

A pair of tweezers-type grippers would hold the part while centering it along one axis.

In addition, extra space is required between the components to accommodate the grippers.|$|R
50|$|KSLV-2 {{uses the}} KARI 75 ton force engine and KARI 7 ton force engine. All those engines use rocket-grade {{kerosene}} (RP-1) as its fuel and liquid oxygen(LOX) as its oxidizer. The first stage uses four 75 ton force engines, generating nearly 300t of thrust. Second stage uses one 75 ton force engine, {{which uses a}} wider nozzle for efficiency in vacuum. Third stage uses one 7 ton force engine. The 75 ton force engine's specific impulse is 298.1s, the <b>vacuum</b> <b>nozzle</b> specific impulse is 315.4s. The 7 ton force engine's specific impulse is 325.1s. Further improvements will be added after the success of KSLV-2 program, such as replacing the current engine configurations into 85 or 95 ton force and increasing specific impulse. The 75 ton force engine {{is designed to be}} reused, just like the Merlin 1D engine. This engine can be reused after being recovered, which lowers costs and improves efficiency of the launch program.|$|E
50|$|Overhead gantry-style {{positioning}} system's placement head {{is mounted}} on a gantry beam (X-axis). During the sequence, the beam moves perpendicular to {{the direction of the}} placement head movement, which offers two degrees of freedom (X and Y alignment) in a plane parallel to the machine table. The PCB and feeders keep stationary during placement. The PCB is located on the table by identifying global and local fiducials through a vision system. This placement head moves along the axis beams to pick components from a feeder, and then moves into position to place the components. A <b>vacuum</b> <b>nozzle</b> on the placement head moves up and down vertically to provide Z-axis and rotates in the horizontal plane to provide theta angular alignment. Sometimes a secondary vision system is also applied to check the correctness and alignment of the components after pick-up and before placement.As the PCB and feeders remain stationary in the placement sequence, the additional sources of positional inaccuracy are eliminated. Overhead gantry-style machine has the best placement accuracy among all types and is utilized by flexible placers exclusively. It offers greater flexibility and accuracy, but cannot match the speeds of other styles. Machines with multiple gantries can achieve faster speed.|$|E
50|$|Wash {{water can}} be used to further improve the quality of the ice by {{removing}} debris and snow from deep skate-blade cuts. Located {{directly in front of the}} blade, nozzles forcefully spray water into the ice surface, loosening deep debris. Runners on either side of the conditioner contain the spray, while a rubber squeegee at the rear of the conditioner allows a <b>vacuum</b> <b>nozzle</b> to pick up excess water. This water is then filtered through a screen and recirculated. Finally, a layer of water is laid down to fill in the remaining grooves in the ice. The ice-making water is released through a sprinkler pipe at the rear of the conditioner, which wets the cloth towel that is dragged behind the resurfacer. The towel ensures a smooth, controlled deposition of water. Hot water is frequently used because it slightly melts the layer of ice below it, forming a stronger bond when frozen, and because heating the water drives off dissolved gases. This limits chipping and cracking, providing a more enjoyable skating surface. The water used in many rinks is also filtered and treated before being heated to remove any minerals or chemicals in the water. These impurities can otherwise make the ice brittle, soft, give it undesirable odors, or change the color and clarity.|$|E

50|$|Stationary turret {{system has}} a {{relatively}} higher speed {{due to a}} series of identical heads rotating on a single turret. The feeder moves in the X direction to a fixed pickup location. As many as 36 <b>vacuum</b> <b>nozzles</b> {{around the perimeter of the}} rotating turret provide Z and theta alignment. Turret rotates multiple heads between pickup and placement locations. The PCB moves in X and Y direction under the rotating heads, pausing beneath the correct placement location. Comparing to a gantry head, the simultaneous movements of feeders and PCBs greatly improve the average placement rate. Because passive components do not demand a great placement accuracy, it is exclusively applied in chip shooters. Stationary turret system has a limitation of requiring large footprint for the moving feeder bank (footprint =2*total feeder length). The possibility of dislodging components due to the moving board mechanism is another limitation.|$|R

40|$|The need to aerodynamically remove {{isolated}} {{charged particles}} 50 to 500 micrometers {{in size from}} a bed comprised of numerous smaller 10 - 15 micrometers size charged particles is identified. To facilitate accurate prediction for successful particle removal, a new analytical method is presented for determining the magnitude and location of the aerodynamic drag force acting on a spherical particle in a boundary layer flow. Wind tunnel experiments are conducted on spheres of 2 to 2. 5 cm diameter in turbulent boundary layer flow for sphere Reynolds numbers {{on the order of}} 10, 000. The experiments measure the drag force on the sphere and the flow velocity profile at the point of incipient motion of the sphere. The test, results obtained in the wind tunnel experiment compare favorably to predictions of the analytical method presented. This method is extended to analyze the onset of incipient motion for the 50 to 500 micrometers agglomerate particles subject to the drag forces induced by a <b>vacuum</b> <b>nozzle</b> and the adhesion forces caused by electrostatic charge on the particles. The analysis is modeled in an interactive computer program. The effects of air velocity, particle size, charge and shape, and the ratio of lift to drag forces on the threshold of predicted particle removal are determined and discussed. Additional experiments involving the <b>vacuum</b> <b>nozzle</b> applied to particles in eight different size classes ranging from 15 to 500 micrometers are conducted. Difficulties in controlling the charge level of the particles required that uncharged particles be tested. Experimental results based on observed weight percentage removal of the particles for the eight different size classes compare favorably to removal likelihood as predicted by the analysis...|$|E

40|$|At the National Ignition Facility (NIF) at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), {{mitigation}} {{of laser}} surface damage growth on fused silica using single and multiple CO{sub 2 } laser pulses {{has been consistently}} successful for damage sites whose lateral dimensions are less than 100 {micro}m, but has not been for larger sites. Cracks would often radiate outward from the damage when a CO{sub 2 } pulse {{was applied to the}} larger sites. An investigation was conducted to mitigate large surface damage sites using galvanometer scanning of a tightly focused CO{sub 2 } laser spot over an area encompassing the laser damage. It was thought that by initially scanning the CO{sub 2 } spot outside the damage site, radiating crack propagation would be inhibited. Scan patterns were typically inward moving spirals starting at radii somewhat larger than that of the damage site. The duration of the mitigation spiral pattern was {approx} 110 ms during which a total of {approx} 1. 3 J of energy was delivered to the sample. The CO{sub 2 } laser spot had a 1 /e{sup 2 }-diameter of {approx} 200 {micro}m. Thus, there was general heating of a large area around the damage site while rapid evaporation occurred locally at the laser spot position in the spiral. A 30 to 40 {micro}m deep crater was typically generated by this spiral with a diameter of {approx} 600 {micro}m. The spiral would be repeated until {{there was no evidence of}} the original damage in microscope images. Using this technique, damage sites as large as 300 mm in size did not display new damage after mitigation when exposed to fluences exceeding 22 J/cm{sup 2 } at 355 nm, 7. 5 ns. It was found necessary to use a <b>vacuum</b> <b>nozzle</b> during the mitigation process to reduce the amount of re-deposited fused silica.

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} use of {{heuristic}} algorithms {{in a number of}} combinatorial problems that occur in various resource constrained environments. Such problems occur, for example, in manufacturing, where a restricted number of resources (tools, machines, feeder slots) are needed to perform some operations. Many of these problems turn out to be computationally intractable, and heuristic algorithms are used to provide efficient, yet sub-optimal solutions. The main goal of the present study is to build upon existing methods to create new heuristics that provide improved solutions for some of these problems. All of these problems occur in practice, and one of the motivations of our study was the request for improvements from industrial sources. We approach three different resource constrained problems. The first is the tool switching and loading problem, and occurs especially in the assembly of printed circuit boards. This problem has to be solved when an efficient, yet small primary storage is used to access resources (tools) from a less efficient (but unlimited) secondary storage area. We study various forms of the problem and provide improved heuristics for its solution. Second, the nozzle assignment problem is concerned with selecting a suitable set of <b>vacuum</b> <b>nozzles</b> for the arms of a robotic assembly machine. It turns out that this is a specialized formulation of the MINMAX resource allocation formulation of the apportionment problem and it can be solved efficiently and optimally. We construct an exact algorithm specialized for the nozzle selection and provide a proof of its optimality. Third, the problem of feeder assignment and component tape construction occurs when electronic components are inserted and certain component types cause tape movement delays that can significantly impact the efficiency of printed circuit board assembly. Here, careful selection of component slots in the feeder improves the tape movement speed. We provide a formal proof that this problem is of the same complexity as the turnpike problem (a well studied geometric optimization problem), and provide a heuristic algorithm for this problem...|$|R

40|$|This master thesis was {{conducted}} during the fall of 2012 at Electrolux {{with the purpose of}} developing a <b>vacuum</b> cleaner <b>nozzle</b> with lights. Several nozzles with an integrated lighting system {{can be found on the}} market today. However, most of these nozzles are provided with power through cords from the vacuum cleaner body which results in the nozzle only being compatible with specially designed vacuum cleaners. This project aimed at developing an ordinary <b>vacuum</b> cleaner <b>nozzle</b> with lights, being compatible with regular vacuum cleaners. The development was performed by doing modifications to an already existing <b>vacuum</b> cleaner <b>nozzle.</b> The overall method applied during this master thesis was based on an in-house process which is used at Electrolux where the progress is divided into four phases. Each phase ends with a presentation for a project steering committee consisting of experts from Electrolux with a profound interest in the project. The project began with a pre study where existing products and patents were investigated. Furthermore all wishes and constraints of the product were compiled into a list of design specifications. The product development was broken down into three sub problems; how to supply the lights with electricity, how to activate and deactivate the lights and how to integrate the lights to the nozzle. To generate as many ideas as possible regarding the three sub problems, semi-structured interviews and a brainstorming session were conducted together with employees at Electrolux. The most interesting ideas were further developed as concepts and the best solutions to each sub problem were eventually chosen together with the project steering committee. The final solution had four LED lights positioned on top of the nozzle and these were powered by two serial connected AAA batteries. The lights were activated and deactivated automatically when the vacuum cleaner was turned on an off. However, the final method used for activating and deactivating the lights is not further explained in this report due to business strategic reasons of Electrolux. Experiments were conducted to choose the components of the suggested solution. To boost the output voltage in order to receive a stable illumination some electronics were connected to the components. The suggested nozzle did fulfill all constraints stated in the product design specificationsDetta examensarbete utfördes under hösten 2012 på Electrolux med syftet att utveckla ett dammsugarmunstycke med lampor. Idag finns en rad dammsugarmunstycken med integrerade lampor på marknaden, men de flesta av dessa munstycken får ström genom sladdar dragna från själva dammsugaren vilket medför att munstyckena endast är kompatibla med specialdesignade dammsugare. Detta arbete syftade till att utveckla ett vanligt dammsugarmunstycke med lampor som kan användas till de flesta dammsugare och är fristående från resterande delar. Utvecklingen gjordes genom att modifiera ett redan existerande dammsugarmunstycke. Den övergripande metoden som använts under detta examensarbete baserades på en intern process som används på Electrolux där arbetet delas in i fyra faser. Vardera fasen avslutas med en presentation för en styrgrupp bestående av experter från Electrolux med ett intresse för projektet. Arbetet inleddes med en förstudie där existerande produkter och patent studerades. Vidare sammanställdes alla krav och önskemål angående produkten till en kravspecifikation. Produktutvecklingen delades in i tre delproblem; drivning av lamporna, integrering av lamporna i munstycket samt aktivering och avaktivering av lamporna. För att generera så många idéer som möjligt angående de tre delproblemen utfördes semistrukturerade intervjuer samt en brainstormingsession tillsammans med anställda på Electrolux. De mest intressanta lösningarna vidareutvecklades till koncept varpå den bäst lämpade lösningen för varje delproblem valdes ut tillsammans med styrgruppen. Den slutliga lösningen hade fyra LED-lampor placerade ovanpå munstycket vilka drevs av två AAA-batterier. Lamporna aktiverades samt avaktiverades automatiskt i samband med att dammsugaren sattes på respektive stängdes av.

40|$|Pressure {{distributions}} {{and erosion}} patterns on simulated lunar surfaces (hard and soft) and interference effects between {{the surface and}} two representative lunar vehicles (cylindrical and spherical) were obtained with cold-air jets at various descent heights and nozzle total-pressure ratios up to 288, 000. Surface pressure distributions were dependent on both nozzle area ratio and, nozzle contour. Peak pressures obtained with a sonic nozzle agreed closely with those predicted theoretically for a near-sonic jet expanding into a <b>vacuum.</b> Short bell-shaped <b>nozzles</b> gave annular pressure distributions; the low center pressure resulted from the coalescence of shocks that originated within the nozzle. The high surface pressures were contained within a circle whose diameter was about 16 throat diameters, regardless of nozzle area ratio or contour. The peak pressure increased rapidly as the vehicle approached the surface; for example, at a descent height of 40 throat diameters the peak pressure was 0. 4 percent of the chamber pressure, but increased to 6 percent at 13 throat diameters. The exhaust jet eroded a circular concave hole in white sand at descent heights from about 200 to 600 throat diameters. The hole diameter was about 225 throat diameters, while the depth was approximately 60 throat diameters. The sand particles, which formed a conical sheet at a semivertex angle of 50 deg, appeared to follow a ballistic trajectory and at no time struck the vehicle.

40|$|An {{integrated}} {{cryogenic liquid}} oxygen, liquid methane (LOX/LCH 4) reaction control system (RCS) was tested at NASA Glenn Research Center's Plum Brook Station in the Spacecraft Propulsion Research Facility (B- 2) under vacuum and thermal vacuum conditions. The RCS is a subsystem of the Integrated Cryogenic Propulsion Test Article (ICPTA), a pressure-fed LOX/LCH 4 propulsion system {{composed of a}} single 2, 800 lbf main engine, two 28 lbf RCS engines, and two 7 lbf RCS engines. Propellants are stored in four 48 inch diameter 5083 aluminum tanks that feed both the main engine and RCS engines in parallel. Helium stored cryogenically in a composite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV) flows through a heat exchanger on the main engine before being used to pressurize the propellant tanks to a design operating pressure of 325 psi. The ICPTA is capable of simultaneous main engine and RCS operation. The RCS engines utilize a coil-on-plug (COP) ignition system designed for operation in a vacuum environment, eliminating corona discharge issues associated with a high voltage lead. There are two RCS pods on the ICPTA, with two engines on each pod. One of these two engines is a heritage flight engine from Project Morpheus. Its sea level nozzle was removed and replaced by an 85 : 1 nozzle machined using Inconel 718, resulting in a maximum thrust of 28 lbf under altitude conditions. The other engine is a scaled down version of the 28 lbf engine, designed to match the core and overall mixture ratios {{as well as other}} injector characteristics. This engine can produce a maximum thrust of 7 lbf with an 85 : 1 nozzle that was additively manufactured using Inconel 718. Both engines are film-cooled and capable of limited duration gas-gas and gas-liquid operation, as well as steady-state liquid-liquid operation. Each pod contains one of each version, such that two engines of the same thrust level can be fired as a couple on opposite pods. The RCS feed system is composed of symmetrical 3 / 8 inch lines that tap off of the main propellant manifold to send LOX and LCH 4 outboard to the RCS pods. A Thermodynamic Vent System (TVS) is used to condition propellants at each pod by venting through an orifice and then routing the cold expansion products back through tubing that is welded along {{a large portion of the}} main RCS feed lines. Prior to final installation on the ICPTA, the RCS engines were tested in a small vacuum chamber at the Johnson Space Center (JSC) Energy Systems Test Area (ESTA) to verify functionality of the new COP ignition system and check out operation of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>nozzles.</b> After engine-level testing, the RCS engines were installed on the vehicle and a series of integrated hot-fire tests were performed at JSC consisting of various pulsing and steady-state firings as well as integrated main engine/RCS operation. The ICPTA was then integrated into the Plum Brook B- 2 facility for vacuum and thermal/vacuum testing. Testing in the B- 2 facility was composed of multiple thermal and pressure environments. The first set of tests were performed under ambient temperature and altitude pressure conditions. These tests consisted of a range of minimum impulse bit (MIB) pulsing sequences with low duty cycle, analogous to a coast phase in which the RCS is primarily used for station keeping. The primary goal of this sequence is to understand how propellant conditions were effected without an active TVS. In this scenario, consistent gas-gas operation is desirable since it results in a smaller MIB and more efficient propellant consumption. Multiple skin thermocouples are mounted on the feedlines, in addition to a submerged thermocouple on each commodity, in order to gather thermal data on the system. Higher duty cycle pulsing tests were then performed, analogous to an ascent or landing mission phase. The primary goal of this sequence was to examine how well the engines self-conditioned without active TVS when starting from a quiescent state. The TVS was then activated during some tests to demonstrate the capability to quickly condition the engines for higher pulsing demand scenarios. A thermocouple at the TVS outlet allows for the calculation of energy absorbed by the vented propellant. Lastly, tests with longer pulses and multiple engines firing either in sequence or simultaneously were run in order to gather transient system response data on waterhammer. Six total high-speed pressure transducers are installed on the RCS system, one sensor at the end of each propellant manifold line on the pods, and one at the tap-off location for each commodity. This will allow for the accurate characterization of waterhammer in the system under various propellant conditions and firing sequences. Other instrumentation for this test series includes nozzle throat thermocouples, chamber pressure measurement, heat soakback measurement, and tank wall plume impingement temperature measurement. The next set of tests were performed to demonstrate simultaneous main engine and RCS operation. Data from this test will be used to examine if there is any change to nominal operation of the RCS as a result of feed system interaction or other phenomenon. Some of these tests began under high vacuum conditions (target ambient pressure less than 1 x 10 (exp - 3) torr) and others began at altitude conditions. The last set of tests were performed with the B- 2 cold wall active. Under these tests, many of the same low duty cycle MIB tests were repeated in order to characterize how propellant conditions changed with the lower heat leak. In this scenario the RCS manifold experiences much less heat leak, resulting in a change to how well the engines self-condition. As a result, an increase in maximum waterhammer pressures and a change in natural frequency of the system was expected due to higher density propellants. The lower heat leak should also result in a change to the MIB pulse profile, and data will be examined to understand how MIB repeatability is affected in the different operating environments. Parallel to the test efforts, a set of transient model development efforts were made to predict RCS performance. The primary effort was aimed at producing a SINDA/FLUINT model to predict propellant conditioning up to the engine inlet as a function of different environmental and operating parameters, with the goal of predicting chamber pressure, TVS performance, and propellant consumption over time. Preliminary results for this effort will be presented in comparison with test data. Additional modeling efforts were made using SINDA/FLUINT to predict waterhammer in the system since the software is capable of handling multiphase transient fluid dynamics. These results will be compared with the high-speed pressure transducer test data for validation purposes...|$|R
