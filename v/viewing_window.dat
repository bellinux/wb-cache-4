5|$|Holographic weapon sights {{are similar}} in layout to {{reflector}} sights but do not use a projected reticle system. Instead, a representative reticle is recorded in three-dimensional space onto holographic film {{at the time of}} manufacture. This image is part of the optical <b>viewing</b> <b>window.</b> The recorded hologram is illuminated by a collimated laser built into the sight. The sight can be adjusted for range and windage by simply tilting or pivoting the optical window.|$|E

25|$|Bird World, {{opened in}} 1975, {{features}} open aviaries in which guests can mingle with exotic birds such as Egyptian plovers, rhinoceros hornbills, and crested oropendolas and even two-toed sloths. Each area features naturalistic habitats and replicated tropic and aquatic ecosystems, with three major exhibits built without barriers so the birds can fly freely among zoo visitors. At the Bird World kitchen <b>viewing</b> <b>window,</b> visitors can see firsthand what the birds eat. There are four outdoor exhibits directly {{attached to the}} exterior of Bird World which are home to African penguins, Steller's sea eagles, kea and double-wattled cassowaries.|$|E
500|$|They then built a six-foot (1.8m) {{wind tunnel}} in their shop and between October and December 1901 {{conducted}} systematic tests {{on dozens of}} miniature wings [...] The [...] "balances" [...] they devised and mounted inside the tunnel to hold the wings looked crude, made of bicycle spokes and scrap metal, but were [...] "as critical to the ultimate success of the Wright brothers as were the gliders." [...] The devices allowed the brothers to balance lift against drag and accurately calculate the performance of each wing. They could also see which wings worked well as they looked through the <b>viewing</b> <b>window</b> {{in the top of}} the tunnel. The tests yielded a trove of valuable data never before known and showed that the poor lift of the 1900 and 1901 gliders was entirely due to an incorrect Smeaton value, and that Lilienthal's published data were fairly accurate for the tests he had done.|$|E

2500|$|This exhibit {{opened in}} 2003, {{as a major}} {{renovation}} of the former [...] "Whittier Southeast Asian Exhibits", which had opened in 1982. It houses four Sumatran orangutans with one Bornean orangutan (who is now gone) and siamangs in an [...] exhibit, which is flanked by a [...] glass <b>viewing</b> <b>window.</b> The exhibit provides sway poles and artificial trees for the primates to swing on and a fake termite mound for them to fish condiments out of. The viewing area is designed to resemble the mulch-lined exhibit side of the <b>viewing</b> <b>window</b> by having rubber mulch and miniature sway poles for kids. Some plant species in the exhibit are toog trees, carrotwood trees, and markhamia trees.|$|E

2500|$|Tiger River, {{located in}} a sloping canyon, opened in 1988 and houses Malayan tigers. From {{the top of the}} canyon, the path first goes through a {{pavilion}} with underwater viewing of crocodilians and other aquatic reptiles. It proceeds to another pavilion, this time flanked by the Marsh Aviary, with white-collared kingfishers and storks, and a fishing cat exhibit. Farther down the canyon are a Malayan tapir exhibit and the [...] tiger habitat, which has a hillside stream, waterfall, and glass <b>viewing</b> <b>window.</b>|$|E
2500|$|This [...] habitat, replicating an Indo-Pacific reef {{landscape}} (living corals are exhibited {{elsewhere in}} the National Aquarium), {{can be seen from}} many vantage points, including a new floor-to-ceiling pop-out <b>viewing</b> <b>window.</b> It contains 65–70 species, mostly fish (including blacktip reef sharks). One of the largest animals in the exhibit is Calypso, a 500-pound green sea turtle that was rescued off the shore of Long Island in 2000. Her left front flipper had become infected and required amputation in order to save her life. Calypso was introduced into Blacktip Reef in July 2013.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2001, the Sea Lion and Penguin Shores opened. [...] California sea lions, Scuttles, Keel and Kipper {{were moved}} {{across from the}} old sea lion pool while six little blue {{penguins}} took up residence in an adjacent exhibit within the complex. The sea lion pool is a filtered salt water tank with a circulating supply. [...] It was designed to recreate a New Zealand Coastal ecosystem and cost $5 million to construct. It features an underwater <b>viewing</b> <b>window</b> and is over three times as deep as the old sea lion pool, built in the 1930s. [...] In 2002, Auckland Zoo temporarily hosted female sea lions, Rosey and Cody from Marineland. They returned in 2003.|$|E

2500|$|Once {{the train}} has safely exited the mid-course brake run the train goes {{downhill}} into an underground tunnel. This underground tunnel houses the ride's [...] "triple down", where the train goes down three separate hills in complete darkness, picking up considerable speed in the process. After exiting the tunnel, the train races toward the station while staying {{to the left}} of the track on the outbound hills. This portion goes under the supporting steel for the first three hills, creating multiple headchopper effects, once again crossing under Thunderbird. The train then takes a right turn, crossing under the outbound track, before making a left turn and crossing under the outbound track again. At this point the train goes sideways again in the final 90° banked to the right. Once the train exits the banked turn it passes under the lift hill and takes a turn to the left. The ride's on-ride camera is located on the left side of the track near this turn. After the train passes the on-ride camera it goes uphill and over the base of the lift hill before making a diving right turn into an underground tunnel. This underground tunnel goes under the entrance and exit walkways to the ride; it is also located right next to the basement queues, where there is a <b>viewing</b> <b>window</b> where waiting guests can watch the train fly by. After exiting the tunnel the train makes a climbing right turn before quickly shifting to a diving left turn that takes riders into an underground tunnel under the Thanksgiving midway. Then, after exiting the tunnel, the train makes a climbing, sweeping turn to the right. Once the train exits the turn, it immediately enters the brake run to end the ride. If there is a train occupying the secondary brake run the train will wait in the primary brake run until it is clear. If it is clear, the train will continue on to the secondary brake run. If there are two trains operating, the train will wait in the secondary brake run until the second train has left the station. If not, the train will continue directly into the station at which point riders will unload.|$|E
