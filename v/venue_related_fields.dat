40|$|A {{number of}} rankings of Computer Science Conferences and Journals exist (e. g., CORE [1]), how-ever issues exist with these rankings, {{such as they}} are ageing rapidly, they are not {{actively}} updated, and {{there are differences in}} their methodologies and resulting rankings making them difficult to compare. A recent addition to the resources available to researchers evaluating the impact of their publications is Google Scholar Metrics [2]. With this tool we can probe the impact of different publication venues (Conferences and Journals) according to citations using their five year h-index (h 5 -index) and five year h-median (h 5 -median). We present an analysis of different publication <b>venues</b> across the <b>related</b> <b>fields</b> of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Natural Computing amongst others [3], based upon Google Scholar Metrics and journal impact factors. A positive correlation is found between the h 5 -index (2007 - 2011) and impact factors (2010), and an overall ranking of the different venues finds that a number of top conferences in these fields have h 5 -index values equivalent, and in some cases superior to, the fields leading journals. Based on our analysis it is clear that publication in the top conference venues is of great importance in these fields, having similar impact to publication in journals. In times of multi-disciplinary research conveying this message (i. e., the relative importance of conference publication) to colleagues in other disciplines can be a challenge, and hopefully studies such as this will help to convey this message.

40|$|Many {{scientific}} fields {{share common}} interests {{for research and}} education. Yet, very often, these fields do not communicate {{to each other and}} are unaware of the work in other fields. Understanding the commonalities and differences among <b>related</b> <b>fields</b> can broaden our understanding of the interested phenomena from various perspectives, better utilize resources, enhance collaboration, and eventually move the <b>related</b> <b>fields</b> forward together. In this article, we present a conceptual framework, namely the Information-Model or I-model, to describe various aspects of information <b>related</b> <b>fields.</b> We consider this a timely effort in light of the evolutions of several information <b>related</b> <b>fields</b> and a set of questions related to the identities of these fields. It is especially timely in defining the newly formed Information Field from a community of twenty some information schools. We posit that the information <b>related</b> <b>fields</b> are built on a number of other fields but with their own unique foci and concerns. That is, core components from other fundamental fields interact and integrate with each other to form dynamic and interesting information <b>related</b> <b>fields</b> that all have to do with information, technology, people, and organization/society. The conceptual framework can have a number of uses. Besides providing a unified view of these <b>related</b> <b>fields,</b> {{it can be used to}} examine old case studies, recent research projects, educational programs and curricula concerns, as well as to illustrate the commonalities and differences with the information <b>related</b> <b>fields...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract We {{present an}} {{extension}} of field analysis (see [4]) called re-lated field analysis which is a general technique for proving relationships between two or more fields of an object. We demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of <b>related</b> <b>field</b> analysis by applying it {{to the problem of}} removing ar-ray bounds checks. For array bounds check removal, we define a pair of <b>related</b> <b>fields</b> to be an integer field and an arrayfield for which the integer field has a known relationship to the length of the array. This <b>related</b> <b>field</b> information canthen be used to remove array bounds checks from accesses to the array field. Our results show that <b>related</b> <b>field</b> analysiscan remove an average of 50 % of the dynamic array bounds checks {{on a wide range of}} applications. We describe the implementation of <b>related</b> <b>field</b> analysis in the Swift optimizing compiler for Java, as well as the op-timizations that exploit the results of <b>related</b> <b>field</b> analysis. 1 Introduction Modern programming languages like Java are becomingpopular because they provide features like type safety, portability, object-oriented type dispatch, and automatic memorymanagement which improve programmer productivity, reduce bugs, and improve security. These features, however,often add additional run-time overhead to a program which would not be required of an equivalent C or C++ program. In order to improve the feasibility of these modern languages for high-performance programming, compiler optimizationsmust remove as much of this run-time overhead as possible. This paper concentrates on removing the overhead of arraybounds checks using a novel technique called <b>related</b> <b>field</b> analysis...|$|R
