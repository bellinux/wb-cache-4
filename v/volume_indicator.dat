It is intentionally a [...] "slow" [...] measurement, averaging out peaks and troughs of short duration to reflect the perceived loudness of the material. It was originally invented in 1939 by the combined effort of Bell Labs and broadcasters CBS and NBC for measuring and standardizing the levels of telephone lines. The instrument used to measure VU is called the <b>volume</b> <b>indicator</b> (VI) instrument. Most users ignore this {{and call it a}} VU meter.|$|E

5000|$|For {{the large}} {{majority}} of compressed elements, it is possible to limit the reduction of the working stress to 25% by taking into account elastic instability, providing that the designer focuses on ensuring an efficient geometric design from as early as the initial sketches. This means that the increase in their <b>volume</b> <b>indicator</b> can also be limited to 25% [...] The volume of the elements subject to pure traction is also only very rarely limited to the product of the net distance over which a force is applied by a section strained at the permissible stress. In other words, their real <b>volume</b> <b>indicator</b> is thus also higher than the one which results from the calculation of W. A bar under traction can be welded at its extremities; no extra material apart from the negligible welding material is added, but the rigidity introduce parasitic moments which absorb some of the permissible stress.|$|E

5000|$|It is, nevertheless, {{possible}} {{to overcome this}} problem by setting each factor to unity: while all other characteristics remain the same. Length L is therefore set to 1m, H to H/L, E and σ to 1Pa, and F to 1N.This [...] "reduced" [...] structure has a volume of material W= σV/ FL (the <b>volume</b> <b>indicator)</b> and a maximum deformation Δ = Eδ / σL (the displacement indicator). Their main characteristic {{is that they are}} numbers without physical dimensions (dimensionless) and their value, for every morphology considered, depends only on the ratio L/H, i.e. the geometric slenderness ratio of the form.|$|E
50|$|The {{anchoring}} of the extremities {{of a bar}} under traction {{can also}} be ensured by adherence, as is usually {{the case for the}} rebars in elements made of reinforced concrete. In this specific case, it is necessary to have an anchoring length at least 30 times the diameter of the bar. The bar then has a length L + 60H for a useful length L; its theoretical <b>volume</b> <b>indicator</b> W = 1 becomes W = 1 + 60H/L. Consequently, L/H must be greater than 240 (which is always theoretically possible) so that W does not increase by more than 25%. This observation also helps to show another reason for taking into account n bars with a crosssection Ω/n instead of one bar with a cross-section Ω.|$|E
5000|$|VU defined:The {{reading of}} the <b>volume</b> <b>indicator</b> shall be 0 VU when it is {{connected}} to an AC voltage equal to 1.228 Volts RMS across a 600 ohm resistance (equal to +4 dBu) at 1000 cycles per second.Note: The reference above is generally true now and was always true in the recording industry. However in some North American broadcast installations up {{until late in the}} 20th century, the Reference level ("0VU") was +8dBm at large studio installations and some used 150 ohm impedance throughout the studio.(CFRB Toronto and CFPL London Canada) This was yet another [...] "standard" [...] established {{in the early years of}} audio and the VU meter was altered by changing the series resistors to adjust its sensitivity. This had no effect on the ballistics.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} radical {{economic}} reform envisages {{the introduction of}} economic norms into practice in place of mandatory <b>volume</b> <b>indicators</b> {{as one of its}} most important directions. However, scientific study of the problem yields more and more arguments in favor the need to develop a system of norms in the system of taxation already during the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan. Demands for unity and stability have been made on economic norms from the very beginning, since individualization makes them indistinguishable from the previous volume address targets. But {{what is the difference between}} taxes and economic norms, and why must the transition be made to a tax system?...|$|R
50|$|Traders {{and investors}} use the {{commodity}} channel index {{to help identify}} price reversals, price extremes and trend strength. As with most indicators, the CCI {{should be used in}} conjunction with other aspects of technical analysis. CCI fits into the momentum category of oscillators. In addition to momentum, <b>volume</b> <b>indicators</b> and the price chart may also influence a technical assessment.It is often used for detecting divergences from price trends as an overbought/oversold indicator, and to draw patterns on it and trade according to those patterns. In this respect, it is similar to bollinger bands, but is presented as an indicator rather than as overbought/oversold levels.|$|R
50|$|This {{situation}} is magnified {{when the number}} of profiles available is restricted, which may explain the use of forms which are not theoretically optimal but which tend to subject the available profiles to the permissible stress σ (such as, for example, pylons for high-voltage electric lines or variable height truss bridges). For structures subject to pure bending, this also explains the use of flat plates of variable lengths added to the flanges of these I profiles to obtain the inertia or resisting moment required, with the greatest degree of accuracy. Conversely, the significant variety in the tubes available enables a relative deviation value c which is both smaller and more constant. They also cover a much wider range in both the lower and higher characteristic values. Since their geometric performance is practically identical to that of the I profiles, tubes are the most appropriate industrial solution in order to practically eliminate any increase in the <b>volume</b> <b>indicator</b> W. Nevertheless, practical issues of availability and corrosion may limit their use.|$|E
5000|$|A {{volume unit}} (VU) meter or {{standard}} <b>volume</b> <b>indicator</b> (SVI) is a device displaying {{a representation of}} the signal level in audio equipment. The Acoustical Society of America standardized it in 1942 (ANSI C16.5-1942) for use in telephone installation and radio broadcast stations. Consumer audio equipment often features VU meters, both for utilitarian purposes (e.g. in recording equipment) and for aesthetics (in playback devices).The original VU meter is a passive electromechanical device, namely a 200 µA DC d'Arsonval movement ammeter fed from a full wave copper-oxide rectifier mounted within the meter case. The mass of the needle causes a relatively slow response, which in effect integrates the signal, with a rise time of 300 ms. 0 VU is equal to +4 dBu, or 1.228 volts RMS, a power of about 2.5 milliWatts when applied across a 600 ohm load. 0 VU {{is often referred to as}} [...] "0 dB". The meter was designed not to measure the signal, but to let users aim the signal level to a target level of 0 VU (sometimes labelled 100%), so it is not important that the device is non-linear and imprecise for low levels. In effect, the scale ranges from −20 VU to +3 VU, with −3 VU right in the middle. Purely electronic devices may emulate the response of the needle; they are VU-meters in as much as they respect the standard.|$|E
5000|$|One effect {{which is}} {{consistently}} used is a skewed camera angle accompanied by whispers, cries, and unsettling noises. The lower the sanity meter, the more skewed the camera angle and the louder the sound effects. Fourth wall breaking effects include simulated errors and anomalies of the TV or GameCube (one effect being a Blue Screen of Death); {{this does not}} affect gameplay unless the player misconstrues them as actual technical malfunctions and attempts to correct them. There are many different sanity effects, and their length depends on each effect. Not all effects will necessarily be encountered during a given run through the game. A few more commonplace examples include sounds, such as footsteps, women and children screaming, doors slamming, the rattling of chains {{and the sound of}} a blade being sharpened; the player character finding him/herself walking upon the ceiling after entering a new room; walls and ceilings bleeding; the volume being lowered, accompanied by a fake television <b>volume</b> <b>indicator</b> on the screen; and the appearance of large numbers of monsters that are not really there, and disappear when attacked. Some sanity effects are character- or area-specific and reflect the individual's personal fears or experiences or take advantage of environmental features (such as a statue whose head turns to follow the player). When the sanity effect is finished, everything goes back to normal and the character often utters a panicked statement to the effect of, [...] "this can't be happening!" ...|$|E
30|$|Selection and {{composition}} of welfare indicators: We have shown that indicators {{like that of the}} Prosperity Quintet are not directly suitable as inputs and outputs for a DEA analysis. Some of them consist of quotients of more basic welfare indicators. The values of some quotients are limited upwards or downwards. BCC models can avoid nonsensical values as benchmarks in these cases. However, they may calculate different efficiency scores for one and the same country, depending on their input or output orientation. Basic (<b>volume)</b> <b>indicators</b> may avoid such constellations. Even though it is problematic to take income distributions into account when analyzing the efficiency of incomes themselves, the calculation of the balance score as an additional performance measure ensures a representation of this important aspect of welfare.|$|R

40|$|Aruba and Sint Maarten are two {{countries}} within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, {{situated in the}} Caribbean.

This article focuses on {{one aspect of the}} quality of their development, which is whether this high-volume strategy has resulted in increased productivity. To that end, the development of several tourism <b>volume</b> <b>indicators</b> is compared to real gross domestic product (GDP) growth. Using real per capita GDP as an indicator, an assessment is made of labour productivity growth. Production volume has increased enormously through foreign investments and immigration, while productivity has remained stagnant.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an {{exploratory}} study {{which aims to}} improve {{our understanding of how}} the Chief Executive Officers of Victorian health services monitor strategic and operational performance in their organisations. As a component of a large scale human resource management study, we surveyed 130 Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) of Victorian health sector agencies. Our findings suggest that performance monitoring was more advanced among the larger Victorian health sector organisations, and that there were areas for improvement throughout the system. Overall, the CEOs reported limited use of performance indicators related to service and clinical perspectives, with financial and <b>volume</b> <b>indicators</b> most widely used. There was little evidence that these organisations had processes in place (such as benchmarking and linking required outcomes to staff performance management) to understand the implications of the performance information and translate them into management action. The findings suggest that the sector requires technical expertise and support in data reporting, benchmarking and quality improvement in order to improve performance monitoring and ensure its relevance to strategic control, but further study is required. ...|$|R

40|$|Compliance of the infarcted left {{ventricle}} was studied in dogs 3 - 5 days after occlusion {{of the left}} anterior descending coronary artery. Compliance was assessed from postmortem pressure-volume curves and from pressure-length measurements (mercury-in-silastic segment length gauges) made both in vivo and postmortem. Postmortem pressure-volume curves showed reduced compliance compared to sham-operated animals. Postmortem pressure-length curves of infarcted and adjacent normal myocardium indicated that the diminished total compliance {{could be attributed to}} an increase in stiffness of the infarcted area. This was confirmed by in vivo end-diastolic pressure-length changes produced by transient aortic occlusion. The infarcted area was akinetic, showing neither contraction nor aneurysmal bulging. In addition, anesthetized dogs with infarcts, when compared with sham-operated animals, had similar left ventricular end-diastolic <b>volumes</b> (<b>indicator</b> dilution method), but higher left ventricular end-diastolic pressures. Taken with previous observations, which show that systolic aneurysmal bulging is uniformly present at the onset of ischemia, these results indicate that stiffening of the ischemic myocardium occurs during the first 5 days after infarction, and show that elevation of left ventricular filling pressure does not necessarily signify ventricular dilatation. The results also suggest a mechanism whereby ventricular performance may improve during recovery from acute myocardial infarction...|$|R
40|$|Cost {{efficiency}} of basic welfare service provision in 353 Finnish municipalities in 1994 - 2002 is investigated. In a basically two tier public sector (central government and municipalities) the municipal sector has {{a central role}} in the Finnish economy as a provider of welfare services. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), a non-parametric linear programming method is employed, calculating a best practise total cost frontier for the decision making units, and comparing the various DMUs with this frontier. The outputs consist of up to ten <b>volume</b> <b>indicators</b> of services in health, social and educational sector. As the combined input, total real production costs of these services is used. According to the results efficiency differences were considerable between the municipalities, and a small group of a peripheral municipalities scored clearly below the others. Also annual changes in cost efficiency were estimated. As a second stage, differences in the DEA cost efficiency scores were explained with statistical models. Here the explanatory variables included structural and demographic indicators of municipalities, their location and measures of political power at local level. According to the results several of these variables had an expected effect on cost efficiency. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{the first annual}} GDP series for Great Britain over the period 1700 - 1870. The series is constructed in real terms from the output side, using <b>volume</b> <b>indicators</b> and value added weights. Sectoral estimates are provided for agriculture, industry and services, and {{for a number of}} sub-sectors. Estimates of nominal GDP are also provided, based on a benchmark for 1841 and projected back to 1700 and forward to 1870 using the real output series and sectoral price indices. The new data are used to provide a consistent account of economic growth and the business cycle. The results are broadly consistent with the long run path of real output suggested by Crafts and Harley, although growth rates for sub-periods differ, {{largely as a result of}} changes in the growth of agriculture. Nominal GDP increased more rapidly than suggested by Lindert and Williamson during the eighteenth century, and more slowly than suggested by Deane and Cole during the first half of the nineteenth century, as a result of differences in the price indices. We also refine the business cycle chronologies of Ashton and Gayer, Rostow and Schwartz. ...|$|R
