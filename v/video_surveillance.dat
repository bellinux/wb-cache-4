5|$|The first {{implementation}} {{of such a}} scheme was Singapore Area Licensing Scheme in 1975, together with a comprehensive package of road pricing measures, stringent car ownership rules and improvements in mass transit. Thanks to technological advances in electronic toll collection, electronic detection, and <b>video</b> <b>surveillance</b> technology, collecting congestion fees has become easier. Singapore upgraded its system in 1998, and similar pricing schemes were implemented in Rome in 2001, London in 2003 with extensions in 2007; Stockholm in 2006, as a seven-month trial, and then on a permanent basis. In January 2008 Milan began a one-year trial program called Ecopass, charging low emission standard vehicles and exempting cleaner and alternative fuel vehicles. The Ecopass program was extended until December 31, 2011, and on January 16, 2012 was replaced by Area C, a trial program that converted the scheme from a pollution-charge to a congestion charge. The Gothenburg congestion tax was implemented in January 2013 and it was modeled after the Stockholm scheme.|$|E

The team posits that while no one is actually causing the incidents, they are happening as Olivia has seen them. At the restaurant, the owner tells them a blond man with a scar named Nick Lane (David Call) was sitting in the same place as Olivia was in her dream, and was also seen in the <b>video</b> <b>surveillance</b> from the first crime scene. Walter posits that because she never sees him in her dreams, it was Lane, not Olivia, causing the people's deaths. Olivia and Peter interview doctors at St. Jude's Mental Hospital, who tell them Lane was a voluntary resident, but left after the visit of a mysterious man. The doctor described him as hyperemotive, meaning those near him adopt his emotions. Olivia and Peter soon learn that as a child, Lane was treated with the nootropic drug Cortexiphan in drug trials, and believes himself to be a recruit in the upcoming war between the two universes.|$|E

The purpose of a surveillance system is to record properties and trajectories of objects in a given area, generate warnings or notify designated authority in case of occurrence of particular events.|$|E

Hence semi/fully automated intelligent systems are required to intimate the operators at the time of happening, thus hope of controlling huge damage. To illustrate, this can be used in finding terror attack, bomb placement, religion disputes, attacks, accidents, violation of traffic rules, etc. With this aim, researchers have focused on Abnormal Detection in <b>Surveillance</b> <b>Videos</b> where anomaly is detected and localized.

40|$|It is {{a common}} {{understanding}} that the <b>surveillance</b> <b>video</b> market is moving to standard, wireline and wireless IP based solutions because of the many advantages over the proprietary RF-based solutions that were deployed previously. State of the art solutions are using the very popular H. 264 standard for the <b>video</b> compression. <b>Surveillance</b> <b>video</b> applications differentiate from other video streaming applications {{in the fact that}} the delivery of the video has to be very reliable, thus, especially for wireless environments, the usage of UDP as transmission mechanism is not the ideal solution.

In this work a solution is proposed to the problem of transmission of <b>surveillance</b> <b>video</b> in a reliable manner, by combining the best of both worlds: An intermediate multicast video server is used for receiving video streams through TCP from the IP camera and transmitting through multicast UDP to the viewers.

40|$|<b>Surveillance</b> <b>video</b> service (SVS) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} services provided in a smart city.

Key frame extraction is a simple yet effective technique to achieve this goal. In <b>surveillance</b> <b>video</b> applications, key frames are typically used to summarize important video content. It is very important and essential to extract key frames accurately and efficiently. A novel approach is proposed to extract key frames from traffic <b>surveillance</b> <b>videos</b> based on GPU (graphics processing units) to ensure high efficiency and accuracy. For the determination of key frames, motion is a more salient feature in presenting actions or events, especially in <b>surveillance</b> <b>videos.</b> The motion feature is extracted in GPU to reduce running time. It is also smoothed to reduce noise, and the frames with local maxima of motion information are selected as the final key frames. The experimental results show that this approach can extract key frames more accurately and efficiently compared with several other methods...|$|R
