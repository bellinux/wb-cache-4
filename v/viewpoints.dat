The black point lower left is where the <b>viewpoint</b> ends. The red broken line is the path which <b>viewpoint</b> moves along.

5|$|Items {{from the}} TV series such as multi-perspective screens (as {{shown on the}} box cover) were popular for {{illustrating}} multiple <b>viewpoints</b> of an objective. The use of episode start and end graphics to mark the start and end of missions was also liked. The script was generally described as being a redeeming feature of the game, although fans of the series may find that the <b>viewpoints,</b> motives and reasoning of the villains isn't covered well. Cutscenes were singled out for particular praise by IGN, highlighting good use of camera angles and tight focus. Voice acting was generally popular, although some lines suffered from poor direction or emphasis. In contrast, device and ambiance sounds were well received with gunfire getting a particular mention.|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{this chapter}} we review {{the use of}} an {{information}} channel as a unified framework for <b>viewpoint</b> selection, mesh saliency and geometry simplification. Tak-ing the <b>viewpoint</b> distribution as input and object mesh polygons as output vectors, the channel is given by the projected areas of the polygons over the different view-points. From this channel, <b>viewpoint</b> entropy and <b>viewpoint</b> mutual information can be defined in a natural way. Reversing this channel, polygonal mutual information is obtained, which is interpreted as an ambient occlusion-like quantity, and from the variation of this polygonal mutual information mesh saliency is defined. <b>Viewpoint</b> entropy, <b>viewpoint</b> Kullback-Leibler distance, and <b>viewpoint</b> mutual information are then applied to mesh simplification, and shown to compare well with a classical geometrical simplification method. ...|$|R

50|$|A view of {{a system}} is a {{representation}} of the system {{from the perspective of a}} <b>viewpoint.</b> This <b>viewpoint</b> on a system involves a perspective focusing on specific concerns regarding the system, which suppresses details to provide a simplified model having only those elements related to the concerns of the <b>viewpoint.</b> For example, a security <b>viewpoint</b> focuses on security concerns and a security <b>viewpoint</b> model contains those elements that are related to security from a more general model of a system.|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a framework of}} multiple <b>viewpoint</b> systems for describing and designing systems that use more than one representation or set of relevance judgments on the same collection. A <b>viewpoint</b> is any representational scheme on some collection of data objects together with a mechanism for accessing this content. A multiple <b>viewpoint</b> system allows a searcher to pose queries to one <b>viewpoint</b> and then change to another <b>viewpoint</b> while retaining a sense of context. Multiple <b>viewpoint</b> systems are well suited to alleviate vocabulary mismatches and {{to take advantage of}} the possibility of combining evidence. We discuss some of the issues that arise in designing and using such systems and illustrate the concepts with several examples...|$|R

5|$|A {{particular}} viewpoint {{is called}} a naya or a partial viewpoint. According to Vijay Jain, Nayavada does not deny the attributes, qualities, modes and other aspects; but qualifies them to be from a particular perspective. A naya reveals {{only a part of}} the totality, and should not be mistaken for the whole. A synthesis of different <b>viewpoints</b> is said to be achieved by the doctrine of conditional predications (syādvāda).|$|E
5|$|Across {{the texts}} of Hinduism, there is a profusion of ideas about the virtue of Ahimsa when applied to {{non-human}} life, but without a universal consensus. Alsdorf claims the debate and disagreements between supporters of vegetarian lifestyle and meat eaters was significant. Even suggested exceptions – ritual slaughter and hunting – were challenged by advocates of Ahimsa. In the Mahabharata both sides present various arguments to substantiate their <b>viewpoints.</b> Moreover, a hunter defends his profession in a long discourse.|$|E
40|$|Mental {{rotation}} (MR) {{is often}} measured in a task where participants judge the handedness of rotated objects, and is revealed by a <b>viewpoint</b> cost - a linear reduction {{in performance with}} an increase of <b>viewpoint</b> disparity for the objects. Similar <b>viewpoint</b> costs are also often found for object recognition (OR), in tasks where participants match the identity of rotated objects. These findings led to speculations that MR might be the mechanism underlying OR. However, recent studies dissociate the two tasks (Gauthier et al., 2002; Hayward et al., 2006). If <b>viewpoint</b> costs are dissociable in MR and OR, we may ask whether they arise because of the same or different factors. Specifically, <b>viewpoint</b> disparity is usually confounded by image similarity in these tasks - images become dissimilar {{with an increase in}} <b>viewpoint</b> difference. Here, we investigated the effects of <b>viewpoint</b> disparity and image similarity in MR and OR using novel objects rotated around the vertical axis. Subjective similarity ratings for image pairs that differed by 40 ˚, 80 ˚, 120 ˚ and 160 ˚ were collected and used to dissociate the two factors. In a Similarity condition, the <b>viewpoint</b> disparity was fixed and image similarity was manipulated. In a <b>Viewpoint</b> condition, <b>viewpoint</b> disparities were manipulated while similarity was fixed. In a sequential matching paradigm, participants performed the MR or OR tasks in both Similarity and <b>Viewpoint</b> conditions. Performance was better for similar than dissimilar image pairs for both tasks, but the effect was larger for OR than MR. In contrast, when similarity was controlled, a <b>viewpoint</b> cost was only found for MR but not for OR. These results demonstrate different causes of the <b>viewpoint</b> costs in the two tasks: while MR largely relies on 3 -D mental transformation procedures that depend on <b>viewpoint</b> disparity, OR is based predominantly on matching similarity of image features.

40|$|Free-viewpoint {{video is}} {{a new type of}} {{interactive}} multimedia service allowing users to control their <b>viewpoint</b> and generate new views of a dynamic scene from any perspective. The uniquely generated and displayed views are composed from two or more high bitrate camera streams that must be delivered to the users depending on their continuously changing perspective. Due to significant network and computational resource requirements, we proposed scalable <b>viewpoint</b> generation and delivery schemes based on multicast forwarding and distributed approach. Our aim was to find the optimal deployment locations of the distributed <b>viewpoint</b> synthesis processes in the network topology by allowing network nodes to act as proxy servers with caching and <b>viewpoint</b> synthesis functionalities. Moreover, a predictive multicast group management scheme was introduced in order to provide all camera views that may be requested in the near future and prevent the <b>viewpoint</b> synthesizer algorithm from remaining without camera streams. The obtained results showed that even 42 % traffic decrease can be realized using distributed <b>viewpoint</b> synthesis and the probability of <b>viewpoint</b> synthesis starvation can be also significantly reduced in future free <b>viewpoint</b> video services...|$|R
5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} can be {{seen from}} a variety of <b>viewpoints.</b> A synthesized research definition of cognitive flexibility is a switch in thinking, whether that is specifically based on a switch in rules or broadly based on a need to switch one’s previous beliefs or thoughts to new situations. Moreover, it refers to simultaneously considering multiple aspects of thought at once, whether they be two aspects of a specific object, or many aspects of a complex situation. Other terms for and components of cognitive flexibility include mental flexibility, mental set shifting, cognitive shifting, task switching/shifting, and attention switching/shifting.|$|E
