5000|$|British general J. F. C. Fuller, {{architect}} of the first great tank battle at Cambrai, and his contemporary, B. H. Liddell Hart, were amongst the most prominent advocates of mechanization and motorization of the army in Britain. In Germany, study groups were set up by Hans von Seeckt, commander of the Reichswehr Truppenamt, for 57 areas of strategy and tactics to learn from World War I and to adapt strategy to avoid the stalemate and then defeat they had suffered. All seem to have seen the strategic shock <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>mobility</b> and the new possibilities made possible by motorised forces. Both saw that the armoured fighting vehicle demonstrated firepower, mobility and protection. The Germans seem to have seen more clearly {{the need to make}} all branches of the Army as mobile as possible to maximise the results of this strategy. It would negate the static defences of the trench and machine gun and restore the strategic principles of manoeuvre and offense. Nevertheless, it was the British Army which was the only [...] one truly mechanised {{at the beginning of the}} Second World War, the Germans still relying on horse traction for a large portion of their artillery.|$|E

This makes ZnO-based thin-film transistors very attractive for application in displays, where the higher mobility would provide higher switching speeds or lower power operation. For display applications, ZnO has the additional advantage of high optical transparency, whereas α-Si/H does not. Furthermore, ZnO-based thin-film transistors have considerable potential in emerging applications such as wearable and flexible electronics.|$|R

40|$|Ionic electrophoretic mobilities {{determined}} {{by means of}} CE experiments are sometimes different when compared to generally accepted values based on limiting ionic conductance measurements. While the effect of ionic strength on electrophoretic mobility has been long understood, {{the increase in the}} mobility that results from Joule heating (the resistive heating that occurs when a current passes through an electrolyte) has been largely overlooked. In this work, a simple method for obtaining reliable and reproducible <b>values</b> <b>of</b> electrophoretic <b>mobility</b> is described. The electrophoretic mobility is measured over a range of driving powers and the extrapolation to zero power dissipation is employed to eliminate the effect of Joule heating. These extrapolated <b>values</b> <b>of</b> electrophoretic <b>mobility</b> can then be used to calculate limiting ionic mobilities by making a correction for ionic strength; this somewhat complicated calculation is conveniently performed by using the freeware program PeakMaster 5. These straightforward procedures improve the agreement between experimentally determined and literature <b>values</b> <b>of</b> limiting ionic <b>mobility</b> by at least one order of magnitude. Using Tris-chromate BGE with a <b>value</b> <b>of</b> conductivity 0. 34 S/m and ionic strength 59 mM at a modest dissipated power per unit length of 2. 0 W/m, <b>values</b> <b>of</b> <b>mobility</b> for inorganic anions were increased by an average of 12. 6 % relative to their values free from the effects of Joule heating. These increases were accompanied by a reduction in mobilities due to the ionic strength effect, which was 11 % for univalent and 28 % for divalent inorganic ions compared to their limiting ionic mobilities. Additionally, it was possible to determine the limiting ionic mobility for a number of aromatic anions by using PeakMaster 5 to perform an ionic strength correction. A major significance of this work is in being able to use CE to obtain reliable and accurate <b>values</b> <b>of</b> electrophoretic <b>mobilities</b> with all its benefits, including understanding and interpretation of physicochemical phenomena and the ability to model and simulate such phenomena accurately...|$|R

40|$|One {{perovskite}} oxide, ASnO 3 (A = Sr, Ba), is {{a candidate}} for use as a transparent conductive oxide with high electron mobility in single crystalline form. However, the electron mobility of films grown on SrTiO 3 substrates does not reach the bulk value, probably because of dislocation scattering that originates from the large lattice mismatch. This study investigates the effect of insertion of bilayer BaSnO 3 / (Sr,Ba) SnO 3 for buffering this large lattice mismatch between La:BaSnO 3 and SrTiO 3 substrate. The insertion of 200 -nm-thick BaSnO 3 on (Sr,Ba) SnO 3 bilayer buffer structures reduces the number of dislocations and improves surface smoothness of the films after annealing as proved respectively by scanning transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. A systematic investigation of BaSnO 3 buffer layer thickness dependence on Hall mobility of the electron transport in La:BaSnO 3 shows that the highest obtained <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>mobility</b> is 78 cm 2 V− 1 s− 1 because of its fewer dislocations.

40|$|The low {{frequency}} noise (LFN) properties of field-effect transistors (FETs) using polymers as the semiconducting substrate material are investigated and {{explained in terms}} of the charge carrier transport in polymer thin-film structure. Three mechanisms contribute to the carrier transport - charge injection from source electrode into polymer, charge hopping between polymer molecules for drift transport toward the drain, and charge buildup, probably at polymeroxide interface. Charge buildup is responsible for non-stationary electrical characteristics, but does not contribute significantly to the LFN. Charge hopping determines the maximum value of the mobility and the minimum <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>mobility</b> 1 /f noise. The variations of the PFET characteristics are mainly due to dispersion in the injection barrier of source-to-polymer contact. High disorder in the polymer at the source contact can increase the leakage current in PFET and can introduce number fluctuation S-GN in the polymer conduction on top of the mobility fluctuation. SGN is proportional to the DC power applied to the injection barrier and should be assumed as a voltage source, since carrier hopping in the polymer reduces the effect of the injection noise. At present, the physical origin of SGN is not fully understood...|$|E

By examining three different cases where urban freeway removal was a seriously considered option – two where the freeway was removed and replaced with a lower capacity at-grade boulevard and one where the freeway ultimately was not removed this paper works toward a theory of highway removal.

40|$|I {{document}} that {{the volatility of}} persistent idiosyncratic shocks to wages varies inversely with inter-industry wage differentials. I then show that this striking feature of the data arises naturally in a general equilibrium life cycle model with inter-industry mobility. There are two key forces at play in the model. On one hand, agents dislike wage volatility since it makes consumption smoothing harder. On the other hand, given that agents can always switch to another industry {{in which they are}} more productive, agents like wage volatility because it offers the potential for high wage growth with limited downside risk. For plausible calibrations, the option <b>value</b> <b>of</b> <b>mobility</b> dominates the risk premium effect, leading to a negative relationship between wage volatility and inter-industry wage differentials on the order of that observed in the data. Interindustry wage differentials and the allocation of workers across industries are intimately related to the ability of agents to borrow in credit markets. I find that the decreased cost of issuing consumer credit since the early 1980 ’s can explain a large fraction of the observed increase in risk-taking by young workers in the labor market, steepening of the risk-return trade-off across industries, and rise in measured productivity...|$|E
