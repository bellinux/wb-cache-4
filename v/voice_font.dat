The simplest one is to select a <b>voice</b> <b>font</b> from a group {{in order to get}} the clearest one, or to choose the one with a speed that is appropriate for different settings.|$|E
50|$|The {{synthesized}} voice {{created by}} using a <b>voice</b> <b>font</b> tends to have a slightly unnatural tone. Human voices are very prone to change with the speaker's mood and several other factors that aren't programmed into computerized voices. <b>Voice</b> <b>font</b> software on the Macintosh system tries to get around this by providing tags to change some components of the voice, such as pitch. The Natural Voices software in the sources section allows defining acronym pronunciation and speech rate, {{as well as other}} things. Even though speech synthesis has existed since around 1930, according to that source, and the Speech synthesis article, it is difficult to fool experienced listeners into believing that the voice is indeed human.|$|E
50|$|A <b>voice</b> <b>font</b> is a computer-generated {{voice that}} can be {{controlled}} by specifying parameters such as speed and pitch and made to pronounce text input. The concept is akin {{to that of a}} text font or a MIDI instrument {{in the sense that the}} same input may easily be represented in several different ways based on the design of each font. In spite of current shortcomings in the underlying technology for voice fonts, screen readers and other devices used to enhance accessibility of text to persons with disabilities, can benefit from having more than one default <b>voice</b> <b>font.</b> This happens in the same way that users of a traditional computer word processor benefit from having more than one text font.|$|E
50|$|Certain Macintosh {{clients of}} instant {{messaging}} {{services such as}} AOL Instant Messenger have {{had the option of}} reading incoming messages using the system's <b>voice</b> <b>fonts.</b> When message receiver has stepped away from the computer, or temporarily put away the part of the screen showing the incoming text, the computer reads the message out loud. This allows the user to continue with their other tasks without needing to view the incoming text.|$|R
50|$|Another use for <b>voice</b> <b>fonts</b> is in {{electronic}} music. A commonly available set of synthetic voices from Macintosh computers {{can be used}} to enhance the mood of certain music pieces that need a voice but where the composer feels that providing a human voice is not in their interests. Here, male voices can be combined in a choir to provide the tenor and bass for a particular piece, and female voices can be added to fill {{in other parts of the}} ensembleâ€”resulting in a choir that consists of speech synthesis rather than human singers, or to utilize a female voice when none are available.|$|R
40|$|Consistent phoneme {{segmentation}} {{is essential}} in building high quality Text-to-Speech (TTS) <b>voice</b> <b>fonts.</b> In this paper we propose to adapt an existing well-trained Context Dependent Boundary Model (CDBM) for refining segment boundaries to a new speaker with limited, manually segmented data. Three adaptation approaches: MLLR, MAP, and {{a combination of the}} two, are studied. The combined one, MLLR+MAP, delivers the best boundary refinement performance. In comparison with other boundary segmentation methods, the adapted CDBM yields better results, especially with a limited amount of adaptation data. Given 400 manually segmented boundary tokens in about 20 sentences as a development set, the segmentation precision can reach 90 % of human labeled boundaries within a tolerance of 20 ms. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a framework for}} custom-tailoring <b>voice</b> <b>font</b> in data-driven TTS systems. Three criteria for unit pruning, the prosodic outlier criterion, the importance criterion and {{the combination of the}} two, are proposed. The performance of voice fonts in different sizes which are pruned with the three criteria is evaluated by simulating speech synthesis over large amount of texts and estimating the naturalness with an objective measure at the same time. The result shows that the combined criterion performs the best among the three. The pre-estimated curve for naturalness vs. database size might be used as a reference for custom-tailoring <b>voice</b> <b>font.</b> The naturalness remains almost unchanged when 50 % of instances are pruned off with the combined criterion. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{employment}} of non-uniform helps Corpus-based TTS synthesize high natural speech. But tailoring TTS <b>voice</b> <b>font,</b> or pruning redundant synthesis instances, usually results in loss of non-uniform. In order {{to solve this}} problem, this paper proposes the algorithm named NuClustering-VPA. According to this algorithm, the high-level non-uniforms containing same syllables are clustered to several centers, then the centers are projected to low-level non-uniforms. Therefore, the center's projections can guide the clustering of low-level non-uniforms. These series of processes avoid erasing or destroying those key non-uniforms for synthesis. In experiments, the naturalness scored by MOS does not severely degrade when reduction rate is above 39. 63 %. And this approach {{has been applied to}} the software product of Ifytek Co. Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{employment}} of non-uniform processes assists greatly in the corpus-based text-to-speech (TTS) system to synthesize natural speech. However, tailoring a TTS <b>voice</b> <b>font,</b> or pruning redundant synthesis instances, usually results in loss of non-uniform synthesis instances. In order {{to solve this}} problem, we propose the concept of virtual non-uniform instances. According to this concept and the synthesis frequency of each instance, the algorithm named StaRp-VPA is constructed {{to make up for}} the loss of nonuniform instances. In experimental testing, the naturalness scored by the mean opinion score (MOS) remains almost unchanged when less than 50 % instances are pruned, and the MOS is only slightly degraded for reduction rates above 50 %. The test results show that the algorithm StaRp-VPA is effective. Key words: text-to-speech system; speech synthesis; synthesis instance pruning; non-uniform uni...|$|E
