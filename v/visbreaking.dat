50|$|<b>Visbreaking</b> {{technology}} 1998.|$|E
50|$|In soaker <b>visbreaking,</b> {{the bulk}} of the {{cracking}} reaction occurs not in the furnace but in a drum located after the furnace called the soaker. Here the oil is held at an elevated temperature for a pre-determined period of time to allow cracking to occur before being quenched. The oil then passes to a fractionator. In soaker <b>visbreaking,</b> lower temperatures are used than in coil <b>visbreaking.</b> The comparatively long duration of the cracking reaction is used instead.|$|E
50|$|<b>Visbreaking</b> unit {{upgrades}} heavy residual oils by thermally cracking {{them into}} lighter, more valuable reduced viscosity products.|$|E
50|$|MDO is {{made from}} a {{catalytic}} cracking/visbreaking refinery. The catalytic cracking operation breaks large molecules into small molecules. It happens in high temperature and with appropriate catalyst. <b>Visbreaking</b> {{is a process that}} turn the bottom product of the vacuum unit, which has extremely high viscosity, into lower viscosity, marketable product. In <b>visbreaking,</b> a relatively mild thermal cracking operation is performed. And the amount of cracking is limited by the overruling requirement to safeguard the heavy fuel stability.|$|E
50|$|Bashneft - Ufaneftekhim has fuel, gas catalysis, goods {{production}} and service units and aromatic hydrocarbons production. Technological units operate at the refinery, including most units ensuring {{a high rate}} of crude oil refining depth (delayed coking, hydrocracking, catalytic cracking, deasphalting, <b>visbreaking,</b> bitumen production).|$|E
5000|$|The {{refinery}} has {{a capacity}} of [...] [...] By 2013, the capacity will be increased to [...] [...] The refinery consists of crude units, <b>visbreaking</b> units, fluid catalytic cracker, light products plants, polymerization plants, amine plants, sulfur plants, and impurities treatment plants.|$|E
5000|$|Fuel Economy: The lower {{temperatures}} {{used in the}} soaker approach {{mean that}} these units use less fuel. In cases where a refinery buys fuel to support process operations, any savings in fuel consumption could be extremely valuable. In such cases, soaker <b>visbreaking</b> may be advantageous.|$|E
5000|$|De-coking: The {{cracking}} reaction forms {{petroleum coke}} as a byproduct. In coil <b>visbreaking,</b> this deposits in the tubes of the furnace and will {{eventually lead to}} fouling or blocking of the tubes. The same will occur in the drum of a soaker visbreaker, though the lower temperatures used in the soaker drum lead to fouling at a much slower rate. Coil visbreakers therefore require frequent de-coking. This is quite labour-intensive, but can be developed into a routine where tubes are de-coked sequentially without the need {{to shut down the}} <b>visbreaking</b> operation. Soaker drums require far less frequent attention but their being taken out of service normally requires a complete halt to the operation. Which is the more disruptive activity will vary from refinery to refinery.|$|E
50|$|The current {{production}} facilities of Bashneft - Novoil include primary oil refining, hydrotreatment, reforming and iso-reforming, sulphuric acid alkylation, thermocracking and <b>visbreaking,</b> coking and gas fractionation, solvent refining and dewaxing of oil distillates, tar deasphalting and bitumen production, gas desulphurization and sulphur production units {{as well as}} environmental facilities.|$|E
50|$|It has a {{processing}} capacity of 4.3 Mt/a, {{is equipped with}} a <b>visbreaking</b> plant of around 1.7 Mt/a and a plant for the production of bitumen. It has a sea terminal to receive raw materials and dispense with surplus products.The Rome refinery is also an important logistical base: a certain amount of products, equal to 50% of refinery production, arrives from the outside, using the structure as a transit depot.|$|E
50|$|With {{this much}} {{residual}} oil, reclaiming and upgrading {{it not only}} helps meet demand but also improves profitability for refineries. Finding effective options for extracting valuable fuels from the unwanted material is economically attractive. Some other methods used to upgrade residual oil are Deasphalting, Coking, Hydrocracking, Residue Hydrotreating, Resid FCC, and <b>Visbreaking.</b> Another method for upgrading and handling uses a devolatilization process to separate the quality oil and the asphaltene material.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{most other}} chemicals, {{the purpose of}} a {{peroxide}} is to decompose. In doing so it generates useful radicals that can initiate polymerization to make polymers, modify polymers by grafting or <b>visbreaking,</b> or cross-link polymers to create a thermoset. When used for these purposes, the peroxide is highly diluted, so the heat generated by the exothermic decomposition is safely absorbed by the surrounding medium (e.g. polymer compound or emulsion). But when a peroxide is in a more pure form, the heat evolved by its decomposition may not dissipate as quickly as it is generated, which can result in increasing temperature, which further intensifies the rate of exothermic decomposition. This can create a dangerous situation known as a self-accelerating decomposition.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Visbreaking</b> {{preferentially}} cracks aliphatic compounds {{which have}} relatively low sulphur contents, low density and high viscosity {{and the effect}} of their removal can be clearly seen in the change in quality between feed and product. A too severe cracking in a visbreaker will lead to the asphaltene colloid becoming metastable. Subsequent addition of a diluent to manufacture a finished fuel oil can cause the colloid to break down, precipitating asphaltenes as a sludge. It has been observed that a paraffinic diluent is more likely to cause precipitation than an aromatic one. Stability of fuel oil is assessed using a number of proprietary tests (for example [...] "P" [...] value and SHF tests).|$|E

5000|$|The term coil (or furnace) <b>visbreaking</b> {{is applied}} to units where the {{cracking}} process occurs in the furnace tubes (or [...] "coils"). Material exiting the furnace is quenched to halt the cracking reactions: frequently this is achieved by heat exchange with the virgin material being fed to the furnace, {{which in turn is}} a good energy efficiency step, but sometimes a stream of cold oil (usually gas oil) is used to the same effect. The gas oil is recovered and re-used. The extent of the cracking reaction is controlled by regulation of the speed of flow of the oil through the furnace tubes. The quenched oil then passes to a fractionator where the products of the cracking (gas, LPG, gasoline, gas oil and tar) are separated and recovered.|$|E
40|$|In a {{refinery}} <b>visbreaking</b> is {{a complementary}} process to upgrade vacuum residue or bottom of barrelsto the more precious stocks {{such as the}} fuel oil and gasoline. In this present work, <b>visbreaking</b> of vacuumresidue in a commercial soaker-visbreaking plant is studied. The product of the <b>visbreaking</b> furnace ischaracterized to the light gas (C 1, C 2), LPG (C 3, C 4), gasoline (IBP- 180 oC), gas oil (180 - 320 oC) and fuel(320 +oC). Afterwards to model the <b>visbreaking</b> process, a six-lump kinetic network with fifteen reactions andthirty kinetic parameters is developed. In this model, <b>visbreaking</b> furnace is modeled as a equal distributedheater whilst the soaker is modeled as a complete stirred tank reactor.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the problem of}} residue upgrading operations in an oil refinery. <b>Visbreaking</b> is a residue-upgrading process that improves profitability of a refinery. The economics of converting the heavy residue into the lighter and more valuable streams, coupled with the installation of a modem visbreaker unit at the Engen Refinery in Durban, provides sufficient motives to develop a mathematical model to simulate the unit's capability and estimate {{the economics of the}} <b>visbreaking</b> process and fuel oil operations. Furthermore, the proposed model should provide a crude-dependent <b>visbreaking</b> yield {{that can be used in}} the refinery's global linear programme (LP), employed to evaluate and select the crude and to optimise refinery's operations. Traditionally, kinetically based models have been used to simulate and study the refining reaction processes. In this case, due to the complexity of the process and some unknown reactions, the performances of existing <b>visbreaking</b> simulators are not fully satisfactory. Consequently, a neural network model of the <b>visbreaking</b> process and fuel oil blending operation is developed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{this study}} the kinetic {{modeling}} of <b>visbreaking</b> reactions {{for a number}} of vacuum residue feeds was investigated using available experimental data from the literature. A continuous lumping model was developed for kinetic analysis of <b>visbreaking</b> reactions. The normalized boiling point was used to describe each feed as a continuous mixture and the concentration distribution of the mixture would change under reaction conditions. A continuous model with five adjustable parameters was used to describe <b>visbreaking</b> reactions, and these parameters were optimized for each feed for reaction temperatures in the range of 400 – 430  °C using available experimental data. The model was able to accurately predict the weight percent of each boiling cut in the reaction products...|$|E
40|$|The {{transportation}} of heavy oil is a pressing problem. Various {{methods have been}} devised to mitigate the reluctance to flow of these highly dense and viscous oils. This study is focused on evaluating a case for post-production partial upgrading of heavy oil. Specifically, we analyze the impact of <b>visbreaking,</b> a mild thermal cracking method, on the economic and energy demands of the post-production process. Using conservative modeling techniques and principles we find significant cost and energy savings can potentially result out of <b>visbreaking.</b> Cost savings result {{as a consequence of}} reduced diluent usage. Even the most conservative modeling scenario under consideration exhibits significant cost savings in the form of reduced diluent usage; these savings not only offset operational costs but provide short payback periods on capital expenditures. Additionally, the lower gravity blend resulting from <b>visbreaking</b> can also bring about energy and cost savings in pipeline transportation and positively impact the heavy oil value chain from the producer to a refinery or regional upgrading facility. From this basic analysis of the potential of <b>visbreaking,</b> we can recommend investing resources to study its viability in the field. Using this analysis as a tipping off point and with a detailed look at the chemistry of the oil in question it is possible to make a very viable case for <b>visbreaking.</b> In a similar vein, this analysis can serve as a guide in making a case for other partial upgrading methods as well...|$|E

30|$|Conversion {{processes}} {{carry out}} chemical reactions that crack large, high-boiling point hydrocarbon molecules into smaller, lighter molecules suitable for gasoline, jet fuel, diesel fuel, petrochemical feedstocks, and other high-value products. The primary conversion processes that perform these operations are {{fluid catalytic cracking}} (FCC), hydrocracking, and coking. <b>Visbreaking</b> is a thermal conversion process similar to coking but is milder and rarely used in the US anymore, but is still common in Europe {{and other parts of}} the world where legacy units remain in operation.|$|E

The estimator {{is based on}} a feed forward neural network, and the input data are pretreated with the Principal Component Analysis, which allows identifying the significant features in the available data. The neural model is trained, validated, and tested off-line by using plant data spanning an operating window of nine months.

In addition, the use of additives to encourage the preliminary deposition of coke-forming constituents is also an option.

40|$|The thermal {{treatment}} of crop oils was investigated {{with the aim}} to produce a renewable, liquid fuel suitable for use in wick-based lighting systems. Specific objectives include reducing fuel viscosity and improving wickability in traditional flat cotton wicks. Pyrolysis and <b>visbreaking</b> processes were the two methods of {{thermal treatment}} that were studied. <b>Visbreaking</b> was a semi-batch process carried out in a stirred tank reactor at temperatures ranging from 300 to 500 °C. Pyrolysis utilized a continuous system with a mechanically fluidized bed reactor at temperatures ranging from 400 - 650 °C. Initial testing with soybean oil feedstock demonstrated that pyrolysis was the superior process for the application due to its greater severity. Organic liquid yields of up to 93 wt% were observed, with reduction in viscosity as high as 96 %. Wickability of the fuel was greatly improved as demonstrated with dedicated testing. Product yields and properties were heavily reliant on reaction temperature in both processes. Feedstocks representing {{a wide spectrum of}} crop oil composition were tested with pyrolysis. The proportion of saturated chemical bonds was found to {{have a negative impact on}} the product quality at low temperatures. Highly saturated oils required increased temperatures to produce liquid product. Fuels produced from the thermal treatment of crop oils can provide up to 60 wt% in blends with kerosene to produce a successful lamp fuel...|$|E

Thermal processes like <b>visbreaking</b> and delayed coking are still quite diffused technologies. This paper presents some major aspects of the delayed coking kinetic modelling and some preliminary results compared with experimental data. A mechanistic approach has been adopted; it allows describing the process in wide ranges of operating condition and feedstocks. The developed model can be a useful tool for feedstock selection, production planning, control and optimisation. A special attention is devoted in the paper to substitutive addition reactions responsible of coke formation into the drums...|$|E
40|$|The fluid {{behavior}} of asphaltenes at elevated temperatures impacts coke formation {{in a number}} of hydrocarbon conversion processes, including <b>visbreaking</b> and delayed coking. In this study, the asphaltenes from a number of sources, namely, a vacuum residue, a petroleum source rock (Kimmeridge clay) bitumen obtained by hydrous pyrolysis, and bitumen products from a sub-bituminous coal and pine wood obtained by thermolytic solvent extraction using tetralin, have been characterized using high-temperature proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H NMR), and the results correlated with those from small-amplitude oscillatory shear rheometry. Further for comparison, the coke (toluene insolubles) obtained from <b>visbreaking</b> the vacuum residue was also characterized. All of the asphaltenes became completely fluid by 300 °C, with hydrogen being completely mobile with coke formation, identified as a solid phase, not occurring to a significant extent until 450 °C. Extremely good agreement was obtained between high-temperature 1 H NMR and rheometry results, which confirmed that the asphaltenes were highly fluid from 300 °C, with initial signs of resolidification being observed at temperatures of around 450 °C. During softening, extremely good correlations between fluid hydrogen and phase angle were obtained as the asphaltenes softened. The toluene insolubles however did contain some fluid material; thus, it cannot be regarded as strictly solid coke, but clearly, with increasing temperature, the fluid material did convert to coke. Under actual process conditions, this fluid material could be responsible for coke adhering to reactor surfaces...|$|E
40|$|A {{commercial}} {{test was}} carried out at the Lukoil Neftochim Bourgas, Bulgaria <b>visbreaking</b> unit. Thevisbreaker furnace outlet temperature was varied between 436 and 4540 C and the throughput wasvaried between 184 and 215 m 3 /h. The increase of severity led to increase of 360 oC conversionfrom 18. 7 to 25. 1 %. The visbreaker residue stability was found to depend not only on severity butalso on the VGO content in the vacuum residue feed. The reduction of VGO content (increase ofvacuum residue viscosity) allows achievement of higher conversion and production of stablevisbreaker residue. The activation energy of the visbreaker process {{was determined to be}} 14. 3 kcal/mol for the investigated conditions. The increase of conversion above 21 % was associatedwith a reduction of visbreaker residue flash point in closed cup below 60 oC...|$|E

This difference ismuch higher than the specified in EN ISO 2719 repeatability – 50 C and reproducibility - 100 C and wasobserved in three laboratories: LNB Research laboratory, Saybolt and SGS. A possible explanation of theobserved difference in the flash point of the fuel oil {{is the fact that}} the residual fuel oil is a colloidal dispersionsystem and the different treatment of a sample results in different stability of the colloidal dispersionsystem which eventually affect the measured value of flash point in closed cup...|$|E

Initially the simulator was validated using actual plant test runs and after tuning, the simulations provided errors less than 3 %. Using the validated simulator the sensitivity of yield of fuel oil, gasoline and fuel oil viscosity with the variation of furnace temperature (reaction temperature) was investigated. The validated simulator was used to optimize the unit operating conditions to obtain the desired product specifications. The optimum value of fuel oil yield, gasoline yield, viscosity and temperature were 91. 51, 6. 18, 79. 6 cSt and 824 °F, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Oilsands bitumen is an {{extremely}} important source of energy for North America. However, due {{to the presence of}} large molecules such as asphaltenes, the density and viscosity of the bitumen recovered from these sands are much higher than those of conventional crude oil. As a result the extracted bitumen has to be diluted with expensive solvents, or thermochemically upgraded in large, capital-intensive conventional upgrading facilities prior to pipeline transport. This study demonstrates that globally abundant natural zeolites such as clinoptilolite from Saint Clouds, New Mexico and Ca-chabazite from Bowie, Arizona can be used as very effective reagents for cracking and <b>visbreaking</b> of oilsands bitumen. Natural zeolite cracked oilsands bitumen products are highly recoverable (up to ~ 83 %) using light hydrocarbons such as pentane, which indicates substantial conversion of heavier fractions to lighter components. The resultant liquid products are much less viscous, and have lighte...|$|E
40|$|An in-line process rheometer, {{employing}} a proven shear-stress transducer, {{was designed and}} built for polymer melts. The entire process stream runs through the rheometer, giving it a much faster response time than conventional side-stream models. The possibility of using the in-line rheometer for dynamic mechanical analysis was investigated and methods were developed to obtain the complex modulus {{over a wide range}} of frequencies with a single measurement. Measurement techniques for shear viscosity testing were also developed along with algorithms to compensate for the effects of process pressure and temperature. The rheometer was used as a viscosity sensor to provide feedback control for a polypropylene <b>visbreaking</b> process. A first order plus dead time model was used to model the process and the rheometer together, and typically had dead times of less than 60 s and a first order time constant of 15 s. Gain scheduling was incorporated into minimum variance and proportional-integral controllers to achieve closed-loop settling times of 200 s for viscosity setpoint changes and process disturbances...|$|E
