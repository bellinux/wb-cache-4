However, in 1914, the German {{government}} sent him and Karl Ferdinand Braun to the United States as technical advisor in a patent case involving Telefunken. The US Marconi Company was sue Telefunken for patent infringement, a case spurred by the British government in an attept to shut down transatlantic wireless telegraph between the US and Germany. The case stalled and then went moot when the United States entered the war, declaring Zenneck a Prisoner of War. He was dismissed only in 1920 when he could finally take over the professorship of experimental physics at the Technische Hochschule in Munich. In that time he resumed propagation studies, now with shortwaves and was first in Germany to study the Ionosphere with <b>vertical</b> <b>sounding</b> at his station at Kochel/Bavaria. From the 1930s, Zenneck directed the Deutsches Museum in Munich, and rebuilt it after World War II.

Main ionosphere characteristics from <b>vertical</b> <b>sounding</b> data at IZMIRAN Voeikovo station in February 2013 {{were compared with}} IRI- 2012 model calculation results. 2688 model values and 1866 real values of f 0 F 2, f 0 E, hmF 2, hmE were processed. E and F 2 layers critical frequency (f 0 E, f 0 F 2) and the maximum altitudes (hmF 2, hmE) were determined from the ionograms. Vertical profiles of the electron concentration were restored with IRI- 2012 model by measured frequency and height. The model calculation was also made without {{the inclusion of the}} real <b>vertical</b> <b>sounding</b> data. Monthly averages and standard deviations (σ) for the parameters f 0 F 2, f 0 E, hmF 2, hmE for each hour of the day were calculated according to the <b>vertical</b> <b>sounding</b> and model values. Model applicability conditions for automated processing of ionograms for subauroral ionosphere were determined. Initial IRI- 2012 model can be applied in the sub-auroral ionograms processing at daytime with undisturbed conditions in the absence of sporadic ionization.

40|$|Oblique {{backscatter}} sounding is {{a powerful}} tool for detecting and monitoring the ionosphere continuously at a remote distance. High-frequency (HF) backscatter ionograms provide the amplitudes of backscatter signals with respect to group path or time delay against operating frequency.

Quantitative comparisons between the <b>vertical</b> <b>sounding</b> measurements and the inversion results obtained from oblique backscatter sounding indicate that the new algorithm enables us to overcome the instability issue that traditional inversion algorithm faces and output reliable information of ionospheric inversion with satisfactory efficiency, thus providing a robust alternative for ionospheric detection based on oblique backscatter ionograms especially when the ionosphere is calm with slow changes...|$|E

40|$|We have {{developed}} a method to interpret potential fields, which obtains 1 D models by inverting <b>vertical</b> <b>soundings</b> of potential field data. The <b>vertical</b> <b>soundings</b> are built through upward continuation of potential field data, measured on either a profile or a surface. The method assumes a forward problem consisting of a volume partitioned in layers, each of them homogeneous and horizontally finite, but with the density changing versus depth. The continuation errors, increasing with the altitude, are automatically handled by determining the coefficients of a third-order polynomial function of the altitude. Due to the finite size of the source volume, we need a priori information about the total horizontal extent of the volume, which is estimated by boundary analysis and optimized by a Markov chain process. For each sounding, a 1 D inverse problem is independently solved by a nonnegative least-squares algorithm. Merging of the several inverted models finally yields approximate 2 D or 3 D models that are, however, shown to generate a good fit to the measured data. The method is applied to synthetic models, producing good results for either perfect or continued data. Even for real data, i. e., the gravity data of a sedimentary basin in Nevada, the results are interesting, and they are consistent with previous interpretation, based on 3 D gravity inversion constrained by two gamma-gamma density logs...|$|R
