5000|$|Phototypesetting {{machines}} project characters onto {{film for}} offset printing. In 1949 the Photon Corporation in Cambridge, Mass. developed equipment {{based on the}} Lumitype of Rene Higonnet and Louis Moyroud. The Lumitype-Photon was first used to set a complete published book in 1953, and for newspaper work in 1954. [...] Mergenthaler produced the Linofilm using a different design, and Monotype produced Monophoto. Other companies followed with products that included Alphatype and <b>Varityper.</b>|$|E
50|$|Microgramma is a {{sans serif}} font which was {{designed}} by Aldo Novarese and Alessandro Butti for the Nebiolo Type Foundry in 1952. It became popular for use with technical illustrations in the 1960s and was a favourite of graphic designers by the early seventies, its uses ranging from publicity and publication design to packaging, largely because of its availability as a Letraset typeface. Early typesetters (like the AM <b>Varityper)</b> also incorporated it.|$|E
5000|$|Hell never {{finished}} high school, instead moving to New York City {{to make his}} way as a poet. In New York he met fellow young poet David Giannini, and moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico for several months, where Giannini and Meyers co-founded Genesis:Grasp. They used an AM <b>VariTyper</b> with changeable fonts to publish the magazine. They began publishing books and magazines, but decided to go their separate ways in 1971, after which Hell created and published Dot Books.|$|E

He then makes pasteups of each page and shoots them with a home-built copy camera to make negatives. The negatives are then used to make offset printing plates using direct solar energy by exposing them to the sun. The plates are then mounted into a small offset printing press and thus used to print the pages of The Match!.|$|E

50|$|In 1967 Ed Benguiat {{licensed}} {{the design}} from ATF and re-drew the {{face for the}} Photo-Lettering Corporation. When the International Typeface Corporation (ITC) was formed in 1971 it not only issued this design as ITC Souvenir but hired Benguiat to draw additional weights. He even added swashes for each variant, thus increasing its attractiveness. It was the bold and demi-bold weights that subsequently achieved a ubiquitous popularity, leading to it being made available for photocomposition by all the leading producers under the name Souvenir by Alphatype, Berthold, Compugraphic, Dymo, Harris, Star/Photon, Mergenthaler, Monotype, <b>Varityper,</b> while it was called Sovran by Graphic Systems Inc.|$|E
50|$|The journal was {{originally}} simply typed and printed by Sciences Nat {{on a small}} stencil duplicating machine which was rotated by hand with a crank. From 1974, it was produced by photocopying on a Rank Xerox machine. In 1977, a small Gestetner duplicator was obtained. During this time, pages were simply stapled together. From 1978 the typing was done on a <b>Varityper</b> which made it necessary to type the whole text twice. In 1979 a more advanced offset printer allowed colours printing for the first time. In 1980, 8 colour plates were produced which placed it {{at the head of}} entomological journals worldwide judged by quality of the illustrations. From 1984, the Bulletin was printed by a professional company. Each issue had from 8 (first issue) to 60 pages (double issue 75-76). Some errors also occurred: all pages of issue 80 are marked 79. Nearly all the articles were written in French, nearly all with figures, and (after 1980) most of them with colour photos.|$|E
50|$|Sensing {{that the}} {{electronics}} industry {{was in its}} infancy and poised to expand, the two founders established the company in 1981, initially operating in the phototypesetting industry. TeleTypesetting {{was one of the}} first companies to produce a hardware and software interface between personal computers such as the Apple II and IBM PS/2 and numerous models of phototypesetting machines such as the Compugraphic Compuwriter and CompEdit, and <b>Varityper</b> EPICS, Comp/Set and Comp/Edit.TeleTypesetting Co. created a package called MicroSetter, composed of a desk accessory, cables, conversion software, and connectivity software, which provided computers equipped with it the capability to connect to phototypesetting machines. MicroSetter was compatible with numerous desktop publishing applications such as Ready,Set,Go, Page Maker, Microsoft Word, MacWrite, and MacDraw.Use of personal computers took advantage of functions such as spell checking and printing on plain paper prior to printing on expensive phototypesetting paper which could not easily be corrected after the photographic process was completed thereby saving time and expense while providing more accurate results.From the MicroSetter product line evolved the T-Script PostScript interpreter (also referred to in the industry as a Raster image processor) which converted output from popular PostScript based WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) programs such as PageMaker, Microsoft Word and MacWrite to non PostScript printers which were much more economical at the time. This provided the user the ability to see the document on the screen as it would appear on the printer.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 The Purpose of the Study The central {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the common competency elements deemed necessary for entry-level vocational certification and to develop these elements into groups that would serve as a basis for use in an occupational competency test. Questions to be answered from the responses to the questionnaire were: can essential competencies common to all business teachers be identified, are there significant differences in the competencies needed by teachers in the three cluster areas, can inservice business education teachers identify those competencies essential to successful teaching, and can suitable groups of competencies be established as a resource bank for the development of performance-based competency tests. Procedures The construction of the occupational competence questionnaire was accomplished through the use of the Oregon Board of Education cluster guides, review of related literature, and the expertise of business educators in secondary and post-secondary institutions within the state of Oregon. A mail survey questionnaire containing 75 occupational competencies with a five-point Likert scale was used for the study. The dependent variable was the score judgmentally assigned to each competency by business teachers. The population for the study utilized vocationally certified business education teachers currently teaching the major curriculum content of one of the three business education clusters. The sample consisted of 25 teachers from each of the three clusters [...] Accounting, Clerical, and Steno-Secretarial. Data were coded, keypunched, and verified from the returned questionnaires prior to processing. The Data The F statistic was used to analyze contrasts between the mean scores for each competency with the. 05 level of significance being used to determine if differences existed between cluster groups. A test of Least Significant Difference was used on rejected competencies where differences exceeded the ±. 50 factor loading. Further analysis was accomplished through the R-technique which was used to cluster the competencies according to factors. Factor titles were assigned, representative of the Oregon clusters, after the data were analyzed. Selected Findings The basic business occupation competencies were scored uniformly by each of the three cluster groups. Generally, there was disagreement as to the importance of factors as they became more specific for specialty occupations. Those competencies listed in Factor I, Basic Business Operations, showed the highest correlation of agreement. The ten highest ranking competencies, none of which could be considered skill development curriculum courses such as typewriting and shorthand, were contained in this factor. In total, 60 of the 75 competencies were judged to be acceptable to these clusters. Those competencies not normally a part of the business education curriculum in the majority of schools were rejected. Classic examples of minimal or unnecessary competence were (1) taking machine shorthand and (2) operation of the <b>Varityper.</b> Those competencies peculiar to accounting specialization tended to have the greatest difference as judged by the accounting instructors as compared to the business teachers in clerical and steno-secretarial curriculums. The use of computer technology was generally ranked low by all respondents...|$|E
