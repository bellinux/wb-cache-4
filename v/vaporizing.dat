5|$|In addition, the <b>vaporizing</b> {{metal and}} flux {{materials}} expose welders to dangerous gases and particulate matter. The smoke produced contains particles {{of various types}} of oxides. The size of the particles in question tends to influence the toxicity of the fumes, with smaller particles presenting a greater danger. Additionally, gases like carbon dioxide and ozone can form, which can prove dangerous if ventilation is inadequate. Some of the latest welding masks are fitted with an electric powered fan to help disperse harmful fumes.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene in}} which Terrell kills Jedda, a Regula scientist, by <b>vaporizing</b> him with a phaser was filmed in two takes. Winfield and the related actors first played out the scene; this footage became the {{background}} plate. A blue screen was wheeled onto the set and actor John Vargas, {{the recipient of the}} phaser blast, acted out his response to being hit with the energy weapon. A phaser beam element was placed on top of the background plate, and Vargas' shots were optically dissolved into an airbrushed disintegration effect which matched Vargas' position in every frame.|$|E
5|$|Her {{skills were}} in high demand and she formed many collaborations in Vienna, working with Ewald Schmidt on the {{modification}} of 's method of <b>vaporizing</b> polonium; with Marietta Blau on photographic emulsions of hydrogen rays; and with Hans Pettersson. In 1928, Pettersson asked her to analyze a sample of sea bottom sediment to determine its radium content. Because the lab she was working in was contaminated, she took the samples to the oceanographic laboratory at Bornö Marine Research Station on Stora Bornö in Gullmarsfjorden, Sweden, which would become her summer research destination for the next 12 years. Her analyses with Berta Karlik on the half-lives of uranium, thorium, and actinium decay identified radiometric dating and elemental alpha particle ranges. In 1933, Rona and Karlik won the Austrian Academy of Sciences Haitinger Prize.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{evaluated}} <b>vaporized</b> {{hydrogen peroxide}} {{as an alternative}} to formaldehyde for space biodecontamination in a containment level 3 laboratory suite. The laboratory air pressure during the biodecontamination process was maintained at a slightly negative pressure. This was done as a preventive measure to ensure that hazardous <b>vaporized</b> hydrogen peroxide would not escape during the process. Parameters such as temperature, relative humidity, <b>vaporized</b> hydrogen peroxide concentration, and pressure within the laboratory suite were monitored during the biodecontamination. The success of the decontamination process was validated using spores of G. stearothermophilus, the most resistant microorganism to <b>vaporized</b> hydrogen peroxide (Kokubo et al., 1998; Meszaros, 2005; Rickloff & Orelski, 1989).

5|$|Rushing {{through the}} University, Jack {{narrowly}} rescues Will from the falling debris. Will warns Jack he cannot simply repair the fracture then and there, {{as it would}} erase key future events and risk a time paradox. Passing a frozen Beth during a stutter, Jack reaches to unfreeze her, but hesitates and leaves. Reaching the Bradbury Pool, Jack and Will travel forward in time, only to find Paul and Monarch waiting for them. Paul is intent on either retrieving the CFR or destroying it. Jack fights and kills him. Hooking the CFR into his time machine, Will asks Jack to jumpstart it with chronon energy. The CFR activates and blasts the area with chronons, fixing the tear and <b>vaporizing</b> Paul. As Will examines the CFR, burnt out from the blast, Jack has a vision of his future self traveling {{to the end of}} time, and begins exhibiting symptoms of chronon syndrome.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{results were}} supplemented by the underground test data accumulated in the 1960s at the Nevada Test Site, {{as it was}} hoped that powerful explosions conducted in confined space might result in improved yields and heavier isotopes. Apart from traditional uranium charges, combinations of uranium with americium and thorium have been tried, as well as a mixed plutonium-neptunium charge, but they were less successful in terms of yield and was attributed to stronger losses of heavy isotopes due to enhanced fission rates in heavy-element charges. Product isolation was problematic as the explosions were spreading debris through melting and <b>vaporizing</b> the surrounding rocks at depths of 300–600 meters. Drilling to such depths to extract the products was both slow and inefficient in terms of collected volumes.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a new simple method for {{measuring}} the <b>vaporized</b> volume and to evaluate the outcome of high-power potassium-titanyl-phosphate (KTP) photoselective laser vaporization. A total of 65 patients, with a mean age of 67. 7 yr (range 53 to 85), were included in the primary analysis. The <b>vaporized</b> volume was calculated as the pre-operative volume minus the immediate postoperative volume plus the volume of the defect. For all patients, the subjective and objective parameters improved significantly after surgery. Six and 12 months after surgery, the group with a smaller <b>vaporized</b> volume (< 15 g) had a lower reduction of the mean International Prostate Symptom Score (P= 0. 006 and P= 0. 004) and quality of life index (P= 0. 006 and P= 0. 004) when compared to the group with a greater <b>vaporized</b> volume (≥ 15 g). There were no differences in the change of the maximum flow rate and post-void residual based on the <b>vaporized</b> volume. Our findings suggest that the subjective improvement, after a high-power KTP laser vaporization, may be dependent on the <b>vaporized</b> volume obtained after the procedure...|$|R
50|$|In {{chemistry}} and physics, volatility is quantified by {{the tendency of}} a substance to <b>vaporize.</b> Volatility {{is directly related to}} a substance's vapor pressure.

5|$|Depending on {{the path}} taken by the player, Jill's final {{encounter}} with Nicholai will differ. In one version of the events, Nicholai will attempt to start a gunfight with Jill, only to be taken by surprise by Nemesis. In another event, Nicholai will hijack Jill's intended escape chopper, and the player must choose to either reason with Nicholai or destroy the helicopter. If Jill negotiates with Nicholai, he reveals that he has killed the other supervisors and boasts about collecting the bounty placed on Jill by Umbrella before escaping. Regardless of Nicholai's fate, Jill makes {{her way to the}} rear yard and confronts Nemesis one last time. After an intense battle, Jill defeats Nemesis {{with the help of a}} prototype railgun before meeting up with Carlos and escaping the city via a helicopter. If the previous escape chopper was stolen by Nicholai, Jill and Carlos will instead meet up with S.T.A.R.S. Alpha Team's weapons specialist Barry Burton, who helps them escape in his own helicopter instead.

25|$|In the 1940s, Germany {{invented the}} liquid {{chlorobromomethane}} (CBM) {{for use in}} aircraft. It was more effective and slightly less toxic than carbon tetrachloride and was used until 1969. Methyl bromide was discovered as an extinguishing agent in the 1920s and was used extensively in Europe. It is a low-pressure gas that works by inhibiting the chain reaction of the fire and is the most toxic of the <b>vaporizing</b> liquids, used until the 1960s. The vapor and combustion by-products of all <b>vaporizing</b> liquids were highly toxic, and could cause death in confined spaces.|$|E
50|$|For all atomic spectroscopy, {{a sample}} must be <b>vaporized</b> and atomized. For atomic mass spectrometry, a sample {{must also be}} ionized. Vaporization, atomization, and {{ionization}} are often, but not always, accomplished with a single source. Alternatively, one source {{may be used to}} <b>vaporize</b> a sample while another is used to atomize (and possibly ionize). An example of this is laser ablation inductively-coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry, where a laser is used to <b>vaporize</b> a solid sample and an inductively-coupled plasma is used to atomize the vapor.|$|R

25|$|DMT is {{generally}} not active orally unless it is combined with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) such as a reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (RIMA), for example, harmaline. Without an MAOI, the body quickly metabolizes orally administered DMT, and it therefore has no hallucinogenic effect unless the dose exceeds monoamine oxidase's metabolic capacity. Other means of ingestion such as <b>vaporizing,</b> injecting, or insufflating the drug can produce powerful hallucinations {{for a short time}} (usually less than half an hour), as the DMT reaches the brain before it can be metabolized by the body's natural monoamine oxidase. Taking a MAOI prior to <b>vaporizing</b> or injecting DMT prolongs and potentiates the effects.|$|E
25|$|The <b>vaporizing</b> fuel {{injector}}, {{the third}} type, {{is similar to}} the air blast injector in that primary air is mixed with the fuel as it is injected into the combustion zone. However, the fuel-air mixture travels through a tube within the combustion zone. Heat from the combustion zone is transferred to the fuel-air mixture, <b>vaporizing</b> some of the fuel (mixing it better) before it is combusted. This method allows the fuel to be combusted with less thermal radiation, which helps protect the liner. However, the vaporizer tube may have serious durability problems with low fuel flow within it (the fuel inside of the tube protects the tube from the combustion heat).|$|E

50|$|The liquid feed (at {{the bottom}} {{left in the}} diagram) is pumped up to the {{reaction}} pressure (5-45 atm) and is joined by a stream of hydrogen-rich recycle gas. The resulting liquid-gas mixture is preheated by flowing through a heat exchanger. The preheated feed mixture is then totally <b>vaporized</b> and heated to the reaction temperature (495-520 °C) before the <b>vaporized</b> reactants enter the first reactor. As the <b>vaporized</b> reactants flow through the fixed bed of catalyst in the reactor, the major reaction is the dehydrogenation of naphthenes to aromatics (as described earlier herein) which is highly endothermic and results in a large temperature decrease between the inlet and outlet of the reactor. To maintain the required reaction temperature {{and the rate of}} reaction, the <b>vaporized</b> stream is reheated in the second fired heater before it flows through the second reactor. The temperature again decreases across the second reactor and the <b>vaporized</b> stream must again be reheated in the third fired heater before it flows through the third reactor. As the <b>vaporized</b> stream proceeds through the three reactors, the reaction rates decrease and the reactors therefore become larger. At the same time, the amount of reheat required between the reactors becomes smaller. Usually, three reactors are all that is required to provide the desired performance of the catalytic reforming unit.|$|R
25|$|Broaching is a {{machining}} operation used to cut keyways into shafts.

40|$|The {{acoustic}} {{characteristics of}} microbubbles created from <b>vaporized</b> submicron perfluorocarbon droplets with fluorosurfactant coating are examined. Utilizing ultra-high-speed optical imaging, the acoustic response of individual microbubbles to low-intensity diagnostic ultrasound was observed on clinically relevant time scales {{of hundreds of}} milliseconds after vaporization. It {{was found that the}} <b>vaporized</b> droplets oscillate non-linearly and exhibit a resonant bubble size shift and increased damping relative to uncoated gas bubbles due to the presence of coating material. Unlike the commercially available lipid-coated ultrasound contrast agents, which may exhibit compression-only behavior, <b>vaporized</b> droplets may exhibit expansion-dominated oscillations. It was further observed that the non-linearity of the acoustic response of the bubbles was comparable to that of SonoVue microbubbles. These results suggest that <b>vaporized</b> submicron perfluorocarbon droplets possess the acoustic characteristics necessary for their potential use as ultrasound contrast agents in clinical practice...|$|R

This flame provides sufficient heat to keep the candle burning via a self-sustaining chain of events: the heat of the flame melts the top of the mass of solid fuel; the liquefied fuel then moves upward through the wick via capillary action; the liquefied fuel finally <b>vaporizes</b> to burn within the candle's flame.|$|R
