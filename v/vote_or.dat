5|$|Several further {{protections for}} voters are {{contained}} in Section 11. Section 11(a) prohibits any person acting under color of law from refusing or failing to allow a qualified person to <b>vote</b> <b>or</b> to count a qualified voter's ballot. Similarly, Section 11(b) prohibits any person from intimidating, harassing, or coercing another person for voting or attempting to vote. Two provisions in Section 11 address voter fraud: Section 11(c) prohibits people from knowingly submitting a false voter registration application to vote in a federal election, and Section 11(e) prohibits voting twice in a federal election.|$|E

5|$|The Constitution of Croatia {{mandates}} that the parliament consists {{of at least}} 100 members {{and no more than}} 160 members, elected by a direct secret ballot for four-year terms. Parliamentary elections are held within 60 days following the term's expiration or parliamentary dissolution (the latter takes place with a parliamentary no-confidence <b>vote</b> <b>or</b> if the parliament fails to approve a state budget within 120days after the government submits one for approval), and a new parliament must convene within 20 days after the elections.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} results determined which political parties were eligible to submit candidates for Indonesia's first direct presidential election, {{which was held}} on 5 July. Only parties that received {{five percent of the}} popular <b>vote</b> <b>or</b> three percent of seats in the People's Representative Council could submit candidates. Parties that did not meet these criteria had to join with other parties to meet at least one criterion.|$|E
5|$|The {{presiding}} consul began each {{meeting with}} a speech on an issue, and then referred the issue to the senators, who discussed the matter by order of seniority. Unimportant matters could be voted on by a voice <b>vote</b> <b>or</b> by a show of hands, while important votes resulted in a physical division of the house, with senators voting by taking a place {{on either side of}} the chamber. Any vote was always between a proposal and its negative.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the primary}} election, Nordquist {{received}} 1406 of the 1934 <b>votes</b> cast, <b>or</b> 72.7%.

50|$|In voting methods, {{tactical}} <b>voting</b> (<b>or</b> strategic <b>voting</b> <b>or</b> sophisticated <b>voting</b> <b>or</b> insincere <b>voting)</b> occurs, {{in elections}} {{with more than}} two candidates, when a voter supports another candidate more strongly than their sincere preference {{in order to prevent}} an undesirable outcome.|$|R
50|$|After an {{estimated}} total of 1.6 million text votes gathered since December 23, {{the start of}} the open voting, Ruben Gonzaga was declared the winner with 506,402 <b>votes</b> <b>or</b> 32.17%.

5|$|Treating. Treating is {{the act of}} corruptly giving or providing, or paying {{in whole}} or part for, any food, drink, refreshment, cigarette, {{entertainment}} or other thing, or any money or ticket or other means to enable such things to be obtained, in order to corruptly influence a person to <b>vote</b> <b>or</b> refrain from voting, or to induce the person to attend an election meeting, or to reward him for having done so. The penalty is a fine of up to $5,000 or imprisonment not exceeding three years or both, and the disqualifications referred to above.|$|E
5|$|As is {{the case}} for most Brazilian {{football}} clubs, Atlético Mineiro's by-law defines the club as a not-for-profit public utility organization, formed by associates (sócios). The club's administrative powers are the General Assembly, the Deliberative Council, the Board, the Fiscal Council and the Ethics and Discipline Council. The General Assembly, composed of all associates, elects the Deliberative Council among its members every three years, which in turn elects and removes the club's Board, responsible for the executive management of the club. Season ticket-holders and participants of the Galo na Veia affiliation programme, called sócios-torcedores, are not full club associates and cannot <b>vote</b> <b>or</b> be elected.|$|E
5|$|In Belarus, {{the right}} to vote in {{elections}} and plebiscites is extended to those who are above the age of eighteen. During elections and plebiscites, a citizen can <b>vote</b> <b>or</b> not vote without any consequences from the government. The Constitution describes two methods of preventing a citizen from voting. First, a court can issue an order stating that the citizen does not have the mental capacity to understand and to cast a ballot. Second, a person being held in detention or confined in a prison during an election cannot cast a ballot. The Constitution says nothing about the voting rights of those who have served their prison terms, nor does it state how those citizens gain the rights back.|$|E
5000|$|After an {{estimated}} total of 1.7 million votes cast since May 31, {{the start of}} the open voting, Ejay Falcon was declared the winner with 620,924 <b>votes</b> <b>or</b> 36.31%.

Rosenblatt came in fifth place with 4,506 <b>votes,</b> <b>or</b> three percent of the total vote. Klebe came in third place with 215 <b>votes,</b> <b>or</b> two percent of the total vote. Because no U.S. Labor Party {{candidate}} received more than 7,500 votes in the general election, the U.S. Labor Party lost its major-party status after the 1978 election.|$|R
50|$|Kolterman won the November 2014 general {{election}} with 7971 <b>votes,</b> <b>or</b> 80.5% of the total. Tesar obtained 1937 <b>votes,</b> <b>or</b> 19.5%.|$|R
5|$|Once a vote occurred, and {{a measure}} passed, {{he could do}} nothing, since his promise to {{physically}} interpose his person against the senators was now meaningless. In addition, during a couple of instances {{between the end of}} the Second Punic War in 201 BC {{and the beginning of the}} Social War in 91 BC, although they had no legal power to do so, several Consuls were known to have vetoed acts of the Senate. Ultimately, if there was no veto, and the matter was of minor importance, it could be voted on by a voice <b>vote</b> <b>or</b> by a show of hands. If there was no veto, and the matter was of a significant nature, there was usually a physical division of the house, where senators voted by taking a place on either side of the chamber.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} {{signed off}} on all of Zahorchak's proposals except for his call to remove four principals in exchange for up to $15million in federal grants that mandate leadership or staff changes {{as a condition for}} receiving the money. Zahorchak proposed transferring the principals from the Allen and Dieruff high schools, Central Elementary and Harrison-Morton Middle School to the district's nonprofit foundation, then use the federal grant money to open a special school for advanced placement and honors students. The committee did not <b>vote</b> <b>or</b> comment on the matter on October 14. Zahorchak said he still planned to pursue the plan but apologized for speaking to the media about it on October 12 before discussing it with the district and staff, a move that caused angst among the staff and some members of the public.|$|E
5|$|With Kirchner leading all the pre-election polls {{by a wide}} margin, her challengers {{focused on}} forcing her into a ballotage. To win in a single round, a presidential {{candidate}} in Argentina needs either more than 45% of the <b>vote,</b> <b>or</b> 40% of the vote and a lead of more than 10 percentage points over the runner-up. However, with 13 challengers splitting the vote, Kirchner won the election decisively {{in the first round}} with just over 45% of the vote, followed by 23% for Elisa Carrió (candidate for the Civic Coalition) and 17% for former Economy Minister Roberto Lavagna. Kirchner was popular among the suburban working class and the rural poor, while Carrió and Lavagna both received more support from the urban middle class. Kirchner lost the election in the large cities of Buenos Aires and Rosario.|$|E

50|$|Voter turnout for the 2016 General Election in Lorain was 24,198 {{out of a}} {{registered}} 40,885 voters, or a 59.19% turnout rate.

Other candidates had marginal amounts of write-in votes; additionally, {{it is possible that}} some voters did not select a presidential candidate when casting their ballot.|$|R
5|$|Bribery. Doing {{any one of}} {{a number}} of acts to induce a person to <b>vote</b> <b>or</b> refrain from voting or to reward him for having done so, such as giving or lending money; and giving or {{procuring}} an office or employment, amounts to bribery. It is also bribery for a person to procure or promise to procure that a voter exercise his vote in a certain way or that a candidate be elected as President in return for some inducement; to give money to someone else, knowing that he will use the money for bribery at an election; to accept an inducement for voting or not voting or agreeing to do so; and to induce a person to consent to being nominated as a candidate, or refrain or withdraw from being a candidate in return for some inducement. The penalty is a fine of up to $5,000 or imprisonment not exceeding three years or both; and disqualification from being registered as a voter, voting at any election, or being elected to Parliament or the office of President for seven years.|$|E
5|$|In 1846 the New York Tribune sent Fuller to Europe, {{specifically}} England and Italy, as {{its first}} female foreign correspondent. She traveled from Boston to Liverpool in August on the Cambria, a vessel that used both sail and steam to make the journey in ten days and sixteen hours. Over {{the next four years}} she provided the Tribune with thirty-seven reports. She interviewed many prominent writers including George Sand and Thomas Carlylewhom she found disappointing because of his reactionary politics, among other things. George Sand had previously been an idol of hers, but Fuller was disappointed when Sand chose not to run for the French National Assembly, saying that women were not ready to <b>vote</b> <b>or</b> to hold political office. Fuller was also given a letter of introduction to Elizabeth Barrett by Cornelius Mathews, but did not meet her at that time, because Barrett had just eloped with Robert Browning.|$|E
5|$|Meltzer {{began the}} Hall of Fame by {{choosing}} {{a list of}} 122 inaugural inductees in 1996. Since then, wrestlers from past and present, others employed in the professional wrestling industry, and wrestling journalists and historians have been selected by Meltzer to cast secret ballots to determine annual groups of inductees. Voting criteria include {{the length of time}} spent in wrestling, historical significance, ability to attract viewers, and wrestling ability. Inductees must have at least 15 years of experience in the wrestling business or be over 35 years old and have 10 years of experience. To gain membership in the hall, potential inductees must receive 60% support on the ballots from their geographic region. Any person that gets less than 10% of the vote is eliminated from the ballot. If a person fails to get inducted 15 years after being put on the ballot, they must get 50% of the <b>vote</b> <b>or</b> be eliminated. There are 211 inductees, including the seven tag teams.|$|E
50|$|Clancy {{garnered}} 29,637 <b>votes</b> <b>or</b> 55% of {{the vote}} vs Republican Kathleen E. Caron's 24,663 <b>votes</b> <b>or</b> 45% of the total votes cast.|$|R

5|$|Unlike many English, Flood and Grattan {{were also}} proponents of Catholic emancipation, and under their {{leadership}} the Irish Parliament overturned {{a number of}} the restrictions on the rights of Catholics, although they continued to be unable to <b>vote</b> <b>or</b> hold elected offices. When the French Revolution broke out in the early 1790s, Catholics and middle-class Protestants united to form the Society of United Irishmen. They successfully extracted additional rights, although there was some Protestant resistance to the idea of full Catholic suffrage due to their overwhelming numerical majority. The more radical elements favouring Irish independence found a leader in Theobald Wolfe Tone, who went to France for support from the revolutionaries there that led to an aborted attempt to invade Ireland in 1796. The failed invasion led the government of the Earl of Camden to round up leaders of the United Irishmen and attempt to disarm the Catholic populace. Use of these tactics was made possible in part by the passage of an Insurrection Act, giving the administration broad police powers, and also by the suspension of habeas corpus in October 1796.|$|E
25|$|Undue influence. When {{a person}} {{makes use of}} or threatens {{to make use of}} force, {{violence}} or restraint, or inflicts or threatens to inflict temporal or spiritual injury, damage, harm or loss on a person to induce him or her to <b>vote</b> <b>or</b> refrain from voting, or to punish him or her for having done so; or uses abduction, duress or some fraudulent scheme to impede or prevent a person's free exercise of his or her <b>vote,</b> <b>or</b> to compel or induce him or her to <b>vote</b> <b>or</b> refrain from voting, this amounts to the offence of undue influence.|$|E
