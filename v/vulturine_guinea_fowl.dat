40|$|The study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the external and internal qualities of eggs from local varieties of <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> (Common breed, Bonaparte, White, Grey and Black) of Benin. Twenty â€“four (24) <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> of <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> of each variety aged of 38 weeks were reared in station and five new-laid eggs were collected daily and analyzed weekly by variety during 8 weeks. It appears that White <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> lay the heaviest eggs while Bonaparte laid the smallest (P< 0. 05). According to the egg size, White <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> were the best followed by Black <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl,</b> Common <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> and Grey <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl.</b> Eggshell color was mostly red bright and dark red. The predominant bright red eggs were obtained in black <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> (55 %), Bonaparte (42. 5 %) and Common (40 %), while the dark red were mostly recorded in White (45 %) and Grey <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> (42. 5 %). The slight red shell eggs with grits were only obtained in White variety (2. 5 %) and mottled eggs were produced by the Grey <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> (25 %) followed by Bonaparte <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> (20 %). Furthermore, egg from white guinea showed the best physical quality that are egg white thickness, egg yolk thickness, egg white weight and egg yolk weight (respectively 6. 82 mm 17. 8 mm; 13 g and 22 g). The most colored egg yolk was found in black <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> while the less colored was observed in the common greed.

40|$|Good feeding for <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> Cue: Our next report {{comes from}} Blantyre in Malawi, where Patrick Mphaka {{reports on the}} growing {{popularity}} of <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> among village poultry keepers. One reason for this popularity is a reported resistance of <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> in Malawi to a major poultry disease, Newcastle disease, which every year has a devastating impact on unvaccinated poultry flocks. While this reported resistance may reflect a greater hardiness in <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> to some common diseases, <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> are, in fact vulnerable to Newcastle disease, in common with nearly all poultry species, and those keeping <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> should follow appropriate steps to keep their birds disease free. IN:		?Traditionally, popular domestic birds? OUT:		?. Newcastle which troubles our chickens. ? DUR?N		 5 ? 00 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Village headman Magombo Ngondo ending that report on a community <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> project in his village. Please note that while in his experience, <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> are more resistant to Newcastle disease, veterinary advice suggests that <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> are, in fact, vulnerable to the disease, in common with other poultry. Transcript Mphaka	Traditionally, popular domestic birds kept by most people here are chickens. These have their advantages, and, naturally, their disadvantages. One of the most menacing problems for the poor lot of chicken keepers is the seasonal outbreak of Newcastle disease. It is a big problem for most people because though easily preventable when appropriate vaccination is supplied to the birds, most of them can not afford it. The result is death en masse of chickens once or twice each year. 		Due to this problem, most people are turning their attention to alternative birds. To this end, the introduction of <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> in some areas has become handy. To date, there are no locally known diseases which attack <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls.</b> This quality directly solves the problem most bird keepers have been having with chickens. Since the retail price of <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> is higher than that of chickens, it has not been easy for most people to start rearing <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls.</b> There are some instances, however, where Non-Governmental organizations have intervened in introducing the birds to some communities. One such community is in Magombo Ngondo village in Traditional Authority Kuntaja in Blantyre district. The community here was given some twenty birds to keep on community level and that as the birds multiply, they can start sharing amongst themselves. I paid the village headman a visit {{to learn more about the}} feeding practices, among other relevant issues. Ngondo	[Vernac] As far as feeding is concerned, we provide them with food two or three times each day within the stall before we release them to fend for themselves outside. In addition, we also ensure that the water containers which you see there are cleaned and filled with clean water each day. We feed these <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> with maize bran, sorghum, or sometimes we look for white ants, so that we are sure that when they are going to fend for themselves, they have already had enough food. Mphaka	You told me earlier that sometimes these birds are 100 % stall fed, and sometimes, like this period, they are on semi-free range. Would you elaborate on that? Ngondo	We stall feed them 100 % when we have just planted various crops in the fields. This is done to ensure that the planted seeds grow without being eaten away by the <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls.</b> As you know, these birds are very notorious with seed, especially maize. Once the seedlings are of good health, and can not be destroyed anymore by the <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls,</b> we then put them on semi-free range. Mphaka	These <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> belong to the community. How does the community assist you in taking care of the <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> in terms of feeding them and other things? Ngondo	The community assists in several ways. They take turns in making sure that the inside and outside of the <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> house is clean. They are also the ones who do the actual feeding of the <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls.</b> Mphaka	Would you like to tell me the difference in terms of production of eggs between the times when you are giving them food inside their house, and when you are allowing them to go out free range? Ngondo	They lay eggs more continuously when they are on semi-free range. We think this is because they are able to supplement on the food we give them inside the stall. Again, we think that the space and fresh air which they enjoy outside, give them more freedom which make them healthier. Mphaka	What would you say is the advantage of rearing <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> over chickens? Ngondo	<b>Guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> are better than chickens when it comes to diseases. <b>Guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> are resistant to Newcastle which troubles our chickens. End of track.

40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} {{to determine whether the}} <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> are susceptible to Infectious Bursal Disease Virus (IBDV). A total of 60 <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> keets were used for the study. They were administered the inoculum through the intraocular route. 30 <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> keets served as the control group (A) while, the other 30 served as the experimentally infected group (B). The only clinical signs observed in about 10 keets were mild depression and transient loss of appetite that did not last more that 24 h. The morphometric observations also indicated that the relative weights in the two groups (A and B) showed no Significant difference (p> 0. 05) in both the Control (group A) and Infected (group B) keets. It was concluded that <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> are not susceptible to IBDV but they could severe as carriers, which would spread the virus to other poultry species if reared together with them...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Morphometric and {{macroscopic}} {{studies were}} carried out on the respiratory system of the West African <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> (WAGF). The gross anatomical study revealed that the laryngeal mound of the <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> was roughly triangular in shape extending rostrally {{from the base of the}} skull and continues caudally as the trachea. It had only one row of caudally pointing papillae. The larger cartilaginous rings of the trachea bifurcated at the ventrum while the smaller cartilaginous rings did not bifurcate. The investigation also revealed that the lung of the adult <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> had the shape of a trapezium. The morphometric result obtained revealed that the mean (Â±SE) life weights of the male and female adult <b>guinea</b> <b>fowls</b> were 1. 357 kg and 1. 225 kg, respectively. The mean (Â±SE) weights of the respiratory system were 9. 638 g and 8. 500 g for male and female birds respectively. The mean (Â±SE) lengths from the thoracic inlet to the tracheal bifurcation for male and female birds were 3. 26 cm and 4. 40 cm, respectively. The male <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> was significantly heavier (p 0. 05) in the mean weights of the respiratory system of the male and female birds. The analysis also showed that the length of the thoracic inlet to tracheal bifurcation for female adult <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> was significantly longer (p < 0. 05) than that of the male bird.

40|$|Objective Our study {{provides}} information on phenotypes of local chickens and <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> and their body measures {{as well as on}} major genes in local chickens in northern Ghana. Methods Qualitative and morphometric traits were recorded on 788 local chickens and 394 <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> in urban households in Tamale, Ghana. Results The results showed considerable variation of color traits and numerous major genes in local chickens, while color variations and related genotypes in <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> were limited. In local chickens, white was preferred for plumage, whereas dark colors were preferred for beak and shanks. More than half of the chickens carried at least one major gene, but the contributions of single gene carriers were low. All calculated allele frequencies were significantly lower than their expected Mendelian allele frequencies. We observed higher mean body weight and larger linear body measures in male as compared to female chickens. In female chickens, we detected a small effect of major genes on body weight and chest circumference. In addition, we found some association between feather type and plumage color. In <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl,</b> seven distinct plumage colors were observed, of which pearl grey pied and pearl grey were the most prevalent. Male pearl grey pied <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> were inferior to pearl grey and white <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> in terms of body weight, body length and chest circumference; their shank length was lower than that of pearl grey fowl. Conclusion Considerable variation in qualitative traits of local chickens may be indicative of genetic diversity within local chicken populations, but major genes were rare. In contrast, phenotypic and genetic diversity in local <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> is limited. Broader genetic diversity studies and evaluation of trait preferences of local poultry producers are required for the design of appropriate breeding programs...|$|R

40|$|The study {{describes}} {{the steps of}} spermiogenesis and stages of seminiferous epithelial cycle in breeding guinea cocks. Sections embedded in epoxy resin were employed for {{the determination of the}} stages of seminiferous epithelial cycle in the <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl.</b> Acrosomic granules aided in identifying the initial steps of spermiogenesis, whereas nuclear morphological changes facilitated the identification of subsequent stages. Eleven steps of spermiogenesis and nine stages of seminiferous epithelium were recognized in the <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> testis. Three spermatogonial types, namely, spermatogonial A, B and intermediate were identified in the <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> seminiferous epithelium. Spermatogonial A and preleptotene spermatocytes had the largest (P[*][*] 0. 05) differences were found among birds in spermatogonial A and intermediate spermatogonial nuclei diameters. Spermatogonial B, preleptotene primary spermatocyte, type I spermatocyte (primary spermatocyte in prophase I), and round spermatid nuclei diameters were, however, bigger (P[*]<[*] 0. 05) in some birds than others.

40|$|International audienceIn {{line with}} the Gifu University's {{initiative}} to map the Japanese quail genome, a total of 100 Japanese quail microsatellite markers isolated in our laboratory were evaluated in a population of 20 unrelated quails randomly sampled from a colony of wild quail origin. Ninety-eight markers were polymorphic {{with an average of}} 3. 7 alleles per locus and a mean heterozygosity of 0. 423. To determine the utility of these markers for comparative genome mapping in Phasianidae, cross-species amplification of all the markers was tested with chicken and <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> DNA. Amplification products similar in size to the orthologous loci in quail were observed in 42 loci in chicken and 20 loci in <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl.</b> Of the cross-reactive markers, 57. 1 % in chicken and 55. 0 % in <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> were polymorphic when tested in 20 birds from their respective populations. Five of 15 Â markers that could cross-amplify Japanese quail, chicken, and <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> DNA were polymorphic in all three species. Amplification of orthologous loci was confirmed by sequencing 10 loci each from chicken and <b>guinea</b> <b>fowl</b> and comparing with them the corresponding quail sequence. The microsatellite markers reported would serve as a useful resource base for genetic mapping in quail and comparative mapping in Phasianidae...|$|R
