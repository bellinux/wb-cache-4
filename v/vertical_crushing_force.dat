The focus of the present theoretical prediction is to calculate the mean <b>crushing</b> <b>force</b> and maximum <b>crushing</b> <b>force</b> during the folding process subjected to axial impact loading. Then, the effect of hole size to the crushing response of square crash box structures was also evaluated. For validation, an explicit non-linear commercial finite element code LS-DYNA was used to predict the response of the structures subjected to axial crushing. It was found that results of numerical method and theoretical prediction were in good agreement. The results showed that, by inserting holes at corners, the folding can be controlled to be always started from the hole, and peak crush load on the first fold can be reduced significantly. Meanwhile, the decreasing of mean <b>crushing</b> <b>force</b> is insignificant compared to the one without holes. Hence, the characteristic of impact energy absorption in a progressive buckling can be improved, the damage in passenger compartment can be minimized, and the deceleration level can be kept in safe level to prevent injury of the passenger...|$|R
