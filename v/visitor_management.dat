5|$|Though {{the main}} focus is {{protection}} of wildlife, the reserve management has also encouraged ecotourism. In 1993, a training course covering natural history, <b>visitor</b> <b>management</b> and park interpretation was introduced to train nature guides. A second course followed in 1995 which recruited more guides for the same purpose. This allowed {{the staff of the}} reserve, previously preoccupied with guiding the visitors, to carry out management activities uninterrupted. Additionally, the Indian government has organised workshops on ecotourism in Corbett National Park and Garhwal region to ensure that the local citizens profit from tourism while the park remains protected.|$|E
5|$|Having raised £100,000, the Cotswold Canals Trust lodged {{the money}} with the Waterways Trust, {{in the hope}} that it could be used as match funding for any grants that might be received. Andy Stumpf became the {{full-time}} Regeneration Programme Manager, working on a major bid application to the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) to finance the restoration, and the canal was visited by Charles, Prince of Wales, in his capacity as Patron of the Waterways Trust. A Heritage Survey, which cost £60,000 and was funded by the Inland Waterways Association, was carried out, as was a Community Development Plan and a <b>Visitor</b> <b>Management</b> Strategy, costing another £30,000, all of which were pre-requisites for the main HLF bid. By the time the bid was ready for submission, the HLF were under pressure for the funds they had, and asked British Waterways, who were heading up the application, to break the bid and the project into smaller phases. At the end of 2003, a provisional grant of £11.3 million was awarded by the HLF, to enable the restoration of the Stroudwater Navigation between Stonehouse and Wallbridge, and the Thames and Severn Canal between Wallbridge and Brimscombe Port. An additional £2.9 million was received from the European Inter-Regional budget for this first phase. By the time the grant was awarded in January 2006, it had risen to £11.9 million, and a further £6 million of match funding was received from the South West of England Regional Development Agency.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} provide a {{suitable}} structure to drive the restoration forwards, the Cotswold Canals Partnership was established in 2001, drawing together people representing the Proprietors of the Stroudwater Navigation, the Cotswold Canals Trust, councils at district and county level, {{and a number of}} other interested parties. In 2002, the waterway was identified as being of high priority in the Association of Inland Navigation Authorities report entitled Vision for Strategic Enhancement of Britain's Inland Navigation Network, and was one of several new projects highlighted at British Waterways' Unlocked and Unlimited conference held in March. The estimated cost of the project was £82 million. Having raised £100,000, the Trust lodged the money with the Waterways Trust, in the hope that it could be used as match funding for any grants that might be received.

40|$|Despite growing {{interest}} in understanding the sacred site <b>visitor</b> experience <b>management,</b> scholars have predominantly explored the phenomenon from the visitor’s perspective. There is very little exploration from the managerial perspectives, given that decisions regarding {{the nature of the}} experience and product and service delivery strategies aimed at providing a diversity of visitors with rewarding, satisfying and memorable experiences solely depends on these individuals, whose personal attributes may play a fundamental role. In this case their spirituality, that may either implicitly or explicitly influence <b>visitor</b> experience <b>management</b> strategies and their implementations have not received attention in the religious and pilgrimage tourism scholarship. Especially, given its relevance in providing an understanding in to the rather complex and sensitive sacred site <b>visitor</b> experience <b>management</b> phenomenon. Thus, representing a significant gap in literature the current study seeks to fill, through an exploration {{of the ways in which}} the spirituality of leaders at a diverse category of Irish sacred sites influences <b>visitor</b> experience <b>management</b> at these holy places and the implications for resource development and visitor satisfaction. Through qualitative interviews with 23 leaders. An analysis of these interviews provides participants own words that reveal how the spirituality of leaders at different levels in the organisations influences <b>visitor</b> experience <b>management</b> strategies and their implementations, revealing that the more spiritual the leader the more inclined they were to <b>visitor</b> experience <b>management</b> strategies that catered to the religiously/ spiritually -motivated visitor and vice versa. Hence, the results of the study suggest that the spirituality of the leader, either based on religion or upon secular, implicitly or explicitly determines and influences the <b>visitor</b> experience <b>management</b> strategy development and their implementations, and have significant implications for resource development and visitor satisfaction. Such observations have significant implications in the management of a diversity of visitor needs and expectations, and questions to what extent visitors needs and expectations are effectively catered for, while highlighting the complexities involved in effectively catering to the visitor experiences at sacred sites...|$|R

Despite its importance, partial applications, determination of basic theoretical principles, and specifying connection to the other theoretical concepts in tourism (particularly destination life cycle, LAC concept, <b>visitors</b> <b>management),</b> there still is a rightful opinion of some authors suggesting that there is no consistent theory of tourism carrying capacity. This theory would be the base for sophisticated practical carrying capacity applications. This paper is therefore focused on introduction of the theoretical concept of carrying capacity, which can be discussed and possibly further elaborated...|$|R
