25|$|Ohm's law {{states that}} the <b>voltage</b> (<b>V)</b> across a {{resistor}} {{is proportional to the}} current (I), where the constant of proportionality is the resistance (R). For example, if a 300 ohm resistor is attached across the terminals of a 12 volt battery, then a current of 12 / 300 = 0.04 amperes flows through that resistor.|$|E

25|$|The {{simplest}} {{method to}} measure the electrical resistance of a sample of some material is to place it in an electrical circuit in series with a current source I and measure the resulting <b>voltage</b> <b>V</b> across the sample. The resistance of the sample is given by Ohm's law as R=V/I. If the voltage is zero, {{this means that the}} resistance is zero.|$|E
25|$|At {{the present}} stage of CFE theory development, it is {{important}} to make a distinction between theoretical CFE equations and an empirical CFE equation. The former are derived from condensed matter physics (albeit in contexts where their detailed development is difficult). An empirical CFE equation, on the other hand, simply attempts to represent the actual experimental form of the dependence of current i on <b>voltage</b> <b>V.</b>|$|E
25|$|For CFE, basic {{theoretical}} treatments {{provide a}} relationship between the local emission current density J and the local barrier field F, at a local position on the emitting surface. Experiments measure the emission current i from some defined part of the emission surface, {{as a function of the}} <b>voltage</b> <b>V</b> applied to some counter-electrode. To relate these variables to J and F, auxiliary equations are used.|$|E

500|$|The power {{conjugate}} {{variables are}} {{a pair of}} variables whose product is power. [...] In the electrical domain the power conjugate variables chosen are invariably <b>voltage</b> (<b>v)</b> and current (i). [...] Thus, the power conjugate variables in the mechanical domain are analogs. [...] However, {{this is not enough}} to make the choice of mechanical fundamental variables unique. [...] The usual choice for a translational mechanical system is force (F) and velocity (u) {{but it is not the}} only choice. [...] A different pair may be more appropriate for a system with a different geometry, such as a rotational system.|$|E

50|$|This method {{converts}} {{a reading}} of the battery voltage to SoC, using the known discharge curve (<b>voltage</b> <b>vs.</b> SoC) of the battery. However, the voltage is more significantly affected by the battery current (due to the battery's electrochemical kinetics) and temperature. This method can be made more accurate by compensating the voltage reading by a correction term proportional to the battery current, and by using a look-up table of battery's open circuit <b>voltage</b> <b>vs.</b> temperature.|$|R

2500|$|In a true ohmic device, {{the same}} value of {{resistance}} will be calculated from R = V/I {{regardless of the}} value of the applied <b>voltage</b> <b>V.</b> [...] That is, the ratio of V/I is constant, and when current is plotted as a function of voltage the curve is linear (a straight line). [...] If voltage is forced to some value V, then that <b>voltage</b> <b>V</b> divided by measured current I will equal R. [...] Or if the current is forced to some value I, then the measured <b>voltage</b> <b>V</b> divided by that current I is also R. [...] Since the plot of I versus V is a straight line, then it is also true that for any set of two different voltages V1 and V2 applied across a given device of resistance R, producing currents I1 = V1/R and I2 = V2/R, that the ratio (V1−V2)/(I1−I2) is also a constant equal to R. [...] The operator [...] "delta" [...] (Δ) is used to represent a difference in a quantity, so we can write ΔV = V1−V2 and ΔI = I1−I2.
