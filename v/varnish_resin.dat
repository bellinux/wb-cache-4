5000|$|After being applied, the {{film-forming}} {{substances in}} varnishes either harden directly, {{as soon as}} the solvent has fully evaporated, or harden after evaporation of the solvent through curing processes, primarily chemical reaction between oils and oxygen from the air (autoxidation) and chemical reactions between components of the <b>varnish.</b> <b>Resin</b> varnishes [...] "dry" [...] by evaporation of the solvent and harden almost immediately upon drying. Acrylic and waterborne varnishes [...] "dry" [...] upon evaporation of the water but will experience an extended curing period. Oil, polyurethane, and epoxy varnishes remain liquid even after evaporation of the solvent but quickly begin to cure, undergoing successive stages from liquid or syrupy, to tacky or sticky, to dry gummy, to [...] "dry to the touch", to hard. Environmental factors such as heat and humidity play a very large role in the drying and curing times of varnishes. In classic varnish the cure rate depends on the type of oil used and, to some extent, on the ratio of oil to resin. The drying and curing time of all varnishes may be sped up by exposure to an energy source such as sunlight, ultraviolet light, or heat.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND Although {{orthodontic}} {{white spot}} lesions (WSLs) {{are one of}} the most often and most evident adverse effects of comprehensive fixed appliance treatment, the efficacy of interventions for WSLs has not yet been adequately assessed in an evidence-based manner. OBJECTIVE Aim of this systematic review was to assess the therapeutic and adverse effects of interventions to treat post-orthodontic WSLs from randomized trials in human patients. SEARCH METHODS An unrestricted electronic search of eight databases from inception to May 2016. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomized controlled trials assessing any interventions for post-orthodontic WSLs on human patients. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS After duplicate study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment according to the Cochrane guidelines, random-effects meta-analyses of mean differences (MDs), standardized mean differences (SMDs), and odds ratios (ORs), including their 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were performed, followed by subgroup and sensitivity analyses. RESULTS A total of 20 unique studies and a total of 942 (42 per cent male and 58 % per cent female) patients were included, with an average age of 16. 2 years and a mean number of 8. 2 WSLs (range 2. 2 to 45. 4) per patient. These were allocated to adjunct treatment with casein phosphopeptide-stabilized amorphous calcium phosphate creams, external tooth bleaching, low- or high-concentration fluoride films, gels, mouthrinses or <b>varnishes,</b> <b>resin</b> infiltration, miswak chewing sticks, bioactive glass toothpastse, or to no adjunct treatment (i. e. conventional oral hygiene). The monthly use of fluoride varnish was the best supplement to improve WSLs in terms of lesion area (1 trial; MD = - 0. 80 mm(2); 95 % CI = - 1. 10, - 0. 50 mm(2); P 0. 05; moderate quality), with imprecision due to small sample size being the main limitation of existing evidence. CONCLUSIONS Based on the existing trials, interventions for post-orthodontic WSLs, mainly fluoride varnish, seem to be effective, but further research is needed to elucidate their clinical relevance.

Both patients had been using nail varnish and varnish remover. Case 3. A 49 -year-old woman had, for about 5 years, repeatedly experienced itching erythema at the perionychium of several fingers on which she had placed artificial nails. Marked oedema and erythema was noted. INVESTIGATION: Extensive epicutaneous tests were performed on these patients.

30|$|In addition, the tunable LED {{wavelengths}} {{provide a}} more targeted excitation source than UV for the pigments of interest, which preferentially absorb in the visible range. All red lakes show a main absorption band in the 400 – 650  nm spectral range. For madder lakes this is centred at c. 455 – 540  nm, depending on their preparation procedure [38], the blue LED (λmax =  465  nm) is an optimal excitation wavelength for these coloured species whilst avoiding the excitation of binders, <b>varnishes</b> or <b>resins</b> that preferentially absorb UV wavelengths. This not only increases the emission signal from the species of interest but the narrow emission band also minimises the effects of distortion of the emission features, such as self-absorption, multiple scattering and inner filter effects, produced by interference from other excited species [21, 39, 40]. Evidence {{of this can be}} seen by comparing the area of pink pigment under the belly of the duck in the UVL and VIVL (Lee No 21 filter) images of Terracotta A (Fig.  8 b, d, respectively). As discussed above, the UVL image shows an area of blue luminescence but the corresponding area in the VIVL images is very similar in colour to that observed for the areas of purple pigment in the VIVL image. This suggests that in the UVL image we are observing luminescence from a species in this area of pigment that is masking the emission from the red lake and that this contribution is eliminated by the more targeted excitation and detection provided by the VIVL method.|$|R

The metal foils were normally protected from the atmosphere by a <b>varnish</b> or <b>resin</b> which maybe either preserved or absent. Moreover, they were glued to the background surface by adhesive substances (egg yolk, drying oil or animal glue). The high proportion of the glueing substances often renders the development of reaction compounds. With time, silver alters blacken or simply disappear completely. In this paper, we study the alterations to metal foils from a selection of fifteenth century artworks showing different glueing agents, organic coatings and several degrees of conservation of the organic coatings and metal leafs. The submillimetric layered structure and the high variability and low amount of most of the compounds present in the different layers, as well as their differing nature (organic and inorganic) make the use of micron-sensitive highresolution techniques essential for their study. In particular, the high resolution, high brilliance and small footprint renders synchrotron radiation most adequate for their study. SR-XRD was performed to identify the reaction compounds formed in the different layers; μFTIR was used at to identify the silver protecting organic coatings, the metal foil glueing layers and the corresponding reaction compounds. The results obtained suggest that atmospheric corrosion is the dominant mechanism, and therefore that the degree of corrosion of the metal foils is mainly related to the conservation state of the protecting coatings.
