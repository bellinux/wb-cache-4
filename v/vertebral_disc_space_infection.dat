40|$|The {{relationship}} of the esophagus to the cervical <b>vertebral</b> body (CVB), <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> and longus colli (LC) muscles, to our knowledge, has not been previously studied. The {{purpose of this study}} was to quantify the {{relationship of}} the esophagus to the CVB, <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> and LC. 30 patients were selected for a retrospective review of computed tomography (CT) scans. Measurements between the esophagus and the C 5, C 6, and C 7 vertebral bodies as well as the C 5 / 6 and C 6 / 7 <b>disc</b> <b>spaces</b> were performed in the midline, 3  mm right and left of midline, and at the edge of the LC on both sides. The closest distance of the esophagus to the CVB and <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> occurs at the midline (range 1. 02 – 1. 31  mm at each level). The furthest distance occurred at the edge of the right LC (range 2. 67 – 3. 30  mm at each level). The mean distance from the edge of the right LC to the midline was significantly greater (P <  0. 01) than mean distance from the edge of the left LC to the midline. No statistical significant differences were observed when comparing measurements at the individual <b>vertebral</b> bodies and <b>disc</b> <b>spaces.</b> The results of the study demonstrate that the esophagus lies in closest proximity to the CVB and <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> in the midline.

Intradural disc herniations usually occurred at the L 4 -L 5 levels but have also been reported at other levels. However, intradural disc herniation at L 5 -S 1 is quite rare. There are approximately nine reports in the English literature of intraradicular disc herniation at L 5 -S 1. We described a 61 -yr-old man with suspected intradural mass {{at the level of}} L 5 -S 1 space. The patient presented with pain in the lower back and both lower legs for 4 months and a sudden exacerbation of the symptoms for 3 days. Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a large disc herniation at the L 5 -S 1 level with an intradural component. L 5 and S 1 laminectomy was performed, and dura was swollen and immobile. Subsequent durotomy was performed and an intradural disc fragment was removed. The patient had full recovery in 3 months.

Four patients showed moderate changes, while two had extensive osteolytic lesions of one or both vertebral bodies adjacent to the involved disc. In the 7 cases in group B, discitis was suspected a mean of 5 days and antibiotics were initiated a mean of 8 days following surgery; on average, symptoms regressed 1. 8 months after operation. Only four patients showed vertebral radiographic changes and none had marked destructive lesions.

40|$|Study Design. Levels of the {{antibiotic}} cephazolin were measured in disc and blood from a consecutive series of patients undergoing lumbar spinal fusion. Objectives. To determine if levels of cephazolin {{in the human}} disc reach the stated minimum inhibitory concentration against Staphylococcus aureus (1 mg/L) following intravenous administration, and {{to determine if there}} is a therapeutic relationship between serum concentration and disc concentration. Summary of Background Data. <b>Disc</b> <b>space</b> <b>infection</b> is a potential complication of surgical procedures that violates the intervertebral disc. Bacteria, often from normal skin flora, can be introduced into the <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> causing inflammation with destruction of the adjacent vertebral endplate. Although there is substantial evidence from animal studies that prophylactic antibiotics reduce the incidence of discitis, similar evidence in human beings is not strong. Methods. A total of 30 patients, including 15 females and 15 males, with a mean age 42 years (range 21 – 63), received 1 -g cephazolin (intravenous) during 1 or 2 -level lumbar spinal fusion surgery. Venous blood was collected before administration of cephazolin and again at disc removal. Disc cephazolin concentrations were measured at the same time serum levels were measured for each patient. Results. The interval between cephazolin administration and tissue sampling ranged from 7 to 137 minutes. Cephazolin concentration in the serum (range 31. 1 – 148 mg/L) was higher than in the disc (range 0 – 9. 5 mg/L). The concentration of cephazolin peaked in the serum at 7 minutes, and in the disc between 37 and 53 minutes. More than 70 % of the disc samples had detectable levels of cephazolin at the time the disc was removed, although only half of these samples had cephazolin levels higher than 1 mg/L. All serum cephazolin concentrations were higher than 1 mg/L. Serum cephazolin concentration did not relate to disc concentration at a given time. Conclusions. The time when antibiotic concentration is highest in the disc varies among patients. More than 70 % of disc samples had detectable levels of cephazolin, although only half of the discs contained cephazolin higher than the stated minimum inhibitory concentration for S. aureus(> 1 mg/L).

40|$|Background. Spondylo{{discitis}}, discitis {{associated with}} vertebral osteomyelitis may follow disc-removal surgery. A targeted successful treatment of spinal infections requires clinical and laboratory {{data that are}} completed by the contribution of imaging procedures. Neuroimaging provides precise information on correct topography, localization, propagation, and differential diagnosis of spinal infectious lesions. The {{aim of this study}} was to present magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in patients with postoperative spondylodiscitis. Methods. MRI was performed in 6 patients aged 29 - 50, with clinically suspected postoperative spondylodiscitis. Initial examination was performed 3 - 8 weeks after surgery and 3, 6, or 12 months after the treatment by antibiotics. Patients underwent MRI on a 1 T imaging unit (Siemens, Magnetom-Impact), including sagittal T 1 W and T 2 W images and axial T 1 W images before and after the administration of gadolinium contrast medium. Results. MRI findings included: significantly decreased signal intensity with the loss of distinction between vertebral body and intervertebral <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> on T 1 W, increased signal intensity in the adjacent vertebral body and end-plates on T 2 W, contrast enhancement of <b>vertebral</b> body and <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> and paravertebral soft tissue changes. Follow-up examinations performed 3, 6, or 12 months after the treatment showed less abnormal signal intensities on both T 1 - and T 2 -weighted images. Conclusion. Postoperative spondylodiscitis is a rare but severe complication of lumbar disc surgery. Since conventional imaging techniques are not reliable for detecting spondylodiscitis in its early stages, MRI is of great significance in the diagnosis of postoperative spondylodiscitis...|$|R
40|$|Osteoporosis {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequent}} diseases of the elderly and can lead to damage and fractures of <b>vertebral</b> <b>discs.</b> It diagnosis of these deformations is suboptimal, often only being made by pure chance after examination of radiographs by radiologists and is, obviously, subjective, dependent on the skills and training of the examiner. Thus, there is an increasing need for methods and software to optimise the analysis of changes of <b>vertebral</b> <b>discs</b> with a high degree of objectivity. The aim of this thesis was to analyse the performance of MorphoXpress, a new software that is supposed to introduce objectivity and optimal performance for recognising of osteoporosis-induced damage of <b>vertebral</b> <b>discs.</b> MorphoXpress automatically analyses digitalised radiographs of osteoporotic <b>vertebral</b> <b>discs</b> after initialisation by the user. There are two versions of the software that differ from each other in the mode of initialisation. Results from MorphoXpress (form, status and degree of deformation of the <b>vertebral</b> <b>discs)</b> were evaluated and manually corrected, if required. It could be shown that 81 % of the points in the software version 1 -point and 66 % of the points in the software version 2 -point had to corrected manually. Time saving could thus not be realised because a qualitative analysis and evaluation of the radiographs had to be performed after the automatic analysis. Cohen’s  value for inter-rater agreement was used to evaluate the agreement between results by manual evaluation or by MorphoXpress analysis. There was little concordance between the results obtained by the 1 -point version. For the 2 -point version, Cohen’s was zero demonstration no agreement between the results. The use of the MorhoXpress system does not deliver satisfactory results for the analysis of osteoporotic deformation (form and degree) of <b>vertebral</b> <b>discs.</b> One of the main reasons for a misclassification of <b>vertebral</b> <b>discs</b> is the wrong setting of starting points for the automatic analysis. This was the case for all the software versions offered by the manufacturer. Therefore, a qualitative evaluation had to performed after automatic analysis. In summary, the results presented in this thesis show that the use MorphoXpress for automatic recognition of osteoporotic vertebral fractures and of vertebral deformations by other causes is sub-optimal and thus the use of MorphoXpress for diagnosis of <b>vertebral</b> <b>disc</b> deformations independent of the ætiology cannot be recommended at present...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} lateral interbody lumbar spinal surgery and {{designing}} an optimal intervetebral device {{is a complex}} endeavor. Interbody spinal fusion is performed {{for a variety of}} clinical situations, including back pain, vertebral fractures, and tumor conditions that require stabilization of the vertebral segments. The fundamental goal of spinal fusion is to attain a solid fixation at the implant-vertebral interface. Replacement of a degenerated <b>vertebral</b> <b>disc</b> with an artificial intervertebral disc (AID) is currently possible, but poses problems mainly in the force distribution through the vertebral column. Data on the intervertebral <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> geometry will provide a better fit of the prosthesis to the vertebrae, but current literature on <b>vertebral</b> <b>disc</b> geometry is very scarce or not suitable [5]. During the design phase there are few concerns that must be considered. Subsidence of the interbody cage into the vertebral body may cause collapse of <b>disc</b> <b>space,</b> recurrence of spinal deformity and preoperative symptoms, or failure of the fusion. The core of the vertebral body is made of a softer less dense cancellous bone towards the center of the disk space and a much harder ring of cortical bone called the apophyseal ring on the outer perimeter. Through maximizing the footprints contact area (better stress distribution), and focusing greater percentage of that stress on the harder apophyseal ring we will see improved fusion results in accordance to Wolff’s law. Also improved endplate matching reduces the risk of implant migration or protrusion into the psoas muscle. The psoas houses many sensory nerves, and if compacted could cause pain in the patient (commonly chronic leg pain). In this study, statistical method and clinical axial x-rays of lumbar vertebra endplates were used to formulate a ratio to size the anterolateral radius of a patients lumbar vertebrae, based on the vertebras medial-lateral length. This technique, which was developed into a repeatable protocol, may be useful to consider in the design of any lumbar intervetebral device (particularly for one that is meant to span the disk space laterally) ...|$|R

Other factors may also include those with rare diseases, as is the case with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (EDS), where hyper-extensive and usually unstable joints (e.g. joints that are problematically much more flexible, frequently to the point of partial or full dislocation) are quite common throughout the body. With such hyper-extensibility, it is also quite common (if not the norm) to find the muscles surrounding the joints to be a major source of compensation when such instability exists.|$|R

40|$|The {{fusion of}} {{vertebral}} segments is an established treatment for spinal disorders. Harms-Cages {{were used as}} intervertebral implants for spondylodesis since 1986. This cage is originally filled with autologous cancellous bone graft which promotes bone remodeling with its osteoinductive and osteoconductive properties. The purpose of this in vivo study was the histomorphological and histomorphometrical comparison of a sheep cervical spine fusion-model by using the Harms-Cage. Thirty-one sheep underwent C 3 / C 4 discectomy and fusion. They were divided into four groups, according to their treatment: group 1 : Harms-Cage filled with mineralized collagen scaffold (n = 8); group 2 : Harms-Cage filled with mineralized collagen scaffold combined with PRP (n = 8); group 3 : Harms-Cage filled with mineralized collagen scaffold combined with 150 &# 956;g rh BMP- 2 (n = 8); group 4 : Harms-Cage filled with mineralized collagen scaffold coated with cyclic RGD-Peptide (n = 7); group 5 : untreated control segment (n = 8). Group 5 acted as referee. After 12 weeks, sheep were sacrificed and specimen were taken. Histological handling followed. All specimen were stained with masson &# 65533; goldner - trichrom, safranin - orange / lightgreen, safranin &# 65533; orange / von Kossa and astrablue. The quantitative analysis showed the intervertebral tissue, vascularisation and foreign body reaction in the former intervertebral disc-space. The following histomorphometrical analysis calculated the percentage rate of bone, cartilage and mineralized cartilage in the defined &# 65533;Region of Interest&# 65533; (ROI). The histological analysis revealed the following results: The vertebral disc-space was filled with fibrous tissue and cartilage in group 1. Partially residual tissue of mineralized collagen was demonstrated. In one specimen a bony fusion could be detected. The specimens of group 2 showed no bony fusion at all. Vertebral bodies were separated by a layer of fibrous tissue and cartilage in contact to new built bone. Group 3 was characterized by advanced bone modeling and remodeling even ventral of the <b>vertebral</b> <b>disc</b> <b>space.</b> Three specimens showed bony fusion. The specimens of group 4 showed advanced bone regeneration. Two bony fusions were verifiable. In group 5, the intervertebral disc was present. All specimens of the groups 1, 3 and 4 presented significantly more bone tissue in the examined area than the native specimens. There {{was no significant difference}} in mineralized cartilage between all examined groups. The results showed that all tested treatments for spinal fusion have the ability for equally replacing the bone graft - &# 65533;Golden Standard&# 65533; at the 12 -week examination time point. The cage augmentation with mineralized collagen scaffold (group 1) and mineralized collagen scaffold combined with PRP (group 2) did not show a significant effect on the interbody fusion and bone growth. Foreign body reactions were associated with cage sintering. The additional treatment of the interbody fusion device with rh BMP- 2 (group 3) and the cyclic RGD-Peptide (group 4) was a successful combination for the application in the cervical spine. Both methods showed better results than the Harms-Cage filled with autologous bone graft. Nevertheless the usage of rh BMP- 2 for spinal fusion is associated with some risks, specified in literature. In this study, no complications were found. It can be suggested that the ventral bony callus is caused by the method of application of the growth factor at the mineralized collagen scaffold and not by rh BMP- 2 itself. Nevertheless the use of rh BMP- 2 on collagen scaffolds should be limited to experimental studies. The combination of mineralized collagen scaffold with the cyclic RGD-peptide, which usage is confined to experimental studies so far, stimulated the spondylodesis as well in this animal model. This occurred without any side effects, like foreign body reactions, within the observation period. The combination of cyclic RGD-peptide with an osteoconductive matrix showed very good results for spondylodesis and was superior to the autologous transplant. This showed impressively, that cRGD is able to accelerate osseointegration and bone modeling, without side effects within a 12 -weeks observation period.

50|$|Neurosurgery of {{the spine}} covers the cervical, {{thoracic}} and lumbar spine. Some indications for spine surgery include spinal cord compression resulting from trauma, arthritis of the spinal discs, or spondylosis. In cervical cord compression, patients may have difficulty with gait, balance issues, and/or numbness and tingling in the hands or feet. Spondylosis is the condition of spinal disc degeneration and arthritis that may compress the spinal canal. This condition can often result in bone-spurring and disc herniation. Power drills and special instruments are often used to correct any compression problems of the spinal canal. Disc herniations of spinal <b>vertebral</b> <b>discs</b> are removed with special rongeurs. This procedure {{is known as a}} discectomy. Generally once a disc is removed it is replaced by an implant which will create a bony fusion between vertebral bodies above and below. Instead, a mobile disc could be implanted into the <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> to maintain mobility. This is commonly used in cervical disc surgery. At times instead of disc removal a Laser discectomy could be used to decompress a nerve root. This method is mainly used for lumbar discs.

50|$|Radiological {{intervention}} is often necessary {{to confirm the}} presence of vertebral osteomyelitis in the body. Plain-film radiological orders are necessary for all patients displaying symptoms of the disease. This diagnostic approach is often preliminary to other radiological procedures, such as magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, computed tomography (CT) scan, fine-needle aspiration biopsy, and nuclear scintigraphy. The initial plain-film X-ray images are scanned for any indication of disc compression between two vertebrae or the degeneration {{of one or more}} vertebrae. Only when these findings are ambiguous is further testing necessary to diagnose the disease. Other radiological approaches offer more comprehensive imaging of the spinal area, but can often prove inconclusive. MRI scans do not expose the patient to radiation and are highly sensitive to changes in the size and appearance of the intervertebral discs; however, findings on the MRI scan may be confused with other conditions such as the presence of tumors or bone fractures. If MRI imaging is inconclusive, the high sensitivity to erosions in the vertebrae or intervertebral discs of CT scans may be preferred for their ability to indicate signs of the disease more clearly than MRI. Additional tests may be ordered if such preliminary tests cannot confirm a diagnosis; for example, needle biopsies may be needed to take samples of bone surrounding the <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> where the <b>infection</b> is thought to live, or nuclear bone scans may be used to contrast areas of healthy bone with areas of infection.|$|R

The expression of 65 genes whose mRNA levels differed significantly (p< 0. 001; ≥ 6 -fold change) between chordoma and control (<b>vertebral</b> <b>disc)</b> was identified. Genes with increased expression in chordoma compared to control and chondrosarcoma were most frequently located on chromo-somes 2 (11 %), 5 (8 %), 1 and 7 (each 6 %), whereas interphase cytogenetics of 33 chordomas demonstrated gains of chro-mosomal material most prevalent on 7 q (42 %), 12 q (21 %), 17 q (21 %), 20 q (27 %) and 22 q (21 %). The microarray data were confirmed for selected genes by quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. As in other studies, we showed the expression of brachyury. We demonstrate the expression of new potential candidates for chordoma tumorigenesis, such a...|$|R
40|$|STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional {{analysis}} of long-term follow-up (LTFU) data from 4 randomized controlled trials of operative versus nonoperative treatment for chronic low back pain. OBJECTIVE: To examine {{the influence of}} spinal fusion on adjacent segment <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> height {{as an indicator of}} disc degeneration at LTFU. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There is ongoing debate as to whether adjacent segment disc degeneration results from the increased mechanical stress of fusion. METHODS: Plain standing lateral radiographs were obtained at LTFU (mean, 13 ± 4 yr postrandomization) in 229 of 464 (49 %) patients randomized to surgery and 140 of 303 (46 %), to nonoperative care. <b>Disc</b> <b>space</b> height and posteroanterior displacement were measured for each lumbar segment using a validated computer-assisted distortion compensated roentgen analysis technique. Values were reported in units of standard deviations above or below age and sex-adjusted normal values. Patient-rated outcomes included the Oswestry Disability Index and pain scales. RESULTS: Radiographs were usable in 355 of 369 (96 %) patients (259 fusion and 96 nonoperative treatment). Both treatment groups showed significantly lower values for <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> height of the adjacent segment than norm values. There was a significant difference between treatment groups for the <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> height of the cranial adjacent segment (in both as-treated and intention-to-treat analyses). The mean treatment effect of fusion on adjacent segment <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> height was - 0. 44 SDs (95 % CI, - 0. 77 to - 0. 11; P = 0. 01; as-treated analysis); there was no group difference for posteroanterior displacement (0. 18 SDs, 95 % confidence interval, - 0. 28 to 0. 64, P = 0. 45). Adjacent level <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> height and posteroanterior displacement were not correlated with Oswestry Disability Index or pain scores at LTFU (r = 0. 010 - 0. 05; P > 0. 33). CONCLUSION: Fusion was associated with lower <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> height at the adjacent segment after an average of 13 years of FU. The reduced <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> height had no influence on patient self-rated outcomes (pain or disability). LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2...|$|R

40|$|Spondylosis deformans and diffuse {{idiopathic}} skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) {{are usually}} incidental ﬁndings {{and in most}} dogs are either asymptomatic or associated with mild clinical signs. Severe spondylosis defor- mans and DISH can result in complete bony fusion of consecutive vertebral segments. One of the recognised complications following vertebral fusion in human patients is the development of adjacent segment disease, which is deﬁned as degenerative changes, most commonly degenerative intervertebral disc disease, in the mobile vertebral segment neighboring a region of complete vertebral fusion. A similar syndrome following cervical fusion in dogs has been termed the domino effect. The purpose of this retrospective study was to investigate the hypothesis that vertebral fusion occurring secondary to spondylosis deformans or DISH in dogs would protect fused intervertebral <b>disc</b> <b>spaces</b> from undergoing degeneration, but result in adjacent segment disease at neighbouring unfused intervertebral <b>disc</b> <b>spaces.</b> Eight dogs with clinical signs of thora- columbar myelopathy, magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracolumbar vertebral column, and spondylosis deformans or DISH producing fusion of ≥ 2 consecutive intervertebral <b>disc</b> <b>spaces</b> were evaluated. Verte- bral fusion of ≥ 2 consecutive intervertebral <b>disc</b> <b>spaces</b> was correlated (P = 0. 0017) with adjacent segment disease at the neighbouring unfused intervertebral <b>disc</b> <b>space.</b> <b>Vertebral</b> fusion appeared to protect fused in- tervertebral <b>disc</b> <b>spaces</b> from undergoing degeneration (P < 0. 0001). Adjacent segment disease should be considered in dogs with severe spondylosis deformans or DISH occurring in conjunction with a thoracolumbar myelopathy...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} whether {{the presence of}} neurological signs and magnetic resonance imaging findings could predict {{the presence of a}} traction-responsive lesion in Dobermanns affected by disc-associated cervical spondylomyelopathy. METHODS: Retrospective review of neurological signs and low-field pre- and post-traction magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities of the cervical spine (abnormal vertebral body shape and <b>vertebral</b> tipping, intervertebral <b>disc</b> degeneration, protrusion and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy) in Dobermanns with disc-associated cervical spondylomyelopathy. The main outcome of interest was response to linear traction (dynamic versus static) at C 6 -C 7 intervertebral <b>disc</b> <b>space.</b> The association between investigated variables and response to linear traction was assessed. RESULTS: The study included 25 dogs. No association was identified between neurological status grading and the presence of a static or traction-responsive lesion. Of the investigated magnetic resonance findings, C 7 -T 1 intervertebral disc degeneration was significantly (P = 0 · 03) associated with the presence of a traction-responsive lesion at C 6 -C 7 intervertebral <b>disc</b> <b>space.</b> CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The presence of C 7 -T 1 intervertebral disc degeneration might help in predicting the presence of traction-responsive C 6 -C 7 intervertebral disc lesions. © 2015 British Small Animal Veterinary Association...|$|R
