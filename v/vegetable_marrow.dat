60|$|This {{remarkable}} {{appearance was}} succeeded by another of a precisely similar description; then a fine <b>vegetable</b> <b>marrow,</b> of unusually large dimensions, {{was seen to}} whirl aloft, and come toppling down; then, several cucumbers shot up together; and, finally, the air was darkened by a shower of onions, turnip-radishes, and other small vegetables, which fell rolling and scattering, and bumping about, in all directions.|$|E

60|$|I don’t think I saw Judkin {{more than}} three times all told, and always the lane was our point of contact; but as the roan mare was taking me to the station one heavy, cloud-smeared day, I passed a dull-looking villa that the groom, or instinct, told me was Judkin’s home. From beyond a hedge of ragged elder-bushes could be heard the thud, thud of a spade, with an {{occasional}} clink and pause, as if some one had picked out a stone and thrown it to a distance, and I knew that he was doing nameless things to the roots of a pear tree. Near by him, I felt sure, would be lying a large and late <b>vegetable</b> <b>marrow,</b> and its largeness and lateness would be a theme of conversation at luncheon. It would be suggested that it should grace the harvest thanksgiving service; the harvest having been so generally unsatisfactory, it would be unfair to let the farmers supply all the material for rejoicing.|$|E
60|$|These {{plants have}} been {{for a long period}} the opprobrium of botanists; {{numerous}} varieties have been ranked as species, and, what happens more rarely, forms which now must be considered as species have been classed as varieties. Owing to the admirable experimental researches of a distinguished botanist, M. Naudin (10/136. 'Annales des Sc. Nat. Bot.' 4th series volume 6 1856 page 5.), a flood of light has recently been thrown on this group of plants. M. Naudin, during many years, observed and experimented on above 1200 living specimens, collected from all quarters of the world. Six species are now recognised in the genus Cucurbita; but three alone have been cultivated and concern us, namely, C. maxima and pepo, which include all pumpkins, gourds, squashes, and the <b>vegetable</b> <b>marrow,</b> and C. moschata. These three species are not known in a wild state; but Asa Gray (10/137. 'American Journ. of Science' 2nd series volume 24 1857 page 442.) gives good reason for believing that some pumpkins are natives of N. America.|$|E
6000|$|It commenced, so I calculate, {{about the}} year 2000 B.C., or, to be more precise--for figures are not the strong point of the old chroniclers--when King Heremon ruled over Ireland and Harbundia was Queen of the White Ladies of Brittany, the fairy Malvina being her {{favourite}} attendant. It is with Malvina that this story is chiefly concerned. Various quite pleasant happenings are recorded to her credit. The White Ladies belonged to the [...] "good people," [...] and, on the whole, lived up to their reputation. But in Malvina, {{side by side with}} much that is commendable, there appears to have existed a most reprehensible spirit of mischief, displaying itself in pranks that, excusable, or at all events understandable, in, say, a pixy or a pigwidgeon, strike one as altogether unworthy of a well-principled White Lady, posing as the friend and benefactress of mankind. For merely refusing to dance with her--at midnight, by the shores of a mountain lake; neither the time nor the place calculated to appeal to an elderly gentleman, suffering possibly from rheumatism--she on one occasion transformed an eminently respectable proprietor of tin mines into a nightingale, necessitating a change of habits that to a business man must have been singularly irritating. On another occasion a quite important queen, having had the misfortune to quarrel with Malvina over some absurd point of etiquette in connection with a lizard, seems, on waking the next morning, to have found herself changed into what one judges, from the somewhat vague description afforded by the ancient chroniclers, to have been a sort of <b>vegetable</b> <b>marrow.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The novel {{offers more}} {{information}} on Hastings. He did marry his [...] "Cinderella" [...] and did move to South America. Both events were mentioned briefly in The Murder on the Links. The novel could {{also serve as a}} finale for Poirot. At the end, he decides to retire to the countryside and to pursue his new hobby of growing <b>vegetable</b> <b>marrows.</b> This seemingly contradicts The Murder of Roger Ackroyd where Poirot was already in retirement and growing <b>vegetable</b> <b>marrows.</b> Zemboy suggests that The Big Four was written before The Murder of Roger Ackroyd. He notes a reference in Agatha Christie: An Autobiography where the writer notes that between The Man in the Brown Suit and The Secret of Chimneys, she had written another novel.|$|R

60|$|His dabblings in {{the unseen}} {{might not have}} carried him beyond the {{customary}} platitudes of the drawing-room visionary if accident had not reinforced his stock-in-trade of mystical lore. In company with a friend, who was interested in a Ural mining concern, {{he had made a}} trip across Eastern Europe at a moment when the great Russian railway strike was developing from a threat to a reality; its outbreak caught him on the return journey, somewhere on the further side of Perm, and it was while waiting {{for a couple of days}} at a wayside station in a state of suspended locomotion that he made the acquaintance of a dealer in harness and metalware, who profitably whiled away the tedium of the long halt by initiating his English travelling companion in a fragmentary system of folk-lore that he had picked up from Trans-Baikal traders and natives. Leonard returned to his home circle garrulous about his Russian strike experiences, but oppressively reticent about certain dark mysteries, which he alluded to under the resounding title of Siberian Magic. The reticence wore off in a week or two under the influence of an entire lack of general curiosity, and Leonard began to make more detailed allusions to the enormous powers which this new esoteric force, to use his own description of it, conferred on the initiated few who knew how to wield it. His aunt, Cecilia Hoops, who loved sensation perhaps rather better than she loved the truth, gave him as clamorous an advertisement as anyone could wish for by retailing an account of how he had turned a <b>vegetable</b> <b>marrow</b> into a wood pigeon before her very eyes. As a manifestation of the possession of supernatural powers, the story was discounted in some quarters by the respect accorded to Mrs. Hoops’ powers of imagination.|$|E
60|$|Looking at Sir Christopher, {{you would}} at {{once have been}} {{inclined}} to hope {{that he had a}} full-grown son and heir; but perhaps you would have wished that it might not prove to be the young man on his right hand, in whom a certain resemblance to the Baronet, in the contour of the nose and brow, seemed to indicate a family relationship. If this young man had been less elegant in his person, he would have been remarked for the elegance of his dress. But the perfections of his slim well-proportioned figure were so striking that no one but a tailor could notice the perfections of his velvet coat; and his small white hands, with their blue veins and taper fingers, quite eclipsed the beauty of his lace ruffles. The face, however--it was difficult to say why--was certainly not pleasing. Nothing could be more delicate than the blond complexion--its bloom set off by the powdered hair--than the veined overhanging eye-lids, which gave an indolent expression to the hazel eyes; nothing more finely cut than the transparent nostril and the short upper-lip. Perhaps the chin and lower jaw were too small for an irreproachable profile, but the defect was on the side of that delicacy and finesse which was the distinctive characteristic of the whole person, and which was carried out in the clear brown arch of the eyebrows, and the marble smoothness of the sloping forehead. Impossible to say that this face was not eminently handsome; yet, for the majority both of men and women, it was destitute of charm. Women disliked eyes that seemed to be indolently accepting admiration instead of rendering it; and men, especially if they had a tendency to clumsiness in the nose and ankles, were inclined to think this Antinous in a pig-tail a 'confounded puppy'. I fancy that was frequently the inward interjection of the Rev. Maynard Gilfil, who was seated {{on the opposite side of}} the dining-table, though Mr. Gilfil's legs and profile were not at all of a kind to make him peculiarly alive to the impertinence and frivolity of personal advantages. His healthy open face and robust limbs were after an excellent pattern for everyday wear, and, in the opinion of Mr. Bates, the north-country gardener, would have become regimentals 'a fain saight' better than the 'peaky' features and slight form of Captain Wybrow, notwithstanding that this young gentleman, as Sir Christopher's nephew and destined heir, had the strongest hereditary claim on the gardener's respect, and was undeniably 'clean-limbed'. But alas! human longings are perversely obstinate; and to the man whose mouth is watering for a peach, it is of no use to offer the largest <b>vegetable</b> <b>marrow.</b> Mr. Gilfil was not sensitive to Mr. Bates's opinion, whereas he was sensitive to the opinion of another person, who by no means shared Mr. Bates's preference.|$|E

5000|$|ZYMV affects all {{cucurbits}} including pumpkins, squashes, <b>vegetable</b> <b>marrows,</b> courgettes, melons, watermelons, cucumbers, gherkins {{and various}} gourds especially zucchinis. The effects are severe leaf mosaic, yellowing and eventually [...] "shoestring" [...] symptoms in the leaves. The fruits are stunted, twisted and deformed by raised protuberances, which reduces yield {{and makes them}} unmarketable in some cultures. In cultivated crops plants cease producing marketable fruits within 1-2 weeks of infection and serious financial losses can occur, particularly in courgette and marrow crops.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the work is to {{establish}} some rational modes of receipt of the food fibers (FF) from secondary resources of vegetable raw materials. Studying chemical properties of research objects has been carried out by standard methods in accordance with the GOST 26183 – 84, GOST 7636 – 85, GOST 25555. 3 – 82, GOST 28561 – 90. Determination of reducing and not reducing sugars content has been performed by the cyanide method; determination of pectinaceous substances' content – by the calcium-pectate method. As an enzyme medicine the earlier not studied complex enzyme medicine of proteolytic and amilolytic action of Bacillus subtilis and Penicillium emersonii cultures has been tested. Studying heat stability of complex enzyme medicine has been carried out at varying of the hydrolysis temperature from 40 °C to 80 °C. The fractional composition of carbohydrates of secondary resources of aubergines, <b>vegetable</b> <b>marrows</b> and onions conversion has been researched. Content of FF (cellulose, gemitsellyuloza, pectin) in waste from conversion of <b>vegetable</b> <b>marrows</b> constitutes 42 % of general content of carbohydrates, aubergines – 39, 2 %, and onion – 30, 4 %. Chemical and carbohydrate structures of secondary resources of vegetable raw materials allow consider them as FF source, and also shows feasibility of their conversion without fractionation by the form of secondary resources. The rational modes of hydrolysis of vegetable raw materials secondary resources' mix for removing the accompanying organic compounds have been determined. The maximum proteolytic activity of enzyme medicine takes place at the temperature of 50 °C, amilolytic activity – at 70 °C. In case of рН increase from 2. 0 to 6. 0 proteolytic and amilolytic activity reaches the maximum and constitutes 94 % and 95 % respectively, in case of further increase рН the activity decreases. The rational value of рН of reactionary environment when carrying out enzymatic hydrolysis in the presence of enzyme medicine is рН equal to 6. 0. The received results allow set the rational modes of enzyme medicine effect (temperature and рН) necessary for carrying out enzymatic hydrolysis of secondary resources of aubergines, <b>vegetable</b> <b>marrows</b> and onion processing...|$|R

5|$|High {{levels of}} both {{sugar and salt}} can {{preserve}} food by preventing micro-organisms from growing. Green beans can be salted by layering the pods with salt, but this method of preservation is unsuited to most <b>vegetables.</b> <b>Marrows,</b> beetroot, carrot, and some other vegetables can be boiled with sugar to create jams. Vinegar is widely used in food preservation; a sufficient concentration of acetic acid prevents the development of destructive micro-organisms, a fact made use of {{in the preparation of}} pickles, chutneys and relishes.

5000|$|According to the Oxford English Dictionary, {{the first}} mention of <b>vegetable</b> <b>marrows</b> dates to 1822, {{zucchini}} to 1929, and courgettes to 1931.

However, both in North America (since the 1920s) and in Britain (since the 1960s), thinner-skinned immature marrows have gained popularity due to their tender skin, firmer texture and distinct flavour.
