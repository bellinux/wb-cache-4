2500|$|On 15 January 2009, the {{official}} Depeche Mode website {{announced that the}} band's 12th studio album would be called Sounds of the Universe. The album was released in April 2009, also made available through an iTunes Pass, where the buyer received individual tracks in {{the weeks leading up}} to official release date. Andy Fletcher says the idea for their iTunes Pass was a combination of the band's and iTunes': [...] "I think the digital and record companies are starting to get their act together. They were <b>very</b> <b>lazy</b> in the first 10 years when downloads came in. Now they're collaborating more and coming up with interesting ideas for fans to buy products." [...] The album went to number one in 21 countries. Critical response was generally positive and it was nominated for a Grammy in the [...] "Best Alternative Album" [...] category. [...] "Wrong" [...] was the first single from the album, released digitally in February 2009. Subsequent singles were [...] "Peace" [...] and the double A-side [...] "Fragile Tension / Hole to Feed". In addition, [...] "Perfect" [...] was released as a promotional-only (non-commercial) single in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Wurst's {{selection}} proved {{controversial and}} attracted criticism from conservative groups, particularly in Eastern Europe, thus highlighting [...] the continent's regional divide {{between east and}} west on the issue of homosexuality. In Austria, four days after ORF announced its decision, more than 31,000 people had clicked to 'like' an [...] "Anti-Wurst" [...] page on social networking service Facebook. Petitions emerged in Russia and Belarus calling for their respective national broadcasters to edit out Wurst's performance from the televised contest; the Russian petition asserted that Eurovision had become [...] "a hotbed of sodomy, at the initiation of European liberals". Conservative Russian politician Vitaly Milonov urged Russia's Eurovision selection committee to boycott the competition as a result of Wurst's inclusion, describing her performance as [...] "blatant propaganda of homosexuality and spiritual decay" [...] and referring to her as the [...] "pervert from Austria". Armenia's entry for the contest, Aram Mp3, stated that Neuwirth's lifestyle was [...] "not natural" [...] and that he should decide whether he was a man or woman. Neuwirth hit back: [...] "I told him I don't want to be a woman. I am just a working queen and a <b>very</b> <b>lazy</b> boy at home." [...] Aram subsequently apologised, stating that his prior comments had been intended as a joke.|$|E
2500|$|Strength {{played an}} {{important}} part in Hoad's game, as he often drove for winners rather than rallying and waiting for the right opportunity. Although he assaulted his opponents, he also had the skill to win the French Championships on the slower clay court. Hoad played right-handed and had a powerful serve and groundstrokes but his game lacked consistency. At times Hoad had difficulty maintaining concentration. According to Kramer, [...] "Hoad had the loosest game of any good kid I ever saw. There was absolutely no pattern to his game.... He was the only player I ever saw who could stand six or seven feet behind the baseline and snap the ball back hard, crosscourt. He'd try for winners off everything, off great serves, off tricky short balls, off low volleys. He hit hard overspin drives, {{and there was no way}} you could ever get him to temporise on important points." [...] Kramer compares Hoad to another great player, Ellsworth Vines. [...] "Both were very strong guys. Both succeeded at a very young age.... Also, both were <b>very</b> <b>lazy</b> guys. Vines lost interest in tennis (for golf) before he was thirty, and Hoad never appeared to be very interested. Despite their great natural ability, neither put up the outstanding records that they were capable of. Unfortunately, the latter was largely true because both had physical problems." ...|$|E

2500|$|Deburau's great successes {{had come}} in the [...] "pantomime-féerie", {{featuring}} frenetic (sometimes violent) action in a fairy-land of transformations, tricks, and triumphs. [...] Legrand's talents lay elsewhere. [...] It was in the subtle, even touching, dramas of his Pierrot that he found his métier, {{and it was in}} the [...] "realistic" [...] pantomime that he excelled. [...] At the Folies-Nouvelles he came into his maturity, as another review by Gautier suggests; this is of Pierrot Dandin (1854), written by the mime and Charles Bridault, and the review should be quoted at length:... what absolutely must be seen is Paul Legrand in Pierrot Dandin. [...] We doubt whether Tiercelin, who played cobblers so well that it is said he could have been transferred to the shoemakers, was ever better at drawing on his hand-leather, at manipulating the knife and the awl, at squaring a sole, at nailing a bit of leather over a frame: one would truly think he has done nothing but this all his life. —But where he is superb is in the scene in which, returning home with a dress, a little shawl, and an apple turnover he has brought for his wife, he finds the conjugal nest deserted and, in place of the unfaithful spouse, a letter revealing that Madame Pierrot has left with the seducer Leander. [...] It must indeed be difficult to make people cry when one is wearing a little black skullcap, when one is sporting a face plastered with flour and a ridiculous costume. [...] Well! [...] Paul Legrand expresses his sadness in such a naïve, true, touching, and profoundly heartfelt manner that the puppet disappears, leaving only the man. [...] In the stage-boxes, the giddiest madcaps forgot to run their tongues over their green barley-sugar sticks and smothered their sobs behind their lace handkerchiefs.So devoted was Legrand to this conception of the character—as sensitive and vulnerable, his juddering heart on his sleeve—that, when he was consigned to a pantomime recalling Deburau's stage, he simply turned it into one of his own. [...] The Pierrot of Pol Mercier's Bureaucrat Pierrot (1856) was conceived as a scamp and a layabout:In the administrative bureau of a railroad, Pierrot is a <b>very</b> <b>lazy,</b> very inaccurate clerk. [...] At the office he spends all his time in distracting his colleagues and playing a thousand little tricks on them. [...] Sometimes he eats this one's lunch; sometimes he drinks that one's little carafe of wine. 1023, MS 3408, sc. 1 (unpaginated), Archives Nationales de France, Paris; tr.

40|$|AbstractWe {{present a}} nondeterministic {{calculus}} of closures {{for the evaluation}} of λ-calculus, which is based, not on symbolic evaluation (β-reduction), but on the paradigm of environments and closures, as in the old SECD machine, or in the more recent Categorical Abstract Machine (CAM). This calculus stands as a suitable abstraction right above those devices: there is no commitment as to the order of evaluation, and no explicit handling of stacks: the calculus is expressed in the style of Structural Operational Semantics, by a set of conditional rewrite rules. The CAM, and a <b>very</b> simple <b>lazy</b> abstract machine, due to J. -L. Krivine, arise naturally by first restricting the calculus to a specific strategy, and then implementing recursive calls by a stack. The Church–Rosser property and termination in presence of types hold in the calculus of closures, and are easier to establish than in the λ-calculus. The calculus of closures has served as a starting point to a more powerful general calculus of substitutions at which we hint shortly, insisting on its category- theoretic significance...|$|R

6000|$|In {{the great}} society of the wits, John Gay {{deserved}} to be a favourite, {{and to have a}} good place.(114) In his set all were fond of him. His success offended nobody. He missed a fortune once or twice. He was talked of for Court favour, and hoped to win it; but the Court favour jilted him. Craggs gave him some South-Sea Stock; and at one time Gay had very nearly made his fortune. But Fortune shook her swift wings and jilted him too: and so his friends, instead of being angry with him, and jealous of him, were kind and fond of honest Gay. In the portraits of the literary worthies of {{the early part of the}} last century, Gay’s face is the pleasantest perhaps of all. It appears adorned with neither periwig nor nightcap (the full dress and negligée of learning, without which the painters of those days scarcely ever portrayed wits), and he laughs at you over his shoulder with an honest boyish glee—an artless sweet humour. He was so kind, so gentle, so jocular, so delightfully brisk at times, so dismally woebegone at others, such a natural good creature that the Giants loved him. The great Swift was gentle and sportive with him,(115) as the enormous Brobdingnag maids of honour were with little Gulliver. He could frisk and fondle round Pope,(116) and sport, and bark, and caper without offending the most thin-skinned of poets and men; and when he was jilted in that little Court affair of which we have spoken, his warm-hearted patrons the Duke and Duchess of Queensberry(117) (the “Kitty, beautiful and young”, of Prior) pleaded his cause with indignation, and quitted the Court in a huff, carrying off with them into their retirement their kind gentle protégé. With these kind lordly folks, a real Duke and Duchess, as delightful as those who harboured Don Quixote, and loved that dear old Sancho, Gay lived, and was lapped in cotton, and had his plate of chicken, and his saucer of cream, and frisked, and barked, and wheezed, and grew fat, and so ended.(118) He became <b>very</b> melancholy and <b>lazy,</b> sadly plethoric, and only occasionally diverting in his latter days.
