Activities in this discipline included {{the design of the}} 1947 Cona <b>vacuum</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>maker</b> (produced from 1949, reworked in 1959 and still in production) and inventions such as a circular vacuum cleaner and an early 1960s portable handheld duplicating machine by Gestetner, which was not put into production due to the demise of mimeography.|$|E
50|$|A <b>vacuum</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>maker</b> brews coffee {{using two}} {{chambers}} where vapor pressure and vacuum produce coffee. This type of coffee maker {{is also known}} as vac pot, siphon or syphon coffee maker, and was invented by Loeff of Berlin in the 1830s. These devices have since been used {{for more than a century}} in many parts of the world. Design and composition of the <b>vacuum</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>maker</b> varies. The chamber material is borosilicate glass, metal, or plastic, and the filter can be either a glass rod or a screen made of metal, cloth, paper, or nylon. The Napier Vacuum Machine, presented in 1840, was an early example of this technique. While vacuum coffee makers generally were excessively complex for everyday use, they were prized for producing a clear brew, and were quite popular until the middle of the twentieth century. The Bauhaus interpretation of this device can be seen in Gerhard Marcks' Sintrax coffee maker of 1925.|$|E

Their improved design of plated metals, styled by industrial designer Alfonso Iannelli, became the famous Sunbeam Coffeemaster line of automated <b>vacuum</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>makers</b> (Models C-20, C-30, C40, and C-50).

5000|$|On August 27, 1930, Inez H. Pierce of Chicago, Illinois filed {{patent for}} the first <b>vacuum</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>maker</b> that truly {{automated}} the vacuum brewing process, while {{eliminating the need for}} a stove top burner or liquid fuels. An electrically heated stove was incorporated into the design of the vacuum brewer. Water was heated in a recessed well, which reduced wait times and forced the hottest water into the reaction chamber. Once the process was complete, a thermostat using bi-metallic expansion principles shut off heat to the unit at the appropriate time. Pierce's invention was the first truly [...] "automatic" [...] vacuum coffee brewer, and was later incorporated in the Farberware Coffee Robot.|$|E
50|$|A <b>vacuum</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>maker</b> {{operates}} as a siphon, where heating and cooling the lower vessel changes the vapor pressure {{of water in the}} lower, first pushing the water up into the upper vessel, then allowing the water to fall back down into the lower vessel. Concretely, the principle of a <b>vacuum</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>maker</b> is to heat water in the lower vessel of the brewer until expansion forces the contents through a narrow tube into an upper vessel containing coffee grounds (as water temperature increases, dense liquid water increasingly converts to less dense water vapor gas, which takes up more space and thus increases pressure); when the water reaches and exceeds the boiling point (so the vapor pressure equals and then exceeds atmospheric pressure), the (water vapor) pressure in the lower vessel exceeds the (atmospheric) pressure in the top vessel and water is pushed up the siphon tube into the upper vessel. During brewing, a small amount of water and sufficient water vapor remain in the lower vessel and are kept hot enough so the pressure will support the column of water in the siphon. When enough time has elapsed that the coffee has finished brewing, the heat is removed and the pressure in the bottom vessel drops, so the force of gravity (acting on the water) and atmospheric pressure (pressing on the liquid in the upper vessel) push the water down into the lower vessel, through a strainer and away from the grounds, ending brewing. The coffee can then be decanted from the lower chamber; the device must usually be taken apart to pour out the coffee.|$|E

But more functions will take more convenience. Actually users can have them both. In this thesis, I design some functions based on the cheap type of <b>coffee</b> <b>maker</b> which will make drinking coffee more convenient and enjoyable. I use Arduino Uno as my control system, cooperating with sensors and special circuits. My system monitor working time of <b>coffee</b> <b>maker,</b> temperature of <b>coffee</b> and water level of both coffee pot and tank in the <b>coffee</b> <b>maker.</b> Then users can receive these values from their cell phone and doing remote control. Meanwhile considering about prices, I choose the most suitable sensors for measurement. I also do some jobs for saving energy and safe. The system locks or turns off the switch automatically for them. At last, all the sensors, wires and control chip are put in good positions in the maker. ...|$|R
