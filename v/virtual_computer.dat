2500|$|As the {{computer}} industry moves {{in the direction of}} cloud computing, BMC is working with firms like Cisco and VMware to build a so-called Unified Computing System described as a [...] "private cloud in a box"; the Economist Magazine elaborated: [...] "instead of having to wire up servers, storage devices and networking gear, companies can build and reconfigure <b>virtual</b> <b>computer</b> systems with a few mouse clicks," [...] reported the Economist in March 2009. Business analyst Richard Sherman said the alliance [...] "raises BMC's profile in the server automation industry" [...] and would raise future revenues. According to the article, BMC's earlier acquisition of BladeLogic in 2008 was key to the formation of the alliance with Cisco. In June 2009, BMC received a [...] "CIO 100 award" [...] for [...] "innovative use of an internal cloud computing environment to achieve maximum return on server and storage investments." ...|$|E
