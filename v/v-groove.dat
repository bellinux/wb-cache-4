At a later stage, this {{was replaced by}} [...] "Aerolite", a synthetic urea-formaldehyde type, which was more durable. To provide for the edge joints for the fuselage halves, zones near the outer edges of the shells had their balsa sandwich cores replaced by much stronger inner laminations of birch plywood. For the bonding together of the two halves ("boxing up"), a longitudinal cut was machined into these edges. The profile of this cut {{was a form of}} <b>V-groove.</b> Part of the edge bonding process also included adding further longitudinal plywood lap-strips {{on the outside of the}} shells.

40|$|SrRuO 3 {{thin films}} were epitaxially grown on a (001) SrTiO 3 {{substrate}} using pulsed laser deposition technique. Various defects such as <b>V-grooves,</b> threading dislocations and dislocation dipoles are {{observed in the}} SrRuO 3 epitaxial film. It is found that the sidewalls of most <b>V-grooves</b> are { 101 } facets, and the dominant angle between the sidewalls is 90 °. Some threading dislocations end at the apexes of the <b>V-grooves</b> while the others penetrate the entire film. The threading dislocations and <b>V-grooves</b> can partially relieve the strain in the epitaxial SrRuO 3 film. During the relaxation process, a two-dimensional growth mode transforms into a three-dimensional one, along {{with the formation of}} mesa-like islands separated by <b>V-grooves.</b> The dimensions and distributions of <b>V-grooves</b> are associated with the growth conditions.

40|$|The {{magnetic}} anisotropy of 8 – 100 nm thick Ni 80 Fe 20 films sputter deposited on nanostructured <b>V-grooved</b> substrates and on tilted surfaces is investigated. Films deposited on a <b>V-grooved</b> substrate (200 nm period) with the sidefaces {{at an angle}} of 55 ° to the substrate plane, show a very large and essentially thickness-independent {{magnetic anisotropy}} field, viz. 25 ± 3 kA/m. Planar reference films deposited also at an angle of 55 ° to their substrate normal show an increase of the magnetic anisotropy as well, but only to 8 kA/m, independent of the film thickness, which is explained as a growth-induced effect. It is argued that the enhanced anisotropy observed in the <b>V-grooved</b> substrates is {{not the result of}} shape anisotropy induced by the <b>V-grooves.</b> This leads {{to the conclusion that the}} observed enhanced anisotropy must also be a growth-induced effect, enhanced by the specific geometry of the <b>V-grooves...</b>|$|R

50|$|The Kelvin Coupling {{is named}} after William Thompson (Lord Kelvin) who {{published}} the design in 1868-71. It consists of three spherical surfaces that rest on a concave tetrahedron, a <b>v-groove</b> pointing towards the tetrahedron and a flat plate. The tetrahedron provides three contact points, while the <b>v-groove</b> provides two and the flat provides one for a total required six contact points.

The <b>V-grooves</b> coalesce at ∼ 200 nm and are filled with material that exhibits a significant drop in indium content and a broad luminescence peak.

40|$|Templated self {{assembly}} of nanoparticles offers {{one way to}} reduce the dimensions of electronic circuit elements below lithographically defined feature sizes. In the method reported here, metallic clusters are assembled in <b>V-grooves</b> to produce wires with nano-scale widths. The <b>V-grooves</b> are formed in silicon substrates using KOH solution and the substrates are subsequently thermally passivated with silicon dioxide. The wires can be formed between existing electrical contacts on the substrate and their I(V) characteristics measured during and immediately after the fabrication process. Using an inert gas aggregation source [1] and thermal evaporation, Sb clusters with average diameter 40 nm were produced and assembled on passivated <b>V-grooved</b> substrates. Sb was selected for this investigation as evaporation occurs at temperatures achievable in the thermal aggregation source. Using Sb clusters, it should also be possible to study quantum confinement effects in wires with relatively large widths. Initial Sb cluster assembly experiments were performed using non-contacted passivated <b>V-grooved</b> substrates and with inert gas (Ar) flow-rates into the source of between 10 and 180 sccm.

Nevertheless, round belts are for use in relatively low torque situations only and may be purchased in various lengths or cut to length and joined, either by a staple, a metallic connector (in the case of hollow plastic), gluing or welding (in the case of polyurethane).

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation has}} been performed {{to study the}} forced convection and pressure-drop characteristics fully-developed steady turbulent flows in air-cooled, horizontal, equilateral-triangular ducts. These ducts were constructed of duralumin, each of the same axial length and hydraulic diameter. The inner surfaces of each duct were either plane or machined with uniformly-spaced parallel, identical <b>V-grooves.</b> For each tested duct, these grooves had a depth of 1 mm, but were all of the same apex angle, θ, where 0 ≤ θ < 150 °. The uniform separation between the centre lines of two adjacent <b>V-grooves</b> was kept constant at 34 mm. The measurements were performed with the hydraulic diameter-based Reynolds number for the steady-state air flow, ranging from 2800 to 9500.

The forced convection was enhanced {{by the presence of}} the V-grooves; the greatest forced-convection augmentation being achieved with <b>V-grooves</b> of apex angle θ~ 17. 5 °.

40|$|Wires with meso-scale and {{nano-scale}} widths {{have been}} fabricated using a novel templated cluster assembly technique. Soft-landed Sb clusters are assembled into wires at the apexes of <b>V-grooves</b> (widths 2 - 7 μm) formed in Si substrates using anisotropic KOH etching. Two methods for forming nano-wires using templated cluster assembly have been demonstrated. Depending on the chosen method of wire formation, the Si <b>V-grooved</b> substrates are either thermally passivated with SiO 2, or passivated with SiO 2 and then coated with evaporated Ti/Au. On passivated substrates, the metallic wires are formed directly by aggregation of the Sb clusters. On metallised substrates, Ar-plasma etching {{was used to}} remove the Ti/Au film around the Sb cluster wires to produce nano-scale width (~ 100 nm) Ti/Au wires.

50|$|The {{most common}} type of mirror mount is the {{kinematic}} mount. This type of mount is designed according to the principles of kinematic determinacy. Typically, the movable frame that holds the mirror pivots on a ball bearing which is set into a hole in the fixed frame. Ideally this hole should be trihedral (pyramid-shaped). Often a conical hole is used due to easier manufacture. The frame is pivoted by means of two micrometers or fine-thread screws, tipped with steel ball bearings. One of these ball bearings rests in a <b>V-groove,</b> the other rests on a flat surface. On cheaper mounts, the flat surface may be simply the material of the mount.
