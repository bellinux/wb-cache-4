5|$|Monody {{is similar}} to melody-dominated {{homophony}} in that one voice becomes the melody, while another voice assumes the underlying harmony. Monody, however, {{is characterized by a}} single <b>voice</b> <b>with</b> instrumental accompaniment, whereas melody-dominated homophony refers to a broader category of homophonic music, which includes works for multiple voices, not just works for solo voice, as was the tradition with early 17th-century Italian monody.|$|E

5|$|The Angel of Darkness started {{development}} {{three years}} prior to its release under the working title Tomb Raider next generation. As part of the preparation for the game, the company conducted market research, and decided {{to create a new}} setting and story for the main character. One of the main drives behind the game was fully utilising the new platform's potential and reinventing the character of Lara Croft, including rebuilding her character model and allowing her to perform melee combat. It was the first game in the series to be made for the PlayStation 2 platform: the previous entry in the series, , had pushed the PlayStation to its technical limits, contributing to lower review scores and sales than previous titles in the series. Core Design separated into two teams, with a new team working on Angel of Darkness and series regulars on Tomb Raider: Chronicles. After the completion of Tomb Raider: Chronicles, lead programmer Richard Morton came over and found that the new team had gone off the rails, scrapping the entire project once already and completing only the game's basic story. The developers later admitted to being overambitious. Some of them also commented that none of the Core team were prepared for the added complexity of developing for the advanced PlayStation 2. Jonell Elliott returned as the voice of Lara Croft. This would be the last time she provided the <b>voice,</b> <b>with</b> Keeley Hawes taking over for Tomb Raider: Legend.|$|E

Additionally, Paul Masvidal all but abandoned his vocoder robotic vocals, opting instead for a more natural singing <b>voice,</b> <b>with</b> a subtler —although noticeable— vocoder layer that increases an octave his voice.|$|E
