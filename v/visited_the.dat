40|$|Objective: Aim of {{this study}} was to explore the {{possibility}} that romantic attachment after the death of a partner continues as a form of symbolic attachment in older adults. Symbolic attachment was measured by means of the former attachment to the deceased spouse, <b>the</b> frequency of <b>visiting</b> <b>the</b> last resting place and the emotions experienced at the last resting place. Additionally <b>the</b> motives for <b>visiting</b> <b>the</b> last resting place were investigated. Method: The research group of 40 Dutch participants age 65 and older, who lost their life time partner and who were able to <b>visit</b> <b>the</b> last resting place completed the Dutch translation of the Experiences in Close Relationships Questionnaire revised (ECR-R) and the Dutch Depression Adjective Checklist (VROPSOM). To explore <b>the</b> motives for <b>visiting</b> <b>the</b> last resting place a new questionnaire was developed. This ‘Motieven voor het Bezoeken van de Laatste Rustplaats’ (MBLR) questionnaire was also filled out by the participants. Results: Results for <b>visiting</b> <b>the</b> last resting place showed that there was a marginally significant positive relationship with anxious attachment, anxious-avoidant attachment was marginally negatively related to <b>visiting</b> <b>the</b> last resting place and there was no relationship between avoidant attachment and visiting. Opposite to what was expected, this study did not show a relationship between attachment to the deceased partner and emotions experienced while <b>visiting</b> <b>the</b> last resting place. The most frequently reported motives for <b>visiting</b> <b>the</b> last resting place were maintaining the emotional bond and inspecting the site. Conclusion: There seems to be some relationship between attachment style to the deceased partner and frequency of <b>visiting</b> <b>the</b> last resting place. No evidence has been found that attachment to the deceased partner influences the emotions one experiences while <b>visiting</b> <b>the</b> last resting place. Further research is needed to explore if romantic attachment after the death of a partner actually continues as a form of symbolic attachment in older adults...|$|R
