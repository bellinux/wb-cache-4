5|$|On 22 August 2008, after a delay {{following}} Tropical Storm Fay, Atlantis was rolled {{from the}} Orbiter Processing Facility to the <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Assembly</b> <b>Building,</b> {{where it was}} mated to the external fuel tank and solid rocket booster stack. Problems were encountered during the mating process, and poor weather due to Hurricane Hanna caused a delay in the rollout of Atlantis to the launch pad, which is normally done seven days after rollover.|$|E
5|$|The first rollout to Launch Pad 39A {{occurred}} on 4 September 2008. On 27 September, the Science Instrument Command and Data Handling (SIC) Unit on the Hubble Space Telescope failed. Because of its {{importance to the}} telescope, NASA postponed the launch of STS-125 on 29 September until 2009 so the failed unit could be replaced as well. Atlantis was rolled back to the <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Assembly</b> <b>Building</b> on 20 October.|$|E
5|$|On 30 October 2008, NASA {{announced}} that Atlantis would {{be removed from}} its solid rocket boosters and external tank stack and {{sent back to the}} Orbiter Processing Facility to await a targeted launch time at 1:11pm EDT on 12 May 2009. The stack was turned over to be used on the STS-119 mission instead. On 23 March, Atlantis was mated to its new stack in the <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Assembly</b> <b>Building,</b> and rolled out to Launch Pad 39A on 31 March. On 24 April 2009, NASA managers issued a request to move the STS-125 launch up one day to 11 May at 2:01pm EDT. The change was made official at the flight readiness review on 30 April.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Vehicle</b> (originally Vertical) <b>Assembly</b> <b>Building,</b> or VAB, at NASA's Kennedy Space Center (KSC) is a {{building}} designed to assemble large space vehicles, {{such as the}} massive Saturn V and the Space Shuttle. The future Space Launch System (SLS) will also be assembled there.|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{review of the literature}} and historical background of NASA established a need for an easy-to-implement technological improvement to displaying procedures which is cost effective and risk reducing. Previous unsuccessful attempts have led this team to explore the practicality of using a mobile handheld device. The major products, inputs, resources, constraints, planning and effort required for consideration of this type of solution were outlined. After analyzing the physical, environmental, life-cycle, functional, and socio-technical requirements, a Functional Analysis was performed to describe the top-level, second-level, and third-level functions of the system requirements. In addition, the risk/value proposition of conversion to a new technology was considered and gave a blueprint for transitioning along with the tasks necessary to implement the device into the <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Assembly</b> <b>Building's</b> (VAB) current infrastructure. A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) described the elemental work items of the implementation. Once the viability of this system was confirmed, a device was selected through use of technical design comparison methods including the Pugh Matrix and House of Quality. Comparison and evaluation of the Apple iPhone, Motorola Q, Blackberry, PC Notebook, and PDA revealed that the iPhone is the most suitable device for this task. This paper outlines the device design/ architecture, {{as well as some of}} the required infrastructure...|$|R

5|$|Preparation for {{the mission}} began on June 3, with the {{assembly}} of the shuttle's solid rocket boosters (SRB) on the Mobile Launcher Platform. The boosters were stacked on June 20, 1983, and the external tank mated to the assembly on June 23. Challenger arrived at Kennedy Space Center on June 29, and {{was transferred to the}} Orbiter Processing Facility on June 30. After post-flight maintenance and preparation for the new mission, including the installation of most flight payloads, the shuttle was transferred to the <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Assembly</b> <b>Building</b> on July 27, and mated to the booster/tank stack. The stack was checked out on July 29 and 30, and moved to Launch Complex 39A on August 2, 1983. INSAT-1B was loaded into the orbiter when on the pad; the overall processing time from Challenger arriving at KSC to being ready for launch was only sixty-two days, a record for the program at the time.|$|E
5|$|Each Space Shuttle {{had three}} RS-25 engines, {{installed}} in the aft structure of the Space Shuttle orbiter in the Orbiter Processing Facility prior to the orbiter being transferred to the <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Assembly</b> <b>Building.</b> If necessary the engines could be changed on the pad. The engines, drawing propellant from the Space Shuttle external tank (ET) via the orbiter's main propulsion system (MPS), were ignited at Tâˆ’6.6 seconds prior to liftoff (with each ignition staggered by 120ms), which allowed their performance to be checked prior to ignition of the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs), which committed the shuttle to the launch. At launch, the engines would be operating at 100% RPL, throttling up to 104.5% immediately following liftoff. The engines would maintain this power level until around T+40 seconds, {{where they would be}} throttled back to around 70% to reduce aerodynamic loads on the shuttle stack as it passed through the region of maximum dynamic pressure, or max Q. The engines would then be throttled back up until around T+8 minutes, at which point they would be gradually throttled back down to 67% to prevent the stack exceeding 3g of acceleration as it became progressively lighter due to propellant consumption. The engines were then shut down, a procedure known as main engine cutoff (MECO), at around T+8.5 minutes.|$|E

25|$|After being {{manufactured}} {{at private}} plants, {{the parts of}} the Ares I/Orion stack would be tested and assembled at the <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Assembly</b> <b>Building</b> at the Kennedy Space Center. Once assembly was completed and a launch date was set, the Crawler-Transporter would transport the completed stack, along with the launch support tower and the Mobile Launcher Platform, out to Launch Pad39B. Once the Crawler-Transporter reached the pad, the stack and the Launcher Platform would be left in place and the Crawler-Transporter removed to a safe distance.|$|E
25|$|Atlantis was towed {{from its}} hangar in Orbiter Processing Facility-1 to the <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Assembly</b> <b>Building</b> (VAB) on October 6, 2009 at about 07:00 EDT. The move, known as rollover, was {{completed}} at 08:25 when Atlantis {{arrived in the}} VAB transfer aisle. Atlantis was initially scheduled to roll out to Launch Pad 39A on October 13, 2009. However, an issue with a crane that was being used to transfer Atlantis for attachment to its external fuel tank and two solid rocket boosters caused a delay in operations forcing the shuttle managers to add extra 24-hours to the rollout preparations.|$|E

25|$|Discovery {{was moved}} from its hangar in the Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF)-3 {{to the nearby}} 52-story <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Assembly</b> <b>Building</b> (VAB) on 9 September 2010. The shuttle emerged from OPF-3 at 06:54 EDT and the {{rollover}} was done at 10:46 EDT when Discovery came to a rest in the VAB's transfer aisle. The quarter-mile trip between the OPF-3 and VAB was the 41st rollover for Discovery. The rollover was originally planned at 06:30 EDT on 8 September 2010. The move did not commence due to the unavailability of fire suppression systems because of a broken water main near the VAB and turn basin that runs out to the shuttle launch pads.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the surplus}} CSMs, CSM-119, was {{modified}} to carry two additional crew and kept on standby for a potential rescue mission in case of issues on-board Skylab. During Skylab 3, a malfunction on the Apollo CSM docked to the station caused fears that the crew {{would not be able}} to return safely. CSM-119 was wheeled out to Launch Complex 39B on Saturn IB SA-209 during the mission and prepared for a possible launch. Two astronauts, Brand (commander) and Lind (command module pilot), would have flown the CSM to retrieve the three crew members. The problem was fixed without requiring a rescue flight. CSM-119 was returned to the <b>Vehicle</b> <b>Assembly</b> <b>Building</b> and remained on standby until the Skylab program ended.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vehicle</b> <b>assembly</b> and <b>vehicle</b> {{components}} represent 2 {{percent of}} manufacturing GDP and employment, and those shares have been falling in recent years.
