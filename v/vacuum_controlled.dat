A data driven approach allows for changes in configuration without changing the software code but at the expense of a solid database. Modelling the equipment allows for easy adaptation of a variety of control units with the same functionality but different physical interfaces. It also allows for a uniform display of the available data and status values.

40|$|Ultra-relativistic heavy-ion {{collisions}} are {{a window}} of opportunity to study QCD matter under extreme conditions of temperature and density, such as the quark-gluon plasma. Among the several possibilities, the study of jet quenching - generic name given to in-medium energy loss modifications of the parton branching - is a powerful tool to assess the properties of this new state of matter. The description of the parton shower is very well understood in <b>vacuum</b> (<b>controlled</b> reference) and medium-induced modifications of this process can be experimentally accessed through jet measurements. Current experimental data, however, cannot be entirely described only with energy loss phenomena. Transverse momentum broadening and decoherence effects, both theoretically established by now, and their interplay are essential to build a consistent picture of the medium-modifications of the parton branching and to achieve a correct description of the current experimental data.

40|$|Doping and {{stability}} of monolayer low defect content graphene transferred on a silicon dioxide substrate on silicon are investigated by micro-Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM) during thermal treatments in oxygen and <b>vacuum</b> <b>controlled</b> atmosphere. The exposure to molecular oxygen induces graphene changes as evidenced by a blue-shift of the G and 2 D Raman bands, together with the decrease of I 2 D /I G intensity ratio, which are consistent with a high p-type doping (∼ 10 13 cm - 2) of graphene. The successive thermal treatment in vacuum {{does not affect the}} induced doping showing this latter stability. By investigating the temperature range 140 - 350 °C and the process time evolution, the thermal properties of this doping procedure are characterized, and an activation energy of ∼ 56 meV is estimated. These results are interpreted on the basis of molecular oxygen induced ∼ 10 13 cm - 2 p-type doping of graphene with stability energy > 49 meV and postdoping reactivity in ambient atmosphere due to reaction of air molecules with oxygen trapped between graphene and substrate...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{responsible for}} p-type doping of substrate supported monolayer graphene (Gr) by thermal treatments in oxygen ambient have been investigated by micro-Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), considering commonly employed dielectric substrates, such as SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 thin films grown on Si. While a high p-type doping (∼ 1013  cm− 2) is observed for Gr on SiO 2, no significant doping is found for Gr samples on the Al 2 O 3 substrate, suggesting a key role of the Gr/SiO 2 interface states in the trapping of oxygen responsible for the Gr p-type doping. Furthermore, we investigated the doping stability of Gr on SiO 2 during subsequent thermal treatments in nitrogen (N 2), carbon dioxide (CO 2), water (H 2 O) or in <b>vacuum</b> <b>controlled</b> atmospheres. These processes induce only minor effects on the doping of Gr but for H 2 O and principally affect its defectiveness, suggesting that the literature reported air influence on the doping depends on water present in the atmosphere...|$|E

40|$|A contact lens may {{be removed}} from the eye either {{manually}} or by using a small rubber sucker. The removal of lenses by the rubber sucker technique is difficult at times, especi-ally when the lens is fenestrated, as the vacuum cannot be maintained. Assistance in the removal of the lens may be obtained by modifying existing rubber suckers. The bulb is cut off with a sharp blade and into the lumen so exposed is inserted a glass pipette removed from a drop-bottle. The other end of the pipette is attached to a rubber tube of convenient length. A second glass pipette which has been lightly packed with cotton wool to act as a barrier to saliva and to prevent condensation in the tube is fitted into {{the other end of the}} rubber tube.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} high-efficiency organic {{light-emitting diodes}} (OLEDs) by incorporating a double {{as well as}} triple emission layers into p-i-n-type device structures based on vacuum deposition technique. The term p-i-n means here a layer sequence in the form p-doped layer, intrinsic layer and n-doped layer. Both predominantly hole transporting material (TCTA) and an exclusively electron transporting host material (TAZ) are doped with the green phosphorescent dye tris(phenylpyridine) iridium [Ir(ppy) 3]. The intrinsic and doped transport and emission layers are formed using a high <b>vacuum</b> <b>controlled</b> co-evaporation deposition technique. As results, high efficient light emission is obtained in double emission system. For double emission system, a power efficiency of 68 lm/W and peak external quantum efficiency of 20 % are achieved at 100 cd/m 2 and at an operating voltage of 3. 0 V. In addition, impressive characteristics of white OLED has been achieved in doped red and green phosphorescent dopants {NPB:Ir(MDQ) 2 (acac) and TCTA:Ir(ppy) 3 } and blue-fluorescent dye (Spiro-DPVBi). As a result, a power efficiency of 14. 4 lm/W is obtained at a driving voltage of 3 volt and a luminance of 1000 cd/m 2 in stacked white OLEDs.
