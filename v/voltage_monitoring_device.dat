40|$|To provide process {{optimization}} of metal fabricating self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) 3 -D printers requires a low-cost sensor and data logger system to measure current (I) and voltage (V) {{of the gas}} metal arc welders (GMAW). This paper builds on previous open-source hardware development to provide a real-time measurement of welder I-V where the measuring circuit is connected to two analog inputs of the Arduino {{that is used to}} control the 3 -D printer itself. Franklin firmware accessed through a web interface that is used to control the printer allows storing the measured values and downloading those stored readings to the user’s computer. To test this custom current and <b>voltage</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>device</b> this study reports on its use on an upgraded all metal RepRap during the printing of aluminum alloy (ER 1100, ER 4043, ER 4943, ER 4047, and ER 5356).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{innovation}} is to use microstrain gauges to monitor minute changes in temperature along with material properties of the metal cans and pouches used {{in the construction of}} lithium-ion cells. The sensitivity of the microstrain gauges to extremely small changes in temperatures internal to the cells makes them a valuable asset in controlling the hazards in lithium-ion cells. The test program on lithium-ion cells included various cell configurations, including the pouch type configurations. The thermal properties of microstrain gauges have been found to contribute significantly as safety monitors in lithium-ion cells that are designed even with hard metal cases. Although the metal cans do not undergo changes in material property, even under worst-case unsafe conditions, the small changes in thermal properties observed during charge and discharge of the cell provide an observable change in resistance of the strain gauge. Under abusive or unsafe conditions, the change in the resistance is large. This large change is observed as a significant change in slope, and this can be used to prevent cells from going into a thermal runaway condition. For flexible metal cans or pouch-type lithium-ion cells, combinations of changes in material properties along with thermal changes can be used as an indication for the initiation of an unsafe condition. Lithium-ion cells have a very high energy density, no memory effect, and almost 100 -percent efficiency of charge and discharge. However, due to the presence of a flammable electrolyte, along with the very high energy density and the capability of releasing oxygen from the cathode, these cells can go into a hazardous condition of venting, fire, and thermal runaway. Commercial lithium-ion cells have current and <b>voltage</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>devices</b> that are used to control the charge and discharge of the batteries. Some lithium-ion cells have internal protective devices, but when used in multi-cell configurations, these protective devices either do not protect or are themselves a hazard to the cell due to their limitations. These devices do not help in cases where the cells develop high impedance that suddenly causes them to go into a thermal runaway condition. Temperature monitoring typically helps with tracking the performance of a battery. But normal thermistors or thermal sensors do not provide the accuracy needed for this and cannot track a change in internal cell temperatures until it is too late to stop a thermal runaway...|$|R

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this review was to identify and examine {{the literature on the}} association between medication adherence self-reported questionnaires (SRQs) and medication <b>monitoring</b> <b>devices.</b> The primary literature search was performed for 1980 - 2009 using PubMed, PubMed In Process and Non-Indexed, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process, PsycINFO (EBSCO), CINAHL (EBSCO), Ovid HealthStar, EMBASE (Elsevier) and Cochrane Databases and using the following search terms: 'patient compliance', 'medication adherence', 'treatment compliance', 'drug monitoring', 'drug therapy', 'electronic', 'digital', 'computer', 'monitor', 'monitoring', 'drug', 'drugs', 'pharmaceutical preparations', 'compliance' and 'medications'. We identified studies that included SRQs and electronic <b>monitoring</b> <b>devices</b> to measure adherence and focused on the SRQs that were found to be moderately to highly correlated with the <b>monitoring</b> <b>devices.</b> Of the 1679 citations found via the primary search, 41 full-text articles were reviewed for correlation between <b>monitoring</b> <b>devices</b> and SRQs. A majority (68 %) of articles reported high (27 %), moderate (29 %) or significant (12 %) correlation between <b>monitoring</b> <b>devices</b> (37 using Medication Event Monitoring System [MEMS] and four using other devices) and SRQs (11 identified and numerous other unnamed SRQs). The most commonly used SRQs were the Adult/Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trial Group (AACTG/PACTG; 24. 4 %, 10 / 41) followed by the 4 -item Morisky (9. 8 %, 4 / 41), Brief Medication Questionnaire (9. 8 %, 4 / 41) and visual analogue scale (VAS; 7. 3 %, 3 / 41). Although study designs differed across the articles, SRQs appeared to report a higher rate of medication adherence (+ 14. 9 %) than <b>monitoring</b> <b>devices.</b> In conclusion, several medication adherence SRQs were validated using electronic <b>monitoring</b> <b>devices.</b> A majority of them showed high or moderate correlation with medication adherence measured using <b>monitoring</b> <b>devices,</b> and could be considered for measuring patient-reported adherence prospectively.

40|$|In {{networked}} systems, <b>monitoring</b> <b>devices</b> such as sensors {{are typically}} deployed to monitor various target locations. Targets are the {{points in the}} physical space at which events of some interest, such as random faults or attacks, can occur. Most often, these devices have limited energy supplies, and they can operate for a limited duration. As a result, energy-efficient monitoring of various target locations {{through a set of}} <b>monitoring</b> <b>devices</b> with limited energy supplies is a crucial problem in networked systems. In this paper, we study optimal scheduling of <b>monitoring</b> <b>devices</b> to maximize network coverage for detecting and isolating events on targets for a given network lifetime. The <b>monitoring</b> <b>devices</b> considered could remain active only for a fraction of the overall network lifetime. We formulate the problem of scheduling of <b>monitoring</b> <b>devices</b> as a graph labeling problem, which unlike other existing solutions, allows us to directly utilize the underlying network structure to explore the trade-off between coverage and network lifetime. In this direction, first we propose a greedy heuristic to solve the graph labeling problem, and then provide a game-theoretic solution to achieve near optimal graph labeling. Moreover, the proposed setup can be used to simultaneously solve the scheduling and placement of <b>monitoring</b> <b>devices,</b> which yields improved performance as compared to separately solving the placement and scheduling problems. Finally, we illustrate our results on various networks, including real-world water distribution networks...|$|R

50|$|Often, {{when the}} SPAN port is overloaded, packets will be dropped before {{reaching}} the <b>monitoring</b> <b>device.</b> There is also the possibility of losing some of the error packets that may be causing problems. If this data is not sent to the <b>monitoring</b> <b>device</b> because it is dropped, {{it is impossible to}} troubleshoot, no matter how advanced a device that may be used.
