40|$|This {{research}} project sought to extend {{experience in the}} experimental determination of aerodynamic forces through free-flight 1 : 9 model experiments of an integrated air-breathing hypersonic vehicle ScramSpace 1, at the University of Southern Queensland hypersonic wind tunnel. Aerodynamic forces experienced by the model in Mach 6 flow of air of approximately 120 millisecond duration were measured directly using an on-board orientation sensor and indirectly through high speed video image analysis. Force components and hence aerodynamic coefficients are determined both from the directly measured acceleration and rotation of the model in six degrees of freedom, broadcast in real-time via an on-board Bluetooth modem, and indirectly via analysis of standard Z-configuration Schlieren image capture at 2000 frames per second. The project demonstrated the viability of free-flight experiments at TUSQ with real <b>vehicle</b> <b>geometries</b> and provides future researchers’ confidence on which to expand analysis of the current data set or develop their own free-flight experiments. The complexities of free-flight experiments with real <b>vehicle</b> <b>geometries</b> and subsequent analysis is discussed {{in light of the}} reasonable correlation between the ScramSpace team CFD predicted range of to 1 from to degrees angle of attack with the experimentally determined mean drag coefficient,. ...|$|R

In this way, the uncertainty on mesh generation for shock-dominated flows is reduced and the use of adaptive mesh refinement could be made more efficient or, in some cases, even considered not necessary. The approach is verified against two and three-dimensional supersonic flows for conceptual exemplary geometries like wedges and revolution bodies and more real-world vehicles configurations like rockets and hypersonic aircraft. Qualitative and quantitative assessment of the solution-mesh pair quality is proposed to evaluate the quality of the resulting shock-conforming meshes...|$|R

40|$|A {{considerable}} {{body of work}} exists {{concerning the}} aerodynamic optimisation of the vehicle form in isolation. Some valid generalised conclusions have been reached concerning optimal and sub-optimal key <b>vehicle</b> <b>geometries</b> and their relevant ﬂow mechanics; generalised test forms representing various characteristic <b>vehicle</b> <b>geometries</b> - “squareback”, “notchback” and “fastback” - have been developed and extensively studied, with critical geometries highlighted. The study of organised vehicle convoys has similarly been researched since the early 1970 ’s primarily {{as a means to}} increase traﬃc throughput on existing road arterials, with ultimate “future-generation intelligent transport systems” envisioning scenarios where vehicles on major arterials may travel under fully automatic control, allowing possibilities in vehicle organisation not previously envisioned. Initial research simply considered reducing the spacing between vehicles travelling in localised groups to similar destinations - “platoons” - with traﬃc throughput scaling positively with platoon length and reduced spacing. The signiﬁcant majority of research in this ﬁeld is dedicated to developing concepts that increase traﬃc throughput; aerodynamic concerns are only recently being explored, however it is clear from relevant research concerning tandem bluﬀ bodies that aerodynamic interaction is heightened with closer proximity. A variety of recent studies examining aerodynamic force eﬀects in platooning conﬁrm advantages for all vehicles in homogenous platoons of squareback and notchback geometries. The case for fastback geometries is unclear, with preliminary studies suggesting that there can be an increase in the drag force of trailing vehicles {{in the wake of a}} fastback geometry. The work presented explores the fundamental phenomena underscoring the performance of two fastback vehicles travelling in close proximity. Vehicles are simulated using a well-known reference automotive form. A primary extension to existing works concerns eﬀect of changing the leading <b>vehicles</b> <b>geometry</b> to one of two diﬀerent (yet practically characteristic) fastback conﬁgurations, constituting an important variable known to oﬀer (in isolation) two markedly unique ﬂow structures and drag force coeﬃcients. A series of wind-tunnel experiments were performed where rear slantback angles were varied and measurements of pressures, forces and ﬂow visualisations were made on upstream and downstream models in addition to interrogation of the intervening gap ﬂow ﬁeld. It is demonstrated that irrespective of the upstream models form (and thus irrespective of dominant ﬂow phenomena for such a model considered in isolation), force characteristics remain broadly similar for leading and trailing models in the platoon, primarily owing to the development of streamwise vortices originating from the C-pillar of the leading model which are shown to entrain a high-momentum ﬂow between them, impinging on the trailing model forebody. A variety of methods - from qualitative ﬂow visualisation to spectral methods applied to dynamic data - are employed to demonstrate that even at the closest spacing examined, salient ﬂow phenomena of the leading and trailing models are broadly retained. A detailed investigation of gap ﬂows and trailing model spectra eﬀects as a function of leading model geometry and model spacing is also presented...|$|R

40|$|In {{this current}} project, the {{reflective}} behaviour of road surfaces {{under the influence}} of vehicular lighting was examined. Study of the relevant literature describes the results achieved up until now for the reflective behaviour of these road surfaces. It becomes clear that the majority of studies which have been carried out have concentrated on reflective behaviour caused by stationary road lighting. The relationships of special <b>vehicle</b> <b>geometry</b> with small angles for illumination and observation as well as measuring distances of up to 100 m, have never been considered in detail. It was possible to calculate the dependency of the luminance factor for illumination and observation angles which are present with the <b>vehicle</b> <b>geometry</b> in laboratory tests. The tests were supplemented with outside measurements. In order to measure the index values, a new kind of luminance measuring system was used which facilitates high resolution measurement of road surface luminance values. To carry out outside measurements easily, a portable reflectometer for road surfaces was developed. A criterion for the designation of reflective behaviour of road surfaces {{under the influence of}} vehicular lighting has been proposed. This is based on the correlation of the surface luminance factors in forward and reverse direction at various geometries. Furthermore, a simple method for describing the characteristics of reverse reflection from dry road surfaces was set up. (orig.)
