40|$|Aim A {{discussion}} of {{issues associated with}} <b>Values</b> <b>Based</b> Recruitment for nurse education programmes. Background <b>Values</b> <b>Based</b> Recruitment is a mandatory element in selection processes of students for Higher Education healthcare courses in England, including all programmes across nursing. Students are {{selected on the basis}} that their individual values align with those presented in the Constitution of the National Health Service. However, there are issues {{associated with the use of}} values as selection criteria that have been insufficiently addressed. These are discussed. Design Discussion paper. Data Sources This article is based on documents published on the website of the executive body responsible for the implementation of a policy regarding <b>Values</b> <b>Based</b> Recruitment in Higher Education Institutions up until June 2017 and our evaluation of the conceptualisation of <b>Values</b> <b>Based</b> Recruitment, underpinned by contemporary theory and literature. Implications for nursing <b>Values</b> <b>Based</b> Recruitment influences who is accepted onto a nurse education programme, but there has been limited critical evaluation regarding the effectiveness of employing values as selection criteria. Values are subject to interpretation and evidence regarding whether or how <b>Values</b> <b>Based</b> Recruitment will improve practice and care is lacking. The issues discussed in this article show that Higher Education Institutions offering nursing courses, whether in England or in other countries, should be critical and reflective regarding the implementation of <b>Values</b> <b>Based</b> Recruitment methods. Conclusion We call for a debate regarding the meaning and implications of <b>Values</b> <b>Based</b> Recruitment and further research regarding its validity and effectiveness. <br /...|$|R

25|$|The {{operation}} of the Foveon X3 sensor {{is quite different from}} that of the Bayer filter image sensor more commonly used in digital cameras. In the Bayer sensor, each photosite in the array consists of a single light sensor (either CMOS or CCD) that, as a result of filtration, is exposed to only one of the three primary colors, red, green, or blue. Constructing a full color image from a Bayer sensor requires demosaicing, an interpolative process in which the output pixel associated with each photosite is assigned an RGB <b>value</b> <b>based</b> in part on the level of red, green, and blue reported by those photosites adjacent to it. The Foveon X3 sensor creates its RGB color output for each photosite by combining the outputs of each of the stacked photodiodes at each of its photosites. This operational difference results in several significant consequences.|$|E

This caused many programs such as Compass Point and Reflections to help chapters grow and look at chapter life.

In 2003, a fine was instated for chapters with a number of girls under the campus total number of girls possible to recruit. This controversial fine was created with the intention of keeping chapters active in recruitment. The following year a GPA minimum and <b>value</b> <b>based</b> recruitment system were in place as a way to strengthen chapter membership.

40|$|The present paper explores whether {{sufficient}} grounds {{exist for}} articulating an indigenous <b>value</b> <b>base</b> {{for social work}} practice. Since the <b>value</b> <b>base</b> is fundamental for practice, {{it seems that the}} call for the development of an indigenous social work practice requires an indigenous <b>value</b> <b>base</b> to guide it. However, in the eyes of skeptics, the idea of an indigenous <b>value</b> <b>base</b> for social work practice {{may be the result of}} a conceptual confusion between 'positive' and 'normative' morality. To illustrate the need for making this distinction, this paper critically appraises the literature that argues for indigenization based on the recognition of the diversity and differences of cultural values. Building on this analysis, the paper suggests that we need to re-examine the conceptual issue of whether the assumption of the discontinuity of social explanation and normative evaluation is warranted.

The {{aim of this study}} is to gain an understanding of personnel and managers perception of the <b>value</b> <b>base</b> and its implementation in the practical work with the elderly. A qualitative method has been used to analyze the questions raised by the aim of this study. The empirical data was retrieved by semi-structured interviews with managers and their personnel in homecare service The empirical data was analyzed on the basis of the neo-institutional theory, Michael Lipsky’s theory concerning street-level bureaucrats and previous research regarding implementation of social policy and the practical home-care work. The result present that the <b>value</b> <b>base</b> is considered to be a vague idea. Both managers and personnel states that there has been minor changes in the units since the legislative change. Despite that, the results also show that the managers and the personnel consider the <b>value</b> <b>base</b> to be important for the elderly. The personnel thought it could lead to a better quality in the units. The managers had a different opinion, but they thought that the <b>value</b> <b>base</b> could generate discussions regarding the execution of the actions in the homecare services. The results of the study also reveal difficulties for the managers to implement the <b>value</b> <b>base</b> and for the personnel in the practical work with the elderly. ...|$|R
25|$|The new {{non-domestic}} {{rating system}} {{became known as}} business rates, or sometimes the universal business rate. It retained from its predecessors {{the concept of a}} series of local rating lists, with each property being assessed for a rateable <b>value</b> <b>based</b> on rental values. Rating lists were prepared and maintained by the Valuation Office (reconstituted in 1991 as an UK Government Executive Agency, the Valuation Office Agency), while billing and collection was the responsibility of local authorities. Previously, local authorities had decided what proportion of rateable values to charge; the new system featured a centrally set multiplier, {{often referred to as the}} Uniform Business Rate, by which the basic bill was calculated. The bill could be further modified by various reliefs, including the newly introduced transitional relief, which was designed to smooth large changes in liability due to revaluations. The multiplier was calculated to ensure that, on average, bills rose by no more than the rate of inflation.|$|E

500|$|Differences between prior mercantilists and Cantillon arise {{early in}} Essai, {{regarding}} {{the origins of}} wealth and price formation on the market. Cantillon distinguishes between wealth and money, considering wealth in itself [...] "nothing but the food, conveniences, and pleasures of life." [...] While Cantillon advocated an [...] "intrinsic" [...] theory of <b>value,</b> <b>based</b> on the input of land and labour (cost of production), he is considered to have touched upon a subjective theory of value. Cantillon held that market prices are not immediately decided by intrinsic value, but are derived from supply and demand. He considered market prices to be derived by comparing supply, the quantity of a particular good in a particular market, to demand, the quantity of money brought to be exchanged. Believing market prices to tend towards the intrinsic value of a good, Cantillon may have also originated the uniformity-of-profit principle—changes in the market price of a good may lead to changes in supply, reflecting a rise or fall in profit.|$|E
