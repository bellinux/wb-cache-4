For liquid crystalline fibers with molecular orientation along the fiber's axis the model predicts that capillary instabilities will break the fiber into an array of droplets, {{just as in the}} case of isotropic Newtonian fibers. The characteristic growth rate and wavelength of the instability are functions of the orientation dependent surface tension and the extensional viscosity. The liquid crystal surface elasticity tends to increase the wavelength and to decrease the growth rate of the fastest growing mode when compared to that of Newtonian fibers.

Numerical results for creep under static load show that for an appropriate class of materials with slowly fading memory there is a range of applied loads for which an initially homogeneous deformation evolves into a well-defined neck whose edges, after a period of relatively quiescent incubation, advance rapidly along the fiber and in so doing transform moderately stretched material into highly stretched, i. e., drawn material.

A novel fiber bundle model is introduced which combines the viscoelastic constitutive behaviour and the strain controlled breaking of fibers.

40|$|Abstract In this paper, a micromechanical {{extension}} of the finite-volume direct averaging micromechanics theory (FVDAM) is presented for evaluation of the homogenized relaxation moduli of linear viscoelastic unidirectional fiber reinforced composites with periodic microstructures. Such materials are assumed as composed of repeating unit cell with arbitrary internal architectural arrangements of fibers coated by thin flexible interphases. These interphases are replaced by equivalent imperfect interface elements with imposed continuity in tractions and discontinuity in displacements. Indeed, the proposed computational procedure allows an easy and efficient treatment of the displacement discontinuity condition across the interfaces. The viscoelastic behavior of the constituent phases is modeled using the generalized Maxwell model. The formulation is particularly derived for the range of small strains, operating directly in the time domain using a numerical incremental time-stepping procedure based {{on the concept of}} internal stress variables.

This complexity is usually modeled directly, obscuring the underlying physics, which can often be characterized by a small number of physical parameters. In this paper, we derive a closed-form expression for a low dimensional model that reproduces the stochastic dynamical evolution of time-dependent failure in heterogeneous materials, and efficiently captures the spatial fluctuations and critical behavior near failure. Our construction is based on a novel time domain formulation of Fiber Bundle Models, which represent spatial variations in material strength via lattices of brittle, <b>viscoelastic</b> <b>fiber</b> elements. We apply the inverse transform method of random number sampling in order to construct an exact stochastic jump process for the failure sequence in a material with arbitrary strength distributions. We also complement this with a mean field approximation that captures the coupled constitutive dynamics, and validate both with numerical simulations.

By melting these films and investigating the subsequent processes of hole formation and growth, and fiber thinning and breakup, many interesting phenomena can be explored, including the nucleation of holes, shear-thinning during hole formation, finite-extensibility of capillary thinning <b>viscoelastic</b> <b>fibers,</b> and confinement effects on entanglement of polymer chains. Free-standing films in the melt are unstable and rupture due to instabilities. The mechanism of membrane failure and hole nucleation is modeled using an energy barrier approach which is shown to capture the dependence of hole nucleation on thickness. The formed holes grow exponentially and are found to grow under a shear thinning, nonlinear viscoelastic, high shear strain regime. These holes impinge upon each other to form suspended fibers. The fibers thin according to {{a model for the}} elasto-capillary thinning of the suspended viscoelastic fluid filaments. Monitoring fiber thinning allows for the acquisition of rheological properties as well as the transient, apparent extensional viscosity giving insight into strain hardening and eventual steady-state extensional viscosity. The decay and breakup of these fibers and their interconnected branched structure indicates the effects of confinement on chain entanglement in ultra-thin films. A transition below a critical film thickness, comparable to the dimensions of a polymer chain, shows drastically reduced interchain entanglements and a remarkably faster breakup of suspended fibers. The processes of fiber formation from the melting of ultra-thin films are explored in high detail and produce a new technique for the investigation of rheological and material properties, confinement effects, and the dynamics of thin films and polymer chains. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} provided {{insight into}} the biomechanics of traumatic brain stem injury by characterizing {{the response of the}} brainstem to mechanical deformation. The brainstem is a region of the CNS characterized by axonal fibers longitudinally organized in parallel tracts. This distinct structure helps dictate the material response of the brainstem and suggests that this region may respond to mechanical insult as a transversely isotropic structure. The objective of this work was to investigate this assumption through material testing in three mutually perpendicular directions. ^ A custom designed stress relaxation, oscillatory shear testing apparatus (STA) for testing soft biological tissues in simple shear was constructed and validated. The STA was validated by measurements of complex shear moduli of three mixtures of silicone gel with viscoelastic properties similar to soft biological tissue that were tested in both the STA and a commercially available solids rheometer. ^ The STA was used to perform stress relaxation tests on adult porcine brainstem to characterize the mechanical response of the brainstem. These experiments did not confirm our hypothesis of the brainstem 2 ̆ 7 s transversely isotropic material response. Specifically, the calculated relaxation moduli did not vary with testing orientation. ^ We hypothesized that due to the presence of significant relaxation in these tissues, the mechanical response of the brainstem is highly loading rate dependent. A series of dynamic oscillating shear tests in three mutually perpendicular directions were performed to further characterize the anisotropic nature of the brainstem at high loading rates. These experiments confirmed our hypothesis that the brainstem may be described as a transversely isotropic material; the complex moduli in the transverse direction were significantly higher than the other two moduli that were indistinguishable from one another. ^ A novel fiber reinforced composite model composed of <b>viscoelastic</b> <b>fibers</b> surrounded by a viscoelastic matrix was developed to analyze the oscillatory shear data.

40|$|AbstractTension {{generation}} in endothelial {{cells of the}} aorta, spleen, and eye occurs in actin stress fibers, and is necessary for normal cell function. Sarcomeres are the tension-generating units of actin stress fibers in endothelial cells. How sarcomeres generate and maintain tension in stress fibers is not well understood. Using femtosecond laser ablation, we severed living stress fibers and measured sarcomere contraction under zero tension. The length of the sarcomere decreased in two phases: an instantaneous initial response, followed by a slower change in length attributed to myosin activity. The latter phase ceased abruptly after a minimum sarcomere length was reached, suggesting a rigid resistance that prevents further contraction. Furthermore, severed, contracted stress fibers did not relax when treated with myosin inhibitors, indicating that contracted stress fibers do not store elastic potential energy. These novel measurements combined with modeling suggest that myosin-generated forces in adjacent sarcomeres are directly in balance, and argue against sarcomere models with springlike elements in parallel with myosin contractile elements.

The analysis considers both temporally stationary and oscillatory mechanical signals and accounts for cytosolic drag on the stress fibers. To elucidate the physical parameters that govern mechanical signal transmission, we initially focus on the highly simplified case of a single stress fiber. The results demonstrate that the dynamics of mechanical signal transmission depend on whether the applied force leads to transverse or axial motion of the stress fiber. For transverse motion, mechanical signal transmission is dominated by prestress while fiber elasticity has a negligible effect. Conversely, signal transmission for axial motion is mediated uniquely by elasticity due to the absence of a prestress restoring force. Mechanical signal transmission is significantly delayed by stress fiber material viscosity, while cytosolic damping becomes important only for longer stress fibers.

40|$|Cartilage is {{considered}} a biphasic material in which the solid is composed of proteoglycans and collagen. In biphasic tissue, the hydraulic pressure is believed to bear most of the load under higher strain rates and its dissipation due to fluid flow determines creep and relaxation behavior. In equilibrium, hydraulic pressure is zero and load bearing is transferred to the solid matrix. The viscoelasticity of the collagen network also contributes to its time-dependent behavior, and the osmotic pressure to load bearing in equilibrium. The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine the relative contributions of hydraulic pressure, viscoelastic collagen stress, solid matrix stiffness and osmotic pressure to load carriage in cartilage under transient and equilibrium conditions. Unconfined compression experiments were simulated using a fibril-reinforced poroviscoelastic model of articular cartilage, including water, fibrillar viscoelastic collagen and non-fibrillar charged glycosaminoglycans. The relative contributions of hydraulic and osmotic pressures and stresses in the fibrillar and non-fibrillar network were evaluated in the superficial, middle and deep zone of cartilage under five different strain rates and after relaxation. Initially upon loading, the hydraulic pressure carried most of the load in all three zones. The osmotic swelling pressure carried most of the equilibrium load. In the surface zone, where the fibers were loaded in tension, the collagen network carried 20 % of the load for all strain rates. The importance of these fibers was illustrated by artificially modifying the fiber architecture, which reduced the overall stiffness of cartilage in all conditions. In conclusion, although hydraulic pressure dominates the transient behavior during cartilage loading, due to its viscoelastic nature the superficial zone collagen fibers carry a substantial part of the load under transient conditions. This becomes increasingly important with higher strain rates. The interesting and striking new insight from this study suggests that under equilibrium conditions, the swelling pressure generated by the combination of proteoglycans and collagen reinforcement accounts cartilage stiffness for more than 90 % of the loads carried by articular cartilage. This finding is different from the common thought that load is transferred from fluid to solid and is carried by the aggregate modulus of the solid. Rather, it is transformed from hydraulic to osmotic swelling pressure. These results show the importance of considering both (<b>viscoelastic)</b> collagen <b>fibers</b> as well as swelling pressure in studies of the (transient) mechanical behavior of cartilage...|$|R

The analysis considers both temporally stationary and oscillatory mechanical signals and accounts for cytosolic drag on the stress fibers. To elucidate the physical parameters that govern mechanical signal transmission, we initially focus on the highly simplified case of a single stress fiber. The results demonstrate that the dynamics of mechanical signal transmission depend on whether the applied force leads to transverse or axial motion of the stress fiber. For transverse motion, mechanical signal transmission is dominated by prestress while fiber elasticity has a negligible effect. Conversely, signal transmission for axial motion is mediated uniquely by elasticity due to the absence of a prestress restoring force. Mechanical signal transmission is significantly delayed by stress fiber material viscosity, while cytosolic damping becomes important only for longer stress fibers. Only transverse motion yields the rapid and long-distance mechanical signal transmission dynamics observed experimentally. For simple networks of stress fibers, mechanical signals are transmitted rapidly to the nucleus when the fibers are oriented largely orthogonal to the applied force, whereas the presence of fibers parallel to the applied force slows down mechanical signal transmission significantly. The present results suggest that cytoskeletal prestress mediates rapid mechanical signal transmission and allows temporally oscillatory signals in the physiological frequency range to travel a long distance without significant decay due to material viscosity and/or cytosolic drag. © 2012 Hwang, Barakat...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{studied the}} effect of titin-based passive tension on {{sarcomere}} structure by simultaneously measuring passive tension and low-angle x-ray diffraction patterns on passive fiber bundles from rabbit skinned psoas muscle. We used a stretch-hold-release protocol with measurement of x-ray diffraction patterns at various passive tension levels during the hold phase before and after passive stress relaxation. Measurements were performed in relaxing solution without and with dextran T- 500 to compress the lattice toward physiological levels. The myofilament lattice spacing was measured in the A-band (d 1, 0) and Z-disk (dZ) regions of the sarcomere. The axial spacing of the thick-filament backbone was determined from the sixth myosin meridional reflection (M 6) and the equilibrium positions of myosin heads from the fourth myosin layer line peak position and the I 1, 1 /I 1, 0 intensity ratio. Total passive tension was measured during the x-ray experiments, and a differential extraction technique {{was used to determine}} the relations between collagen- and titin-based passive tension and sarcomere length. Within the employed range of sarcomere lengths (∼ 2. 2 – 3. 4 μm), titin accounted for > 80 % of passive tension. X-ray results indicate that titin compresses both the A-band and Z-disk lattice spacing with <b>viscoelastic</b> behavior when <b>fibers</b> are swollen after skinning, and elastic behavior when the lattice is reduced with dextran. Titin also increases the axial thick-filament spacing, M 6, in an elastic manner in both the presence and absence of dextran. No changes were detected in either I 1, 1 /I 1, 0 or the position of peaks on the fourth myosin layer line during passive stress relaxation. Passive tension and M 6 measurements were converted to thick-filament compliance, yielding a value of ∼ 85 m/N, which is several-fold larger than the thick-filament compliance determined by others during the tetanic tension plateau of activated intact muscle. This difference {{can be explained by the}} fact that thick filaments are more compliant at low tension (passive muscle) than at high tension (tetanic tension). The implications of our findings are discussed...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that approximately 375, 000 people experience knee injuries every year in the United States. The majority of the pathologies affect the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and the medial collateral ligament (MCL). Thus, a thorough characterization of the mechanical properties of the ligaments is needed to understand the etiology of their injuries and to improve the strategies of their treatment. The first chapter of this dissertation offers a brief overview of the morphology and mechanics of the ligaments. Since injuries are estimated to occur at strain rates that range from 50 %/s to 150, 000 %/s, studying the mechanical behavior of ligaments at various strain rates is imperative. In the second chapter, a structural constitutive model is formulated by taking into account the nonlinearity, anisotropy, incompressibility, and strain rate-related properties of the ligaments. The collagen fibers, which comprise the ligament, are assumed to be the only load-bearing component of the tissue. They are oriented in various directions, undulated in the stress-free configuration, and they gradually become straight upon deformation. Moreover, the collagen fibers are characterized by a Kelvin-Voigt-type <b>viscoelastic</b> behavior. The <b>fiber</b> spatial orientation and gradual recruitment are represented statistically by probability density functions. Published experimental data on the ACLs are used to assess the constitutive model. The most severe of the knee ligament injuries are partial and complete tears. Thus, there is a compelling need to understand the mechanical failure behavior of ligaments. In the third chapter, a structural constitutive model for the description of the ligament tensile properties is proposed. The model reproduces the three-regions of the nonlinear stress-strain relationship of ligaments. The collagen fibers contribute to the overall tissue's response after becoming taut and before failing and they are assumed to behave as a linear elastic material. The fiber recruitment and failure processes are stochastically defined. Available experimental data for the MCLs are employed to validate the constitutive relation. Furthermore, the generalization to a three-dimensional model is also given. Future research directions toward the development of a structural constitutive model for the subfailure behavior of ligaments are indicated in the fourth chapter and conclusions are drawn in the fifth chapter...|$|R
