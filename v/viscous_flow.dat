5|$|The {{thickness}} of the velocity boundary layer is normally defined as {{the distance from the}} solid body to {{the point at which the}} <b>viscous</b> <b>flow</b> velocity is 99% of the freestream velocity (the surface velocity of an inviscid flow). Displacement Thickness is an alternative definition stating that the boundary layer represents a deficit in mass flow compared to inviscid flow with slip at the wall. It is the distance by which the wall would have to be displaced in the inviscid case to give the same total mass flow as the viscous case. The no-slip condition requires the flow velocity at the surface of a solid object be zero and the fluid temperature be equal to the temperature of the surface. The flow velocity will then increase rapidly within the boundary layer, governed by the boundary layer equations, below.|$|E
25|$|The {{general view}} in the fluid {{mechanics}} community is that, from a practical point of view, the paradox is solved along the lines suggested by Prandtl. A formal mathematical proof is lacking, and difficult to provide, as in so many other fluid-flow problems involving the Navier–Stokes equations (which are used to describe <b>viscous</b> <b>flow).</b>|$|E
25|$|Inviscid flow {{was further}} {{analyzed}} by various mathematicians (Leonhard Euler, Jean le Rond d'Alembert, Joseph Louis Lagrange, Pierre-Simon Laplace, Siméon Denis Poisson) and <b>viscous</b> <b>flow</b> was explored by {{a multitude of}} engineers including Jean Léonard Marie Poiseuille and Gotthilf Hagen. Further mathematical justification was provided by Claude-Louis Navier and George Gabriel Stokes in the Navier–Stokes equations, and boundary layers were investigated (Ludwig Prandtl, Theodore von Kármán), while various scientists such as Osborne Reynolds, Andrey Kolmogorov, and Geoffrey Ingram Taylor advanced the understanding of fluid viscosity and turbulence.|$|E
40|$|An {{adaptive}} remeshing method {{using both}} triangular and quadrilateral elements suitable for high-speed <b>viscous</b> <b>flows</b> is presented.

Examples of inviscid and viscous adaptations for high-speed flows are presented...|$|R
40|$|Most {{unsteady}} <b>viscous</b> <b>flows</b> may {{be grouped}} into two categories, i. e., forced and self-sustained oscillations. Examples of forced oscillations occur in turbomachinery and in internal combustion engines while self-sustained oscillations prevail in vortex shedding, inlet buzz, and wing flutter.

40|$|The {{classical}} Lagrangian {{approach will}} lead to infinite deformation of meshes, especially for <b>viscous</b> <b>flows.</b> In this paper, we will use the unified coordinate system approach to compute <b>viscous</b> <b>flows.</b> This approach, invented by Hui and his coworkers, contains an inner parameter leading to a continuous switch between the classical Lagrangian approach and Eulerian approach. Severe grid deformation can be avoided by controlling this inner parameter...|$|R
25|$|This idea {{can work}} fairly well when the Reynolds number is high. However, {{problems}} such as those involving solid boundaries may require that the viscosity be included. Viscosity cannot be neglected near solid boundaries because the no-slip condition generates a thin region of large strain rate, the boundary layer, in which viscosity effects dominate and which thus generates vorticity. Therefore, to calculate net forces on bodies (such as wings), <b>viscous</b> <b>flow</b> equations must be used: inviscid flow theory fails to predict drag forces, a limitation known as the d'Alembert's paradox.|$|E
25|$|In {{a dynamic}} sense, the {{response}} of a gel to an alternating force (oscillation or vibration) will depend upon the period or frequency of vibration. As indicated here, even most simple liquids will exhibit some elastic response at shear rates or frequencies exceeding 5 x 106 cycles per second. Experiments on such short time scales probe the fundamental motions of the primary particles (or particle clusters) which constitute the lattice structure or aggregate. The increasing resistance of certain liquids to flow at high stirring speeds is one manifestation of this phenomenon. The ability of a condensed body {{to respond to a}} mechanical force by <b>viscous</b> <b>flow</b> is thus strongly dependent on the time scale over which the load is applied, and thus the frequency and amplitude of the stress wave in oscillatory experiments.|$|E
25|$|In {{a static}} sense, the {{fundamental}} difference between a liquid and a solid is that the solid has elastic resistance against a shearing stress while a liquid does not. Thus, a simple liquid will not typically support a transverse acoustic phonon, or shear wave. Gels have been described by Born as liquids in which an elastic resistance against shearing survives, yielding both viscous and elastic properties. It has been shown theoretically that in a certain low-frequency range, polymeric gels should propagate shear waves with relatively low damping. The distinction between a sol (solution) and a gel therefore appears to be understood in a manner analogous to the practical distinction between the elastic and plastic deformation ranges of a metal. The distinction lies {{in the ability to}} respond to an applied shear force via macroscopic <b>viscous</b> <b>flow.</b>|$|E

S. equations can be efficiently and accurately simulated for flows of aerodynamic interest.

40|$|An {{agglomeration}} multigrid {{strategy is}} developed and implemented for {{the solution of}} three-dimensional steady <b>viscous</b> <b>flows.</b> The method enables convergence acceleration with minimal additional memory overheads, and is completely automated, in that it can deal with grids of arbitrary construction. The multigrid technique is validated by comparing the delivered convergence rates with those obtained by a previously developed overset-mesh multigrid approach, and by demonstrating grid independent convergence rates for aerodynamic problems on very large grids.

The flow equations are solved {{within the framework}} of the multigrid method using a four-grid level W-cycle, while the kappa-epsilon equations are iterated only on the finest grid.
