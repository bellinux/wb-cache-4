40|$|Name of the {{dissertation}} is:``View {{of sexually}} transmitted diseases in case of assisting professions``. I decided to deal with {{sexually transmitted diseases}} {{because the number of}} these diseases is relatively high and numbers of newly ill people keep increasing. This opinion is confirmed by the fact that, for example, number of HIV positive individuals in the Czech Republic slightly exceeded 100 in the year 1990 whereas the number HIV positive individuals was 1, 344 in the year 2009, i. e. 19 years later. Considering also the fact that this disease is an incurable one and treatment of this disease is demanding on the ill people from thein mental as well as physical aspekt and considering also the total effect for society, it is very important indeed to pay attention on this issue. Theoretical part divides sexually transmitted diseases according the often used division in classic gener√°l diseases. They include inguinal granuloma, gonorrhoea, soft chancre, syphilis and <b>venereal</b> <b>lymphogranuloma.</b> Another diseases which include HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, genital herpes, infections caused by the virus Human papillom, scabies or pubic louses were dealt with only marginally. The last chapter is focused on assisting professions. The goal of the work was to look at the issue {{from the point of view}} of assisting professions staff. To find out whether they are interested in the issue, what is their awareness, etc. This goal has been met. Conversations, for example, revealed that employees who are in everyday contact with people who live risky way of living (drug addicts, homeless people, etc.) are better aware of issue concering sexually transmitted diseases than respondents who work with children or seniors. None of the respondents underwent any additional training in this issue. The selected methodology was represented by quality research and the selected method was represented by partially controlled interview with six selected representatives from assisting professions. The overall knowledge will be used not only to find out but also the to complete or correct information on the issue for employees in assisting professions. Information on the issue can be further disseminated among clients via these professionals within primary prevention...|$|E

Another <b>venereal</b> disease, <b>lymphogranuloma</b> inguinale, may shorten life {{but it must}} affect few or no proposers for life {{assurance}} and is unlikely to interest you. I will start with gonorrhoea because it is most easily disposed of. It is admitted that gonorrhoea can cause myocardial and endocardial lesions, but with due allowance for cases being overlooked {{at the time of}} the gonococcal infection it is difficult to believe that any residua of this kind would escape notice {{at the time of the}} medical examination. The same applies to the rare renal and nervous complications which occasionally occur in gonorrhoea, and the only residua of gonorrhoea which seem to be worthy of any discussion in the present case are stricture of the urethra and fibrous prostate. As regards stricture of the urethra, I think every genito-urinary surgeon will agree that, contrary to experi-ence twenty or more years ago, this condition is now a relatively rare sequel of gonorrhoea. This is thanks mainly to the mildness of local applications in modem treatment and perhaps also to the care over tests of cure. For information on the significance of fibrous prostate I am relying on a paper by Mr. Kenneth Walker (I 936) in judging that it is also very uncommon in relation to the frequency of gonorrhoea and that it must be a rare shortener of life. I ought to qualify all this by saying that Mr. Walker's article did not give statistics, but the strong impression that the condition is relatively uncommon is supported by his statement that it is frequently associated with stricture and by the following paragraph with which the article ended. " Mention has been made in this article of the diminished frequency of stricture as the result of an improvement in th...|$|R
