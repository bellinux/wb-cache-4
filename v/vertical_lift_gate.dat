40|$|On {{the morning}} of August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans. A storm of Katrinas {{strength}} and intensity is expected to cause major flooding but the main portion of the destruction was caused by its exposure to failures at almost all levels of responsibility. In Katrinas wake, a Grand Plan for Louisiana is introduced by the Louisiana State University. In this thesis, {{the confluence of the}} Mississippi River Gulf Outlet (MRGO) and Gulf Intracoastal Waterway (GIWW) is analyzed. It is recommended to implement two flood protection structures in combination with a straight levee alignment between them. This option has the best high water safety and most positive ecological influence. It is concluded that closing the MRGO is the favorable option for the future development. The GIWW is highly navigated and should remain open A <b>vertical</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>gate</b> is chosen as optimal flood protection structure. Its hoisting system is complex but well known, providing a reliable closure system. It can also safely discharge excess water, which represents a main functional requirement. Quantifying time dependent processes leads to conclude that the optimal combination is a gate height of + 30 ft (10. 6 m, MSL) and leakage width of 0. 05 m at the sides and 0. 15 m at the bottom. This has the benefit that no perfect closure is needed during a storm event, which reduces the need for maintenance and increases the reliability of the closing process. In the design of the steel <b>lifting</b> <b>gate</b> reference is made to the Hartel Canal Barrier, a proven protection scheme in the Netherlands. The total mass of the gate amounts 1060 tonnes. The main contributors are the bottom and center lens-shaped barrier sections. The front plate forms the largest single contributor at 20 % of the total mass of the gate. The upper lens-shaped barrier section requires only 40 % of the steel volume needed for the leading lens-shaped sections and results in a weight reduction of 126 tonnes.

These storms result in water setup that can cause severe problems for the very low area in the Eastern part of the Netherlands.

Based on this design the construction costs have been determined for such a barrier and these have been compared to the construction costs for the original barrier. Then maintenance strategies based on decompositions for both types of barriers have been determined in order to predict and calculate the expected maintenance costs in a deterministic way.

The dam was built to a height of 59.13 m (above the river bed level) between 1947 (start of construction) and 1965 (year of commissioning). It has a gross storage capacity of 2.025 km3, live storage of 63.00 BCF at full reservoir level and a dead storage of 8.50 BCF at RL (reservoir level) of 631.54 m.

50|$|A {{major project}} of river {{engineering}} {{was carried out}} in 1596, when the course of the Rother was diverted around the northern edge of Rye to join the Tillingham. The scheme was expensive, and untimately was not a success, as the Rother reverted to its previous course to the east on Rye in 1610. Another attempt at engineering the mouths of the three rivers began in 1723, when an Act of Parliament was obtained to authorise {{the construction of a new}} channel from the Brede near Winchelsea to the sea. After great expense and 63 years work, the channel, called the New Harbour, was opened in July 1787, and the old outlet to the sea was closed. A wet autumn caused extensive flooding of the hinterland, and in November 1787, after just four months, the New Harbour was abandoned, and the old channel from Rye to the sea was reopened. A navigable sluice was constructed across the Tillingham in 1786, just above Strand Quay. Its function was to prevent salt water flowing up the river, and to improve the scouring of the channel below it. At the same time, wharfs were constructed at Ferry Bridge, Leasam Farm, Marshall’s Farm and Marley Farm, the final one around 2 mi above the sluice. It is not entirely clear how the lock was used, since maps from 1872 carry a note that the sluice was the highest point to which tides flowed, but maps from 1898 and 1907 state that tides flowed for a further 3 mi beyond the sluice when the lock gates were opened. Navigation on most of the Tillingham ended in 1928, when the sluice was replaced by a <b>vertical</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>gate.</b>|$|R

40|$|The United States of America – {{and more}} {{specific}} {{the state of}} Illinois – {{are dealing with a}} problem of Asian carps spreading from inward waterways to the Great Lakes. The Asian carp was originally brought to America to be used in study?s on agricultural pounds, but escaped after series of flooding. The Asian carp has no natural enemies in the waters of the United States and are heading via the Mississippi River to the Great Lakes. The threat of the Asian carp lies in the 8 ̆ 4 special? property that these fish have a large appetite and tend to eat everything in their way which is smaller than them. They reproduce rapidly which means that in relatively short periods entire areas can be cleared from plankton and aquatic plants. Their presence can ruin entire vegetation?s and especially when the would enter the Great Lakes, huge economic and environmental problems could arise. Due to these imminent problems multiple studies have been made to stop these fish, but yet so far no actual solution has come up. Even an electrical curtain wasn?t able to stop them. The only connection between the Mississippi River and the Great Lakes – the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal – is a perfect location for a structure that can stop these fish, but still allowing the inland water vessels to gain access to Chicago and the Great Lakes. This canal is designed as part of the sewage system of the Chicago Area Waterway System and is needed to remain a proper water quality – closing this canal off will lead to large investments in multiple wastewater treatment plants. A proper solution is therefore desired which lead to an passage for vessels without providing a passage for fish heading upstream towards the Great Lakes. A surroundings and stakeholders analysis showed that the best location for such a solution will be in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal near the place Lockport. Meeting the requirements the best solution for this problem is the design of a 8 ̆ 4 water-free <b>vertical</b> boat <b>lift?.</b> This design can be combined with the renovation/renewing of the current Lockport lock in the canal. The water-free <b>vertical</b> boat <b>lift</b> has similarities with a regular <b>vertical</b> boat <b>lift,</b> but has the special property that it lifts the vessels to the upstream water level without the help of water. A vessels will enter the lock chamber via two <b>vertical</b> <b>lifting</b> doors whereafter the water is drained out of it. The vessel will the lower until it rests on inflatable rubber bags on the floor. Hereby all the water and fish will be caught in a water storage area underneath the lock chamber from where the water and fish will be released downstream again. Afterwards the empty lock chamber with the vessel will be lifted to the upstream water level from where water can be pumped back in and the vessel can continue. The lock chamber is made out of steel walls of 7, 5 meters high in combination with a steel/concrete combined floor of 18, 5 meters width and 100 meters length. The concrete slab will be inclined to gain a 1 : 20 slope for a proper outflow of the water and fish. The inflatable bags are placed over the width every 10 meters and the 2 x 2 meter gaps are placed in pairs of two in-between. The lock chamber is closed-off by two <b>vertical</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>gates</b> and is supported by 42 steel cables with a diameter of 103 mm distributed over the length. The cables will go up over large pulleys, which will be mounted on the total construction for support. The counter weights have to be adjustable due to the difference in weight of the lock chamber when filled and emptied. By using variable weights the mass can be regulated, which leads to better handling of the lifting/lowering equipment. This report shows that a decent solution to stop Asian carp from invading the Great Lakes lies {{in the form of a}} <b>vertical</b> boat <b>lift</b> that lifts the vessels without the help of water. Further researches will lead to a better conclusion regarding the feasibility of this design and the applicability to the Chicago Sanitary and Shipping Canal regarding the main objective: stopping fish from invading Lake Michigan!Hydraulic StructuresHydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|Most {{contemporary}} {{risk assessment}} techniques, such as failure modes and effect analysis (FMEA), {{fault tree analysis}} (FTA), and probabilistic risk analysis (PRA) rely on a chain-of-event paradigm of accident causation. Event-based techniques have some limitations {{for the study of}} modern engineering systems; specifically hydropower dams. They are not suited to handle complex computer-intensive systems, complex human-machine interactions, and systems-of-systems with distributed decision-making that cut across both physical and organizational boundaries. The emerging paradigm today, however, is not to analyze dam systems separately by breaking the major disciplines into stand-alone vertical analyses; but to explore the possibilities inherent in taking a systems approach to modeling the reliability of flow-control functions within the entire system. This dissertation reports on the development and application of systems reliability models to operational aspects of a hydropower cascade in Northern Ontario: The Lower Mattagami River (LMR) Project operated by Ontario Power Generation (OPG). The reliable performance of a spillway system depends on the many environmental and operational demand functions placed upon it by basin hydrology, the hydraulic conditions at reservoirs and dams, operating rules for the cascade of reservoirs in the basin, and the vagaries of human and natural factors such as operator interventions or natural disturbances such as ice and floating debris (Regan, 2010). These systems interact to control floods, condition flows, and filter high frequencies in the river discharge. Their function is to retain water volumes and to pass flows in a controlled way. The reliability of flow-control systems is a broad topic that covers structural, mechanical, electrical, control systems and subsystems reliability, as well as human interactions, organization issues, policies and procedures. All 3 of these occur in a broad spectrum of environmental conditions. A systems simulation approach is presented for grappling with these varied influences on flow-control systems in hydropower installations. The Mattagami River cascade operated by Ontario Power Generation is a series of four power stations along the Mattagami River and the Adams Creek bypass channel from Little Long GS at the top to the cascade to the Mattagami River below Kipling GS at the bottom. The number of riparians in the river flood plain is few and there is no commercial riverine navigation, so potential loss of life is small or negligible and operational safety dominates. Upstream of Little Long dam is a seasonally-varying inflow and a reservoir. The remaining three dams downstream (Smokey Falls, Harmon, and Kipling) have little storage capacity. Each dam has two <b>vertical</b> <b>lift</b> <b>gates</b> and all four structures have approximately the same spillway capacity. Far downstream, the river discharges into Hudson's Bay. Hydrological and climate frequency data are available for a period of 50 years. The problem facing the project was to conceptualize a systems engineering model for the operation of the dams, spillways, and other components; then to employ the model through stochastic simulation to investigate protocols for the safe operation of the spillway and flow control system. Details of the modeling, analysis, and results for safe operation of the cascade are presented...|$|R
40|$|Hurricane Sandy made {{landfall}} in Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States (U. S.) October 29, 2012 as a post-tropical cyclone. With a {{wind field}} of approximately 1000 mi (1600 km) and a near 90 degree landfall angle with the coast, the storm generated an 11. 6 ft (3. 52 m) storm tide above {{mean sea level}} (MSL) at the Battery, New York City, and resulted in more than $ 65 billion in total damage including the U. S. and the Caribbean. With the threat of future sea level rise and the possibility of stronger future storms, implementing flood protection measures in New York City and the surrounding areas is an imperative. This thesis is a response to Hurricane Sandy. It presents a feasible flood risk reduction system for Jamaica Bay, New York City, and a preliminary design for a storm surge barrier to be constructed as a part of this system. This thesis also addresses possible environmental impacts, pollution, and vessel traffic in the bay. Because it is a preliminary design, and due to the time constraints of a MSc. thesis, the design of the storm surge barrier is neither complete nor detailed. Some aspects of the barrier are developed and reasonable assumptions are made for other aspects based on similar past projects. The Jamaica Bay Flood Risk Reduction System (JBFRRS) has been designed to be implemented in three (3) phases with the final phase beginning in 2032. The reason for building the JBFRRS in phases is to decrease the initial costs of the system. The purpose of this phased approach is also to reduce the pollution in the bay and to allow the JBFRRS to adapt to sea level rise as it occurs. Due to the uncertainty of future sea level rise, storm intensity and frequency, an adaptive approach could be the most applicable. It allows some flood protection measures to be immediately constructed while the more expensive elements of the system are under further design. The most significant finding concerning the barrier is that it could be overflown during storm tide events. This is due to the large surface area of the Jamaica Bay basin behind the barrier. This aspect is important because it lowers the height and therefore the costs of the barrier. <b>Vertical</b> <b>lift</b> <b>gates</b> are found to be optimal at this location due to their high reliability, lower costs through repetition, and their ability to allow tidal flow during normal conditions. Piers with shallow foundations along with top and sill beam have been chosen to house the vertical gates. An initial estimate of the costs the JBRRS ranges from $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion (2014 dollars). Because the barrier is still in the early design phases, the final costs of the system will differ from this estimate.

40|$|On 29 October 2012 {{hurricane}} Sandy hit {{the coast}} of New York City. This category 1 hurricane had a devastating effect: {{large parts of the}} city were flooded and the city was out of business for several days. An estimated total damage of $ 41. 9 billion had occurred of which $ 5 billion in account of the metro system. The largest damage was to the subway (underground) on Manhattan. The main challenge of this research was to design a protection for the subway of Manhattan. The main sources of flood water are the rivers that enter the city via overflow of the river bank. Flood water enters the subway system mainly via the ventilation grates and the commuter entrances. There are not many tubes that start in a flood prone area. The tube most vulnerable for flooding is the Steinway tube of the Flushing line, running from Queens under the East River to Grand Central Station on Manhattan. The Steinway tube has 200, 000 daily users and was flooded during Sandy via the ventilation grates on 50 th Avenue. The future flood levels in this report take the 90 th percentile sea level rise (SLR) projection into account as calculated by the NPCC. The safety level is currently 1 / 60 -years, but decreases to 1 / 5 -years is SLR projections in 2080 are reached. Long Island City is modelled as a storage basin where water enters via overflow of the East River Bank. The inflow of the 100 to 10, 000 year floods is modelled as a harmonic tidal wave. The results show that the water level in the basin is equal to the storm surge flood level in most cases. Combined with surface elevation data, the damage to the three subsystems Long Island City, the Steinway tube and the subway system of Manhattan shows that the risk is significant. At the considered flood levels, the Flushing line will flood via the start of the Steinway tube. The Steinway tube inflow model shows whether the flood water reaches Grand Central Station on Manhattan. A 1 / 500 -years flood in 2080 results in a total damage of $ 2, 571 million to all three systems. Compared to protection of only the Steinway tube, the multifunctional bank protection at the East River, called the Greenline, adds the most value to Long Island City. Considering the political and economic feasibility, the Greenline is not designed into detail. The Steinway Flood Gate scores the highest on benefit/costs-ratio, while the protection of Manhattan only is economic not feasible: the net present value is negative for each design level. The Steinway tube is protected by closing the ventilation grates and commuter entrances with covers that are designed by a third party. Directly in front of the Steinway tube, the Steinway Flood Gate is designed. This <b>vertical</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>gate</b> has a door of 6. 00 meters high and 7. 70 meters wide. Two towers of 12 meters support this flood door. The door is able to move in horizontal direction to enable the sealing of the tube. The Steinway Flood Gate is a perfect long-term flood protection that can be realized in the near future. It is an economically attractive investment that improves the safety of the New York City Subway system. However, in the faraway future the Greenline gives much more value per invested dollar.

In October 2011, the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued the FVL Strategic Plan to outline a joint approach {{for the next generation}} <b>vertical</b> <b>lift</b> aircraft for all military services. The Strategic Plan provided a foundation for replacing the current fleet with advanced capability by shaping the development of <b>vertical</b> <b>lift</b> aircraft for the next 25 to 40 years. It indicates that 80 percent of decision points for the DoD <b>vertical</b> <b>lift</b> fleet to either extend the life, retire, or replace with a new solution occurring in the next eight-ten years. Implementation of the FVL Strategic Plan which will impact <b>vertical</b> <b>lift</b> aviation operations for the next 50+ years. The U.S. Navy is a partner to the Army on the effort, so a derivative of FVL may be used in the Navy's MH-XX program to replace the service's MH-60S/R helicopters.|$|R

For a Poisson manifold $(M,w) $, we show that the complete lift $w^C$ and the <b>vertical</b> <b>lift</b> $w^V$ of the Poisson tensor $w$ are Poisson tensors on $T^A M$ and establish their properties. We prove that the complete and the <b>vertical</b> <b>lifts</b> induce homomorphisms of the Poisson cohomology spaces. We compute the modular classes of the lifts of Poisson structures.
