5|$|As {{with other}} requiem sharks, the blacktip shark {{exhibits}} <b>vivipary.</b> Females typically {{give birth to}} four to seven (range one to 10) pups every other year, making use of shallow coastal nurseries that offer plentiful food and fewer predators. Known nurseries include Pine Island Sound, Terra Ceia Bay, and Yankeetown along the Gulf Coast of Florida, Bulls Bay {{on the coast of}} South Carolina, and Pontal do Paraná on the coast of Brazil. Although adult blacktip sharks are highly mobile and disperse over long distances, they are philopatric and return to their original nursery areas to give birth. This results in a series of genetically distinct breeding stocks that overlap in geographic range.|$|E
5|$|In the {{majority}} of species of caecilians, the young are produced by <b>vivipary.</b> Typhlonectes compressicauda, a species from South America, is typical of these. Up to nine larvae can develop in the oviduct at any one time. They are elongated and have paired sac-like gills, small eyes and specialised scraping teeth. At first, they feed on the yolks of the eggs, but as this source of nourishment declines they begin to rasp at the ciliated epithelial cells that line the oviduct. This stimulates the secretion of fluids rich in lipids and mucoproteins on which they feed along with scrapings from the oviduct wall. They may increase their length sixfold and be two-fifths {{as long as their}} mother before being born. By this time they have undergone metamorphosis, lost their eyes and gills, developed a thicker skin and mouth tentacles, and reabsorbed their teeth. A permanent set of teeth grow through soon after birth.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} fish are {{viviparous}}. In such species the mother retains the eggs and nourishes the embryos. Typically, viviparous fish have a structure analogous to the placenta seen in mammals connecting the mother's blood supply {{with that of the}} embryo. Examples of viviparous fish include the surf-perches, splitfins, and lemon shark. Some viviparous fish exhibit oophagy, in which the developing embryos eat other eggs produced by the mother. This has been observed primarily among sharks, such as the shortfin mako and porbeagle, but is known for a few bony fish as well, such as the halfbeak Nomorhamphus ebrardtii. Intrauterine cannibalism is an even more unusual mode of <b>vivipary,</b> in which the largest embryos eat weaker and smaller siblings. This behavior is also most commonly found among sharks, such as the grey nurse shark, but has also been reported for Nomorhamphus ebrardtii.|$|E
25|$|Some {{of his own}} essays offered novel {{explanations}} to {{the emergence}} of biological functions: in an early article for Noua Revistă Română, he reportedly suggested that the purpose of bird singing was the prevention of asphyxia. He later {{came to the conclusion that}} the very evolution of mammals was made possible by the abundance or scarcity of food: the ancestors of such animals were arboreal and <b>vivipary</b> reptiles, who evolved into lighter and more agile species while continuously searching for food sources; an exception was the proverbially slow-moving sloth, whose feed, the slugs, was in abundance. Sanielevici explained hair growth on mammals (humans included) as an adaptation to humidity, while differences in skin pigmentation reflected exclusively the nature of the soil and the specimen's own blood circulation.|$|E
500|$|Primarily piscivorous, the Australian blacktip shark forms {{large groups}} of similar size and sex that tend to remain within a local area. It {{exhibits}} <b>vivipary,</b> meaning that the unborn young are provisioned through a placental connection. There is a well-defined annual reproductive cycle with mating occurring in February and March. Females bear one to six pups around January of the following year, after a 10-month gestation period. The Australian blacktip shark is among the sharks most commonly caught by northern Australian commercial fisheries. It is mainly valued for its meat, which is sold as [...] "flake". This species was an important catch of a Taiwanese gillnet fishery that operated from 1974 to 1986, and of the Australian Northern Shark Fishery that continues to the present day. As current fishing levels are not thought to threaten this shark's population, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Least Concern.|$|E
50|$|<b>Vivipary,</b> the {{production}} of offspring without the laying of a fertilized egg, developed independently in the lineages that led to humans (Homo sapiens) and southern water skinks (Eulampus tympanum, a kind of lizard). Put another way, {{at least one of}} the lineages that led to these species from their last common ancestor contains nonviviparous animals, the pelycosaurs ancestral to mammals; <b>vivipary</b> appeared subsequently in the mammal lineage.|$|E
50|$|Like {{many other}} {{mangrove}} species, it reproduces by <b>vivipary.</b> Seeds are {{encased in a}} fruit, which reveals the germinated seedling when it falls into the water.|$|E
50|$|Independently-developed traits {{like these}} {{cannot be used}} to {{distinguish}} paraphyletic groups because paraphyly requires the excluded groups to be monophyletic. Pelycosaurs were descended from the last common ancestor of skinks and humans, so <b>vivipary</b> could be paraphyletic only if the pelycosaurs {{were part of an}} excluded monophyletic group. Because this group is monophyletic, it contains all descendents of the pelycosaurs; because it is excluded, it contains no viviparous animals. This does not work, because humans are among these descendents. <b>Vivipary</b> in a group that includes humans and skinks cannot be paraphyletic.|$|E
50|$|In botany <b>vivipary</b> is {{a common}} {{alternative}} form of the term, and botanical definitions also vary. One usage refers to reproduction via embryos, such as shoots or bulbils, as opposed to germinating externally from a dropped, dormant seed, as is usual in plants; however, <b>vivipary</b> also may refer to plants arising from buds or seedlings that have formed or germinated while still on the parent plant, and are dropped when ready to establish themselves in the substrate. In botany too, the usage of the term is largely a matter of convenience and preference.|$|E
50|$|Broadly speaking, {{it can be}} {{inferred}} that phytosaurs were largely oviparous and superprecocial, like most sauropsids. However, Mystriosuchus has a pelvis {{similar to that of}} the later metriorhynchids, which could imply <b>vivipary.</b>|$|E
50|$|Late {{flowering}} occurs {{after the}} main growing season ends. They {{have a high}} seed output but their seeds have a reduced rate of maturing because of time constraints. These plants tend towards self pollination, apomixis, and <b>vivipary.</b>|$|E
50|$|Ovoviviparity:, a {{relatively}} less developed form of animal <b>vivipary,</b> ovoviviparity, occurs in most vipers for instance, and also in most live-bearing bony fishes (Poeciliidae). However, there are arguments in favour of abandoning the term as obsolete, because it is poorly and inconsistently defined.|$|E
50|$|A {{viviparous}} {{animal is}} an animal employing vivipary: the embryo develops {{inside the body}} of the mother, as opposed to outside in an egg (ovipary). The mother then gives live birth. The less developed form of <b>vivipary</b> is called ovoviviparity, which, for instance, occurs in most vipers. The more developed form of <b>vivipary</b> is called placental viviparity; mammals are the best example, but it has also evolved independently in other animals, such as in scorpions, some sharks, and in velvet worms. Viviparous offspring live independently and require an external food supply from birth. Certain lizards also employ this method such as the genera Tiliqua and Corucia. The placenta is attached directly to the mother in these lizards which is called viviparous matrotrophy.|$|E
50|$|The general {{shape of}} hupehsuchians {{seems to have}} made any {{locomotion}} on land nearly impossible, and, {{although there is no}} direct evidence seen in known specimens, these animals were probably viviparous, giving live birth at sea rather than laying eggs on land. <b>Vivipary</b> is also seen in ichthyosaurs.|$|E
50|$|Placental {{viviparity}} {{is arguably}} the most highly developed form of <b>vivipary.</b> Placental mammals, including humans, are the best-known example, but adaptations in some other animals also have incorporated this principle or close analogies. Other examples include some species of scorpions and cockroaches, certain genera of sharks and snakes, and velvet worms.|$|E
50|$|In some trees, like Jackfruit, some citrus, and avocado, {{the seeds}} {{can be found}} already germinated while the fruit goes overripe; {{strictly}} speaking this condition cannot be described as <b>vivipary,</b> but the moist and humid conditions provided by the fruit mimic a wet soil that encourages germination. However, the seeds also can germinate under moist soil.|$|E
50|$|False <b>vivipary</b> is an {{abnormal}} condition {{found in many}} types of plants in which a plantlet is produced where the flower should appear. It is not a completely understood topic, but some say it could {{be caused by a}} hormonal mistake. The plantlet which appears can be rooted and grown like normal plants. This abnormal behavior can occasionally be seen in many types of carnivorous plants.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Vivipary,</b> or live birth, {{may have}} been {{the most common form of}} {{reproduction}} in plesiosaurs, as they would have had difficulty laying eggs on land. Their bodies are not adapted to movement on land, and paleontologists have long hypothesized that they must have given birth in water. Other marine reptiles such as ichthyosaurs also gave live birth, but LACM 129639 was the first direct evidence of <b>vivipary</b> in plesiosaurs. The lives of Polycotylus and other plesiosaurs were K-selected, meaning that few offspring were born to each individual but those that were born were cared for as they mature. Because it gave birth to a single large offspring, the mother Polycotylus probably gave it some form of parental care for it to survive. F. Robin O'Keefe, one of the describers of LACM 129639, suggested that the social lives of plesiosaurs were [...] "more similar to those of modern dolphins than other reptiles." [...] K-selected life-history strategies are also seen in mammals and some lizards, but are unusual among reptiles.|$|E
50|$|Because it is {{difficult}} for seedlings to become established in tide-swept muddy habitats, Avicennia alba exhibits cryptovivipary. The embryos start to develop and break through the coat of the seeds before the fruits split open to shed the seeds. In some cases the plant also exhibits <b>vivipary,</b> with the developing shoot breaking through the fruit capsule while it is still growing on the bush. The seedlings have hooked hairs and are often seen growing in tangled groups.|$|E
50|$|Most archosaurs are oviparous. Birds and {{crocodilians}} lay hard-shelled eggs, as did extinct dinosaurs, and crocodylomorphs. Hard-shelled {{eggs are}} present in both dinosaurs and crocodilians, which {{has been used as}} an explanation for the absence of <b>vivipary</b> or ovovivipary in archosaurs. However, both pterosaurs and baurusuchids have soft-shelled eggs, implying that hard shells are not a plesiomorphic condition. The pelvic anatomy of Cricosaurus and other metriorhynchids and fossilized embryos belonging to the non-archosaur archosauromorph Dinocephalosaurus, together suggest that the lack of viviparity among archosaurs may be a consequence of lineage-specific restrictions.|$|E
5000|$|Histotrophic (tissue eating) {{viviparity}} means embryos {{develop in}} the female’s oviducts but obtain nutrients by consuming other tissues, such as ova (oophagy) or zygotes. This has been observed primarily among sharks such as the shortfin mako and porbeagle, but is known for a few bony fish as well such as the halfbeak Nomorhamphus ebrardtii. An unusual mode of <b>vivipary</b> is adelphophagy or intrauterine cannibalism, in which the largest embryos eat weaker, smaller unborn siblings. This is most commonly found among sharks such as the grey nurse shark, but has also been reported for Nomorhamphus ebrardtii.|$|E
5000|$|The {{families}} of Cyprinodontiformes {{can be divided}} into three groups: viviparous and ovoviviparous (all species give live birth), and oviparous (all species egg-laying). The live-bearing groups differ in whether the young are carried to term within (ovoviviparous) or without (viviparous) an enclosing eggshell. Phylogenetically however, one of the two suborders [...] - [...] the Aplocheiloidei [...] - [...] contains oviparous species exclusively, as do two of the four super{{families of}} the other suborder (the Cyprinodontoidea and Valencioidea of the Cyprinodontoidei). <b>Vivipary</b> and ovovivipary have evolved independently from oviparous ancestors, the latter possibly twice.|$|E
50|$|Coconuts {{could not}} reach inland {{locations}} without human intervention (to carry seednuts, plant seedlings, etc.) and early germination on the palm (<b>vivipary)</b> was important, rather than increasing the number or size of the edible parts of a fruit that was already large enough. Human cultivation of the coconut selected, not for larger size, but for thinner husks and increased volume of endosperm, the solid “meat” or liquid “water” that provides the fruit its food value. Although these modifications for domestication would reduce the fruit’s ability to float, this ability would be irrelevant to a cultivated population.|$|E
50|$|Among lizards, the {{viviparous}} lizard Zootoca vivipara, slow worms and {{many species of}} skink are viviparous, giving birth to live young. Some are ovoviviparous but others such {{as members of the}} genera Tiliqua and Corucia, give birth to live young that develop internally, deriving their nourishment from a mammal-like placenta attached {{to the inside of the}} mother's uterus. In a recently described example, an African species, Trachylepis ivensi, has developed a purely reptilian placenta directly comparable in structure and function to a mammalian placenta. <b>Vivipary</b> is rare in snakes, but boas and vipers are viviparous, giving birth to live young.|$|E
50|$|The olm's {{embryonic}} development takes 140 days, {{after which}} it takes another 14 {{years to reach}} sexual maturity. The larvae gain adult appearance after nearly four months, with the duration of development strongly correlating with water temperature. Unconfirmed historical observations of <b>vivipary</b> exist, {{but it has been}} shown that the females possess a gland that produces the egg casing, similar to those of fish and egg-laying amphibians. It was long thought that female olm gave birth to live young at lower temperatures and laid eggs at higher, but rigorous observations have not confirmed that. The olm appears to be oviparous.|$|E
50|$|Ovoviviparous animals develop within {{eggs that}} remain within the mother's body up until they hatch or {{are about to}} hatch. This {{strategy}} of birth is known as ovoviviparity. It is similar to <b>vivipary</b> in that the embryo develops within the mother's body. Unlike the embryos of viviparous species, ovoviviparous embryos are nourished by the egg yolk {{rather than by the}} mother's body. However, the mother's body does provide gas exchange. Ovoviviparity is the method of reproduction used by many aquatic life forms such as fish and some sharks, reptiles, and invertebrates. The young of ovoviviparous amphibians are sometimes born as larvae, and undergo metamorphosis outside the body of the mother.|$|E

50|$|The German herpetologist Robert Mertens found a {{pregnant}} Corsican fire salamander in the Restonica Valley that {{gave birth to}} four offspring without gills and already with the characteristic black and yellow of the adults. At the same time, he found normally developing aquatic larvae with their three characteristic feathery external gills on each side of their heads and camouflage blending into the pond's substrate. The astonishing reproductive ability of <b>vivipary</b> is well known from the fire salamander's northwest Spanish subspecies, S. s. bernardezi (Asturian fire salamander) and the alpine salamander (S. atra) from the central and east Alps. This can be interpreted as a local adaptation to xerothermic climate conditions and lack of ponds and brooks.|$|E
50|$|As an adult, it {{generally}} reaches about 15 to 30 cm (6 to 12 in) of length with a 22 to 39 g weight {{and has a}} small head, cylindrical body, and five toes on each foot. They are very agile and are often found in arid areas. It is strongly related to Chalcides colosii, and C. colosii was formerly considered a subspecies of C. ocellatus. C. ocellatus is notable {{for the presence of}} ocelli and for its wide variety of coloration patterns. It preys on various insects, including those with hard exoskeletons, arachnids, and small lizards, including its own young. In captivity it also eats sweet fruits, boiled eggs and pieces of meat. Females of the species give birth to live young through <b>vivipary.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Although {{most species}} of skinks are oviparous, laying eggs in clutches, some 45% of skink species are {{viviparous}} {{in one sense}} or another. Many species are ovoviviparous, the young developing lecithotrophically in eggs that hatch inside the mother's reproductive tract, and emerging as live births. In some genera, however, such as Tiliqua and Corucia, the young developing in the reproductive tract derive their nourishment from a mammal-like placenta attached to the female - unambiguous examples of viviparous matrotrophy. Furthermore, an example recently described in Trachylepis ivensi is the most extreme to date: a purely reptilian placenta directly comparable in structure and function, to a eutherian placenta. [...] Clearly, such <b>vivipary</b> repeatedly has developed independently in the evolutionary history of the Scincidae and the different examples are not ancestral to the others. In particular, placental development of whatever degree in lizards is phylogenetically analogous, rather than homologous, to functionally similar processes in mammals.|$|E

50|$|A more {{developed}} form of <b>vivipary</b> called placental viviparity is adopted by some species of scorpions and cockroaches, certain genera of sharks, snakes and velvet worms. In these, the developing embryo is nourished by {{some form of}} placental structure. The earliest known placenta was found recently {{in a group of}} extinct fishes called placoderms, which are ancestral to mammals. A fossil from Australia's Gogo Formation, laid down in the Devonian period, 380 million years ago, was found with an embryo inside it connected by an umbilical cord to a yolk sac. The find confirmed the hypothesis that a sub-group of placoderms, called ptyctodontids, fertilized their eggs internally. Some fishes that fertilize their eggs internally also give birth to live young, as seen here. This discovery moved our knowledge of live birth back 200 million years. The fossil of another genus was found with three embryos in the same position. Placoderms are a sister group of the ancestor of all living jawed fishes (Gnathostomata), including both chondrichthyians, the sharks & rays, and Osteichthyes, the bony fishes.|$|E
50|$|The pachyostosis seen in {{the bones}} of Mesosaurus may have enabled it to reach neutral {{buoyancy}} in the upper few meters of the water column. The additional weight may have stabilized the animal at the water's surface. Alternatively, it could have given Mesosaurus greater momentum when gliding underwater. While many features suggest a wholly aquatic lifestyle, Mesosaurus may {{have been able to}} move onto land for short periods of time. The elbows and ankles had restricted movement, making walking impossible. It is more likely that if Mesosaurus moved onto land, it would push itself forward in a similar way to living female sea turtles when nesting on beaches.Fossil embryos of Mesosaurus have been discovered in Uruguay and Brazil. These fossils are the earliest record of amniote embryos, although amniotes are inferred to have had this reproductive strategy since their first appearance in the Late Carboniferous. Prior to their description, the oldest known amniotic embryos were from the Triassic. The embryo fossils of Mesosaurus are not surrounded by egg shells, suggesting that Mesosaurus, like many other marine reptiles, gave live birth. If this interpretation is correct, these embryos represent the earliest known example of <b>vivipary</b> in the fossil record. One Mesosaurus specimen called MCN-PV 2214 clearly preserves a medium-size adult and a small embryo in utero. Other specimens include small individuals, which may be embryonic, in association with the bones of larger individuals that may be their parents.|$|E
